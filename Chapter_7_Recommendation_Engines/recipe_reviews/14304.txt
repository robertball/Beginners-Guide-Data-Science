I am not quite sure why the 1 user didn't care for this dish. I made the mistake of fixing it last night for a mexican theme tonight. Now I have to fix another bowl today because there is only about a cup left. This is such an easy recipe and it does NOT have to be followed by the letter to turn out grand.....Be creative...

This was excellent.  The changes I made are to first DRAIN AND RINSE THE BEANS.  The first time I made it I did not and it got sloppy and mushy.  I used frozen white shoepeg corn, only because I personally hate canned corn (if you use canned I'd drain that too), and I used one can black beans and one can kidneys - just to add to the color.  Also, instead of bottled Italian dressing I made my own with capers, caper juice, white wine, balsamic vinegar, olive oil, and garlic - you can probably use any kind of oil/vinegar dressing you like.  The jalepeno added just enough spice, I'd personally use a little more but this was fine.  Oh - and I used whole grape tomatoes, sliced ones may make it too runny also.

This made for a beautiful salad-the color combination was great.  Someone mentioned how horrible it looked-they must not have drained the beans is all I can figure.  I did make a few changes.  I added some cumin, cayenne pepper and chili powder.  After I had it all mixed up I thought it was screaming for pasta so I added about a cup of cooked rotini.  I used red and green peppers and also added a bit of chopped celery.  I left the pimentos out because it was red enough and didn't have the avocado so I skipped that as well. My end result was a very tasty and pretty side dish.

I've made this salad a couple times since trying it.  Very easy, and no cooking involved.  I've omitted the pimentos, but the salad doesn't need it.  I love black beans, so I put equal parts black beans and corn.  Also, I'd add a red or yellow bell pepper for more color and a little more sweetness than the green.  Don't skimp on the cilantro, and for some additional punch add a little more jalapeno pepper.  Delicioso!

I've made this several times and have meant to submit my rave review for about a year now.  This recipe is tasty, healthy and very versatile. Make it spicy or not---eat it as a salad, use it as a salsa with chips, or throw it in a pita or tortilla!  My variation is to use 2 cans beans, 1 can corn and omit the avocado & pimentos. (avocado gets a bit slimy as a leftover) That's just me though--this can be adjusted to anyone's preference! Truly a winner!!

I can't say enough bad things about this recipe. Mixing the ingredients makes it looks terrible and completely unappetizing. I followed the recipe to the letter, and ended up with enough salad to feed 100 people (unless for some reason this is the only dish available). I brought this salad to a mexican theme potluck party, and it was a TOTAL flop. No one touched it. Very embarrassing, a waste of money, and a waste of time.

Great recipe! Instead of fresh tomatoes I bought canned diced tomatoes and drained them before adding them to the salad. You can't tell the difference.

I have made this several times and it never fails that I am asked for the recipe everytime!  However, I am not sure who decided it only takes 20 minutes of prep time!! It usually takes well over an hour, but is worth it!

My children (who will eat just about anything) did not care for this. They did not like the sharpness of the lime juice. I loved it. We had it as a salad the first day. The second day I had it in a wrap with some lettuce. The third day I added some chopped chicken and rice and served it warm. One recipe, so many ways to serve it!

This was good except we found the dressing to be too much and to take away from the southwestern flavor.  The second time we used only lime juice, cilantro, salt and pepper and it was very light, refreshing and a perfect match.

I left out the onions and the green pepper because I didn't have them on hand. Took it to a fiesta to eat as a dip and had some leftovers so we wrapped the salad in tortillas with some white rice and shredded cheese.  Totally rocked!

I don't like pimenntos so I left them 
out. Also, this will freeze well if you
leave out the avocados, that way I can
make a big batch and freeze it (lots of
chopping involved). I didn't seed or 
peel my tomatos so I only had to use
1/2 cup of salad dressing. It's great!
Make some and freeze it for later!

This was fresh and deliciously healthy!
Try adding a can of diced tomatoes with green chillies and omitting the avocado and pimentos.  
It is even better!

This is an awesome recipe.  I've taken it to several potlucks.  It's great the next day too.  It gets a little soggy and works well with chips!

This was great!  I did make a couple of changes though due to personal preference.  I left out the tomatoes and pimentos and added sliced black olives and cubes of cheddar cheese.  Also I only used 1/4 to 1/2 cup of dressing.  I have made it twice and both times it was gone in a matter of hours.  The last batch my non-vegetable eating brother ate the rest right out of the bowl with a spoon!  I will make again and again!  Thank you!

Everyone loved it! The lime juice sealed the deal. I used a can of rotel with chilies and cilantro instead of everything separate and did not include the pimentos. and left out the green peppers because I thought the jalapenos were enough. mmmmm it was so good! Cant wait to put it in a quesadilla! That is going to be WOW!

I served this as a topping for a lettuce (iceberg/romaine combo) salad. I topped the bean mixture  with Mexican Shredded Cheese. This was a big hit at a Mexican Pot Luck. I think the lime juice really gives it a nice flavor. I only used one can of corn and that was perfect for me. I think two would have been too much. My avocado was not quite ripe, so I did not have the problem others did who said it turned to mush. Mine stayed firm. I only used 1/4 cup of salad dressing, and might skip altogether next time. I didn't have garlic salt, so used 1/4 tsp. salt and 1/4 tsp. garlic powder. I think maybe minced or roasted garlic would be a nice touch. This is a very nice, versatile recipe. Thanks for sharing.

My daughter and I love this recipe. I leave out the pimiento and jalapeno and use 2 cans of beans. I use chopped red onion in place of the green and red wine vinegar instead of the salad dressing. This recipe can be adjusted to easily to your likes and dislikes that is practically foolproof.

WE loved this salad! it was a huge hit at our "mexican themed" dinner party. I handed this recipe to a coworker and I said, "I think it will be a winner" and it sure was. The only thing I would add more of is lime juice- and maybe 2 cloves of actual crushed garlic. I like tangier things-however the original recipe is great!! we definitely recommend. This ones a keeper!

Wonderful recipe to be creative with! I used fresh corn, added lettuce, lite sour cream and lime zest; omitted the green pepper, pimentos and Italian dressing.  Rolled it up in a toasted tortilla.  Thanks for sharing your recipe Merle!

This recipe is a hit every time I make it.  I disagree that this is an "eat right-away" dish, though.  I find it much better after it has been refrigerated for 24 hours so that all of the flavors get a chance to mix.  I serve it with chips and as a side dish mixed with rice.  All of the taste of my favorite "Texas Caviar" in half the prep time!  Highly recommended, but be advised, it makes a lot and it's so good you may eat it all yourself!

Just made this salad yesterday and it was wonderful! Had raving reviews from the family and I also used a robust Italian dressing which gave it a little more of a kick. We found that the cilantro was a very necessary addition. A great choice for a dish to pass or pot luck.

I have made this recipe for a group of friends and for a church pot luck luncheon.  Even the men who usually do not touch veggies devoured this!  I've been asked to make more for next time.  It is wonderful as a dip with chips also.

Delicious, Fresh & Easily adaptable. I used Fresh corn that I grilled then cut off the cobb. Added a red pepper which I prefer to pimento's as it's crunchier. Instead of Italian dressing I used Lime juice, Olive oil and added some more Southwest seasonings. I omitted the avocado as I felt it would be too mushy also, but I wanted to add sliced black olives - maybe next time...

Used a garlic vinagrette instead of Itailian dressing, and I didn't have the avocado or Jalepenos but still Delish!

My grandkids love this salad (finger food).  I use Newman's Own Lime Vinagrette salad dressing and add chopped dried mangoes to the salad.  Delicious!

I have been making this recipe for a couple of years now and am just taking the time to rate it.  I love it!  Everytime I've made it for potlucks or when we've had guests over, I get asked for the recipe.  It's really healthy and tastes great.  One of the reviewers who said it came out mushy even admitted that s/he didn't drain the beans or corn - which the recipe clearly states that you need to do.  I rarely use the cilantro when I make it - not that it's bad, but I generally don't have much use for cilantro and the rest not used for the recipe goes to waste.  I have also made it with and without avocado and it's great either way.  I agree with the reviewer who said the avocado doesn't do so well when you're eating it as leftovers - but you probably won't have leftovers anyway!  :-)  I have made it with and without the pimentos, and I think I've only used the jalapenos once - again, not because it tastes bad - just because we don't usually eat jalapenos.  I read a review here that suggested using a zesty Italian dressing and I do that now all the time.  I have found that t does take a bit of prep time to cut up the veggies - more than the 20 minutes - I guess I'm not the fastest chopper in the world, and I'm generally doubling the recipe, but it can take me an hour to put this together.  So, I would suggest making it as written, then adding/leaving out things you and your family prefer.  I think you'll find it a winner every time.

Great!  I used only one can of corn and put in a can of black eyed peas in its place.  I used a can of diced tomatoes and a 4 oz. can of jalapenos instead of the 3 tomatoes and cutting up the jalapenos.  I used 1/2 Zesty Italian dressing and 1/2 regular Italian dressing.  I topped it all of with a glob of sour cream.  It didn't look very appetizing to me, but it sure was good.  Ate it with chips.  The hubby thought it was fantastic.  I thought it would be too spicy for my 15 month old, but he couldn't get enough of it.

My family loves this!  Sometimes I leave out the avocado if none look good at the store and it's still awesome.  I use fresh corn too, two or three ears, instead of the canned.

This is an awesome recipe! I can see me making this again and again! Also a nice topping for fish & chicken. Just poach fish (I use salmon or tilapia)in orange juice, and spoon some of this on top or on the side. Serve with coleslaw, potato salad, or macaroni salad..yum!

Wonderful, quick salad and it makes a large amount with little effort. Perfect for potluck. I omitted the pimento and added another avocado. It looked and tasted great.

This salad looked fabulous on my Super Bowl Sunday Buffet! The flavors melded nicely, and I could tell by the way they were shovelling it down, that all the guys really enjoyed it. Left out the pimientos at hubby's request. Thanks Merle.

Absolutely delicious. I add the avocado and tomato about a half hour before serving. I also added cooked quinoa, about 1.5 cups, and it was a perfect addition. Didn't add bell pepper or pimento and it was fine without it. I also used vinegar and olive oil instead of Italian dressing. SO good.

Took this to our annual block party and it was absolutely fantastic - and gone very quickly.  A few changes - although I love avocado, I omitted it b/c not everyone does, and I omitted the pimentos for the same reason.  Added cumin & freshly ground pepper, and used grape tomatoes, quartered, in place of regular tomatoes as they're not quite in season here yet. Used Ken's Light Northern Italian w/Basil & Romano.  I will be making this again and again and again!

Wow - what a great recipe! I only used 1 jalepeno, and I substituted purple onion for the green onions as suggested. I only added about 1/3 cup cilantro and I quartered a whole container of grape tomatoes instead of large ones. I used Newman's oil and vinegar dressing and added a bit of balsamic vinegar too, also dashed a bit of tex mex seasoning and used 2 cloves of garlic (minced) instead of garlic salt. 
I then cooked up some breaded chicken breasts, sliced them up, put some on some sun dried tomatoe tortilla's threw on some shredded cheese, a few dollaps of sour cream, and a whole bunch of the bean salad - wrapped it up and holy cow what a great dinner! Full of protein and so filling! I think I would dice 2 avacados next time...thanks!

One of the BEST side dishes ever.  Very colorful and full of flavor.  You can use leftover salad (if you have any!) in a tortilla wrap - delicious.

This is a wonderful, fresh tasting salad that goes with so many other dishes!  Everyone loves it, so I have made it many times. Don't skimp on the cilantro. Also, I made this with canned peppers instead of fresh and finely diced red pepper instead of the pimento because that's what I had on hand.  The substitutions were great as well.

This was WONDERFUL.  I made it about 3 hours before serving which I think was the right amount of time.  Doesn't need a ton of dressing because of all the other juices - lime, pimento, drippings of tomato etc.  If you added another avocado, it could definitely be a bit more "gooey" and rate as an excellent dip with tortilla chips.  This will become a BBQ standard.

Wonderful!  It was the perfect side dish for a veggie burrito recipe I was trying.  I omitted the jalapenos (didn't want spicy for this meal), omitted the pimentos (preference), cut the cilantro and salad dressing by half and used low fat dressing.  And we liked it just as well the next day.

I served this with BBQ ribs and a potato salad.  I had to substitute a couple of things, like pickled jalapenos for fresh, and dried cilantro for fresh, but it still tasted great.  Will definitely try again with fresh ingredients.  Thanks, Merle!

i've had to reprint this recipe over and over, because i always get asked for the recipe.  my whole family loves this one. definitley worth the time and effort.  i made a double batch for large party the last time and had a little left over.  so i drained off the salad dressing and added a can of nacho cheese soup.  it was pretty good.

I made this for a pot-luck and it disappeared. It's a good thing that I didn't bring all of it because my husband devoured what I left at home! If you're concerned about the hotness, I found that the jalapenos didn't really make this dish very hot. I had an orange sweet pepper, so I used that instead of the green. It added a nice color combination. This is a very pretty salad and a keeper.

I made this recipe for a Derby party. There was a lot of food on the table but this salad was gone before anything else was! The presentation is colorful. The tastes are interesting and bold. I had five people ask me for the recipe before we left. I rinse the beans and Mexican corn mix (canned) before use. I skip the dressing and garlic salt because they really aren't necessary. I keep the canned veggies on hand so I can quickly throw this together for last minute invites. This is a winner recipe. You really can't be disappointed with this side dish.

I was looking for a dish to pass at my MOPS meeting and remembered having something with black beans before so I searched here for something and this caught my attention. DELICIOUS! i omitted the pimentos just because I don't like them...and actually didn't have any Italian dressing, so i only used the lime. Totally don't need the dressing in my opinion. I thought the recipe called for red onion so I put that in mine and not the green; and used real garlic. I served with tortilla chips and I didn't come home with any leftovers!

This was great on it's own as a summer salad, but I felt like at the time it was kind of lacking and I wanted to make it better for my dinner. I added some sour cream and cholula sauce...it can be used as a dip like that or over some grilled chicken. Also really good

Great, but I would recommend a homemade dressing. I did one with olive oil, fresh squeezed lemon and frsh garlic. The dressing is key

Makes a lot, but can be eaten in many ways. So far as a dip, in pita's, side salad and on top of a taco salad.

Good salad....I changed the bean/corn ratio because we love beans and they are so good for you, so I used 2 cans of black beans and 1 can of corn.  And unfortuantely I had no fresh cilantro on hand so I used some dried. Fresh I know would have been way better, and I used fresh lime juice and the zest of that lime for a little more lime flavor. Made this in the morning and let marinate all day until dinner.....delicious...served with Fantastic Chicken Burgers from this site.

Excellent salad.  I didn't have Italian dressing and used lime juice and a little olive oil.  Very tasty and healthy.  I am always asked to bring this along to BBQ's.

This recipe creates a lot of salad!  I made it to take to a party and served with tortilla chips.  I personally couldn't stop eating it.  VERY healthy, lots of flavors, textures.  Love the cilantro.

This was so yummy. I added lemon juice to it also. Then after it chilled I heated up some corn tortillas and made vegetarian tacos out of it. I topped it with some queso fresco and more avocado. Even my carnivore husband loved it!

This was okay, but I wasn't a fan of the salad dressing. I think it would have been better with balsamic vinegar.

Can't wait to try this! It's chilling in the fridge now. I made it as directed, except for the following changes based on ingredients I had on hand: 1) Substituted 2 cans of corn with 2 ears of fresh grilled sweet corn, 2 substituted 1 green pepper with an additonal jalapeno from my garden (which have been pretty mild this year), 3) omitted the avocado (didn't have it), 4) omitted the jar pimentos (didn't have it, and didn't want it), and  5) substituted the lime for 2 tbls lemon juice.

One of the best beans salads I have tasted and super easy! I defrosted frozen corn instead of canned because that is what I had on hand. I added the minced jalapeno to the italian dressing as my first step, to avoid hot spots in the salad like another reviewer recommended. Once I had all the ingredients together, I poured the dressing mixture onto the salad. Although I love avocado, I would omit it for next time. It makes the salad look a little "slimy" for a lack of better words.

This vegetarian dish is a favorite. Try using salsa if you can't get good tomatoes. Great in a wrap, too. Expect compliments!

This is a great recipe.  I don't usually add quite as many tomatoes as called for, and I make sure to soak the diced jalapenos in the dressing overnight to avoid "hot spots" in the salad, but I have made this for many a potluck or barbecue, and it's always a hit.

Great bean salad. I made a few little adjustments. I used the lime juice as a dressing at the end combined with garlic, olive oil, and salt. Used it as a dressing to dress it right before serving. Also...no pimentos and red instead of green onion. Only good for a day of so...afterwards, it gets really soggy.

Love this recipe! You can definitely tweak it to your preferences.  I usually don't use the italian dressing and just use a little olive oil, salt, lime and chili powder.  I also usually skip the green pepper (hubby isn't a fan) and the left overs are great heated up in a taco shell!

I didn't change a thing about this recipe, and it was so good. But, it took me longer than 20 minutes to prepare. There was a lot of chopping involved. It took me more like 45 minutes. But, the end result was worth it. I will definitely make again.

Changes I made: 1) using only one can of corn (lower-carb husband) and 2) using half of a red pepper and half of a green pepper.

Otherwise, it was spot-on. My family loved it and I will be making it again.

This has become a staple in our house.  I have always used an orange pepper in place of green (just don't like green ones).  I LOVE black beans so I use 2 cans of beans and only one of corn.  I also cut the tomatoes and remove the seeds and goop first, so it doesn't get soggy.  I've never taken it anywhere and not had someone ask me for the recipe.  Delicious!

I was very leery about the idea of using Italian dressing in a Mexican dish, but it actually ended up tasting pretty good.  However, it did have that slight salad dressingy taste which I don't care for since I think it makes dishes taste not-quite-homemade.  The next time I make this I think I will just use a little bit of olive oil and a splash of cider vinegar in lieu of the dressing.

I don't know where to begin - this recipe is AWESOME!!!  I have made this many times and each time I love it more.  I have had the Black Bean Salad with Taco's and as a salsa dip with Tostidos.  I grilled chicken on the grill last week and had the salad on the side.  This salad is great and refreshing on a hot summer day.  I followed the directions except I did not add the avocado's (allergic) and pimentos because I didn't have any and it was still fantastic.  This is even better the next day because the lime, cilantro and Italian dressing have time to marinate.  If I could give this recipe more than 5 stars, I would!  Thank you for an absolutely fantastic recipe!!!

I really liked this recipe. However, I added  some barbequed chicken strips for protein and included 1 red pepper and omited the pimentos and jalapeno. It was watery leaving it overnight. So the next time I made it 4-5 hours before the time to be served. Much better. Delicious with the chicken!

This is a fabulous recipe.  I brought it to a July 4th picnic and it was a huge hit. Everyone wanted the recipe. It is much for like a salsa than a salad, although you could use it over chicken, lettuce, and cheese and it would be great.  It would be great over any kind of poultry or seafood.  It makes a huge amount, but over the course of the whole day it was gone.

I loved it! I forgot avocado and didn't know what pimentos were so I left them out. I put the tomatoes in a strainer to remove excess water and only used 3/4 cup of cilantro and 1 1/2 jalapenos. The garlic salt could be left out because by the next day it gets a little strong.

I had to modify this recipe because I can't eat spicy, so I omitted the jalapeno peppers, avocado(only because I forgot to buy it) and the pimentos, used a red bell pepper instead of green, WOW, this recipe was awesome, next time I am going to add the avocado and maybe some cucumber, this was a really good recipe...thanks!

This is such a fantastic salad! We now use it in place of salsa for everything from fajitas to chips... and we always make sure we have a bag of tortilla chips on hand to finish off whatever we don't eat with dinner!

I served this with enchiladas, but I found it a little bland. I would try and heat it up more and add more seasoning. But the presentation and texture were great. I mixed it earlier in the afternoon and added the avocado just before serving.

Beautiful presentation.  I also used a glass bowl.  It took me 45 minutes to make including clean up time.  I thought it was good, but not the best recipe I used at my party.  My guests just picked at it.  Nobody asked for the recipe.  I don't think I will make it again.

This was very good, lots of flavor and color. But make only what you can eat at one meal, as it wasn't good the next day.

Very good!! I made this for a Cinco de Mayo dinner and it was a great addition to our meal. I would not hesitate to make this again... and it would not have to be a mexican themed meal either. :)

This is a very versatile side dish that could be served with a multitude of items. I served mine with a grilled marinated chicken breast with a warm roasted garlic and avocado sauce. I was unsure at first how Italian dressing would tie in with the ingredients but once I tasted it, it made total sense. I splurged a little and used Olive Garden Italian dressing. Delicious! I only used one can of corn but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. The leftovers made a tasty and somewhat healthy work lunch too! I look forward to "playing" with this recipe a little in the future and possibly adding in other ingredients.

I really enjoyed this salad!  I made a few minor changes to the recipe.  I left out the avocado, because I knew we wouldn't eat all of it and wanted the leftovers to keep longer.  Also, I wisked together the lime juice, italian dressing, garlic salt, salt, pepper and garlic salt before adding it to the salad instead of adding it separately.  I also added one clove of very finely minced garlic which I think really added to the flavor.

Tasty! I have a habit, for better or worse, of not following recipes to the letter (except in baking). A quick word of warning to those with the same habit: don't overdo the tomatoes. I love tomatoes but too many of them made a giant acidic puddle of liquid at the bottom.

Cumin was a good addition.

My whole family loved this! I first had it when visiting a friend clear across the country, and asked her for the recipe. She made a copy for me and I had to smile when I read that it was from Allrecipes, my favorite recipe source. One daughter does not like black beans, corn, or tomatoes and was hesitant to try it, but then raved about the combination. Following my friend's example, I added cubed pepper jack cheese, but then was concerned it may be too hot for my kids with the jalapenos, so left them out. Next time I will probably add jalapenos from my garden and use Monterey Jack cheese. I didn't have a lime so used a small lemon. I used garlic powder and sea salt instead of garlic salt, and no pimentos, minor changes. Our power was out, so it was perfect to fix by flashlight! Due to that, I just served it with tortilla chips. I couldn't stop eating it, it was great! Thank you!

This is really a great salad.  The only thing is that don't expect it to be ready in 20 minutes unless you are one fast chopper or buy pre-chopped! I added some banana pepper simply because we have a bountiful yield of these tasty peppers.

This is absolutely delicious.  The only changes I made is I added 1 19 oz. can of black beans (rinsed) and 1 15 oz. can of corn.  I didn't measure the cilantro so it may have been a bit shy of a cup and I added fresh garlic instead of garlic salt.  Everything else I followed exactly and this salad is amazing!  Thanks for sharing it!

This was amazing!!  Just what I was looking for.  Crisp, fresh, and flavorful.  I did forget the green onions (which are not my favorite anyway), and never did find pimentos at the grocery store, but I couldn't tell anything was lacking.   Excellent!!!

Delicious and Healthy! This is my daughters favorite dish.  We add long grain white rice before refrigerating. I also omit the jalapeno peppers (too hot for her)  HINT: Only add the avocado and tomato the day of otherwise they will breakdown quickly and will not keep for the following days.

I have this thing about fresh ingredients.  If you want to take this already superb recipe to the top of the chart, cut FRESH sweet white(about 2 ears for this recipe) corn from the cobb, simmer in salted water for about 6 to 8 minutes, drain and add to the salad instead of canned corn.  What a difference!

I have also made a similar salad from Guy Fieri which uses crushed pineapple and no avocado.  I prefer that one, but this black bean salad is tasty as well.  I didn't use the full amount of salad dressing.  I think if I made it again, though, I would use the full 1/2 cup since it would definitely help the flavor.

I'm giving this 5 stars because I followed the recipe to a T the first time and it was fantastic. The second time I made some minor changes for convenience: I bought fresh pico de gallo in the vegetable section at the grocery store in place of chopping the tomatoes, jalapenos, and onions (bonus: it came seasoned). I used 1 can of corn and 2 cans of black beans and omitted the Italian dressing (since the pico was seasoned so well and it saves calories).

Wow, thanks for this recipe.  Very fresh and healthy.  I made a few changes: used olive oil instead of Italian dressing, used red onion instead of green onion, used one can of corn (that is all I had, next time I will use two cans), used a little less cilantro.  I served this with grilled chicken ( and had a huge plate of it for lunch the next day).  YUMMY!!!

My husband and I really liked this.  Next time I'll definitely scale it down unless I'm brining it to a party - it makes a ton!!!  I added 1/2 red peper and omitted the pimentos because I forgot to buy them.  This takes a lot of prep work, but it was worth it.

This is a really flavorful and quickly made meal when paired with some tortilla chips.  The colors make it attractive and the textures and tastes of the various ingredients work so well.  The first time I made it with bottled lime juice and the second time I used fresh.  Fresh is definitely the way to go!  I split the recipe in half and I am still enjoying the results 3 days later.  Delicious!

Yummy!  This was a hit at my Cinco de Mayo party.  I used Zesty Italian dressing for an extra zip.  There was a lot of liquid though, so next time I would be sure to drain everything a little better or maybe put less dressing.

This is great!  It's a staple in my household.  I add extra black beans, red and yellow pepper, and omit the jalapenos.  I tried doubling the dressing once, but it made it much too sweet.  I think the seasoning is perfect if you follow the recipe.

My adult kids (20's) couldn't get enough of this and now I have to make it every time we have a get-together! I even bought a new chopper just for this recipe. It's quite a bit of work to seed and chop the peppers & tomatoes. I now make it the night before except for the tomatoes and avocados which I add just before serving. It does need to be drained first if you do it this way. The flavor mix is so worth all the work!

Wow. I just made this recipe for a family reunion tomorrow and they will be lucky if it makes it there. It is awesome. I did not change a thing, except I did not have italian salad dressing (I thought I did). I had to use sundried tomato and oregano dressing. It is absolutly great with nacho chips. This is a keeper!!!!!

I made this for a potluck and brought home an empty bowl and loads of compliments!  Easy to make, as long as you don't mind a lot of chopping.  I didn't have pimentos and put in basil instead of cilantro (it was what I had on hand).  Great summer salad, very fresh and different.  It is a beautiful salad as well!

Very good, fresh tasting salad.  I skipped the avocado, because I needed it to keep for a few days.  Makes alot of salad - enough for 2 families.  If you get rid of all the seeds and white inner membraines the jalapeno is much cooler.

This was a great accompaniment to chili and avocado salad.  I used half yellow bell peppers and half green bell peppers.  This is not a "make ahead" salad.  It's best when prepared just before serving, so the vegetables are crisp and flavorful and before the avocado has a chance to get mushy.

We absolutly LOVE this "dip" or side dish.  I dont add pimentos or jalepenoes.  If I dont have avacado on hand I leave it out as well.  Like another reviewer stated I too leave the seeds in the tomatoes.  It is a bit time consuming to chop and dice, but WAY worth it.  We put it on top of tortilla chips and YUMM!

Very good!  Prep time, with all the chopping, took about 45 minutes. Skipped pimentos.  Makes more than 12 servings, and very tasty. I did make it a day ahead, which was convenient and allowed all the spices to blend.  Everyone loved it, and had requests for the recipe.

Wonderful! Easy, colorful, flavorful, "different"!  One of my dinner hosts doesn't like cilantro, but she was able to get a large serving past that reservation. (I suppose the cilantro could be ommitted, but I think that wold be a serious loss!

Serve in a glass bowl!

this was just ok. i halved the recipe and ommitted the avocado (didn't have any). i used a red bell pepper instead of green, fat free italian dressing, and only about 1 tablespoon of fresh cilantro-- still seemed to be way too much. the salad tasted better before i added the cilantro, i would decrease it significantly before making again, and i think i may try some of the other similar recipes on the site first as well. but the idea was a good one, corn and black beans, peppers, and onions do go very well together.

This came out wonderfully - made it for a potluck BBQ recently and it was a hit.  Quick and simple.
That said, it was BETTER after I added some red onion.  Next time I make it, I think I will skip the green onion (which I didn't feel added anything to the flavor) and use red onion instead.  Prettier too!

This is fantastic!!  Just made it tonight and ate 1/4 of the recipe as my dinner, makes an awesome vegetarian meal!  Like many, I left out the avocado and pimentos, and I added a second green pepper (grocery store was out of red sweet pepper, will add that next time in place of the second green pepper).  Used frozen corn niblets rather than canned.  Also, I was a little short on Italian dressing and added extra lime juice to make up the difference.  The flavour of this is incredible!!  Saved to my recipe box, a keeper!

I was hesitant to make this for my family of picky eaters, especially with all the raw veggies, but I went for it anyway. This recipe was very simple to put together and the colors are beautiful. I didn't have avocado or pimento and I used lime juice because that's what I had on hand. Also, I added red onions because I'm an onion nut. Next time I think I'll add red and yellow bell peppers for more amazing color and much more jalapeños it needed more bite. My younger kids didn't care for it but my older one did. My husband only liked it with tortillas chips as kinda a salsa and I really enjoyed it just as it is. I'm going to try someone's suggestion to add chicken breast and serve warm with the leftovers.

I loved this salad!  Next time I will use less Italian dressing but that's just a personal preference. My husband, who doesn't like tomatoes or avocados said he would eat it again.

I love this recipe. I actually left out the Italian dressing and instead put a scoop of the mix on some lettuce with some tortilla strips and ranch dressing and had a fantastic salad! It does make a lot! I'll be having this in my lunch all week!

I have made this salad a number of times.  I love the leftovers.  I usually wait and add the avocado to the portion I am serving.  It is huge so I half the recipe and have used canned jalapeno peppers and red, orange or yellow peppers according to whats on sale.

Not bad! Although quite yummy, I prefer a similar recipe just a **tad** better.... I've been making a version of this for years. It's called Texas caviar. The main difference between my recipe and this one is two-fold. I substitute black eyed peas for black beans and serve as a dip with tortilla chips, NEVER as a salad (and because mine calls for black eyed peas, I serve it as a New Year's Eve party appetizer!). My recipe also does not call for avocado and yields a MUCH smaller batch (FYI, this feeds a CROWD!!!). I usually add red AND green bell peppers and omit the tomato altogether. By omitting the avocado and tomato, this will keep for days. As is, this is NOT something you'd want to nosh on a day later (the avocado turns brown and the tomatoes turn to mush) . For a fun twist, I served this alongside Mexican lasagna with Cool Ranch flavored Dorito's for scooping (yum!). My neighbor REALLY liked this and asked for the recipe! Thanks for sharing one of my favorites on here, Merle! :-)

I make a big batch of this for lunches almost every other week. Love it! I usually use two cans of black beans and one can of corn (better as a lunch). I don't include the jalapeno peppers or the pimentos, mostly because I don't keep them around. And I often use cucumber instead of green pepper.

Holy  is this good! I literally just made this...I didn't have the avacodo,jalepenos or the cilantro (will add that later today after a trip to the store)...but even without it.  AWESOME.  I left out the onions & pimentos...not a fan of either. I also used canned tomatoes that I rinsed and drained.  No Italian dressing, just fresh garlic chopped.

I have made this recipe so many times and each time there are no leftovers! I have taken it to potlucks, family get-togethers, picnics and everybody goes crazy over this. I do leave out the jalapeno and pimentos and also add an extra avocado (or 2). There is NO way IMO that you can mess this up!

This recipe is just fine as is, but I tailored it a bit to my preferences. Here they are:

- A little less corn to prevent drowning out the other flavors in the recipe.
- Only 1 jalapeno pepper because I wanted something mild.
- Either use a large avocado or two avocados. My small one didn't suffice, but that's b/c I love avocados.
- Way more pimentos. I used 2 out of the 3 whole pimentos from a 12 oz jar and chopped them.
- I ditched the tomatoes out of personal preference. If you use them, use cherry tomatoes to avoid including the watery, gushy innards of big tomatoes that would make this dish runny.

It turned out amazing for me! I like that it's a big batch recipe, so I can store it for a great, healthy, but flavorful lunch throughout the week.

I've made this many many times, and I LOVE it every time, so does everyone I serve it to.  I do make it slightly different tho, with no bell peppers, pimentos & usualy no avocado.  Plus I at-least quadruple the garlic, using minced fresh! YUMMMMM!  Thank you so much for this one!  Definitely on my faves list!

My kindergartner loves this packed in her school lunch.  I leave the jalapenos out of half the batch for the kids and add cumin.

Absolutely great. I love making a huge batch of this (without the pimentos) and chowing down over the next few days. A great side dish, a good light lunch, it's just darned good.

Very good. My whole family loved it. Made 2 batches in one day. I substituted oil and viniger for the italian dressing because of the sugar content in most dressings. I also added 2 cloves of garlic (minced). I used garlic power & Salt because I didnt' have any garlic salt. I left the bell peper out because i didn't have one. Making this again tonight.

Great!  Been looking for a bean salad recipe to prepare ahead of time and eat over a few day period. I'm going to be adding the avocado as needed because of this.

This was a hit this weekend at a Halloween Party! I served it in a purple plastic jack-o-lantern. The only change I made was to add a can of dark kidney beans and a half pack of taco seasoning. Next time will add some shredded cheddar cheese. Good way to add some fiber to the meal.

This is the best black bean salad recipe I have ever made or even tried. I'm obsessed with avocado's so I added more, four times more than the recipe called for! I used this as a side to accompany another recipe. All of my family members enjoyed this. This was crunchy, refreshing and very tasty. I recommend this to anyone.

This recipe is fabulous!  I have made it over and over again and am always asked for the recipe when I make it.  This is a very versatile recipe, looks great, and tastes superb!  It goes great as an appetizer with Frito scoops or pita wedges, also great on its own as a side salad, and fantastic to add in your tortilla with fajitas!  And, it can be used for all three during one gathering.  It has to be a big gathering for me to make it though, because it is very time consuming with all the chopping, dicing, and de-seeding.  I usually leave out the pimentos, because I don't think it adds that much and it is just an extra expense.  However, I must say, this recipe is one of the few that is great as is, no need to tweak (but feel free to and it will still be great)!

Good stuff, used as a side with a veggie burger, trying to be healthy...  I changed a few things. I added 2 cans of beans (small red kidney), only one can of corn, canned pineapple chunks (minus juice) & grape tomatoes (cut in half).  Lime juice is key to this dish.

This is a wonderful combination.  Even if you don't like black beans, leave them in - all the flavors blend and the taste is fantastic.  I added 2 cans of black beans, three avocados and left out the pimentos.  Everyone loved this.

Excellent recipe, although I used 1/2 cup cilantro. I made it for a birthday party where they were serving tacos, nachos, etc this went well with the meal. Everyone complimented it and I gave the recipe to 2 people. Thanks.

Very fresh and delicious, though the title is misleading.  It was more like a fresh salsa than a bean salad.  I would have given it 5 stars, but there was so much chopping involved, it took two of us over half an hour, not just 20 minutes like it says.  The end result was worth it, however.  I used a red onion instead of the green onions and only half a jalapeno.  I also used a fresh red bell pepper instead of pimetos.  I'm going to make huevos rancheros with it for dinner.  Very delicious and will crave this again.

Yum! I increased this recipe..almost double for a picnic. Used equal amounts of beans and corn and 1 1/2 pkg grape tomatoes sliced lengthwise. Instead of green onions I used half a purple onion and several cloves fresh garlic instead of garlic salt. Reduce the amount of cilantro so it doesn't overpower. Plenty of lime juice, a little salt and Wish bone Italian dressing made this salad fresh and addictive! Will make again.

A nice change of pace.  Like others, I only used one can of corn, but two cans of black beans.  Essentially, I threw in whatever veggie sounded good, and at the end of the prep, I discovered I didn't have any italian dressing.  So I used some olive oil and vinegar instead.  Overall, good taste and relatively easy to make with lots of potential for variety.

I'm almost positive I would give this recipe 5 stars IF I would have used FRESH cilantro.  All I had was the dried stuff which doesn't hold a candle to the taste of fresh. Besides that, I loved the flavors in this.  I added chopped celery b/c I wanted to get rid of it in the fridge, and it was okay but didn't quite go well with the other flavors.  I love how healthy this is, though.  It's a good summer sidedish for a barbeque.

I love this recipe.  It is a staple for summer picnics and potlucks.  Everyone loves it and you can make it toally fat free but using fat-free Italian dressing.  Very healthy, colourful and full of flavor.

This is a KEEPER. Delicious. Chopped everything very finely (size of beans) and served it with tortilla chips as a dip. Everyone seemed to love it.

It was almost perfect.  I'm not big on spice so I omitted the jalapenos and peppers.  Everyone still loved it, but I thought maybe a little more spice would have helped.

This dish is delicious, colorful, and so easy!  I used canned jalapenos instead of fresh because I like the extra tanginess.

This salad was very good.  I served it with a mexican meal. I used one package frozen corn instead of canned, red bell pepper, omitted the pimento and used Litehouse brand Balsamic Vinaigrette. YUM!!  Would be great over salad greens with grilled chicken as a meal.

This was extremely good. I made a few minor changes: 2 cans of beans, an orange bell pepper instead of green (for color and flavor), 1 pint of halved grape tomatoes instead of 3 regular, and left out the cilantro (don't like it). I also used an Italian dressing recipe from this site instead of store bought. Was perfect for a potluck, but made a ton and got watery the longer it sat.

MY husband and I don't like pimentos, so I left them out, and this salad was still delicious.  We ate it plain, then as a dip with chips, then even used it as a salsa on our tacos!!  GOOD STUFF!!

The prep time for this is well more than 20 minutes, but you will be very happy w/your results. This is super colorful and very flavorful but nothing is overpowering in it. Makes A TON. I will definitely make again

Have made this twice. 2nd time, I added pasta - also a winner. Thanks for an easy, delicious recipe! For those that want to make half a recipe (small kitchen, small family here), C&W Southwest Blend mix makes a good substitute rather than opening full sized cans.

Easy to make, the jalapeños definitely made it a little spicy! I haven’t added the avocado yet because I didn’t want it to brown before being served. I’ll add that in as it is eaten.

This is my 'go to' salad for soup/salad luncheons, especially when chili is served.  I'm lucky enough to have corn fresh-frozen from the family garden, which is better than canned.  I normally add at least one more avocado, as the dressing keeps the avocado chunks nice and green.  This salad is also great as a dip for corn chip "scoopers", and I think I like it even better that way - the salt from the chip enhances the veggie mixture.  If I were to make this for our small family, I think I would cut everything in half except for the black beans - otherwise, it makes a large amount (although it stores well in the frig).

I made it as instructed but I did add a small can of chick peas and a lessened the dressing by a few tablespoons. I think the problem others had was not thoroughly rinsing and draining the beans.  I also used an Italian seasoning mix and not bottled dressing.

Excellent flavor in this salad! I made it with only a small change...I added a little extra dressing and garlic salt.  But I am already imagining  what other changes I can make to customize this more towards my individual taste. Next time I will add more avacado and omit the Italian dressing. Instead I'll simply use EVOO, lime juice, and salt and pepper! Yum!

I made it with fewer beans (one can) and two avocados.  It was a really big hit at our Fajita night!

We loved this recipe, although, you first need to like all the ingredients. I used red pepper instead of green, regular onion instead of green, frozen corn, grape & regular tomatoes and dried cilantro instead of fresh. Being the end of the season for the garden I had to improvise. The avacado stayed relatively fresh looking despite the sitting there for almost a week while my husband and I finished a rather large batch. It would be a great salad to take to a pot luck.

So easy and delicious. The only change I make is to leave out the avocado. I prefer to serve as a salsa and or a topper for chicken, fish, or lettuce wraps

I absolutely love this recipe.  I needed a salad that would last for a outdoor music festival.  It did take over 20 minutes to prepare with the prep work, however, well worth it.  It was very tasty and well received by everyone.

I really enjoyed this dish.  I was afraid of it being too spicy so I only added one jalapeño.  I wish I had added both because I would have liked a bit more "kick".  But that was a change I made that was my fault.

It is a nice cool side dish for warm weather grilling.

This salad is great with a lot of modifications. If you follow the recipe change beans to three cans. If you are not wanting enough to feed thirty then add one can of beans. Cut all the other ingredients in half.  Skip the pimentos, waste of money there, add some cumin.

I made this for Father's Day.  My son is not a cilantro fan so I reduced that, but everyone really liked it.  I like having the avocado in with the beans and corn.  My husband said he would like me to make this recipe again.

Love this dish!  Made it for our block party this weekend and doubled the recipe--it went fast!

I did halve the amount of jalapeno and cilantro, due to varied tastes in the neighborhood...but otherwise made it as instructed.

Tip:  Make sure your avocados are ripe--they add a creaminess to the salad.

Love this salad! Its super easy to make. I did not add the Italian dressing, I just added lime to taste and instead of jalapeño I added cayenne pepper as I am sensitive to jalapeño. My husband loves it too!

Delicious and healthy. I didn't put the pimentos or the Italian salad dressing because I liked how it was coming out without those. I also used a red bell pepper instead of a green one. My husband, who generally doesn't eat salads, came back for seconds.

Edit: 4 years later and I'm still making this. By far the tastiest salad I've ever had. I put in 2 avocados instead of 1, as it seems to give it a fuller taste. I also cut down to 1-1.5 jalapeno instead of 2 since it was a bit too spicy for my stomach. Still don't put any of the dressing - just veggies. I played around with the proportions, putting in extra tomatos and peppers, but I found the taste is the best with 3 tomatos and 1 pepper as per the recipe. Everyone I've given it to loves it.

Amazingly good, although a bit time consuming to chop everything up. It tasted a little too sweet to me, so I added 1/8 cup white vinegar for some added acid. Rounded it out nicely.

I didn't follow the ingredients and amounts exactly, but it was great!  Please drain and rinse the black beans to avoid a ugly sloppy looking dish. I added purple onions and cut-down on the jalapeños to appease my kids. I also added a little olive oil, used ranch dressing mix instead of Italian and added a little garlic salt and cumin. I highly recommend trying this one.

I made this salad with pork rib supper last night. I made some changes, but only because of family preferences. I am sure the recipe as written is wonderful. We are not fond of cilantro, so I only used a teaspoonful or so of dried cilantro. I drained and rinsed the beans and corn and drained the canned diced tomatoes (did not have fresh). I only used 4 green onions just in case, but more would have been fine. The salad was in no way bland or mushy ~ It was great!

This salad was amazing, my husband told me to remember the recipe for our next gathering which is a great sign.  My daughter asked for 3 servings, she loved it.  It was simple and quick, sweet and had just the right amount of salt. I definitely will make it again.

Very tasty salad...I added fresh mango which gave it another depth of flavor.
For those who were disappointed, perhaps cooking the dry  black beans in chicken bouillon would enhance the flavor more.  Adding the black beans over leafy lettuce tossed in Italian Dressing makes it more of a salad entree.

Made this for a family gathering today. I did follow a lot of other review suggestions. In the end I used 2 cans of black beans rinsed well, 1 can of corn, 1 cup of Trader Joes frozen roasted corn defrosted, 2 cans of diced tomatoes w/chilies, a little over half a red onion diced, zest and juice of 1 lime, 1/2 cup chopped cilantro, about 6 diced red/yellow/orange mini sweet peppers, 1/2 cup of italian dressing and salt and pepper tom taste. I also used a few dashes of Goya Adobo seasoning and some grinds from a tex mex chipotle spice blend. I made it first thing in the morning and let it chill until about 1 pm. We ate it around 2pm with tortilla chips. We grazed it the rest of the day. Everyone seemed to enjoy it. Thanks for posting this recipe. Can't wait until I can try it with grilled chicken or with pasta.

This was wonderful. A nice healthy side dish.
I used canned black beans and did rinse them.
I used fresh corn, not canned.
Instead of jalapeno's, I added hot sauce to taste, just to give it just a bit of a kick. I don't like things too spicy so this was a better way to control how spicy to make it. I used a yellow pepper and I cut off the white part of the green onions. I just used the green part. Make sure to seed the tomatoes or all the tomato "gunk" will ruin the sauce flavoring. I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt.
I used kosher salt. The cilantro is key to this salad. Don't skimp on it. This salad is very colorful and all the people at my party asked me for this recipe. It's a keeper.

Made this probably 2 dozen times.....LOVE IT!!  We don't care for the taste of cilantro, doesn't matter, it's great even without it. I chop up the avocado as needed and serve it separately to add as needed so it doesn't get brown and mushy in the leftovers. I use Good Seasons Italian dressing mix because that's what we always have around.

I've made this receipe several times and I don't even get to chill it. My family instantly starts eating it! Every time I make it, I get several compliments and everyone wants to receipe. The only thing I elimante is the avocado, just because it turns brown.

I have made this recipe several times and it is a favorite of my husband and myself. Didn't use the pimentos or the avocado. I have substituted at times canned tomatoes drained. Also added lots more cilantro as I feel you can never have enough!

For morons like me, please note WEAR GLOVES WHEN YOU CHOP/HANDLE JALAPENOS! Good gracious, I'm still paying for yesterday's mistake. But this salad is amazing and worth the days of pain I will endure. I've already had several people ask me for the recipe.

We liked this a lot.  I didn't use corn, but we didn't miss it.  The little bit of leftovers that there were went into my boyfriend's lunch box to eat with tortilla chips the next day.

Excellent! Even the picky eaters enjoyed it. Since kids were eating it, I only put in 1 jalapeno, but I would have liked it better with 2 or 3 for more heat.

This was a nice side dish, not extraordinary but good enough to make again.  I reduced the oil and added some extra lime juice and salt.  I think I might throw a little mango in next time.

Made this for a pot luck dinner and it was gone ASAP !  Easy to make which was great too.  I happen not to have lime in the house so I used a couple of tablespoons of frozen limeade...no complaints but will make sure I have a lime next time   :)   Thanks for the recipe !!

What a great salad!  Used fat-free Italian dressing and frozen corn.  My husband doesn't like cilantro or avocado so only put that in mine.  He also likes it hotter than I do so added another jalapeno with seeds to his.  Perfect for both of us with these additions.  Will definitely make again.

I love this recipe, and always make it to bring to bbqs...everyone loves it. To be honest though, I usually leave out the onions, jalapenos, pimentos & cilantro. I think it has plenty of flavor without! Also, I usually use light italian dressing, and it doesn't seem to lose any flavor.

This is very good but there's a lot of chopping involved. Make sure the cilantro is chopped very fine. If not, it has a really strong flavour. I used only one pepper and replaced the pimento with a red pepper as someone else suggested.

This is one awesome recipe!  I have made this one repeatedly making minor changes to fit what my family prefers (more avocados, less bell peppers, etc).  You truly cannot mess this one up.  I even received a special request for Christmas Eve for this! I even took it to a Scout campout over the weekend and it was still wonderful! I just threw it in a ziploc bag over ice! Everytime I make this someone wants the recipe - usually more than one person!  Thanks for posting such a hit, I owe you a lot!

This was delicious! Like others I halved this recipe as there were only two of us.  Also- i halved the amount of cilantro and salad dressing.  It was perfect! We ate it both as a salad and also used chips! Delicious and light tasting!

Not bad at all. The only change I made was to us regular onions instead of green as that's what I had. This wasn't a particularly attractive dish, but it was quick, easy and tasty. Thanks!

Sooooo good!  Didn't add pimentos, but kept everything else the same.  Served with chicken enchiladas II (from this site) could not quit eating it with chips.  We all so enjoyed it.  Will make all the time now!

I served this as a side with grilled, lime/cilantro brushed chicken breasts and saffron yellow rice at home and at the firehouse. It was a big hit in both places.

I did like this, but tweaked it a bit (adding more avocado and the juice of two limes in the place of the italian dressing).  It seemed a bit sweet for me, so next time I'll grill some fresh corn on the cob to use in this recipe.  It has a quite unique flavor.....will surely make again! UPDATE: Just ate this like a salsa with tortilla chips --AWESOME!

i am giving this a 4 star rating because, well, I just did not like it. It must be me, since everybody else likes it. Maybe I am not a bean person?

I love this recipe!  You can just about throw anything into it.  I threw in a can of garbanzo beans, some shredded mexican cheese, taco seasoning, and some chunks of cooked chicken.  I served it as filling for burritos, it was so healthy and colorful, everybody loved it!

Very different. The color is great and it is good served over lettuce. A little tangy from the dressing. I reduced the amount, per other reviews. It tasted good while eating it, but it is just very different than what my family is used to. Probably won't be making again.
