I hate to say it, but no on really liked this. It really needed something like garlic salt. Too much parsley and minced garlic.

This was so goooood. I bought a bag of already sliced french bread for .79!! So I just melted the butter added the other ingredients except for the cheese and topped each slice with some of the melted butter and then some shredded cheese. Great flavor.

Incredible.  I made this for a dinner party and it was the first thing gone.  Since then I've made it three or four more times with the same results.  Make sure to cook it all the way though.

Have to say, very easy to do, has a lot of good flavor, but only gave it 4 stars because family who usually devours garlic bread, only had one piece each, with the exception of my teenage son who ate two because he was still hungry, but said it was just ok, but I like it.

Really yummy! I made it exactly as described. A nice change and easy right on the grill. I had a big French Bread loaf and figured it would be way too much. It was worth grilling it all!

I made this for my mother in law and picky wife.  They both loved it.  Instead of minced garlic and garlic powder, I roasted garlic and mixed it in. YUM!!!

Love this! Personally I think the leftovers are even better the next day.
