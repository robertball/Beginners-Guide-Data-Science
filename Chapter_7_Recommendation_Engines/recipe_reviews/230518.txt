Only problem I had with these is it says bring to a boil. I went with a to long of a boil I guess cause they came out harder then chewy. These was still good an I barely had time to steal a couple for the picture. The only thing was I wish it had more coating and was chewy. Next time I plan on doubling the sauce an not cooking it as long make them a bit chewier.

I made these to use up some cereal and my family loved these bars!  Even my granddaughter, who hates peanuts, has requested an encore.  Thanks for sharing!!

I'm going to buck the trend here and only give 4 stars.  These are a bit on the crumbly side and as the recipe is written they are a little ... plain.  Adding in something else - chocolate chips or m&ms - really adds a pop of interest.  Changing up the corn flakes for something a bit more interesting and changing nuts to slivered almonds also adds a different element.  If I were to  do these again I would not double the 'sauce' but I would increase it by half to make this hold together better.

These are a favourite in our house. My kids don't eat much cereal so I always use it for making these squares. I add an extra cup of combined nuts, sunflower seeds and pumpkin seeds to them. They are delicious and so much better than regular granola bars from the store.

Sooo easy! You can put just about any nut, dried fruit, chocolate chip combination you want in it. First time I followed recipe to a tee... delicious. Second time, I put a large bag of trail mix in... again, delicious. Now I've gotten to where I put whatever strikes my fancy (or whatever I've got on hand) in there... not one complaint yet! Next time I think I'll try miniature marshmallows, pecans and chocolate chips...

found them a little too sweet. I plan to make them again with less sweetener.

So good and so easy.  You really can personalize this quite a bit - add chocolate chips, or pretzels, or use almonds instead of peanuts, or other nuts - really good!

I used honey bunches of oats with almonds instead of the corn flake cereal, and omitted the nuts.  I added some M&Ms as well! Yum!!

Great alternative to store bought bars. I added 5 cups of cereal each and cashews not peanuts.(the first time I made them they were a little rich) Delicious!

This was yummy! I didn't have any Cheerios so I used all corn flakes, or 6 cups. I increased the peanut butter to 1 cup and added 1/2 pkg. of miniature marshmallows (5 oz. or half of a 10 oz package), and threw in 3/4 cup of Reeces pieces. You could also use milk or semi-sweet chocolate chips, peanut butter chips, M & Ms, or coconut. I also had about 1/2 cup of pretzels (the skinny stick kind), so I added that to the cereal/peanut/marshmallow/Reeces pieces bowl. Dry-roasted peanuts would add an interesting flavor. This makes a full 9 x 13" pan. Would be great to take to a Super Bowl Party. Go Chiefs!

Very good recipe. I like that you can change out ingredients for different flavor combinations. It is oh so sweet, maybe too sweet.

These taste amazing! But when I made it I let it cool in the fridge for 2 hours and they still wonâ€™t hold shape. They just fall apart and are sticky. What went wrong?
