Never having cooked grits before, I was looking for a good, basic recipe to start with.  This was exactly what I was looking for.  Very easy to make, nice flavor, although I did omit the cooking sherry (didn't have any on hand).  I definitely recommend this recipe for anyone wanting a good foundation recipe for cheesy grits.  I will use it again and perhaps change it up with different cheeses, etc.
