I baked two King Cakes for Mardi Gras this year. One was from this recipe. People thought they were from a bakery (first plus), but people absolutely raved about this one. One coworker told me this was the best cake she had ever eaten. I will definitely make this again. It's so convenient, too, to be able to make the dough in a bread machine. Thanks for a keeper!

Living near New Orleans and having access to so many bakeries with King Cake, I have to say this just isn't quite right.  I would cut the icing in half to begin with.  There was too much, making the cake too sweet.  But something was missing in the cake flavor itself.  While my daughter did like it better than the local grocery store's King Cake and my family did eat it without any problem, I'll look elsewhere for that "great" King Cake recipe.

OK, while I must agree with reviewers who detest people who rate after totally changing a recipe I do understand the reasons folks do this. You may follow most  of a recipe, but want to share your own adaptions. That being said...

This recipe is to die for!! I made the dough as written, with the exception of 1 tsp nutmeg added.  It is flexible and a dream to work with. Rises beautifully.

I wanted to use both the cinnamon filling as listed and the cream cheese filling of the  "King Cake" also on this site, so that is what I did. (8oz softened cream cheese, 1/2 c gran. sugar and 1/4 c 10X sugar)....blended this and spread first.  

Then followed directions for the cinnamon sugar filling from this recipe (doubling it) And I added 1 cup chopped pecans.

I placed a greased bowl in center of my circle to hold the shape, definitely needed to as cake rose spectacularly and would have been solid.

I made my own frosting/glaze and used the traditional Mardi Gras colors of decorating sugars.

The cake is sweet, moist and delightful! Both fillings are Not a necessity...but a decadent treat!

I am adding 5 photos of the stages of building this cake! Definitely will make again and again!

This was my first time using a bread machine and the result was fantastic!  I doubled the amount of filling and substituted brown sugar instead of white sugar (for the filling only), but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and it came out fabulously!

I brought this to a Carnival brunch today and it was a big hit! This recipe was so easy and tasted great! The only changes I made were to the filling.  I mixed 8 oz of cream cheese with 1/2 c. of brown sugar, and it turned out really well.  Powdered sugar would probably be great too, but I didn't have enough after making the glaze.  Any type of fruit pie filling or chocolate is also really good.  For the glaze on top of the cake, I added another 1/2 cup of powdered sugar to make it really thick so it wouldn't all run off the cake and pool up on the sides.  Overall, I'd say this recipe is a keeper!

I have made this cake twice so far. Everyone I have shared it with, absolutely loved it. Some even thought it was better than a bakery King Cake. Making another one tonight, can't wait! Thank you for such an easy and delicious recipe!

OUTSTANDING!  I wish I could give it more than 5 stars!!  I had never made a King cake before.  This was so easy using the bread machine.  I was amazed at the ease of handling the dough once it was done.  I replaced the chopped pecans with raisins I had plumped and doubled the filling mixture.  I baked it on a pizza pan so it would be nice and round.  I was afraid I didn't butter the pan enough but it slid right off onto the cooling rack which I covered with parchment paper so I could drizzle the icing and sugar without too much mess.  It was so easy to make but the taste was OUTSTANDING!  I told Hubby I will have to make this every year and he informed me that I can make it all year long, he doesn't want to wait a year.  Thank you Suzzanna for sharing another OUTSTANDING recipe!

PERFECT! This was so fun and easy to make, that I can't believe that I waited this long to try it. The only thing I did differently was to double the filling (I like LOTS) and use brown sugar in the filling instead of white (I was running low). The dough was a dream to work with...it rolled out beautifully. This smelled amazing while baking and tasted even better. This will be a new yearly tradition for us! Thanks for sharing. :)

Made it for a Mardi Gras Parade party. Got excellent  and delicious comments from all attendees who ate a piece.  Followed the pasrty directions as written.  My filling was different.  Did 8 ounces softened cream cheese, 1/2 cup confectioners sugar and 1/2 cup chopped pecans.  Mixed all well together and placed it as the king cake filling.   Still good the day after too!!!  
This is my first king cake and it was easy to make.

the dough for this is flawless and easy. I didn't change anything except the nuts and the technique of shaping it. (I've never seen nuts in king cake unless it was praline filling.) 
for the shaping, I rolled it out, cut two long strips, and spread the cinnamon paste on one strip, and put cream cheese frosting on the other. rolled each into a tube and pressed them closed, then twisted them together like a braid and joined the ends. I also made my own colored sugar instead of buying it. just add a couple drops of food coloring to white sugar and shake up in a small container. easy! my boyfriend doesn't really like king cake and he was in the kitchen making sex noises over this. hands-down this is the most decadent and delicious king cake I've ever had. Will make again!!

This bread came out perfectly. I used other reviewers' advice and baked for 25 minutes, reducing heat for last 10 minutes to 350. Also made a chocolate filling with heaping 1/2 cup chocolate chips melted with 2 T butter, and added 1t cinnamon, 1/4 cup brown sugar and 8 oz cream cheese. 
The only problem I had was the filling gooped out a little in a couple places while baking. I think this may be because I didn't seal the seam carefully. It was my first time making king cake though so I chalk that up to beginner's mistake. 
Thank you for this wonderful recipe. I am a Virginia native who has lived in Louisiana for the last 15 years. This is a very authentic tasting king cake.. You know it is success when your daughter ( who has lived in Louisiana since she was 2 months old) says "wow Mom-- you made this?"

Good base recipe. Very easy. However, I agree, it was missing something. Next time I'll add 1-teaspoon nutmeg and 1 t-teaspoon lemon zest to the batter when making it.

Made this today for Mardi Gras and it was excellent!   The only change I made was to the filling in which I used 8 oz softened cream cheese, 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1 tsp cinnamon.  I cooked at 350 for 25-30 minutes as several people said theirs was doughy in the middle.  It came out perfect.   Everyone LOVED it!

This is the easiest, most wonderful tasting sweet bread "cake" I have made.  Putting everything in the bread machine and letting it do all the work could not have been better.  Baked on a stone in the oven was the finishing touch.  I won't wait for Lundi Gras to make this one again.

Very moist.  Alot better than the dried out ones I have gotten from the supermarket.  Using the bread machine to mix the dough makes the preparation very easy.

I made the recipe exactly as stated and it came out beautifully! It was delicious and the hit of my Mardi Gras party! Everyone was so impressed and all I had to do was dump some ingredients in my machine and then shape it. Easy peazy!

My only suggestion for anyone making this cake is to do the glaze in phases so the sugar has a better chance of sticking. I piped about half the Glaze at the beginning and few places were dried by the time I got back to put sugar on it. Once I figured it out, I just did a section at a time and had no problems.

I made this for a Mardi Gras pot luck and it was a big hit!  Of course, we're all from the northwest part of the country so no one knew if it was an authentic king cake or not.  I'm going to use the same recipe to make cinnamon rolls for Sunday breakfast.  Delicious!

This recipe was flawless for me!!!  It came out so beautiful; rose up just perfectly in the bread machine and the dough was wonderful to work with.  Thanks for a super-festive and tasty recipe that my whole family loved.  (I've had king cake in the past and this was the yummiest I've ever tried!)

PERFECT. Capital EVERY LETTER. I was first introduced to King Cake at my "Harvard of the South" university, and have spent years trying to find a decent substitute. I need look no further - this is it! I double the filling because my family LOVES it super cinnamon-y, but that is ALL I would ever change about this recipe. This dough has NEVER failed on me, it alway rises beautifully and has a very light, soft crumb. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

Made this cake for our MardiGra party at cc class at church today. What a great cake it was......I think it was the only dessert that was completely gone! I don't have a bread machine..(so I converted it ).but like the recipe, so I made the cake using my mixer, I followed the directions for the Yeast Mixture, Let it sit while I mixed all the wet ingredients in my mixer, then added the yeast mixture to that and added the dry ingredients and mixed it with the hook beater.   Came out beautiful and easy. I used a cheese filling ,(I googled "Cream cheese filling recipe" and a site came up for Entenmann's copycat recipes" The cheese filling from that site was creamy and tasted just like the the filling in Entenmann's Crumbcake/strudle   it was perfect for this King cake. All the other filling recipes had flour added....yuck. I also rolled out the dough into a 8x30 " rectangle...Filled it,.. .make sure you seal it ...then rolled it jelly roll style , sealed it with water, shaped it into a circle ... this way you have cheese filling in every bite. Thank you for this wonderful, Incrediable and "OH, So Good"" recipe.

Love love love this recipe.  It's hard to find a King Cake where I live, especially one that's any good so I was thrilled when I came across this one last night.  I decreased the amount of sourcream by about 1/4 of a cup.  I increased the amount of butter that you brush the inside with before you add your filling.  I also added brown sugar to the white sugar and cinnamon mixture to make it more like a cinnamon roll.  I used to make hundreds of King Cakes when I worked in a bakery in Mississippi and I actually prefer this recipe over the one we used!  So good!

This cake was awesome--so tasty...however, I didn't follow the recipe to the letter.  As the norm for me, I sort of made a few twists of my own.  First of all, as another reviewer mentioned it was pretty sour, I halved the sour cream and added 1/2 C milk in substitute.  I also added 1/2 tsp nutmeg in the dough and did half currants and half raisins in the filling.  I also baked it for 25 min because 15 didn't seem long enough and it was great.  So definitely not exactly but pretty close and it was so good, I will be making this again!

Turned out great! The dough was really easy to work with.  I will use a little less sour cream or a little extra sugar next time. The dough was a little too sour for my taste.

Wow!  This is the best yeast dough baked good I have EVER made!  I followed the recipe for the dough exactly.  I filled half with cinnamon, brown sugar, butter and nuts and the other half with a mixture of cream cheese and powdered sugar, rolled it up, formed a ring, let it rise for an hour and baked it for 20 minutes.  Absolutely delicious!

It's really just a big cinnamon roll! I doubled filling and used half brown sugar. I omitted pecans. My husband said this cake was awesome. All I will do different next year is instead of using colored sugars I will just divide the icing and use food color (natural brand) because I didn't like all the crunch.

Great recipe! I am from New Orleans but have lived overseas for the last 9 years and around Mardi Gras time I always get homesick. I make a King Cake every Kings Day, using my breadmaker, and this one is by far the best. I have made it twice in the past two days. I did do a couple things different. The first time I made it, I accidentally put the pecans in with the filling mix and then spread the entire thing on the dough instead of only spreading the butter/sugar mix and then adding pecans. It was a bit harder to spread and I ended up having to double the butter, but the result was great. The filling tasted like a slightly crunchy praline filling. Definitely worth a try. The second time I made it, I doubled the filling mix and then spread the butter/sugar mix over the dough and then sprinkled on the pecans. The pecans baked up softer this time. Both ways are excellent, it depends on your mood. The measurements were spot on for me, with the exception of doubling the filling. The only difference I had is that I found I needed to bake the cake for about 40 minutes both times, it might just be my oven though. Either way, great recipe!

Oh my goodness!! This cake is divine!!  I made it for Fat Tuesday and my husband, children, and I all loved it!! I made it exactly as directed, but had to cook mine about 25 minutes to get it done. Next time I will omit the nuts (I only put them on half this time and we all agreed the side without was our favorite).  Also, I will double the cinnamon/sugar in the middle just because a couple of bites were without.  But this is a definite keeper! Thank you for sharing!!

This was my first try at a King Cake, I was a bit intimidated but I agreed to make it for a party later tonight.  It was amazingly easy and delicious.  So now, having gobbled my first cake, I plan to turn out another for the party. Well, I did have to taste-test the first one!! Only change I'd make is adding more filling and baking more slowly.  .

Great Recipe! I have never had King cake before and don't have success with yeast breads and cakes (my kitchen must be cold). I tried this recipe hoping the bread maker would increase my chance of success. I made it exactly according to the recipe and it was delicious. The dough did not rise to twice the size even with an added space heater in my kitchen. It still turned out fantastic. My husband has had King cake before and was very impressed with this recipe. 

Like other reviewers, next time I will add more filling and play around with other filling ingredients. Don't just wait for Mardi Gras. This is a great cake anytime!

Easy Receipe to follow. Would have given it 5 stars but I think the baking time should be increased. I guess depending on your oven, but I increased time to 25 min and also doubled filling like others did. But I will make again and try other fillings.

Wonderful! The dough was so easy to put together and quick & easy to roll out. Absolutely delicious tasting! I followed others recommendations to double the filling and use brown rather than white sugar. I can't wait to make this again!

My photo of this does not do this recipe justice at all.  This is one of my all time favorite cakes!  It is like one giant cinnamon roll with gobs of gooey frosting and sugar on top.  It's a good thing I only plan on making this once a year because I couldn't keep myself from eating it.  The only problem (and it didn't keep me away) was that the cake was a little undercooked in the middle.  I baked for 17 minutes, and it was golden brown, but the middle was still gooey when I cut into it.  Didn't bother me a bit, I actually prefer my cinnamon rolls on the gooey side.  My kids loved the striped sugar and except for the two "picture pieces", the rest of the cake was picked and grabbed at and eaten up fast!

So simple but has great flavor and texture.   I do not recommend cream cheese or fruit filling because I think it affects the texture a bit.   Lovely dough and very easy to work with.  Mine took an extra ten minutes in the oven but maybe that's because i used wetter fillings which i will not do again.  I highly recommend this recipe.

I made monkey bread using this recipe.  It was the best ever.  Exactly the dough I was looking for, light moist and wonderfully tasty.  Added a little cinnamon to the dough and then just made monkey bread as usual.   I am going to try it for cinnamon rolls also.

I made this recipe just as it was written. It was WONDERFUL!  My family ate the whole things in 2 days. I'm making this again. Oh soo good! I put the baby on top after cooking in the icing. I might try and make this for Christmas and form candy canes with red and green colored sugar sprinkles!!

Tried this tonight with excellent results!  I lived in the New Orleans area for many years and was thinking that there was no way this would taste like the "real deal," but it did!  My entire family (used to eating a Gambino's king cake for which I usually pay a fortune to have shipped to NYC!) thought it was delicious.  Only thing I did differently was substitute plain greek yogurt for some of the sour cream, simply because I didn't have enough sour cream on hand.

This was my first attempt at making my own King Cake!  I was very impressed by the ease and outcome!  I am from New Orleans, but now live in Virginia.  I do not want to pay a fortune to have a king cake shipped to me so I asked friends back home for a good recipe...this one was shared and I'm so glad!  I used a tad more sugar in the dough than it called for, and I used greek vanilla yogurt instead of sour cream.  It was really good.  I made it last night and it's already almost gone!  And there's only 3 of us in the house!  I'll make this again!  I think it would be really good with a cream cheese spread inside as well.  Oh also, I did not use the nuts in the cinnamon mixture..my hubby is not a fan of nuts.

I made this cake for the first time last night.  I brushed the dough with 1 beaten egg mixed with 1 T of water before baking, like I do my hot cross buns.  One receipe said to bake it for30 minutes, this one said 15 min., so I left it in for 20.  I think it was a little doughy, so next time I will bake longer and maybe stick to the filling as suggested in the recipe.  I followed others' advice and did the cream cheese/brown sugar/cinnamon/pecan filling and thought it was too sweet, especially with the icing on top.  So next time I will do without cream cheese in the filling and bake longer.  The bread machine made this very easy to do.

This is my family's second year to use this recipe.  This year we are raffling 2 off for charity.  The recipe is so easy and foolproof.  We do like more substantial filling so we use streusel topping (also found on allrecipes.com) inside instead.  It makes a pretty presentation when sliced to see all that yummy pecan filling!  Our icing uses sweetened condensed milk so it is creamier than the regular powedered sugar and milk version.  C'est magnifique!

First of all, what a GREAT idea!  King cake in a bread machine...super easy!  I made mine for Samhain, so I did traditional fall colors instead.  I also filled mine with apple pie filling.

I gave the recipe four stars in spite of a problem, because I didn't follow the recipe exactly and possibly caused the problem I had with it.  It was horribly under-baked.  The outside looked nice and golden brown but the inside was doughy. 

I will definitely try this again, baking it at a lower temperature and for longer. I will also come back and give this recipe five stars if it turns out well the next time.

Delicious!!!  I've been using this recipe for a couple of years.  It is so convenient to have the bread machine do the majority of the work.  Always gets rave reviews from family and friends.  I follow the recipe exactly as written for the dough.  It is such amazing dough.  So easy to work with and have never had a problem with the rise.  I DO double the sugar/butter/cinnamon filling.  Make sure you spread it all the way to the short ends so that you don't get a "dead" spot with no filling in your cake where the ends of the roll come together.  I put a ramekin in the middle (greased)  of my tray (lined with parchment, no need to grease) so that the cake doesn't come together in the middle.  Bake at 375 a little longer than recommended, about 22 min.  Our sitter is from NOLA and says it is the best King Cake he's ever had.

What a it! I made this for a Mardi Gras party and everyone loved it! I loved the fact that you started the dough  in the bread machine.  Not sure if it made any difference but I warmed up the water, butter, and sour cream together before putting it into the bread maker. Definitely will be making this again! One thing I did change was double the cinnamon, sugar, and butter. It’s seemed to cover the dough better.

This was really tasty!  I made it exactly as is.  I would make this again for a breakfast treat probably leaving off the top sugar (it's a little too sweet for my taste).

This review is only for the dough, because I adjusted the filling based on some of the other reviews. The dough came out perfectly - smooth, not super sticky, and rolled really well. It also puffs up a quite a bit which leads to the next portion of my review.

For a 5 star king cake I would recommend a) adding a cream cheese filling to the cinnamon sugar; b) doubling the cinnamon sugar (the dough swells to amazing proportions and really needs more filling); and c) placing a greased bowl in the center of your ring to prevent the dough rising and filling. 

Important notes: make sure your seam is very tight, especially after the rising process. Also make sure you roll your dough without any holes - there was a bit of delicious spillage from tiny air bubbles I did not know existed from my lazy rolling. I would also recommend using parchment paper rather than a greased pan. It made cleanup a snap.

This recipe is wonder except for the cooking time and temp. I stuffed my cake with cream cheese mixture and the middle was not quite done. I suggest to reduce temp to 350 degrees and cook  for about 30 minutes.

I made this recipe for my grandsons. The dough was nice and very easy to work with.  I needed to bake the King Cake the day after the dough was prepared so I mixed it in my bread machine, put the dough in a oiled and covered bowl and refrigerated it overnight until time to bake on Tuesday afternoon.  The dough was smooth and easy to roll out.  I did use brown sugar instead of white sugar for the cinnamon sugar mixture because I prefer the taste of the brown sugar.  I also smeared some butter over the dough before adding the filling mixture. Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written. Because the dough was chilled overnight, the rise time was much longer.  I placed it in a slightly preheated oven, covered with tea towel, until it doubled in size--about 2 hours.  I baked it as suggested for 15 minutes, but the internal temperature was not 200F as is recommended for egg enriched dough, so I had to reduce the temperature and bake it for about 10 minutes more.  Next time I'll start it at 350 and bake for 30+ minutes or until golden brown and internal temperature is 200F.  Also, next time I'll probably divide the dough to make two smaller cakes instead of one large size and freeze one loaf as the baked bread isn't the best the second day. I found the little babies at Michel's in the floral section with shower decorations.  Hid the baby after bread cooled by cutting a slit in the side of the dough.  Then, iced and sprinkled with colored sugar. We all enjoyed it.

This cake is amazing! I've had several King cakes from a variety of bakeries, from LA to my local HEB. What I have found is that MOST of them are good in their own way but they're all different. Whether it be the dough or the filling. This cake has a great dough that is easily prepared in the bread machine. Yay! The filling is just one of many variations. I personally prefer a cinnamon/brown sugar/pecan filling. In fact, I want to share my version of my second cake from this recipe. I split the dough in half, used a cream cheese/confectioner's sugar filling on one half, and the cinnamon/brown sugar/pecan filling on the other half. I then twisted the two together and formed the ring. Wow! it was such a hit that my friends are trying to place orders for it! I'm a risk analyst, not a professional baker so I give all credit to this recipe. Thank You!

Super easy and scrumptious!!  I used creme fraiche instead of sour cream just because I had it in the fridge already.  Also I didn't add the pecans because of a guest who is allergic to nuts.  After I rolled out the dough, I cut it in half and made two smaller cakes. I put the cinnamon sugar on one and then a creme fraiche and cranberry pie filling mix (probably about 2T of each) in the other.  They are both awesome.  I'll be making this again asap and every carnival season from now on.

This was great! Very similar to king cake from New Orleans that I have had! Got rave reviews from others who also "know" what a king cake is typically like. Dough was super easy to work with and roll. Rose well, bake time of 15 min was spot on. Minor changes were I used Greek yogurt because I didn't have sour cream, and I also whipped additional cream cheese, sugar, and cinnamon filling to go with the filling printed here in this recipe because I like both fillings. Tasty, light, authentic. People loved it and I am proud of my first king cake.

Excellent! Very easy!  Pretty much followed recipe exactly.  Just used 1/2 Cup brown sugar for filling and left out the butter in icing and also, didn't sprinkle sugar on top. It is like a cinnamon roll.  Very yummy!  Will be making again.
