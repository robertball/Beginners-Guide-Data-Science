A very simple recipe for something that tastes SOOOO good! I usually did my roasts in the oven, and they usually came out a bit dry so I was anxious to try this recipe. And I'm glad I did! The meat came out tender and juicy, and the gravy was delicious! I added the carrots in early (as per another review) and also added in potatoes. I have to say that this recipe was alot less labour intensive as my usual roasts, and I intend to make my roasts this way from now on! :)

While the given recipe is sufficient you could just add the carrots from the beginning after you turn the heat to low. If you wait an hour after the roast has marinated then the carrots aren't as tender as they should be. The roast was amazing!  I made twixe baked potatoes and green beans to complete the dish. Your drink of choice is up to you but we're not big drinkers and shared a glass each of milk and ice tea.

This recipe is delicious. It was very easy for a beginner cook like myself. I also used to cook my roasts in the oven. My family thought the roast was so tender and loved it this way. I will be using this recipe more often. I also adjusted the recipe and added the carrots and potatoes after turning it down to low. The meat and vegetables were cooked to perfection and done at the same time.

Very easy to make and tasty.  I gave this 4 stars because it was too salty for my salt loving taste buds.  Very beefy...makes good left overs over rice or with bread.
