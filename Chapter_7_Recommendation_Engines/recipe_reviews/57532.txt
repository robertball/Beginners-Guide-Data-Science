Abby’s dish is just outstanding. We cooked it up because it made sense to use a cheese coating instead of breading to keep the dish moist. And in fact it worked beautifully. Do use fresh grated cheese, though. If you use a Kraft type product this dish will disappoint. We were concerned about the low temp of 325 but it keeps the dish moist and genuinely tender. You need to use a baking dish that’s big enough to put the rather bulky rolled portions in, though. You have to leave good room between them so the heat circulates properly. Otherwise the touching sides don’t leave the pink state. And you know those small portions of chicken that are found on the inside of the breast, sometimes called, “chicken fillet”? They cook up just as well using the cheese as your “breading” at this low temp, at the same time you cook the “real” dish…they are a delightful snack, too. A final touch you might consider is a few minutes of high heat broiling. It’s nice to get the top layer of prosciutto all the way to crisp. It’ll probably crisp up before you can really brown this dish though…so watch for that. Otherwise we highly recommend this dish, it’s terrific.

Love this!  I've made it twice and the second time perfected it, I think. After pounding the breasts, I cut them in half to make eight smaller rollatinis. Like another poster recommended, I covered them with foil for the first 30 min, then removed foil and baked another 8-10.  The Penne Russo a la Vodka recipe on allrecipes is excellent with this.  I served the vodka sauce over the chicken and over a side of pasta.  It's a fantastic pairing!  Definitely estaurant quality.

This recipe was fantastic!!! If you rate this anything but 5 stars then you've done something wrong and try it again! If you used Parmesan cheese other than fresh dont bother to rate this recipe as I'm sure it would be bland, dull and tasteless. Kraft makes a "grate-it-fresh" Parmesan that comes with a container and can be found next to the shredded and blocks of chesses in most markets. Its easy, less expensive and VERY good cheese. I did alter it slightly for ease of cooking though did nothing to change the flavor.I use the garlic that is preminced in a jar (I always keep it on hand in the fidge) it's not as strong of a garlic taste (though I love garlic) so I sprinkled it with garlic powder before adding the cheese and procuitto. I also used a little less cheese because I bought the slices. I had the procuitto sliced VERY thin so I was able to roll 2 slices inside and then wrap 2 around the outside so I didnt need to use a tooth pick. The effect was delish, the procuitto browned and was somewhat crunchy like bacon would be! YUM The wine and oil gave it a nice subtle flavor. But remove the chicken to a serving plate as the pan is only meant for it to be COOKED in!

I am NOT a chicken fan. It's usually too bland no matter what recipe or variation I use. HOWEVER, this recipe is absolutely delicious!!! Just the smell of it in the oven clued me in that this dish was a keeper!!! I followed the recipe EXACTLY, rolled up the chicken and was done preparing it in about 10 minutes flat. My husband is picky and doesn't really like chicken either, but he ate every last piece and asked when we could have it again. I will make this a staple. The flavors blended perfectly and tasted like a dish I might order out to dinner. THANKS FOR THE AWESOME RECIPE!

This is a great and east recipe.  I added some fresh basil leaves to the roll on top of the cheese.  I also browned the rolls in a skillet with a little olive oil before putting them in the oven.  I did not use the prosciutto on the outside.  I did not want to overpower the flavor of the chicken.  After baking I took the wine mixture which I added a little chicken stock and fresh minced garlic and shallot to, and reduced it on the stove top by half.  I added some heavy cream and reduced to a consistency able to coat the back of a spoon.  I removed from the heat and added a T of butter to finish.  It was a great sauce to compliment the flavors in the chicken.  I served it with some traditional risotto.  My boyfriend loved it!

I think this recipe has potential.  I didn't like the raw garlic in the middle of the breast I think it needed to be cooked first or maybe add a little garlic salt to the parmesan before you roll. Another thing I didn't like was when I removed the chicken from the oven,  the oil and wine separated and it wasn't appealing to see your dinner sitting in a puddle of oil.  Oh yeah,  I think the chicken definitely needs to be browned before you put in the oven.

Out of all of the chicken recipes on AllRecipes.com, this is our favorite!  My husband raved about how good this was.  Usually, when I ask how a recipe is, he will say it is "alright."  But he said this one was great !  I substitued ham for the proscuitto, and used a little less than was called for, and I had some provolone to use up, so I used half provolone and half mozzarella.  I made this dish when company was over and served it with a chicken flavored rice mix and broccoli with hollandaise sauce.  I will definitely make this again!

Excellent recipe.  The only thing i did differently was pepper each side of the chicken with coarse black pepper and add mushrooms to the pan when baking.  Absolutely delicious!

I just served this to my family tonight and have to tell you, it is one of the most fantastic, tasty, and easiest chicken dishes I have ever made! I used the thin sliced boneless chicken breasts instead of pounding out regular boneless chicken breasts and think this helped also with rolling because the chicken was so nice and thin. Thank's Kris for such a wonderful dish! My entire family raved about it!

Great dish! My wife does not like prosciutto so I substituted Boarshead sweet ham (thin sliced)for it. I drizzled the wine/olive oil sauce over the chicken before serving......... this is a keeper. We had it with acorn squash covered in brown sugar,nutmag and butter, with a side of peaches.

I made this dish for my family and it came out great. Even the kids ages 2, 4, 4, & 10 loved it! I followed the recipe as is with a few adjustments. The first being that I didn't use toothpicks to hold the rolled chicken together, but rather once I rolled them I pan seared the bottom and top of the chicken in a very little EVOO & butter before putting the slice of prosciutto ontop and into the baking dish. I also as suggested by another review, broiled the chicken for 5-10mins on HI to crisp up the prosciutto. I made a white wine butter sauce to put ontop of the chicken after I plated the dish. I will put up a recipe fpr the sauce.

This dish was just OK for me.  I would suggest using more prosciutto in the center of each chicken breast as that was really tasty!  I would also use the triangular blocks of parmesan cheese for better flavor.  The wine/oil combination "popped" as it heated in the oven, so maybe cover with aluminum foil and bake a little longer.  Overall, I'd be willing to try this recipe again.

I did not have any toothpicks so I could not roll them. So, I just folded the chicken breast in half and made it like a stuffed chicken. Turned out great!

Yep. Delicious!  I seared the chicken first, then added the wine. Tossed in some sliced mushrooms, shallots and added cream right at the end for a tasty sauce.    Yum!

Really great. Seasoned the meat a bit before I filled and rolled them and added a small piece of mozarrela to the top as well. I added a little pesto to mine and my hubbys but left the kids without.

Really good and easy!  I didn't pound the breasts I butterflied them and then rolled them up top to bottom.  I used jarred minced garlic with italian spices, about 1/2 tsp spread over each breast (not as strong as fresh).  Provolone instead of mozz, will try it with the fresh mozz next time for sure...and sherry instead of white wine.  SO good!

I made this for dinner tonight and it has potential to be a fabulous dinner.  The raw garlic is a bit much, the wine and oil separate so it is very unappetizing to look at and it needs more of the prochutto. The ingredients go well together it just needs less of some and more of the other, very bland with the taste of garlic over powering all the other ingredients

It's a family favorite.  We make it once a week.  I bake the asparagus at 350 for 1/2 hour first (on a cookie sheet with foil lightly oiled) and I coat the breasts with parmesan cheese (just like you would coat a chicken cutlet with bread crumbs).  We use fresh mozzarella, lots and lots of it and no prosciutto (very expensive and it wasn't missed).  Thank's Kim for sharing such a great recipe!  Very low carb, excellent for Atkins

You can not skimp on the quality of cheese! With the cost of prosciutto and mozzerella, this dish is kind of price-y! But rich in flavor, and very easy to cook!

I used the prociutto/mozzerella rolls that you can sometimes find in the cheese section and cut them up into pices to stuff the chicken.  I also salted and peppered the chicken breasts before stuffing. This dish has really good flavor and my family liked it a lot.  For those reviewers who didn't like the fresh garlic so much - I smashed the garlic with the side of my knife a few times while mincing so it ended up being more of a paste and rubbed a bit on each breast with my fingers. Note: I had some very different size chicken rolls so the smaller ones overcooked - I guess two different baking dishes would have been best in this case.  Also, I degreased a little of the "sauce", added some capers, cooked it down a little and tried this over pasta - yum.  I think I'll put capers into the baking dish with the chicken next time.

This was great, impressive looking...and so easy. My husband said "this ones a winner". I only wondered why you needed to shake parmesan on the chicken...it didn't seem to make much of a difference. I decreased the amount of butter used and it was still tasty. Be careful HOW much pepper you shake on the outside proscuitto...I shook too much and WOW was it hot! Fantastic recipe!

We loved this! I did not change a thing. I poured the wine/oil mix in a pan added a splash of milk and some water/cornstarch mix, heated it until thickened and it made the most amazing sauce! Thanks so much for sharing this!

Made it a few times,  IMO 1/4 cup olive oil was too much, second time 2 TBs worked for me.  I added fresh bread crumbs with the cheese as first layer on the meat interior,  also used arrugala and shallots in the stuffing, (if and when I use spinach I'll saute it first) subbed virginia ham for the prosciutto. Had no problem with the garlic.  Tied the rolls with folded strips of aluminum foil a la Jacques P.  I did grate my own Parmesan and I subbed for the mozzarella according to what I had in the fridge. Easy to make, easy to improvise and impressive when sliced and served.

After reading the reviews, I sauteed the garlic and a few slices of vidalia onion in some olive oil and used that in place of the garlic and butter. I also added a lemon pepper rub on each side of the chicken before rolling (put this under the parmesan cheese) I used fontina cheese instead of mozzarella, which worked very well with the prosciutto. Instead of the 1/4 cup of olive oil, I used some leftover vegetable broth I had in the fridge. It took a little longer than 30 mins, then I thickened the broth/wine mixture with some cornstarch, broth and fresh ground pepper and poured that over the chicken. Served with linguine and roasted asparagus. Very delicious recipe, will make again!

This was very tasty and surprisingly easy to make.  I used salami instead of prosciutto because that's what I had on hand and it worked well and I added garlic pepper seasoning along with the parmesan cheese.  Also, I had no wine so I used chicken broth.  I took advice from another poster and covered it with foil for 30 minutes and then took the foil off for 10 or more minutes until my chicken was done. It was moist and cooked to perfection.  I cut thin slices from a block of mozzarella and it stayed inside the chicken with no leaking.  I absolutely loved this chicken and will definitely make it again!

This recipe was amazing.  To cut down on fat, I simply put the prosciutto on top of the rolled up chicken breasts and topped with a bit of the mozzarella.  The kids ate it all and wanted MORE!  Definitely making again.

Will attempt to make again, but next time I will use less garlic.  Also will use ham instead of prosciutto.  I agree that the wine and oil mixture does not look very appealing after baking.

I made this exactly as the recipe stated.  It looked great and smelled great, just not a recipe for my family as we rarely eat so much salt, that is all we tasted in the dish.  If you're like me and have heart and blood pressure issues and have to keep the salt to a minimum, this is not the dish for you.

This was a very tasty dish and even my husband loved it (and he doesn't usually like parmesan cheese).  The only thing I did different was I seasoned the chicken breast with a little salt and pepper before coating it with the parmesan.  Yummy, will make again . . . and again!  Linda V., Elmhurst, IL

Everyone really loved the dish, the prosciutto makes quite the difference, I did not have fresh parmesan cheese so I just used grated and it still came out really good. Will definiately make this again. I had made 6 chickens and ended up baking it for an hour until it was done.

I made this with the help of one my 9yr's. We had a blast making it together. Even my picky eater ate it! We served it with the Penne Russo a la Vodka like someone suggested and added fresh spinich to the chicken before we rolled. The whole meal was such a hit.

Delicious! The cheeses worked so well with the meat. Not only does it taste well, but the LOOK of it impressed my husband, too! I drizzled the wine sauce over the chicken a few times as it baked. The chicken turned out VERY moist. YUM!

I served this at a holiday dinner.  It turned out good.  I did not put a whole piece of prosciutto on top. I sliced up thin pieces and put them on top of the chicken.  The big change that I would make to this recipe, is to cover it while it is cooking.  While mine turned out good, it was a bit dry on top.  I will make again and cover with foil the next time.

This was good, but not great.  Can't figure out what I'd do different.  Chicken was slightly dry, and somewhat flavorless.  It was definitely filling, could only eat about 1/2 of a chicken breast.  Maybe marinate the chicken before adding the ingrediants would help.  Probably won't make again.

Eh. That's really all I can say about this. Like everyone else, I was expecting something really spectacular because of the rating. I found it bland, even though the chicken was coated in parmesan cheese. I didn't really like the taste very much, and my cheese kind of oozed out a little bit as well. Won't make this again.

My daughter and I loved this recipe. We did a couple of variations: added rosemary to the parmesan cheese. And instead of mozzarella we used monterey jack.  I like the ideah of adding different cheeses. We've decided to make this our new Christmas Eve traditional meal and use Pepper jack Cheese for an extra kick!

Restaurant quality recipe.  Only changes I made was to increase the butter, (I dotted pats of butter on the outside too), decrease the olive oil, & increase the wine.  This makes a truer wine sauce.  Dust the rolls with a faint whiff of paprika to give them color.  I added one can of artichokes, (not the marinated type), and served over ziti.  Next time I think I will try adding some sun dried tomatoes, or mushrooms with marsala wine!  Thank you for this recipe.

I really liked this dish.  The reason for the 4 star rating is because I changed a few things.  I added parsley in the roll for color and then rolled them up, and omitted the minced garlic inside.  I just was afraid that it wouldn't cook.  Instead I added crushed garlic to the wine sauce and a little butter to the bottom of the pan for the oven.  I also browned the chicken for a few minutes on each side to give it some color.  The cooking time in the oven was shorter.  It was a very good recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

This recipe was great.  I prepared it with chicken tenders instead of chicken breasts, making 11 small wraps instead of 4 big ones.  I then served it over bow tie pasta that was lightly coated in an alfredo sauce and served with garlic bread!  It was a big hit!

Okay!  I'm lazy.  Am always looking for something easy to make, and have my husband and son like it.  Voila!!!  This is it.  Followed directions to a 'T' and it turned out great.  The combo of the olive oil and wine (I used Chablis) made a most excellent juice.  Great in the microwave the next day if you have any leftovers.
Thanks, Kris for making my life in the kitchen a bit easier

We categorize new recipes we try into "regular rotation," "repeatable," or "no thanks."  We'll repeat this one! Was easy to make and for 2 people, I pounded one chicken breast and made 2 servings. With the cheese and prosciutto, this was a hearty portion.

I liked this, hubby did not.  :(  We both agree that the wine flavor is too overwhelming in the dish and if I make it again I will use chicken broth instead.  This may just be personal preference b/c we both love wine but not so much in our food.  Also, it took more like 45-50 minutes to cook all the way through.  All in all I would love to make this again with some modifications. Also, I did not care for the raw garlic in this at all.  I love garlic, but the raw garlic was overpowering in some bites.  It's a good base recipe but needs some work in my opinion.

The only changes I made were to use provolone cheese and to cover the chicken for 20 min in the oven then cook uncovered for about 10 min.  It still came out a little dry (I even basted the rolls with the oil/wine a couple of times while cooking).  The chicken was bland tasting and all the cheese had oozed out into the sauce.  IF I made this again I would marinate the chicken in something - maybe lemon and garlic - to give it some flavor.  Also, maybe cut down the cooking time or keep it covered the whole time it cooks?  It WAS quick and easy to prepare.

This was one of the best things I've cooked.  I didn't dredge the chicken in parmesan but just put it on the inside.  I loved the garlic and the saltiness of the prosciutto in this, and I will definitely make it again.

I made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it!  I used minced garlic from the jar and put about 1/2 tsp on each chicken breast.  I also increased the amount of butter for each one - I used a heaping teaspoon.  All in all, a wonderful recipe.  Thanks!

This recipe tasted great, and wasn't that hard to make. I didn't have the problems some had of "escaping" cheese.
Having said that, I probably won't make again. My husband thought it was great, the flavors were fine, but just not my cup of tea, I guess. I would suggest that you mix the parmesan cheese with some planko bread crumbs, so that it stays on the poultry better. I grated my parmesan with a micro grater, which worksd great, but parmesan grated that way is very fine. It just didn't stay on well. Dipping in an egg first then the cheese would help it stick, too. Glad I tried it, though.

I followed the recipe as written, however, I did substitute thinkly sliced ham in place of proscuitto.

While there were no complaints from the family, overall I thought the recipe was rather bland. However, I'm rating this a four not for the flavor of the recipe itself as much as for the inspiration it's given me to try different rollatini.

A good chicken dish, especially for families with picky eaters. Will try again, but next time will experiement more with the stuffings and spices.

Great recipe!  I was up at the cabin this weekend and didn't have an oven, so I used the slow cooker.  It turned out amazing!  3 1/2 -4 hours on high did the trick.  I was only able to fit 3 rather large rolls in the pot, though.  The only down side is that most of the cheese melted out of the rolls.

This was an amazing recipe!! I was worried about the cooking time, but it really does cook in half an hour! By the time everyone was done eating this dish was completly gone. It was very moist and had an amazing flavor. I will definetly use this recipe again and possibly add spinich to the center next time as well.  I was cooking for someone that can't have cheese too so i made a separete type for them. I didn't use the cheese and I put mushrooms in the center with the everything else-- Even this turned out great!  A great dish all around!

My husband loved this chicken.  I thought it was bland.  The cheese melted out into the pan, so all the cheese flavor was lost.  I think it would have been really good if the mozzarella hadn't leaked out, but without it, there just wasn't much flavor.  My husband thought it was good, so I will be making it again, but I will probably add some spices to the inside of the chicken.

Would you believe Walmart in our area ran out of boneless chicken breast?  I subbed it with boneless pork..mmm tasty.  I didn't mind the garlic.  My husband loved it.  Also loved how light it is on the stomach.

This dish was not bad but I would suggest to SAUTE the garlic first.  I followed the recipe and the uncooked garlic was very bitter and over powering once you got to the garlic we couln't even eat it had to pick around bits and pieces that had no garlic and not much over powering.  Think would of been alot better if garlic was suated and then added.

I used this recipe but changed it slightly, because I found in the oven there was too much liquid so I did my in a pan however this takes a lot more wine because it does dry out quite quickly.  I've tried basil and tomatoes inside as well as the cheese which is yum but harder to roll up!
I've also added some softened onion to the juices at the end to make a nice sauce to pour over the chicken.

Very good!  We cooked exactly how the recipe called, and it came out great. Chicken was moist and juicy.  Will definately cook this again!

My family really enjoyed this!  I used chicken broth instead of wine and it turned out fine.  Mine had to cook about 45 minutes.

Very good. I added additional seasonings: basil, oregano, parsley, a pinch of season all - to chicken breast because we like our food well seasoned. I also added cheese on top. Chicken was juicy and quite good.

This recipe is ideal for a dinner-for-two atmosphere. The deliciousness is hard-earned, though; I found it to be time-consuming but worth the trouble. The meat remains tender and juicy, but I'd up the Parmesan and garlic a little. Also, I'd reall pound the meat flat.

YUMMY!  Used turkey bacon as a substitute since one member of household doesn't eat pork and was still pleased with the flavor.  Very nice.  Not sure how some peoples are coming out dry... ours was definitely moist.

As delicious as the recipe sounds, I was a little dissapointed with this one. For me the flavor just wasn't there. I made it almost exactly as written, the only difference being that I used a little less oil and a little more wine. I had to sprinkle salt on top of the chicken to get a better flavor, but even then it was missing something...I just don't know what.

I was bothered by the amount of oil on the bottom of the dish. I didn't like it as much as my husband did. He loves Cordon Bleu, so I made it for his taste. It was too heavy and oily for me.

This is the first time I've been tempted to write a review of a recipe.  Abby's chicken was absolutely fantastic.  I used fresh mozerella and grated my own parmesan, and bought thin chicken fillets which didn't need any pounding.  This will become a favorite "company" recipe.

This was absolutely delicious. I wanted to try something in the 'gourmet' category and was expecting something difficult, but this took no time and all and can easily be prepared ahead of time and sit in the fridge until you're ready to bake. I agree with previous posters- grating your own parmesan is a must! thanks abby!

This was quick and easy - my favorite type of meal!  I cut way back on the cheese and used provelone instead of mozzarella, about a slice and a half per breast, and left off the extra proscuitto.  Covered with foil for the first 20 minutes, and the chicken was perfectly moist.  I will definitely be making this again!

This was amazing!  My husband and I both loved it.  It is a recipe worth making for company.  I used grated parmesean and shredded parmesean cheese both (just because I had both) to coat the chicken.  Love this recipe!!

Very nice recipe! I'm not too fond of the way it looked when it was finished so I think next time i'll try and put the prosciutto & cheeses on the inside of the chicken.

Absolutely one of our favorites! Make sure to use REAL mozzarella...the flavor is so much smoother and nicer than when using shredded processed cheese.  Will make again and again!

Even my 3 & 5 yr. olds love this dish!!!  HINT: since I'd read so many reviews about the keaking cheese, I rolled each piece of stuffed chicken in another piece of prosciutto (or 2) to cover the ends.  Worked out great!

This is a very delicious chicken dish.  It's a little bit time consuming, but well worth it for an elegant meal.  I generally have used fresh parmesan, but it doesn't stick very well to the chicken - maybe canned parmesan would be better.

This was wonderful! I made it for eompany and they loved it! It was easy and looked elegant! I doubled the recipe and used a little extra wine and olive oil in the bottom of the dish. I was serving this as a low-carb meal so we did not use pasta but it would be wonderful with fettucine alfredo.

This was flavourful and moist.  Next time I would probably layer the ingredients as the rolls came out oddly shaped.  Perhaps that was due to overzealous flattening.

This was the most delicious meal ever!  My husband told me it was one of the tasiet meals I have ever made and he can't wait to have Abby's Chicken Rollatini again!  The only thing extra that I added in the recipe was some fresh basil in between the prosciutto when laid on top of the chicken.  Plus we doubled the sauce and used it on top of some brown rice that we cooked.  What a wonnderful meal!

I thought this was very delicious.  I cooked this for my fiancee, her mother, and one of my friends and  they loved it.  I cooked it with bacon instead of prosciutto and I used almost 2 cloves of garlic.  PERFECT!!  I served it with broccoli also seasoned with a touch of garlic and pepper.  A saslad consisted of lettuce, lots of tomatoes, parmesan cheese with plenty of almonds.  I mixed a little bit of Rimano Parmesan dressing in the salad.  Cheesy mozz/garlic bread added the final touch.  This is a must try recipe.  Cheesy and very filling, with just the right amount of garlic.

Very simple and tasty.  Even a picky husband loved it!  Will add a sprinkle of parsley before rolling up to add some color when slicing the rolls.  Definately a keeper!

Absolutely wonderful!!!  I use a lot of chicken so I am always looking for new ways to prepare it.  It's was a nice change from Parmesan, Scallopini, Marsala and Cacciatore.  You can be sure this will be among our top 10.  Thanks, Kris, for having your recipe included in All Recipes.  KUDOS, Iret

I made this for my husband and me.  Used a smaller dish, 1/4 c wine and a smaller yet amount of oil.  While the chicken was cooking I put about 1/2 T butter in a small skillet and sautéed 2-3T minced shallots.  I also prepared about 1/3 c chicken broth.  As soon as the chicken was done I plated it and poured the juices from the dish into the skillet.  Added the broth and really boiled it way down.  I then added about 1/3 c heavy cream and boiled to sauce consistency.  WAY yummy!  (Oh..next time I will sauté the garlic with the shallots instead of putting it raw in the chicken.)  Thanks to the individual that suggested the sauce!

This was pretty good.... I still prefer my bf's version a little better (surprise!), but w/ a few mods, I think Abby's can stand up to the competition! Here's what I did to make Abby's recipe "mine." First, I heated 2 T butter over m-h heat, sauteed ea. chx. breast (I 1/2'd the recipe) until evenly browned on all sides, then simmered on low for 30 min. My other changes were subs. 1/4 c. chx. broth (3/4 t chx. boullion granules would work also) for EVOO, add. appox. 5-6 fresh sage leaves to ea. rolled breast (what's saltimbocca w/o sage???) & using fresh shredded Parm instead of the canned stuff. I also skipped the step of adding add'l. prosciutto on top. My changes for next time would be as follows: a) DON'T roll chx. (just layer ham/sage/cheese on top), b) brown chx. in 1.5 T EVOO, c) red. 1/2 c. chx. stock (not broth) by 1/2 in a sep. skillet, d) add red. stock & 1/4 c. wine (Marsala or chardonnay) to chx., then deglaze over high heat, scraping all browned bits (yum!), e) boil until thickened & (finally...) f) swirl in 1 T butter for added richness. These changes would take this recipe over the top (IMHO). Served w/ seasoned potatoes, steamed green beans, garlic bread & the rest of the leftover wine, this made a nice dinner! Thx. for sharing Abby :)

YUMMMM!!!  I used truffle oil as well as a mix of shredded asiago & parmesan when I prepared this dish and it was so delicious!  I also put the garlic cloves in a food processor with truffle oil before I added it to my chicken...

Excellent recipe!  I didn't change anything except that I used "thin sliced" Purdue chicken (instead of pounding the chicken out) and used 1 cup of white wine - I cooked it for about 25 minutes and it was PERFECT (and saved time)!  I used fresh mozzarella and parmesan which I think also makes a difference.  I served this chicken with gorgonzola gnocchi and cold (steamed) snap peas with dill.  Excellent recipe – will definitely use again!

We loved it! I have to agree with some others on flavoring the chicken. I added more flavor by seasoning the outside of the chicken prior to baking it with a little garlic salt and pepper. I also broiled it for about 5 to 10 minutes at the very end to crisp up the bacon and brown the top a little. It turned out excellent, and I will make it again.

Okay. Maybe it was me and i just didn't pound the chicken flat enough, but after an hour and a half it is still pink. Once it finally cooked, the flavor was absolutely DEVINE! So......make sure you pound the chicken breasts really, really thin to help cook :) Thanks, I'll definitely try this again with a few revisions!

I am by no means a great chef but I found this very easy and tastefull.  I did have trouble finding prosciutto cheese though; I had to substitute a mozzarella prosciutto mixed cheese which seemed to work out well.  I did notice a few of my friends trying to pick off some of the cheese.  I guess you have to be a cheese lover for this one! Thanks

A crowd favorite. You really can't mess this one up. Perdue sells chicken that is sliced thin, so you don't have to pound it thin. Since this has a bunch of different flavors already...you can go easy with the side dishes...i.e. steamed asparagus & white rice.

I made this and it came out good! I put provolone and prosciutto in the middle. And I added chicken broth, white wine and oil on top of chicken,with basil and parsely. I covered it with foil and put butter on top of chicken. It was moist!!!!

This recipe is fantastic!  The only changes that I made were using fresh mozarella and adding sliced garlic to the wine and olive oil sauce.  I served this with asparagus risotto and Maria's broccoli rabe, both recipes also found on this site.

Fantastic recipe!!! I took other cooks advise and covered it with foil for 30 minutes and took some of the liquid from under and mixed it with heavy cream, fresh basil, garlic and onion powder, and a bit of cornstarch and made a sauce. I would give it 10 stars if possible.Thank you for the great recipe.

This dish is just wonderful. I made it for a dinner party and everyone just raved. Roll the chicken ahead of time, cover and put in the fridge. Simply add wine and oil after your guests arrive 
and pop in the oven. Thank you for a great recipe.

This is an amazing recipe!  My husband said this tastes like chicken you would get in a restaurant.  Definitely a keeper.  The only thing I did differently was sprinkle the chicken (after it was in the pan) with some kosher salt.

This was an excellant dish.  I used fresh grated Parmesan cheese and placed the prosciutto and mozzarella cheese inside the chicken breasts instead of on top of it.  I did place the extra prosciutto on top of each breast as suggested in the recipe.  Definitely a good company dish!

This was AMAZING!!! Such good flavor, and so easy to do! We will definitely be having this once a week. I used less butter (1/4 tsp of I Can't Believe it's Not Butter Light!) and it still turned out fine. Having fresh parm. cheese was a great idea - we shredded it ourselves. Also, the mozz. cheese didn't burn, or leak out too much - I think buying the slices is really key. We served it with onion potatoes, and it was fantastic.

Just finished this for tea - YUM! The kids lapped it up.

Rated 4 stars as I made a few modifications - put the mozarella inside the chicken, used only about 1 tablespoon oil and added a little chicken stock in the sauce.  Also breifly panfried the rolls before putting in the oven.  Served with sauteed vege's for a delicious meal without too much fuss after work. 

Thanks for the recipe!!!

excellent recipe, very easy to make. my husband loved it.  I had to skip the proscuito and i rolled mozzarella inside the chicken not outside. Because of this my mozzarella melted out a bit but it still came out good. the sauce came out great.

Forgot the grated parmesean and used the crumbled stuff instead. I ran out of prosciutto but had plenty of mozerella to spare, so I grated that and sprinked this over the top of the chicken and wine mixture. The result was this decadent sauce that is truly slurp-worthy. I recommend occasional basting. Husband said he ordered this at a fancy restaurant awhile ago and it was awful - he really hoovered this version though!

I've made this a few times and it's delicious!  I make more sauce than the recipe calls for (and increase the wine to oil ratio) b/c it's really tasty.  Also, I put in a fresh basil leaf in the chicken.  When you're done, put the chicken on a bed of rice (boxed quick & easy rice of course) on a nice big serving tray and frame with some mircrowaved frozen broccolli florets and people think they're having a fancy meal that really was very easy.

This is truly a five star recipe. I used thin cut breasts and it worked out perfect. The only change I made was to use garlic powder instead of raw garlic. The white wine really made it stand out above the rest. Try it you will love it!

This was quick and easy. I made it for Valentine's day to great success. My boyfriend loved it (and he's not big on chicken) and it was romantic for both of us to eat off the one big plate I served the little chicken rolls on. :o)

This was a huge hit and fairly quick. The taste and presentation were certainly worth every second of prep time.

Did with both plain ham and prociutto, and both were very good, but with the prociutto it was a big hit. Thank you for this one.

This is so good it is ridiculous.  I made it tonight and we loved it, I can't wait until I have an opportunity to make it for company.  I used extra garlic, but besides that, didn't stray from the recipe.

I made this recipe; it was so rich - I really don't see the need for all that full fat cheese - next time I will definitely cut down on the amount of cheese and the fat percentage of the cheese.  In this day and age of health conscious eaters - this recipe seems way out of control.

Absolutely wonderful!  Great for a dinner party and is so easy.  I did not have the prosciutto, so I used canned mushrooms instead, since my husband and I both love mushrooms and it was all I had on hand.  It was fabulous. I can't wait to use the prosciutto next time.  Definitely a great recipe.

I love this recipe for two reasons, 1.  It took me only 15 minutes to prep and 2. It's a perfect meal for my low carb diet.  It was full of flavor and so tasty!  My husband loved it, and he's eating the leftovers for lunch today!  Great work!

I can still hear my husband raving about this recipe.  The only subsitution I made was using a butterflied pork chop instead of a butterflied chicken breast.  I loved the idea of baking it in a combination of white wine and olive oil.  Very aromatic!  The proscuitto and cheese make it a bit salty so keep that in mind when seasoning your chicken/pork.

WONDERFUL!  Did take longer to make then the recipe said it would, but worth it if you enjoy food.  It took about a 1 hr to 1 1/2 hr to prepare, pound, layer and bake.  But very tasty...in fact, my boyfriend's mother has the recipe because it was so good.

Very Yummy! This recipe got rave reviews from my husband especially. 
I slightly altered it, First I used chicken cutlets so i didn't have to pound. (Need to make extra if you use them b/c they are smaller). I had a parmesan pesto olive oil from Williams Sonoma and I rubbed that all over the chicken first, then seasoned w/ garlic salt and added the garlic & parmesan cheese but not the butter. I laid a piece of prosciutto under the chicken as well as the layer on top w/ the cheese. Was a little tough to roll up but not too bad once i used 3 toothpicks. The olive oil and wine wasn't enough to cover the chicken so several times throughout I basted it with the mixture.
It was very good, however I love prosciutto and so I mostly wanted to eat that, it was so much more flavorful compared to the chicken. I found it hard to cut through this. I would like to find a way to cook this without having the chicken rolled. Also, if the chicken were flat it could cook in the wine better. 
The chicken wouldn't have been very flavorful w/out the flavored oil and i think i would even add more seasoning next time.
Overall it was yummy!

Everyone loved this dish!  I followed the recipe exactly except that I added sliced mushrooms to the baking pan.  I think the garlic and butter in the middle of the rolls is what really makes this dish special.  It isn't the prettiest dish but one of the best chicken dishes I've ever made.

For the side I did pasta with butter, parmesan, garlic and Pampered Chef's Italian Seasoning - YUM!

The chicken was a little bland.  I think the rolls need to be browned first in some oil or butter before baking.

This recipe was outstanding! To the center of the chicken I added fresh basil and artichoke hearts. Next time I think I'll also add a little sun dried tomato. I didn't really understand the directions very well so I'm not sure if I did this step properly... After flattening out my chicken breasts, I put all the ingredients in the middle, rolled the chicken up and put the prosciutto around it. I also cooked a balsamic sauce (recipe I also got from this site) for the side of asparagus I made. Which was DELICIOUS when pared with the chicken. Boyfriend loved it. Easy to whip up. Definitely a make again.

I’m not the biggest Chicken fan ever, but when I got this recipe on my Daily Dish e-mail, it caught my attention and I decided to give it a try.

I cooked it for my boyfriend on Saturday and it was extremely easy and turned out delicious!!!

If you ever feel like cooking a special dish with the least bit of hassle, this is the perfect recipe.

I'm giving it 4 stars because my husband loved it, but I wasn't quite so crazy about it.  Made the recipe exactly as written, but there was an off taste.  Next time I think I'll add roasted peppers or dried tomatoes and maybe some italian seasoning.

Excellent. I served with a big Italian salad, it would also be good over some pasta and a little marinara.  Thanks for the recipe!

Yum.  The only  changes I made were browning the rolls in a skillet prior to baking, AND I marinated chicken in italian dressing for a few hours before preparing.  It was AWESOME.  Really.

I didn't have any proscuitto so I made a variation of this recipe.  Cut the chicken breasts in half and covered them with Parmesan cheese. Then I put a dollop of butter and some chopped garlic on top of each breast and covered them with mozerella cheese.  When they were almost done and the cheese was brown, I added some spaghetti sauce to the top.  Turned out excellent!!

This was very tasty, to be eaten when you are really hungry.  It was very rich, with all of the cheese, and the prosciutto.
