I made these to go alongside the Boilermaker Chili also found on AllRecipes. I used Poblanos from a friend's garden and minced garlic instead of garlic salt. The flavor was very interesting... a little bitter, a little sweet, and a little spice. After a couple of bites I decided to serve them on top of the chili and was surprised by how well the two worked together. This may be the secret ingredient for some award winning chili...

What a great idea! The tangerine flavor is perfect. This is not only good as a side it's even versatile enough for many other uses.  You can use any type of mild or hot pepper according to you taste. I used a combination of poblanos and Anahiems. Next time I'll sub cilantro for the parsley. Thank you Jessica27 for sharing with us.
