I don’t understand how these don’t have more reviews?? These are honestly some of the best cookies I have had. I don’t like white chocolate, I don’t like cranberries (at allll), but these really are so good. I never put the almonds in them because they are too hard for my son and I, but other than that, I do everything the same. My family always gets these around the holidays, but I have people asking for them all through the years. I’m a home baker and this is one recipe that I do not change, and it is the most requested.

These cookies are the bomb !!!!!!!! My husband had to give some away before he ate the whole batch by himself.They are soooo tasty and soft.I used dark chocolate instead of white and they were delicious. One recipe makes over 60 cookies  tablespoon size.Definitely will make these again.

Yesterday, my 7 year old grandson told me that he loved Craisins.  I had just seen this recipe and decided to make it for him.  The cookies are awesome!  It's a large recipe and that's good.  By the time I distribute bags of cookies to my grandsons and a few friends, I'll have some left for me too.  The only changes I made to this recipe was that I used regular Craisins instead of the cherry flavored and it was fine.  I love the buttery taste of these cookies and I'm sure my family and friends will too.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

These are the BEST and oh so addictive! My husband took some to work and the guys devoured them and asked when I would be making them again. Warning...you won't be able to stop eating these!

Great cookies!!  We love orange flavored craisins!  Next time I make I am going to use orange craisins and also add 2 tablespoons of orange zest.  I may even make an orange icing to drizzle over the top of cookies.   Recipe is also great as written!!!

Delicious!  They have great flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly except I increased the almond extract another half a teaspoon.  My family all loved them!  I also flattened them with a spatula straight out of the oven which gives them a great texture in the middle.  They are a perfect Christmas cookie.

These are so simple but they are amazing! The recipe makes a lot but I used a small scoop and made about 8 dozen small cookies in no time at all. We omitted almonds because I forgot to grab some, and added some extra white choc chips for the kids. Perfect addition to my holiday baking list.

I made them according to the recipe. They could have a few more chips and craisins. I do love the taste and the softness. I did flatten them a bit and cooked them for 14 min... Yum.. going into my recipe book!

Did the recipe as is for a holiday bake sale. Delicious! Only thing to keep in mind is that they don't spread out much if at all while baking, so next time I make them I plan to flatten them a bit more.

I made these cookies yesterday afternoon and they are delicious! I used all vanilla extract as we don't care for almond flavoring. I substituted chopped pecans for the nuts and used plain dried cranberries instead of the cherry flavored. Baking time is spot on. The recipe makes LOTS of cookies! I'll be making these again during the holidays.

I decided to make a partial batch of these because they fit the ingredient profile I created to use up some items in my pantry.  I programmed it for 20 servings and got 18 of really very yummy cookies, but I have to admit that I did use all butter.  I loved what my 13-year-old granddaughter had to say:  "What's in 'em?"  "Almonds, cranberries, and white chocolate chips."  "I don't like those, but I'll try them anyway." A few minutes later,  "Can I have another one?"  And so it goes.  I had to send several more to her family after they tasted them.  So these are a hit!  I love how the bottoms are all crunchy but the middles are soft.  I guess these will be asked for once again!  :)  Thanks for the recipe!

These are wonderful cookies! I make several batches over the holidays. I prefer dark chocolate chunks over the white chips, so that’s what I always use, however, I’ve improvised adding coconut or using walnuts instead of almonds, but at the end of the day, almonds are my fave. Give this a try, great cookie!

Dear Husband says "I don't like white chocolate or cranberries, so you can have them." I used dried cherries instead, omitted the almonds, substituted honey flavoring for the almond extract and he LOVED them! Me too! I'm usually not a fan of white chocolate either, but had too many bags left over from holiday baking, and this was an excellent way to use them!
