So simple yet so very good!  I made this for our Easter dinner today, and it was delicious!  Because I needed my oven for other cooking projects, I put my precooked spiral ham in the crockpot, set it on low, and three hours later had a ham that was just-right sweet, tender, juicy.  The juice that collected made the best ham gravy; all I had to do was put it in a sauce pan, make a slurry of cornstarch and water, added it to the juices and cooked until thickened.  No other season required.  Perfect! This will be the way I make baked ham from now on.

My ham was smaller, but I went ahead & used the full amount of glaze. We loved the flavor, and my ham was tender & juicy & the glaze was a sweet & tangy complement to the ham. I used 2 teaspoons regular mustard in place of the dry mustard.Great recipe Roz21, and I will definitely use it again!

This was very good coating for ham.  I like the idea of wrapping the ham in foil with the glaze while it cooks.  I just added all of the glaze at the beginning and didn't unwrap it towards the end.  This might also be good using pineapple preserves.

Exceptional!!  I myself am not a huge ham fan~ this one I am!  I used a regular bone in ham, not a spiral cut.  I also decided to use my crock pot.  I put a small bit (about 5 oz) of soda (I used  Diet Sierra Mist) so it would not cook to the bottom.  I poked the ham all over and would from time to time using a baster, put the juice into the ham.  I used more than what was called for as far as the apricot jam (preserves)~ probably close to doubled it.  I also added about 1/4 to 1/3 cup of honey and about 1/2 teaspoon of ground cloves.  I cooked it on high for about four hours, but it was done before that (but did not dry out at all).  My entire family loved it, my kids too~ dad even jumped online to get the recipe so he could save it!

It seems to be my job to cook hams during the holidays. I tried this one at Thanksgiving this year and everyone loved it. I used a huge 26 pound ham, so I had to use a little more. I also used my old reliable charcoal grill instead of baking the ham. My family will see to it that I make this ham again.

This ham was great. Everybody loved it.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect.  The ham gravy was delicious--I added extra apricot jam to the juice to really bring out the flavor.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Best way to glaze and cook the ham. Used spicy brown mustard instead of dry.

This was the best ham ever!!!  I've been looking for a ham recipe and FINALLY found one!  I used a spiral cut ham, put most of the glaze on, wrapped my ham in foil and popped it in the oven.  About 1/2 hour before serving, I added the remaining glaze.  Everyone was amazed at the flavor yet it was soooo easy.  I used the recipe as is.  Don't change a thing.  This recipe is a winner!!

I used a brown sugar and mustard glaze as I had no apricot jam and it turned out great.  Will use this recipe every time.

Mmmm Mmmm Good!!! Wanted to stud my ham with whole cloves but didn't have any so added a pinch of ground cloves to the brown sugar mixture (doubled the recipe for a 12lb. ham). Baked 20 min. per pound at 325* only because I didn't pay attention to that part of the directions, basted it every 30 minutes & it turned out PERFECT! The glaze was a huge hit with the drippings being scooped up by everyone to dip their ham slices....Mmm Mmm can't wait for leftovers tonight!

Thank you for the great recipe!  I made this for Christmas dinner and it was delicious.  I didn't have any dry mustard so I just used a little spicy brown mustard instead.  The ham had great flavor and was nice and moist.

WOW!  This smelled fantastic!  As a vegetarian, I didn't eat it, but sure was tempted to convert to meat-eater!  ;-)  My husband and kids LOVED it!  After it was cooked, I drained the juices from the pan, combined with cornstarch in a pan and cooked on the stove for 15 min or so to thicken into a dipping sauce.  Everybody loved it!  And it was SO simple.

I found the juice didn't soak in and was just in a puddle at the bottom. Also, after 14 minutes per pound (I had a 2lb ham) the inside was still cold. I didn't have a spiral cut ham though so this could be why these things happened. I salvaged it by cranking up the heat to 400, redipping the ham in the glaze and cooking it uncovered for 10 minutes, the outside crisped up nicely and had good flavor. I will retry this recipe with a spiral ham to see if it cooks faster and soaks up more of the juices.

Thought I had apricot preserves, but only had peach, so I had to make that substitution.  Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly.  The foil kept the ham nice and moist.  I opened it and glazed again, per the directions, and let it cook for another 20-30 minutes uncovered (8lb spiral ham).  It came out fantastic!  BF said it was the best ham he's ever had, 5 stars from both of us - thanks!!  UPDATE 6/25/11 I've made this several times now, but have made a small change:  decreased the preserves to 1/4c and also add 1/4c of honey.  Still loving this recipe!

This is a VERY simple, VERY easy way to make a great ham.  Want to make it AMAZING?  Use a deeper roasting pan, cover the bottom with 2 cups chicken broth and 4 quartered oranges.  Cover, Cook, Devour!

I used a butt portion ham.  Absolutely delicious.  Cooked on low in the crock pot for 2.5 hours, re-glazed and broiled in the oven until the brown sugar and apricot preserves caramelized (a couple of minutes).  SUPER!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The glaze in this recipe was wonderful and this was super easy to make.  I did have a problem with the cooking instructions though.  I baked my ham at 275, 14 min. per lb. and the middle was stone cold.  I will make this again but I will definitely adjust the time and temperature.

I did not follow the recipe even remotely exactly.  I used blackberry preserves instead of apricot jam, no brown sugar, brown mustard instead of mustard powder, and cooked it in the crock pot on low.  It came out wonderfully - falling-apart, juicy, tangy, and it was so easy to pull the bone out.  The sauce made a wonderful gravy, perfect for mashed potatoes or for dipping fresh toast strips.  Big hit with the kids, too!  This recipe might be perfect as written, but it's perfect if you take great liberties as well.  I think I will be buying up a number of hams while they are cheap post-Christmas and making this part of our normal meal rotation!

I followed these measurements exactly, and it turned out perfectly! I needed the oven for other things though so I put my ham in the crock pot 3 hours on low. It was salty and sweet AND juicy. :)

This was very very good! This was my first year bringing the ham to our easter family gathering and so I was nervous that it would turn out. I had a 7.5 lb dearborn fully cooked ham and used a whole jar of apricot jam, 3/4 cup brown sugar, 2 heaping tablespoons of whole grain mustard and 1/8 tsp ground cloves. I poured half of the glaze on the ham and let cook about 2 hours at 275 degrees covered in foil. Then I took the foil off, poured the rest of the glaze over and let cook about close to one more hour. It was sweet and savory and just delicious. Everyone loved it and volunteered me to make the ham again next year! I might try and make it in the crock pot like some others did.

Followed the directions as is and it was fabulous!  They leftovers were great for sandwiches.  The foil kept it juicy and mess free.  Will make this again.

This glaze is amazing!  I used a tad more jam than called for, and added some pineapple juice to it.  I also added cloves and pineapple rings to the ham.  It was the first one I've ever done and everyone loved it, thank you!

I used two tablespoons of yellow prepared mustard instead of the dry mustard powder. It made a simple, yet amazing glaze. This was my first time to enclosed the ham in foil. I have usually used a roaster in the past. Not only did the foil allow for a tender, delicious ham, but the clean-up was very simple!

We made this for dinner last night.  I didn't get a spiral cut ham because I was going to use it for Bean soup, but DH decided he wanted a baked ham instead, so I used this recipe and was amazed that the flavors went all the way through!  Very good!  We will be saving this recipe and using it again.

Made this for Christmas dinner.  I didn't have dry mustard so used 1 tsp prepared mustard. It was super easy and very tasty.  My seven year old loved dipping her ham in the the cooked glaze. It's a keeper!  Thanks! :O)

I made this recipe last year and everyone loved it so much I used it again this year. I thin it down a tad with a small splash of O.J. I'm pescatarian  so I didn't actually eat the ham but again, rave reviews. What I love is how juicy the meat is when it comes out. The glaze tastes amazing but it also caramelizes nicely and locks in the juices. P.S. I had the glaze over a piece of Salmon and it was amazing!

This was my first ham that I have made and it was amazing!!! My husband loved it and so did I, and I'm not that crazy about ham. I did tweak it a little, I though it was a bit too thick so I added a few tbls of orange juice and it was PERFECT! I also cooked it for an additional 15mins and cranked it up to 400.

I made this for Easter breakfast this morning.  I am not very fussy about ham but what's Easter without ham, it was down right succulent.  I didn't have dry mustard on hand so I used a teaspoon of French's prepared mustard.  WILL MAKE THIS AGAIN!!!

Pretty tasty.  Probably as good and very similar to a pineapple brown sugar glazed ham.  Like some others, I too had to cook mine much longer as it was still cold in the middle!

I tried this recipe for dinner tonight with an 11 pound non spiral ham, bone in.  it took a little over 3 hours to cook.  I used dijon mustard because I did not have the dry stuff.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe to the t. It was so very delicious! Very very moist and tender.  The drippings were so good! especially with bread dipped into it! Will use this recipe every time I make a ham!

This ham is delicious! Our grocer doesn't carry apricot jam, though. We could only find preserves so I had to pick out the fruit chunks. To save some money I also decided to use the mustard we already had in the house instead of buying mustard powder. It turned out really well!

I doubled the sauce and brushed it on throughout the cooking time.  Absolutely delicious!  Next time I might just brush most of the sauce on and let it cook in foil without disruption.  Made this for Christmas dinner- outstanding!  We will definitely use this recipe for future ham in this house!

Tasty!  I usually make the ham with pinapples and brown sugar so this was similar and tasted very good - everyone liked it but I think they prefer the pinnapple version.

This was easy & delicious.  I did use spicy mustard instead of the mustard powder, and I used my convection oven at 250 degrees F.  I would recommend very thoroughly lining your pan for easy clean-up.  The juices went under the foil & glued it to the pan.  Not a fun clean-up.

I used this glaze for my Christmas ham this year.  I ended up with way too much glaze for my ham, though mine wasn't spiral cut, which may have made a difference.  It was really quick and easy, and I was able to make the glaze a day ahead so the day-of prep was a snap, leaving me to actually enjoy the day with my family.  I substituted a Peach Mango jam for apricot, and I think you could do a lot of experimentation with the jams/sweeetners to customize the dish to the rest of the meal.

This was good. I didn't have apricot jam, so I used the rest of a jar of plum jam and a little applesauce to make 1/3 of a cup, plus dijon mustard instead of mustard powder. Tasty. The only complaint I have is the cook time. After 2 hours, I checked on the ham and it just looked underdone, so I added 20 minutes and bumped the temperature to 325.  When I took it out, it was still only warm in the middle--it was only an 8 pounder, too. I'd increase the cook time by at least 30 minutes, uncovered so that it gets a nice golden brown color.

5 stars for flavor and simplicity! I used prepared mustard to taste, approx 1T.  I've never purchased dry. I am not a big fan of apricot, but it works beautifully here! Thanks for the recipe!!!

Heat glaze in the microwave for 45-60 sec's on 50 power to loosen it & make it easier to brush on.  Unless you're going to "brown it" with the glaze at the end, just add all the glaze at the beginning.  I always wrap my hams in foil to keep them sooo juicy.  Try it with maple syrup, or brown sugar and karo syrup.  They're all excellent!  Thanks for the post!!

Very good - not really a ham lover, but this was good and got many compliments for it.,  My 2 year old grandson is asking for more ham from the leftovers instead of his "cookie".

This is an amazing recipe.  I used it this year for Easter dinner and I have used it many times since!  The only change I made is that I made extra sauce because I wanted extra to spoon over the ham on our plates!  Definitely the best ham recipe I have ever eaten!

Followed the directions and ingredients exactly and the ham came out great!  I think wrapping the ham in the foil makes a difference and my ham came out so tender.  At the end of the cooking time I poured off some of the juices to make a ham glaze by adding some skim milk and flour.  The ham was so good that eveyone said it did not even need the glaze...Thanks for sharing and this will be my go to when I make another ham..

Wonderful--made a couple modifications.  Started with 120 oz jar apricot preserves, added 1/3 cup honey, 1tsp ground cloves and 1 1/2 tsp ground ginger and used a 20# whole ham.  Scored the fat and reduced 1/2 of pan juices 1 hr from done.  Uncovered and browned/basted ham the last hour.  Best ham I've done yet.

Very good and easy!  I made a double recipe to cover 2- 9 pound hams.  I used a little more apricot preserves then called for just to use up the rest of the jar, but didn't change anything else.  I also heated the glaze in the microwave a little to make it easier to brush on the hams.  Delicious!  I received a lot of compliments -- definately not too sweet, and paired well with the smokey flavor of the ham.

This glaze kept the ham nice and moist, next time I will heat a little extra glaze to serve as a gravy for the ham. Will definitely be making this recipe again.

UNlike several who once again rated a recipe 5 * after tweaking it to make it their's rather than the cook who submitted this recipe...I followed the recipe to a T and it's wonderful.  No other way to make a ham as far as I'm concerned.  Thanks!!!

Made this with McCutcheon's Orchard Apricot-Pineapple Preserves and it was fantastic. Double the glaze to serve some on the side with your meal.

I used orange marmelade since I didn't have apricot at home and it was OK. Nothing special.

Thank you for an easy, delicious recipe.  The foil helps the ham stay moist and ensures easy clean-up, another bonus.  Next time I might put more mustard and/or some other spices in to make it a bit zippier.

Excellent! I made it today for Easter dinner. It was great. I put it in the crockpot on high for 5-6 hours; very tender, very tasty. Thanks for the great recipe! I'll remember this one!

I never baked a ham wrapped in foil so maybe that's why this was so delicious. It was so simple and the whole family agreed it was the best ham ever.

I used a shank ham and trimmed some of the fat. Then did as the recipe said but cooked it at 350 because it was not fully cooked. I have to say it was the best ham I ever tasted.  It was also very easy.

I made this on Easter and it was delicious. I bought a pre-cooked 10 lb brown sugar ham, so I skipped the brown sugar in the glazing and just used the apricot jam with the mustard powder. Be sure not to overcook the ham or it will taste dry. 3 hours at 275 degrees will do it for a 10b ham. Delicious!

I have made this ham for years, ever since I got the recipe out of Taste of Home.  The original recipe called for a criss-cross cut studded with whole cloves and then the jam and brown sugar.  That is the only way my family wants me to make ham from now on.

Very moist ham.  However, I did not find the glaze to be powerful enough.  Next time I probably will double the glaze and melt the extra in the microwave or on the stove and then drizzle over the finished ham to give it a thicker final flavor.

I made this recipe last night. The ham was very moist and just had the right sweetness/saltiness. My only problem was the brown sugar/apricot preserve mixture. It was really pasty and very difficult for me to apply on the ham. The mixture kept falling off. I had to press it firmly to the ham to make it stay. Does it make a difference using preserve and jam?

I took others' suggestions and made this in the crockpot: low for 4 hours. It came out wonderfully moist and falling off the bone, but the glaze didn't come to fruition -- too much stock in the bottom I think. Great recipe though!

It was alright.  My family didn't really eat it.  Two days later and I am desperately trying to find a recipe to use up all this ham! I don't think they liked it being such a 'sweet' meat.

I made this for Easter.  I used bitter orange preserves.  I got wonderful reviews, just a hint of sweetness, a very nice combo. I think the apricot jam and brown sugar would be very sweet. Will make this the next time we have ham.

My whole family loved this recipe. I did not have any dry mustard powder, so I just used regular mustard. I rubbed this mixture all over the ham and let it marinade for 5 hours. I cooked mine on top of the stove in my waterless, stainless steel cookware. YUM, YUM!!

We loved this glaze.  I used a brandied peach jam since I didn't have apricot.  The foil stuck to my roasting pan...guess I should have expected this but it has been a pain to clean up.  Next time I will spray the pan before adding foil.  This will be my "go to" ham recipe from now on.  Easy and delicious.

Easy enough to make, it just tasted . . . plain. No one was impressed and no one took seconds. My husband goes, "It just takes like ham."

I even tripled the sauce and I still think we could've thrown the ham in the oven with nothing and ended up with the same taste. I'll stick to my usual recipe.

My brother is a huge fan of the ham my sister makes.  She usually just uses the packet that comes with it, but he just raves about it.  I made this for a family gathering, and my brother has decided he has a new favorite ham!  It is so good!  So simple and quick to put together, with an amazing taste.

I didn't have a spiral ham, but did have a 2 1/2 pound small ham.  I made slices in the ham and followed the recipe.  The results were a nice, moist ham, with a sweet flavoring.  My family enjoyed this with 'Autumn Apple Salad', 'Lengenberg's Boiled Potatoes' and 'Beer Muffins', all AR recipes.

This is very good.  I kept it wrapped in foil the hole time it cooked. The ham was delicous and very pretty. I kinda kept the foil tightly sealed but not touching the ham.  Everyone liked it

I thought I already had the world's best recipe for perfect ham.  But this beat it!  I used a pre-sliced 11 pound ham and did not enclose it in foil.  Also, because I was short on time I set oven temperature at 350 and baked the ham  for 2 hours and 45 minutes.  It looked absolutely beautiful and tasted absolutely wonderful.

Incredibly yummy!  I upped the amount of apricot preserves, and also discovered I didn't have any dry mustard, instead, I used equal parts of regular and dijon mustard, I probably used about 2 Tbsp each, the house smelled incredible, and everyone proclaimed this ham fantastic! It's now my official Easter ham!

I have recipe that came from a restaurant in Ontario.It had apple juice,mustard,lemon juice and maple syrup or brown sugar.  On looking at  the recipe now, I see that it had crushed pineapple.  I haven't made this dish for some forty years, but I don't remember that.  BUT I do know the ham was absolutely delicious.  It is much on the same lines as the recipe given.

Turned out great. My ham was just under 10 lbs. I brought it to room temp before putting in oven. Was still cold in the center after 2 hours. Was warm enough after 3 hours, but still not hot.

Amazing!!  Used apricot/pineapple preserves, spicy brown mustard, and a bit of pineapple juice with the brown sugar glaze.  I couldn't stop "sampling" the sauce each time I basted.  DH is still licking his lips and is excited about leftovers!!

Delicious.  I used Peach preserves instead of the apricot jam (as that is what I had) and used the Splenda brown sugar blend in place of the regular brown sugar - would have used the no added sugar preserves if I had it, but...  This turned out great.  I had a spiral ham, warmed it, added the glaze that came with it, then added this one after it had completely warmed (I warmed the mixture for about 30 secs first in the microwave before spreading).  I put the ham back in the oven for about 10 mins.  Wonderful.  This will definitely be my go to "homemade" glaze.  Thanks.

I made this for Easter and it was amazing! Everyone raved about it! Because of time the last half hour I cooked it at 350 as I needed to bake another dish. I did use a internal thermometer and cooked until 140 degrees. My husband said it was the best ham ever!

I made this for dinner with friends.  I added some pineapple juices and ground cloves to the glaze.  My friend who is not a huge fan of ham loved it.  The apricot jam is really a perfect base for the glaze!

I used a seven pound ham but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  It was easy to put together and tasted great!

Made this for Christmas dinner.  It was easy and really good.  Thought my 10 year old who is a very picky eater was going to explode he ate so much.  Added cornstarch/water to meat juice and made a tasty gravy.

Found this recipe today just before putting my ham in for our Easter dinner. Glad I did!  It turned out wonderful, even though I used brown suger diabetasweet since I'm diabetic, and I didn't have apricot preserves but I had some peach preserves on hand and used them.  It was great!  So even though I didn't exactly follow the original recipe, I am giving it 5 stars.  I will use this again.

The glaze was very good. Next time I will make double the glaze, saving the last half to thin and pass with the served ham as a sauce.

I use a slow cooker for the most delicious ham I've ever had. One of my favorite recipes! Don't like spiral cut so used semi boneless.

My Holiday guests raved about the taste and tenderness. I made several ingredient substitutions. A 13 lb smoked ham baked at 325 degrees for 3 hrs 15 min. Scored and whole cloves inserted throughout. Glazed the last hour with a spicy brown sugar sauce, I did not have apricot jam so I created my own glaze: 1.5 cups of brown sugar, add 2 tsp each of A1 sauce, soy sauce and spicy BBQ sauce, 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice and 1/2 tsp black pepper. You may add or decrease ingredients according to your taste.

Every time I make this glaze, I get rave reviews!  I use the recipe amount for a 2-3 pound ham. I make a double recipe for a bigger ham. I use a large knife to stab deep holes into the ham, if it is spiral cut.

Easy and absolutely delicious! This is a keeper. I used Apricot Preserves and had to add about a teaspoon of  water before I could "brush" it on. I cooked my ham exactly as instructed. Next time, I'll cut the final 20 minutes of baking time off.

Excellent! I made a 12lb. Shank half ham. Since it wasn’t spiral cut, I scored it ,  brushed plenty of the glaze onto it, and wrapped it in foil. I refrigerated it overnight.
After allowing the ham to get to room temperature, I baked it for just under three hours.  It was juicy and flavorful.....no leftovers....now that says something!

Simple, cheap, and quick. The brown sugar apricot glaze was great.  Didn't turn me int a ham lover, but guests enjoyed it and another ham hater like it. Cooked it with a bone-in 10 pound ham and had to turn the oven up to 350 the last 20 min.

I used a hickory smoked brown sugar ham instead of a honey ham because I needed a smaller ham for only 2 people.  Also used apricot preserves instead of jam.  And substitute 2 teaspoons yellow mustard  for dry.  It was awesome.

I was a little skeptical. Too simple, too easy. Dead wrong. Sometimes I forget the K.I.S.S. Principle.

Delicious. 

Two changes for next time: 1) Double the batch. We had a 15 pound shank portion and this just barely did the job. 2) One tablespoon of brandy really made the flavors pop.

I followed the directions, but I cooked it for about 35 minutes uncovered, for a nice crust. It is so good and simply delicious. I can't stop nibbling. Lol.

I made this for Thanksgiving last year. My family loved it! I also used a smaller ham but used the full recipe for the glaze. This is a really  easy recipe that even a beginner can make.

This is the BEST recipe for Ham. I have been looking for a great recipe for ham. I made this last night and it turned out awesome. My ham was just over 8 lbs. I didn't have apricot jam so I used Orange marmalade and added a few splashed of O.J. in the bottom of the foil. Cooked it for 1 1/2 hrs in foil then removed foil and added the remaining glaze and cooked it for another 1/2 hr. Then let it rest for 15 minutes. It turned out so moist. Thank you for this recipe

The glaze is yummy but you don't get the benefit of it unless you serve the juices as a sauce for it.

This is a great ham recipe!!!  I added a little bit of pineapple juice to the bottom of the cooker and pineapple rings toward the end of the cooking and that was a nice bonus! This so tender and has so much flavor!  It is a keeper!!
