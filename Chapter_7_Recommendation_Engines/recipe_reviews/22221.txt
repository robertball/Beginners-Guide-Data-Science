Wonderful dish...I added 1/2 cup fresh sliced mushrooms and left out the peanuts.

This was a good recipe but I found myself having to add more of every spice. It didn't have enough flavor at first. I basically doubled the sauce and it came out flavorful. I served it with snow peas over rice.

This was very good & very quick & easy.  I have used the sauce from this recipe with several other stir fry meals.  Nice and spicy!

This was really yummy. I didn't have any ginger root, so I ended up using ground ginger. I had this last night for dinner and today my stomach is telling me that there were a few too many red peppers in this .. for me anyway. I will make this again, but perhaps will substitute half the red peppers for zucchini or broccoli or something.

This was awesome!  You don't really need the peanuts - skip this ingredient if you're trying to cut back on the fat.  Wish that I had doubled for left-overs!

Excellent - my hubby doesn't like "new"stuff, 
but he loved this one; served on bed of chinese
steamed noodles...about 6 minutes cooking time!
Great for a hot summer night...

This is a favorite in our family!  I substitute 1 package of firm tofu for the chicken and it tastes delicious.  When I use tofu I like to double the sauce recipe so that the tofu picks up the additional flavor.  Yum!
