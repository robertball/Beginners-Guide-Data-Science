These are regular Deviled Eggs with the addition of parmesan cheese. I didn't measure anything, just mixed everything together.  I refused to put ketchup on them so I garnished them with more parmesan.

3.2.18  Wouldn’t say this was my favorite deviled egg, a bit bland, and I couldn’t even taste the parmesan.  Simply couldn’t see putting ketchup on top of a deviled egg, but I did garnish with a dollop of chili sauce with garlic which gave it a little bit of interest.
