This dip was really good but after a few changes, that's the reason I'm only giving 4 stars. I added extra tomatoes, jalapenos and lots of cilantro, I can't imagine this dip without the flavor of cilantro.

This is a really good basic recipe. I like my guacamole chunky so I usually do 1 tomato, 1-2 avocado, 1/4-1/2 an onion, minced. And I use a splash of lime juice instead of lemon, a sprinkling of salt, and a bunch of chopped cilantro. This is a great starter recipe though for someone who has never really made guacamole.

There's nothing like a really good guacamole! I cut the recipe in half and used de-seeded my tomato and since not "type" of onion was specified I chose a red onion. I used fresh lime juice instead of lemon juice and added a bit of garlic, salt, 1 Tbsp. of chopped cilantro, and 1/4 tsp. of cumin. Great with warm tortilla chips!

There's wiggle room w/ the recipe for your personal taste, which is great.  I used this recipe as a home base but with a couple alterations and it was fabulous: 3-4 cloves of garlic, minced; and 1 Tbsp squeezed lime instead of lemon juice.  I had the family over for dinner and they loved the dip and asked for the recipe.  I guess I'll hand it over...  I'll stay on top of the game though by next time mixing some sweet white corn and black beans... mmmm.

YUMMM!
The first time I made it following the recipe, and it was ok. Not overly interesting, but certainly tasty enough. The second time I took the posted advice and used lime juice instead of lemon, and a few shakes of dried cilantro - that made it pop!

I would definitely use garlic instead of onion, add some black beans (out of a can) and ... well, maybe I have a different recipe altogether.

Fast and easy. I didn't have tomato so I added a little tomato salsa and onion powder instead of fresh onion. I used crystallized lemon powder. This needed a little something though and so I sprinkled it with some garlic salt and it was fabulous! We ate the entire dish. Thanks.

I like this recipe. It's very similar to my own. I use lime juice instead of lemon and I add sea salt, jalapeno, and cilantro. I love onions, so I use a lot more than listed here. My family and friends love it!

Use lemon or lime juice, salt and pepper. Add few hearty dashes of Worcheshire sauce. Makes it pop with flavor!

Good for a basic recipe. I seeded the tomatoes to keep the dip from getting watery, and added a couple of cloves of garlic, minced. and added a little salt. Plus I doubled the recipe. (You can never have enough guacamole, and I have a couple of real guacamole lovers in the famile!) Put a pit in the center of the leftovers before storing in the fridge and it will help keep the dip from getting so brown.

I thought this really needed some salt since there was no other seasoning. I added just a few shakes of garlic salt, and that made a huge difference.

We like ours a little spicy so we had really fine chopped onions and some jalapeños.
