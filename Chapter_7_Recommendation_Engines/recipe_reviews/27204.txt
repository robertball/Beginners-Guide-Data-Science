This sounds good, but not like "halushky" that I'm used to. Halushky is egg noodles sauteed in butter w/ chopped cabbage. what's described here is a vareniki or pierohi (pierogie)

My Grandmother used to make this for me and I never could determine the proper ratio of ingredients. Thanks! This brought back many wonderful memories.

This is interesting! I'm going to try this recipe out for sure! Mainly, I wanted to comment on the review left by Beacon - whatever you are describing there ( was it noodles with cabbage?), is NOT halushky!!!!!!! As a full blooded Ukrainian, born and raised there I can tell you that halushky, as Olga put it best: "... is a Ukrainian name for dumplings made of batter or thick dough mixture. Various ingredients are added for tenderness, texture, flavor, and food value. They are served with a stew, or roast and gravy, or as a side dish". My grandmother used to make soup with halushky (or z halushkamy for those of us that speak Ukrainian :)  Personally, I'm always looking for an authentic Ukrainian recipe with a twist - thank you for this one Olga.

This is also a traditional Slovak dish but we have it slightly different.  We make ours basically shredded up potatoes (to a paste-quick I use blender!), flour and egg then add bacon and cheese.  There are variations of this dish but this is what I grew up on.  I have since then added my own variations-Thanks for sharing!!

I believe that the halushy another user described of noodles and cabbage is a Polish tradition, while the one listed here is more Ukranian/Slovak.  Both are very tasty!

I love polish food, my grandmother was Ukrainian. Anything containing potatoes, onions and cabbage is a tasty treat. However I just threw this  out the door! And I would not recommend it for the novice cook. I have been cooking for about 50 years and can rescue most anything but I finally just dumped this. There is nothing in the ingredients that should have been difficult to work with. But I do believe that hand shredding the potatoes caused them to just be too watery. I dryed them several times but it would have taken 5 lbs of flour to get any kind of workable dough to fill. They might work as drop dumplings? I tryed frying them like potatoe pancakes, put onions and cabbage in the skillet with a few...all of these things should have worked but it just didn't. They tasted terrible. and I didn't think that was possible. So maybe it was just me having a DAY. But my advise is to try something else. This recipe needs too much tweeking, your time is better spent on something else like perogie.
