This is actually really good.  I didn't have unsweetened cocunut flakes, so i used the sweetened flakes.  I thought the sweetness was perfect!  There is a review that says you need to add the flour to the ingredients.  Do Not Do That!  (I did the first time)  I checked various other recipes for Shuku Shuku and the flour is only to coat the ball of "dough".  I will be making this again!

Well, I think you should add the flour to the ingredients!  When I was making this and read over the instructions, it didn't say to add the flour.  All it said was to roll it in flour.  When I mixed the egg yolks, sugar, and coconut, I KNEW it wouldn't hold a shape, so I decided the flour has to be added to the mixture.  

I thought the cookie tasted okay, not great...pretty dry, but it was alright.  And the kids I made it for liked it, so it seemed to be a hit with them.  I rolled the cookies in powdered sugar after they were baked and cooled some.

By the way, if anyone is looking for unsweetened coconut & superfine sugar, Kroger sells their own brand of both.

Only 4 ingredients. Simple to make. I don't have kids, but if I did I would have them make this recipe to introduce them to baking desserts.

You can use sweetened coconut flakes if you like your cookies on the sweet side. I use the unsweetened because I don't like overly sweet desserts. I use brown sugar, but any finely ground sugar would work.

I have also been experimenting with different flours. Some people have said on here that their cookies come out dry and this is a direct result of adding the flour to the batter when you should just ROLL them in the flour before placing them on the cookie sheet. When you do this your cookies will be moist and tasty with a powdery outside. So far, I have tried all-purpose, oatmeal flour, a gluten-free flour, and wheat flour all with good results. Again - don't add the flour to the batter!

Made this for staff meeting this morning and they chose these over the Krispy Kreme Doughnuts - go figure!!  I did use the sweetened coconut.  I also just rolled them in the flour, so they wouldn't be too dry....turned out perfect.

Maybe I'll give these another chance someday, as I must have screwed up this recipe somehow, as we did not care for them at all.  So many great reviews, it was a big disappointment.

I tried out this recipe as a possibility for an African-themed tea party I'm planning next month. They're pretty good, but I would say half the flour would have been plenty. I actually used even less than that, because I rolled some in almond meal instead, as a gluten-free alternative (which I know some of my guests would appreciate). Those ones were much tastier, so if I do end up making this again, I'll definitely make them all that way. The regular flour is just dry and tasteless - what's the point? I bet they would also be good rolled in more grated coconut , or perhaps cocoa powder.  They were quick and very easy to make.

This is really tasty. I was looking for something to do with leftover egg yolks from making meringues. I used powerdered coconut and ground up my own sugar (to make superfine sugar) for this recipe. I will try it with the flaked coconut next time. I doubled the recipe but only got about the amount indicated for a single batch because the powdered coconut is much more compact than the flaked, I believe.
