I made this twice and my second batch was so much better.  The first time I put too much orange zest by packing down the tablespoon.  On my second attempt I added the zest a teaspoon at a time and tasted the batter (before adding the raw eggs) until I got the orange flavor right.  It ended up being about a tablespoon, just not packed down.  Also, make sure you don't get any of the white rind when zesting because it will make the cookies bitter.  It took about 10 minutes to bake for a chewy texture.  I will definitely make these again.  They're so yummy!! One more thing... put the batter in the fridge for at least 10 min before baking and the cookie won't be flat or hard.  These also freeze well.  I just balled them up and put them in a freezer bag.  Place the frozen balls on a cookie sheet and by the time the oven is preheated, the they're ready to go in.  It took an extra minute or two to bake. This way I can have fresh baked cookies any time I want.

I love the combination of flavors in this cookie.  I used orange flavored craisins in place of the chopped pecans and it turned out great!  The 15 minute cook time did seem a bit long to me, but I like my cookies to be soft.  10-12 minutes seemed to work out perfect.

These taste pretty good!  It's a simple recipe and everyone enjoys a break from the same old, same old chocolate chip cookie.  I would advise to check the cookies about 10 minutes into baking, as the 16 minute bake time was WAY too long in my oven.  I also added another teaspoon of orange zest for a little extra bite--though anymore would have resulted in a far too bitter taste.  Plus, I was very pleased how well these kept their shape on the baking sheet!  Nice recipe, thanks Rosina.

A a gal that's 20lbs overweight, I think I know a thing or two about cookies!Tastewise they were yummy but I personally had a few problems with them.  First, as most people before me already knew, 16 minutes is way too long. I always bake most cookies at 9 minutes and they come out nice and soft.  As well next time I'll be using baking soda instead of powder as that will also make them be a little softer.  Also, 1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips AND the cup of nuts seems to overload it a little...try 1 cup of the chips and 3/4 cup of nuts.  I also added an extra half cup of flour as the dough was pretty sticky.  This is all personal preference though so if you like your cookies a little harder and full of chocolate chips and nuts then by all means, follow the recipe!  All said and done...good taste but needed some tweaking.

JUST pulled these out of the oven not 5 minutes ago. All I can say is Mmmmmmmmmm! Not only are they delicious, but my whole house smells wonderful. I followed to recipe exactly and would not change anything. I used my micrograter to get the orange zest nice and fine. Will definetely make on a regular basis.
Thanks for sharing!!!!!!!

I used this recipe as a base recipe - what I was looking for was a tangy orange cookie  that would bake up like a chocolate chip cookie.  Success!  They were flavorful, chewy, crispy on the outside, and nicely orange-y.  I might add a tidbit of orange extract next time, but I think they were excellent.

I omitted the chocolate chips, and used the zest of two large oranges.  I also grated up 2 dark hershey's kisses and added them to the batter for a hint of chocolate and an interesting texture.  Phenomenal!

I haven't tried this yet, but I have a question. I never get zest right, so I was wondering could I replace that with a little bit of orange jam or marmalade?

I was so dissapointed in this recipe.  I could barely taste the orange.  On the first batch I followed the recipe faithfully. Thought it had too many c chips and no orange.   Just a beefed up choc chip cookie.   On the 2nd batch I added an extra 1 tsp of orange zest and 1 tbsp of orange extract and reduced c chips & pecans by 1/3.  Still couldn't really taste the orange.  Recipes with orange or any other citrus flavoring are so tricky.  Too little, no flavor, too much, bitter.    This recipe might work if you used choc chips infused with orange flavoring/liquor, but I won't bother to experiment.

these are yummy. i used penzey's orange peel (which you rehydrate before using), didn't use the pecans and accidentally forgot 1/3 of the chocolate chips (don't ask). they still came out fantastic -- not sure all those chips are even necessary. great, easy recipe!

Wow! These are delicious cookies! I just got them out of the oven, and they taste greaaat. ^_^ Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. I used two teaspoons of orange extract instead of orange zest, because I didn't have a zester. Even with that substitution, though, the cookies were delicious. ^_^ The consistency of the dough was great. The cookies were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I overbaked them a little... 20 minutes... and they came out slightly hard, but still delicious. I also forgot to grease the cookie sheets, so they stuck to the sheet slightly, but I didn't really have a hard time getting them off. Follow the recipe exactly. Thanks again! I will be baking these repeatedly.

These are very good cookies! I love the chocolate and orange together, makes them a little more 'sophisticated'. These are going to be a new addition to my holiday cookie tray,something a little out of the ordinary.

I used 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of one cup and they were still WAY too sweet. Also, they were soft (good) and kind of cakey (not so good), though I admit I may have overmixed the batter a little. If it weren't for the terrible sweetness, I think they would have been pretty good.

Great flavor, orange wasn't too strong. I almost added orange extract, glad I didn't. I left the nuts out. I added the rest of the bag of choc chips (a small handful more). My son and I liked these quite a bit, my husband did not. He prefers plain cc cookies without alterations, so he was not happy about these. Be warned, these do spread quite a bit and came out rather flat and crispy on the edges, chewy in the middles, similar to how the tollhouse recipe does only more so. I used margarine not butter. Too bad my husband didn't like these because I'd like to make them again. A nice twist on a cc cookie! Thanks.

These were delicious!  Interesting cookie for sure- I used almonds and they tasted really nutty.  Definitely go with the semisweet chocolate chips because it makes it taste like one of those chocolate oranges.  Really good texture.  They came out good in spite of my low-quality college oven. ;) I'll make these again, and I'm considering adding crasins.

These cookies are great as is, but I always enjoy my cookies softer and gooey than crunchy.  The way I got these to soften up is to substitute the white sugar with brown and they come out pretty soft and gooey through the middle.  I also tried using cranberry chocolate chips which went together very well.  YUM

I made a few modifications based on my own taste and what I had in the pantry.  I used 1 Tsp Orange Oil instead of the zest Left out the pecans and added an extra 1/3 cup of chips Added approx 1 Tbsp of 70% cocoa powder (based on another recipe I was looking at)  They turned out FABULOUS. So good! The chips I used were about 70% cocoa, too, so very dark. That combined with the orange and cocoa powder really nicely. A great, slightly "grown up" alternative to regular chocolate chip cookies, but one I think most kids would love just fine. :)

This cookie has good texture. I cut down the white sugar to 1/4 c. since I do not like my cookies too sweet. Adding more, even twice the amount, of orange zest would definitely have increased the 'yum factor' for this cookie. Also, personal taste, less chocolate chips would have worked better. I will make this cookie again with half the choc chips and twice the zest. Baking time - depends a lot on the oven and size of cookies. I needed the whole 15 minutes and even  a couple more.

Excellent cookies! I'm really into the orange flavor and next time will add more zest, but overall, I recommend them.

They taste really good except I almost burned them on the first batch, 15 minutes is too long and I should have followed other people's comments. I will add more orange zest next time too, maybe 2 and 1/2 table soon because I like more orange taste. Other than that, it's very good. Thank you so much for the recipe.

I have one big issue with this recipe: That it wasn't double to begin with :-) No, seriously - if you're like me and love the combination of chocolate and orange, these will be your favorite cookies from now on. I just can't understand why I haven't thought of this before!  
I baked them for 10 minutes - and that with my oven, that was enough. I cut back somewhat on the chocolate to about 150 grams. I think that was sufficient. Also, I used walnuts instead of pecans, and as the walnuts have a stronger flavor, I cut back on the amount here as well. The result was great, and I know I'll make these cookies again and again.
Thank you so much for sharing this awesome recipe!

Made these cookies last night and went exactly by the recipe except I used 1&1/2 tsp of orange extract instead of zest and didn't add nuts.  I was hoping that they would be thin and chewy and that's exactly how they turned out.  To me they were perfect. Just enough orange flavor and really chewy. I think the real trick for them to come out chewy is to let them cool on the baking sheet. I took some to my neighbor and all she could say when she bit into one was "Ummmmmm-ummmmmm- ummmmm"  I am going to use this recipe instead of the popular toll house cookie recipe for when I just want regular chocolate chip cookies  (with vanilla extract)they are so good.  I can't thank you enough for posting this recipe. I will be making these again and again.

Really delicious.  I added a half cup of craisins.  They were begging to be included, and it turned out great!  Pay attention to the "flatten slightly" part.  Makes a big difference.

These cookies are great and a nice change of pace to the regular chocolate chip.  I made the recipe as written and must say that I found the orange flavor to be perfect - faint, but definitely there.

Terrific cookies !  Just the right amount of orange to taste and even better with dark chocolate chips...did not use nuts, thought they would not add much to the orange / chocolate combination.  Also used 1 cup whole wheat flour and coconut oil. Will probably use more orange zest next time for some extra zing !

I loved these cookies!! The orange zest takes them from good chocolate chip cookies to something special!! I used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 regular, left everything else as written. The orange flavor is more pronounced the second day  :)

I used orange extract in place of orange peel and in addition to the chocolate chips I chopped up an orange flavored chocolate bar.  Very good.

Ugh! These cookies were terrible!! The orange made the choclate extra rich, so the cookies became sicking.  I would rather have a regular chocolate chip cookie.

YUM!! excellent recipe, and very easy to make too. i would reduce the sugar content by about a quarter though, as it was rather too sweet. i also reduced the amount of chocolate chips by a third, but that's just a personal preference.

Delicious orange chocolate flavor..however, next time I think I will use orange extract.  It was difficult to get the orange zest fine enough and it didn't have a strong enough orange flavor for my taste.  Good cookies though!

These cookies were delicious, the only change I made was the baking time, instead of 15 - 16 minutes, I baked 10 - 12 so that they would be a little more chewy with crispy edges. The orange zest really gave this cookie a delicious zing of flavor.

Made these according to the recipe and not only did I love them, my 3 year old grandson and 37 year old son DEMANDED I bring more the following week (they ate every single one I took them in one afternoon/evening) LOL.  Most excellent recipe.  Have made twice since and have turned out perfect every time.  Thank you so much for posting this recipe.  It's a keeper for me - and mine.  :-)

Followed all instructions except added orange syrup as well to enhance the orange flavor (1 tsp), and they still had more of a hint of orange then overpowering orange. I really like them. I have been watching the time: doing between 10-12 min.

These are one of my all-time favourite cookie recipes. They are a big hit both at home and at the office. I do however substitute the semi-sweet chocolate chips for Hershey's dark chocolate chips.
