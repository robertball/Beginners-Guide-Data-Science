This turned out good. I do think 1 onion and 1 bell pepper is plenty though. I used grape tomatoes and left them whole so that my husband could fish around them and enjoy the rest of the salad. I ended up adding more oregano to the mix after tasting and a little bit of basil too. This would be great for a picnic or potluck and it was so much better than the pasta salads that are smothered in mayo.
