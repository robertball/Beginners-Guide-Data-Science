this recipe was really good. I found for smaller recipes you can cut the rice down and cut the water down for the amount you cut in the rice and brocoli. For example cut the rice from 1 1/2 to 1 then you cut the water by half also and the brocoli by half and it evens out to make smaller portions so this would make a good dinner for 2 instead of for

While browning chicken I sprinkled meat with garlic salt, paprika, and some pepper. Remove meat. fry onion, add soup and water- used basmati rice. then cooked 15 min. added steamed broccoli and cooked for another 10. Really tasty, ordinary family fare.

I looked at a similar recipe that called for Cream of Chicken instead where I found some suggestions for this recipe. I pre-cooked some slow cook brown rice (for added nutritional value). I realized after I had put the water in that I didn't need as much since the rice was already cooked, so I scooped some off. If you use pre-cooked rice, use 1 cup of water. Then when we were eating it, we realized it needed something - cheese. That helped the flavor quite a bit. It was good, and I might make it again. It just needs to be played with a little more to make it a 4 or 5 star recipe.

This was very bland and didn't have flavor. There was way too much water to the point where the chicken was just sitting in water. My kids all didn't want to eat it. I don't mean to be rude and criticize anyone's recipe, but this one just wasn't right for my family of three very picky eaters. Maybe if there was much less water and more spices...

Bland, mushy, old-age home food. I added hot sauce to my plate, my son added garlic salt to his, and my daughter added parmesean cheese to hers -- none was an improvement.
