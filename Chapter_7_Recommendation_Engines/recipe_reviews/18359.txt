Before I made this dessert I read practically every review written and therefore, made the following changes: used 2 cans of apple pie filling mixed with 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg, whipped 8 oz of reduced-fat cream cheese with 1/2 cup powdered sugar and 1/4 tsp. cinnamon the mixed with the apple pie filling mixture (which I coarsely chopped with a knife and fork), reduced the water to 1/3 cup, added 1 Tbsp. cornstarch to the sauce along with 1/2 tsp. vanilla. I use five tortillas (that's how many mouths I'm feeding) and put the extra filling on top of the enchiladas. I found that even though the sauce looks thin after 3 minutes of cooking it thickens quickly as it sits. I usually put this together ahead of time in a 12x8" rectangular baking dish (and it just barely fits) and about 1 hour before time for dessert (my family likes to wait a little while after dinner) I pop it into the oven at 400 degrees for 40 minutes on the top rack. The result is a a thick sweet sauce and yummy crepe-like apple-filled dessert. Make sure to serve warm with vanilla ice cream it really complements this dessert. Anyway thanks for posting:) I've made this twice already and even with my changes it's incredibly easy to make and yummy.

A-MAZING dessert!! I made it for my inlaws and they love love loved it!!! The only difference i made was: adding a mixture of cream cheese and sugar into the middle of the tortilla before the apples. When we tried it, the cream cheese in it was soooooooo delicous! ive made it WITH and WITHOUT the cream cheese mixture, and its way better with it!! Also make sure to cook the enchiladas for a little longer than usual so that it gets a crispier crust. I highly recommend this!!!

I have used this recipe several times and love how quick and easy it is. I can put them in the oven just before we start eating dinner and desert is ready when we are. I have made it with both canned and fresh apples. Fresh apples are much better. I just sliced 4 small granny smith apples into small chunks and mixed them with 1/2 cup of sugar and a tablespoon of flour. Divide the apples between 5 tortillas and sprinkle with cinnamon before rolling them up. I also make this recipe with 1/3 cup of water and bake them at 350 for 40 minutes. The tortillas get nice and crunchy on top. They are great hot out of the oven with ice cream. We even love them the next day even though the tortillas get a little soggy on the bottom.

Outstanding! These enchiladas were absolutely incredible.  On the advice of other reviewers, I made my own filling (4 apples, 1/2c sugar, 1T flour, 1 tsp cinnamon), reduced the water for the syrup to 1/3 cup, and baked at 375 for 30 minutes.  It was delicious! Next time I will reduce the sugars to 1/3 cup each.

Very good recipe! Only problems that I had were:
Overall, a few guests mentioned that it was a bit too sweet. I guess I'll lower down on the sugar next time! 
TO FACILITATE THE FLOUR TORTILLA PROCESS, I microwaved my tortillas for about 8 seconds each. It made it a lot easier to handle.  Overall, WONDERFUL WONDERFUL RECIPE!!!!

This was wonderful.  Made it for a dinner party and served it warm with vanilla ice cream.  Delicious!  And leftovers were just as good the next night.  To keep the sauce from separating on standing, boil it longer than 3 minutes.  Turn off the heat only after everything has obviously melded and your sugars have broken down.  I made the sauce early in the day and re-heated just before popping in the oven.  I also prepared my enchiladas early in the day and then lay a damp paper towel over top (to keep the tortillas from drying out) and covered with saran wrap. I also baked for at least 40 minutes until they were nice and crispy.  This definitely tastes and presents like it is more work than it is!

This was great! I made it for a mexican-themed pot luck, and everyone raved about how good it was. I didn't tell them it was the easiest thing I brought! I made the syrup the night before, and per other reviews, reduced the water to 1/3 cup. The morning of, I rolled the tortillas, and when we got there I simply poured the cooled (and now thickened) syrup over, baked as directed, and enjoyed! I will definitely make these again.

Absolutely wonderful!!!  I took the advice from the other reviewers about the filling being bland, so I seasoned the canned apple filling with cinnamon, nutmeg, and butter, and it turned out great.  Like others, I also baked it with pecans on top, and used corn shells for some of them, as I ran out of flour shells.  The corn shells didn't taste as well as the flour, but it was still ok.   The only problem is that it was a little sweet, so next time I will use less sugar for the syrup that goes over the desert.  The flour tortillas didn't even taste like tortilla, but more like a crepe.  We had a Mexican fiesta, and everyone raved about it.  I have more flour tortilla shells, and apple filling, so I will make it again next week.  Thanks ReDonna for a great recipe.

For those who find this dessert a bit too runny...try adding about a tablespoon of cornstarch to the water.  I also made my own apple pie filling and added whipping cream to it. This turned out really good. It made enought to feed Custer's army, but every bite was gone. Tastes even better when you throw in a handful of walnuts.  Thanks ReDonna.

Wow - what an easy, yet fabulous dessert! It's a little like apple dumplings, but with a Southwestern twist using flour tortillas vs. crescent rolls.  You could easily change this up by using different pie fillings.  I stayed with the recipe and used apple pie filling and added some chopped fresh Granny Smith apples.  I also addd a little cornstarch to the sauce and it turned out perfect.  It smelled delicious and tasted even better - perfect with vanilla ice cream and a little whipped cream on top!

This is just lovely. I took others recommendations & made the sauce with 1/3 C. each of the brown & white sugar, and reduced the amount of water to 1/3 C. and added 1/2 t. vanilla (you really want to do this it it makes the sauce taste even more carmel-esque). Like others, I also mixed 8 oz. of  cream cheese w/ 1/4 C powdered sugar and spread that onto the tortillas prior to adding the apple mixture. I added 1T.very soft butter and 1/2 t. nutmeg as well as the 1t. cinnamon directly to the apple mixture.  I also tried this with peaches...I did everything the same except I added 1t. ground ginger (the bottle type you keep in the fridge) to the sauce. It was wonderful. Thanx for submitting!

I have got to give this recipe a 5 star rating because I've made it several times before, but tonight was another story.  I had this on the menu for supper for 15 people, 11 of them college kids.  2 of the kids were making them while I supervised.  They did a great job. They stuffed them and rolled them and drizzled them with sauce and sprinkled the cinnamon over them. The enchiladas were looking wonderful and when they came out of the oven we were so excited to eat them.  We scooped the ice cream on top, drizzled it with the sauce and served.  By the time I got mine I noticed that the kids were whispering.  I looked at my husband and he said "they think it tastes like chicken".  WHAT?  Apple enchiladas sprinkled with cinnamon can't taste like chicken...not if you sprinkle them with cinnamon.  Did you know that cinnamon and cumin look exactly like?

I took different comments from each reviewer and created the best recipe. I used the cream cheese with the powdered sugar. I cut both sugars and water to 1/3. I used a 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla in the caramel mixture and I added nutmeg and Cinnamin to the apple mixture. Most reviewers said that they wanted a crisp texture. I got it!! I took the cream mixture an the apple filling and placed it into the 6in wraps. I used a baking rack that I placed into a pan just in case   the apple filing came out. I based the tortillas with olive oil and I also 
lined the pan with non stick foil. I placed the tortillas in the oven until 
they got to the crisp texture that I was looking for (may have been 
around 15-20 min). Once removed from the oven, I placed the tortillas into the pan onto the non stick foil. I took the caramel sauce 
and drizzled around 2 to 3 spoonfuls onto each one and placed back 
into the oven for another 10 mins. I used the filing that came out onto
 the foil and placed it on top along with more drizzle of caramel 
sauce and added extra creamy vanilla ice cream. I also added a pinch of cornstarch and also used less butter than what it called for. I also added some caramel sauce that is used for dipping apples. This came out perfect!! Crisp and the sauce was just right.

My new standby dessert. Quick, easy ingredients, and taste like heaven on a plate. I did make changes but only because my Dad is a severe diabetic. I used SF Apple Pie filling, SF brown sugar, and Splenda (I cut that back to 1/4 cup as I didn't want it too sweet). My boyfriend and I devoured ours with Lite Real Whip Cream and he said he didn't even know it was sugar free. Dad had his later on with SF vanilla ice cream and said he loved it. There was enough for each of us to have one each and leftover for the next night. Perfect dessert and perfect amount! Thank you so much. It's hard to make sugar free things sometimes that taste the same as "normal". This was just what we needed so that I can serve to all.

The apple filling I used was good and we love brown sugar and cinnamon, but I think it would have been much better with pie crusts/dough.  The tortillas made this dessert a little plain.  It is very easy to put together, but out of 6 of us, none of us liked the end result.  It was also too buttery and I don't think water is needed.  It would have been better gooey instead of runny.  Sorry.

I made this for the first time for a Mexican pot luck at work. I used 2 cans pie filling mixed with 2 teaspoons of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg. I made the sauce the night before using only 1/3 cup water and I added some vanilla and cinnamon. The next day at work I rolled the apples in the tortillas and poured over the sauce and baked in a 13x9 pan at 375 for about 40 minutes. They turned out crispy and fabulous!! I put out vanilla ice cream, whip cream and powdered sugar with the dessert. I cut each tortilla into 3 pieces and left them in the pan. Everyone loved them!!

This recipie works great in a crock pot. I followed the advice of others and made my own filling (6 cups chopped golden delicious apples, 1/2 cup sugar, 3 Tbsp water and a little cinnimon). I filled the shells and layered them in a crock pot for the next day. I reduced the water in the syrup to 1/3 cup per the other reviews and stored it seperately. A couple of hours before lunch I poured on the syrup and cooked the enchiladas on low. They were a huge hit! So yummy!

This dessert takes no time at all to prepare. I used the canned apple pie filling for convenience.  Many reviews suggested the sauce was too thin, so I cut the water back to 1/4 cup and it seemed perfect.  Baking time was increased to approximately 30-35 minutes and I did dot the enchiladas with butter, hoping to get a crispier crust.  This worked as well. Thanks for the great recipe.

These were fantastic! I added a little chopped walnuts on top just for a little extra flavor. I also filled some with Cherry pie filling and they were still great. Everyone at my dinner party loved them!!!!

Doubled the apples and added cream cheese to the mixture. Like others, I did only use 1/3 cup water and added a little vanilla to the sauce. This is very good! My hubby never wants me to make apple pie again! It does need to be eaten up all at once because it does get soggy. Great recipe!!

OUTSTANDING!  And so quick and easy too!  Hubby wanted taco salad for dinner, so I decided to look for a "mexican dessert" to top it off.. I came across this one (AGAIN... I have seen it several times, but had never gotten around to making it)... I will tell you, I am not so much a huge apple fan (except for apple dumplings, YUM), but hubby is... so I decided to make it for him... the thing is, with the syrup and all this tastes SO MUCH like an apple dumpling, but with a FRACTION of the work!  Only thing I did different, was I went ahead and used the whole stick of margarine (1/2 c instead of 1/3) just because I didn't want to deal with the other small piece left over, lol... and another recipe said to let it sit in the syrup for 30 minutes before baking, so I let mine sit for about 20 minutes or so... oh yeah, and I found the 8x8 pan to be too small, so I ended up using an 11X7 pan and it was the prefect size!  Try this with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and you will love it!! Oh... and one other thing.. you really don't have to DO all that other stuff and modify this recipe... it is PERFECT AS IS :) (keep it simple)

This was WONDERFUL!  I used fresh apples - sliced and sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar, and added @1Tbsp butter - i then microwaved until desired tenderness.  I then followed the advise of other reviewers and added cornstarch and powdered sugar.  For the topping I followed the directions.  They turned out golden brown.  will definitely make again.

It was a good dessert and very easy to put together with very few ingredients.  You really need to serve with vanilla ice cream.  I think a tad of cream cheese rolled in the tortilla with the apples would be delicious.

This was awesome. I made my own apple filling (just sliced apples, flour, sugar and cinnamon) as I didn't have any canned. It was great. Next time I would cut my apples smaller so that it is easier to wrap them in the tortilla without ripping it. Definitely a keeper and very easy.

Taste great!! And made the house smell sooooo good. Great alternative to apple pie. I used a 13x9 inch pan and it came out fine.

This is delicious! They taste like apple pie! I used slightly less of both sugars and water, and I boiled the topping much longer than recommended in order to produce a thicker sauce.  The enchiladas should be served hot, however, because when the caramel sauce cools, it hardens like a rock and is difficult to eat! Also, be sure to use small tortillas- the large ones are way too big, and look awkward when cut in half, as well as being harder to handle. On the whole, great! Thanks!

This is quick and easy and good. The best thing for me is, I now have something to do with those leftover tortillas we always have going to waste in the fridge. Definitely worth making.

Love this! I used two cans of filling, with cinnamon and nutmeg, and added a cream cheese/sugar mix to the enchilada first! Everyone gave this rave reviews!

A wonderful dessert to complete a mexican themed dinner or any dinner. We all loved this one. I think I will be making this a lot. The only change I made was that I used butter and wheat tortillas. Six rolled up tortillas did not fit in my 8x8 pan, so I had to put 2 of them on top. That didnt make a difference to the final outcome, but next time I will use a 9x13 pan and double my recipe. I am thinking these will be even better tomorrow - we will see.

This is such a great recipe; minimum prep time and maximum
payoff. I followed other reviewer's recommendations and cut the
water in the sauce to 1/3 cup, which worked well. I also increased
the baking time to 40 minutes as others have suggested, but that
was a mistake. It gave the tortillas a crispy top, but it turned the
filling to rubber. I made it again, baking it for 20 minutes as per
the recipe's instructions, and it was much better, to me. A great
Mexican dessert. Five stars and highly recommended!

When I made this recipe, my mom went out and bought tortillas that were bigger than 8 inches, but that was no problem! When spreading the apple pie filling onto the tortillas, make sure you use your spoon to slice the pieces even smaller. Make sure there is 1-2 inches space on the left side, so when you fold right to left, there are no big chunks that almost fall out. I suggest microwaving the butter for approx. 5 seconds, for it was thick and chunky starting to mix in with the sugars and water. Make sure you use every bit of the sugar-butter topping, even when it pours into a pool covering the whole pan, for it simmers and makes your house smell good as well as cooking the enchiladas especially well =)

I made this recipe for Cinco de Mayo.  I am the "Lunchroom Lady" at my son's school.  I scaled it to make for 100.  I read the reviews and made my sauce the night before using less water.  On Monday, I simply reheated the sauce and put the tortillas together.  I used pecans (I am from the South where pecans are part of the food pyramid!).  The kids and teachers/staff went wild!  Thanks ReDonna for sharing such a wonderful recipe!

This was super easy to make.  I was skeptical at first about using flour tortillas.  But it tastes great!  My kids also wondered if I was okay, when I said I was making "Apple Enchiladas," they loved it!!!

I would love to try the cream cheese filling ones.  

Easy to prepare, great tasting!  Tortillas were crispy but not tough. 

Overall I love it and will definitely be making it again.

This was great!! I took it to Mexican night at the cooking club I belong to and got rave reviews from women who love food and love to cook. I also took a pan to the theater where my husband was performing and they wiped them out before they went on stage. I will definitly fix these again!!

This is absolutely awesome!  The taste is fabulous, it's sooooo easy, and everyone loves it (especially a la mode).  The one thing I might change, if I had the time, is instead of using tortillas, I might make crepes, as the tortillas were a bit tough to cut.  But it was definately worth it, and it cuts the time in half.

I've made this twice. The first time it came out really well, and everyone liked it. The second time, the tortillas were really tough. The difference was the kind of tortillas I used. The time it came out well, I used freshly made specialty store tortillas - and some from Trader Joe's, as well, to compare. They were both good. The time the tortillas came out tough, I used Mission brand tortillas from the grocery store. Be sure to start with good, fresh tortillas.

I made my own apple pie filling from this site and it was wonderful too.  Made these apple enchillada for my family to go with my own chicken enchilladas recipe.  They turned out great!  I didn't use the cream cheese as so many others did as the chicken enchilladas are so rich.  The family loved these will definately make again!

My daughter and I were so looking forward to this dessert--it smelled great--but what a dud. We followed the custom recipes and added whipped sweetened cream cheese but it was lost in the apple pie filling. The "sauce" turned into caramel when cool and was virtually nonexistent. This was basically alot of soggy, hard to eat flour dough with very little flavor or texture. Even topping it with Haagen Daaz Vanilla Ice Cream didn't save it. If I'm going to blow my diet, I'd choose a 1000 other desserts before this one. Save the calories for something better.

This recipe had potential, but the sauce was a negative. It was very thin and watery on the stove, even though I cut the water to 1/3 cup, however, after being in the oven 40 mins (based on many reviews from others), it was so hard and sticky that it could have easily yanked a filling or two out! If I ever make again, bring sauce to a slow, low boil rather than fast. I added cornstarch to thicken it as I was cooking, but now I wonder if that's what made it too hard upon baking.  The apple filling was delicious! I followed reviewers' advice and mixed the apple w/ 1tsp cinn. and 1/2 tsp nutmeg with 8oz cream cheese and 1/2c powdered sugar whipped in w/ my mixer.  The flour tortilla was delicious too. This would have been amazing if the sauce had turned out right, but it may have been my error.  I mentioned my changes and possible mistakes to help others avoid them. :-)

My husband made this for Mexican Potluck at work and everyone raved about it. The only bad thing is that it was almost all gone before he got a taste! Only one complaint... that it didn't contain enough cinnamon ~ will add more next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is great! I do make my own variation of it, though.  I add melted caramels (or caramel ice cream topping) to each enchilada.  Instead of the water, sugar topping I make this: 8 oz pkg of cream cheese, milk, caramel, melt until smooth.  (May need to continuing adding milk).  Pour over top and bake, saving some, for the ice cream!

Fabulous dessert indeed! No cornstarch was needed, neither was the syrup runny. I only used a tat less water. I let it sit for a while before serving and it did the trick. Since it's meant to be a sweeeet dessert, it wouldn't make a difference using a drop less water. I cooked my own apple filling, chunky, with very little  sugar. I ran out of cinnamon so I used nutmeg. It still turned out beautiful. All the sweet syrup compensated the sourness of the apple filling. BEAUTIFUL. Next time I'll try puff/filo pastry. Thank you ReDonna.

Not bad! I was expecting the sauce to be thicker, like a caramel sauce... but it has great flavor! It's easy too!!

Very good. I used 6 inch flour tortillas -- which was plenty big for a serving size. Also used homemade apple pie filling. Very good - a little runny.

Very good. Instead of commercial pie filling I used Apple Pie Filling II on allrecipes. Added a couple teaspoons of cream cheese/powered sugar mix along center of tortilla before filling, and (figuring it already had enough sugar) only made about 1/2 of the sauce. Served warm with vanilla ice cream it was a big hit.

THESE ARE AWESOME!!!!! I invited my parents over for a Mexican-themed dinner last night & needed a dessert to go w/ it. I have been eyeing this recipe for some time now (it was featured in a magazine I picked up at my local grocer a few yrs. ago; one of the "I have no time 2 cook during the holiday's" meal idea articles in it suggested an easy-fix menu - white chili, guac & this dessert). After seeing this recipe, I knew I HAD to try it - and this did not disappoint!!! I usually read the reviews for any recipe I'm planning to try, but ran out of time, so I didn't. I really wish I would have. Don't get me wrong, these were great. I just think they could have been 5 *'s, had I tried the most helpful reviewer's sugg. for improvement (I will next time!). Here are the comments I feel are CRITICAL: a) use 1/3 c. H2O (it seems like this amt. does the trick, otherwise, you'll end up w/ a thin sauce like I did... ), b) coarsely chop your pie filling mixture (personal preference after having not done so), c) bake for dbl. the amt. of time called for to get a "crisp" text. (mine were slightly crisp, verging on soggy), d) save some of your pie filling as topping, & e) personally, I think using 6 in. tortillas would have worked better than the 8 in. ones (if you can find them); otherwise, cut these in 1/2. Served w/ a scoop of Starbuck's caramel macchiato ice cream & warm coffee. All I can say is WOW! Thanks SOOO much for sharing, ReDonna. You made me look like rock star once again! :-)

I was very eager to try this recipe and I was NOT disappointed! It was sooooo yummy! I made 5 with apple pie filling and cinnamon and 5 with cherry pie filling and cream cheese filling (4oz cream cheese and 1/4 cup sugar). They were to die for! I doubled the glaze/syrup since I doubled the recipe and that was not needed. Everything still fit in a 13x9 so I only ended up using half of it!

Wow! OK, I was kinda skeptical of this recipe at first. But, I had some tortillas that I needed to use up, and a couple of apples (I made my own apple pie filling), and they really turned out awesome! I followed the recipe very close. Aside from using a homemade filling, I used Smart Balance for the margarine. I was worried, because the sauce looked thin, but it is perfect. Also, I drizzled the "enchiladas" with some of the sauce that was in the pan after baking, then put them in for a couple more minutes. I will totally make this again! YUM! :)

This was very good. I took the advice of the other reviews and cut down the brown sugar to 1/3 cup but kept the white sugar at about the same. I also added a few dashes of nutmeg and 1 tsp of real vanilla. I cut up 2 granny smith apples, steamed them in the mic and added a little sugar, then added to the canned apple filling. We served it warm with vanilla ice cream. Everyone really like this. It's a keeper and tastes great for breakfast. ;)

Excellent and Easy!  I followed some previous reviewers' suggestions and cut the water to 1/3 cup, and broiled for a few minutes after dessert was done baking. I spooned only about 1/2 of the syrup mixture onto the enchiladas, then mid-way through baking I spooned about 1/4 more, discarding the final 1/4.  These turned out restraunt-quality!  Nice crispy top, sweet apple cinnamon flavor. Served 1/2 enchilada with about 1/4 cup of Vanilla Frozen Yougurt with some sauce spooned on top of it. Delicious! Will be sharing this recipe with the family!

This tasted delicious! I made it for a Mexican themed party, too, and everyone loved it. The only problem I had was the tortillas were a bit tough. Maybe it was the brand I used. I made the recipe like it was printed except I added 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg & one teaspoon of lemon juice to the apple pie filling, along with the 1 teaspoon of cinnamon that the recipe called for. I also added 1 tablespoon of corn starch to the butter/sugar sauce to thicken it. I had it all put together before I went to the party, and then just cooked it for 30 minutes when I got there. I'm glad that I made the little changes to the recipe...the dessert turned out perfect!

Great recipe. I have made this several times and what a hit. The last time I made it, I prepared it a  day ahead and keep it in the frig. Then I  cooked it a few minutes longer until hot and bubbly. I think it tasted even better. 
Thanks Donna

Very easy to make, although I like extra cinnamon on top for eye appeal, and use the smaller tortillas for a nicer presentation. Even my fussy husband liked them!!

I'm giving this 5 stars for ease of preparation and yummy taste.  I used dehydrated apple slices instead of canned pie filling.  I simmered the apples slices in water that had been sweetened with a little brown sugar and cinnamon.  Then I drained the apples and used them in the flour tortillas instead of the canned pie filling.  The glaze is an important part of this recipe. I think this recipe would be good with a little cream cheese icing spread on top while still hot.  This is so much easier than making an apple pie.

We thought this was great!  The only complaint I have is the sauce, it is a little thin, but still good.  I used the Desert Crepes recipe (from this site) instead of the tortilla shells.  Thanks ReDonna!

Very easy to make and quite good.  I've found to cut down on the sweetness a hearty smear of cream cheese on the tortilla does the trick. I've  added the cream cheese to the can of pie filling, and that works well, too. I agree with the rest that the sauce could be thicker.  Definitely serve with vanilla ice cream!!!

My 11 yr old granddaughter decided she wanted to make this for fathers day dessert. It was amazing!! We had it warm with cool whip first. Then later that night we had a second helping cold and it was AMAZING!! She wants to try it again with ice cream and caramel syrup on it. I can't wait!!

I made this using blueberry pie filling and the cream cheese mixture as suggested in some of the reviews.  This was an awesome recipe.  My husband raved about it.  Took this to a family breakfast and everyone wanted the recipe.  It was quick and easy to prepare. I did let it bake longer to make it crisper, about 10 to 15 min longer.

Very good.  I made this for a mexican dinner we were having at work.  I was worried about it being a little bland, so I beat two cream cheese with 3/4 cup sugar and tsp of vanilla.  I then stirred in the apple pie filling and filled with that.  I ended up making two large ones for work and used cherry pie filling for one and did the same thing with the cream cheese.  Everyone loved it!

These were ok...I was too lazy to make the caramel sauce, so in the pantry I had a jar of Smuckers apple and cinnamon sauce that I had bought months ago...so poured that over them. I will probably give them another try using the caramel. I can't say I was crazy about them but they were ok for something a little different.  Oh yea, served them with crushed vanilla bean ice cream...now that made them even better!!  lol

My son tends to grumble about my cooking efforts (or anyone else's, for that matter), but he couldn't say enough about this one.  He even thanked me for it, as he was heading off to bed!  That's a first, I'll tell you.

Since my husband and I tend to like our apple pies more spicy than usual pie filling allows, I added another teaspoon of cinnamon, and a few shakes of nutmeg... but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.

Home run, ReDonna!

I followed the recipe exactly, but used a 7.5-x-9.5 in. dish instead. It was fabulous. My husband really loved it too. So much that he asked me to make it again a few days later. I ran out of the thicker, generic brand tortillas I used the first time and had to use thinner Azteca tortillas -- these turned a bit gummy. I'll make sure to use thicker tortillas in future attempts.

I made this for a Mexican food-themed birthday party in lieu of a birthday cake for my office. I spooned the recomended 1 can of filling onto the recomended 6 tortillas, but alas it was not nearly enough, so I went to the store and bought a second can. It was perfect! I also read the review and used 1/3 cup of water instead of 1/2 cup. We served it with vanilla ice cream and people couldn't say enough good things! My favorite comment was "How can you be a newlywed and a good cook?!" i just said it was a ridiculously easy recipe! :)

I was craving something sweet and this definitely hit the spot! It is VERY sweet and filling. Definitely need to bake them longer than 20 minutes if you want them at all crispy. Served topped with whipped cream. Very easy (and cheap) dessert.

This recipe was so easy and delicious. It wasn't overly sweet either, despite the sugar & cinnamon added. Very light, delicious dessert. I'll definitely make it again.

This was awesome!!! I did one pan apple and one pan cherry for a large family gathering. I cut each one in half because the crowd was large. These were the only two desserts totally gone at the end of the night. Then the fight came out as to which was better: apple or cherry? I vote cherry but Grandma went with apple. It really doesn't matter to most, but I am to bring it to every family get togeather for now on!! That says it all to me! And it was one of the most easy things I have ever made:) Thanks for having this recipe out there!!

Really good recipe.The only change I made was using 1/3 C water.I did place under broiler to crispen up a bit.
Vanilla ice cream on top at the end a real must.Will make again.

I made these using peach pie filling, and as someone had suggested used only 1/3 cup of water.They were absolutely wonderful! Before serving, I drizzled with carmel topping and sprinkled some chopped walnuts on top. Got SO many compliments! Thanks so much for a great, easy, different dessert recipe.

This recipe was so easy to make although the syrup you pour over is a little to thin. I modified it by puting only a 1/4 cup of water and the syrup turned out just right. My family loves it.

I've made this twice and used cherry pie filling instead both times (it's what I had).  We all think they taste delicious.  I hadn't thought to reduce the water in the sauce recipe, but it seems like a good idea b/c it was a little runny.  But once you put a bite in your mouth, who cares!  It still tastes great!  Very easy - I'd suggest letting tortillas come to room temperature if you keep them in the refrigerator b/c they tend to crack when still cold.

Oh my goodness!  I wasn't sure about this recipe, but I needed a quick and easy dessert for a company Tex-Mex Pitch-in.  I made 2 different types, peach & blueberry, and to save time I used carmel ice cream sauce instead of making the carmel syrup.  I recieved rave reviews from all.  Will be making this again as it is incredibly quick & easy.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Mmmm... these are so good. I made my own apple pie filling (I microwaved 6 peeled & sliced apples 10 minutes, then stirred in 1/3 c flour, 1/3 c sugar, t cinnamon, 1/2 t nutmeg). I could only fit 5 tortillas in the 8x8 pan. I love the sauce- sweet and buttery!

Delicious, but a lot of dessert. You need a group to finish these off. Very sweet, rich and delicious apple taste. They remind me of McDonald's apple pie.

Wonderful!

This recipe could not have been easier or more tasty. I don't do desserts, because baking is really not my forte. But when I was making Mexican food for guests, I decided to try something simple. We used applie pie filling but want to try mixing pie and cherry next time. Thank you!!

This has been a great hit every time I've brought it to a potluck! Very orginal. Perfect for a mexican fiesta potluck.

Very easy to make. You need a sharp knife to cut it when you serve it so you don't squish it.

Delicious!

I made this dessert for a Mexican carry-in lunch at work and I heard the following comments: "Wow, this is wonderful!", "Awesome", and "These are great".  They just might have been the best dish there.
The only change I made to the recipe was to cook them a little bit longer than 20 min.  I let them sit overnight and then warmed them for about 10 min. before lunch.  They were a hit!

This was really good and different. I used my own apple filling. I thought the sauce was too watery (maybe from using fresh apples.) It was difficult cutting through bottom of these. I may use bigger pan next time for more even cooking and will also thicken sauce. Maybe try it with the canned apples as stated. It still had a wonderful flavor. Thanks ReDonna!

ReDonna you have a great dessert in the making!
I followed your directions but decided to make the
apple filling from scratch, since I do not care for the canned flavor. The sauce needs to be a bit
thicker and serving it with ice cream, a little bit of Kalhua (coffee liqueur) and pecans made it
just perfect in our book (cookbook). 
Now...let's talk about the name...why ENCHILADAS???
They are really sweet tacos or crepas (crepes),
since you did not use any chile in the recipe.
Your dessert is making believers out of a lot of
husbands who do not care for sweets. Great job!!

This recipe is GREAT!!!  My 12-year old son made it for a Mexican-themed Boy Scout gathering.  He tripled it and made it with both the apple and cherry pie filling.  Several of the other moms asked him for the recipe.  Everyone raved over it!!

This recipe is so very easy, and inexpensive, too!  I make it when we have a Mexican themed dinner, and it is a big hit.  Very good served warm topped with some heavy whipping cream, whipped cream, or some vanilla ice cream.

I'm a huge sweets eater but even this was too sweet for me.  I think the concept was good but the sauce just had too much sugar in it.  Adding a scoop of ice cream on top would probably help cut the edge off the sweetness.

I was craving some sort of apple desset tonight and stumbled upon this little gem. It is incredible! I used 2 fresh Eastern apples, mixed with 1/8 cup sugar and 1 tbsp flour and the tsp of cinnamon. I cut the sugars for the sauce in half and probably could have cut even more. I baked it for 30 minutes at 350. absolutely, insanely delicious. Thank you for the recipe!

PS - I made just the sauce and poured it over some fresh peaches and vanilla ice cream. SO INCREDIBLY DELICIOUS!

I used 8 small apples sauteed with 2 tbsps brown sugar, 1/4 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 c apple juice for the pie filling. This filled 8 seven inch whole wheat tortillas. For the syrup I used 1 tbsp butter, 1/4 c each brown and white sugar, 1/4 c water, 1/4 tsp cinnamon and a splash of vanilla. We really enjoyed this with vanilla ice cream.

This is the first time I've reviewed a recipe on allrecipes.com although I use the site all the time.  This recipe was AMAZING.  I made them for a cinco de mayo party, and they were super easy.  My friends raved about them... I didn't realize how good they were until I tasted them after the party... and I felt like I had a little bit of heaven.  Next time I'm going to try to make them a little bit healthier by using fresh apples.  Also, I increased the baking time to 30 minutes. Other than that, I wouldn't change anything!

This was a simple recipe that was absolutely delicious. I took the time to read most of the reviews and the only changes I made were reducing water to 1/3 cup and bringing the caramel sauce to a boil very slowly, let boil the full 3 minutes stirring the entire time, then pouring over the enchiladas and allowing it to stand about 15 minutes before putting into the oven set at 375 for 25 minutes. Cinnamon ice cream goes really well with the Apple Enchiladas. Will be making it again this coming weekend.

Cooked for our "Mexican Night" for a dessert that I was supposed to bring. It was a big hit! Doubled recipe. Quick and Easy! I did turn the oven up to 450 after they cooked for 20 min. just to brown the top. Had to e-mail everyone this recipe.

This dessert is wonderfully easy to put together and SO delicious.  Definitely a keeper.  The only change I made was adding the cream cheese as some others have done.  Thanks for sharing this with us!

Good flavor!  I did make several changes that previous reviewers suggested.  I used homemade apple filling using 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and 1 tsp cinnamon, and mixed it with 1 cup of softened cream cheese that was combined with 1/4 cup of white sugar.  For the sauce I used butter (we don't like margarine), the two sugars, 1 Tbsp cornstarch, 1/3 cup water, and a 1/2 tsp of vanilla to finish off after the syrup was cooked.  Baked it all for 40 minutes at 400 degrees F.  The tortillas were a little chewy but the flavor was yummy!  I'm going to try this again next week but try using the baking temperature and time originally suggested.

Flavour was good (with the cream cheese added) but not a fan of the tortilla shell. Will try with puff pasty or philo next time.

DELICIOUS!!!! I added raisins and put it under the broiler for about 3 minutes after cooking to give it a crispy crust. YUM! I will definitely be making this again! My mom gave it her stamp of approval too!

THESE WERE FANTASTIC & SO VERY EASY!  Needed a mexican type dessert for a 4th grade Mexican themed event at school for my son.  He and I prepped these the night before school.  In the morning we baked them for about 30-35 minutes (our preference) to have them warm upon arrival at school.  This dessert was a hit with the children and teachers.  WE WILL CERTAINLY BE MAKING THEM AGAIN!!!    Note-  I pretty much followed the recipe but also as other reviewers have advised also tweaked it by using 2 cans of apple filling instead of one, spreading a little cream cheese on the flour tortilla before adding the apple filling.  Also added a bit of vanilla to the apple filling.  Right before baking drizzed both the sauce and a tiny bit of carmel topping!  Really delicious and the family wants these on the 4th of July using some real apples and French Vanilla ice cream.  I'm all for it because I can prepare this ahead of time and bake!  ENJOY!!!!

I made these for my husband who isn't a big dessert person and we LOVED them! I added cream cheese with a little bit of oj, powdered sugar, cinnamon, and walnuts. It was delicious.  I put it in the oven for about 45 min for a little extra crunch. I added walnuts on top and used cinnamon sugar tortillas. He kept saying that it tasted like something from Chili's! Make sure you serve with ice cream. Amazing and so easy to make. Love It!

These are great for a few reasons: they're DELICIOUS; they're EASY; and they're BEAUTIFUL! They are so incredibly sweet that (depending on size) half is perfect. I also baked longer than directed for more crisp tortillas. Will definitely experiment with different fillings.

Yum Yum, what is great is that you can make your own filling.  This is almost like fruit pie without the fuss of a crust!  The first time I used a mix of  pears, apples, and strawberries which I boiled up first, then added a bit of sugar and cornstarch to thicken to the consistency of pie fill. I have since made this a few times with just apples.  For the topping I replace the water and all but 2 T of the butter with apple cider for less fat. I have also topped with a crumb topping that is made for fruit pies.  Serve hot or cold, with or without icecream &/or whipped topping.  The whole family likes these.

From other reviews, I cooked the 'gravy' a little longer so it wasn't too thin, so that was good.  I also followed others takes and added the cream cheese with powdered sugar.  I chunked fresh apples and coated them with cinnamon and sugar, rolled and threw in the oven.  OMG, they were sooooo good.  Not too sweet, we ate with Reddi Wip.

Hubby and I agreed that this has the potential for greatness, with a little tweaking. The sauce was too runny for our tastes so, next time I will thicken it up with a little cornstarch prior to pouring it over the tortillas. Also, I could maybe cut back a little on the sugar.

OK, so I felt like a cheater making a dessert from a can, but it was nice to have something quick and easy for dessert when I had some friends over for dinner. It was a hit! I can only imagine how much better it would be with fresh apples. YUM! I give this 5-stars for the wonderful taste (making recipe AS WRITTEN) and ease.

Delicious, but very sweet (and I have a voracious sweet tooth).  For a tasty variation, add a smear of Cream Cheese to the inside of the tortilla when preparing.

I will make my own pie filling next time so I can pick my apples and cut back on the sweetness, but I will make this again.

I thought this was really good, and like other reviewers have said, really sweet! I too used only 1/3 cup water in the sauce, and boiled it for a few extra minutes. I also made mt own apple filling, and baked it for 20 minutes at 375 and it was nice and crispy on top and hot, but the apples weren't as soft as I would have liked. Next time I think I'll cook them a little seperately before I put them in the enchiladas. But it was still fantastic and I got lots of compliments from my dinner guests! I'll be making this again!

Couldn't believe how easy these were. Present beautifully, and are very tasty.   Going to try again with real apples, as opposed to the pie filling.

Good Stuff!! I did read other reviews and took their advice and cooked the sugar mixture longer (6 minutes), let it cool completely before putting it on top of the flour tortillas, and I had to bake it for 35 minutes before the tops started to brown. Next time I will move the pans to the top rack because the bottoms got a little "done," but overall this was a great recipe.

We liked these.  I made the apple filling with some Granny Smiths and we also used whole grain tortillas (because that's what we normally buy).  Maybe they would be better with flour tortillas.  The caramel sauce was great.

Everyone loved this! I followed the advice and did 1/3 cup of water,

also I used apple pie filling, as well as a few slices of real apple.

We used Cool Whip as I didn't have ice cream in the freezer and it worked great.

Very good, but 2 things I think even for me was to sweet and as far as a dessert it was very hard to cut.  Very easy to prepare.  I think next time i will use unsweetened apple filling for the sauce makes it sweet enough. Thanks.

YUMMMMM!!! This is such a quick alternative to homemade apple pie.  Made this on a whim last night, had all the ingredients and it came together so quick.  It was wonderful, however, I am not a fan of canned pie filling and decided next time I will dice up the apple slices from the filling so they are not so noticeable.  The sauce was great and you must eat this with ice cream.

My DH & I loved this recipe, makes a nice breakfast treat and dessert, too. I prepared it before going to bed. So when I woke up late, I decided to preheat oven to 400 degrees, and baked for 20 minutes. I had added raisins and used a can of light apples. Sprinkled a little cinn-sugar on inside. We also reheated them for dessert and served with some butter pecan ice cream. I like my enchiladas golden & crispy, so the 400 degree oven works well for that. I basted them midway through the baking process. Delicious sauce, too!

Served this last night with vanilla ice cream, and even after the raves over the other food everyone was impressed. One suggestion would be less water in the sauce as it was a little runny.

Ive made this and rated it before and thought it was good, but agreed that the tortillas were a bit tough.
I fix this dish by putting on a granite slab in my grill as soon as I pull off what Ive just cooked, then let it cook in the grill while we eat and relax a little.  About 30 minutes.  This last time ... we didnt eat it and I ended up keeping it in the fridge till the next night, and re-heating it on the grill again.  This made this dish !!!  In short, make it and re-heat it.  The tortillas are perfect.

My tortillas got dry and chewy and the sugar burned alittle on the side. This could be due to my very old and crappy oven from the 70s though. I recommend watching it carefully...

Absolutely delicious, and so easy to make!  People at work keep asking me to "make it again", which I have done several times. Tastes like apple pie without the hassle of making a pastry crust. Definitely a keeper.

WONDERFUL!!  This is my husbands favorite.  Of course he looked at my funny when I said something about "apple enchilades" but these are now on the top of his "please make" list. I have also taken a larger version of this to a potluck. Everyone loved it.  

Instead of the canned pie filling I use this filling. 
http://pie.allrecipes.com/AZ/ApplePieFilling.asp  Since it is in my freezer, it is just as easy and tastes so much better.

It was an overwhelming hit with us and our company last night! I did a fresh peach/blue berry combo that was to die for. My caramel sauce came out perfect. Nice and gooey and thick. I boiled it until I got the consistancy I wanted. It's just a matter of reducing it. Served with ice cream and we were in heaven. One of our guests wanted to lick the plate! 5+++ For all the yummy noises we all made!

I made this for a Mexican-theme party.  The guests said the dessert was quite tasty however I used only half the syrup based upon previous reviews.  I took the extra syrup along with the dessert so guests could more if they desired.  If I make this again, I will add cornstarch to thicken the syrup or only used half like I did this time and take the rest with me.  This is such a quick and easy dessert.

We thought these were pretty good.  I left out the white sugar all together and whisked a couple of teaspoons of cornstarch in the water to thicken the sauce enough so it wouldn't make the tortillas soggy and served with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream.

This was very, very tasty!  I received many compliments on it!  I was a bit concerned with how it would turn out when using flour tortillas, but it was fantastic.  When I made this, I cut back on the water (1/3 cup instead of 1/2), added pecans (1/2 cup or so) and additional cinnamon to spice up the apple pie filling.   When it was finished baking, I cut the enchiladas in half so it served 12.  The portions were perfect, not to big and not too small.  I highly recommend this!

My husband said it was the best dessert I ever made.  I reduced the water to 1/3 cup as others had suggested.  Will definitely make this again.

OMG! This is the BOMB!  Tried it tonight for the first time and it's fab ~ I used Promise Ultra margarine as a way to cut some of the fat and it still came out great.  Next time, I'm going to use I Can't Believe It's Not Butter Spray, since it's fat free and what my taste buds have now become accustomed to.  :)  EASY AS 1-2-3!

Absolutely to DIE FOR!!! Tsese are so DELICIOUS and easy, and everyone whose had them only complains about the restraint they hav eto exercise not to eat more! Used fresh apples with a juice and brown sugar concoction every time since i made them both times in europe and couldn't find pie filling. Now I'm ready to try them on my family in the good ol USofA, and I have every confidence they'll think i'm the best cook in the world! ;) little do they know how easy it is and it's all thanks to this recipe! Thanks for the #1 Dessert recipe on my list!!! :)

I have made this recipe twice.  It is excellent.  This is definitely something that anyone can make.  I served it first at a "Mexican Potluck" and then scaled it up for a large crowd at my husband's Army luncheon.  The soldiers loved it as well.  The second time I made it I sent my husband to the store for the ingredients and he mistakenly bought the low-fat, sugar free apple pie filling.  I personally didn't like it because I don't like the taste of artificial sweetner.  I guess if you are dieting it is still an option because the almost 40 guys who ate it had no idea and absolutely loved it.  My personal thought would be to make sure that the apple pie filling is the good sweet stuff. ;)

These enchiladas were good, but the apple pie filling just seemed weird with a flour tortilla around it.  They were also very chewy with the sauce.

This was delicious! We usually have my stepson's grandfather for breakfast every Saturday, so we try to make it special every time. This sure made the trick. Everybody gobbled it up. I made the recipe as is, no modifications necessary.

This is a very tasty and easy dessert. I made my own apple filling as I don't care for canned. I did not use very much sugar in the filling (3 scant tbls. for 6 apples). I decreased the white sugar in the sauce to about 1/3 cup as well as the water to about 1/3 cup. The sauce turned out very yummy.

Very lovely and easy recipe.  I too halved the amounts of the sugars.  I chopped up my apple pie filling and added extra cinnamon to it before filling the tortillas.  The sauce is a little thin, but that's all right.  Very nice recipe that went over well with people of all age groups and tastes.

My other half loved it so much he actually licked the plate (he is Mr proper and in the 19 years we've been together I have never seen him do this). I personally thought it to be just tooooo sweet. I will make it again for him and my son.

I love desserts, and loved this one, but I honestly think it was a bit too rich.  I will probably halve the butter next time and I expect it will be even better!  Does not keep particularly well (although it may do better with less butter), but FABULOUS out of the oven with ice cream!  Mmmmmmmm...

I made this using Mary Elizabeth's review & it turned out awesome. The only things I did different from hers was I didn't use nutmeg, and I just happened to find caramel apple pie filling so I used that. My boyfriend isn't a big dessert guy and he actually recommended that I make this for my mom for mothers day, which I plan on doing. Thanks for posting, this was really good and it was fun to make!

My first foray into desserts and this simple recipe was perfect. Turned out wonderfully following directions... almost exactly (I forgot to turn down heat while stirring, so the sauce thickened but it turned out wonderfully with a more syrupy consistency). A dab of whipped cream makes an excellent topping (ice cream would probably work as well).

This is a wonderful desert!!! Love the crispy tortilla. Read through many reviews so I cut the sugars and water to 1/3 cup each and sprinkled the apple pie filling with the recommended cinnamon and also added apple pie spice. And finally I used 1 tsp cornstarch to thicken the sauce and added 1 tsp vanilla. Thank you so much for submitting this! I know I made additions but I would never have made these in the first place if I hadn't found this. Going to a house warming party and plan on making a tray of them. Yum!

I would saute my own apples in a bit of butter, then add a bit of brown sugar, cinnamon and vanilla, and cool them down before rolling. I also would use apple cider instead of water in the sauce and reduce the sugars by at least half.

My husband liked it.  He gave it an 8 on a scale of 1-10.  Personally I think next time I will crisp the tortillas in oil....just a little.  Than blot dry any excess oil and dredge them in the sauce mixture.  Wrap with filling and bake.  The idea of the floured tortilla crisped sounds better. And than you are not just dumping the sauce over them

Way to sweet for me. We tried as directed & then tonight we just tried frying the enchilada to warm it up & try to crisp it up without sauce.  Still very sweet.  Won't be making this again, but if we did we'd fry & not use the sauce.

Used fresh apples, added more cinnamon and only had 4 tortillas. Used a 9x13 pan and baked for 30 min. Plan to add a drizzle of powdered sugar and milk over when cooled!

This was surprisingly delicious! Very easy, and quick.I used the tortilla land uncooked flour tortillas(costco sells them) for fresh tortillas.  I made my own  peach pie filling from scratch. I placed 1/4 cup of that in the middle of the warm tortillas I just made. Followed the rest of the recipe, and it was the bomb! Some rich vanilla ice cream complimented this great recipe.

As suggested by other reviewers, I added cream cheese to the apple filling.  I thought the inside tasted good, but did not care for the flour tortilla.  It was just okay.

Always a hit & so easy. I do 2 cans pie filling & stick cream cheese. When I do apple I also have Carmel sauce on hand to drizzle. Vanilla ice cream goes great with it while it's hot. Apple is also great with a bit of chocolate added, either few chips or some Nutella  in filling or chocolate sauce drizzle. When I do blueberry I omit the cream cheese but whip up a sweet cream cheese or sweetened sour cream sauce to drizzle. Delicious!!

My husband and I made this and instead of apple pie filling, we used as Nikki did 4 granny smith apples. Yummy, it was a hit with our friends! Next time we make it, I think we will make the sauce and leave it off until after we bake them. We baked for 40 mins at 350.We didn't have any ice cream so topped it with whipped cream. Will be making this again.

I thought this was okay.  It tasted exactly as I thought it would - I guess I was just thinking it would taste better and look fancier.  The tortilla texture was a little flat.  I think I would try this with a puff pastry instead.  Still though, it had good flavor and was very easy to make!

This is very tasty, but sweeeet!  Next time I'm going to try with Mary Elizabeth's modifications which include adding a cream cheese mixture and baking at a higher temperature.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, ReDonna!

Very good, although I made some modifications per others notes.... i made the "sauce" ahead of time, i cut the sugar and brown sugar in half, and skipped the water completely. I also cooked it for about 7 minutes, and then chilled it after in the fridge.  I added cinnamon and nutmeg (a must).  I made it for "latin night" and got so many compliments.  People were asking around to see who made them so they could get the recipe.

I added cream cheese w/ powdered sugar and also fresh apples in addition to the apple pie filling. It sounded like a good concept but it just wasn't good. I'm a good baker but unfortunately this was one of my fails. I won't be doing this recipe again. Maybe it would be better w/ fresh apple pie filling, more cinammon, and maybe pan fried?

5 stars for easy, 4 for flavor.  Simple & fast.  Chop an extra apple into the pie filling.  Bake for 40 minutes for best flavor.  Serve warm with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.

The dessert was very tasty.  I would recommend using less sugar because it was VERY sweet and also less margerine.  When baking the dish became extremely watery and prevented the shells from crisping.  Once I drained some of the liquid, they cooked better

Since we have peaches to use right now I wanted to try something different.  Changes I made: I used 5 fresh peaches that were peeled, pitted and thinly sliced, cooked them with about a tblsp sugar and 1/4 cup water until soft.  Then I added cornstarch/water mix (about 2 tbsp each) until it was thick.  I spooned that over the tortillas and followed the recipe from there.  I did have to bake it longer so they would crisp up; total 35 minutes.  Very good served with vanilla bean ice cream!

This is so good! I had some leftover "buttermilk syrup" recipe that I had made for pancakes earlier in the week which I used inside the tortillas with my own pie fillling. I baked these sprayed with pam & sprinkled with cinnamon sugar to crunch them up first then poured the rest of the caramel mixture over when they came out of the oven! I loved the idea!

Very easy to make and delicious. For fear of it being too sweet, I used slightly less than 1/2 cup of white sugar and brown sugar each and also less water so that it isn't too watery. I also used 2 cans of apple pie filling for 6 flour tortillas.

Fantastic! I used fuji apples and cooked them in butter, cinnamon and sugar until done and thickened with corn starch rather than apple pie filling. I look forward to making this easy dessert again.

I made my own apple pie filling.  fresh granny smith apples, cinnamon, & sugar cooked in a saucepan.  Followed the rest of the recipe & added a spoon of sour cream on top with a mint sprig.  It was a huge hit for teacher appreciation week.

I have been making this recipe for several years now and it is still a family favorite. You can also use the sauce for an ice cream topper. We rarely have any left overs.

This was very good! I found that microwaving the tortillas first made rolling them much easier. I also mixed about 1/2 oz of white sugar with 8 oz of cream cheese and put that on top of the filling before rolling. It was delicious. I would also agree that baking it a little longer is a definite plus.

So easy and yet so delicious!  Made it for the first time and served it to company...they loved it.  The taste of apple pie without any fuss.  Added more cinnamon then called for and next time (oh, there will be a next time) I might add some nutmeg.  Served fresh from the oven over French vanilla ice cream.

Great recipe and a way to use up tortillas!  I paired this with Chicken Enchiladas II for a "theme dinner" for my boyfriend's friends, and they loved both parts.  We liked the addition of the cream cheese and experimented with different flavors of pie filling, but we liked the apple the best.  Cherry was a bit too sweet, but cinnamon cuts the apple's sweetness nicely.

As written, it's a **** recipe, but when the cream cheese is added, definitely worthy of *****!  Very easy recipe and very tasty!

I haved used both canned apples & fresh apples and believe it or not we liked the Comstock apples better.  Easy, delicious recipe.

This rates very high for ease of preparation.  Great to make for a crowd.  The flavor was just average for me - nothing spectacular.  I do think the sauce could of been thicker.  Will make these again but will play with the ingredients and add something more to the filling.  I would use fresh apples to make my own filling next time for sure.  The canned fillings just don't do it for me.  What a great idea and base to work with though.

Easy to make and quick to cook. Adding cream cheese was definitely a smart move for this recipe because it made the filling more substantial.

What a wonderful dessert. Whoever said it taste like apple crepes was on the ball. So simple to make. I had planned to make this on Saturday after I had cooked my ham for Sunday. I found I had only three tortillas, not enough for Easter dinner. I stopped on my way to church at the only grocery store open in our neighbor. While I put my precooked meal in to warm, I made this dessert. As I was taking my Easter dinner out of the oven, I put this in. I did add two cans of apple/cranberry pie mix. I wanted to fill a 9 X 13 glass dish. When I was making the sauce I put the end of the pie mix (I did not use) in the sauce and then poured over tortillas. I baked for thirty minutes. Next time I want to try this with the cream cheese. I am giving this recipe to everyone. Everyone just loved it. Good job.

I followed another review to add some cream cheese with the apples.  This was really good ~ next time I would double my filling so they were fatter.

Excellent! A big hit and very easy. I followed another reviewer's tips and made a cream cheese/powdered sugar mixture for the apple pie filling, which I doubled. Very good!

This is so good and easy to make. I made it for a church pot luck and had to pass out copies of the recipes the next Sunday.  I made it once with cream cheese, like one reviewer said, and I did not like it as well as the original.  Only advise is to be sure to pick up flour tortillas and not corn.  I made this mistake once.

I made this for my Spanish Class, and Everyone loved it. I made it the night before, and kept it in the pans overnight. The next morning I brought it to school, and we ate it at the end of the day. I don't remember quite, but I think we ate it "cold"(room temp.) and it was good.

Really really good.  I was hoping for crispy tortillas, but they were chewy, which was good too.  The ice cream made them awesome.

Very yummy recipe! I found using only 5 tortillas was better, I didn't have enough filling for 6! As with other reviewers I let the topping sit for a while to become a bit thicker, and then spooned it over the tortillas. I also baked them for 40 minutes and they turned out beautifully...nice and crispy and goes great with ice cream! They were gone so fast I didn't get a chance to take a picture until the next batch! Oh and try adding different fillings, like cherry (mm mm gooood)!

Much better if you add a tablespoon of sour cream to your apple mixture, and/ I have also used cream cheese. MUCH BETTER!

Everyone loves this recipe. I don't measure out the cinnamon. I use the fresh ground cinnamon and just sprinkle some on each one. I am sure that I use over 1 tsp. I have tried this recipe using cherry, apple, strawberry, and blueberry. So far I haven't found one that doesn't taste good!

we used to buy these from Schwanns when i was a kid but they were called cherry or apple flautas. i made mine with cherry pie filling. it was easy to make although they didnt crisp up on the outside and the tortillas were difficult to roll, they definitely need to be softened before filling and rolling. i served them after chicken enchiladas, we sprinkled them with powdered sugar and had ice cream on the side while they were still warm.

This recipe was quick and easy. It tastes pretty good with vanilla ice cream on top. However, it's nothing "special". It was a little too sweet for me so I probably won't make it again.

This is the easiest, best tasting dessert I've ever made. It tasted as if I had slaved in the kitchen for it!! Absolutely perfect just the way it was written- I didn't change a thing.

So simple and so great!  I took a risk and tried it my first time for some guests and they were practically liking their plates.  I'll definitely be making this again soon!

This was awesome!  I made this for a large group.   I quadrupled the recipe and it turned out great!  I followed others suggestions and cooked this for 10 minutes more to give it a slight crisp. 
Serve with Vanilla ice cream!  thank you for the recipe!

Very good.  Made it today for a pot luck party.  I made a double batch and they were all gone before I was.  Very easy to make.  Just don't burn your tongue licking the spoon from the sauce like I did!  LOL

This is sooooooooo good!!!!!!!!!!  I have made it several times and fogotten to write a review.  These were a hit at home, work, and girls night.  They are even good at room temperature.  I highly suggest giving this recipe a chance.  Everyone always asks for the recipe.  Thanks for a new favorite treat.

Very good and quite sweet.  Thankfully the sauce was saucy and not like a caramel.  I do not like caramel very much.  These were great warm from the oven and great reheated too.  A scoop of icecream on top made them absolutely luscious.  Definately will be making these again.

This was great! I prepped this early in the day and stuck it in the fridge. When we were finishing up our main course, I popped it in the oven. Everyone was thrilled with the "fresh from the oven" dessert, which I served with vanilla bean ice cream. Leftovers were great reheated as well. Be sure to use a high-quality pie filling - it will make all the difference!

This is so easy, and absolutely delicious. It is a great dessert for a party with couples because the servings are so large, you can share. It took me about 10 minutes to put it together and throw it in the oven.

I used homemade apple pie filling because I think the canned stuff is way too sweet. They were so easy and soooo  good. I also used butter instead of margarine for better flavor. Wish I had a dallop of whipping cream. Next time. Definitely cook for 30 minutes.

Great recipe! I only used half of the sugar mixture and it turned out perfect-- adding more than half would have made it too runny for my taste. Delicious and  easy!!! My husband has a new favorite!

These were really good and very easy to make.  We added extra cinnamon and they were perfect.  Made these a second time tonight and added a cream cheese/powdered sugar mixture in with the apples and they were incredible.

Pretty dang good! I did what was recommeded and put these under the broiler for the last 5 minutes. I also topped these with french vanilla icecream. Yumm! Very easy, and tastey! Oh, the sauce seems like there is too much when poured over the enchiladas, but it cooks off in the oven. Try these, you'll be happy you did.

This is so yummy and simple.  I have made it with both fresh apples and apples canned in water.  I used the sauce that you pour over the enchiladas for the inside as well.  The only additions I made were to add a little vanilla to the sauce and some chopped fresh cranberries.

Everyone loved this recipe. I peeled and boiled down my own apples instead of buying canned apple pie filling, and once it was out of the oven I dusted it with icing sugar. Several people asked for the recipe. It will be added to my personal collection.

These were pretty good, but very sweet.  The second time that I made them I added cotija (Mexican) cheese in order to add a bit of salt and cut out some of the sweetness.  I liked it much better the second time around.

This recipe was WONDERFUL!!!  I had a apple fest at work, and it won most creative.  So, thank you for this dessert.  I did use 1/3 cup of water.  Everybody wanted the recipe.  It was GREAT!!

This was FABULOUS!! I received rave reviews and had to give this recipe to five friends. I prepared in the morning and let it sit out most of the day and baked it before we left for a mexican dinner/cookout. It was the hit of the party. Everyone said they wanted to make it in the fall and serve with vanilla or cinnamon ice cream. Thanks for such a great recipe.

This is one of my favourite desserts to make. It is so impressive and it takes no time at all. I usually bake it for longer though... 30 minutes at 400 degrees. This way, the tortillas get crunchy and a bit browned.

I made this dessert for my family one night, and we all loved it! The sauce was really sweet, but the apples balanced it out. On other reviews, I saw that people substituted the apples for something else, but apples are the best to use in my opinion. I defintely will make this again!

Very mushy and too much sauce. I didn't know what to do with them when I was done cooking them. Let them sit in the sugar and cool? Pull then out of the sugar and let cool? They didn't taste bad, but they weren't worth the work.

I used this for a quick dessert for a Mexican theme dinner. Made as directed but used 1/3c of water as others have suggested. Stuck them in the oven as we started the meal, they were ready to pull out just in time for dessert. Served them with vanilla bean ice cream on top. They were the hit of the meal and the easiest to prepare. The only thing I will do different next time is chop the apples into smaller pieces. Yummy! These are sooo good!

SUPER EASY..SUPER TASTY! Fixed it according to all directions. I added a hint of vanilla to the syrup before I simmered it. After baking it was cooled.... served with a dallop of whipped cream and a sprinkle of cinnamon on each piece.  I made one batch with cherry pie filling, and one with apple pie filling.  I also cut them in half before serving. I took this dessert to our monthly office potluck and our taste test experts (hahaha) gave it rave reviews!  A real keeper!

This is easy and delicious! I took this to a church dinner and everyone loved it. I cooked the sauce for 15 minutes and added a little cornstarch so the sauce would be thicker. This is definitely a keeper.

I love the idea of this recipe.  I'm sure I will make it again but I will change a few things...I like the suggestiong about using fresh apples you'd cut and cook yourself (although honestly the pie filling was good, and my husband loves pie filling)...but the only thing I would really change is the sauce.  It is WAY too overpowering. I found myself needing a bite of vanilla ice cream after I had a bite with lots of sauce.  I think I would make a caramel sauce that is creamier and more subtle. You could even used prepared caramel ice cream topping I bet, and it would taste great.  Thanks for the recipe, it is definetly a keeper and a great idea!

This recipe was excellent!  I prepared it with both strawberries for the filling and cherries also. I top it off with a nice big scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Both were wonderful.  Whenever I prepare it for a dessert for guests, they ALWAYS request a copy of the recipe!

I am always looking for recipes that my teenagers can make.  This was a super dessert for budding cooks, and although the tortilla wrapping was a bit unever they taseted great.  We basted with the sauce once while cooking and served with maple walnut ice cream.  Will definetly become a company dessert.

This recipe is a favorite of ours on Sunday mornings. I substitute sweetened applesauce for all of the butter to cut back on fat. Sometimes I use fresh chopped apples instead of apple pie filling, but it takes extra time. We like to put whipped cream on them when they're fresh out of the oven. Yum!

I took this to a mexican themed dinner at church.  Everyone loved it!  The pastor even said it may be his new favorite dessert!  I used extra filling and sprinked cinnamon on the top of the apples.  The sauce is a little runny.  I am going to try to thicken it next time.

WOW!!!! I couldn't believe how great these tasted!! I have made them for several BBQs and they always disappear!! I normally let them cool for a few minutes and then I put the whipped cream on them while they are still a little warm so the whipped cream melts. This recipe is a definite keeper! All of my friends think I am a gormet chef now!!

These were a hit.  I topped them with grated cheddar cheese right out of the oven and served them with ice cream.  We had dinner guests, and a girlfriend had passed on dessert, until she took a taste.  Then, even though she was full, she had to have a serving, too!

These were really good!  My kids were a little uncertain when they saw I was making them with flour tortillas, but they were impressed when they tasted them.  I let them sit for a few minutes after taking them out of the oven so the sauce could thicken a little.  Definitely a keeper!

These are sooo good. I double the sauce and use a little more cinnamon to make these even more delicious. Everyone in the family, inclucing the kids loved these. They disappear quickly, so make a double batch for a large family. Apple is our favorite. Thanks for this quick and easy recipe.

This recipe was awesome. When I read the recipe to my husband, he wrinkled up his nose. But I made it anyways. Our guests said they would definately make it at home, and my husband finished his serving and actually admitted it was great, and he is not big on sweets. This was definately a hit at our house. Next time I will add raisins to the sauce.

My family loved them and asked me when I was going to make some more of them.  I used strawberry pie filling instead of the apple and omitted the cinnamon.  I served with whip cream as a topper.  They tasted and looked like crepes which I will probably use the tortillas for any of my crepe recipes from now on since you can put any type of filling in them.

I followed the recipe almost to the letter. I was overwhelmed by all the tweaks in the reviews and I'm so glad I just made it the way it's written!!! I did cut both sugars, and the water, by 2T. But my sauce never thickened. I figured it would in the oven, but it didn't... it was still SO GOOD!!! I made a second bath with cherry filling. This is getting made again. lots! I'll cut the water back to half, or less next time.

I just made these for the first time and they were delicious even though I would bake them longer than 20 minutes next time. I thought maybe the sauce would be too sweet but it wasn’t. I did add about a half tsp of vanilla extract to the sauce. Since I love nutmeg, I may add some when I make it again. This is simple and inexpensive to make and it will be a dessert that I serve many more times.

These apple enchiladas are absolutely delicious!  I served these hot with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream - - it was a hit with everyone!!  I will make them again for sure, and will try them with other pie fillings.  This is such an easy dessert and absolutely wonderful, and a bit unique!!

Very easy and tasty.  I made my own filling and pre-cooked the apple filling in a  skillet before filling the tortillas since the 20 minute baking time was short.  Delicious!

These were really yummy!  I had some frozen peaches on hand, so I made peach pie filling and used them instead of apple pie filling.  We served our enchiladas with vanilla ice cream - yum!  One change I would make is to coat the tortillas in butter before baking so they crisp in the oven and to hold the brown sugar-butter sauce until you are serving the enchiladas in order to preserve the crispiness of the tortillas.  The parts that got crispy in the oven were my favorite.  Thanks for sharing - this is a great way to use up extra tortillas.

I made it with fresh apples. Added cinnamon and nutmeg to the filling and tossed it in flour. I wasn’t to keen on the tortilla taste. Baked it for 40 minutes.

Was excited to try this recipe, as I love apple burritos that are in a fried flour tortilla ... but the flavor and texture of the baked flour tortilla was not that good.  Wasn't a success with my family.

Made this for our New Year's Eve party last night. It was a huge hit and I will definitely be making it again. I read the reviews and like others did, I also added the cream cheese mixed with powdered sugar and cinnamon layer. Have it a little extra texture and great flavor. Thanks for the recipe!

Good recipe, but found tortillas came out rubbery, therefore 3 star rating. So the next time I made these I cooked up a big batch of dessert crepes and substituted them for the tortillas. It was a little more work but well worth it. Using crepes instead of tortillas is a five star for me.

I felt there was way too much sauce for these as it just ran off anyway. My shells did not get crispy so ended up with a chewy shell.

I rated this 5 stars but I changed the oven temp to 400 and baked longer. I wish I didn't cause it candied the sauce and they were too hard to cut and eat properly. I should have followed the instructions lol

They had a good flavor but the apples weren't cooked and I had to keep putting them back in the oven until I thought they were done.  Also, the tortillas never got brown looking like in the photo.  They were white just like when I rolled them.

First try at this, so I followed directions exactly. Won't do that again. Sauce was too thin, still thin and watery after cooking for 10 minutes. STILL watery when it came out of the oven. Will definitely do this again, AFTER I fix the sauce.

Desserts just don't get easier than this.  My husband said I cheated because I used canned apple  :-) , but the time needed to put this together is just minutes.  I used 1/3 cup of water and spread some softened cream cheese on the tortillas.  They are on the sweet side, but  were still a hit served with whipped cream.

Very good! Made some changes after reading reviews. I used 2 cans apple pie filling and added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg to it. I also, made a cream cheese mixture (beat 8oz softened cream cheese, 1/4 cup powdered sugar and 1/4 tsp cinnamon until fluffy) Spoon some cream cheese mixture onto tortillas top with apple mixture and roll. The sauce- I reduced sugars and water to 1/3 cup, added 1 Tbsp corn starch and 1/2 tsp vanilla (still very sweet- next time will try 1/4 cup each sugar) Also, put under broiler to crisp up. Only problem is the filling oozed out.

Very good! Made it following the instructions and it turned out very good. Will definitely make again. Next time I will try using the cream cheese as others have suggested.
I can not understand how people can rate a recipe when they make changes. They are not rating the original recipe but their own. I follow the recipe as written the first time then make changes as I feel necessary.

Yummy! Kiddos and adults all liked. I like the tortilla in place of a crust as it makes the dish a little less heavy.  Kiddos had requested that I make it a couple of times and then I realized it was easy enough for them to make, which they now do. Easy and delicious???? Just perfect for this working mom. Thanks for sharing.

The flavor was great.  Recipe very easy and quick to make. But the tortillas I used were tough and difficult to cut with a fork.  
Added a serving of vanilla ice cream which added to entire experience.  Looking for alternate wrapper for this dish.

It tastes exactly like what it is, a flour tortilla with apple filling.  I can see this being great for kids, but not my adult taste.  This might be something to make with the grand kids.  Thank you for the recipe

Delicious and looks professional if you want to serve to guests.  I could not find apple pie filling at the store (out of season I guess) so used a jar of mixed pears, cherries & peaches in syrup.  I took the fruit out of the syrup & chopped into smaller pieces.  I also took the suggestion from a few others, mixed 8oz of cream cheese with white sugar.  I heated up some tortillas to soften, then spread a little of the cream cheese mixture on the tortilla, topped with the fruit, then sprinkled with cinnamon.  I used a 9x13 dish, made extra sauce and made 10 total enchiladas.  Turned out really, really good.  The only thing I would do differently next time is to leave it in the oven a little bit longer as the tortillas were not crispy.  I was too anxious to try it to wait longer!  Topped with vanilla ice cream and a little of the sauce.  Yum!

As-is the recipe isn't very good. The tortilla is leathery, the sauce is runny and I just didn't feel like these ingredients came together at all. I wish I had added some of the other reviewers suggestions, as those are the only reason this recipe is getting positive feedback.

I used low carb (wheat) tortillas, fat free cooked apples ( and added some of our Macintosh from the freezer ) and used a little Splenda to sweeten the filling.

You can't hardly go wrong with butter, sugar, and cinnamon mixed!! I am not a fan at all of cooked apples but, this is at the top of my dessert list. The only change I made was using fresh apples. I peeled and cut four delicious red apples and mixed them with the cinnamon before putting them in the tortillas (this ended up doubling the recipe, so I made two pans and shared one). They are best this way if the fresh apples are refrigerated for a few days mixed with the cinnamon, that's how I did my second pan and it was better than the first. The third time I cooked it I went by the recipe and used canned apples and it was good but, I'm just not a fan of canned apples so I'll continue to use fresh apples.

Fun, easy, and delicious.  I would use a thinner style tortilla and make my own fruit filling as some of the other reviews mentioned just to make it more fresh.

I've made this with my girlfriends and with my husband. Both occasions turned out great. The girls wanted the recipe. Hubby who is picky, loved it very much. I followed the recipe but used strawberry jam as I couldn't find apple pie filling, added cream cheese and garnish with vanilla ice cream. Soooooo good! This is my fave dessert.

Made this for the superbowl this year, it was a huge hit with everyone, made it just as is, but when it was done I sprinkle a bit of confectioners sugar on top for appeal. This is super easy. Thank you

I loved this recipe, I did make a few changes like some of the other reviews that I read... I used the cream cheese and creamed it and then used 1/4 c of powered sugar and a a little cinnamon in with it. I also used allspice instead of the cinnamon and sugar. one other change I made was I had some butter rum flavor and I used just a little, it was so yummy. I had rave reviews... everyone loved it.. I didn't have brown sugar so I used white sugar and just about a tsp molasses with the water to make the syrup... will make again for sure...
Thanks for the recipe...

I made my own filling for these apple enchiladas, which I believe made them 5 stars!  I used 3 large Granny Smith apples, 1/2 c. sugar, 1 T. flour, 1 t. cinnamon, and a shake of nutmeg.  The apples will supply the moisture while they are baking.  You can also make the sauce ahead of time. I reduced the 1/2 cup water in the sauce to 1/3 cup this helped avoid having the runny sauce that so many reviewers complained of, and cooked it until thickened...not just 3 minutes.  I baked them for 40 minutes.  These were great!

I made my own pie filling using granny smith apples.  I reduced the sugars to 1/3 cup each and added some vanilla.  It did not thicken as much as I would have liked even with a little corn starch stirred into the water.  I will try for a thicker sauce next time, but we did like these and will make them again.  Easier than making a pie and tastes like apple pie especially when warm and served with ice cream.  Yum

Awesome!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  I read many many reviews and added cream cheese (8oz)/powdered sugar (.25c) whip to the tortillas before adding the apple pie filling.  I used the raw tortillas from costco, so I had to toast the tortillas.  Once they cooled, I applied the cream cheese.  I used the reduced sugar for the syrup.  Ala mode is a must.  My husband said he preferred this to apple pie.

Mmmm, these were really good!  Based on some reader comments, I reduced the margarine to 2 tablespoons and boiled the sauce for an additional 2 minutes.  Worked out great!  Easy-as-pie dessert that we will enjoy over and over again.

Made the recipe as written and while I enjoyed it, I think I will do as others suggested and add some cinnamon and nutmeg to the filling. I also like the idea of adding some sweetened cream cheese inside (the cheesiness would make it more enchilada-like).   The sauce on top does thicken a bit as it sits but not enough for me, next time I won't use the water. Overall a very tasty end product and super-easy to put together. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Made this recipe last night and my kids and grand kids loved it.  I made a huge casserole full using 1 can apple pie filling and 1 can cherry pie filling.  They all had one and took a "to go" for each of them.  A very quick and tasty dessert.  A scoop of vanilla ice cream would set it off perfectly, but I made it at the last minute and didn't have any.

I did add cinnamon and nutmeg to apple filling.  I spread some cream cheese inside each tortilla before adding apples and wrapping.  Delicious!  Do cook at least 30 min for a crispier top.

I made these yesterday for a reception at my church but added a thin layer of pre-made vanilla pudding to the tortilla before putting apple pie filling on and then sprinkled some sugar/cinnamon on top before rolling.  I drizzled with some caramel ice cream sauce and then baked and then drizzled again with some left-over cream cheese icing.   I got rave reviews!!

i could not get my tortillas to crisp up even after baking for longer than the 20 minutes. Left in about 35-40 minutes and the tortillas were still somewhat pale and not golden like i expected. was hoping for a crunch and that certainly did not happen..filling was good. Room for improvement i would say. Maybe someone can give me some tips if they encountered the same.

I made this recipe last night for a girls dinner. It was by far the easiest recipe dessert I've ever made. I followed the directions, only change I made was I used 3 10 inch tortillas in a 8x8 baking dish. I would also recommend cooking a little longer, maybe 25 minutes. Overall very yummy! Be sure to serve with vanilla ice cream!

This was a huge crowd pleaser! A little too sweet I'd cut the sugar a little bit but aside from that it was awesome. Cut the sugar and it's a 5 star recipe.

I made this recipe this past weekend for a girls' get together & it was a big hit! It was so easy to make & delicious. I did as the other reviewers said and added the cream cheese mixture. I didn't really follow any particular recipe for it, just did it to taste. Mixed cream cheese, sugar & cinnamon together and spread it on the tortilla before adding the apples. I made the Enchiladas & sauce up ahead of time and then reheated the sauce, topped them and baked when I got there. This is a recipe you can't screw up!

I made it exact, but I didn't think it was too special. It was a little too sweet, and I'm not used to the unnatural flavor of canned pie filling. It's definitely edible.

Very easy as suggested. Took the advice of another and did 2 cans of the pie filling, added cinnamon and nutmeg over the apple. Chopped them as suggested. I thought they were quite good, but didn't go over as well as I thought they would. I think the flour tortilla turned people off.

I used my own homemade unsweetened apple  filling & butter. I also sprinkled on some crushed walnuts. They were a very good way to use up extra tortillas. But you do have to be in the mood for a sweet dessert.

This is very good. I used the small tortillas because that is what I had. Also doubled the filling and added cinnamon to the filling. I really liked the sauce but mine didn't thicken up very well I think I will add some cornstarch next time. Served with ice cream.

A good dessert and easy to put together!  I added some nutmeg to the apple pie filling and sprinkled powdered sugar on top of the apple pie filling before rolling up the tortillas.  I added raisins to one of the tortillas to try that out and was pleased with the apple/raisin combination.  A great Mexican themed dessert.

I have made this dessert several times, always receiving raves for it. I have used fresh apples and canned, but prefer to use fresh Granny Smith's. This is a perfect ending for "Whit's Enchiladas" and Mexican rice.

took other reviewers advice and: used fresh apple mixture; apples, sugar cinnamon, touch of nutmeg and flour and cream cheese mixture. but i am lazy and i just mixed everything together. it was verrry runny. made the caramel mixture with less water than in the recipe and let it thicken up longer than the 3 mins. put the enchiladas together (did i mention it was verrry runny) seam side down and poured the remaining apple mixture over top, followed by the caramel mixture. into a 400deg oven for 30-35mins and done. not runny at all. yum! served it with real whipped cream and vanilla ice cream. a great change from apple pie.

I messed these up, and we still liked them, so I'm going to go with a 5* on this one.  I don't like the 20 min baking time, though, I have to say.  It doesn't brown the tops, which is how I messed it up.  I baked another 20 min but still didn't get as crispy as I wanted, so I broiled.  I forgot how hot that makes the oven, and I burned the tops.  I was able to pick around the burned spots, and it was delicious.  Next time I'll be content with a bit less crispy.  :o)  Thanks for the recipe!

This was so EASY and FAST to make. It tasted really good. I halfed the amount of sugar in the recipe and found that it was still quite sweet. Next time, I'll try using even less sugar. Another thing was that the sauce was quite runny so I added a tiny bit of cornstarch to make it more consistent.  All in all, fantastic recipe!!!

I made this the other day and they were good. It took way too long for them to crisp up though. I had to hike the oven temperature up to 400 to finally get them to brown and get crispy. I would also suggest cooking the sauce on the stove a little longer as it was just too thin to really coat them as well as I would have liked. Overall, I made a lower fat version of this and served it with lowfat yogurt and it was pretty good. It tasted very close to apple pie, just without all the extra fat and sugar, so I'll definitely be making this again, just with minor changes. Next time I'll fold these differently, and make the sauce a little thicker, and cook on a higher temperature so that it doesn't take so long.

Shocking good.  Reading the ingredients, made me believe it was going to be way to sweet for me.  I just had to make it to see for myself. Good reviews make me wana try stuff.  Someone suggested to try cream cheese, which I dont always have on hand, so i used cottage cheese.  I thought it balanced the sweetness nicely.  Cream cheese does sound better.  :)  Thanks.

Love this recipe for a quick weeknight dessert or theme dinner. I used "Shedd's Spread Country Crock Light" and it worked perfectly well. I also baked 40min on the advice of a friend.  Great recipe and very easy!

Family and guest thoroughly enjoyed it.  I used home canned chunky applesauce rather than canned pie filling.  I was fantastic.  Easy and quick, great for a quick dessert for unexpected company or to serve as a snack after school.  Very versatile

Very delicious and simple.  I made my own apple filling with 4 small apples, some sugar, flour, cinnamon and nutmeg.  I used only 1/3 cup water for the syrup, and it thickened nicely upon cooling.  I will definitely make this again and again.

Made it last night for a dinner party.  It was a big hit.  I made a couple of changes.  Reduced the amount of sugars to 1/3 cup each and added frozen blackberries (thawed) to apple mix.  I also combined the remaining apple- berry mixture to the syrup. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was really good.  I fixed this for a church get together and everyone just loved it.  Big hit!  I give this five stars because i pretty much went exactly by the directions except I double the recipe.  I think next time just for a twist, I'll try some cream cheese inside.  All in all, a very yummy treat!! Thanks!

Overall very good. Followed other reviewers' tips and made my own filling using fresh apples; also reduced the amount of sugar and water.  Also added a little cornstarch, but sauce still came out a little runny.  Would try more cornstarch and even less water next time.

This was just okay for me.  Next time I might try chopping up the apples a little finer and adding more cinnamon.  There was a lot of liquid in the bottom of the pan so the enchiladas got a little soggy by the time we were ready for dessert.

This has been such a big hit every time I've made it.  I use sliced up apples tossed in flour, sugar, and a little cinnamon instead of the canned pie filling and it works just great and they are SO GOOD.  They are great the next day warmed up or cold too.  We can't stop eating them!  YUM.

I should give this 5 stars but it was just too sweet (and I LOVE sweet).  It was very good and so easy to make.  I prepared it while I was cooking the rest of my dinner.  I let it sit for a couple of hours then cooked it.  I served it with vanilla ice cream.  I will be making this again and again.  I am going to experiment with the sugar.  Oh, and I would add extra cinnamon.

I made the recipe exactly as written and found that they need to bake longer than 20 minutes.  Even so, my family enjoyed them.  I found them too sweet, but will definitely make for my family again - baking longer this time.

I took this to a family B-day party with a Mexican theme. I chose dessert and it was great. Only suggestion I have is cook just before serving. Really good with vanilla ice cream. I also used brown sugar cream cheese, and drizzled with carmel after cooking.

This recipe looked so intriguing I just had to try it so I made it tonight for dessert for my husband and my sister and her family.  It's absolutely true that you'd never know you're eating tortillas.  I'm going to make it again next weekend for company.  The house smelled wonderful too!  Thanks ReDonna!

I don't know if I did something wrong, but I did not like this dessert. I did use fresh apples instead of canned, maybe that was my problem. It turned out mushy.

These are so yummy and extremely easy to make. Everyone who's tried them has loved then. I wish I could make these more often, but unfortunately, we hardly ever have canned pie filling or tortillas on hand. I've also made these with microwaved pie filling (some chopped apples and cinnamon sugar in the microwave) and they came out just as great. Thanks for sharing!

This went over pretty well for "Goodie Night."  I used fresh Granny Smith apples because the pie filling would have been way too sweet!  They taste great the next day!  I'll definitely make this recipe again.

This was good and easy.  Will make again. I used apple pie filling and served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

I made this for a Mexican potluck lunch and it was FANTASTIC.  So easy and good, but people think it's a lot more complicated than it is.  I will definitely make this again.  Was great with vanilla ice cream.

Most everyone liked these and they were very easy.  Good but not amazing.  It was a good dessert for a mexican themed party.  Other than for that, I'd prefer to make a home made apple pie or dumplings.

I'm giving 4*s because I think my decision to scale it down to 2 servings affected teh outcome but our results were only fair, at best. The tortillas were tough & chewy. That could be the nature of the dish or it could be because there were only 2 enchiladas in the pan (I used an 8 by 8 pyrex) & they dried out. Hubby ate all of his but I didn't even eat half of mine...sorry.

Really yummy and insanely easy! I used smaller tortillas, and would cut back on the sauce ingredients next time (a little too sweet - slightly overpowering, but not enough to keep me from loving it!) I followed others suggestions and cooked for 40 minutes - vanilla ice cream on the side makes this!

For some reason I just didn't like these very much. I didn't like the flavor of tortillas mixed with all of the other flavors and for me it was almost sickeningly sweet. I followed the recipe exactly and served them with vanilla ice cream. Obviously a good recipe since so many people seem to like it, it must just be our tastebuds. Thanks for the recipe though! :)

So easy! I made this alongside a Mexican meal. Like another reviewer, I kept it in the fridge until we were eating and then let it bake - the only thing was that the sauce separated in the fridge, and kept separating everytime it was stored in the fridge. It's ok if you stir it and reheat it, though. My family loved this, it may even replace the traditional apple pie at some meals because it's so quick!

Delicious! This even impressed my mother-in-law!! I used fresh yellow delicious apples and made my own pie filling, though.

Yum! This recipe impressed my mother-in-law, so I was pretty happy!! :) Instead of canned apple pie filling, I made my own with fresh apples, water, sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon, nutmeg and a dash of cardammom. 1/2 an enchilada with a scoop of vanilla ice cream was the perfect dessert!

These apple enchilada's were great! They were very easy to make, and cook time was not that long at all.  They would be really good with some ice cream.  But they are great when they come right out of the oven!  Yummy!I will make these again.

The taste of this dessert is OK. Based on taste alone I would giveit 3 stars. But, it was so easy to make so that bumped it up to 4 stars.
If I make it again, I'll probably make my own pie filling like previous posters.

I'm hardly a cook, but this was simple to make and I actually feel I did a good job :) so it's a recipe which easily helped to boost my cooking self esteem lol. I'm bringing it to a Mexican-themed Birthday/girl's night out so I really hope it goes over well.... :)

My hubby took this for a Mexican potluck at work and the reviews were rave. My hubby said kind of like apple pie but better. I used the apple pie filling reipe posted by Terri on this site only adding some additional cornstarch to make the consistecy thick enough for rolling up the tortillas

This was good and SO easy, but there is nothing terribly original or interesting about this recipe.  I would say that it is almost too sweet...  Good, but not "the best"

yummy, i used fresh apples instead of canned just peeled them sliced them thin and put them on the tortilla, didn't precook them and cooked it a little longer in the oven than in the recipe and it was wonderful, I coated the tortilla's with the sugar mixture and basted them while cooking and it was so good

I can't stand canned apple pie filling, so I followed what LauraS411 wrote in her review and made my own filling---it was delicious. Even with making the pie filling from scratch, it was a very easy recipe and very quick. I used 1/3 cup water like many others, and it was just right.I could only fit 5 tortillas in the pan. My husband and I were very very happy with this dessert---it was so good. Tim ate two! The sauce is very sweet, but also very good.

Good idea but mine were a soggy mess plus I think they needed to bake at least another 10 minutes.  I took these to a party and also took them home from a party.  Only 1 was gone.

This recipe is easy.  It also tastes great!  It was a nice change from making a cake or cookies for dessert.  They were a hit at my house.  I think these would be great for a church potluck!  Maybe I will take them next time!

5 stars for flavor, however, they were soggy and chewy so I only gave this 4. Next time I will try them with crepes instead like another user suggested.

Like most I agree that it is much better with fresh apples.  A side of french vanilla ice cream with the sauce poured over is great too.

These are really great. I mixed cream cheese and sugar together and spread that in hte middle of the shell before I added the pie filling. It makes them creamy and  delicious. Yum!

I served it with vanilla ice cream on top and it was yummy! I also cut the water back to 1/3 cup otherwise I think the sauce would be way to runny.

Outstanding dessert! Made once for co-workers and is now a special requests! Easy to make and tastes like you worked really hard! Used low-carb tortillas and served with low-carb ice cream. No one tasted difference of tortillas until I told them.

These were good, but it's unlikely I'd make them again. I used homemade apple pie filling, as I don't like canned. We loved the warm caramel sauce on top of ice cream: I would have liked more! The whole thing was _really_ sweet.

I thought this recipe was good but not spectacular, however since the recipe was so easy to make its worth 4 stars.  I must admit though that I used whole wheat tortillas in order to make it a bit healthier.  If I make it again I'll probably stick to the flour tortillas.

This was really sweet, so I think you can safely cut the sauce in half and have a good dessert. I garnished with whipped cream and cinnamon-sugar. You have to eat them all the same night, otherwise the leftovers get soggy (but don't be fooled, they're still good!).

This turned out really well.  I had it as a dessert at my son's birthday party (did Mexican food theme) and people really liked it.  It was very good served warm with whipped cream.  Ice cream probably would've been good as well.  I made it with cherry pie filling.

I did not care for this recipe at all!!  It is easy to make, but the effort you put into preparing a dish is what you will get out.  Baked apples or apple crunsh or something simialr is easy as well--with better flavor and results.  No one in my family would eat more than what was put on their plates, which was a 1/2 of one tortilla.

Loved this recipe.  Did one pan of apple and one of blueberry -- delicious!  The blueberry was wonderful.  I was supposed to double the sauce, but only used one stick of butter. Great change to typical cake/pie/cookie recipes.

After I made these, I didn't find them very appealing.  To be honest, I didn't even taste them.  I made them for a Mexican-themed party, and there were lots of leftovers.  They were not very popular.

I also reduced the water as others suggested. Turned out fabulous. The kids were eating them out of the pan. Big hit at our New Years Eve party. My mom made it with the cherry pie filling a few days later and it was also marvelous. Great recipe!

This was a quick and easy way to make a pastry dessert.  I made both cherry and apple.  I followed other suggestions and used about 1/3 cup of water.  The solution ended up being just like the sauce on the apple dumplings made at our church.  YUMMY!  We served these warmed with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

I mixed the cinnamon in with the apple pie filling.  I also crushed the apples into smaller pieces to better spread on the tortillas.  I added about a teaspoon of vanilla to the syrup mixture.  I used apple juice instead of the water.  I topped all with chopped walnuts.  All in all I thought it was very good considering the effort involved.  Next time I would probably cut the liquid down as others stated, or reduce the sauce more.

This was good, but in my opinion (and I'm in the minority here) not "to-die-for".  I only had room for 4 tortillas in my 8 x 8 pan--maybe my tortillas were too big!

Thank you for a great recipe!  It was so good I made a second batch the next day. I used canned peaches in one batch and canned cherries in the second batch. I took this to a picinic and it was the only dessert gone by the end of the evening. Great reviews from the guests at the picnic and my family loves it!

Perfect summer time fun! I made 3 pans, one apple, one cherry, and one blueberry. The blueberry was the overall favorite. I did take the suggestion to cut the amount of water back to 1/3 cup, sauce was perfect!

This was an easy and yummy desert! Everyone in the family loved it.
I decreased the water to 1/3 c like suggested and 
thickened up two cans of peaches w/ cinnamon and cornstarch for the filling.  The left over filling I put on the top of the tortilla.  We too, had it with Vanilla bean icecream!

I would for sure do this one again!  Its a sure winner!

This is a very quick to make and yummy recipe. It was a big hit with teens and adults. I did follow others suggestions and used 1/3 cup water and substituted applesauce for half of the margarine. Next time I will use all applesauce to eliminate the fat. I simmered the sugar mixture for about 15 minutes instead of the recommended three. Although this is a great recipe, it would be even better if you used fresh apples and prepared them as you would for homemade apple pie. That is what I plan to do next time, and I know this great recipe will be even better.

This was great out of the oven with vanilla ice cream - pretty rich so I may lessen the butter.  On the other hand, my sauce browned in the pot and I suspect I burned it, also giving it a different flavor?   Will definitely keep making this recipe! A little goes a long way.

This was very well like by my Mom and sister.  I think next time I will use less butter or some low fat.  This is a very rich dessert.
This was different, easy and well liked by all.

This is a very easy recipe and was a big hit at our house.  We like to eat it warm, with vanilla ice cream.  Very Sweet!

Not bad. Everyone at dinner loved them. They were very easy and pretty quick too. Served with vanilla ice cream as a dessert to Beef enchiladas. My nephew keeps asking for these again!

This recipe was great. My 4 year old had a blast helping to make it. My hubby isnt big on sweats but he loved this one. I make it a few times a month. Great out of the oven with icecream and a drizzle of chocolate syrup! I mad this for my sisters baby shower, used bigger tortillas and cut in half , sprinkled confectioners sugar and cinnamon for appearance. everyone left home with the recipe!

It was pretty good.  I would have to make it again so I can eat it with Ice Cream right out of the oven would be the best.  I took it to a bar-be-q and my brother-in-law was in love with them.

This is one of the easiest desserts I have ever fixed.  It is WONDERFUL!!!!  My whole family loved it.  I think next time I will make my own apple filling, but the recipe with the canned apple pie filling is still great.  Thanks for the recipe.....

I had a can of apple pie filling in my pantry for a long time and finally used it up in this recipe.  It is a good way to use up extra tortillas, and most people would have all the other ingredients handy in their kitchen already.  This dessert is so easy to make and surprisingly delicious!  The carmel sauce goes so well on vanilla ice cream.  This is an excellent dessert to make when you have unexpected company for dinner.
