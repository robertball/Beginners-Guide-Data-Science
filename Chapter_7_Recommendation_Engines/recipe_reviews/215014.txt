Absolutely delicious! Here's the orange marmalade sauce recipe I used: 1 cup of orange marmalade, two tablespoons horseradish, and two tablespoons dijon mustard.

We love coconut shrimp so I was very happy to see this recipe chosen for the Recipe Group this week. We prepared these exactly as written and they are absolutely perfect. They took 14 minutes on convection bake in my oven. The shrimp were perfectly cooked and the coconut breading was crunchy and very flavorful, but not overly sweet. I found a copy-cat recipe on-line for Outback's sauce that they serve with these - 1/2 cup orange marmalade, 2 teaspoons stone ground mustard with seeds, 1 teaspoon prepared horseradish and a dash of salt. It really does taste exactly like Outback's. We will be making and enjoying these often. Thanks for sharing!

Wow, I have to say this was one of those surprise good meals!  I didn't quite know what to think about baking shrimp for 15 or 20 minutes but I took them out at 16 minutes and they were absolutely perfect!  The coconut was just toasted and the shrimp were not over cooked.  I had 1 lb of 30 count shrimp and the measurements turned out perfect.  I will definately make this again.

This was pretty good but I think if I make it again I'll pulse the coconut in the food processor to make it a little finer.  Tasted great though!

This was a great recipe, and so much more healthy than frying!  I did everything as stated in the recipe, except that I cut down the amount of coconut in an effort to save on sugar and calories (a little coconut goes a long way)...not to mention, I wanted to save those calories for my sauce!  I mixed sugar free apricot preserves, horseradish and dijon mustard (can't remember the measurements...just did it all to taste), and it was a great combination.  I think next time I may add a bit more Cayenne pepper to the cornstarch mixture, since I like things pretty hot, but other than that think the recipe is perfect as is. :)  Thanks for sharing!!!

This was AMAZING! I will make this often. The recipe is perfect as stated, i wouldn't change a thing. Make sure to turn the shrimp once halfway through cooking so both sides brown.

Well, we really enjoyed this one!!  I made this for the Recipe Group this week with 21-25 count shrimp and assembled them about two hours before baking, covered and refrigerated.  I baked them for 18 minutes, flipping halfway though.  I served them with two dipping sauces from this site, Yummy Honey Mustard Dipping Sauce and the dipping sauce in Coconut Tilapia with Apricot Dipping Sauce.  Both were very good.  The only drawback was that this is very messy to make, at least for me.  But, the results were worth it, so give it a try!!

YUM! A super fantastic recipe! I had medium shrimp on hand (60 80 count per pound) and used those to make this dish. Probably because there were so many more shrimp, in the end I had to use 4 egg whites and the entire 14 oz bag of shredded coconut. (My shrimp did look like little macaroons, I had so much coconut on them!) The cayenne provided a nice bite - not too spicy at all. This is going into the file under "Keeper".

Fantastic!  My son chose this recipe to do a cooking demonstration in his Advanced Foods class. They turned out super tasty. So much cleaner and easier than the fried version, not to mention far more healthy. They brown up so nicely that you won't miss the oil. We sprayed the cookie sheet but also the tops of the breaded shrimps so they wouldn't stck after flipping. We found they cooked more quickly so watch them close so they don't burn. He made an orange dipping sauce that compliments them perfectly. Mix together 1/2 cup orange marmalade, 1/4 cup Dijon mustard, 1/4 cup honey, and 4 drops tobasco.

Of course fried is better, but these were pretty good. One tip - place them on a parchment paper lined baking sheet. Cleanup is a snap and there is no burned coconut to deal with. My only criticism is the lack of crispiness. Next time, I will chill them after coating and perhaps spritz them with cooking spray after turning. Mine cooked 8 minutes on the first side and 6 minutes after turning. Perfectly done with out being tough or dry. You need to watch them depending on the size and freshness of the shrimp. Our shrimp are fresh and wild caught, which is the ideal. 
For a dipping sauce, I used apricot jam about .5 cup, with 2 -3 T Creole mustard and a tsp. of horseradish. It could have been a tad hotter but really had good flavor. We preferred that to the orange marmalade suggested. I will be making this again and will post more reviews as I figure out how to get them crispier. Oh, and please make sure that you pulse your coconut in the processor to make the pieces finer. I took other reviewers suggestions and did that. Perfect flakes that adhered well. Enjoy. Thanks girlbob.

Highest praise ----- One of the VERY best recipes I've found on ALLRECIPES.com in the many years I've been watching it...... W O W!!! I followed the recipe EXACTLY (as I typically do the first time). Wouldn't change a THING!! The one reviewer's "Outback sauce" is incredible; Orange marmalade, ground mustard, horseradish, and salt. MAKE THIS RECIPE!!!

This is so delicious!!  Cooked for a total of 16 minutes.. 8 minutes on each side.  For the dipping sauce: I used 1 cup of sour cream, 1 cup of Coco Lopez pina colada nonalcoholic drink mix, 1/4 crushed pineapple and 1 tablespoon of fresh lemon juice.

Disappointing....cocoanut should be pulsed finer, it was too sweet and overtook the prawns. I have had cocoanut prawns in a high end restaurant and the cocoanut was very fine. The concept is good but it needs some tweaking.......sorry

great recipe.  Cooking time is too long though, 10 minutes at 400 for perfectly juicy large (30-40 count) shrimp.  I used an apricot dipping sauce to go with them.  1/2 cup apricot jam, 1 tbsp soy sauce, 1 tbsp rice wine vinegar, 1 tsp sambal olek (asian chili sauce).  was a big hit!

I just made this for dinner and all I can say is wow!  This was better than anything I've had at a restaurant.  We got to eat them quickly from the oven.  I butterflied 31/40 count shrimp (happened to be on sale that day) and followed the recipe exactly.  We served them with orange marmalade and they were fabulous.  I honestly don't know if I will make shrimp any other way now.. HA! These are THAT good!

These were delicious! I didn't do it exactly as written (I used 1/4 t cayenne and 1/4 t paprika because my mother is visiting), I also used tapioca flour rather than cornstarch, but other than that, I didn't change anything. I will definitely be making this again! (Hint: make certain to have enough "frothy" whites. The ones I made with "froth" were nicer than the later, flat white ones. Also, I will probably grind up the coconut slightly next time so not so many have burned ends.) But...SO GOOD!

For my "I hate coconut" daughter, I used two slices of bread (put in an electric chopper to make crumbs) and 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese. Hers were just as good and BETTER than any premade breaded ones.

Oh my! I forgot to mention I used chicken!!! Sliced in "shrimp sized pieces." (My husband has a seafood allergy.)

I really liked these...like many others here, I like coconut shrimp but don't want to deep fry. I tried the recipe as written for half the batch, then for the second, I spritzed lightly with cooking spray before baking. I found this gave the coating more of a golden color and crisp texture when baked. I did turn the shrimp over 1/2 way through baking. 

Next time, I will definitely pulse the coconut in the food processor, as I think that would make the coating the perfect consistency. Thanks for an easy and healthier version of a favorite!

Made this for our annual Christmas party and they were a huge hit! If you are wondering about preparing ahead of time, I made them around 1 and didn't cook them until 6:30 and they were PERFECT (just keep in the fridge)!!!

I can't begin to tell you how pleased I was to discover this recipe.  I was on the hunt for a gluten-free coconut shrimp.  I found this and Alton Brown's.  The two are very similar, except Alton's has less cayenne and adds white pepper, and is supposed to be fried.  I used Alton's spices, but baked according to this recipe's directions.  It was so easy, and delicious.  My husband said it was some of the best coconut shrimp he's ever had.  I made the orange marmalade sauce to go with it, and it tasted great. (1/2 cup orange marmalade, 2tsp. coarse ground mustard, and 1tsp. horseradish) I served it with Avocado Mandarin Salad on this site, which complemented the shrimp nicely.

Sounds so good....I'm wondering if it's possible to do this with frozen already cooked shrimp.  I have some in my freezer and would love to give it a try but I don't want to waste it if it's not doable.  Thanks for any input.

A hit for dinner! Easy to prepare. Served with pina colada sauce and sides of noodles (husband doesn't like rice!) and green beans. Lovely. Mixed leftover everything together and heated in microwave for lunch -- tasty! I think I will use whole eggs next time for a bit of a different flavor. Yum factor is BIG on this one.

Delicious, easy recipe. Proud to serve to guests. I suggest spraying shrimp with cooking spray after flipping to help brown the coconut. Mixed spicy brown mustard, honey, cayenne pepper & a juiced orange as a sauce to be drizzled over cooked shirmp. Thank you for sharing this great recipe.

Easy and delicious! I followed some of the suggestions by reviewers: two whole eggs, dipping sauce using 1 cup orange marmalade, 2 Tbs horseradish, 2 Tbs dijon mustard. I used 21-25 large shrimp. Next time I would process the coconut in the food processor as the flakes are pretty big straight out of the bag and don't stick to the shrimp as well. Overall 5 stars! I love to order Coconut Shrimp but now I can make it at home and without the mess of deep fat frying.

Wanted to make something a little more elegant for Valentines day.  Coconut shrimp is one of her faves, but I was very reluctant to make this version out of fear that baked would suffer in comparison to fried.  My fears couldn't have been more unwarranted.  These were delicious!  Huge hit with everyone.  Baking gave them a wonderful crunch.  So much so that I can't imagine how frying them would have made them any better.  Doubled the order by simply doubling everything as written.  No need to mess with what works here.  The cayenne does a wonderful job of taking the sweet edge off the sweetened coconut.  The "Dipping Sauce for Coconut Shrimp" on this site is a must as well.  The dredging process for a lazy cook like myself is a bit tedious for a double order, but I'm ready to line up and do it again.

Wish I added a little more coconut & didn't burn as many, but were a big hit, especially with the marmalade!

Absolutely amazing!  I have gone ahead and used the entire egg (not just egg whites) a few times and it worked just fine.  Just hate having that extra yoke waiting to be used and then forgotten!  Also, I found that I ended up using more coconut that it states, perhaps that is just because I like it to be "well coated."  Serving it with orange marmalade may sound strange, but really does compliment it well.  To make it easy, I use a sil pat instead of just coating a baking sheet, makes clean up that much easier.  Have made this recipe over and over.  LOVE LOVE LOVE it - and so do my in-laws now :)

Delicious! I moved the oven rack up a notch for the last few minutes just to get a good browning on the coconut. We had some fresh grated coconut left over from a curry we made, so we used the fresh coconut (naturally sweetened). That's the only alteration and it was to use what we already had in the fridge. Thank you, we will make this one over and over!

I'm in the process of making this now and it even LOOKS amazing. I was a little hesitant making this, being a vegetarian i couldn't try it. But my dad is definitely a fan! By the way, LOVE Allison's dipping sauce.

My husband asked me to make these a regular rotation in our household.  And let me tell you, he NEVER does that!  This is so much cheaper than his expensive, sit-down restaurant habit that he has and he and I both swear they're just as good.  I will admit to forgetting to grease my pan, so when I took them out to flip, they stuck.  So, being in a hurry and feeling lazy, I didn't flip them.  They still turned out really well.  I will be making these again.  Thank you for pleasing my very picky husband and helping our checkbook in the process!

Very good.  The shrimp I used were jumbo, 15 count in 1 lb.  I added a dash of ginger to the cornstarch mixture.  I pulsed the coconut in the food processor.  I didn't need a full 2 cups.  I also only needed 1 egg.  I didn't have any trouble with the coconut falling off.  I put the shrimp in the fridge for 30 minutes or so before baking.  They turned out great, and I would make these as an appetizer.  I used the 'Sesame Dipping Sauce' from this website.  It was tasty.  We also tried the 'orange marmalade, ranch dressing, hot sauce' recipe someone wrote about in their review.  It was ok, but we liked the other sauce better.

Incredible! I try to eat healthy but I am a sucker for Red Lobster's Parrot Bay Coconut Shrimp with their Pina Colada sauce. Thank you so much for this healthier version! I didnt change a thing when I made them and they were delicious and super easy. I did happen to have a bottle of Pampered Chef's Spicy Pineapple Rum Sauce that worked great as dipping sauce--a little bit spicier than the PC sauce, but another perfect match. This is a MUST TRY recipe!!

This recipe was so easy, but SO SO delicious!  I will definitely be making it again in the near future. My roommate couldn't stop raving about it!  I was short on eggs so I used 2 whole eggs instead of the 3 egg whites.  Maybe not as pretty, but certainly still delicious!

This was delicious!  I love coconut shrimp but hate the fact that they are deep fried.  This has all the flavor without the fat.  The cayenne pepper is key - it gives it the perfect, unexpected kick.  I didn't flip them during the baking process, and they still turned out perfectly.

Just finished eating this awesome shrimp!  It was easy to make, I followed the directions to a "T" and they turned out great!  Made a dipping sauce another reviewer recommended, one cup orange marmalade, 2 tbsp. horseradish, 2 tbsp. dijon mustard.  Hubby and son were blown away!  I will make this again and again!

I've made these several times and we always enjoy them! The first time I made them, I didn't have anything to dip them in, so I mixed equal portions of ketchup and 'apricot-pineapple perserves' and it was a huge hit. These shrimp are so yummy--even my husand loves them and he'd not eaten much shrimp before. I like the bit of cayenne pepper to give them just the right amount of zip!

Great tasting shrimp without the fuss and the mess of cooking oil. Typically I refuse to give up taste for healthy when considering a recipe. With this recipe you don't have to- its one of our favorites.

Excellent! I first dipped the shrimp in an egg-water mixture, then a flour and breadcrumb mixture, back in the egg, then in the coconut. I will chop the coconut finer next time to help it stick better.

Wow - this was really fantastic.  I was looking for a recipe to make fried coconut shrimp, but decided to give this a try.  Now, I will always use this recipe.  The shrimp came out so crunchy.  Love it.

I'm obsessed with this recipe! It's so much healthier than frying, but does not forfeit taste. I did add some Old bay seasoning in place of the cayenne and some panko bread crumbs, but the baked coconut makes them perfectly crunchy. I will definitely be using this recipe often. So quick and easy!

It was pretty good but luckily I had a hunch this would be too sweet and subbed half unsweetened coconut flakes, otherwise I think this would be too sweet. Still, very yummy and served with Thai Chili sauce.

These were so yummy! I like the idea of baking them, much healthier and I just don't have patience to fry things. I would take it out half way through and turn them over next time to get the other side crispier. I didn't have any cornstarch on hand so I actually used whole wheat flour and that worked just fine. I think 10 minutes is enough time, I think I cooked it for 12 minutes or something like that. Great recipe thanks!

Can I give it more than 5 stars??? I can sum up this recipe in 3 words: These Are AWESOME. They flew off the plate right after I served them.  I used the whole eggs instead of egg whites. definetly will make again and again.

I love that these are baked, not too terribly sweet, and have a nice spicy kick to them.  I almost rated this a 4 because they were not as good as fried, but for baked they are definitely a 5.  We didn't even use a dipping sauce and the teenagers devoured them.  Using 2 eggs worked just fine, though I think I will try only the whites next time.  And the corn starch and coconut amounts were perfect for 1 lb of shrimp - not too little, not too much.

I made these for Sunday dinner and they were delicious.  The receipe is easy to follow (one of my requirements).  I would recommend boiling the potatoes first, until they are slighly tender.  Great Receipe!

Excellent recipe and easy to follow. This is such a healthy alternative to fried coconut shrimp and so tasty. We loved it! 
I was out of cornstarch and substituted 1/3 cup of flour and instead of cayenne pepper, used regular pepper, but only 1/4 tsp and then a few dashes of paprika.
YUMMY!!!!

Wonderful!  Don't try to overcoat with coconut like me, or it's a little overwhelming.  A little time consuiming to dip all 16oz pkg, but worth it.  Yummy!  However, I shouuld have known they wouldn't be good leftover in the micro! :(

They came out pretty good, but the coconut didn't really stick as well as I thought it would. I did use the orange marmalade dipping sauce from one of the reviewers and everyone raved about it!

Wow, Wow is this the most wonderful Shrimp I have ever eaten.  I have made it twice in the last week.  The first time, the coconut I had on hand was flakier, maybe natural, and already somewhat toasted.  It tasted great, but didn't stick real well.  The second time, I used shredded coconut, and it stuck better.  The sauce I made for my hubby who likes stuff hot was the orange marmalade (about 1/3 cup), Tablespoon or so of horseradish sauce, and tsp of stone ground seed style mustard.  I don't like too much hot, so used the marmalade, seed style mustard, and honey dijon mustard, yum, yum, will make this over and over.  And I don't think I will Ever Fry shrimp again!  Thanks so much for this one!

I bought some shrimp as an afterthought when I was buying veal for osso bucco for my husband's birthday dinner yesterday. Dídn't know what I was going to do with them. When I got home and opened my email, this recipe was waiting for me and voila, I knew what I was doing with the shrimp. They tasted GREAT! I put the leftovers on a salad for my husband's lunch today and he said they were great cold too. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!!!

My family in Florida has been making coconut shrimp for years, but it's always fried, so I avoid it.
This year I decided to try a healthier, baked version on them at Christmas and WOW-what a hit!
Made entertaining really simple by making these in advance and putting them in on cookie sheets in the refrigerator ready to go.  Doubled the recipe and they were devoured with every new baked batch.
Made recipe as is, with a little less salt and sprayed the top as well with cooking spray before baking to help them crisp up.  Flipped half-way at 8 minutes on 400 and they were perfect!  
No grease and loved that they are gluten free!
Served with the "Outback-copycat" sauce recommended by one reader (doubled this)--was fantastic! 
1/2 c. orange marmalade 
2 teaspoons stone ground mustard
1 teaspoon horseradish (fresh, not horseradish sauce)
dash salt

Especially good with the unsweetened coconut. Great flavor and color, and baking makes it so easy
to prepare. Egg whites keep it light, we omit the egg yolks whenever we can because shrimp has enough cholesterol...no need for more!  I used apricot jam mixed with honey mustard for the sauce. A great recipe, enjoyed by everyone, Thanks

Pretty good, but I improved it with a few tweaks. I used jumbo shrimp, did NOT pat them dry before dipping in cornstarch, and two whole eggs beaten until frothy, ONE cup sweetened coconut mixed with 1/2 cup breadcrumbs, 1/2 tsp salt, only 1/4 tsp cayenne,  then of course needed to bake 25 minutes due to the large size. I did not flip them, and they turned out absolutely picture perfect. This is a good starter recipe, but with some adjusting is a great recipe.

Cuckoo for Coconut Shrimp! Love the healthy alternative of it being baked and not fried like it's traditionally prepared. I added more cayenne pepper only cuz the hubby and I love spice. Delish and super easy to make.

This is a wonderful recipe.  Even though I like coconut,I've never been a fan of coconut shrimp.This changed my mind.My husband loved it too.   It turned out perfectly and since we are able to catch our own shrimp,I will be using this recipe a lot.

The 'crunch factor' was okay. Coating all the shrimp took time, but any good recipe requires a little work.  Putting on the parchment paper was a good idea.

I used the coconut milk in place of the beer and this turned out really awesome! I wished I would have taken a few pics to show how good they looked but they were flying off the plate as fast as they landed. I used orange marmalade for the sauce, next time I'll have to try sauce mixture that alot of people have been posting. Thanks for sharing!

I like this recipe.  Tried them baked and then tried some deep fried and like it better deep fried.  Great served with a sweet spicy dipping sauce.

Excellent i made it before a big steak dinner. My husband (who isn't a big coconut fan) really enjoyed this.  I only had precooked shrimp from the grocery and it worked well ( might use less flour because you could see it) oh i had no corn starch...but none the less super easy and on our Adkins diet (level 2)

So yummy... not really crunchy like it says in the description, but I got great reviews from everyone who ate them.  I used 16-20 ct shrimp, which I think helped to decrease the dryness in the shrimp that some people had a problem with.

this is 4 stars with the orange marmalade dipping sauce. on its own i would only give it 2 stars. i will say that i used frozen shrimp, not fresh, so maybe that will make the difference.  in any case, the sauce is what makes this. i utilized marmalade and stone ground mustard for the sauce. the shrimp i followed the recipe exactly.

This was fantastic.  I also fried half the batch, using the exact same recipe.  both were great!  definitely needed to grease pan. coconut stuck great on both batches, almost too much coconut.  fried looked more appetizing but both were equally good.  had to bake longer than stated, possibly because of my toaster oven. thanks!!! will use often!  used Peach Preserves and Huicholl Salsa (like tabasco) for dipping sauce

Made it just as described, served with orange marmalade and it was very good. Popular at a potluck and I was asked for the recipe. I would recommend baking them on aluminum foil or parchment paper as the cookie sheet was a mess after; I also broiled them at the very end so the coconut browned as I found it was still white after 20 minutes in a 400 degree oven.  For 37 jumbo/large shrimp, I had at least 1/2 cup of coconut left over.

Yummy - followed recipe except for using two whole eggs instead of whites. Next time I would just shake all the shrimp in a plastic bag with the cornstarch mixture to save a step.  Also - heavily PAM your baking sheet, I'm going to try baking on top of a cooling rack next time to get it extra crunchy.

i love love love shrimp, especially coconut shrimp, and to find a recipe that was baked not fried was awesome. i left out the salt and once tried it with unsweetened coconut, but decided sweetened was definitely the way to go. i found it helpful to not add all the coconut mixture to the bowl at the same time, so that i don't end up trying to dredge shrimp in a goopy sticky mass.

These turned out great! I used a nonstick pan, so they only took about 12 minutes to cook. Definitely making these again. I also used unsweetened coconut, which is what I had, so I added some granulated sugar to the cornstarch, and it worked fine.

Great recipe for baked version! Think next time i might add just a little more cayenne powder. Want to try making Red Lobster's pina coloda dipping suace one of these days. We whipped together an impromptu sauce with light sour cream, peach preserves and a dash of curry powder. Yum!

LOVED the flavor, but couldn't get the coconut coating to stay on!  (what am I doing wrong?)  I think next time I'll run the coconut through my food processor to get it a little finer & maybe refrigerate for a few minutes after coating the shrimp to help the coating stay on when baking.  I also used reviewer Allison's orange marmalade sauce: 1 cup of orange marmalade, 2 tablespoons horseradish, and 2 tablespoons good grainy dijon mustard.  Was so good, girlbob, I'll try again for perfection!

So good!! Especially if you love the fried restaurant version but want to watch what you're eating. I didn't use any sauce and thought they were perfect, but could see how an orange sauce would be delish!

This recipe is delicious & simple. I love that it is baked/not fried so the house doesn't get that greasy smell, but you do get crispy shrimp.  I served this with jasmine rice & Thai Sweet Red Chili Sauce...next time I'll also serve it with stir-fried onion, celery, & broccoli to add color & vegetables.  I did reduce the cayenne just a little and used 31/40 count shrimp which is probably the smallest size you would want to use.

So good!  I'm not even a huge coconut fan but I had coconut shrimp at a restaurant and couldn't get it out of my mind.  This recipe was delicious as written.  I did not turn my shrimp halfway through baking and they were still crisp.

I was very excited to try this. Unfortunately, it was not a hit in my house. Too much work for the outcome. Tasted OK after following the recipe, not great though, and not a "keeper". If you want coconut shrimp, splurge on the deep fried method, not baking.

This dish was easy and tasted great.  I used 2 eggs instead of whites - could have gotten by with only one egg.  Got the shrimp ready and put on baking sheet in fridge. Then baked when we were ready. 
Used an Apricot preserves dipping sauce as recommended by others.

These weren't the prettiest to look at but they tasted great.  I think my prep time was more than 15 minutes though.  I served with the marmalade/ horseradish/ dijon mustard sauce that another reviewer recommended.  I also think it could use more cayenne but I one to like spicy things.

EXCELLENT recipe!!  Simple, quick and down right delicious!

There's only one little thing that I will change the next time I make this...I will use 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper instead of 3/4 tsp.

Outrageously good.  7 minutes in the oven, flip'm over, 7 more minutes and perfect.  We didn't even bother with dipping sauce they were so flavorful.  But next time I'm going to try the "coconut in the food processor" suggestion, as the texture was a little... off.

Oh my gosh what a decadent dish.    I followed the recipe exactly, baked the shrimp for 18 minutes and they came out perfect.   Wouldn't change a thing.  My husband is already waiting for me tomake it again.
THANK YOU girlbob for sharing.

I put mine on a foil lined pan...either use non stick foil or grease it...they all stuck & could not turn them over...also 20 mins. is too long, they were dry, in saying that I will make them again as I LOVE my shrimp but it will be with these changes.....

Great new recipe for shrimp that was enjoyed by our whole family.  Served with a sweet and spicy sauce, but just as good without one according to my hubby.  Could definitely see using this as an appetizer as well.  It was a nice new way to enjoy shrimp!  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Relatively easy to make, will do nicely as an appetizer at a dinner party. I used unsweetened shredded coconut (very fine), and 2 whole eggs rather than the egg whites. Will make again, with the apricot dipping sauce mentioned in several reviews. Thanks!

This was good, but my first time ever having coconut shrimp, so I wasn't sure what to expect... it was a little too sweet for me, but the flavor was good.  Most of my kids really liked them.  I was surprised at how well the coconut adhered to the shrimp - I thought for sure when I flipped them in the oven, they'd get all messed up, but they didn't and held together perfectly.  I did one batch on my stone and the other on a cookie sheet and the stoneware batch browned up better, but in the end both batches were nice and crunchy.  Since the coconut stuck so well even in the assembly process, I ended up needing about twice the amount of coconut that the recipe called for (also probably why it was too sweet). With all that coconut, it would have served more than 4.  I doubled the recipe, but wish I hadn't for it took forever to prepare and now I have tons left over that I am not sure how to reheat.

These were very very good - would have loved for the topping to stay on a little better, I sprayed my pan well, but they still stuck a bit. Don't be afraid of the amount of cayenne pepper, it is very subtle. Used 30 count shrimp - will use larger ones next time just for faster prep. - loved the suggestion of the dip: 1/2 cup orange marmalade, 2-3 tsp. dijon mustard with horseradish, and a dash of salt!

GREAT recipe!!  I thought these were fabulous!  The only change I made was to use curry powder (about 1 1/2 tsps.) instead of cayenne.  Just because I like curry.  :-)  I was in a bit of a hurry, so I used some pre-made "Sweet Chili Sauce" from my local market.  It was really great!  I also sprayed the prepared shrimp with cooking spray prior to baking, just to be sure they'd be crunchy.  Thanks for this recipe!  I'll use it OFTEN!

I've been frying these little bugs for years, thanks for the awesome alternative!  I can appreciate the lower calorie count too!  For dipping, I use 2 parts orange marmelade mixed with 1 part ranch dressing and a dash of hot sauce. (try it, you'll be hooked)

Really delicious. The result was a little sweet, but if I'd been able to make the orange marmalade sauce other reviewers recommend, it would have been perfect. Next time! I did use one whole egg instead of egg whites. I love how perfectly cooked the shrimp were, I've never baked shrimp before! Great party appetizer.

I also tried this recipe with boneless skinless chicken breasts. It was very good! We have been trying to be more conscious of what we eat these days and the fact that this was not fried really appealed to me. My husband loved it as well and was glad for me to find a new way to fix chicken breasts! Can't wait to try it with shrimp!!!!!

We love this recipe.  I add a few Panko breadcrumbs and granulated garlic to the coating.  I didn't pulse the coconut and it coated just fine.  I lined the baking sheet with parchment paper and baked with no cooking spray.  I turned them after 8 minutes and they were perfect in 7 more minutes.  It was so easy, I'll definitely make this for guests soon.

These came out amazing! Only thing I would change is the amount of cayenne pepper. I'll use half of what is called for next time. Too spicy hot for me.

Taste great!  It is a nice change from the usual weekday meal.  It would have been nice to have had a special sauce to go with it.  I bit dry without something to dip it in.  I will make them again, but I'll be sure to have a sauce for dipping.

Exceptional!  I lean towards veganism but every so often I indulge in wild-caught seafood (and apparently eggs).  I used smaller shrimp (my mistake) but it had no effect on the over recipe except that I had that many more to batter.   I served it with the Fruity Curried Lentil Salad on this site.  The whole meal took me one hour to prepare and I ate my share in 4 minutes flat.

While very tasty, this didn't turn out as crunchy as I expected.  I threw in a few crushed almonds with the coconut flakes thinking that would complement the flavor, but perhaps the nuts ended up taking away from the coconut's ability to toast properly.

I made a pretty good dipping sauce of store-bought sweet & sour sauce, fresh cut pineapple and crushed red pepper blended in a food processor.

Delish! I let the shrimp sit in buttermilk for a bit then dredged as directed. I added Panko breadcrumbs with the coconut as my hubby isn't crazy about coconut. It made them light and crispy. I served with Franks red hot sweet chili sauce. This is a repeat for sure!

It made my whole apartment smell yummy!  I absolutely loved this dish!  It was very easy to make and definitely a healthier alternative to frying the shrimp.  The flavor was zingy and nice.  Iactually needed to bake them longer but it may just be my over.  Thanks!!

These were wonderful the only thing I added was about a 1/2 cup of panko bread crumbs and cooked them on a cookie sheet with a rack. I made a dipping sauce with 1 cup sour cream 1/4 cup crushed pineapple and 1/2 cup pina colda drink mix.

I made this with two whole eggs as suggested and baked for about 20 minutes and they tasted delicious but the coconut didn't hold well and it kind of ruined the meal for me. Good recipe I may have just done something wrong.

Made this as an appetizer tonight.  Was a hit.  Just a couple changes, I don't like spicy so I did not use the cayenne, and reading reviews, I used unsweetened coconut.  Served with sweet n sour sauce and sweet thai chili sauce.

I'm so glad this shrimp is baked so I can eat more without feeling too guilty.  It tastes so good with cooked shrimp but it's much more incredible with raw shrimp.  And if you want to taste the best thing you ever put in your mouth then try it with rum sauce from this site by KDA949.  It's so scrumptious, you'll wish you tried it sooner!!  (Just a note that I used half the cayenne called for with the shrimp and it was the perfect heat without being too hot.)

This was a GREAT recipe! My husband says it was one of the best "new" things we have tried. I followed the recipe exactly but used chopped coconut instead of flaked. I also used my toaster oven and broiled the shrimp for about the last 5 mins to brown them.  I used the orange marmalade recipe "Outback's" that another user posted but added chopped pineapple to it. That was the hit of the night! Really liked that these were baked instead of fried! Thank you for this recipe!

Sadly, this wasn't so great by us.  After going through all the work of deveining and peeling the shrimp, then getting them all individually rolled in the batter, I should have just bit the bullet and fried them.  Baking them in the oven is just not the same, sorry.  They tasted kind of bland and "cakey." We had a ton leftover because no one really loved them, so I melted some butter in a frying pan and reheated them the next day, then used them to make quesidillas, much better.  Next time, I'll probably just go to Red Lobster during their shrimp fest or whatever it's called and enjoy their coconut shrimp without all the slime.

I really liked this recipe for coconut shrimp!  It was very easy to follow but just two things.  One, it's not necessary to put that much ceyenne powder in the recipe unless you like stuff VERY SPICY.  Two, i didn't flip the shrimp and i'm not sure how i would've without getting frustrated.  Also, next time i'll use bigger shrimp (like 30-40) because the coating really over-powered the shrimp.

I followed the recipe exactly, except I used 1 whole egg instead of the egg whites.  I would not do that again because the color of the shrimp looked upappetizing. The coconut never really got too "crunchy".  I have two questions, 1) what count of shrimp is to be used exactly? 2) has anyone tried broiling the shrimp instead of baking?  I think I will try this next time.  Ingredients as listed were right on.

The flavor is delicious and we will be repeating this recipe often. The only issue we had was that there was a LOT of left-over breading, not sure why. We bought almost double the required weight of unpeeled shrimp, figuring it would be about right once peeled. Not so in our case! I'll be prepping a lot less and making as needed in the future. Thanks for sharing, other than the ingredient surplus, we really enjoyed it!

Meh. I guess it was ok if you like coconut shrimp, which I found out my family really did not. It wasn't horrible, but I probably won't make it again just due to personal preference of not liking the sweetness of the coconut with the shrimp.

These were very good.  I would have liked them a little crispier but they tasted great.  My guests loved them.  I added a couple pinches of curry powder and served them with Iron Chef Orange Sauce with Ginger.  Yum.

Just ok, the only good thing is no mess with frying.  But you get what you pay for -- there is no fried coconut taste.  The real fried coconut shrimp is so much better.  I don't think I would try again.

Followed this recipe to a Tee.  For my dippingsauce I used about 2 TBSP. crushed pineapple mixed with about 1/4 cup orange marmalade.  For just two of us, this sauce was more than enough.  It was finger-licking good!!!  I will definitely mke this one again in the future.

We loved this dish.  Easy to make.  I am thinking about experimenting with cooking half the time, freeze and finish baking later. Very surprised at how much a pound of shrimp produced.   We needed to add another egg white.  Like the spice, could turn up the heat if your taste run that way.  Made a dip of orange marmalade, orange juice and some ground ginger.  They disappeared before dinner.

Thank you girlbob for this delicious recipe that we have added to the rotation! My husband prefers fried shrimp, and I prefer anything but fried. We both love coconut. This was the perfect compromise to satisfy both preferences. We used an all-fruit orange marmalade for dipping.

Soooo yummy! I made these for dinner tonight and dipped them in sweet chili sauce served with broccoli madness. My husband did say that it was a tad rich and would prefer it as an appetizer for a holiday or special occasion.

We love coconut shrimp, so when I saw this recipe selected for the Recipe Group recipe of the week, I had to make it!  These were fabulous!  A little messy and time consuming to make, at least for me anyways.  But, I also used a pound of medium shrimp instead of large.  15 minutes baking time was perfect for me.  I flipped half way through the baking time.  They turned out nice and crispy on the outside.  Can't wait to make these again!

I made this recipe , and it was delicious! The only change I made was out of necessity - I only had one egg, so I used the whole egg instead of the three whites. I can't imagine how this could be any better!

I made it tonight and it was delicious. Only changes I made was due to some reviews saying it was too sweet. I mixed half sweetened coconut with half unsweetened. I also pulsed it in food processor to make the shreds a little finer. This worked great, especially since the dipping sauce (from this site) was made with orange marmalade.  I also baked it on a greased rack over a sheet pan to allow convection oven to do it's thing, eliminating the need to flip each shrimp.  A word of warning- I learned the hard way. This recipe does not work well when doubled. The egg started  to settle out making it too liquid by the time I got to the second half. Also the coconut gets too much moisture from the egg toward the end making it clump together and not adhere to the shrimp. I will definitely be making this again but not as a double batch.  I highly recommend the orange marmalade sauce with it.

I loved this recipe!!!  For years, we sought out restaurants that had coconut shrimp.  This recipe was as good as some of the best coconut shrimp we've had and they weren't fried.
I butterflied the shrimp to increase the surface area. 
Next time I'll spray a few with EVOO or cooking spray as one reviewer suggested.

I've made these twice and will do so again. I use 1 part sweetened coconut to 1 part unsweetened. I use a rack over the cookie sheet so I don't need to turn them. I leave them in for 15 minutes; this may depend on the size of shrimp you use.

Absolutely amazing! I used the spicy dipping sauce I found with another baked coconut shrimp recipe (1/2 cup orange marmalade, 2 tablespoons stone-ground mustard, 1 teaspoon olive oil, and 1 teaspoon prepared horseradish). I paired the shrimp with jasmine rice (replacing half the water with coconut milk and stirring in about 1 tablespoon of sweetened condensed milk after cooking). I also served a cucumber salad (enough plain yogurt to lightly coat the diced cucumber and sprinkled with dried basil). These flavors were incredible together and made for a satisfying, light meal. Next time, I'll add steamed snow peas.

Wonderful, yummy. Tried the orange marmalade but found it to be almost too much and covering up the shrimp flavor. Definitely a keeper!
Oh, and tongs, definitely tongs!

This was an amazing recipe.  You can add your favorite dipping sauce, but it's completely unnecessary.  It's both sweet and savory as well as perfectly tender.  Great as a party appetizer or a quiet meal at home.  Prep time was a little longer than 15 minutes, but well worth the effort. A+

These are amazing. We've enjoyed them several times now and will continue to do so. I use extra large shrimp and a whole egg (it's just easier than separating). I make a dipping sauce with about 1/2 cup of pineapple preserves, a tablespoon or so of horseradish and a few drops of hot sauce.....Delicious!

I had never baked my coconut shrimp before so I was looking for a good method. This turned out beautifully and delicious! I did substitute arrowroot starch for the cornstarch (paleo) and adjusted the seasoning to taste (nightshade-free). The arrowroot performed just like cornstarch.

I'm giving this 4 stars based on my husband's rating.  I didn't care for it - I found it too dry, and not through over-cooking. They didn't take as long to cook as the recipe suggested.  I've done them the traditional way in the past by frying in some oil, and I'll go back to that method next time.  I did take the excellent advice of a couple of reviewers to put the coconut through the food processor.

this was ok for us.  i think the cornstarch was a little gummy for me under the coconut.  plus, i know baking it is much healthier than frying, but i think this begs to be fried. ;-)  thanks girlbob

I was really pleased with how this tasted. My only change was adding 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes since I didn't have cayenne pepper. I did chop the coconut in the food processor, and then added the flakes to mix better. It just needed 7 minutes each side. Using aluminum foil is not enough, be sure to spray the tray too. I didn't and then I couldn't flip it without peeling off the coating.

These were delicious! I only made enough for my husband and I to split, but I have the ingredients in the freezer and plan to make them again soon! I wasn't sure if baking would be as good as frying, but I was glad to not have to mess with the oil. They ended up crispy and sweet, without the sliminess of fried shrimp. I think these would be great for guests - you can bread them up beforehand, chill (recommended), then slide in the oven 15 minutes before you plan to eat, and they look and taste spectacular!

Fabulous!! So easy and so delicious! I made the recipe exactly as is and it's perfect. I also made the orange marmalade dip and it compliments the shrimp perfectly. 1/2 cup marmalade, 2 teaspoons ground mustard and 1/2 teaspoon horseradish.

Just made this for dinner and it was delicious and my husband thought they were as good as those he likes at the Outback. I made an orange marmalade dipping sauce that was really good with the shrimp. Thank you for sharing this recipe. I will make it again and certainly recommend others to try it.

This is a great recipe. For the sauce, I used orange marmalade, juice of half an orange and some Ecuatorian chipotle sauce....nuked it for a minute and mixed it all together...altogether a tasty dinner.

Made this according to recipe, turned out great.  My husband who is not a prawn fan and my little son who does not eat much food in general, both grubbed on this!  They were fighting over the coconut "crumbs" leftover on the baking sheet.  I tried it dipped in Asian sweet chili sauce, I liked it better without sauce, hubby liked it better with.

These were certainly not bad, but they were not good enough to keep the recipe, either.  The flavor was mediocre.  As others suggested, I pulsed my coconut so that it would be finer.  I had trouble with the breading adhering to the shrimp, and the coconut never really got nice and crispy.  I will not make this again.

This is a great dish with incredible flavor! However, after baking first batch at 400 for 20 minutes, flipping halway, noticed some burning of the coconut. Set oven at 375 for second batch, they came out much better. Only suggestion i have for this delicious dish!

I used this coating on chicken instead of shrimp, next time I will double the cayenne because you can't really taste it at all... I like a little heat! Other than that it was really good and a great compliment to the meat

I don't cook much, but I committed to learning. My husband did something totally sweet the other night and I wanted to do something special that I have not made before. I pulled up this recipe and thought that it would be fairly easy.   Besides divaining and peeling all the shrimp, it was very easy. It turned out sooooo good. I have never seen my husband so happy to eat my cooking. Thanks a lot and I will probably make this again, even for parties.

I was so impressed with this recipe, it was perfect! Just work fast because the egg whites go flat after about 5 minutes.

Loved this!  My husband and 8 year old daughter did too, but my 6 year old daughter picked off the coconut :(  I might reduce the amount of cayenne next time for the kiddos.  I had no marmalade, so we substituted sweet and sour sauce and it seemed to work fine.

Extremely easy - it probably took longer to shell the shrimp than it did to make the rest of the recipe - it was very tasty - we liked the combination of tangy cayenne pepper and sweet coconut - would definitely make again!

I made this twice and it was great both times!  I'm living in Japan at the moment and I couldn't find "shredded" coconut so much as "coconut powder" stuff, but it worked just the same.  Great that it isn't fried and still yummy!

Made this last night for the first time. It was easy to make and came out perfect. It got crispy, had a little kick (may have used a little more cayanne than the recipe called for) I used an orange marmelade sauce I found online and it was perfect No leftovers! The best thing about it, NO FRYING!

Very tasty and easy to make (aside from cleaning the shrimp-yuck).  So much better than frying!  I also made the marmalade sauce someone included in their review.  That was really good too!

my boyfriend loves red lobsters coconut shrimp so i decided to make this recipe especially since it was baked. i read every review and decided to pulsate the coconut flakes in a food processor so they were a little bit more manageable. wasnt expecting it to be as easy as it was to make so that was a definite plus! wasnt happy when i went to turn over the shrimp that the breading started to come off. i think next time i will either spray the cookie sheet with a lot more oil or use SilPat. i will also bump the heat down to 350 degrees because i noticed that my coconut was kind of burning. but its well worth trying again.

Excellent, easy recipe. Made it with the 31/40 size shrimp which made it alittle time consuming. Think I will try it with the larger shrimp next time. Also made with the orange marmalade/horseradish sauce someone suggested and it was a hit.

Delicious!  My husband isn't even fond of coconut but he asked for seconds.  I also made the orange marmalade with the horseradish mustard and it was a perfect match.

I've been making coconut shrimp for years - fried - and am delighted to see this baked version.  I also make my own dipping sauce - orange marmalade with a bit of hot prepared horseradish (really!) mixed in.  Adds a little bite to it.  It's delicious, try it.

I was skeptical that they would get crisp in the oven but they were great!  It's a little messy and make sure you generously grease/spray pan so they don't stick but way easier than frying.  The bigger the shrimp the better, I got 24 large out of a package of coconut,  hubby loved it!

Amazing, Delicious!! I have been making pecan pie for years but will switch! Everyone loved these and this is better than pie and easier.  I added a cup more pecans and then the next time I make them I am going to add some chopped pecans to the crust also...then they will be perfect!  Yummm!

Absolutely delicious! The only change I would make would be to "pulse" the coconut so it would stick better to the shrimp. I also made the sauce with orange marmalade, seeded mustard and horseradish...yumm!

I love this recipe! Perfect way to save some calories. The sauce that I love to have with this is 1/4 cup of mayo and then 3-4 TBSP of sweet chili sauce. Flavor is amazing.

In answer to Lonster's question, I made this recipe with unsweetened coconut because I thought we'd like it. It was not good at all and did not taste like coconut shrimp. I am sure the recipe will be good when I do it next time with sweetened coconut.

This was a big hit. Everyone loved the shrimp. I heated Smuckers sugar free orange marmalade in the microwave and drizzled it over top of the shrimp. YUM!

I was a little wary of deveining the shrimp since I had never done it before, but it turned out just fine for this Recipe Group recipe of the week.  I bought 1/2 lb. of 36/45 count shrimp and then proceeded to be surprised at how easy they were to "batter."  I baked them for 10 minutes, flipped them, and then cooked them for 8 more minutes.  The coconut was toasted and slightly browned in places. My husband and I enjoyed them.  I used orange marmalade for my dipping sauce.  I wish I had seen abapplez's review to see the copy-cat Outback sauce recipe.  Maybe next time.

Was good. Used  thawed, previously frozen shrimp from Costco. Used a whole egg and not just the white. 16 mins was a bit too long, I would check it well before that for doneness. Mixed apricot jam w/ Grey Poupon and horse radish as a dip. Never really got brown on the coconut but it tasted good.

It came out less crunchy than I thought it would. I followed the directions except I baked them on parchment paper.  The flavor was fine, just not loving the texture.  Maybe I'll try it again, and lose the parchment paper.

I use a combo of this recipe and the one from epicurious.  I toss the coconut with panko crumbs and a little lime zest.  It gives it that perfect crunch and a bit brighter!

This was surprisingly good! I wanted to make shrimp a different and healthier way (vs. sautéing in butter) and I am glad I tried this one. My family LOVED it & their not even coconut lovers! No dipping sauce needed for us! It was time very consuming l, at least for me, because I made 41-60 count medium shrimp. Totally worth it!

I made this tonight and my family loved it. I used unsweetened coconut and I added a dash of onion powder to the cornstarch, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I served it with sweet Thai chili sauce. Compliments all around the table. The same flavour as deep fried shrimp but baked. I will definitely make this one again.

This recipe is not easy! Most shrimp does not come peeled, and I had to double the recipe for my teenagers, so I spent 30-40 mins just messing with shrimp. Then they came out so eggy. Everyone liked it, but it was not easy for me to make. Too many steps.

This is a great recipe.  I think I might like it better as an appetizer than a main dish.  I followed many of the tips given by others.
Definitely: Make sure the egg whites are foamy. Use a food processor to finely chopped the coconut.  The recipe for a dipping sauce consisting of Orange Marmalade, mustard and horseradish is a must given in other reviews is a must.  Next time I will add some finely chopped pecans to the coconut.

First, I purchased  a 1# bag of shrimp so I had about 40 medium shrimp.  It took a very long time  and extra starch mixe, egg whites and coconut. My suggestion is stick to large shrimp unless you are serving as an appetizer.
Also,  I didn't have cayenne pepper so used part red pepper and Spanish Paprika.  That worked very well ! Loved the final results!  A great alternative to frying, no grease.

Delicious!  They were easy to make and quick to bake. I will never make fried coconut shrimp again!  I made the recipe exactly as written. I did not  chop the coconut flakes as some suggested. I attempted to flip them halfway through but decided it wasn’t necessary and they looked prettier unflipped. This one is definitely a keeper!  We ate them too fast to take a pic.

It was delish!  Remember though, peeling the shrimp will add another 15 min prep time.  Add more time to defrost, too.

I'm sure it would be fine as is, I did make the following adjustments:
I used a little flour in with my corn starch. I also added a little old Bay seasoning. I didn't feel like separating eggs, so I used whole eggs.   I mixed a little panko with the coconut (unsweetened), but I've made them with just coconut and that's good, too.   I did use the marmelade for lack of a better choice, but I thinned out with a little water to make it more dipable.    Somewhat tedious deveining and breading the shrimp, but very yummy.

Excellent, will make again.  I made changes due to what I had on hand, 1/2 unsweetened coconut, 1/2 panko  & old bay.  Large Key West Pink shrimp cooked perfectly in 20 mins.  Everyone loved them!

This recipe is delicious  but I would consider it for special occasions because it is rather labor intensive.  I used large prawns so there were less to dip but it was still a long process and a bit messy.  For dipping, used some fig preserve that I thinned with hot water and added a bit of cayenne.  Paired with the curried cashew salad from this site for a very elegant NYE meal.

Recipe is pretty good, I will make again! The only adjustments I made were I added about double the cyan and put my coconut in a food processor to make it more fine, turned out great.

Loved how these shrimp turned out! Baking them is a great alternative to frying and in my opinion, keeps the flavor a bit better. We made an easy sweet and sour dipping sauce with sriracha which worked so well with the sweetness of the shrimp. Will definitely be making again!

Made this last night after coming back from Key West, Florida where coconut shrimp run wild in the street. Immediately, my wife said, "you have to make these for Christmas". Didn't change a thing but next time I will raise the oven temp to 425-450 so the coconut will brown faster (darker) without overcooking the shrimp. Great recipe.

This is actually very good. I could only find unsweetened coconut and the flakes were huge. It still turned out great. I added a little honey to the eggs to sweeten. Would consider using a little less salt. But, delicious.

Incredible! I was skeptical of it being as good as the ratings say because if I’m honest, I can screw up a recipe real quick! But this was so so good! The only thing I did different was turned on the broiler for a minute or two at the end to crisp up the coconut a bit more.
I also made the dipping sauce suggested by others which was stellar! (1 cup Orange marmalade, 2 tsp stone ground mustard, 2 tsp horseradish)

Definitely make it again!  We go shrimping when in season so wanted to try our hand at coconut shrimp. First tried deep frying with coating and coconut but it didn’t stay on so tried baking it. Wow! We were glad we did! We chopped/pulsed  the coconut and that was secret for it sticking to shrimp.  Will definitely use this recipe again and again! Thanks for all the tips!

Made this a few weeks ago when the kids were home. It was great. I have a question. They want it for thanksgiving as an appetizer the night before. Has anyone made the prepared the shrimp ahead of time and simply popped them in the oven ?

I have been making several coconut shrimp recipes lately, both fried and baked.  This one is the best.  In order to get that evenly browned look and crunchy taste,  I tweaked the coconut.  First I pulsed it until quite fine in a small food processor, and then I LIGHTLY toasted it a large  frying pan in 2 batches.  Then made as directed, gently pressing the coconut to the shrimp on both sides and the ends.  It adhered well.   When it baked. it browned a little more and gave me the appearance and crunch I was seeking... perfect.   I sprayed the pan with Pam, and for large shrimp, I baked 7 minutes on each side and lightly sprayed Pam on the top just before turning.  To cut even more calories and reduce sugar,  I  used 1/2 cup Polaner's Sugar free Orange Marmalade, 2 tea horseradish , 2 tea stone ground dijon mustard,  1 pkg of Equal, and a pinch of salt for the marmalade.  This is a much healthier  version of one of my favorite foods.  Worthy of  special company, but I'll be making it often for the family.

Very tasty, despite two mis-steps. First,  I combined the flour and coconut. Secondly, I used unsweetened coconut as that was all I had on hand. I made the orange marmelade sauce and heated it up a bit with more horseradish and red pepper.
I will correct my errors and hope the next batch will be out standing.

It was just OK.  I made it just as the recipe stated.  It needed "something", maybe a little more zip or hot sauce added to it.  I dunno, I'll have to tweak it to a better recipe for myself and my Husband.

I used UNsweetened coconut flakes.  Loved it!  The cayenne does provide a real kick, which can be lessened with a fruity or tangy dipping sauce of your choice.  I just stirred together apricot preserves and a little dijon mustard.  Was perfect!  I will be making again but with little or no cayenne to suit other more sensitive tastebuds.  Great, fun, finger food dish with no gluten-containing ingredients, that can be made healthy!

The coconuts were not the best option for me, so I used pecans instead. I also doubled the recipe for the portion size of my co-workers. The frozen shrimp also works; be sure to defrost this, beforehand.

Loved it.   I was skeptical that the method the recipe used would hold the coconut onto the shrimp but it was excellent and so much better than the fried version.   Will definitely make this one again!

SO tasty!!! Very easy to make, and both my husband and I loved it. I have to try unsweetened coconut the next time to see how it tastes as it does end up being quite high in sugar.

So yummy! We all loved these! I didn’t have enough corn starch so used a combo of it and tapioca flour. The 1/3 c. and the 3 egg whites were enough for two pounds of shrimp. I didn’t measure the coconut, just refilled my bowl when it was empty. I baked them for 8 minutes, turned and did 10 more minutes and they stuck to the pan. Must spray well! These took a long time to prepare! If I make them again, I will try a different method. Maybe stirring a handful at a time into the corn starch would make it faster?

This is a fantastic recipe - easy to follow, simple ingredients, quick baking time. 
Next time I would put the coconut in a food processor, like others have suggested, because although the coconut stuck fine, it was a little overwhelming in such big pieces. Will be making these shrimp again!

These are wonderful!  Easy to make, crispy, and best of all I don't have to deal with the greasy/splattery mess of frying them.  I made them exactly per the recipe and would not change a thing.  The cayenne pepper gives them a little kick underneath the coconut that I enjoy -- those with weak taste buds might want to forego the cayenne.

Yumm... made this and was a special treat for my  family. I used unsweetened coconut as that was what I keep at home and it was delicious. My kids loved it even my picky eater was asking for more. Make sure to crease pan well some of the shrimp stuck and when i flipped them pulled off the coating. We used Thai Chili sauce for dipping

Our Family:  4 children under 11 

They boys including my husband dug right in!  The girls were undecided whether they would try it.  But once they did, they asked for seconds.  The girls then complimented how delicious it was as if they were at a seafood restaurant by the beach.

Changes:  Used the gallon baggy approach.  Since with 6 people eating about 10 -12 shrimp a piece, the one by one method  would've taken me hours.  I needed more coconut as some of it gets wet and doesn't stick.

Excellent Dish!!!

After reading the reviews I did pulse the coconut in food processor, otherwise followed the directions. The recipe was easy and the results turned out pretty good. 
I did not take into consideration the larger size of my shrimp and they could have bake a couple of minutes more which would have helped with crisping the coconut a little more. Thanks goes to Erin, a reviewer, for sharing her dipping sauce recipe. It added flavor to the shrimp. I will make this again.

This was delicious, easy, and fast. We all loved it, and the five stars was the unanimous vote!  I made it exactly like the recipe and used orange marmalade for a dipping sauce.

This was fantastic!  It didn't taste quite the same as having it in a restaurant - but that's because it wasn't fried.  We will be making this again.  I followed the other reviews and made the orange dipping sauce.

This is not a bad recipe at all!  I was disappointed with the crispness so when I flipped the shrimp at 8 minutes, I gave them a spray with some Pam.  It seemed to help crisp up the exterior.  I had pretty big shrimp so I baked for 17 minutes and the shrimp were perfectly cooked.   I will probably make this again, but will try to remember to make the pina colada dipping sauce copycat from Red Lobster to go with it.

The sweetness overpowered the shrimp. I used half sweetened and half plain flaked coconut (and took the advice of others and pulsed it to make it a little finer), but for me, it was still too sweet. I put mine in the preheated oven for 15 mins and that was enough. I will use this recipe again but use even less sweetened coconut next time.

This was really good!  I used unsweetened coconut flakes - might have been too sweet with sweetened.  The sauce recommended by other reviewers was delish!  Orange marmalade, horseradish & dijon mustard.  Yum!

I hate to be the dissenter on this since obviously so many love it, but these just didn't work out well for me.  The baking process didn't turn out well and I ended up making another batch and frying them.  In the future I would probably add some seasoning to the egg whites as well.  The ones that I fried turned out well, but that kind of defeats the whole purpose of this recipe.

Recipe does not explain shrimp per pound count; I used 21-25,  cooked them 15  minutes which was perfect for their size. Also, I mixed half shredded sweetened coconut and half unsweetened which made an excellent combination of coating the shrimp and crisping them up. I served them with an apricot jam and horseradish sauce recipe found on this site and they were delicious!

This recipe was fantastic, even better because it wasn't deep fried! Husband liked it too. I cooked the shrimp the entire 20 minutes, did not burn, light golden brown when finished  cooking.  Next time,  I will make the accompanied dipping sauce that  fellow reviewer "Allison" wrote about, it sounds perfect.  Thanks!

Came out nice and crunchy,shrimp were large so cooked for 20 minutes.. The coconut could have been a little sweeter,perhaps the type I had.  My husband does most the cooking now,I just prep. We would make again.

Very good recipe. I like that it was simple and did not require a lot of ingredients. I made it and paired it with a piña colada dipping sauce. That really added to the recipe and everybody loved it. Just one note: if you do not like anything spicy I would reduce the amount of Cayanne pepper (or eliminate it). I did not think it was spicy, however my father who can’t have anything spicier than ketchup thought it was too spicy.

Absolutely wonderful. The only thing I did different was use two large whole eggs instead of the whipped egg whites. This recipe has been added to my family favorites collection!

A little messy to prepare but easy to cook, tastes great and a much healthier option. I LOVE the cayenne kick!  Haven't found a dipping sauce I like but definitely don't even miss it.

I didn't change anything - this was great and so easy to make.  Next time I will try adding the shrimp to the coating mix in a bag instead of on a plate to reduce the mess.  
Marmalade, Dijon mustard and Tabasco made a good dipping sauce, and the leftover shrimp went in a tortilla wrap with salad the next day.  
Will be making this recipe often.

The batter and breading was spot on. I could see maybe wanting finer coconut and less. I found it too sweet, but my husband used spicy sauce and found it perfect. I will see about making it again.

Excellent recipe! I followed the recipe exactly and was surprised that the coconut crisps up by baking it instead of frying. No changes necessary.  I served this with a sweet n sour dipping sauce mostly because I did not have orange marmalade but I'm buying it for the next time I make this. This came together quicker than I anticipated, another plus!

Awesome, easy meal with a healthier twist! I served the shrimp with coconut rice, steamed snap peas and fresh pineapple chunks and my kids snarfled it up! The only tweaks: I baked them for about 5 minutes longer, but my oven may be running slow. I'd say check them at 15 mins and decide for yourself.  I also sprayed the tops of the coated shrimp with a very little cooking spray to toast and brown the coconut a bit better. I'm considering different flavors of marmalade/jam to serve them with. The orange marmalade was great but they might be even better with something tangy like apricot.

Used unsweet coconut and added my own little bit of stevia.  I used smaller shrimp than I would have preferred and maybe that's why we didn't love these but there were half still left over 3 days later.  That's a sign to me as things are typically gobbled up pretty fast around here

I didn't have corn starch so I substituted flour instead.  Also I didn't have orange marmalade for the dipping sauce so I juiced 1 orange and added it to 1 tbs of peanut sauce.  It made a nice substitution.  Next time I'll make it as described in the recipe, but this was fine also.  I need to go grocery shopping!

We did this as a main meal. rice and salad as sides.  Unsweetened coconut was the way to go.  I could only find flaked unsweetened coconut, ran it through the food processor it worked fine. The orange marmalade, horseradish, Dijon dip was perfect too.

We really enjoyed these! I wish I had made the full recipe instead of cutting it down for 2. I ran the coconut through my mini food processor as suggested by several. Also used an apricot pineapple Marmalade to which I added a bit of horseradish and Dijon mustard. Baked for 15 minutes, flipping half way through. Can't wait to make this again!

I really got the egg whites foamy ... then i foamed them up again halfway through preparing the shrimp,  it was my hunch that the whites was where the crunch would be??, i thought of it as a merengue crusted shrimp. i don't know if this was why but, they were crispy!  also used a fine coconut and parchment and some cooking spray.. took no chances! also seasoned with yellow curry powder and garam masala onion and garlic powder

It was really good, it was longer than expected but at the end I shook everything together to save time. Even without the dipping sauce, it was delicious, sweet and spicy.

This is very light version of coconut shrimp.  My husband made it and he found it labor intensive and had trouble with getting the coconut to stick to the shrimp.  I like the flavor of the shrimp but definitely would like more coconut sticking to it.  

We may make it again as it isn't fried, but definitely I need to supervise the dredging next time.  Also, we didn't have a dipping sauce.  It is hard to beat Red Lobster's coconut shrimp and that is what I was really craving.

I will certainly make it again. I'm not one for spicy stuff so I just added a dash of the cayenne. It was fabulous!

Just as simple and quick as the recipe outlined!

I will definitely make it again. I put it on the barbecue  so the fishy smell wouldn't great my guests. You have to watch it carefully so it doesn't burn. I put it on a flat barbecue griddle lined with foil and sprayed with Pam.The few that did burn a bit on the bottom were delicious too! The marmalade, horse radish, grainy hot mustard sauce was yummy.

This is pretty  good.  I used a few ideas from other reviews although didn't defer from ingredients.   After coating I sprayed shrimp with coconut oil (you can buy a spray can of this from Trader Joes).  I also baked them on parchment paper and removed any excess coconut from the tray so it wouldn't burn.  I coated a couple of pieces twice to see what would happen and it was way too thick.  Coat only once.  I also put some on a tray and froze them before cooking then put them in a freezer container for future use.   If you are near a place where you can buy bulk coconut both sweetened and unsweetened it helped to use half sweetened and half unsweetened.  I served mine with a simple ketchup, lemon juice and "hot" plain horseradish.  They were wonderful.

This is a fantastic recipe. I recommend pairing the shrimp with a copy cat recipe for Red Lobsters pina colada dipping sauce. I worked at Red Lobster for 8 years and this is a much healthier version of their appetizer and tastes just as good!

This was delicious and super easy. I started with frozen easy-peel shrimp. I put in cold water to thaw for 20 minutes. I then peeled all the shrimp. Mine were already de-veined. The coating ingredients were the perfect amount, except the coconut. I found that I had about a cup left. I think next time I will cut it back by half a cup since I would hate to run out. I just served mine with honey mustard. Also, I used unsweetened coconut flakes from Bob's Red Mill. They were finely shredded, so I didn't need to pulse them as others recommended.

These were really good for being baked.  I added a little bit of oil to the batter and dumped the shrimp in the bag to get them well- coated, afterwards I added the flour mixture to the bag and shake and baked. I also sprayed them with coconut oil prior to baking to make the "crunch-fried" effect. Everyone loved them and I will definitely make them again.

Made it with extra large shrimp and used 1/2 sweetened and 1/2 unsweetened coconut.  Baked at 425 for 15 min.  Came out perfect.  Used store bought Thai sweet chili dipping sauce. Yummy

This was very good.  My husband made it for me for Mother's Day and I like that it's not fried.  I agree that you should pulse the coconut a bit in the food processor or blender just to break it up a little.  The coconut was a bit too big.  Also,  next time I think we should lightly spray the coconut coated shrimp with cooking spray (i use olive oil) just before baking.  I think it will help it to crisp a bit.  He made a pina coloda dipping sauce for it (was a little runny cuz he didn't know you were sposed to drain the pineapple, lol) and it was a great combo.

I made this but changed some things.

I baked it on parchment paper not sprayed with cooking spray and it didnt stick.

i dredged the shrimp in an egg mixture of paprika- garlic- adobo and black pepper whisked together and then covered both sides of the shrip with cocunt and played on baking sheet.

cook in over at 350 for 10 mins, flip shrimp and cook another 10 minutes or until you see the shrmip are pink and the coconut is browned.

it delicious.

This is the perfect alternative to frying! My family loves coconut shrimp and I used to make it in my deep fryer and serve on paper towels to drain the oil. Until that is, I found this perfect recipe! My family asked if I used a different oil because it tasted so much better!...I just smiled and said yes. So much healthier, easier and actually safer as I don't have to fry in hot oil!

Delicious! Tastes just as good as fried. The cornstarch is key, it makes everything hold together perfectly. Highly recommend!

This was super easy. My five year old and I made it and we had a blast. The timing on the shrimp was perfect. Yeah, it was like having shrimp macaroons, but it was so easy it was worth it. 

On a side note, my five year old won't even eat shrimp. I followed the same simple directions with sliced extra firm tofu for him and it came out like little macaroons. He was psyched to have them with his Pad Thai.

very yummy!  A bit messy to make, but so worth it.  I ended up needing more of the cornstarch mix than the recipe calls for, but other than that, I have no complaints!!

Made this for a potluck and it was a hit! I did the recipe exactly as stated. I just processed the coconut flakes as someone else had suggested. I also sprayed them on top with cooking spray prior to putting in oven. I made a sauce from someone else's suggestion of 1/2 cup apricot preserves, 1 Tbsp Soy sauce, 1 Tbsp rice wine vinegar and left out the 1 tsp Asian chili sauce, as I didn't have any on hand (thought I did when I went to the store!) I put the sauce in the blender to blend it smoothly. Everyone LOVED it. The cayenne pepper helped to offset the sweetness of the coconut. Will definitely make this again!

With the coconut, the shrimp was excellent.  But, using the two cups, I ran out of coconut so I used bread crumbs on the rest and it was WAY too spicy.  So, I'd suggest purchasing more coconut.

Followed the recipe to the t. It was good, but not perfect. Going to try the fried version next to see if adding a bunch of oil to it will make it better.

These shrimp turned out delicious! I also made the referenced orange marmalade sauce. Overall I think this is a tad sweet as a main course but perfect for an appetizer. It was a little time-consuming so I will try to make in advance when entertaining, glad to hear others commenting that is possible with the same results.

I made this recipe as shown.  Great!!!  Baking the shrimp was easy and healthier than frying.  The coconut stayed on the shrimp.  I have tried to fry them in the past, using a different recipe, and a lot of the batter fell off in the frying pan.  this recipe is a keeper!!  I made the orange marmalade sauce from another chef that posted on here.   1 cup orange marmalade, 2 Tbls horseradish and 2 Tbls Dijon mustard.   I have made this recipe a few times.  ALWAYS got compliments!

This was okay. I wasn't happy with the way they turned out. My shrimp overcooked and the coconut wasn't ready.  Maybe it was my oven and I will need to give it another try.

These turned out soooo good. Fried food is my weakness, so to find a baked version of this that was just as good was such a joy! I took another users advice and mixed marmalade with horseradish and that was a good dip.

Loved it! Made for my husband on his birthday...scored! I will definitely make this again :) 

The only changes: parchment paper, spayed shrimp with olive oil, 1/2 of teaspoon of smoked paprika and garlic powder, only 8 minutes on each side. Oh, I used 1 whole egg only.

These were ok but not great. It a lot of work, very messy, and shrimp were quite dry. The marmalade sauce made the dish for hubby and me. 1/2 cup Polmers sugar free marmalade, 2tsp stone ground mustard w/seeds, 1tsp horseradish, pinch of salt.

Easy. I used U12-15 shrimp along with unsweetened coconut flakes.  I'm not a fan of too much sweetness and I find coconut rich as is.  Recipe was easy to follow and prep was simple.  I listened to others here and pulsed the coconut flakes to a finer ground.  Sprayed parchment paper with oil and cooked eight minutes on first side.  Another five after flipping.  Came out perfect.  Use your favorite dipping sauce.   It's a great, easy recipe and clean up is a breeze.

My husband is pretty picky about coconut shrimp and he loved this.  He agreed it was just as good as fried coconut shrimp.  I made an apricot sauce using 1/2 cup apricot preserves, 2 tsps stone ground mustard and 1 tsp prepared horseradish.

Tastes great however, I was not able to get crisp brown coconut at a  400 degree oven, I had to turn the oven up to  450 to get crisp but  was worried about over cooking the shrimp.

We loved the flavor but I must have done something wrong.   I followed the recipe exactly as given, but it was a mess to put together.  Shouldn't the steps be dip in egg white, dip in corn starch, then roll in coconut?  Luckily we are not slaves to picture perfect meals and we enjoyed the shrimp, but I doubt I'll make it again.  Has anyone tried skipping the corn starch mixture completely?  We try to avoid carbs as much as possible, but I made an exception for this recipe since it was my first try (I change things around after being faithful the first time).  Any suggestions for future tries are welcome.  Also I used Bob's Red Mill shredded coconut which was on my shelf, and it is already in tiny pieces so one can skip the pulsing step many suggested.

I made it for DH b/c he loves coconut whereas I don't.   Yet, I loved it and he was hi-hum about it.  His complaint was that he couldn't taste the coconut.  I could.   I followed other posters suggestions to shred the coconut a little finer and I'm glad I did.  Did not make a dipping sauce, store bought cocktail was fine.  I cooked shrp for 17 min.

I followed the recipe to the T and it turned out perfect . I lined the pan with aluminum foil and cleanup was a breeze . I did toss the coconut into my blender and minimized it a bit . It was exactly what I needed to impress my guests . Thanks for sharing

I made these last night and my husband loved them! I only had Apricot preserves so I warmed it in the microwave and added some red pepper flakes. I may try it with the whole eggs next time so I don't waste the yokes. I don't think I would chop up the coconut, I think the tiny pieces would get annoying in my teeth. :)

Wow! Excellent recipe! The shrimp was really good with Sweet Chile Sauce, rather than marmalade. Also, I used unsweetened coconut flakes. For next time, I will use less salt.

This is a fantastic recipe, very easy, very good!  I added a little more cayenne pepper the 2nd time.  Both times I used unsweetened organic coconut which was really really good and added an even healthier twist without the sugar.

This recipe was really good and super easy. I like that it's baked shrimp, not fried shrimp, which is huge for me. I will most definitely make this again. :)

Sound cooking concept, too salty. I found finely milled unsweetened coconut at  Winco bulk food section.  'Combined it with regular sweetened flake coconut, which balanced the coating better, I thought.  Next time I'll omit the 1 t salt, turn the heat up to 425.  Overall worthwhile, shrimp stay moist, nice peppery bite, moderately crunchy.

Delicious!!  Actually, I made the recipe with chicken  as I had some tenders to use up and it worked great.  I used 2 lbs. of tenders and 2 whole eggs (hate to waste those yolks).  The amount of egg and cornstarch mix was just right for the chicken.  I had to add about another cup of coconut (not quite the whole bag).  The tenders were fairly large so I cooked on 400 for about 12 minutes per side.  I made the orange dipping sauce as per the Allison review.  I made 1 1/2 times of that recipe which was perfect to use up the 18 oz jar of marmalade.  (I used the jar to store the extra sauce).  I'll make this again for my sons when they are home for the holidays. Hubby loved it; served with baked sweet potatoe, salad and corn bread.  This is an easy recipe and is different from the usual chicken.  Thanks for this recipe!

I made this last night for a girls' get-together and it was a hit! Simple to make and delicious. I did make a few modifications. As I didn't have any cornstarch onhand, I used brown rice flour mixed with about a tbsp of baking powder and the salt. I also used two full beaten eggs as yolks are so healthy. Skipped the cayenne as nobody in our group is a big fan of it. We were also using a convection oven to bake them so didn't need to flip them, but in a conventional oven I definitely would. I also combined the remaining coatings (flour, baking powder, salt, eggs, coconut) into a batter and poured it into a muffin tin - was just enough for one! - and it turned out a delicious coconut biscuit that would make a great stand-alone recipe as well! All around, very happy with the results of the recipe and will definitely make it again. :)

Absolutely delish...  I also sprayed the shrimp with vegetable  oil to give it extra crisp. I served with apricot dipping sauce. That recipe came from coconut tilapia with apricot dipping sauce. Not a fan of fried foods especially frying in the house so this was perfect.

I loved this coconut shrimp! I read that somebody said they were too sweet so I added a little bit of red pepper flakes to half of them, in case I didn't like it, but it added some nice heat that went great with the sweetness of the coconut. I liked them without the red pepper flakes too though. I didn't think they were too sweet.

I bought large frozen raw, deviened shrimp with the tail on so I didn't have to shell the shrimp. Defrosted them overnight. Followed recipe exactly and my husband and I loved it! It is so yummy that you don't even need the dipping sauce but I made the marmalade, horseradish and dijon mustard that other reviewers recommended.  it is perfect with the shrimp. You will wow your guests with this one. I have a small convection oven and baked at 350 instead of 400 due to convection increase in temperature. Just keep your eye on them and definitely flip them halfway. You will be the hit of the party with this one for sure. FYI a fish monger told me that ALL shrimp are frozen, many right on the shrimp boats so there is no such thing as "fresh" shrimp. If you see raw shrimp in the store, it has been defrosted.

I finally made these and took them to a party. I didn't have cayenne pepper so I substituted black pepper and some chile flakes and it seemed to work. I also ran the coconut through the food processor to make it a little finer. Served with a mango dipping sauce and everyone really liked them. Will definitely make again!

This recipe has exceptional flavor and turns out just like the picture.  We did add extra spice with more cayenne on half of them, as some of us like our mouth to burn.

Easy to make and very tasty, especially love that fact that it's not fried, as I hate the oil smell.  As others suggested, flip the shrimps halfway to get it crispy on both sides, but turn carefully as the coating might come off.  I used parchment paper for ease of clean up.

I always avoided coconut shrimp in my kitchen because of the frying mess and the less than healthy dose of oil. This recipe worked out quite well. I increased the cayenne to a full tsp.I tried reducing coconut, but found I still needed 1.5 cups. For the dipping sauce, I used 1 cup or so of Orange marmalade, a heaping TBS of Dijon mustard and a TSP of horseradish.

I found the preparation of this dish to be frustrating.  The coconut would not stick well or thoroughly to the shrimp.  I followed the exact recipe and directions so I'm not sure why this happened.  I haven't baked it yet so I'm hopeful the taste will make up for the frustration of putting it together.

A repeat recipe in our home. Easy and very nice for something special or just because you enjoy coconut shrimp.I didn't have cornstarch so used flour, worked fine. I didn't do the full pound as we wouldn't have 'enjoyed' the rest of the evening tomorrow may be an encore it was that SIMPLE. Used the whole egg rather then just the whites worked well.

Oh my goodness!  This is really good..not so pretty but really good!  Used 40 cooked jumbo shrimp from Sam's (which weren't so jumbo).  Followed recipe except increased to 1tsp of cayenne pepper and used 1 cup sweetened and 1 cup non sweetened coconut.  You MUST invest in parchment paper.  It is so easy to cook with....no sticking at all.  Didn't have horseradish..didn't matter.  Used some peach/apricot spread I had in the fridge.

As far as the recipe goes, it works fine. Just too sweet using sweetened coconut. I might try it again but would have to use unsweetened with a bit of sweetened coconut mixed in.

I made coconut chicken with this recipe. It had a great flavor, but my husband and I agree that there was too much coconut. I would put less on next time. Overall, very good recipe! I like the little added kick in it!

These were awesome. I used fine coconut and followed the recipe to a T and they were great. They didn't brown in 20 minutes..i actually had them in for 25 mintues and the coconut never browned but still cooked all the way. The sauce I used was 1 cup mango chutney, 1 cup honey, 1/2 cup djion mustard, and 4 drops of hot sauce. Perfect!

would rate this 4 and a half stars.  Next time I will use half sweetened and half unsweetened coconut.  For sure I will make this over the Christmas holidays.  Not as good as what I get in Mexico...but then, it is a whole lot healthier.  I wonder if dipping in flour would be better for me then corn starch...I will check that out as well.  Yum!!!!!!

These were okay, not outstanding. I'm rating based on the preparation and texture factors only, since I followed recipe in these areas to a T. I found the egg dip & cornstarch coating would fall off into the coconut when pressing coconut onto shrimp. Pressing it on was only way I could get it to stick. Very messy and frustrating. I baked according to temp & time directed and found the coconut coating to not be browned or crispy/crunchy, so had to increase bake time. My oven temp runs true as I am a professional baker and had just tested my oven temp for accuracy. Do to these important aspects of the recipe I based my rating. As far as taste they were very good! I did pulse the coconut in food processor for a finer flake. My husband is not big on spicy so I did cut back on the cayenne. These were the only small differences I made to recipe.

Really easy and delish. I bought finely shredded, unsweetened coconut so the pieces were very small and used 2 whole eggs as I didn't see using the yolks anytime soon and didn't want to waste them! I greased the baking sheet very well with coconut oil and did not have a problem with sticking. The shrimp were perfectly done at 5 minutes for each side. Served them with a marmalade/dijon/horseradish sauce, coconut lime rice (from AR), and steamed broccoli.

The shrimp taste good. They didn't look great, after flipping they would get real messy, and I felt it was hard to get the coconut to stay stuck to the shrimp. Would possibly make again as an appetizer. I served with the orange marmalade / horse radish sauce others recommended.

This was a great recipe!  I used unsweetened coconut and two whole eggs instead of egg whites (because I'm too lazy to separate and too cheap to buy liquid egg whites.  Came out fantastic!  I'll definitely make it again.

Loved this, although for me the baking time was way off.  I baked 15 min and it was too long.  Made some changes as others suggested.  Used 1/2 t salt, 1/2 t Old Bay seasoning (would increase next time), one beaten egg w 1 t water, and probably about 1 1/3 c sweetened coconut (whirled in the food processor).  Oh, I also baked them on a cookie cooling rack, so both sides would brown.  Should have also sprayed the rack with Pam.  Sprayed the top of the shrimp though and they browned.

This is an ok to like for me.  It possibly could be my fault for not using larger shrimp but I used what the grocery store had in the seafood dept.  Too small I think.  I used tin foil and used Pam but they still stuck.  I also did take the advice and chopped up the coconut to smaller pieces.  The recipe for the marmalade dip was great! And just a little advice - because you don't see the cayenne in the cornstarch does not mean it's not there!  They had a bite but I think that is because I used more than what it called for.

Excellent and even heart healthy! Followed the ingredients exactly. Took the advice of other reviewers and 1)pulsed the coconut 2)put cornstarch, salt and pepper in a plastic bag and put shrimp in the bag. Shake it till all is covered 3)Did ahead and left in fridge until ready to cook. I didn't even need to turn them as the bottoms were golden! Thanks for the recipe.

Really enjoyed this meal.  Followed recipe exactly and it came out great.  Found a copycat recipe online for Red Lobster's coconut dipping sauce.  Also took a suggestion mentioned here for an apricot/Dijon mustard/horseradish sauce which was also tasty with these shrimp.  Served with a Caesar salad and garlic bread sticks.  Definitely going into my recipe box!

These were awesome, even better than expected! I used 21/25 shrimp and baked 8 minutes each side. Served with white jasmine rice and the Cucumber Salad With Thai Sweet Chili Vinaigrette recipe from this site, we used sweet chili sauce for dipping. It was awesome!

was great.  Used 2 whole eggs with 1tsp. water. Wonderful to not be fried. Added full tsp. cayenne. Had a peach/pineapple salsa, so used that. Will try with the marmalade next time. I didn't measure coconut, just added as needed to the bowl. Used less than called for.

This was a huge hit tonight for dinner! I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and  put the coconut in my food processor, however at the end of my batch I was running out of coconut.  I pulled out some panko breadcrumbs and mixed it with the remaining coconut.  The result was fantastic! I will be making this frequently!

Wow!  I can't believe how crunchy these were.  I've tried other oven (fried/baked) recipes that turned out soggy but these were great.  I did't have enough coconut on hand so I mixed in some panko; they turned out fine but, can't wait to try it when I have more coconut.

I broiled shrimp for about 2 mins. each side after baking for 20 mins. just was not crispy enough. I was afraid of overcooked shrimp but they were just right. I still needed to rate 5 stars because it is an awesome recipe without needing to fry the shrimp. I did use large shrimp. Maybe I could of dried the shrimp off more before dredging in flour/egg mixture to help make them crisp or frothed the egg white a bit more. I did refrigerate for about 1 hr. before baking.

Made these last night. Sweet and yummy. My kids loved them. I used 2 cups of coconut, because I doubled the recipe. There are 6 of us. I did not use the cayenne pepper. I am too fair for it, it iritates me. You could not taste the difference that it wasn't there. I will definitly make again. They did stick on the wax paper. Next time I will spray it. I was afraid it might make the shrimp too oiley.

Loved it as written.  Had some leftover and the next day they were great; reheated from room temp 1 minute in microvwave.
Will try next time as an appetizer using chichen.

Easy to make, big hit with all the family!!  I would add about 25% more coconut as it gets used up quickly in the prep process.  Thanks for great recipe!

I made a half-recipe using one whole egg.  Turned out great.  Made the maralade dip mentioned in another comment and also tried Yoplait Pina Colada yogurt.  Both dips were excellent with these however the yogurt let the full flavor of the shrimp come through.  Although this deserves 5 stars as-is, I'm going to try substituting powdered ginger for the cayenne pepper when I make this again next week.  Girlbob, thanks for sharing this!

OK, but won't make again, prefer the fried coconut shimp. I will use the dipping sauce that was suggested again.

We enjoyed a shrimp dish  like this at Red Lobster only with a pina colada dip.  The only thing that I would do different is make a pina colada dip, otherwise they were delightful little nuggets.

Excellent!  I used medium sized shrimp and next time I will use jumbo, but the cayenne pepper combined with the sweet coconut is to die for.  The fact that you can have crispy, crunchy shrimp that is baked rather than fried is a huge plus. This is a keeper.

The taste of this was pretty good but for me it is too much work I'm not a very coordinated cook). I gave it 4 stats for the taste but for the work I won't bother making again.

Delicious!  We don't get sweetened coconut in New Zealand so I just used long thread coconut and it turned out fine.  I served the shrimp with a  dipping sauce made with 1/2 cup mayonnaise, 1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar, 2 tablespoons Thai sweet chilli sauce (add more if you like it spicier)and a good slosh of ketchup.    My favourite restaurant serves something similar as an appetizer and they use chopped cashews as well as coconut in the coating and serve the shrimp with a curry mayonnaise.

There is absolutely nothing but great about this recipie. I made it as stated. I loved the way the Frothy egg white made the coating so crispy with out adding a lot of calories. I used that egg white that I am not having success with angel food cake (I have one more container to use with that stuff) and it got just fine for the coconut coating.

Overall this was a great recipe! I liked the flavor of the orange marmalade for serving but I think with the sweetness of the coconut, it made the dish a tad too sweet. I think next time I will try a 50/50 mix sweetened and unsweetened coconut. Will definitely be making again. Thanks!

These were very good.  Next time I will use jumbo shrimp; this time I used large and I had more shrimp then I had coating & coconut for.  Plus they are messy to make!  I also used Pam on the cookie sheet and next time I'll spread vegetable oil.  The flavor is excellent and the cayenne pepper added just enough zip.

I really like the flavor and the outback sauce is fabulous.  The shrimp had a nice crunch and I would recommend using large or jumbo prawns.  The only negative thing I can say is that the shrimp is a little dry.... Not sure how to avoid this when baking instead of frying...

Somewhat disappointing but my husband liked them.  I wont be making them again.  I found that all I could taste was the coconut.  I used med-size (31-40)Perhaps large ones would be better.

This recipe was delicious. I wasn't able to flip mine without the coconut falling off but I'm brand new to cooking so I guess I'll try harder next time. The Outback imitation sauce recommend by another review was amazing as well!
