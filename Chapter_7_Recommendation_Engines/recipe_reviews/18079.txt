Excellent. I made these in the oven, 350* for 25 min. I added garlic powder spicy montreal steak seasoning and worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture. I also added garlic cloves to the packets and butter on top. Definately will be making again and again.

My whole family loves these!  We've had this dish several times.  I like to see other variations, so here's what I do a little different.  I add about a tablespoon of cream of mushroom soup with garlic on top of the raw meat before adding the veggies, and closing the packet.  That way it makes it's own gravy, and it is GOOD, GOOD, GOOD!  Thanks for the great recipe, Michelle!

I just wanted to add a note although i didn't make this exact recipe... my uncle and mother have been making these for years, pretty much the only difference is Cheese... lots of cheese melted over all the ingredients!  Can't go wrong! Also adding a1 to the ground beef always adds a bit of extra zing... Great to make and throw in the cooler for camping! Happy grilling...

This is a quick, convenient, comfort food meal that can easily be adjusted to feed many or a few.  For each packet I sliced some regular carrots in place of the baby carrots and added some sliced fresh mushrooms.  Also drizzled a good amount of olive oil over the top of the vegetables before sealing the packets.  I scaled the recipe to 3 servings which reduced the ground beef to 1 pound.  To the ground beef I mixed in 2 tsps Worcestershire sauce, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp onion powder, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp black pepper, 1-1/2 tsps Italian seasoning and 2 tbsp of roasted garlic ketchup. Thanks Michelle.  This is a great recipe when you want a good dinner without a lot of dishes to clean up.

Our family has been making a variation of this recipe for about fourty years.
We call it "Hobo Dinners", and always make it on the grill when camping. The
only difference is that we add a couple slices of fresh tomatoes as the top
layer, it adds great flavor and always keeps everything nice and moist. We take
a family camping trip every summer, and now have four generations making
their "Hobo Dinner".

This is absolutely the best recipe I have ever gotten off the internet. I cannot begin to describe how good it was! My 3 year old (who is a picky eater) LOVED it and even asked for seconds! My 1 year old gobbled it up! I will be making this again soon and am sure it will become a tradition in my family. 
I did add a couple of things- to the hamburger, I mixed in some worcestershire sauce, season all and an egg. I also put a pad of butter on top after placing the veggies in.
It has definitely become my family's favorite meal!
*****5 stars!!*****

I too sprinkle McCormick's Montreal Steak seasoning to the patties and add worcestershire sauce. It is a "must" at our house--per the husband! Just a good "meat-and-veg" meal and easy cleanup!

THANK YOU! We are selling our home, so we have had people looking at it every night this week. I am so tired of feeding the kids fast food, I just couldn't take it anymore. I need a fast, easy recipe that I could do completly on the grill. This was WONDERFUL, and just what the doctor ordered! I sifted through the other reviews and combined their suggestions. I used Lipton onion and mushroom soup in with the meat, and then topped the kid's with shredded cheese, and mine and the hubby's with fresh tomatoes and cheese. DELISH! I'll be making this one again!

I love this recipe, and you can add your own ingredients based on things you like.  i add powdered ranch dressing mix or onion soup mix to my ground beef for a different flavor sometimes.  I also add onions, and fresh mushrooms sometimes.  Both my boys love the packets and it takes my husband back to his boy scout days.
Sometimes, I cook mine in the oven in my kitchen, on days when I don't feel like firing up the grill.

Sky is the limit with this convenent recipe.  I use it often for scout camps.  Don't forget, for camp fire foil packs: Shiny side in unless you use non stick foil which is the best thing man ever invented.

Use a lean hamburger.  I found it too greasy for me although my partner loved it.  He wants us to make it again.

These are great!  I only used about 1 pound of ground beef made some preference changes:  I combined burger with seasonings such as salt, pepper, garlic powder, worchestershire, etc. and made 5 hamburger patties.  I topped each burger with sliced carrots, onions, and potatoes and drizzled a bit of olive oil on top and sprinkled with parsley.  Instead of grilling, I baked these packets in foil on a cookie sheet in the oven for 1 hour.

I found this recipe when I needed to make dinner in a pinch and only had ground beef and potatoes.. I added Worcestershire sauce, plenty of parsley, and some parmesan cheese to my meat mixture.  I put a scoop of cream of chicken on each burger patty, and a teaspoon of butter on top of the onion. This made it stay very moist and made a fantastic gravy! I baked at 350 for 25 mins like another reviewer, and they weren't quite done so I turned it up to 375 for another 10 mins. Even my super picky husband loved it!

I was happy to find this here. I actually learned this from the girl scouts many years ago with my mom. Easy and tasty dish. I have done this while camping over an open fire an at home in the back yard. I add a little olive oil and a teaspoon of minced garlic, sets everything off with a different flavor. Butter helps to keep the food from sticking to the foil. I have even tried it with turkey, chicken, pork, and steaks.

This was great.  Fast, easy, and quick clean-up.  I did add more veggies (corn, green beans, mushrooms) because this is so versatile.  I will be making this over and over again.  Thanks.

I gave this recipe 4 stars because I was a bit grossed out by the greese at the bottom of the foil.  My ground beef was 97% lean but without anywhere for the bit of fat that is left to go, it ended up soaking my poatoes and carrots.  I uploaded a photo but cropped it so you won't see all of the greese.  (You can still see some) I listened to reviewers and seasoned my beef beforehand.  I used garlic powder, pepper, and season all. I layered my foil with the carrots and potatoes at the bottom (I was thinking it would help with flavoring) and then put the meat and onions on top.  I think I had the right idea if there wouldn't have been so much greese. I love how quick these were to 'whip up' and I will try them again but maybe in the oven with a broiler pan and I'll put a small slit in the foil so it can drain.

This recipe was a good starter for a new family recipe for us. I didn't care much for the hamburgers in this, I just didn't like the texture of it.. so instead I use 4oz pieces of beef steak. It takes a bit longer to cook depending on how well done you like your meat, but well worth the wait! And because its all individual it saves on having tons of leftovers that no one eats. Thank you for the recipe!

yum yum yum!! i've made many tasty foil pouch dinners in boy scouts but none come close to how delicious this recipe is! we put a slice of cheddar cheese on our ground round (sprinkling the pattie with a little garlic powder first), then followed the rest of the recipe as directed with the exception of adding about 1/2 T. in broken butter pieces to each pouch. the seasoned salt works well here. our carrots were still crisp after 30 minutes so we needed to grill the pouches for an additional 15 minutes. mmmmmmmmm, thank you michelle!

I also have been making a variation of this for years too. I mince the onions and mix them with the ground beef. I also add celery and green beans with the carrots, then douse it with BBQ sauce. About 1/4 cup per pattie.

This was great! So easy to prepare, little to no clean up and tons of flavor.  I added the olive oil to the packets before closing, salt, pepper and for 3 packets (I only used 1lb of beef) I sprinkled half a packet of top ramen flavoring to the beef and veggies.  I used carrots, potatoes, green bells and onion. Yumo!  I'll do this again for sure.  So easy and delicious.  Season the meat as you wish with whatver you like to use, remember the olive oil and play with the additional seasonings!  I may use cajun next time.  Thanks for the recipe.

Used a lean hamburger, and formed 2 meat loaf type shapes in my dutch oven.  Added the veggies to the top.  Found that the potatoes take the longest to cook so cut them a little smaller.  Add your favorite seasonings to the meat and sprinkle your veggies with the same herbs for added flavor. Great one dish meal and easy prep.

This is perfect on those hot summer nights when you dont want to run the oven inside, but want a nice complete hot meal!  Also if you would like to do it in the oven, set it for 350 deg. and bake for about 1hr.  I also put corn in my hobo dinner!

We had a great bbq yesterday and everybody loved this!!! I used to eat this when i was a child, but didn't realize how much i missed it till now. Added chopped garlic and onion, 1 teaspoon dried parsley and black pepper to our hamburgers. Rubbed the potatoes with salt, dried parsley and a pinch of paprika to give them a special touch of color. I also added a couple of small "chorizos" to each packet which made the potatoes turn even more reddish. Cooked packets in an outdoor grill for about 40 minutes (probably next time i will reduce the cooking time though, 'cause our potatoes got stuck to the foil). Goes great with cold beer!!!Delicious!!!

By the time the potatos were done the meat was a bit dry - next time I will make a bit fatter patties - so they will take a bit longer.  Yummy!

Very Good. My whole family loved it. Next time I'm going to try adding some butter, and maybe cream of mushroom soup. Was a little dry, but very good flavor.

This has been a family favorite for years. This was the first time I attemted to make it though. You have to add at least 2 Tb of butter or else it is dry. I also added A1 to the hamburger to give it a little more flavor. All in all this has always been one of my favorites!

I love this recipe!  We used to make this at a camp that I would go to when I was younger (Camp Peniel).  We'd have it on our "camp out" night (it was cooked over an open fire).  These bring back great memories.  They are even better if you add butter with the veggies and a piece of american sliced cheese to the top!  YUMMM!!!!!!!!!  This would be great for kids!!!!  Something that helps to keep everything in place...when you form the ground beef patty, make a ridge around the side (like strwaberry shortcake bread/ or a thick pie crust),  then it will hold the butter, veggies, and cheese a little better)

Pretty good, but be sure to add seasonings or it will turn out a little bland.  I might try it with some onion soup mix next time.

We made this with large 1/2 lb patties and made them in the oven, the cooking time was understandably much longer than the review I took advice from, about an hour and we upped it to 400 degrees. This was a delicious and easy supper for the busy Christmas season. The next morning, Christmas day I knew we wouldn't have time for lunch and asked my S.O. if he wanted the same thing for breakfast and he said "Yeah if you put an egg or two on it." While we were eating he said it was even better with egg and the next time we have it, (not if) we should include the egg. Thanks for this recipe, very good, neat and self contained satisfying meal. And we used McCormick steak seasoning, that's the thing for the people that thought it was bland, add the spice that you like.

Nice, inexpensive meal!  I took the advice of others and added a tad butter to each foil packet along with additional seasonings.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I used the recipe for the "Biggest Best Burger" from this website. I threw in the potatoes, carrots and onion with the burger. I thought the meal was good, but my husband didn't like it. He ended up putting his burger on a bun. :P

the reason why I'm giving this only 3 stars is because I added so much to this, that it really isn't the same recipe. I make my patties, like I would a burger, seasoning and all. I add potatoes and carrots and onions. I also, fry up some bacon with spinach. I place the meatball in the middle, surround the ball with veggies, add a pat of butter, cut up with veggies, and then top with bacon and spinach mixture. I bake in the oven, about an hour. when ready to serve to get rid of the pool of grease I take a fork and puncture the bottom of the foil packet and drain the grease. I hope you enjoy these I know we do. :)

Thanks for the recipe. I made this last night with round steak that i seasoned first, added garlic, lemon juice, & butter. It cooked itself on the grill while i relaxed in the pool. :)  It was delicious! This will be a frequent summer meal for us.

Pretty good, easy recipe.  I sprinkled the patties with garlic powder.  I used a can of cream of mushroom soup, put two tablespoons on top of each burger before sealing the packets.  Would have rated higher, but the kids weren't thrilled.

This was good and easy. I've substituted different vegetables and meat (even used lean pork chops)depending on what I have in the kitchen and it always comes out good. Also it is good baked in the oven.

This is a regular menu item while on camper trips.  A suggestion I would like to add is to microwave the whole potato until able to stick a fork in it.  Not necessarily until totally soft.  Then slice and add to the packet.  It will even out the cooking time of the potato and beef.

We like this for quick make aheads.  We use zucchini and green beans from garden as well as some tomatoes.  You can really put anything in these.  Greek seasoning, Italian.  Make it yours!  At our house it is an assembly line with all ingredients to make your own.

I have made this before, it's good. I made a change of my own, I use Sausage instead of gr. meat, and I put red, yellow & green bell peppers, onions, and potatoes sliced 1/4" thick inside my wraps. It takes about 15 minutes on the grill. Great food, short cooking time.
