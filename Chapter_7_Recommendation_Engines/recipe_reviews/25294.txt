Very yummy recipe - even my picky husband liked it!  I did make some changes, though.  I eliminated the butter and brown sugar altogether, and I mixed the stuffing ingredients in a separate bowl before adding them to the squash.  For extra savory flavor, I added a little bit of feta cheese.  I took the foil off about halfway through the baking.  I will definitely make this again!

We had this at my son's house and loved it. He added Jimmy Dean sausage, pecans, and sauted onions and celery. There was enough stuffing for four squash halves. Very delicious!

Outstanding recipe! I made my own stuffing using celery, onions, garlic powder, onion powder, sage, 1 can of chicken broth plus 1 cup of hot water, and sauted everything for about 20 minutes, then poured everything over a 7.5 ounce of bread cubes and mixed well.
I put about 2 heaping cups of stuffing in and on top of each squash half, after buttering and adding 2 tbs. dark brown sugar. I baked for 70 minutes at 400F foil covered, then 15 minutes at 400 uncovered Thanks for this recipe.

I added some chopped onion instead of the onion powder. I used Stove Top for the stuffing. I took the foil off for the last 5-10 min.  We liked it and will make it again! Thanks!

Ok, I admit, I cheated big time with this but the end result was so good anyway! We feel that acorn squash is pretty sweet on it's own so I skipped the brown sugar. Here's where the cheating part comes in. I simply cooked the two halves of squash in the microwave, made Stove Top stuffing, added in some browned sausage to make it more of a complete meal, stuffed the squash and  placed it in the oven for twenty minutes.  Delicious Weavre and thank you so much!

This was so easy that i let my 6 year old make them for dinner.  I got all the ingredients out for her and she followed the recipe to a T.  They had a great taste.  The only thing i would do differently is maybe poke some holes in the flesh with a toothpick the filling was very good but the way you pour it all in the sweetness only effected the very bottom of the squash.  I would also mix the stuffing and the chicken stock together before filling them, this way all the stuffing is made, some of the top was completely dry.

I will make this again!

We have been loving this recipe! We did bake it without the foil for the last half as we like a crunchy top. Will make again and again!

Yum! I haven't had acorn squash since childhood, and I didn't like it then! I thought I'd try it again - I left out the butter and brown sugar, since I didn't think they would pair well with the stuffing. Like others, I mixed the stuffing mix and other ingredients in a bowl prior to filling the squash halves. The squash was tender and perfect after 45 minutes. I'll make this again.

I made this tonight and it was a huge hit. I didn't have chicken broth so I used homeade vegeable broth. I also scored the squash as another reviewer suggested and rubbed the inside of the squash with a bit of brown sugar (my family has a sweet tooth). Also taking another reviewer's suggestions, I mised all the ingredients in a bowl (sugar and the butter that I melted) and then put it in the squash. I didn't have the garlic powder (we go through it a lot and I just happened to be out) and forgot about the onion powder. It was great without these things.  Thanks so much for this recipe. It will be used again and again. Oh and I was cooking a brisket and had to hold these in the oven for about 80 minutes and they were fall apart tender. Wouldn't change a thing.

Made this with brown rice instead of stuffing. The stuffing mix has way too much sodium for us. Next time I'll mix all the ingredients before I stuff the squash. I only needed to cook it for 40 minutes instead of 60.
I will be doing this again.

This nce was good, but I did the following to enhance this: Used a cornbread stuffing mix and had a few pices of dried white bread so added that.
Also added celery, onion, a chopped apple, about 3/4 lb of browned and crumbled breakfast sausage. Added the butter and 1 cup of the water the mix called for  on the stuffing package. Skipped the brown sugar. This was enough for 4 squash halves STUFFED FULL. Hubby and daughter loved it.

Very good. Doesn't say whether to add sugar and butter to the stuffing mix or not. So put butter in squash, then sugar, then stuffing mixed with broth, garlic powder and dehydrated minced onion.

Was pretty good. I tried cheating a bit and didn't quite get the squash cooked all the way. I just used stove top and cooked that. Added the butter, brown sugar and some raisins. This is my thanksgiving dinner since I do not eat meat. I would make it again.

absolutely wonderful.  even my husband loved it!  i jazzed it up a bit with chopped onions and celery (which did not soften much... but it gave it some crunch).  Could be a side or even a dessert.  I recommend this 100%!!!

Great receipe.  I added sauteed carrots, onion, celery, and cooked italian turkey sausage to the stuffing.  I used an ice cream scooper to hone out the inside of the squash.  I noticed a lot of raters did not include the butter and brown sugar beneath the stuffing mixture, but I did and it gave the squash an excellent flavor.  (I pierced the inside of the squash numerous times with a fork so the butter / brown sugar mixture could permeate the flesh.)  It took a little more than 2 hours for the squash to cook sufficiently, but it was definitely worth the wait.

I mixed the stuffing mix w/ chicken broth, frozen chopped spinach, mushrooms, and cooked & seasoned turkey sausage.  The squash was tasty, but needed to be cooked extra time in order to get the squash tender enough.  I will make this again, but will microwave the squash for a bit before stuffing them and putting them in the oven.

Soooo good!  And so easy!  I put half of the butter and brown sugar in the bottom of the squash halves, filled it with the stuffing mix, onion and garlic powder, and added a little cayenne.  Then I topped with the remaining half of the butter and brown sugar.  I baked it for 45 min covered and the last 15 min uncovered.  It got a little crisp on top and it was wonderful!  Thanks!

This is delicious! Like everyone else suggests, I mixed the ingredients first before stuffing the squash halves (I melted the butter first too.) One reviewer left out the brown sugar because she was worried that it wouldn't go with the savory seasoning in the stuffing mix...I don't know how it works, but the brown sugar makes it soooo good. As gross as it may sound, I was scraping the bowl of stuffing mix and licking the spatula after I filled the squash and put it in the oven. 

Instead of individually wrapping the squash halves in foil, I placed them in a shallow pie pan and covered the whole thing with foil. 

I liked the brown sugar flavor so much, I think next time I might sprinkle a little on top after baking and put them back under the broiler for a minute to get crunchy!

I sautéd celery and onions and mixed the stuffing before putting them in the oven. I only put a tiny bit of brown sugar in the bottom. I also unwrapped the foil 30 minutes in so the stuffing would be a little crunchy on top. Everyone loved them. Thank you for sharing this nummy recipe.

This was fantastic--my husband has always loved the classic squash w/ brown sugar and butter...but he went crazy over this!  I didn't have stuffing mix so I baked a few slices of bread for a few minutes to dry them out, then cut them up and added to that some chopped onion and chopped apple!  Then just combined with the chicken broth, brown sugar and butter.  It was delicious and so simple!

Just fixed this for supper tonight.  My daughter, who as I was fixing it, proclaimed "I don't like squash" wound up "eating" her words.  Now she wants me to make it a regular meal!

I wasn't sure what to rate this because I really didn't follow the recipe very well! I used homemade stuffing + added Italian sausage and really enjoyed it. I softened some celery and onion, mixed in some small bread cubes and chicken stock, along with the spices mentioned in the original recipe and the brown sugar and butter in the bottom of the squash. It was a great autumn meal.

Excellent!  My Both my husband and I liked this recipe.  My squash must have been smaller than those called for in the recipe, because I had much more stuffing than I could use.  Next time, I'll be sure to spread the brown sugar throughout the cavity of the squash.  And it helped to mix the broth and stuffing mix together before putting it in the squash.

I used Stove Top Stuffing for my stuffing. To the stuffing I added hot chicken sausage, fresh onion & celery. Instead of adding butter and sugar to the stuffing, I sprayed the squash with cooking spray and very lightly sprinkled a little brown sugar on the squash itself then filled it with the stuffing. Baked it for 45 minutes in the foil then an additional 20 so the stuffing had a chance to brown nicely. It was delicious!!!

This was sooo good.  I did make some changes.  I added chopped onions, mushrooms, and as I wanted this as a main course, a can of chicken.  I used stove top for the stuffing. I did have to cut up two squash as my acorn squash were very little.  I also put the butter and brown sugar in the squash, then mixed up the rest and then added that to the top.  (of course, since the squash were little I separated the butter and sugar by fours.)

I love this recipe, like other reviewers I omit the butter and brown sugar, but I do sprinkle some olive oil on top before putting it in the oven.  I also omit the salt as the stuffing is usually salty enough. Wonderful, I have made this several times.

Made this recipe on Thanksgiving and followed it exactly as written, except melted the butter and mixed all ingredients together and filled the squash halves.  Used three small squash (6 halves) and had the perfect amount of filling.  Lined them in a foil pan with a little water and covered the whole pan with foil as one reviewer suggested, and left the foil off for the last 15 minutes.  Easy recipe and nice presentation.  Would definitely make again!  Thank you.

This was exceptional. Savory and sweet all at the same time and still works well. The ingredients it calls for seemed to be a tad too much but maybe we had small acorn squash? Either way, I made it work and it was good. Filling too!

This was great!  I added a 1/2 lb of sausage to the stuffing.  I mixed the stuffing, chicken broth and seasonings all together and then stuffed the acorn shells. I topped the squash with Parmesan cheese the last 5 minutes of cooking.  I had enough stuffing to stuff 2 whole acorns.  It was very very good.

This was a neat idea. I used 3 squash. I put Savory herb stuffing in 1 1/2 c. beef broth instead of chicken as my main dish was beef. I used 1T. butter and 1T. brown sugar. I put them in a 9x13 casserole and covered the whole thing with foil. Thank you Weavre for a simple yet unusual recipe.

This recipe was absolutely delicious, and a wonderful way to do something different with squash! I gave it four stars instead of five because I do think the recipe needs a little altering.  I followed a lot of the suggestions from the reviews.  I prepared the stuffing ahead of time (used Stove Top's Savory Herbs mix) and also added about 2/3 of a tube of cooked and crumbled Jimmy Dean sausage to the stuffing.  That was more than enough for two whole squashes.  Next time I think I will melt down the butter and sugar ahead of time, too, and mix that with the stuffing.  All the butter and sugar just spilled out of the squash and couldn't be enjoyed with the rest of the dish.

There wasn't room in the oven, so we just microwaved it 20 minutes (pre-cooking the squash a few minutes first) and let it brown in the oven for 10! Super easy and everyone loved it.

Worth the effort!!  Precook squash in microwave, used 2 Tbs brown sugar, premix all stuffing ingredients (melt butter) -used chicken broth from cooked chicken.  Put extra stuffing around squash and covered entire pan with foil.  YUM!

I made this tonight for supper along with baked chicken. I did mix my dressing first and then added to the squash, butter and brown sugar. I did not add the garlic. Thanks for the recipe will make this again!

Loved this recipe. Used pecans, celery & onions to help out the stuffing. Would use less celery next time (it ended up having a very celery taste). Mixed the stuffing before putting it into the squash.

I usually change things up a little in order to make a recipe my own, but this one was kept just the way it was.  I have to say, it was Wonderful and very filling.  I served it along side pork chops but I believe any meat would be great.  Both my daughter and I gave it 5 stars!  I kept the foil tightly closed and it cooked through just right.***Made again and again wonderful made just as the recipe!

We loved this - I did microwave the squash for 4 - 5 mins. before filling it - then I threw  a bunch of seasonings into some cooked turkey burger to make it taste like sausage - sauteed some onion and garlic -  poured some of the br. sugar/butter over top everything before putting it in the oven. Will be delighted to make again!!

This is an awesome squash recipe. Usually I make soup or something else, but this was delicious! This was the entire meal, and filling as well as amazing!  I left out the onion powder and went light on the garlic powder. Enjoy!

Made as is written. Too much stuffing called for the acorn squash (enough for two squashes) so it was a bit of a waste, but other than that, the recipe was good.

I do not like any squash, baked, cooked, steamed. Fried is pretty good. This is the best squash I have ever eaten and on this site there is a Baked Squash II that I can not wait to try. If it is anything like the first, I'll be eating at least one of these at least once a week. THANK YOU!!!

Great texture, wonderful flavor, the recipe is somewhat hard to follow though. The amount of stuffing it makes is plenty for two acorn squash cut in half.

This dish is awesome! My boyfriend was skeptical at first and totally loved it! He used the leftovers to stuff a chicken breast and said that that turned out well too! We did what others have recommended and mixed the ingredients before stuffed the squash. Used green acorn squash for those of you out there who aren't sure what color to pick (green, orange, yellow).

Unbelievably good!  I first cut the squash and microwaved it for 6 minutes  at 100%.  Then I wiped the margarine and brown sugar inside the squash halves.  In a bowl, I mixed Savory Herb Stove Top stuffing, 1.5 cups of chicken broth and dried cranberries together and then stuffed it into the squash.  I packed the stuffing in and was able to fit almost all of it in.  Cooked it at 400 degrees for 30 minutes with foil and 15 minutes without foil.  Everyone loved it.

This is good, and I will make it again with some changes.  I will create a topping with onions, peppers and toasted bread and dressing seasonings.  
This was too much bread for me, but worth tweaking.

My family doesn’t like squash but everyone likes this. Like other reviewers, I sautéed. onion, celery and 1lb pork sausage. Mixed everything with stuffing and baked per allotted time. I also didn’t add the brown sugar and butter. This one is a fall keeper!

Technique is great!  Very best way to roast stuffed squash!  I had leftover sausage stuffing that was very dry.  So. I put in a pat of butter, then the stuffing, then chicken broth.  I added a topping of pizza sauce - yes, this was use-it-up!  Roasted as directed - opened the foil at 50 minutes; added more pizza sauce & parm cheese; roasted 10 more minutes.   Really fabulous!  Thanks so much!  My husband said it was great but he kept looking for the brown sugar - which, of course, I omitted.  We will enjoy over & over!

My acorn squash must have been tiny or something because I could only fit around 2/3 of the ingredients. I went light on the spices and found them a bit bland-so my suggestion for future first-time makers would be to go heavier on spices than you'd initially guess.

Will make again!

This was OUT OF THIS WORLD! My 10 and 7 year olds devoured it and we all agreed it was a favorite. I only made a few changes... I actually didn't have any celery, so I used half a can of cream of celery soup. I also don't care for mushrooms so I omitted them.  Like I said, we LOVED this recipe!!!!

Delicious!  I used a box of stuffing mix like others suggested and made it according to package directions, but also added sauteed onion, red and yellow bell peppers.  I drizzled a little honey in the center of the squash prior to filling it with the stuffing (because I was out of brown sugar).  I used 4 halves (2 whole squash), placed them in a large casserole dish, covered the pan with foil and baked for 60 min- had to add 15 more min as they were not done.  Then sprinkled chopped walnuts on top and broiled for 5 min to toast the tops.  A keeper- sooo yummy!

I wanted to try something different & it  turned out very well. Both my husband & I enjoyed it. I only added half the amount of brown sugar & also added ground hamburger.  Easy to make & very good. Will make it again in the future.

This is a great fall recipe, and can even be used as a casserole if you have a child or family member who doesn't "like" squash, and you need to hide  it .  .  . I use stovetop chicken flavored stuffing and skip all the seasoning to save on time. I also include 1/2 lb of ground italian sausage, thus requiring 1 more acorn squash for a total of 4 halves. Nothing else needs to be done or added. Between the stovetop and the italian sausage, all the flavoring you need is in the 5 ingredients used. I can prepare this in under 5 minutes (if you soak the bread crumbs in the chicken broth and then cut the acorn squash while the bread crumbs are soaking), allowing me the remaining time to nurse my baby before my husband gets home!

This was amazing!  The flavors were perfect!  My whole family enjoyed this.  I did make a few small changes though.  I added freshly minced garlic and ground pepper and sauteed with the celery and onions.  I added extra rice and veggies for more stuffing.  I did not have the white wine vinegar, so I used 1 TBS seasoned rice vinegar and 1 TBS white cooking wine.  I also added some feta cheese and shredded parm cheese to the warm sautee mix with arugula and rice and let sit in the pan for five minutes, then stirred, before stuffing squash.  Amazing flavors.  Will definitely make again!

I could only fit 1/4 cup of the dressing in the squash... I feel like even if my squash was a bit larger there still would not be enough room to put the ingredients listed in there.  Because 1/4 cup was overflowing I would not of been able to add the broth so I just cooked the dressing in a saucepan and added to the squash in the last 15 minutes of baking.  I though this was going be sweeter then it was.  My hubby and I liked this but the kids did not.  I probably won't make again.

Sounded like it would be good but 3/4 cup broth was way too much.  Stuffing was super soggy.  It would be better if you make the stuffing as directed and then add it to the squash without adding any broth.

With an average sized acorn squash, the amount of stuff suggested in this recipe simply doesn't fit. I had to halve the stuffing and broth, and I felt like it still had way too much liquid.

It was interesting!  It is just stuffing in an Acorn squash but I love getting a fork full of squash with my stuffing.  I was afraid to add the Brown Sugar so I only sprinkled a little bit in the bottom of the squash with a little bit of butter.  Like others, I made my own stuffing first using celery and onions with Pepperidge Farm dried stuffing mix.  I served Broccoli on the side.  See my pic!  :-)

Thankfully (and as always) I read the comments and followed many suggestions.  I sautéed garlic, onion, diced kale, and veggie sausage.  I mixed the box of stuffing with all the chicken broth then added the sautéed ingredients.  Instead of butter I drizzled EVOO on the squash and skipped the brown sugar.  I then added mixed ingredients to the acorn squash.  I did follow suit and take off the foil mid-way through baking and it tuned out perfectly.  Will DEF make again!

Husband and I liked it.  Daughters liked the stuffing, but they really don't like squash...  I took other reviewers suggestions and mixed all of the stuffing ingredients along with the (melted) butter and brown sugar together then divided it among the 4 squash halves.  I also added a pound of ground beef (seasoned like sausage...) and I did not have too much stuffing mix.  Perfect amount!  My girls requested I make this again, just omit the squash....

I think this was too salty. I used the cranberry stuffing from whole foods and followed that recipe, which calls for 6 tblsp of butter then I added butter to the squash. Way to salty.  Next time I'll omit so much butter. (My squashes weren't cut symmetric so I had to

Like most I added sausage.  I took out the brown sugar.  Otherwise, I kept the recipe as close as I could (less butter/stuffing/broth to make room for the sausage).  We LOVED it!  I'm not really fond of sweeter vegetables like acorn squash, but this adds an awesome savory spin.  Will definitely be making this again if I find another nice acorn squash at the farm stand.  Thank you!!

there is not nearly enough room in each half to put the amount of butter, dry surfing mix AND chicken broth.   then when you wrap it in foil it just steams so you end up with mushy bread in a soggy acorn squash...

I cut back on the brown sugar and this was a HUGE mistake.  Delicious but needed the sweetness with the savory for best results.  Will make this again with enough brown sugar!

This was very good! I used Stovetop stuffing and omitted the butter and brown sugar to save calories. A whole box of Stovetop filled 4 acorn squash halves. Next time I may jazz up the stuffing mix with copped onions and some kind of nuts next time.

Did what a couple other reviewers did and mixed up the stuffing prior to stuffing the squash, omitted the sugar (we like only slightly sweet) added some cooked sausage & uncovered for the last 20 of baking. I also topped mine with feta. Yum!

This was absolutely delish. I used the base of this recipe and made a few tweaks. I sauteed celery, onion and mushrooms (as i add to bread stuffing usually) and added them to the boxed stuffing before putting it into the squash. and rather than adding the broth to the squash first, I simple drizzled a few tablespoons over the stuffing before i wrapped them up. I had to cook mine for a bit longer too. I'll definitely be making this again!

Delicious and easy! Based upon other reviews I made a couple adjustments - added sausage and took the foil off at 30 minutes, so the top was crispy. Next time I'll add celery and maybe a little onion.

Delicious!  Great warm, Autumn comfort food.  I sauteed some celery and an onion and then added some diced apples and added that to the stuffing and it was delicious.  I also cut back on the butter (only used about 1 tablespoon) and it was fine!  I mixed the stuffing beforehand as well as many others mentioned.  Yummy!  Will make it again for sure.

Used leftover Thanksgiving dressing and added browned Italian sausage.  Wonderful topped with parmesan cheese and baked.

Very good! I added sausage and used cornbread stuffing with sauteed onions and celery.  I went light on the brown sugar and we ended up adding more as we ate because it was a nice balance to the savory sausage. Will absolutely make again, even for company!

This was a good change from the usual butter/brown sugar.  But it didn't "wow" me. It was filling, but lacked flavor.  It might work if you mess w/ the recipe a little, but I don't think I'll put in the effort on this one.

I loved this. It turned out very nice! 

I ended up cooking everything in one pot then transfering it to the squash.

I really enjoyed the recipe, but would probably reduce the amount of brown sugar slightly in the future.  I, like many reviewers, mixed everything together before stuffing the squash, and I also cooked covered with foil for half the cook time and then uncovered for a more crunchy top.  Delicious.

This was a great way to have squash.  We loved it, and it's so filling.  I mixed the brwon sugar and butter, etc. together before stuffing the squash.  It came out wonderful!  Thanks for the recipe.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.  I do have to admit that I used a Stove Top Stuffing mix in stead of plain bread crumbs, didn't use the sugar and put about half the butter.  I also mixed everything together before stuffing the squash.  What a great way to use acorn squash.

Made this for our weekly dinner w/ my former childhood piano teacher.  Super big hit.  We're all thinking of doing it for Thanksgiving!  Nice change of pace from sweet squash.

This was suprisingly really good.  I haven't had the best experience with Acorn Squash, but when I made this I ate it all!  I made my own stuffing which turned out just as well.

This squash was really tasty, but I overcooked it a little in the microwave.  I should have checked it while it was cooking, but I trusted the time given in the recipe.  It was still good, but it turned out a little more "tender" than I would have liked.
