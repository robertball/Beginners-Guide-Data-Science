Loved this recipe!  You converted my husband who has never liked croutons!  He said he is now a fan and asked me to make them again!
Since it was just the two of us, there was extra (and I only made half the recipe)...well, he ate the rest!  Thank you for an easy and delicious recipe!

Delicious! I just eyeballed all of the seasonings, to taste. I didn't have creole seasoning, so I just used cajun seasoning (not sure if it's the same or similar, but it worked great). Great flavor and buttery good~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)
