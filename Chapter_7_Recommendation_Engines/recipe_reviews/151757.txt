Just what I remember as a child!!!!  So yummy!!  I used wild strawberry jello.  It was so tangy and sweet.  My hubby and kids ate these fast. (okay,  me too!)    We will for sure be making these again.  We didn't add the nuts.  

*moisten your hands with water to make the balls.  They won't stick to you that way*

Easy, fun, and delicious!  My family loved them! We also left out the nuts due to an allergy.

Good stuff.  I used berry blue flavor. It was nice and tangy but not a best jello flavor to begin with lol. I used it cause i loved the thought of making blue popcorn.  For sure, the other flavors would be awsome. This is a sticky mess when making it, So oil up your hands or use water. I also used 2 bags of  94% fat free buttered flavor popcorn for the microwave. I liked the nice buttery flavor mixed with all the sugar goodness.

I hadn't made popcorn balls before, but they're my daughter's favorite, so I figured I'd better. These were quick and easy, and the kids love them. I left out the peanuts, too, because I'm not big on jell-o and nuts together. ;)

This recipe was very easy to make and came out excellent.  My only suggestion is to spray some Pam/oil on your hands to form the balls or you will have a very sticky frustrating mess.

I used cherry jello and added honey roasted peanuts in place of cocktail peanuts for my first batch.  Orange jello and honey roasted cashews for my second.  Lime jello and no nuts for the third.  All of these were a HUGE hit with family and friends.  i served the trio at a party with people of all ages and everyone seemed to love them.

These were really good. I popped my corn on the stove-top, so I would avoid the extra butter and calories.    We used lime jello, and it was a hit with the entire family.

Mmm Mmm Mmm...I had a friend that used to make these when I was a little girl and haven't been able to remember how we made them but this is it!  I 86'd the peanuts (not a fan) and then used Trader Joe's lite popcorn (1/2 the fat) and sugar in the raw instead of regular sugar.  I tried them with sugar free black cherry and they are delicious.  Thanks!

Just like when I was a kid.  I think I didn't pop enough corn because I had a lot of syrup left over.

These were wonderfully easy to make, and the kids loved the colors.  However, we found them far too sweet.

I could not get them to stick together for the life of me... I tried again and again and all I had to show for it was a greasy sticky mess on my hands...

Very easy to make.  Shaped into balls with hands (the cup method was just more work).  Kept a small bowl with water in it to keep hands moistened while shaping.  They were a bit softer than i like but still very good.  The kids loved them. As my 4 year old said "two fumbs up Mom"!!

This is the recipe I was looking for.   I also  left out the nuts and it tasted just like the good old days as a child.  I did use some of the new jello flavors like blue raspberry and decided that the old flavors like orange and strawberry still made the best flavored popcorn balls.
