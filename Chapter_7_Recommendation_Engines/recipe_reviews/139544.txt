I was looking for something to bake on Christmas that was a little fancier than my standard cinnamon rolls. This was perfect.

The dough is nice to work with and is very delicate and has fantastic flavor. The end result is very pretty- it's a shame we ate it before I thought to take a picture.

A couple tips:
Make sure to seal the seams very very well- it has a tendency to blow out.
I couldn't find almond paste so I ran some sliced almonds and some butter in the food processor until it was smooth. I don't know if that is very authentic but it tasted great!

If I could rate this a 4.5 I would for the following reasons:
1- The dough is very fattening with the heavy cream,
2- The cardamom makes this relatively expensive to make

Thank you very much for this recipe.  We had a bakery that baked these and I have been trying to figure out how to make them ever since it closed!
The directions were good but I don't think that the wiodth of the strip is meant to be 2".  I ended  up making it 6".  The dough was sticky so I put some flour on the waxed paper which helped.  The sugar coating helped to prevent it from sticking when I stretched the tube.  I think another time I would stretch it quite a lot farther to make a narrower Kringle.  We would put in less sugar and no almond extract and no cinnamon next time as well.
It is fussy, but it is very nice. Thanks again.

My family loves marzipan things, so I decided to try this last Christmas.  It was a huge hit, and now I'm back this year to make it again!  I wasn't able to find almond paste last year, so I made my own which was VERY time consuming.  So glad I found a can this year!  The nice thing about this recipe is the tube can be shaped into something other than a ring.  Last year I made a heart, not sure what I'll do this year, I may attempt a snowflake.  I did make mine wider, about 3-4".

This was a *fantastic* bread recipe!  The dough is soft and flavorful but the almond paste filling puts it over the top!  I made my own almond paste and rolled the dough out into two 12"x6" rectangles, which I then rolled up and formed into rings.  I left out the sliced almonds because my kids won't eat nuts they can see, and sprinkled the top with raw coarse sugar.  I will absolutely be making this again!

Great recipe. I had some marzipan that I wanted to use. I more or less followed the recipe; I replaced the heavy cream with milk. I added vanilla sugar instead of cardamom. 
I separated one egg, brushed the egg white on the dough before I put the filling on. It helps the roll to stay together. After I let the bread rise, I brushed the egg yolk on the top and added sliced almonds.

This is a delicious bread, but needs some clarification in the steps. 

First, the dough will not rise, at all, in the fridge. This worried me, but the bread rose beautifully once it was a loaf shape. 

Second, it's very important that your filling is spreadable, and not a powder. I used homemade almond paste, and my filling was more of a powder than a paste, which caused me problems. If I had it to do again I'd have added an egg white to make it stickier. 

Third, keep the dough refrigerated until right before you roll it out, otherwise it will get sticky and will tear easily. 

Fourth, when it's done baking it will still look a little doughy. I overcooked this because I thought it wasn't done, and the doughier parts turned out the most delicious later on. The texture is closer to a coffee cake than a loaf of bread. 

I had a hard time rolling out the shape to the full 40 inches before the outer layer got thin enough to start tearing, so at that point (probably about 30 inches) I just twisted it up into a loaf and let it rise. 

But in the end, this was absolutely delicious. Moist and very very rich, with beautiful flavors that complemented each other very well. Highly recommend, and I will try it again now that I know how.

This is delicious and fun to make! I was so excited to make this recipe. I  made my own almond paste (not as hard as it sounds). I also only used the almond paste as the filling, with sprinkling on some sliced almonds over the top of it, and a little bit of cinnamon and sugar (I did not combine the almond paste, 1/2 cup sugar and 1 tsp cinnamon and almond extract together). The marzipan/almond paste is plenty sweet and already has almond extract in it, so 1/2 cup sugar more is unnecessary (in my personal taste). I also wanted less of a cinnamon taste and more of an almond taste.

One thing that helped with forming the pretzel shape was watching a you tube video on kringle. There is a bakery that shows how to shape it. The width of the dough should be 6 inches, not 2, when you roll it out, with the filling taking up the very middle 2 inches. Then fold over each side on top of the filling, seal, and pat out any air bubbles. Then kind of stretch the roll as you lift it and then shape like the pretzel (I didn't actually roll the dough into a log to stretch it, or roll it in sugar at this point). After forming the pretzel shape, I used the egg wash and sprinkled the top with raw sugar and the sliced almonds. 

Beautiful and delicious! I will definitely be making this again. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This was a huge hit at my Christmas party and really reminded me a lot of Christmas when I lived in Germany. I really loved this product but it was a bit of a challenge to make. First of all finding almond paste was a challenge, it was in a can labeled as almond pastry filling. That stuff is crazy sticky and super sweet, so treat it accordingly. Do not under any circumstances add additional almond extract. That stuff is super potent. The dough seemed pretty straight forward and it was to make. Rolling it out was a challenge though. The other reviews that mentioned that it needs to be about 6" wide and 24" long. That took me nearly 30 minutes to roll it to that length. I recommend chilling your rolling pin to help. You do not need to flour the surface or dough though. Once you have the dough rolled out spread the filling and fold over the dough. Stretching and rolling it after it's filled was also challenging. I didn't get it to 40" but it was fine. Be careful doing this step as you can squish the filling out of the dough. I watched a couple of youtube videos on how to fold a kringle as I had no idea what shape it should be. That was very helpful and I recommend it. Don't be scared of this recipe it was amazing, but took some prep work. I am definitely making this again.

This was fun to make and delicious. I would second the reviewer that said to undercook a little. 25 minutes is perfect. I went to 30 and it came out a little dry. I sprinkled top with colored sugar instead of almonds. I'm going to experiment with different fillings because the dough is really good!

I loved the flavors and the pastry texture is lovely as is the filling. The only issue I had was that I could not get the it completely baked and had to end up cutting it up to bake it, but it could have been the pan I baked it on. However, I believe I have a solution and will try it next time. I am going to shape it into a wreath/ring shape and maybe cut and twist at the same time. I believe that should solve the issue that I had. But overall, it is a yummy recipe and my family said that it tasted like our Spritz cookies that we make during the holidays.

This is magically scrumptious stuff. I left out the cinnamon only because  I love almond so much I didn't want to do anything to distract from that flavor, but I'm sure this would be spectacular with cinnamon as well. 

I'm making the second batch this week as we speak.

Edited to add: I've made this now several times, with almond paste and, alternatively, with almond filling (when I couldn't get my hands on paste). I have to say, I loved both but preferred the krinkle made with almond filling in the end. Yum.

Read the other reviews before you make this. Mine turned out great but next time I won't overlap the dough to make the pretzel shape as it made that part too dense.

The pastry was delicious and a perfect treat to bring into my class for a European project. The only changes I did were to form the pastry in a circle vs. a pretzel shape to make it easier to evenly cut for my students. It was the same instructions, it just cooked faster (30 minutes). I also added extra almond paste to the filling because I am a lover of all things almond. It was a wonderful recipe!
