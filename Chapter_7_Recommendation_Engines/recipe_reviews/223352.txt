I was intrigued by this, and had to try it. LOVED it! I did not have the onion I thought I did - but had some shallots that needed to be used up. I also threw in a couple cloves of minced garlic. I did have trouble getting them to cook through - so I just spread them out thin. [I think that was me - it's been a long time since I've made pancakes!] Can't wait to make these again! OH! These made GREAT breakfast "sandwiches," with egg, turkey, grated cheese, and avocado!

Phenomenal! My 11 month old couldn't get enough of these delicious "pancakes." I was in a hurry so I didn't measure exactly...a little more zucchini, a little less cheese, no onion so I just threw in some garlic powder. I used 1 serving of "Biscuit Baking Mix" recipe from this site instead of 1 cup of Bisquick, subbing olive oil for the shortening. Next time I'll probably use sharper cheese, more garlic, or actually use the onion. Thanks, Tricia!

These were a huge hit at our house.  My 17 month old couldn't get enough.  Next time I would serve them with marinara sauce for the kids to dip.  I did freeze some for later use and they held up great.  Put in the microwave until warm and then toasted them for a bit to crisp them up.

Awesome recipe!  I've also spiced it up too...To mix the egg, I put the 2 in the blender with the onion, 2 garlic cloves and a tablespoon or so of hot portugal peppers, blended, then added to the mix. Also added salt & pepper.  Will definitely add more hot pepper next time, but it was great. Served them with sour cream mixed with garlic, salt & pepper.  Great side dip. Will definitely make these again.

Followed recipe except substituted some garlic for the onions (allergy).  I used the "Homemade Biscuit Mix" from this site and scaled it down to 5 servings to fit this recipe.  Shredding the zucchini in the food processor made quick work of it.  I found that on medium heat, my pancakes were very brown on the outside but not quite cooked on the inside so I turned down the heat and cooked them longer.  I might spread them out more next time to make them thinner and cook on medium heat.  They were very tasty with quite a delicate flavour however, next time I'm going to add salt, pepper and a few spices and see how they turn out.  Thanks, Tricia for a new way to use up my garden zucchini.

This recipe is surprisingly super tasty! The flavor reminds me of the Onion Bagels sold at Einsteins Bro. Bagels.  I was really skeptical, even with all the positive reviews that were posted! I made the recipe exactly as stated, and these turned out really well!  My 14-month old loved them, and I even turned them into a sandwich with lunch meat mesquite chicken and kraft singles in between two of the pancakes.  I bet they'd even be good as a McMuffin type-style, with sausage patties, eggs, and cheese in between two of the pancakes. Overall these were great and I'll make them again!

Made these as stated using last years frozen shredded zucchini. They were very tasty, though I would recommend other reviewers suggestions to spread them thin when cooking. I also think that fresh zucchini would make for a better texture. All the same they were delicious, we served them with home made tzatziki but could have just as easily enjoyed them plain! Thanks for a great recipe!

This is the first savory, not sweet, pancake recipe i have tried and it was fabulous. I couldn't stop eating them as i was making them!I made them to go with a chowder i was making and they were good dipped in the soup. Good way to use up zucchini.

I accidentally doubled the cheese and they were divine! My kids devoured them! I made a quadruple batch and froze some. We just reheat in the toaster and they taste great!

Made for dinner tonight. Used garlic powder and onion powder instead. Also made them on my waffle maker. Cooked thoroughly and didn't have to hover over it. Will make again, but looking for some type of sauce to use on top.

These were really delicious and simple to prepare. They only took about 12 minutes to make.  Garnishing them with sour cream and sriracha made them even more delicious! They really tied the flavors in the dish together.

These are terrific and so easy to make! My husband was willing to only try a bite at first, but then had four pancakes. I tried them with both sour cream and cream cheese and I can't decide which way was better, but they are also great alone. Will definitely make this again. I needed to use a zucchini or I'd end up throwing it out and this was perfect. I didn't have a fresh onion on hand so I substituted the half onion with just under 2 tbsp  onion flakes. Thanks for sharing.

These were great! We are not lovers of green veggies, but if I hadn't made them myself, I wouldn't have even known they were zucchini based. I enhanced them to suit our tastes with a tiny amount of shredded potato and more than one type of cheese, but they'd have probably been just as good without those minor changes.

These were delicious! I made two substitutions (whole grain baking mix for the Bisquick and 1 teaspoon of onion powder for the grated onion). To gild the lily further, we ate them with a dollop of plain greek yogurt on the side. I will definitely make these again.

Delish! (I used the 'Homemade Biscuit Mix' on this site)and added a little salt and pepper to the batter. Reminds me of the Corn Fritters mom used to make. In fact, you could easily sub corn for the zucchini. They fry up nice and crisp. Add a dollop of sour cream. Yum!

Love concept. Since I make everything from scratch, I did not have baking mix. I substituted 1 cup all purpose flour, 1 tsp baking soda, 1 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp salt. Did everything else as listed in recipe. Followed advice of some reviewers to add a kick and added 1/2 tsp Creole seasoning. Also used less than 1/4 cup per pancake and spread out thin. Will make again

This was so easy, the only thing I changed or should say added was, salt, pepper, garlic salt, chipotle  chill pepper and Worcestershire sauce.
They turned out excellent, will definitely makes these again.

Yummy.  My husband was less than thrilled to try zucchini pancakes.  He was very pleasantly surprised and said he'd eat them again.  Now, trust me, that's a compliment .

YUM! Followed exactly the first time... Family (33, 7, 4, 3) LOVED them, even my non-pancake eaters. Since I had to mix up a second batch, I added more garlic, more zucchini, some Mrs dash onion n herb seasoning and wow! As long as I have zucchini, these pancakes will be in our meal rotation!

After seeing this yesterday we had to try today. Fry hot so they're crispy. Gave this 4 only because it does need the recommended garlic. We used garlic powder & it wasn't enough so next time we'll use more garlic powder or a whole garlic minced. Tried plain & w/sour cream as others suggested. Hubby & I both feel eating them free of anything was the best. Next time we make these I'd like to try using half the bath of dough & add other herbs or spices to give it a lift or jolt also.

Ridiculously awesome. If I ever open a diner, this is the dish that’ll get em coming back for more. Top with some sausage gravy and a fried egg and you’re in breakfast paradise.

Such an amazing recipe! I grow zucchini every year and I’m always trying to find good recipes to use it all up and this certainly helps!  I used quite a sharp cheddar. I also don’t use pre-made biscuit mixes so I just used flour and added some salt, course pepper, and garlic powder. They came out great! I think next time I’ll make them smaller this made 6.

Followed the recipe exactly, spreading the batter thin on my electric griddle. Excellent & impressive. Just will need to remember to add salt & pepper to the batter next time.

Made these for breakfast for young teen granddaughters.  Left out the onion because I didn't think they'd liked them that way. One didn't finish hers, the other did but said it needed more cheese. (Next time I will use course shredded cheese). Brother LOVED them but did add butter to the tops. The jury is still out for me...next time I will make with the onion and course cheese...also, I add hot sauce to some dishes just to make them "sparkle", not to taste hot, and I did that here. I used silicone circles to keep the pancakes perfect. Stay tuned for next review...

This sounds like a strange recipe. However, I read all the comments and went for it.   It was very good. I served it with a little pizza sauce and just a bit more cheddar cheese on top. I used gluten free flour, added baking powder and oil instead of the baking mix. The zuchinni I used was a larger one so I ended up putting in an extra egg and little more olive oil to thin the batter.  I also added a pinch of salt and garlic powder. For the kids I would maybe put a little chopped up pepperoni on top too.

These were a great way to use up a zucchini. The kids made gross faces when I was making them, but ended up liking them and even asked for them for breakfast. Great for use as the bread for breakfast sandwiches the next morning with eggs and hot sauce. We ate them with sour cream and hot sauce for dinner. Husband ate 7 of them. I did add garlic to the recipe, but other than that, did not change anything. Great recipe.

I always follow these recipes as presented.  My kids loved them, or said they did.  I just doubled the recipe.  Each one came out better than the previous one. Be careful of the cheese sticking at times, or, use a non-stick pan!

This is delicious. I went a little heavy on the cheese which turned out fine. you don't need to drain the zucchini for this recipe. I used my own pancake batter without adding liquid and used the 2 eggs instead of my usual one. 
It made 14 5 inch pancakes so I froze some and reheated them today and they were great. I bet this would make a great appetizer if you made mini pancakes.

I thought it was excellent!  It could be a main dish for vegetarians (the eggs & cheese provide protein) but I opted to use it as a side dish with sauteed shrimp!

Ok, I'm giving myself a 1 star review for this. I put the zucchini in my Ninja. DO NOT DO THIS! It made the zucchini very wet (even after I drained it). Next time I will grate by hand. The flavor was delicious but it was just too wet to fry so I ended up baking it.

Delicious and so easy for a quick meal. I used Kodiak Cakes, power cakes. Love the taste and texture, plus they are packed with protein.

These were easy, my three boys loved them. The next time I make them, and I will, I might chop up the onion a little bit finer. I served them with sour cream and they were all immediately consumed. Very tasty.

I did not make any changes to the recipe and loved it.
I used Sriracha as a condiment.  Will definitely make again.

These are absolutely delicious !!!!!  I fried them in Ghee instead of using vegetable oil.  I served them with a dollop of sour cream with a side of tomatoes and cucumbers.  I will be making them again this week.  Thank You for the great recipe !

I wasn't impressed.  I made the recipe exactly as stated and didn't really care for it, nor did my 2 teenage sons.  The pancakes just didn't have much flavor.  We tried adding seasoning and sour cream afterwards and although it made them better it wasn't enough to warrant making them again.  Sorry guys, I just don't see where the 5 stars are coming from.

This is a great way to enjoy zucchini from our garden.  Topped with some salt, pepper, and sour cream they were a hit!  We’ll be making these again for sure.

Delicious!  I didn't have any Bisquick so I made my own (1 cup whole wheat flour, 1.5 tsp baking powder, 1/4 tsp salt and 1 Tablespoon unsalted butter, cut in), and I used green onions.  Crisped up beautifully on my cast iron griddle.  I served them with sour cream as they are more like a potato pancake than your traditional sweet pancake.  YUM!!!

This was so good! I didn't have the baking mix, so I added 1 cup of flour, pinch of salt and about 1 tbs baking powder and it turned out great. Definitely will make again to sneak some veggies into my son's diet :)

This was a delicious recipe. I used pancake mix and had to add a tablespoon or so of milk to make it more liquid, otherwise no changes. I like spicy so may add finely chopped jalapeños next time.

Great as is but I tried adding some real bacon bits and cayenne pepper flakes for a bit of a kick.  My family really liked the bacon bits ( probably added 2 tbls) and the cayenne was nice too (1/2 tsp or according to taste).

These are great. I don't use bake mis because it is very unhealthy, so I adapted with 1 cup of flour, 1 tsp of baking powder, 1/8 cup coconut oil, ans some salt. I squeezed out the water from the zucchini. My kid who doesn't like zucchini loved these.

Found this last summer when I had way too much zucchini coming out of my garden and wanted to do something different- love it! I've used it for breakfast, lunch and dinner- either as the main dish or a side. Even my 7 year olds like them. Also did them over the fire on a cast iron griddle and they came out great. Planning them for summer camp breakfast for next week too! They kind of remind me of potato pancakes- same type of texture.

Delicious! I used to make these a lot in my single days so they bring back a lot of memories. I also used the homemade biscuit mix from this site. I will definitely remember this recipe.  Thanks.

A big hit!  I added a 1/2 cup sweet corn, salt, pepper, and some paprika.  Served with hot sauce and sour cream - fabulous!  I made these for breakfast, but they would make a nice side dish too.

Awesomely delicious recipe!!! 5+ Stars rating if I could do more than 5 stars. Absolutely Delicious! Two changes I made for this recipe.  1) I shredded the Zucchini, (did not grate it) By shredding it, that added more of a crunchy delicious taste. 2) I did not cook the pancakes using vegetable oil (its bad for you anyways) I just used non-stick spray on the pan. If you follow what I did, it's absolutely delicious! You don't even need syrup, just a little butter. Enjoy! I'll be making these pancakes again, especially when the zucchini comes from my own garden.
