Super tasty! I cut all the ingredients by 3/4 so I could make a “single” serving. It would still please two people for sure! I was also impatient and put all the ingredients in my vitamix blender and put it on the heat setting. It was perfect! You could put it in any blender and blend on high for about two mins and then pop it in the microwave for about 1:15mins. If you do that, make sure you put it in an overly large mug because it will expand and you will have a huge mess in your microwave with a small mug. You will find a delightful froth on the top of you do the blend and microwave method. I’ve been doing that for years with regular cocoa powders and milk. (Note: milk substitutes such as almond milk will not froth at all.)
