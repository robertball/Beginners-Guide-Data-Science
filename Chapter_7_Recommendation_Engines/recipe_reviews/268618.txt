I used sugar wafers (and kept the cream inside) instead of cookie wafers so my crust was a little bit airy but this cheesecake was a huge hit at Thanksgiving! Everyone loved it! It is very decadent and delicious!

this recipe makes a delicious cake! The only problem is that the cake needs at least double the cook time.

It is very good but the ganache is too thick . Could use 1/2 the amount of ganache.
