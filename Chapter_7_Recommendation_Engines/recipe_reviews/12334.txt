Very good! I made this as one large strawberry tart - and used "pecan Nut Crust" from this site. I added some lemon juice and a nit of ginger to the strawberry sauce which gave the sauce wonderful flavoring! I placed the strawberry sauce and then slice strawberries on top of the crust right before serving to prevent the crust from getting soggy.

Very tasty. One piece of advice: Do NOT take these tarts to a picnic! The glaze gets runny very fast in warm weather.

The apple glaze was a little weird tasting, but otherwise than that this was an easy way to satisfy my sweet tooth.  I used frozen strawberries, which I heated in a saucepan for about 10 minutes on medium; took them out an sliced them, added corn starch to the liquid left in the pan, then added the strawberries again to let thicken. Yum.

I loved this recipe!  However, I found it difficult to find prepared tart shells, so I had to bake my own.  The glaze was incredible and the strawberries were the perfect compliment!

This was very good!  There was way too much glaze, and I ended up throwing a lot of it away.  Next time I will make 1/2 the amount of glaze.  Great flavor!

Totally the recipe I was looking for - not custard based, just pure strawberries & glaze.  This is an awesome recipe (although I will likely reduce the sugar slightly next time) :)

This is a simple, yet fantastic, dessert to make. I didn't have apple juice so used mango juice in place and it turned out very yummy.

Used the mini-graham cracker crusts, couldn't find small pastry crusts.  Very easy to make.  Tasted good, but wasn't anything incredible.  The apple-juice glaze was yummy, but since it was clear it looked a little strange when it set-up.

This is an easy recipe and a nice light dessert anytime of the year......to make it have a bit more eye appeal...I added a couple of drops of red food coloring to the glaze.....with just the juice it is rather bland looking. Also tried this recipe using keebler graham cracker 8" crust...came out delicious. ...good presentation.

I used pie crust to make my tart shells and I didn't have apple juice, so substituted with orange juice and they are AWESOME!   :)  I also didn't have fresh berries, so using frozen was a bit tricky!!  Next time I will let them defrost in my colander over a bowl and use a bit of their juice in the glaze too!   This is my first stab at tarts and this recipe was great to use.  I will make my own lil modifications next time around!   Thanks for this!

I've used this recipe twice now. Each time my family has gobbled it up. I like others could not find the ready made tart crusts. I just used the ready made pie crust and made one big strawberry pie.  The second time I mixed blueberries with the strawberries. Thanks for the delicious, light recipe.
