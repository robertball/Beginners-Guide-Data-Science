4.26.16   All I had was peach salsa in the fridge, so I did add a little Sriracha to get the "spicy" element and counterbalance the sweetness of the salsa.  I served with noodles as a side dish, and it would have been nice to have had some extra sauce.   I'd  recommend doubling the sauce, depending on what you're serving with this.  The success of this recipe is to not overcook the pork.  It was so tender, and the sauce was a perfect complement to it.  Very, very nice,  and pretty healthy, too!  Rachel True, thanks for sharing your recipe, we enjoyed it! ***UPDATE 5.28.18  Don't understand why this recipe hasn't had more activity.  Salsa and raspberry preserves may sound a bit strange, but they totally work!  Try adding a few red pepper flakes for a little kick.  Enjoyed last night with some roasted golden beets, and a dill cucumber salad.  Quick and easy, tasty, healthy, and just good!

We really enjoyed this. I am glad I read another review and used the suggestion of adding a dash of sriracha. Served it with a side of carrots simmered in brown sugar, OJ and ginger, complimented it nicely.

Just didn't care for the flavor of it.  Neither did my son.  We decided it was "okay", but definitely would not make it again.
