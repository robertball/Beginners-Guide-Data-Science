This absolutely makes black coffee taste better. But I decided to research and found out that a teaspoon or more a day of cinnamon(cassia types) can cause liver damage. They have high coumarin levels. Ceylon cinnamon has the lowest. I am going to find that to use in this recipe.

I kept seeing this recipe come up, so I decided to make it....using my keurig coffee maker. I first tried to stuff the cinnamon down the little hole of the k-cup. Some went in, but first thing of a morning, I wasn't going to make that great of an effort. So I put the rest of the cinnamon in a tea strainer, knowing most of it would go right through. It did. So I used some kind of mesh fabric I had to strain the cinnamon out. Finally, time for the taste test. I had read that the submitter said it was the only way she would drink black coffee. Hmmm. I hate black coffee but decided to give it a try. Crazy! But it IS really good black, no cream at all. I think I have discovered my flavored coffee of preference this fall!

I'm not familiar with Whole30, but a friend told me how to make cinnamon coffee just like this over 15 years ago. It's so good. I make it in my coffee maker. Just make sure you fully mix the cinnamon into the grounds before adding to the filter. The filter does back up a bit with water, so I wouldn't make a full pot of coffee and add the whole amount of cinnamon. As the submitter notes in the description, just put a few more shakes of cinnamon for each extra cup. This is also good with other spices, like pumpkin pie spice or cardamom.

Great substitute for light milk.  Tastes fine and doesn't seem nearly as acidic, although that may be perception.

It's true!! I love coffee and I prefer strong coffee but I started using creamer a few years ago and it became a necessity. I just made this recipe but I had trouble straining it (because I got impatient) so I made it in my coffee maker. I measured out the water so that I followed the recipe measurements exactly. Even though I only made 4 cups according to the recipe, the water filled almost to the 8 cups mark on my coffee pot. Il

Your morning needs this coffee. And I don't even like cinnamon! It's not overpowering; just subtle flavor that boosts the coffee leaving a nice aftertaste. What a treat! Thank you for the recipe.

Oh my goodness! So simple and delicious that I'm thinking about making MORE at 7:00PM even thought I just made some after dinner! I'm a black coffee drinker but I also love cinnamon so I had to make this. I added the cinnamon to our coffee grinder as I ground the beans to make sure it was well mixed and brewed the coffee in a Chemex. I may never buy any fall flavored coffee beans again, all you need is a teaspoon of cinnamon.
