For all of us that have to mess with it..... DON'T!!! It took all of my will power to not add a little of this or that. Namely garlic. This is hands down phenomenal made just as directed. Greek Hubs said I was granted a lifetime visa to Athens for this dish. Do go ahead and make a huge batch! It's even more delightful the next day

I loved this recipe—my husband no-so-much but he’s not a big feta fan. Tomatoes at this time of the year are tasteless so I used canned purée and it worked perfectly.  I made the full recipe, my husband ate it the first night and I devoured the rest of it over the next few days.  If you threw in some white beans or chopped chicken, you have dinner in one dish.

WOWZA....this was sooooooo good!  

When I am trying out a dish for this first time, I try to follow the ingredients and instructions verbatim.  However, I actually made a mistake and cut EGGPLANT instead of zucchini.  (Don't ask....giggle!!!!)  Anyway, as I didn't have anything else immediately planned for the eggplant, I decided to include it in my ingredients.  I used less zucchini as a result and crossed my fingers that the eggplant would not adversely affect the end result.  OH MY GOSH....it was sooooooooooo good!  I plan to always include the eggplant along with the zucchini.  

This is truly a very satisfying dish and my husband LOVED it!  Main dish or as a side....this is a recipe to keep handy!!!

I CUT THE RECIPE IN HALF AND IT BARELY FIT INTO A 9X13 DISH! DELICIOUS!!! ???
I used 2 large zucchini, 2 large red onions, and 3 medium large potatoes, 1 can 14.5 oz tomato puree, a hand full of chopped parsley, salt, pepper, and still the 1/2 cup of olive oil. I mixed it all by hand in a large bowl then transferred to my 9x13 baking dish. I cooked at 400 degrees for 1 hour 15 minutes uncovered then I added 8 oz crumbled feta to to and cooked it 10 more minutes. This was HEAVEN ON EARTH!!! 
YOU MUST MAKE THIS DISH!
Like you I was reading the comments like, "Wow, people really like this dish. Weird."
I can now attest to its simplicity and utterly amazing flavor! 
This will be a staple in our home for years to come! Thank you for this recipe.

I made 1/2 of this recipe because I wasn't sure my family would eat this. My husband eats very few vegetables, but this recipe he actually had 2 helpings.  He NEVER eats 2 helpings of vegetables.  My 3 year old grandson also ate the veggies.  I added yellow squash to the dish. I only had canned tomatoes on hand. So I drained the tomatoes and blended them in the blender. I used the whole can. However, next time, I will only use 1/2 can or try to buy the tomatoes recommended in the recipe. A simple dish, but oh so tasty.

This is fantastic just as is. If like me, you are fed up with finding 5 star recipes that are rated as such by people who add this, change that, or sub things out and didn't actually MAKE THE RECIPE, this one is spot on. Don't need to change anything.

To make the prep easy do the following:

Slice potatoes, zucchini and onions and put in a 2.5 gallon zip lock bag.  Then add a 28 oz can plum tomatoes, 1/2 c olive oil and salt and pepper to bag. Zip up and squish tomatoes with your hands and then turn bag several times to mix everything up. Pour contents into 2- 9x13 pans or I used a 15x10 pan.  Bake as directed.

This was delicious. I halved the recipe and sprinkled with some crumbled feta for the last 10 minutes in the oven (per the suggestion of another reviewer). The box grater idea for the tomatoes was genius. I will definitely make this again (and again, and again, and again). Thank you for sharing!

Hubby and I loved it.  Used large can of puréed tomatoes instead of fresh ones.  Will cut recipe in half next time but had leftovers with kielbasa in it the next night.  Definitely a repeat.  Using a mandoline made veggie slicing quick and easy.

Delicious!  will make again.  I did make a few changes - only one onion just due to personal taste - and felt like that was plenty.  I put the tomatoes and some garlic cloves in the food processor rather than grate them.  About 10 minutes before the dish was done cooking I sprinkled feta cheese over the top and then finished baking.  Just little tweaks to a lovely, simple and tasty recipe!

Yummy! I followed the recipe exactly with one exception. I used 1 TBSP of dried parsley instead of fresh (that is what I had in the kitchen). My whole family loved it! The hardest part was waiting the 1 1/2 hours for it to cook, but it is worth the wait. I followed the directions under "cook's notes" for the tomatoes and I am glad I did.  Thank you for sharing such a delicious  recipe. I will be making this again and again.

This supper easy recipe will now become a staple in our house. The only change I made was I used canned whole tomatoes (28oz) and followed one recommendation of putting everything in a zip lock bag, smosh it around to break up the tomatoes,  dump it all in a big pan, bake as per instructions and viola you have a great tasting Briam that reheats wonderfully.  Thank you Diana

Okay, don't ask me to puree 6 tomatoes and add to a 9x13 pan unless the recipe actually works with those amounts and dimensions. Really disappointed; I ended up pouring large amounts of liquids down the drain and increasing the cooking time. 
A well crafted recipe does better.

So good!  I used a combination of canned purée and fresh tomatoes to equal 3 cups. I make a similar dish that uses bell peppers instead of zucchini and basil and balsamic instead of parsley. Roasted vegetables are the best!

I will definitely make this again, and I heeded the advice of others who said, "It's perfect AS IS!"  I used two 9x13 pans, but when I pulled it out after 60 minutes to stir, I was able to combine the 2 pans into one because it had shrunk enough.  Everything seemed cooked (even charred in places), but I read the Cooks Notes that said the full 90 minutes was needed to bring out the flavors.  I felt it was getting a bit dry, so I covered it for the next 15 minutes and then I had to leave.  I turned the oven off and left it in there while I went to the movies.  When I returned 2 hours later, it was perfect and still warmish.  I added crumbled feta and served as a meal.  Next time, I will add a couple more tomatoes.  I probably had too many vegetables.  I used 2.5 lbs of potatoes and they sucked up the juices.  Thank you for giving us this recipe, Diana.  It's truly fantastic!

Recipe was cut in half and I followed everything as written but I did add feta to the top during the last 10 minutes of baking . It fits nicely in a 9 x 13 casserole dish. I would definitely make it again.

It was a big hit with everyone! It took a little longer for the potatoes to cook and I read in another recipe that they can be put in the oven first with some olive oil and covered with foil for about 30 minutes and then take out everything and layer it so I will try that next time. 

Other than that I just added some fresh oregano and a couple cloves of grated garlic and it was simple and delicious!

I loved this. It's simple to make and very flavorful. The recipe makes a huge amount - 2 casserole dishes - which I thought was crazy when I was cooking it. But we ended up eating all of it! I did cut down a little on the onions due to personal preference. I agree with the poster and others that the long baking time really does give it a nice flavor. This will be my next disk to take to a pot luck!

Loved it! Start to finish it took about two hours, so not super fast but prep was easy and hardly anything to wash was a bonus. I used a mandolin for "super fine slices" and everything cooked perfectly. The only thing I changed was to add a can of drained chickpeas in the last 30 minutes and two pints of fresh grape tomatoes blitzed in the food processor. For some reason I thought it needed to be covered for the first hour, so it had more liquid than it was intended, but the extra sauce was fantastic on bread. My veggies were unusually large, so I used the baking dish as a guide, filling it as I sliced to ensure everything would fit, than tossed the ingredients in a larger bowl; I found many of my slices stuck together in the pan so the bowl worked better for me. The oil did seem excessive but divided out by 4 or 5 servings, it's not bad at all. Will definitely make again!

Yup, amazing.  My proportions might have been a bit off, since I increased massively to feed 21 people at my Passover seder, but I followed the advice not to mess with it (I did sub canned crushed tomatoes), which was spot on.  Everyone at my table loved this dish.

I quartered the recipe but otherwise followed it precisely.  The result still nearly filled a 9x12 baking dish.   After baking, the contents settled quite a bit and yielded a very nice light meal for two that was just right with a little bread and wine.  It would also make a great side dish hot or cold.

Like many users I substituted canned puree for fresh and I think that was a mistake. If I make this again, I will try using crushed tomatoes which have a lighter, fresher flavor. I think that canned puree is too strong for this dish and overpowers a lot of the other flavors.

Swapped white pepper for black and canned stewed tomatoes for fresh. It was really satisfying and flavorful. It makes no sense as to why there is a little kick to the taste, considering the ingredients, but there it is. Really good.

EXCELLENT!  My wife, who is originally from Albania, says this was just like something her mother used to make back home.  There is no higher praise from her.

It needed a lot more seasoning but it was good. I used 1 1/2 tablespoons of salt, 2 1/2 teaspoons of black pepper, 2 teaspoons of parsley, and 1 1/2 garlic powder.

We liked this very much.  I followed the recipe exactly, except for substituting 28 ounces of canned, diced tomatoes for the fresh.  Using a mandolin for slicing made for a quick preparation.  Next time I will use more salt and pepper in the prep.  I actually liked it better the next day.

My new favorite side!!! I made a mini version of this and ended up finishing the whole thing myself as a meal. Gonna have to just wrap up my stuffed peppers! ???? I agree with the person who said make it AS IS. It honestly doesn't need anything, and anything more would have ruined it. Make sure to salt LIBERALLY. It definitely benefits from salt. This is going to be on the menu for Tuesday for the special dinner I'm making for my parents, and I can't wait to see what they say!

Definitely make sure there’s not too much water/juice in the pan when you begin cooking. Exceedingly delicious, makes two huge pans worth so if you’re cooking for one or two I’d halve the recipe. I will definitely be making this again.

So easy to make and delicious.  I added a teaspoon of salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. I also used a can of whole Italian tomatoes that I crushed since I didn't have fresh, but I didn't use the juice in the can. I have made this twice and I will make it again.

DELICIOUS!  I used a 30 oz. can of diced tomatoes (pureed in the blender) and I added a little fresh rosemary.   Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  The rosemary was great, but I think it also would have been great without it.  I'll be saving this recipe for later in the summer, when I'm overrun with tomatoes and zucchini!

Delicious. Be sure to take it out right at an hour and a half or it will start burning to the dish. Thinking it needed a little more time to evaporate more, I left mine in the oven for an extra 10 minutes and it really didn't need it. I used 3 fresh tomatoes and a large can of puréed which worked perfectly. Will definitely make again!

I ran out potato recipes so I gave this one a try. I loved it! I followed the recipe in detail, didn't change anything. However I didn't have enough fresh tomatoes so added one can of diced tomato without the liquid and it was good. Next time I will make sure I use fresh ones only. Thanks for the recipe, definitely making it again.

Made as written except halved the recipe which fit perfectly in a 9x12 baking dish. Better than I expected but would have been even better if my tomatoes were more flavorful. I think this is key. Will try Roma tomatoes next time. Served with baked Chicken legs to make a complete meal. Feta was OK but not necessary in my opinion, personal preference I guess. And BTW be prepared to use some elbow grease when cleaning your baking dish. Made lots of stuck-on black char that was impossible to get off without an overnight soak, yikes!  Might try spraying the dish with some non-stick olive oil next time. Thanks for a nice recipe.

This was a "what can I make with what's in the frig?" night, and I was excited to find this recipe for potatoes and zucchini.  I made it according to the recipe except I didn't have tomatoes .  I used 2 cans of fire roasted tomatoes- undrained and not pureed.  How easy to throw everything together!.  The kitchen smelled amazing and my husband loved it.  This could probably be tweaked in multiple ways, but try it as is first!

Absolutely delicious! This is going to be a staple in our house! Tried with and without the feta... didn’t need it. (And I LOVE feta) I did do it in my large Dutch oven so as to have plenty of room.

Received great reviews on your site  and having made it last night for my family received even more!   Really a simple recipe to make but oh so tasty. Paired it with the fried eggplant recipe from your site and it was a big hit. Definitely putting it on my favorites list for when I’m looking for. Vegetarian dishes!  This was the main course but could be a great side dish for a large group. Thank you for including this deliciousness in your selections of recipes

It seemed too simple to taste that good but it does!  I followed the recipe then we added a little feta on top of our servings - what a great way to top it off.  Will definitely make this again.

We all liked it! I would definitely make it again as a healthy choice.  I did not, however, purée the tomatoes.  I used a 28 oz can of unsalted crushed plum tomatoes.  Next time, I might try to parboil the potatoes first to cut down on the 90 minute baking time.

Amazing - I did want this as a full meal so the only change I made was. I halved the recipe - In a bowl added One piece of chicken breast sliced and sprinkled with Lawrys Mediterranean Season All - covered with Olive oil and one diced tomato.  Let it marinate and add to the veggies at the 60 minute mark and stir in.  Added Feta Cheese on half and Parmesan on the other half with 10 minutes left.  Next time I’ll do 2 pieces of chicken.  Super Yummy.

I’m amazed at how good this tasted with so few ingredients and no extra spices other than salt, pepper, and onion.  I found this recipe after reading that cucumbers were a good substitute for zucchini and needed to use some cukes.

Used fresh Roma tomatoes from the garden; also added Garlic and grated Parm on top for last 15 minutes.  It was great.  Will consider adding Eggplant next time too.

I made a half recipe. I grated the tomatoes as suggested and it worked out very well. The dish was extremely tasty. It's a great combo of carb side and vegi side so didn't need anything else but protein for a complete meal.

I was a bit suspicious of the amount of time needed in the oven so I used parchment paper to make sure the whole thing does not get stuck to the dish. I also added some paprika and oregano in the mix just because they are personal favorites. And everything turned out delicious.

This good not great. I put it all in the same 9x13 baking dish. That was a mistake. Too much in one dish and  it wouldn’t bake completely. It took two hours and the potatoes were still not done. Otherwise recipe was done exactly. My husband loved it.

I followed the others who commented on needing salt. I doubled the salt then added some more. I added some okra, it was in the garden. I also added garbanzo beans for some protein.  All the vegetables cut up filled a very large mixing bowl. I added some garlic and dried Basil.  Was still missing something. I added the full amount of olive oil and Feta Cheese.  Then it was really good.

Quick-boiled tomatoes followed by ice bath to remove skin then chopped by hand and pureed in blender. Did not add water at any point during baking. Olive oil is my favorite so I used a little more than 1/2 cup. The whole house smelled fantastic as it baked. The taste is perfect with a little feta.

Delicious and satisfying. Made it just as directed for family and friends and everyone loved it. My only minor adjustment was to mix fresh parsley., basil and oregano for the herbs. The tomato grating method produced good results but was time consuming and a little messy. Next time I’ll blanch and peel the fresh tomatoes instead. Great recipe!

Delicious! My husband and I did modify it though; used two zucchini instead of 4 and replaced it with a medium size eggplant. Added homemade chicken broth and cooked seasoned ground turkey before baking. Threw on some fresh feta on top before serving and it was super delicious.

Absolutely amazing flavor!! Very expensive if you buy tomatoes from the store, but if you have a tomato or zucchini garden this should be a staple at your household! I used thyme instead of parsley and it was delicious.

Quite tasty, but no surprise. How can you go wrong with the potatoes and zukes slow cooked along with onions and tomatoes? Since I had no tomatoes to use for the puree,  I just used tomato sauce with a  bit of additional tomato paste,  combining them in a bowl with the oil and spices for an even distribution on the prepared veggies. 
I did not remove the potato skins though. I love them! and because the potatoes were  thinly sliced, it did not take away from the overall appearance or taste.

Made a half recipe in a 9x13 with room to stir after an hour.  Only changes were using 13 oz of crushed tomatoes instead of fresh and adding crumbled feta cheese at the end like others have mentioned.  I wouldn’t say it was to die for, but it was a very good dish to add to the rotation.  I would definitely make it again as it was very easy using a mandolin to slice.

Followed recipe as written in regards to seasonings.  I used puréed canned tomatoes as that is what I had and I did sprinkle feta on top.  It was delicious!  This will a definitely go into my rotation as a main dish meal!

Seriously, this is absolutely delicious! I went against my instincts and only seasoned with salt, pepper, and dried parsley, and I’m glad I did. The dish doesn’t need any other seasoning, and I think even adding garlic would alter the simplicity of the flavor profile. I also threw a bag of frozen Qourn chicken chunks in there to make it a complete meal. This is so good. (Be generous with the salt, I added a bit more after one hour in the oven)

I made this exactly as written. It makes a lot so I ended up splitting the mixture between two  9 x 13 pans. 
It’s a  tasty and easy way to up your veggie intake. I make it on a weekly basis when I’m doing a Whole 30 as it’s great in the morning with an egg and/or whatever meat you may have on hand.

I was skeptical about this being good based on how simple the ingredients were, and the lack of seasonings other than s&p,  but I always like to try a recipe "as is", so I went ahead, using two 9x13" pans.  It was sooo good!  It makes a ton, so I don't know why it claims to only make 4 servings!  However I will enjoy having the leftovers.  If I want to make it again as a side for my family of four I'll halve it (and still have leftovers).

I cut the potatoes thinner than the zucchini slices since potatoes take longer to cook.  I used red shallots & fresh Roma tomatoes, it was very good.

We used a can of stewed tomatoes instead of fresh tomatoes, and blended it into a liquid. My wife was skeptical of this dish, but was impressed. We added some Parmesan cheese upon serving each portion. The portion size really makes this more of a side dish. This is definitely a keeper...
This must be a more authentic Greek dish , because when we traveled to Greece, we never saw that item.

This was really good, but I was worried about adding too much salt so I ended up needing a little more flavor in the end. I added some grated Parmesan when plating and it was delicious!

I will definitely make this dish again!  I didnt puree my tomatoes, though.  I used a can of tomato puree and a can of Mild Rotel Diced Tomatoes w/Chiles, which gave it just a slight bit of heat.  It was Delicious!

We really liked the crispy potatoes here. Scaled it for the two of us - 2 med red potatoes, 2 smaller zucchinis, less tomato. I used green onions, since I don't care for "regular" onions. And threw in a few 1" chunks of red pepper. Timing is just right for this dish. Thanks for posting.

This was a good side dish for a vegetarian brunch. It was easy to prepare, but does take awhile. Get it in the oven before preparing the rest of the meal. Excellent flavor!

I have made this recipe 3 times and great each time. I followed the recipe but not the proportions-depending on what l have on hand.  This third time, l sliced the tomatoes (roma) instead of pureed and it was still delicious. I think the key to this recipe is the cooking time. I was tempted to add garlic the third and glad l didn't,  it just doesn't need it.  I usually make a big pan over the weekend and portion it out for my lunch. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I made this for company when my husband was out of town.. it was so good!! I'm making it again today for his birthday, since he missed it the first time.. definitely birthday dinner worthy :-D I followed the advice of grating the tomatoes the first time I made it and it worked really well. Added feta the last several minutes of baking. Today I'm using a can of crushed tomatoes and just a couple fresh ones, as I wasn't really thrilled with the selection or ripeness of the tomatoes right now.. I'm betting it turns out just as good. This is seriously an amazing recipe!!

Used 6 medium-large russet potatoes, 2 large zucchini, 2 sweet onions (what I have on-hand), a can of white beans (drained and rinsed), 2 14.5oz cans of petite diced tomatoes (including juices).  I did stir mine 1/2 way through the cook time.  I cooked it for 2 hours to have all the juices evaporate. The top was blackened, but it turned out incredible with crispy potatoes. My whole family loved it including 3 meat-eaters. Served it with rice and corn bread.

This was fantastic! The only thing I changed was I added eggplant. I think next time I may add thyme and dill just because. To make this a complete meal, ground veal or beef would be good also. Definitely a keeper!

This is a flavorful recipe for such simple ingredients. Probably would have taken it out of the oven at the hour mark, will cook for less time next time and slice the zucchini’s thicker so they don’t get so mushy at the end. It was sooo good with the feta on top! My bf was impressed with the flavor of the recipe too.

Hand squished the tomato’s in between alternating zucchini and potato layers. I baked it with the tomato and potato skins, but not zucchini skins (they’re too tough). Grated some cheese on top (bellavitano), and this dish came out like the most delightful lasagna-like vegetarian vegetable meal I could imagine. If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would. Best main dish from this site I’ve ever made. Also, I did add some dried parsley in addition to salt and pepper as well.

Modified the recipe a bit Came out amazing,wish I would have made more! I used 2 large potatoes, 2 larger zucchini, 1 yellow squash and 1 red onion. I used 1 can (10.75 oz)of puréed tomatoes ( sheer laziness not gonna lie lol) and kept the 1/2 cup olive oil. Baked for an hour and then an extra 15 minutes instead of 30.  perfection! Husband loved it too!

Absolutely delicious!  I did add some minced garlic, and tweaked it with chunks of sweet Italian sausage, previously cooked in beer, then seared. Tossed sausage into the mix the last 20 minutes of roasting.  Totally love this recipe!

So this my first time writing a review on this site. I confess I messed up recipe but I have some  suggestions. I confused two recipes  and by the time I realized this the prep was on it’s way. So that being said thiere is a forgiveness and flexibility in this recipe . Zuchinni, potatoes , red pepper diced, red onion slices, garlic and a can of spicy diced tomatoes  were combined with olive oil, salt, pepper, oregano and parsley. Bake and serve with Feta sprinkle. Very nice

I made this recipe exactly as directed and divided it between 2  baking dishes.  To the second dish I added 1/2 a teaspoon of granulated garlic.  Then I cooked and cooled them as directed.  They turned out very good, but not 5 stars great.  I did like the dish with the garlic in it much better.  With a mandoline this was a pretty easy dish to prepare and I will make it again.

I always like finding new ways to prepare veggies. So glad I found this one! It is SO good!! I used summer squash, and eggplant along with the potatoes. Followed the rest of the recipe as written. Yummy!!

one of our favorites now - i spread it out onto two large cookie sheets (covered with aluminum foil and sprayed with non-stick spray) - spreading it out lets it dry/caramelize better - absolutely wonderful

Such rich flavor from simple roasted veggies.  It does take time though, so be patient. the only change I made was to add a little garlic.  I'll be making this again.

Oh my ! I couldn't stop eating this ! It was so delicious !
I made  as a side dish, so I halved the recipe. I chopped the onions cause the children wont like them sliced. 
Also, I was out of parsley so I used some dried oregano and I really liked the flavor it added. That is the way I will keep making this in the future.

This is a very good and easy to prepare dish, but I wish it cooked in less time.  :)   To make it easier I .....
(1. ) mixed the potatoes, zucchini, and onions in two plastic bags.  (2.) added salt and pepper  to each bag. Then I poured the veggies into the pan.  (3.)  stirred the oil and parsley  (used dried because that's what I had)  into the crushed tomatoes and poured it over the veggies.  
After an hour I topped one half with feta and baked for 30 more minutes.  I wanted to compare the difference in taste. Both sides were good, but I preferred the side with feta cheese a little bit more.  I will definitely add this dish into my rotation.

Excellent.  Didn't change a thing except halved the recipe.  Will be great for all that summer zucchini.   Interesting way of shredding the tomatoes; might also work to peel them then give a good chop.

I made this as stated but used canned puree. Cooked it in a very large sheet pan for almost 2 hours, but at 375 degrees. I liked it a lot as did my husband. it was easy and delicious. I cut everything on a mandolin to make them thin.

Super easy to make and super delicious! A 9x13 pan definitely won't work for the amount this recepie calls for though, so I second using a larger pan or just using 2.

If you’re just looking for something to fill your stomach with then this is all right ( very blan and little flavor). I like food with some life to it so I changed it up adding shiitake mushrooms, fennel, cubed lamb and Rotell green chili and diced tomatoes instead of puréed tomatoes ??

Halved recipe because it was too much for three people as a side, that said, I wouldn’t make it again, just too bland and too watery and too much work.

Yum! Yum! Thank you, Ms. Moutsopoulos! This is a recipie I will make again and again! A mandolin makes quick work of the prep, and it's worth taking the baking time suggested...(which cooks it to perfection)! I, and my loved ones, thank you again!

I like spicy, which this is not, but it was still excellent as-is.  No need to change a thing but next time  I'll try a little feta on top at the end to see if I like it that way too..  The guys didn't care for this but I sure did so four stars - yum!

This is a very simple and flavorful dish, it came out perfectly.  I did substitute the red onions for sweet white.  Red onions and I do not get along all that well.  I am a sucker for shrooms and garlic though and think I might try these additions next time.  I will also have to add the feta and crusty bread.

I actually loved this but I agree with other reviewers that 4 servings barely fits in a 9x13...4 servings?!?! More like 8...I made a double batch in a LARGE aluminum catering tray and remember that if you are scaling up, you will have to cook even longer to get potatoes to cook through and everything to carmelize.  Also, wondering if the wateri-ness is a result of using more waxy potatoes (like red skins which I did) vs. Russett...would be helpful if the recipe stated which.

Soooo good!  Easy to make, but  I did cook about 20 minutes longer than suggested.  Everyone loved it and i will definitely make again.  I made no substitutions, it's perfect as is.

This is simply outstanding.  My only changes were to add 2 regular sized cans of crushed tomatoes rather than do my own chopping. I added a few cloves of chopped garlic and used 1.5 lbs of redskin potatoes rather than 2 lbs because that was the size of the bag.  We ate it hot. Smashed some leftovers into a small bowl for a "greek bruschetta" spread on crusty bread the next day.  I even spooned some into an omelet for breakfast.

this was one of the best things I've ever cooked and that was highly unexpected.  the kids liked it, and the adults really liked it. it is NOT filling though so this is more of a side dish or make a ton of it dish

I made this tonight but instead of using tomato purée I used cut cherry tomatoes. I also sprinkled on some Parmesan cheese. It was yummy and I recommend it. Super easy.

For the tomatoes, I used two cans of diced tomatoes and ran them through a blender. It was just the right amount. Delicious recipe.

I have an onion intolerance, so I swapped out for chives. Delicious. My husband just went back for seconds. This will be a regular dish on our menu.

1/9/20 - Made this as a side dish for just 3 of us, so I cut the recipe back a bit and made it in an 8" x  8" pan. I added a sweet potato, but kept everything else pretty much the same. We enjoyed this next to some breaded chicken cutlets. My son really liked it, and claimed that it was something that he'd try to cook in his dorm/apartment.

This is the first time I've given a recipe such a low score.  Like other reviewers, I had to cut this in half to make it fit in to one 9x13 pan.  It was too oniony and we like normally like cooked onions.  I even added the Feta cheese like another reviewer recommended but that didn't help.  Other than the onion flavor, it was bland tasting.

Delicious. I had to use 2 pans. 1 large one and a second small one in in my toaster oven. For the tomatoes, I baked them a few minutes (about 10 at 250 0r 300) to get the skin off. They are easier to puree down the line.

Love the idea of this nutritious side, but mine didn't come out as great as I expected. Am thinking I could get better results if I roast at 425 degrees and hopefully lessen my timing in oven.

Was really looking forward to this dish being Vegan, as it would be my main dish for Easter instead of ham. Vegetables turned out mushy, and the presentation was not pretty. Looked like slop.

This was really nice.  No changes.  I/m going to heat in fry pan tomorrow morning with an egg on top.
The only bad thing was that I sliced two fingers on my mandolin! (blood and panic everywhere, but it's all good now)

When I first took it out of the oven I was like this looks weird... but when I took a bite it was so good! The only thing I’d do next time is to make sure there’s a good amount of zucchini in it or else the potatoes get overwhelming after a bit.

I've made this several times. The zucchini takes up a lot of room in a casserole dish. I've used two dishes, one a large and other a smaller one to cook this. I turned up the temperature to 425F and everything was completely cooked after an hour. The zucchini shrinks after cooking and you can easily  store this in a large casserole dish with room left over. I skipped the tomatoes the last time I cooked this. I would add the tomatoes towards the end of the cooking--after about 45 minutes.  I will definitely make this again.

This was a nice change from our usual side dishes, and was easy to make. I halved the recipe and followed it as written except I used a can of diced tomatoes (drained) because that’s all I had, and I added a bit of garlic powder. Oh, and I only had crumbled Feta, so I served it with that sprinkled on top.

Really tasty, and smelled great while it was baking. Makes me think of ratatouille. This makes extremely large servings, even as a main dish. I needed a 9x13 and a 9x9 dish to contain all the veggies. At the 1-hour mark though, after the veggies cooked down, I combined them all in the larger dish and mixed there. I used fresh tomatoes and just pureed them in the blender; did not need to add water. The best parts are the crispy veggies that stuck to the sides of the baking dish. The only change I made was using 1/4-cup less of the olive oil.

Easiest side dish considering all the ingredients.  Loved it!  I think a lot of any problems anyone has with watery can be corrected easily by cooking it a bit longer to remove the excess liquid.  I did add just a bit of oregano to mine.  I have tried and tried to love fresh cooked tomatoes but I can't do it so I used a can of Italian tomatoes in a thick sauce instead.  I see this as a regular side dish for a long long time.

Perfect winter comfort food--simple and satisfying. It DOES take time to prepare and 90 minutes on the oven, but the finished product is worth it! I used my food processor to slice potatoes and zucchini. I mixed my ingredients together in two big mixing bowls. I also tried to use the processor to grate the tomatoes . . . Not a success. I added the "mush" and also two fined chopped Roma tomatoes (with skin). Canned tomatoes would be perfect for this fish. I used two 8x8"

Wow what a recipe! My little kids devoured it like the little carnivorous meat eaters they are! I just made a few changes to the recipe:
-1lb of breakfast sausage (I used ground sausage but feel free to choose any kind of sausage ;) )
-1lb sharp cheddar cheese 
-4 eggs mixed with 1 cub of milk

I made this following the recipe exactly. I found that the vegetables had a delicious flavor, especially the charred bits. I was so surprised on how flavorful this dish had since it was just veggies, oil, and salt/pepper. Very good! I found that the potato was a bit too heavy for my liking, next time I would reduce the potato by half and include more zucchini instead.

Served with sweet Italian sausage to make it a more substantial main course. Very tasty!

I halved the recipe, substituted green onions for the red and used a 9x13 glass casserole dish.  I also added some feta crumbles in with the rest of the ingredients.  Baked about 1 hour 20 minutes.  Excellent flavor.

I made it exactly as the recipe called for and I think use of fresh tomatoes added so much! My husband doesn't like meatless meals, but he love this.
