I had several bags of fresh berries frozen that my family picked this summer.  Instead of buying store bought jam I decided to give this a try.  I thawed out the berries and used in place of fresh.  This was very easy and good!  I will continue to use this recipe and not buy store bought jam anymore!

This was an adequate recipe, but I felt that the jello flavoring masked the true flavor of the strawberries.

Very, very simple. My oldest son and I made this together and had a blast. This just about filled two 16 oz. Ball jars.

This is the best jam I have ever made.  Love the fact it is sugar free and I can eat lots of it.  It has been a steady hit at home and the office since I first made it.  Great consistency.

Very good but sweet.  Use plain gelatin instead of jello.  A little lemon will enhance the strawberry flavor.  If the berries aren't that sweet add just 1/8 to 1/4 cup sugar to sweeten.

I don't know if I did something wrong, but mine ended up more the texture of gelatin than jam. It did taste pretty good, though.

I tried four batches and none of them set up firmly.  It basically made ice cream sauce.  The recipe inside of the Pectin box for sugar free was less money and simpler.

Made this a few days ago with ease.  The kids and I love it on multi-grain toast and bagels.  The only hints I have are DON'T be cheap using the strawberries and using sugar-free raspberry jell-o works fine.

I loved it!!! I used raspberries instead of strawberry. It tastes wonderful, and it was so easy to make. I thought I made it wrong because it was so easy :). It seemed to runny before I put it in the freezer, but once it froze and I was ready to thaw it out, it was the PERFECT consistency!

This was pretty good.  It has the consistency of jello though which should be obvious since it is made with jello.  :)  I thought it would be a little runnier to make spreading easier, but it set up very firm.  It was hard to spread on my bread.  The jello masked the sweetness of the fruit too.  Not bad, but not fantastic.  I think I'll stick to using Splenda and freezer jam no-cook pectin.  Thanks anyway.

We've been working towards a homemade pantry for a while.  When my hubby was diagnosed with Diabetes, I panicked.  Sugar-free foods can be very costly and simple treats like jam on toast became dietary no-no's.  Thank you for this recipe.

Do you want a fresh strawberry taste or jello? My husband used jello once and ruined a batch. The fresh taste was obliterated by the jello.

I didn't like the idea of adding artificial strawberry flavoring with the Jello, so substituted an envelope of unflavored Knox gelatin and 1 cup erythritol (My favorite sugar free sweetner)
Yumm!!

This recipe helped me use up some less-than-delicious strawberries (i.e. flavorless). I wasn't looking for sugar free, so I chopped up my strawberries, added sugar and water to them and let them simmer until they fell apart. Then I added in the Jello (I used raspberry flavored) and followed the recipe from there. I also added in some lemon juice, which I really think added a nice extra bit of flavor. I would definitely use this recipe again as a way to use up any extra fruit! Thank you!

Excellent! I ran out of sugar free so I used a regular jello since my father hates sugar free.  I was worried because it looked so diluted but after three hours in the fridge it became delicious in taste and texture. I didn't eat it yet, just a taste and the taste and texture seem great. I will need to get back to you. Good luck!

The flavor was good, but mine turned out way too thick. More like a gel. What did I do wrong as I would like to try it again.

My son is diabetic so this was awesome. Took the same recipe but just changed fruits used a mix fruit and a raspberry sugar free jello. He just tasted it and he said it was awesome!!!
