These came out really good!  I used a triple chocolate fudge cake mix and oversized muffin tins.  The frosting I used for the filling was Betty Crocker's Whipped Cream Cheese (the best canned frosting EVER).  I frosted the tops with my butter cream icing.  Everybody FLIPPED for these!  And they were easy to fill with an icing bag and tip!!

I made this recipe for St. Patrick's Day with yellow cake mix and tinted it with blue food coloring to make it green. I also tinted the white frosting green and used green and white sprinkles on the top. Everyone at work and home raved over the frosting in the middle and asked "How did you get the frosting in the middle?" They thought it was the best thing. I am planning to make them again at Easter, adapting the color to fit the holiday. So easy.
