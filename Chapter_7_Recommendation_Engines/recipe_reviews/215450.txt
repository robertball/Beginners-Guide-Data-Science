Great flavor and super easy. Since I had a lot more turkey leftover, I made 2 versions: one with pie crust and one without. Both were great. In lieu of gravy mix, you can also use corn starch and bullion cube (works just as well) or chicken broth instead of water. This resurrected our dry leftover turkey into a fabulous quick meal (actually, several meals).

I have to say, this is easy and has great flavor! I used a glass pie dish so I didn't have to work at getting my pie shell into the dish. I also mixed the turkey and soup in a separate bowl and then spooned it into the pie shell. I pressed the turkey down to make plenty of room for the veggies. The gravy thickened nicely (I used walmart brand gravy packs ) and then topped with potatoes I had thawed out from a huge batch weeks prior. I did raise the rack in my oven and broiled the top for 5 mins before pulling it out....wanted a little more crisp on the top. once the pie sat for about 15 mins it was very easy to serve and still hot inside!!

Made this for the family tonight and they loved it. The only change I made was to drain the water from the veggies once they were done cooking.

It was good quick and easy. An excellent way to use up leftover turkey! Not quite enough gravy for us but I made more and drizzled over top once plated.

I used this recipe because I had a bunch of leftover mashed potatoes one day. Well, I have perfected it and made it my own using the basic recipe. It's amazing thank you so much

This is a good recipe to use up left over turkey.   I substituted cream of mushroom soup for the cream of chicken because that's what I had on hand.  I did not use the pie crust because who needs the extra calories?  For me this was just okay, nothing fantastic.  Will probably not make this again.

I used leftover homemade gravy, halved the veggies and replaced the other half with homemade stuffing.  This was awesome.
