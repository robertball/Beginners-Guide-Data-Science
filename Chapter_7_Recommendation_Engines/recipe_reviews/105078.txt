I really enjoyed this recipe.  I was looking for a different pickled egg recipe and this was it.  I was surprised by the strong garlic after taste.  I think the quality of balsamic vinegar makes a difference in the overall taste.  I will definitely make this again.

Sorry, I hate to do this but these were not good.  I grew up on pickled eggs (jar of beets, apple cider vinegar, and sugar) but this time I decided to do something different and use this recipe.  I used 18 eggs since I love pickled eggs.  There is a bitter coffee aftertaste to these. I will stick to pickled beet eggs.

I think the completely brown-colored egg is a bit overpowering (visually)for an otherwise nice way to make pickled hard-boiled eggs.  A thought: Keep the shell on, but crackle the shell, then place the [shell-on egg] into the liquid. Leave it for a day, or maybe two, then peel it. You should have a wonderfully marble-effect egg.

I loved the flavor of these eggs! I think the key is you have to really like balsamic vinegar. These eggs do not taste like traditional pickled eggs. The egg prep really depends on the eggs you use.... We use nest fresh eggs and the trick is to place eggs in cold water with1/8 cup salt per qt. Of water.... Bring to full boil...remove from heat... Cover and let set for 17 minutes....place eggs in to ice cold water until chilled. This way the eggs are cooked through and pop right out of the shell. Yummy thank for sharing the recipe!

These pickled eggs are not bad but not quite what I was looking for.  My son loves pickled eggs but he did not like the little sweetness in these, I would probable leave the sugar out.  The color is also very intimidating; if you can get past that itâ€™s not a bad egg.

This is our favorite pickled egg recipe. Just sweet enough and different than your standard pickled egg. We don't use the onion, just a preference, and they come out great.

honestly i loved the flavor!  It's the egg preping that did not work.  These eggs were only half cooked.  I advise to fully boil the egg before aging.  I questioned it before I made them, but wanted to follow the recipe exactly.  If you like a sunny side up pickled egg..more power to ya!  3stars for flavor!!!!

nice colour, great with salad, but i'd suggest adding a little water to jar until eggs are completly covered.

We make Balsamic Pickled Eggs also and all we do boil the eggs, put them in a mason jar, pour Italian balsamic vinegar over them and let sit in the frig for a minimum of 3 days. Out of this world goooooood :)

I thought this was a very bland pickled egg. But my opinion is that pickled eggs should tangy. I'm not really sure I like balsamic vinegar, so that could have been the problem. I didn't find the color intimidating.

This was the first time I'd actually made pickled eggs and they turned out all right, they were just much-too-sweet for my taste buds. My stepdad tried them and approved of them, so I'll say there's not good, not bad, I just didn't like them too much :P

I heard a tip on the radio recently to use a cheap Sauvignon Blanc instead of vinegar in the jars. Looks better. Also instead of peeling them before soaking them in vinegar, crack the egg shell all over, soak in the vinegar, then peel.... a cool crackle appearance on the eggs!

Very good...boiled the eggs a little longer and added 2 tbsp kikkoman soy sauce and a little cayenne after reducing the sugar by 1/2 in the brine. A nice change from the traditional pickled egg. My kids who usually only eat the yolks of hardboiled eggs and think traditional pickled eggs are too vinegary now enjoy eating the whites too thanks to the balsamic in this recipe

I made these right before Christmas so they would be ready for Christmas Eve get together. I really love balsamic so I knew these would be wonderful. I gave them five days in the fridge altho next time I'll make a huge batch so I can let them sit longer. The colour of these eggs is a rich brown. Another interesting thing was that when I placed them in a regular sized mason jar they ended up touching the sides and one another, resulting in these interesting white circles on them...looked great on the serving tray...some people didn't even know what they were :) I only crushed my garlic with the side of a knife but I think next time I'll microplane it for more garlicky flavour. Awesome awesome epic eggs!

This is one of my favorite recipes. When I make these I leave out the sugar. The balsamic vinegar can come off very strong for some people. Everyone that I have shared these with has gone back for more.

These were awful. Unfortunately I'm not experienced enough to know what changes would have helped in this situation.
