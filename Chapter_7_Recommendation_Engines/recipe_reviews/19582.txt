Great combination! My husband and I have had this for dinner on multiple occasions. We season it with Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper. We have also added cream cheese, and that's delicious also.

I was so skeptical about trying this, but so glad I did!  Definatly add spices of your choice and the soy sauce is a wonderful addition.  Perhaps cut the zucchini in smaller peices so it is easier to get a bit of egg and a bit of zucchini in each bite.

Such a versatile recipe!  We like things spicy, so I sauteed garlic and onions before adding the zucchini, and seasoned the eggs with poultry seasoning, celery seed and red pepper flakes.  Poured the egg mixture over the zucchini, topped with a little mozzarella and parmesan cheeses, and cooked till done.  I served it with toast made from Buttermilk Seed Bread from this site, and my husband said it reminded him of bed and breakfast fare!

I added sweet Vidalia onion slices to the zucchini saute and seasoned with oregano.  Delicious!  The ratio I used was one medium zucchini, 1/2 medium onion, and 2 eggs.

Good, simple, tasty recipe.  I used grated zucchini & onion
and used more eggs, together with the garlic.  Very tasty.  We all liked it but it wasn't a top recipe worthy of four or five stars...but it is worth a repeat for the simplicity of it.

Was looking for something different for breakfast when I found this recipe and it was great! I added some garlic salt and powder while cooking the zucchini to give it a little more flavor. I also used more eggs than called for (I wanted zucchini in my eggs, not eggs in my zucchini) and then sprinkled on some cheese at the end.

I love garlic so I added garlic powder and minced garlic with a little chopped onions and it turned out yummy. Great with buttered toast.

Our entire family, including our kids (ages 4,5&11) loves this dish!  It's really easy to reduce the amount of oil, thus lowering the fat content.

This surprised me, that I thought it was quite good. I almost added garlic, but glad I didn't because the 3 ingredients worked well together. I made another similar recipe on here that had garlic and parmesan cheese, and I actually preferred this one better. It seems like it is good for breakfast or could be a side dish. I did sprinkle the sauteed zucchini with salt and not the eggs and it worked fine. I will definitely make this again. I always have the ingredients in the house. TY

I have  been making this yummy dish for years, but I also add chopped red onions.  I sauté the onions and zucchini (in cooking spray instead of oil) for a bit to soften the onions, then scramble in the eggs.  A little pepper and this makes an amazing snack full of protein.  Perfect  after a workout.

My wife and i love this. This has been added to our regular breakfast menu. We have changed the ratio to 2 eggs per 1 zucchini and add the rosemary and oregano. They are wonderful, fast, and healthy. Not the childrens favorite but they eat it.

I had never considered combining these ingredients. After reading a few of the reviews I decided to cook diced onion, minced garlic and shredded zucchini in a skillet. When my vegetables were slightly brown I stirred some salt, pepper, and soy sauce into my eggs. This then was poured over top of the vegetables. Viola! Zucchini foo yung. An excellent low fat, low carb luncheon. I ate mine as reported, but you could make a sauce to pour over the eggs. Very quick and easy. I will make this with my abundance of zucchini. Thanks for the great idea.

Grew up with this. I tried to replicate but I didn't know you had to fry the zucchini before hand. I went to make this as a snack today following your recipe but it smelled way to good, so it is our only side dish for dinner! THANK YOU

Have been eating this all of my life, my Mom made this all of the time when my Dad's garden produced too many squash (every year). Many ways too spice it up i.e. diced hot peppers, onion and garlic, mushrooms, cheesees and many other combinations.

Fantastic.  A great starting point for the best scrambled eggs I've ever eaten.  Sauteed the zucchini with a few thin slices of sweet onion. I added a sprinkle of garlic powder, used 2 eggs plus 2 egg whites and after plating added diced tomatoes and a tiny bit of fresh parmesan cheese.  Yum!

I never though of how good of a combination zucchini and eggs could be together... but they do taste great... I tried mine throwing some garlic in the oil and then sprinkling with some italian herbs... however I didn't really care for mine over rice, the zucchini and eggs by themselves were great though

I love this combination, but I also add cheese shredded and a little jalapeno. Then I take flour tortillas, brown them a little and then put the mixture in them, roll them up and serve with salsa and sour cream........yumo

I thought it was great! I did add mushrooms and onions, parmasian, thyme and basil. Instead of one egg I used one egg and one eggwhite. I think it is a great to experiment with, and the zucchini and eggs worked surprisingly well together!

Have been making this for many years...actually grew up on this type of egg dishes.  You can use almost any vegtable with eggs. I love to stir-fry zucchini, red & green sliced peppers, onions, garlic, sliced carrots in some olive oil, adobe seasoning, chick boullion & some water from cooked angel hair pasta. Pour veggies over pasta...makes a great meal.  ( You can stir fry some chicken breast with veggies.  YUMMM!!!

Very good. I love zucchini so I absolueltly loved this recipe. Only changed a couple of things:

I only used half a zucchini and cut them into half-moons. Used 2 eggs. Added some garlic salt while cooking the zucchini, and I just scrambled everything together as it was easier in my small skillet.

I sauteed red onion and garlic in the oil. Then added one small zucchini very finely diced and after a few minutes 2 beaten jumbo eggs, salt, and pepper. I stirred it as I cooked the egg. When plating the cooked mixture I added 2 tsps of feta cheese. Very delicious.

This is great as is, or add some onion and grated carrot.  Sounds funny, but a little bit of mustard and cayenne pepper mixed in the eggs gives it a nice bite.

I would never have thought to put these two together, but it totally works.  Rather plain the way it is, however.  After tasting it, my daughter put some parmesan cheese on top of hers.  I mixed in some carmelized onion & feta.  Still a filling, simple, cheap meal.  This one is a total keeper.

Super Excited!! I have been eating zucchini with my eggs for a couple years now.  I can't understand why more people don't know about this.  It is as if they were meant to be together, but nobody else seems to know about it.  I am so excited to hear about someone else discovering this.  Zucchini also adds a buttery flavor when shredded into and cooked down with hamburger...and your kids won't know it's in there.

It was awesome!  I wasn't able to find Zucchini at the market, but italian squash was available.  I used half with one egg.  I also added rosemary and garlic and my husband fell in love with it!

Delicious! I actually shredded the zucchini instead of slicing, so it was a little more blended. It seemed like a lot of zucchini, so I used 3 eggs instead of 1, and it was perfect split between me and hubby. Also added a little bit of mozzarella cheese which was the perfect touch. Yummy and a great way to get extra veggies in your day!

Loved it! Made it twice in two days and my hubby (who isn't a huge fan of veggies) couldn't get enough! Would work great as a side dish, a quick lunch or even breakfast.

My grandma has made this for years! Love zucchini. Add some bacon, onions and garlic (garlic powder) in with the zucchini before you add the eggs. Makes for a great breakfast!

This is one of my favorite recipes just because it is so quick, easy, flavorful, and versatile. Sometimes I add other vegetables...mushrooms, onions, peppers...and when preparing this for the entire family I make eight times the listed amount, add cheese and whatever, and bake in a 9 x 13 pan. Great recipe, thanks so much!

Love versatile recipes!!! I used 4 eggs with one medium sized zucchini and sauteed some onion slices. Seasoned w/salt & pepper, a couple of dashes of soy sauce into the eggs, served over hot Jasmine rice sprinkled with Parmesan cheese and a bit more soy sauce over the top. Just a great recipe to change up with whatever your taste buds are craving!!

Zucchini & Eggs Haiku: "What? Huh? So surprised! Such a cinch, and tasted great! I'll make all the time!" Other than adding parmesan cheese the 1st time that I made this, I followed this easy, excellent recipe as written. I've made it on several occasions now, adding in mushrooms and bell pepper, or cheddar and ham, but I think what makes it different than just scrambling eggs w/ zucchini is the method of laying the zucchini across the bottom of the pan before pouring the eggs in. Just wonderful!

I was a bit skeptical, but this turned out to be quite nice, albeit simple. Among the veggies that a friend gave me, were two small zucchini, so I made this recipe for two consecutive breakfasts. I made it exactly as written; the first time, I let the eggs firm up so it became one large "pancake" which held together pretty well; the second time, I scrambled everything up a bit. This is worth remembering for future occasions when I need to use up zucchini.

My mother used to make this when we were children. She would fry bacon and dice the zucchini and cook it in a little of the bacon grease "until the water went out of it" and put the beaten eggs in and stir. I made this for my children and now I am a great grandmother and still have wonderful memories of this dish. I think the next time I make it, I may add some of the ingredients suggested by some of the other reviewers.

This was pretty good, but there was too much oil and not enough egg. Next time I will cut the oil in half and use two eggs for every zucchini. I added dried basil, oregano, garlic powder, and turkey bacon.

I've made this a dozen times now, and lately have been sprinkling sugar and cinnamon on both sides of the "pancake." It blends great with the browned, juicy Zucchini. This is a healthy alternative that nips my sweet tooth early in the day. If the zucchini is really large, I use two eggs but only one yolk to control cholesterol.

YUM!!  I love zucchini so this was perfect for me.  I added oregano, chopped garlic & onion as noted in the recommendations.  I also added another egg & a bit of milk to have more liquid.  Mine turned out similar to a fritatta.  Definitely a keeper! Thanks for sharing!

I used an additional egg since this was my entire dinner and sauteed about 1/4 of a medium vidalia onion with the zucchini.  Used lemon pepper for the seasoning and topped the eggs and zucchini with salsa.  It was delicious and a good healthy quick meal.

Really good. Easy and quick, and tastes like more than the sum of it's parts.
It is always good to have another zucchini recipe!

7-3-2016  ~I grew up with this in our Italian family and have returned to  it year after year, for more than 50 years.  A sentimental, delicious and nostalgic favorite.  (Note: in this instance I prefer to use butter rather than olive oil and  a little fresh minced garlic doesn't hurt)

My husband grew up eating this and then got me hooked.  Even our 1 year old son loves it!  We usually add some diced onions and top it with some shredded cheddar cheese. Perfect for a quick summer meal on a busy evening.

We like this one a lot.  to the reviewer that said it wasn't 'over the top'--what did you expect?  that eggs and zucchini were going to morph into something else?  this was simple, filling AND inexpensive.  I added some of our favorite season blend.  Had this with sliced tomato on the side and an English muffin.  I'm giving it 5 stars because 1.  very simple to have on a work night; 2.  it can be added to and still remain a quick dish 3.  inexpensive 4.  I always have these items on hand!  Sprinkling a little pepper Jack cheese next time!  Thank you for sharing this one!

Very good recipe. I might try some variations of it later on to add some more flavor, but it turned out exactly how it looked in the picture the first time :) Very good breakfast.

It's a great base recipe but to give it more flavor I added Italian seasoning while sautéing the zucchini and diced garlic 1 minute before adding the egg.  Mine didn't turn out as pretty as the picture but it tasted great!

So good and simple. I cooked about half a cup of sausage and tofu first. I transferred it to a bowl then proceeded with therecipe. It gave it a bit of a kick! When it was all done I added crumbled sausage on top of the zucchini and eggs. Sooo good. Thank-you!

I was looking to make something different for breakfast but that was still fast.  I happened to have some zucchini and so thought I would give this a try.  Love the taste that the zucchini adds to the eggs.  Super easy, delicious, and fast!

I've been working on different ways to make eggs so I was excited to try this recipe and I must say this was absolutely delicious. The soy sauce addition to the beaten eggs gave it a fabulous flavor.
