This is so good, easy to make, and tastes just like French dressing from the store -- with 100% olive oil, instead of the usual (yucky) soybean oil.  
I didn't have pimentos or green bell pepper, and I used green onions instead of yellow, and it still tasted just like French dressing.  I used garlic salt instead of regular, and added a whole lot of black pepper.  I love black pepper in salad dressing.  The second time I made this I substituted honey for the sugar, to make it healthy.  Still wonderful!
Finally, I just dumped the whole mixture into the Vitamix, started it on low, and turned it up to mid-speed.  The consistency turned out awesome -- without all the fuss.
