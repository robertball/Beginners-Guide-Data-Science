This is the 3rd "fgt" recipe that I have tried and the only one where the batter stayed on during frying!  Very good recipe.  I used very firm gr. tomatoes - I would recommend using some that have a little "give" to them.  I found that the batter was really enough to cover about 2 tomatoes.  I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 olive oil in the frying pan.  I cut the salt in 1/2 and it definitely needed more - I would use the entire amt.  Also, I sprinkled the tomatoes with Pecorino cheese after frying and served with spaghetti sauce.  My husband and I loved it, the kids weren't too crazy about it.  Great recipe, Beth!

These were awesome!  Its the first time I made fried green tomatoes(used cucumbers too!) that the coating stayed on when I cooked them!

They were yummy, even my 2 year old twins ate them.

Thanks for the recipe!

Try this breading to make jalapeno poppers if you like hot stuff... or even onion rings.  Excellent!

I gave this 4 stars cause there is no way that I could find to fry these in butter without the butter burning.I had to use Sunflower oil. I did use Ritz crackers instead of Saltines to add more flavor. I have to say that the recipe was a good one but the butter just did not work for me.

I had never had fried green tomatoes before but always wanted to try them.  I bought 2 green tomatoes about a week ago and one stayed green and the other got red, but stayed firm.  I used these 2 tomatoes to make this and they were both fantastic.  I used Ritz instead of saltines just because I happened to have a sleeve at home.  And I also cooked them in a mixture of butter and oil.  I fried mine at the next notch above medium and it was a perfect tempurature.  These were delicious and I will be using this recipe again.  You could even make this to make winter tomatoes taste good!
Thanks

This was my first attempt at fried green tomatoes.My husband and I both loved the results. This recipe seems to be fool proof as I got a little ahead of myself in preparing the fry coating and mixed all the dry ingredients together. I just dipped into egg, then dry mix, then repeated. I had one less dirty dish to clean. It worked wonderfully. Thanks Beth.

This is the best recipe that I've used.  I've tried flour which was good but a little plain.  Tried corn meal and it was a little too crunchy.  But the crackers and butter make the tomatoes super yummy.

I followed the directions except, as someone else mentioned, I mixed the cracker crumbs in with the flour and double dipped.  I loved the taste of the buttery cracker coating but I'm not sure that I like green tomato's.  Maybe I'll try something similar with other vegetables. (Zucinni?)

Pretty good but the flour mixture could have used some more seasoning.  Garlic powder, onion powder, or even some parsley.  Good basic recipe though!

BETHZUKE, thank you, thank you, thank you! I don't like cornmeal batter & the all flour is okay but this IT, for me! The batter stayed on & all I did differently was add a red/black pepper mixture for the pepper, plus added some garlic powder. I didn't share these w/anyone! :) Thanks, again!

Here's a secret that I learned from a special friend in Georgia when she made "FGT"...she used a mixture of yellow corn meal and flour and she seasoned the egg batter with soul seasoning, then cooked in bacon grease...(she's an old timer)Just thinking about this makes my mouth water! Yummy & delicous!!!

These were awesome!!  As some reviewers suggested, I did use Ritz instead of saltines.  They were just like the local restaurant makes.  I also recommend making the Remoulade Sauce a la New Orleans from this site to go with it.  To die for!!

I followed the recipe exactly, and it was good, but a little bland.  I think some added seasonings will make it great.  I also ran out of egg and crackers long before I ran out of flour, so next time I will half the flour mixture, rather than throw so much away!

DELICIOUS!  Wasn't sure I would like these from the first bite, but ended up eating 3!  I scaled the recipe to 3, used 2 small to medium sized tomatoes (the first ones from my garden this year)!  I did not have saltine crackers so I used multi-grain club crackers. I will be making these again!

Excellent Recipe!  I think the crackers really make this recipe.  They fried up nice and crunchy and beautiful golden brown.  Thanks for sharing this one, it's a keeper.

This recipe simply ROCKS! I've made it several times now and it comes out perfect every time. Just the right crunch and FULL of flavor. I do use a mix of peanut oil and butter for frying, other than that I follow the recipe as posted. Thanks for a GREAT FGT recipe!

Delicious!  Like other reviewers have said, the coating stays on the tomatoes very well, with only a small amount lost in frying.  To prevent the butter from burning, I used about 4 Tbs of butter and 4 Tbs of olive oil.  The only thing I disliked about these is that the finished product was a little bland, so we sprinkled them with a little salt.  Next time, though, I think I'm going to use Old Bay instead to really give them a kick.  I served these as a side dish with chicken fried chicken along with JP's Big Daddy Biscuits from here at AllRecipes and country gravy.

Amazing!   Only problem was it only covered 12 slices, which for me was a tomato and a half. I would double the eggs at least and cut back a bit on the flour, maybe start with 1/3 cup. Also, a few tablespoons of cornmeal mixed with the saltines worked great.  Wonderful coating, fried nicely and stuck to the tomatoes.

These turned out really well and my family loved them. I used egg whites only for the wash and instead of crackers I coated the tomatoes in panko bread crumbs.  Delicious! Now I know what I can do with all those tomatoes leftover unripened when the weather turns cold!

These were fantastic! The crackers were the perfect coating. They were nice and crunchy and not grainy like cornmeal breading. I did salt the tomato slices to dry them up a little before breading them. Nobody likes them soggy:)

This is one coating recipe that actually sticks on the vegetables throughout cooking.  I used it for fried green tomatoes and also for summer squash.  Yummm!

This is a great way to fry green tomatoes or any other vegetable!  I also tried cucumbers, which were great, but pickles were even better!  You can also add a little cayenne pepper for a kick.  Butter crackers, such as Ritz, work fine if you don't have saltines.  I recommend crushing the crackers in a food processor.  This recipe is a keeper!  Thank you for sharing!

These were super fast and easy.  A friend at work was trying to get rid of her tomatoes so I asked her to bring in some green ones for me.  I cut the recipe in half, used cornmeal instead of flour, mixed in a generous portion of parmesan, cooked them in olive oil and used boxed bread crumbs as that was what I had on hand.  That amount covered two small tomatoes cut in 1/4 inch slices.

Yum Yum Yum. I have never liked tomatos, but in the past I have enjoyed Fried Green Tomatos. I used this recipe and now I want MORE!!! I sliced the tomatos really thin so I wouldn't taste them much, and I, like others, mixed the dry ingredients together. I was very impressed with the flavor and how easy it was. OH I also added some onion powder and garlic powder.

Wow!! These were so GOOD! I followed the recipe exactly except used egg whites and townhouse crackers because I didn't have saltines then cooked them in a skillet on medium heat. These were the BEST. They had a crunchy outside and a tender inside.

Awesome!.. I couldn't stop eating these they were so good!  Picked some nice big green tomatoes today at our church's public garden... I've never had them before and I'm definatley a fan now!  I upped some of the spice: added some garlic powder, cayenne and salt & pepper into my flour along with a few T of corn meal.  Used panko bread crumbs in place of the saltines and eliminated one step.  Pre-seasoned the tomatoes with salt and pepper and used half veg.oil/margarine combo.    The double dipping gets kinda messy but it worked. Thanks!  Here's an after thought... I'll bet they'd be even more amazing in bacon grease but not so healthy...

I liked it a lot and I have about a million green tomatoes this year.  I didn't like the double dip, it was messy and it was not working for me.  I could not get the crumbs to stick.

These were delicious!  I sprinkled a little cajun seasoning on them, and used half butter and half olive oil for frying.  Some of us ate them plain and some added a little ranch dressing as a sauce - both were wonderful!

This one gets a 5 star...delicious.  I have my first tomato plant ever and for some reason that I don't understand, by the time the tomatoes turn red, they start splitting open and have to be thrown away.  So I decided to use them green.  This is the first time I have made fried green tomatoes.  I made them exactly as the recipe called for except I added a teaspoon of cayenne pepper to the flour mixture.  These were different from the way my grandmother used to make them...she used corn meal, but I decided I like these even better.  I will not let any more tomatoes on my plant get red.

Oh my goodness!  I have had fried green tomatoes a few times in restaurants and after seeing some beautiful green tomatoes at the farmers market I was inspired to try to make them myself.  This recipe couldn't have been any simpler and yeilded the most delicious results!!  I didn't have any saltines so I used oyster crackers that I ran through the food processor to get an even consistency.  Also, I added a little bit of vegetable oil to my butter since it started to burn.  Once I added the oil it went perfectly.  My husband and I devoured these dipped in ranch dressing and I can't wait to serve them the next time we entertain!  Thank you so much for the wonderful recipe.

Yum! I lucked across green tomatoes at th store and nabbed all they had - then ran home and looked for a recipe that would best suit these treasures! This recipe fit the bill, totally. They were cooked exactly as recommended double-dredged for a dense coat. If I ever come across green tomatoes again - this is what I'll come back to...

Such a wonderful recipe! I also used ritz crackers instead of saltines. I took a baguette of sourdough bread and cut it into pieces and toasted the bread. I then used a raspberry peach jam (or chutney), and spread a thin layer onto the toast...placed the fried green tomato on top and a dollop of jalapeno pimento cheese on top of that. Trust me...it's an incredible combination. I made over 60 of them and not a single one was left.

These are yummy! You could use red tomatoes as long as they are very firm if you can't find green. I would suggest using small amounts of butter for each batch so the first batch doesn't soak up all the butter. These are yummy and I'll be making them again!

I give these a 3 by themselves, a 4 dipped in ketchup, and a 5 in sandwiches. I think they'd be good dipped in salsa too, but I didn't have any on hand. My favorite is to layer them with sliced red tomatoes, cheese, jalapeno slices, and bread and grill it up. I'd make this again just for the sandwiches! I did make a few substitutions to the recipe - used panko instead of cracker crumbs, oil instead of butter, and added cayenne pepper, minced green onion, and Parmesan cheese to the flour mix. Probably sacrilegious to a Southerner! =)

Thanks to this recipe there will never be anymore bitter "Fried Green Tomatoes" in my house.I did find this a little messy to make so I put the kids to work. They had a blast. Also instead of using 3 bowls to mix & dip, I used ziplock bags(except for the eggs) it made clean up a breeze! I did have to use 4 eggs instead of the 2 it called for,and I used half the butter and mixed it with oil as others had suggested.Thanks for sharing!

We loved these! I used Ritz crackers, the taste was awesome. I have tried several recipes over the years,and they were either soggy, greasy, no flavor, or the outside coating would fall off. These held up perfectly. Will make again!

This is the best fried green tomatoes recipe that I have tried.  I used canola oil and ritz crackers.  I also used an egg substitute, which I usually do when I need need an egg mixture.  It is much easier to work with.

Oh so easy and oh so wonderful.  We tend to stay away from fried foods, but these with their thick cuts of tomato didn't seem greasy at all.  We loved them and will most likely be making them again

Wonderful recipe...  First time for both my husband and I, trying fried green tomatoes and we BOTH loved it.

I also substituted bread crumbs for the soda crackers, and added garlic and onion powder to the dry ingredients.

I did however need 3 eggs, and needed to clean my frying pan between batches, as the butter and coating blackened, even on medium heat. (It took me 4 batches to fry them all, and I cleaned between 2 and 3).

Breading was a little to thick for me. Would not use crackers next time. They came out nice and crunchy though.

I really liked these, however, this was too much butter for our tastes.  I cut the butter in about half and only used a little at a time, combined with olive oil.  Overall very good.  Will make this again.

Wow! What a great recipe! I had never made FGT but always wanted to since watching the movie. I had a ton of green tomatoes on my plants so thought, what the heck? This was the first recipe I tried and will be one I surely continue to use!! I used Ritz crackers instead of saltines though. AWESOME!!

These were really easy to make and very yummy! My grandma always just sliced the tomatoes, rolled in flour mixed with salt and pepper and fried them. Until now, those were the only FGT i knew of! I used butter flavored shortening instead of butter because thats what my grandma used, and i was afraid i would burn the butter. I also used a very firm green tomato. I now would advise that if u use a firm tomato, to cut it thinner than 1/2". We used ranch as dipping sauce. Again. VERY YUMMY!

I would give it a 5 star, but i did add some more spices. I added garlic and onion powder and also a few shakes of cayenne powder.  This is a awesome recipe! I had left over flour mixture and i did not fry in butter, I used a peanut canola blend... Very crispy and tasty!! used marzettis ranch dressing as a dip!! will make this again.  Pretty simple too :)

This was the first time I have ever had Fried Green Tomatoes and the were wonderful.  The only thing that I changed with the recipe is I just went ahead and cooked them in Crisco Oil instead of butter and used 1/2 tsp. salt instead of 1 tsp. of salt.  Very good!  Batter stayed on nicely.  This is a keeper recipe.  Thank you.

This isn't a shabby recipe. I think they should be sliced a little thinner. Maybe 1/4 an inch, instead of a half, because they were still too firm. And its a very plain taste, so I felt it lacked oomph. I'll try it again, sliced thinner, and with cajun seasoning mixed in, to spice it up. Also, I used half butter, half olive oil like someone else suggested- I just felt way too guilty using that much butter. :P

Really yummy! I had to make a double the amount of "egg" (I'm vegan so I use Ener-G replacer). I also replaced the regular salt with Hickory Bacon Salt (vegan) to give it a smoky taste.

If you grow your own tomatoes, October is the time of year to bring in all those green tomatoes that aren't going to have time to ripen before the frost arrives. I had two handfuls of little green one plus a few that were good size.  However I used a less butter and instead of the crackers, I used corn meal because that the way my grandmother made them. I'm sure the crackers would be good also.  For people that have never had fried green tomatoes, the taste is unique and the first time you have them you may wonder what all the fuss is about... I'm here to tell you that fried green tomatoes are one of my very favorite treats. I've served them with a meal and also as an appetizer.  I give this recipe a solid five star rating.  This is the way us country folks fix our fried green tomatoes!!

Look no longer for THE BEST FGT recipe because this is it.  I used my deep fat fryer in which to cook them with great success.  The coating adheared perfectly to the sliced tomatoes.  My husband, who dislikes vegetables, ate the equivalent of two whole, large tomatoes!  I served these with homemade buttermilk ranch dressing.  This recipe is certainly a keeper.

Loved this recipe. Last attempts had batter falling off. This did NOT. Used the mistake previously commented on of adding crushed crackers to the flour. Simpler to do and it worked beautifully. I would add a little more salt next time. And definitely not quite so green tomatoes!

This is the first time I've tried fried green tomatoes.  I added onion and garlic salt.  I also used a light red, but still hard tomato.  I dipped them in wasabi sauce.  This is one of my new favorite treats!  Thank you for sharing.

I'll explore another recipe before making this one again.  However, I can see why other people rated it well...  Pros:  This recipe has ingredients most pantries have "in stock".  The batter sticks to the tomatoes and gets perfectly crispy.  It's easy and tastes fresh, not heavy or overly greasy for a fried dish.   Cons:  The breading lacked flavor.  Perhaps using a seasoned breadcrumb instead of the crackers would help?  Or adding spices to the crackers or flour?  It's just not flavorful enough for me....

This was the first time I've ever made or eaten Fried Green Tomatoes. The recipe was very good. My aunt and I loved the flavor of the breading, but didn't much care for the green tomatoes, so I made another batch using tomatoes that weren't ripe yet, but weren't green anymore (pinkish orange) and still very solid. They were great,,,mouth watering, actually! Thanks for the recipe!

I have been frying my pork chops like this for years, but never thought of applying that same method to fried green tomatoes before.  I'm glad that I came across this recipe - it will be the way that I fry my green tomatoes from now on.  It is even better when served along side Chipotle Mayo also from this site.  Delish!

These were good, but I would personally prefer a little more seasoning "flavor" in mine.   They were a good, basic recipe.

Okay, these are still cooking on the stove and we've already eaten all the ones that are cooked! They are DIVINE!! I'm from WA state and had never even seen a fried green tomato, had to try it out to use up all of our green tomatos. Followed the recipe except for added seasoning salt and a packet of onion soup mix to the flour. SO GOOD! Thanks so much for sharing!

I've never had fried green tomatoes before, so maybe I just didn't know what to expect. But I thought these were bland, and too tart, and too greasy. I only ate three slices and they made me feel a bit sick. Not terrible, but not great.

This was a good recipe, but a bit bland.  I added butter crackers to the saltines which added an extra flavor.  Be generous with the salt & pepper as well.  Anyone would likes tomatoes love these.

Good way to use up fall tomatoes. I used Ritz crackers and it gave them an extra kick of flavor!  they reminded me of deep fried Zucchini

This recipe was excellent.  The only thing I changed was to add some vegetable oil to the butter to keep it from burning.

Excellent!  I also combined the cracker crumbs with the flour and added a little cayenne and some garlic salt.  Instead of butter I used canola oil.  They are wonderful served with balsamic vinegar or hot sauce as a condiment.

The best Fried Green Tomatoes ever!  Serve with a little salsa and sprinkle with cheese if you like.  Although, I cut the tomatoes a lot thinner 1/4 to 1/8 inch..thanks for a great recipe!

This was excellent!  I also mixed all of the dry ingredients together and double dipped before frying.  The tomatoes I got were really firm which I wasn't crazy about.  Next time I'm going to try this tasty coating on red tomatoes which I think will be delicious!

I served mine with  lemon wedges to squeeze over them and parmesan cheese. Delicious! 

I used half olive oil, but the butter still burned. I will use only olive oil next time.

I was out of corn meal so I used a little flour to coat.  I did not submerge the tomatoes in cooking oil to cook as I am diabetic .  But it was delicious & I will make it up every time I get firm green tomatoes.

This is a great starter recipe, I too used Ritz crackers just because it's all I had.  I added seasoned salt, pepper and garlic salt. I used butter but added a little olive oil so the butter didn't burn. The butter really adds flavor. I can't imagine frying them in just oil.

I had never made fried green tomatoes so wasn't sure what to expect.  They are messy to make but surprisingly delicious.  The tomatoes had a strong even spicy taste.  Both my husband and I really enjoyed them.  Thanks.

HORRIBLE!  I've eaten fried green tomatoes for decades and thought I'd use this recipe for guests.  HORRIBLE!  I knew that 1/2 inch was too thick so I cut mine about 2/5.  The tomato was hard after frying, the crust was TOO much!  Tasteless dry plank of hard tomato!  They  were pretty but NO!  I'm going back to my very thin dredged in flour and fast~fried in the pan.

My first time making fried green tomatoes--and they were fantastic! 

Like many others, I used Ritz crackers because I had them on hand. I made a batch using three medium-sized tomatoes, and they came out great. Paired them with a peppercorn-ranch dressing...yum!

I received 4 lovely Tomatoes yesterday. The first thing I thought was "OH! Fried Green Tomato !!!" Someone else said, ripen them and give me one. Nope. Didn't last that long. This is my first try at 'FGT'  Next time, I am going to add just a bit more salt, otherwise, PERFECT! As a 'Yankee', I find Southern cooking VERY satisfying!

It tastes bland. I had to put salsa and more pepper on it to "spice" it up and enjoy it. Will definitely see if other veggies turn out tastier with this cooking technique.

for the oil I used a blend of olive, canola, and sunflower oils. the thin ones, about 1 / 4 inch or less, turned out the best. top with favorite aioli and enjoy. our version of turning lemons into lemonaid.

I joined allrecipes.com specifically to review this recipe! Checked around on some other recipes that called for the traditional flour/breadcrumb/etc. mix, then decided to try this one. WOW!!! All I can say is, I was impressed. The trick of dipping them last in crushed saltine crackers is genius...they were so yummy and crunchy! I just used plain ol' oil to fry them in since I don't like to use so much butter and it was just fine. Also, we'd let our green tomatoes ripen so they were actually red, but they were still amazing! Great recipe, I highly recommend.

I tried these and first off, I would like to say 1/2 inch is too thick. Slicing them thinner is better. Also, the saltines should not only be crushed, but they need to be crushed down to almost powder. Otherwise the skin falls off because it's too chunky. Also, make sure your green tomatoes have a little "give" to them. Firmer tomatoes will just come out crunchy (which you don't want with FGT). Overall they were not very good.

Just cooked up fried green tomatoes.  These were great on a BLT.  This was my first attempt at fried green tomatoes and I was pleased with both the ease and taste of this recipe.

I've tried FGT befor and didnt like em now I know why they should be called Fried Almost green tomatoes.  the ones I fried befor were really green.  This recipe was wonderfull.  I loved em and so dod my BF.  Just make sure you get a firm but ripening tomatoe.  They taste much better.

These were very good and very easy.  I gave it 4 starts because my husband made some changes.  He added a pinch of chili powder and about a Tbs of cornmeal in the flour mixture.  He also fried them in our deep fryer instead of pan frying in butter.

He paired it with the following sauce from another site:
Guthrie's Sauce

3/4 cup mayonnaise
1/4 cup ketchup
1 tsp black pepper
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/4 tsp worcestershire sauce
1/4 tsp seasoned salt

This is the only Fried Green Tomato recipe you'll ever need.  It's simply the best!!!  I did not have saltine crackers so I improvised with ritz crackers and Italian Bread Crumbs.  Don't run to the store, just use what is in your pantry.  Recommend you add a splash of milk to your egg wash.  Happy eating!!!

I made these for a themed dinner night in the middle of the winter.  No green tomatoes to be found, so I used half green/yellow not ripe tomatoes from the grocery store and they worked just fine.  Everyone loved them and was asking for the recipe.    I did have to use x2 the amount of eggs and crackers though and that still only fried up about 3.5 of the tomatoes.

I've never had these before but they were excellent.  Yum!  I plan on using this recipe and covering them with marinara sauce with cheese on top.  I can even envision these on sandwiches. YUM!

I made these for the second time last night and I love them. I only made a few slight changes. I used Ritz crackers and added some Parmesan cheese to the cracker mixture. And I used half oil/half butter in the skillet. Last night, I used "butter spread" because I was out of butter and it turned out just as good.

Like Rookie Cookie, I also used corn meal and turned half of what I made into Fried Green Tomato Parmesan the same as I would with eggplant. I couldn't get these fried fast enough as everyone kept stealing them off the plate! Thank you BethZuke!

LOVED IT! I am a cook who tries to find recipes based on what I have in the house. I alter this recipe a bit and it still turned out fantastic. I used red tomatoes and Ritz crackers. This is the first time I had fried tomatoes and now I’m hooked! Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe!  Fingers got nice and dirty re-dipping the tomatoes.  I ran out of crackers, but it was good double-dipped in the egg and flour mixture.  Definitely need more eggs.  I only made two tomatoes and easily used two eggs.

This actually turned out to be a great breading recipe to fry anything in the skillet! Only thing I changed was to add seasoning here and there for the various things we use the breading for. Thanks for sharing!

These are fantastic! Next time I make them I will probably peel the tomatoes first, I think it will help the batter stick to them better in the pan. I added a little spice to my flour mix, I like things with a little more flavor. But they were fantastic!

This was the best recipe.  I was looking for something that would help make the green tomatoes really crunchy.  WOW..my whole family LOVED this recipe.  I did change one item, instead of saltines, I used Ritz crackers instead.  It added an extra buttery taste.  Thanks for such a great recipe!

This recipe worked really well, but I had to substitute red tomatoes for the green. I used it as a side dish for Stuffed Peppers and it worked perfectly. Next time I'll add more pepper, or perhaps cumin to give it a little more flavor.

Really good recipe...I followed it exactly, except I added sugar to the flour mix to give a little sweet taste.  I added about 1/4 cup or a bit less.  And, be careful when you add the salt, since the saltines have added salt that it's easy to forget about.  Other than that, it's a really good recipe, and like the others mentioned, my batter did stay on!

My grandmother gave me some green tomatoes and I had no clue what to do with them. I searched for this recipe and it was a huge hit with my husband and grandfather who have had these before. I also had trouble with the butter burning and for some reason, with the cracker mixture sticking completly. I will be making this recipe again though.

My Father-in law brought over some green tomatoes from his garden- and this recipe was a hit! The crackers had such nice texture and were perfectly salty which evened out the acidity of the tomatoes. Great recipe- I highly recommend!

These are wonderful!! I remember trying fried tomatoes as a child and hated it. How times (and taste buds!)have changed! I made the recipe according to directions, and I also added a little Lawry's seasoning (just a pinch) for a little extra flavor. They turned out great! I will definately make again!

I loved this!!  I had never had fried green tomatos before, but we will definiately make again.  The only change I made was that I was out of bread crumbs, so I used stuffing mix that I crushed.

These were perfect! I love fried green tomatoes but have had trouble in the past with them. I tried this recipe and one that called for cornmeal and this one is much better! The cornmeal was too gritty. These came out crispy and delicious. I did use lemon pepper I found in another recipe and it was great!

I gave this 3 stars because the butter burns and there's not enough seasoning. Good basic recipe if you add your own touches to it. I use half canola oil/half bacon grease. You really can't beat the flavor that bacon grease gives the toms. Also I dip the toms in seasoned flour(to make the coating stick to the toms),then egg, and then your favorite cracker crumbs. If you mix the cracker crumbs with the flour (like others suggest) you just don't get enough cracker. I agree with adding a pinch of garlic powder, onion powder and cayenne.
I served it with Burgerville special sauce (known to you great Northwesterners!) It was awesome!

These are really good and easy to make!  Even my children, who resisted trying them loved them.  Not a healthy dish, but certainly yummy!

Loved these! I used vegetable oil, as it doesn't seem to burn as easily as olive oil (which I usually use).

I have always loved Fried green Tomatoes and think this recipie is OK. I combined ritz crackers with the flour and used oil vs butter. i think they were too peppery so i will cut that down next time I make them. I cut mine a little too thin and the coating over powered the tomatoes. I also double dipped. All in all they were good but i think I like the old fashion batter better!

These are okay, but they sure go soggy fast. This is the second time in cooking life that i have made fried tomatoes & both times just wasn't crazy about it.
I will try one more time, maybe with ritz crackers & fry in oil??

This is really good!  I used in place of plain tomatoes and made a salad with layered tomatoes, basil and fresh mozz drizzled with olive oil...you know the one.  It rocked!

This was a good recipe.  I mixed the cracker crumbs in with the flour as others had suggested.  Instead of butter I used margarine so it wouldn't smoke and burn.  The cracker flavor seemed to come through strongly and sometimes I felt like I could've just sliced a tomato and put it on top of a cracker instead of making this.  While it was good and we ate it, it wasn't exactly what I was hoping for.

Maybe I did something wrong but I ended up with a big mess! The coating was in globs in some places but then on others the coating wasn't sticking at all. I followed the directions exactly. The taste was good, they just looked terrible. Maybe I will try these again but use bread crumbs instead of crackers.

WOW, this was the simple greatest recipe for fried veggies I have tried.  The crackers really make a great crunchy breadind and make you wonder why you haven't thought of using it before. Thanks for the great recipe.

I love fried green tomatoes, however, I was not crazy about this recipe. I think it may of tasted better if it was not fried in butter (or margarine, for that matter.)  I may try this again, but, I will stick to frying the tomatoes in oil instead.

Very good to eat but tough to deal with because you get the batter stuff all over your hands.
