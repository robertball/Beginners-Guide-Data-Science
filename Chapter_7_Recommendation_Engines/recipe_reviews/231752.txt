This is such a refreshing drink. Aperol isn't available everywhere, but is worth seeking out. It's a little bitter, but combined with the sweetness of the Prosecco, it makes the perfect, thirst-quenching cocktail.

I was introduced to this drink on my most recent cruise July 1st-15th and absolutely fell in love.  I like that it isn't too sweet.  It was light and refreshing and it's my go to drink now that I am back home!

Refreshing!! This is super simple to throw together when guests show up unexpectedly. I only had red aperitif on hand.

I discovered this delicious drink while vacationing in Italy.  It's my new favorite drink.  Aperol isn't easy to find, but they do carry it at big liquor store chains such as BevMo.
