These were very tasty and a great way to use extra squash and potatoes. To kick the flavor up a notch I used seasoned salt and I shredded a little cheddar cheese into the batter. I also used just a touch of olive oil in the pan, enough to coat. This makes a lot even when I scaled the recipe down. Tastes great reheated in microwave.

I don't really care for summer squash, but hubby does and family gave us some, so...  This was great.  A little on the greasy side from the frying, but very tasty.  I will definitely try just spraying the pan with oil next time.  the only other complaint was that the 'batter' was very, very wet and I really didn't want to keep adding flour.  Came out fine, but was surprised by all the juice.  Messy to make, good to eat!

I found this recipe because I was trying to make potato corn cakes, and this was the closest I could find.  This gave me some good ideas and a good base to start with.  Instead of the squash I used corn, and instead of the garlic salt I used real garlic, which I think gave it more flavor.  I really liked the outcome, and the dish was really good.  I think this recipe is really versatile, and could handle other spices depending on what you are serving it with, and I will definitely make this again!

I used frozen hash browns from the grocery store because that's what was on hand.  Instead of flour I used pancake mix-- tasted great.  Very easy and good taste.

These were good but really bland.  The 2nd time I made them, I added 1/3 cup parmesean cheese, 1 jalapeno pepper chopped small and1/3 cup chopped bell pepper.  For the salt and pepper I used cajun seasoning.  They had a much better flavor with these adjustments :)!!!  Thanks for a really good idea!***squash season again and I tried using frozen seasoned hash browns.  YUMMY!

I used green onions as the onions, and whole wheat flour in place of the baking mix. Instead of frying in oil, I just put the cakes on a vegetable sprayed griddle.  I can taste the summer squash in these hash browns!  Great recipe!

We loved this recipe and a great way to get kids to eat veggies.  We have changed a little by using zucchini and carrots.

I used a griddle and cooked 350 for 10 mins then flipped and cooked 8. I added rosemary, thyme and 2 tablespoon parmesean cheese. 4 year old ate 2 and they were made large. I only got 13 out of a double recipe.

I thought these were great!  I didn't think they were bland at all as some of the other reviewers said...probably just needed more salt!  I did add a little bit of cayenne cause we like spice!  Served this with a sauce I made of horseradish, mayo, cayenne and S&P.

We really enjoyed these :)  I found I had to add quite a bit more flour than called for, but the outcome is delicious nonetheless!

We followed the directions, but these turned out pretty bland (we had to add extra salt, pepper, garlic).

I'm a huge fan of potato latkes and when I stumbled onto this I had to try it immediately. 25 minutes later the whole house had my skillet surrounded waiting on the second batch! These are super easy and absolutely wonderful. As a matter of fact everyone said that this was what I was taking for the family Thanksgiving dinner this year.

I was skeptical when I first looked at this recipe but with the abundance of yellow squash from my garden I needed something new.  As I mixed it, I was still skeptical.  When I started frying them, the smell was incredible!  Even my hubby noticed it from the living room.  After I tasted one, I did go back and add more seasonings~ones that my family enjoys to add a little kick to food.  One thing I definitely recommend is adding cheddar cheese to the mix.  My hubby dipped these in ranch dressing and I used horsey sauce.  They are definitely going to be on our table again very soon!  Thank youu for sharing this recipe Ann!

I will make this again. It wasn't heavy at all. Came out very light and fluffy. As another reviewer wrote, I too used pancake mix instead of flour. I did try following it to a "T", but it wasn't holding firm enough for me. So I continued to add the mix until it was the consistency that I wanted. I carefully dropped large spoonfuls into the hot grease and they browned and puffed up perfectly!

I had baked sweet potato and russet potato leftovers from making potato skins, one tired yellow squash, green onions and 2 egg yolks on hand. I combined all that with some gluten-free baking mix, lots of pepper and Cajun seasoning. They were delicious!

loved these!  I sautéed the onions first with garlic cubes out of the freezer section and coated the cakes with Panko.  Yummy way to get the kiddos to eat squash!

These were really good. I did switch the amounts around for potato and squash so they were  squash potato cakes instead. It's what I had on hand. The batter was very wet and didn't want to add alot of flour so just went with it. May try using Pam next time to cut down on fat. I'm just not crazy about frying things in oil.

Very Tasty!  I used zucchini instead of yellow squash and used fresh garlic.  I salted and drained the shredded potatos and squash to release some liquid.  If you need a bit more flavor add any seasoning that you like.  I added some dried italian herbs and some fresh sage.  The amount of oil in the recipe seems a bit excessive.  I just coated the pan with a bit of olive oil and it was fine (remember no extra virgin because of the smoke point :-))

Yummers!  After shreading the potatoes and squash I rang out the excess water (wrapped up in a paper towel) to cut down on the liquid.  Used egg beaters and 3 oz. shreaded low fat cheese.  These came out wonderful.  This recipe is a keeper!

Couldn't find squash so I used canned corn. Used olive oil to try to save on calories but remembered (during cooking) that it had a low smoke level (whoops!). Everything else left the same in the recipe. Very wet in getting from bowl to skillet. Nevertheless, GREAT side for my meatloaf.
