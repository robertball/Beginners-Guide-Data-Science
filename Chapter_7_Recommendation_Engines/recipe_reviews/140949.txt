Very quick and easy--I totally loved it.  My six jack russells loved them.  The only thing I did different was instead of rolling and cutting I used a melon baller, split the ball in half and flatten it.  Baked in only 8 minutes and they're a better size for my gang.

I made these and my dog enjoyed them (shes a rat terrier). I used peanut-butter instead of parsley. The dough was dry so i added a bit of water, great recipe!

Maisy and Aubrey give these two paws up!  Substituted veggie broth for the chicken broth, and added 1 tbsp. of peanut butter instead of the parsley.

Since these contain corn, I would avoid feeding these to my dogs at all costs. Corn has been found to be bad for dogs (for ex, corn is believed to be linked to canine cancer). If a substitution were made with a different grain, then they may be ok. Also, I would watch the sodium, substituting low sodium chicken broth instead.

Did not add parsley. Rolled thin and cut into bones. When cooled I put them together, back to back with peanut butter in between.  I am making these as an extra little gift this Christmas for friends that have dogs.

easy recipe my pit bull couldn't wait for the next batch, He is doing tricks that I never knew that he knew!!! Although the dough was a little dry I added 2 tbls of chicken broth. I will try the peanut butter next time! Instead of a cookie cutter I used a shot glass and got a total of 47 treats! 2 paws up!!

I followed the recipe on this to a T. I think I ended up putting a little bit of extra stock in it just for a better consistency. My Collie loved these and couldn't get enough!

Followed recipe exactly and all three of my dogs loved the biscuits. Will make these in future and only thing I will do differently is make the biscuits in different sizes so the smaller dog does not have such a hard time breaking off a piece. Once they set, it was hard, even for me, to break one side off for the little dog.

My favorite part of this recipe is that it IS dog truly friendly (which many are not) & can be made from items that are probably already in your cupboard!

I can't believe I haven't reviewed this recipe yet! My dogs absolutely love this recipe. They go crazy for it and they seem to automatically react to when I tell them I am going to bring them a treat! I first made this as a gift for them for Christmas and I have never gone back since. This is a quick and easy recipe. I always omit the parsley and use peanut butter instead and sometimes I like to use beef broth for a change of pace. They love both the chicken and beef flavours.

This recipe is good, but I omitted the salt. Salt is toxic to dogs if consumed in large amounts, and I don't want to risk it.

Loved them.  Changed a couple of things . Used rolled oats instead of cornmeal. I added 4T of peanut butter for extra bonding. They turned out rough looking but extra crispy. No complaints from Randy the super-pup.

EASY TO MAKE AND THE DOGS loved THEM!! I left off the salt and stirred in a small jar of Chicken & Chicken Broth baby food in the 1/2 cup Chicken Broth.  Just to add more flavor.  This is a wonderful recipe to make changes with what you have onhand.  I will make again and again.

Thank you for a dog biscuit recipe WITHOUT peanut butter!!! We have a life-threatening allergy to peanuts in our house, and I searched the world for a good, healthy dog biscuit recipe. I will use all organic and whole wheat flour. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!! My Corgi boy will also thank you!!!

Very easy and Sophie enjoys them.  I substituted old-fashioned oats for the cornmeal and used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup all-purpose.  I also added a few tablespoons of toasted wheat germ.  I had to add a little extra chicken broth to get the dough to stick together, then rolled it out to about 1/4" thick.  I accidentally left one batch in for eight extra minutes, but they didn't burn, just got a little crispier.

I made these tonight for my shih tzu and pitbull but instead of chicken broth I used pork broth and instead of parsley I add cayenne and garlic and right before I put them in the oven I did an egg wash with cinnamon. My dogs loved them and my shih tzu didn't have a problem eating them like store boughten treats.

I've made these 4 times now. I do make a couple modifications as follows:
-I use oatmeal instead of cornmeal (because I've read that corn isn't the greatest for dogs)
-I omit the salt (no need for added salt)
-I use 2tsp peanut butter in place of the parsley (1, because I never have parsley on hand, and 2, because my puppy LOVES peanut butter)

They have turned out amazing every time, and my Cocker Spaniel doesn't take his eyes off of me when I'm making them.

Oh, one time I added a small amount of Bacon Bits. Ironically he didn't like those as much as the plain ones.

Quick and easy to make. My kids actually made them and used play dough cutters to make shapes. I added fresh parsley and mint from my garden. My labradoodle and maltipoo loved them.

It was a hit, our doggie Bruno loved these. We mixed it up by adding a bit of peanut butter and then some bbq sauce to another batch. He ate them all up. Thanks for the recipe.

These dog biscuits are very simple to make, and even my very picky pug loves them.  I have substituted the chicken broth with beef for a change of flavor.  They make a great Christmas treat for the dogs in your family.

My 15-year old Shiba Inu mix is the pickiest dog on the planet when it comes to treats and she really likes these!! I used beef broth instead of chicken, the dough was a little dry so I splashed extra broth on it when I was rolling it. Will definitely make these again, thank you!

I just made my first batch of these for our 5 month old Golden Retriever.  She loves them.  I did make some changes:  whole wheat flour, 1+ tablespoon of smooth peanut butter, and two teaspoons bacon grease.  I used coconut oil.  Easy just to make small balls, place on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper (no sheet clean-up)and push balls into circles with the palm of one's hand.

These are so easy....and our dogs love them!  My 12 yr old daughter made them for Christmas gifts and all the dogs we gave them to loved them.  I liked that they were inexpensive and used ingredients we had on hand.  We made the chicken broth from boullion. Going to try to keep our dogs supplied in these!

My dogs love them of course. I used bacon grease instead of the oil and some leftover broth from a pot roast in place of the chicken broth just because I had it lying around.

I made these for Christmas for my puppies and to give as gifts as well. They were a big hit, so much that my wonderful dog climbed on top of the table and broke into one of the gift bags for my sisters dog. Needless to say, she lost the rest of her treats and they were given to her 'cousin' Max. I'll definitely be making them again when she's off my naughty list again!

Super quick and easy! Dogs (a pit bull and a Great Dane) are ga-ga for them.  I ADDED a tablespoon of peanut butter and had  to add about 2 tablespoons extra water to get the dough to form.  Will keep making these!!

This was my first attempt at making dog treats and now my Beagle is addicted! I made the recipe as written (added extra broth, it was a little too dry to work with) Everything was in my pantry! So inexpensive and easy to make, my dog went crazy for these as did my friends dogs, thank you for the great recipe!

I have made these a few times now. Three Golden’s and one golden doodle love eating them! Easy to make and here’s the easier way I make them. While cut outs are much cuter, I roll the dough between two long sheets of wax paper then I cut the dough with a pizza cutter and line the squares on a parchment lined cookie sheet. (See submitted picture) They are made and baked in no time doing this method. Plus you can make the treats as small or large as you like. Easy clean up too and no extra flour for rolling out dough is necessary. Thanks to the person who submitted this recipe.

I made the recipe exactly as directed and these dog cookies were super fast and easy using ingredients already in the cabinet. Both my lab (who will eat anything) and chihuahua(super picky) inhaled them. I cut them with a heart cookie cutter and broke the cookie in half for the smaller dog. I plan to get a dog bone cookie cutter and color the dough red and green for Christmas

I made these w/ my little girls as Christmas gifts for the dogs we knew.  We doubled the recipe, and gave it to 4 different dogs.  They all loved it.  One owner told me that they had bought some expensive doggie biscuits from a boutique store, and their dog wouldn't touch it.  But her dog devoured these!  I did, however, make the changes based on the comments. Subbed rolled oats instead of cornmeal; omitted salt and parsley; added a couple of spoonfuls of peanut butter.

I eliminated the parsley and added the peanut butter as others did. I also made them grain free. So one cup of corn meal, and two cups chick pea flour. Since these are for senior dogs added a tablespoon of tumeric. 

The dough was very firm so needed a bit extra water. I then rolled the dough out and cut into inch squares. 

Each dog had two cookies , now all afternoon being followed everywhere i go

Annie says two paws up. I choose this recipe as I had chicken broth and fresh parsley that needed to be used. To make them slightly healthier I subbed one cup of whole wheat for AP. I didn't use the corn meal, dogs can not easily digest it,  and used 1/2 ground flax seed and 1/2 oats instead. I left out the salt and used avocado oil.  I plan on using these for training purposes so after rolling the dough out I used a pizza cutter to cut them into 1x1 inch pieces. I cooked them for 15 minutes then turned off the oven but left the cookie trays in the oven until completely cooled. This produced approximately 250 pieces.

I totally forgot the oil, and I substituted a half cup oats for a half cup cornmeal. I also added a little flax and parsley. They came out great anyway! funny story...I dropped a bag at a friend's house, and her husband didn't get the memo they were for the dog...oops! Anyway, her dog and my dog both loved them.

12.12.15  Today, these were "dog approved."  Dough was pretty dry, so I had to add quite a bit more chicken broth to get to a good rolling consistency.

I made this recipe today and added 1/2 cup of peanut butter and then a little more water until the dough formed. The dogs love them but now I have to secure the biscuit jar because one of the cats loved the old biscuits and always wants one when I give the dogs a treat and often would help himself. He obviously doesn't like peanut butter because I found what was left to about 5 or 6 all broken up but not eaten and he was going back for more; obviously looking for the old dog biscuits.  Will have to find a recipe for cats now.
