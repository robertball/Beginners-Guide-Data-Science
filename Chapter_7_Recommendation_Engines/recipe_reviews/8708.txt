This recipe has a lot of potential to be even better.  Substitute  3/4 C. white wine for the water.  Only use 1 C. of bread crumbs and a little less butter.  Layer chicken, swiss cheese and then pour over your sauce- add a little ground pepper.  Top with bread crumbs and drizzle with melted butter.   These minor adjustments bring up the flavor quite a bit.  This dish goes great with rice pilaf and green beans! This is one of our favorites.

I've been making this recipe for years and we love it but instead of the breadcrumbs, I use 8 oz or half a large bag of Pepperidge Farm herb seasoned stuffing, not croutons.  It tends to absorb the extra liquid that some people have complained about in this recipe's ratings.  Plus it's so delicious!
It's just as great microwaved the next day too.

I had this recipe already for a few years and have made some adaptations here and there.

Our family is now two people so I do this as a two person dish - one whole chicken breast will make two meals - one for now - one for later.

I use cream of mushroom soup and 1/2 can of white wine (or chicken broth if you prefer) and combine them.  I use croutons instead of bread crumbs - any flavor you like.  I also use baby bella mushrooms sliced.  

So I put down chicken, mushrooms, swiss cheese slices, croutons, soup/wine mixture, and later top with more swiss cheese.

All in all the recipe is very good.  For us just needed to be beefed up a bit.

Great Recipe!  Made some personal changes...  Sauteed 1/2 large sweet (Vidalia) onion, 1 TBS minced garlic and 1/2 cup fresh mushrooms.  Browned 4 chicken breasts, sprinkled with paprika, salt and pepper in 2 TBS olive oil.  Placed chicken breasts, onion, garlic and mushrooms in a casserole dish, covered with 1 can Mushroom soup, 1/2 cup white wine and toppped with crushed 12 saltine crackers.  Covered with foil and baked 30 minutes.  Uncovered, cooked another 15 minutes.....  Heavenly and fit for company if plated properly with garnish.  Served with wild rice and broccoli with cheese sauce.

Oh, this is one of those really surprising meals that is fairly easy but tastes like you spent $30 at a restaurant.  I did make quite a few changes per JUDITH's comments.  I started by pounding out 3 very large chicken breasts and then cutting them in half.  I sauted crimini mushrooms and vidalia onions in a bit of EVOO and then deglazed the skillet with white wine and continued cooking the mushrooms until just firm.  Removed the mushroom/onion mixture to a plate and then sauted the seasoned chicken breasts just until slightly browned (not cooked all they way through).  I removed the chicken breasts from the skillet, added back in the mushroom/onion mix.  I then mixed the soup (98% fat free) with 1/2 cup of white wine and poured that over and added the chicken breasts back in.  Placed 1/2 pieces of 50% reduced fat swiss cheese on the chicken and then just sprinkled with some italian seasoned bread crumbs.  Used about 3 T of butter to cover.  I then covered the skillet and baked for 30 minutes.  Took the cover off, baked for 15 more minutes.  I served with roasted red potatoes and fresh french bread.  I would make it this way for important company, it was seriously that good.  I know it's a few changes but they are well worth making!!  Hope you enjoy it as much as we did.

Family loved this recipe. I did change it up a bit, Used one family size can of cream of chicken soup, seasoned chicken breasts with Lawrys Seasoned Salt and added instant rice on top of my chicken before the soup. With the rice, it makes an instant meal for a family, just add a veggie or salad.

Followed this recipe as is the first time I made it and it was good. Second time I browned the chicken in olive oil. After removing the chicken I sauteed mushrooms and sliced onions spread this over the chicken before adding the swiss cheese. I deglazed the pan with 1/3 cup cooking sherry then blended in the soup and some mrs.dash seasoning. I also cut the crumbs and butter in half.   There were no leftovers and hubby now requests it once a week.

I made this for dinner last night and it was very good.  I added a thin ham slice before the cheese and used wine instead of water as a previous person stated.  I also used cream of mushroom soup.  A real keeper, thanks!

Eating this as I sit & give it my review. I did change it up a bit as it sounded to me like it needed more flavor. I was afraid it would be to bland as written. I sprinkled the chicken breasts with Tastefully Simple's All seasoning salt, Garlic! Garlic!, and Onion! Onion!. Then I poured the cream of chicken on top, added some minced garlic, covered with shredded Italian cheese (because that's all I had), then I put some Italian seasoned bread crumbs generously on top (I did not measure out 2 cups). I think the end result is delicious! My kids are not fighting me to eat it, they're 6 & 9 yrs old, and I'm going to go out on a limb & say my husband is going to enjoy it when he gets home also. Thanks for a great, easy to make, minimal ingredient meal!

This is really inedible made as written.  It's a huge amount of dry, loose breadcrumbs on chicken with some patches of butter on top.

Used a 1/2 can of milk in place of water. Used an 8oz bag of stuffing in place of bread crumbs and added some fresh mushrooms. Delicious and easy!

This is a good recipe but not really above average in my opinion.  We seasoned up the chicken and added a slice of ham for added flavor.  The cheese mostly just slid off into the soup.  I used a little less bread crumbs than what was called for and will probably use even less next time.

I have made this before with the following modifications:  I used two cans of the soup adding 1 cup of milk (instead of water) to the soup before placing over the chicken.  Instead of the seasoned bread crumbs I use Pepperidge Farm Herb Stuffing mix (dry) and sprinkle it over the chicken.  I also cut down on the amount of butter used.

I halved the recipe, but still used the full can of chicken soup. It came out very well and my hubby can't stop raving about it. The changes I made were to saute some onions with green chilies and garlic paste (didn't have plain garlic) and this was added on top of the chicken before adding the soup. Then I added some seasoning on top of the soup before covering with cheese slices and sprinkling the bread crumbs. This added a little extra to the dish!

I liked this recipe but thought there were far too many bread crumbs. Next time I'll follow a few of the suggestions that don't include the crumbs and I feel like it'll taste as wonderful as it could!

This recipe is great - I've been making a version of it for years courtesy of my mother! I use two cans of soup, and then just refill those cans with water to measure the water (why dirty another dish?). I always put a bit of the soup/water mixture under the chicken breasts, and then just top the meal with Pepperidge Farm's Herb Seasoned breadcrumbs so it's nicely covered in breadcrumbs. I don't use butter on the top since I'm fairly health-conscious and this dish is indulgent enough. Instead, I just tent the entire dish with foil (to protect the breadcrumbs from burning, but still allow circulation and heat flow) and bake it for 35-40 minutes, then remove the foil for the last 10-15 minutes. I like serving this with rice (white tastes better, but brown is healthier... I switch) and green beans. I love the "gravy" type sauce that results, and end up mixing my plate together. It is really quick, and can even be made the night before... just assemble in a covered dish, and then when you get home from work the next day, just preheat the over and bake. It's the perfect meal to take to someone's house, surprise a new mom with (so she doesn't have to cook) or leave for the babysitter to feed the kids. Yummy to all ages!

This recipe is a real winner!  The flavor is great, however I sprinkled mrs dash over the top of the bread crumbs because I didnt have italian ones.  Also, I made this twice this week for different people, and the second time around I used a generic soup, and it was really watery and didnt have the same consistency that campbells soup had, just an FYI in case you need to buy the ingredients.  Otherwise the dish is wonderful!

This was really good.  I did sub the wine for water and it turn out wonderful.  I also added my own special salt seasoning to the dish and one onion.  I loved it enough to pack if for lunch the next day.

My husband and I really enjoyed this meal. It was so easy to make! I added a slice of provolone cheese over the chicken in place of the swiss someone suggested. My husband is not a chicken fan, but he was surprised how much he liked this dish. The chicken was so moist! Wonderful and easy to make.

I've been making this forever....but instead of the 1/3 cup water, I mix the chicken soup with 1/3 cup of chardonnay (gives it an amazing taste) and instead of bread crumbs I use stuffing mix!

I made this as another reviewer suggested. Lined my pan with tinfoil, spread chicken soup across bottom, poured chicken broth over (didn't have any wine), put chicken on, put cheese on, only used a cup of bread crumbs, and a 1/4 cup of melted butter, drizzled over the breadcrumbs and ground some pepper on it. Cooked uncovered for about 50 minutes at 350. It was pretty good. Served it with mashed taters and corn. It got approval rating from both the men in the house. Will make again!

This recipe is plain and does not have a lot of "kick" to it. Instead of water, I used white wine and added salt and pepper at the table and Parmesan cheese made it taste a bit better. It needs some sort of spice, I just couldn't figure out what, but it needs something! This recipe is good if you want an easy to make quick meal but don't expect much.

This was so great tasting! I didn't have any breadcrumbs, so I made my own with french bread and italian seasonings. Then after I baked the chicken, I used my convectional oven and  browned it real good. It was beautiful as well as , as my husband said, :This is a 4 star hotel recipe".

I recently started using a variation of this recipe and I think it might be my hubby's favorite!  Instead of the bread crumbs I use stuffing... it doesn't matter which brand. I use about half a box but my hubby and I love stuffing! I leave out the water entirely and instead blend in about 1/4-1/3 cup of milk.  If you pre-cook the chicken on a skillet for a few minutes before hand, you can cut the oven time to about 20-30 minutes.

I  made this last night the following way: I layered the pan with small pieces of chicken, poured mushroom soup over it, added a little water to the soup mixture(which made it too runny when it was finished), put deli slices all over it(I had turkey slices available), and layered on top of that swiss cheese. I baked at 350 for 30min and it was great. My husband commented "wow, this is really good!" lol. So..I believe it turned out fine. A little runnier than I liked, but will change for next time. Great and easy dish to make! I will probably make rice sometime this week and serve over that with the leftovers. Thanks!

This was a nice recipe.  I did substitute cooking sherry for the water.  Personally, I thought there were too many breadcrumbs.  Next time I will use much less.  Otherwise, I thought it was good enough to make again.  Oldest daughter said, "Good", and also commented that it made her think of Frankenmuth chicken.  Those of you in Michigan know what that means, and that it is a compliment.  Youngest said "Really Yummy!"  Hubby hasn't chimed in yet, as his is his work lunch, today. This was also a very easy dish to prepare.  Served it over buttered egg noodles with a side of Italian-style Swiss Chard.

We like 1/2-3/4 soup can of dry white wine in place of the water.  I melt the butter and mix with the seasoned bread crumbs and sprinkle over the top.  I also mix garlic, onion and white pepper into the soup per your own taste.  You can even make this in 1 pan on your stove top.  Cut chicken into bite size pieces and and cook in a little EVOO, garlic, onion and white/black pepper.  Add add remaining ingredients and enjoy.

What an improbable recipe to be this good!  And so easy.  For 4, I used 1 lb chicken breast tenders, reduced fat soup with 1/4 cup dry white wine.  Sprinkled the tenders with pepper and Italian seasoning.  Used 1/4 cup plain bread crumbs.  This turned down the calories, but it didn't turn down the flavor.  Thanks, Pamela.

I have been making this recipe for years.  I do not add water or butter and the consistency is great for serving over rice or pasta.  I have seen where white wine has been mixed with the soup, but that is optional, of course.  I too use seasoned stuffing mix, which eliminates any need for additional seasonings such as salt. (Especially since can soup has plenty.)  I recently made this without the stuffing for a lower carb meal....de-lish! One last thought, I find using chicken tenders or bites (cut up breast) cooks more evenly and in less time....I use my toaster oven!

This has been a family favorite for a long time and I was very pleased to find it here. I alter it a bit by using cream of chicken with herb soup and gryere cheese.Teenage kids love it and this is one of the only meals that they will reheat the next day

This recipe was good considering how simple it is and I love simple dishes. Passed the picky husband test and my live-in brother in-law asked me to make it again. I always season chicken with some rosemary. It seems to go really well with the swiss. We eat a lot of chicken and it's good to have something just a bit different and the swiss cheese adds just that.

This was delish!! Except that 2 cups of bread crumbs seems to be VERY extreme - the family didn't like that part, so I will cut this down in the future.  I also changed it up and included 1/2 a soup can full of heavy cream along with the water. Although it was "soupy", there was a lot of gravy in the end, which was perfect over rice.  I also used 2lbs of chicken pieces, cut into chunks, and baked for about 35 minutes. My Swiss Cheese layer was just slices to cover the entire dish, which only took 7 slices. (I got to eat the 8th slice - YUM!)  Overall, it was a very simple dish, and one I will make again.

Fantastic! My fav recipe from this site so far. I used sherry like others instead of water, and I used chicken stuffing mix from Stove Top for breading. I made noodles to go along with the chicken. I cook them in as little water as possible with chicken cubes and a stick of butter.  When noodles are done there should be no need to drain. Very tasty noodles. First thing my son said afer taking his first bite was, "You're making this again!" Thanks, it will be an enjoyable addtion to our meal plan.

My family loves this recipe.  So do all the other families I make it for (it's a great - sick, new baby, etc. - "take to a friend" dish!  I dredge my chicken in egg and breadcrumbs, then layer them in a casserole dish, place the slices of cheese on the breasts, and pour the soup around the edges.  My version does take a little more prep time, but well worth the effort.

I thought this recipe was just ok. There was WAY too many breadcumbs. The amount could easily be reduced to 1/3 of the called for amount. The excess crumbs turned into a soggy paste. Also, the Italian breadcrumbs really contributed to the very very salty taste of the dish. I think this could be a five star recipe with a few personal changes.

I found this to be just okay. I made it no changes. It might be better with the chicken stuffing like some other users had suggested. Everyone ate it, but they weren't crazy about this dish. My family liked the anniversary chicken much better ,which is also on this site.

I think 45 minutes is too long to cook boneless breasts.  The flavor was good - I seasoned meat with lemon pepper, garlic powder and poultry seasoning. Kind of unappetizing looking on the plate, but otherwise everyone ate it so I can't complain.

This recipe was way to watery, I even got the real Campbell's condensed cream of chicken. But despite it being watery it did tastes good. Oh yeah, I think the amount of breadcrumbs that it calls for is purfect.

This is a good recipe.  I crushed garlic in the soup mixture and used less bread crumbs than it asks (about 1 1/4 cups)for and I think it turned out ok. I also used Mushroom soup which worked also. I will make it agian.

Easy to make and everyone liked it...especially our 18 month old! She chowed down! Next time I probably wont so many breadcrumbs but it was good. Might just used plain breadcrumbs too...as it was a bit salty to me. Thanks Pamela for posting this recipe!

This was very good.  Enjoyed the flavors.  Listened to a number of other reviews and added white wine instead of water and it was wonderful.  Definitely will make again.

One of those great base recipes that allows you to modify to your tastes. I sprinkled the chicken with Trader Joe's "21 Seasoning Salute" and garlic powder, then placed the swiss on top of that before adding the soup mixture. To the soup I added white wine, a TBSP of melted butter, more seasoning & a little water to thin it out. We are doing a low-carb diet, so I topped with crushed pork rinds instead of bread crumbs. It was easy & delicious - tasted like it took way more effort than it did!

I loved this and so did my hubby.  I did make a few changes for our tastes.  I browned garlic and onions and spread them on the chicken breasts.  Then I put Kosher salt, Emeril's original essence seasoning, and some oregano on them.  I then put the swiss cheese on.  I mixed cream of mushroom soup with white wine and poured this over the chicken.  I covered this with panko and put pats of butter on the top.  I baked it they way you did.  We just loved it!!!!

Very tasty, easy recipe.  You do NOT need to add any salt! I love salt and I thought it was salty (I did cook w/ some season salt).  Sauteed onions and celery and used wine instead of water.  Added parm z to the bread crumbs.  This will def become a regular in my cooking.

Very fast and easy, just layered everything like it said, it was a little watery, but when we had it for leftovers it wasn't as much. Baked it for about 20-30 minutes longer than suggested. Very good with brown rice and/or broccoli as a side!

Absolutely fabulous! Baked it for a wedding reception for 60 people. It was the most popular item on the menu. The most amazing thing about it, was that cooked for 2 hours and was still incredibly tender and moist. I substituted white wine for the water, but did add some water to thin the sauce a bit before baking. Omitted the butter and baked uncovered which browned the dish nicely. Couldn't have been any easier or more delicious!

This is a simple and delicious recipe for chicken breasts. I have done several things differently, like substitute half of the cream of chicken with cream of mushroom, very good and adds texture to the gravy. I have also used jalapeno jack cheese instead of swiss, deliciously adds a hint of spice.If you do this then you can add sliced nacho peppers to the top of the dish for a prettier presentation. It is much easier to simply melt the cheese into the gravy and pour over the top instead of layering.

Very good, my husband and I both loved it. The only changes I made were to lightly season the chicken breast before placing in casserole(pepper and garlic powder) and use white wine instead of water. I've already shared this recipe with several friends and will definately make again.

This was outstanding! I think without my adjustments (per other reviews) it would have been average so that's why I'm giving it a 4. Here's what I did. 4 chicken tenderloins, 1 can soup, 3/4 cup white wine, crushed fat free croutons subbed for italian bread crumbs just enough to cover chicken and about 3 slices of cheese also just enough to cover chicken. Layered chicken, cheese, soup mix and bread crumbs with no butter on top. This made a lot of sauce but we used it over rice, I think it would be awesome over steamed Yukon Gold potatos, too. 5 stars the way I made it. Reviewers are right about the wine, definitely gives it great taste. We will definitely have this again!

This is a really good recipe but I made some changes. The white wine option sounded really good but the only thing I had was beer...so I used that. Also, the recipe called for cream of chicken soup but the only thing I had was cream of mushroom so I used that and threw in some fresh mushrooms for good measure. In the end it came out more like a lazy and cheesy chicken marsala...something I'm sure I'll be making again.

This was okay. I used diced chicken meat instead of chicken breasts. It turned out like a casserole. The flavor wasn't bad, but others suggested I should have used cheddar instead of swiss. I would love to try it again, but using the breast meat.

This was very tasty and really easy to make. I might think to add more cheese as I didnt taste a lot of cheesiness- but I would make this again.

Rather bland.  Chicken didn't get cooked all the way after 45 minutes.  I don't think I'll make it again.

This was ok...I didn't add as many bread crumbs listening to some other reviews. All the cheese slid off the chicken instead of staying on top. This dish also didn't ahve much flavor to it. Whether I make it again or not and change some stuff up is still open for thought.

This is a fabulous recipe.  Easy to make and delicious enough for a dinner party.  I usually don't change a recipe the first time I try it but I just had to substitute cooking sherry for the water and it was wonderful.  The kids ate this too and loved it.

This recipe was good and very easy to make, but the 2 cups of Italian seasoned bread crumbs were a bit much! Next time I will use half the bread crumbs  try sprinkling them directly onto the chicken rather than on the very top. The Swiss cheese is what makes this recipe a keeper...my husband is not a big fan of chicken  he loved this! Will definitely make again!

I love this recipe!  I've made it many times but I've used cream of mushroom soup instead of chicken and top with either crushed Ritz crackers as another reviewer suggested or soda crackers.  Thanks for sharing this quick, simple, easy yet tasty recipe Pamela.

This is a great start. I made a few changes after reading the other comments. We like allot of gravy so I used 1 can cream of chicken soup and 1 can of cream of mushroom soup. Used 1/2 cup of white wine instead of water, cut the Italian Bread Crumbs to 3/4 cup, 1/4 cup melted butter. I started with 2 TBS Olive Oil. Sauteed 3/4 TBS minced Garlic and 1 small sliced sweet onion. Removed the Onion & garlic. Added 1 more TBS Olive oil to skillet. Seasoned the chicken breast with garlic salt, pepper & paprika & browned both sides of the chicken breast. Chicken should not be done through. Place Chicken in casserole dish and place a piece of swiss cheese on each piece, add soups & wine to the skillet along with the onion & garlic and heat. Pour over chicken, sprinkle bread crumbs on top and melted butter. I baked for 45 - 50 minutes in 350 oven. Next itme I will use less bread crumbs & butter.

I thought this would be the typical Campbell's Soup recipe - boy was I wrong!  I didn't have Swiss so substituted shredded parmesean.  Also followed advice of other readers - used chicken broth instead of water, and sauteed garlic and mushrooms, then sauteed the breasts (bonless) and put it in the dish first.  The flavor is AMAZING.  Thanks for all who posted the changes before me - good work everyone!

This was so good. My family all had seconds. No leftovers. It looked so pretty on the dish. I also loved the fact that it took only 5 min. to prepare. The only changes I made was I used a family size can of soup 33% more. I also used a half can of milk instead of the water. 1,000 thanks for posting a great recipe!

Delicious!  Everyone loved it. Very easy too. Even one of my teenage boys could make it. I used an entire box of stuffing. I then added mushrooms and craisins to the stuffing mixture.  I will definitely make this again.

I cut my chicken breasts lengthwise so they'd be thin. I used condensed chicken and mushroom soup. Use just enough soup to cover each cutlet and cover with swiss cheese (I used 2 slices per cutlet). Lastly I covered the dish with aluminum foil for the first 1/2 of cooking and then took it off to brown. Delicious!

My husband and my kids all like this dish. Only adjustments: I roll the breasts in eggs and coat with bread crumbs, as well as sprinkling crumbs on top. I also probably use more cheese because we like alot of cheese. Also we use two cans of C of C soup for more sauce, and I also do not use the butter (you can spray with nonfat butter spray for a little crunch). Very good!

Very easy to make - cooked in suggested time. Husband loved it - I did place stuffing mix on top instead of breadcrumbs as other suggested, this worked well. I did not put butter on top either. Thought it was a bit salty ( and I LOVE salt) due to the stuffing mix. Would make again - when the husband and kids love it , who can argue with that.

This was pretty good. It wasn't the best chicken dish I've had though. I halved the bread crumbs and still think it was too much. Next time I will try the crutons instead. It was also a bit bland and I even used white wine instead of water as suggested.

This was very yummy, but I can't give it a 5.  I did add a slice of Ham to each chix breast, my Swiss cheese disappeared, even though I used the bread crumbs.  I didn't use as much as the recipe called for, I just sprinkled until the cheese was covered.  It is very easy to make and the "sauce" was awesome.  I will make this again, maybe next time, I will wait til the end and then add the cheese.

I don't know where to begin with where this went wrong.  I followed others advice and cut down on the bread crumbs and it was still way too much.  All I tasted was bread crumbs as everything else was flavorless.  I don't know if changing amounts would necessarily make any improvements with the taste.  The presentation was also lacking.

My family loves this recipe and it is great reheated but because we are watching our salt intake, I use the healthy request soup which has less salt and substitute one cup plain breadcrumbs for one of the seasoned cups.

Another home run. Something this easy to make shouldn't taste so good. 10 STARS!! I use plain panko bread crumbs and add Italian seasoning to it.

This is an excellent dish and my kids absolutely love it.  However, it is extremely high in fat so I make it with healthy request soup by campbells, no butter and fat free swiss cheese slices.  The topping for mine is simply Peppperidge Farm stuffing crumbs mixed with a little bit of chicken bouillon and water to make a thick paste and place it on top of the swiss cheese and chicken.  You won't miss the fat and the flavor is excellent.  Enjoy!

We loved this recipe but I did make a few changes.  Instead of water I used white whine.  I added a dollup of sour cream to the soup mixture.  I also added fresh parsley....Delish!!!

Chicken was overcooked, and the meat itself was bland. The dish did not look good. I also did not think the cheese belonged. I will not make again.

Very yummy my whole family liked it and said I could make again.  Like some reviewers I added wine instead of water, a thin slice of ham the swiss, I omitted the butter and put an Italian grated cheese mixture on top of bread crumbs after it was almost done cooking turned up the heat to 400 and cooked for about 15 min. longer to brown alittle.  Next time I will add some pre-cooked mushrooms on top of the chicken.  We had this with mashed potatoes and green beans.

This is soooo goooood! It's easy to make. You could put a bit less butter on top and it would still be good. The whole stick of butter was almost more than enough. I've been trying several new recipes lately. My husband said this one was definitely a keeper.

I should have read the reviews before making this. It was not very good. Way too many breadcrumbs, should have melted the butter and drizzled it over instead of the pats.

Really good...was looking for another way to use up mushrooms I had left from a lasagna I made the previous night.  Husband really liked it.  I followed another review, used sherry instead of wine, sprinkled with bread crumbs and some mozzarella..really tasty and moist.

I made it tonight with a small alteration, I added white wine instead of water and seasoned the chicken with season salt.  I thought it was delicious, my husband did not like the white wine, said he tasted oranges or some thing.  He also said he would have preferred ham instead of cheese.  I say next time both! :)  I served it with BBQ Parmesan asparagus and garlic red potatoes.    I will definitely make it again.

This was really good with a few alterations.  I used cooking sherry instead of water, added an extra can of cream of mushroom soup, & used home-made bread crumbs seasoned with oregano, basil & garlic.  It was excellent served over egg noodles.  Had the leftovers tonight & it was still very tasty.  Will definitely make this again.

This is one of my most favourites, but with a little tweaking.
I sautee a ton of mushrooms with 1 large onion and 2 cloves of garlic first,  remove from pan, add chicken (which I season with salt, pepper, paprika, oregano and onion powder) and brown the chicken.  I then transfer the chicken into a baking dish, cover in mushroom/onion mixture, thickly sliced Jarlsberg cheese, and 2 cans of condensed cream of mushroom soup mixed with one (soup) can full of white wine (basically a 2:1 ratio).  I then cover that in panko crumbs, drizzle melted butter and season the top with the same seasoning I used on the chicken and bake per original recipe suggestions.  Served with rice and a light salad.
It's absolutely delicious.

Like another reviewer I use stuffing. I also cook the dish in a crock pot. Cook the chicken with the cream of mushroom soup. Shred the cooked chicken mix in the stuffing butter and shredded Swiss cheese. Let that cook for about 45 minutes or so to cook the stuffing.

Very good recipe.  Great to serve to casual dinner guests.  I made a couple of changes.  I added about 1/4 cup of frozen thawed & drained spinach and 1/8 cup of Hormel real bacon bits.  These two items added flavor and color and made the dish appear a little more elegant.  This is our new favorite way to fix chicken.

Great, an old standby, but to improve it I seared the chicken in very hot pan to get some brown color and flavor.  After that I just followed recipe, cutting to cooking time to 35 min. Also, taking foil cover off for last 5-10 min crunches the topping.

Excellent. Very easy. I took a couple of other suggestions. Sauted mushrooms, onion and a little garlic to pour over chicken. Browned chicken first. Used crushed butter crackers on top. Really good and very quick to make. Thanks for the recipe! It's a keeper.

I'm quite sure I must have done something wrong, because my chicken did not look like the picture!  It was tasty enough, but the breadcrumbs were dry in some areas and buttery in others.  The family was "eh" about this recipe so I probably won't try it again.  It was really easy to put together though...

I did as some other reviewers suggested and replaced the water with white wine and the bread crumbs with stuffing mix.  I also used cream of mushroom soup, as I really like the swiss/mushroom combo.  For layering everything in the pan, I suggest the following order: chicken, swiss cheese, stuffing mix, soup/wine mixture.  This was the second time I made this dish, and I don't know how I let so much time pass since the first one.  Delicious!

I love how simple this recipe is, especially since I haven't been cooking for very long. Although, I found 2c of bread crumbs to be overkill- so I cut it back to 1c. I've been making this one consistently for a few weeks.

My husband LOVED it and said to me that he did because it was chicken WITH SKIN (it was not). That is a compliment from him. You have to use golden mushroom soup, soooo yummy! Otherwise followed directions exactly. 5 stars for being so tasty and so easy.

Mixing white wine in place of water with the cream of chicken soup, makes this recipe even more amazing.  This is my husband's favorite of all time.  I always serve it with Jasmine rice as well.  So easy to make too:)

My family loves this recipe! I make it often even for members who don't like chicken!  I've changed it up by adding cream of mushroom soup and mushrooms, or I've changed the cheese if I don't have swiss.... it comes out great each time!

I got this recipe from a friend’s mom in 1978. It’s always been one of my favorites and now my kids love it. We’ve always used Pepperidge Farms stuffing mix instead of bread crumbs. So easy to make! Add a box of chicken flavored Rice a Roni and your favorite veggie and you’re all set!

My only changes to the recipe as written are using milk instead of water and Pepridge Farms stuffing mix.  t  It is a family favorite. So glad someone made this for me when I came home from the hospital with my twins!  I had never heard of it before then!

My husband and I love this recipe but can never get the top crunchy.  So tonight I am making the same recipe but with stuffing croutons instead of crumbs as one reviewer suggested.  Hopefully I will change my review to 5 stars!

My family loved this! So very tasty & the chicken was moist. The changes I made were: browned the chicken with coconut oil, garlic & onion. Used white cooking wine instead of water & added a can of cream of mushroom soup with the cream of chicken. Our chicken breasts were pretty big so I only did 4 & I loved all the extra sauce to dip in

followed the recipe, honestly didn't think I poured my heart n soul into this meal but I did follow the recipe to a T. It was a blahh, recipe. No taste really, chicken needed seasoning. Cook time was under, had to throw the chicken back into the oven after I butchered it in an attempt to see if it was cooked.  I think all n all, today was a bad cooking day for me, just like the weather.

This recipe is simple, delicious, and the ingredients are cheap. My fiance asks me to make this at least once a week. 
I sometimes bake stuffing in the same pan, so it soaks up the chicken juices and soup. French onions make a great topping. 
Also, I make this with chicken thighs instead of breasts. Its cheaper and more flavorful.

Love this recipe...it is quick, easy and very tasty! I sometimes add sliced mushrooms to make it a little different and always cut back on the breadcrumbs but my entire family loves this!
