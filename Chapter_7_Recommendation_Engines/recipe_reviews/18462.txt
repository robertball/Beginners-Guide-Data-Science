This was a great find, as I had no Ranch dressing for my Buffalo Chicken Salad, so I decided to make my own until the recipe called for sour cream and I didn't have that either.  I used my hand Braun mixer to whip it up and then proceeded on the the Ranch Dressing II also on this site.  THANKS for saving the day and another trip to the grocery store.  :)

thank you! I realy wanted sour cream tonight, and I wasn't about to run to the store with three wee ones. This hit the spot. It does not taste exactly like sour cream but it is creamy and tart (not to mention preaty healthy). I only added a couple T. milk and the consistancy was perfect.

I'm a big fan of this - ok, it might not be as good as sour cream.  But this is a wonderful, easy diet-friendly solution.  Thanks!

Tasted a little lemony, but not bad!  Teensy bit more runny than real sour cream.  And I used 2% milk, because I didn't have any skim.

WoW! Thanks for sharing this recipe. I was out of sour cream, and I couldn't tell the difference. I used just a little milk and added lemon to taste. My blender did a great job.

I needed sour cream for a recipe and certainly was not about to run to the store during the blizzard. Was so happy to find this and it worked out beautifully in my noodles romanov. Thank you!!

This was a pretty good sub for sour cream. On it's own, you can definitely tell it's cottage cheese with not much of a sour cream flavor (but who eats sour cream on its own anyway!), but as a topping or addition to a recipe, it's a tasty alternative.  I put it on a baked potato and really appreciated the low fat and calories. The consistency was perfect. Blend it up and let it sit for a few mins and it thickens up. Thanks for sharing your recipe Brenda!

Perfect for use as an ingredient, dont think it would be as good as a stand alone topping, unless you become accustomed to the taste of it.  Thanks for submitting, this will be a huge help in a pinch!

I’ve made this with both puréed cottage cheese and plain Greek yogurt. Both times I skipped the milk. (I never have any on hand because I don’t drink it, and I’m always trying to keep the calorie count as low as possible). By itself, I don’t think anyone would ever think it was the real thing, but when ate with something else, it is definitely a doable substitute!! I personally think the puréed cottage cheese version tastes better and has a better consistency, but the Greek yogurt version is the easiest and quickest when you’re in a hurry. I actually usually keep some in a little mason jar in my fridge, and use it quite often. Taste wise this is about 4 stars compared to the real thing, calorie and nutritionally though, it’s a definite 6-8 stars!! I Highly recommend this as a healthy low-calorie high(er) protein substitute!!

This is a wonderful option.  The lemon juice does thicken it.
