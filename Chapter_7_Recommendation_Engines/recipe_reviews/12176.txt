This pie is wonderfully tasty and creamy. I used peaches fresh from my neighbour's tree, and it was absolutely wonderful. The pie didn't set quite well in the oven, but it perfectly did after a few hours in the fridge. Just one thing: BE SURE TO USE A DEEP DISH PIE SHELL!!!

This was a big hit with my family.  It was so runny when it came out of the oven I was afraid it wouldn't set up.  After a few hours in the fridge it set up beautifully.  I'll definately make it again.

I thought it was great. weeks after I made it my uncle commented on it. Be sure to purchase a deep dish pie crust.  I am going to try it with apples, since they are in season.
Sooo.. easy.

This was really good and easy to make.  It's a bit on the rich side with so much cream.  I did not have a problem as some did with the pie turning  out soupy.  I allowed it to brown somewhat during baking and refrigerated overnight, so perhaps that helped.  I parboiled the peaches for about 30 seconds, just long enough to loosen the skins.  Made peeling and slicing go so much quicker.  Thanks, Laria!

I made this pie on a Sunday and it was gone by Tuesday morning.  I always read the reviews before I make any of these recipes.  Good thing.  I decreased the amount of cream to a 1/2 cup and I added 1 t of cornstarch to the dry mixure.  I let the pie chill for two hours before I cut into it.  This was by far the best peach pie I've ever had!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I'll be making this again and again.

I definitely agree with others that one cup of cream is just too much. I only used a quarter cup and it was still too soupy so I added in a couple of egg yolks to bind it up a bit. The nutmeg was a nice touch and so was the cinnamon I decided to use. Hard one to rate because the flavor was certainly there and everyone loved it. Thanks Laria!

This recipe was very good,I didn't use as much cream as the recipe called for and it still seemed real creamy to me, next time I will cut the cream in half, maybe use only a quarter of what it calls for.

Fabulous!  It came out of the oven pretty runny, but set perfectly after being in the fridge.  I added a little rum to the peaches, and used whole wheat flour....EXCELLENT!

I followed the instructions to the T and it came out like soup. I would say to use less cream. The flavor is great and the crust is fabulous. You can use the crust recipe for several pies.

Made this for my fiance and he said it was incredibly delicious - a five star pie. I used 1/2c of cream and the pie set beautifully as it cooled. I did not refrigerate it. I added an extra 1/4c of sugar to the peaches and about 3/4-1t. of nutmeg. A fabulous recipe I will make again!

I made a nectarine and an appple pie.  I'm not sure which one is better!  After reading the reviews I cut the cream to 1/2 cup per 10" pie.  I added a crumb top to the apple pie.  Both are very good.  So much for the diet!

I made this pie and it turned out great.  Although I thought I had heavy cream in my fridge when I started making the pie when it came down to that ingredient, I only had Half & Half so I only pour a tablespoon or two over the pie.  It still came out great so I'm thinking that the cream wasn't necessary.  I also added a few tsp of cornstarch just because of the reviews which said it didn't set well.  I let it cool a few hours and it cut fine, put it in the fridge over night and brought it to work where my coworkers devoured it.

I followed the recipe exactly, and like some others mentioned, it turned into a soupy pie...a delicicous soupy pie, but soupy none the less. The flavor was great, but it was just way too liquidy. The crust held up, however, and it gave some good texture.

It tasted decent but it looked horrible. The coloring looked unnatural. I didn't change the recipe, but it didn't work for me.

This pie was good the first night, I added a little cornstarch so the cream thickened nicely into a custardy consistency. But the next day, the crust was soooo soggy. I won’t make it again.

I did not have much luck with this recipe. I used a frozen pie shell and I think that was a mistake. After filling the pie crust as directed I could only pour in half of the heavy cream called for the consistency was not was I expected , but the flavor was good.

SO DISAPPOINTED!!! My pie was extremely soupy and runny - it never set up even though I allowed it to cool overnight in the refrigerator prior to cutting into it.  The flavor was actually nice so I will try again. Next time I will make sure my peaches and whipping cream are at room temperature, add more flour and maybe bake longer. Wish me luck!  The recipe still sounds delicious!
