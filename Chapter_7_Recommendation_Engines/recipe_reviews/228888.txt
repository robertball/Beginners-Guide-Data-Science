These are even better if you use gingersnaps instead of vanilla wafers....

These are great, but I did have to bake them for an additional 10 minutes to get the centers set.  They have a nice flavor, are perfect for portion control, and satisfied my sweet tooth!

These were awesome!  I made a gluten free version by crunching up GF honey nut chex in the bottom of the cupcake.  Absolutely delicious!  For my family we used ginger snaps instead of the vanilla wafers ( had ginger snaps handy).  I was a little concerned because everyone said it took so long to cook.  Mine took 30 minutes. The recipe did make 24 little pies (when I filled the cups up 2/3 of the way).  We have made them 3 times. Everyone that has tried them loves them... exact words- addicting little pies!

Personally, I am not a fan of pumpkin pie, so, my husband was the reviewer on this recipe.  He thought it tasted like a traditional pumpkin pie and had a nice texture.  He was not a fan of the vanilla wafer as the crust. It did take me an extra 25 minutes to cook than the recipe stated, so, I had had to babysit it every 5-6 minutes to be sure it didn't overcook.

These were not loved by us.  The cookie crust was soggy and they were a little too watery for our liking.  I did double the spices, without they would have been too bland for us.

Love! Tasted great and were easy to make!  The kids gobbled them up so fast!  Next time I will use the foil cupcake liners, though.  Super easy and super yummy!

Actually 3.5 stars....Would probably be better using a ginger snap.  The vanilla wafer was too soggy, but overall it was a good taste.

I made these today and want to thank all the reviewers for their advice. I used foil liners and baked for 40 minutes. They came out great but could use a bit more flavour. Next time I will use the spices that are usually called for in a pumpkin pie. They will be my Christmas pot-luck dessert.

We loved these, even my uber picky mother, and its going into the fall desserts rotation! I just wish the nilla wafers would've stayed "crispy" like a crust, but I'm working on that right now. :D AND I'll use the foil baking cups next time instead of the standard paper ones.

Delicious little darlings! I did have to bake them 18 minutes longer for the knife inserted in the center to come out clean, but that was easy to do. I topped these with Cool Whip and a sprinkling of cinnamon.

Delicious flavor; I added 1.5 cups of all-purpose, increased bake time to 45 mins, and replaced corn syrup with maple syrup to get a more solid pie. :)

These were ok but not spectacular. My vanilla wafers turned into soggy things that disappeared into the pies. Would have preferred some sort of crust (my husband's big complaint). I also had to give these extra cooking time.

These came out very good. The cook time does need to be adjusted in the recipe, 25 minutes was not nearly long enough. My kids have requested these for Thanksgiving!

Definitely use ginger snaps and foil liners. Comes out much better. Needed to increase bake time by 20 minutes to get centers to set. Top with cinnamon whipped cream. Really good.

I make mini cheesecakes with vanilla wafers. Have used regular cup liners when I don't have foil. Much better in foil.  Wafer doesn't get nearly as soggy. Just an FYI

Tasty and easy to make!  Even my hubby, who's never been a fan of pumpkin pie, enjoyed this!  My only complaint is they needed to cook longer than specified, about 10 minutes or so.  Using paper cups resulted in a rather wet cup so you may want to reach for foil liners.  Will absolutely make these again!

These turned out good, but I put the oven temperature up to 325, then baked for about an hour, to get the centers set.  And I used ginger snaps with foil liners like several of the reviewers suggested.  I made them for my husband's poker group, for an easy-to-eat dessert.

My family loves these! I did use gingersnaps for the crust and the tinfoil cupcake holders.  I also added 1 tsp of vanilla and cinnamon and ginger.  I also substituted honey for the Karo syrup.

Took way too long to bake. Twice as long as recipe states. Flavor was mundane but the concept is a keeper. I am going to try to tweak this more.  I liked one reviewers idea of using maple syrup

I had to cook these an additonal 10 minutes, they were not a huge hit as expected. cups needed to be filled more than 3/4 of the way. the vanilla wafers must have shrank with the enco crunch as they did not fill the bottum of the cup. i would not recommend this recipe.

Watery filling... I opted out on the crust to make a gluten free version. A little bit too spicy, tasted a lot better with whipped cream on top.

I just finished makeing these. They were just OK. The waffer became soggy and the cup cake liner was sticky on the bottom.If I were to make them again I would use the foil liner.More bakeing time was needed to get the center to set.

I made this recipe as part of this month's Allstar Challenge.  I followed the recipe exactly, while I thought these were ok ~ they just was'nt oustanding.  I think If I was to make again, I would double the wafer base.

These little pies are addictive!  They didn't last long in my house.  They actually took twice as long to bake but it was well worth the wait.
The only thing I think I wish I had done was make them in ramekins instead of the paper cups because they seeped through the paper and made them sticky to handle.  Other than that, they were delicious!  I will be making these again.

I made these today.Delicious. There is an error in the directions. The
cooking times should be 50 minutes as stated above in the Cook Time, not 25 minutes. My vanilla wafers floated to the top on mine.

So much better than a whole pie!!  It’s great to have a bite sized dessert for the holidays.  I prefer ginger snaps to vanilla wafers and I didn’t have pumpkin pie spice so I used ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg and clove from a pie recipe.  I got 5star ratings from my coworkers!

Substituted real maple syrup for corn syrup, which was a mistake because it made the batter too runny.  Good flavor, but ended up soggy despite 40 minute cooking time.  Vanilla wafer floated to the top so no bottom crust.

Rave reviews received!  Instead of 3 tsp of pumpkin pie spice, I used 1.5 tsp cinnamon, 3/8 tsp nutmeg, 3/8 tsp ground cloves, 3/4 tsp ground ginger.  I used foil muffin cups, the Nilla wafers did get soggy so the and next time I will replace the Nilla wafers with ginger snap cookies.  I will definitely make these again!

We used ginger snaps, and I substituted the Karo syrup for sugar and water. Had to cook longer but super good flavor and the ginger snap wasn't too soggy. Mmmm mmm for portion controlled pumpkin pie!

Great idea and my family enjoyed them. I would however make a couple changes next time. I would do like the others say and use the foil cups, these are dense and the foil would have been a better fit. I also had to cook these for almost twice as long as called for, which means you are babysitting and checking them every 5 minutes until they are right. But it was worth it!

These came out great and just what was needed for a large luncheon.  I had to extend the bake time-but that's typical for pumpkin pies! Definately need to use foil liners!

Great flavor. Wafer was very soggy though and that was disappointing.
