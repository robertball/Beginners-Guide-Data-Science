The pot is still on the stove and I'm already a 5 year old back in Scranton. Just the smell takes me back 60 years. This recipe is about as authentic, back in the day, Moms home cookin' as I've ever tasted!(Confirmed by in process tastings, eaten almost 1/3 already)
To TOONIES, thanks for the recipe and the memories!!
If you're from anywhere from Scranton through the "Rust Belt", make this tonight!

I'm not sure, but I think you have to be from pennsylvania to know what a Whimpie is!! Not unlike a Sloppy Joe a whimpie has a bit more veggies and a nice homemade sauce. I had to deviate a bit when I discovered a lack of ketchup, but not to worry, tomato paste, a little more brown sugar and seasonings and I was all set.

This had a wonderful flavor! I like that it has all the veggies in it also. I thought it would be thicker in consistency; used a slotted spoon. The recipe does not specify to drain the grease off the meat before adding the rest of the ingredients, but I would suggest it.

I'm anxious to try this recipe. Whimpies were always a staple sandwich served at most church & club functions in Indiana. Nobody had heard of a "Whimpie Sandwich" when I moved away from Indiana.

Slightly different change from your standard sloppy joe.  We enjoyed as a chance of pace.  I used apple cider vinegar.
