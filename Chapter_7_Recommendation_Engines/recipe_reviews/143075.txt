Ahhh Rollkuchen.  Rollkuchen und erbooze ( Rollkucken and watermelon)   2 quick wee notes. If you make them by hand as  is the above recipe , well,  most Mennonites still use lard or crisco to fry them in. I use the Butter flavoured Crisco. The solid type, not the oil, and the flavour is marvelous. As well , in a pinch,  I've substituted a cans of  "Grands " biscuits , any type, and rolled each  biscuit out , with your  roller,  then cut the same wee slit in the middle of the dough, and turned bottom under top, of slit.   Again fantastic, and super easy for those who are a wee bit timid around making a dough. White corn syrup is the trick, and I warm it up a wee bit, as well, but maple syrup and jelly is great as well.  I truly believe the key to the perfect Rollkucken is the Butter Crisco. 
            As for the watermelon,  it truly  goes well with it . I put me watermelon  chilled , in a glass, with  corn syrup and Vodka.   What can I say?  I'm a modern Mennonite. Plus I've been cooking all day.  I deserve it.  Cheers to all and GOD bless.   From NV

I come from a Mennonite family. I love RollKuchen! Our favorite way to enjoy them is dipped in jam (any flavour) or corn syrup. Thank you for sharing a part of mennonite cuisine with the world :)

I just love Rollkuchen and hadn't made it in years.  When in Belize we ordered fry jacks and to my pleasure it was what they called Rollkuchen so every morning for breakfast I had that with watermelon for breakfast.

These are very close to the ones my mom used to make when I was a kid!  I haven't had them in years!  I don't know if anyone else ever did this but we used to dip them in white vinegar mixed into a paste with sugar.  I know it sounds wierd but my mouth is watering just thinking about it!!  Yum!
