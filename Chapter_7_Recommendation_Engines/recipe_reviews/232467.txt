Yummy!  If you like Butterfingers this is the cookie for you.  They are crispy (just the way I like a cookie) and sweet.  Great with milk or a cup of hot tea.  I did use less candy than what it calls for.  About 8 less bars (snack size) and they turned out perfectly fine.  Coworkers LOVED them - one told me they were the best cookie he ever had.

My family loved this cookie. It is soft and chewy. They taste like sugar cookies with a twist.

I can't eat butterfingers, so I made them without the butterfingers, so it tasted like a sugar cookie, still good though.

The recipe did turn out a bit dry but I added another egg white and it comes out perfectly.

You can also use four regular size bars of Butterfinger instead of the bites.  It's much easier and less time consuming.

Second time was the charm for me.  On my first attempt, I didnt't beat the sugar and butter long enough, over-crushed the Butterfingers and scooped the batter into waaaaay to big portions. They turned out like frisbees with Butterfinger pixie dust mixed in.
Easing up on the "pulse" button, beating the sugar and butter thoroughly and using a teaspoon instead of a tablespoon to scoop the batter did the trick. A hit with the kids and grown-ups!

Tastes great!  Made as per the recipe, but I bake my cookies on parchment paper.  They were fine.  I baked for only 9 minutes

This recipe was a huge hit! I bake quite a bit of cookies, and this will definitely be one of my go-to's. I'm not really sure what some people had an issue with this cookie. I made it as recipe stated. The only thing I did was put it in the fridge while cookies were baking so the batter wouldn't get too warm.

Dry batter, had to scoop and form together.  I had all the ingredients in so don`t know why they turned out dry.  Not much taste will probably use toll house recipe then add buterfinger.
