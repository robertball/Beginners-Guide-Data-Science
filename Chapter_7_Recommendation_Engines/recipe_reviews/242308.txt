I used a mini-doughnut pan, and the piping bag really is the way to go (if you have one).  My doughnuts were cooked at 9 minutes, so start checking early.  I know oven temps vary, but  these are small, and it wouldn't take much for them to overbake and dry out.  I wondered if the sugar mixture would stick, since many other recipes call for you to first dip them in melted butter...well, it did!  I would think coating them while the muffins are still warm is key,  since they still have a little moisture on the outside, still steaming a bit.  Thanks, authenticnut, we enjoyed your mini doughnuts!

Definitely a keeper.  My boys loved it.  It was so easy to make.  I made one batch that didn't last the afternoon with my boys.  I did it exactly as directed.  My oldest loved it and the little one really liked it.  After first batch was gone, they begged me to make a second batch the same day.  I did.  What can I say...they are that easy to make.  The second batch, however, I played around with.  I added applesauce in place of some of the butter.  I doubled the recipe, so I used one of those individual sized applesauce with 2 tablespoons of butter instead, and I left the nutmeg amount the same at about a 1/4 teaspoon or less.  The nutmeg flavor was really strong in the first batch for my liking.  So with the changes made, and the house smelling wonderfully good after baking the second batch, I let my biggest food critics try them out.  Guess what they loved these even more, although they seemed more cake like and not so flaky.  One tray went the same night and the next tray was gone within 2 days.  A keeper for sure.

Hands down, These are the lightest donuts I've ever eaten.  Used the 3 tbs applesauce for 3 tbs butter sub and it turned out well. I piped the mix onto the mini donut tray using a sandwich baggie.  I didn't want to scratch my new nonstick mini donut pan, so I used a plastic spoon to loosen the donuts for removal. I didn't apply spray or oil on the pan before adding the mix and there was slight residue to clean up prior to baking the next pan. No problem!  The cinn/sugar stuck just fine.  Recipe makes @ 45 mini donuts.

I made these for my girls. And they loved them. I used cinnamon instead of nutmeg this time. I also skipped the cinnamon sugar coating and used confectionery sugar glaze with festive toppings. Somewhere there is a picture on allrecipe. Love the recipe. The recipe as is makes about 6 servings (donuts) in my baking donut shaped pans. I doubled the recipe and got 12 over sized donuts. Would NOT change any of the main ingredients or portions. I will definitely try this recipe again and again. I like using this as a base and mixing up the flavor.  Followed the oven temp also at 350. Thanks to whom ever shared the original recipe!

Good base recipe.  I thought they were slightly sweet and that was plain without the cinnamon and sugar coating.

I also omitted the nutmeg.
But they had a nice buttery flavor, and they were light and fluffy.

I used the Mini Donut Maker which made 6 donuts at a time at a 4 minute baking time.   The batch made 32 mini donuts.

I would definitely use this recipe again, perhaps cutting back the sugar slightly since I really wanted to add a glaze instead of a dry sugar coating.

Tastes great. I used coconut brown sugar instead of just regular sugar. I'm very impressed by the results and the final product.

They came out alright, do not know if my baking powder might be a little old or what but they really didn't get very big and texture isn't really what you think of when you think cake doughnuts. Taste was good though

Made the recipe to a T and everyone adored them. I made them with a vanilla glaze though, and they were perfect! My only issue was the cook time, My doughnuts took nearly 30 min in the oven. So I'm not sure if it is just a finicky recipe for cook times or if my oven is on the fritz!

I made these using all purpose gluten free flour mix and egg replacer since my family has food allergies and they were a huge hit!  I was also out of baking powder but was craving donuts so bad I made them any way and used baking soda in place of the powder.  Worked fine.  Great recipe.

Very fast, easy to make donuts that are really fluff. They could use a little more flavor and the nutmeg is perfect how it is at 1/4 a tsp. Also considering using a Wilton donut pan to make them but it was very good overall!

I purchased a mini donut pan with the express purpose of making blueberry Donuts but I could not find a recipe that lent itself to the mini pans so I decided to try this one instead. I followed the recipe as it was and found that the donuts were just fine. I had enough for at least 30 mini donuts and a Piping Bag was necessary to get the batter into the pan properly. The donut makes a nice cake doughnut and is particularly good when just out of the oven. I had everything on hand to make these donuts without purchasing anything special but they could have been improved with powdered sugar glaze or some kind of citrus base and zest. Perhaps a little extra sugar and cocoa powder would have done as well.

This was our first attempt at baked donuts.  We enjoyed them so much, we made a batch of chocolate donuts next.  We didn't have a piping bag -- it probably would be worth it to put it in a plastic bag and snip off the end.  The batter is thick and getting it into the mold is a little tedious.  But that's my only semi-negative thought.  We found the recipe in the AllRecipes magazine (Feb/Mar 2016).

Amazing recipe! Totally impressed my family + friend! I found that you can make a good version of these by taking out the cinnamon altogether from the recipe and making a 1/3-2/3 of a cup of sugar + 1 tablespoon of powdered sugar mixture to use as a coating for the donuts. However, the original recipe is delicious too.

This tape did not work for me. I doubled this recipe and used a regular sized donut pan. I'm not sir what went wrong, but it seems like too much butter possibly. I sprayed the pans, but they are still sticking. the m The taste is good even if they are a mess.

What a great, simple recipe!  I used vanilla bean paste for a but of a richer vanilla flavour.  rolled some in the cinnamon sugar and put a basic glaze on others.  Worked wonderfully!  
I did take others' advice and doubled the recipe to make 12 small doughnuts.

I made this exactly as it is, using the same ingredients. The donuts were very cake like and a tad bit dry. In the future I would maybe try switching the milk with buttermilk and adding a tad bit more sugar to the recipe. Overall it was ok and the kids and family liked it enough. There were a few donuts left over, which never usually happens with baked goods in my house so I know they could be better

I agree with another reviewer who said they were good but more like a cupcake.   I tried piping into the muffin pan but it just spread out over the bottom.  To make it more confusing, the recipe says to fill 2/3 full, and also to see if it's done insert a toothpick in the centre.  Last time I had a donut there was no centre!  As a cupcake they were OK, but will probably try a different recipe next time.  My husband laughed his head off when he saw my donuts come out of the oven :)

love this recipe!  so easy to make and so delicious.  I dogleg the batch and used 2 tablespoons of butter and added unsweetened apple sauce in place of the rest of the butter.  I also used my cast iron doughnut panand baked in the oven for 10 minutes.

To cut down on the amount of fat,  I changed it to: 2T of butter and 3T of applesauce. Still delicious and moist.

Really good, came out more like mini muffins though (perhaps my small cupcake pan is too small).  This recipe made 18 pieces.

These are light, tender, and tasty!  The dough is odd since the butter doesn't quite blend together and it seems rather lumpy even after adding flour but once baked these are wonderful!  FYI - one batch of dough makes one pan of mini-doughnuts.  Thanks for sharing!

I love this recipe! I've make it a ton of times, sometimes when I have a chocolate craving I add a tablespoon of coco powder! But it's always delightful.

Next time I will double the recipe because they did not last long! One thing I may change within the recipe for next time is the amount of nutmeg. I feel like it was a little too strong for a simple baked donut.

Very good and easy to make! These have a bit of a crunch to them on the outside. I did not use cinnamon/sugar on outside since it was requested by my kids’ teacher to bring “plain” donuts. Also, mine only took 17 min to bake using a mini donut pan. This makes about 12 mini donuts. I also used my decorator tool which was a very helpful tip since the dough is thicker. Thanks!

We thought they were very tasty. Made them with my 9 year old. We piped them around the edges inside the mini muffin cup but they ended up coming together like muffins! Oh well!

I made this recipe with two non-stick mini-donut baking pans; I filled all but one of the 24 containers. I brushed vegetable oil into each container, including the top of the little round center. I baked them for 10 minutes. Most of them came out of the pans pretty easily by just turning the pans upside down and banging the edge on the counter a couple times.

All in all, I was quite pleased! I'm a huge fan of county fair mini-donut stands, and realized this morning that I can make better-looking, more healthful, and equally good-tasting ones at home with this recipe and my mini-donut pans!

YUM!!! I substituted apple sauce for the egg and it seems to work well. Followed the rest of the recipe to at T but did use brown sugar instead of white granular for the topping. Delicious! I will cook them a couple of minutes longer next time.

The doughnut was dry with just the cinnamon sugar. The bread tasted ok. Not very sweet, but not very bland. I think to counter the dryness, I'd go ahead and try using an actual glaze.

this recipe did not work for me.  they took 15 minutes to cook and did not taste or look anything like doughnuts.
