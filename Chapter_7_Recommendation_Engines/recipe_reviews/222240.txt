All I had to put in my bean salad was beans and onions, so this recipe was perfect. I used fresh cooked Italian Mixed Beans. Used Cider Vinegar and omitted other vinegars, forgot the garlic, and only used fresh dehydrated Oregano and Italian Parsley from my garden. 

I know it's dumb to review a recipe you fully changed, but I just needed this recipe as a base to let me know it was ok to make bean salad with no other veggies. So I combined the cider vinegar parts of other recipes with the simpleness of this one. Thanks, Bob!

The balsamic gave the salad a mellower taste than I am used to with this recipe and I wouldn't say the difference was a positive one. Balsamic is pretty expensive and I feel I wasted the subtle flavor on a mediocre salad. Additionally, I think the measurements may be off; the beans were swimming in the marinade.

Liked very much. Easy and with ingredients available in my pantry :). I did get creative and instead of the balsamic vinegar I used red wine vinegar, 2 teaspoons of fresh lemon juice, red onion, black pepper, 2 stalks of celery and few cilantro stems. Delicioso!

I cut the recipe in half to feed four and substituted white beans for the garbanzo beans. I used plain white distilled vinegar instead of rice wine vinegar also increased the sugar by a small amount and added cracked ground pepper. Thanks for the great recipe...it's delicious!

Decent recipe. Not that it wasn't good, we just aren't huge bean salad fans (made for a party). No one disliked it, so will keep in my file

This was my first ever attempt at a Three Bean Salad-and it was a huge hit for Thanksgiving! I did use a little more Olive Oil as the recipe suggested to add more to taste. I will keep this one for sure!!!

Reminds me of the Bean Salad my mom used to make! I did cut the amount of the vinegars in half as 2 cups in total seemed like a lot for only 3 cans of beans. I will be making this again.

I liked the recipe but it called for much too much vinegar. I think i put in half as much. My husband didn't care for the onions, but I liked them. Next time I will just grate them.

Cut liquid in half!  Way too much!  I cut recipe in half, and  even 1/2 will feed 8-10 as a side .  Will not make again.

I think that it turned out great.  I made a few modifications which worked for me.  I used white basaltic vinegar and seasoned rice vinegar.  I made the recipe for 4 but added a can of wax beans as well.  Excellent healthy side dish!

I will not make this recipe again.  I do love balsamic vinegar and had all ingredients on hand and made 1/2 the recipe exactly as written.  All I could taste was vinegar.   I tried to doctor it up with more sugar,  a little more oil,  a little salt, a little pepper.  I finally drained off the marinade and will at least save the beans with my go-to dressing for bean salad.  Looks like many people like this, but I did not.   Guess I am used to a sweeter bean salad.

Made as directed, and it was okay.  A little potent on the vinegar side for my taste. I feel it would be real good on top of a bed of lettuce or something.

The balsamic vinegar was overpowering! I could barely choke down one serving, and nobody wanted to eat the leftovers. 

That being said... I gave it 4 stars cuz this recipe is a good starting point for me. It has potential, and I'll make it again with significant changes.

I have made this several times, and keep coming back to it.  I like a less sweet taste, so I cut the sugar in half, and use Creole Seasoning in place of the salt.  As with others, I sprinkle 1/2 tsp of ground black pepper, and add a few shakes of Worcestershire sauce for the tangy flavor I like.  It's a good one!

I made this because I was curious about the flavour of the balsamic vinegar in a bean salad.  It was superb!
I did add the feta and it made it so yummy.  I had some left over so i put it in the Ninja and made bean dip out of it and ate it with carrots.  Brilliant.  I will definately be making this over and over.

This recipe is exactly what I was trying to replicate from a 3 bean salad I got from a local deli. I already had all the ingredients and it was super easy to make. I will be making this a LOT from now on. The only thing I added was some freshly ground black pepper (I add that to pretty much everything). Thank you for this awesome recipe!!

Too much vinegar for our taste.  Had to add some splenda.
