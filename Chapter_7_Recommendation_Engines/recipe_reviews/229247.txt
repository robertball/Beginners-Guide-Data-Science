We enjoyed these enchiladas, like someone else said, Italian and Mexican all rolled up in one. I had fresh spinach so just waited until the end of the cooking and tossed handfuls in and just wilted it. I had to use half green and half red sauce on top since I accidentally picked up two different kinds. Thanks Duboo.

Excellent!! I added green peppers and mushrooms to the mix as well.  I couldn't find the enchilada sauce in the grocery store, so I used pasta sauce instead.

What a terrific way to marry Italian and Mexican. Great recipe. Wouldn't change a thing, except that I would recommend greasing the baking dish. We actually got 6 enchiladas in this batch. I made 3 with hot enchilada sauce and 3 mild.  I also put some sauce on the bottom of the baking dish before I put the enchiladas in. Thanks Duboo for a great recipe!

My husband and I really enjoyed this unique enchilada idea. Spice was right where I like it, a bit of a kick but not "hot."

I loved it.  We added some red peppers, upped the onion and garlic a bit, as well as using fresh spinach. It was so good we already plan to have it again next week. It will be one of my new "best dishes."
Thank you!

I love this enchilada filler it is very very good... I use my own homemade enchilada sauce and this came out amazing..! Though I did kind of messed up because I was too scared of the whole amount of spinach and I put less which next time I will put the full amount but overall it is amazing.. I would suggest though to put at least like a tablespoon or two of the enchilada sauce with the chicken so there's a little bit of that flavor inside of the enchiladas..

I made a few substitutions for what we had: cottage cheese for ricotta, 8oz pork carnitas for the chicken, sweet onion for the green onion (1/2 the amount), and homemade sauce.  The salsa verde I had was fresh so needed something to smooth it out, it was also a little heavy on the garlic so I didn't use additional. I used fresh spinach(1/2 tub) and just chopped it and mixed in with the cheese mixture along with the onions. I added everything to the tortillas (8 in) cold and tossed it in the oven for 25 minutes. It sounds like a ton of changes but in my head it's only a couple. We got 4 servings but I didn't measure too carefully.

Very good.  Used olive oil instead of butter.  I added fresh Bella mushrooms and fresh spinach.  Used chicken thighs since they were on sale.  Also added a can of chopped chiles. The store didn't have green onions so I I chopped up a sweet yellow onion instead. Used a dozen regular size tortillas instead of 5 big ones.  Used green enchilada sauce.

Awesome enchiladas!  I used a whole lot of fresh sauteed spinach (in lieu of frozen) - there's just no comparison.  While preparing the sour cream/ricotta/chicken mixture, I kept thinking green enchilada sauce would be better a fit,  but I stuck to the recipe and used red, and the taste was outstanding!  The flavor is deep, earthy, and extremely satisfying.   So glad I stumbled upon this little gem ;)

Made these with a lb of bonless chicken breast that I oven baked first. I also used taco seasoned cheese with mozarella because it was easy to find. I was nervous of the amount of spinach but went with it. Coated the inside of the tortilla with sauce amd stuffed. My filling made six generously stuffed and filled the 9x13. The amount of sauce was fantastic and everything was very yummy. This is a great recipe!

I used fresh spinach, one of those 8 ounce bags from the store. And I cooked the chicken with the onions and garlic.  When the chicken was just about ready I put in the spinach together and gave it like 3-5 minutes, stirring constantly. Excellent. My husband loves vegetables, so he was so happy about a whole bag of spinach in this

I made this with ground turkey breast that I saut√©ed and crumbled with the onions and garlic and tossed in a couple handfuls of fresh spinach. The cheesy filling is very nice topped with a good enchilada sauce. I‚Äôll definitely make it again. I may add a little cooked, crumbled bacon to the filling next time.

Delicious! I made it just how it said except I put half a can of enchilada sauce in the chicken/spinach/cheese mix and another half a can in the pan before putting the tortillas in. Then, I poured the other can over the top of the tortillas. The recipe says it makes 5 enchiladas, but I had enough filling for 8!

Note that the cooking time does not include cooking the chicken, so it will take longer if you're starting with raw chicken (there's really nothing to prepare until the chicken is cooked).

My family really enjoyed this and asked for it to be in the "rotation." A high honor! I am always looking for recipes to make relatively quickly after work, and this one worked well. I bought already cooked and seasoned (lemon and garlic) chicken breasts from Wegmans and just diced them up. My mom and daughter are not big spinach fans, so I substituted diced peppers and onions (pre-chopped, again from Wegmans). Huge time savers although certainly not money savers.I'm sure the spinach would be awesome too. I was just trying to please the crowd. GOOD advice from someone who said to spray the bottom of the pan (duh!). I did not, but will next time! We really enjoyed this.

This recipe gave me a great start for our meal. I added fresh chopped spinach to my hot chicken mix. Since I did not have ricotta cheese in the house, I used an immersion  blender on my cottage cheese, sour cream mixture to give it a smooth texture. I used cheddar cheese in place of the colby. The rest of the recipe I followed and ended up with a great meal. Refried beans and rice completed our meal. I will definitely make these again.

I improvised a bit, as I usually do, but not much and my family loved them!

Really, really good.   I followed all directions as written.  I might try using fresh spinach next time.  The hubby gave it 2 thumbs up, so this recipe is a keeper!

I used 1 bag fresh spinach, other than that followed the recipe. Great recipe. Have already passed it along.

I made the recipe, it was delicious, but made a few modifications. Used about  1/2 c cottage cheese instead of ricotta, because that is what I had, used regular white onion instead of scallions, used Mexican blend cheese and to make them somewhat low-carb wrapped them in cabbage leaves (that were boiled for two minutes) instead of tortillas. These "enchiladas" were just superb!
