Only 5 cups of liquid for 16 ounces of barley!  After this was in the slow cooker for just a short time the barley had absorbed all of the liquid and the whole mixture was dry!  I added 5 cups of water just to cover the mixture and it still turned out having the texture of oatmeal or thick mashed potatoes.  There was very little flavor, as well.  I was able to improve that with an additional teaspoon of salt, 2 teaspoons of woprcestershire sauce and a teaspoon of dried thyme, but it was just glop and not at all like soup.

There is something terribly wrong with this soup.  When you cook a pound of barley it requires a lot more liquid than 5 cups.  I followed the recipe as ordered.  When I checked the crockpot four hours later ALL the broth had been absorbed.  I needed to add 5+ cups of water to get close to soup.  There was almost no room in the pot for anything else.  The ground beef was a good idea.

This rating is with my modifications. Thanks to those who rated before, I didn't make the same mistakes. I used twice the amount of broth and only 3\4 cup of barley. I also added more spices, about 1\4 tsp tarragon leaves, 2 tsp garlic salt and a sprinkle of Mrs. Dash. It was a good idea for a recipe just needed a little help.

This came out great. I did add an extra 3 cups of liquid and downed the barley to 1 cup. My family won't eat mushrooms so I omitted them and added one diced carrot and one diced potato. I did not add in the optional cream or green beans. Thanks for a great recipe!

After reading the reviews I still wanted to make this, but I took into account many of their suggestions. We dropped the barley to 1 cup.  We bloomed celery, onions, garlic, Worcestershire, Tarragon, and Rosemary in with the Ground Beef to bring out its flavor.

I turned into a good porridge and with a few more tweaks will probably make it into our cycle.

I cut the pepper in half and it was still a bit too much for me.  I put in a TON of mushrooms 'cause I love 'em but I feel like it still needs something else.. I'll definitely make it again & I'll figure out the missing ingredient for my taste buds!!
