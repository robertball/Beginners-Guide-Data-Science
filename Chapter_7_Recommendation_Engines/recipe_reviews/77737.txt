Oh! Panellets!
They can be costumized with other ingredients, as you will see in any Catalan confectionary around November 1. Try adding some espresso to the dough and not covering them in anything. Or substitute the almonds for grated coconut... Mmmmm...

The soft texture the potato gives makes it so much more succulent. Ive seen a few recipes for a mostly almond based panellet, but Ive worked in Catulunya making these treats and other catalan specialties and we used mostly potato in a recipe similar to this. And they were delicious.
