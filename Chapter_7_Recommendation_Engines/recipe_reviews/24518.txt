These are the best cinnamon buns we have ever had!!  My family cannot get enough.  The only adjustments I've made are reducing the flour to 4 cups and doubling the yellow cake mix to 18 oz.  This makes the dough a little sweeter.  They are to die for.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

Great recipe!  Made the following changes after reading the reviews... used 2 cup water, the entire pkg. of cake mix; reduced the flour to 4 cups, and increased the vanilla extract to 2 tsps just for added flavor.  Recipe turned out great!  My family was in awe since this was my very first batch of cinnamon rolls to ever bake that didn't come from a can! I also used Janni's recipe for Cream Cheese Frosting II to top these just because we love cream cheese!  Thanks again for a great recipe, this is definitely a keeper!

These cinnamon rolls were great.  I put everything in my bread maker and ran the dough cycle.  When the cycle was finished I rolled them out and followed the recipe except for adding brown sugar instead of white sugar.   I have tried other recipes before and these are the best ones I've ever made.  They were a big hit!

Very good.  Tastes almost as good at the amish cinnamon rolls that are popular here.

This was the first time I'd attempted cinnamon rolls, and what a great way to start! Simple to make and far too easy to eat...! 
The frosting is by far the best I've ever tasted; quite sweet, but delicious. My only complaint was that there wasn't a ton of cinnamon flavour, and no drippy, gooey cinnamon-sugar concoction oozing from the rolls (my favourite part!). I'll definitely use the recipe for the dough and for the icing, but will probably tweak the cinnamon-sugar mixture by using about 2 to 2 1/2 cups of  brown sugar in place of the white and increasing the cinnamon significantly as well.
Beyond that, these were excellent! Thanks, Jamie.

I've made these cinnamon rolls several times. They are easy and delicious. I usually leave them in the oven overnight and bake them in the morning. I like to top them with a cream cheese frosting and walnuts. Delicious!

I followed the recipe to a tee, BUT I let it rise once, then covered and put the dough in the fridge til morning. In the morning I took out of refridgerator and let it rest at room temp. for 1/2 hour before assembly.  It worked ~ thank goodness, they were yummy and we will definately make them again.  I must have messed up the frosting cuz it was way too thick (but still way too yummy).

Everything about the recipe was great....it's just that it says the prep time is 1 minute.  Well, from reading the directions you can already tell there is no way you can do all that in one minute.  So next time, THINK ABOUT IT!!

Everyone gave this one lots of stars but I guess I went wrong somehow with this one. My dough was really sticky so had a rough time rolling it out. I'm thinking maybe the cake mix I picked was too moist. I had to add so much flour to get the dough to roll until I think it too away from the flavor. I don't work with dough/yeast much so hopefully next time I can tweak the recipe and it will come out better.

This recipe is a staple in our home as well as for my moms group.  People beg me to make them.  I've made a few changes 1)I use the an 18 oz cake mix.  I always use the butter recipe cake mix.  I'm not sure if this makes a difference or not.  Using the 18 oz cake mix seems to make the dough slower in rising.  The dough is sticky, but I don't mind although you can add an extra cup of flour. 2) I double the filling and use half brown sugar and half white sugar. 3) I bake them for 16 minutes so that are a big doughy, but that is just what we like. 4) We make the frosting into a glaze and a but on the buttery side.  I make the recipe by taste so I can't really tell you the changes, but they are super yummy!

These were really good. If I had to grade them on a scale of 10 it would be a 6.5. After having the Soft, Moist, and Gooey Cinnamon Buns recipe on here though these didn't quite shine. I do appreciate the fact they didn't need eggs. And I firmly believe any cinnamon roll should only be iced with a cream cheese frosting. Overall, worth the time and effort.

Excellent but take time so plan ahead.  I added finely chopped pecans in the roll and sprinkled on top of frosting.  I also added a drop of orange oil to half the frosting and tried both...yum!

Wow - defintely GOOD. Instead of wasting half a box of cake mix, because a normal box of cake mix has 18 oz in it, my friend and I just used the entire box. The dough was a bit sticky at the end, but a little flour for dusting and rolling fixed that :o) We also added more cinnamon, and I used my own cream cheese frosting recipe for the top and if finished it off well! Way Good! I'll definitely make these again, but I'm hoping to try a recipe w/o a cake mix as I'm trying to make everything from scratch with the least amount of preseratives and extra junk.

I think I must have done something wrong.  These were okay, but a little dry.  I used a buttery cake mix, but I still think they were too dry.  I used the cream cheese icing, and that was the only thing that saved them.  Any ideas about why mine were so dry?  I followed the recipe except for using brown sugar instead of white.

This recipe turned out great on the 1st try. I did have to add a little extra flour to make the dough less sticky and easier to roll out. The texture of the rolls is perfect and they taste really good!  I used the recipe frosting, but next time I will make a butter cream so that it tastes more like a Cinnabon.  I would  prefer more cinnamon/sugar but that's just because I LOVE cinnamon.  This was a nice recipe to let the kids help with too.

I halved the recipe and used pineapple cake mix as an alternative. I followed the directions exactly just like it was yellow cake mix. I added some nuts and cubes of fresh apples to make something like "apple pineapple Cinnamon rolls" ^__^..And know what?? It still turned out wonderful!!!  Thank you so much for the recipe.

i just made these tonight to put out during the OU/Mizzou game...They are amazing!!! I didn't notice the recipe called for only 1/2 box of cake mix and I used the whole thing..oops:)Also only had white cake mix so I used it.. The dough was sticky, but just made sure to flour my counter top liberally and there was no problem! I cut the dough into 2 inch slices and ended up with 16 rolls that baked up very thick and gooey! Just what I wanted! The other changes I made were for the filling: 1 cup brown sugar, 2 Tbsp cinnamon and 1/3c butter and for the frosting: 3oz cream cheese, 1/4c butter, 1+1/4c powdered sugar, 1/2tsp vanilla and 1 tsp salt.
This recipe is a keeper!!!

If you are accustomed to a bisquick taste? Then this is the recipe for you! Easy to make, but ughh.... If you want this taste, buy a box of bisquick and add cinnamon and sugar to it. You will get the same taste.

These really did turn out as wonderful as other reviewers have said.  I doubled the filling and used brown sugar.  I also added walnuts and raisins.  They turned out just liked grandma's.

I took these to work this morning, and they were all gone in 10 minutes.

The texture of these cinnamon rolls is very unique-- it has some of the qualities of a yeast bread (slightly resilient with a yeast bread flavor), but it is also cakey at the same time.  I suspect that the leavening ingredients in the cake mix contribute to this...  They rise in two ways-- from the yeast, and also from the baking powder in the mix.  The closest thing to which I can liken the texture is the packaged honey-buns that are available at grocery and convenience stores.  Anyway, these went over very well at work, and I'll definitely make them again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent recipe, I used the 18oz box of pudding cake mix and reduced the water to 2 cups.  if you want taller buns place the buns on the pan close together and they will rise up not out.

These turned out fantastic! I followed the recipe exactly except for the cooking time, they took 25 minutes, but I have a natural gas oven. These are light and fluffy, and with no eggs they are great for my son, who is allergic to eggs.

the whole family LOVES these, kind of Sweeter than I'm used to, I added 1 cup brown sugar and half cup white sugar to make the cinnamon mixture, and it was PERFECT! May try cream cheese frosting next time, as this frosting was extremely sweet! Had to cook closer to half hour, but DELICIOUS!!!! Definetely will be making again!

Really good. I used the whole box of cake mix (18 oz) and a little less flour. 
Im going to use this dough for caramel pecan rolls too.

These are the best cinnamon rolls I have had . They compare to the Entenmann's that I often can't find in the store.  Love the ease of them  when it is time for our family brunch these are gone first, people always ask for more. I came back cause I lost my copy to review for the people who are having the concern of lack of cinnamon add cinnamon to your batter as well as increase it to a tbsp  with the melted butter and sugar it will still taste great!

These taste wonderful!  I've never made cinnamon rolls before and was pleasantly surprised at how easy this recipe is.  I did use brown sugar instead of the granulated sugar but that is just because of taste preferences.  The only mistake I made was I put one on a plate, went to get a cup of coffee, came back and my roll was gone!  My yellow lab helped herself to it and was licking her lips when I saw what she had done.  These rolls are light and the frosting is just right.  Thank you for this recipe.  It's a keeper and the rest of my rolls are safely put away now.

I made a 1/2 recipe and added 2 Tbsp brown sugar, 1 egg and 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the dough. Once I got it to rise (needed a warmer place, so I used a heat lamp), the texture turned out very well - soft and light but with more chew than cake. While the dough was rising it tasted so good I could not resist pinching off bits to eat, but the flavor of the finished dough was very bland. Despite adding extra cinnamon to the filling as well, the rolls by themselves were not very flavorful. With frosting, there is enough sweetness, but next time I might double the cinnamon filling.

I made these scrumptious rolls for our bible study class, and everyone went wild!!  I actually made 2 recipes, one I followed the recipe exactly, and the other one I sprinkled butter, brown sugar and chopped pecans on the bottom of the rolls and then flipped them as soon as they came out of the oven. Amazing!.....After making these rolls a few times, I've tweeked them a bit.  I decreased the water to two cups and found that to make the dough easier to work with.  I also ground some chopped pecans and added them to the cinnamon/sugar mixture(which I also doubled).  Outstanding!

These were really good, but were quite time consuming!  Will definitely make again, but only for special occassions!

Also, I do not suggest using all of the cake mix as suggested by other reviewers... made it more sticky and it didn't rise as well as it would have with the appropriate amount of flour!

Thanks!

Delicious.  I used the whole cake mix and reduced flour to 4 cups.  I doubled the sugar, cinnamon, and butter part.  Also, used brown sugar instead of white, added some nuts. Worth making!

These are without a doubt the best cinnamon rolls ever! They were delicious and looked beautiful. I split them between 2 smaller pans, I baked one pan the first day and put the other pan in the refrigerator and  let it rise for 24 hours, they turned out just as well as the first pan.

I have made home made from scratch cinnamon rolls many times, so I was quite skeptical about making these "Cake Mix" ones, fearing they'd come out tasting "cakey", but they were wonderful!  I had to add one more cup of flour than the recipe called for to make my dough less sticky, and I think I would add even more filling next time...I like them very gooey in the middle!  They were easy to roll and cut, and they rose very quickly in a warm oven, which cut down on time!  Also, I covered them in a cream cheese frosting.  The kids and hubby downed two each and wanted even more!

This recipe is wondeful. I did the 18 oz of cake mix in replacement for 1 cup of flour like someone else suggested. My father-in-law told me they were better then his mom's and his mom's recipe was always called the best.

this was my 2nd attempt making cinnamon rolls.  my first w/another recipe was horrible!  i didn't want to try any other recipes until i saw this one because it seemed so unique w/the use of yellow cake mix.  the dough was very,very,very soft but that could be the result of me not measuring the cake mix (my box contained double the amount called for).  or it could be that because hawaii is humid...i may have needed additional flour?  anyway, it was difficult to handle the dough but i just used a lot of flour and a flat scraper.  i was unable to roll it out so i instead just pulled and pressed it out to shape while i pressed out the air bubbles.  it was hard to roll up into the log shape after buttering and sugaring because it was so soft but i managed.  i also cut the pieces w/the scraper and laid them into the pan like a juggler.  in the end....they turned out oh so tender and tasty...yummy!  everybody loved them!  especially my daughter visiting from the mainland; she couldn't stop eating them!  the icing is deelicious to boot!

I thought these rolls were easy for cinnamon rolls-I couldn't believe you didn't have to knead the dough.  I substituted the white sugar for brown in the filling and almost doubled the sugar and cinnamon-the rolls were delicious.  I also didn't read the recipe right and added the whole box of cake mix. The dough was sticky so I added more flour. I will definitely make these again.

This was AWESOME! My first time making Cinnamon Rolls and they came out PERFECT! Some modifications I used: I baked them in smaller pans so they would all be baked evenly (my oven is temperamental), I used a different frosting recipe (one without butter), and I used brown sugar and extra cinnamon. 
And regarding what to do with the other half of the cake mix?? I just modified the box instructions (cut everything in half) and made cupcakes! :)
Great recipe! A yellow cake mix- I never would have guessed!

I am not much of a cook(sooo busy), so I
had a can of buttermilk buiscuits in the fridge.  My husband wanted cinnamon rolls, so I found your recipe and modified using the canned buiscuits. They were FABULOUS!! I can only imagine how good your full recipe is! Thanks

These are INCREDIBLE! I have never ever come across a recipe that is as close to perfection as this one. If you are looking for store-bought quality and them some you MUST make these!! Extremely easy and actually fun!  I recommed buying whipped cream cheese frosting and frosting these while still warm. Makes it Purrrrrrrrfect!

I really liked the lightness of these rolls, but the frosting was a little too sweet for my taste.  I made a cream cheese frosting for the second batch and preferred that.  My husband agreed on the frosting, and the second batch went down very quickly.

I took others' advice and used the entire cake mix but used between 4 1/2 and 5 cups of flour...my dough was still very sticky after only 4 cups as others had suggested.  Also, being my first attempt at cinnamon rolls, it would have been helpful to be told to roll the dough out to approx a 20"x16" rectangle.  I gathered that information from other recipes.  Overall, very good!

These were o.k.  I guess it just wasn't the kind of dough that I was looking for.  I followed another review and used the whole cake mix and 4 cups of flour.  They did taste good but just not what I was wanting.

I Love this recipe! I altered the filling by substituting brown sugar for the granulated sugar, and adding 2 Tbsp flour, to add a richer flavor.
My family loves to walk in the door after these have been pulled out of the oven!

First, I halved the recipe and it still made 12 beautiful large rolls.  The dough in this recipe is extremely sticky...too sticky. So I increased the flour by 1 cup and used the entire 9 oz of cake mix for half the recipe. Still sticky, but manageable. At first I was really skeptical because the dough is definitely not easy to work with - but the end result was "BLISS".  We prefer a buttery cream cheese frosting. I also cooked these in a convection oven for 18 minutes at 325 degrees. So moist and flavorful.  I will make again, but might try less water next time.  Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent!!! I made a few modificatons though.  Used the whole box of cake mix and decreased the flour to 4 cups.  Since the dough was very sticky and hard to handle, would probably decrease the water by 1/2 cup also.  Be sure to turn the dough out on a WELL floured board.  It was too sticky to roll out, but floured the top and patted it into a large rectangle and it worked fine.  They did turn out to be delicious.  Like some of the other reviewers, I mixed up a larger dose of the sugar and cinnamon and was glad I did.  They were tasty!!  Would be good as a sticky bun recipe also. Oh and I made a thin icing--left out butter--and drizzled it over top of buns.  Yum!!

These cinnamon rolls were not what I expected.  Based on the reviews, I thought the cinnamon rolls would be delicious.  They were too heavy and the consistency was not what I was looking for.  Although the icing is a keeper, I will not make these again.  I was looking for something similar to the cinnamon rolls KFC used to sell years ago.

These were good.  I too, found the dough sticky and hard to work with....had to add flour. (different brands of cake mixes maybe?  I used Duncan Hines)I should have read the review about using 1/2 cup less water first possibly?  I used brown sugar....about 1 1/2-3/4 cups and way more cinnamon than called for, and still  could have used more of both.  For the frosting I used 1/2 butter, 1/2 cream cheese and it was excellent.  As for what to do with the other 1/2 of the cake mix, I put it in an airtight container in the fridge, and planned on making another batch of these next weekend.  After the response I received from my family, I will have to find another use for it.  They love my traditional homemade cinnamon rolls, so I'll be sticking to that recipe.  Thanks Jamie :)

I made Sticky Buns!  These were so good!  I was a little worried as I was mixing the dough because it was not very firm at all.  I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to shape the rolls.  After I let it rise the first time I ended up kneeding in quite a bit of flour(maybe a cup or so).  If was soft enough so I didn't need to roll it out, I just pressed it.  But it did hold it shape to make rolls, so I was happy.  I did make a few changes(similar to those that others had made).  I substituted brown sugar for the white sugar used in the gooey filling.  It was very good, but not enough.  I think next time I'll double the filling recipe and even put some on top of the rolls after I've assembled them and put them into the pan, you can never have too much sticky when eating sticky buns...  And instead of dividing a box of cake mix in half, I just picked up a box of Jiffy yellow cake mix; very inexpensive and good, with no leftovers to worry about...  !  And the icing was great.  I added an extra tablespoon of milk because it was very stiff and hard to work with.  It was still very sweet, and the butter flavor came through nicley.  For something different, next time I may use orange extract instead of vanilla.  Overall a great recipe, very versitle and very yummie!

This is one of those recipes that makes you famous with everyone you know! I use brown sugar instead of white to increase the goo-factor, but beyond that, I haven't touched the recipe. Don't make this for friends or family unless you're prepared to make it constantly!

This was great, and I was skeptical! I just found it took a little longer than expected.

Also, important note. I made rolls in a glass pan and a metal pan--and the glass pan rolls were FABULOUS while the metal pan rolls were just okay.

Only other problem- what do you do with the remaining cake mix? haha! :)

These were a huge hit both at home and at church!  The only change I made (I can't leave anything alone) was to add a package of instant white chocolate pudding mix along with the 1/2 cake mix.

Absolutely melt in your mouth delicious! I do think with some chopped pecans added into the frosting it would add another star or two! I am also going to try a cream cheese frosting next time I make them. Thanks!

When I used this recipe it was the first time I had made cinn rolls and they came out so good! My father in law took one for the morning and he called at 7:30 am to say he thought he had died and went to heaven! They are very tasty and very easy for 1st timers!

This was hard to rate. I made everything according to the instructions- but the dough was so sticky, It was impossible to shape. I ended up making a sort of cinnamon sheet cake- that tasted great, but I can't get over the dissapointment of not being able to make actual rolls.

These were awesome!  I actually enjoyed these more several hours after they were made.  They retained their moisture well and tasted just as good the next day.  I froze one pan and just reheated one in the microwave when I wanted a snack.  I doubled the butter mixture and used a cream cheese frosting which put these over the top. I highly recommend this recipe.  Thanks for sharing.
