I have tried to cook spaghetti on my own way, I think it looks like Chinese style of spaghetti.  Anyway, I am a beginner and I will try to make different recipe... :)

I hate to be the initial reviewer and kick things off w/a 3 star review, but, for us, it was "ok", just as 3 stars indicates.  It was certainly quick to prepare and used pantry staples, but it just had a bit of an off taste to me, kind of like Pasta-Roni.  So, if you're a fan of products like Pasta-Roni, you'll love this (and that's not a slam at all, just something to give you an idea of what to expect).  Otherwise, this probably isn't for you. THANKS, for the recipe, Amy R!

I have been making my own version of this recipe for years.  The only thing missing is salt and pepper to taste.  I love this recipe because it is so versatile and can be made as either a side dish of a pasta or as a main quick meal.  I also add milk and parmesean cheese sometimes for a bit of a difference.

It was actually very good.   I had all ingredients on hand, so an easy sauce to make.  I had seen another review stating "you forgot to put salt & pepper in it".  Don't add more salt.  It's salty enough.  I served this with baked garlic parmesan chicken on top.  The combo was good.

Recipes are references for me...this one was no different. I first sauté up garlic,onion and pine nuts in a Dutch oven with a cup of white wine. Added the one pound of broken pasta started adding veggie stock about a cup at a time sprinkled crushed red pepper black pepper and Italian spices as I cooked down the stock. It took about 5 cups of stock to cook the pasta. The last few mins I threw in chopped pea pods and chopped up fresh parsley. Served on the with grilled shrimp(& grilled tofu for my vegan). Huge hit with all and was asked when I’d like it again!
