I was looking for a recipe that didn't use boxed cornbread and came across this. It has a very nice flavor and is easily customized to your own taste. I thought the tamale topping might not be enough but I took it to a friend's house for a potluck and everyone thought it was great!

This was "good..." according to my 10-year-old daughter and teenage son. I pretty much followed the recipe, but substituted ground turkey for the beef (which was fine, since there was sufficient sauce and spices). Also decided to substitute a can of beans for the olives...was going to add the olives to the topping but didn't because I was in a hurry. Maybe next time I will also consider adding some diced zucchini for extra veggies. The addition of the eggs to the cornmeal topping made for a nice, fluffy crust that had the added plus of being gluten-free. I think this is the best tamale pie recipe I ever tried!
