Love it! This is a great company entree. The only change I would make  is to change the oven cooking time to 45 minutes in lieu of 1 hour.  My chops were thick but were borderline  overdone.  I used the large mixed variety raisins and they plumped up really nice.  Very attractive presentation too.

This was very good, my family really enjoyed it and it was very easy.  You may have to alter time depending on the thickness of the pork chops.  I did mine for 45 minutes for 3 chops @ 1" inch and it was very good and not dry at all. I have to say for having brown sugar in it - it is not super sweet, nice flavor when mixed with the juice from apples and pork.  A keeper - Thanks!!

This recipe turned out great!  I had to alter the pork cooking time to about a minute on each side and baking time to 30 minutes since I had thin cut pork chops, and the entire dish still came out beautifully.  I also used apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar.  I will definitely make this again.

I make this all the time now, with some adjustments. I use 3 parts apple cider and 1 part chicken stock for the sauce, instead of water, and cider vinegar instead of white. Definitely needs the sage and cinnamon, and the cooking time cut down. And pork is always better when brined, so do that first.

As my husband loaths raisens, I decided to omit them and use walnuts instead.  The outcome was almost succesful, we realized that a spice was lacking, as I did not use any.  It was decided that cinn. was the appropriate spice to add to the sauce.  Very good.  Chops were nice and tender.  This one goes into the monthly rotation.

*As a note, tried it again with the modifications and decided it was awful.

An update from the submitter:  Sprinkle the salt and sage on the browned pork before laying in the baking dish.  Making this for supper tonight and just wanted to update the recipe for those that had asked what to do with the seasonings.

this was a great recipe. Note to chef- the sauce looks like glue and smells like glue. dont worry though, it is amazing once it is baked. I only had pork tenderloin and it was TENDER. leftovers arent the best but there probably wont be leftovers if you make it right.

These pork chops turned out amazingly! Very tender and juicy. The only change I made was to take out some of the fat drippings and add a little olive oil to the rue. I also used white rasins since I think they taste a little sweeter.

These were some of the most tender pork chops I've ever had. I love that they braise in the gravy, which comes out perfectly after everything's done. I like my chops on the herby side, and didn't have sage, so I added a sprinkling of dried thyme and rosemary, and per another reviewer's suggestion, dusted the chops with cinnamon, too. Oh, and I didn't have raisins, so I substituted dried cranberries. They turned out wonderfully! On the next go-round, I'm definitely going to try them with sage.

I did the recipe with 2 pork chops so my cooking time was drastically reduced as well. I LOVED how well the apples and raisins stayed on the pork chops after cooking. Made a beautiful presentation. Will definately make this more often!

VERY good and VERY easy!  Agree with other reviewers in that sage is needed and cinnamon brings it together (I like herbs).  Sprinkled a couple of chops with rosemary too & with the raisins it was heavenly!  Used apple cider instead of white vinegar per others suggestions.  Will use chicken broth instead of water next time and as another reviewer stated the "gravy" is a little scary at first but it comes together in the baking dish!  Thanks so much for sharing - adding this one to the rotation!

I also added some chunks of sweet Vidalia onion to the bottom of the baking dish, and found that to offset the sweetness of the apples and brown sugar beautifully. Also, I used chicken stock instead of the water for the sauce, and added some pepper. Delicious. I will continue to make this.

Very good sauce, chops and dried fruit.  I was a bit disappointed that my apples came out mushy...I was hoping for a bit more crispiness...however it might have been the TYPE of apples I used (Macintosh).  The flavor, however, was divine.  I used apple cider vinegar and a mix of cranberries and raisins.  I did not use the sage...the recipe doesn't direct you to add so I mistakenly passes that step.  However, I don't think I will add it next time, either.

We made this for a special family dinner and it turned out beautifully. As always a meat thermometer and evenly spaced meat in the baking pan ensured the texture of the pork came out dinner-knife tender. What surprised me most was that the apple ended up baked but not mushy at all, which brought a refreshing crispiness to the dish. We added about 1/2 cup of the same wine we were having with dinner to the sauce, as well as generous sprinkling of fresh rosemary over the pork. We will definitely be preparing our pork chops this way again and again with slight variations (different fruits, wines).

This recipe was absolutely fabulous!!  My family LOVED it!!!  I got tired of cooking and eating the same foods all the time, so I wanted something different, and this recipe was PERFECT!!  I added cinnamon and nutmeg to taste and vanilla extract to the raisin sauce.  Deelish!!!  Heidi, thank you!!! Although, you are from P.A., I'm from Ohio, but with the name Dixie Pork Chops, I thought it was a Southern dish, until now.  Anyways, in my home this recipe has became know as, "Yankee Doodle Meets Dixie Pork Chops".  LOL

Awesome!! I pounded my chops out to about 1/4 inch. I put the salt and sage on the chops before I cooked them. I don't think the recipe tells you when to do that. And since I trimmed my chops of fat I had to put more oil in for the rue. My family loved this and it is now a staple!

This was fantastic!  Made for a family gathering and everyone had a clean plate when they were done. Used a few suggestions by others. Browned the pork chops with a bit of sage and rosemary. Used Apple Cider Vinegar instead of White Vinegar. When I covered the chops with the apples and sugar, I also used about 1/4 tsp of cinnamon & 1/8 tsp of sage & rosemary. Used a combination of dried cherries, golden raisins, craisins, & regular raisins. I also used butterfly pork chops (nice,thick, & on sale) cut in half. Took about an hour to cook.  Came out tender & juicy.

Very good.  I've made a variation of this recipe before and suggest for slightly different (but definitely not overpowering) flavor, add some cloves to the flour mixture and bake for 45 minutes or hour depending on how thick your pork chops are.  Use about a half a teaspoon or more depending on how much flavor you want or how big the chops are.

Tasty, however the thick pork chops came out dry and didn't really soak up much flavor.  Definitely wont be cooking this as long next time.

Yummy.  I had some trouble with the gravy because I didn't get a lot of drippings from the chops.  It was lumpy at first, but I added some chicken stock and worked it out with a stick blender.  The end result was delicious.

Great recipe. I give it 5 but my husband gives it 3. So I met in the middle. The apples were not compltely done. That is the only complaint I had. I also only cooked for 45 min and it came out perfect.

I will definitly make this again. Simple to make, but tastes and looks more difficult. I doubled the ingredients for the sauce.I think it was a bit on the sweet side so I think I'll not use quite as much brown sugar. I also think a dash of red pepper flakes could give it some zing.

I made the recipe as stated, with the addition of an extra apple and cinnamon. The directions failed to mention where the spices went, and I nearly forgot to put them in. However, I added to the sauce and liked it that way. Very flavourful, and the chops were nicely done- do adjust cook time based on the thickness of your chops. Great with mashed potatoes and a green veggie.

Very good.  My family loved it.  A great way to change it up a bit.  Kept the pork chops tender and didn't dry out.  Will definitely use again! Thankyou!

I've made this recipe several times now, and it's such a guaranteed winner that I save it for special nights. The recipe does not say what to do with the sage; I just add it to the flour when making the gravy.  Also, instead of plain raisins I use a mixture of raisins, golden raisins, and dried cranberries. Definitely give this one a try--it gets better each time I make it!

This was so yummy. I only changed a few things, I didn't use oil, I used Pam so there were no drippings in the pan, I used a splash of sherry to deglaze the pan and instead of water I used apple juice and apple cider vinegar. I used really thin pork chops so it was only in the oven 40 minutes. Next time I make this I will use a pork loin!

In all honesty, I changed this recipe so much that I probably shouldn't even be reviewing it; but here is what I did.  First I dried my chops (they sear much better this way) and salt and peppered each side.  Once they were seared off, I removed them from the pan and added 2 sliced, peeled apples, 1/2 large sliced onion, salt, pepper, 1/4 tsp each dried savory and allspice and 1/2 tsp each of cinnamon and ginger.  Lastly, I added the zest of about 1/2 large orange.  Once the apple onion mixture was soft, I transferred to the baking dish which contained my chops and I added 1/4 brown sugar.  Then I deglazed the pan with 1 cup of chicken  broth.  I thickened the sauce with flour and poured that over the  chops/onions.  I baked the dish covered at 350 for 45 minutes and the end result was delish!  It was a little sweet for our taste, so next time I will reduce the amount of brown sugar, but apart from that, I wouldn't change a thing! ;)

This was the absolute best recipe I've ever gotten from this site, and I've had some pretty darn good recipes!  My sister tried it first and told me I just had to try it for myself and I am so glad I did.  It was so good that I wished I had made enough for seconds and I NEVER eat seconds!  I can't wait to make it again.  The only thing I did differently is I used Thyme instead of Sage (I added it to the gravy/sauce since the recipe doesn't mention what to do with it) and I sprinkled cinnamon over the apples and brown sugar.  Yummie! Thanks for a fabulous recipe that I will be making every week now!

This recipe was big on flavor, however DO NOT bake it for an hour. I cut it back to 45 minutes and the chops were still overcooked. Next time, I'll go a half hour.

I enjoyed this much more than hubby did. He didn't like the fruit flavors mixed with the pork. I however loved it. I thought it added a great tone to the gravy. I added the tiniest amount of cinnamon and nutmeg to the gravy, and only baked the pork for 45 minutes. This was great with mashed potatoes, I'll make it again, just not for hubby.

This recipe is very good and I made only minor changes...Firstly, it never mentions in the instructions where to use the salt, pepper or sage (I assumed you were to season the chops before searing?)  Secondly, I doubled the amount of sauce which worked perfectly.  When making the sauce I added 1/4 tsp of cinnamon and 1/8 tsp sage to the flour before mixing with the drippings.  This made a very nice sauce once cooked. Certainly a recipe I'd make again.

I am still drooling just thinking about this dish. I LOVED it. I did not add any spice or seasoning...no cinnomon, sage, or salt. The only thing I did different was to use apple juice in place of the water. Amazing.

Oh My, this was the best dinner I've had in a year!  I made it exactly as directed except for adding a sprinkle of cinnamon.  Wow!  I did use cranberries and the house smelled great, and dinner was a HUGE hit.  I can't wait to make it again and invite guests.  Thanks for posting this wonderful recipe.

This recipe was great but I made it a bit differently than directed.  I browned the chops in an electric skillet, removed them to make the gravy, and then put them back in with the apples and raisins to braise (covered).  One less pan to clean that way.  Also, I think the directions missed what do do with the salt and sage.  I ended up seasoning the chops with salt, pepper and sage to taste.  I think apple juice or cider would also be a good substitution for the water and vinegar.

I marinated the pork chops in garlic salt, followed the recipe and added some of the reviewer suggestion of cinnamon.  Delicious.  Husband loved it.  I brought it to work and coworker asked for recipe.   Another coworker said she didn't want to eat anything else as she wanted the flavors of the pork chops to stay in her mouth!!!

These were good; the apples and raisins were a great addition.  I guess we're just not the biggest pork chop fans.  Definitely needs less baking time than listed, otherwise they'll dry out.

I thought these chops were wonderful. They go so good with the apples. The gravy turns out beutifully as well. The recipie itself is great, but I made a few changes based on what we had and I just used cinnamon, rosemary, and craisins because they are what I already had. THANKS FOR SHARING.

After reading reviews here, I decided to give this a try. I used cider vinegar instead of white, but something was still off with the roux. The chops were flavorful & tender, but I think next time I will use more sage & salt (which the recipe doesn't note how to use) on the chops while browning as well as added to the roux with the flour. I used a combination of dried cherries, golden raisins, and craisins - they were SO GOOD. Probably a favorite element of this dish. I'll make it again and see if I can get the roux to be better.

Great alternative for boneless pork chops instead of the good old sauerkraut and pork chops.  I left the raisins out the second time and it didn't change the flavor too much.  The apples came out perfect, almost like comfort food meets refreshing.  Excellent!!

This was wonderful.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Since it didn't say what to do with the sage, I dusted it on the chops after I browned them in the pan and put them in the baking dish.

I will definitely be making this again.

Looking for some quick, easy pork chop recipes to clean out the freezer and came upon this one.  Simple yet very tasty. I made it with dried cranberries instead of raisins. The whole family loved it.

This is one of my new favorites. I forgot to put in the sage and I'm not a fan of raisins, so I used dried cranberries instead. It was fantastic. The chops I used were thinner, so I took them out of the oven when done and finished the sauce on the stove. It was even better the next day!

I substituted a can of chicken broth for the water and dried cranberries for the raisins since I felt they would add more flavor. The recipe is very easy to prepare and certainly tastes okay, but  it lacks oomph.

I was trying to find something different to do with pork chops.  This was the first recipe that I came across where I had all the ingredients.

My husband loved it.  In fact, he's already planning as to when I could make it again.

I didn't use the sage, but did use seasoned salt when I browned the chops.

These were terrific!  A great change from boring everyday pork chops.  I seasoned my chops with adobo (an all purpose carribean seasoning) before frying.  I added the cinnamon as suggested with the brown sugar and added the salt and sage to the sauce.  Very, very, very good.  Served to my husband after a three week military trip and he thoroughly enjoyed his welcome home meal!  Even the kids ate it (although they picked out the raisins ;-).

This was very good.  I sprinkled a bit of cinnamon on the apples, and because my pork chops were thin, I only baked them for 40 minutes.  It was quite tasty.  The sauce was good over rice, too.

This turned out very blah for me. And since it turned out that way, I am disappointed that I added oil and sugar to it, which made it less healthy for my family. Sorry, don't know how I could of done this recipe better.

A unique, and very flavorful change to pork chops. Raisins and apple combined with sweet sauce is absolutely fantastic. Following directions, I think the meat was a little overdone. A meat thermometer probably would have been a good idea - then they would have been 5+. Will do again!

Cooked about 45 minutes.  I found that although the sauce was quite thick after cooking it became a bit runny from the juice off the apples.  Would add a tad more flour next time.  Also I used cider vinegar.  Very nice change.  Will make again

These were good, though not phenomenal. My 6-year-old liked them, which was big!  The recipe didn't specify whether the pork chops were bone-in, so for those who are wondering, that is intended!  I used boneless chops, which were just right after 35 minutes (foil removed for the last 10 minutes).  I did microwave the apples a little before topping the pork since the cook time was reduced, and I did have to add some fat since I didn't get much while searing the meat.

It was delicious.  Used thinner pork chops-6.  Was even better left over.  Next time I'll probably replace the raisins with dried cranberries.

I make these about once a month. The raisins and apples compliment each other perfectly. Just be careful not to overcook the pork chops if you get thin sliced chops.

Wonderful recipe. I took reviewer's advise, sage, apple cider vinegar, cinnamon, chicken stock and onions. The pork chops had a beautiful sear and were very juicy. I paired the pork chops with oven roasted sweet potatoes seasoned in garlic, rosemary, olive oil, salt and pepper. My boyfriend and I loved it.

This was so wonderful!  I used some changes I read from reviews....dried cranberries instead of raisins, cider vinegar and chicken broth instead of the water and white vinegar.   I also made it using chicken breasts one time and it was OUTSTANDING!!!!!!  Definitely is going to continue to be a seasonal favorite in this house!

I would have given it four stars, but my husband and daughter only gave it three. I think they thought the meat was tough.
