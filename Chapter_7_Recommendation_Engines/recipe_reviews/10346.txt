I have to admit that I was skeptical about these little cookies.  I doubled the recipe and used one box of lemon instant pudding and one box of cheesecake instant pudding.  They turned out fantastic and were eaten within minutes.  Definitely will make again.

These cookies were pretty good - very very fast to make if you are in a hurry. My batch disappeared just as fast as they were made - would suggest adding a sugar coating to the top just before baking to help give them some texture.

Absolutely fantastic!  Deeee-licious!  This recipe is so easy and fast that I was able to make a batch while my 4-week-old son took one of his notoriously short naps.  My batch made 2 dozen instead of the 1 1/2 dozen stated in the recipe.  Lucky me!  I recommend doubling or tripling the recipe so you don't have to be stingy!  I also cut down the time to 8 1/2 min and they were just right.  Light inside and just crispy enough on the outside.  My new favorite cookie!  Yumm!!

This is a breadier cokie that reminded me of a soft lemon shortbread.  Mild lemon flavor, not too sweet.  I liked that it absorbed tea and milk easily (I'm a dunker).  Some royal icing or sugar on top might satisfy a stronger sweet tooth.  I enjoyed them, though I can see how the biscuit-y quality might turn some people off.

Fast and easy. To make even easier, roll into a log, slice into 12 cookies to fit perfectly on the large cookie pan. If you like the cookie to be cripy, as I do, flatten them real well and cook 15 minutes.

These are really good and really soft - my mom (lemon lover) loved them.  Tastes artificial, so don't be expecting that homemade taste.  Really good though.

Great cookie recipe! Easy and very good!! Instead of nuts, I added poppyseeds in the dough. Just right sweetness and lemony taste... Thanks for the recipe!

These were very easy, but not that sweet.  I melted white chocolate on top to sweeten them up, but they still taste like lemon flavored biscuits.  My husband loved them though.

Just a note if you make these with Lemon Jello instead, it still works but will be much more lemony.

These are so easy to make. I have found it though that it needs 1 or 2 Tablespoons of water mixed into the dough for lemon, chocolate, pistachio, coconut instant puddings. Butterscotch was the only flavor it didn't needed extra moisture for forming the little balls. I recommend the lemon and the coconut out of these flavors. And I have rolled the cookie dough balls in sugar before placing them on the cookie sheet, as some people found it bland.

These Cookies are very easy and tasty. I put sugar on them after they cooled, which was rather quick. Also, I only got 12 cookies out of the recipe. Next, time keeping on the easy side, I would squeeze from my plastic lemon a small amount of lemon juice. If they were harder to make I would only give them a 4. But, because they are so easy, I'm giving them a five! This recipe would be great for toddlers to help you at home or at a daycare.

These were so easy to make and so good. I doubled it and they lasted a day. I just used granulated sugar on top they were perfect. Thanks so much for a great recipe.

OMG!  Ok, so this is the PERFECT, not-too-many-ingredients-on-hand-but-I-have-the-munchies recipe!!!  My husband doesn't even like lemon cookies but he couldn't resist these.  It didn't make very many, only a cookie sheets worth, so next time I'll double it.  This way the grown-ups don't have to fight with the kids over these cookies!  Super easy, super yummu.

These were delicious and quick!  The lemon flavor was not too strong.  I also don't like things over-poweringly sweet and these were perfect.  I can't wait to try different flavors of pudding with this recipe.

Perfect and really easy.  I made bite sized cookies and recipe yielded 2-1/2 cookies.  Also, I made the dough a day ahead and refridgerated it, and they still turned out beautifully.

These are super, I use waffle mix instead of buttermilk mix and love them they are the best, even my mother in law likes them! I tried to make a batch with chocolate pudding and they were uninspiring to say the least.

Followed the recipe exactly (except used chocolate pudding instead of lemon) and all I can say is that these cookies are pretty uninspired.  Texture is meh, flavor is meh and presentation is also meh.  But if all you've got to make cookies with is pudding mix and biscuit mix, can you really expect anything else?  Maybe a sugary frosting or glaze would help.

I hate giving low reviews but this cookie's taste was just horrible.  It was very artifical/chemical tasting (maybe it was the type of pudding I used, which wasn't even sugar-free).  I liked the texture, somewhat like scone meets cake- I did drop the cook time to 8 minutes like other reviews suggested.

I was a bit disappointed with these. My husband loves anything lemon. When I saw cookies with lemon pudding in them...how could I lose? These have very little taste and are dry. My husband admitted to not liking them. Really easy to make though!

loved how easy this recipe was. I doubled the recipe. I had a lemon on hand & used the juice & zest from it. I used the lemon juice & oil to equal 1/2 cup. dough was very soft/moist(next time i'll add 2-3 tbsp extra of baking mix) as a viewer mentioned, I log rolled the dough into 2 logs and sliced into disks. the zest & lemon juice realy make the flavor pop in your mouth. this made 3 cookie sheets.I baked one each for 10 -12 +15 minutes on parchment paper. we liked 15min best, not as cakie. thanks for the recipe I can't wait to share this recipe.   murphy

I didn't have lemon, so I made one batch with chocolate pudding, and one batch with vanilla pudding. The recipe was amazingly easy and they turned out very tasty.  Not the texture of your typical cookie, though.  I noticed the dough was a little dry so I only cooked them about 8 and a half minutes instead of the full ten, and they were still moist on the inside.

These have a very strange flavor.  I don't know why they get such good reviews.  They are definitely easy to make and we frosted them and ate them up, but tasted weird.

Only 20 minutes from start to putting the first one in your mouth!  It sure didn't take that long for them all to be eaten.  I have tried other flavors but the lemon or the lemon/cheesecake is by far the best.  I am a major chocoholic but I still like the lemon best.  I guess that is what this recipe is all about.

Instead of greasing cookie sheets, use parchment paper...so much easier to clean up and bakes cookies perfectly.  This is a great quick cookie recipe.

The mixture just seemed too dry to me.  I added a couple teaspoons of vanilla since I was afraid of adding anything else.  I also threw in some white chocolate chips.  They were okay.  Slight lemon taste to them.  The chips added some extra sweetness.

Very good, small shortbread type cookie. Used bisquick and yellow sprinkling sugar.  Made about 15 small cookies. Husband liked them so thumbs up! Interested in trying with coconut pudding and butterscotch!  I may try with gluten free bisquick and sugar free pudding. Stay tuned....

I was looking for a recipe that would use lemon pudding mix and came across this. After reading the ingredient list, I decided to try and make them into scones instead of cookies. I figured the biscuit mix would lend itself to a scone texture and boy were they good! I did make a few changes based on ingredient availability and other reviews. I only used one box of lemon-flavored pudding mix and added some lemon juice and half & half to the mix. I also made a lemon glaze out of confectioners sugar, lemon juice and half  &  half.  Great base recipe that will be fun to try with other flavors. Am already thinking about making them as lemon biscuits for a strawberry shortcake. Thanks for sharing!

These are great cookies. Super quick. followed the directions, doubling everything. I also added 2 tbl lemon juice and 1/2 tsp lemon zest. They didn't need it, I had some lemons that needed to be used. I made the sugar topping stated in the recipe, as well as some with a lemon butter frosting, also on this site. We preferred the frosted ones. The frosting really made these pop.

Five stars because it was easy and only had a few ingredients. Found they had a slight bitter taste but fixed it by adding...Cool Whip, a dollop on each cooled cookie and they were awesome!!!!

I followed the exact recipe...the cookies weren't sweet at all when baked! It tasted better as cookie dough.They had a salty flavor to them. Would not try again.

As other reviewers said - not very sweet. The easiest fix for this is to make a lemon glaze (lemon juice + confectioner's sugar). That and adding a little fresh lemon juice and zest to the batter and this is an excellent cookie. Although, it does not make many, so be prepared to double or triple the recipe! :)
