Try fresh grated ginger -- start w/ a small amount and then increase to taste..Ginder lasts quite a while in the freezer -- just break off a piece to use and put the rest back in the freezer, tightly sealed...Grating on a microplane is perfect...Also, add a little garlic for more ooomph

I tried this recipe last night....  Thought it might be a bit weird with the basil and mustard, but it was really wonderful.... I actually used mustard powder as I didn't have any prepared mustard in my pantry.  The marinade has so much flavour!  I will make this again!

If I could give this 6 stars I would!  So delicious- served with Sesame Green beans and Roasted New Red Potatoes (both from this site).  Thanks for the recipe.

This was tasty, but I don't know that I would have called it "Ginger" Steak, since the ginger flavor was kind of mild and not very noticeable. On the whole, a great way to do steak, though. I used a whole tenderloin instead of sirloins (it was on special) and marinated in the mixture for several hours after mixing everything up right in a gallon-size zip-top bag. I also omitted the salt since there was soy sauce and I was pretty sure it didn't need it. (I was right.) Tasty main dish though - thanks!

Fabulous!  Prep time was only 2 min.   I did not add the salt due to the soy sauce and I threw my steaks on the grill outside.  My kids ate this up and we actually ran out of steak.  Will make this again.

I fixed these and everyone thought they were very good and very tender. Even the couple that don't normally like beef thought it was good.  I massaged the marinade in about an hour before cooking and only broiled about 3 min. per side for med. rare.

Ok...first of all, this was SUPER easy to make, and it was so good! My husband went on for half an hour afterwards about how much he liked it, and then came in the kitchen and asked me if I would need to buy more spices so I could make it again. A hit at my house!

This had good flavor, but was extremely hot for the kids.  Would pair good with a baked potato to tone down the heat.  Also would be good to add this cooked steak on top of a salad or with some veggies for a quick stir fry.

This was way too salty for me.  My five year old found it too peppery.  I was very impressed with how well the odd combination worked together, and how flavorful it was even without marinating.

I'm going to pretend I'm Rachel Ray:
"YUM-O!" 
This recipe was great! Full of super flavor! I used steak tips instead of sirloin steaks. I think the tips absorbed the flavor more than the sirloin steaks would have and they were more tender. I will definitely be making this recipe again!

Sooo good! The only thing I changed was the cut of beef. Our favorite cut is the flat iron, it is so tender and goes great with this recipe!

Good combination. I grilled the steaks on a George Forman grill and over cooked the steaks but the flavor was good with this recipe. I would use this again and cook the steaks for 4 minutes for medium and about 3 minutes for rare steaks.

Fabulous and really quick and easy. Perfect recipe when you don't have time for a marinade. I doubled the sauce and rubbed it on both sides.

Although I am not a big ginger fan, this recipe made our steak most flavorful and was a big hit with company.  The strong flavors in this rub make for a perfect quick marinade.

These steaks had an excellent flavour! We used a cheaper cut of meat, but they were still tasty with this marinade.

The only thing I changed was dredging the steaks in salt, then washing them off before marinating. Yum!

Excellent recipe! Very tasty dish!  The ginger mixture is a real winner!  Next time, I will add a tiny bit more ginger to the mixture since I love the taste of ginger. I would suggest to marinade the steak for a couple of hours or even overnight with the ginger mixture.  Pending on how well you want your steak done, the amount of time allocated for broiling it will definitely vary.  If you want your steak well done, broil the steak for 7 - 8 minutes on each side.  Safe to say, I will definitely make this dish again.

I thought this recipe was good but my children wouldn't eat it and my mother-in-law said it was too hot for her taste.  I had the left overs cut up over a salad for lunch and MMMMMMmmmm good!  Thought it was better the next day.

I loved this marinade, good flavor! I made this a second time but used half a flat iron steak & cooked it on the George Foreman grill, 6 mins each side. It worked out well, quick & easy for a weeknight meal.

It was pretty good, but if I made it again I would try making double the marinade and brushing the tops again after I turned them over.

My husband likes ginger.  My husband likes soy sauce.  My husband likes steak.  Of course he likes this.  I thought it was pretty good, but I didn't add salt because soy sauce is so salty on it's own.  Wouldn't use on a great cut of steak, but great on the tougher ones.

This recipe has a lot going for it.  Missing from the instructions, I think, is to rub the marinade all over the entire steak, not just the top part.   This would require a double amount of marinade.  I also used fresh ginger instead of ground, and used reduced sodium soy sauce with no additional salt.   The flavor was good, but some of the steak didn't have any, and it would be best if both sides of the steak had the flavoring.    I would also broil it for 3 minutes, not 5 then turn and broil for 2 two more, for a nice medium-rarish sirloin

OMG!!  The easiest way to prepare a steak that is SO flavorful.  I prepared this  exactly to the recipe, then I BBQ'd instead of broiling (haven't quite master the oven and steak combo, but BBQ is by far the best way to cook beef).  This is the best home prepared steak I have ever tasted and the family loved it, too.  No left overs tonight!

Delicious!  I reduced the amount of salt and marinated the sirloin steak in a ziploc in the fridge for a couple of hours, then grilled it.

Fantastic recipe.  I usually mix up a bit extra marinade to coat is second time for added flavor.  The only change I had to make to the recipe was to replace the lemon juice with lime.  Still came out great!

For me, 4 stars means my family would enjoy this recipe occasionally with little or no modification.  Usually, my son keeps a bottle of A-1 on hand no matter the marinade already on the meat.  With this recipe the bottle never got opened.  Kudos.

I liked this seasoning -- just the right amount of tangy-ness and gave the sirloins a nice little kick.  I will use this again, but hopefully I don't overcook the steaks next time.

Very tasty and surprisingly well cooked considering I did it under the oven grill! I used too much soy sauce so it was a bit too salty, but I'll definitely use this again.

Very good. I would give 5 stars, but my family has another marinade that they like much better. This is good for when we feel like something different. I used tri-tip, doubled the marinade, and added 2 tbs rice vinegar, 2 tsp honey, and 1 tsp olive oil. I marinated the meat for about 6 hours and then broiled about 10 minutes each side (I like my meat extra well done)

I made this because my husband loves ginger so I added some pieces of ginger as well to it and I thought there was a lot of good flavor... he thought it could be stronger- I'll probably double the ginger next time for him.

I wish I knew how to add another half star and give 4 ½ because this really is very good. I did some modifications and by reading the reviews, they were a good choice.  I opted for fresh ginger and basil and reduced the salt and pepper by half and pulled back a smidgeon on the mustard. I had a package of New York Strip steaks which had absolutely no fat and I knew they would be dry if grilled so was looking for something flavorful that I could cook in crockpot and this looked great.  I cut the steaks into two pieces each and seared them in a cast iron skillet with a little olive oil.  I  rubbed the salt that would have been in the marinade into the steaks before searing.  I mixed the other ingredients (which I doubled everything but S & P and mustard) and poured that over the steaks.  I also deglazed skillet with about half cup of water and added that.  Cooked for just 4 hours and it was delicious!  Served with wild rice with toasted pecans, red grapes and a splash of olive oil, and a cantaloupe salad with mint and key lime and feta cheese.  I think it would have been great just over wide egg noodles because the broth was so rich and abundant, served with crusty bread and a salad for a very easy mid-week meal.  Great blending of different flavors and healthy to boot!

I was surprised by how much I liked this recipe.  It was very easy and I had all the ingredients on hand.  I used low sodium soy sauce, left out the salt, and used half the amount of basil and pepper as I was only making 2 steaks and do not like too much seasoning.  I can not wait to make this again!

My husband absolutely loved it.  I thought it was a little too salty.  I may try sweetening it up next time with either honey or maple syrup.  My son ate all of his too though.  I also will add more ginger next time.  I used fresh ginger; and when I got a bit of the ginger in my mouth, my tastebuds soared!  I love ginger anyway.

Fast, easy, and delicious! I will be using this one often. I used fresh ginger for more flavor. I also made it in a quart baggie, squished the ingredients around, and then added steaks to soak for an hour. Would also be great for pork and chicken.

It took me a little longer to cook the steaks, but I think it was because I had some bigger pieces of steaks.  Wonderful flavoring!!

Pretty tasty. Next time, I think I'll cut the salt down to 1/4 t. I used the sauce as a marinade for 2 steaks, and I cooked them in a skillet. They were very juicy and tasty. It's a keeper!

This steak was wonderful! I have problems with steak seasoning & this one was both quick & delicious!! I never have time to marinate for any period of time because I'm always working & don't pre-plan meals, so for those who are the same, this is the perfect steak. I prefer med rare so 3mins/3mins was exactly the right amount of time.  I didn't & wouldn't change a thing!!

Yum! had this tonight for dinner. I did however let it marinate overnight, this morning i added some steak seasoning on bothside of the steaks as well and instead of broiling them I threw them on the grill about 5min each side...delish!

I cannot believe how good this was. I made it last night and let it marinade for a couple of hours in the fridge. I poked the steaks with a fork a few times before marinading it. I used boneless top sirloin steak. Will definitely make again and again. Thanks for the recipe.

My husband and I both really liked this recipe.  I did as some others recommended and doubled the recipe and marinated it for 2 hours.  My 4 year old did not like it (I think the flavor was too strong).  I will go directly by the recipe next time and just rub the sauce on to see if it makes the flavor a little less strong.  I will also half the amount of black pepper because it had a bit of a bite to it.  Personally I like the extra bite, but the kiddo has a delicate palette. :)

My husband and I loved this one!  I used two small-ish tri-tip steaks. I substituted fresh, chopped gingerroot and garlic cloves and marinaded the steaks for about an hour. I hadn't cooked steaks in a long time (indoors) but this recipe might just bring me back around to beef under the broiler.

this recipe was ok... the steak came out really soft and tender and the flavor was good, but i think it would be better suited for the grill.. i will definitely be making this again, but on the grill instead of in the oven

I was surprised at how wonderful this recipe is.  I didn't have any lemons, so I used white wine vinegar.  I can't wait to try this again with the lemon.  I doubled the recipe and let my steaks marinate a few hours.  My husband and children loved the flavor.  This is a keeper!

This recipe was really delicious. My only recommendation would be to double the recipe. I halved it because I had half the meat- and it wasn't nearly enough marinade. The flavor was excellent though!

My husband does not like soy sauce, but absolutely loved this recipe.  It was a great hit.  I made it just as the recipe said.  It was quick to make.  The only difference was I used dijon mustard instead of yellow mustard.

Ok, I hate it when people completely butcher a recipe and then review it, but I have to give this recipe credit - so here goes...

Crock pot, chuck roast w/ as much fat trimmed as possible, sub spicy brown mustard, sub low sodium soy sauce, everything else the same. Marinated overnight, cooked 8 hours on low.  AWESOME.

My roommate couldnt help stealing a few bites before it was done, and ended leaving the lid cocked so water could escape for the last 2 hours - gave it a charred crust which tasted Great.

I have another chuck roast in the freezer and will probably end up making this again sometime this week

I left the salt out of this recipe as some other raters suggested and found myself missing it. Over all though this was a wonderful way to season a steak. My husband loved it! Would love to try it with fresh ginger and may give that a try next time as we will definitely be using this recipe again.

Made this last night and it was not the best flavoring of steak I've had.  My boyfriend thought it was just okay and said it was "different"...  Maybe it was the mustard flavor, but I don't think I will make this again.

This recipe is absolutely wonderful!  My husband can't wait to have this one again!
We only had two steaks, so I massaged some on the bottom and poured the rest on the top of the steaks before placing them in the broiler.  I continued to turn them every 5 minutes until they reached my desired doneness.  Dee-lish!

This was pretty good, but not the best.   I followed the recipe exactly, except I omitted the salt and we grilled the steaks instead of broiling.  A tasty dinner, but nothing to write home about.

I would rate this 2.5 stars. I followed the recipe as written but used dried mustard instead of prepared. I marinated it for about an hour.  It didn't really have a remarkable flavor from any of the seasonings.  This was an ok recipe but I won't make it again.

The ginger sauce tastes great! I use this as a salad dressing now also! The only thing I would change is the measurements. There wasn't enough sauce for it to really take effect.

Have never made steak in the oven prior to this, and it was excellent. I wouldn't cook it the full 10 minutes though unless you like your steak very well done. I did 3 minutes on each side (6 total) and it was medium rare verging on medium. 
I suggest experimenting with the time to get the desired level of done.

Fantastic! My husband loved this steak. This flavors all mix together and taste great. I doubled the garlic but, I really love garlic. I broiled for 5 min on one side and 3 min on the other and it was pretty pink on the inside.

The flavor was more subtle than I expected. I too omitted the salt due to the soy sauce. I was craving more ginger flavor and there just wasn't much. It had a good flavor, but was far from bold.

I made this last night and it was FANTASTIC!  I omitted the lemon juice only because I didn't have any on hand.  I let the steaks marinate for only 30 minutes before cooking and still the flavor was awesome.  I did make a 2nd batch to use as steak sauce and am so glad I did!  This was an absolute hit and I will be using this again and again!  Thank you!

Added fresh grated ginger and maybe an extra teaspoon of lemon juice.  I browned both sides of a 1-lb slab of rib eye with some chopped garlic and then put it into the oven to broil for about 5-10 minutes.  I took out the meat and let it rest for another 5-10 minutes, letting the juices seep in and allowing the meat to cook a little more.  It turned out a perfect medium rare.  The marinade as-is is a little salty, but good since I didn't soak the meat in the marinade for any significant amount of time prior to broiling.  Many rave responses (which was great!)

really good. DH loved it. I left off the salt, and I put less than ½ tsp salt as others had suggested. I would leave off even more pepper next time. & add more ginger.

I was really looking forward to this.  It was  afrantic day and I needed something quick.  I followed the recipe exactly but all I could taste was dried basil.  Sorry but this will not be re-appearing on my dinner table.

This was a great marinade! My husband and I were both surprised at how much flavor there was for only marinating for 30-40 minutes. The only change I made was to use Dijon mustard instead. It probably gave it just a little more zing.  We will definitely be making this again.

I was pretty impressed with this dish.  I made it for my extended family and they all loved it.  I used thin slices of beef though - because my husband doesn't like the thick ones.  It was still good.  Just a great flavor.

this was a good simple recipe, just would have marinated the steak rather than put the sauce on the surface.

My family loved this recipe.  It was quick, easy and delicious.  I was looking for something that I didn't have to marinade as I didn't have the time.  The only thing I changed was the mustard as I only had honey mustard on hand.  Tasted wonderful...I definetely added this one to my recipe box.  Thanks!

We enjoyed this recipe - it is easy to make and the flavour is very good. I made the recipe as indicated, except added half the dried basil, used Dijon mustard and added 1 tbsp of dry red wine to the mixture. I grilled the steaks and basted them while cooking with some of the ginger mixture I had reserved before massaging it into the meat. I'll definitely make again.

Followed recipe exactly and was not too impressed. Recipe called for 1/4 of rub on 1 side of steak and left it at that. Did both sides of both steaks and put under broiler (5 min 1 side, 4 min other). Very mild ginger flavor - otherwise not too impressed with flavor. I've read where the best way to do steak is HOT in a skillet, then a few min at 350F in the oven - would have probably been more tender/juicy. Don't think I'll do this one again.

I made this exactly as the directions called for and no one liked it.  The balance between the mustard and ginger gave the meat a bad taste.

This was pretty good, but I thought it overpowered the flavor of the meat.  I put this on a really good buffalo steak, and was disappointed because I could hardly taste the buffalo.  I think I would use it again on a supermarket-quality cut of beef.  I omitted the salt, rubbed the sauce into both sides, and broiled for 4 minutes per side.
