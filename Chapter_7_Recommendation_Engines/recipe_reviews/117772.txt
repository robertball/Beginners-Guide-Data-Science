Absolutely delicious. I've made this twice, and the second time I removed the chicken from the pan when done, stirred the honey and pecans into the drippings, and heated for about 3 minutes. Then I put the mixture on top of the chicken when I plate it. I prefer to make it that way now because it just makes a nicer glaze and really coats the pecans and makes them stick. Thanks for the recipe!

Pretty Good, but I thought the honey taste was just a little strong. It made the chicken too sweet and almost sickly after awhile. So maybe next time I make this recipe I'll use a little less honey, but that's just my personal taste.
    I toasted the pecans first in the oven for a couple mins just to bring out more of the yummy nutty flavor. I also followed many other suggestions and cooked the chicken first and then the honey and pecans to put on top.
     I also have a little tip to share when measuring the honey: Spray the measuring cup with a little oil first, that way you get the full amount and none of it sticks.

There was something about it i just didn't like.  I think it was that i took the advice of mixing the honey and pecans with the juices in the pan.  If i would have just drissled the honey over the chicken like the recipe said i believe i would have enjoyed it.

5 stars +!  My boyfriend and I loooove this recipe.  I've made it both as stated and as other reviewers have suggested, by removing the chicken and cooking the honey/pecans separately, and I agree that the latter method is preferrable.  I usually put the pecans in a baggie and roll over them with a rolling pin; however, don't pulverize them!  I like them somewhat coarse so I can really enjoy the crunch.  I serve this on a bed of wild or brown rice; the texture is a nice contrast to the nuts.  Don't skimp on the cayenne!  Sooo yummy!!

This is a great recipe. It's fast, easy, and all the ingredients is already in your pantry! I Love it! I made it for Valentines Dinner. My three year old just ate it up. My husband isn't too big on sweets but he  did help himself to seconds. I thought it would be too sweet with the honey but all the ingredients complemented each other so well. I did have to cook the chicken a little bit longer then directed  and I also incorporated the pan drippings with the honey and pecans. It did stick to chicken just beautifully after I plated it. Overall, a BIG HIT!

Yummy dish!  I too set aside the chicken while I warmed the honey & pecans with the drippings...I was afraid that it would turn out be a very sweet dish, but the Cayenne spice balanced out the flavor so it was not too sweet at all!  In fact, it had a spicy flare!  I definitely recommend giving this recipe a try!

What's not to love about this recipe?  Fast, few ingredients and delish!  I was afraid that it would be overly sweet with honey being the dominant flavor here.  I took the advice of others and added the honey and nuts to the pan juices, which probably diluted the honey a little and the cayenne is what really gave this another layer and dimension of flavor.  Great recipe, thanks.

This is a great, easy, quick recipe with great flavor rewards.  I made some alterations...

Our local market sells boneless chicken breast pieces much cheaper than the whole breast.  I used these and cut into smaller bite sized pieces.  

I used 1/2 of the butter and about one tbls. of safflower oil to brown.  I also had some mandarin oranges that were perfectly ripe.  I thinly sliced the peeling and cut open the fruit and added to the pan while the chicken was browning.

I followed the recipe suggestions of others and removed the chicken from the pan when it was brown.  I mixed the honey and pecans together in the pan and added the other 1/2 of the butter at this time.  I also added about one to two tbls. of orange juice at this point and let the sauce cook down some.  This way, each person could have as much or as little of the sauce as they wanted.

I served w/4-cheese rice and steamed broccoli.  My family LOVED it and said I should sell it!  Thanks for such a great recipe.

I made this for my husband and kids for our valentine's day dinner. Totally yummy! The kids liked it better without the pecan and honey glaze... but I think they are crazy! I definitely recommend taking the chicken out of the pan when done, then adding the honey and pecans (mix) to cook for 2 or 3 minutes. I added the chicken back in and stirred to coat. Oh so good!

Wonderful. Hubby rated it a 5* too. Did use a few suggestions...
removed chicken from pan when done, stirred honey (I used agave nectar in lieu of honey) and coarsely chopped toasted pecans into the drippings and heated for a few minutes, then drizzled over chicken. Agree with reviewer that cayenne is the right amount. It's a nice complement to the lemon juice. Served over rice with extra sauce. Delicious!

Made these for dinner this evening and hubby and I really enjoyed them. I didn't have pecans on hand, so I chopped up a handful of almonds. This was delish! Thanks so much for sharing your recipe!

I found this recipe years ago on another cooking site, so easy and yummy, I cut down on the honey a bit and use a bit more cayenne papper beacuse we like spicy in my house. I also use chicken breast tenderloins because I am cooking for just me and the hubby and it comes in the right portion for the two of us that way.

Loved it. I made 4 servings. My two year old refuses to eat meat, but he actually ate this chicken. I made jalapeno corn bread to go along with it. The sweetness of the chicken and the heat of the cornbread made for a great meal. 5 Stars bravo

Loved it - Simple to make (except pounding chicken breasts is never fun), and great flavor.  Heat from the cayenne pairs nicely with the honey.  I followed other raters' suggestion to remove chicken from pan, THEN add honey and pecans and cook a few minutes longer.

just ok, but has potential. I overcooked the chicken a bit so it was kinda dry ( I am always paranoid about undercooked chicken...). Definitely toast the pecans first; it brings out so much flavor. I squirted the honey right out of the bear onto the breasts, and then topped with the pecans. The pecans were great (and I usually don't like nuts too much), but the honey kind of cooked off, and didn't add as much flavor as I would expect. Might try again.

This recipe was really amazing. It had a perfect balance of sweet and spicy with a crunch. I served mine over a bed of baby spinach with a little Catalina dressing. I substituted the butter with olive oil cooking spray which cut back a lot of calories. I can see this recipe quickly becoming a staple in my kitchen.

Amazing! I substituted almonds because I prefer those, but it was very good.  I did make the honey and almonds in the pan with the drippings and just put on top of the chicken to serve.

It is important that you allow the chicken to simmer in the honey, otherwise you won't get the result desired.

I just finished having dinner and I must say this recipe is FABULOUS!!! I am not a big sweets lover so I was a bit apprehensive to make this but I was wrong, this chicken was amazing. I followed the advice of the other reviews and cooked the honey and pecans at the end and then drizzled it over the chicken. I served this over rice pilaf and with a green salad. I am so impressed with this recipe that I will add it to my menu for evenings when we have guests.

This was a quick recipe to put together and the taste was amazing! I cooked the pecans, honey and a small bit of sugar in the chicken drippings left in the pan and reduced it until it was just a little thinner than honey.  Awesome recipe!

Fabulous!  I prepared this exactly as written, with one exception.  I added an extra Tablespoon of pecans, because that finished off the package of nuts.  My husband was skeptical, but ended up raving about dinner.  Nice enough for company, and easy too!

I thought this was very delicious!  Not too sweet at all, probably thanks to the ceyenne seasoning.  I disagree with the people who said to mix the honey and pecans before pouring over the chicken.  This made the mixture way too thick and not drizzley.  I would say to heat the honey in the pan to drizzle over the chicken and then sprinkle the pecans over the top when on the plate.  I will do it this way from now on.  But I will be making this again - very yummy!

Quite tasty and ridiculously easy- even for a cooking novice like me!   One thing that we changed was we doubled the cayenne pepper, salt and pepper mixture. The result was much more of a kick to the end result. We also didn't use just "Honey Bear" type honey but Clove Honey (it comes in tubs) which, in my opinion, made all the difference.  Also, we had no lid for the pan, so we just ended up using a plate over the skillet and it seemed to work just as great; just a tip for poor college students!

This chicken came out delicious and my husband just loved it. Plus, it is so easy to make. I did, however, have to cook the chicken breast a little longer than the recipe called for. I did not have pecans, so used oven-toasted, chopped almonds, mm! I cooked the honey and nuts on top of chicken as directed, made a wonderful glaze.

Really good!  Be careful with overdoing the cayenne - it packs a lot of heat.  Sprinkle lightly.  2 mins each side to brown, 2.5 mins covered each side.  Plate chicken first, then add honey and nuts to pan.  Caramelize 2 mins then top chicken with the mixture from the pan.

My family, friends and I absolutely loved this dish!! it is very simple and it tastes delicious!! The only ingredient I had to replace was the cayenne pepper, I did not have time to go back to the market, so I used smoked paprika instead, and it gave a very exquisite taste. I also took the advise from the other cookers about taking the chicken out and preparing the topping in the same pan used, what a great idea! Once it was plated, I served the glaze on top and it gave it not only an awesome taste but a great look! I will definitely make this dish one of my repeats! We enjoyed this dish with parboiled-brown rice, and tossed salad with olive oil and apple cider vinegar.  Thanks Penny for sharing this mouth watering dish with us! And for the rest, Bon Appetit!

This was absolutely delicious.  I am normally a big fan of neither nuts nor honey, but the cayenne balanced this out wonderfully.  I cooked this for my parents and they loved it, as well.

This recipe was delicious!  I agree the cayenne pepper is necessary to counter the sweetness of the honey.  I took the advice of other reviewers and heated the honey and pecans separately.  I plan on making this again.  Next time I will reduce the amount of honey and pecans as we had more sauce than we needed.
UPDATE: I now heat the chicken in the honey, but I toast the pecans separately and put them on top at the end.

I made this last night.  If you are looking for something that is EASY, then this is it!  I melted a little butter, mixed the honey & pecans in a separate pan.  I poured the honey-pecan mixture on top.  I drizzled additional honey on top.  I didn't want to use the same pan as the chicken because the garlic was a little crispy.  This was sweet and savory!  BTW- I served it with brown rice & asparagus.  Thanks for the recipe!  I will be making this again :)

This is by far the best chicken breast recipe I've ever had !!!!! I did as others did and took the chicken out when done but before adding honey and the nuts I deglazed the pan with a little wine (not much) to get all the goodness off the pan then added honey and nuts and poured over the chicken, There was only the slightest taste of the wine.
  Thanks so much for this recipe this is a definite keeper !!!!!

I give this recipe 5+ stars. I flatten chicken breast, beating with rolling pin, then I brine the chicken. I did omit the cayenne and used chilli powder instead ( can't do hot stuff)The chicken was flowing with juices, so moist and sooo flavorful. Very good recipe, you won't be sorry.

So easy to make and DH and I both loved it. Saved some time by using a (clean) coffee grinder to get the pecans finely chopped. Will definitely make again!

I didn't use as much honey as it calls for, it just sounded like a lot, I just drizzled enough to cover the chicken.  Turned out great.  I also added a little more cayenne pepper to kick it up a notch, overall, very good.  If you don't like the sweet, you can even leave out the honey and nuts, I tasted it before adding the honey and it was spicy good!

This was actually the first meal I EVER cooked, for my boyfriend and I, and we both absolutely loved it. The combination of the cayenne pepper with the honey was just...*drool* I also did the honey and pecans separately, which really turned out nice. I also used a lot more cayenne pepper cause we like our food really spicy. >=) Thank you!
