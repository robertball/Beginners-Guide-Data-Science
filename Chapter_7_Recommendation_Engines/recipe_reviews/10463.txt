Wow, so rich and melt-in-your-mouth delish.  And sooo easy to make, but definitely CHILL the dough (about 30 min.) before rolling or you'll end up with sticky dough all over your hands.  If in a hurry, spray or grease your hands with cooking spray or oil b4 rolling.  Followed a reviewers tip and added 1 cup of rice crispies - awesome!  Thanks for the tip!  I also used mini chocolate chips, which I cut back to about 2/3 cups and also cut back on the sugar to 2/3 cups.  Perfect sweetness this way.  Have also decrease butter to 1.5 cups - great, can't tell the difference.  Looks like little truffles if you roll in cocoa powder and tastes just like a peanut butter cup.  Oh, and I always use a standing mixer with the paddle attachment to mix the dough.  1 min. of mixing and I'm done - quick and no mess!  Have made this many times- love it!

I love this recipe to make little bumble bee shapes.  I stripe the top with melted chips and use a toothpick to poke the eyes.  Then, I used slivered almonds for the wings.  The kids just love them in the summer at any function!

My husband came home from work and told me that someone brought in peanut butter cookie balls for everyone. He said that they were great. He asked for the recipe, but I couldn't wait. I started my search and came across this recipe and thought that I would give it a try. Well, he said that it tasted exactly like what he had. He did suggest to cut back a little on the mini chocolate chips. I guess the other recipe did not have as many and he isn't a chocoholic. I did refrigerate before I rolled them and it seemed to be alot easier. Thanks for sharing!!

Excellent for kids!  I found to be a bit sweet for myself. So instead I rolled a couple in sesame seeds for me...cuts out some of the sweetness.  Great recipe!

Excellent Recipe!  I used to make these when I was little with my mom.  I used ground up pretzels instead of graham crackers, though!

This tastes really good, but I wasn't able to mix it into balls right away. I had to put it in the fridge for 30 minutes, and let everything get cold.

I loved the addition of 1 c. rice krispies. I used natural peanut butter which I would not recommend since it is more oily and separates. I am bad at waiting for things to set up so I popped mine in the freezer and was able to eat them within 15 minutes! I also think next time I will only use 1 c. of butter.

This was an amazing treat! We are loving the balls. I was looking for something just like this. This is a recipe  you can do so much with. I thought the addition of Rice Krispies sounded great, but we didn't have any, so I used plain Cheerios and they added a wonderful crispiness when broken up in the mixer with everything else. I also added flax seeds and some extra chocolate chips. I didn't bother to dip them in anything because they are just for our family and they taste amazing just the way they are! Thanks for a great recipe!

I made these with 1-1/2 cups of Graham cracker crumbs, as many reviews said they were too wet. I also cut the amount of butter in half, and added an extra 1/2 cup of peanut butter. I didn't add chocolate chips. The resulting dough was crumbly, but, packed together tightly, made a rich, very peanut-buttery treat! I'll definitely make these again!

These were fantastic! Huge hit at the card party I took them too! I did make them a bit more decadent by dipping them in chocolate & drizzling more chocolate across the tops of them for decoration. My friends couldn't believe I'd made these delicious & lovely "truffles" at home! Definitely a keeper!

OMG! I made lots of candies over the holidays and this has got to be my favorite. Cut the sugar back to 1.5 cups and the butter to 3/4 cup. Used semisweet chocolate chunks and added a 1/2 cup coconut. These tasted like a peanut butter cup and were delicious. Thanks for the PB recipe!

These peanut butter balls frustrated me.  They didn't taste bad.  But the dough was very unmanageble.  I had to leave them in the fridge for 3 hours before I could shape them and it was still difficult. They become kinda goopy if they are left out for 20 minutes or so.  Maybe if the butter was omitted and an extra cup of peanut butter was added, this recipe would work.  I will never make these again so I'll never know but it might be helpful for anyone who's going to give it a try.  Also I did not personally care for the cocoa....way too strong.

This recipe is way too high in fat and sugar for my liking! Instead I did 1 cup of almond butter (good source of calcium), 1/2 cup raw honey, 1/2 cup+ rolled oats, 1/2 cup chocolate chips, 1/2 cup dried blueberries, and 1/2 cup chopped cashews. I mixed all of the ingredients together and added a bit more rolled oats until the mixture was sticking together, and it was pulling off of the sides of the bowl. Then I made them into balls and rolled in coconut. The oats absorb the moisture, so the next day they are a firm cookie (but I loved them when they were still soft too)

They were very good.  I found this recipe while I was at my parents, my mom wanted cookie but her oven didn't work so I looked for no bake and this recipe came up. I did them 3 way, coconut, cocoa, and graham cracker. My mom and I loved the graham cracker which went fast, my dad liked the coconut. The cocoa we didn't care for. I plan on making more tomorrow before i go back home.  We didn't even start to eat the no-bake cookies i made.  Love it.

I loved it. I refridgerated the dough for a lot longer than said. After I made into balls I refridgerated them again. When firm I dipped in melted milk chocolate. They have been a huge hit. I am planning on shaping them into footballs for Superbowl.

I only used 1 stick of butter and used 1 1/2 cups of sugar. I never used the chocolate chips though, I added 1 1/2 cups of cocoa krispies to the mix instead. I rolled them in chocolate crunch, chocolate sprinkles, and a mixture of sugar and cocoa. I also did as suggested earlier, refrigerated the mix for about 3 hours.The kids in our church youth group loved them and I had to promise to make them again.

I let the kids do this one by themselves, since there is no cooking or baking involved.  There was only a little fighting over who got to do what.  In the end, they all put their hands in and these turned out really well.  After shaping into balls, they rolled in extra graham crumbs.  These are going to be great in their lunches this week.

Tastes good but way too runny.... I could barely make balls out of them. I tried freezing and refridgerating the batter before making but half way through it would be runny again

VERY GOOD!  It's been fun to experiment with other reviewers sugestions too.  Rolled in Graham Cracker crumbs, they look a little like meat balls, so I have renamed them "Candy Meat Balls".  Now.....I would like someone to come up with "Candy Spaghetti".  Someone out there must be able to come up with something sweet that looks like spaghetti.  What a cute cookie plate.  Whitney, you did such a good job on these, now, how about some "spaghetti"??

I made them totally different..! I guess, you can say I got the idea from this recipe,  but I made them so different! I melted some Hershey's Caramel chocolate chips in the microwave! And added peanut butter in a bowl, then added the chocolate, some sugar, skipped the butter! Then I made them into cookies, and put them on a cookie sheet and put coconut on top and put them in the freezer....CAN'T wait to see how they turn out!

Yummy. I wanted a peanut butter treat that I could whip up in a jiffy and this seemed to fit the bill perfectly. Except for one small problem. The "dough" for this recipe was way too soft to roll into balls right away. I ended up sticking the mixture in the freezer for about 30 mins. and the dough was hardened and ready to be rolled. I didn't roll them in anything, I just put them in a container with mini muffin liners and stuck them all back in the freezer. That aside, this recipe get 5 stars for taste and I am surprised the chocolate chips didn't seem as hard to chew on as I anticipated. I was pleasantly surprised by this. Overall, great recipe, especially if you don't want to go through the trouble of melting chocolate to have with your peanut butter balls. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

These were VERY tasty- but a little hard to handle. I chilled the batter, and I would suggest rolling them in crushed graham crackers. It makes them much easier to eat ;)

Made these for a children's function at church - a hit! But messy to make.

Very good and easy. Most preferred them with coconut or graham crackers on the outside-the cocoa on the outside wasn't very good. Thanks for the great recipe.

Yum-O!  After reading the reviews and looking at the picture I made a few changes.  I only used 1/2 c. butter, crunchy peanut butter (it was all I had) and mini-chocolate chips.  I mixed it all with the hand mixer and used a small cookie scoop to form the cookies.  I did not have to refrigerate the dough by only using half the butter and they scooped out perfectly.  After scooping half the dough I then added Rice Krispies®  to the other half.  I left some plain, rolled some in powdered sugar, some in crushed graham cracker crumbs and dipped only the tops of some in the powdered sugar.  That way I would know which ones had the cereal mixed in.  I made 54 delicious little treats.  Most definitely would make these again!

super easy, very good, they are sweet, they do get soft when not in the fridge. I gave these for xmas gifts with other no bake cookies .. ppl loved these and the no bake rum cookies over all the ones I made! when making them again .. I'd put a gooey chocolate center in them. I used a 'melon' scoop with the ejector handle to scoop for controlled portioning.

I'd bet that some grape or strawberry jelly injected into the center of these balls would make them twice as good.

These are very tasty and so easy! I usually make only half the recipe and have to freeze some, but they are a great treat when you need a sweet fix!  I especially like to cut them into smaller pieces and add them to ice cream. Delicious!

A great base for adding more chocolate chips or you can dip these into chocolate to coat as well. I added more milk chocolate chips as well as a handful of white chocolate to mine. I may dip some of them later to try it. It only took 3 minutes of my time start to finish to whip them up. I refrigerated them before rolling into balls as well. They basically taste like peanut butter cookie dough though.....

My daughter made these today and had trouble rolling them as most of the peanut butter mix stuck to her hands.  I will say though, that they were tasty once they had been in the fridge for a few hours.  If we make them again, I think we will let them chill before forming them into balls.

Very yummy. Even my kids loved it.  It was just a little too sweet for me personally although not for others I served it to.  Anyway, I cut the powdered sugar in half and still came out really good.

The absolute easiest recipe I have made for christmas this year and oh soooo yummy!  I will absolutely keep this recipe! Thank you so much for sharing!!  I didn't change a thing with the recipe.

I will be making another batch and am thinking of dipping some in melted chocolate!  these are great for holiday gifts! thank you!! Deanna

These were really good. Followed recipe exactly. They do need a little something extra, though to become "5 star". I think next time, I will dip them in some chocolate flavored almond bark.
