I used regular canned salmon, added about 1 t. liquid smoke, and saved the money of purchasing smoked salmon, and got more comments on it than when I used real smoked salmon.

I took it to work today and it got high praise.  Very good.  I thought it came out a little too salty, but that could have been caused by my smoked salmon.

This is a streamlined version that is so easy to make. I know people change things up to their liking but honestly it is wonderful as written. When I didn't have the heavy cream I just used half and half and it was just fine.  I have just made it with fresh poached salmon and liked it even better. Anything fresh usually is! I piped it on cucumber rounds and then topped with a bit of fresh dill for an elegant presentation. MONEY!

Will try again using freshly made smoked salmon (or even frozen). Canned salmon shortcut is not the way to go.  Consistency of the spread was good though.

It was really good. I brought it to a golden globe party and it was a hit. Garnished the top with capers, will make this again!

I made the salmon spread for one of our appetizers on Xmas day. Instead of serving it as a dip, I spread it on flour tortillas, and rolled them, refrigerated them overnight, and sliced them, and served them as pinwheels. They were a big hit.

I used cilantro lime seasoning instead of lemon pepper.

I didn't' have the heavy cream or green onions so I substituted 2 TBSP cream cheese, 1 TBSP of milk, and used 1/2 tsp onion powder. It didn't have the nice green of the onions so I added a Tsp of parsley too.  Tastes even better the next day.

Just OK.  Probably won't make again.
