Two tweaks to make this a lunch for my husband, daughter and dear friend. I added 1 lb of chicken-tomato-basil sausage and subbed the parsley for lots of fresh basil. By consensus, the recipe earns 4 stars due to a slight complaint of saltiness. Could be from the bottled mushroom sauce. Ease of recipe, 5 stars. Ease and taste of Barillo products, 5 stars.

This was very fast and easy to make!  I couldn't find the Barilla mushroom sauce so I used half a bottle of Prego Alfredo Sauce instead. I also decided to add sausage to this recipe so I cooked mushrooms and sausage in separate pan then added them when pasta was done. It was a fast and easy dinner for two! My husband really enjoyed it! Thanks for the recipe.

it was great.  Very easy to make.  Make sure you get the Pronto pasta, not the regular cooking pasta or you will need to change the cooking structure of it.  Very easy for a weeknight.  Would make it again for sure.

I couldn't give this recipe a 5, because I could not locate the sauce called for in the recipe as written.  However, I subbed a jarred (15 oz) light alfredo sauce (I used the entire jar) and it was really delicious!!  It was a super quick way to get dinner on the table!!  Next time I might add some spinach too!  I will be making this one again!
