This is great!  I never thought to bake my polenta.  I stood over the stove for about 30 minutes or more to make it.  I found an instant polenta but it is just not as good.

I loved this stuff!.. Easy and delicious.  I added greek yogurt since I use that instead of sour cream in the house and sprinkled just the top with some Srirachia cheddar!  Will make this many times... soooo good!
