I haven't actually made this yet, but I will say that if you are going to make this recipe (take this from someone who has made TONS of fudge) increase the amount of chips (morsels)! This recipe calls for only 3/4 cup of each kind of morsel...when I make this, I am going to use 1.5 cups EACH. Based on the amounts of other ingredients in this recipe, you need around 3 cups of chips TOTAL for this to come out just right.

I changed the recipe a little bit. I used 2 cups mini marshmallows and 2 cups bittersweet chocolate but omitted the nuts. This was my first try at fudge and I was very impressed by the simplicity of the recipe. Measure out all of your ingredients before hand so that you can quickly mix in the chocolate, vanilla and marshmallow. Make sure that you let it set completely before cuting into squares. Will use this recipe again!

Perfect results; very easy and delicious.  I called it Chocolate Butter Pecan fudge and my family loved it.  One note - I found the butterscotch taste to dominate the chocolate, so if you prefer more of a chocolatly fudge, adjust the proportions of the morsels.

I have made recipes similar to this one(using marshmallow fluff and evaporated milk) many times.  This one was a huge disappointment.  First, there is too much milk in this recipe, causing the fudge to not set up properly.  Another recipe I have that makes a 9 x 13 pan also uses 2/3 cup milk.  This recipe only makes an 8 inch square pan.  Secondly, there is not enough chocolate and or butterscotch chips to give the fudge flavor.  The marshmallow creme dominates, and while it is fluffy, the result is fudge that is too creamy, almost to the point of being sticky.  The fudge is a very whitish brown, and has little chocolate flavor.  I will not make this fudge again.

Very nice recipe and easy to modify based on types of chips you use.  Taste was a little too butterscotch for me, so next time I would use more chocolate and less butterscotch. This fudge was very, very soft and creamy and if you like your fudge that way then you'll love this recipe. I like my fudge creamy, but a little firmer so I would suggest increasing the amount of chips you use to 2 cups. Will make this again, but next time will try using Nestle milk chocolate/caramel chip swirls and semi-sweet chips to make a "turtle" fudge.

Wonderful! I agree with SweetTooth that the butterscotch taste dominates. We plan on making this again today and using all chocolate morsels. My hubby made this entirely by himself so I rate it a 5 for ease! It set up beautifully.

Did not set up - the consistancy was similar to the inside of a 3 Muskateers bar - soft and fluffy.  Taste was fine, though.

I loved the flavor, but didnt like the consistancy as it never seemed to set up right.  Next time I will try some of the other users' suggestions and increase the amount of chocolate or decrease the amount of milk.

the first time I made this I used all semi-sweet chocolate chips, and the texture was very soft.  This time I doubled the amount of chips and again used all semi-sweet, I thought the texture was much better.  Yum

Very nice fudge. I like how airy and creamy it is. I also love the chocolate-butterscotch combination. I left out the nuts. Next time I might increase the chocolate chips and decrese the butterscotch chips.

Mmmmmm! This was so creamy! I altered the recipe though. I doubled the chocolate chips and only used half of the butterscotch (because i don't really like butterscotch) and it turned out AMAZINGLY! So chocolatey and rich.

My coworkers loved this. I made them with and without pecans for those allergic to nuts. It really isn't that hard either. Probably the most time-consuming part is cutting all of the little squares.

I am no an experienced fudge maker. I decided to try this recipe because it sounded simple for a beginner, the only exception changing out the butterscotch for white chocolate chips. Although the flavor was good, the fudge never hardened properly. It was a mush stuck to the foil. My husband called it fudge icecream because of the constistency.

I have had my eye on this recipe for quite awhile now, and decided to make this for a holiday function.  After reading several reviews, I did make a few changes.  I cut the butterscotch chips to 1/2 cup and upped the chocolate chips to 1 cup.  Lastly, I added the pecans on top, and only to half the pan, in case of allergies or a dislike of nuts.  The texture of this fudge is wonderful, creamy, and melt-in-your- mouth.  The butterscotch flavor was just a little too strong for me, even with the reduced amount, and makes for a very sweet fudge.  If you love butterscotch, you will love this fudge!

I don't know how it happened, but I forgot to put in the marshmallow creme.  The recipe still turned out great!  It set just fine, and the flavor is good.

If you like butterscotch this is good, but I found that it was not everyone's favorite flavor.  It was last to be eaten up.  My children were not crazy about this.

I made enough of this recipe over the Christmas holiday, for us and to give to friends. Sure enough, it was VERY easy to make.   Not only was it delicious, but got rave reviews from my friends!  This one is a keeper!  Thanks Elisa!

This is way tooo sweet.  Think of pure frosting and add about two cups of sugar to it.  The recipe can be modified but as written, disgusting.  I had bought all the ingredients so I took it to my Christmas party anyways and I had to laugh as people took their first bite of fudge and had horrible expressions on their face.  Do not waste your time with this recipe.

This fudge is GREAT! I made it last year for the holidays, and it was always gobbled up. It's an easy recipe that can be varied according to taste, which I LOVE! The family can't wait for this year's batch!

This fudge was amazing. This is the first time I have gotten the consistency right for fudge. My question is does anyone have any suggestions on how to keep this consistency but give it more of a maple flavour. My  boyfriend really likes the taste of maple fudge. Thanks

have made fudge.  This was easy and I served it at 3 of our Christmas parties and everyone

This went into my favorite recipe book.  linnie

I don't usually like fudge with nuts but I adore pecans so trying this one was obvious.  I'm glad I did.  The double chip combination is nice, too.

Made this exactly per the directions.  Tastes okay but came out much stickier than a previous batch with another recipe.  Marshmallow creme seems to encompass more of the texture of the fudge which makes it as sticky as it is and also made it more difficult to cut into pieces.  Try using a non-stick spray on your knife before trying to cut it down if you experience a "sticky" batch like I did.

I have been making this recipe for at least 40yrs...the only thing I do different is the chocolate...1 bag of semi sweet chocolate chips, and 8 regular size Hershey bars. It sets up perfect every time. I've never tried butterscotch...maybe this year!!

I thought this was a very creamy and light fudge. I did use a candy thermometer after reading several reviews and cooked until soft ball stage. My husband loved it but my daughter (the purist) wants a pure chocolate fudge so I will make another batch using dark chocolate morsels for the holidays.

Easy to follow recipe.  Made a huge mess.  Didn't set.  EVER.  Didn't taste like fudge.  Just a weak mess of goo.  Now all that time and ingredients wasted.  Maybe I'll freeze it and use it as icing for a cake, except it's sticky.

I followed the instructions, but used all chocolate chips, no butterscotch chips, as several reviewers did.  I removed the pan from the burner, added the marshmallow creme, added the chocolate chips, and they seized up in less than the time it took to stir the mix twice with a wooden spoon (6 seconds, maybe). Chocolate concrete! The butter was oozing out of the mix and settled in a film on the top.  I pushed  the mix into an 8X8 dish, and when it was cool, I chiseled it into little, grainy blocks.  Despite the appearance, it tasted good.  That's why I gave it 2 stars.

This was my first attempt at fudge-making. I followed the measurements and directions exactly, just used Peanut butter chips instead of butterscotch chips. It turned out perfectly, very delicious, perfect fudge texture, not crumbly at all (I dislike crumbly fudge). Great, easy recipe!

This fudge is SOOOOOO good! I don't have a candy thermometer and this fudge turned out PERFECT. I store it in the fridge, which I think helps it keep a firmer, yet still creamy consistency. My husband keeps raving about it. This is my very first time making fudge and I am very pleased. I can't stop eating it!!! I did take the advice of some of the other reviewers and used just about a quarter cup less evap. milk and I didn't have enough choco. chips so I added cocoa powder. DELICIOUS!
