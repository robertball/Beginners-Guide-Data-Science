This was a very tasty stir fry, however, don't make the same mistake I did.  I used purple cabbage and the leftovers turned blue!

We thought this was very tasty! I did use some frozen stir fry veggies instead of chopping and I used 1 TBLS brown sugar and 1 TBLS white sugar when making the sauce and ommitted the salt (always can be added to taste if needed). The brown sugar, even though it was just a tbls, added a nice touch. Served over white rice and some chow-mein noodles. Very good and would make again. Thanks!

The sauce was way, way too sweet. And 2 tablespoons of cornstarch was way too much. A tablespoon would've been plenty. Also, a true stir fry would brown the chicken, take the chicken out of the pan, then cook the onion and other vegetables. After the veggies are done, that's when you'd add the chicken back in so you don't end up with overcooked chicken.

Even my son liked this(and he says he doesn't like onions).  I used about half the green onions and regular onions that this recipe called for.  I also used about a 1/2 tsp of ground ginger instead of the fresh ginger. Good basic stir fry.

This was perfect. Easy and quick to make I did not use cabbage added brocolli and thinly sliced carrots. Stir fried it all in the wok and served over sticky rice

This recipe turned out just great.  The chicken and veggies tasted great, and the sauce had perfect flavor and consistency.  I will definitely make this again, and may add some hot pepper flakes for some added spice.

This was quite good.  We like a little more "kick" to our Asian food but I am a stickler for following a recipe as written the first time (doesn't it just make you crazy when people trash a recipe and talk about what they didn't do?).  The next time I will likely spice it up a little and maybe add some additional veggies.  Thank you for a great post! i

This is a great stir-fyr recipe.. I used fresh broccoli, carrot, and asparagus; no bell pepper or pea pods, and it came out really good.  Everything was cooked perfectly and very flavorful.  I used left over rice pilaf from last night to make the "fried rice restaurant style" recipe (on allrecipes.com)-- my toddlers had seconds and my husband loved it.

i added philliapino wheat noodles(after following pkg directions), water chestnuts, bamboo shoots, chinese 5 spice powder in place of ginger, and soy to taste. Also added chinese hot oil on top as a personal preference to spicy food(use sparingly!)  IT WAS EXCELLENT!  I made it as a friend's bday present and she was VERY pleased, she ate the leftovers the following day and said it was still very VERY scrumptious!

This was incredible!  My whole family loved it.  I changed the vegetables to ones that my kids and husband like better.  But otherwise, I follwed directions to a T.
I served it over brown rice.  Great, healthy meal!

This is one of the better stir fry dishes I have made.  I only made small changes.  I added mushrooms and instead of putting the ginger and green onion with the chicken and vege mix, I added it to the sauce instead.  I made it easy on myself and saut√©d all the veges together in olive oil.  Once tender, I added the chicken for about 5 min, then put in the sauce mixture until  it thickened.  Excellent and so easy!!

This is a very tasty recipe.  I suggest that you have everything measured, chopped and diced before begining. It is a speedy meal once you begin. My family thought that the sauce was as good as any Chinese take out we have had. Cut back on the sugar if you like the robust soy taste.  Thank you. "1 more for my collection."

Nice flavor - made with tofu marinated in sauce and no cornstarch. Added broccoli and carrot. Next time I'll double the sauce and add pepper and fresh chopped garlic at the end, for more of a garlic pepper dish (my favorite).

I was searching the site and came across this recipe, my dad is in this cooking in the wok phase so I gave him this recipe. EVERYONE in my house loved it, including the picky sister who won't eat anything. The best part, everyone keeps begging him to make it again! Perfect recipe!

This recipe is more soupy and bland than I had expected. It's not real stir-fry, but it's a good start for people who like to tone down their Chinese food. I'm actually Chinese, and this tastes nothing like the stir-fry my Mom used to make or anything that is served in good Chinese restaurants. Not that the recipe isn't good, just not what I expected for stir-fry. Very easy to make though.

Good.....2 out of 3 enjoyed it and took leftovers for lunch....used reduced sodium soy sauce and used olive oil and some sesame oil instead of the peanut oil. Also used Truvia non sugar sweetner instead of the sugar (about 2 packets) Quick and easy.

I thought that this was delicious! It was easy to make too! Tasted like the garlic chicken I get at my fav chinese take out place- only better!I omitted the cabbage and green onions (didn't have these on hand) and used broccoli and carrots, snow peas, 1 onion and red bell pepper. I thought that it was a perfect amount of garlic and ginger, but my young kids did think it was a bit too spicy, so next time I'll use a little less. I'll definately make this again!

I used sliced pork instead of the chicken since that is what I had on hand, and it turned out great....the basic sauce is very versatile and I use it for all sorts of stir-fry ingredients.  This recipe forms the base for many meals in my house each month!  :)  Excellent!

This is a great recipe.  I couldn't believe how well it turned out.  Even the kids liked it.  One tip for you though.  Prepare (chop, measure, mix) everything before you turn on the heat.  Once you start cooking, you won't have time to do anything else.

Wow! What a great recipe, even for those of us who are not very wok-inclined (like myself).  I used what I had on hand for veggies(broccoli, carrots, snowpeas, red and green bell pepper), and followed the recipe instructions exactly.  The only adjustment I made was to reduce the sugar to 2 tsp. from 2 Tbsp.  The sauce thickened very well and was so tasty!  My husband gave this a thumbs up so its a keeper! Thank you!!

Awesome dish! Very flavorful and wound up feeding 6 people (5 adults and a 3 yr old) with enough leftover for 2 lunches! and while I was worried about all the garlic, it works out perfectly. Three changes due to what we had in the house and the number of people coming over: I used 2 bell peppers (1 red and 1 orange) and half a bag of broccoli slaw instead of the cabbage and peas and sesame seed oil as we didn't have peanut oil. Served over brown rice. Will definitely be making again!

When I make this the sauce is the most consistent thing I follow. I do add a little honey in the skillet when it's almost ready to serve instead of sugar in the cornstarch mix. Vegetables I use are generally what I have on hand. I don't use cabbage or sugar snap peas when cooking for my husband. When cooking for friends who like them - I add peas and cabbage. Sometimes I have this on rice, sometimes on chow mien noodles, sometimes all by itself (avoiding starch calorie load). Of the chicken things I make, this is one of the better picks that works for my picky husband who is not such a fan of vegetables. My husband wants more sauce ‚Äì so I will make a note to help me remember - more sauce, cause so far I haven‚Äôt‚Äô remembered!

I didn't use cabbage and I used ginger powder and everyone raved over this.  It's so easy but there is time in cutting up the veggies.  Well worth it!

Edit: Double sauce (for our family of 7) and add extra garlic. Add some rice wine vinegar and a good bit of red pepper flake to taste. Cook beef to med. rare first and remove it from pan. Boil carrots for a long time and then add large broccoli florets if using fresh, boil until you smell the broccoli. Drain water from skillet and add cabbage and more garlic. Then slowly start adding the mixed sauce (don't bother separating broth from the rest of the sauce) and by the time the cabbage is wilted add all of the sauce. Very good this way!

Very tasty, my whole family enjoyed it.  I did not have all of the vegetables the recipe called for on hand so I just used a bag of defrosted stir fry vegetables.

I really like this recipe. I pounded the chicken breasts to speed up the cooking process and putting the chicken in the freezer for 15 minutes prior to slicing makes cutting the slices a snap! I also prefer using low/no salt chicken stock since the soy sauce has plenty of salt. For the ginger I have been purchasing: "ginger in a tube" and it requires no extra work. If you really like using fresh ginger for recipes, remove the peel with a small spoon or even a grapefruit spoon which has ridges. Fresh ginger can be frozen for future use.

Really guys?  This was just a run-of-the-mill stir fry recipe, nothing more or less...and nothing to write home about.  It was bland (other than the garlic).  For someone not seasoned in using a wok I can see why it might be a desireable recipe to follow; however, for most folks who have moved on beyond basic stir frys, this one will leave you wanting more.  

My two cents, your mileage may vary.

Excellent recipe, can be modified very easily and will still turn out great.  I used different vegetables, doubled the sauce using 4 TBSP's of brown sugar and 6 TBSP's of soy sauce to cut down on the sweetness.

This is a good basic stir fry recipe for the beginner. Build off of this, as it is rather bland as previously stated, and experiment with different veggies etc.

I absolutely loved this recipe.  The sauce is so flavorful!  The only things I changed were that I used roasted, dried ginger (all I had on hand), substituted a sweet onion for the green onions (again, what I had on hand) and brown sugar instead of white sugar.  I don't think these changes alter the flavor enough to not give the original recipe a fantastic rating. Next time I will double the sauce, and cut the sugar in half (was a tad sweet, but still worthy of 5 stars).  This is just a personal taste thing.. I like the sweet and savory, but plan to try a little less sugar and see how that works.  This sauce would be wonderful with shrimp too...

Just made this and made the following changes. I used only one onion. I used half brown sugar, half white.
I had forgotten to add the cabbage when directed and added later. I liked that the cabbage was al dente and lent a slight crunch to the meal.   My 16 year old son and husband ate the entire batch in one sitting. Thanks!

I made this recipe and didn't eat it. I think it is a disservice to criticize a recipe if the ingredient list is altered and/or prepared differently. I knew 2T of sugar was wrong... I knew 2T of cornstarch was wrong... 2 onions PLUS a BUNCH of green onions? I am often confused and don't understand people's pallets

Full of flavor!  I used 4 cups of Yin Yang vegetable blend from Market Day in place of the cabbage, red bell pepper and sugar snap peas.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. Will make again and again.

This was quick easy and tastey. It lacked a bit of flavor, it could have been b/c I didn't use peanut oil. I will definately make this again, but with peanut oil.

Very good recipe.  I doctored up the spices a bit, dropped the cabbage, and added more veggies, substituting green beans for the sugar snaps.  Thanks, Teresa!

This was very good.  My wok was at the cleaners, so I had to use an old lead pot from my plumbing days, but it turned out OK!;) I think that if someone goes to the trouble of posting a recipe that commenters should try to replicate it exactly - the first time - and make changes later.  AND, if you didn't like the recipe then you should feel free to keep it to yourself!!  Good job Teresa!!!

I tried this tonight and thought it was pretty good. However I learned fresh ginger is a must. I used frozen ginger. I think the right amount of spice is the key.

Loved it. We love asparagus so I used that instead of peas. Also doubled the sauce but cut the sugar by 1/4. It was great.

This was absolutely delicious!! I didn't think I was capable of cooking great chinese food.. This recipe definitely proved me wrong! I did not use the ginger and I switched up the vegetables, but other than that this recipe is a gem that I will continue to use.

Quite tasty. I love garlic and so added a couple of extra cloves!! I opted to use broccoli, mushrooms, red peppers, and cabbage along with the onions and added some chili paste as I like it hot. Next time, I'll add cashews or peanuts!

This is a good recipe. Very flavorful. However, you have to be careful not to cook the vegetables too long otherwise they get limp and aren't as crisp.  Also next time, I don't think I will use all the sauce as it got too liquidy and became more of a soup than a stir fry. I will make it again and serve the sauce on the side and perhaps steam the vegetables in a seperate pan.

For my birthday last week I received a wok.  Well that opens up a whole new world to my kitchen.  I told my fiance we were going on an Asain trip so have his chop sticks ready!  I love cooking new things.  I invited over three guests and let us just say this was a huge hit!  Everyone loved it.  I omitted the cabbage (yuck) and substituted mushrooms.  Yummy!  I will be making this again.  Thanks!

The recipe was simple and delicious.  I had a large variety of veggies due to our garden, so we used onion, peppers, broccoli, cauliflower, green beans, and carrots.  I also added some red pepper for a bit of spice.  My kids loved it.  I even went well as leftovers.

simple and quick recipe. added in fresh, sliced vegetables -- yellow and green onions, mushrooms and carrots. marinated cubed chicken breasts and a handful of shrimp in some soy sauce, pepper and 1 teaspoon of ground ginger (not fresh). i browned the garlic first in some peanut oil, removed it and added it to the chicken and shrimp. then cooked all my other vegetables with a dash of soy sauce and removed them to a plate, while i cooked the chicken and shrimp mixture. then added the vegetables back in and let sit while i made some five minute rice. i used only about 1 tablespoon of soy sauce for the "sauce" with the cornstarch, sugar and water mixture since i'd added soy to the vegetables and meat before. i enjoyed this, but next time i'll omit the ginger since i didn't really think it added anything to the dish flavor.

I thought this sounded very good, but I felt that it was a little to bland.  I did experiment by adding: brocolli, mushrooms, waterchesnuts, sprouts, and red peppers.  It was an enjoyable meal

This was easy and quick but a bit bland. On my second attempt I added 2 tsp of the Chinese hot oil and that helped but was still missing something and this was using the potent fresh Christopher Ranch Garlic here in Gilroy.

I used a vegetarian product called Veat instead of the chicken in this dish.  I found the sauce to be too bland, so I added about another half cup of vegetable broth to dilute the soy flavor, and then added a tablespoon or so of lemon juice, another tablespoon of sugar, crushed red pepper flakes, and about a tablespoon of freshly grated ginger.  This recipe was good with some doctoring!

A very good recipe.  I added a little bit of Cayenne pepper, which gave it just the right kick!

Loved this recipe!  So versatile because you can use your favorite veggies instead of the ones listed here.  My hubby doesn't like Snap peas or peppers, so I used mushrooms and carrots.  I'm going to use broccoli next time.  I also used the advice of another rater and used 1/2 tsp of ground ginger.  Can't wait to make again!! No going out for chinese anymore.. YEA! (and  you can use minced garlic instead of fresh, too).  

OH! I don't own a wok, so I started everything in a skillet, but once I started putting in cabbage and onions I realized it all wouldn't fit, so I just transferred it all into a pot, stirred to make sure it was all coated with the chicken broth and put the top on just like the recipe said. And I used sesema oil because I had bought it for another recipe from this website and hate to see it not used. It was GREAT! (makes the house smell great, too)

Wonderful ! We both loved it and are looking forward to the leftovers. We served it over a bed of Jasmine rice, Substituted 1/2 of the sugar with light brown sugar as one reviewer suggested. We had a piece of beef tenderloin leftover and I sliced it and added it to the chicken, wonderful mixture of flavors with none overpowering another. I also used fresh snow peas instead of frozen.

This was a very good recipe! It's also a quick meal to make. We all liked it and I can tell you that next time I make it I will use more veggies than the recipe calls for, especially when they are in season :-) Bulk this up with lots of veggies!! Thanks for a good recipe to have!

Very good!  Hubby, 2 year old, and myself all liked it.  I didn't have peanut oil, so I used sesame oil.  Also substituted extra red peppers and carrots instead of onions, cabbage, and peas because that was what was in the house.  The sauce was very good and I think the extra cornstarch making it extra thick was a nice touch.  Some people had said it was bland, so I was prepared to add extra soy sauce, but I didn't think it was necessary.  Very tasty and I will make it again.

This was very good. I used about 4 cloves of garlic and it was fine... Also, used whatever veggies I had on hand. I think that is what is great about this recipe is that your can adapte to what meat/veggies you have. The sauce was tasty without being salty or heavy! I doubled the sauce and didn't need to. Next time I wont. Served over white rice. Nice healthy dinner!

I made this for myself and two teenage boys and we really enjoyed it! I followed the recipe closely, making a few changes based on what I had in the house. I didn't have any peanut oil so I substituted canola oil with a splash of sesame oil. I also used a bag of frozen stir fry veggies along with the fresh green onions. Served over rice and it was great - nothing left over!

It was very tasty and could work well with a variety of veggies. I used peas instead of snap peas and 2 cups sliced cabbage. As directed, the recipe makes a little more sauce than we liked, so next time I'll either make less sauce or serve it over rice.

Excellent stir fry....I did make a few changes. I eliminated the salt, I didn't have peanut oil so I used sesame oil instead.  I also used fresh broccoli instead of cabbage, one large onion instead of two and I used about a tablespoon of brown sugar instead of white since I don't like things too sweet.  One tablespoon of cornstarch was enough.  I added water chestnuts as well since my husband loves them. I cooked the chicken in my wok first, took it out then did the veggies.  I combined everything at the end.  I will definitely make this again.

I didn't have green onions or cabbage OR snap peas so I used the emergency bag of frozen stir fry veggies and it still turned out great.  Can't wait to try with bok choi and proper veg, will probably get 6 or 7 stars then!  Really good stuff, easy and tasty.

Too sweet, too bland, and the sweetness took away from the garlic.  Next time I'll leave out the sugar and ginger, and add some chilis, but as that is basically a completely different recipe, I'm giving this a 1 star.

I made this with tofu and changed the sauce a bit, and overall I liked it. My only complaint was that there was way too much onion, so you have to cut back on that.

Very yummy. I reduced the ginger, since my fiance is not fond of it, and will reduce the amount of chicken next time since it seemed a bit much--but that's our taste.

I doubled the recipe and added 7 minced Thai peppers.  I used carrots and broccoli because that is what I had around. I reduced the sugar just a tad and added one Tablespoon of fish sauce to the corn starch mixture.  It was excelent resturant quality.

This was my first time making a stir fry and I was very pleased with how simple, quick and healthy it was!  I used pork instead of chicken and dredged it in cornstarch instead of putting cornstarch in at the end.  This worked out nicely.  Also, I used a frozen bag of stir fry veggies (sugar snap peas, carrots, onions, mushrooms, yellow peppers and water chestnuts) because it was cheaper to just buy that, and because my boyfriend likes it hot, I mixed in about four teaspoons of green curry paste with the last addition of broth.  Unfortunately, the HOT taste kind of overpowered the other flavors, but the ginger taste still shined through.  Thank you very much for this good recipe, next time I'll try it as written instead of adding in the curry paste.

I followed this recipe by the directions only I had no peas so I sliced up some carrot instead.  After I had mixed the sauce in I added a 440g packet of thin egg noodles.  This garlicy noodle stir fry was a treat for our entire family.  Thanks.

So bland.  I used bok choy as my cabbage and followed the recipe exactly.  I thought that this was very bland.  It is a good thing that I had terryaki sauce on hand so that I could spruce it up. Will not make this again.

Excellent!  I omitted the chicken and added broccoli florets with the red pepper. I also added 3 more cloves of garlic and I ended up adding about 1/4 cup more of vege broth just to make it saucier.   It was better than most Chinese restaurant dishes I've had!  Definitely a keeper!

This was very good.  I did not use near the garlic that it called for though.

My seven year old like it.  But he likes stir fries normally.

This is a good recipe to experiment with.  You may want to add a few more vegetables or add somethings to the sauce to suit your taste, but overall this is a good recipe.

This stir fry was a big hit with my family. After reading the other reviews, I decided to adjust the recipe and only use   half the amount of onion and sugar. I will definitely be making this again!

I have tried at least a hundred All Receipes recipes, and been very happy with my results almost always.  This one was so good though, that I had to write a review to rave about it!  So delicious!  My husband and kids had not just seconds, but thirds!!  Delicious!!  Add some Sriracha to add some heat!!

Great taste and very easy to make.  My husband and I did cut down on the garlic a tad and put more sugar snap peas, but it was excellent.  Yummy!

Just made this tonight and we both really liked the flavours but the sauce thickened way too fast so there was not enough to moisten the rice. Next time I will use more liquids and two Tbsp of cornstarch or just less cornstarch, but I wanted to make it exactly as the recipe was written. I do take my Chicken out after cooking it so it doesn't get over cooked.then I cook the veggies and then add chicken and sauce back in. All in all a very tasty recipe!

Used zucchini, mushrooms, green bell pepper, carrots and broccoli. I accidentally added the foods in the wrong order, but I think what really matters in this recipe is the large amount of garlic (I minced a whole bulb and added 2 tsp of crushed garlic) and the corn starch/sugar/soy sauce mixture. I love that I don't have to use the packets that are full of synthetic ingredients and can give my family something more healthy but still delicious!

versatile recipe..mix and match veggies. Double the sauce so you have extra for the rice to absorb (assuming you serve on rice).

Use whatever veggies you have. Used half olive and half sesame oil. Other than that pretty much followed the recipe. Excellent, thanks.

Great recipe! The only changes I made were from lack of ingredients: I used two tbsp. of flour instead of cornstarch, veg. oil instead of peanut oil (enough to stir fry the vegetables... more than 2 tbsp.,) no green onions, half a large yellow onion instead of two, cut fresh carrots in place of the sugar snap peas and a can of mushrooms instead of the cabbage. I put this over some white rice and my husband and I devoured it! Double the recipe if you want leftovers or if you have more than two grown adults to feed. Thankfully, my LO is only 8 months and it was just enough for the two of us!

Good basic stir fry recipe. I really liked the sauce - only changes I made were decreasing the amount of sugar and corn starch to 1 TB each. I served on top of white rice, and there was enough sauce to drench the rice. Very versatile and you can throw in whatever veggies you have on hand - today I used cabbage, onions, and bell peppers, but I could see this working well with broccoli, carrots, bean sprouts, etc.

Really, really good. Better than any chinese take-out I can get in my area- and healthier too. Changed up the veggies to be broccoli, asparagus, carrots. Diced 1/2 of a yellow onion. The green onion gets lost if you add it early in the cooking process- maybe sprinkle on towards the end. Have all the ingredients ready to go before cooking. Made it in a skillet on the stove. Pre-cooked chicken tenders in the oven and added them at the end just to warm. Easy, fast, and really good.

I followed recipe completely except I added mushrooms. I liked it for its vegetable and chicken count, but the sauce was not very flavorful. I think I will keep this recipe on hand though, and add the sauce for the Spicy Sweet Sticky Chicken on this site instead. That said, thank you for uploading.

This was Delicious, I used sweet onions, didn't have green onions and brown sugar instead of white. I added fresh green and red peppers and frozen stir fry vegetables. The sauce had a smooth consistency and light tasting , will definitely make again .

I've made this as directed and then I've had to vary slightly because I was missing some ingredients.  Overall this recipe is a hit with the entire family.  Use the base sauce and change up the veggies based on what you have and you can't go wrong!  Serve over some fresh steamed rice and you have a great meal.

I made this recipe twice. To the "t", the dish is slightly bland, lacking flavor, and the vegetables get mushy. However, with a few changes the second time, it comes out very delicious. I added more spices for one thing, double just about all of them as well as adding about 2 tsp crushed red pepper flakes. Also, i fully cooked the chicken before adding the vegetables. I left out peas and a few other veggies, just using broccoli, bell pepper, and onions. I also added more spices to the sauce for extra flavor. yum!

I love this recipe! I used a yellow pepper, broccoli, green beans, mushrooms, and shredded carrots for the stir fry. I didn't alter it aside from choosing my veggies, I really liked not having to use a pre-made sauce for the stir fry. :)

One of my favorites with suggestions made by others (double the sauce, half white and half brown sugars, half the corn starch, be flexible with the vegetables, two additional cloves of garlic) and my own.  My sixteen year old son devoured it and said it tasted like I bought it at a restaurant.  A number of reviewers complain about it being too bland.  I found the same and added half tablespoon of hoisin sauce.  That's what put it over the top.

I had high hopes but it was just ok... It was edible because of the veggies and chicken but the flavor of the sauce was so bland... I don't think I used enough garlic because I went with the jar stuff.  Oh well!

This is a great stir fry recipe! I made it for me & my boyfriend last night, and we both loved it. It tasted like real Chinese take-out, only healthier and none of the chicken was sketchy. I followed this recipe pretty much exactly, with only a few small changes: used sesame oil instead of peanut oil, added about half the onion, subbed broccoli for the cabbage, added sliced carrots, and only used 1 Tbsp of sugar in the sauce. It came out perfect - the sauce was delicious, and there was just the right amount of it. Served over brown rice. I will make this again and again, trying different veggies and maybe even pork or tofu sometime.

Family liked it, but I agree with another reviewer:  the sauce is WAY too thick!  I cut down the cornstarch to 1.5 tbsp., increased chicken broth to 1.5 cups.  Good served over rice noodles.

This recipe is so versatile and so good! Half way through making it I realized I was missing many of the ingredients, and it still turned out great with all my substitutions. Here's what I didn't have so left it out: chicken broth, regular onion, cabbage, snap peas, peanut oil and fresh ginger. Here's what I used instead: water, carrot, garlic oil and dried ginger. All other ingredients I had and used, loved the sauce, served over sticky rice.

I cant give it five stars as I did not make it exactly as written. I only changed two things - I did not use peanut oil and instead used olive oil and changed the types of veggies to suit the tastes of those in the house. We all loved it. I have never made a sauce like this before so ended up adding too much corn starch and ended up then thinning it back out with more chicken broth but it still turned out good. Love recipes like this where it is easy to make your own changes but still keep the recipe!

Very good basic recipe but perhaps a bit sweet for me. Next time I will reduce the sugar by about half. Also, important to note that if you are using frozen vegetables (I had a stir fry package that I threw in), you should cut the amount of liquid added by a little. I used the full amount and the frozen vegetables made this a bit watery. Overall a great recipe.

FABULOUS!  Definitely hit the spot and reminded me the chicken stir fry I order at the local chinese restaurant.   I didn't have fresh garlic or ginger, only ground but it worked great.  I used bell pepper, broccoli, squash, onions, and carrots as the veggies.  The sauce is perfect!  It didn't look like much when I first mixed it but glad I didn't double it - it was the perfect amount.  

The only part that was unclear on the instructions to me is how long to let the veggies and chicken simmer in the broth.   Mine was probably around 10 or so minutes before the vegetables were the perfect texture.  

Loved this meal and will be making again!

Incredible flavor.  Entire family was surprised by this flavorful meal.  
As alluded to by others:
 Changes I made included slightly more garlic, fresh broccoli instead of cabbage, fresh haricot verte instead of peas, and 1/2 sugar was brown sugar.

Excellent recipe. I substituted brown sugar for the white sugar, as we like it a little sweeter and changed up the veggies - onions, carrots, and broccoli. This is a keeper!

This was amazing!  This recipe is definitely a keeper.  I did use ground ginger - about a teaspoon instead of the grating the fresh ginger.  It turned out perfect.  It's one of those dishes you keep wanting to eat and eat until it's all gone.  Everyone in the family liked it.

I am trying eat healthier so lately I have been on a stir fry kick . Loved this recipe. Only things I changed was I only used one sweet onion and doubled the sauce. So good I didn't need any rice or noodles. Good stuff and super easy!

Another winner from all recipes!!  Thank you Teresa!!  We loved it.  We were looking for something on the lighter side and this did the trick.  We like lots of flavor so i doubled the garlic and ginger.  We also used more cabbage but this is a versatile dish so any combination of veggies will do.  At the end topped it off with hot mustard and a little duck sauce.  Served over brown rice.

I substituted veggies - had celery and carrots with red pepper and cabbage.  DELICIOUS!  A definite keeper.

Very good. I did add some crushed red pepper for a little kick, but would have worked well without it. So good there were no left-overs...so sad! Will make a double batch next time.

Pretty good stir-fry.  To cut time, I used chicken which was previously boiled.  I didn't put in the fresh ginger because I did have any.  It was not missed.  I left out the cabbage and snap peas, which were replaced with broccoli.  The beauty behind a stir-fry is that they are very versatile!

this was a good recipe, but i find that if you add some chillie and tomatoes it makes it even better.

If I could give this 10 stars I would.  I doubled the sauce sauce...and added little bit of Honey Teriyake sauce to the chic broth.  FABULOUS!!! Thanks Teresa for posting!

This was excellent. It has a great garlic taste that's surpisingly not overpowering. I think the sugar in the sauce helps that. I added a few extra veggies, like mushrooms and carrots, and served it over rice. My sauce did come out rather soupy, so next time I'll forgo the broth you put in the pan and just use the sauce as is. Used brown sugar splenda in the sauce, since we're watching our sugar intake around here. Couldn't tell the difference. Excellent stir-fry!

Excellent tasting. I added even more garlic (since I'm a total fan) along with some extra ginger. Neighbors loved it as well and wanted the recipe. :)

Wow, what an easy, beautiful, tasty meal. This has now become a family favorite.  The only thing that I changed with this recipe is I double up on the sauce.  I sent this recipe in an email recipe swap and the lady sent me a thank you telling me how wonderful it was.  I told her where I found the recipe...so thanks soooo much for sharing!!!

i loved this recipe!!  i did reduce the amount of sugar as others suggested.  also, i stir-fried the chicken for about 3 minutes each side, then cooked in an oven-safe pan at 300 degrees for 10 minutes.  after removing from the oven, i added peppers and covered for another 6-7 minutes.  then added the liquid, slow simmered, and finally added my steamed sugar snap peas and carrots.  my super picky boyfriend gave me a HUGE TWO thumbs up!!!  That means this recipe rocked!

I made this twice using whatever veggies I had around.  The first time I did the sauce as outlined and found it a little plain for my taste so the next time I added red pepper flakes, extra garlic and 1/2 a jalapeno.  It was fabulous and better than what you get in a chinese restaurant!  Definitely a regular dinner from now on!

This recipe was absolutely delicious!!! It was also very easy to make. I am 13 and this was my first time cooking Chinese food  and i was so happy with the result!!! The one thing I did was add a green and a yellow bell pepper to the ingredients and it added some crunch in the sauce!!! I LOVED THIS DISH, IT IS DEFINITELY A KEEPER!!!

This is so yummy.  I doubled the sauce and used the veggies that I wanted rather than what was written, but it couldn't have been better.  My hubby loved it and he is pickier than the kids.  
I think next time I am going to try throwing all of the ingredients in a crockpot and letting it cook for a few hours.  This is easy to make, but a crockpot is even easier when you've got three toddlers.

I tripled the sauce and added hoisin sauce and honey in lieu of the sugar. I marinated the chicken in the sauce for two hours which really helped flavor the meat. Threw in a few more seasonings and served this over Ramen noodles. Good recipe Teresa and thank you!

Good--I doubled the sauce like someone else suggested.  I would use a little more chicken just because I like more protein.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was delicious! My daughter and I loved it and thought it was better than anything you might order at a Chinese restaurant. I didn't have some of the vegetables but did have a bag of stir-fry veggies so I used that instead and it turned out wonderful. Next time I make it I will add cashews. Thanks so much for a great recipe.

This was pretty good.  The veggies ended up a little soggy.  I would want to do something different with them next time, or maybe use a different kind.  Cut the sugar down to 1T.  Good flavor, overall, just could have used better texture.

I was in a hurry tonight and needed something fast and this recipe just fit the bill!  It didn't take long to prepare (with the chicken and veggies already cut up) and it was very, very good.  I left out the cabbage because I had enough other cut up veggies to put in.  The garlic and the ginger really give this a nice flavor.  I surely will be making this again.

Had to thin the sauce down a little; added some additional sesame glaze sauce for flavor. I wasn't overwhelmed by this but nice as a change of pace with some additions.

With the exception of substituting the cabbage for broccoli, I followed this recipe to the letter. The flavor was so-so and there was not enough sauce and it was too thick.
I am going to try it again, but I will add a 1/4 cup of sherry and atleast 1/2 cup more chicken broth, more garlic and perhaps some red pepper flakes.

This recipe was very fresh and healthy tasting...but lacked the asian flavor I was looking for.  Also, my garlic got quite blackened when I put it into the smoking oil.  The oil splattered all over the place when I began to add the ingredients.  Just a warning to anyone who makes this!

This  is similar to  many others I see out there. Many changes can be made to tweak it.

The image -photo of this dish above. Looks like leftovers put  onto a plate. Nothing looks fresh and vibrant. 

Thanks as always. Robert Martin

I specifically joined so I could write a review. This recipe sounded wrong when I read it but decided to give it a try against my better judgement...based on the very high reviews. This is not a stir-fry. It's devoid of flavor, is way too sweet and watery. The stir-fry method is incorrect because the chicken should have been removed and then added back in at the end. THE WORST!!!

This was easy and tasted great!  I didn't have the snap peas, so I subbed edemame  and mushrooms.  The sauce is perfect!  I thought the garlic was a little too much, but I really try to make recipes as written the first time, so I went with it and I'm glad I did.  It's great as is.  I will use this recipe again and again - with lots of different vegetables and I know it will be just as good!  I did sprinkle a little crunchy chow mein noodles on top and served it on a bed of rice with a little of the raw shredded napa cabbage on the side for extra crunch - it was great!

My husband wanted stir fry so I looked at All Recipes and found this one. It was amazing. My husband helped me cut up the veggies and chicken. There were just a couple things I did differently.  I used avocado oil because I didn't have any peanut oil. I also did not add any cabbage.  I made it with brown rice just because it is better for you. My husband loves spice so he added his Sirrachi sauce. I sprinkled just a little bit of red pepper flakes. We loved it and is was very easy!!

Good start for stir fry. Just a start though. Not lots
of flavor, and veg all turns color in end. Veg is better with color it, I like the system.

Excellent for all garlic lovers.  The only change I made was to halve the sugar.  Next time I'll omit it as I prefer to taste tanginess of vegies.  Also I didn't have peanut oil but olive oil worked well.  Thanks Teresa.

My husband and I really liked this meal.  My children chose to pick out all the veggies.  Otherwise, they ate the chicken and the rice that I served it over.  Next time, I'll use less sliced sweet onion (I'm the only one who likes it) and omit the cabbage.  However, I'll keep the red pepper and sugar snap peas.  I'd like to try adding blanched broccoli and maybe some zucchini and/or mushrooms.  I might even add some toasted cashews.  Maybe try a tad bit less sugar, too.

My husband loved this and I thought it was pretty good (I'm not a big stir fry fan to begin with, but that's just personal taste preference).  I used organic canola oil instead of peanut oil, reduced some of the onions as my husband is picky, used Bragg's Liquid Aminos, used honey instead of sugar and added a little bit more broth than directed.  With the substitutions I thought it was still pretty good.  I also added a tiny bit more corn starch to meet the extra chicken broth.   Everything turned out great.  Will definitely make it again!

My family really enjoyed this recipe. It's a lovely Americanized Chinese dish. And, honestly, who doesn't modify a dish, knowing their family's taste? I used a frozen stir fry I had on hand; steamed the veggies, and let them add as much as they wished to the chicken/sauce mixture. Doubled the sauce, as others did, and made it on the side, adding it in the final chicken stir fry stage. I used all the spices (only adding chili paste for a bit of zing), but modified to what my family liked. I used peanut oil; it has a flavor of its own. I served it on jasmine rice, but I can see it with any rice or noodle you might like.

I made this recipe and it was fabulous! I also, changed things up a little bit. I bought the bags of "smart" vegies, one bag of broccoli and one bag of the "stirfry" mix. I also did not have ginger root, I bought the squeeze tube in the produce section. At the end I sprinkled sesame seeds on it and stirred in some cashews. It was awesome!

This recipe is just plain good. I don't have any complaints or changes. I used broccoli instead of the peas just because my store was out. But it would have been good either way. I used a skillet not a wok but it worked just fine. I personally added chili sauce to the finished product but my husband doesn't like spice so left it out. He loved this dish too. I will make again probably this week since i have no use for cabbage. =)

Great recipe!   Followed the recipe except for a few changes because I didn't have a couple of ingredients.   It was still delicious!! Yummy!  Used olive oil instead of peanut oil, left out the green onions, left out cabbage, used 4 cloves of garlic instead of 6, added some broccoli crowns, and used 1 tablespoon cornstarch instead of 2.  The recipe would also be delicious if shrimp was substituted instead of chicken.  A keeper!

Nice recipe.  This dish is super sweet.  Way too sweet for our palate. Maybe next time I'd use just a quarter of the sugar.

This was by far the best stir fry ever!  I added broccoli and celery, and didn't use cabbage.  You could use anything you want though.  I thought the onions would be too much, but they aren't.  I would probably double the green onions and ginger next time.  I also doubled the sauce.  Excellent!!!!!

Thank you for posting this recipe. I followed it exactly- with the exception of doubling the sauce ingredients (only because we like extra sauce)and adding fresh chunks of pineapple.  It was delicious! We cleaned our plates! I will be making this one for company- everything was so fresh and tasty.  Great recipe!

This was very good. I thought the sauce was quite good. I think you need to use all the garlic and ginger in order to get the flavor into the sauce. I might put a touch more soy sauce into the sauce the next time, but this one is a keeper. I had three kids that never all seem to like the same thing and they all loved it!

yum yum yum. We used beef, beef stock, asparagus, onions, carrots, mushrooms, and red peppers. I added 1 1/2 of stock. I didn't have any ginger on hand and we added spaghetti noodles. Seriously good. The husband and baby both devoured it. Super easy and super delicious. Can't wait to make again and again!

I found the sauce a little bland. The only change I made, based on what I had on hand, was using sesame oil instead of peanut oil. I think it is a decent base recipe, but it was overshadowed by the "Fried Rice Restaurant Style" from this site that I made to accompany it.

We love Chinese and while I'm sure this  recipe is great as is...I did tweak it a little.  I made 1 1/2 times the sauce ingredients. I used broccoli, cashews, and water chestnuts in place of cabbage and peas..  I used all the green onions and one large yellow onion.  It is definately a "keeper" as we dub all good recipes we would like to have again!

Incredibly tasty and yet healthy.  Cut the starch down to 1T and the peanut oil to 1.5T...green bell pepper instead of red.  My husband rarely raves about a recipe, but did with this one.  With so little actual spices or soy, I was surprised the flavor came out so well.

This was awesome.  The only veggies I used were Broccoli and mushrooms.  Doubled the sauce so we had plenty for rice.  Will try other veggies next time.  Love love love the garlic flavor.

This was delicious! Just the right amount of garlic, ginger and soy sauce for us. Only thing I changed was using snow peas instead of sugar snap, and added green pepper as well. Will definitely make this again.

Hardest part was slicing the chicken! I used a bad asian veggie mix but I think that any veggie would do. This was absoultely fantastic. By far the best homemade chinese we have ever done. I am gonna be making this regularly...pretty much everytime a chinese craving hit! Thanks for a great recipe!!

This is a good recipe, but can become great with a few alterations.  You can easily double the amount of garlic and ginger.  I would also recommend marinating the chicken in the soy sauce mixture before throwing it in the pan.  Also, I used broccoli rather than cabbage.  I added two chopped jalapenos and bean sprouts.  We love things spicy, so we topped it off with some Sriracha hot chili sauce.   Once I did all of this, it was mmm mmm good!!

Great recipe!  Added bamboo shoots, water chestnuts and straw mushrooms.  Left out the cabbage, but only because others didn't want it.  Finished dish looks exactly like the photo uploaded.

Great recipe!  It was a little sweet from the sugar so I used double the soy sauce and tons of garlic and it turned out great!  I also used brown rice instead of white to make it a little more healthy.

Great sauce recipe- changed the veggies up a bit- used red peppers, sweet peas, broccoli, and both yellow and green onions.  Would use a little less yellow onion next time as it didn't cook down as much as I had hoped.  Substitute brown sugar for reg sugar and this meal is a hit!  Serve over brown rice.. mmmmm!

I am very pleased with this recipe. I have been searching for a good sauce like this for a long time & finally found it! I added a bit of hot sauce and cut the sugar in half and it was wonderful. I also skipped the cabbage and used broccoli. It is very versatile, can be used with many different combinations of veggies!

Has potential but would probably use different vegetables and use only about a quarter of the sugar next time.

I love using the basic ingredients of this recipe to create my own stir fry!  I do not care for chinese food much, but I do like the soy sauce flavor.  I basically use the chicken, whatever veggies I have around the the soy sauce mixture and serve it over some egg noodles.  It is a success at my house!

This is the best Stir Fry recipe I have made! I used a bag of frozen Asian veggies that you steam in the Microwave in place of chopping a lot of different ingredients. I steamed them in the microwave as I cooked the chicken. Then I added the hot veggies to the chicken, mixed the sauce ingedients together and stirred it all together until thick. The whole recipe was cooked in 10 min. My 4 year old and 2 year old LOVED it! Thanks for a great one.

I used this recipe primarily for the sauce, which turned out wonderfully! I made the sauce according to the recipe, but added about a 1/4 tsp of red pepper flakes to the broth that was used to steam/saute the veggies. My family loved it! I will definately make this again.

This was absolutely delicious!  I did increase the chicken to a pound and a half (just because my husband would rather see more meat than vegetables on his plate) and cut the onions to 1 instead of 2. The sauce was delicious and the fresh ginger really came through, but not overly so. I didn't double the sauce as others had suggested, but I think I might next time, since we prefer more sauce in our dishes rather than less.  I'm not sure why this recipe doesn't have 5 stars...I'd give it more if I could!

The sauce in this recipe is perfect the way it is, but I preferred to use brown sugar for a more earthy flavor. The combination of vegetables is very tasty. I had some asparagus that needed to be used up and tossed it into the mix. The chicken broth and garlic really enhanced the flavors. Thanks for sharing!

So easy & fast!  I loved the extra garlic.  I added some red pepper flake to raise the heat a touch.  I also added celery and green bell pepper for even more veggies.  Served over steamed white rice.  Hubby had 2 big helpings!

This was really good!  I added more garlic and cashews.  The veggies really need watching though - I trusted the times in the recipe and my vegetables were little soft for my taste.  Will do this again!

My husband and I really liked it. My 3 & 4 year old did not. I substituted bok choy for onion. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly as it is written.

I made this for some friends with help from a special friend of mine.

It turned out delicious. 

I used a few more cloves than the recipe called for and doubled it because of the amount of people. I would definitely cook this again.

I love this recipe. I think the key is the fresh ginger and peanut oil. Works great with frozen veggies, too, if you don't have fresh.

Better than take out...i served this over brown rice and it was very good but I think next time i will serve over chinese noodles because it tastes a lot like lo mein.  I sliiced and diced everything before hand and it was very easy to put together.  If you like your veggies on the crunchy side don't let it cook to long once you've added the sauce. All in all a VERY tasty dish...Thank you!

I use whatever vegetables are around and double the sauce because we love our stir fries saucy. Great over chinese noodles too! Try it with beef and beef broth too! This recipe has become a family favourite. Thanks!

Maybe I did something wrong, but I'm pretty sure I followed this recipe exactly and it didn't taste very "garlicky" at all.  It was okay as a basic stir fry, but nothing really special.  I might give it another chance eventually, but for the moment I'm sticking with my other stir fry recipes.

Flavor was great!  I added a bit more garlic because my husband and I like it so much.  This recipe is a good base recipe for stir fry - next time I think I will double the amount of chicken and I would like more veggies both in variety and in quantity.

Bland, boring taste.  I used bottled minced garlic and bottled minced ginger, so maybe fresh for each of those might have helped.  Be careful not to over cook the veggies or they get too soggy in the chicken stock.

The beauty of this is that you can use pretty much any veggies that you have on hand. I added in some sriracha for a bit of heat and it was very good! I will definitely make it again.

No changes, it tasted great and looked very good.  I really like to try new recipes and even better  if they  have an oriental  base.  My wife enjoys the fact that I  am doing some of the cooking.

Love this!   Very fresh and light dish.  Didn‚Äôt have peanut oil on hand so used EVOO.    For same reason, substituted some of the veggies.    Used red cabbage for color.    We love heat, but felt no need to add to this recipe.

My kids liked it, my husband was OK with it - he likes spicy, and this is fairly bland.  I didn't put in the green onions or my youngest would've spent her whole mealtime picking them out.  I used 2 lbs of chicken tenders, 1 onion, snow peas instead of snap peas, and only 1 tbl of sugar.  Very fresh and healthy.  I did like it, but I will look for some other sauce that will "punch" it up more.  But glad I found this to get me going on stir fry!

My family loved this! I have special dietary requirements. So I did have to modify the recipe. My family STILL loved it! Oh the joy of making one meal that pleases my family of Foodies!

Here is my version:
Garlic Chicken Stir Fry--

Ingredients
‚Ä¢	2 tablespoons EVOO
‚Ä¢	6 tsps garlic, minced
‚Ä¢	1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger (fresh is best, but substitute dry if that‚Äôs what is handy)
‚Ä¢	1 bunch green onions, chopped
‚Ä¢	1 teaspoon sea salt
‚Ä¢	4 boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into chunks
‚Ä¢	1 ¬Ω cups of chopped white onion
‚Ä¢	1 cup sliced cabbage or broccoli slaw
‚Ä¢	1 cup chicken broth
‚Ä¢	2 tablespoons *Coconut Aminos (substitute for soy sauce)
‚Ä¢	2 tablespoons *Swerve (natural substitute for sugar)
‚Ä¢	2 tablespoons *Arrowroot Powder (substitute for cornstarch)

Directions:
1.	Heat oil in a wok or large skillet on med heat. When oil is hot, quickly stir in 2 cloves minced garlic, ginger, white onions and salt. Stir fry until onion becomes translucent, about 4-5 minutes. 
2.	Add chicken and stir until opaque, about 3-5 minutes. 
3.	Add remaining 4 cloves minced garlic and stir. Add green onions, cabbage or broccoli slaw, and 1/2 cup of the broth. Stir and cover.
4.	In a small bowl, wisk the remaining 1/2 cup broth, coconut aminos, swerve and arrowroot. 
5.	Add sauce mixture to wok/skillet and stir until chicken and vegetables are coated with the thickened sauce. 

Serve immediately, over hot saut√©ed *Riced Cauliflower (substitute for white rice) if desired.

*With the substitutions,

My family loved this str fry.  I used purple onions, which worked just fine.  Next time, I will steam the veggies just slightly, so they are more crisp at meal time.

Excellent!  This sounded so much like one of our "leftover makeover" meals that we had to try it.  Great comfort food for a cold night or summer veggie clean up.  Don't wait for leftover night, make it any time.

I stuck pretty close to the recipe for the first time and it was great.  We all enjoyed it very much.  I served it over spaghetti squash.  I will spice it up next time with some serrano peppers.

So it‚Äôs just my nature to change things up a bit, and I love hot spicy dishes and tons of fresh veggies so these are the adjustments I made:
-Tripled the Peanut ‚ÄòSauce‚Äô to 6 Tbsp
-Added Chile sesame oil to pan with the peanut sauce
-Tripled the salt to 3 tsp
-Added garlic salt, garlic powder, broccoli, water chestnuts, Bella mushrooms, yellow pepper and red onion
-Omitted the cabbage in exchange for the additional veggies
-sprinkled sesame seeds on top prior to serving
-served over brown rice
This was one of the tastiest dishes I‚Äôve ever made and will be making it again often!

I really enjoyed this dish.  It was very flavorful.  I substituted broccoli and French green beans for the cabbage and snap peas.  I doubled the sauce recipe.  I will be making this dish again.

I cooked Garlic Chicken Stir Fry and it was very delicious. My children liked it very much. Although sugar snap peas were missing in my recipe  but over all taste was so good. Yummmy. Soon I will try again. 
Thanks allrecipes.com

This was fantastic. Even my picky hubby loved it. I didn't have peanut oil so I used Sesame oil. Did not change anything else. For those that said that there was too much sauce, I just  let it boil for a minute until it thickened. Will be making this again.

This is my base stir fry recipe.  I make some variation of this almost every week.  All that changes is what veggies I have on hand or buy at the farmers market.  I find it easier to keep fresh ginger in the freezer and then peel and grate exactly how much I need.  Be creative with lots of different veggies.

I followed the recipe exactly as I usually do first time out. Somewhat expensive to buy all the fresh veggies. Prep was time consuming. The end result was a healthy dish but it did lack flavor. Will make it again as I am into heart healthy cooking. Served it over white rice. I would definitely recommend prepping all ingredients before hand and having them ready to go.

I omitted the sugar and used only half the cornstarch.  I would add a little more soy sauce next time around.  I also added broccoli which gave it more texture.

Good but lacking flavour and as one other suggested less cornstarch, sauce was too thick so had to add more chicken broth.

I decided to leave out salt, sugar and corn starch, added broccoli, sliced carrots and few other random veggies we like, and a little bit of ginger sauce. We like that version a lot more. I usually end up having excess of liquid. To soak it up, I move veggies to the side to make room in the middle  of the pan. Then I put about 1/2 cup of rice and let it steam until soft. Rice soaks up all the juice and it can be mixed in with the rest of the dish right away. We rarely have left overs.

This is the best stir-fry recipe I have ever found. We love it, in fact my husband raved about it. I made no changes except I use whatever veggies I have on hand. The cabbage gives it a nice crunch. I keep a bag of frozen stir-fry veggies in my freezer and use it if I need more vegetables.  This is a keeper. I have made it several times.

Fresh & tasty. Found a little bland so added black pepper & few chilli flakes. Delicious though & very healthy. Easy midweek meal  too much sauce so would reduce liquid next time or cook for longer so reduced more. Definitely be making again

I loved the flavours, but found the sauce a little watery...will increase the amount of cornstarch or decrease the amount of chicken broth/water next time. Also...substituted broccoli, celery and water chestnuts for the peppers. Love the crunch of all of the three!

This was sooo good just as written.  I did double the sauce accounting  for leftovers and to have with chow main noodles.   The wife suggested  adding bamboo shoots, water chestnuts or peanuts for a little crunch.  The flavor of the sauce was awesome and really made the dish.

Made this. It was pretty bland. I added some sesame oil, and when it was finished let people add red pepper flakes, and Mrs Dash Jalapeno blend to it to season to their taste since we typically like things pretty spicy. I will make stir fry again, just not likely this one as it was just ok...nothing special.

Excellent recipe!! Great for busy week nights. I pretty much followed the recipe exactly as written. I did substitute brown sugar for the white because I like how brown sugar pairs with soy sauce. I also added fresh broccoli along with the onions, peppers & sugar snap peas. The recipe is versatile in that you can add various vegetables. I served this over rice with a side salad.  My entire family loved this; kids included (age 3 & 5). Definitely a make again!!

My husband & I just love this recipe we are both garlic lovers and this really delivers.  We have made it as printed and also on occasion to speed things up we have used frozen stir fry veggies, both are delicious.  Who needs Chinese takeout when you can customize this recipe to your liking.  Thanks again...oh P.S. we have also made this recipe using shrimp in place of the chicken and it was also delish!!!

I'm a vegetarian so I went looking for a sauce to make for some mixed veggies I was doing for dinner.  I chose the sauced in this dish and it was outstanding!!  My boyfriend is still talking about it 2 weeks later.  

I will cut the sugar in 1/2 next time and I didn't have green onions so used the dried shallots I had instead.

I pan roasted some cauliflower and then added in some peas and this sauce--this will be one of my go-to sauces going forward!

This recipe has little flavor.  I wouldn't make it again.  I followed the recipe exactly at the end I added extra ginger.and more salt and a little more soy sauce and it still didn't have much as far as flavor or spice.

Loved it, and so did hubs! Substituted cut up fresh asparagus for the bell pepper & snap peas (hubs doesn't like them and you want hubs to like, right?) Did NOT put in any sugar (we aren't fond of sweet Asian dishes.) 

Finally, I peeled & cut some garlic into 6 thin slices. 

Delicious! What a great recipe we can all have fun with! Thanks!

A little to sweet for my taste, I will cut back the sugar next time.  I'd also cut down the green onion next time as it's somewhat overpowering.

This is a very tasty dish.  I omitted the cornstarch.  Instead of white sugar I added Truvia.  Additionally I added White Ground Pepper.

Really good! I cut the sugar in half as I like my stir fries more salty/soy sauce flavored than sweet.  There was a bit too much cabbage for my kid's taste.  This recipe would also be fine with less cabbage, or without cabbage.

Used Bok Choy instead of cabbage, added carrots and substituted amino acids instead of soy sauce ... It was wonderful mixed in with jasmine rice. Will absolutely make it again, and again ... We loved it!!

My children LOVED it. Told me to make it again the next night. I changed the recipe a bit because I did not have all the listed ingredients. I used sesame oil instead of peanut oil. I made it with broccoli, green beans, red and yellow peppers, carrots and chicken. I also added a bit of mango juice and fish sauce for flavor, as well as a pinch of chili powder. It was delicious.

I absolutely LOVED this dish!! I couldn't for the life of me find peanut oil, so I just used regular vegetable oil... I don't think it made any difference.. The rest of the recipe I followed to a T. It was light but filling and flavorful. I'm used to putting a designated sauce or dressing on my stir fry or rice dishes, I was shocked at how flavorful this was with minimal ingredients. I will definitely make this again!

It was a good recipe!  I did use chicken thighs as we prefer dark meat and less green onions, sugar and garlic to fit our taste. I added some cashews at the end to put in some extra crunch that worked out well.  I would use it again!

This recipe came out exceptionally well. The taste of the bell peppers especially was delicious.  We like spice so I added some ground pepper and crushed red chilli flakes which have it that amazing sweet chilli flavor.  My hubby gave it a thumbs up too.

Good, solid stir fry recipe.  I followed the recipe with the exception of using snow peas (from Hubs garden) and doubling the sauce.  Also, halved the cornstarch as we didn‚Äôt want it too thick.  Seemed just right for us.  I served this over white rice and garnished it with crispy rice noodles and chopped green onions.   Very pretty!

This was wonderful!  Next time I will add a little bit more ginger and garlic for more flavor, but the sauce's consistency was excellent.  I used leftover pork and chicken and some frozen veggies.  Restaurant quality and great the next day!

very bland! I ommitted the snap peas, peppers, and cabbage and added frozen broccoli. i also seasoned the chicken with Chinese Five spice and added about a half a table spoon of oyster sauce to the sauce... still very bland... i think it needs WAY more garlic and less ginger. possibly some garlic powder would do the trick?

Easy, Tasty, Versatile --- I added this to my family's weekly routine, along with tacos, fried chicken, etc. It's alot of vegetables, and very savory. I usually serve the stir-fry over some pre-cooked noodles (Blue Dragon) instead of rice. It's also a very versatile recipie. We added more veg, keeping the same chicken, to feed more people (baby corn, broccoli, carrots). --- -the sauce, make sure you use the corn starch, and it'll thicken the sauce for a good coating.

I've made this at least 5 times since discovering it on here. Just a few small modifications I make to it: We add mushrooms, celery and at the end throw in some bean sprouts. I serve it over brown rice that I cook in chicken broth and we love it every single time!! thanks for the great recipe!

This is a great recipe. I use white onion, red pepper, broccoli and pea pods as the vegetables in this dish, since I like them better. A delicious stir fry.

This is an excellent recipe. I did make some changes, only because we are trying to make things more friendly for my diebetic husband. I used whole grain brown rice and omitted the salt. Also omitted the cabbage (personal preference) and replaced the sugar with splenda. I will absolutely make this again, thank you!

Excellent flavor!  I used white onions in place of all the onions in the recipe and string beans instead of snap peas and it was wonderful!  I also used low sodium soy sauce.  I would definitely make this again.

This was a delicious dish. my family loved it.  I used broccoli instead fo peas and cabbage. The brocolli absorbed the flavors nicely.

A bit different than my normal stirfry and used the stuff I had on hand. The taste was not as flavorful. Maybe marinating the chicken in soy or teryaki sauce would help increase the flavor.

My fiance and I both loved it!  We kept pretty much to the recipe but added water chestnuts and used splenda instead of sugar and the whole thing came out great!  We really recommend it!

I really enjoyed this recipe. Next time I'll add cashews as suggested. Does anyone had any suggestions on not burning the first 2 cloves of garlic? With the peanut oil so hot, I'm not sure have you couldn't burn it.

My family really enjoyed this. The sauce came out with a perfect consistency-- not soupy at all. I didn't have peas so I substituted broccoli-- it was great. I intend to make it again and add some extra soya sauce and ginger (the sauce could use a bit more kick), and probably some extra veggies because I prefer a higher ratio of vegetables to chicken.

This was a great stir fry recipe.  I used frozen stir fry vegetables and it was a great shortcut.  Will definately make again!  Thanks so much Teresa!
