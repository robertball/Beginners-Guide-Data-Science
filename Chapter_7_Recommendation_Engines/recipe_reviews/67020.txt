This is good. The next time I make this I will use my hand mixer to mix together the canned cranberry sauce and the jello.
I didn't do that, just used a spoon, and now I have big bites of the canned cranberry sauce. I want it spread out more evenly. Otherwise, a good no bake pie, especially for the holidays.

Very light and sweet, with a slight tartness from cranberries but very delicious and not overpowering.

Made this for Christmas dinner this year and it was a big hit.  Some were skeptical of a cranberry sauce pie at first, but after one bite they discovered a great sweet, tart flavor.

This is a great tasting & verry easy to make cheese cake.I took two pies to a church pot luck & they quickly disappeared.Took anouther to a office Thanksgiving party & my boss loved it so much she demanded the recipe.(I think im getting a raise now LOL ) One thing though. One jello & one cranberry sauce were too much for a single pie .I found that two jellos & two cranberrys were perfict for three pies.

This was delicious and it is pretty.  Make sure you use the larger graham cracker crust. I also used strawberry gelatin when I didn't have raspberry.

I used homemade whole berry sauce that my daughter had made with spices and orange.  It was too tart and spicy for most of my family, but used in this recipe was perfect!  I used my own soft gingersnap cookie recipe for crust (had to smush it down after cooking), and used half vanilla/half almond extract in cream cheese mixture.  This was a hit at church dinner and my husband and rest of family loves it!  This is being added to my holiday repertoire.

I made this for an office party. I did change the crust to a gingersnap crust 'cuz I thought that sounded good. I think my crust was a tad hard and the pie didn't cut well but it was really yummy!

This pie was a HUGE hit!
As I have a nut allergy, I didn't use the walnuts...but, I don't feel that there was anything missing by not adding them.  As for the others eating it, they didn't  know the recipe called for nuts.  All that comes out is the flavor of cran-raspberry.  I've now been making this pie for about 4 years.   My husband and dad LOVE IT!

I made individual pudding cups with it.
I also had added chopped fresh cranberry to the jellied cranberry sauce.  I didn't have the whole jelly cranberry sauce.

I've just today figured out the 3 ounces should actually read .3 oz
