My husband and I love reuben sandwiches and this recipe is definately a classic. I do use margarine sparingly on the bread. I like one reviewer's suggestion to dip the sandwiches in the dressing and will try that next time I make these.

Classic indeed. I would like to try this next time as an open-faced reuben. Very good though.

This recipe is easy, simple, and soooo tasty!  I substituted provolone cheese for the swiss cheese and followed the instructions but you really do not need to measure out all of the ingredients.  You won't be disappointed!

This was awesome! My whole family loved it! The kids did ask for the kraut to be left off though. You could make this with any kind of deli meat and it would be delicious.

Great recipe that we make on occasion when we aren't wanting a big meal.  The only thing we do different is serve the thousand island on the side; you can either dip or add between layers just before biting into!

This is has been a favorite recipe of my family for years. We always toasted them in the oven for that extra crispy taste.We even use party rye bread and leave it as an open face appetizer.

I love this classic sandwich. It is very delicious, which is odd because I don't like sauerkraut, Thousand Island dressing or rye bread.  But all together I guess it's a masterpiece.  I also like to mix one part Thousand Island and one part spicy Russian dressing for the sauce.

My husband wanted Reubens, and I had never had nor made them... So I tried this recipe with the following changes: I doubled up on the corned beef and I used mozzarella instead of swiss. They were really good! I didn't measure out the sauerkraut but just spread a little on the sandwiches. Next time, I think I'll follow the previous reviewer's suggestion of dipping the sandwiches in Thousand Island dressing instead of putting it in the sandwiches. Thanks for the recipe!
