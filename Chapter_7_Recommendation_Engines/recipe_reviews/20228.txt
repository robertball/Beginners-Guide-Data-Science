These were easy to make and a quick study snack, but if I made them again I would definitely use less salt.  I found them to be quite salty!

A good & easy crackle top cookie.  Moist with a blondie-like texture when warm, a little like a shortbread cookie when cool.  Rolling the cookies a little larger or else baking them a minute or two less seems to yield more moist cookies, but they'll be less likely to crackle; might want to experiment a little to find a good balance.

Pushed down the middle after baking and added some homemade jelly.  My family really liked them.

I loved this recipe! My kids and I were home and it was just too hot to be outside so we decided to make cookies.  I needed something simple, my cabinets were pretty bare and this was perfect.  They loved having an easy recipe to help out with and even my very picky husband couldn't keep his hands out of the cookie jar.  We will definitely be making these again,soon!

I just didn't like these.  My family and I ate them because they were sweet, but they didn't taste like cookies.  They were more like cakes and they didn't cook all the way through.

My 5 1/2-year old daughter and I made these cookies and it was a perfect recipe to make with her.  We used butter-flavored shortening.  We baked them for 5 minutes on the top rack and about 5 to 5 1/2 minutes on the bottom rack (so, about 11 minutes at the most).  We sat and watched them cool because we could not wait to try them.  When we did try them, we both said, "mmmm" at the same time.  They are delicious and melt in your mouth.  Will definitely be keeping this recipe and make it over and over again!! Thanks for the great cookie recipe!!

I typed in easy cookies for my 4 year old and I to make one evening after dinner and this is the one we chose to make.  They turned out very good although I cut the salt to 1/2 a teaspoon and still found them too salty.  Will definitely make them again but cut the salt even more.  Good taste and excellent texture.

Two things stand out about this recipe.  First, the simplicity.  No chilling the dough.  While not actually a "drop cookie," these are about the easiest, foolproof cookies you could ever hope for.  Just bake until the cracks appear on all of the cookies.  We were able to churn out three dozen of these for our daughter's Christmas party in no time at all.  More importantly, these taste fantastic, a little like a sugar cookie, a little like a shortbread.  I found the recipe was perfect as listed.  The saltiness was just right.  Thanks for a keeper!

I slightly altered the recipe by decreasing the vanilla to 1/2 teaspoon and adding 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract.  While these cookies were very quick and easy to make, there seemed to be something lacking.  They taste fine, and the melt-in-your-mouth texture is phenominal.  It seems to me that this would be a great basic cookie recipe that bakers could add various things to, such as chopped up toffee candy bars or something.  Overall, I feel like it just needs a little something more to make it a reall stand-out cookie.

I had leftover brown surgar/flower/butter mixture form a crumb topping, added the inredents, rolled into 1" balls, cooked. These were amazing cookies, the right about of sweetness and chewyness! The tops crackeld a bit and looked pretty, tasted even better! This is my surgar cookie recipe forever!

This was a very simple recipe that my kids loved making.  The cookies themselves came out terrific.  This is one that we will use again and again.

Very easy and budget-friendly cookies!  I had all of the ingredients in my pantry, and this took 5 minutes to prep and 8 minutes to bake - perfect for last minute guests.  The only change I made was to follow another reviewer's advice to use 1/2 tsp salt.  The cookies were chewy but not too soft and tasted a bit like chocolate chip cookies without the chocolate due to the brown sugar.  They weren't too sweet, but certainly weren't bland either.  Just yummy as is.  I couldn't stop myself from eating the leftover dough while I baked them, because it was good!

Easy recipe, I made 7 dozen of these to ship to Iraq for some friends of ours... They traveled well.  I have added different flavoring extracts, almond, raspberry and choclate, though not all in the same batch.  My wife like to leave them out and use them as "dunkers" for her coffee.

I wanted to make a quick dessert for lunch today. This is all I could find after typing in "quick cookie".  It turned out very good.  Thanks for the recipe.

I put in about a half a tsp of salt after seeing that some thought it was too salty. These were perfect! Easy to whip up and not so many I eat them all before my kids can have some. Excellent and I'll make again.

My kids loved these! I rolled them in cinnamon & sugar and flattened them out a bit as they don't spread out much at all.  You'll probably want to double this recipe as well because it just doesn't make very many.  Very good and super easy, thanks!

This is an amazing recipe! My grandma made these every year for christmas and they were most definitely the family favorite. Her recipe was a little different, she would take two cookies and spread grape jelly to sandwich them!! DELICIOUS!!!

This tastes like a chocolate chip cookie without the chips.  Very good flavor.  I used butter flavor shortening because that's what I had.  I was looking for a very simple cookie recipe to make with my 21/2 year old Granddaughter.  This was perfect and we had a great time making them (and eating them ;=)  Thanks Judy!
