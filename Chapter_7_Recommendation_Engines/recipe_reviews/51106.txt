This was insanely easy!  My duaghter has her third cheerleading competition coming up this weekend (though they have placed #1 thus far, the practice is NEVER ENDING).  Anyway, I needed something easy & had everything on hand (suprisingly, even the 1/2 pkg of potatoes).  The kids enjoyed it, but as much as I hate to change recipes the first time making them, I did sub carrots for the tomatoes (my son doesn't like them) and it turned out fine.  Thanks BC-  GO PANTHERS!!
