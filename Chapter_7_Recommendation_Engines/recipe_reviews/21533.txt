This recipe was fairly good. I was expecting more depth to the flavor. I definitely enjoyed trying something new and this was a method of preparing salmon I had not tried before. The only changes I made was to add a bit more onion and garlic. I may or may not make this recipe again.

The sauce and herbs sound like a great combonation, but the cooking technique is a mystery. How do you put a long package of parchament wrapped salmon in a double boiler. Can you bake this on a cookie sheet?

This is my family's favorite dish!  It is always requested for company and other special occasions.  It is easy and fast, and great served with Fresh Steamed Broccoli and Wild Rice!

I used tin foil instead of parchment paper and lemon juice instead of lemon, since that is all I had. I used my spagetti pot (since it doesn't get much used when I am off the carbs) and used it like a steamer. The salmon was very tender and moist. All the herbs I used were dried.

I thought it was very good, but next time I might consider adding some wine or something to the sauce, seems like it needs a little more flavor. I would say that I used more garlic and onion than was called for and just seemed a bit bland for my taste, but I would make this again

Very nice mint sauce.  It's has a light, fresh taste that complements the salmon nicely. When baking the salmon, I just spray a layer of cooking spray on parchment paper, lay down the salmon, and added lemon slices and herbs on top.  I cooked it on 325 degrees for about 35 minutes and it came out just perfect.  I will be making this again!

I only used this recipe for the sauce...
I added some white cooking wine and old bay garlic and herb seasoning and thought it turned out rather well. Delicate flavor that complimented the salmon.
Will make again.

This was wonderful! I used a hand blender right in the pan for the sauce and added a dab more garlic. I also used foil as an outer wrapping on the packets. The salmon was tender, moist, full of flavour and smelled incredible cooking. Looks sophisicated and impressive, but it was so easy to cook.

Very nice flavor and I used talapia fillets instead of salmon. My one complaint was that after 25 min the butter wasn't even melted and I had the water on a low boil the entire time. So, popped it in the micro for 4 min on hi and it was done and flaky!!!

This was very good.  I did use more garlic and onion than the recipe called for and it did wonders for the flavor of the dish.  This has wonderful stage presence.  Thanks for the post.

This is my first time cooking with rosemary. I didnt care too much for the flavor. Will try again without it. As stated, this recipe was just okay for me!

I'm not sure the parchment paper was worth all the trouble it gave me... Next time I'm using foil. The taste was good, though. I think the sauce needed salt, and mine was a bit too thin, but again, it tasted pretty good.

This is a wonderful cream sauce that compliments the salmon very well. Even my 3 boys ate it and they don't usually like salmon.

I made this and was impressed with it. It was easy and tasted very good. No bad after taste lingering on your palate. The rosemary and thyme just dance around your mouth. I would recommend that you try this. What do you got to loose?

I did not double boil the salmon.  Baked it for 20 min at 350.  Then broiled for 10 min.
