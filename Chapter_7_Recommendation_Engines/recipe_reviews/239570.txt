I made this exactly as directed, but even after chilling in the fridge to allow the flavors to combine, it came out quite bland and dry!

Having done my due diligence to the author, I decided to make further revisions to see if I could improve the flavor. I ended up adding in a full additional double amount of the dressing (lemon juice, olive oil, and salt/pepper), meaning 6 T each of the juice and olive oil in total, in order to get the consistency I wanted (still fluffy and not oily, I promise!). Still finding the flavor lacking in depth, I added some cumin, which for me was the magic pop that made the salad good. With these changes, I might make it again.

This is very quick and easy to make. Tastes even better the next day.
