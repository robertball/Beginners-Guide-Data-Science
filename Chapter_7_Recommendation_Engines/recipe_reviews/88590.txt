This recipe was a big hit with my whole family. It is now a regular on my meal-planning calendar. One batch makes two 8x8 pans so I freeze one without the cheese crackers and almonds. I add those when I'm ready to bake it.

Very quick prep...and very good texture to the dish...however I would cut the mayo amount by half! The 1 cup of mayo almost overpowered the rest of the dish.

My husband absolutely hates mayo so I took it out and substituted a half cup of sour cream instead. It was wonderful! Very simple dish to prepare and it went so far for my family!!!

I gave this 3 stars although it is a VERY good dish. However I did some things different than the recipe says. First the recipe only calls for cooked chicken it does not say how to cook it so I saut√©ed 3 boneless skinless chicken breasts in olive oil (I never measure anything) then I used 1 can of cream of mushroom and a half can of cream of onion (Next time I will try cream of celery) 1 can of the chicken broth then I added the mayo approx. 3/4 cup a dollop the celery onion water chestnuts (cut into small pieces) then the juice from one lemon fresh squeezed into sauce mix salt and garlic powder. I boiled wide egg noodles (instead of rice) and mixed everything. (including the noodles) then I put everything in a casserole dish and cooked for 20 minutes then I topped it with the ritz cracker and butter mix I used almonds and Colby however next time I am thinking I will omit the Almonds and use a mixed shredded cheese for top. This was the BEST casserole I have ever made. My family wanted more more more. I changed it up according to everyone s reviews (especially the "only tastes like mayo" review) Thank you for the base recipe I would not have been able to do it without that. This is def a 10 star casserole after the changes!! Thank you

This was really easy and quite good. I can't give it a 5 yet but some tweaking next time and we will have a hit. I loved the almonds on top but the Colby cheese turned brick hard and all of the almonds stuck to the cheese. I think next time I will just mix it all together add a few more spices and we will have a winner.

I was afraid to try it since there weren't any reviews yet but I'm glad I did...it was tasty and pretty easy! My in laws loved it and they are pretty particular! I forgot the lemon juice and sauteed the celery and onion in butter just to soften them a bit...it was very good! I will make it again!

I followed the recipe exactly and found that the celery and onions were VERY over powering. I could not even eat more than a few bites. I will not make this again.

This was very flavorful! But we all got a stomach ache after eating it. There is just too much mayo and butter. It tates awesome! but it doesn't agree with the good ole' tummy. Next time I'd cut down on the mayo and use less butter. We also cooked it without the rice and poured it over white rice. We like things better that way. then you can choose how much sauce you wish to have.

This was GREAT. The whole family even 4-8 year old kids couldn't get enough of it! It's a definite keeper. I left out the water chestnuts. Replaced celery with 1 tsp of celery salt used only half an onion used water instead of broth.

I was disappointed in how this turned out. I was really excited because I had been looking for a recipe like this but this wasn't it. Too many water chestnuts and not enough taste. I don't think I'll attempt it again.

The changes I made were: used brown rice did not add cheese and salt & substituted sour cream for mayo. It was a good flavored recipe & easy to make.

Great recipe as it is but I mixed cheese into the casserole instead of using it on top. I cook for a group and was asked for this recipe by several women. It was a hit!

This is a really really good recipe. Like other members I recommend at least halving the mayo and I toasted my almonds for a stronger flavor. Other than that my family likes it as it is. Thanks for this great casserole!

Mayo casserole with no spices and too much in it! Chicken AND celery AND rice AND onions AND soup AND water chestnuts AND crackers AND butter AND almonds AND cheese. A crunchy bland high-caloric mayo casserole.

This tasted very good although I agree about the almonds sticking to the cheese. Next time I'll mix them in. I used slivered almonds since I like them better-more crunch. Also for my taste there was too much mayo. Next time I would try maybe 2 cans of soup with 1 can water and maybe 1/2 cup mayo. All that mayo plus the cheese and the butter on the crackers was too rich for me. It was very tasty though. Will make again with some adjustments.

Good way to use up diced chicken! Very good but the shown recipe makes a BIG casserole. Be careful to not let the topping melt down too much because then it hardens.

The flavor was good but I did add some garlic and other spices just to perk it up a bit. It turned out a little on the dry side and next time I might add some milk to moisten it up. I only used 1/4 cup butter and the crumbs browned nicely.

Very good and so easy! I used only 1 cup of Mayo and used the short cuts Perdue already cooked chicken. I also melted the butter in a bowl in the microwave and put the crushed crackers into that bowl to mix them. It took no time to put together! I was very good and fast to prepare (and I need that with 6 month old twins here!)

Made this for dinner. Since we were starting without leftover chicken, we cooked up four chicken breasts (which equaled between 3 1/2-4 cups diced chicken). I sauteed the onion and celery until soft and onions were golden before adding the soup and mayo. I cut the mayo to 1/2 cup. I also seasoned with Penzey's Northwoods.  We used a bit extra cheese so roughly half was mixed in with the casserole and the other half I mixed with the cracker crumbs and almonds. The topping was amazing! 
In the future I'll likely add a generous dollop of sour cream. This will be made again, hopefully when we have leftover chicken.

Absolutely fantastic! The only change I made was to reduce the amount of mayo to 1/2 cup. My family loved it and I will definately be making it again.

Way too heavy on the mayonnaise and butter. I cut the butter in half for the cracker topping and it was perfect. Wish I'd cut the mayo in half. More veggies might help. It seemed light while eating it but husband complained of feeling bloated after...I think it was the mayo. Also I omitted the cheese which is unusual for me being an enormous cheese lover but just seemed like the fat content was overpowering at that point even though I don't follow a low-fat diet.

Forgot to add the lemon juice so maybe my try on this dish wasn't as successful but a neighbor I had over said it was very good. I thought it was a bit more bland and will definitely add the lemon juice but may also use seasoned salt to add more flavor. Thank you.
