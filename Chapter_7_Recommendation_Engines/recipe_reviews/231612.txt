Great recipe, simple and delicious. I do recommend croutons and provolone cheese. Thanks for posting.

I just made this and was really quite good. I decided to do beef broth, but added a vegetable broth as well. I used a large white onion, added 2 tsp of minced garlic, the salt and pepper to taste,
I had Ceasars croutons  and a slice of mozerella to put  on top. I just may have a second bowl a bit later.

This came out really well, I was worried that there wasn't enough liquid so I added 1.5 cups of water. Since this took away from the beef broth taste I added some steak seasoning I had that was fine and mostly seasoned salt based. I did have to add a good bit of salt to make it have the right flavor. After It was done cooking I put some sliced provolone on top, melted it and dug in. Very easy and delish!
