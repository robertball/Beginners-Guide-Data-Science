Tarragon, nutmeg & thyme - what a brilliant combination !!! Tasting as I worked my way through the directions, I found it a bit bland for out tastes, so I added 2T freshly minced garlic to the onion for last 2 min of saut√©, added 1-1/2 T of capers & 1/4 C white wine to sauce, used 28 oz can diced tomato & increased the thyme to 1 tsp & tarragon to 3/4 tsp. Marvelous dish; definitely making again! Thanks for sharing.

Hubby really liked it, I found it a little bland, think I'll add more spice/herbs next time.  We enjoyed it on a bed of rice with asparagras and greens beans.  Yum!

I made this last night & it was good but it didn't have a whole lot of flavor, even after making some changes that others suggested. I think it has potential though! I sauteed the onion in butter & added about a TBSP or a tad more of fresh garlic, added the spinach & nutmeg. Then I put the fish in the dish & sprinkled onion powder, cayenne pepper, & salt on it. Next time I will add garlic powder & regular pepper as well. I put the spinach mixture all over the fish & baked it. When I made the sauce I added 1/4 cup of white wine to it. Next time I'll use a can of tomato sauce & double it cause there wasn't nearly enough! I think with the extra changes it could be really good & healthy dinner :-)

The taste and presentation were great.  My son said it was the best fish he had ever tasted.  I was disappointed though, because the fish more or less poached in the juices created by the spinach and tomatoes.  I would like a dryer finished dish.  That is why I gave this dish 4 stars instead of 5.

I made this and it was delicious!  I used a can of diced tomatoes with basil, garlic, and oregano for added flavor. I found that when I measured the remaining juice from the can of the tomatoes, there was hardly anything, so I just used a medium can tomato sauce and added some sauteed onion, garlic, and the tarragon.

This was so easy and so delicious!  I took the advice of some reviewers and added a little more spice and used wine instead of water for the sauce.  Doubled the sauce.  Yummm!  Served with wild rice.

Very tastey!  The 2 qt dish seemed too small for all of the ingredients -will go bigger next time.  A great way to enjoy haddock and get your veggies too.

Worried about some of the reviews of this being bland, I made a few changes.  I marinated the haddock in a garlic and herb marinade, then added a minced clove, a splash of white wine and a splash of lemon juice to the onion and spinach saute, and added a clove of garlic, a splash of white wine, a splash of lemon juice, herbs de provence and some red pepper flakes to the sauce.  We were very pleased with the outcome.

This was great. I was worried it would be too bland so I added lemon juice to the spinach mixture and some salt and pepper to the sauce and it worked out perfectly.

YUM! Just finished a lunch made with this recipe. I made a few changes though. One because I was hungry and in a hurry when I was making it so I read that the thyme and tarragon went in the acutal dish. I put the herbs in with the tomatoes and it was amazing. I also added chopped garlic, sliced mushrooms and the juice a myers lemon to the spinach mixture, as well as double the nutmeg...I love nutmeg and probably would never think to use it with haddock. After I spread the diced tomatoes on, I sprinked the tarragon and thyme on top of that and baked it. For the sauce I used green onions and added cayenne pepper and left it otherwise spice free. I loved the juice in the dish, I am already thinking of ways to use it in a fish soup. I served it with turnip mashed with butter and seasoned it with sea salt, cracked pepper and just a hint of thyme...plus 1 tsp of maple syrup just for fun. Way Delish!!!

Very healthy and easy to make.  I didn't make the extra sauce and I didn't miss it.  It could use some cheese on top though!

Perfect - and different enough to be impressive. I have made it both with cod and haddock- good either way.

Tried this recipe and it was really good!  Only thing is I felt it needed more spice so I ended up adding Tabasco to it to kick it up.  I also added crushed black pepper at the time of adding the other spices.  Next time, I will probably add the Tabasco or some other spice when making the sauce.  Overall still really good!

I didn't add the taragon...but something must have gone wrong. NOBODY liked it at all! It was THEE worst meal I have ever made!
