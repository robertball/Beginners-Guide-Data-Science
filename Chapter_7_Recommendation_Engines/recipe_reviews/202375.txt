My husband (who has complained I've made too many avocado type salads recently)and I both loved this salad. Great flavor.  Only reason didn't give it 5 stars is while we like garlic one clove was too much for us.  I have to admit it was a large clove.  Will definitely make again but use smaller clove - less garlic and should be perfect.

Awesome!  Simple!   I eye balled the measurements. I used more garlic and lime juice and less cilantro.    Pairs perfectly with the Chicken with Garlic, Basil, and Parsley recipe.

This was quick and easy to make. I cut the recipe in half. It reminded me a little bit of a quick salsa with avacados. I found the lime alone to be a little tart. I ended up sprinkling on a little olive oil and adding more garlic. I would definitely make this right when it is going to be eaten. It looks the most fresh then. As it sits, it starts to get a little mushy.

I'm not a fan of cilantro so I replaced it with fresh mint.  Everything else I left as per recipe.  This will be repeated many times especially once tomato season gets here.  Thanks, Chad.

The salad is great but as a Persian, I should confess that this is not even related to Persia. we don't even eat avocado much regularly. Thanx

Perfect summertime salad. Made as written. The only thing I would change next time is add a little more cilantro.

Sometimes the most simple things are the most delicious. This simple salad is a good example of that. The lime provided a perfect acidity and flavor to this yummy salad. I would make again. The whole family loved it.

Perfect as a dip with crackers or tortilla chips. Headed into my rotation!
