Made some changes to this recipe to make it easier and healthier--chopped asparagus into bite-size pieces and sauteed in about 2T olive oil with garlic about 5 min.  Add 1 stick low fat marg., lemon juice and frozen shrimp.  Served over mini ziti and sprinkled with parmesan.  Left out mushrooms as my husband doesn't like them.  Using my version the meal is considerably lower in fat and you eliminate a step by not steaming asparagus.  Taste was very fresh, light and healthy.  Will definitely make this again next spring!

I was quite impressed with this recipe!  So easy and SO good!!  I cooked the mushrooms, asparagus, butter and minced garlic in a separate pan.  Then, at the same time I had the egg noodles cooking and also cooked the shrimp, butter, a pinch of minced garlic, the lemon juice and added a few dashes of Creole Seasoning.  This reduced the cooking time and then I was able to just throw it all together and serve it warm.  By adding the Creole seasoning, it gave it more flavor, and I will continue to do that each time I make this recipe.  I have already shared this recipe with a couple friends who have all made it and thought it was wonderful!  Thanks again for a quick, easy and very tasty meal!!

I used angel hair pasta instead of egg noodles and only 1/2 cup of butter. I did what one reviewer suggested and sauted the asparagus in olive oil then set aside until I had sauted the shrimp a few minutes. I used the juice of one lemon. To spice up the flavor a bit, I added red pepper flakes and a bunch of Old Bay seasoning. It would have been a bit bland without the red pepper/Old Bay. My husband and I both enjoyed it with these changes. It was very good reheated the next day as well.

Okay, so my husband and I might not live as long as the rest of you who halved the butter, but we sure loved this recipe in all its buttery glory!  The dish is very pretty and served with a salad and some crusty bread was a delicious dinner.  Go wild; don't cut the butter!

Everyone I make this for loves it! Even the picky eaters asked for seconds. I have made this with egg noodles, angel hair and my personal favorite; linguine. I steam the asparagus while I cook my pasta. Once the asparagus is cooked I add it to a saucepan with my butter, olive oil, s&p, mushrooms and garlic. I saute them until my pasta is ready and then I add my shrimp in the veggie mixture. Cook for 3 minutes and add my pasta. Always is delicious.

Wonderful meal in one. Only thing I did different from the ingredients was only 8oz. of sliced mushrooms and 1/2 cup butter, and that was plenty. I didn't follow the cooking directions, the shrimp needs to be the last ingredient or it would be too tough by the time the mushrooms cook. I just sauteed the garlic in the oil and then added the butter, asparagus and mushrooms, once they were just about tender, I tossed in the shrimp for about three minutes until tender and pink. Then poured that mix into the already waiting egg noodles.  I'm sure if you wanted to use a whole cup of butter it would be even better...but I didn't want the extra calories and no one here noticed.

Really good and easy.  Did not use olive oil.  Sauteed mushroom, garlic and asparagus in butter for 5 minutes.  Mixed all that with cooked pasta.  Sauteed shrimp and garlic in butter, then added lemon juice and red pepper flakes.  Mixed everything with pasta and veggies, then added parmesan.  Really good with garlic bread.  Thanks for sharing your recipe =).

I'm giving this 4 stars because I did tweak it and will tweak further - but loved it overall.  Halved the recipe for just my husband and myself and still have a lot left over.  Used Angel Hair pasta instead of egg noodles.  I sauted garlic (will use more next time) in olive oil (WAY TO MUCH called for in recipe (1/8 cup all that's needed for serving of 4 if that) and then added butter (again, to much - will use 1/4 cup for serving 4 instead of 1/2), lemon juice, asparagus (raw) and some white wine.  Skipped mushrooms cause neither my husband or I like them.  After the asparagus was almost fully cooked, I added 1 lb of lg shrimp and 1 tbsp of Salt Free Poultry seasoning and pepper to taste.  Did not add any salt at all. When shrimp was fully cooked, I removed shrimp/asparagus from sauce, added 1 tbsp of cornstarch diluted in a splash of white wine to avoid clumping, to thicken the sauce - then tossed pasta, sauce and shrimp/asparagus together.  Served w/ fresh out of the oven pillsbury simply rustic french bread.  Forgot to top w/ Parmesan, but didn't need it - was still good.  So much oil left on the plate after we ate we used it for dipping w/ the bread.  
Could use more vegetables - maybe some zucchini and carrots - overall, taste is awesome - just trying to cut back on fats, cholesterol and salt, so reducing amt of oil and butter is good - use white wine and cornstarch to increase amt of sauce if you want more.  Loved the simplicity of it.  Looking forward to making again!

This was not only easy to make but very good. I used whole wheat noodles, frozen shrimp (thawed and tails removed), cut the oil and butter in half and added some garlic pepper and a some red pepper flakes, but did use fresh juice from a lemon. The lemon seems to be the important ingredient. This one's a keeper.

I followed another reviewers suggestion and cooked the asp in 2T olive oil with the garlic until al debate. Then I pushed the asp to the outside of the pan, added 1stick butter, lemon, s&p and the mushrooms. Once that was par-cooked, I pushed mushrooms to outside of pan and added shrimp. Finally I added the cooked pasta and a little more butter. The mushrooms added quite a bit of liquid. This was an easy way to make this a one pan dish. Rave reviews from the whole family. The asp have the dish depth I what would otherwise be a plain dish. It's a keeper -thanks for sharing!

Excellant............I used 1/2 the butter and oil as well as half the egg noodles.  I doubled the lemon juice and added a sprinkle of crushed red pepper.....all suggestions from previous reviewers.  It's as pretty as it is good.

This is a Keeper!!
I made a few changes - The recipe time to cook the shrimp seemed really long and shrimp get tough when overcooked.  I marinated the shrimp in lemon pepper seasoning and added a generous handful to the egg noodles when cooking.  I sauteed the garlic and mushrooms per the recipe and then added the raw asparagus.  Stirred it and added 1/4 cup of white wine, covered it and steamed the asparagus for about 2 min.  Took the cover off, added the butter, shrimp and lemon juice which I increased to about 1/4 cup. When the shrimp were pink I added the noodles, hit it with the parmesan and an extra sprinkle of lemon pepper.  It rocked my family's world.  Thanks Allrecipes for the inspiration.  Next time I'm adding Scallops.

Amazing!  Easy and delish.  I reduced the butter, increased the lemon, left out the mushrooms and added pepper flakes.  Great dish for those busy work nights!  Thanks.

I LOVE this recipe. I came across this accidently a couple years ago and have been using it since. I use linguine or spaghetti noodles instead. I use only 1/2 cup butter and a little more olive oil to compensate. If I don't have asparagus, I use spinach. I've thrown in tomatoes once too.

This is fairly basic, so other than the preparation method itself I have neither any criticism nor any kudos for this recipe. A number of steps can be saved merely by "stir-frying" the asparagus and mushrooms till nearly done, then adding the shrimp and cooking another few minutes.  Not memorable by any means, but a pretty darn good dinner that came together in minutes simply using ingredients I had on hand.

didn't have mushrooms..still very, very good.  One of my favorites.
Make it EASIER: Just throw the shrimp in with the noodles during the last minute of cooking (and I use whole grain linguine).  Use the bottled minced garlic if you aren't using mushrooms and then you avoid the saute step.
This recipe only takes me about 10 minutes to throw together if my asparagus is washed and cut.  I also like to just toss the asparagus w/olive oil and garlic salt and bake at 400 degrees till done. (Do this while the noodles cook)
LOVE THIS.

AH-mazing!!!! I followed others advice and used half the butter which was enough, and a dash of old bay. For my own tweaks I used a combo of white, baby Bella and shiitake mushrooms, and used 1 shallot to replace 2 of the garlic cloves. this is a keeper. Wow.

4.5 Less oil, less butter, more garlic.  Microwaved the aspargus and fresh mushrooms first until almost done and poured off the water.  used frozen shrimp, thawed by running under the tap in a sieve with cold water running.   Nice and quick to make!!!  Also used fresh angel hair pasta. :)

I loved this recipe, but I made a few changes after tasting the first batch which I made following the recipe. Thus only 4 stars. I found the mushrooms to offset the dish. I chose to saute the asparagus with a little olive oil and sea salt for about 4 minutes. Then I added some fresh basil, the lemon juice, about 2 tablespoons of more olive oil, half a tomato, and only 2 cloves of garlic (my boyfriend isn't big on garlic), and the shrimp. Cooked this for about 5 minutes while stirring and it came out PERFECT. Cooked the noodles and tossed it all together while still in the pan (this is key to allow the noodles and sauce to mix together.) You'll notice I omitted the whole cup of butter. Didn't find use for it with already having the olive oil. Makes it much more healthier and I think, less dense. This is a great dish, just needed a little bit of adjustment.

I am not a fan of asparagus...but hubby LOVED this dish.  I just didn't eat the green stuff (lol).  He even made me write the ingredients down on the grocery list to make this again.  Thanks for the post.

Very simple and comes together VERY quickly. I'd suggest having all the prep work done before starting to actually cook, or you may end up with overcooked shrimp. To use fewer pots/pans, I boiled the asparagus in the pasta water, before cooking the pasta. I also tossed it with orzo instead of the egg noodles. Excellent recipe! Thanks, Cathy!

This was good but too bland. My family was asking what the "sauce" was since it's just oil and butter? I did cut the fat by half and added onions. Next time I'm going to add 1 cup of parm. cheese to the oil/butter and add some cajun seasoning as someone else recommended. I would do this again with these changes. Thanks!!

WONDERFUL!!! I made some minor changes, based on other reviews and personal taste. First, I didn't use the whole spears because the ends are always hard. So... I cut them in half, threw the bottom away and cut the top 1/2 into bite size pieces. I sautéed the asparagus for 5 mins in 2T extra virgin olive oil, 1 T butter and 1/2 tsp minced garlic. I added mushrooms and sautéed an additional min. Last, added shrimp (flash frozen type, thawed) and 3/4 tsp lemon juice. Once shrimp were warm (about 2 mins), I added to the cooked pasta. Again, WONDERFUL!!! Hubby and I really enjoyed the flavor of everything together and will be making again!

Very quick and tasty.  I sauteed the garlic, mushrooms and asparagus together and used bow tie pasta.

I have to say that this recipe was delicious!! I didn't skimp on the butter but made a few additions. I added chopped onion to the garlic as well as some Cajun seasoning and cayenne pepper, also doubled the asparagus. I had made it previously without those changes and I felt it was lacking flavor, made with those simple changes it was such a nice meal, easy to make and full of flavor. Served it with a salad and crusty bread. Had it for a dinner party, everyone raved about how amazing it was!
Big thank you to Cathy for sharing this!!

You can't go wrong with anything that calls for a sauce made of olive oil, butter and garlic.  Altogether it probably took me about 20 minutes to make everything, if you do the steps simaltaneously, so it is a very quick and easy dinner.  I skipped the mushrooms because I didn't have any, but added onions and some diced tomatoes at the end.  Delicious!

Excellent dish! Simple to make and tastes great! Doubled the garlic and the lemon.

There was something missing from this recipe when we first made it, the flavor was very mild.  We added a bit more salt and put in about a tablespoon of Grey Poupon Dijon mustard and it was so incredible, it could be served in a place like Macaroni Grill!!!!

I made the recipe as described and there was way too much butter. Also, I found it a little bland.

This is a great meal! It has become a staple in our house. We use fresh green beans or sweet pea pods instead of asparagus. We cut the butter in half because it can get pretty greasy if you don't. And to make it easier on myself, I buy the shimp that are already peeled and deveined. I think you are a crazy person to do otherwise! But I am a mother of 4 and don't have the time or patience or stomach to do it myself. This dish is def. reccomended. It is also a great dish to serve when entertaining guests because it makes a lot!

Nice!  My husband and I both really enjoyed this dish.  Used regular noodles instead of egg because I didn't have egg noodles on hand.  Also used a combination of approximately 2 tsp of Brumbling Brown and a bit of olive oil instead of butter to cut the fat.  Turned out fab and I will definitely be making this again!!!

Really yummy, quick, light (I used a LOT less of both oil and butter) dinner. I forgot the parm but we all still loved it!  Would be great with crusty bread to sop up the juices!

Quick and easy recipe, a little bland before adding extra seasoning but I forgot the lemon juice so that probably didn't help.  I added Lawry's to the mix, more black pepper and only used 2 tbs butter together with a little olive oil.  1 cup butter was just too much for me to handle!  As I didn't have much shrimp, I used fake crab too, which added nicely to the meal.  I would've used some white wine if I had some open but unfortunately I didn't.  Will make again (with the white wine!)

I made this it was delicious!! my husband doesnt like shrimp or asparagus and went back for seconds.  The only thing is the amounts.  i didnt use a half a cup of olive oil that is way too much. i used maybe 1/4 a cup and i used 1/4 cup butter. and i used more lemon juice you couldnt really taste it otherwise. and i did 2 cloves of garlic and it was plenty.

I looked at this recipe the other day, thought I would use up the shrimp I had on hand.  we all love shrimp.  I felt like a 5 starr chef when making this dish.  What a beautiful plate and the taste is out of this world!!  You would be a great hit if you cooked this for a dinner party. Thank you so much for sharing I will make this again and again.  I believe browning the garlic made all the difference in the world.  YUM YUM.

Really, really good. I only used about 12 oz egg noodles and 1/2 the butter but kept everything else the same. Although I cooked the mushrooms about 5 minutes BEFORE adding the shrimp. Otherwise I believe the shrimp would have been over cooked. Will definitely make again.

Delicious!  I did try the suggestion of one of the previous reviews and added about a teaspoon of red pepper flakes and doubled the amount of lemon juice.  My husband absolutely LOVED it.  I will definitely make this again and plan to share it with lots of family and friends.

This is one of the best recipes I have tried from this site.  I did cut both the butter and oil in half and it still tasted wonderful.  My husband and I throughly enjoyed this recipe and have made it several times.  Thank you.

My wife kept eating this meal for three days and it was perfect every single day. I did some modifications, and will do more next time. First, I split cooking of mushroom and asparagus on two different skillets. Each with olive oil, garlic, lemon, and butter. I then mixed the two together and added some shrimp. I then served it over vegetable linguine. Even though I used 1/2 cup of butter and 1/4 cup of olive oil, it was still way too much. Next time I will use total of 1/8 of a cup of olive oil and 1/4 cup of butter.

Really nice dish! I was worried about the shrimp getting overcooked, so i added the mushrooms before the shrimp, cooked them for about 2-3 minutes then added the shrimp. By the time the shrooms were nicely sauteed the shrimp were perfect!

The flavor of this dish wasn't bad, but I just couldn't get past the oily texture from all the butter and oil used. The sauce basically consisted of oil & butter.

I was trying to find a way to make my kids eat asparagus without traumatizing them as I was.  I have never made asparagus for myself as I have never liked them.  This dish changed my mind and my kids ate it up as did my mom who loves asparagus.

great tasting meal .... doesn't need as much butter as the recipe calls for and I added Lawrys season salt too for more flavor ... overall we will make it again for SURE!!   (oh I halved the noodle amount and doubled the shrimp ... we like more protein and less carbs)

Ok, I've been waiting for the price of asparagus to come down and for me to have both asparagus and shrimp in the house before I could finally make this recipe.  First, I only used 1/4 cup of olive oil, and about 1/4 cup of butter.  I omitted the mushrooms (sorry, don't eat fungus..) it was good, not great.  Don't think it would have been better if it was swimming in and extra 1 cup of oil or butter - I would make again, just with a few mods to make it more healthy and more taste.  Sorry!

Absolutly delicious. I substitute angel hair pasta for the egg noodles. I also bake the asparagus with a little olive oil instead of boiling. Other than that, I follow the recipe and it turns out wonderful everytime!

I really enjoyed the flavors and presentation of this dish -- and our dinner guests did too!  I served it over a pasta that was a whole wheat blend for the added health benefit.  I also reduced the butter to 2T and used some "butter substitute" spray to make up the difference.  To make the asparagus prep easier, I chopped the spears into 1 inch pieces BEFORE steaming them in the microwave for 4 minutes.

Very yummy! The light lemon butter sauce complements the asparagus and shrimp well. To make this recipe healthier, I only used enough olive oil to coat the bottom of the pan and only 3 tbsp of imitation butter. I also increased the lemon juice to 2 tbsp and added 1 tsp crushed red pepper (as suggested by other reviewers).

I really liked the taste, but I think I failed to use enough shrimp and asparagus because it felt more like a side than a main dish.  I will definitely make again, but adjust a bit.

Loved how versatile this recipe is.  Everyone has their own ideas; I used what else I had on hand.  I used 1/4 c. butter, 1/4 c. olive oil; sauteed 3/4 c. green onions, 3 T. minced garlic, a red bell pepper sliced thinly, 1 T. finely minced basil, 1/8 tsp. oregano, 1/4 tsp. crushed red pepper til tender, added the shrimp.  Tossed around a very few minutes then added 1/2 dry sherry w/1T.cornstarch.  I added the salt, black pepper and tossed the spaghetti in with the Parmesan cheese.  This was really great!

Surely the one cup of butter must be a missprint? I used one fourth cup butter and one eighth cup olive oil and it was more than enough! It was delicious, but I can't even imagine using that much butter!

Prepared this exactly as written and my husband actually gave it a #10, which surprised me because  he doesn't think that shrimp is substantial enough for a meal! BTW, we did chop up some of our home grown habernaro peppers and spinkled it in our individual dishes to taste.

I loved this recipe, but like most eveyone else cut the oil & butter in half.  I cut the shrimp in a butterfly pattern and that made them really appear larger. 
Next time I will eliminate the lemon juice, that, to me, seemed  like it gave a sweet taste to the dish.
I served it over thick spaghetti and that, I thought, would be better than noodles. and it was. 
This is such a quick & easy dish to make. I think, like one reviewer said,, will sautee the mushrooms separately as well as the asparagus. with some mniced garlic.

This is an awesome recipe!!  I used organic rotini and cut up my asparagus into bite size pieces before steaming. I jazzed it up a bit and added shitake, oyster, portabella and button mushrooms, added juice of an entire lemon then topped with loads of italian asiago,  pine nuts, unrefined salt and lots of fresh ground pepper!!!! Crazy delicious!

Great recipe, my family loved it.  I did cut the amount of butter and olive oil in half to make it a little healthier.  I also used ziti noodles instead of the egg noodles, other than those small changes I followed the recipe exactly.  It was wonderful, even my picky son liked it.

Delicious! I used fettuccine noodles because we don't really like egg noodles. I added a little green onions and about 1 1/2 lbs of asparagus steamed and frozen raw shrimp.

I made this recipes with linguine. I boil the asparagus while I cook my pasta. Once the asparagus were cooked I added it to a saucepan with my butter, olive oil, salt, pepper, and garlic left out the mushrooms I just don't like mushrooms. I saute all the ingredients until my pasta was ready and then I add my shrimp in the veggie mixture. Cook for 5 - 8 minutes and add my pasta. Delicious.

This is the only way I've gotten my 5 year old to willingly eat asparagus!  This is best described as shrimp scampi plus pasta and veggies.  DELICIOUS!  I tried to cut back on the butter and oil, but I ended up having to add it back because it's the basis for the sauce.  Definitely not a "light" recipe, but a wonderful treat every now and then.  Will definitely mark this a "keeper" per my 5 year old's request.

I was leery of trying this...While I LOVE all the ingrediants, my husband is not an asparagus fan.  However, we both really enjoyed this dish!  It's light and fresh and even tastes good cold!

Followed others advice with less butter and oil. Skipped the mushrooms because of preference. Also added scallions for an additional flavor.

Outstanding! I made this for my honey with Tinkyada gluten free spagetti. She raved! Its easy to overcook some of these ingredients so I steamed the asparagus al Dente', saute'd the shrimp and removed them, cooked the mushrooms and added the cooked shrimp and asparasas back just to heat. The recipe suggests cooking garlic till golden, but that makes it bitter. Cooking it 30 seconds or so till it is just fragrant is much better. Two or three bites into the meal she asked to make this one a "Keeper".

Delicious! I took the advice of other reviewers. Here's what I did: I bought peel-and-eat shrimp that were already cooked, so I simply peeled them and pulled off the tails. Made the pasta, put it aside. (I used no-yoke egg noodles, they were great!)  Next, I sauteed the garlic and cut-up asparagus pieces in some olive oil for about 4 minutes. (omitted mushrooms) Then I added just 1 stick of melted margarine and the lemon juice. Finally, added the shrimp. Since they were already cooked, I only needed to mix them in with everything for about a minute. I then poured everything from the pan onto the egg noodles and tossed well. Then added some Old Bay seasoning. Just now realized that I totally forgot the grated parm!! But the end result was buttery and subtly flavorful. You can always add tons more salt and spices if you need to, but we were happy with the resulting flavor, even with forgetting the parm! Loved it.

We loved this recipe! I did make a few changes though, based on other reviews.  I cut the butter and olive oil in half, sauteed the asparagus with the olive oil and garlic, and then added the mushrooms and shrimp last.  I also added 1/2 tsp of crushed red pepper to spice it up a little.

This was okay.  I followed the recipe but thought it needed a little more flavor and all of the butter was a little much for my taste.  With all of the positive reviews I expected it to be better.

I only used about 3 to 5 tablespoons of butter. After adding the olive oil and garlic to the pan, i added half a bag of fresh baby spinach.  I also added a packet of good seasons italian dressing seasoning.  Also, I reserved about a cup to a cup and a half of the asparagus water for the pasta.  Otherwise, it would have been too dry.  This turned out to be very good.  I didn't give it 5 stars because i made all these changes.

This was very, very, very bland. I followed recipe and the end product was just boring. I tried adding salt, lemon juice, pepper -- still bland. and the recipe makes A LOT, so leftovers weren't thrilling either. sorry, but try a different recipe.

Fantastic recipe! My whole family, six kids included, loved it. My very particular husband said it's a winner...make it next week!  It's great too because it's soooo easy.  
I did add a teaspoon of crushed red pepper for a little bite.  Yummm!

Not sure what i missed with this recipe, but i was expecting more with the great reviews it has recieved. I enjoyed the combination with the mushrooms,shrimp,etc. but think the past was too heavy with the vegtables. I did not put in a whole cup of butter as it seemed too much to me, but maybe that is what you need for the flavor? I dont think i will be making this one again.

This is the second time I have made this recipe.  It's fantastic!!!  I always add a little Zatarain's Creole Seasoning and Louisiana Creole Seasoning to mine to spice it up.  Also decrease amount of Olive Oil and Butter by half and add more garlic and 1 whole lemon use different types of pasta too.  It tastes as good as any fancy Italian Restaurant's dish. I'll make this over and over.  Thank you for the recipe Cathy.

Recipe is tasty but cooking mushrooms with the shrimp does not work, they should be sautéed w the garlic, browned, remove, set aside. Add the cooked mushrooms once shrimp is pink.

Absolutely delicious! Saute'd the asparagus in the evoo and 1/2 the butter until true green, added baby bella shrooms and simmered until tender, then added 3X the garlic. Tossed in fresh pre cooked shrimp just until heated thru.Poured mixture in the egg noodle pot and tossed with parm. Wawlaw.....one of our favorites. Forgot the lemon juice so I'll try it next time.

I also halved the butter as others did.  I used whole wheat linguine  and sautéed the asparagus in olive oil and garlic .  Used more parm cheese (personal preference ... but it also thickened the sauce. )  Will be putting into rotation because everyone loved it!!!

This was really good! I get sick if I eat too much butter so I cut it down to about 3 tablespoons. That was plenty! I also added green onions to the garlic when sautéing and used bowtie pasta. I boiled the asparagus with the pasta, separated by a steaming basket, which timed perfectly and improved the simplicity. After one bite, my husband said, "This is good! Make it again sometime!" Which is a huge compliment from a picky eater. Thanks for a delicious recipe!

This dish turned out really yummy!! I sauté  butter, garlic, lemon juice, mushrooms, and asparagus until tender. I also sprinkled lemon pepper on my shrimp and added to sauté mixture. I added a ten oz tub of Philadelphia Cream Cheese savory garlic. Used noodles stuffed with spinach. Definitely adding to my recipe book.

Had to make this healthier...but non the less tasty. I omitted the butter completely. Grilled my asparagus and mushrooms. Marinated my shrimp in a lil olive oil, the crushed garlic, sea salt and pepper. Sauteed that with a half sliced red onion and added the grilled veggies and pecorino romano cheese. Served as is w/o pasta. Very good and light. Thanks!

I'm really not a naked-shrimp person, but this recipe is amazing!  I didn't change a thing and I was blown away by how delicious this was.  I was a big girl and tried the shrimp and I have to admit I loved it!

A great fresh entree.  I did cut the butter in half which did not hurt the taste at all.  I like it better the less greasy it is.

Great recipe! Like other reviewers I cut the butter & olive oil in half, I did use the full 16oz bag of noodles. It was a tad bland so I added a dash of Tony Chachere's Salt Free Seasoning.  Forgot to get garlic cloves, so I had to use garlic powder. I used about 3/4lb of mushrooms because my kids aren't fans of mushrooms but, I love em. I cut the asaparagus into fours. I will use more veggies the next time.  My daughter said it's her new fav! Even my son that hates cheese liked it(next time will set some aside before adding parmesan). It was such a hit, that I'm adding it to my Easter menu. Thanks for sharing!

Easy and really good with a mild buttery lemon flavor.  We added 2 extra garlic cloves and just a tad more butter.   Very very good and will make it again.   Served with a ready pack salad and garlic bread.  I havent tried the leftovers yet.

WOW! what a wonderful recipe! My daughter and I are slowly removing animal products from our diet and this is a great "transition" food. Butter is not quite necessary and I can see myself making this again in the future without shrimp and more veggies.  It was light and flavorful. I noticed my meat eating husband going back for seconds.
Thanks so much for sharing this wonderful recipe

I have made this dish at least a dozen times for family and friends, at parties.  It is universally LOVED.  I tend to add a bit more Parmesan cheese.  I've done it with an Italian blend mix with Romano cheese as well.  It really doesn't matter.  Fresh shrimp is definitely the way to go.  I've done it with frozen; and although both were tasty, there is a difference.

This was pretty tasty...  I was looking for a recipe to make where I had all the ingrediants in the house and this one was perfect.  I read some of the reviews and decided to go ahead and cut back on the butter & oil which I think was a good move... I also read that someone had added crushed red pepper and since I like a "kick" I decided to do that too.  I also added a little chopped red onion and a dash of cajun salt. This was pretty good and I will probably make it again but I am really glad I made the adjustments I did otherwise I think it would have been a bit oily and bland.

I don't review things very often. I think a lot of times the best part about cooking is experiementing with personal tastes. I usually do when I have something that I feel would have been valuable knowledge when I was cooking. This one, I just feel like praising. It was really good! And we liked that it wasn't a heavy pasta, but a light sauce with good ingredients. Even my picky eater liked it and she HATES asparagus. my doctor told me I have high cholesterol so I have been modifying things lately to try to cut that. Margarine has cholesterol reducing qualities, so instead of olive oil (only bc I was out) and butter, I cooked the shrimp and garlic and mushrooms and asparagus each in a small amount of margarine. Then I took a bit more garlic, some margarine, and the lemon and made the sauce for everything. I didn't use salt and I don't think it needed it, I find lemon to be a good, healthy use instead of salt. Really good, easy, quick meal. Thanks!

I made this without the mushrooms (because I didn't have any) and with only 1/2c butter (1stick) because I though it would be too fatty/rich.  It was awesome!  If I had some white wine I would have added that as well.  Next time, however, I will probably nix the butter or use less of it, to try to make it healthier.  Maybe then would be a good time to add the wine!  I gave this 4 stars because of the amount of butter the recipe calls for, I don't think that much is needed.

My hubby is pretty picky especially when it comes to pastas...but he loved this! He doesn't like mushrooms, but I put them in anyway just for my bowl...I used penne and also wilted some spinach into the veg/shrimp mixture before tossing in the pasta and that made it even better!!

Having read others reviews about the etra oils and need for flaovor I decided to to go with 1/3 cup of olive oil as opposed to a 1/2 cup. Then instead of 2 sticks of butter I used 1 stick and about 1/4 cup of white wine and it was yummy !!!!  Nice flavor- not too oily - perfect.  I would definately reccomend this recipe but would definately cut the oils and add the wine.  enjoy :o)

Really loved this recipe! I cut the butter and olive oil in half, sauteed the asparagus with the olive oil and garlic, and then added the mushrooms. Added the shrimp and the juice of a whole lemon last. Served over linguine instead of egg noodles.

A good baseline. I reduced the oil, added green onions to the garlic and let it simmer for a few minutes. I then sauteed the mushrooms and asparagus and threw in the lemon juice, butter and a bit of white wine vinegar and cayenne pepper. I then added the shrimp and served it over brown rice with a bit of fresh italian parsely. Yumm

I  haven't actually made this yet, but a friend of ours had us over for dinner and made it, and it was absolutely fabulous!  I'm really looking forward to making this on my own, it was the best shrimp with pasta I've ever had!

This is great. Cut oil and butter WAY down to save some fat. Had more than enough with 2T of oil and 2T of butter when adding shrimp. Added extra garlic and sauted in oil for a few minutes before adding asparagus. Added some white pepper and some finely chopped hot peppers to give a kick which we like. Added muchrooms when asparagus was getting soft and shrimp and butter after that. Served over rice and was just as good the next day.. Will make again. It was a keeper and easy!

This was delicious! The one change I will probably make the next time is to skip steaming the asparagus. Instead I will chop it first and stir-fry it  with the garlic. Thanks for a keeper!

This was a hit with my family. My 10 year old gave it a thumbs up, and ate all the vegtables with out any complaints, and was excited when he had more mushrooms on his 2nd serving.  Not the norm in our house, and my 7 year old loved it.  I did use less butter and oil, about 3 tbs oil and 6 tbs butter, seemed to be plenty.  Also, served over rice instead of noodles. Thanks for a new recipe!

This was a good dish. I felt it had a lot of oil and butter, so it didn't agree with the healthier side of me. I did what one reviewer recommended and left out the mushrooms. Not that I don't like them but it took a lot of heaviness out of the dish. I added some Cajun seasoning, ginger powder, red pepper flakes, and parsley to the shrimp when they were sauteeing for a little kick. Chopped up the asparagus real nice and....voila! I will make this dish again!

EXCELLENT, DELICIOUS AND EASY!  We liked it just the way it was written.  Loved having only 2 pots...one for the shrimp and veggies and the other for the pasta.  I think I would even make it for company!  This is a keeper!

this recipe was incredible!  The only changes I made were adding a bit more "kick" to the garlic/oil mix by throwing in a few shakes of Garlic Garni and additional parm at the end.  I also forgot the lemon - by sheer accident.  Next time I might try it with, but doubtful...  it was excellent as is!  My husband even said it was good on day#2!

This turned out great and was very easy!  The only thing I changed was I cut down on the butter some and added white wine to compensate.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very good!  I read the reviews and added some creole seasoning (not much)and was cautious of the amount of olive oil & butter.  However, upon realizing that the butter & olive oil make up the sauce that will coat all of that pasta, I ended up using almost as much as the recipe called for.  I did think there was a bit too much pasta, and ended up leaving about 1/4 of the pasta out before mixing everything together, but still used all of the butter sauce.  We really enjoyed this.

Yummy!  Made it with half the butter and only a few fresh mushrooms.  Added onions too.  Next time will use even less butter, increase the lemon a bit & be sure to add all the mushrooms.  It was awesome even with the substitutions.

This is excellent.  I have made it several times.  I too cut the olive oil and butter in half, and just before serving add a little half & half to thicken it up.  I also sprinkle on a little creole seasoning to spice it up. It's become one of our favorites.  Thanks!

Great recipe.  I added fresh diced tomato on top before serving to add colour and a nice fresh taste.  Next time, I would use half the oil and half the butter.

This recipe is sort of bland.  My mother liked it, but the kids wouldn't touch it and my husband thought it was boring.  I took the advise of some reviewers and used more lemon juice and seafood seasoning...it just never came to life.  It's ok for an everyday type meal, but I would not make it for company.

Cathy, thanks for that recipe!  My boyfriend and I thought it was absolutely delicious.  At first I thought it would be like many scampi's I've had, but I think the addition of the mushrooms added a great texture and the flat egg noodles held the sauce better than a spaghetti.  This will be a regular dish in our home!!!  Nice surprise, thanks again!

I think this is my first review.  I love Allrecipes and I've used it for years.  So tonight I made this fabulous recipe.  I read over 100 reviews and made a number of changes.  I added lemon juice to one lemon, reduced butter to one stick, added pine nuts, red pepper flakes, half and half, red pepper strips, Tony's seasoning, and baby spinach.  It was to die for and the family is delighted with a new favorite dish.  I've read statements where if you make changes you can't rate the recipe.  I disagree.  Thank you all!

We liked this recipe very much.  My husband and I were cooking together and while I was cleaning and slicing the mushrooms, I asked him to heat up the oil and brown the garlic.  He almost had a coronary-so we cut the olive oil from 1/2 cup to a 1/4 cup.  We also used unsalted butter and cut that in half, too.  I only made half a pound of pasta, so everything turned out perfect.  Thanks for another great recipe.

This was FANTASTIC!!! Quick, easy, and simple to make your own. We added onions and bell pepper when we did the garlic. (FABULOUS!!!) Once tasted decided artichoke hearts would be an addition next time.

This pasta was really good!  I'm giving it four stars as written because I had to make modifications.  I followed the advice of several other users and cut the amount of butter to 1/2 cup.  It was definitely plenty. Also, I added the shrimp last with the asparagus so it wouldn't get overcooked and rubbery.  The mushrooms, however, I added before these two ingredients and allowed them to cook down for a bit and their juices to cook off.  

I can't wait to try this again with some variations, like added spinach and tomatoes.  I think it is really flexible and will be a regular on our rotation.

While making this, I was certain it would be a disaster.  It just didn't look like it was possible to get much flavor on all those noodles out of just the butter and lemon, but boy was I wrong!  This was surprisingly good, with the mushroom, lemon, and butter balancing each other out nicely.  Definitely a keeper!  Thanks for sharing this!

Followed the recipe exactly.  Served guests and they went crazy. Served wild rice in place of pasta. Fresh asparagus and a salad rounded out the menu.

Delicious!!! easy,time efficient. I did not measure at all, forgot about the cheese (due to a time crunch) still head a wonderful result. I added scallops and other various mushrooms from whole foods which gave a wonderful texture and crunch. In the future I will not steam asparagus ahead of time at all! Instead add as a final ingredient right before combined with noodles so is not overcooked yet steamed and bright in color not mushy thumbs up!!! definitely great addition to my menu with healthier choice of pasta.

Wonderful! I made a few changes. Roasted the asparagus, added Spanish chorizo and a splash of white wine.  I used about 2 tablespoons of olive oil and the same of butter.  Seasoned with salt, black pepper and cayenne.

Delicious! Make it with ingredients as described (don't try to make it healthy) especially if it's the first time.

I only gave this recipe 3 stars because it has WAY to much unneeded fat and if you cook the shrimp until pink it was to chewy after sauteing more with the veggies. It also needed seasonings. 

I halved the butter and oil, only sauted the shrimp a min or 2 before adding the veggies to finish cooking the shrimp .  I've also added Old Bay or a dash of hot sauce, or a dash of red pepper flakes.

I used smaller shrimp since that is what I had on hand, but I do think it would be much better using larger shrimp. This is a lighter dish that I think would be great in the summertime. I also think it would be good cold.

just made this, in my right mind i couldn't use all the oil and butter. 2 TB OLIVE OIL, sauteed the mushrooms with the garlic then the asparagus as chopped pieces added 1 stick butter, increased the lemon to 1 whole,  then a little chicken broth to up the sauce quanitity..added the shrimp as close to the last as possible Salt and pepper, little cayenne..as much as i stick to a recipe as written the first time... I totally had my way with this one, only because i already had the ingredients on hand and didn't want to waste them.

Really easy and fresh tasting.  I halved the butter and used a little chicken stock instead.  Also used more lemon juice plus some zest, and crushed red pepper flakes.  Delicious!

I did as many did and tweaked this menu to make it more healthy.  I sauted the mushrooms, asparagus, and also some fresh peppers and onions from the garden in a separate pan.  I sauted them in olive oil, garlic, and some cayenne and paprika.
I then removed the above mixture and sauted the shrimp using only 1/3 cup butter and lemon juice.  I added Italian seasonings also.  Served as many did on angel hair pasta.  Perfect summer dish!

Awesome recipe.  I added some Greek Seasoning to add a little more flavor and sauteed the asparagus rather than steaming to give it some crispness.

So good and easy!  But couldn't in good conscience use that much oil or butter as other reviewers said.  Used 1/4 c olive oil (will use less next time) and used 1/4 c butter for the dish (8 servings).  I also used another reviewers suggestion - sauteed garlic, then mushrooms.  Added 1/2 cup white wine with lemon juice and steamed asparagus for awhile then added butter and shrimp for the last few minutes. I typically overcook shrimp but didn't this time! I did added red pepper flakes, salt and pepper.  Will use more lemon juice next time.  I'm gluten free so used jasmine rice instead of pasta - was fabulous!  My BF and I were the only ones eating and there were not 6 servings left for sure!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this last night and did it exactly like the recipe stated. Usually I monkey around with the ingredients, but for some reason I didn't this time.
It was fabulous! OMG...everything about it was so good! My husband and son loved it too. 
I cooked the asparagus earlier in the day and had that ready. The rest went together while I cooked the noodles. Be really careful not to overcook them or they will be mushy. Eck.
I'll definitely be making this again, for company, now that it's passed the home test.

Just made this yesterday and it was great. It's not dissimilar from a carbonara recipe I picked up online so the process was rather familiar, prep was a cinch.

I did put the mushrooms in before the shrimps (the produce store didn't have asparagus!). Shrimps take but just a few moments to cook. Plus the mushrooms brown better (don't add salt and pepper until after they turn color). Did the usual devein + soak in bicarb for added crunch for the shrimps.

Smooth velvety buttery goodness coating each piece of penne pasta (subbed); what a wonderful dinner!

Tried this recipe tonight and thought that it was pretty yummy.  I follow the directions exactly at first but thought that it tasted a little plain so I added a bit more garlic and some seasoned salt and that seemed to help.  It's pretty good but probably would have been better in some type of white sauce rather than just the oil & butter.

Bravo! Elegant and Simple, I cooked the Aspragus with the pasta(mini shells) then sauted in 1/2 butter & EVOO. Added red pepper flakes & fresh herbs. Superb.

Excellent and easy.  Cooked the recipe as written, pretty much, except used 1 stick of butter instead of 2, and let the asparagus cook in the garlic before adding other ingredients. Yum!

This was super simple to make and delicious to eat!  Like most others, I would cut back on the oil and butter.  While the pasta drained, I just sauteed everything in the pasta pot and added ingredients as directed.  The next time I make this (and I'll definitely be making this again!) I might try adding onion in with the garlic and maybe a few other vegetables: spinach, broccoli, and/or red/green peppers.

The parmesan cheese adds the perfect touch! I, too, changed this to be healthier by using only 2 T olive oil to saute everything. While cooking this seemed like it wa going to be REALLY bland but after adding the parmesan cheese it all blended together perfectly!

I found this to be a very good recipe, but needs perhaps a little more flavor so next time I may try a Creole Season. I cooked mushrooms & 1/2 cup diced yellow onion in butter and minced garlic together & blanched the asparagus in a separate pan. At the same time I cooked pasta - I used penne. Since I used pre-cooked shrimp, I only needed to heat it up a bit by sauting in butter, a pinch of minced garlic, the lemon juice and added a few dashes of Old Bay Seasoning. When the veggies & shrimp were cooked, I tossed all together and served over the pasta. Be sure to spoon the butter & garlic sauce over the plate!

This recipe is so super easy, I had to give it 5 stars for that alone.  I'm not a very experienced cook and I felt completely comfortable with this recipe, so much so that I really didn't measure the ingredients, just "eye-balled" it.  I started with thawed ready to eat shrimp from my grocer's seafood case.  I chose penne pasta for this dish.  I got the pasta started before moving on.  I heated almost enough olive oil to cover the bottom of a standard sized nonstick dutch oven, added approx 2 tsp purchased minced garlic (this I did measure) and 1 bunch of asparagus.  For the asparagus, my husband has taught me a trick.  If you hold the stem on both ends and pull down, it will break off the bad "woody" stems.  It will seem like you're wasting a lot, but it's worth it for quality purposes.  I cut my asparagus in about 1 to 1 1/2 inch pieces.  As it sauteed, I pulled the tails off my shrimp.  I then added about 1/2 a stick of real butter to the pot and allowed it to melt before adding the shrimp.  I also added some halved cherry tomatoes. I forgot to purchase a lemon, but did have bottled lemon juice on hand and I just squirted some in. I added a small splash of 1/2 and 1/2 only because I had it on hand (for another dish and am trying not to waste it).  It doesn't really add much, just a bit texturally. The tomatoes do add some flavor.  I mixed the drained pasta in.  I will say that this was even better the following day after being refrigerated overnight. I didn't think it lack

My only substantial change was to the method (and I forgot the lemon). My noodles needed 10 minutes so I got the water boiling and a large pan heated. I started cooking the asparagus in a little of the oil then 2 minutes later started the pasta and added the mushrooms to the asparagus along with more oil and some of the butter. I skimped a little on the oil and butter but will try it again with the full quantity. I added the shrimp at 4 minutes to go and a touch of sriracha just because. I added a couple of small ladles (1/4 cup?) of the pasta water with about a minute to go. When the pasta was done I drained it (reserving some water just in case), added it to the pan, and mixed it in. Fabulous. I'm making a double batch on Tuesday for a meeting.
2016/06/04 I added a teaspoon of semolina flour to the pasta water (Serious Eats tip) to amp up the starch, made sure not to skimp on the butter, added the pasta to the shrimp mixture about 2 minutes before the pasta was done and then added the starchy pasta water a ladle at a time until the sauce was the right consistency. Even better than before but there's no room for a sixth star.

Excellent with a few modifications. I used 1 cup of half and half, 1 cup of milk. Portobello mushrooms were on sale so they ended up in the pot. Used only half the butter though, and substituted linguini. It made 3 servings as a main (perhaps I eat too much??!)

I made this recipe both ways - as originally intended, and with the addition of Dijon mustard (about a tablespoon) as suggested by a couple of other reviewers.  The Dijon does not make it better - just different.  It is nice and light without it; the Dijon just makes it richer and a little heavier.  If you are preparing this, and are curious about the effects of the Dijon, simply take a tablespoon of sauce and add a drop of Dijon - you'll get the idea without effecting the entire dish.  

Also, I did not reduce the ingredients (oil and butter) as suggested by others.  I simply removed all of the solid parts and placed them in the pasta - then spooned the sauce onto the pasta until I got it to the way I like it.  I ended up using all of the sauce.  There's no reason to cut the ingredients in half unless you know you will like it like that.  Until you know - make it all and spoon what you want onto the pasta - better to have too much then not enough.

I used frozen raw shrimp (from Costco) and cut them in half for bite sized pieces. I also used Smart Balance instead of butter.  Overall this recipe was very good.  I will make it again.  The others at dinner also liked it.   Thank you for the recipe.

This was okay for us, but not really worth the price of the ingredients.  It is certainly a good starting place, but it needs some playing around with.  I would start with (like others have said) significantly reducing the oil/butter amounts.  I also sauteed my asparagus and mushrooms just because we like them better (texturally and flavor-wise) cooked that way.  Next time I will probably add some herbs...maybe a little basil or thyme.  It's really not a bad recipe, it just needs a few tweaks.

This was delicious.  Like others, I used MUCH less oil and butter.. probably 1/4 cup oil and 4-5 Tb of butter.  I can NOT imagine using 2 STICKS of butter!  I omitted the mushrooms because I didn't have them, but I used a little more asparagus and shrimp.  I used spaghetti instead of egg noodles, used my mother-in-law's homemade grated cheese, and added just a touch more lemon juice.  Tasted great.. even my picky husband thought so.

Not crazy about shrimp but made the dish for a small dinner party. Used 41/50 EZ-Peel (between 41 & 50 shrimp per lb / vein removed for easy peeling).Tasted great! Got raves from the other shrimp eaters. Followed recipe without changing anything. Only warning is to run hot water over pasta after it's been boiled/drained as it will clump together when going from strainer to pot.

Good, but it seemed kindof bland (probably the changes I made).  There really isn't anything to give it flavor except the butter, and I left that out.  I would add more lemon juice next time, and maybe some other spice (although I'm new to shrimp so I'm not sure what you add to it...).  I used butter flavored cooking spray instead of oil to saute the garlic and added some pasta-water with the lemon juice to cook the shrimp.  Overall a good recipe, husband liked it, so 4 stars - I will make it again.

One word...WOW! I made this last night and it was wonderful. I did omit the mushrooms, added about a teaspoon of garlic powder in addition to the garlic and added about a half tablespoon more of lemon juice and served it over mini penne and it was just amazing. Everyone went back for second and third helpings so...I guess that says it all!

We really enjoyed this recipe.  I might try and make my garlic/cream cheese sauce to put into it instead of just olive oil and butter to make the sauce more creamier.  But overall, the taste was great and will definitely make again!!

Other than using less butter and using angel hair pasta instead of egg noodles - I didn't change a thing.  Asparagus is not a vegetable that is normally found in our dinner meals but it was great in this and everyone enjoyed it.  Another plus is that its pretty easy to make. Thanks Cathy!

This was deelish!  I used thin spaghetti instead of egg noodles, used the juice of one whole lemon and used Johnny's Seafood Seasoning in place of salt and pepper.  I will have this again and again - Thank you!

I made this for my family after work.  Instead of egg noodles, I used angel hair pasta.  It was wonderful!!!  My children and my husband cleaned their plates and wanted more.  Thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipe.

This is soooo good. Quick and easy! I used 2-3 tablespoons of lemon juice, a whole head of minced garlic. 2 pounds of shrimp, as others said I added some Cajun seasoning and cooked the asparagus in the olive oil until bright green and then removed it.   This could be served in a restaurant!!

This recipe is delicious and has all of the right ingredients but, like other reviewers, I suggest cooking it differently. Begin by sautéing the garlic in olive oil for a minute or two over medium high heat for n a large skillet. Next, add one stick of butter - a half cup; not a whole cup. Next add the lemon juice, asparagus cut in two-inch pieces and the sliced mushrooms. I used half baby Bella’s and half white ones. Add salt, pepper and crushed red pepper and stir frequently until the asparagus is tender and the mushrooms are reduced. Lastly, add the shrimp and continue stirring occasionally until the shrimp are pink. Serve over noodles, pasta or rice. Sprinkle grated Parmesan cheese on top.

I needed a simple recipe to cook while my kitchen is being remodeled. I cooked the whole dish in stages on an portable induction burner. It turned out quite delicious even when I had to substitute lime juice for lemon. Husband loved it. I’m anxious to try it again as is or with some of the suggestions.

This dish was delicious! My family ate it up despite me doubling the recipe. In addition to salt & pepper, I seasoned this entree well with Slap Ya Mama seasoning that I added to the mushroom & asparagus (after it was steamed) sautéing process in butter and olive oil. I sautéed the shrimp separately in butter and olive oil and used the same seasoning combination. Once the pasta was drained and I combined everything, I sprinkled about 1TBSP of cayenne pepper seasoning in it and it had just enough heat. I invited my neighbors over for dinner the next night (because it yielded so much since I doubled the recipe). My friend doesn’t like spicy foods, but she even ate it and raved about it. It wasn’t “over the top” spicy. It was perfect. BTW: my friend also ate this dish cold and preferred it that way! Go figure! Thank you so much for the recipe. I will make it again!

I made several changes to make preparation easier and better.  I chopped the asparagus first then cooked it.  Afterwards I thought maybe adding the raw asparagus to the cooking pasta for the last few minutes might work just as well and save another pot cleanup.  I knew the shrimp would be overcooked if I followed the recipe as written, and I only added them after the mushrooms were sauteed.  I used only enough olive oil to cover the bottom of my pan, and half as much butter.  As I was sauteeing the mushrooms I felt as if the mixture was telling me to add some white wine, so I did.  I used penne instead of noodles.  The end result was a really delicious dish.  It makes a LOT and I'm looking forward to leftovers tomorrow.

I used chaomein noodles and red pepper flakes. It was awesome!! Though only 4 stars due to the lack of “flavor” it was too light for my own taste. I might add more lemon juice and garlic next time.

Delicious.  The only change I made was to use coconut basmati rice instead. 
It would be equally good without the cheese.

I love this and so does my friends and family. I have made a couple of changes such as adding another pound of shrimp and doubling up on the asparagus. Everyone raves whenever I make this dish. I always have enough for 2 dinners for 6 people.

Way too much oil and butter.  If you steam the asparagus I would not instruct to cook it later with the mushrooms.  I would suggest in cooking the shrimp and then remove from the pan to cook the mushrooms.  I will make it again but cut down on the grease and order of cooking.

Recipe did not have much flavor for my taste. Also, I prefer a heartier sauce with pasta.

I changed the portions for one person,  I used whole grain noodles, no cheese, cut the butter in half. I  added more garlic, and lemon, and used string beans in lieu of asparagus, and I thought it was quite good. But then I changed the recipe so much, I suppose this is a useless review. Make it my way, much healthier, and why does everything have to have "cheese" in it ?

Made this delicious shrimp, asparagus and mushroom pasta. The only thing I did differently was to have the shrimp shelled and deveined, asparagus rinsed and snapped into about 1 1/2 inch pieces and mushrooms cleaned and sliced, all done ahead of time. Then after cooking the garlic in olive oil and butter I threw in the shrimp, asparagus and mushrooms and cooked then all together. The cooked pasta was then added and stirred for a few minutes to warm it all up. Lastly, the Parmesan cheese was sprinkled over all and stirred till mixed well. Added a couple splashs more of lemon juice. Done and served with garlic bread! Yum! Great dinner!  Thanks.           Co Karen

Good! Normally I don't make changes then rate a recipe, but I had to lessen the butter--so I did 3/4 instead and added 1/4 white wine. Plus squeezed 1/2 lemon into it. This was super yummy! And the veggies/sauce can all be in one pan! When you get to the butter step, just add the cut up asparagus in too, it only takes a few min to cook. Then add mushrooms, then do the shrimp last--it cooks so fast and gets hard if overcooked! This  recipe is fast if everything get prepped ahead! Hubby and I loved it.

This is an easy dish to make. Actually quicker for me because I just sautéed everything together rather than steam asparagus separately or cook shrimp separately. Started with the garlic, then added the mushrooms and asparagus, then added the shrimp last. This way nothing got over cooked. Put it over whole grain angel hair pasta as we don’t care for egg noodles. Sprinkled fresh parsley when serving. The only problem is it’s bland. Has potential to add flavors.

I used other reviewers' suggestions  by cooking asparagus with the mushrooms and garlic using about a teaspoon of olive oil. I only had 6-oz of egg noodles, therefore I decreased the amount of butter that I used. I seasoned my shrimp with Adams Reserve citrus seasoning as well as a little Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning. My husband and I enjoyed it. But he did say next time he'd like me to use angel hair pasta.

I used baby fussili and spinach instead of egg noodles and asparagus.  Mine was a little bland so I definitely had to add salt and then a bunch of old bay.  Then it was delicious.  I was getting bored with the same ole, same ole.  Enjoy.

As written??  Pretty good.  But the cooking steps are backward.  You will overcook the shrimp if you follow these directions.  Add them last and only cook 3-4 minutes.  Very easy to overcook asparagus also.  Awesome combination of ingredients in this recipe though.  Love it.  Great concept.

In an effort to save  on clean up I cooked everything, except the noodles, in one pan; asparagus and garlic first, then mushrooms and shrimp. It came out really good, though I think next time I'll saute the mushrooms before adding. I used way less oil than called for and I did add extra lemon juice because I couldn't really taste it otherwise. Overall, very good.

Delicious recipe, made even better with a few modifications: I only used 1/4 cup butter, added chili powder, black pepper and crushed red pepper for an extra kick and used about 3 tablespoons of lemon juice and was generous with the amount of Parmesan cheese I used. I also used  garden delight pasta to get extra servings of veggies in the fish. Would definitely make this again!

I tried to add as much flavor as I could to this recipe and did not succeed. I substituted olive oil instead of butter to be healthy and did not add mushrooms because my bf doesn't like them. However, I added crushed red pepper, 1 tbsp of fresh oregano, and sausage and I still could not impart a whole lot of flavor. The lemon flavor with the shrimp was good. A better way to integrate the lemon flavor throughout the dish needs to be found. Dunno if I'll make this again. People who recommended adding some sort of seasoning like Cajun or old bay were onto something.

This is an easy and delicious recipe, once you follow the suggestions of a couple of viewers. I cut the asparagus into bite-sized pieces and sauteed that with the garlic and some red pepper flakes (if you like heat use more. If you don't like heat, omit). I then added one stick of butter,  the lemon juice and the shrimp (which I thawed and removed all shell, seasoned with Old Bay Seasoning). I served this over rice and it was delicious. So, while the recipe isn't followed exactly, I couldn't have made the delicious dinner I did, without it.

This was pretty good. I doubled the recipe but only used 1 stick butter and 1 tiny lemon. Next time I'll add a bit more lemon.  I also added some white wine to the sauce. I used spaghetti instead of egg noodles and cooked aspargus first in the oil with the garlic and then added mushrooms after about 3 mins. Finally I added shrimp right before it was done. I kept the pasta and veggie mix separate until ready to serve. Good dish, adults liked but kids didn't.

I've made it twice.  The first time I added red pepper flakes and old bay seasoning that was recommended and used only half of the butter.   We really like it.   Last night I made it and forget the pepper flakes and old bay seasoning and it was kind of bland.

This was easy to make and went over great with my family.  Those who did not normally like asparagus liked it as well and commented positively about the taste and said make it again.  Warning to those on blood thinners I found that it blew my INR and had to take a bridging dose as asparagus has large amount of vitamin K so plan accordingly.

Italians don't use cheese in fish or seafood pasta sauces (or at least not in Tuscany, where I lived 8 years).  This pasta sauce, if you use olive oil instead of a pound of butter (or at least a combination, heavier on the oil) has the feel of an "olio e aglio" (olive oil and garlic) sauce, which can be made more savory by adding black pepper and pepper flakes. Asparagus and/or mushrooms certainly complement the shrimp, and you can go even further by adding diced fresh tomato and chopped fresh basil or parsley as a finish (uncooked). Nice recipe to build on, but way too buttery for most tastes!

This recipe, as written, is way too fatty.  I may be unusual, but foods this high in fat give me indigestion.  
The grocery store only had 10 oz containers of asparagus on sale, so I cut my proportions to about 3/4 for the entire recipe.  I used 1/4 cup olive oil and 1/4 cup of butter. It was a bit on the heavy side for me, but my family loved it.  As suggested by other reviewers, I added some creole seasoning (1/2 teaspoon) and crushed red pepper (1/4 teaspoon).   Great ideas!

Made this with extra-wide egg noodles, half the butter, and pre-cooked shrimp. Just added the shrimp when the mushrooms were almost done.  Very, very good, and I'll make this again wth ziti or penne as well.  The egg noodles were unique, I think, I don't usually think of having them with shrimp and asparagus.

Great basc recipe for many tastes. I used  brown and wild rice, with 2 T olive oil and one T butter. One hint for all dishes with garlic: always use fresh cloves of garlic, not "fresh" pre minced, in a jar or tube. Amazing difference!

This was fantastic!  I did not have asparagus on hand so I used broccoli, and added capers since my hubby loves them.  I also seasoned with Tony Chachere's Creole seasoning.  PHENOMENAL!!!  Will DEFINITELY be making this one often!

Easy and tasty; however, I thought the sauce was going to be a lemon  sauce but there was very little lemon flavor. I left the meal as it was, but did add a few more drops of lemon to my own portion And let everyone else decide how they wanted it.  I thought the lemon flavor made a huge difference in the taste, and it seemed to me that it was really the way it was meant to be. I would highly suggest adding more lemon per your own taste.

I didn't use egg noodle and as much olive oil and butter...I cut those sizes to half the recipe size.  I used fresh lemon zest and juice. I used shallots along with the mushrooms .  Very fresh and yummy.

Made the recipe as described.   Everybody loved it. I will be making this again.   I used bow tie pasta made a nice dish.   I don't like spicy food so this was perfect    Maybe add a little jalipano to add some  kick.

I made as directed.  It was tasty - but I would have preferred a little more sauce to coat the noodles.  I also added some greek seasoning, which boosted the flavor nicely.

Eh, just so so...used fresh from the garden asparagus, but canned mushrooms since I didn't have fresh. Cut back on the butter. Red pepper flakes definitely helped. This was an easy recipe so I'll probably make again but will make some other alterations.

The first time I made this I followed the recipe, but found the asparagus limp, and the dish way too oily for me. The next time I didn't steam the asparagus, but sautéed it in 2 tablespoons of olive oil with the garlic, while the pasta was cooking.  I then added 3 tablespoons butter to the asparagus, added the mushrooms and sautéed them. When the pasta was still a touch firm, I drained and added it and the shrimp to the vegetables with a little pasta water and tossed until the shrimp was done. I'll make this again!

I used half the butter.  Sautéed the garlic then the asparagus cut in bite size pieces, added mushrooms, then shrimp. Shrimp only requires 3 minutes or so, until it is no longer clear. Then added cooked penne rigate pasta. Topped off with  parmesan cheese. This recipe was awesome!

Sautéed the garlic, asparagus (bite-size) and mushrooms in lemon oo and 1/4 c butter while cooking pasta (fat egg noodles)... then added shrimp and asparagus tips at the end with a bit more butter... Easy and Delicious!  My husband loved it and he's a little hard to please with one dish dinners! Great with hot crusty garlic bread.

Followed reviewers suggestion to add creole seasoning and kept all other ingredients as required..Delicious way to prepare asparagus with shrimp..Will definitely make again and add side salad and garlic bread.  Thanks for reviews.  May add chopped onion next time.

I really enjoyed this recipe.   It was easy and tasty.  I made a few changes; added half of the butter, some white wine 1/2 cup and used wheat pasta.    I also cooked the shrimp in the sauce for 3 minutes, removed then added the mushrooms to cook.  I added the cooked shrimp and asparagus at the very end.

I cooked the pasta, drained into a colander, then used the same pan to saute the veggies and shrimp. Add the pasta back to the pan when the sauce and veggies are ready. The pasta will be stuck together, but will quickly break up when gently prodded and coated with sauce. That said...this recipe was just okay for me.

I have made this twice first time as listed.  The second I winged it and used broccoli which I quickly blanched.  I did not measure the butter, but probably only used 1/2 cup.  I also added Parmesan at the end and serve over rice.  Will definitely make again. Both ways!

This recipe is great!  I didn't have mushrooms so I substituted with some chopped zucchini.  My husband had 2 big servings.  I love the video as well.  Made it so easy and fast.  Dinner was done in no time.  This is one recipe I will be making again and again in the future.

I had to use half the butter but the flavor wasn't there like I hoped. I agree with other reviewers, you can combine a few steps. I think I would use a version of this recipe, maybe adding chili flakes, onions, peas to boost it up a bit

Super easy and fast.  I mostly followed the recipe except I cut it in half  and omitted the mushrooms. I used less butter and oil because it seemed like way, way too much. I sauteed the asparagus over high heat with just a couple tablespoons of butter and a drizzle of oil, added the lemon juice,  crushed garlic and shrimp (right out of the freezer) and covered it tightly, only opening once to flip the shrimp, then a touch of salt and pepper to finish. I dumped the whole thing over hot noodles and topped it with some fresh grated Parmesan cheese.  Perfection! And easy enough to do on a weeknight.

This dish was a huge hit with my guests and I will definitely be making it again.  I did also make a few adjustments....only used one stick of butter and 1/4 c. olive oil, did not precook the asparagus, just cut into bite size pieces and sauteed with mushrooms.  Flavor was outstanding and had rave reviews on the meal!

It all depends on taste I guess.....I thought it was rather bland.....my husband really liked it. I didn't make any changes to the original recipe.  Since I'm the cook & I get to decide,  I would have to do something to give it a little more 
umph.

The taste was fine but it was just too much butter!  At the end there was a soup of butter and oil left on our plates.  This is a recipe we'll be passing up.

I used 1/2 the butter and used lite butter, more lemon juice, added old bay,black pepper, and some spicy brown mustard.  It as really good, but not amazing.  My two year and four year olds enjoyed it.

I thought this recipe was really good.  However, do not boil the asparagus. Sauté it in the olive oil. Much better tasting.

I added some chicken cooked in olive oil and garlic when I put the shrimp into the pan.  Also, I left out the mushrooms and cut the butter to a smaller portion.  I used angel hair pasta instead of egg noodles.  My husband and son really like this, and it has become one of my regular go-to meals!

This was delicious and simple. Used frozen clean shrimp from Costco. Was just as good the next day. A good way to cook fresh asparagus.

My family and I thought this was great! Only minor changes were that we used linguine noodles and a different type of hard cheese instead of Parmesan. I cooked a poached egg at the end and put it on top of my noodles, etc. It was delicious.

I was looking for a simple and quick week night meal. This definitely fit the bill. However, way too unhealthy for my lifestyle. I decided to cut the olive oil and butter in half.  Also, I didnt have egg noodles on hand so I used udon noodles instead. I didnt have parmesan so I used sea salted white cheddar. Make sure to salt and pepper. It needs it but Even cutting the fat in half it was still amazing! Definitely will make again.

Family loved it, even the 11 & 7 year olds.  However, I would say you could do without the oil, or reduce the amount of butter.

I really enjoyed this recipe and think it will be a keeper.  This was a quick and simple dish that feels fancy.  Following the advice of other reviewers I boiled the asparagus leaving it a bit crunchy.  I used the same water to boil the noodles and threw the shrimp into the noodles at the end for a few minutes.  I chose not to use the olive oil at all.  I think the sauce is designed to be a bit like a scampi sauce.  If you want more flavor add red pepper flakes.  I also think capers would be a delicious addition.

My whole family enjoyed this, but I did change it a bit...doubled the amount of lemon juice, garlic, shrimp and asparagus and only used 1/2 the amount of butter and oil.  I used whole wheat egg noodles, and with the extra shrimp, asparagus, lemon and garlic they went well.  Used frozen shrimp which made it a bit easier.  We also grated our own parmesan cheese which boosted the flavor, since it was a tiny bit bland.  Didn't have any mushrooms but it probably would have been even better with them!

Such an amazing recipe!  However, it calls for A LOT of fat and A LOT of sodium.  Recipe tastes just as good cutting out the butter completely, replacing the cream with fat free milk, using light alfredo sauce, and cutting down on the cheese.

A wonderfully EASY and very tasty recipe.  Use it as a base and change up the pasta, and the vegetables and even the sprinkling of cheese.  The sky is the limit.

Mae this recipe as is, very good.  I had this on the table in about 20 minutes(I did buy my shrimp already peeled and ready to cook).  The only thing I recommend is that you have a pretty substantial side item..as I said this is very good, but it is not enough by itself.

This dish is excellent!  I will be making this again.  I did have a few changes but really kept it pretty close.  I only had 1/2 lb of baby bella mushrooms, but next time I will make sure I have the full lb (so good).  When sauteing the garlic I also added a small onion finely chopped(only because it's so good for you and I love it).  When cooking the asparagus I cut them in bite size pieces and sauteed the larger pieces with the garlic and onion instead of boiling(get more nutrients) and then added the small pieces later.  I also added the shrimp lastly so they wouldn't get over cooked.  Perfect!  Many people said they only used 1/2 the butter, so I started out that way but before adding the shrimp I did add the other half because it looked like it needed it.  So glad I did, the noodles soaked the extra up when I mixed it all together and it added so much more flavor and moisture.

My family loved this recipe, but I will change it the next time I make it.  It needs half the noodles and half the butter.  I would also use more parmesan cheese.  We had to dig around for the shrimp and asparagus. But very good flavor!

I made this recipe tonight following the advice of previous reviewers.  I lessened the amount of olive oil and butter, thickened the sauce, used thin spaghetti noodles, and I also juiced a whole lemon.  The flavor was amazing!  My 9 year old said, "Wow, mom!  This tastes like it came from a restaurant!"  My 7 year old was indifferent as she is with most foods.  My 5 year old said, "I like McDonald's better."  Well, I guess you can't please everyone all of the time, but I think this recipe is a definite keeper!

I made this recipe on 31 Mar 2013.  I read a number of the other reviews, most recent types, and added about 1/4 tsp Allepo Pepper Flakes and Old Bay Seasoning.  I also cut the butter to about 1/2 and not as much olive oil as well.  It was ok, but a little bland. I may try it again, but figure out how to tweak it a bit more and perhaps use a different green vegetable in it..

I made this for a potluck and it turned out really well! I didn't add the egg noodles, so it was only shrimp and asparagus. Most of the time I spent the first time cooking with regular shrimp is taking the black vines off and peeling the shell off. The second time I cooked it, I bought the EZ peel frozen shrimp from Safeway that was coincidentally on sale, so it saved a lot of time.

This is a delicious blend of flavors. I used rotini, a bit less butter. Took the shrimp out of the saute pan early to wait for the mushrooms to get done. Blended everything together, served with grated parmesan. Yummy!

I followed the instructions and it turned out good. Next time, I will cut the butter in half and increase the garlic to maybe six cloves minced. I also used angel hair instead of egg noodles. Yum!

Easy and very tasty.  Actually, it's one of my favorite recipes I've found on allrecipes.com.  I did cut the amount of noodles and butter in half.  Squeezed 1/2 lemon instead of 1 TBS.  Still served 4.

Very good. too much butter and oil though. Cut both down. Add a little red pepper flake with the garlic if you like a little kick. And if you have fresh basil on hand, throw it in at the end. Use whatever pasta you like. We don't care for egg noodle.

I used another reviewers idea and used wine and starch to thicken the sauce, cut both the oil and butter in half and it was fabulous. I loved it, the boyfriend thought it was just ok. He puts hot sauce and salt and pepper on everything though.  If you enjoy light, flavorful sauces, you will love this. If you love hot sauce and salt and pepper on ALL things food related, you might need something with more kick.

I thought an entire lb of butter was a bit much, so I used 3 instead of 4 sticks. Love garlic and lemon so I put a lot more in, I just eye it. Everything else I did as it says and it came out wonderful!

This was wonderful. I uesd fresh green beans instead of asparagus ( my kiddos haven't aquired a taste for asparagus yet), frozen shrimp, and mini bowtie pasta per couple other reviews I read.  I will be making again for sure.

I would double the shrimp. With all the noddles and veggies it seemed light on the shrimp. I would also cut the butter in half because it was plenty. Another user suggested adding some seasoning and I added onion powder and lemon herb seasoning and it was perfect!

This was very tasty, but I think it could use more lemon juice. I loved the asparagus and mushrooms with it. Went very nicely with the shrimp.

I made this dish last night following the ingredients except I didn't have any parmesan cheese.  I cut the asparagus into smaller bits before steaming above the cooking pasta.  I always heavily season with rock salt and ground pepper.  Absolutely loved it.  Will make sure to have the parmesan next time and will add some leek, maybe a small amount of fresh chilli.

This was really good.  The only reason I only gave 4 stars is because it was VERY greasy.  Next time I will cut back on the olive oil and butter.  Not too much though, don't want to mess up the flavor!

OH YES!!!  Had to reduce the butter way back and use a little olive oil (hubby and I both have serious health issues) and I used red/green/yellow Amish egg noodles.  Added a little parsley for the color and it made a very festive Christmas eve dinner.  Extremely tasty and a definite keeper!!!

We liked this.  I added Old Bay to the shrimp.  I used extra garlic and white wine.  I also sauteed the asparagus already cut into pieces like some of the other reviews mentioned.  This was a pretty easy and delicious meal.

If made as written this is 4 stars. I found it a lil on the bland side and needed to add a generous amount of garlic powder, EXTRA parmesan cheese and freshly grated parm cheese as well.

Really great recipe. Like the other reviewers, I too cut back on the oil and butter. I used about 1 TBSP for the garlic then added about 1/3 of a stick of butter. I also added extra lemon juice. I used whole-wheat penne instead of egg noodles and it still tasted great! Be sure to add plenty of black pepper or red pepper flakes for that extra kick.

So good!  I did as another suggested and just cooked asparagus in same pan, making it easier AND it would have been too done for my tastes otherwise.  I used way less butter and olive oil.  I also did rice instead of noodles cause it sounded good.  Will definately make this again!

I left out the noodles, reduced the butter and olive oil, and added onions. It was good but I would improve the recipe in the future but adding the shrimp a little later, they were done before the mushrooms were.

This is a very good recipe. I used it as a springboard to try variations. The one that I like the best is to substitute thin strips of zucchini for the mushrooms and to leave out the butter (my diet) and increase the olive oil slightly. Such a summery meal. I'll bring it out again during the long frigid winters of my town.

This is one of my new favorite recipes! I have made it a few times the past couple months and it's a hit every time. I even gave the recipe to my sister and now her kids keep asking for more. I made a small change to make it easier. Chop the asparagus first before blanching them. Margarine is also a good idea to keep it healthier, but the butter definitely makes it taste richer. I also use raw frozen shrimp from costco and it tastes just as good as fresh!

This was pretty good, but I have to say, I only used half the olive oil & butter this recipe calls for.  That said, what I would change for next time is to use the juice & zest of two lemons (this time I only used one) and I would add some salt.  I also used whole wheat fettucine instead of the egg noodles.

Really tasty and easy.  I did as another poster suggested and sauteed the asparagus and that worked well.  However, I went with real butter.  It needed some kick so I threw on a few red pepper flakes.

Delicious and easy.  I did make a few substitutions simply because I didn't have all the ingredients in my fridge.  I used broccoli instead of asparagus and garlic powder instead of minced garlic.  Still wonderful. So quick. I'll make it again and again.

This was delicious.  I changed it a little, I didn't put as much butter and oil but I added some basil and oregano.  And cooked the parmesan cheese into the pasta. Very simple and very good!

I did what another person suggested and added Grey Poupon mustard to it and it was great! I also used bow tie pasta instead of egg noodles.

This tasted OK, but the texture was not what I expected. I only used about 4 tbsp. of butter (along with the 1/4 cup oil), and everything was still just swimming in liquid. I would have preferred a crispier finish, especially for the mushrooms. They were limp and bland. Next time I would try 2 tbsp. each of oil and butter.

Excellent, simple dish! I cut the oil down to 1/8 c. and the butter down to 1/3 c. and it still had great flavor.  I used pepper to flavor it rather than the extra butter.

Excellent recipe. I cut down on things like the butter, oil, and mushrooms I believe I put 1/2 of the mushrooms. I also added a bit more lemon juice. It was very tasty especially with a dinner roll or two. My roommates loved it, so I will definitely make this again.

We all love this dish!  There is NEVER any leftover when I make it.  I've used other pasta such as fettuccini, and penne too.  A couple of times I left out the fresh mushrooms (didn't have it on hand) and it still tasted awesome.  It's a great dish for a dinner party and so easy!!

Very good recipe. I didnt see any point in the olive oil so I got rid of it and cooked the garlic and shrimp in the butter. I did cut down on that also but not much.

I have made this several times, but always feel so guilty eating it because of all the butter.  It is delicious though!  Thanks.

Though some liked this dish, I thought It was way to heavy of a meal. The flavor could use a little  something extra and there was to much butter & oil. Maybe it just wasn't for me, but I won't be making this one again.

Very good. I used onion instead of mushrooms and it turned out really well. We will make this again. Just something a little different to make using Shrimp, which we love. I would recommend this recipe.

Excellent meal. Doubled the quantity of garlic and melted the cheese into the sauce near the end of the cooking time. Added bonus - quick to prepare and cook. Will definately cook again (and again.......) Would probably work with chicken as well.

Absolutely wonderful...my entire family loved it even my very picky daughter. I think that following the recipe to a "T" makes well more than eight servings unless you are serving NFL players! No matter...it makes for great leftovers! I chopped the asparagus into 1" pieces before steaming...I believe it saved a few minutes of cooking time! This will be a family favorite for years!

Omitted half the butter and used juice of a whole lemon.  Added some hot pepper flakes.  We found it a bit dry, there wasn't enough sauce for us.  Was a bit bland, probably won't make it again...sorry.

This was good and probably not great because I didn't have lemons or lemon juice available in the house during preparation so I used about 1/2 a tablespoon of lemon pepper instead.  I don't recommend the lemon pepper at all.  I will make it again and use fresh lemon juice.
