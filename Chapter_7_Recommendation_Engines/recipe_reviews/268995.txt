I suggest mixing the spices into the oil, then pouring it over the vegetables. That way the spices and the oil is evenly distributed.
For a variation, add crumbled feta cheese.

I followed the  recipe with two exceptions,  I left out the sweet potato and the fennel since I did not have either on hand.  I was pleasantly surprised at how good this combination of ingredients was ~ never guessing that garbanzo beans / chick peas would be so good roasted.   I microwaved the butternut squash for 2 minutes after puncturing with a fork a few times just to make it a bit more tender and easier to peel and chop.  I am so glad this was the featured recipe today because it was great :)

I was surprised at how delicious this turned out. The way I did it: no seeds or squash (family isn't a fan). I cut up everything and put it in a bowl then added the oil and spices. I stirred/tossed everything then spread in the pan and baked as directed. I find that this coats everything better than drizzling them. It was SO good! My daughter and I ended up just standing at the stove with a fork and eating it right out of the pan lol
