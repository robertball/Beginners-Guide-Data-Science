Had this for Sunday Brunch.  Added mushrooms, a bit of cooked spinach and a dash of bay seasoning.  Everyone enjoyed it and it disappeared.

Yum!! Added green onion and a little bit of Parmesan but this was excellent! I did put in less parsley per a previous reviewer.

Good, although next time I would bake the pie shell first before filling and baking.  I used half & half instead of whole milk.  1/4c mayo and 1/4c plain yogurt.  Added a sprinkle of cayenne pepper along with the Old Bay.  Some finely chopped mushrooms with the parsley.  I'll make it again, thanks Shelley!

This came out really good, not too hard or runny.  I would maybe cut the parsley back by half.

Used Monterey Jack cheese instead of cheddar and used whole cream instead of milk.  Added extra cheese shreds on top.  It was divine!

I didn't have a pie crust but have made a similar recipe with no crust and wanted to try this with mayo and milk. Also no bay seasoning so added some Mrs Dash and thyme and a little onion and my cheddar was a three cheddar combo. It came out great and will make again. Next time with no onion and maybe some broccoli. Thanks

This is one of the best quiches I've made.  I did add some green onion tops and used colby/monterey jack cheese.  Perfect at 40 minutes with a premade crust.  I will definitely be making this again with krab (fake crab).  Thanks for the recipe.

This was easy, economical, and delicious! I did make a couple changes. I used Swiss cheese instead of cheddar cheese. And I used 1/4 cup mayonnaise and 1/4 cup plain yogurt. I didn't have fresh parsley so I added a few sprinkles of dried parsley

Added onions and spinach - delish!  Not a piece left.   I didn't have any cream or half & half on hand, and never made a quiche with mayo before - it turned out perfect.
