I just bought this dish from my local supermarket in Qatar today. It was so delicious I had to find the recipe. It also goes by the name Jirjir as the translation is literal from Arabic

We thought this was OK. It wasn't bad; it just wasn't great. I used shallot instead of onion because I prefer the milder flavor; otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. It just seemed to be missing something. I think some fresh herbs, like parsley and mint, would have helped, and maybe some garlic. Thanks, anyway.
