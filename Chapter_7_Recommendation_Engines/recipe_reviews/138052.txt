Fantastic flavour! I used less oil and cheese to lighten the recipe and - traditionalists, close your eyes! - I eliminated the anchovies. Instead, add 1 Tbsp tomato paste, 1 Tbsp extra capers, 1 Tbsp balsamic vinegar to cover the texture, saltiness and tang of the anchovies. Also used extra kale as others have suggested. Really delicious dish!

I work at a coffee shop that serves only vegan food cooked on the premises. We also cook 10-20 servings of each meal, so I won't account for my measurements. I try to work with whatever produce I have, which was the kale in this case. I sauteed tofu in oil, adding spices (mostly italian herbs) until the tofu was cooked. I cooked the onion, garlic, and red pepper flakes like in the recipe. I added crushed tomatoes and lots of spices and Italian seasoning.  I added the Kale and used penne pasta. This came out delicious! This is a great recipe to reference even if you don't have all the ingredients. And guess what puttanesca mean??

I think that this meal is really good, but I did add at least 2 more cups of kale greens.  They add a great amount of color and nutrition.  I also used no salt added tomatoes and rinsed the anchovies so that I could reduce the sodium in this recipe.  I will definitely make it again soon.  Thanks!

This was incredibly good for being so healthy! I changed a lot but kept the basic structure of the recipe. I used a whole onion, 4 cloves garlic, no red pepper flakes, 1.5 T. capers, 5 oz. canned tuna instead of anchovies, doubled the kale, no olives, and no cheese. I also rinsed the capers and the tuna to cut the sodium, but ended up adding a little salt at the end, probably because I used more kale and fish than the recipe called for. It came out to about 6 servings rather than 4.

This is an excellent, economical and easy weeknight dinner option! We love kale/greens and have been aiming to have at least one meat-free dinner per week. I made this last night and it is definitely making it on the rotation!
As written, the salty items may have been overpowering... I used just less than half the anchovies and capers called for and about 2 Tbsp of chopped kalamata olives. Like many other reviewers, I increased the kale - about 7 Cups - and sauteed it first in the onion/garlic/anchovies/capers before adding the tomatoes and a splash of dry white wine. I also used a half cup or so of the cooking water when adding the pasta to create a bit more "sauce". I used a protein-added whole grain pasta to truly make this a one-dish meal. 
Thanks so much for this idea and recipe!

I like this healthy approach to the recipe.  I wish the pasta would have had more sauce.  Also, I couldn't even taste the red pepper flakes although it was an entire teaspoon?  The olives in Puttanesca are really important in my opinion to the flavor.  So... don't forget them.  I used regular penne, because it's what I had on hand.  The sauce was a little salty, but after being mixed with the pasta it was fine.  I did rinse the capers.  I also added dried basil, oregano, freshly grated nutmeg (for the kale) and freshly ground fennel seed.  I also used more kale.  The kale is awesome.  I grew it in a box outside.  Thanks for the recipe.  I will try making more sauce next time.

This is a tasty and interesting mix of flavors. I doubled the amount of kale as well, and recommend rinsing the olives, capers and anchovies before adding them to get the extra salt off. The first time I made this it was waaaay too salty; my husband and I couldn't stop drinking big glasses of water for the next two hours!

The entire family enjoyed this dish.  I have to admit that I have never had puttanesca before so I have nothing to compare this too, but I would have liked it to have more sauce. I had doubled the tomatoes called for in the recipe, but it was still not enough for me.  It was a great use for kale and I will absolutely make this again.

This was a great recipe, and I'll be making it again!  I've been looking for more ways to use kale, because it is so healthy and easy to grow.  I used penne pasta, a pint of home-canned tomatoes, and 8 oz of homemade sauce, and added broccoli and peas for extra veggie punch, and omitted the capers and achovies.  This is very hearty for a vegetarian main dish.

We receive lots of kale from our CSA and I'm always looking for new ways to use it.  This is a great healthy dish that everyone enjoyed.  I didn't have anchovy and the dish was fine without them.

This was my first time using kale.  I substituted a can of albacore tuna for the anchovies and doubled the amount of diced tomatoes.  It turned out great!  I was very pleasantly surprised.

This recipe was delicious--but it did need twice the amount of kale as other reviewers have pointed out.  My whole family thought this was very attractive as well as tasty and I have made it twice by popular request.  Be sure to let the onions cook until they're soft and golden for the best flavor and texture.

This was fantastic!  I need more recipes like this - fast, simple, healthy and delicious.  I doubled the kale as suggested in other reviews, because we are drowning in kale from our CSA boxes.  I skipped the anchovies because I don't eat fish and added an extra tablespoon of capers instead.  My boyfriend requested less red pepper flakes next time, but I think he was being a big baby so I still give it 5 stars.

As I was plugging away I decided it needed more tomatoes. I added the whole large can and a jar of homemade tomato sauce. It was very much needed because I used a whole head of kale. Kale needs to be very finely chopped in a recipe like this because it is tough and doesn't soften like spinach would. I only used half can of anchovies because I was afraid it would take over. I could have used the whole can, it was fine. This is a salty dish so if you're not a salt lover beware. My family enjoyed this meal. Thanks for sharing Misha.

I would give this 2.5 stars if that were an option. The ingredients didn't come together as I had imagined, even though I stayed pretty true to the recipe (just subbed salmon for anchovy). I hope my roommate likes it because I have a lot of leftovers.

I didn't have the anchovy filets, but substituted canned tuna....increased the pepper flakes slightly, as well as the capers  and the kale (doubled it).  All in all I enjoyed this recipe...

I was looking for a recipe to use red kale and found this.  My son and I were doing the cooking and wanted to do something with less salt, so we improvised.  We used mushrooms and black and green olives instead of the capers, onions and anchovies with two large cans of crushed tomato and sprouted grain pasta.  It was amazing!

Tasty way to use up a bunch of Kale.  Made a few minor adjustments, halved the pasta (used penne), doubled the kate and diced tomatoes to increase the "sauce".  Used 3/4 tsp of red pepper flakes and it was quite spicy (and I like hot things), will probably use only a 1/2 tsp next time.  Overall a great recipe when you're looking for a different way to prepare kale.

This was awesome. I couldn't do it exactly as written because I didn't have all the stuff, but I think it would have been even better as written.  I had to sub canned mushrooms for the canned olives, and I misread the amount so I had a lot of extra mushrooms. I also didn't have any anchovies. I used whole-wheat penne instead of angel hair, and I subbed chili powder and cayenne for the red pepper flakes. My diced tomatoes were 'italian style'.  Anyway, we enjoyed the pasta with kale. Given my subs, I didn't have any trouble with it being too salty but I can see how other reviewers would get a too-salty sauce. You would definitely want to go short on the sauce with a salty sauce.   Definitely will be making this one again.

I was a little surprised how easy this was to make, and it tasted great! I did double the amount of kale, and used a can of anchovy fillets in olive oil with capers. I used some of that excess oil to saute the garlic and red pepper flakes which added a nice anchovy flavor without all of the extra salt. Some people commented that this was very salty, but I think using anchovies in oil tempered the saltiness, so I will definitely make it that way again.

LOVE kale and always looking for new recipes. Took the advice of other cooks, used a whole onion, added more garlic and crushed red pepper(actually used the South African Pepper Blend from Trader Joes). Also added a few fresh tomatoes because I had them on hand.  I was a bit disspointed after making the dish.  Thought it would be more flavorful and spicy.  Then I added 1/2c of red wine and and let simmer on the stove.  Put the dish away in the fridge, served the next day the flavor had improved tremendously.  For the leftovers I added some spicy sausage, probably not what the writers intended.  Overall, I really liked this dish, with and without sausage.  Will definitely make again.

This was delish!  I followed the recipe, but I'm not a fan of Anchovies, so I used some anchovy paste to add some flavor and texture.  It was perfect.  We belong to a CSA so we will be getting a lot of Kale this summer and I will absolutely make this again!

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe very much.  We didn't add anchovies as we had none.  We will be making this again.

this was delicious!  To make more sauce, use a cup of the cooked pasta water to add to the sauce. Yummy!

This recipe was delic!!! I didn't add anchovies or capers and used rotini instead of angel hair pasta. My very picky husband inhaled all of it and then rated it an 8.5 which is very high for him. I will definitely make this a regular dish in our home.

Outstanding recipe!  But you definitely have to double the amount of diced tomatoes.  Pairs great with Barefoot Sweet Red Wine.

What an interesting and appealing blend of flavors! After mixing in the pasta, I was concerned that there were too many noodles for the amount of sauce, but it turns out that the sauce is so flavorful that a little goes a long way. I rinsed the anchovies, as another reviewer recommended, and the dish definitely was not lacking in salt!

this was delicious. i had some kale leftover after making zuppa toscana so i did an ingredient search and found this. i made this at my mom's to go with some grilled salmon. i used anchovy paste so my younger sister would eat it. everyone loved it. it was so good it could stand on its own as a main dish with some crusty bread. thanks for a great recipe.

Great!  I used frozen chopped spinach instead of kale, kalamata olives since I think their flavor is so much better than black olives, and a little anchovy paste instead of anchovy fillets to "hide" them from my husband.

This is fabulous.  Minor changes in that I doubled the onion, garlic, hot pepper flakes, kale and used the entire 14.5 oz can of  tomatoes.  The flavor is outstanding.  Thanks for recipe.  A Keeper!!

When I saw anchovies on the ingredient list I knew this would be a daring recipe but it turned out awesome! I used double the kale and diced tomatoes and added artichoke hearts which I highly recommend. I will probably add double the amount of capers, at least 50% more anchovies and slightly less angel hair next time since I don't think there was enough of this wonderful sauce. All in all I'm definitely going to make this again!

I am a big puttanesca fan wanting to add kale to my vegetarian diet. This was just great and I'll make it again soon! The only changes I made were that I used a 14 oz tin of tomatoes rather than having some leftover, and I reduced the dry chills ton1/2 tsp...however, I may up that amount because the recipe was not hot for the amount of pasta. Definitely a keeper!

I thought this was easy to make, relatively healthy and very tasty! I didn't think there was enough fluid in the sauce so I added double the diced tomatoes (or you could use tomato sauce). I used green olives instead of capers, anchovies and black olives (just because that's what I had on hand and the others aren't to my liking). I also doubled the kale to get the extra benefit of this great vegetable and did not find it too much at all. I put a tbls instead of tsp of chili pepper because I like things spicy. I'm going to customize this in my recipe box and try it over chicken and in omelets. It's a great tomato-based sauce that can be used in a lot of dishes.

Anchovies made it super fishy and overpowering despite my rinsing them thoroughly.  The texture was great but the offensive fish odor and taste were so potent that I couldnt finish what was on my plate, my wife couldnt take more than 2 bites.   If I removed the anchovies I gaurantee this could be at least a 4 because everything else went together great.

I changed the recipe a tiny bit.  Instead of using diced tomatoes I cooked down a bunch of Heriloom tomatoes.  I omitted the anchovies.  I servied it over butternut-squash pasta.  The dish was wonderful.

So surprised this wasn't better.  'Much improved with the parmesan cheese, & since I increased kale & tomatoes, more red pepper; but still ... kinda wondered why I made it ... Oh, yeah, to use up the kale I had. :D  It wasn't bad, just got that "sooo?" reaction.  :/  I'll keep lookin'!

This was fantastic and so easy to make! Kale is so nutritious that I've been looking for more recipes using it. I was worried the anchovy would overpower the dish, but its flavor just blended in and added to the delicious flavor. This is definitely a winner and a keeper.

Holey Yum! Needed to use up some extra kale in the fridge and this was a perfect choice. Didn't have anchovies, but based on another review's suggestion, used balsamic and tomato paste instead. Loved the combination of flavors. Thanks!

I wasn't sure initially how the kale would work, but the recipe turned out quite well and we enjoyed the flavors. Like others suggested, I doubled the kale. I also halved the anchovies (and  didn't rinse them) and used green olives instead, both of which provided plenty of salt.

Very good! Used six ounces pasta, omitted anchovies...did not have...and red pepper flakes.  (Generally don't use red pepper flakes as the seeds play havoc with dental work.) Good recipe using kale. Definitely will make again as I'm trying to add/increase foods that support my immune system. Thanks for an excellent recipe!

fantastically tasty, and very easy dish (especially if you buy prewashed, precut kale in a bag like I did). I used more kale and parmesan cheese then the recipe called for, just eyeballing it. Was a hit! To those who generally add salt to dishes without even thinking, make sure not to salt anything- the olives, anchovies, and capers are all plenty salty on their own.

I made some changes to this recipe since I am not crazy about anchovies and my wife does not like spicy food. It still turned out delicious. I am finding more and more ways to cook Kale and this was a delicious way to do it.

I've made this twice so far.  The first time I pretty much followed the recipe accept for using kalamata olives and adding portobello mushrooms.

The second time I used ribbon zucchini instead of pasta.  

Delish both ways!

I love anything puttanesca! The kale was a surprising addition that didn't take away from the spicy elements and added color. No Italian recipe that I have seen uses onion in puttanesca, just lots of garlic. No self-respecting Italian uses Parmesan cheese with fish pasta, either! That being said, Ieveryone (including me) who eats puttanesca regularly varies the recipe with each cooking. Feeling spicier? Add more peppers. Feeling healthy? Add more kale (in this recipe). The beauty of eating pasta in Italy is that there is just enough sauce to enhance the pasta, which should be of good quality. Spaghetti or bocatini is traditional with puttanesca, not the thinner angel hair (ANGEL hair for a "puttana"?). I expect that is the reason the sauce didn't coat the pasta enough to satisfy.

After reading the other reviews, I made some of the changes others suggested. I rinsed the anchovies and capers to decrease the salt content, but my partner thought that decreased the anchovy flavor and suggested I not rinse them next time. I doubled the amount of kale, added a full can of diced tomatoes (about 1.5 cups rather than the 1 cup stated in the recipe), and because the kale looked as though it needed more liquid to cook properly, I added an extra half cup of water in cooking the sauce. I had some leftover tomato paste in the refrigerator I thought I might need to thicken the sauce up at the end, but enough liquid had evaporated with the lid slightly ajar that it wasn't necessary. I did reduce the red pepper flakes to 1/2 teaspoon. I'd have been happier with the full amount, but my partner thought it was fine. I'd make the recipe again, though it isn't something I'd expect to make often.

It was OK. At least I got to use up some of the kale from the garden.

I followed this recipe exactly and really liked it. It's very flavorful and you can increase or decrease the amount of spice to add more dimension. Will definitely make again.

Yummy. I didn't measure but essentially followed the recipe. At the ended it was missing something so I added a little basalmic vinegar and a couple of tablespoons of pasta water to help it coat. Delish. Wishing I had made more

Made this with 20 cherry tomatoes cut in half and a 8oz can of tomato sauce. Turned out great!!! I used green olives too, and less...because SOMEBODY in my family does not like them.

This was a good recipe.  I used sardines instead of anchovies (just did not have anchovies).  In the future I will not use as much red pepper flakes (maybe 1/3 as much).  I'd add more Kale and would add mushrooms and possibly a little tofu.  Delicious and nutritious.  Try it!

I've never bought anchovies before in my life and wasn't sure if I'd like them or not, so this was a new experience. I threw them in the food processor to hide them from my kids, though. I followed the recipe exactly and it was fantastic. My kids gobbled it up! Thanks for sharing!

This is a wonderfully satisfying dish. I, however, used chopped, bagged Kale which was a mistake. Whole leaf kale with the main rib removed is critical. I used regular pasta because I think whole wheat pasta is vile! I would not make this recipe with any pasta other than angle hair. I think heavier pasta would take away from the dish. For those who aren't into anchovies - not to worry! The flavor imparted is very subtle (and necessary) and not at all "smelly fish" as some might think.

Not very good, my husband who I thought would love this...could not eat it, neither could I. The anchovy needed to be soaked and the salt taken out. Not just rinsed. Very disappointed.

I really deviated, but it came out nice anyhow. Not bad for a strange combination of ingredients.  I didn't have capers, and I substituted a can of tuna for anchovies. Didn't have tomatoes, so I used some tomato juice instead.  I sauteed the onions in coconut oil because I don't have butter.  It all still tastes GREAT!

We loved this recipe!  I needed to use up half a bunch of kale so I doubled the amount of kale (as others suggested) when I made it.  Leftovers are also tasty!  One reviewer suggested rinsing the anchovies before adding them - I agree!  However, if you are not partial to anchovies - you don't really taste them a lot so no worries!
