I used this recipe as a side dish, but it could take center stage too, with the addition of chicken or shrimp.  I wouldn't change a thing, though because I forgot that the directions of recipes don't change when scaling, I mistakenly only used two cups of Parmesan cheese, instead of four cups (I doubled the recipe).  Honestly, I couldn't tell anything was wrong and didn't discover my error until after all was said and done.  Though in restrospect, the sauce was thinner than one might expect.  My discriminate wife rated this one a 9 on a scale of 1 to 10.  I would certainly agree.  It's a fabulous recipe.  I bought a more expensive brand of Parmesan cheese and grated it immediately before use, and I highly recommend doing that.  Spending a couple more bucks to get good cheese is definitely worth the investment.  I've tried and reviewed over 200 recipes at allrecipes, many of them very good, and this one is certainly in the top 10%.

This recipe is great!  Definitely a keeper because it is rich, creamy, and has a good flavor.  It also does not separate like some other recipes that I've tried.  HOWEVER, I am surprised that no one has really commented that 5 cloves of garlic is a bit too much.  Don't get me wrong, we LOVE garlic, but 5 cloves???  We only used 3 cloves and it was still very strong.  I can't even imagine what 5 cloves would taste like!  Unless you want your sauce to be overpowered by the garlic, cut down to 2 or 3 cloves.  We also used regular whipping cream instead of heavy whipping cream and it turned out perfectly.  NOTE: For those of you who got a lumpy sauce, don't use the Kraft parmesan that is in the green can!  That stuff has been processed and will not melt correctly.  You must use the stuff that is in the refrigerated cheese section of your grocery store.  You can find them in wedges or preshredded bags, but it must be fresh.

I was a little skeptical of this recipe because of the garlic and raw egg but I saw so many positive comments in the reviews that I decided to select this one over all the ones posted on this site.  I made this in addition to the ham meal for Christmas and it was a huge hit.  The fettucini alfredo connoisseurs at the table said it was "to die for".  I would definitely recommend this.  

The only thing I did different was to add shrimp.

Fantastic alfredo recipe!! Real parmesan cheese and raw egg are key to a good alfredo.   You don't really even need the garlic (although I put garlic into anything I can and it's great in this!).  For those who have yet to try true Parmesan cheese, parmigiano reggiano, 'cuz grating it looks like too much work...if you have a food processor or blender, just cut it up into chunks, throw it in and give it a bunch of  pulses...out comes finely grated cheese.  It's so worth the extra few minutes effort for this sauce.  Delicious recipe!!!! Thank you Greg.

Rich, creamy, and oh so good - not for those of us counting calories (I don't even want to know)!  I highly recommend using unsalted butter and cutting back the garlic to 2-3 cloves and using fresh parsley as opposed to dried. I also added a pinch of nutmeg.  I used half parmesan and half romano but might use half parmesan/half asiago next time.  My husband loved this and said it's better than anything you get at a restaurant.  We served it over pasta with grilled chicken.

This puppy is a show stopper. health freaks need not apply! great as a side dish with blackened chicken or fish. Ease up on the garlic if your not a lover. Make this for a first date and there will definitely be a second.

If you love garlic & cheese this is a great recipe.  I decided to use a little less garlic next time as 5 cloves is a bit overpowering.  I found that when you first add the 2nd cup of cheese the texture is very gooey but if you keep wisking it at a low temp. it will thin out a bit.

I have made this recipe lots of times and would strongly reccomend it. Everyone says it tastes like- or is better than- restaurant fettucine alfredo. Very quick and easy! I boil a couple of chicken breasts, slice and toss them with the sauce and   pasta. Gourmet comfort food.

A hit! I Decreased butter as others said, and sauted 6 oz prosciutto with the garlic. I had no cream so I used whole milk and thickend it with some cornstarch. I also added 10oz box of frozen peas to the pasta in the last few minutes of boiling. Next time I may use more milk/cream to stretch the oh-so-good alfredo sauce a little further! My husband said it was a great meal to come home to, Thanks!

This turned out horrible! I probably did something wrong since everyone else's dish turned out nice and creamy.  My sauce curdled so badly..I think it was because i didn't turn the heat low enough or maybe it was just the egg. I ended up with globs of cheese and a pool of butter on the bottom of my dish. I think I will just stick to the alfredo sauces I normally buy in a jar.

Followed recipe to a T and I was very happy with texture, flavor, and ease of recipe.  I grilled some chicken with seasoned with salt, pepper, and a little cayenne and the family said it tasted better than restaurant dish.

This recipe was fabulous! I have been looking for a good Alfredo sauce for some time; I shall look no further.

I doubled this recipe since I have a large family. I ended up with leftovers. Although I doubled the recipe, I did not double the garlic and found that the five cloves were perfect with a doubled quantity. So, if I do not double it in the future, I will use half the garlic. I DO have to wonder if some reviewers were using five bulbs of garlic instead of 5 cloves, however.

My sauce also ended up a tad thick and had to be thinned out with some milk. In the future I will cut the cheese amount, just a little. 

I agree with other reviewers who insist on the fresh parmesan. It makes ALL the difference in the flavor.

One note of puzzlement with other reviewers: Why on earth are some people questioning the egg yolk? If you put egg yolk into a COOKING sauce, it won't be raw when you consume the sauce! I don't understand some people's way of thinking. 

Enjoy this recipe! You won't be sorry you tried it.

Wow!!!  Without a doubt the BEST Alfredo sauce.  Dinner was ready in no time.  Perfect weeknight meal.  As far as the "lumps" as previous reviewers noted...maybe it's the type of cheese they used.  I used shredded parmesan, found in the chilled case (next to other shredded cheese, butter, etc.).  I had no problems with taste or presentation.  This recipe is a keeper!

This was one the BEST alfredo sauces I have ever tasted!!  Ditto to other reviewers who say it tastes better than restaurant alfredos!  This is a must-try recipe.  To add a little something else to this recipe when I made it, I used three different cheeses (grated of course): parmesan, romano, and asiago in lieu of just using parmesan.  It adds that much more flavor!  Great recipe, Greg!

The recipe is wonderful; I followed the recipe as written and the whole family loved it.  I was a little concerned because there are no spices, except the garlic, but it did not need it.  Next time, I might add some white wine or lemon juice.

Don't leave the sauce on the stove once the cheese melts, if you do it'll separate. Mine was smooth and creamy, but I left it on the burner to see if it would thicken a little more, and instead it separated!;(

This has a 5 star taste but the egg ended up sticking with the cheese into a gooey mess so it gets 4 stars.  I followed directions to a T and also used the good parmesan cheese. I think the problem was the timing of adding the egg.  It really needs to be added at the last minute right before mixing sauce with the pasta. Will do that next time...or just thicken with flour instead of using egg.  I added mushrooms and prosciutto which I sauteed with the butter. Garlic amount was great just as stated in recipe. Oh, I also used fat free half and half.  This was not to blame though since the sauce was perfect until I added the egg :-)

The sauce was good, but not great. That sauce was extremely thick...thankfully I used the five cloves of garlic or it would have been too bland. I think with a bit more cream and a bit less cheese it would improve the texture quite a bit.

I had a dinner party for 10 people at Christmas. A week before, I tried and compared 4 different Fettuccine recipes at the same time and had my husband pick which one he liked best. Hands down, this was the best!  I had several people ask for the recipe.

I did leave out the garlic because I like a more traditional Alfredo. This is very much like the recipe I've been using for years, except for the egg yolk. I love this addition, I just mixed it in with the cold cream like when making pudding. The egg yolk makes the sauce thicker and creamier. I love it!

This was a good recipe, but not quite what I was looking for.  Followed the recipe exactly (added more garlic though, as we LOVE garlic over here).  The garlic flavor was great with the 7 cloves I used, but my main issue is with the sauce consistency itself.  The base flavor is very cheesy and very traditional.  However, it was too thick.  I ended up only using about 1.5 cups of fresh Parmesan as it was getting too thick.  If I had used all 2 cups it would have simply been a fondue.  As it was, as soon as it hit the plate and started to cool it began to congeal and I think this is due to the amount of cheese.  All that's really happening is the melting of cheese and I'm not entirely sure that the ratio of liquid to cheese is right.  We liked it, but it was quite expensive due to the required amount cheese (reasonable triangle parmesan here is just over $10 a triangle).  I'll probably make this again, but cut down on the cheese and increase the cream, or even potentially use half heavy cream and the rest half-and-half.  Otherwise, a great start, and if you can figure out a way to lower it's congealing point, it's great!

Hands down the best and easiest (in that order) fettuccine alfredo recipe I have ever cooked or tasted.  Classic recipe with bold simplicity.
The parmesan must be chosen wisely as this makes the difference in my opinion.  Don't skimp on price and get something grated fresh and high quality.  Sartori Sarvecchio is my favorite.
Take the tip to stir frequently serious or you can mess this up in a hurry.  Also take the advice to get your pasta started first (and everything else you may be having for that matter), because you want to serve this right away when the sauce is done...  
Can serve with sliced grilled or pan fried chicken, or a nice cut of grilled and sliced beef tenderloin on the side...and some good grilled or baked fresh garlic/butter bread.  DE-LISH.

Yum!  The only thing I did was add a little flour to thicken it.  Otherwise it was the best alfredo sauce I have ever made!  Mixed it with chunks of Farmer Sausage for a YUMMMMY dinner.  Thanks!

Delicious and amazingly simple. I did not change the basic recipe at all but I did turn down the temperature when I added the cheese.   Good quality parmesean is a must.  It melted in smoothly and pretty quickly.  I added mushrooms, onions, bacon, and pan seared scallops and this became a gourmet meal. Try this recipe; you won"t be disappointed!!

Oh, my. I had such high hopes for this recipe, but for me it was an almost complete failure. Even though I followed the directions EXACTLY, I ended up with a gloppy mess. The cheese (and I used good quality cheese, which I grated just prior to cooking)would not melt properly - there seems to be too much cheese in proportion to the liquid. My finished dish was oily from too much butter, with globs of cheese spread throughout the pasta. I have a feeling that even if the sauce had melded properly, I would have considered it too cheesy and buttery. Thanks for the recipe anyway, Greg, I see that the majority of testers loved it!

This is an excellent tasting alfredo, but you do need to prepare it and serve it fast. Have 911 on the other line.. because the heart attack won't be far behind.. This is yummy.

absolutely wonderful! We love pasta dishes and this sauce was a hit with everyone. I grilled some boneless chicken strips that I had marinated
in Italian dressing overnight. Cut the chicken in
strips and served over the pasta. Great recipe!

This is by far superior to all the other alfredo recipes I've tried, and I'd tried alot! You'll just love this! Only thing I changed was to cut down the amount of garlic to about 1/3 and that was about right for our tastes. Thanks for sharing.

The sauce took a little bit of massaging, in part due to the amount of butter called for.  1/4 cup would have been plenty.  I skimmed off about about half of the melted butter which reduced it to a creamy consistency. I used penne paste, and added shrimp, peas, and sauteed mushrooms to complete the dish.  I also added Romano cheese to soften the bite of the Parmesan.  Hubs took seconds, so I suppose it was a success.

I had never even tasted alfredo until I made this. I cut the recipe in half to prevent too much waste in the event that I wouldn't like it, but I was careful in making sure all ingredients were halved so as not to throw the recipe off balance. I'm not sure if I messed up badly somewhere along the line or if alfredo is simply not my cup of tea, but I ended up not eating the sauce.

This alfredo sauce had a lot of potential and could have turned out better had we made some changes to the original recipe.  The sauce was so thick that it was difficult to spread over the pasta.  This recipe called for so much parmesan cheese that the flavor and texture was overpowering.  We added basil chicken to the pasta, which really saved the dish.  Next time we will definitely reduce the amount of parmesan.

I stumbled upon this recipe when I first started cooking and it has been go-to alfredo for the past six years.  I don't change a thing to the recipe; it is very garlicky, but I happen to love garlic and did not find it cumbersome.  The sauce does separate pretty easily if it sits for too long though so make sure to serve immediately.

This was excellent! Just a note, I used half and half cream and becel to try and cut down on the fat a little, and so if it still tasted this good I can't even imagine how good it would taste with the real thing! This is going to be a regular.

it's a keeper. thick, heavy, rich & cheesy, but sometimes you're in the mood for that. after reading 3 pages of reviews, i started conservative:

tried with 3 minced cloves, could use more. next time will step it up to 4.

used bagged grated parm (it's what i had on hand), no clumping or seperation issues, here's how i did it:

stirred constantly, whisk at first, switched to a soft spatula as it got thicker. added cream slowly off heat, whisking. back on med heat until bubbly, then add cream/egg mix, added very slowly while whisking. added dash of nutmeg, and less than 1t parsley. could use more of both.

the on/off heat thing may be a function of my crappy cooktop.

used less than 1 cup of parm. quite 'cheesy' at that.

hubby rated my conservative version at 4 stars. maybe we'll add spinach next time, definitely more garlic.

If you're concerned about the healthfulness of this dish, try using low-carb or whole grain pasta, Smart Balance instead of butter (no transfats and quite a good taste), Evaporated skim milk (straight, not diluted) instead of the heavy cream, and less cheese.  Many reviewers seem to think this is too much cheese anyway - just use a good quality parmesan, NOT that pre-grated pap!  I have not actually tried these changes with this particular recipe yet, but have with similar recipes with good results.

I've never made fettucini alfredo before, but consider myself an alfredo-snob when tasting restaurant and frozen-dinner attempts. I made this dish for a potluck, and it was a huge hit. I kept all of the high-calorie ingredients, wanting to have the best tasting alfredo sauce possible. I even added chicken and fresh mushrooms. It was incredibly good, packed pounds onto my friends (who weren't complaining at all), and reheated fairly well as leftovers (make sure you rehead on low on your stovetop). This was better than what I've had at many restaurants, although the shredding of hard blocks of parmesan cheese made me grumble more than a few times.

The Best!!  I used other's advice and cut cheese in half.  I actually flip flopped the heavy cream and cheese measurements, using 1c. cheese and 2c heavy cream.  It came out perfect.  I think the key is to stir, stir, stir while you're gradually adding the ingredients to the garlic and butter.  And I stress, gradually,.  I will use this sauce as my only Alfredo.  We all loved it.

I'm sure this recipe is great, given all the 5-star ratings out there, but I wanted to put in a warning to all novice cookers - if you're a beginning cook, this can be quite difficult to make!  It's very easy, for example, to burn the garlic, or to let the cream boil too much, or to overcook the egg, or to not get a smooth consistency.  By all means try it at home, but maybe stay away from using this recipe for the first time at a dinner party!

The best alfredo sauce I have tasted.  I cut down the garlic by a half and reduced the cheese by a quarter, based upon the reviews.  Next time I will use the grater side and not the shredder side of the grater as it took forever to stir in such large pieces of the shredded parmesan.

Absolutely to-die for!  I added cubes of cooked chicken at the end and it was so delicious!  I would cut back on the parmesan cheese though - maybe to 1 1/4 C...it was a little too cheesy!

Not bad, but not great. I has only 3/4 cup of 15% cream. I compensated with 1/4 cup of milk (I only have 1%). Even though I used those, I still found I had to add more milk because it was too thick. I did use freshly grated parm but  I found it was way too cheesy and clumpy. This recipe is overall OK, but with some tweaking I think it could be great. Next time I attempt this recipe I will use 3/4 cup of 15%cream, 1/2 cup1% milk, 1 cup freshly grated parm and 1 cup of gruyere. I think the texture will be much smoother.

Not a keeper here, the sauce separated and there was too much garlic for an alfredo sauce.  I may have done something wrong, but will keep searching for a different recipe.

Overall was quick and simple to make but definelty has too much garlic! Next time will cut it down to 2 cloves, also will probably cut the butter down to 1/4 also.

It's a bit strong with all the garlic and cheese, I would probably cut both in half but that's just me.

So good.  I try not to use out of a can or jar anything and this sauce proves my point, it's way better.  I made it and froze a lot for use as side dishes, calories ya know.  I would love to bathe in this though.

Fantastic recipe!  I've tried the other Fettuccine Alfredo that has a better rating but I like this one better.  I added bacon, mushrooms, and green onions.  Even my picky 2yr old loved this one.

I made this for a pot luck at work and it went over really well.  I kept the sauce and noodles separate and the sauce reheated very well.  I did have trouble getting the sauce to thicken so I just used some flour and made a roux and it was perfect!

Very tasty, and nice and thick.  It really sticks to the noodles- yum!  I used the regular Parmesan in the green bottle and it had trouble melting.  I had to put my sauce back on the heat and stir it more to get the graininess out.  Ditto on the sauce seeming very salty while I was cooking it, but with the noodles it was fine.  We added spinach- I just poured the hot water and the noodles over the raw spinach in the strainer and it cooked enough.  Real/ fresh parm next time!

Disappointed, but it's prob my fault.  Doubled it.  I added some whole milk w/ it, used less butter.  Then it was too runny.  So I added some flour.  Greasy and clumpy. :(

Sooo good!! I've been looking for a good Alfredo sauce and this one is it! I would suggest you make double for what the recipe calls for.  Pasta taste soo much better with lots of sauce.  Definitely use the real Parmesan cheese and not the pre -grated stuff

This Fettucine Alfredo stole the show at dinner last week..I am about to make it again!

The only thing is I gave it 4 stars, because it has nothing like chicken or shrimp or anything in it...but if you put that in it...this dish is divine!

Best alfredo sauce out there!

tips : 5 cloves of garlic is a bit strong... i cooked 4 cloves in the butter, as directed, but before pouring in the cream, I removed the garlic by passing the metled butter through a cheese cloth. Also, using salted butter makes it a bit too salty, so next time i would use half salted butter and the other half unsalted.. or just use unsalted butter and add salt later. Make sure to shred well the parmesan cheese (food processor works best) or the sauce will have clumps. I also like to add a bit of white wine for a more "refined" taste (about 1/4 cup)

enjoy!

WOW! This was exactly what I had been looking for. Fettuccine Alfredo is my favorite dish, and this is just as good as one of my favorite restaurants'. The only thing I added was red pepper flakes for a little pazazz. I can't wait to make this again!

Beginners this is an excellent recipe to try, not tough at all and delicious.  I felt the sauce was a bit greasy, recipe calls for half cup of butter (1 stick), I recommend trying it with ¾ of a stick, rather than the whole stick, maybe add a tiny bit of milk to make up for the difference.  I made this recipe for 4 on New Year’s Eve and was a big hit, also made Stuffed Pork Chops (Gouda Cheese and Bacon) from this site to go with, excellent compliment.  Check out that recipe as well and read my review for a tip with that.  

Happy New Yr’s ’08, and happy cooking…

so so so good. better than most restaurants. i sauteed chicken in a pan with olive oil and garlic, set it aside while i made the sauce, and then added the chicken in at the end. this is one of my favorite things to make and everyone that i have made it for loves it.

"This is one main attraction" is what my son said when he took his first bite. I've been using the Lipton Sides dishes for Alfredo, but it's nothing compared to what I made tonight. I've always wanted to make Alfredo sauce but was kinda hesitant after reading some good and bad reviews. But all in all, my version was kinda lumpy even when using fresh cheese like what members have suggested. When you add the cream/egg mixture, you MUST add it slowly than you think and keep whisking. I think that was my mistake for not doing it, now I know for the next time I make this. 

I doubled the recipe and made a few adjustments. I kept the 1/2 cup of butter and cut down on the garlic to 2 Tbs. Even then it was still too garlicky for me, I might use 1 Tbs the next time I make this. I used 3/4 cup of pre-grated Locatelli Romano cheese. Once it was done I served it over Fettuccine Florentine..... mmm...mmm...MMMM...!!!!

I had such high hopes for this based on all the good reviews but ultimately didn't really care for it. We love garlic but the amount of garlic in this recipe completely overwhelms the flavor of the sauce. The addition of the egg yolk is unnececessary (you can thicken the cream sauce by just reducing over low heat)and adding it just increases the chance that your sauce will curdle. Not bad but not great. Keep looking for the perfect Alfredo recipe. This isn't it.

PHEW! I'm FULL.  Delightfully Full.  As happy as I would be at the Olive Garden Full.  This sause makes a PERFECT appetizer for dipping bread, too.  My 1 and 2 year old were quiet the entire meal and only spoke up to yell "MORE!"  They ate and ate and ate and even my husband said it was "Wonderful."  

I'd like to reconmend using about 1.5 teaspoons CRUSHED GARLIC.  I also CUT DOWN ON THE CHEESE a little and was sure to use HEAVY WHIPPING CREAM.  

Wonderful Meal.  I plan on emailing it to all of my friends.  Definately a top addition on my rotating meal list.

Thanks!

OMG, this was fabulous!  very close to the olive garden's version...but perhaps a bit better nutritionally. i decreased the amount of butter, as suggested, and added the cheese to taste (didn't use all that the recipe called for).  it was a good thing i implemented portion control while cooking because i'm sure i could've had 2nds and leftovers.  definitely a keeper, but definitely for special occasions.

This is a very rich recipe.  It was very good, but too rich.  I only had 1/2 cup of cream and I added 1/2 cup of whole milk and even that was too rich.  I will probably just use 1/4 cup of cream and the rest milk.  I also cut the cheese, as per other reviewers, down to 1 1/2 cups and I will probably cut that down to 1 cup.  Don't get me wrong, this is a fantastic alfredo, just too rich.  I will make again, probably over and over, but I will cut down a little on the richness.  Too heavy on the stomach as is.  I used the Basic Pasta (submitted by Pat) from this site for this and it was great!!  Thanks for the recipe, Greg.

Delicious, and so easy to make! Per other reviewers' suggestions I cut the garlic down to 3 cloves and the cheese down to 1 3/4 cups.  I also left out the egg.  This goes great with steamed broccoli, and the Toasted Garlic Bread recipe from this site.  My boyfriend and I have made this for both our families, and it met with rave reviews each time. :)

This is THE best!  I used freshly shredded Parmesan cheese from the grocery store (it was less expensive than the hard triangle suggested).  The sauce was perfect.  I served the alfredo as a side dish (main dish was Chicken Piccata II, also featured on this site).  It was a delicious, artery-clogging dinner (but worth it)!

I don't like cooking and always look for the easiest italian recipes. My husband and I LOVED this one (and he's very picky)! It tastes exactly like at Olive Garden! Good tip on tringle cheese: though a bit more expensive than one in cans/bags, it was well worth it. I used 16 oz of pasta and there was plenty of sause as is.

Probably deserves a five star rating, however since I did not have enough cheese on hand I followed someone elses review suggesting that you use 2 cups of cream and 1 cup cheese.  Mistake.  It did not taste bad at all, just was not really alfredo.  Plus I love cheese.  Will definatly use the recipe version next time.

great recipe, I added chopped spinach at the very end to make it florentine and substituted Romano for the Parmesean(Romano is a more robust flavor cheese)and doubled the garlic(which I probably do for most recipes.)

Used the alfredo sauce for a dish at Christmas. Used tri colored tortellini, grapes, and Walnuts. It was a hit. Fantastic alfredo sauce.

The recipe came out pretty good except for the fact that it was WAY too buttery.  I would use half a stick instead of half a cup next time.  Also, this dish did not reheat well at all so if you're making it, make sure you eat it all at once.

This is absolutely the best alfredo recipe I've ever had.  Restaurant quality, yet quick and easy.  I left out the raw egg for health reasons and it still tasted fabulous!  I plan to make this a lot.

This recipe was good but soooo rich.  I'd make it again but I think I'd use half n half instead of the heavy cream to try to lighten it up.  I also cut back the cheese to 1 1/2 c. but would use less next time.  The fresh parmesean has a much stronger flavor than the kind you buy already shredded.

Awesome recipe!!  And so easy too.  I followed the recipe exactly, freshly grating the parmesan cheese myself, and had no problems with texture, melting, gooeyness or flavor.  My guests thought this was a restaurant quality sauce.  I would use the parsley as a garnish though instead of mixing into the sauce.  But a really great recipe!

I'm sorry guys.  I followed this recipe exactly as written and I was disappointed to say the least in the taste.  I had such high expectations and I felt the sauce was very "garlicy and cheesey".  In fact, maybe a different type of cheese should be used.  Anyway, I will continue to look for an Alfredo recipe that I can serve at an important funtion.

This is the best alfreado I have ever made!  Everyday my husband asks me if I will make it. He loves it!  It is so much better tasting that what we use to order at our favorite Italian resturant.  It is also very easy and very quick to prepare.

This recipe for alfredo is the best EVER!! I cant even remember going to a restaurant and tasting fettucine this good.  Plus it is very easy to prepare.  I cooked it last night for my husband with added herb chicken, red onions and yellow bell pepper, and he LOVED IT!  Also great with garlic bread!!!  For the chicken recipe looked under Herb Chicken & Fettucine recipe on this site.  THANKS!

I love this recipe!!  Simple to make and tastes amazing.  I originally thought that the dried parsley was going to be too much, but it was just the right amount.  The only change I made is I mixed my cheeses; I used 1 cup of grated Parmesan and 1 cup of Romano because I like the flavor of the blend.  Hope you enjoy it as much as I did!

This is a great recipe, with modifications in addition to the fresh garlic (minced) I also added:  1 large minced shallot, 1 tsp lemon zest, salt, pepper and added 2 tsp cornstarch as I wanted a thicker sauce.. the cheese I used Parmigiano-Reggiano.. sooo delicious!  I also reserved 1/2 pasta water after draining, as I added the noodles on the stove top and added pasta water to break it up.. This was a huge hit and we have very picky eaters at our house!

Absolutely delicious!  My husband had some roasted chicken with his while I included steamed broccoli with mine. I refuse to use heavy cream in my cooking so I used 1/2 & 1/2 and it was perfect.  Will make again! Thank you for such a wonderful and easy recipe!

This was delicious.  I made the following mods: used real parsley, doubled the cream, added two pounds of pre-cooked shrimp, and 3 slices of crumbled bacon.  Also, I used parmesan cheese that was already shredded and in a plastic bag.  Didn't have any trouble with it at all.  I stirred in the shrimp and bacon in the last 2 minutes of cooking (right after the cheese was stirred in).... then sprinkled on the fresh chopped parsley.  With these mods, the recipe fed 6 people.  (I also cooked a 16 oz box of noodles, rather than 10 oz).  ENJOY... my teenagers loved it!

This recipe is hands down the best fettuccine Alfredo next to my favorite restaurant.  The key ingredient is the egg is changed the whole cosistence immediately to a rich and creamy alfredo that sticks perfect to the noodles.  to heat perfect next day add a little half and half and some more parmesan and romano and it is delicious all over again the second day.  enjoy.

Made this recipe for myself and two people - one person LOVED it and the other thought the sauce was way too buttery (2 sticks is a lot, admittedly). I personally really liked it, but was well aware of my calorie intake while I was eating! I guess that's to be expected when you make alfredo, though.

I made this for my extended family so I had to triple the recipe.  They loved it.  My father refuses to eat anything without some form of meat in it so I added crab meat to his portion and he seemed to like it.  Definitely not diet food, though, so won't be making it very often.

I liked this recipe.  I cut the recipe in half as I only needed a small amount...was making the pasta as a side dish.  AND I cut back on the garlic. I was serving this to my kids as well as myself and felt that 1 clove would be plenty.  (someone else commented on that as well.)  I also used half and half instead of heavy cream .....thought that I had the cream and realized that I did not.  Had hoped that it would taste alright and it did. Will make again as my kids ATE IT UP!!!

By no means should you use 5 cloves of garlic, I used 2 and it was still a little too garlicky. The sauce was super thick so I thinned it with whole milk

With so many rave reviews I thought this was a winner but, I didn't care for this alfredo recipe.  It wasn't bad but is wasn't good.  This recipe calls for too much garlic that I think overpowered the dish.  Also, the amount of cheese was to much.  The sauce never completely got smooth so there was a gritty texture with every bit.  And yes I did use parmesean reggiano in the triangle form.  Maybe I didn't cook it long enough but I could taste the egg in my sauce.  I will not be making this again.

Absolutly the best!  I'm not a big alfredo fan, but this recipe changed my mind.  I did add Tuna so there was some protein.  We loved it...even my 3 and 4 year olds loved it.

ABSOLUTELY the best Alfredo Sauce.  Got rave reviews from family.  I used it on ravioli and it stayed creamy and delicious.  Most alfredo sauces absorb into pasta and makes a clump, but this recipe stayed creamy.  Used 4 cloves of garlic and it was just right.  SUPER!  Thanks for a keeper.  No need to look further for a recipe for alfredo sauce!!! I think I'd like to try it with crumbled cooked sausage next. UMMMM!

The perfect fettuccine! Topped it off with chicken and it was amazing! Once refrigerated, though, the sauce sticks to the noodles and when I microwaved to reaheat it didn't turn back into the original delicious sauce but a melty cheese coating, which was kind of strange but also delicious.

I liked this recipe but my husband said it wasn't cheesy enough. I might try it again with more Parmesan. If you shred your own Parmesan cheese, make sure you do it ahead of time! I thought I could do it while an earlier step was cooking, but this recipe is very quick, so I didn't have time.

Oh my goodness...this makes the most amazing alfredo sauce.  So creamy and rich.  I used a mixture of romano, asiago, and parmesan cheese and used a little less than called for.  I also added a sprinkling of red pepper flakes to break up some of the richness of the sauce.  I thought I was in heaven!

I screwed up the recipe by letting the sauce sit for a few extra minutes and reheating instead of serving immediately because it was a secret surprise dinner and the guest of honor was late! So the sauce got very thick and chalky. But I could tell it had the potential to be very good if I hadn't messed up! 2nd time will hopefully be better cause the boyfriend loved the whole dish and wants me to make it again! Also, I used minced garlic instead of garlic cloves. And I served it with Lemon grilled chicken.

We loved the texture of the alfredo.  And the fresh parmesean is a must!   I also sauteed broccoli and mushrooms on the side then mixed them with the alfredo.  Everyone asked for seconds all around.

I thought that this was very good.  I was looking for a base alfredo that I could turn into chicken dijon alfredo.  I didn't use any parsley and I added both dijon and a little dried mustard and salt and pepper along with the chicken into the sauce.  It turned out great!  Otherwise, I used the recipe as is.  Definately not too much garlic, but maybe a little less cheese.  I like my alfredo just a little thinner.

This was one of the best I have ever made.  I did cut the parm. like some said.  I used only 1 1/4 cps.  I would definitely use a 1 lb. of pasta next time.  My neighbor had some fresh basil and rosematy.  I added it with the galic.  Not a lot.  A couple of broken up sprigs and leaves.  I also through in a couple of sprinkles of nutmeg before serving.  I served it with tequila-lime marinated turkey breast.  It was yummy.

I followed the recipe and directions exactly and the sauce turned out perfectly.  

The only problem was the recipe itself...

Way, way, way too much cheese.  I think the cheese could be halfed and it would still be too overpowering.  I'm actually surprised to see this recipe rated as highly as it was...I could only tolerate about three bites before throwing it out.  Perhaps it would be great with less cheese.  I'll try it again at some point.

I had high hopes for this and was sadly disappointed. I used just 2 cloves of garlic it was too much and the expensive triangle parmesan. I ended up throwing this out and making a simple recipe without egg and even used regular shake parmesan cheese and it turned out so much better, surprisingly.

I've been looking for the perfect fettuccine alfredo recipe for a long time - this one is it!!!  If fettuccine is available in a restaurant, that's what I order, and I can say without a doubt, that this was better than any restaurant!!  I didn't think the 5 cloves of garlic was too much.  The fresh grated parmesan is the key to this recipe.  I didn't alter a thing.  Next time, I'm adding crabmeat or shrimp.  I'm throwing away my other alfredo recipes!!

Great recipe, though I have to admit I changed it a little. I didn't have fresh garlic or heavy cream on hand and after reading the reviews, I decided to alter it some anyway. Here is what I used:
8 oz parmesan - food processor worked great to grate it up; 12 oz pasta; 1 stick butter; 1 T garlic powder; 1 can evaporated milk; 1 egg yolk; 2 T parsley. Other than that, followed the recipe. This is as good as any restarant's! And pretty easy! Yum!

This really is a great recipe for alfredo sauce.  I sauted some shrimp & mushrooms before making the sauce & added them at the end... yum, yum.  

I didn't add as much butter (to save a little on calories)& used only 1/2 the parmesan (to save on the cost) and it came out just great!!

I've made this several times now and we love it as it is.  To make it a little more healthy for my mother-in-law, I now cut the parm down to 1 cup and add 1 cup of fat free cream cheese.  She likes hers with chicken so I cut up a couple of chicken breast and season with garlic powder, pepper, put into a skillet with a little evoo and fresh mushrooms and saute till done, top fettuccine and a little extra fresh basil.  She loves it.  Thanks so much for the post.

Was not to my family's liking.  My kids would not even eat it.  It had an overpowering parmesan taste.  I think it could have had half the amount of cheese.  My husband is the cream sauce fan and he said not to make it again. Sorry.

Soooo yummy.  My husband isn't a big pasta fan, but he absolutely loved this alfredo sauce.  I also used it to bake chicken and fish in too.  It was so delicious.  I love all the garlic. :D

This was very good and went well with my family.  However, there was way to much garlic.  I will definately make this again, but with much less garlic.

This was very good the second time I made this.  The first time I accidentally bought the wrong kind of parmesan cheese and it was VERY strong tasting.  I made the 2nd batch last night with the right kind of cheese and it was much better. My husband who is very picky did like it, but it could have been a little thicker.  I am hoping that it will thicken some after being in the fridge over night.

This recipe was excellent! The only thing is, just watch the size of the garlic cloves that you select! Make sure that they are small or else it will overpower the dish.

I made this recipe about a year ago and it is the one I always use when I make alfredo.  I forgot how garlic-y it was so hopefully next time I remember to cut down to 2 or 3 cloves.  I love this sauce!

My husband says this is the best fettuccine yet. And I've made many. Fresh cheese makes such a difference. I must admit that I do not eat it. I'm addicted to too many foods as it is now.

The flavor of this recipe is pretty good, but we thought it was way too cheesy. I used half and half instead of heavy or whipping cream, and two large cloves of garlic instead of five. My mistake was using roasted garlic fettucine, which made the dish somewhat bitter.  After I added the first cup of cheese, the texture and flavor was perfect. After adding the second cup, though, the sauce separated, leaving globs of cheese and butter pooled at the bottom of the pan.  SO, next time, I will use regular fettucine and one cup of cheese.
Thanks for the recipe!

My family absolutely LOVES this recipe!  I did use only one clove of garlic, as I found that to be plenty for us.  I've made it three times, and once I added shrimp before serving.  My family devoured it!  This is the only fettuccini recipe I will use from now on!  Thank you for sharing!

This recipe was awesome! I added brocolli and a bit more garlic, and it went over very well.  When making this, just make sure the cheese melts or else it will turn clumpy.  Many said it was too much garlic, but I liked it! Very good! Thanks

This was ok, but the garlic was so overpowering I couldn't eat it. It was also too heavy on the cheese.  Next time I'll halve the garlic and switch the quantities of cream and cheese.

The best alfredo sauce ever.  I steamed broccoli and sauted chicken breast strips to accompany the dish.  Truly a delicious recipe.  This recipe required no alterations.  My husband raved about the meal and asked to take leftovers for lunch.  Thank you for the awesome meal.

I tried this a couple of days ago and got rave reviews.  I'd highly recommend this recipe.  The only change I made was to cut the parmesan to 1.5 cups and add half a cup of romano just to give it an extra kick.

GREAT recipe!  Easy and quick, (except for grating 2 cups of parmesan).  Very rich, could not eat a lot of it but restaraunt quality and turned out creamy instead of clumpy (like others I have tried.)  Thanks!

This was not bad. I actually made it a while back and then again this week. When I made it the first time I added some shredded romano cheese and I thought it was great. But this time around I followed the recipe and it just seemed it was missing something. We ate it for dinner but I wrapped up the leftovers and took them to my parents who said it was great. Of course everything taste better the next day so.....Im going to keep trying different sauce recipes.

I have used this recipe for 3 yrs now and me and my family love it! Taste just like the olive garden fettuccine alfredo. I use a bit more garlic and add shrimp. For the people that say its to clumpy and the cheese does not melt, They are not making it right. Not very healthy but taste ooo so good! Thanks Greg for the great recipe.

All alfredo recipes are easy to make, this is no exception. However, the special preparation regarding the egg yolk is brilliant! The garlic browned in butter adds a very nice flavor.  This certainly isn't the healthiest recipe, but it is wonderful!!! Better than all other alfredo recipes I have tried.

Yes, excellent.  I would recommend however, for those who enjoy a bit more salt, a teaspoon of salt.  Other than that, very worth the time to make.

This is BY FAR the best Fettuccine Alfredo recipe we have found...PERIOD!  
A little background; One day, I was surfing the net, looking for this genre of recipes and stumbled upon this one.  When I read the reviews regarding this particular recipe, I was skeptical based on all the five star ratings.  But I tried it, and honestly, this is the best and a must have.

This is a very good recipe but I do recommend making a few changes to the original version.  When my wife and I made this for the first time the sauce was far too cheesy and wasn't very creamy.  If you cut the parmesan cheese in half it will make a much better sauce.  Also we used light cream instead of heavy cream and it was still very good!!!  We will make this recipe again.

I ended up with a clumpy mess.  The parmesan would not melt.  We still ate it, and it tasted good, but the consistency was more like a stuffing that you might use for a mushroom or shrimpt.  I followed the directions to a "T".  Could someone maybe tell me what I might have done wrong to make it come out like this?

This recipe rocks! I have never made Fettuccine Alfredo before.  This was so easy. I cut up chucks of the cheese and put in the food procesor to save time.  I added cooked chicken strips, a dash of pepper and I was done. My boyfriend was impressed. A must try. Thanks so much.

This sauce was very delicious and rich, just like a restaurants.  Next time I might cut back on the amount of parmesean cheese, perhaps between a cup to a cup and a half.

This recipe was very tasty!!  I did not have heavy cream, so I used a little bit of corn starch to thicken it up.  It turned out wonderfully, next time I will not add as much thickener.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is a very good sauce but you may have to try it a couple times before you get it the way you like it. For me, the sauce tasted a little too much like parmesan (it may have been because I only used 4 cloves of garlic), so I'd recommend using a little less cheese.

I liked this.  I added some mushrooms.  I also added some grated Romano cheese, instead of ALL Regiano Parmesean.  It gives it some kick, otherwise these recipes become bland.  I also added a bit of chicken stock and a bit more heavy cream.

Wow! This alfredo sauce tastes like what you have on fettucini at expensive restaurants! I am thoroughly impressed at how easy and quick it was. The taste is a little bland, but I added some pepper and the taste was outstanding. Nice garlic flavor and aroma. This is absolutely excellent in all areas.

Loved this sauce! Extremely easy and quick...Due to dietary (medical) needs in our family, I added cut up roasted chicken to the sauce...equally wonderful. Now, I just have to find out how to get the cheese off my pan!!!!

I wasn't sure about the egg in this recipe, but I followed the directions and I really enjoyed it.  I love garlic and this had a great garlic taste.  It was also thick which I like because sometimes when I make alfredo it is too thin.  Thank you, Greg for a great recipe. :-)

Absolutely fantastic. This sauce is much better than the pre-made stuff found in stores. You can skip the egg, use both yolk and white, your choice. I substitute the fettucine for whole wheat penne pasta; the thick, gooey sauce gets inside the penne holes when you mix it together. Delicious!

I made this  and it was wonderful!  Followed recipe exactly, my entire family enjoyed and have asked for it  many times since.  We sometimes add broccoli and it's very good with that addition too.

Easy and delicious Alfredo sauce! I agree with the others that say to grate your own parmesan. I've tried to make Alfredo in the past using the pre-grated shaker-bottle parmesan. It's never melts and tastes gritty. I grated my own cheese for this one and it was so smooth and silky. Also, I didn't chop my garlic. I used a garlic press. Worked just fine. Enjoy!

Lovely recipe. Did’t Separate and get grainy. I didn’t use quite so much garlic and I added some fresh ground white pepper and left over grilled chicken. Delicious.

THIS IS AMAZING!! Highly recommend. I added about 1/4 cup of water because it was just a little thick! But other than that it was great. I also used 5 cloves of garlic and it wasn’t too strong!

A great recipe. Pro tip: Sauté mushrooms in a separate pan, and add them after the parmesan. Also, add a minced shallot to the melted butter along with the garlic. Flavor is next-level.

My husband and I both loved it but I think next time I’ll use less oil just to make less calories. I doubled the recipe because I like to freeze food for days I don’t feel like cooking and it freezes great!!

Made it as written but found it to be a bit bland. It was just missing something but I'm unsure what it is. I added grilled chicken to it which made it a little better but the sauce needs work.

We added bacon and broccoli to make it have more taste. If you do add bacon, go lighter on the butter. Also, the bacon makes the cooking time longer. But it's worth it.   :)

Delicious! I used the full 5 cloves (maybe even a pinch more) and did not find it over powering at all, but then again, I love garlic, so it may just be my personal taste. I used salted butter, which made the sauce a little too salty, so I'll use unsalted next time. Overall a great and easy Alfredo sauce that was perfect for a chilly winter dinner.

Yum! For some added goodness I added some mushrooms and spinach to the pan when I was sautéing the garlic. Served with grilled chicken. Went down a treat for the whole family, including the 11mo.

Such an amazing dish! I would suggest seasoning it with salt pepper and olive oil to the sauce to create a rich flavor. Amazing for dinners and lunch.

Easy and very tasty!  The whole family liked it, but thought there was too much parmesan.  I confess that I was afraid of that and had already cut back some on the cheese.  When we make it again, we'll use half of the called for cheese.

I'm giving this recipe 4 stars because I've tried other recipes using cream cheese & they are by far better. I used an old recipe from my mother's magazine collection. I think it was a cooking magazine dated in the 80's. I loved that Alfredo sauce a whole lot better & will stick with it. This was good, but not as good as the other one.

*Warning* I did alter this recipe. I basically used the same ingredients minus the parsley. In the beginning when sautéing the garlic and butter I added Italian seasoning, salt, black pepper, and baby Bella mushrooms. After that I used the same steps while substituting the cheese for parmesan reggiano and mozzarella. At the end I also added chicken that I made before hand that had been marinated in citrus-garlic herb mix. I have to tell you this is the best Alfredo I have already had!! I will never again use store bought Alfredo sauce!!! This recipe taste so much better and takes about the same time it would to heat up a can sauce on the stove.

So easy, Soooo good! Freshly grated Parmesan is a must.  My only suggestion would be a little black pepper to taste and chopped parsley for color.

The flavor was delicious!! I think it was too much butter though so next time I will use half that butter and I only used one cup of Kraft Shredded Parmesan. My family loved it. I added grilled chicken to it too.

Good flavor.  Had never heard of or used egg yolk when making alfredo before, but it definitely added richness to the flavor and thickened nicely.  I used coconut milk instead of cow's milk and it worked fine.  I did need to turn heat up and simmer while whisking to fully melt cheese.  This was after adding the egg and whisking on low heat.

I am eating leftovers of this right now, so good! I made this for my mom who was visiting us today and it was my first time attempting alfredo, and it came out really good! I made it with baked chicken that I marinate in Italian dressing and coat with a garlic bread crumb/parm mixture.I will definitely be making this again.

Very good alfredo sauce. I have since modified it ever so slightly. Instead of parmesan cheese, I usually use gruyere and another type of cheese that I have on hand. I also add white pepper and cayenne pepper for a kick prior to adding the cheeses. I also cook the noodles to al dente in heavily salted water, drain, then cook the rest of the way in the sauce. I think it makes it taste better.

Excellent! Very rich and savory. I chopped up some fresh spinach and put it in, was delicious.  I make use a little less parmesian cheese next time for it had a very intense flavor.

Chris and I loved this, although we tweaked the recipe a bit. Instead of 2c of parmesean, we used 1c parm and 1c mozzerella. I took the left over to work the next morning. It was a little work reheating, because the butter seperated from the whipping cream, but once it was well mixed it was even better than the night before.

I am not sure what I did wrong, it was probably my fault.  But my sauce came out clumpy.  I follow directions to the letter (although I ommited the parsley, cause I didn't have any on hand)  There were clumps of cheese all over, and didnt have the creamy consistency I am used to.  I will try to make it again, just to see where I made a mistake.

Okay. I think leaving out 1/2 of the cheese would leave this sauce with plenty of flavor. Very rich.

Taste was good, but sauce was runny and gloppy. I did use quality parmesan cheese. Sauce was light yellow because I used a free-range organic egg yolk that was very orange in colour. Will keep looking for a fettucine alfredo recipe.

Just tried this for a quick dinner with steaks and salad. It was great! I only had about 1 1/2 cups Parmesan, but that's OK because more may have been too much. A little heavy on the garlic, and we LIKE garlic. I use unsalted butter to control sodium, but I didn't even need to add any to the sauce because I salt my pasta water well, and the parmesan is salty enough. Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

It came out a HUGE gooey mess. This was probably my fault because I didn't follow the instructions and I did use grated Parmesan from the shelf, that's why I can't grade it down. Before I added the cheese, the sauce looked beautiful...I was so excited until the cheese messed everything up. I will try again using fresh Parmesan that I grate myself (darn it!). I will update my review as appropriate.

Fantastic! I've been searching for a good alfredo recipe that would give me restaurant-quality results, and this is it! This obviously isn't health food, but it was worth every calorie-laden bite.. so yummy. I served sauteed spinach and balsamic tomatoes with it. Wouldn't change a thing. Thanks so much for the terrific recipe!

Very good! I actually did use bottled parmesan and it tasted great and worked great! It didn't come out quite as smooth though so if you want very smooth sauce I would suggest block or grated parmean! Delicious I paied this with spinach and cheese calzones! Very good! Very Italian!

Love this recipe, have made it many, many times. I sometimes use a smokier cheese and that works too. The garlic is the best part. I've reduced the cheese many times and cooked the garlic in a mere teaspoon of olive oil. Same taste, no butter.

Loved it!  It is very garlicky, but that's part of what I loved about it.  If you aren't a garlic fan, just cut back -- it'll still be a great sauce.  We added shredded chicken from the rotisserie chickens at the grocery store.  Super easy and super yummy.  Even the kids loved it.  Thanks for the recipe.

Pretty good. It was creamy and the butter didn't separate out after it sat a few minutes. Next time I'll use 8 or 9 oz of pasta instead of 10 so it is a little more saucy. Served with grilled chicken on top. My toddler gobbled it up! Also, I ladled in some of the pasta boiled water into serving bowls to warm them up while I finished cooking so the pasta didn't cool off as fast.

I really enjoyed this recipe. Careful, it is really rich (fogedabout calories!) but this is just the taste I was looking for. I wish I would have cut the recipe in half as it was way too much. I used canned, grated parmesian/asiago & it was a bit too salty but quite cheesy.

Excellent flavor, superb consistency.  I had to add some fresh black pepper, just because I love it.  Everyone ate it up, and gained 10 pounds doing it.  Worth every second.

I used fresh parmesan, which was labor-intensive, but a must.  I also used fresh fettuccine, which is a must for our family.  Great, easy recipe!

This recipe is "to die for"! Rivals some restaurants Alfredo sauces. Make your own adjustments if you like, but the sauce turns out great if you don't.

This was really good and very easy.  I had a hard time picking from all the recipes for Alfredo sauce (it was my first time making sauce instead of buying a jar of it) but I am glad I picked this one.  Will never buy store brand again, this was so much better.

This fettuccine alfredo was great. I added a tad bit of garlic salt, which actually sent it right over the edge for saltiness - next time I'll just stick to the recipe. I added steamed broccoli and grilled boneless chicken to mine and it was delicious! The consistency of the sauce was perfect, and it was bursting with garlicky goodness. I will definitely make this again.

Excellent.  It is really important to serve immediately.  We had a delay in serving time and it was not as good as when it was first done.

This sauce was awesome!!  I used regular whipping cream instead of heaving whipping cream and it still came out great.  I served it with penne pasta as a side dish with my chicken parmesan dinner, it was a hit!!  No comparison to those nasty jar sauces!

Wow. What a flavour sensation! Couldn't bear to use cream, so I substituted light cream. Store was out of all but Kraft parmesan so I used the whole jar and it was fine, so fresh grated must be even better. VERY rich! Added shrimp and it was great. A real keeper recipe.

The 5 cloves of garlic make this recipe!  Unlike some of the other reviewers I didn't find it overpowering at all.  I rated this recipe a 4-star because the sauce was a bit runny.  Next time I will heat all of the whipping cream at the same time, and then pull out a small amount to warm the egg.  It also needs salt and pepper.  I ended up adding about 3/4 tsp. of salt and 1/4 tsp. of pepper, and that enhanced the flavor.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE! I have not had such a delicious alfredo sauce in years! My boyfriend also loved this as well! We had our fettuccine with caesar salad and cheesy garlic bread on the side. You MUST buy the triangle shaped block of parmesan cheese and grate it yourself for this recipe- it makes the world of a difference. It is much more expensive (around $12 for the triangle) but then when you grate the cheese, you wind up with TONS of it. I accidently bought 2 triangles of parmesan the first time I made this (thinking one wouldn't make enough grated cheese for the recipe) and once it was all grated I had to put the leftover in a tupperware and we used it for another month & 1/2 for sprinkling on top of pizza, spaghetti, etc- and we use a lot of cheese. Anyway moral of my story is don't waste your time on this recipe if you are going to use pre-grated processed cheese, it will be lumpy and ruin your sauce. Thanks again for the delicious recipe!!!

This recipe was great!  I grated the garlic cloves, used fresh parsley, and used about 1 and 3/4 cups of the Parmesan cheese (Frigo brand- good inexpensive cheese).  After adding the first cup of cheese, I slowly added the second cup and stopped it at 3/4 because the sauce was getting too thick.  I added grilled chicken (salt and pepper the chicken and grilled it) and fresh steamed broccoli.  I gave this a 4 because it was a little too rich for me, but my entire family loved it.

Absolutely delicious.  I didn't find the garlic overpowering like others did--maybe this is because I had some smaller cloves mixed in with big ones.  Use your own discretion there.  My sauce also separated  a little, but not enough to ruin the taste.  I'll definitely be making this one again--it was well worth the effort.

I followed the recipe for the most part. I used margarine instead of butter and I added an extra 1/4cup of heavy cream. I also used fresh parsley instead of dried. I baked asparagus and mushrooms in lemon juice, salt, pepper, and olive oil at 400 for about 15 minutes and added them before serving.

I think this recipe was really good, but the amount of garlic is a bit much. Maybe 3 or 4 cloves would be good. Also, it was a bit salty, but I think that might have been due to my addition of salt on the vegetables. All in all, very easy and good.

I thought this was a great recipe, but it is my first time making alfredo sauce so I cannot compare it to other alfredo recipes.  First I doubled the recipe, I made some changes, I used a fresh grated mix of cheeses (asiago, romano and parmesan) rather than just parmesan and I used fresh parsley.  I also added shrimp and peas at the end.  It was very good, I think I'll stick with this recipe for my alfredo.

I made this recipe for my husband on Valentine's Day.  It was very tasty!  The only thing I didn't like was how little sauce their was when you followed the recipe exactly.  I would definitely suggest doubling the recipe for the sauce because it wasn't enough for even two people.  Check out my pictures this recipe and the romantic table I set!

This recipe was great! Prepared it just as the recipe said and thought it was really good.  I added some spinach that was sauted in olive oil to the sauce at the very end and added the sauce to the pasta to mix and it was fantastic!

My family, ages 2-35 loved this recipe!  I had prepared an alfredo sauce a while ago that had an egg in the recipe and my family and I loved it.  Unfortunately, I lost the recipe(sticky fingered 2yr. old!)  I was thrilled to find this recipe and try it.
Will keep this one handy as I expect to use it over and over again!!!!

I loved this recipe, but I made some small changes with great results.  First,
I cut the garlic to 4 cloves, and really allowed the garlic to brown well. Next, I cut the cheese in half, and added somewhere between 1/8 and 1/4 cup of the starchy pasta water to the cream sauce.
The result was creamy, cheesey and garlicky, but not too thick or overpowering.

This was so delicious!!! I added only 3 cloves of garlic instead of 5 and about 1 and a half cups of Parmesan cheese instead of 2 cups. It turned out super...even after I was full I continued to eat it just because it tasted so good!

Good but no different than others I have tried my kids were picking out the garlic peices so maybe I would agg them whole and then remove...I think 2 cups of cheese was overpowering and the egg didnt seem to make a difference...A good receipe just not out of this world...

the best...tip: don't make pasta ahead.  plan to have sauce and pasta ready at same time.  sauce coats hot pasta and does not make a "goopy" mess like some reviewers have reported.  melds together to make the perfect alfredo.

wow--i feel really weird that i was about the only one that this didn't work for. WAY too salty from the OVER-abundance of cheese. i much prefer ragu alfredo in a jar to this...and i am NOT a beginner cook. this would have been much better with only about 1/2 cup of the cheese.

This recipe for alfredo was pretty good, but still not thick enough for me. I did use the hard cheese that I shredded (Stella) and in the frying pan it looked like it would be thick enough but  once I tossed it with the pasta it was thin and it didn't seem like it was quite enough sauce for the whole box of pasta. The cheese sauce itself was really great and had a lot of flavor in the pan, but once added to the pasta, it seemed to loose that flavor. I'm thinking that this would havae been perfect with a thinner pasta like angel hair instead of fettucini.

I have made this recipe countless times.
I use parmesan cheese "shreds" (already shredded, packaged and ready to go in most grocery stores). This comes out wonderful every time.

This sauce was so easy to make! I added broccoli to this. It was okay, there were some leftovers, which means it wasn't a homerun in my house.

Excellent recipe!  Thank you for sharing!  I only used two cloves of garlic otherwise followed the recipe.  I think five cloves of garlic for me would have been too much...two cloves was just right.  I think you could easily cook 16 oz of fettuccine with this recipe and have plenty of sauce.  The sauce does separate if you try to have leftovers so unless you need several servings I would stick to the 10 oz. in the recipe and not mess with the leftovers unless the sauce separation doesn't bother you.  The separation of the sauce is the nature of alfredo sauce so I would not count that against this review.

I thought this was excellent and so easy to make.  I added a little pepper (about 2 tsps)and cut down on the dried parsley (since it is such a strong taste).  Be sure to cook the pasta first (at least most of the way) because this sauce comes together fast!!  Have all ingredients ready to go because you need to be stirring, not measuring.  Also - I thought this was enough sauce for a full pound of pasta.

I only give this a 4 because it tasted good, but didn't turn out like it was supposed to. The parmesan didn't melt correctly, but that was probably my own fault. It might deserve a 5 if I could prepare it properly.

This is truly an excellent recipe. As good as - if not better than - anything you can get from a restaurant. Definately better than any of the canned Alfredo sauces. 

I recommend cutting back on the amount of garlic and parmesan or it can be overwhelming, even for garlic & cheese lovers. 

***Good quality parm cheese is a MUST.***

My sauce always comes out smooth and creamy, but it does not store well due to separation of the cheese and butter, so don't plan on serving as leftovers.

Very rich, high calorie dish, so plan accordingly. (Asparagus goes very well with this recipe.)

Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe. I HIGHLY recommend it.

i made this recipe for the first time, sorry I didn't like it too much and neither did the family. The recipe calls for way too much cheese, after a couple of forks full the taste gets to you. Maybe using less cheese would help! I prefer the lighter recipe for fettuccini alfredo, this one was too thick and cheesy.

This was extremely easy to make, and the flavor was great! The only problem is that the sauce was a bit too cheesy (and believe me, I love cheese), and needed just a bit more liquid. Despite that, my children absolutely loved it! Next time I might cut down on the cheese a little.

Very good recipe! I did use the chopped, fresh garlic, but I also added some minced garlic for more taste.  I thought that the sauce was a little bland once it was poured over the noodles and I'm not sure why. Any suggestions to help remedy this would be appreciated!

Incredibly heavy but unbeliveably good. I threw in some peas and steamed shrimp. I'm sure I changed the seasoning but nothing drastic. This is one of the few recipes which is not in need of TLC.

I just made the alfredo sauce to broil shrimp in but I had to save some over for the pasta after I snuck a taste of the sauce. This is without a doubt the ABSOLUTE best alfredo sauce I ever ate...I personally think alfredo sauce is tricky though simplistic to make and the flavor is not always right but this is perfect. I made one change and I used dried minced garlic instead of fresh minced garlic as this is what I had on hand. Perfect recipe, thanks for sharing.

I must say, this is the absolute best Alfredo I've had or made.  Very tasty, and so easy that my kids were able to participate in cooking dinner tonight.  The fun part will be seeing just who wins the arm wrestling contest tomorrow for the very little leftovers we've got!

This was a great recipe with only a bit of tweaking. I agree with previous reviewers -- purchase a block of parmesan and grate it yourself. We tried the kind in the bag the first time. It tasted OK, but the texture left something to be desired. Last night, we grated a block and the sauce was fabulously smooth! Also, we only used slightly more than half of the cheese and roughly half of the garlic. Very easy, very tasty. Try topping it with some grilled chicken or sauteed shrimp.

Perfect. I just used 1 1/2 cups of cheese and it was great. The whole family loved it.

This was so yummy.  The kids really enjoyed it.  Definitely use a high quality cheese.  I only had the bagged shredded cheese and it didn't melt as well as it should.  Next time I make it I will use a better cheese-maybe only 1-1 1/2 cups though. Thanks for a great recipe!

This tasted good, but was very fattening.  I don't know if I'll make it again because of that.

really good.
i didn't feel there was too much garlic but i'm a garlic lover. i also found the cheese to be the perfect amount, not too much at all.
definitely will make this again.

This recipe was fabulous! I have made it twice and I had to double it the second time for my family. Just like Olive Garden. The only thing I would change is the cheese amount. I would change it to 1 1/2 cups instead of 2 cups.

This recips was just OK - not what I was looking for. We enjoyed what we had, but something was missing and I just couldn't put my finger on it. I won't make this recipe again, I'm still looking for that one great recipe.

I voted a little higher on this than I wanted too, only because more people like it than not. :)  I made the recipe 'as is'...it was good, but I didn't think it was extraordinary like some people did.  I loved all the garlic, but felt there was too much parmesan cheese.  I might make this again, but not as a regular.  Thanks though for the recipe, it was a nice change, just not what I was hoping for.

Deeeeelicious!!!!  I followed this recipe to the tee, except that I only used 2 cloves of garlic. I like my alfredo sauce a little on the thinner side, so I'll use less cheese next time.

I'm not a big alfredo fan but made this because it's one of my daughter's favorites.  Everyone loved it.  I perhaps used a little less cheese, I didn't really measure it.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  I thought it tasted exactly like the italian chain restaurant. Thanks for a great recipe!

This smelled and tasted wonderful. So much so that I had seconds and regretted it. It doesn't sit lightly on the stomach. Divine recipe, but too rich for me and my family---all that butter and cream. I may fiddle with it to see if I can tame it a bit.

Perfection! Blows away the stuff offered @ TGIFridays, etc. I made this for two, and followed the directions exactly. Added a 1/2lb of shrimp and 1/2 of a small can of peas. WONDERFUL! Will make again this Sunday - this time with Karena's blackened chicken.

Awesome!  Made this last night for friends.  There is quite a bit of parsely in it, which tastes good, but makes it look like a sauce other than traditional alfredo.  Tastes great, though!

I made this for my girlfriend on Valentine's Day.  She loved it.  I loved as well.  I accidently added twice as much heavy cream as the recipe called for.  The alfredo sauce seemed to quickly thicken as it cooled off in your plate.  Nevertheless, it was still good.

Absolutely wonderful!  The sauce is devine and what makes it even better is how easy it is to prepare.  I added fresh shrimp to the garlic and butter and cooked them just until they began to turn pink so they wouldn't be overcooked.  I served this to my husband on our 17th Valentine's Day together.  He made alfredo on our first Valentine's Day and I made it last night.  It's sure to become a tradtion.  This is so much better than a restaurant version!

Delicious! I love this recipe. I've made it as directed & it was fabulous.  This time I made it using Irish butter with herbs & it's fantastic.  If you're not a garlic fanatic, you may want to cut the garlic in half.  Yummy yummy!

I must have done something wrong or maybe my garlic was not fresh enough because the sauce had a bitter twang to it that wasn't too pleasant.  It had a great consistency so I'll try it again next time I make alfredo sauce and taste everything before putting it together.

As a garlic lover, I would dare say that this is hands down the best alfredo I have tried.  You will feel miserable after you eat, but it is well worth it.  I have to double the recipe when I make it so that my husband can take some to his buddys at work the next day!!

This was the best Alfredo I have yet made.  I added chicken and steamed broccoli but the sauce was fantastic by itself.  I don't know if it was the egg yolk, but this was much creamier than other recipes I have tried. 
Thanks,

This was really good and easy to make.  I've tried a bunch of alfredo sauce recipes, and there are always problems with them (they don't thicken, the parmesan gets gloppy), but this one is simple and consistently good.

My family and I really enjoyed this recipe. I did cut back on the garlic because of the other reviews, but it turned out fine. I added broccoli, fresh mushrooms, and shrimp to the sauce and it was excellent. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

This fettuccine is the best!!  I add chicken with mine and only use 2 cloves of garlic instead of 5.  My boyfriend wants me to make this almost once a week because we love it so much.

Very good - would make again.  If you don't want too rich of a flavor, cut the garlic, butter, and parsley in half and throw in some shrimp.  Perfecto!

overall a very good recipe. I reduced the butter by two tablespoons and added one less clove of garlic based on others who suggested to reduce those amounts. I also added chicken and broccoli, yummy! I would make it again!

Way TOO much garlic.  It killed the flavor of the dish.  I think I would use a pinch of it next time.  Started out great, but stay away from all that garlic!!!

quite good though I used fresh fettuccini pasta instead(less cooking time, about 3 mins) but there was too much garlic, one or two cloves are more than enough, also, next time i will leave out the egg yolk, and lessen the butter content. but overall good results

This is the best fettuccine alfredo you will ever taste...I'm not much of a cook, but this recipe is easy to follow.  I love fettucine alfredo and used to order it at restaurants all the time, but now that i can make it...why waste my $$$! I make this for my sister and my parents all the time, they love it!

Tried this sauce tonight, it was great. I used 1/2 romano 1/2 parm cheese and added a shake or two of cayanne pepper. Served with cajun seasoned chicken breast and garlic bread. I did cut the garlic to 2-3 cloves as others recommended. Very Good!!

This recipe was one of the best I've ever tried.  It was completely worthy of its 5 stars.  I made it for company but I poured it over cheese tortellini and it was absolutely awesome.  My gourmet friends who were with me for dinner were so impressed and I was extremely surprised and proud of myself that I was able to whip this up so quickly and in their presence (without screwing it up).  The author was right on about using freshly grated parmesan (I put it in my salad shooter - quick work).  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Absolutely divine!  Incredible flavor and texture.  I really like the garlic added to it.  The next day there was quite a bit of butter/oil pooled at the bottom of the tupperware, so...I don't know if I'll cut back on that or not?  I don't know if that will affect my moisture/creaminess.

I've made this dish quite a few times and I absolutely LOVE it! I've made it for dinner parties as well as private dinners and it never fails to impress.  The only thing is grating the cheese is a little daunting.  But it truly is worth it!

I made this last night with two changes: I cut the butter in half and I added some chicken sauted with garlic and a little olive oil.... I must say that I was dissapointd by this recipe. From the reviews I was expecting this sauce to be fantastic, but it was only pretty ok. It tasted fine enough, and I might make it again because it was simple, but I'm not sure I like the consistency. One thing is for sure though: don't make enough for leftovers. While I enjoyed it fine last night, I was dissapointed to find today that it had seperated leaving me with sticky noodles, a pool of butter, and a rather bland dish barely worth eating...  I'm giving it 3 stars because I think it might be worth 3.5 or 4 as a dinner, but deffinately needs to be knocked down because of the leftover-factor (any pasta worthy of a 4-or-5-star rating should be able to withstand the leftover test).

Oh my gosh! This was sooo good!  I made this for my boyfriend and I added brocolli and chicken and the whole thing was gone!  I did use a little less cheese than called for but it was phenomenal!

This recipe turned out almost exactly like the Alfredo at my favourite restuarant, the only difference in taste was that this recipe was MUCH cheesier. Next time I will halve the cheese as it was a bit too rich, and will only use a tbsp of butter.  The flavour very full and the texture was like velvet. This was a VERY rich dish and will use it again for a special dinner but not on the regular menu. This only took 15 minutes to prepare so it is a very rewarding dish. Served with grilled chicken sliced on top, Sour Cream and Chive Rolls (on this site) and a leafy green salad on the side. Thanks for the excellent recipe.

This alfredo sauce is absolutely wonderful!  I added fresh parsley, fresh spinach, and shrimp to the sauce.  My husband says that it is definitely a keeper.

This recipe was wonderful!  I also cut the amount of butter in half but added extra garlic and it was a big hit.  My husband is the pickiest eater ever and he loved it.

Very good stuff!  I would use a little less butter though.
