Excellent taste and texture.  For those of you that are ending up with crumbly cake, you are over mixing the batter.  Mix it just enought to get it all blended.

Have the made the same thing for many years...people love it. Some differences though, I do not use walnuts in the batter for one and bake it at 350 degrees on 11x17 cookie sheet.

In the icing I use cream or half & half.  Bring the icing to a gentle boils, adding the powdered sugar at the very end just before frosting the cake (which should still be warm).

Would you like a little cake with your frosting!?! My friend and i made this cake and hated it. the frosting was at least three times as thick as the cake. the cake turnes out extreamly dry and brittle. this also not the easiest cake to make. i would not recommend making this cake for anytype of occasion.

I've been making this recipe for many years. This is the cake that Lady Bird Johnson makes for LBJ.  Now I figured, if it's good enough for the Ol' Pres, and he's a genuine Texacan...I'll give it a try.  I wasn't sorry. Give this a try. Very good. Thank you.

made this the other night for a school function.. once i had already melted the butter, i realized i only had 3/4 cup of sugar.. so i replaced the rest of the sugar with light brown sugar.. it worked, cause they came out great!! i made the icing just as the recipe calls for, but in half the frosting i mixed in 1/2 cup of walnuts and frosted half of the brownie/cake with plain frosting and half with nut frosting.. great recipe!  wish i had some now..

This was incredibly easy and quick---kids loved it, but my husband thought the icing was too sweet and not chocolaty enough.  The cake stayed moist for days. The cake came out of the pan well too---I unmolded the whole sheet and used it to make a layer cake---worked very well.

I've been making this for years, and it is always a hit. To those who think the frosting is too thick, you need to frost the cake while the cake is still HOT. The frosting melts and is partially absorbed into the cake. There is no need to thin the frosting.

I halved this recipe without difficulty. Moist, tender cake.  Frosting needed significant thinning with additional milk. Clean up very easy.
Just a bit too sweet.

This is AMAZING! I left out walnuts because I was taking it to a picnic at my husband's work and I didn't know if anyone (any kids) were allergic to nuts. I cut it up to be like brownies and everyone was asking what it was and for the  recipe. My husband says he can't wait until I make it again. DELICIOUS!!!!

Made this for a potluck, so good!  Grew up in Texas and this brings back great memories!  I did add almost 2 extra TBLS milk to frosting and subbed a little coffee with the water for the cake.  Make sure to frost with hot frosting on the hot cake (otherwise you will have a mess on your hands!).

This cake is soooo easy and my mother used to make this cake when we were kids but when she passed away, we couldn't find the recipe, but thanks to Allrecipes I found a perfect match. After reading other reviews I thought I could add some little hints to make this cake a little less crumbly.  I followed the recipe to the T, except I add a large box of instant chocolate pudding along with the flour.  This keeps the cake moist for days!! When the frosting is hot and the cake is hot, frost the cake and spread over the cake then, Don't wait for cake and frosting to cool.  The hot cake and hot frosting traps in the moisture!! Cake will be moist for days!! Thanks to Chantal for originally posting this recipe! You made this Texas Sheet cake lover very happy!!

I love this cake!  I made it yesterday for my son's 18th birthday.  I needed a cake recipe for my large cake pan and went to allrecipes to find one.  This cake sounded  good, and it was so easy.  It came out very tender and moist and had a delicious, delicate flavor. I took other's suggestions and added a tsp of almond extract, too.   It has a nice icing that is easy to decorate.  This is my new favorite cake recipe, and I will plan on making it whenever the occasion arises.  Thank you, Chantal!

Great cake (had to skip the frosting this time). Good texture for eating with your hands, stays moist for days. Made half a recipe in my 8x8 pan, worked great.

I just made this for a picnic and it was so easy and quick to make.  Love the fudge icing.  I did make a few changes- I added 1 tsp. of cinnamon and 1 tsp. vanilla to the batter.  We like pecans, so I used those instead of walnuts.

Delish.  Just like I remembered it.  I did add 1 tsp of cinnamon to the cocoa mixture because I never had chocolate sheet cake without it.  Icing is very sweet, but oh so good when you spread it warm onto warm cake.

Thought it was awesome.  I am a truly beginner "cook" so I like easy.  I did have to use a lot more milk (I just poured slowly until it was the consistency I wanted).  I also used one of the great ideas to put holes into the cake to let the topping ooze into the cake. Yum.

This recipe is super tasty.  My only issue was the icing was super thick.  I started to spread it on thinking since everything was hot it would melt a bit on the cake but that didn't happen.  I had to add more milk into it and beat it until the consistency was more pourable instead of gloppy.  The rest of the cake that was iced with this new icing was AMAZING and just how I remembered it from years ago.  Just a warning, having this cake around will add a few pounds to your body...it's that irresistible.

I have been making this for years and it is well received. I have a few hints for the icing: Sifting the confectioners sugar will cut down on the stirring time. Using a whisk for the icing will assist in making a smoother icing without the lumps of sugar. Lastly, I like to add 7 Tablespoons of milk. It makes the icing easier to spread. Otherwise I have found it starts to harden before I have spread it over the entire cake.

This is a "wow" factor chocolate cake, and since my husband is a chocoholic I know something about chocolate cakes! I make a lot of them! I did add a little extra milk as I was mixing up the icing, but no big deal. That happens a lot with this kind of icing...next time 5 T may be just the right amount! The icing has a rich and very smooth consistency and it looks beautiful.  It would be a great icing for a layer cake, not to mention it has a very smooth chocolately taste as well. 
The cake is moist (didn't over mix it) and the flavor is really good. 5 stars for sure.

This recipe My Mom has used for years and is always requested when she goes to family and friend gatherings. The only difference is she adds 6 T Milk and only 1/2 cup of nuts. This is a wonderful recipe and will be always remembered as "My Mom's Texas Sheet Cake" by me. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

YUM!

The only change I made was to cut this recipe by 1/3.  I only had a 9X13 inch pan and not a jelly roll pan.

This is a fantastic recipe.  It is very easy to make, very chocolaty and moist.

I will definitely make this again .

Been making this for years and ALWAYS a hit..cake is always very moist. The recipe I use (and lost) callsf for strong coffee instead of water. Try adding a little cinnamon to the frosting-adds a little something different. I add it to both the cake batter and frosting. I have also used the suggestion to poke some holes in the cake with the end of a wooden spoon before pouring the frosting.

SO GOOD!  I made 1/2 the recipe and baked in an 8x8 pan and it came out great.  I did need more milk in icing and skipped the nuts but otherwise followed it exactly.  Just what I was looking for, the icing is like fudge!

Took for Easter family get-together.  So good that family kept sneaking little pieces all afternoon.  They are begging for another a week later.

This is the BEST, most Chocolatey Cake ever!! You will not be disappointed!  I followed a couple of the reviewer suggestions and added 7 Tbsp of milk to the frosting and 5 Tbsp of cocoa to the cake mix, turned out perfect!  This cake is to die for, took it to a teacher's lunch at school - everyone loved it!  Highly recommend!  It's so easy and sooooo good!

I will have to say, this is by far, the easiest cake to make.  In a previous review, they said the cake was "crumbly." I can't even imagine what they did wrong.  It's a no brainer to make.  My mother made this all the time for a crowd, and it turned out perfect everytime!  Delicious taste with the right amount of frosting.  Excellent submission and I would highly recommend this cake to anyone.

I have made this about 5 times now and we love it as well as all the neighbors at our Labor day party.  I love this recipe because I have all the ingredients on hand.  Who stocks their fridge with buttermilk?  Not me, but we usually have sour cream!  The icing is very thin and can run over the sides of the pan, so I now do it over my sink so the excess runs into the sink.  It's a keeper!

WOW, this cake is great!! It's so quick and easy to make and ooooohhhh so good.
I've made it 3 times in the last week to take to various functions.  There's never
a scrap left over for me to bring home. I like the idea you can cut it into squares and 
lay it out on a platter - very simple.  I followed the recipe exactly. The one thing
I've had to do everytime is thin out the frosting with a tiny bit of milk. I found this made
spreading very easy.  Thanks Chantal for posting this super recipe.

This is an excellent Texas Sheet Cake.  I added 1 tsp of vanilla and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.  Didn't even get to frost them before the kids had started to dig in, so can't comment on the icing recipe.  Thank you for sharing, Chantal.

I've made this recipe often to take to work and everyone seems to enjoy it very much.  It has a great chocolate flavor and the sour cream makes a moist, tender cake.  It's good for a large group because of the size of the pan too.

I'm not a baker, I'm a cook, that being said I made this cake for Thanksgiving. It was one of my mother's favorite cakes and she had passed at the end of October. It got the greatest compliment that it ever could when my brother said it tasted just like hers. I couldn't find her recipe and this recipe came through with flying colors. Thank you

I've used this recipe for over 30 years and it's always a hit!
I put the walnuts on half of the cake's frosting for those who like walnuts and those who don't.  Served with ice cream is also a treat!

My recipe just like this one has buttermilk instead of sour cream.  Be sure the hot liquid has cooled down before you add it to eggs.  Otherwise your eggs will "cook" before you want them to.  Also you can make this in a 13 x 9 pan for a thicker cake.  It will take a bit longer to bake.  One person mentioned not liking the frosting being too thick and the cake too thin.  I let my cake cool for about 30 min. before adding the frosting.

Many good reviews.. but no one has mentioned one of the most endearing attributes of this recipe.  You can make this cake from scratch, and start it at two.. and it will be frosted by three.  to me the quick build of this recipe is one BIG thing in it's favor.. It's really sweet too, but you can cut the sugar by some amount, maybe even half... it's still tasty.  I love to make this.. but it takes a village to eat it.  AnneA

Just the best and so quick and easy.  This has become my signature cake over the last 5 plus years.  The only thing I have changed is I use Hershey's Special Dark cocoa for the cake, regular cocoa for the frosting.  Be careful not overbake and let cake cool before frosting.

This is a perfect sheet cake recipe, my grandma makes it all the time. Just make sure you use the right size pan. The frosting does set up nicely (even without nuts). Just make sure it's cooled completely before covering. Thanks so much.

I halved the recipe and cooked it in 
a 9 x 9 inch pan. I also added a bit more
sour cream. It turned out yummy! If 
you want authenticity, I'd stick with 
the original recipe and pan size. Mine 
rose higher than traditional sheet cake.

This recipe is a keeper. I added it to my recipe box. I made it for a potluck and it was devoured. It was a little heavy (which I like) and was nice and moist. The ingredient measurements proved to be just right too. It was easy to make and we really liked it!

This recipe was in my family for years and I am so glad to see that others are using it too. You can't beat a wonderful moist choclate cake. Try is with your homemade vanilla ice cream. It makes a great combo.

Use to make this cake when I was a teenage.  Didn't have the recipe and found it here.  This is a very moist cake.  Even though I am not usually a chocolate cake eater I have always loved this one.

Fast and Easy cake to make.  I made it for the first time for a pot luck, got many compliments.  We had so many different kinds of cakes that we had left overs for days.  I thought this cake tasted even better several days old!

I have been looking all over for this recipe.  This is the best.  It tastes like a fudgy brownie, with a soft shell of chocolate walnut fudge all over it.  Yeah, I am so glad I finally found it!!!  I can't wait to get baking.

The cake was delicious! Very moist, and nice texture. However, the icing ingredients were off. The icing was too thick so I ended up  buying chocolate frosting and sprinkling crushed pecans on top.

Haven't actually tasted it yet, but I recommend sifting the confectioners sugar. Didn't say that in the directions and I have not used it enough to remember. I just couldn't get the frosting smooth. Will let you know how it tastes tomorrow!

Lost my recipe after 20 yrs and was delighted to find this (same) one! Note it will be very liquidy when you pour into pan. Frosting will be too - be sure to pour onto still HOT cake or you won't be able to cover the cake at all. People swoon over this all year long - very moist and rich. I cut into circles & serve as "pucks" when the Blackhawks are playing for the Stanley cup. Tastes great with lemonade in the summer. Freezes well - you can take out what you need for company.

I've made this cake for years.  My recipe is a little different but not much.  My grown kids will not eat any other type of chocolate cake but this one!  
For those of you who are complaining about the amount of icing,  be sure to use the correct size pan or cut the icing in half. 
For those of you who are complain about it difficult to make,  it's much much easier and taste so much better than a box recipe.

Very good recipe with or without the suggested changes from reviewers.  I used a cup of hot coffee, I added a tsp vanilla to the cake batter and only used 4 cups of flour and 4 T milk.  Just delish!

I didn't have sour cream so I substituted Greek yogurt and 1/2 tsp baking soda.  Also the 15x10 jelly roll pan was not big enough I used my largest jelly pan.

It's such a moist cake, and not too sweet.  Sometimes I add nuts, sometimes I don't-just depending on who I'm making it for.  What a tried-and-true recipe!

The icing was very dry when I added my powdered sugar. I new there wasn't enough liquid between the 1/2 cup butter and 5 tblsp milk. After I added the sugar and nuts it was so dry I could hardly combine it. It turned out like real hard batter. I had to add a little milk a bit at a time until it was more liquidy. Then I kept it on the heat low and after it got hot and liquid again I poured it on the cake and it was fine. It still set up and was just as good.

Yummy!  My family loves this cake.  I didn't have all the ingredients so I halved the recipe.  I added some heavy cream, oil, brown sugar (I didn't have sour cream), and vanilla. It is moist and yummy!!!

I usually dont consider myself a very good baker, but this was the best cake I have ever made in my life! I followed the recipe to a T except used pecans instead of walnuts. Everyone loved it and begged for seconds! Will be making this one again.

Delicious, soft and very moist.  Coincidentally, my mother had alsmost exactly the same recipe.  She only made it a few times when I was younger and I hadn't had this in years.  The only difference is that hers excluded the nuts and was baked at 400 degrees a little shorter.  I will definitely make this again!

Wonderful!  A woman I used to work with brought this in for pot lucks and got me hooked.  I lost the recipe and she doesn't work with me anymore, I was so glad to find it here!  I am not a fan of chocolate box cake but this cake is divine.  Moist, full of frosting, nice light cocoa flavor - a winner!

I forgot to put in the second stick of butter and this recipe still turned out. It is fool proof! Very easy and I got nothing but compliments from everyone

This has been a family favorite since I was  a little girl. We love it so much! I like to sprinkle the chopped walnuts on top, after icing the cake. I usually leave half the cake without walnuts, to please the kids, and pile on loads on the "grown up" side!

This is a great no fail cake that can be prepared and in the oven very quickly.  I always get requests for the recipe, to bring more cake or both.

This was delicious, especially the frosting.  The only substitution I made was light sour cream in place of the real thing.  I thought the cake was soft and had good flavor, but it was "crumbly" and difficult to serve in one piece.

This was good, but not great. I think I would add more chocolate next time.  One of our kids, who loves chocolate, did not like this.

I have eaten Texas Sheet Cake many times
before but have not had the recipe.  In
my search I decided to try this one and 
it's exactly like the ones I've had!  It's
very delicious and "chocolatey" and got
raves from my family!  Thank you for a 
great, easy recipe.

A rich, delicious treat... makes a brownie-like cake with a sinful frosting.  I've made this several times now, and it always gets rave reviews.
