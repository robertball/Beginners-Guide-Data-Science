Everything was great with this except for the cooking time. The meat was still slightly tough and would not shred. I stuck it in for 15 more minutes and that turned out perfectly. I recommend setting your time for 1 hour instead of 45 minutes.

This was outstanding! Both sons were home so I made a double batch. After reading another review I made sure to cut all the pieces no bigger than my fist and I set the cooker for 53 minutes. We all inhaled it. It fell apart easily but still had some texture. I could have poured the broth in a mug and gulped it down. 

Can’t recommend this one enough.

I cut the roast into smaller pieces (2"x2"), put salt and pepper on meat, browned meat prior to deglazing the pot with the rice vinegar.  With the smaller pieces, 45 min was good cooking time.

This one's a keeper. Due to allergies, I had to leave out the garlic chili sauce, but otherwise I stuck to the recipe with extra cooking time. I served it with Thai Chili sauce and broccoli slaw with a Mandarin-Ginger dressing.

well I hate to say it but I haven’t made this recipe yet, I actually have a question for you, this isn’t your usual taco type dinner. korean food is a totally different flavor profile.      so..... I have to ask.....
