Very Yummy! Even without some ingredients. I couldn't find the sun-dried tomatoes so I left them out. I only used 3 cups of oil and doubled the recipe, which was great! There were only 5 of us at dinner and we ate every roll. My husband informed me that the recipe was a keeper! If serving for company, I do recommend toothpicks. The rice papers tend to be a little gummy.

Wonderful.  I bought the wrong kind of wraps and was unable to fry them.  We ate ours as "fresh rolls."  Just steam or run the wraps under hot water quickly and then pack full of the good stuff.  Thanks for the recipe.

These were just okay...I thought the avacado made the spring rolls a little mushy.  I would add more cabbage.

This was far too much avacado which made them mushy.  I would add more of the cabbage mixture and extra '5 spice'..

Big tip here. There are a couple of different kinds of  spring roll wrappers out there. I bought the ones that are hard and have to be soaked in water prior to use. They also do not fry well but are meant to be steamed or used in fresh spring rolls. Without even thinking, I bought those kind on my first go around and they were a huge failure. I knew it as soon as they hit the oil. What you need is the ones that are more like egg roll wrappers and I'm certain that is what the recipe submitter intended here. I went out the very next night and bought all of the ingredients again but this time used egg roll wrappers (the right kind of spring ones were not available at the store) and they were a big success. I just had a leftover one that had been in the fridge all night and they held up nicely too. The filling is very good and it all goes together well. Shiitake's are expensive so they didn't make it into the 2nd batch but everything else stayed the same. I highly recommend these using the right wrappers. If you do happen to buy the  wrong wrapper as I originally did, I bet they would be good steamed like a potsticker.
