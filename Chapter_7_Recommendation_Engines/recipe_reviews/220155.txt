Loved it. Definitely a hit and will make it again. Flan was creamy and white chocolate wasn't overbearing. Thumbs up!

Turned out great!  Only changes I made was to use dark chocolate chips and stevia instead (used about 1/2 of what was recommended for the sugar though since stevia is very sweet).

Delicious!
I was looking for a good recipe using white chocolate since my friend brought me back a humongous bar from his trip to Ecuador. This flan was perfect!  Almost like a cheesecake-flan hybrid.
So creamy and not too sweet.
