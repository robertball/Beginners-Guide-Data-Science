This was a big hit at work! Just to make it easier on me the second time I had not used the milk and caramels. Instead I used caramel ice cream topping. Both versions are tasty. Super chewy very sweet and great with a big glass of ice-cold milk!

I followed this recipe exactly but my batter was more of a consistency of regular cake batter...definitely not something that could be "patted" into the dish. But I went with it anyway and adjusted the cook times by several minutes. Overall they came out okay...not at all crunchy and more of a brownie texture. I would definitely decrease the amount of butter and/or evaporated milk before trying again.

The cake mixture was difficult to pat into pan. I dropped the remaining batter in clumps on top of the caramel mixture. We love gooey but these were a mess. I was taking them to an event the same day I made them and had to put the pan in the freezer to firm them up so I could at least cut them into bars. I love to bake but won't make this again.

I agree with everyone else. This was not crumbly it was a batter. If I make these again I will adjust the milk.

Only giving 1 because these "cookies" are a gooey mess. There's really no other flavor than caramel. Might as well just eat a caramel. Sorry not for me.

I followed the recipe exactly the batter was not something that could be patted down in the pan it was more the consistency of a brownie batter. If I make this again I would decrease the amount of butter and/or milk. I ended up just dropping the batter by spoonful on top of the caramel mixture and had to up my cooking time about 5 or 10 minutes for it to cook all the way through. If you make it the way the recipe states you can not cut it into bars. Also there was so much caramel in it the toffee chips were unnoticiable. I probably will not make this again.

I too followed the recipe exactly and my crust was to wet! I was difficult to "pat" into the pan.So I spread it as best I could then dropped more batter on the top.(not crumbled as recipe says) The bars were still good and chewy but had the consistency of a brownie. Next time I think I will cut the evaporated milk down to a 5 oz. can not a 12 oz. can. Maybe then the batter will be crumbly. Great taste though!

Well I've been an accomplished baker for over 40 yrs. and these did not work out for me. They sounded good but I too came out with a batter even when using about 2 oz. of evap milk. Maybe 1/2 stick butter (1/4 cup) instead of 1/2 cup butter? Why are they turning out so good for cs2002?

Maybe nobody noticed but I couldn’t find an 18.25 oz box of cake mix. Do they even make them anymore?  It seems that all they had at my local store was 15.25 oz boxes   I tried to add more mix from a second box to compensate  (there actually is a use for algebra in the real world) but it still was gooey. No way would it crumble. FYI, caramels don’t come in 14oz bags. It seems that they have shrunk to 11ozs.  Could someone in the BH&G test kitchen alter the recipe for today’s available products please?

These were yummy. I used pumpkin flavored caramels and it came out nice. Took them to church and they vanished
