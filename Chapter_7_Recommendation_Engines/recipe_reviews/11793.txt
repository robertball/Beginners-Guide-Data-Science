Great recipe, the flavor is BETTER! than our favorite authentic German restaurant. The nutmeg makes it so good, my family raved. I served this with pot roast in a red wine, mushroom gravy and roasted asparagus. Thanks for sharing this recipe!! **By the way, a Ziptop bag with 4 or 5 small wholes punched with a skewer was a lot easier to handle than the strainer method. The texture was more authentic as well.

These are wonderful.  My kids love them. I do not have a Spaetzle maker, so i use a flat cheese grater.  The first few times I made these I burned my hand a few times. *** Last time I used two clothespins to secure the grater to the edge of my pot.  It worked perfectly!***  No more burns and the preparation went so much quicker.

This recipe was wonderful with our Beef Strogonoff! It was a little tricky to make at first but we got the hang of it fast. One tip is to be careful not to have the strainer/colander too close to the boiling water else it may cook the dough before it goes through - making it a little more difficult.

I gave it 3 stars because its a great start. I made 2 differant batches.  The first one i made it specific to the instuctions. The dough was runny, and the spaetzle came out pretty mushy even after frying. I added almost 2 cups of flour and made a second batch, and WOW what a differance. Spaetzle should be nice and firm, not mushy.  The second batch was delish. But instead of nutmeg i used garlic and onion powder to go along with my creamed chicken. Also i boiled it in alted water. Salting the water makes a HUGE differance.

What a yummy recipe! It's super-quick, uber-easy and downright delicious. I found that by using my ricer, we were able to squeeze out the spaetzle in no time at all. With the medium-sized holes, it came out perfect.

Since first reading this, I've made it about 5 or 6 times, as we've both gotten pretty tired of potatoes, and am making it tonight, to go with the Authentic Hungarian Goulash, also found on this site.

Great recipe, Holly; thanks so much for sharing!

Geez, I love this site!

This recipe is perfect.  I made 4x the amount so we could eat some later on.  The nutmeg is a must!  I didn't have any white pepper. But oh my - sooo delicious!  First time making it. After cooking it, I ran it under cold water (saw that in a review) to keep it hard. After that, sauteed it with pieces of bacon and a dash of onion salt.  Mmmm!  Thank you!! It went very well with the Cranberry Pork Roast recipe on this site.

Perfect!  My husband is from Austria and Spaezle is a favorite of our family! I am tired of paying $5-6 a package for imported spaetzle.  I tripled this recipe because it freezes well. I don't know about using a ricer. Seems like it would make it too small, but I will try it next time.  I used a Spaezle maker.  We also make Kase Spaezle with this by sauteeing onions and garlic in butter and adding some bacon or pancetta, add the dumplings and then at the end add a cup or two of swiss cheese, (let it melt) and a dash of parsley.  WOW! Serve it up in a cast iron pan and VOILA! Just like in the mountains of Austria!

In keeping with the New Year's eve Italian family tradition of eating lentils for prosperity,I served slow cooker lentils and sausage (also from All-Recipes) over the spaetzle. It was delicious.  Frying the spaetzle with butter is a must.  Don't be afraid to use the nutmeg; it gives it a great flavor as it tends to be on the bland side. If you are going to the trouble making the dumplings, at least double the recipe (no need to double the butter though). It is great reheated.  I quadrupled it so I'd have enough to serve with my saurbraten in a few days.

Delicious. I just wonder if the recipe is really for 6 servings. We had 2 servings out if it. And we needed 2 side dishes to make it a whole meal. Other then that, DELICIOUS. Next time we double the batch :)

I am German (lived there in my childhood) and have seen Spaetzle being made by many of my relatives growing up and make them myself now. I have never seen a german use milk to make spaetzle. The only thing that the dough mixture requires is flour, eggs, a tiny bit of water, and salt (depending on who makes it.

LOVE, very similar to the spaetzle I had while in Germany. I personally would use a little less nutmeg but that's just my preference. Also, for me, cooking them for 5-8 minutes was a little too long. Basically, comparing to the texture of the spaetzle I had in Germany, they were done once they rose to the top of the simmering water which was only about 1-2 minutes.

I had spaetzle every day when I was in Germany 3 months ago.  This is as good as the best spaetzle I had there, and better than any I've had at restaurants in the US.  The nutmeg is key.  Ziploc trick did not work for me- too big a mess and made long stringy dumplings.  If you have an Ikea cheese grater, use the top with the big holes and push dough through with a rubber scraper.  This made the perfect little irregular dumpling shapes I know and love.  If you don't have an Ikea cheese grater,  you should go buy one!  Seriously, it's the best cheese grater on the planet.

(I am taking back my origional "one star rating"....I realized what I did wrong as I made this recipe for the third time last night.....I used "self rising flour" the first two times, THAT is what gave the spaetzle the mushy, airy texture.  The third time was a charm!!!  Perfect texture, perfect flavor, and EASY!

We love these...especially after they have been sauteed in the butter!  I put my batter into a ziplock and squeeze out the dumplings.  They are probably larger than traditional spaetzle this way, but they work well for our family.

Tip:   With Grandparents from Germany, I had these often growing up, usually with some type of pork, with gravy poured on top (or occassionally with butter and salt and pepper). However, we prepare the mixture in a bowl and then dump it onto a cutting board and with a butter knife, cut little pieces into a pot of boiling water (keep them small); and after cutting, drag/push dough to edge of cutting board and actually dip your knife into the boiling water and it comes right off).
My mother always made enough to have left overs the next day.  My mother would fry the leftovers in butter (sometimes with onions), until they became a little crispy, and that is how we ate them.  Another great way to serve them is with pork and saurkraut.  YUMMY!

Having German roots, it is nice to have an actual recipe for these dumplings.  My grandmother, mother (both deceased) made this often to drop into soup or fried up after boiling.   I just whip them up as my mother did.  I just use an egg or two, milk, flour, salt, black pepper, keep adding flour until I have a "stick together consistency" but not really thick, should kind of still run off your teaspoon, sort of a learned experience.  Then just drop by teaspoonfuls into your water or soup, never did put through a spaetzle maker.  Add to your soup at the end and cook covered,  5 minutes depending on the size.  I also do an old recipe with leftover mashed potatoes, about  2 cups mashed potatoes, 2 eggs, about 1/2 tsp salt, flour to make a stiff dough, boiling water, roll about a teaspoon mix in palm of hand, drop roll in boiling water, I guess boil about 5min. strain, have fried butter or marg, onions, bread cubes ready.  Mix together and serve.  Sour cream on side also good.

this was simple, fast, fun and exactly what I remembered. Using a zip lock with holes poked in it was simply brilliant. I made and boiled the spaetzle one day (then rinsed in cold water, drained and refrigerated over night) then fried in pan drippings the next after making our pork chops (I added some butter and parsley to the pan).  THANK YOU!

I love spaetzle... grew up eating it at an authentic German restaurant.  This recipe tastes fine, but the proportions make a very loose dough that never really firms up enough for a ricer, sieve or grater.  I think next time I'm going to use less milk, or more flour and perhaps freeze the dough for a few hours and then try grating or shaving.  At any rate, once you get these little dumplings into the pot, they come out fine, but this is a sticky mess to work with.

These were wonderful.  I followed the recipe exactly as written but I took the suggestion of another reviewer and let the dough sit about 10 minutes before using.  I then used his suggestion and used a big slotted spoon to press the dough into the boiling water.  . It worked perfectly. After cooking I plunged the spaetzle into ice water to firm them up and refrigerated them till I was ready to saute them. Everyone raved over them.  Only thing is I had to make 3 recipes to feed 7 people.  I was hoping for leftovers but only had about 1/2 cup left. We had these with German sauerbraten (by Cathy Eland) and red cabbage and apples  (by ChristyJ).  Restaurant quality meal from AllRecipes!

I've made this 3 times.  The first 2 were with the flour I had on hand...bread flour.  Please don't make the same mistake I made.  Bread flour makes it think and gloppy.  You can't get it through any small holed implement.  I just ended up tossing blobs into the water.  It tasted okay, but wasn't very visually appealing.  The 3rd time was the charm!  I used all purpose flour!  And I found a spoon with some holes in it and just used a regular spoon to push it through.  It came out FANTASTIC!  I fried it with some butter and prosciutto and it was yummy, yummy, yummy.  Next time, I think I will add some finely chopped onion, perhaps some garlic too.  This is a winning recipe.  Thanks so much!

Uber love!  Took the advise to freeze the spaetzle before browning in butter for our annual Oktoberfest party and it worked out perfectly.  Will be apart of our menu again next year!

Great recipe.  For those of you who find it hard to shape them into long noodles--just make "knepfle"--it's the same recipe, but knepfle are just small, any-shaped bits of noodle--I just pinch off a small bit of dough and toss it into the water.  the noodles are done as soon as they rise to the top, so you can just keep dumping and scooping.

Delicious! As good if not better than all the German restaurants I have been to. I did add some Parmesan cheese and sharp cheddar after I cooked them in butter! All I can say is Yummy!

Great recipe!! I married into a German family and even my in-laws think I am a miracle worker when I make these.  The nutmeg and white pepper go a long way for such a mild dish.  I tried using the traditional spaetzle maker, but didn't like how messy it was (batter would goop up on sides and overflow into pot).  Now my husband and I use a pastry bag and a pair of kitchen scissors.  I just squeeze the filling out of a medium oblong opening for the pastry bag over boiling water, and my husband cuts the batter every 1/2 inch- 1 inch.  It makes for a more traditional shape and I love how the slightly larger pieces have some chew!  A big hit!

Good, but this makes enough for 1 person!  Would def triple or quadruple this recipe.  Also, freezes well.  so make a big batch and freeze some for a 2nd meal.

Very nice- my first venture into spaetzle making- and not as intimidating as I thought it would be.  I cut a hole at the tip of a ziploc bag and doubled the recipe per other reviewers.  Laslty, I browned them in butter and parsley over medium high heat before serving-by giving them some color they looked more edible and the texture was improved greatly, in my opinion.

Don't know what happened but this was a runny mess.  Too much milk and not enough flour to press thru anything.

I love this spaetzle. After boiling to the right consistency, pan fry them with a touch of butter or oil to a delicate brown crust. Then toss with fresh herbs and top with fresh grated parmesan---unbelievable.

Easy, quick and yummy! I use this as a side dish sometimes instead of mashed potatoes with a roast. So, just drain and add the home-made gravy! My husband loves them!

These were really good. We omitted the nutmeg because of personal preference. We have a spaetzle maker that I have had in the closet for years but never used. I was happy at how easy this was. Make sure the dough is runny. It shouldnt be stiff like a pasta dough :)

This recipe is so much better than others I've tried.  Sometimes I saute it with a little ground sausage or chopped bacon and onions for a main dish, or cinnamon and sugar for a dessert.  There is a lot of room to get creative.

Wow!!  I just made this with a pork roast tonight for dinner!  It was awesome!!!  We are a family of six with big appetites, so I tripled the recipe.  It made enough for all of us and for my husband to take a serving to work for lunch.  I have a flat cheese grater.  I added a little extra flour, but the dough was still sticky.  I put the dough on the non sharp side of the cheese grater and pushed it through with a scraper like tool directly into the boiling water.  It floated pretty quickly.  I mixed it around a little and fished it out with a large slotted plastic utensil and placed in a strainer inside a bowl to catch the excess water.  I then repeated the process until all the dough was done.  Very easy!  Everyone loved it!!!!  I didn't add nutmeg, because I was in a hurry and couldn't find it.  Some of the family ate it with gravy, others ate with butter and parmesan cheese.  Awesome, tasted like a German restaurant we used to go to when we lived in Pittsburgh.  I will make again and again!!    Thank you!

I followed the recipe, and they turned out beautifully. I don't have a spaetzle maker, so I used a flat cheese  grater. I didn't wait 5 to 8 minutes, but just waited until they floated to the top, and scooped them out with a slotted spoon. I served with cabbage, meatballs, onions, and sour cream sauce.

I just throw pinched off lumps of the dough in the water instead of making a noodle shape, they're very thick and chewy and filling.  The best way to make about 25 cents worth of ingredients into a really good side dish!

This recipe is absolutely perfect, prepared just as written! It's delicious and authentic. I don't have a spaetzle maker so I pressed the dough the holes in the steamer that came with my cookware. It makes perfectly sized spaetzle.

To my surprize this was so easy to make. My husband has been asking me to make this for him . It was something his mother used to make for him. I also made Beef Burgundy and they were so good together. My husband brought the left overs to work for lunch and he said it was better the second day. I will be making this again.Oh ... also, my picky 7 yr old ate the noodles and loved them.

Oh so good. We are currently living in Heidelberg Germany, and I could have easily gotten these from any of the local restaurants. The tip about using the sandwich bag was great. I just stuck a fork through the bottom of the bag after I filled it, and it made for really authentic spaeztle. I'll definitely be making these again!

Amazing! Just like in Germany. Made it exactly and it came out great- next time I might use a bit more nutmeg because I didn't taste it much. Fried it in bacon fat and added fresh grated parmesan cheese- nothing low fat here! Also made a tradition German brown gravy to go with. Thanks for the easy recipe!

Buy the spaetzle maker if you don't have one. I used a $10.00 spaetzle maker from Amazon that I initially bought for my husband (he used it once) and it was AMAZINGLY easy (this was my first time). I started the water before I measured and mixed the ingredients, and the water was boiling by the time I was done. I ran half the mixture through the spaetzle maker and then scooped out the noodles with a bamboo skimmer/strainer (it has a REALLY LONG wooden handle) after 4 minutes, then did the other half. The whole process took less than 15 minutes with the spaetzle maker and the consistency of the batter was perfect. I sprinkled only a little nutmeg in the batter, but still did not like it. I simply will just omit next time. I will be making often.

I have made spaetzle from other recipes and had success.  I don't know what the problem was with this recipe, but it was very gooey dough, much runnier than other recipes I've used.  The spaetzles were pretty tasteless.

Definately how my aunt used to make em!  The nutmeg makes the difference (and probably my aunt's secret ingredient). We suggest doubling from the get go - 2 people nearly finished a double batch. I used a plastic bag and poked holes in it and squeezed it out - seems the easiest way. Fast and easy recipe. It was amazing with some pork gravy Johnsonville Brats and some sauerkraut!!!  Better than restaurants.

These dumplings were sooo good! I had never made my own dumplings before. Forget the collander, spatula, cookie press, rice maker and even the spaetzle maker. Since previous reviews stated the difficulty in using the collander or spatula, I didn't try and I didn't have any of those other items. I simply dropped small amounts of dough mixture into the simmering water. They are all unique looking that way. I used the boiled dumplings in the Quick & Easy Chicken Noodle Soup, also found on allrecipes. The dumplings complimented the soup perfectly! I didn't have white salt, so I used black instead. The pinch I used was generous. I doubled the recipe for the soup. To eat prepared in the way of this recipe would need to be tripled or quadrupled to feed a large family or big eaters. I also used dried parsley in the dough mixture, for a doubled recipe I used 2 tbsp. This was alot easier to make than I thought and since I didn't care if they were in strips and perfect, that took alot of stress off! Excellent!!

I have never made dumplings before, but these turned out AWESOME!  They were really tasty and not bland like some dumplings I have had in the past.  Like someone said earlier, I also doubled the recipe because I don't think this recipe would serve 6.  Thanks for the recipe, Holly!  I will definately be using it again!

This was a good recipe for spaetzle. Any other time I have eaten it, it was really hard. This recipe makes little soft dumpling type noodles. However, I would not attempt this without a (spaetzle maker). It was so fast and easy to make with one. And, the spaetzle came out perfectly shaped. Sur la table sells them for at most fifteen dollars. I wasn't going to saute them because I was cooking something else. But, I am glad I did because it really improved the flavor. Make sure to also boil them for the full 7-8 minutes as they do expand to full size and get softer to chew. I just used my largest sauce pan and filled it with water as usual and not a full gallon of water. The only change I made was subbing 2 tsp. of dried parsley for the fresh. Next time I would like to try the fresh though to see the difference. The only downside is I thought the white pepper and nutmeg was way too strong, but I also don't care for the taste of pepper. I will definitely make again but see what will happen if I omit the spices and just saute them in butter, parsley, or possibly another seasoning. Thanks

WARNING!!! I have made spaetzle with my mother's recipe before, I wish I would have had it on hand before I made my chicken paprikash with this recipe. This needs MUCH more flour!!!! The dough is supposed to be thick, this turned out completely runny!!!!

Unbelievable! This was well worth the effort of making! I am so glad I found such a good recipe when I finally got up the nerve to try and make this stuff. We will certainly be making this again, but I will have to double it so there is enough for the kids this time! The pressing through was a little difficult, but I found that by setting the pot of water (already hot and on a pad) on the floor and nesting the colander at the top, I could press the dough through with a spatula without breaking my back or wearing out my arms. When it all was pressed through I put the pot back on the burner and it came to boiling again right away.

We love this recipe! I wouldn't change a thing.  It can be hard to make if you do not have a spaetzle maker, but I am ordering one so the job is easier next time! You need something with really large holes. Typical colander and cheese graters do not work well. -this recipe goes great with the jagerschnitzel recipe from this site published by DSPIRAL73.

I served these spaetzle dumplings along side Jegerschnitzel from this site and my family of 9 LOVED it!  We tripled the spaetzle and had more than enough to go around.  The nutmeg was a surprising ingredient but added a special zing to the dumplings, so I am glad we didn't leave that out. A nice change for a side dish and married beautifully with the jagerschnitzel.

This is very similar to my grandma's recipe although she didn't use the nutmeg.  One thing she always did was to fry some crushed crackers in butter and top the dumplings with them.  This was my favorite dish of her's to eat and wish she was still around to make it.  Thank you for the recipe!

Good. Saute with butter and onions, bacon bits and parsley. Served with a Cranberry Pork Roast (see receipe), Homemade Applesauce, Sauerkraut and Mashed Potatoes. It was a yummy German meal. Mixed reviews on the dumplings, some said okay, while others said excellent. So I rated the dumplings in between.

I tried to make this with a ricer - was a mess-  it stuck together and to the ricer.  Then used a cheese grader - worked like a charm.    I suggest you spray cooking oil on the grader first (not a big deal if you don't)  push the batter through "backwards" (with the grater side facing the water).  Keep the grater close enough to the boiling water that the steam keeps the batter from sticking. don't put on too much batter at a time or it will flow off the side of the grater.

Turned out perfect German spaetzle!  I used a slotted spoon to press the dough through.  It had very large round holes so it was perfect.  I made this just to see how it would work out.  Now I'm excited to make it for meals.  I'm looking for a good brown gravy to go on it.

Wow!  This was absolutely delicious!  I multiplied everything by 1 1/2 to increase the amount.  This gave us 6 servings of 1/2 cup each.  My entire family loved this.  I served it with chicken paprikash from this site.  I grew up in Hungary, this is just like "nokedli."  Thank you so much for the recipe.

A+ again for Marbalet.  These are quick and easy once you get the hang of working with the colander or cheese grater, (I need to buy a spaetzle press!), and they are very favorful with a perfect texture.  The nutmeg is essential, IMHO, and I did drop them into boiling chicken broth for an extra flavor punch. They were excellent with a beer-braised beef roast.

I LOVE German food.  I'm very homesick and it reminds me of my Grandma's cooking.  I'm not used to the nutmeg in this type of food though.  It was good but next time I will probably leave out the nutmeg.  This was quite easy to make even though it was my first time.  At first I was thrown off by the "runny-ness" of the dough, but it worked fine.  I used a flat, metal cheese grater to make the noodles.  I just put a blob of the dough on the grater while held over the hot water and rubbed the back of a spoon in a circular motion to push the dough through the holes.  I will definitely be making this again.  It was quite quick for a "from scratch" recipe.

YUM! There was no way this was going to work with a sieve and I don't have a spaetzle maker so I made do with a ziploc with holes poked in it. I also added some chicken bouillon to the water for a little extra flavor. Delicious, can't wait to try it with emmantaler

These were so good.  I would recommend a sprinkle of nutmeg instead of the full 1/2 tsp.  It was just too much.  Other than that, it was wonderful!

My husband is a picky German food eater, and he loves this.  I use a plastic baggy with holes poked in the bottom (with a meat thermometer) since I dn't have a spaetzle maker.  Sauteeing is key to get the right consistency.

This was my first stab at this recipe...I say first because I do plan on trying it again.  I doubled the recipe (cooking for 4) and my dough was super sticky and I wasn't able to use my spaetzle maker--it just wouldn't go through the holes--it was too sticky.  I added more flour and tried again...still too sticky.  I finally got frustrated and just cut them up into pieces (which were way too big) and boiled them.  I then sauteed in bacon grease and added the bacon pieces.  The flavor of the spaetzle was delicious, however, it was WAY too heavy since I made the pieces so big.  Next time I will use some of the reviewers methods and hope these come out a bit better!

So good and so easy.  I remember an old German neighbor spreading the dough on a wooden board and scraping off the noodles with a long knife into a pot of boiling water with lightning speed.  Then eating them with roast pork and gravy - thinking I must have died and gone to heaven.  I use a potato ricer, and they are very good - but lack the texture that the handmane ones had.  Maybe someday I'll muster the patience to try it that way.  One more thing..Make sure you salt the water-like for cooking pasta.  Makes a big difference

My family LOVES this recipe! Made it last night with Beef Rouladen and Broccoli... Very good indeed. I don't have a spaetzle maker so I used the advise of another viewer and used the large part of a cheese grater. Worked like a charm.

Pretty yummy. Be careful not to make the dumplings too big/thick or they will be too chewy and heavy. That was my only mistake with this recipe.

Perhaps I used too much milk, when I halved the recipe.  They were OK.  Do not add canned green beans; it ruined the mild flavor of the noodles.  Holes punched in a plastic bag was an excellent idea.

This is very yummy! However the recipe only feeds 6 if you are a family of mice or super models.  I doubled it and feed 4 but could have used more. I paired mine with Chicken Paprikash.    Oh and the metal strainer eek... not a great idea. Steam burns Youch. My husband suggested his grandma always just dripped the dough off a spoon into the water and that worked great.

I am German too. Loved spaetzel, my grandmother used tomake wonderful boiled bread yeast risen dumplings but are very labor intensive. Recently started cooking again due to the economy, (just for me hard to cook for one). My  main course was Schnitzel - breaded pork tenderloins with lemon steamed brussells sprouts.  Batter was perfect according to site recipe. I let it rest for about 10 min while I was cooking the schnitzel. It reminded me of "Jiffy" cornbread mix" thickness. Then used the back of a slotted with holes spatula to press it through. First tried a mandolin cheese grater which was a mess, back of spatula was easy dropped about 3 tblspns onto the spatula and used a rubber spatula to 'scrape' it across.. perfect size dumplings cooked quick had a few lumps accidently fall it, just cut them in half in the pan while cooking they came out wonderfully too! I missed the part about sauteing, but i dressed with butter and parsley and more pepper and it was the best hommeade side i've made vs. potatoes ever. Someone else said best .25 worth of ingredients to make a easy side dish! I can't wait to use chicken broth and saute in bacon there are a million different combinations . I thought I might also use caraway seed next time to really make it authentic bavarian style.  I agree, does make about 3 servings, I had one, then had seconds (yikes) and packed the final serving for lunch tomorrow.  WOW My new every so easy side dish. No more Noodle Roni!

Mixed in the food processor and scooped into a quart freezer bag, then cut three pencil-sized holes in the bottom seam of the bag and squeezed out in 3-4 inch segments.  Scooped into a pan with olive oil and butter with sauteed shallot to fry a bit.  My six year old had three helpings, my ten year old wouldn't touch it.  I found it tasty and the hubby didn't care much for it.  I guess it's a matter of taste - either you like spaetzle or you don't :-)

Needed to do a little research before proceeding with this recipe as my dough was really sticky. Wasn't sure if it was supposed to be that way or not. What I had read said that if you were going to put it thru a sieve, it should be that way, however, if you were going to cut or pinch, it should be drier. I chose make it drier by of course adding more flour and I cut and scraped half of the dough the way my mom and Oma did and I pinched the other half. Pinching was easier and I loved the more rustic result. I doubled the recipe and my five sweeties inhaled them! Thanks so much Holly!!

Didnt have a spaetzle maker, so i used a ziploc baggie. I cut a tiny hole on the corner and squeezed out the dough into the water, little bursts.  Watch out if the bag opens/or if you poke hole in bag with fingernail. I threw 2 chicken bouilion cubes in the water. Still a little bland however.

The ratios are off. If you follow it as it is it is like batter instead of a pasta type dough. I had to add another cup of flour and it was still too sticky. I ended up cutting it into small pieces with a pizza cutter. Didn't taste right though, too heavy or something. I will try a different recipe next time.

Great tasting! I used a plastic bag to pipe this into hot water. Tossed with some homemade garlic butter and sprinkled on some fresh grated cheese and it was a hit.

A very tasteful dumpling. Quick and clean to make.
I see people have added their own methods of dispensing the dough into the boiling liquid so I will
pass along another. The way I was trained to do it was with a piping bag with a small round tube. It comes out like a snake so you can then cut it to uniform sizes.

This was WAY easier than I expected. I don't have a grater/spaetzle board so I cut the corner out of a ziploc bag and cut off pieces with scissors as I squeezed it through. I also sauteed them a little longer so they browned on all sides and drizzled with a reduced beer sauce. they were quick to make and delicious!

I never thought I could make Spaetzle from scratch and I'm so happy I found this recipe.  I made a double batch and for a quarter of the flour used whole wheat.  I don't have a spaetzle maker but improvised by using a vegetable grill pan that had medium sizes round holes.  Just placed it over a large pasta pot and mashed it through with a wooden spoon.  It couldn't be easier.  I made it with Jaegerschnitzle in which I substituted chicken for pork.  Thanks for such a great recipe!

Delicious and one of the easiest recipes I've ever made. I took the advice of one of the other reviewer since I don't have a spaetzle maker, I used a flat cheese grater, running the dough through the larger holes. The nutmeg was an interesting taste contribution and judging by what we had leftover (enough for tomorrow's lunch) it was a huge success and something I'm certain to make again. Great recipe Marbalet.

I have made spaetzle for years and this recipe is very close to what I have been doing except I agree with those who feel 1/2 tsp nutmeg is too much.  Just  a small pinch will do.  I have always hated cleaning the spaetzle maker or using a strainer so I do what my Mom did - scoop the dough onto a small cutting board (I prefer plastic) and with a knife cut off thin "slices" into the boiling water or broth.   Be sure to spray the board and knife with non stick spray for an easier cleanup. 
The dumplings will be a little bigger, but just as tasty.

The basic recipe for the dough is pretty spot on. Make sure you SIMMER the spaetzle, don't boil it. This way the texture is al dente, and not over cooked with an undercooked center. Also, why just water? I did it in a chicken stock, substituting the nutmeg fpr one clove bud broken off into it. (nutmeg is a bit pungent, and floods the palate)  SERVING SUGGESTION: Kaes spaetzle. Before you make the batter set white onions to caramelize in butter over a medium heat(throw in a thyme sprig to infuse) keep an eye on the onions and assemble the spaetzle batter. Onions should be done about the time the spaetzle is coming off. Strain spaetzle and sauté in butter with a sprig of thyme till it absorbs some of the thyme butter. Top with grGed emmentaler Swiss, or just Swiss, followed by the caramelized onion and black pepper. (I did however need almost a half cup of milk for the correct consistency to the batter.be wary of flour descrepencies!)

My grandmother would be so proud of my spaetzle, but I couldn't get it to shove through a colander or a grater.  I will certainly buy a ricer and try this again because we loved this recipe.

We made this for a stab at an "authentic German dinner" with my boyfriend and his family, who had lived in Germany for several years when they were younger. I admit that I was skeptical, but I followed the advice of others and used a plastic bag with a few holes poked in it, and also cooled them considerably before sauteeing in butter. They were a huge hit! Very similar to "drop dumplings" my German-American mom made, and she just "sliced" the pieces of dough into boiling liquid (broth or soup) from the edge of the bowl. I may do that next time with these. TIP: However you make the "rivels", you CAN make these ahead of time and just throw into the butter for a few minutes before serving. And they are terrific with the Jaegerschnitzel from this same website! Thanks for the recipe Marbalet!

After reading previous reviews I doubled the recipe.  This was my first attempt with spaetzle and I am patting myself on the back.  Turned out great.  Very light, not too chewy.  I used the ziploc bag technique and was lamenting not having a spaetzle maker.  I made a huge mess in the kitchen but the results were really good.  I confess, by the time they were sauteeing in the butter I was not in the mood to chop fresh parsley so I sprinkled with dried parsley.  Next time I'll chop the parsley ahead of time. We served this with the jagerschnitzel from this website.

The taste was good, my children and I liked it but my husband wasn't crazy about the texture. And he likes just about everything so I probably won't make this one again. The nutmeg was good in it but was a little too much. Half the amount would be enough to flavor it.

Good recipe but I found it difficult to find the right tool for pushing the dough through. I ended up using a potato masher since I like thicker dumplings.

Recipe is great "as is" although I doubled the recipe to serve 5 adults.  I used the tip by another reviewer of putting dough in a large baggie with 6 holes across the bottom using a skewer and squeezing the dough out circling the boiling water, stopping to stir occasionally. I then sauteed in a combination of a bit of bacon grease and butter and fresh parsley.  Hubby, who is German, said it tasted just like his grandma's. We had the spaetzle with kielbasa, bratwurst, knockwurst sauteed in beer, onions and a little bit of butter. Not the healthiest of meals but very good!

I am full blooded german and grew up eating spaetzle, I added about 1/8 cup more flour and I like to fry my Spaetzle in 5 slices of rendered bacon until slightly crisp and a little brown, yummy!  My husband can't get enough of it.

I would like to preface this review by saying that I am not an inexperienced cook. That being said, I do not understand how I can have the only negative review! I was not able to make anything edible out of this recipe. It ended up looking like scrambled eggs. I tried twice, varying the method of stirring, the impliment used to make the noodles, how hot the water was, and amount of cooking time and I still couldn't get this to turn out! I think (especially after looking at other recipes) that the batter is far too thin. There was no "forcing" it through the sieve--it was so liquid it just dripped out and made tiny little mushy dots. I got so frustrated!

Great, easy recipe! No way this is 6 servings, though -- maybe 3 servings for a side dish. The first time I tried making spaetzle, I used a colander and it was a horrible mess. I bought a Norpro spaetzle maker for about $7 from amazon.com before trying this recipe -- worked like a dream! If you love spaetzle, it's worth the small investment. I sauteed my spaetzle with a little butter and a minced slice of bacon -- it was fabulous.

This is great. I used a spaetzle press and it worked great. I cook low carb so I make these with pure vital wheat gluten flour and put these in my chicken soup, wedding soup, beef stew, beef and noodles etc. When I just drop then in boiling water I put them on an oiled plate and use a knife, dip the knife in the water ever so often, then I put them in a skillet with butter and fried onions and some cheese and you think you are eating pierogies that taste like potatoes. I have put fried them in butter, brown sugar twin and cinnamon with one apple cut up into cubes and that is a great dessert. There are just so many different things you can do with the dough. When I think of more I will post.

yum, we made these delicious little dumplings as a treat to go with the jagerschnitzel from this website. with no spaetzle maker in sight, my solution was to press the soft dough through the holes in the top pot of of my revere ware steamer. the process was much easier than i expected, my boyfriend held the steamer pot several inches above the boiling water while i poured in the dough & quickly presses it through the holes with a spatula. twice i scraped the bottom of the pan to keep things moving. after cooking them, i rinsed the spaetzle with cold water & let them drain. we didn't have fresh parsley on hand either so i sprinkled a little dried parsley into the melted butter before sauteeing the spaetzle. vielen dank, holly!

I really enjoyed this recipe. I didn't have nutmeg, so I substituted some ground allspice and that worked out well. I also added about a handful of shredded Italian cheese (not so much "German" but the bf's a cheese addict). I don't usually buy fresh parsley so I used dried. Rather than sauteing the cooked spaetzle, I mixed in a stick of butter to the bowl as I usually do. Oh, and I quadrupled the recipe because the bf and I love to eat this stuff for leftovers throughout the week.  Just a tip- do not cook for the recommended 5 to 8 minutes. Seriously, you don't need that much time. As soon as the spaetzle begins to float, it's done. I'll usually let it float for about 30 seconds or so before removing it, though. Also, it helps to do this in batches and scooping out each batch with a slotted spoon before starting the next. Trust me, it's easier and you won't risk over cooking the spaetzle. I served this with my own recipe for chicken gravy served over the top. It's delicious. :) I like this recipe, although I have another version that's equally as good so I'm not sure which one I'll stick with.

Delicious!  Here are some tips that might help first-timers:   
1. Don't skip the nutmeg. I was skeptical, but it really works in this recipe.   
2. I added two exta tablespoons of flour to thicken the batter/dough.   
3. Bat the eggs and milk together and add it all at once.   
4. Sray a colander and a rubber spatula with Pam and use that to extrude the dumplings.   
5. Boil the dumplings in chicken broth instead of water. I doubled the recipe and used a 32-ounce can of broth. The dumplings absorbed all the broth.   
6. Melt a stick of butter in a skillet. Dump the spaetzle in and "stir fry" it for a minute or so.   
7. I added parmesan cheese to the spaetzle after I buttered it. Delicious!

The flavor was awesome! Unfortunately my dough was too stiff, i had canned milk that i needed to use up, so  I added some extra regular milk to loosen it up and it was a little too thin, alas.  I will make again and just stick with regular milk. Yum.

My grandmother had different way to deal with the dough, and it is the one I have had the most success with. I'm in my mid 60's and grew up with these noodles.  Wet a standard size metal tablespoon with water from the pot, scoop up some dough on the spoon and with  another wet teaspoon slice  small pieces of dough off  into the water. The pieces are just flicked off the larger spoon, size will depend on how much dough you slice off the larger spoon.  They are a bit time consuming but also, I think time is saved not fussing with colanders and ricers. These are  dumpling type noodles and are great in chicken soup

DOUBLE THIS RECIPE, even my super picky husband and 5-year old cleaned their plates!  YUMMMY!  The only thing I changed was using chicken broth instead of water, because it was leftover from a chicken I boiled.

This is a great recipe for spaetzle.  The first time I made this I didn't like the nutmeg taste, so this time I substituted onion powder and it had a good flavor.

Absolutely delicious and authentic.  I lived in Germany for a year and spaetzle is one of my favorite dishes.  This recipe tastes just like I remember.  The only change I made is boiling the noodles in chicken stock.  It adds flavor. Otherwise I followed it exactly and it turned out great.  My husband even ate them witout gravy this time!

My dough was extremely glutinous and very difficult to push through any openings.. I went through 2 strainers and a slotted spoon before finally managing somewhat using a cheese grater.. My potato ricer was, of course, AWOL.. The flavor of the spaetzle was good, especially because it was drowned in butter, but it was very chewy, not light and fluffy at all... certainly not like what I had eaten at a restaurant a few days before.. I'm sure my result is pilot error, but I was expecting a better result the first time.. I am a fairly adept cook and don't usually have too much trouble trying something new... I will definitely try this again..AFTER I have a spaetzle maker or find my ricer.

I made this today, yet I had one issue. The measurement of 1/4 cup of milk didn't seem to be enough to make it smooth, so I added a bit more. The flavor was great despite my hesitancy of using nutmeg..I will certainly make it again and a larger batch.

I thought this was really good.  Came out just like I thought it would and much better than buying the box stuff!  I did follow other reviews and let it sit for a little bit before pressing.  I also pressed it through a plastic baggie with 3-4 holes in it.  Worked like a charm! Just like other people said, when they float, they're done. :)  Ran them under cold water after they cooked to keep them firm.  Also fried them with butter and cheese as mentioned by others.  Yummy!

Loved it!  Will definitely invest in a spaetzle maker tho.  The colindar was a mess but yummo!  So good...family loved it with the Bohemian Pork Roast on this site.  Makes a terrific gravy!  This is a keeper!

My half german boyfriend loved this. It was messy but worth it =) would definitely recommend a spaetzle maker if you're going to make these often.

I followed the recipe exactly but the dough was very wet and stuck to both the ricer and the cheese grater. I had trouble cutting off individual spaetzle without having them stick together in one big blob.

I thoroughly enjoyed the recipe.  I have been looking for a spaetzle recipe that I could make instead of buying the expensive stuff in the grocery store.  I did use a cheap spaetzle maker that I bought from amazon and it did the job.  I like the simplicity and it works well with gravy.

I added a little club soda to make them fluffier and used the back side of a grater to make the noodles. Tossed them with a little sauteed onion, crisped bacon garlic and butter This first time we have tried them and he said.. Yep do them again.

This was a lot easier than I thought it would be.  I used the steamer basket that came with my rice maker instead of a spaetzle maker.  The holes are a perfect size.  I spooned the very moist dough (more like batter) into the basket as I held it over a large pot of boiling water.  It made the whole process quick and painless.   After boiling for 8 minutes, I ran cold water over them in the strainer.  I sauteed them until they were slightly browned in places and most of the excess liquid was cooked out.  Served this on the side with German Rouladen (from this site).

Ok- I hated this recipe as I was making it because it didn't go smoothly.  I tried to push it through the colander and it was a nightmare.  So, I went to the spoons- I dropped it into the water, but actually dipped the spoon into the water so the dough 'melted' off.  The benefit to this was that the spoon heated up a little so that dipping back into the dough for a new spoonful was MUCH easier.  They turned out to be delicious.  I'm giving it a 4 because of the preparation.  FYI- I made the dough in the food processor (worked great!) and tripled the recipe to feed 6 with a little bit leftover.

We made this with German Rouladen and Red Cabbage, also on this site, for dinner guests and they loved the menu. I dropped these in teaspoonfuls in boiling water as suggested by the reviews and pulled them out when they become "light". I wish that I had served them a little hotter than I did, but they still were the perfect accompaniment to our German cuisine as requested by my German hubby like his Tante used to make.

I grew up in Germany and I can tell you: take it from someone who was practically weaned on Spätzle: This is not the way the Swabians make them!  Use a potato ricer for pushing the dough through, if you can't find the machine, and don't want to scrape the dough from the wooden cutting board directly into the boiling water.

I grew up in Germany and this doesn't look like the recipe I always use. Flour, a couple of eggs, a pinch of salt, and water is all that's neccessary for this recipe. It's a lot easier and tastes just as good. Once you boiled that you can put it in a deep pan and add grated cheese (Cheese Spaetzle) and top it off with fried onions. My husband and In-Laws love it.

Great dumplings.  Served them with jagerschnitzel from this site. Yummy!  Very easy to make.  I used a rubber spatula to push the dough through a  hand-held cheese grater.  Worked like a charm.

So Very GOOD! Fantastic flavor, my only problem was not having a spaetzle-maker, so I used a ziploc like other reviews suggested and it popped on me, so I wound up using a cheese grater. I definitely won't try this again until I buy the proper equipment, otherwise it's just too much work! BUT IT WAS AMAZING!!

We have made this recipe (with the bacon)on 4 occasions and everyone has loved it. Our only problem has been trying to use our spaetzle maker.  For sure a keeper and we will continue to make this.

This was a great recipe!  My family has a tradition of preparing an ethnic dinner for Christmas Eve and this year we selected German, so I tested this out a little early and will be serving it for our entire family this week.  It is a little hard to press the dough through if you don't have a spaetzle maker.  And I will probably triple the recipe for 8, as this alone was gone from just 3 of us.  My 2-year-old really liked it with parmesan cheese too.

Note: if you don't have a spaetzle maker, these are quite a challenge. The dough is not easy to work with if you are trying to push it through a sieve or grater. We enjoyed them, but they were not worth the extra effort....if I happen to get a spaetzle maker one day, I'll make them again.

Great tasting recipe.  I have a bowl full of cold water and ice on stand by when making these.  Once they come up to the top, they are ready to be taken out and shocked in the cold water to keep the firmness.  Ate mine with some sauteed onions and mushrooms.

Thank you StickySue for your wonderful advice today on the Buzz.   Because I didn’t have a spaetzle maker, StickySue recommended I take a plastic bag and punch 6 to 8 holes in it with a clean knitting needle or pen; spray the inside of the bag very lightly; put the dough into the bag and squeeze into the boiling water slowly.  They came out perfect!  We thought they made an excellent side dish.

My BF and I have been looking for the perfect Spaetzle recipe and I don't think this is it. We found it too heavy and too much nutmeg. I like the 'Spaetzle I' recipe on this site much more (using milk instead of water and adding just a little nutmeg).

Good recipe, made it three times now.  I replaced the milk with water to loosen it up. Also I now feel the spaetzle maker is a MUST. got tired of burning my hands using a colendar.

I love this recipe as it is different from my family's Schwabisch recipe. Quick idea: with left over spatzle, We add a little oil to the skillet, brown the spatzle just a little, add an egg or two scramble into the mix add any kind of deli meat, leftover meat or bacon top off with grated swiss cheese...my kids LOVE this!

This recipe makes wonderful authentic German spaetzle. I generally double or triple the recipe to make enough for freezing. I use a potato mincer to make the dumpling, and freeze them in meal-sized portions before sautéing them. I sauté them when I thaw them for use. I also add a couple of minced garlic cloves to the recipe because we like the garlic flavor. 

These dumplings freeze well, and I find it easier to make them in large batches and freeze them to have them handy when I need them. I also have found that it is good to stir them as soon as you have a batch in the water. Otherwise, they fall to the bottom of the pot and stick together. A quick stir breaks them up and they don't stick together.

Goes great with schnitzel and mushroom gravy! I use half the nutmeg, as it easily gets overpowering. I place the dough in a zip-loc bag, snip a small hole in one corner and squeeze it from there into the boiling water. Drain very well and brown it in a little butter in a good-quality non-stick pan over medium high heat

The consistency of the batter is perfect to use in my spaetzel press. Quick and easy side dish to many german recipes.

I love this recipe! I've made it too many times to count usually with some sort of sausage but also with various other meals as a basic side. To fry them up I use only about a tablespoon of butter along with some shredded cheddar cheese and bread crumbs. I eventually obtained a spaetzle press but before then used a series of spoons with holes and several pots of water to compensate for the time it took to press it through.

WOW!  I didn't have potatoes, was too lazy to make wide egg noodles, hubby doesn't care a lot about rice, what's a cook to do?  Make spaetzle!  This recipe is perfect!!
Here are my tips:
Before you begin, put a big ole pot of water on the stove to boil.  Get a collander out and set it inside a pie pan or other shallow dish. Set this next to the stove.  If you are a messy cook like I am, consider covering the work area around the stove and/or knobs loosely with tinfoil.  This will make cleanup easy.
For the easiest way to mix up the spaetzle dough, just put all the ingredients in a food processor and process until smooth, like a gooey glue.
I used a ricer to make my spaetzle.  I fitted the ricer with the medium hole disc and set it on a plate next to the stove. 
I turned out the dough from the food processor into a mixing bowl, then I could just scoop out the dough with a big spoon or a small measuring cup and fill the ricer.  Since the ricer was on a plate, the oozing goo didn't go all over my cooking area.
I picked up the ricer and held it over the boiling water and gently, slowly applied pressure and squeezed out the dough/batter.  I cooked the noodles for about 5 mins., then drained in the nearby collander. After that, I warmed bacon grease in an iron skillet, sauteed the spaetzle for a few minutes and then dressed them with salt and pepper.  I served mine with Hungarian Paprika Chicken.  OH, heaven!
This recipe is soo easy and really is the best.  Thank you!!

THESE ARE EXCELLENT. IF ANY LEFT OVER, CAN ALSO BE USED IN SOUP. MY GRANDCHILDREN LOVE THEM. YOU CAN ALWAYS ADD THEM TO A GOOD BOXED STOCK, LEFT OVER CHICKEN, MAKES GREAT SOUP ON THE GO.

I've lived in Germany for years and learned how to make Spaetzles from a good German friend.  These taste just like restaurant versions in Germany and my friend's home cooking.  Best recipe for Spaetzles I have ever come across....

Diese Nudeln sind PERFEKT!!!!!

I made them as stated, but instead of butter, I used bacon grease (I always keep some in the fridge!) and threw in a few thin slices of onion, then browned them all together for a tasty side dish. Thanks Marbalet!

I couldn't find my usual spaetzle recipe, so I tried this one. I found the dumplings a little lighter than my other recipe, but not as flavorful. (I may have put too little nutmeg; I just grated it directly into the bowl.) This recipe was very good, and I would not hesitate to make it again. If you like spaetzle, I highly recommend getting a good-quality stainless steel spaetzle maker (the kind that looks like a food mill with a crank on the top). It's a little bit of a hassle to clean, but not terrible, and it makes spaetzle-making sooo much easier.

So Yummy, I used the steamer tray from my rice cooker, it was a litte messy and difficult, but not terrible.  I did rinse with cold water as suggested , and then tossed in minced bacon, and green onions and sauted till browned.

I made these tonight for the first time and my husband and I loved it! I used a ricer so the spaetzle were smaller than when my mom-in-law made them. This side dish accompanied another allrecipes recipe - Filet Mignon with Mushrooms, Shallots & Wine - and were great!

A good basic recipes but I would have liked them to be just a touch lighter.  I halved the recipe so it might have put them off a little.  I used a potato ricer and it worked perfectly.

This is my 6 yr olds favorite dish.  The nutmeg really helps the flavor.  I use a grater to push the dough through into boiling water with chicken boullion.  This makes nice even small pieces.

I made these for my grandson.  He ate the whole batch all by himself and asked for more!  I followed the recipe excactly as written with only a shake of nutmeg.  I just used a knife to cut off pieces of dough and dropped them in boiling chicken broth.  They are fantastic.

Very good and pretty easy, too!  Used a spaetzle maker (you can pick one up at Williams/Sonoma or eBay). A family winner - will make again and double the recipe.  Sprinkled some parmesan cheese on top - yum!

These are perfection!!!  As a kid we had a Swiss exchange student and she taught my mom how to make these it was very involved since the recipe was in German and they had to translate it and weigh it all since it was in grams.  I was afraid to try these because that memory is very vivid.  These were so easy and delicious.  Too bad we didn't use the internet back then like we do now.  Thank you for helping me overcome my fear with a fabulous recipe.  I used my cheese grater to push the dough through.

Love this recipe!  I lost the recipe that my mother in law gave me and didn't what to ask her for it again.  It is my husbands favorite meal.  I add crumbled bacon to the dumplings.  I usually make a double batch but it still doesn't last long.

My new favorite side dish! Have never made spaetzle at home but this recipe is it. I didn't change a thing other than to use black pepper since I didn't have any white. Sauteed them in butter and threw the parsley in with them. Thanks to the cook who suggested using a zip top bag with holes poked into it as a tool to drop the dumplings into the boiling water. Worked perfectly! Will definitely make these again. Served with sauteed string beans and Lancaster Pork and Sauerkraut recipe from this site. Can't beat the combo! Delish!

Delicious! I used a potato ricer to drop these into water at a rolling boil.  Fluffy, soft, and the nutmeg gives a wonderful flavor.  If they stick together while boiling at all, just use a spatula to separate them when you saute.

These were pretty good.  I've only had spaetzle once before, so not a lot to compare it to for authenticity.  Extremely messy to make.  Followed the recipe, and used the perforated storage bag method of getting these into the boiling water.  That seemed to work ok, as these were about the same size and texture as what I had before.  Sauteed with butter, paprika, and more pepper since I was out of parsley.

Dinner group loved this dish.  I've made it twice this week.  The first time I doubled the recipe, and it was just enough for our family of 4.  It was too wet, so added more flour like other reviewer.  I also found that using a heavy quart ziplock with a few holes worked well as the extruder.  The second time I decreased the milk (about 1 T less per recipe), and since I had it, used salad burnet (an herb that tastes of cucumber!), in place of parsley.    The nutmeg makes these better than other spaetzle.  I'll definitely make it again!

These spaetzle were very easy to make and very tasty. I made them to go with beef stew because I was out of egg noodles, and they worked perfectly.

I used the grater as others suggested.  My dough seemed too liquid, so I had to a couple tablespoons of flour.  The result was funny little dumplings that everyone loved!  It was perfect with my sauerbraten and red cabbage.  Will make again and look into a spaetzle maker!!

I make spätzle a lot. One tip: get the dough through your sieve/spätzle maker quick and rinse it often in cold water. Baking the spätzle with fried onions and lots of cheese makes a wonderful side dish, too.

Excellent!  I would recommend doubling the ingredients...it goes fast! I only used a pinch of nutmeg.  I used a potato ricer/spaetzle press to make it and it was so easy that way!  Thanks Holly!

Okay, I really didn't make these.  The reviews made it sound like too much work without the spaetzle press.  I used packaged spaetzle, but there wasn't much flavor.  I would recommend boiling in chicken broth for more flavor.

An easy way to do instead of a grater or strainer is to use a disposable pastry bag or zip loc bag with a small tip cut off and squeeze them into the water.   I have a spaetzle maker but this is just so easy and no mess to clean up.

Delicious. I made as directed and was a bit skeptical about the nutmeg as that is not my favourite. It added just the right flavour and this will be my new go to. The only thing I would change is the serving size. One recipe would not serve 6 people in my house. It would serve 2 or 3. As the first pot was simmering I quickly mixed up another recipe so we would have enough. We love spaetzle.

Great recipe and the flavor is wonderful! I worked at a German restaurant for a while and my boss taught me everything I know about German cuisine. She was from Germany, only having been in the states for 5 years and we always made everything fresh and from scratch. This recipe is a sure winner and may have even more flavor than the spaetzle we made there! Will definitely be keeping this as my main spaetzle recipe from now on. To make this, I used a hand grater to push the dough through. I didn't have a proper spaetzle maker/press that we used at the restaurant, but a hand grater works just the same. Don't follow the recipe time frame, either. As soon as the dumplings float, they're ready for take-out. If your dough seems a little too thick, add a tbsp or two of water.  I do this every time I make them and it really helps lighten the texture. You want elastic dough for spaetzle! Also, I know to many people nutmeg sounds like a weird thing to add to dumplings/noodles, but it is KEY with these. It really adds so much flavor and you wouldn't find an authentic German dumpling/noodle recipe without it! Thanks so much for such an amazing recipe!

I made it!! Great recipe- I made an oops and had to add in another egg and more milk, that said my dough was runny.  I poured it in to a ziplock bag and let it sit for about 20 minutes.   My salted water was not boiling but simmering . I cut a corner off the bag and allowed the dough to run out at its own speed as I moved the bag over the pot. DO NOT overcrowd.  The dough sunk to the bottom. When it rose to the top I ladled them off into a melted butter fry pan and left alone until golden brown. HOLY SMOKES - THIS is the real  thing!  Thank you for sharing

Excellent recipe. These Spaetzle are light with a beautiful nutmeg fragrance. I served them with Pork Goulash. Delicious.

I had never made spaetzle before.  I was a little hesitant about adding that much nutmeg, so I halved it.  It was really good!

I did not care for it.  But I can see it is very easy to over cook this.  I had trouble dropping it into the water.  Lot of work and easy to screw up.

This is my go to Spaetzle recipe. The texture is great and it's as flavorful as you are ever going to get boiled batter. I pair it with Chicken Paprikash and it's amazing.

After watching the video I question the amount of milk used. Her dough is more like pancake mix; however, the recipe ingredients make a very firm dough which is hard to push through the spaetzle maker and produces very tough dumplings.

I used salted water to cook the Spaetzle as you do in Germany. I followed the recipe but had to add another splash of milk. I used a Spaetzle lid, put it on when you're ready to start making the dumplings or it will cook on the lid. Great flavor and not mushy at all, even after browning it. Next time I will double the recipe so we have some for lunch the next day. This is going into my recipe box.

I think that it was pretty good I mean I've eaten speatzle in leavenworth and eaten some imported speatzle and in my opinion this is almost there but I like it mainly because it takes mabe 15 minutes to make and it turns out pretty good every time (I've made several batches)

Delicious recipe, I added some black pepper and paprika with some sauteed onions and garlic and 1/2 cup cheddar melted and topped with some parsley and it came out great! I also used a potato ricer that had a larger metal plate which worked perfectly

Having never made spaetzle before I wasn't sure how the dough was supposed to be, except for the video. Mine looked nothing like the video. It got all stuck in the whisk so I added another 1/4 cup milk and it still didn't resemble what it did in the video. I used a ricer and tried to do what I've seen on tv, cut it off as I was squeezing it into the boiling water. It came out in big clumps. I thought for sure it would be a fail but I stirred it with a knife of all things and in the end it looked the way it should. It worked pretty well with the goulash I prepared. All that said, I think I'll stick with my roots and making pasta! Thanks for sharing MARBALET!

I made this for my boyfriend, whose mother makes this all the time, and he loved it! Being a couple that just moved into our own place and him having to be my guinea pig, it certainly made my night when he went for seconds. Thanks so much for this easy to follow recipe with ingredients I already had :)

Excellent recipe. I thinned it with a bit of seltzer water and it made the dough a bit too soft - so I'll use less next time. Very tasty.

I made this today, it was great and I'm thinking it's a good base recipe.  I think next time I'll add some green chili's and cumin and serve mixec with roasted garlic and Mexican cheese.  I also used a potato ricer and it seemed just fine.

If you don't have a spaetzle maker, do it the way my Grandma from Bohemia taught me: just hold the bowl over the boiling water and use a spoon to scrape off a bit of dough directly into the pot, dipping the spoon in the water between each scrape to prevent sticking. I still make spaeztle this way but use a big measuring cup with a handle now. These dumplings are essential in chicken paprikash. Never added the nutmeg, milk, etc. Just eggs and water. Kel

When making spaetzle, you can add almost anything to the batter to flavor the dumpling.  Add dry mustard, thyme, rosemary, nutmeg, or any other spice or herb you prefer to compliment whatever the dumpling is accompanying.

I'm sure this is good,i make a similar family recipe with less ingredients,however,the one yummy missing thing to try for extra flavor is try throwing in breadcrumbs,i use Italian style for more flavor when u are frying them in butter,it makes all the difference and is extremely delicious!!

I learned to make Spaetzle from a German lady many, many years ago. Instead of forcing the batter through a sieve, she picked up batter in a teaspoon and then with another teaspoon pushed small bits into a boiling potato soup. She called it Button Soup and her kids loved it - so did I. You just make a standard potato onion soup with ham chunks and before adding cream, you drop in the little buttons of batter and let them cook. Finish off by adding cream. Boy is it hearty and good on a cold winter night.

Worked out great but added a couple more teaspoons of flour. Maybe my eggs were bigger than the original recipe uses. Sauteed in butter with sauerkraut and caraway with a hint of salt - YUM!

I use 3 eggs to a cup of flour and milk in order to gave a higher protein content. I cook them, then dehydrate in my dehydrator, and can store indefinitely in a jar.  I use a Norpro spaetzle maker I got from Amazon, and it is the the perfect tool.  For $10, don't skimp on bad equipment.

Very nice and delicate - having with pot roast   :)  The timing is off, tho, you should remove them when they float to the top

I cannot give these enough stars.

The batter came together in 3 minutes. They boiled for barely that same amount of time, and after shocking and draining were ready to eat so quickly that I couldn't have gotten a plate of boxed, store-bought pasta on the table any faster.

So amazed by the taste and process was I that I instantly turned around and ran a second batch through my spaetzle press (which this recipe deflowered, as the press was straight out of the shipping carton and waiting for the perfect recipe).

Second batch I enhanced with the addition of 1/2 tsp. of onion powder. 

This is now committed to memory as everyone who tasted these and subsequent batches deemed this recipe a new staple side dish.

Thank you!

Delicious recipe! The only thing I changed was that I used less nutmeg.  I don't care for the nutmeg flavor in my food, so I only used half. My entire family devoured it. I doubled the recipe for 5 adults and it was just enough. I used a recipe that I have for chicken and dumplings, I just omitted the dumplings, and I served it over the spaetzle.

only 1 cup of flour compared to other spaetzle recipes calling for 4 cups.  I'm having a party for 12 people, and I  quadrupled this recipe,  barely looks like enough.  Serving sizes should be specified in my opinion.   Otherwise, I like how the recipe came out.

This was a delicious side with the beef dish I made.  In trying to cut down on fat I didn't use butter but gently sprayed the pan with an olive oil spray.  When I was ready to serve I topped it with the no fat beef/sour cream gravy that went with the beef dish.  By the way, I used my flat cheese grater and it worked just fine.  Oh my it was yummy.  Thanks for posting this recipe.  This is now in my recipe box.

I had a hard time getting these to the right texture for my spatzle maker, but I think that was just my inexperience.  I added additional flour and they came out OK.  I thought there was a little too much nutmeg, and I will put in slightly less next time.  I served it with Hungarian goulash.  Delicious!

This recipe is delicious! I was trying to make an authentic German meal, so I made this as a side dish. Everyone loved it! I wasn't sure about the nutmeg (my regular recipe for noodles and dumplings does not use nutmeg), but I went for it and was glad I did. Delicious! Also, I don't have a spaetzle maker, so I just dropped them by very, very tiny spoonfuls. It took forever. I suggest using a spaetzle maker if you have one.

This is surprisingly easy and was very satisfying. I was very pleased with the end result (I had never made spaetzle before) and served it with beef gravy, because I had no fresh parsley. Like others, I have no spaetzle maker, so I squeezed the dough through an old bread bag with holes in the bottom. I would note though that this recipe doesn't make enough to serve 6 people. I am only cooking for two and we had barely any leftovers.

Great recipe...the ziplock bag with 4-5 holes worked the best and easiest with the least amount of clean-up. I doubled the recipe for a German-themed potluck, but thought the nutmeg was a little too strong. I will half or 3/4 it next time.

Excellent recipe. It cooks up well and has a great taste. I pushed it through a colander which worked fine (though you can't have to small of holes otherwise it's way too much work) and I also used a pastry bag where I cut the tip small and piped it into the water that way and just  broke it up when I drained it out. That's worked out fine too. So basically, this recipe seems pretty versatile as far technique and flavoring/additions. Will definitely use again!! Thanks!

One look at the ingredients tells you that something is wrong here. I replaced the milk with a little water and added much more flour in order to achieve the right consistency. I give it 2 stars because the nutmeg is a good idea.

Wow-I had a near cooking disaster with these! Did anyone else's dough turn out runny? I ended up making a second batch & it was runny too-I could not "push" it thru anything as it was just a gloppy & sticky mess. I ended up adding more flour-1 whole cup to the 2 batches of dough & made drop dumplings as small as my patience would allow. They ended up turning out pretty good-my husband loved them. I'm not sure I cared for the nutmeg so much(maybe I would cut that in half next time). I'm convinced that I obviously did something wrong in the mixing process so I'll definately try this again in the future. If anyone has suggestions for me, please give me a shout out on the Recipe Exchange-I'm on almost every day & would love your advice!

The mixture was very liquid in texture and didn't really make strands of dough, so I had to work pretty hard to get dumplings in the end. However, they tasted great and were the perfect accompaniment to the jagerschitzel. I used garlic herb seasoning in addition to the fresh parsley for a little more flavor.

Excellent.  This recipe is exactly like my grandmother's except she didn't use nutmeg.  I use it when I make this, but honestly, if you didn't have any it wouldn't make the biggest difference in the world.  I also don't have any of the implements on hand to form the spaetzles so I cut small ones off the dough one at a time with a wet knife.  I love to use spaetzles with the Campbell's chicken and dumplings recipe on here.  It's wonderful!

i followed the recipe to a T, and i think i did pretty good!  i had no idea what the consistency of the dough was supposed to be like, but in retrospect, i did just fine.  my nutmeg is old (need to replace) but for the first time making and tasting, these turned out just fine.  a great first starter recipe.

For some reason my dough was extremely sticky. I purchased a spaetzle maker and the dough stuck to it. I had to tear little pieces off by hand. I cooked in chicken broth. Very yummy! I cannot wait to make again.

Tasted great - the nutmeg gave it extra oomph.  I changed the recipe a bit by shaking some parmesan cheese over the spaetzle while sauteing. I served it with  the Sauerbraten Klopse and German Red Cabbage recipes from this site for a great German meal.

really good, but i recommend using a spetzel press cause if you try it with the 'holes in a zip lock bag' method, you get one long tube that you have to break up.  but, even so, it was really good.  will totally make again :)

Delicious. Just like the texture I remember from Germany but with more flavor. I used basil in place of the parsley because that's what I have.

I used a colander and it was a phenomenal mess! Next time I'm going to do the plastic-bag-with-holes method another reviewer mentioned.

I use something similar to make rivels in my Chicken Corn Rivel Soup.  Not bad, went well with Currywurst though to soak up some extra sauce.

This recipe is great! We use it regularly and love it.
For those who are new to spaetzle: "dumplings" in this case doesn't mean teaspoonsful. A better description is: German pasta - but in little, tiny droplet shapes. Also, it is supposed to be a very moist, almost runny dough (some recipes are stiffer than others, this one is a thinner one).  Yum!

For me, this was just okay.  I first made the dough according to the recipe, and it was way too runny.  So I added more flour until it was a more workable consistency.  Even after adding a lot of flour, it still wouldn't press through a grater.  It was just really hard to work with.  We ended up adding a ton of flour so we could work it into little pieces that we manually dropped into the water.  There was too much pepper (could be my fault), and I couldn't even taste the nutmeg at all.  I added a bit of bacon grease with the butter to brown them.  They were tasty with sauerbraten and gingersnap gravy and got rave reviews, but I'm not sure how great they'd be alone as a side dish.  I'll use this recipe again, but will have to perfect the spice balance and will definitely have to invest in a spaetzle maker.

I've never made Spaetzle before and this turned out great.  I thought the dough was a little too dense so I added a little more milk.  I put it through the steamer that came with my cookware and it worked fine, although a little work intensive (will have to get a ricer).  I sauteed it with butter and onions as other reviewers suggested and also served it with brown gravy.  The gravy really brought out the nutmeg flavor.  My husband really loved it - I'll be sure to make this recipe again.  Fabulous!

These turned out pretty good. I don't own a spaetzle maker, so I used a tip from the reviews and used a zip-top bag with one corner cut off. They wound up being bigger than I'd expected and kind of ugly looking, but they were still very tasty. I served these with "Vienna Schnitzel" (from this site) and had a great, hearty Bavarian dinner.

I served these with Jagerschnitzel and it was soooo good.  Normally I find spaetzle to be rather bland, but this spaetzle had a lot of flavor - I couldn't stop eating them.

These were very good. I used the ziplock method, and worked pretty good. Seved w/ jaeger schnitzel and fried cabbage. Reminded me of my time in Germany. Even the hubby liked them ;)Thanks for the recipe, is definitely a keeper!

While it hard to screw up spaetzle, this recipe was too doughy and the nutmeg (while an intresting touch), made the finished product look like italian sausage crumbles.

Good recipe but I agree with the others- if you don't have a spaetzle maker don't bother because it's too clumpy.

I've made it as written which is great! This time I substituted some sour cream for some of the milk and some brown rice flour for some of the white flour ( just to get rid of it) the sour cream added a little zip to them! Try it! I had zero problems with it ever being to runny?? I use cutting board method rather than grater etc - so much easier and less mess!! Videos are online

Made this recipe and was a delight to enjoy with family.
I used a potato press with the larger hole size, bit messy but worked well.

Made this tonight. The batter was pretty thick. I tried to get the batter through my colander and it didn't work. So I got my flat grater out. I put the batter on that it is went through the grater in a big blob. So, I sort of cut it up in the boiling water so it wouldn't come out horrible.
The directions said saute in butter. But it didn't say for how long. I tried it after sautéing it  and it had no flavor. I was going to serve it without a sauce. So, I added some extra salt to give it some flavor. If I make this again I will make it as my mom did by putting the batter on a cutting board . Then making a thin line of batter on the board and using a knife  cut and push the batter into the water. 
My husband said to just be readymade stuff and not deal with it. Maybe he is right.

I added another handful of flour at the end, as I felt the dough was too loose.  Very forgiving, and I used fresh nutmeg - it made these amazing!

I was skeptical about this turning out since I had never made it before, amd the dough seemed a bit loose but it was great! I did double the recipe, as another reviewer suggested, amd added a bit of Garlic powder in addition to nutmeg.  I used this to make Kase Spaetzle from this site. super delicious and I will definitely be making this again!!

I made a double batch and ended up adding more flour to the second boiling. The first go-round was too runny. These take longer than I think, so start early.  I tried the large hole colander, but it was unwieldy. Try the ziplock bag method next time.

I have gone through a lot of batter trying to make this. Finally, I just stopped cooking them in water for the allotted time. only for about 1 min. And I made smaller batches. if you over fill the frying pan...it starts to steam and then turn to mush. boiling them for longer then 1 min, also resulted in mush. I have the spaetzle tool...so not sure what I'm doing wrong. but the finally product was awesome

I had no pasta left and thought I'd give this a try with ingredients I had available: whole wheat flour, water, eggs, and salt. (no nutmeg or milk.) I let them boil for a few minutes then transferred to iron skillet with melted butter. Sauteed until some pieces started turning a little golden. It was OK. Next time, I will salt the water and add another egg to the batter to see how that works up.  It is a really quick way to make homemade "pasta".

I couldn't find my Mother in law's original Polish Spaetzle recipe so I tried this, made it as written with a real spaetzle maker. It was very similar in taste and texture. I did not like the nutmeg. I made the 6 person serving which fed three with no leftovers. As others stated, next time I make the effort to make it I'll quadruple the recipe and freeze leftovers.

I enjoy carmelized onions mixed in and baked @ 250° for 30 min or so when I have time.

Absolutely delicious, but the dough is a little more firm than I expected, so I had a tough time pushing it through my colander with a spoon LOL. I think I'll try to find one of the spaetzle making tools as seen in the video for next time, it will be well worth.

Made this per the directions. Good basic recipe for spaetzle. Incidently, spaetzle in German means little birds or sparrows. I increased the recipe two-fold based on other reviewers comments. It was barely enough for three people. If the original recipes serves six, five of them must be sparrows!

Very easy to work with this dough. It flowed wonderfully through my Spaetzle press. I was afraid of the nutmeg because I thought the taste would be too strong. I only added about 1/8 of a tsp and next time I will be braver! I also added more like 1/2 tsp pepper and a Tbls of dried chives. Served with chicken schnitzel and made a gravy of onion mushroom and homemade chicken stock. Excellent! Thanks!

One of the best and easiest recipes I have used. I have made this for hundreds of people and always get rave reviews. Have even been told it was as good as their grandmother's, who still lives in the old country.

I made this with the exact ingredients listed and used a colander to press the dough through. It came out perfectly and delicious!! Thank you, I'll definitely be making this again and might even treat myself to a spaetzle maker in the future!! :D

I do not have spaetzle maker.  I put the batter into a metal or glass bowl.  I start to pour the batter into the water and use a knife to cut the dough as it drops.  It works.  I have read other recipes on the web and they do the same.  I looked at makers on different websites and decided I did not need another appliance in my kitchen.  This recipe is really good.

I made it very simple. Flour salt milk eggs water. We had it with pork steak. I doubled the recipe and had no left overs. Reminded me of my mom's Spazln back in Tirol. Next time I will saute them with some onions. Maybe my picky children will still like them.

Good and easy recipe. I made the batter  a wee bit too thin so they came out a little more  stringy than I like. But there will be a next time so lesson learned.  That’s the fun of cooking. It’s always an experiment!

Recipe is excellent. I didn't have a spaetzle maker so I used a frosting bag with a small tip and squeezed pieces directly into the pot of boiling water. Just like gnocchi, they will sink but then float to the top when done. I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because I found the nutmeg just a tiny touch too strong so would reduce it just a little. It. Also the parsley at the end clashed with the flavour of the nutmeg so I ended up scraping it off and won't use next time. Delicious and super easy!

I loved this!  It was surprisingly easy, and I was sooooo pleased with how great this turned out.  I poured it over a cheese grater with a cookie cookie, to move it back and forth (kind of like in the video).  Thanks for this recipe!!

Turned out great.  I made it just as the recipe said.  I browned the spaetzle a bit more than called for.  Will definitely make this again.

I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great.  They were just the right consistency.  I have a spätzle maker and t worked perfectly.  It is definitely something I would make again for beef burgundy or stroganoff instead of noodles or rice.

This recipe was perfect. I definitely recommend getting a spaetzle maker, as I used a colander and it was really messy. I make spaetzle about once a year and that’s only because it’s a messy project. I am buying a spaetzle maker now so that I can make it more. This recipe is perfect, very flavorful and a hit with the entire family.

This is my second time attempting to leave a review - the site decided to delete my first one when I hit the "made it" button, and wouldn't allow me to leave the dialog box without adding a rating, which was blank and overwrote my first submission - not a very smartly designed website.

I referenced Cooking MaMa's review prior to making and found, as she did, that the recipe as stated leaves you with a dough that isn't quite right - it was too sticky to properly work; thus, the rating. However I was able to remedy the problem on the fly by dusting the dough with a little extra flour a few times. I believe I ended up using about an extra quarter cup, give or take.

I decided to go more traditional and press the dough out to about 1/4" with my hand and then cut ~1//4" strips with a dough knife, which I then cut by eye resulting in pre-cooked pieces of about a cube shape to about a one inch strip. This method results in less uniform noodles with little pits and grooves that hold sauce well - one of the things I really like about this type of noodle. 

I tossed about 15-20 pieces at a time into well-salted rolling water and spidered them out once they floated to the top (about a minute or so), and into a colander to drain and cool. The resulting noodle was just al dente', which should be about perfect when I cook them later this evening in herbed (sage, thyme, tarragon) brown butter with porcini.

Excellent spaetzle. I suggest getting a spaetzle maker, life is much easier. Can be had for under 20$. Well worth it if you plan to do this more than once or prepare for a group. Once you love spaetzle try the “Kasaspaetzle” , it could become a family favorite.

It was much more simple to make than I thought it would be, and I'm only fourteen years old. However, this may be due to the fact that I omitted the pepper and nutmeg as my parents are not huge fans of them. They cooked in about 2-3 minutes, rather than five, with the heat all of the way up and the lid off. In my opinion, they are great raw, but we are planning to eat them with a cheesy sauce. I didn't have a good way to mold them, so I poured the batter onto a cutting board and sliced strips into the water with a butter knife. 10/10 recommend, especially if you're looking for an easy, unique meal.

This recipe was so good and easy. I bought the stainless steel spaetzle  maker on amazon for 13.00. It comes with a plastic scraper. I had to add a little more flour  as it was too runny. Omitted the nutmeg. Great in chicken soup or with just butter. First time making.

I really liked the spaetzle, but I had to double the milk to make it thin enough to go through the spaetzle maker.

I used this recipe to make spaetzle and it turned out great! I had to add alittle more milk to get it to the same consistency as the video.  I should of doubled the recipe my kids were begging for more. Will definitely be adding this to my dinner rotation.

The spaetzle were very good but the nutmeg was a little overwhelming. The next time I make this I plan to adjust the amount of nutmeg used.

Great recipe. I recommend using the cutting board and knife/pastry cutter method instead of a grater for getting the shapes.

This is the first time I made spaetzle. The flavor and texture was great. Four stars instead of 5 due to the mess I made. I fried it with garlic, bacon bits and mushrooms. Will be making again!

Very traditional and delicious.  Try making it several hours ahead of time and keep it refrigerated until ready to use.  It develops a nice flavor and mellows the nutmeg.  So very yummy.

I used King Arthur  Measure for Measurem but otherwise the ingredients were used as noted. However "pushing it through a sieve " was for the birds. I got out a frosting bag and made them like funnel cakes. No muss no fuss and they turned out beautifully.  I figured they are both German, so one method or the other made no difference.

I have made this recipe several times. It is easy just a bit time consuming but that is OK. The flavor is excellent and it tastes really good with the Sirloin Tips and Mushrooms recipe from this website. If you want to vary from the usual side of potatoes, this makes a perfect substitute for them. Serve it with stewed meat or pork. It will change your perspective and definitely will get you away from the usual potato based side. I have a spatzle maker and the recipe sometimes comes out a bit runny. Do not fret, just add flour in tablespoons and test until you notice it becomes firm enough to your taste. My suggestion is to add a few more tablespoons of flour and that will be it. If you want to store them, I recommend doing so after you have fried them to keep them from sticking to each other.

This recipe came out very well for me.  I experimented with various dough consistencies - the flour I used (King Arthur - APF) absorbed the liquid and I had to add a fair amount of milk in order to get a dough that was easy to work with and produced tasty results.  This looks like more of a look-and-feel recipe, and I found that as long as the dough presses through the cheese grater (large holes) and floats to the top when it's done, you're ok.

Excellent recipe!  I saw on another site where someone suggested poking a few holes in a Ziploc bag and squeezing the batter through.  I was worried that I would end up with most wasted stuck to the inside of the mixing bowl and the bag.  Since the dough is wet I didn't have that problem and I think much easier to handle than trying to hold a heavy colander and pushing the dough through with the other hand.  I will be making this again and doubling the recipe for leftovers!  This served 2 as a large side dish to our chicken.

This was an amazing recipe!  I used medium eggs so I had to add  more milk to get the right consistency.  However, these are the closest thing I've ever had to what I've had in my multiple trips to Germany.  Served these with a Sauerbraten recipe from my exchange family and we had the very best meal.  Thank you so very much for posting this recipe.

Either I'm an idiot, or this recipe leaves a lot to "be determined".  Using the milk amount leaves you a runny watery batter, and the cook time leaves you with a watery mush.  I tried 3X to no avail.  More detail on what to look for in the "consistency" of the dumpling while boiling would make a big difference as obviously there is a fine line to under cooked and over cooked mush.

The nutmeg added a bit of sweetness we didn't care for. I've made it dozens of times since without, and it's fantastic. You can also form the spaetzle with a cutting board and butter knife. There are YouTube videos that show technique.

Made  these but used black pepper . Decided to add them into the slow cooker along with my Cross rib roast, about 30 minutes before it was done. They cooked up nicely in the beef juices. i didn't bother browning them in a pan. Served with a quick mushroom gravy. The batter is a bit too runny , so added about 2-3TBSP extra of flour.

I made it as written then thought it was to runny so I added a little more flour just to find out it wouldn't go through my spaetzle maker. I had to add more milk but it still turned out wonderful. Very good.

Very easy to make; great consistency & browned up nicely. Flavor quite nice although spaetzel is bland by nature. I used chives instead of pastel & I will double the recipe next time since this would serve 6 only with scant 1/2 cup portions. Spaetzel is very suitable as leftovers.

Good to be served with a tomato, mushroom, cream sauce, and topped with crunchy bacon.

I love this recipe! Its the best I have ever made.  Who knew a little nutmeg can do so much.  I followed the recipe with one exception, I added some garlic powder.  Thanks for the recipe.

These spaetzle were fantastic!  I used a non stick pizza pan with large holes over a boiling pot of salted water.  Then I used a silicone scraper to "push" the dough through. It worked wonderfully. The only adjustment was to the cooking time. As soon as they floated to the top, I scooped them out with a slotted spoon. They only cooked for 2-3 minutes.  Double the recipe as they reheat well.

Okay, now that I've made these for the 4th or 5th time, they are now my families 'go to' for adding to soup or smothering with paprikash. Also delicious with pork and sauerkraut. One trick though, I seem to get a better spaetzle if the batter rests for 20 minutes or so before cooking.

I made these quite a few times now. I do not alter the recipe at all. I ordered chicken paprikash at an authentic German restaurant and theirs didn't even come close to how good these are. I will even make a batch of these, fry them and add them to chicken soup in place of noodles. They are perfect!

I cut the recipe back to 3 servings and made two small changes, I used 2 yolks and 2 tbs of the white, for a richer spaetzle, and I used freshly grated nutmeg. I used a spaetzle maker and removed them from the water as soon as they floated to the top, about 2 minutes. Thanks for sharing.

Used onion and garlic powder instead of nutmeg. Used 2% milk. Someone else suggested nearly doubling the flour, so I tried, but it made mine too thick to go through my large holed collander. So I added more milk until it was loose enough to push through. They turned out just fine! Next time I'll stick with the suggested amount of flour and see how it turns out.. might have to add a tiny bit more flour, but probaby not much.

My husband said it was just like his mother used to make.  Now, that , is a rave!!!   I used the bacon fat, as suggested, instead of the butter.  I served it with pork and sauerkraut and it was just perfect!!!  I did boil it in salted water, as someone suggested and added just a little extra flour.

Great recipe! So for those of you who are making this for the first time, the "dough" is totally batter. It will look like pancake batter. You'll want to pour it over either a large hole cheese crater, or a colinder with big holes. Let it drip through the holes into the boiling water. This wasn't explained too well in the recipe, so I had to goolgle a video of it to make sure it looked right. But they taste great!

It's an easy dish to make and it's so tasty especially with a German red cabbage. I would say you almost need three hands moving the batter into your homemade spatzle maker (a plastic colander with holes made larger). 
I'll make it again soon!

A good spaetzle recipe, however I don't add nutmeg or pepper. Also, when I melt the butter in the pan for sautéing, I sprinkle in a bit of breadcrumbs to toast first before I add the spaetzle. Adds a nice flavour to the finished product.

Just like Spaetzle in Germany! I've been trying prepackaged Spaetzle noodle dishes from Aldi's and other grocery stores but nothing tastes like the real deal. Finally decided Christmas dinner was the right time to make it from scratch and this recipe was perfect. So happy I found it! We used a gallon ziplock bag with a cut in the corner to dispense the Spaetzle. It will naturally split and separate as it drops into the water. We started with a small slot and increased the size halfway through to give the dish a variety of size and texture. Remember to be patient when sautéing the Spaetzle- it has a lot of moisture so you will want to cook it for a good while until it has been browned. We finished it off with sautéed bacon and onions. Perfect.

Absolutely perfect. Scoop them out  as soon as they float and dump them into cold water. Then sauté as needed with whatever extras you desire. Spring for a spaetzel maker ($7.00) because it's so slick and fun!!

This recipe is almost the same as my Mum's. The only difference is she didn't add the nutmeg. A suggestion for those of you that want to fry it with bacon. Add some chopped onion with the bacon when frying. The caramelized onion give the Spätzle a little something extra.  We also add some grated cheese (usually Gouda or gruyere) and a beaten egg. Have that with a green salad and you have lunch.

Excellent consistency. Tasty and easy to make.  I used a cheese grater to push my dough through and it gave me picture perfect results.  Unfortunately, I didn't take any.  I will definitely make this again.

This was excellent.  Increased the recipe to serve 56 people, who all enjoyed every bite.  I used a slotted spoon to form the dumplings - very easy, very good and we followed the recipe exactly.  Served as part of our Oktoberfest lunch.

No changes and will make again!  My 1yr old had thirds ^_^  Only thing wrong is the serving size.  I made 3x this recipe for 8 of us, 2 of them are babies. However there were no left overs, I would say that I served 2/3 cup serving for 6, and the babies ate about a cup total.

I stayed true to the recipe, minus the parsley on top, and I added a little more salt than called for.   My kids loved it.  My husband said the flavor was good, but maybe a little more salt.  Adding Nutmeg to this recipe was a reaaally good idea I thought. Gave it just the bit of "something" it needed.

The batter Was somewhat thin, but that was perfect for putting it in a ziplock bag and squeezing out of the two holes I poked near one corner.  It was really easy to work with and turned out the same texture as what I've eaten in restaurants.  I'll definitely be making it again.

This gets made every year for our church's OcktoberFest.  We are a German Lutheran church, so these folks know their German food!  Members always ask if we are making it for this years dinner and are happy to wait while we cook it up fresh just before the dinner starts.  As others have said, the nutmeg is key to it being sooooooo good!!

I have never rated before but I thought I must this time.
This recipe does not work. How is it that there is so many five star ratings? Something's not right there. From all the other one star raters, I will use your words...gooey mess.

We have an annual Oktoberfest at our home for about 50 people and this is always a hit.   I serve it with a light chicken broth/gravy.  I use chicken broth instead of water to boil the spaetzel.

Having never had these before, I can't say anything about the authenticity of the recipe. However, they are pretty tasty. Kind of a lot of work and cleanup, but it is an interesting process, and I look forward to experimenting with what to serve them with in the future, since we ended up eating them kind of plain.

Terrific dish and always a favorite. I use smoked ham pieces often and finish the dish with shredded Swiss cheese on top. ( cover skillet with lid until cheese melts) Divine!

I made this last night and thought it was pretty good. I would have given it 5 stars but I did also think it was just a tad runny so I guess perhaps a little more flour or something because other then that, it was just fine. I will make it again but put in just a bit, not much, more flour.

Awesome ... I even had to use mostly bread flour and it came out good.  After simmering I sautéed it with butter and onions.  Reminded me of pierogi without the filling.  I just used a spoon and dropped the dough in and it came out as dumplings.  Use a tsp to do it with.  Simmered for almost 8 mins because they were a little thick which I liked.

Great tasting recipe as-is, but great if you add cheese.. about a half cup (or more if desired) of shredded mild cheddar while it's hot.

Pretty good. I make pasta and potato dumplings so I have experience with this type of dough and recipe.  First, use less milk about half what is called for.  It will make for easier handling.  I would use a little less nutmeg - personal preference but maybe 1/4+ tsp would give a nice hint of flavor.  I took advice to use pastry bag piping 2 inch pieces into salted boiling water - it worked well. I tried the strainer - complete mess.  Zip lock bag would work if you don't have pastry supplies.
Texture was perfect - be careful not to over cook. This is a keeper with a little tweaking.

Tastes just like Oma used to make!  Don't leave out the nutmeg - it gives an authentic taste. My favourite accompaniment is portobello mushrooms sautéed in butter with garlic and onion. Add a little flour, stir to combine then add some vegetable stock to make a gravy. Lecker Schmecker!!

The ONLY thing I have to say about this recipe for those who are not familiar with a spätzle maker, it's supposed to be more watery than doughy. (At least that's why I found) It's easier that way as the dough will drop out and into the boiling water.

I made this according to the directions, and it was delicious but the dough was so think that I had a hard time getting it through the spaetzle pan. When I made the second batch I just increased the milk to 1/3c and it was perfect

Great recipe! I had to add a little extra flour because I live in a humid area, but otherwise I followed the directions as written. The dough should be very soft but not too sticky, which may be the problem some other have had.

I needed to add a little bit more flour to be able to work with it better with a makeshift spätzle maker.  I added a small amount of thinly sliced fried onions like I had in Munich & it got rave reviews.  Sauté in lots of butter!

Great recipe. Easy. My husband loves this. Great for a side on a week night. I don't have a spatzel maker. I just put the mixture in a ziplock, cut the tip of snd end and pinch the dough as it comes out.

I used a holey slotted spoon and a rubber spatula to press it into the boiling water. Turned out great. I think the water must be at a rolling boil. They only took like a minute after I'd finished pressing them into the water. I'll definitely make it again.

I substituted half the flour with whole wheat flour and the butter for olive oil to make it a little healthier. Not traditional but still tasty.

I'd add a sauce the next time I make it, but it's a *definite* NEXT TIME. Very good!

This recipe was identical to what I had in Munich.  The only change I made was to cook in bacon grease after boiling and then adding the crumpled bacon to the dish for serving...amazing!! I highly recommend and please remember that not every region in Germany makes spaztle the same way.

This recipe is very good. Very authentic to what I would have in Germany. I don't know how anyone following the recipe would get a 'runny' batter. Adding more flour would create concrete! I followed the directions exactly and the only critique I have is that the recipe only made about 1/2 a cereal bowl... No where near enough for 6 servings!

So easy to make.  I put it in a ziplock bag.  Cut a small hole in the corner.  As I squeezed it out, I used a scissor to cut small pieces.  That was someone else's idea on All Recipes -- IT WORKED.  The taste was just right.  I live in Germany and these were just as good as the locals.  Will definitely make this again.

The dough was sticky, even after adding an extra 1/2 cup of flour, and stuck to the grater instead of grating. I had to use two teaspoons to create thin strips to cook in the water.  It took forever!
Also, they were bland other than a nutmeg taste. I would add onion powder or another spice.
I added mine to green beans cooked with bacon. Cooking it this way definitely improved the taste, as the spaetzle absorbed the bacon fat.
I will probably not make this again.

Well, this recipie was my first making spaetzle and turned out better than my husband's who is first generation German. Although the taste was a bit off to me and the ones that come in a bag from the grocery store are much better in my opinion. Thanks for the recipie though, fun experiment.

I have tried making spaetzle with a couple other recipes and it never came out quite like this. the nutmeg makes all the difference. white pepper probably would be good too but i never remember to buy it... anyway. i used a pasta straining spoon to make it. it works but its kind of a pain but works in a pinch. it also came out dense and perfect enough. i would have salted the water and will next time because i had to add salt to the finished product. this is a winning recipe for a pretty basic dish... me likey.

I cut the milk in half: 1/8 cup.  Then add a bit more milk tablespoon by tablespoon until its willing to drip from a spatula.  Boiled until they float up, which is  one minute.  The result should be  pieces 3/4-1" long.

I would have given this 5 stars if it had a proper amount of flour in the recipe! I followed the recipe exactly and the batter turned out very runny. I added an additional cup of flour and it was absolutely perfect, and the flavor was amazing. And I know good spaetzle because I recently spent six months in Germany.

As written this is good. I had to use a lot more flour than it called for to get the right consistency. Also, it is much better to add some crushed garlic to the butter before you saute.

Made these for dinner to go with my red cabbage recipe and some pork chops and gravy.  They were so very easy to make and so delicious, as good as any I've eaten in Germany!  Had no idea how easy it would be to make good spaetzle and now I know I will make them again and again.  I just had to add a little drizzle more milk to make them the right consistency to easily go through my spaetzle maker.  Definitely a keeper recipe!

We tried this tonight. I added butter and chicken bullion to the water. I don't have a large colander nor a spaetzle maker, so I took a slotted spoon and pushed the dough through with a spatula. I make jagersnitzel with mushroom gravy and my husband poured that on his second helping!

My 8 year old son ADORES this recipe, he says it's his favorite food. We all love it, especially when tossed with freshly grated parmesan. It's perfect as-is, and it freezes very well (if you make a double batch and freeze half for a quick weeknight meal).

Great recipe, though next time I think I'll use a little less nutmeg. We had a spaetzle maker so it was incredibly quick to make the dough and press it through the maker and into the pot. I pan-fried as per recipe, but next time I think I will skip this step. Our local Hungarian restaurant serves them just boiled and seasoned, and it gives them a lovely pasta-like texture and chewiness.

This recipe was very good, however the 'Most Helpful Critical Review' caused me to add more flour thinking it was supposed to be thick. This made a huge dough ball instead and I could not figure out how to get it through the sieve to make the dumplings. After fighting with different methods, I had to pull the dough apart by hand. I HIGHLY recommend watching the video, because I realized the critical review was NOT helpful at all! :( Will make this again, omitting the terrible review I followed!!

This was great! I'd never made or even tasted spaetzle before. After cooking it, I fried it with diced bacon and onion. LOVED IT! I'll be making it again soon. Thanks PaulaB for the flat cheese grater tip. That worked perfectly.

I have never heard of Spaetzle before I just happen to come upon it looking for another recipe. When I saw the pictures of it, it looked so good I had to try it. I didn't have nutmeg so I made it without it, and added bacon as suggested. I really enjoyed it!  I think this will be my new comfort food. Next time I will l try it with the nutmeg.  Thanks for the recipe!

The only reason I'm giving this two stars is the attached video. The recipe as written doesn't look anything like the batter in the video. It was too thick and lumpy. I'm not sure what other reviewers were doing that said it was runny. I had to add more milk just to get it mixed. The amount of nutmeg was WAY too much. There are much better recipes out there. The old German lady who taught me to make this years ago didn't measure it was all how the batter looked. She also taught me it was done when it floated which is about 1 minute not 5-8

Being a PA Dutchy and also surprised that the general PA Dutch... in Lancaster and Berks country really don't make it and the recipe is not in the usual PA Dutch cook books (not even E.E.Heller's... I discovered this recipe a long time ago.  It is exactly the same as the one I've used but with the addition of nutmeg.  I like that.  Usually, I saute` onions in the frying pan with the butter till they are caramelized then I toss the Spaetzle in.  Thanks for this... I also like the suggesion to us with Beef Stroganoff.

I can recommend to use a mixture of semolina flour, durum and normal backer's flour for awesome Spaetzle. We're producing home/hand-made Spaetzle and sell them in our Shop (Pasta Pronto) at 1/106 Swan Street in Guildford, WA. We have great recipees ready for you to take home as well.

Made this with red cabbage and jagerschnitzel. It turned out ok for me, but next time I want to add something to give it an extra bit of flavor.

Excellent! I used 1/2 whole wheat flour, so needed to add about 1/4 cup of water since it absorbs more liquid. This dough was thicker than I've made in the past, which was good. I use a potato ricer, and it means that the spaetzles held together well. I cook 1/3 at a time, fish them out with a strainer, and then when all are cooked, saute them in butter and then salt & pepper them liberally (I double the recipe, so it takes at least 2 batches to fry up; they would all get gummy in the saute pot at once). LOVE spaetzle! It's always great with German-type food like sausages with cabbage sauteed in the sausage pan with some s&p and a splash of balsamic.

This recipe is top notch. My fiancee and I, who have both been to Germany, agreed that this is exactly what we remembered and expected. The nutmeg really makes this recipe complete. I would say that getting the dough into the water can be a bit of a challenge because it is very sticky. I ended up pulling out chunks with a fork. The pieces were a little big, but that's okay. The dish was GREAT.

Made this with a traditional polish dish. substituted onion salt for salt and added 1/2 tsp of garlic powder. You can use either more flour if too soup or more milk if too stiff, just depends how you like your spaetzles delicious!

I made this following the recipe plus adding extra flour like CookingMaMa suggested. It was wonderful!!! I sauted the spaetzle in butter with onions and a bit of garlic. It tasted just like Germany.
Thanks for a great recipe and review. Sam2oona

This is a keeper...made it on the spur of the moment for a change from the regular potatoes.  It was quick, easy and turned out perfect...just like in a restaurant,  I couldn't believe I haven't tried sooner. Not enough to try as leftovers. Next time I will double the batch. Thanks

I made these to go with chicken paprikash, so left out the nutmeg - wasn't sure how that would blend with the main dish.  I tripled the recipe, but only used five eggs and 1 1/4 cup milk because others said it was runny.  It really didn't matter if the dumplings were shaped like spaetzle, so I used two teaspoons - scooping up dough on the tip of one and scrapping it off into the pot with the back of another.  Worked great.  Would definitely add more pepper and other seasonings as they were a little bland tasting.

This recipe is fantastic, I did enhance with garlic powder instead of the nutmeg as I was putting the spaetzle into chicken soup and it turned out wonderfully, just like a remembered from my Dad when he made his infamous chicken soup with little spaetzle like dumplings.

I've never had authentic spaetzle, but was making rouladen and it was suggested that it be accompanied by braised cabbage and spaetzle.  I thought I'd love it, since it seemed like it was just a kind of rustic buttered noodle.  Well, I tried to push the dough through the large holes of a cheese grater - that did NOT work.  I actually gave up at that point.  I added a ton of flour (as another reviewer suggested) to try to get it to work.  One of the guys I was making it for, had made it before and his wife makes it a lot.  He did need to thin in out, since I added so much flour, so apparently the consistency initially was more correct.  He though the cheese grater idea was ridiculous though.  He used a spatula and pushed the dough through the holes of a colander, placed over the pot of boiling water.  Toward the end, he just would drop dough in, in a free form fashion.  He said it looked just like his wife's.  Once it was done, I sauteed the spaetzle in a lot of butter and was thinking it should be delicious.  It was....bland.  No flavor at all.  Even with salt, pepper and parsley, I didn't think it was worth eating much of it.  But the guy that helped me said it tasted as it should. Not sure what the fuss was about.  I'd go with buttered egg nooodles or mashed potatoes in the future.

I thought this was perfect! The flavor was very nice and the consistency was perfect for running through my spaetzle maker. Although, I would agree with some previous posters that, this does not make 6 servings - we got 2 servings.

Most like the noodles they serve with Sauerbraten at the Slavic restaurant; also most like the noodles my husband's grandmother made by hand to go with chicken paprikash.  She was from Hungary, and was a great cook by all accounts from the family.

Can't believe how easy and cheap it is to make spaetzle.  I added more salt and also had fried an onion which I added to the fried spaetzle.  Made two batches.  One I added freshly grated cheese at the very end and parsley on top, the other I had fried up some bacon bits and added them with parsley on top.  Sauguat!

Very quick and easy.  (It took longer for the water to heat up than it did to make the dough.)  I used a bit more butter than the recipe called for and added a bit of salt before serving.

This is my go-to spätzle recipe. Turns out great. I always double the recipe because my kids love it so much. There's never any leftovers!
