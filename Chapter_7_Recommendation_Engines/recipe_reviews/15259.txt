TIME SAVER TIP!! I had no idea how many jars I could make with the amount of ingredients I had to work with since the recipe is for one jar at a time.  After a few hours, and learning what order I preferred, this is what I came up with.  For 12 jars, you will need to have 5 lbs W.Sugar, 4-10oz choc chips, 2-17.6oz M&M's, 1 large container of oats, 2-32oz B.Sugar, 2-5 lb bags of flour.  You will have left overs, but this will allow you to work like an assembly line, doing all the jars one ingredient at a time without running our of anything.  The order I used was as follows: W.Sugar, 1/2 cup M&M's, crispy rice, 1/2 cup swirled choc chips, oats, B.Sugar, Baking soda, Baking Powder, and finally flour.  Remember to pack down the filling jar after each ingredient is added, it will all fit very nicely!! Oh yeah, the cookies taste wonderful--I made some to keep in my own pantry!!!!

The recipe was a teenie tiny bit dry and I think it lacks a little flavor so I recommend adding vanilla.  I had a professional pastry chef taste test it and she tasted the baking soda immediately and she too recommended adding vanilla and possibly a pinch of cinnamon.  Other than that the reverse laying is the best and the cookie shape was great.  I gave them out as party favors and I had fun making and baking them.

In one word: YuM! I had no problem fitting this recipe into a quart jar. I used a plastic spatula to pack down after a few layers (layered sugar first, then oats, choc. chips, crispies, white choc. chips, brown sugar, then soda, baking powder and flour). I used the regular jars and a funnel for canning jars. The cookies were not thin at all ..came out perfect! (I used my medium [2 tablespoon] scoop from Pampered Chef ..uniform cookies and perfect shape and thickness.) They were a hit with everyone I gave them to ..presented as Christmas gifts ..in a gift bag I added the cookie jar (the lid covered with fabric and secured with twine), a wooded spoon with a twine ribbon attached, and a set of matching holiday pot holders. For an added personal touch, I also put in the bag a small box of flavored tea or small bag of gourmet coffee. It was great! Thanks for sharing this recipe Linda!

I too made many jars of this up for Christmas gifts (created a serious assembly line and it was actually fun) and we ate a few batches throughout the holidays.  Halfway through the gruelling (ha!) taste testing, hit on the idea of adding about 1/2 cup of butterscotch chips. Eureka! I skipped the fabric circle decoration, just tied a wooden spoon and handwritten directions to each with rough twine.  A bachelor friend says he's just keeping it as is to impress women.

But really, try the butterscotch additon.

What a great and easy cookie recipe.  I recieved only great raves when I made them.  The recipe is yummy as is but the 3rd time I made them, I substituted 1 tablespoon of vanilla instead of using the 2 tablespoon of water, turned out even better.

Very yummy cookie!  I got many compliments on them.  If I made them in a jar again I put half the flour, then the brown sugar, then the other half of the flour to make the layers look a little more vivid.

Wonderful!  I would advise adding "mix thoroughly" to the instructions because you are not creaming the sugar with the butter, so it takes awhile to blend.  I had a novice cook complain that they fell apart, but I believe that was because they were not mixed well enough before baking.  I substituted 1 Tablespoon vanilla for the 2 Tablespoons of water.  I would be thrilled to receive these as a gift.

This is fabulous. I did arrange the ingredients as follows, white sugar,oat meal, Krispies, white chips, choc. chips, brown sugar, flour. It was hard to find the Wide Mouth jars. I went to 10 stores, but Albertson's had them. It really does need to be the wide mouth jars or you will not be able to smash down the ingredients, and fit the entire recipe. These tasted wonderful.

We've given this mix as gifts for two years because it's everyone's favorite.  We follow the recipe exactly - absolutely wonderful!  Our advice would be to follow the recipe.

1) Remember to pack solidly as you go, or it won't all fit in the jar.
2) These are excellent made with M&M's and/or butterscotch chips...any substitutions I have tried with the "candy" layers have gone great!
3) They also bake up nicely...I had no issue with too-thin cookies.  They seem to mix up more easily/effectively kneading the dough with your hands.
4)  They taste fantastic!!!

I prepared both the decorative jar, and the cookie, for a "rehearsal" for possible holiday gifts this year. I wasn't too impressed w/ the layering of the jar (4 stars), so I'm going to tinker around w/ the order of the ingredients so that the layers are more distinct and less apt to "run together."  I did; however, get everything packed down to fit w/ no problem, and I went w/ 1/4 c. mini chocolate chips, and 1/4 c. mini M&M's. Baked the cookies as written, except added 1 tsp. vanilla extract. Very tasty cookie (5 stars!) that my tummy would be happy to welcome again. As far as giving the recipe as dry ingredients in a jar, I'll need to work on that some more.

I have been using this recipe for years. At Christmas, I have made these, using the Christmas Rice Krispies....it adds a festive look, without changing the original recipe. Instead of attaching a card, I found a recipe card template, on-line, and was able to add a family picture, in place of adding, who it was from. After printing it off(using regular printer paper), I taped it onto the jar...label style and attached a simple gift tag with a ribbon.

very good- I am making them as gifts this year. I did not have rice cripies on hand so I used chocolate crispies- I did layer the ingrediants differently then suggested. I have read that white sugar should be at the bottom otherwise it seeps down throught the layers and will ruin the layer look. I did white sugar,flour, baking soda and baking powder, oatmeal, brown sugar, cholocate chips, white chips and crispies.

This recipe has a lot of potential, but definitely needed some tweeking. The reason so many found it bland is that there is no salt. I consulted some other cookie recipes and decided to reduce the baking soda and eliminate the baking powder. So here is my revised version: 1) in a small mixing bowl mix the flour with 1/2 tsp. salt and 1/4 tsp. baking soda and add to jar (use a canning funnel to make this process much easier), 2) add brown sugar, then pack down with your knuckles, 3) add white sugar, then oatmeal, 4) add dark chocolate, then white chocolate, then pack gently down again, 5) add rice crispies.  I also made a few revision for baking: mix up the softened butter and egg, and add 1 tsp. vanilla. Add cookie mix and stir well. Don't add water! This dough will be a little crumbly, but just mold into walnut-sized balls and place on cookie sheet. Mine needed about 14 min. in the 350 oven, but of course this depends on the size. We all loved these!

I made these for Christmas gifts.  I tried a lot of recipes from this site to come up with one I would be proud to ask someone else to bake - this was it!  They were delicious, with so many flavors, we had to make several batches for ourselves to eat.  My 5 year old son was great at pouring the (pre-measured) quantities into the wide-mouther jars, so he could tell his teachers, etc. that "he made them."  I covered the lids with pretty fabric, which turned out to also cover most of the prettier ingredients.  Next time I might just wrap the lid in colored tinfoil or something that won't drape down.  We used M&Ms instead of white chocolate chips and had no problem fitting everything into the jar, we only packed the brown sugar.  This is a winner of a recipe.

I was looking at different cookie mixes in a jar to make for Christmas presents.  This recipe was OK, but the crispy rice cereal tended to go hard and chewy in the finished product.  I liked that the recipe was different and it looked great in the jar with all the different textures and colours, but there are other cookie in a jar mixes that I prefer.

Cookies were good! I think I would omit the oatmeal just because I am not a big oatmeal fan when it comes to cookies, but other than that I thought they were GREAT. My girls passed this out for christmas gifts.

We made 12 jars exactly as written for Christmas gifts this year. During the measuring and packing, we baked our own batch of these cookies and they are delicious! I will definitely make these for my six kids in the future. Thanks!

I made these with the white choc chips called for, but had the Girl Scouts assembling them substitute M&Ms for added color. Our troop made them in quart sized ziploc bags to give their moms for Mother's Day, slid them into  white paper bags decorated with hearts, added a topper and a heart cookie cutter tied onto it (granted, the cutter won't be used for this recipe, but it looks cute!) Made a sample batch for the girls to see what they were assembling, and they got inhaled!THANKS to Sparky for the grocery list - I layered white ingred. first, then brown sugar, cereal,oats, choc chips, M&Ms - taped recipe onto ziploc - looked great!

My kids and I made the jars together and was lots of fun. I would recommend placing in the following order: Sugar on the bottom, next Chocolate Morsals, rice crispies, vanila morsals, oats, brown sugar and last flour to the top. Starting with the sugar on the bottom keeps it from falling through, and the brown sugar holds the flour from doing the same.

I made this for Xmas gifts for friends, all came back with the same thing, you cannot cream butter and water, it curdles. For the next batch of gifts I layered the jar in dar and light stripes except for the white sugar which I put in a clingfilm bag and packed in the top, and on the tag said cream butter and white sugar, add 1 egg and 2 Tablespoons of water, and it worked a treat. For metric countries a quart jar is slightly smaller than a litre jar.

might go buy more jars to make more...this was my first time creating "cookie in a jar" gifts for Christmas and it was a lot of fun. I would like to keep some made up in my pantry for last minute thank you and hostess gifts. I used up items I had in my pantry so I made a variety of "flavors" - some had m&ms instead of chips. Others used Heath toffee bits instead of white chips. LOVED that I only had to dirty up one 1/2 cup measuring cup. no problems not fitting everything in the jar, but it came a little close on the ones that used M&Ms instead of chips. I selected this recipe over others because I didn't want to include nuts to avoid possible allergy issues, and I liked having Krispies as a unique layer.

I had to sample these before I give them out in the jars for Christmas.  So I made a batch last weekend.  They were a hit in my house.  I can't wait to assemble the jars and give them out.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Sorry, these just didn't have enough taste.  I added a teaspoon of vanilla, should have added more.  With the baking powder in them, they turn out like a biscuit, had to flatten them with a glass.

For all of you mathematically challenged people like me out there - if you add 1/3 cup butterscotch chips something's gotta give or it won't all fit in the jar!  Duh...!  So I dumped it all in a bowl and made samples out of my first attempt.  Very tasty!  Second attempt at layering was successful when I reduced the amount of white and chocolate chips to 1/3 cup.  Order I used:  White sugar, butterscotch chips, chocolate chips, rice krispies, white chips, oats, brown sugar then flour with baking soda and powder.  Also the cookies don't spread much in baking, so you can fit 20 to 24 on a sheet.

In a word: Yuck!  I'm experienced with baking and these were gross!  What's with the water??  It just evaporates in the oven and makes the cookies blend together into one big, extremely thin cookie on the cookie sheet.  The recipe is also too small for a 1qt jar so if the jar gets moved everything gets mixed up so you don't have the sandart effect.  I'm just lucky I tried them before I gave them out.  The "Cranberry Hootycreeks" are much better to give out as gifts.

great recipe:) i made some changes though, replaced the white sugar with some instant some instant cereals and it turned out with an extra touch of aroma, very nice:)
replaced margarine with butter and turned out great too. one prob i had is that the flip side of the cookie was still uncooked after 12 min, so i suggest cooking it at 150 degrees celsius for abour 12-15 min, should be better, if u like it slightly burnt, turn up the temp towards the end:)
thanks, this recipe is very versatile and easy to follow! will defnitely make this again

Great recipe.  We made 2 batches to try it out...one with white chocolate chips and the other with butterscotch chips.  Both were very good, but butterscotch had a little more flavor.

These cookies were dryer than I was expecting... a little more like a biscuit, as other reviewers suggested.  Even so, my husband couldn't get enough of them.  I'm planning to use these cookie jars as favors at a shower I'm throwing.

Baked a sample batch before making these jars for gifts.  YUMMY!  A great alternative to the usual chocolate chip!  My husband and 3-year-old also loved them.

This is a great recipe for gifts in a hurry!  I used the holiday crispy rice cereal for even more color and added a piece of fabric between the collar and the lid of the jar.  I took the advice of others and reversed the order for layering.  My seven year old son helped with this and it was fun because it was sooooo easy.

This recipe makes great-tasting cookies.  The only change I made while filling the jars was the order of ingredients.  I started with white sugar, then the oatmeal, raisins (instead of crispies), white chips, chocolate chips, brown sugar (the brown sugar keeps the flour from seeping through), and finally the flour, soda, and baking powder.  Once the jar lid is decorated with material and ribbon, the layered ingredients are visible and the flour mixture is hidden a bit.  It makes for a prettier appearance.

These were very good but we don't often get "crispy rice cereal" so I used chopped walnuts instead.
These cookies are very crispy

These cookies are pretty average. If you substitute vanilla for the water, I suggest not using more than 1 teaspoon vanilla. We taste tested these and I will keep looking for another cookie recipe to give for gifts.

My daughter and I made this into a production line and made 12 jars. On the card, I added vanilla to the recipe and optional nuts.  I decorated the WIDE MOUTH jar with holiday cloth under the ring and tied ribbon that matched the cloth on the jar ring.  Everyone loved them!

Looks amazing - really good sitting on the shelf. I gave them out for Christmas presents and everyone raved about them. I layered the ingredients as someone else suggested, and I think they looked much nicer, plus putting the brown sugar in the middle helps to compact everything down. Only thing that people have said was that the rice krispies went a little soggy in the cookie, but no one really minded

Thanks, Sparky, for your layering tips and shopping list.  I love the idea of holiday M&Ms instead of the white chips, and I used swirl chips instead of plain chocolate.  I really had to push hard to get the flour in, but I added 3/4 cup at a time and pressed firmly.  I posted a photo, it should be on soon.  These will be great items for our Cub Scout auction, and the 1st grade boys will have fun making them!

This makes great gift for special people.  I baked them first to see if we liked them - they didn't last very long.  We do have a family that doesn't like nuts, so I substituted M&M's - worked great.  I made several jars for Christmas, using Christmas fabric for the tops.  Everyone loved them.  Thanks for sharing.

I made this for my sister and brother-in-law for Christmas. They'll get it tomorrow, but I made a batch of the cookies tonight. They are wonderful! I did make a few teeny changes.. I used butterscotch chips instead of white chocolate. I also 'cheated' and used self-rising flour instead of all the baking soda/powder, and substitued vanilla for the water. The texture is different. Chewy, but crunchy. I can see why some people may not like the texture, but for me it was perfect. I will be using this recipe again! Thanks Linda!

These cookies were quite good, however, I did use only 1/2 tsp of baking soda, not the 3/4 tsp called for. I also substituted butterscotch chips for the white chocolate, and they were good! I'll be making these for gifts for Christmas this year!

The taste of this was not bad.  There was too much flour and baking soda though.  That in-itself I could have fixed, but I didn't like the texture of the cookie (because of the rice crispy cereal).  I won't be making these for gifts.

I made this recipe for Christmas gifts. I thought I'd better try the recipe to see how it tastes. I could not believe how good they are. They are one of the best tasting cookies I have ever made. The only thing I did different was instead of using Chocolate chips I used baking M&M's. Everyone who got a jar said how beautiful they are. This is one of the best Christmas crafts I have ever done. Even my husband helped me. The only problem is you can't stop after only 1 cookie, they are too good.

Last year our Girl Scout Troop used this recipe to make for our 'make it, eat it' patch, and it was great!  We used glass jars, Christmas fabric cut into 8 inch squares and tied it with red & green raffia.  Made copies of the baking directions on colored paper, paper punched the corner and tied in on with the raffia.  My Troop gave these to family and friends as gifts, and I received many compliments.  Needless to say, ALLRECIPES.COM received a lot of free advertisement that year!! :)

Excellent cookies and gift. I made a few changes. Used 1/2 tsp of both baking soda and baking powder and 1/4 tsp of salt - a reliable combination. And I changed the order of ingredients to create better defined layers starting with white chips, brown sugar, flour, choc chips, oats, white sugar and then crispy rice.

I just made these to test before making them for gifts.  I thought I did not like them at first but ate several.  I used white chocolate and butterscotch chips to see which I liked better.  Definately use the butterscoth chips.  I would give the recipe with the white chocolate a 2 rating.  Weird consistancy though.  Chewy and a little hard and they fall apart.  But like I said, I kept eating them.  So I guess I liked them.

Wonderful recipe!  My mom and I made these for Christmas gifts for friends.  We used this order- flour, oats, brown sugar, krispies, choc. chips, white choc. chips, then regular sugar in a plastic bag on top (so recipients could cream the sugar with butter).  We made a batch and they tasted wonderful!

I suggest reversing the order of ingredients.  This way the flour is on top of the brown sugar and not the cereal which it can leak down into.

Beautiful presentation and quite delicious! But I added a teaspoon of vanilla extract (I use Mexican Vanilla) which I think is essential and I added that to the directions on the jars I gave as gifts. Everyone raved after making them on how delicious they were. I gave these to my three grown nephews (all out on their own, all bachelors) and they were thrilled that they could make cookies on their own!

not tried this one yet but will soon..doing cowboy cookies in a jar right now for christmas presents..finding that its easier to put flour,soda,baking powder,salt mixture on bottom so it doesnt filter thru..then oats,sugars,nuts and chips on top.  tamping down (easy at first, then harder) after each addition, to get all ingredients in jar. put swatches of christmas cloth on top, recipe on tied ribbon, including contents of jar, so if they want to make these again they have measurements.

What a great gift idea! The first time I put all of the ingredients into a jar, all of it didn't fit. I tried again and REALLY packed down the brown sugar and it all fit! I continued on to make 4 more jars and it was all a perfect fit! Thanks for the great idea!

Very pretty presentation!  I used holiday M&M's and swirl chocolate chips as a previous reviewer suggested and layered them in a quart jar. These are a very good standard sweet chocolate chip cookie.  The Rice Krispies add a nice crunch.

Noticed that many reviewers mentioned lacked flavor so I mixed in 2 teaspoons vanilla extract to the brown sugar to evenly distribute the moisture before packing it in the jar. I was curious would the sugar get hard so I tested 1 jar a week later brown sugar was not hard or lumpy. excellent flavor

These are very tasty cookies! I've given these as gifts and made them. They are super quick to make even if you do it all yourself. The dough is easy to work with and they bake up with a great chewy, moist consistency. I really like the Rice Krispies in them. A nice change from your ordinary chocolate chip cookie!

I made these for my sister's bridal shower favors and have gotten rave reviews on the results from everyone! Guests at the shower still remember the cookies in a jar, even a year later. I totally recommend this particular recipe over other cookies in a jar because the unique combination of ingredients make it a little extra special, the measuring is simple for bulk quantities, and the cookies turn out delicious.

OH YUM! I sorta took a chance in making these cookies to give as gifts because I didn't actually test them before giving them away (all true bakers are gasping in terror) but truth be told, I'm getting rave reviews from the receivers and my belly is in total agreement. These are simple little cookies that really taste great! Two thumbs up!!

Excellent!!  These were delicious!  What a nice gift.  (I hadn't even planned to eat them myself until I ended up having to eat my first batch since I forgot to REVERSE the order of the ingredients listed as all the other reviews suggest---do not forget to do this!)  Mine came out thin & crispy---YUM!

These are a very tasty and crisp cookie. I use a wide mouth quart jar, it makes it easier to get the ingredients out of the jar. I wrap a fancy piece of material, tie with a ribbon and attach the directions to the ribbon.

The recipe worked but I am not sure I like the taste. I had an oatey taste but I think it was because I only put 1/2 cup M&Ms instead of 1 cup to replace the white and dark choc chips. More chocolate would mask the oat taste. Some people complained of a runny, flat cookie so I just omitted the 2 Tbsp water and used a large egg instead. Other changes I made were to reduce the baking soda to 1/2 tsp and the white sugar to 1/4 cup.

I made these one night along with the Brownies in a Jar 2.  Everyone with me absolutly loved these cookies!  I thought they tasted good, but could use a little extra sweetness.  So next time I make these (and I will be!)  I'm going to add in raisins, and see what happens.  =)

This recipe is just ok.  Based on the reviews, I was planning on making the jars for Christmas presents.  I would highly suggest making them first.  They are missing flavor.  I think they would be better if you added some vanilla and salt to the recipe.

Great gift idea, I didn't try them before giving a jar away. 
I thought I should try them so I made them a few days later and they look great and I love the chewy/crunchy texture but they were lacking flavour. It just tastes sugary to me.
I may try again by adding some  flavourings or something.

These cookies were even better then I expected.  I had kids pour the ingredients into the wide mouth jars. After making a few jars, we made the cookies.  Yum!  We will do this again.

This recipe has become a family favorite. The jars look very festive and make a wonderful gift. . . but I've found people prefer you to just give them already baked. They do not stick around long.

The cookie jars looked beautiful when completed!  I added the ingredients in the reverse order stated and they turned out great.  Instead of chocolate pieces, I used M&Ms, which were a hit with the kids (M&Ms are always a winner, it seems)!  I baked a batch of them, and I found them to be quite tasty although they spread out and were a little on the thin side.  Overall, I found this to be a wonderful "cookie-in-a-jar"!

Very quick and easy.  To decorate the jars, I used some Christmas theme fabric fastened to the top of the jar with an elastic band.  I then tied a ribbon around the jar lid (so the elastic band was not visible) and attached the directions to the ribbon.

We gave this jar as a gift to the teachers and bus driver at the end of the school year. We tried it out at home and we doubled it because like I said before I have 5 children. My 16 yr.old daughter made them and she found she had to add the sugars to the liquid before she added the rest of the ingredients. This won't work if it is all in a jar though. These cookies were excellent and it took less than a day for them to disappear!!!!

I made 24 of these for Christmas presents, they turned out great and were easy!  I changed the order a bit, I put the flour on the bottom (pack it down!), then just kept the colors separate.  I also made sure the white sugar was on top of the brown sugar, that way it didn't  "leak" into the other ingredients.  Everyone loved them and the cookies are yummy too!

we made 40 of these jars and taste tested one to make sure we weren't handing out bunk. these cookies are absolutely incredible. substituted m&ms for the white chocolate chips. the mix of the oats and rice crispys makes for a great texture. highly recommend. these will not last long.

Pretty good, chewy cookies.  The cookie itself doesn't have much flavor, it's all about the stuffing.  Instead of 1 cup of chips I did 1/3 cup each of white chocolate chips, macadamia nuts, and crasins.  A double-batch made 58 cookies with a small cookie scoop.

I'm sure they would be more yummy if I had chocolate chips, but I didn't have any. The rice cereal added an interesting texture, though not enough to keep me from noticing the kind of oily taste. So: good texture, not so good taste.

OK but nothing great.  Like the hint of taste of oatmeal and the crunchiness from cereal.

I put the cookies in the order that it stated and squished every layer down, but I couldn't get it all to fit! I'm going to try a different order from a review on here. I got to taste test the batch that didn't fit, and they were delish! Made about 16 cookies for me.

These jars were so easy to make that I let my 4 year old do most of it.  She is giving them to her teachers as gifts this year.  The cookies taste great too.
