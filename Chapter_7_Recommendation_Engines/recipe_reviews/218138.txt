a very nice shortbread recipe. i did it the easy way and mixed the dry ingredients in the food processor and then processed it with the cold butter (chopped into slices) until thoroughly mixed and crumbly.  then, in a bowl, added this mixture with the wet ingredients.  i always roll the dough between two sheets of wax paper to desired thickness (i did 1/4 inch) and then loosen the paper on both sides before cutting out the cookies.  This way, they transfer really easily to the cookie sheets.  Thanks, Hanner!

I did these in my Cuisinart food processor and thought "what a horrible and dry mess"....I dumped these onto a big piece of wax paper and started "working it" a tad bit and it came together so I rolled it out and chilled.  I cut out the entire thing, baked and was totally tickled when I baked the BEST "no spread and no weird shaped" Christmas cookies.  They cut and baked perfect and I have them frozen for decorating in another week.  This was an excellent recipe so if they seem dry to you or weird KEEP THE FAITH and keep going and you will be rewarded!  THANK YOU SO MUCH for sharing this recipe!!

I made these cookies along with gingerbread cookies and chocolate chip cookies. The shortbread cookies where a hit with my sons 5th grade class and everyone who came over for Christmas dinner. This will forever stay on my holiday menus.

Delicious recipe...they tasted like Lorna Doone's!  I'm an amateur so I wasn't sure if they were going to turn out well, but they were a hit! I even had a coworker say that it tasted like it was straight from a professional bakery!!  
I stuck with the recipe but cut it in half (I didn't have enough butter). The only modification I made was that I used only vanilla extract instead of the rum and almond.  Also, I didn't have a "pastry cutter" so I used a cheese grater instead and it worked perfectly!  I just made simple round cookies, but they would've been the perfect cookie-cutter cookie because it completely held it's shape.

Very good, everyone liked them.  A bit surprising how much time it took to make and ice them!  Made as hearts for valentine's day, left some plain and iced and iced/sprinkled others.  I liked the iced ones best, but I have a bit of sweet tooth!

Overall I just found this recipe average, not the go to cut-out cookie recipe I was hoping for. I made the recipe exactly as written except that I used a food processor to cut in the butter.  The flavor is an authentic, soft buttery, slightly floury shortbread one so if that's your reason for trying this, it's a good recipe.  I was disappointed that my cookie dough was very sticky and impossible to work with, even after ample time in the fridge.  The results were sporadic as far as keeping their shapes with many of them spreading too much.  I was careful not to re-use warm cookie sheets, I used parchment paper and chilled dough so I don't know what went wrong.

Cookie review only. 


This recipe was absolutely delicious!  It was my trial run for my Christmas cookies, and they were perfect. I did have to modify a bit. Here is what I did. 

- had trader joe wheat flour in hand. So that's what I used. Ran out of all purpose white flour. 
-used only Vanilla extract in lieu of rum and almond. (Didn't have those ingredients on hand) 
-used cheese grater as recc by another poster. 
-cut the recipe exactly in half. Yielded 14 large snowflake sized cookies. 

Buttery, but not sweet. The bleached wheat flour gave cookie a fine, grainy texture.  I will frost using candy melts. 

I look forward to using the exact ingredients just to give it a try.

These cookies came out so good. The only thing I changed was that I added Hazelnut extract to them instead of the rum/almond. What a Hit these are.I rolled out a decent thickness and ended up with 5 1/2 dozen.

I decided to get my step daughter involved since she likes baking. This is a very easy straight forward good receipe. The cookies are really good especially after the frosting has been applied. She loved the whole process and we will be doing this again!

My whole family loved these. I always have trouble with cutout cookies, the dough is the perfect consistency these were so easy to roll and come out perfect. I added a little pie spice and baking spice made for a nice flavor. After reading reviews I also used food processor for dry, butter and wet worked well. My only issue was they were a little delicate so transferring to cookie plate was yummy we got to eat the broken ones.

This recipe is now my go-to sugar cookie recipe.  I love the texture and ease to roll out.  A small amount of sugar makes them so much more palatable with or without frosting them.  My only substitution was dark rum instead of rum extract and almond extract.

These turned out fantastically. The kids don't even want to ice them :). We ended up adding 4-6 Tbs extra water to make it come together. Thanks!

Very nice recipe, I just made these very easy to make and I also added some chocolate chips in half the batter..
