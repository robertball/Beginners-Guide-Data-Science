Amazingly easy and delicious!  I'm going to bake my sweet potatoes from now on instead of boiling.  Baking causes water to evaporate, leaving an intensely sweet and flavorful potato.  Absolutely no sugar needed.  In the past, I've boiled my sweet potatoes, which made them lose a lot of their flavor.  Pureeing in a food processor gave them a creamy and airy quality that I never got with mashing by hand.  The only changes I made to make it healthier was to use fat free buttermilk, 1% milk, and half the butter.  It was still unbelievably creamy with these substitutions.  My husband, who doesn't care for sweet potatoes went back for thirds.

I've been making this puree for a very long time, since my oldest was very little. I don't use that much milk, just enough to thin it down enough to feed my child. Once he got older, I made it so I could add it to his macaroni and cheese mainly, but I'd stir it in to other foods to boost his vitamin/vegetable intake for the day. This is a good base recipe for most vegetable puree. If you'd rather not use milk or you have a lactose-intolerant family member, soy/rice/almond milk or broth works just as well.

I was so glad to have found this recipe. A restaurant by my house, that is no longer in business, used to sell a soft mashed sweet potato puree. It wasn't spicy or sweet but more buttery just like this recipe. I used to always order it. I started with 3 sweet potatoes. After they were baked I weighed them and they came out to be 1lb peeled. So, I just halved the rest of the ingredients. I added everything but no pepper. For the buttermilk I just did 2% milk and a couple drops of vinegar and let it sit. With the butter I used whipped butter to cut the saturated fat in half. I always roast sweet potatoes at 410 deg., for about an hour, and did the same with this recipe. I don't have a food processor, so I used the blender but I had to stop and stir a few times. I will definitely be making this every year. Thank you for posting a simple, basic, creamy recipe for mashed sweet potatoes.

Excellent.  I didn't even use the whole milk only a little buttermilk and the butter.  I didn't measure, but I don't think it was more than 1/3 cup or so.  It was the perfect consistency for me.  When I was growing up, candied sweet potatoes were always served with greens--usually turnip or collards--so I sauteed some collard greens with onions and a spalsh of Dale's, a drop of liquid smoke, and a nice splash of apple cider vinegar.  Took me back to my childhood only it was better!  I would suggest adding a little of the milks and then checking your consistency--mine would have been a soup had I added a whole cup of milk!

I made this for Thanksgiving and thought that it was OK.  My uncle really liked it, though.  It was really creamy and looked pretty but I thought that there was something not quite right about the flavor.  Perhaps I just don't care for the buttermilk in it.  I actually thought the potatoes tasted better before I added all the stuff.  It wasn't a complete failure, but I don't think I'll be making it again unless I decide to try it with all plain milk.

Like other people suggested, I lighted this up just a tad. I used I Can't believe it's not butter and I used 1/2 buttermilk and the other 1/2 Half & Half. I also added just a tiny bit of brown sugar.

This is a great base recipe - I agree with others that there is too much liquid.  I didn't even use 1/2 of the liquid called for.  You could certainly add nutmeg and or cinnamon to punch up the flavor.

I just made this and will serve with ham steak in a little while.

I baked 1 yam (the orange variety) at 425 deg. for 45 minutes, according to instructions. I didn't peel it; I put the whole potato into the Vitamix with 1/3 c. whole milk and 2 Tbsp. softened butter, salt and pepper (the ingredients cut by 1/3.) I licked the spatula, and I can tell you this is restaurant quality. I didn't add any ingredients. Enjoy, you Vitamix enthusiasts!

This preparation is def unexpected when it comes to sweet potatoes, but I really enjoyed the change.  I did add a few T of brown sugar and a few dashes of cinnamon.  Simple and delish!

Made this last night and served it with Grilled Pork Tenderloin by Betsy Carrington from this site and it was a wonderful combination.  The potatoes were quite sweet without adding any sugar and very silky.  My only complaint was that I thought there was too much liquid.  I mixed the buttermilk and milk together and added a little over half of it and my potatoes were too “loose.”  I’d have preferred them a little stiffer, but that is easily remedied.  I will definitely make these again.

ABSOLUTLY FANTASTIC! This is a very easy dish.  I made it as written, only sbustituting fat free milk & buttermilk. DELICIOUS!  I served it with Chilean Seabass, fresh greenbeans with garlic and a blue cheese, arugula and pear salad.  I can't wait to make it again.  p.s. I had to borrow a food processor and this seemed to be what makes this dish so easy and "silky sweet".  Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

The name of this recipe is perfect "Silky" -- it is truly a wonderful side.  The only change I made was cutting the butter back to 3 tbs and it  couldn't have been better!

Unbelievable.  Smooth, tasty and such a pretty color.  Not too sweet like so many sweet potato recipes.

The recipe was so delicious, creamy and easy to make. It was only for my husband and I, so I used 4 small sweet potatoes, roasted them until their skin easily came off (about 35 minutes) threw in my food processor and added low fat milk (it was all I had on hand) and added a little butter, salt and pepper. I was so incredibly creamy and delicious!

Used my KA with regular cake beater rather than a food processor. Other than that, stuck right with the recipe. So good! Fluffy, flavorful, and do-ahead friendly. Leftovers freeze nicely, too.

Whoa. I'd only had sweet potatoe purée/mash once before, with coconut in it, and the texture was really not good and it was too sweet. I really needed another savory dish to go with all the sweet stuff this Thanksgiving, and this was just perfect. Simple, easy, made it 2 days before as suggested. I don't have a food processer bush just used a sort of electric masher, and then a mixer, and it was fine (a few tony chunks but silky enough!) The butter and salt and milk made it oh so lovely, put it in individual cups and topped with roasted pine nuts. It was gone before the pumpkin pie...

This was a great base recipe for what I wanted. I was hoping to find a sweet potato recipe that had no added sugar, because I was making it with my diabetic sister in mind. I found that it needed a little something extra though. Well, I actually changed quite a bit, so here it is: I used 2 (13 oz) cans of sweet potatoes (no syrup), 2 tbsp skim milk, 2 tbsp fat free half and half, 1/4 cup low cal tub style margarine spread, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, and 1/4 cup sugar free maple syrup. I used electric beaters to whip all the ingredients together into a silky smooth puree. Then when dinner time approached I microwaved it covered for 5-6 minutes, stirring every minute. Absolutely delicious and smooth. With this basic recipe I can tweak it to make it sweet or savory.

These were just wonderful! I made them Tuesday to serve Thanksgiving Day. So sweet and the texture is dreamy. I was done with over sweetened, doctored sweet potatoes; these don't need a thing! I used 1/2 the liquid and used Fat Free Half & Half and just 2 tablespoons of butter. Wonderful!!

I love sweet potatoes, so I knew I would like it no matter what. And it was good, the only thing I didn't like was it looked like baby food on the plate. Maybe I pureed it a bit too much, but the taste did not match the look of it.

I used heavy whipping cream since I didn't have whole milk on hand, and left out the buttermilk.  They turned out very smooth and creamy, delicious!  I used canned sweet potatoes, mashed them with a fork, and then put them in the food processor.  Using the mixer seemed to pull out a lot of the small husk pieces that were still on the potatoes, they were wrapped around the beaters.  I will be making these again!  Thank you!

This recipe was great.  I made it the day before and reheated it in the oven.  Might make it instead of mashed next year, as it's awfully similar in texture (but not taste).

Excellent!  I don’t make any changes -perfect as written. It’s a a great side dish for the holidays, especially because it can be made ahead of time. Thanks for the recipe!

This is an amazing dish! I had to make my own buttermilk, easy peasy. I used half the butter and still found that too much, next time I will leave it out. Baking the sweet potatoes at such high heat almost caramelized them, so they were very soft and very sweet. I think this dish will become a regular on my table.

My wife said it’s the best sweet potatoes she’s ever had. Great recipe. I added a teaspoon of nutmeg and it was really nice.

This was very good.    One recipe served 11 people.   Made 2 days ahead and it warmed up very nicely.

This was so wonderful! I replaced the buttermilk by heavy cream and it was delicious! Will make again very soon! Thank you!

Absolutely delicious!  I didn't even add much butter because it was so yummy before putting the butter in.

Quite good!  Even my sweet potato hating husbands went back for seconds.  Instead of the food processor, I put the baked and peeled potatoes through a ricer.  Worked beautifully. May make this for Thanksgiving.

I made this according to the directions (except I used 6 Ready to Microwave Baking Sweet Potatoes and then used the mixer to blend.)  These were delicious and had a wonderful texture!  My family loved this recipe and my daughter that LOVES sweet potatoes (baked only) couldn't get enough of them!
