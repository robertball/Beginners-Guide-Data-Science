This recipe is DELICIOUS!! Don't pass it up!! What makes it even better is that you can use fat free cool whip, fat free/low fat cream cheese, and skim milk and it'll taste EXACTLY the same! (I swear it, I really promise. All of the banana, vanilla, and pineapple make you forget there's so little fat!!  HERE'S A TIP:::: Putting on the cream cheese layer will make you want to scream and pull your hair out!! If the crust isn't perfectly cool and pressed down enough, it'll pull the crust up when you try to spread it. When you have the cream cheese & sugar mixing, add a few tablespoons of milk to thin it just enough to make it spreadable. Then spoon it into a large ziploc bag and snip off the end. Pipe it onto the crust, going along the edges so it touches the pan, and in lines across it. Spread from one line of cream cheese to another, so the crust won't pull up.  ENJOY!! (I know you will!!)

I made this for Christmas Eve dessert and everyone loved it.  I used powdered sugar instead of regular sugar when blending with the cream cheese.  I also added all the bananas in the inside instead of on top.  On top I sprinkled with graham cracker crumbs and added maraschino cherries.  Excellent.  Will definitely make again.

This is fabulous. I have made it twice for a cook out dessert. I lighten it up by using 2 reduced fat keebler graham crusts, fat free, sugar free vanilla pudding, 1% milk, lite whipped topping, and reduced fat cream cheese. I also slice my bananas into the pineapple juice after draining my crushed pineapple. Then I drain the bananas, put them in the pie and save one in the juice for the top. That way my bananas dont turn brown. I also have two pies so if we dont cut into one, I can send it home with someone.

I made the following changes: For the crust, I used 1/3 cup melted butter not 1 stick; for the cream cheese layer, I used 1 box of confectionary sugar not white sugar, I also slided my banans into the pineapple juice after draining my crushed pineapple and then drained them for the banana layer and I only used 4 medium bananas and didn't put any on the top layer. On the top layer I used the pecans, marachino cherries and drizzeled a little chocolate over it. I also used low fat cream cheese, 2% milk and sugar free pudding to reduce some of the calories.  It was very good.

Great easy recipe.  Easy to change flavors by substituting different fruit and different pudding flavors.  I used low fat and sugar free products and my family couldn't tell the difference.

This is my favorite summer dessert. It's so light and airy. I make a few minor changes, but it's perfect the way it is too. I think the dessert comes out better (taste wise and construction-wise) if you make it ahead of time.

Made exactly as stated.  Everyone loved it, but could not taste the pineapple.  Definitely add milk to cream cheese to help make it easier to spread!!  Tasted just like a very good banana cream pie -- not a banana split cake.  Would definitely make again.

A big hit at any party!  Absolutely Fabulous.  We have made it using sugar free and low-cal. products and it is still soooooo sinful.

This is a great summertime recipe and everyone will love it. My mom made this for my high school grad party 27 years ago and its still a favorite. 

I switched out the graham cracker bottom with crushed vanilla wafers and 1/2 cup of butter instead; I also added freshly sliced strawberries on top of the banana layer. Top with chocolate syrup and put out extra toppings on the side. 

Definately thinning out the cream cheese layer with some milk or cream will make it an easier task.

Have mercy on my soul!!! Heaven in my mouth! Perfect summer recipe or a great way to taste summer in the middle of winter. Just for a variation, I've added shredded coconut on top and I've also added cherries on occasion. You will NOT be disappointed and it's a definite crowd pleaser. MAKE THIS!!!

This is just too yummy!  I made it for a collegue's birthday and the staff devoured it.  I made a few changes to the recipe, they were mostly mistakes, such as placing a thin layer of banana over the cream cheese layer, mixing the well drained crushed pineapple with a bit of milk and some of the vanilla pudding to make a thin icing like sauce which I spread over the banana slices.  I then added a second thin layer of bananas; I thinned the pudding with a few tablespoons of milk and spread this over the bananas without mixing in half of the whipped cream (oops!) but it worked fine.  I used 2 cups real whipping cream,whipped it with a 1/4 cup sugar and spread it over the cake.  I used toasted coconut on top instead of the chopped pecans, which made this dessert more tropical.  Super yummy!

I wasn't very impressed with this dessert. It basically tastes like banana cream pie with pineapple in it. I used only 4 bananas, which I sliced and dipped in the pineapple juice, and didn't use any on top. I also used only 3/4 cup chopped pecans, which was plenty. This dessert isn't bad, but it's nothing special, so I probably won't make it again. There are many other dessert recipes that use instant pudding, cream cheese and Cool Whip that are much better.

This dessert is EXCELLENT! I make this exactly as stated, except that if I don't have pecans on hand I'll use walnuts and I add maraschino cherries to the top as well. This is a great, simple dessert anytime of year, but especially in the summer~YUM! :)

This recipe is just fabulous!  It is not too rich and if the bananas are ripe enough it tastes like banana cream pie with a punch of extra flavor from the pineapple.  I did not change a thing in the recipe, but my co-workers, family and neighbors all enjoyed this, there was none left to take home!

Absolutely phenomenal. Instead of pecans, I topped it with maraschino cherries and mini chocolate chips. So  so good.

I gave this a 5 because, when made properly, this cake is amazing!  Having said that, I can't get this recipe right to save my life!!  It always ends up soupy and I have no idea what I'm doing wrong.  I feel like I follow the recipe exactly, but something happens with the jello pudding/whipped cream layer that ruins it every time.  Help!!

This recipe is similar to one I use - to add a little "pop", use cinnamon graham crackers - it makes the whole dessert!!!
