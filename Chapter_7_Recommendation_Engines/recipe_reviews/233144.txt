not being fans of mushrooms or pepper jack cheese I changed a couple of things, I omitted the mushrooms and threw in a firm handful of chopped spinach and I used Swiss in place of PJ cheese.  Also  sautéed my onions in the sausage pan, as I was out of Olive oil.  Came out great and I will definitely use this one again!

so happy to have this recipe! Used what I had in house...italian sausage, mexican blend and cheddar cheeses...but it was the texture that sent me over the moon.  It was "sturdy" yet light and filling. Spouse raved. I believe the mayo turned this trick. I will make again with the pepper jack which will probably make this my favorite quiche ever.

This recipe was good but I had to lower the temperature (to 375) and I put cheese on top after I take it out the oven, otherwise it forms a hard crust and it is hard for the egg mixture underneath to bake.

We made this for my husband to take to his wild mushroom club meeting.  We had never made quiche before, but the recipe made it easy.  It was a hit, everyone said it was restaurant quality. We made 2 quiches and he had only a small amount left.  We used dried mushrooms that we soaked & drained before using.  Next time we will add more mushrooms and put the cheese on just a few minutes before removing from the oven.

I make this for the family I nanny for- 6 kids and this one pleases them all! The only thing I change is I take out the mushrooms. It's never turned out less than perfect :)

This was an awesome and easy recipe. I made it almost exactly as directed. The only thing I did different was add chopped fresh spinach. I also used Colby cheese because that's what I had on hand. It turned out perfecto! Super yummy too!

I tweaked the recipe by changing a few ingredients. I sautéed two chopped cloves of garlic in one tablespoon of butter until they were lightly browned. I didn’t use onion or mushroom, but added spinach and feta cheese. The garlic and feta gave it such a rich flavor! This quiche is so delicious, I’m absolutely delighted with how it turned out, and this is a recipe I will be saving!

Delicious....substituted bacon for sausage and added (steamed) broccoli, extra mushrooms.  Also baked at 375.  Perfect texture and flavor.

Very tasty and easy to make, but since I had a whole pound of sausage (hot breakfast kind) and only one pie crust , I doubled the eggs, mayo, milk and cheese. Used a 4oz can of mushrooms with rest of ingredients the same.. Divided mixture in half. Filled the crust as stated, forgot the extra cheese on top and cooked as directed. To the remaining mixture, I added 1/2 cup of Bisquick  and 3 crispy cooked bacon strips that I crumbled. After stirring to mix, I poured it into a greased 8x8 pan. Cooked for 25 minutes at the same time the other one was cooking for 40. They both were delicious!
