Made this twice for two different Thanksgiving crowds, with and without heavy whip cream. HEAVY WHIPPING CREAM MAKES THIS DISH!!! Don't sub anything low-cal, if you're trying to watch your fat calories, go eat a carrot.
Also, I took the suggestion of sprinkling more cheese on top and putting it under the broiler for a few minutes; it looks a lot more appealing this way. (But delicious either way). Thanks for a wonderful appetizer!

OMG!  This is the BEST dip ever!  Great hot or cold...I've made this at least 10 times in the last 3 months or so, and it's always a hit.  

I always substitute a big jalapeno (or 2 small ones) for the pimentos, and add a couple cloves of freshly minced garlic.  Also, I squeeze the juice of one lemon into the mix before baking.  You can substitute a bunch of chives for the green onions for extra flavor - if not, I recommend just using a small bunch of green onions, instead of just 2 TBSP of them.  If you like seafood, add a 6ox. can of flaked crabmeat - YUMMY!

I always serve these with Tostitos lime flavored chips, and usually make a double-batch because it goes so quickly!  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

Yummy.  I added chopped green chilies in place of the pimento and it was very good.  Served in a sourdough bread bowl.

Very yummy recipe. To cut down on the fat, you can use evaporated skim milk in lieu of the heavy cream. I personally don't recommend low fat mayo. Hey, it's probably a party anyway so have fun!

Made as written except substituted finely chopped jalapenos for the pimento. The dish was practically licked clean by co-workers within the first 20 minutes of a potluck lunch.

My family always asks me to make this at all of our family gatherings.  So yummy!  One word of caution, only use quality parmesan cheese!  The cheaper brand cheese will really affect the taste.

Good recipe but next time I will add a touch of jalapeno peppers for a spark. It was kind of on the bland side to me but still tasty. I served it on toasted sourdough cocktail bread and think that is the only "dipper" I would use for this dip. I will make it again.

This is great served in Hawaiian Bread- available almost anywhere. Cut a large core into the loaf for the dip, spray with olive oil before stuffing with dip. Use the remaining bread as "croutons", cubing and lightly toasting them.  I added just a PINCH of crushed red pepper flakes when blending the cheese. GREAT presentation! Dust with paprika to add color. Thanks for a great  recipe!

Very good! I used light mayonaise because that's all I had and it was still good. I prefer it without the pimentos. Great anytime.

This was a very easy and tasty appetizer.  I served it with thick cut tortilla chips and everyone raved.  I used a combination of asigo and parmesan chesses and sprinkled some on top to bake.  It was really good.

This was a winner!    I used 1/3 cup parmesan, 1/3 cup Asiago cheese,  and 1/3 cup Mozzarella.  I omitted the pimento's.  I will definitely be making this one again and again!

Fabulous!  Would definitely make again.  Changes:  substituted chives for the green onion.  Added 2 cloves of fresh minced garlic, added 2 finely chopped jalapenos (deseeded), add a few sprinkles of ground cayenne pepper.  Did not add pimentos.

This is so good! For some reason our guests didn't finish it (the true hallmark of a great dip) but maybe because a little goes a long way. Don't cut corners on this...use full fat everything because it does make a difference. Just make it only once in a while instead. Very yummy

This is the king of all artichoke dip recipes. I've tried a few versions out there and none come remotely close to this one. This recipe doesn't need any tweaking at all--it's perfect! The tart artichoke with the rich mayo & cheese = heaven. I make this at any and every holiday and serve with toasted baguette slices. YUM!

This was SO good!  I too used jalapeno instead of pimento.  I served it with toasted baguette as an appetizer before a pasta meal.  I had about half of the dip leftover so a few days later, I used it on a pizza crust, topped with mozzarella cheese and fresh tomato slices.  It was fabulous!  I have thought of many other uses already-pasta sauce, chicken topper, sandwich filling for pita bread-I could go on and on!  Thanks for the great recipe-an instant favorite!

I ALWAYS rate AS WRITTEN.  However, this is easily a magnificent, 5-star recipe by simply replacing the pimentos with 1 large, or 2 small, jalepeno peppers (as others suggested).  With the pimentos only it is very bland.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!  Sooooo good for football season!

I hated this.  If you like hot mayonnaise, then you will enjoy it.  I gave it two stars because the ladies at the baby shower I brought it to gobbled it up.

MMMMMMM MMMMMMMM MMMMMMMM MMMMMMMMMM MMMMMMMMMMM...........this is the best!!! You don't even care how many calories are in this baby....  it's worth gaining a few pounds for! Any chance this is good for ya???  I substitued jalapeno also and melted a couple of pieces of monteray jack cheese w/peppers and added to mixture. Nice kick! Although I'm sure it's great as the recipe reads. Beware those who've never tried this... once you start you can't stop. Thanks for sharing this Pam. XOXOXOX

One word: Wonderful! I added some garlic chives to flesh out the green onions a bit which added a nice accent. Wheat crackers and Triscuits are my family's dipper of choice for this yummy appetizer.

This was pretty good...I used Parmesan & Romano cheese, and put in a bit more mayo (used light mayo)  than called for to make it creamier.  I also added some chopped spinach, and omitted the green onions because I didn't have any.  After trying it, I added 1/2 cup mozzarella, some garlic powder, salt, and black pepper which added alot.  As my dipper, I toasted some thinly sliced french bread (topped with melted butter, garlic powder, basil, and paprika...which looked beautiful! - baked at 400 degrees for 15 minutes).  Excellent!  We ate half with dinner last night and then I brought the rest in to work today for everyone to try...they all loved it!  I think the leftovers were even better, so I'll probably make it ahead each time I serve it.

This recipe is great when baked inside a hollowed out round loaf of bread (a ciabatta round works great) use the bread taken from the centre to spread the dip on.  Also, mixing parm and asiago makes this incredible!

Wonderful...Thank you for sharing this recipe.  I've already made it for 2 parties and received rave reviews.  I found you can heat it in the oven and transfer it to a crockpot or just heat it in the crockpot. A double recipe fits a 1 quart crockpot perfectly but don't expect leftovers.  For ease I served it with thick tortilla chips as another viewer suggested but a sliced baguette would also be good.  I made the addition of a couple dashes of hot sauce.

This is a really fabulous artichoke dip. I've tried several and they're inevitably too mayonnaisy - but not this one. I dunno about the "32 servings" tho - we downed it with only 10 people!  will definately make again :)

This is very very good.  Very.

Filling, though, so don't eat too much before supper!

Serve on wheat thins!  Yum!  Or warm bread to be decadent  :)

Quick and easy and delicious too.  What more can you want in a recipe.  My husband was eating the dip on a spoon before guests arrived. It was the first dip I have ever made & it was a big hit.  I served it with sour dough bread and crackers.  It was truly delicious.

SO GOOD!!! I made this exactly as directed, only omitting the green onions because I just don't like them, and it was a hit! Even my children gobbled it up, it was just so incredibly delicious!!! I love how simple it is to throw together, all with stuff I tend to have on hand in my pantry. This was definitely a no-muss-no-fuss-incredible-results kind of recipe. Thank you so much for sharing it, I will be making this many more times to come!

Excellent dip, I'm in Australia and don't have access to pimento, so instead used some pickled sliced chilli's and added extra parmesan. Served with carrots, celery and mini toasts. Thanks ;)

I've made this recipe several times and everyone loves it!  Instead of the green onions and pimentos I just chop up some sliced jalepeno peppers.  I also use the fancy shredded parmesan cheese, NOT the kind in the can. Yummy!

My boyfriend's family went crazy for this dip this Thanksgiving! Now I have been nominated to bring it every year. I may use a little less mayo next time, a little too tangy for my personal taste buds but no one else seemed to notice. I add a package of frozen spinach for more vitamins and taste.

This dip was awesome.  Made this the day after Thanksgiving for a football party - and everyone asked for the recipe.  I made in a small crock-pot, added 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese, and instead of pimento's I chopped up a fresh jalapeno - perfect.

Very good dip. I recommend using marinated artichokes from a jar as they have a better flavor, but just make sure to drain them very well. Also I like using an italian cheese mix, some diced red bell pepper, and adding the green onions at the very end so they stay fresh & crisp.

This is a great recipie.  I made a double batch for a baby shower and it was all gone in 15 minutes!  The only thing I changed was adding a little garlic powder.  I also put it under the broiler for a short while to brown the top.  It was very delicious.  Thanks for sharing!

Very good- I modified a bit. Substituted cream cheese for whipping cream. Added 2 cups chopped fresh spinach & 1/4 c.red sweet pepper(diced very fine).  
Next time I'd likely use a bit more cream cheese & maybe a bit less mayo.

This recipe is amazing. I make this for every party I host, every gathering I attend and there is never a single bit left. I have even caught people scraping the bowl with their fingers to get the last of it. I ALWAYS double it because it goes so fast, I bake for 45 minutes to get it nice and brown. There is usually kind of a grease layer on top but I put the baked dip in a hollowed out loaf of french bread and this seems to soak up the grease. DEF make this and serve with pita chips, torn up french bread, baguettes, or even wheat thins.

Thanks for this super easy, delicious recipe!  I added a little jalapeno for heat and some sauteed mushrooms.  It was a definite hit.

My in-laws really liked this dip for Thanksgiving, but I felt that it was lacking somehow.  I normally don't like dips with a mayo base, so I think that's why I didn't eat too much of it.  Maybe next time I'll substitute cream cheese for the mayo and also add more Parmesan cheese.  TIP: My in-laws said this dip tasted really good with corn tortilla chips (as opposed to the other crackers I served alongside the tortilla chips).

This is the best! Only 4 stars because I made it by following the directions of the reviewer named SKYGRETCH...and it was a hit. I am planning to make it again for a Christmas party tomorrow. I used crab claw meat, and I chopped up the jalapenos (seeds removed) in a cuisanart with the other stuff.

I omitted the pimentos and substituted a jalapeño. Also added a couple of cloves of minced garlic and some extra cheese, mozzarella or any other kind of Italian blend I have on hand. I mix the extra cheese in the dip and sprinkle some on top. Amazing and always a big hit. Thanks!

This was an awesome recipe that I made at Thanksgiving. I did everything that it called for, and then added some chopped spinach to make it a spinach/artichoke dip.  Everyone who tasted it LOVED it and complimented me multiple times. I quadrupled the recipe and even that wasn't enough for our family of 12! We all ate so much, it was delicious. I am making this again for Christmas!

I love this recipe. Next time I make it, I think that I will add some jalapeno ranch dressing instead of mayonaise. I think that it needs a little heat. I made this for a wedding shower and put it on bagette bread. Everyone loved it.

I thought this was great. It was so simple to make.  It was great warm out of the oven and even cold the next day. I will definitely make again. I may try it with a little jalapeno added next time like others have suggested, but it is also very very good just the way it is.

This was delicious!  I used marinated artichoke hearts and jalapenos instead of pimento as other reviewers suggested. It had a nice little kick to it. I took it to Bunco and the ladies loved it.  I doubled the recipe and it was all eaten!  YUM!

This is a great recipe - I used it for a Thanksgiving appetizer. I followed other raters suggestions such as, replacing pimiento with jalepeno (I used one small one, since kids were eating too), and broiled for a few minutes at the end to let the cheese on top (that I added) brown up to look yummy. I will keep this one!

I used diced green chili’s instead of pimento. The flavor was amazing. I also used light mayo (all I had). After reading the reviews I will definitely not use light mayo again, as it as slightly runny: I also sprinkled parmasean cheese on top. Love this recipe!!

Amazing! I make it for every party I attend/host! I never have green onions though so I use 1/2 a yellow onion, and jalapeños instead of pimentos. Also, I use only half the mayo and substitute half for sour cream. I have been asked for the recipe so many times!

My lower rating is based on comparison to other artichoke dips and I felt this one lacked some of the strong flavor I was used to.

Made for a party and everyone loved it.  Even a few people who commented that they don't like artichokes loved this dip.  It was incredibly easy - the easiest dip I've made.  I only regret that I didn't make more because the dip went very fast.  I'd recommend making double because it goes really quickly.  The serving size "32 servings" seems like a lot but its really not very much.

I made this as one of our game night appetizers. It was an absolute hit!  I doubled the recipe and it was devoured very quickly and some of the wives wanted the recipe. I served it with French bread, garlic French  and tortilla chips. It's been requested again for Super Bowl weekend. Delicious!

Awesome dip!  Substituted pimentos for sun-dried tomatoes. And since I made it the first time I have keep that up. (Never have pimentos). Also I love cheesy dips so I added 1cup mozzarella too.  So yummy!

I would probably only give this a 4 according to the ingredients listed for the recipe, but it deserves more than a 5 with the additions and changes!  I don't like pimentos, so I added a jalapeno pepper instead.  I followed advice from other reviews and added lemon juice and minced garlic as well.  Delicious!

Just like you would get at a restaurant.  I followed another reviewers advice and baked it right in a bread bowl. ( Mmmm - 2 die 4 )  I left out the green onions and added chopped spinach.  The entire thing was gone by the end of the night, including the bread bowl.  Thanks!!

I didn't think this was great.  My guests liked it but I wasn't wowed at all.  I threw everything in the food processor to eleminate any chunks and maybe that changed the taste?  I was really looking forward to this after reading the other reviews.  I won't make this again.

I've made this for company twice now, and it has been a hit each time.  Everyone is beging me for the recipe.

Pretty good...but didn't rock my world. A lot was left uneaten at the party. I may make it again and give it another chance.

This was good, but not the over the top, want to eat it all by myself, I was hoping for.  My husband, 13 year old and 5 year old really, really liked it....I would make this again, but it was just missing something....

This dip is awesome!  When I make it every one raves over it.  Sometimes I have cravings for this dip, that's how delicious it is.

Excellent recipe. Made for Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Years. For Christmas I doubled the recipe for New Years I had to triple it. This is a true winner. Will continue to make.

This was gone about 5 minutes after being put out on the table.  I'll make this appetizer again and again.  Thanks for posting!

This was good but more average than spectacular in my opinion. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of the green onions. I added onion powder instead. Maybe that made the diffrence between average and spectacular.

This artichoke dip was the hit of the party, even though I did accidentally put too many peppers in!

Excellent dip! Very easy to make, but so wonderful. Thankfully I doubled the recipe because apparently everyone else loved it too.

Extremely easy and very tasty.  I would recommend being prepared to double or even triple the recipe for large parties.
