Many Cajun "stews" also use chopped celery and minced garlic, which I added to this. Because I like Cajun food a bit on the spicy side, I used RoTel tomatoes rather than regular ones, also, and I used fresh okra (which I cut up myself) as well (but frozen okra will do just fine, as long as its unbreaded).  A word of caution: Cajun/Creole pre-mixed spice, such as Tony Chachere's or Zatarain's, already has plenty of salt in it, as well as red pepper and other spices. If you use the spice, don't use additional salt. Instead, just use the Cajun/Creole spice to taste, and if you want a bit more zip, you can splash a dash or two of Tabasco onto your serving, which won't substantially add salt.  Serve it up with some hot garlic bread, and you've got a quick, simple meal in itself. Also, if you want a twist, rather than adding shrimp, boil a couple or three chicken breasts until they're cooked, cut them into chunks, and make chicken and andouille stew. You'll love it!

This was great and so easy!  I added some celery and garlic and used polish sausage instead of andouille.  I will definitely be making this again and again.

I made this not so easy on myself as I bought shrimp that I felt like I had to spend forever on to de-vein and remove the shells (cause I'm cheap) and I will not make that same mistake again...lol. Anyway, onto the rating. I think this was quite good, though I felt like it was a wee bit too salty for my taste. I'll have to check if my Cajun seasoning I used contained salt. My husband felt it was too spicy (wimp), but a family friend who previously resided in New Orleans said it was excellent and not spicy at all. I served this over brown rice and boy does it stick to your ribs! Thanks for the recipe!  P.S. It was impossible for me to find fresh or frozen okra at any grocery store in this area (NJ) - I checked 4 stores! Finally just bought fresh at Produce Junction. We Northerners are denied easy okra access! :P

Great recipe! I simplify the recipe withtout using the meat, onions, and bell pepper. It is a great, healthy side dish when served with brown rice as well!

Very easy to follow recipe. Followed it, except for adding regular salt because the Cajun seasoning was salty enough. Turned out fantastic.

This was okay.  It was bland for my husband and I but we like complex flavors.  We like gumbo much better.  I'm not sure I'll be making this again.  If I do, I will use crushed tomatoes instead of diced.  I browned the sausage first and then cooked the onion/peppers in the sausage drippings.  Even then, it didn't do it for us.  I used Tony C's spice; very salty (there are better seasonings out there). Sorry to be a downer.  :(  It was easy to make though!  Served over rice.

This is really good and VERY easy compared to my gumbo recipe.  Couple of things - make sure you get quality andouille sausage - makes a big difference.  Also,  I add chicken stock as needed as the stew gets too thick for me.  This also makes it serve more people!

My family and I had never tried any cajun food before. We loved this recipe and I have made it quite a few times. There have been a few things I have changed about this. The first time I made it I used the amout of cajun seasoning it called for and it was to spicy for my four kids so I used half as much the next time. I have also had to substite andouille sausage for smoked sausage one of the times I have made this and found it was really good either way.

Very good.  however make sure that the Cajun seasoning is salt-free if you want to follow this recipe exactly, otherwise it will be way too salty.  I just used a teaspoon of salted Cajun seasoning that worked perfectly, no need for any added salt.

Very Good. My 3 year old loved it. Will make again but add extra cajun and salt to the adult servings  (hubby thought it was slightly bland)

Great tasting! I made it a touch  healthier by using 1 Tbs Olive oil and turkey sausage. I left out the salt and used fire roasted diced tomato.  We will make this one again and again! Thanks.

I made this several times, since I had some cajun seasoning to use up. I made it pretty much as is. But I thought the "2 teaspoons salt" was too much, so I omitted it from subsequent batches. I'd never bought andouille, but managed to find it at my supermarket. One quibble is that the quartered sausages seemed too big to me; I would prefer them sliced smaller. But in general, this was a tasty, varied dish, which I enjoyed a lot.

Great recipe! My husband loved it and he's such a picky eater. Only changes where I added 2 chopped celery stocks and sauted them with the onion and bell pepper. I also omitted the sausage but it still had great flavor.  Will definitely at this to my list or recipes!!

This was fabulous!  I used what I had which was frozen chopped onions and frozen green peppers and frozen cooked deveined shrimp. I had no okra so diced-yes fresh celery-about two stalks.  My seasonnong was tony c's and a bit to much salt for my taste but so good. Next time I will use 1 or less tbs.  This was fast and easy especially if you only used fresh frozen prepped vegies.  Was loved by all and no leftovers. Bummer for todays lunch.

This is actually a good substitute for "real" gumbo.  I thought it had good flavor.  I added some celery, about half cup of Clamato juice and served over brown rice.

I loved this recipe.  It is so easy to make and taste great.  I decided to reduce the amount of sausage and increase the amount of orka.   It still came out wonderful.

Perfect recipe. I wondered rather or not to drain the cans of tomatoes, so instead of draining both I just drained one. And it was perfect :) My hubby loved it.

Our garden is over-producing okra this summer, so I have been trying new recipes. I wanted to make this meatless for Friday meals so I eliminated the sausage. I also added Garlic and used Rotel for the tomatoes. I only used 1 can of Rotel because it would have been too soupy.

I've made this recipe several times. I use salted butter to saute my veggies, and I add celery to it. Sometimes I add chicken, but I cook it first. I will also add a can of rotel, depending on who I'm cooking for. It is always a hit with my coworkers!!

I didn't use any oil because the fat from the sausage is enough. I used beef sausage, but deer sausage would be even better. Also, I added garlic. It turned out great and doesn't take long at all to cook.

This turned out phenomenal! Tasted just like I remember as a kid. This was actually my favorite of all the things my mom cooked for dinner.  I did not add any meat as I'll add a meat serving to the serving I eat in order to have flexibility .  My only alterations were adding celery with the bell peppers and onion as suggested by other raters and instead of 2 cans of dIced tomatoes I used one with 2 cans of 8oz tomatoes sauce.  I also did not have time for okra to thaw but it still came out great. Will definitely be making this again and again.

Dear wife and I made this just the other day. We used our frozen tomatoes and okra we had in the freezer. Added what ingredients that was needed and we're both happy the way it turned out. We'll be making this again real soon. We both love the taste of extra shrimp and sausage in our gumbo.

I rated this based on the original recipe not the version I made with other ingredients. The only thing I added were two cans of regular Rotel but won't do that when I make it again. I may add one, but not two. I also will use 3 cans of diced tomatoes. Two cans just weren't enough. I will also skip the salt or just use half. It was way too salty for me. I also used fresh okra but will try frozen next time. Fresh okra lengthened the cooking time quite a bit.

We love this! Changes we made, used 2 Rotel with green chilies and 1 Rotel with habanero (10 Oz cans). So no cajun seasoning needed. Also added scallops and garlic. Nice heat and flavor!

Very simple and turned out great. Adding to the rotation. Added minced garlic and celery. Used 1 can of rotel tomatoes and 1 can of regular tomotoes for extra spice. Needed the salt because my cajun seasoning didn't contain salt.
