This was really yummy, in fact I had my brother who is skeptical of everything try it, and even he said it wasn't bad, which is huge. But it's very rich and sweet, and calorie wise, it's certainly not something I would drink very often

This is a delicious treat for a Potter fan.  However, omit the white sugar.  It is far sweet enough with the honey, butterscotch and hot chocolate powder.

This was delicious!!!  I loved it!  I thought that the sugar was fine, and I would keep it in the recipe.  I don't think that I used as much honey though, and I used brown sugar.  It was amazing!  It tasted exactly like I imagined butterbeer, but it didn't look the same.  It looked like chocolate milk.  I will have to experiment with the look.  Other than that, it was amazing!

This was pretty yummy. A little sweet for my hubby's liking so maybe next time I would try a little less hot chocolate powder.  It was a nice change for kids from the regular hot chocolate drink.

The chocolate overpowers everything, so I can't taste any of the other flavors.  It just tastes like cocoa.

It tastes good, but it tastes like hot horchata more than what I imagine butterbeer would taste like. It also looks milky and not clear and orange. While it might taste good, it doesnâ€™t look like the picture nor does it taste like what I imagined butterbeer to taste like.

Agree w others: doesn't need the white sugar. I used agave instead of honey. This was delicious. Serving size is quite large.
