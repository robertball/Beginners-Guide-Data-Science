These are a favorite in my house after St. Patty's Day. I usually use corn tortillas and add mashed spuds if they are around. Top with tangy sharp shredded cheddar cheese and these are Great!! The combo of coleslaw and corned beef reminds me of NY deli sammies, OH YUMMO. Thank You PacNWCook. Got a good one here:)

I used this recipie for fish tacos instead and they were so delicious! The sauce added just the right touch to my tilipia and worked wonderfully with the coleslaw!!

I questioned this recipe because the sauce contains a lot of plain yogurt. I hate plain yogurt-it's bitter.  Even before I put the tacos together I was still skeptical because when I sampled the sauce, bitter, plain yogurt was all I could taste.  BUT THEN...I put it all together and YUMMO!!  Delicious--I used the coleslaw dressing recipe from "Simple Coleslaw" on this site too!  Oh, and it does make a lot more yogurt sauce then you would probably ever use

These were really good. I haven't tried anything outside the traditional taco, but I really loved the flavors and how they came together. My husband was scheptical until he tasted them. Then he asked me to put the recipe in my regular rotation. Thanks!

Yum, Yum, Yum  ~ My family and my parents really enjoyed this new twist on tacos.  To save time, I cooked the corned beef in the crock-pot all day and then shredded the meat before serving.  We liked the combination of the yogurt sauce and the coleslaw.  This makes way more yogurt sauce than what is needed for the recipe. I easily had enough of the sauce leftover that I could have used it for the slaw dressing instead of regular slaw dressing. I am going to do that the next time I make this recipe.  I also added about a teaspoon of cayenne pepper as a dash was not even noticeable.    I warmed the tortillas on a griddle so that I could heat more than one at a time.  This recipe is repeat worthy - and I tried it just in time to stock up on corned beef that will soon be on sale for St. Patrick's Day.

Loved this! We're not crazy about cilantro so I went easy on it and plain yogurt is not something I seek out, but I took the word of other reviewers and went for it. I may cook another corned beef just so we can use up the rest of the sauce (it does make a lot)! Thanks for the recipe.

Very good flavor combinations--a great way for our Irish family to celebrate the St. Patty's holiday, and we enjoyed them a lot. Based on other reviews, we added some mashed potatoes, which was good, but would I would have enjoyed them the same without the spuds. I wish corned beef wasn't so pricey--we would make these a lot more often.

I made these for my mom for her birthday (her family is Irish). We were a little nervous but the combination was amazing! Similar to fish tacos. We used corn tortillas and heated them slightly in a frying pan. I went easy on the coleslaw sauce since there was an additional sauce but these were amazing. Thank you for a great unique recipe!

I can see the potential here, but the canned corned beef was a letdown. I'll try better meat next time

This is my families favorite meal.  I use the restaraunt style cole slaw recipe in here and have tried multiple corned beef recipes from here (haven’t found one to be that much better than another yet, all decently good). If I forget to buy plain yogurt, I’ll just use sour cream instead.  I’ll also use both regular flour and corn tortillas.

I am so ECSTATIC to have found this recipe, which I have been looking for for a number of years!! I had my first Corn Beef Taco in an Irish Pub, years ago in Southern California, & not only were they $1 tacos but they were the best tacos I had ever had! This recipe is almost exactly like what I tasted & determined that's what was in those very tacos. So excited to make these tomorrow, it is after all St. Patrick's Day today, I have my 2nd (in 2 days) braised corn beef (that recipe is on here as well & THE BEST corn beef I have EVER made/tasted & I will never go back to boiling my corn beef ever again! By far the best I have ever eaten & my family & friends agree it is the best they have ever had, too!) in the oven now, so I was really praying to have found THIS recipe & I DID! My family & I cannot wait to have these tomorrow!! Thank YOU for sharing this & I'm hoping (by the reviews they are!!) that they are just like the Irish Pubs in So Cal! The only change I'm going to make is, like other reviews, changing the tortilla to corn tortillas, as that's how I originally had them & I, personally prefer corn vs flour, especially with these particular tacos. Thank YOU for sharing THIS AMAZING, DELICIOUS, one of a kind recipe!! Counting down until tomorrow's supper...we might just have to have them for lunch instead, I can't wait until supper tomorrow to have these! Thank you! Thank you! I will write a review after I make these as well, so excited!! Made my St. Patty's Day!!

Wonderful take!
We mexicans make tacos out of almost every ingredient in everyday life, so this recipe is perfect "taco-sophy"!

Made this for a potluck at work.  Took an electric griddle to warm the meat and shells for people.  Was a huge hit!
