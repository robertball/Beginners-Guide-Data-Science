This is an awesome recipe!  I followed the advice of others and started with olive oil, onion and garlic.  I then threw in a can of tomatoes with chopped jalopeno's, a can of black beans and a can of corn.  The soup is wonderful.  My sister thought it was fabulous and my coworkers wanted the recipe.  Will definitely be making this often.

This soup is excellent.  You can use leftover turkey or chicken.  I fry the tortilla strips and place them on top of the soup to give it an extra crunch.

I tried this recipe with my leftover Christmas Turkey.  Everyone fell in love with this soup even those who don't care for spicy foods!  I had so many requests that I had to make it again for New Years Eve.  This recipe will definitely be added to my families Holiday Favorites cookbook.

I just made this soup and am eating it as I write this review! It is really good--nice and spicey.  I did make a few changes... I left out the half & half to save on calories.  I then added another can of chicken broth, a small can of green chilis & frozen corn.  The soup was plenty thick with the corn tortillas.  Oh, I also added the jalapenos and cup of tomatoes to the mix, rather than adding it after serving.  Great use of leftover turkey!  UPDATE: 11/30/2008.  I made this soup again tonight (Thanksgiving leftovers again!).  I added an entire box of chicken broth, one diced jalapeno, and a can of rotel tomatoes, and left out the half and half.  I also added a cup of frozen corn.  We topped with sour cream, shredded cheese, and avocado slices.   I'm pretty sure the corn tortillas are supposed to be mushy, otherwise the recipe would have you add them just before serving. They serve to thicken the soup and add flavor.  My husband and 7 year old had seconds--they love it!

this receipe was so timely, right after the Thanksgiving celebration.  I added a number of ingredients that I thought really added to the flavor. Simmered turkey bones w/generous chunks of meat with the enchilda sauce. Meanwhile, saute 1 onion, 4 garlic cloves, 1/2 c chopped celery, 1 red pepper, then added to the broth. Add 1 c. frozen corn; salt & pepper to taste. Heat then add half n-half & 1/2 c. sour cream; heat slightly. Right before serving, add 2 minced cloves garlic, chopped cilantro & chopped green onion.

My tortilla pieces got soggy. Something was definitely missing. I didn't like it but my husband did.  He'll eat anything though.

This was a great recipe. I sauted about 1 cup of onions with a clove of garlic before I added the chicken broth and tortillas. I only used about 8 tortillas, but they do dissolve into the soup. I used two cans of broth and added one can of green chilis. I also added 1 cup fat free half and half which gave it a weird apperance but helped cool the heat. A good recipe, I would probably make this again using chicken. Great way to cleanse the palate after thanksgiving and use up leftovers.

I was a little leary about how the tortillas work/hold up in this soup, but I followed the recipe and found out that this was great.  The thickness that the tortillas gave made it a heartier soup and the flavor was awesome.  In place of the chicken broth,  I boiled my turkey carcas.  Worked great.  Wasn't sure my husband would like this, so, since I had so much leftover broth from the carcas, I made a turkey vegetable soup as well and served both.  This soup was the clear winner.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Really, really, really good soup!  I embellish the flavor with chopped celery and corn - yum!  I also add shredded cheddar cheese to the bottom of each bowl before filling!  Good stuff!

This was very tasty, perfect for a blustery day! I made just a few adjustments, I sauteed a small handful of minced onion, the jalapeno and the cumin together in a little olive oil to soften, then added the broth, I used 3 cans of it. Threw in some corn suggested by another reviewer, along with more cumin. I only put two of the tortillas in the soup. The remaining strips I crisped in a 400* oven and served them on top with the cheese. Cornbread on the side. We ALL enjoyed it, 16yo son couldn't get enough of it and my 8yo daughter had a second helping. That makes this recipe truely worthy of 5 stars!!

This was a nice thick soup.  I followed other reviews and used a whole box of chicken broth with the 12 corn tortillas, a 10 oz. can of each enchilada sauce, sauted onion & 3 large garlic cloves in olive oil before adding broth, used whole milk rather than H&H, added 2 cans of Rotel tomatoes, 1 can of black beans and some frozen corn.  Since by mistake I picked up one HOT Rotel Can rather than the Original it was a bit spicy for us.  I toned it down as another review said with 1 cup of sour cream.  May keep that in next time anyway.  Thanks to other reviewers for these interesting tweaks.  I will make this again.  UPDATE: This just tastes better every day.  I think I'll leave in the one can of Hot Rotel and one Original next time plus the 1 cup of sour cream.  Hubby loves it too.

Loved it! Did what the others suggested and added a drained can of corn and black beans. I also started the mixture with sauteeing onion and garlic in olive oil. Also, instead of a chopped tomato, I just added a can of diced tomatoes. I also didn't use the corn tortillas because I didn't have any. I just added some tortilla chips at the end. Definitely a keeper

This soup was AWESOME. Warning: it is very thick so if you are expecting El Pollo Loco style this is definitely not it. I took others' advice and sauteed onion with garlic in olive oil prior to adding the ingredients and it turned out perfect. I also added a can of corn and one of black beans to make it sheer perfection. I also sliced 4 tortillas super thin then fried in olive oil for the top. The only thing I missed was cilantro but I'll have it next time! My super picky bf loved it and so did my family! Thanks for sharing and this is now in my perma-rotation!

The original recipe may be fine but I incorporated many of the changes in the reviews and it was wonderful. I sauteed onions and garlic and added it to the turkey and chicken broth with a can of drained corn, a can of Rotel tomatoes, no red enchilada sauce and about 3/4 of a bottle of Herdez  salsa verde. I only had flour torillas so I put some in the chicken broth to thicken the soup and baked the rest for a topping. I used mexican mix cheese, baked torillas and sour cream on top of the soup. It was wonderful.

I give this a 4-star because of the flavor of the soup. But I wouldn't really call it a soup soup, meaning it isn't very liquid like. It tastes so so good though and will definitely make it again. It is especially good when you add sour cream and avocado. I don't know how to make it less thick though. I'll have to play with it.

Super Easy, and super delicious.  I actually made it with ground turkey, turned out great.  I grated some garlic and onion in for more flavor when cooking the meat.  I left out the half and half too and added more stock.  I also added corn and a squeeze of lime to each bowl.  Wow, so good.  Better then restaurant style.

My family loved this dish and it has made it into our "favorites."  It is great for leftover turkey, but you could also just make it with cooked, diced chicken breast.  Here are a few changes I made.  I used whole milk instead of cream to cut down a bit on calories.  I also added jalapeno, cilantro, and 2 minced garlic cloves to it while cooking, and added fresh-squeezed lime juice into the bowls just before serving.

We too, thought the flavor was great, but too hot and fatening.  Next time I'd probably use only mild green/red sauce, cut back on cheese, and use only 2% or whole milk in place of half/half.  It really did taste very good!

I started this very close to the recipe using only red enchilada sauce because I didn't have any green and omitting the cumin (don't care for it--used smoked paprika instead)and using cream instead of half and half (1/2 cup instead of full cup).  But the flavor just wasn't there for me.  I sauteed onions and garlic and added those. Still needed something, so I added part of a jar of homemade salsa, a bit of Velveeta cheese I had leftover from dip made over the holiday, and I dumped in some frozen corn and drained and rinsed pink beans. Tasted then added a couple tablespoons of pureed chipotles in adobo sauce. It's better, but it still seems to be missing something for our tastes.  I may try again using green sauce and keeping the onions and garlic, too.  Great way to use leftover turkey, though!

Yummy! I added 1 can drained corn and one can drained black beans and cooked until heated. I had a little topping bar of 1/2 strips of crispy tortilla (cut and fried them), cheddar cheese, avocado, sour cream. Delicious! In fact I ate left overs all week!

This soup was awesome! We are from the southwest and like the spicey, wife liked even more than I did, If that's possible. Can't wait to try this with other types of meat/spices.

This has excellent flavor!  But I think you are supposed to use crispy tortillas, I used the soft corn ones, and it came out kinda mushy.  My mistake though, it still tasted wonderful!

Like others, I modified this recipe a bit (even though I know it's best to prepare acc to directions the first time). I added sauteed onion and doubled the chicken broth and enchilada sauces. I added 2 cans of Rotel tomatoes and a can each of black beans and shoepeg corn. I, too, used 1% milk instead of half and half. My husband really likes this soup, though it's more stew-like in consistency. Next time I'll add less tortillas and one can of diced tomatoes and a single can of Rotel tomatoes.  So that means that I'm definitely preparing it again...probably next Thanksgiving! :)

This was terrible! The tortillas turned into an unappetizing mush. I strained the broth and tried to continue by doctoring the remains. The soup is a good idea, but his recipe needs major revisions!

I thought this recipe was wonderful!  It was very easy to make.  Great way to get rid of the leftover turkey or chicken.  I followed the advice from one of the reviews and fried up some tortilla strips (great idea).  My younger sister loved it and she is a picky eater.  I will keep this recipe handy.

Made this soup with a few adjustments.  I only had red enchilada sauce, so I used 2 cans of that.   I also didn't have any corn tortillas, so I omitted that and served it with tortilla chips on the top.  I also added a can of corn and diced tomatoes.  Turned out wonderful, even with all my substitutions. What a great way to use up leftover Turkey.  Thanks for the recipe.

My family loved this soup- a great way to use leftover turkey. I added more chicken broth & half & half as it was a little too spicy for me. I also topped with sour cream, shredded cheese & avocado- yummy!

I made this with some leftover turkey from Thanksgiving. I did tweak it a bit by first sauteing 1/2 cup chopped onion and 4 celery stalks in olive oil. I then added the chopped turkey and browned it a bit before adding the chicken broth and cream. I doubled the green enchilada sauce and omitted the red enchilada sauce. My family loved this topped with salsa, tortilla chips, shredded Monterrey jack and sour cream. Yum!

A staple in our home in cold weather.  We probably shred the chicken just before we eat, and it is fine.  I love it as a crock pot recipe that cooks away while I am at work!

This recipe is excellent and easy to make.  I made the soup and it was really really good.  I substituted the turkey for chicken.  The first time I made it - I made just enough for me and the hubby and had the leftovers the next day.  The second time I made it I doubled the recipe and my daughter happened to come over and she loved it so much she took some for lunch and some to her husband.  She must have told her sister because her sister told me "Mom I heard you made a bomb tortilla soup" I said yeah I did I'll have to make it for you one day.  Actually thinking about making it over the weekend since its going to be cold out.

I sauteed onion, garlic and a can of green chilies. Then added it with the turkey. I used two cans of green sauce and one can of red. It's very spicy. Next time I will cut the red sauce to half a can. It's excellent soup an fast to make.

A tasty recipe that is quick & easy to prepare after spending the day cooking for Thanksgiving.  I added diced tomatoes, diced green chilies and corn as others had.  It then makes about 8 servings.

Great tasting!  I hate turkey leftovers, but I love tortilla soup, so this recipe came in handy.  I followed other advice and did not add tortilla strips to the broth.  Instead, I baked some tostada shells, and then broke them up into bits and added them at the very end when I was about to serve the soup.

I thought this recipe was great!  The only change I made was to substitute whole milk for half and half.  The sliced tortilla strips were kind of like noodles in the soup.  Delicious!  The only thing I might add next time might be corn and black beans.

Very Good, I accidentally added the jalapeno in the soup while cooking it, instead of as a topping and it made it very spicy, but still good. I also added some Tostitos chips last, because my family doesn't like them soggy.

This is a great alternative to the typical turkey and rice soup (which my husband is not thrilled with) that most people make after a big turkey dinner. I baked the strips of corn tortillas until they were crispy and added some cayenne because my family likes it hot. I also used a crockpot so it could cook all day and the turkey could really soak up the flavor. Got a thumbs up from the family and I will definitely make this with chicken when I just feel like some tortilla soup this winter.

I wish we could have had this instead of turkey on Thanksgiving.
But then I did get to look forward to making this with the leftovers. 
I just threw some tortilla chips I had which were fresh made at a restaurant into it instead of the strips at the beginning.  I also tossed in some garlic and a can of black beans.
It was delicious!  My favorite way to eat turkey :-)

I used this to use up leftover thanksgiving turkey that I had chopped thin. Very spicy and creamy. The baste I had used on my thanksgiving turkey was a bit off flavor wise for this recipe, but I'm sure it would be great with a more "neutral" turkey seasoning.

I think this is my best After-Thanksgiving turkey repurpose to date! Amazing! Made a feww changes based on other reviews ( onions, garlic, etc) I also cooked with a can of Fire Roasted tomatoes which added a great smoky flavor. Will definitely make again!

My husband and I did not care for this soup at all.  I thought the enchilada sauce would give a nice kick to a tomato based soup, but instead it just tasted like enchilada sauce.
