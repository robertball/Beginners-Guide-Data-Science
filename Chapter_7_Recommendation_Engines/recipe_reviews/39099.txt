A very good pumpkin cookie!  I modified the recipe a little.  First, I used more brown sugar; 2/3 cup brown, 1/3 white.   I also used walnuts instead of macadamia.  I made this with white chips and with butterscotch.  Both delicious, but the color of the butterscotch and the cookie almost match, and they are more fall festive.  These cookies have an almost cake-like consistency, so for chewier ones I slighty undercook them, although undercook may be too strong a term.  Instead of taking them out when the edges are turning brown, I took them out when the edges were just starting to think about turning brown-if that makes any sense!  Maybe 2-3 minutes off the normal baking time.
Very tasty either way.

We Loved these cookies.  I took fifthteen of them to work and they were all gobbled up.  I used chocolate covered Mac Nuts and added 1/2 cup of milk and 2 cups of old fashioned uncooked oatmeal.  These were very hearty and moist, a definite keeper!

This is a great recipe.  It's easy and delicious.  Make sure not to overcook!!  I followed the recipe as to the amounts of white chocolate chips and nuts, but next time I'm going to add less chips and more nuts.  It wasn't very balanced.  Overall, these cookies are fabulous.

These are the BEST cookies I have EVER made!! I followed the recipe to the letter and they couldn't be more perfect.  My husband enjoyed them so much he asked me to make another batch (which he kept all to himself)!!

I had to give this recipe out so-o-o many times.  Some people that loved these don't even like pumpkin!  This was very easy and a great cookie for the Holidays.

This recipe turned out pretty good. I substituted chocolate chips and pecans because that is what I had on-hand. The end result looked like cookies but tasted more like muffins, consistency-wise. I used slightly more pumpkin than the recipe called for and did not have any problems with the dough being too wet or with the finished cookies crumbling at all.

Tasted fine but came out very crumbly!  Also, the presentation wasn't that great.   Maybe something was incorrect about the amount of pumpkin or flour?

WOW! These cookies were fantastic!  I omitted the white chips and nuts 
and replaced it with butterscotch chips that I melted and just drizzled on top 
of the cookies when they cooled.My husband doesn't eat many sweets and 
he raved about these cookies.

These cookies are delicious! The dough is very wet, so I didn't attempt to flatten them with a glass. I just pressed them down slightly and sprinkled them with sugar.

I made these cookies for a little variety in my usual christmas cookie baking. The taste was good, but the dough was gooey and hard to work with.

I wasn't crazy about these - I much prefer the Iced Pumpkin Cookies (another recipe from this site).  However, lots of people who tried them liked them (and some preferred them to the iced ones!).  I found the dough difficult to work with - the chips and nuts kept falling out as I was dropping spoonfuls into the cookie sheets.

A great change of pace from the usual pumpkin and chocolate chip cookies.  The macadamia nuts add a delicious "surprise crunch".  Very yummy.

My favorite cookie of all time...I've been making these for years.  I do make some slight modifications.  Substitute cardamom for cinnamon, and toasted chopped walnuts for the macadamia nuts.  U also chop up Ghirardelli white chocolate baking bars instead of using white chocolate chips -- it's much better than the chips.  Delish!

These are an excellent use of pumpkin! I used toasted walnuts when I tried them two weeks ago. I made them the same way again today. I'm taking them to my MIL's for a Thanksgiving dessert. I'm sure they'll be a hit!

This recipe was a hit both at home and at work.  I made it for halloween and my kids have insisted I make twice more since then.  I changed nothing in the recipe and they came out soft and tasty.

Wow! These cookies were wonderful. I doubled the recipe and followed it exactly and they turned out perfect. My whole family couldn't stay out of them.  I will most definitly be making them again.

These were very good!  Needed to add about a cup of flour to make the batter stiff enough so they would not spread.

These were OK. I found it a little too sugary sweet for my tastes, but not a bad recipe. Perhaps next time I will use less sugar since the white chocolate adds so much sweetness.

These were very easy to make and very popular at my cookie exchange.  I usually like to "tamper" a little with recipies after I make them once, but I never change a thing on this one.  It is a classic keeper in my cookie file!

These cookies are delicious....Have made them twice. The first time I used peanut butter chips and the second time the vanilla chips. The amount was just right with the peanut butter, but seemed too much with the vanilla. They are very crumbly though and I am not sure how to correct that. Because of this the presentation is poor and I only make them for us to eat at home. If anyone has any ideas on how to correct the crumbly texture (they literally break apart in your hands when you bite into them) please help! Still a very yummy cookie!

These were very good.  Rather than using wheat flour I used a 1:1 combination of white rice and potato flours.  The cookies didn't last too long.

Very yummy cookie! I refrigerated the dough before baking because the dough is so soft. I made these with walnuts instead of macadamia nuts and they turned out great. Taste like pumpkin pie!

These cookies taste wonderful, but I had the same problem some others did with the cookies not holding together as they bake. I tried adding more flour, but that just gave them a more cake-like consistency. They definitely didn't turn out looking like the picture!
