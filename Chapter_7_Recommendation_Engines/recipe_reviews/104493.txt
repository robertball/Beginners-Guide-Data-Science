The directions should read *make a criss-cross cut at the opposite end (not the stem end) & gently fan out a bit*...this creates a pocket for the cream cheese filling. Be prepared to ruin a strawberry or two...some just don't want to fan out. But you can always use those in another dish or do as I do & pop the uncooperative ones in your mouth. That'll teach 'em!!! ;o)

I am giving this 5 stars but I think that was due to the fact that I dipped the stuffed strawberries in chocolate(just melted choc semi sweet morsels with a dab of veg oil).  Ohh my how good they were and how people raved about them.  The filling itself I used only 1 tbsp grand marnier liqueur and found it waaaay to overpowering so I added in a little extra sugar, and a few tbsp of fluff and grated in some nice semi sweet chocolate.  That was good but next I think I'll skip the liqueur and add in some vanilla bean or almond extract.  I would only give 4 stars as is but DIPPED IN CHOCOLATE..they are fabulous.  I bet adding mini choc chips to the stuffing would be great too!  This def is a great recipe that you can experiment with.***update..I now have made with the vanilla bean and/or extract on they are TO DIE FOR!!

I think these tasted best after being refrigerated.  Instead of criss-crossing the cut on the point of the strawberry, I cut "out" a small triangle wedge before putting in the cream.  This was much easier that pulling the strawberry open to get the cream in..plus then it didn't try and squish out.  I used orange extract in place of the liqueor.

So very delicious!!! I made a few modifications. I didn't  understand how the strawberries should be cut from the directions given, so I sliced them in half and piped the cheese over them.  I used neufchatel cheese and shaved half a Hershey's extra dark almond, cranberry, and blueberry chocolate bar into the mixture.  Not having orange liqueur on hand, I replaced it with a teaspoon of vanilla extract and only used 1/4 cup of powdered sugar.  My husband absolutely loved these and said this was the best quick dessert I've ever made!  Thanks!!!

Five stars for a quick, easy, lovely and delicious dessert. I made just enough for Hubs and me and subbed Amaretto for the orange flavored liqueur, which I'm not a fan of. I made beautiful presentations on individual dessert plates, placing two each on top of baked triangles of puff pastry (Pepperidge Farm), drizzling each with some warmed ganache I had on hand in the fridge, a sprinkling of powdered sugar, a dollop of whipped cream and a sprig of fresh mint. "Gourmet" dessert in a hurry!

I make two criss cross cuts in the strawberries. It creates a better pocket for the filling. They look like pretty flowers on a platter. I make these for bridal and baby showers all the time. Simple yet elegant!

This recipe is so easy to make and tastes GREAT!  I made this for my sister's Wedding shower and everyone absolutely loved them.  What I love about it is they're so easy to make.  Just be careful not to beat the cream cheese mixture too much (just until uniform) because when piping it will not keep its shape.  Next time I think I'll add a little more Cointreau to give it more flavour.  This recipe is absolutely wonderful!!!  Thanks IMVINTAGE!!!

These were very good.  I made them to bring to a party.  It agree with other reviewers, a pastry tip would have made it easier to fill.  I used a plastic bag with an end cut off.  I topped them off with milk chocolate.  I put that in a small plastic bag too and drizzled it over the top.  They look like it took me a long time to make, but it was a quick and easy dessert.  YUM!

SOOOOOO good!  I made these for my daughter's Strawberry Shortcake themed b-day party and these were a BIG hit!  I used a little almond extract instead of orange liquor.  If you cut around the stem, you end up with a nice 'pocket' for filling.  Thanks for posting!

WOW! What a tasty treat!!! And definitely add the chocolate! However one pint of strawberries is not near enough! I was making this for a super bowl party and I used four pints of strawberries, 2 boxes of cream cheese, 1 cup of confectioners sugar, 1/4 cup milk, and added 1 tub (8 oz) of whip cream. I also used vanilla extract, 4 tbsp. The cool whip makes this more fluffy. Just a tip: Lay out your cookie sheet, cover with a sheet of wax paper, cut the fruit and fill them with the filling, then put them in the freezer while you melt your chocolate. I used two boxes of semi sweet bakers with about 2 tbsp of veg oil to melt. Also a tip for melting chocolate: in a bigger saucepan (3 qts) boil about 3 inches or so of water, then insert a smaller saucepan with the chocolate pieces. This will prevent the chocolate from burning or melting unevenly. Drizzle over the hardened strawberries with a spoon (LIGHTLY, too much chocolate takes away from the flavor of the filling) and put back in freezer for at least 30 mins. DELICIOUS!!!!!!

To those of you substituting orange extract-
Orange extract is MUCH stronger than  orange liqueur, so even halving the amount will be FAR too much! Only 1/4 of a teaspoon or even less would be needed of the orange extract! Hope this helps those of you complaining that the orange flavor is far too strong!

I like this so much, I didn't use any liquer, just put a small drip of vanilla extract, and put a bit choco powder on top for nice presentation. Love this! Pictures uploaded :)

Fabulous! I can't believe I waited this long to try them. I used vanilla in place of orange liqueur and they tasted just like cheesecake :) I levelled the bottoms of my strawberries, scooped out the middle and filled that way. I couldn't keep my 7-year old out of them. These will make regular appearances at our house this summer!

These were very good.  I used vanilla extract instead of the orange flavored liqueur.  Next time I might try the orange.  I highly advise using a clear extract if substituting because the regular brown extract will discolor the cream cheese.  Wilton makes a clear that can be found at any craft store or cake decorating supplier.  I cut my strawberries criss cross and piped in the filling which worked well.

WOW. YUMMY! The 'stuffing' that goes inside is awesome! We loved it. I used orange juice versus the liquer since I made this for my kids. I have to admit I did not have the patience to "stuff" but only a couple strawberries. I just cut up the strawberries and the kids used the 'stuffing' as a 'dip'. This is a great dip for any kind of fruit and I will be making it often.

Everyone loved these! I actually cut a small tip off the bottom of the strawberries than hulled out the top and stuffed them that way.

These turned out pretty well. They looked really nice sitting on a platter and they were gone at the end of the party. next time I will add some whipped cream to it so the filling isn't so heavy.

Stuffed strawberries are an elegant dessert and wonderful tasting. However, the amount of liqueur in this recipe is far too much in my opinion. I only added one teaspoon and that was fine before becoming bitter. If you prefer more, I suggest adding 1/2 teas. at a time until you are satisfied. Better safe than sorry.

I made these as a surprise for my son's birthday and he is over the moon!  I didn't have regular cream cheese but a container of whipped.  It worked fine.  I also added vanilla instead of liqueur and it tasted great.  Melt some chocolate chips with butter and drizzled it over the top.  They are fantastic and i will certainly be making these again and again

And the crowd went wild!!!  I made these for a wedding reception and the strawberries were the biggest hit!  Instead of slicing down to fill, I used a huller to core out the top.  I garnished with mint leaves dipped in chocolate, beautiful!!!  and delicious!

These were delicious & surprisingly simple.  I cut a double criss-cross in the tip of the strawberries (sort of like an asterick sign), and filled the strawberries, with only 1 mistake, which was promptly popped into my mouth.  I substitued 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract in place of the orange liquer, and garnished with grated Hershey's Milk Chocolate.  These were yummy, not overly sweet, and very attractive.  Only one problem, they disappear too quickly!  I made these for my sweetie for Valentine's Day, but these will probably make an appearance at various parties in the future.  I just have a feeling that these will become a Valentine's Day staple.

This is so easy and perfect for any occasion! I made a few adjustments though. Instead of cutting the bottoms, I cored the tops, which left perfect space for the filling and then people weren't left with the tops when eating them. I also used vanilla extract instead of orange liqueur. There have been a few times when I have sprinkled the top with graham cracker crumbs and it tastes just like cheesecake! I also put a blueberry on the top of each for 4th of July!

This called for orange flavored liqueur, so I used Gran Marnier which I thought overpowered the sweetened delicate cream cheese filling.  These make a very elegant presentation, and I will make again, but IMO, amaretto would be a much better choice for the liqueur.  I will start will half of what the recipe calls for, taste, and then add the rest if needed.

These are delicious and so easy to make. Be sure to read the most helpful review for proper cutting directions. I left out the liqueur and used the zest of half a lemon instead. Don't be afraid to pull the cut sections apart - I didn't lose one berry and it was very easy. The more filling you can get in there the better. The possibilities with this recipe are endless. Great ideas from lots of reviewers!

Great dessert!  Like others, I melted milk chocolate chips and drizzled over the stuffed berries.  My daughter and her fiance loved them but would not take home the leftovers (self-preservation)!  Thank you for a great recipe.

YUM! YUM! YUM! I drizzled some melted chocolate over the finished berries and it only made it better. I didn't use the liqueur but added some vanilla. A real keeper.

I make this recipe by cheating somewhat.  I use Philly's Ready Cheesecake instead of mixing it up myself.  But I've been worried about what to do if they decide to discontinue that item, so now I can use this easy recipe just in case! This is a great quick snack that my picky hubby loves.  It's like a quick bite of strawberry cheesecake.  Sometimes I dip them in chocolate, sometimes I don't.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

I THINK THE FILLING WAS AWESOME EVERYONE LOVED IT BUT THE CUTTING OF THE STRAWBERRIES WAS A BIT PUZZLING TO ME AND WHEN I FINALLY GOT IT, IT LOOKED STRANGE NOT VERY APPEALING, SO I PUT THE REST OF THE FILLING IN A BOWL, AND CUT THE TOPS OFF THE STRAWBERRIES AND PLACED IT ON A PLATE, THEY WERE A HIT. ALTHOUGH THE OTHER THING I CHANGED WAS ADDING ANOTHER HALF OF CREAM CHEESE BECAUSE I THOUGHT THE ORANGE WAS OVERPOWERING. AND SO I ADDED THE EXTRA CREAM CHEESE  TO OVER THROS THE ORANGE. BUT OVERALL THE FILLING WAS THE BOMB! Thanks Imvintage for sharing your recipe! WILL BE MAKING AGAIN!

These are so much easier to make than I imagined.  Definitely follow the intructions to make the cross cut in the strawberry.  I found these very easy to fill using a pastry bag with a large star tip.  Once the tip was down in the strawberry, all I did was squeeze and lift the bag out.  These turned out beautifully and would be an impressive addition to any table.  Plus, they taste great.  Kids enjoyed these just as well as adults.  Thanks for a great idea!

I made these for my ladies Bunco night (along with chocolate covered strawberries). Instead of 2 TBS orange flavor liqueur, I put a 1 TBS of Kahula, 1 TBS Baileys Irish Cream and 1 TBS Absolute Vodka. After stuffing the berries, I used the leftover melted chocolate from dipping the berries (placed in a baggie and snipped a very small corner off the baggie) and drizzled chocolate on top. Almost too pretty to eat and the ladies loved these!!

I love to make these for social get togethers.  I also like to change up the flavor with almond or vanilla instead of the orange liquer. They're so easy to make and they really make a nice presentation when you pipe the filling in and dust with a bit of cocoa or a sprinkle of chopped nuts.

Though I didn't eat any, I did get good reviews from my family for this treat.  The only negative I would have for it would be they get messy on the plate very quickly.  Otherwise, people ate them up and loved them.  I made with vanilla instead of liquor...this may have been a mistake (and it's why I still gave 5 star!)  They looked beautiful, as well.  (until they got messy!)  I topped with shredded chocolate bar and lots of people liked that.
Thank you for a simple, pretty presentation of sweets!

This was a really cute  clever dish.  I substituted orange extract for the liqueur beause it was all I had on hand.  I think I would have preferred a different flavor other than the orange. Maybe vanilla next time?

I added some extra confectioners sugar to sweeten them a little more for my kids and called them strawberry volcanoes to make them a fun family dessert, but a good recipe to keep for a healthy dessert.

These are so good. I made it exactly as the recipe was written and my husband compared them to heaven (my word since I can't type his). My sister told me I didn't make enough. I sprinkled them with cocoa powder to make them pretty.

Maybe I just don't have enough patience for these, but I didn't think the taste was worth all the work.  Halfway through I ended up globbing the cream cheese mix on top of the strawberries.  I did add mini chocolate chips and sprinkled with cocoa powder.

This were very good. I didnt have any or the orange liquer so I used a fill orange and it came out great. Also I cut the tops off the strawberry and carved the inside out and filled them that way. Also covered them in chocolate and it was very good and my family liked them too.

I have done this type of thing with a mixture for the filling made from one small jar of marshmallow cream and one pkg. of cream cheese.  Just whip the two together with an electric mixer, it can also be used as a fruit dip. Absolutley fabulous.

My neighbor made these once for a party, but instead of the orange liquer he used Amaretto (almond flavored liquer) which was awesome!!  They can definitely be messy but so worth it =}

I've made this recipe twice already and I love it - So easy and SO YUMMY! I didn't have the liqueur, so I used about a teaspoon of vanilla. Also, I used Neufchatel (reduced fat cream cheese) instead of full fat cream cheese. The first time I made these, I didn't have a piping bag, so I cut the corner off of a zip-lock bag and it worked well enough, but the piping bag definitely worked better.

I like the cream cheese filling flavored with 1 tsp. vanilla extract and a 1/2 tsp of almond extarct. The easiest and fastest way to remove the stem and create a small pocket for the filling is with a small melon baller. These drizzled with a little melted chocolate are extra decadent and yummy! My family loves these a parties and get-togethers!

excellent!  Used more amaretto then called for and put some chopped chocolate pieces over the top.  Took these to a potluck bbq last night and everyone raved about them.  Easily doubled the recipe and made a lot of these quick.  As long as you me the x cut into them they stuff wonderfully and didn't have to buy a pastry bag just cut the tip off of a sandwich bag and your good to go.

Everyone RAVED! They were as pretty as they were tasty! Although, I do have to say they were quite time consuming. I drizzled milk chocolate over them after they were stuffed. I cut the sugar in half and used 1 tsp. vanilla instead of the orange liquor.

I made these last night and HAD to make them again tonight because I had left over filling, and because they were just SO good! The second time I cut off the stem, cut them in half, piped the filling on top of the halves and drizzled with chocolate. We...um...kinda had them for dinner. AMAZING! (I also used white chocolate liqueur rather then orange)

Using Baileys Irish Cream instead (an entire mini bottle) to this makes it so amazing. I also love dipping it in milk chocolate and putting some white chocolate chips on the filling.

It was good. Maybe it was just me, but the whip cream kept coming out and so it didn't hold together.

I made this for a 4th of July party.  Great hit!  These were gone no time.  Everyone kept asking for recipes and what wonderful presentation.  I did slice the strawberries criss cross style as others suggested and added vanilla extract.

These were OK, but I don't think I'll make them again. We prefer plain strawberries, or strawberries with whipped cream.

I used fat free cream cheese the first time i ever made these and wasnt too thrilled about them myself but others loved them. made again for my sons birthday using neufchatel and they were a huge hit. theyre kind of a pain to stuff so i just cut both ends off, scoop out the middle and use a baby spoon to stuf the frosting into. my father in law thought these were store bought and made with regular cake frosting!

Wow! I brought this to potluck and everyone devoured it!

Very good way to prepare strawberries.  The mixture was very easy to work with to fill the strawberries.  The only thing that will make mine better is when local berries come on in Indiana - May and June.  The berries were shipped in and didn't hold a lot of flavor.  Can't wait to try these again.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I made a slight change to the recipe and used a filling of cream cheese mixed with a couple of tablespoons of powdered sugar and marshmallow fluff, then added in chopped pecans and they turned out so well! Everyone has been asking for the recipe!

oh yumm!  These were very good!  I added amaretto instead of orange liqueur.  I added a few tbs and it made my mixture a little on the thin side, so they were a little messy.  But oh well we ate them with forks and they were OH SO GOOD!  The amaretto flavor complimented the strawberries very well.  I will next time make sure to serve them right away or closer to when we will be eating them.  I made them a few hours in advance and noticed that a lot of liquid started coming out of the strawberries.  These really are addicting and since they are cute little finger foods, you will be grabbing one after another until they are all gone!  Cant wait to make again! Thanks for the recipe!

I made these for the first time yesterday and they were a big hit. After everyones recommendation to dip them in chocolate I decided to go a little further and used Godiva Chocolate Liquor in the cream cheese mix instead of the orange liquor. I found that the filling was a little too thick and difficult to pipe so I added an additional tablespoon of liquor. I had beautiful big strawberries, so I cut them in half lengthwise and scooped out the center and filled them. These will be a favorite for years!!!!!

I made these for a potluck. They were a huge hit. I made 3 dozen & they were gone in less than 30 minutes! Oh and there were less than 15 people there! They were also super quick and easy! I didn't have the orange stuff so I used homemade vanilla (YUM)! Thanks so much!

These are GONE!  Amazingly tasty.  Had to make another batch of them!  The first time I used shaved chocolate over them and almond slices.  The second time I used blueberries with them.

Wow. What a delicious dessert! I definitely need more practice piping.. and cutting strawberries for that matter. Several went into my tummy before Hun will ever see them. I substituted 1 tsp vanilla extract as recommended, as I am not of the legal age to purchase liquer (will send Hun on an errand to buy this for me later). So easy, and very delicious. 5 stars!

I've made this before but instead of orange liquer I used almond extract.  And, sometimes use marscapone in place of cream cheese.  Rather than criss-cross cut the strawberries, I trim a sliver off the peak to form a flat surface (so the berry will stand upright) and I use a melon baller to dig out the stem and center for the filling.

Easy and delicious!  I could've easily filled 2 pints of strawberries quite generously.  I used the extra filling in raspberries, and that was really tasty and cute.

I made these for my daughter's bridal shower, and they were absolutely amazing! Neither of us was keen on the orange flavoring, so I substituted vanilla instead, and also ommitted the nuts.  Tons of compliments were made, and everyone went back for 2nds, 3rds, and even more.  I made 2 large platters-full, and came home with them both empty.  Yum!

So good!  I've made some modifications on the suggestions of other reviews.  Instead of giving it an orange flavor, I add a little vanilla & almond extract to the cream cheese.  I also sprinkle graham cracker crust all over & around it.  Everyone loves it!

These were delicious! I threw in some orange zest and grated German sweet chocolate over the top. I used low fat cream cheese as it's all I had on hand. That worked well, but the next time (and there WILL be a next time!) I will refrigerate the filling before piping it into the strawberries. When the filling is room temperature, it tends to "squish" out of the berry as it's piped in. Refrigerating would allow the filling to firm up, so more filling can be piped into the berries. Yum!

This recipe was a huge hit.  I changed things up a little by cutting the stems off and piped the filling through the tops then drizzled chocolate on each strawberry.  VERY, VERY, VERY GOOD!

Ooh, these are amazing! I didn't have orange liquor so I subbed vanilla. I dipped some of them in chocolate, but honestly I prefer them plain. I'll make them again, they're an elegant treat.

These tasted great which is why I gave four stars, but the recipe really only deserves two stars because I had to modify the filling so much to make it work. I don't know how everyone else's turned out, but I followed the recipe exactly and it was WAY too runny! It was spilling out the sides of the strawberries and just making a mess. I ended up turned it into cream cheese buttercream by adding a stick of butter, 1/2 cup of shortening, and about 2 or 3 cups of powdered sugar, until it was a manageable consistancy and would hold its form. They were really pretty and very well-recieved, but the recipe needs a little work.

I have used mini marshmallows to stuff mt berries and then put them on skewers that have been loaded with green grapes. Using the berry as a flower at the end makes a great boquet which I have used as edible table decor! Great recipe-Thanks

What a beautiful presentation this dessert makes.  It’s surprisingly simple to make. It certainly is  very elegant.  That said, I am sure  I will not make the cream cheese filling  recipe again because I didn’t like the combination of the orange  w/ strawberries.  I thought it was to overpowering of a flavour. I’m thinking vanilla or almond extract would be better.  Overall, I love the idea, the presentation and the simplicity of this recipe.  I will make again.  THX

I made these for our 4th of July BBQ; I follwed the directions exactly plus sprinkled the tops with blue sprinkles (red, white, and blue...).  Silly me prepared them the night before - the next morning, the strawberries were runny and the blue sprinkles bled a bit so they didn't look as perfect as they had.  Being a perfectionist, I "conveniently forgot about them" the day of the BBQ.  Luckily, one of my "nosy" party guests found them in the fridge and brought them out - they were gone in no time (in fact, they were gone before I even realized they were set out!).  Everyone loved them and COMPLETELY forgave the drippy-ness.  My only complaint is that slicing and filling the strawberries was SLIGHTLY time consuming and messy (I had to use the sandwich bag method which was harder to work with - I think a pipette bag will help a ton).  I think these were so impressive in presentation and taste (like cheesecake) that the  prep issues are more than worth it.  Overall, I was pleased and will make these again.

I had such  hope for this recipe. It was very easy to make and they were really pretty. I followed the recipe exactly but to me the powdered sugar taste was too prominent. I took it to my parent's house and my mom loved them.  I may try again with less sugar.

AWESOME!!! I LOVED IT and so did everybody else! I hosted a party and people asked where I got this recipe from. If you like chocolate covered  strawberries, then dipping the strawberries in chocolate definitly makes it nice, and definitly more sweeter. I could have it both ways personally. But I served them dipped in chocolate this time, and I just loved it! I didn't have anything to squeeze the sauce out of so I just served it beside the strawberries with a spoon. The sauce itself, is magnificent! It's perfect in sweetness. I loved the Grand Marnier (Triple Orange) taste. I also added a pinch of Almond extract and a pinch of Vanilla. I WILL DEFINITLY be making this again! Thanks! : )

This recipe needed a quart of strawberries to use all of the stuffing. It looked so nice, but the flavor was just ok. I think it would taste better with cream cheese and marshmallow cream.Will be making again my own way.

I found out my jar of powdered sugar was actually cornstarch (good thing I tasted it first) so I improvised. I mixed table sugar with just enough milk to dissolve it and then mixed that into the cream cheese. It worked like a charm. I made a few plain ones and a few dipped in chocolate. While I enjoyed both, the chocolate dipped were truly outstanding. I used a good dark semi-sweet and they came out fabulous.

These were good, but I would not be raving about them.  A good recipe for using fresh strawberries though, and relatively easy.

I used Triple Sec Orange liquor, and took the suggestions of melting the chocolate chips to dip them in. I made some without the chocolate and some with, and everybody agreed the chocolate dipped wins! Reminds me of those chocolate covered cherries, only way better.

Five stars for creativity! Super fast & easy to make (once I put away the knife & grabbed my small melon baller). The filling needed more sugar for my taste. I couldn't wait to play with the recipe. Last night I made again adding ingredients to make more of a traditional no-bake cheesecake for the filling. I added more sugar, a couple scoops of cool whip, some melted feta cheese and some graham cracker crumbs.  I couldn't stop eating the filling it was so good! At the end I added cocoa powder to make chocolate cheesecake. These were amazing too! Topped them with graham cracker crumbs and oreo crumbs for the Chocolate ones. These would be fun to make with the kids for Valentines  Day and let them play around with the ingredients. Thanks for the great idea!

I made these for a summer birthday pool party. I actually added a little more of the liqueur, as it was a 21 and over party :) Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. They were really refreshing, and I didn't have any left after the party, so everyone must have liked them. I discovered that putting them in the freezer made them extra good!

I made these for Valentines Day Dessert. I sampled a few as I made them the night before. They are DIVINE!! Truly a unique nd delicious dessert!  
  I followed the directions at first, I didn't like the way the cream cheese filling turned out-I felt it should have been a little stiffer. I also didn't like the flavor either so,I tweaked the recipe a little. I gave it 5 stars simply for the idea alone.- Who never thought of stuffing a strawberry before?
   I added 2 Tbsp softened botter beat til fluffy added 8 oz softened Cream Cheese to the butter creamed together til light and fluffy added 3 tsp Vanilla and 2 C Confectioners sugar.
  I didn't cut  an X into the strawberry. I cut a thin slice off the top and bottom  then cut the white ceter out.

*** Npte- If wanting to coat strawberry in choclate freeze them first after slicing tiop and bttom off. It works so mmuch better this way then dip nto Chocolate. Throw back into freezer for 15-20 minute and fill with Cream Cheese mixture. I also sprinkled the tops with Red sugar crystals,It's so pretty, gave it a much needed d OOOMPH! Very professional looking no one would guess you made these yourself.
  I definitely will be making these again. It's a great idea for Christmas treat table too!

Such a good idea!!! I almost enjoyed it more without the liqueur, but then again I haven't acquired the taste for it yet! I also decorated the plate and strawberries with pieces of Lindt Orange, Dark Chocolate. So much fun to make!

I've made these several times now, and they are excellent and always a HUGE hit!  I cut out the stems which leaves a little hole, then use a baby spoon to spoon the filling inside.  Note, this recipe is a little time consuming, so if I'm in a hurry, I don't stuff them and just let people dip the strawberries themselves.  Rave hit either way!

The EASIEST way to add the filling is to cut off the top with the stem and use the small end of a melon scooper to take out the middle!  Then use whatever to fill the strawberry!  Super easy great presentation!

Served these atop Rocky Road ice cream with a little shaved chocolate on top. I didn't have orange liqueur so I had to sub vanilla extract which was still delicious. Everybody commented how professional these looked when served :) I only messed up one strawberry and that was slightly on purpose ;) it just looked so good.

Made these this morning.  Very easy once you get the hang of it.  I did the recipe as is except added vaanilla (don't add the full 2Tb. I would add 1/12 Tbl) I because kids were going to eat them and also added mini chips.  If you add the chips don't try to use a star tip as the get stuck.  I just used a plain piping bag and cut the end off.  Be sure to spread the strawberries apart so you can get down inside.  I tried them and they were good.

I made a few changes that made it easier to stuff. I cored the strawberry and cut the tip off so it would stand up opposite of the photo. I used Chambord liqueur with the cream cheese and confectioners suger. They were a big hit!

I used a vanilla extract with a touch of orange extract b/c that is what I had on hand.  I found it hard to get the cream into the strawberries while still looking nice.  Anyway, they were good but not outstanding.  Not sure I will ever make these again.

Made these for a barbeque and everyone loved them. I made some with cointreau and some with vanilla extract. At the end of the party, only a few were left, and it appeared both were enjoyed. I also took both dark and white chocolate, melted it with a little vegetable oil (about one tsp. oil to two squares white, and two tsp. oil to a 5 oz. bar of dark chocolate) and drizzled it over the top. I got the huge strawberries, and cut a criss cross and stuffed as directed, then drizzled both chocolates on top, waiting just a little between the two types of chocolate. DELICIOUS!

I didn't have Orange flavoring so I had to use vanilla. I also did as some recommended and shredded up some chocolate and sprinkled it all over the top.  These went really fast!  If you make these make twice as much as you think you will need!  I also used Low Fat cream cheese and it was still tasty.

Awesome recipe that adds fanciness to any meal or event.    I added almond extract as I did not have the orange on hand and hope to try that next time and I added chocolate on top.   Yummy yummy!!!!   My guests at the shower loved this.

Delish! I made these for a Bunco night that I was hosting at my house for 12 ladies and they were a HUGE hit! They were easier to stuff then expected! I had a pampered chef gun with attachments for filling and they turned out great with doing the criss cross cut on the strawberry. I also used Watkins Brand vanilla extract since I sell Watkins and it was heaven! So good, thanks for the recipe!!!

How can you go wrong with strawberries and this filling!  Brought these to a summer party and everyone loved them.  I didn't have orange liquor so I used 1 tbl vanilla instead.  I also sprinkled the tops with grated chocolate.  YUM!

honestly, i was not that impressed with these. i think i may have had a bad batch of berries. they were really watery and i just did not care for the flavor of the berry or the stuffing. i will try this recipe again though and see if i get better results. it is too cute to give up on!  : )

Tasty! I put a little more than 1/2 cup confectioners sugar, and I used orange extract instead of the liqueur. I cut a criss-cross on the point of the strawberries as others had suggested.

AMAZING!!!!  These turned out so fabulous.  I didn't use a liqueur, just a teaspoon or so of vanilla extract.  And instead of cutting the tip and stuffing the berry that way, I hulled out the back where the stem is and then leveled the tip so it had a place to sit flat.  Then I filled them up, put some gratted semi sweet chocolate over the top....my husband's eye's rolled back in extacy.  :-D

I made this for my 4yr olds pre-school class.  I didn't have the Liqueur so I used Vanilla instead(to taste maybe 1tbs). I cut the stem off and stuffed them from this side.  The kids loved them what few was left went to the teachers lounge.  I got rave reviews.  simple and tasty works for me.

Oh WOW these are awesome. I blended the cream cheese with the triple sec and started adding sugar: I tried it after ~1/2 cup and it was heavenly, but feeling decadent I added a closer to 3/4 cup and a shameful amount of mini chocolate chips. Each bite tasted like a chocolate chip cheesecake topped with strawberries, DELICIOUS, thank you so much for sharing!

AMAZING!  I used 99 oranges for the liqueur (just 2 tsps, that stuff packs a punch) and added semisweet chocolate chips to the mixture.  Chocolate, oranges and strawberries, a great flavor combo.

This was a party hit! Within 10 minutes of my arrival, all 40 of my strawberries were gone! Instead of orange liqueur, I used a 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla extract. I also grated ghirardelli chocolate on top. The best words I heard to describe them is that they looked "gourmet".

I didn't have any Grand Marnier on hand so I zested 1 lime and added its juice to the mixture and my friends LOVED it.

Just wonderful for spring!  I made 3 adjustments - used 1 drop orange oil - made chocolate cups with balloons dipped in melted chocolate - added a whole berry for fun.

These are a great, easy summer treat!  The only ingredient I changed was the orange liqueur.  I used 1 Tbl. vanilla instead and then drizzled melted chocolate over the tops.  Perfection!

These tasted good, I refrigerated the filling, it was still too runny, I added lots of extra powdered sugar, still runny, refrigerated after stuffing, still runny, I Don't know, but they still tasted good.  I even tried dipping in chocolate as others had stated, however, with the stuffing squishing out, just made a mess.  We still ate, them, but they weren't too pretty.

I made these for our Mother's Day Brunch & they were delicious. I had no problem filling the strawberries...just put in a plastic bag & cut the corner of one end off & piped them in. The only substitution I made was to use almond extract instead of the liquer because I that was all I had on hand. These were definitely a crowd pleaser & will be making them again!

These are VERY easy to make and are so beautiful--in addition to tasty! It does help to firm up the filling in the refrigerator prior to stuffing the strawberries.  Also I cut the strawberries X style so you can see more filling, but it's up to you.  As you can see by other reviews the possibilities are endless.

I had to come back and add another review.  This time I made them with the almond extract and all I can say is fantastic.  I couldn't make them fast enough everyone was gobbling them up.  I made these 3 times this week. Awesome.

Love this recipe! Made it for the first time and I was shocked that it turned out so wonderfully. I made a criss-cross on the strawberry. Used orange extract & almond extract. Drizzled melted chocolate...absolute perfection!

Everyone really enjoed these. I did it once like the recipe said to then the next time I added some vanilla pudding and little whip topping. It came out just as good and added a little something. I also didn't use whole strawberries. I halfed them and scooped out the middle so I could strech it out. Will make again!!

I made these for my daughter's first birthday party.  They were AWESOME!!  Instead of adding liquor, I took some advice of other reviews and added about a tablespoon of vanilla extract and about a teaspoon of almond extract.  I did have to add a bit more powdered sugar then the recipe said because it tasted too cream cheesy.  After stuffing the strawberries, I melted chocolate and drizzled them over the strawberries.  They were gorgeous!  I put them in the refrigerator overnight and they were ready to go the next day!

These were pretty good but not a lot of flavor.  I ended up adding some vanilla and chocolate chips to give it a little something more.  People at the party I brought them to raved about them.  Pretty presentation.

This is a really tasty treat and it looks more difficult than it is. I followed the advice of another review and added 1/2 tsp. pure almond extract, instead of the liquour. I also dipped the strawberries in melted chocolate. Very impressive.

I had to make the stuffing part of it twice.  The first time I made the mistake of buying a softened version of cream cheese and it never got thick enough to "stuff" the strawberries.  The second time I bought regular cream cheese and it worked much better.  The runnier version didn't go to waste, we used it as a fruit dip.  Also, I used vanilla extract like was suggested by another reviewer.

YUMMY!!! I didn't have any orange liquor, so I used almond extract last night and vanilla today. I had to make two batches they were so good. I also grated a dark chocolate hershey bar and sprinkled on top. I think it would be really good if you could drizzle chocolate on top. If you have any suggestions on that, I'm all ears(or eyes)

This is a great recipe, however I am a firm believer that most things taste better with chocolate! So after stuffing these I then dipped them into chocolate and then let them set up in the fridge for about an hour (my family finds this part the hardest!)When I served them at a party most people where expecting just regular chocolate dipped strawberries, everyone was very pleasantly surprised.

Made these twice in one weekend (for separate events) and everyone loved them! They were so easy to make, but so impressive to guests! I was able to fill around 60 medium sized strawberries with one batch. I used an orange flavoring or extract and it worked great.

I made this for Valentine's Day.  What a great presentation for the amount of work.  I used an additional 1/4 cup of 10X sugar for extra sweetness.  After stuffing, I dipped bottom in melted chocolate and sprinkled with mini-chocolate chips.  Wonderful platter!  I like that they can be made earlier in the day.  Next time I am trying it with sweetened ricotta.  Thanks Chef John!  Again!

Simple ingredients with great tasty results.
Big family hit.  Just a bit messy to fill strawberries. This will be made again for sure.

I use the same recipe but instead of this shape, I  cut the tip off and stuff in between, and a dollop on top, so they look like little Santas. Add 2 chocolate sprinkles for eyes. Group assembly at annual Christmas party has become a holiday ritual. If I skipped, I'd be in trouble!

Just made this tonight and was awesome. Used amaretto just b/c that's what I had and topped with a blueberry.  Will definitely make again and want to dip in chocolate next time. Great recipe! Thanks.

Amazing recipe. I recommend making a double batch for partys because if you only make one, it will be gone in five minutes! I made half with blueberries on top, and half with chocolate chips. Either way, it tastes great!

I used vanilla vs orange liqueur. Should have a piping bag. Plastic bag was hard to work with. Used almost 2 lbs of strawberries and had over half the filling left. Only make a couple of hours before using. Otherwise, lose juice from berries.

So easy to make and delicious!  Tweaked based on what I had on hand. 1 tsp pure vanilla extract  and  added 1/2 tub Cool Whip. After stuffing the  strawberries  I topped off with  Hersheys Shell chocolate topping. BF gave it a "11" out of 1-10!  This will be a regular treat!!

I used orange juice instead of the orange liqueur as the person I was making for does not drink.  Everyone loved the strawberries, so I guess I should have brought 2 pans!

These were definitely a hit at a 4th of July BBQ we attended.  The Cointreau didn't add much flavor to me until I added Almond Flavoring to it.  The filling was a bit runny, but I read that could have been from over beating.  Good to know!  Next time, I'll just use Almond flavoring.

This is a great recipe when you want to have a healthier dessert.  I did cut back on some of the sugar and added mini semi-sweet chocolate chips.  I cut out the center and spooned it in that way - still pretty and yummy!

Scrumptious. I used vanilla instead of the orange and it was awesome. Like other reviewers have said make plenty - they go very quickly. The criss cross slit is fine but don't cut too far - best advice have a helper hold the berry while you pipe the filling.

I hollowed out the stem side and piped the mixture in that cavity.  I used vanilla instead of the liqueur.  Placed four on each dessert plate and sifted cocoa powder over the berries.  Delicious!

I substituted the orange extract for the orange liqueur by using 1 tsp of extract instead of the 2 TBS of liqueur.  I think this was a perfect amount of orange flavor.  They were a big hit.  Great flavor.

I made the recipe as directed (no alterations), and thought it was pretty good.  However, I think I would prefer it without the Grand Marnier.  I will make this again, as I think it would be perfect for a shower, reception or dinner party.

Honestly, this was quite easy to do.  I used probably about 1/4t orange extract and it left a mild flavor.  They looked pretty and tasted good, but not "knock your socks off."

I know I'm in the minority here, but although I like the 'idea' of stuffing the strawberries, I didn't like the slimy filling texture or even the flavor. I plan to revamp this recipe by making an actual real cheese cake, scooping it with a melon baler and placing the cheesecake balls inside of the strawberries. I think the denser dryer texture of real cheese cake would compliment the strawberries and my mouth better. I would only use about 1 tsp. of vanilla instead of the orange liquor {2 tbls. listed in the recipe is WAY TOO MUCH and overpowers the flavor of the cheese.}

Amazing!!! Quick, easy and delicious!!! These were so good I made another batch the next day. Made these for a dinner party and everyone loved them. I followed the recipe exactly. On the second batch I shaved some milk chocolate on top and added some mint leaves for garnish. A must try recipe. Thank you:)

This recipe is amazing. The filling tastes great! I did not cut strawberries in cross section but hulled and cored them out to make a small little strawberry bowl. Chilling in the fridge adds more refreshing sense to it. I am usually not a fan of creamcheese but cannot stop eating this. Thank you.

These are absolutely delicious. I changed the recipe a tiny bit though. I didn't want to use orange liqueur so I used 2 tsps of vanilla extract instead and then drizzled some melted chocolate over them. I made a plate to share with my fiance and when I turned around he ate them all!! LOL Very simple but so delicious!! :)

I loved this, and so did everyone else!  So incredibly easy. I swapped out the orange liqueur for Peach Schnapps since I had that on hand and I didn't feel like buying a whole bottle for such a small amount.  Everyone loved them. I'll be making them for the office and swapping alcohol for flavoring instead. I criss-crossed the cut as well as other users did, and it worked great. I did have to fan out the strawberry so that all sections were filled, otherwise only half the strawberry would receive filling. I also sprinkled sugar cane crystals on the top for decor. 
Either way, this was amazing.

These are very nice. I made them for a 'ladies dinner party' for a small plate desserts. They were very good. I found for me the medium strawberries worked best and I did chill them in the freezer for about 15 minutes after I cut them.It seemed to help with the juice from looking runny when I 'stuffed' them. Thank you

My husband and I liked the cream cheese  but,  I had trouble getting the cream cheese into the strawberries.  I finally gave up  and cut the 
strawberries in half and just put the cream cheese on top.
Tasted great but the  presentation was not pretty.

I tried this recipe
  #1. It is very sweet. 
#2. It doesn't pipe into the cross-cut strawberries nicely at all, in fact it's quite messy.  

I very rarely leave reviews but, do like this concept and need some experimenting to discover a creative way to achieve a desirable look and for personal taste, less sweetness.

I made these tonight for a small party and they were gobbled up.  I tweaked them to make them healthier.  I used fat free cream cheese, Splenda and vanilla and they came out great!  I also prepared the berries differently.  I cored them and filled the open cavity with the cream cheese mixture.  Thanks for the inspiration!  I will be making these many, many more times.

This sounded perfect for a 4th of July party I was attending but the stuffing was so soupy it seeped out everywhere. I even tried coring the strawberries and propping them up but the filling was so liquidy it poured right out. One star because the flavor and idea were great, but a 0 for feasibility.

Soooooo simple & delicious! Basically the same as Paula Dean's which has chopped pecans (or your favorite nut) on top. Always a hit.

MMMM good!!! I used low fat cream cheese, vanilla instead of orange liqueur, and 3/4 cup conf. sugar. I got the top off, used a tiny 1/2 tsp to take some of the middle out and then cut the tip off just a little bit so it would stand.

These were very good!  I used french vanilla liquere instead of the orange.  They still turned out great!  I think next time I will make these using vanilla extract in place of the liqueur for the kids.

Oh my!  I wish I could rate it higher than 5 stars!This is absolutely my favorite summer dessert now!  Super simple & everyone loves them.  I used orange extract instead of the orange liqueur, not 2 tbsp though!  It is a lot stronger than the liqueur.  I thought I might try almond extract next time!  Also, I used a plastic baggie with the corner cut off but it was a little difficult, I will definately be buying a pastry bag & tips to make these easier because I'm sure I will make them ALL the time!

These were good.  Hubby liked them more than me, but they were easy.  I used almond extract, but next time I think I will try vanilla.  I also drizzled melted chocolate over the tops.

Really liked this recipe. Very pretty and simple! The first batch I made I put mini chocolate chips into cream mixture. Wrong move, they clogged the tip of my pastry bag! Finely shaved chocolate or mini chips over the top is a nice addition. Oh and I used almond extract and liked the taste very much.

Good recipe and great for a brunch! I use gran marnier or ameretto as extra flavor and top with sliced almonds- OR dip in Ganache #1!!! and yes, do a x cut on the tip-end, one cut doesnt do it.

These were great! Instead of orange flavored liqueur I used orange rind zest and it was wonderful. Everyone loved these, a little bit of a pain to stuff all of them but worth it at the end.

VERY tasty. I made a few minor changes: I used a cap full of vanilla extract in place of the liquor and it was delsih. I also didnt do the whole criss-cross thing... I cut the top off the berries, and scooped a little of the insides out so I had a hole for the filling. I also dipped the berries in chocolate BEFORE filling the berries. I dipped them in semi sweet chocolate chips, put them on wax paper and put in the fridge to harden. Then I filled them and refrigerated until I had to leave for the baby shpwer. Everyone LOVED them. I personally think that without the chocolate it wouldnt have been nearly as good. I am making this very soon!

Yum Yum!!!! I also cut and X through the top of the strawberry and found it pretty easy to inject the mixture. I drizzled some chocolate over the top and they were a hit. Thanks

Unfortunately my family and I were not a fan of these. I followed the recipe as is. Not sure exactly what it was that we didn't care for. I served them over a chocolate mousse that I made and drizzled chocolate on them which made them much better, but we couldn't eat them just by themselves. They are very pretty though I must say! I am sure I will make these again for a get-together sometime but serving it with a sinful dose of chocolate is a must!

Yummy!  Next time I'll try it with some 'nilla extract instead of orange liquer, and I'll add a touch more sugar to lessen the taste of the cream cheese.  I'm thinking these might be good with a touch of kahlua added in in place of the orange liquer.  I garnished with some chocolate icing made from the One Minute Chocolate Icing recipe found on this site.

These are really such a pretty and simple treat. I really liked these! I did not have any orange liqueur so I used some lemon extract and I think it worked out nicely. I will definitely make these again!

I love this dessert! This recipe is similar to mine, but instead of the orange flavor I add vanilla extract & top with chopped pecans. YUM! They taste like strawberry cheesecake, & topping with buttery graham cracker crumbs instead of pecans intensifies that flavor!

I altered the recipe so it's not a true review, but I think from everyone else's review,we get the point that they are great!  I just used a little fresh OJ instead or liquor to make the cream cheese mixture and very LITTLE powdered sugar. I plan to make these for a bridal shower and dip them in chocolate like another cook did. Yummy and different!

I really like this recipe. But I found it a bit difficult to stuff so after awhile I gave up and just cut the strawberries up and put them in indiviual severing and took the stuffing and put it on the top. It still turned out great. Everyone liked it and didn't know the difference.

These were quite tasty as written, but they were better covered in chocolate. I used almond extract instead of the liquer. I wouldn't suggest making these for the first time right before the event you want to take them to... the fanning out and stuffing (at least for me) had a bit of a learning curve. I think I messed up about 6 strawberries before I really got the hang of it.
