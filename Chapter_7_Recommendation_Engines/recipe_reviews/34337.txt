Here are some tips for this cobbler recipe.  If you want to reduce the fat, you can reduce the butter to 1/4 cup and the oil to 1/2 cup without compromising the flavor.  This is a crust-heavy recipe.  If you want more emphasis on the peaches, just make half the topping ingredients or make two pans of peaches and divide one crust recipe over them.  You can also add flavors to the crust (like vanilla or almond extract) or a splash of flavor to the peaches (like amaretto).  You can change the cinnamon to nutmeg or a combination of spices if you like, or sprinkle the top with chopped nuts before baking.

This was very good but I also altered it slightly after reading a few reviews. I cut the oil and butter in half. I aslo cut the white sugar to 1 1/2 cups. It was perfect, not too sweet at all.

Very dissappointing.  The first few bites were wonderful because I like sweet food.  But then it was overpowering.  If I use this recipe again, I'll only use half of the topping ingredients.  Also, I'll use the butter for the topping and skip the oil. Right now I'm picking out the peaches to eat them.

Each year at this time I normally make the Southern Peach Cobbler off this site. I love to make different recipes, so I thought I would try this one. The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because I altered the oil and the sugar in it. The taste is for sure 5 star worthy!! Anyway, I cut the oil to 3/4 cup and the white sugar to 1 1/3 cups.

We loved this. I did use the recipe submitter's low-fat suggestions, with great success. I also added a splash of vanilla to the wet ingredients, and we served this hot with vanilla ice cream. Tasted like a bowlful of Ben & Jerry's "Willie Nelson's Peach Cobbler" ice cream! Thanks for the recipe! (P. S. I'd use more peaches, 2 more, I think, next time, mine were small, but we like a lot of fruit.) EDIT: Be sure to store this in the refrigerator as the crust gets soggy if left out of the fridge for too long!

This is not a recipe that I would recommend to anyone. Last night I made it for my husband. Needless to say, we were both very disappointed. The filling is delicious, but the crust is inedible. It browns up quite nicely and is crisp on top, but it is so greasy that we could not eat it!

Excellent!  Hubby made this delicious cobbler...with a little help from his friendly wife!  We enjoyed it a lot - make sure it's thoroughly baked or it will taste doughy.  We halved the recipe and it would esily serve 8 w/wo ice cream.

Peach cobbler is my all time favorite dessert so I am always trying different recipes looking for the best.  I prefer a cobbler-crumb combination for the crust but gave this a try.  I actually cut all ingredients in half except for the peaches( used about 6 medium) and baked in a pie plate.  This cobbler was more like peaches with a very, very sweet sugar cookie on top.  It reminded me more of a crumb. The first couple spoonfuls were good, but I too got overwhelmed after the initial spoonfuls from the sweetness like another reviewer stated.  This recipe was super fast to make and I may try it again but next time reduce the sugar. It is a quick dessert if one is needed for a potluck or other occasion.

I took the advice of cutting the amount of butter and oil in half and my own addition was slivered almonds on top of the peaches. This is fantastic! It tastes like almond macaroon cookies on top of luscious fresh peaches! A definite keeper!

If you like peaches and sugar cookies this is a perfect combination for a cobbler!  It is very sweet and very easy to make.  It takes less than 10 minutes to put together.

this recipes is very easy. great way to use up extra peaches without having to make a time consuming pie crust, etc. it's very tasty, and very sweet. the only downside is the amount of oil used. next time i think i'll cut it down to 3/4 C or maybe just use enough to make the topping moist. it seems like there might even be extra oil in the peaches as a result. also, make sure you use a deep enough dish. i used smaller peaches and thought i could get away with a round tart dish, but it cooked over the sides and i had an oily mess in the bottom of my oven to clean up afterwards. other than those 2 things, i think it's great.

I created an account just to post a review of this recipe. The crust tasted like oil - and nothing else. It baked up nicely, and had a beautiful golden crust. I had really high hopes for it when I took it out of the oven! However, as soon as I bit into it... it just tasted like warm squishy oil soaked cookies.  I could press down on the crust with my fork and see the oil drip out onto my plate. 

It was also SOOOO sweet, much to much sugar.

I LOVE this recipe! But I don't use oil,instead I use butter. Using butter instead of oil makes the clobber less oily.

I'd decided to make a peach pound cake for tonight's dessert and then realized I hadn't set the butter out to soften so I looked for another peach dessert recipe and stumbled across this one.  I cut back on the sugar in the topping (1 1/3 cups) and the oil (1/2 cup) and added 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract.  I had to omit the cinnamon because someone in the house hates it.  
OMG CindyAnn this is definitely a keeper.  The flavors are amazing plus I really enjoy the different textures:  tender peaches, crunchy topping and the creamy sauce.  This will always be the go to recipe for cobbler now.

This recipe is sooo good.  I've made it three times in past week.  I did do a few additions.  The first time I added bing cherries and blueberries with fresh mint leaves under the crust, the second time I made 1 1/2 recipes of the crust and added the bing cherries again. (doing it that way does take away from getting the full fruit flavor a little bit, so if you're after the full fruit flavor, then keep the recipe the same.)  The third time I used sour cherries with the peaches and that was yummy too.  Each time I added about a tablespoon of vanilla to the crust, I replaced a cup of white sugar with sucanat, instead of vegetable oil, I used melted butter.  With that ingredient combination it gave it a wonderful carmel flavor.  This fall I plan on doing apples with cranberries.  I can't wait to try that.  Needles to say this dessert did not last long in our house and it's super easy to make.

Pretty good.  I used frozen peaches and forgot to top the crust with cinnamon; it was still good.  I did halve the recipe and I halved the sugar again, so that it was sweet but not too sweet.  I would have to agree that it wouldve been too sweet with all that sugar.  Overall, pretty good cobbler--good for those with a sweet tooth.  Thanks for the recipe.

I used only the crust on a sweet potato-pineapple cobbler. I made up the filling and wanted a good crust. It came out great! It had a very crispy top and was nice and mushy near the filling.

I used the basic recipe B U T 1/2 the butter, 1/2 the brown sugar, 1/2 the granulated sugar and 1/2 the oil.  The results were great. The topping was crusty like cookies. My husband and I love it.  I'm going back for more. 2 stars for original recipe  5 stars for my version.

This is the best cobbler topping I have ever made. I did not have enough fresh peaches so I added some canned peaches, drained. I will try a lighter version, just to see how it stacks up. Thanks for sharing.

this was to die for.  my rating might be off because i did alter it, but if you pay attention the review's and the recipe footnotes, you should clearly pick up on a theme.  reduce the butter and oil and this dish will be divine.  i think you must use fresh peaches - it just wouldn't be the same with some peaches out of a tin can.  try this recipe - you won't be disappointed!

I love this topping. I began making it in Sept. for a
late afternoon/evening lake party and continued making it thru the fall into the holidays without any problems. I did reduce the oil a bit but the sugar was fine because I used apples (mixture of gala, granny smith and lady) it was a HUGE hit each time. Thanks for a great recipe that is good with ANY fruit!!

Fabulous. Super easy and we all loved the results. There was nothing left in the dish. I only reduced the sugar by half in the topping and  reduced the oil by half and added a bit of milk. This is one dessert that won't disappoint.

I made the (slightly) lighter version.  It was amazing!  I’m going to bring it a family dinner but I’m going to attempt to halve the recipe. If I make the whole thing, we will eat it all as fast as we can.  This is a recipe I will make again and again.

This is a hit!! Mind blowing! Made me look like a hero. ????. I made this in a pinch and substituted white sugar for brown . Also used baking soda  instead..no problem! —it’s not low calorie but it’s worth it!!

Such a delicious cobbler! Tried out this recipe to use up some peaches and ended up making it 4 times in one week! And then I tried it again with apples because my family was still requesting it and we were out of peaches. It was just as amazing with apples! Yum! Best cobbler ever!

Super yummy! I made as is without eggs since hubby is allergic. Only put 1.5 cups sugar and 3/4 cup of vegetable oil and still turned out great! Only reason for 4 stars is bc I think needs more peaches. Next time I will put at least 10-12 but I like less cobbler more peaches.

I really loved this recipe, only reason I went with  the 4 stars was due to it being too much butter.  Next time I will cut back on the butter in the topping a bit, like others did.  Flavor is great, recipe is so easy.  I tend to be lazy so I chose not to peel my fresh peaches.  I just cut them up and tossed them in the baking dish,  no pit of course..  It made no difference so if you prefer not to peel them you will still get a great dessert.  My fresh peaches were a bit mealy and not very flavorful but  they were all I had so I used them anyway.  Turns out that didn't matter because cooking them brought out the sweetness.  I recommend this recipe, maybe use 1/3 c of butter instead of 1/2.

Very good. I didn't sprinkle the brown sugar over the peaches so it wasn't overly sweet.

I made this for the first time and it was very easy, & I am one not to change the recipe the very first time I have tired it.  I'm not really sure if I would change anything and it was a total hit.  The cookie crust is really good.  Thank You Cindy Ann
