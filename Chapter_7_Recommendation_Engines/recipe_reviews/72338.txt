Delicious! The dressing is very good. You can easily adjust the veggies to suit your tastes. I cut back on the snap peas and added some carrots that I cut into match sticks. Overall, very tasty - great side dish!

These were wonderful. I needed to find a recipe I could use Udon noodles with. After doing a search, this came up. I added red, green and yellow peppers and sesame seeds to garnish. My family (who is very picky) ate it all up!

YUM!  I used peapods instead of snap peas (bought the wrong ones) ,added about 1/3 of a large cucumber cut into thin matchstick pieces and some shredded carrot. Guess you could really use any vegetables that you would put into a stirfry.  Next time I will add some leftover chicken or shrimp. Thanks for the recipe, Baja!

Both Hubs and I agree these are exceptional and 5-star good. BUT....use the dressing to taste!  I only used half of what I made and it was plenty.  Other than eliminating the snap peas I stuck to the recipe and it's just as pretty as it is delicious.  I just love the flavor of sesame oil!

Teriyaki chicken was on the dinner menu and was looking for a starch to replace the rice I had planned on serving.  Happened upon this recipe and thought I'd give it a whirl...  WOW, am so glad I did.  HELPFUL HINT:  As with any recipe that calls for dressing, always add to taste.  This recipe definitely falls under this rule otherwise the noodles will be too oily as others have noted in their reviews.  Overall 5 star.  Thank you bajathecat for the submission!

Very good cold from the fridge after marinating in juices.  Used whole grain Udon.
Changes:  Replaced rice vinegar with white vinegar.

This was good, was looking for recipes to use udon noodles. Loved the dressing, sesame oil was too expensive at my store so i didn't use it. I agree with others that you can use what ever veggies you like. I also added napa cabbage and mushrooms. I don't think iv'e ever used fresh ginger but boy it was good in this.

This is an excellent dish! It's just tangy enough, and the sesame seeds balance out the tang of garlic and ginger. I added extra toasted sesame seeds.  :D  Make sure you don't have too much sauce in proportion to the noodles.

I thought this was a really tasty recipe, especially on this very hot and sticky day. Due to peanut allergies I used canola oil and added a bit of sugar to the dressing. In addition to the vegies listed, I also added cabbage and baby spinach. Leftover chicken helped to make this meal complete. I used four packages of Ramen noodles, which made a lot, but just about all of it was eaten. Gang obviously loved this dish cat and we all thank you!

I used the recipe for the sauce, but thats all. I threw completely different vegetables in the wok to cook, then the sauce, then cooked (dried packet) udon noodles. The sauce flavor was fantastic - we ate this dish on its own as a meal.

I made this tonight and it turned out really well. It's great because it doesn't take much time to prepare and you can use pretty much any veggies (fresh or frozen) that you have on hand. I would reccomend pouring a little bit of the dressing on at a time because it ended up being a bit to oily for me. That aside, a great recipe. Thanks!

Instead of using peppers and snap peas, I used once carton of sliced mushrooms, 1 can of small corn (drained), and a half a cup of cashews.  Garnish with cilantro.  It's a wonderful dish!

I sauteed my vegetables in the sesame oil instead and also added chicken to make it a meal. I also stir-fried the noodles for a few minutes in the sauce. These noodles absorb the sauce like a sponge if you let them simmer in the sauce for 10 minutes before serving. Broccoli is a great veggie to add because it also absorbs the flavors. Also, I was worried that the noodles would be under-cooked because my package said to cook for 13 minutes, but boiling for 3 and stir-frying for 3-4 minutes was perfect! I did not think this was too oily.

i also found that the recipe needed twice the amount of udon noodles to go with the amount of dressing. i used cayenne pepper for the hot element, and added julienned carrots. definitely let it chill for a couple of hours to let the flavours meld. end result: delicious!

I enjoyed this a lot. In my opinion there is enough sauce for double the amount of noodles though.

Anything can go in your noodles/veggies mixture.  What I came for was the dressing.  I didn't have any fresh ginger on hand so I used ginger powder instead.  It's alright.  You dont' taste the ginger.  I had done it one other time with fresh ginger and it tasted much better.    There seemed to be a lot of sauce though.  I spooned mine in my udon / veggy mixture... I think maybe I put 8 dinner spoons  in (that's right.. I used a dinner spoon because my measuring spoon was in the sink)... And I have like 1/2 cup left!    Overall, not bad. :)

This is very tasty, BUT I would recommend pouring the dressing on to taste.  It was very oily as written.  It would be great with a variety of vegetables too.  I didn't add snap peas as they are very difficult to find where I live.

Absolutely delicious! A stumbled upon this recipe looking for a way to use up some leftover pork tenderloin, and this fit perfectly. I only added 2 ingredients to the recipe as written, the pork and mushrooms and I used dried udon noodles. Talk about flavor....wow! Added a picture too, it was so pretty to look at as well. I will make again and again.

This was much better tasting after it sat in the fridge for a day. I liked it but my husband wasn't wild about it-- said it had too much seasame flavor, which was weird because I thought the heavy flavor was the vinegar. Anyway, I prepared this as listed, with the only change being that it was an 8 oz. package of noodles cooked to pkg. directions (5 minutes), and I tossed some pre-cooked shrimp (tails trimmed off) in with the noodles while they were cooking.

Very yummy. I did follow the other comments instructions and only use about 1/2 of the 'dressing' for the udon.

Decent recipe but not great.  I do agree with the other reviewers that it seemed a bit oily.  I probably shouldn't of added the 1/4 of oil (sesame oil would of been just fine).  Also a 7 oz package of udon noodles is technically a single 200 gram serving, it doesn't serve 4.  I used three 7 oz packages of udon noodles and with the mixed vegetables, the sauce was still a bit greasy.  This was totally edible, but I probably wouldn't make this one again.

My first time using Udon noodles. But very good, the peppers and snap peas make it very light and a very nice side dish

I made just the sauce without hot sauce for the noodles because I had already made a spicy stir fry and didn't want to overdo it on spiciness. Also, I didn't have any peanut oil or fresh ginger. I used ginger powder instead, and the sauce was so good! I'll definitely make this again.

Very tasty recipe!  I usually do not improvise on the recipes found on All Recipes, but it was snowing and I didn't want to brave the elements.  I used sunflower oil instead of peanut oil, yellow onion instead of green, broccoli instead of pea pods and black sesame seeds instead of toasted.  It turned out very yummy!  I will make this one again.

I didn't have peppers or peas so I used broccoli, string beans and mushrooms, which I quickly stir fried. I broiled some salmon and served it on top of the noodles and veggies. It was delicious! Can't get better in a restaurant! This recipe is a keeper!

This recipe is versatile enough to allow substitutions for the veggies.  However, it was too oily and vinegary for my taste.  I didn't see why the 1/4 cup of oil was necessary at all.  The sesame oil gave the flavor and it was enough (with the toasted sesame seeds).  Hadn't used udon noodles before and DID like them.  Hubby like this recipe.

I used two pkgs. of udon noodles and that seemed about right for the amount of dressing. I also substituted part olive/part safflower oil for peanut oil due to allergies. I added quite a bit more thana dash of hot pepper sauce and it wasn't too hot. I LOVED the ginger in the dressing!

I didn't have quite everythign on hand.  I used a white onion in place fo the green ones, and broccoli instead of the peas.  It was good, but Snow Peas or Snap Peas would have been better.  I really liked the dressing, though I skimped on the oil a little.  The only other thing I changed, was to saute all the veggies along with the sesame seeds in a skillet instead of using the microwave.  I've printed this recipe to add to my regular rotation!  Very good!

Was quite tasty. We didn't have any peanut oil so I used some creamy peanut butter instead. I think I will like it better with the oil. I also added some rice cooking wine. I will probably be adding cubed tofu to it next go round but all round a solid recipe.

This seemed like a great recipe, but it just didn't work.  I made several changes to it so it was edible.  I also added some sweetener to balance the flavors.  The udon noodles weren't to my taste either.  I would use ramen or even thin spaghetti.

This recipe is REALLY good!  Whole family loved it.  Had to substitute a tiny bit.  Canola oil instead of peanut oil and then tahini instead of sesame oil.  Couldn't find soba noodles so used 8 oz. of angel hair pasta.  Such a great flavor!

Excellent! This goes to the "keeper" file. I didn't cook the udon noodles as long as recommended, probably because of different brands so watch this. Also, instead of hot sauce a squirt of Sriracha seemed to work better the second time a made it. The Sriracha lends a better Asian taste than hot pepper sauce, like Tabasco. I also used dried ginger instead of fresh and it was fine too. I do recommend serving this warm instead of cold as the flavors seem to meld better.

I hate to cook...no really, you have no idea how much I hate cooking.  I tried the recipe out of desperation to use what few ingredients I had on hand...one being a large bag of Udon noodles, of which I cooked enough for this to be a whole meal.  Everyone in our home from the youngest child to both parents (dh is a great cook unlike myself) LOVED this recipe!  I only had a couple green peppers on hand and a zucchini, so that's what I used for vegetables.  I didn't have fresh ginger, so I used about 3tsp powdered ginger.  I kept the dressing separate to add as desired.  I can't wait to use this recipe again and try it with other vegetables, but I think the squash might be hard to beat.  I also did not use any hot sauce because only my dh likes it, but even he opted not to add any because the flavor was perfect without it.

very good. simple and quick. I did leave out the garlic because I have a sensitivity to it and I also used vegetable oil in place of the peanut oil because we have a child with a nut allergy. For the veggies I used 1/2 a yellow pepper and 1/2 an orange (both bell) and 2 cups of green beans because I didn't have any of the veggies on hand, but the yellow bell pepper. It was really really good. I also used organic DRY udon noodles because it was what i had in the cabinet. yum! will make again with all kinds of veggie substitutions.

I read the reviews first and made the following changes to the dressing: 1) used only 2 T sesame oil and no peanut oil, 2) added 1/4 t red pepper flakes and 1/2 t Sriracha hot sauce 3) added about 3/4 t sugar 4) used low-sodium soy sauce. I thought it was very good, not too oily or too hot despite the extra heat I added. This recipe is versatile and can be adjusted according to what kinds of veggies and noodles you have on hand. I will be making this all summer.

My husband and I are becoming vegetarians and loved this meal.  I would add more veggies next time just to make it a little more filling... and I agree any veggies would really work in this meal.  Thanks!

wonderful!  super easy and super tasty!  like other reviewers i added a little more hot sauce and quickly tossed the veggies on a wok (since i like the taste of raw veggies). also i've only tried this recipe with buckwheat and soba noodles but i think the buckwheat noodles tasted better! it made the dish much more substantial plus they're healthier than udon.

The best thing I have made from All Recipes so far. I used a 17.65 oz package of dried udon noodles from the Japanese market. The package is written in Japanese, which I do not read, but I think the brand might be Sanshuan. I left out the peanut oil completely because I didn't have any. I didn't substitute for it, and the oiliness is exactly perfect. I used 1/2 tablespoon of ground ginger in place of fresh ginger. I used sriracha for the hot pepper sauce.

Delicious and different noodles. I left out the peppers and added some chopped sauteed spinach and onion.  Tasted great.  We only used about half the sauce, and so we can look forward to another tasty dish of udon noodles.

This is very good, although at first we found it a bit too tangy. The simple solution was to add some hoisin sauce to the dressing. Once I did that, the family couldn't stop eating it, the kids took it in their school lunches the next day and they were asking for it again the following week. I didn't have any snap peas, but I had some frozen edamame, so I substituted that. I also added matchstick carrots and shrimp.

Loved this! I used the veggies I had on hand and it was perfect. I don't think it was too oily at all. I did add about 3 TBS peanut butter to the sauce and it was phenomenal!

I really loved it. I used 14oz of udon noodles. I did not put in the hot sauce or the peppers. For me the spice was perfect. My husband and kids thought it was too spicy.  If I make it again I will reduce the ginger to lower the spice.

I stir fried the veggies with chicken and cooled them in fridge as well as noodles before serving. I don't like to microwave veggies. Sauce was good though and let the noodles marinate in that for a while.

Fabulous recipe.     As a side dish, this tends to serve 2, not 4.  This isn't bc the portions are meager-- it's bc people want more of it.     I prefer just a bit less oil.   Otherwise, I follow this recipe precisely.  Often serve this with Halibut with Rice Wine, a recipe available on this website.    The two work very well together.

I made this with different veggies (what happened to be in my fridge) and everyone loved it. I cooked the udon noodle in a saute pan. Drained and returned to the pan and slowly added the sauce to it. I was worried about it being to oily, as stated by some of the other reviewers. I ended up using all of the sauce and it was perfect for my taste (although I didn't add quite as much peanut oil as the recipe called for because I ran out). I added raw spinach, onion, green onion and some thawed frozen peas to the pan and heated until the spinach wilted and some of the extra sauce evaporated. Perfection. I was liberal with the amount of Sriracha in the sauce and loved the heat!

I made it, the dressing was tasty enough, but there was WAY too much  dressing for one pkg of noodles and the veggies mentioned. There's a pool of dressing at the bottom of my serving bowl, so I would say to use half the amount of oil and soy sauce unless you're using a lot of noodles, more than this recipe calls for. I only used about 3/4 the dressing I made, and it was still too much.  So I'll have some in the 'fridge for nest time- not sure how long it will keep. However, taste was not disappointing, I liked it, but it was a bit time consuming for me to make.

It is good but a bit strong on the rice vinegar.  I would only use 2 tablespoons next time.

This is the best udon noodle recipe I have come across yet. I disagree, I thought the dressing was perfect. I added in some shredded carrot and broccoli. Super tasty. The family loved it. Will definitely be doing it again sometime soon ans will be adding it to my recipe book.

This recipe was really easy to prepare and my husband and I both enjoyed it, but I did find the rice vinegar to overpower the rest of the flavours in the dressing.  Next time I'll cut down on the vinegar and see if that turns this recipe into a five-star one.  *UPDATE*  Made this again, this time with 2/3rd of the rice vinegar and I doubled the noodles.  Still quite strong, but an improvement from the recipe as written.  Perhaps I'll consider adding a bit of white sugar next time to sweeten up the taste a bit.

I have used this recipe for many years, it is our favorite. Great with Aha tuna steak. I do not change anything in this recipe other than sometime add a few more veggies! And it good even the next day cold. Thank you

Turned out really good.  You can add or subtract to whatever your families taste!  Used organic Udon noodles precooked purchased at Costco - fast and easy and healthy!

Very Good.  Will definitely make again. I changed the preparation but the ingredients were the same except I added chicken to make it a meal not a side dish. I made sauce and took one third of the sauce to marinade the chicken (2 breast halves) for one hour.  Sauteed chicken in 2 tbsp peanut oil in wok, added vegetables, then added cooked noodles and remaining sauce to wok to combine and served. Delicious.

A good base of flavours but there really is WAY TOO MUCH OIL.  You will most likely add more vinegar in order to cut through the overwhelming amount of oil in the vinaigrette. To make things more interesting I also added some hoisin sauce to balance out the salty taste and a teaspoon and a half of sriracha sauce, which worked well. These are great flavours to work with, but you will need to tinker around with the amounts in order for it to work well.

Simple recipe and easy to follow. I used white vinegar and using only 2 tbsp. of sesame oil, omitting the peanut oil would not make this dish greasy. I used the ready mixed minced garlic and ginger from a bottle. Then I added 1 Tbsp. oyster sauce to make it more flavourful. Jaaz

Excellent! I used steamed broccoli for my veggies. Worked well with the dressing (add to your taste, not the whole amount). Very easy, versatile, and tasty.

The flavor was pretty good. Even though I used low sodium soy sauce, it seemed really salty. I lowered the amount of oils based on some reviews. Husband thought it was a little too gingery for him.

This was incredibly salty, and incredibly oily and the sesame oil was incredibly strong.  I'm not entirely sure how it got so many good reviews, I would not recommend this meal or at least cut back on half of the soy sauce, and oil.

My family loved this recipe. The only substitute I made was a little peanut butter in place of the peanut oil (which I didn't have)Since others complained this was a little oily, I'm glad I used the peanut butter, it was the perfect consistency and held to the noodles beautifully. I only added about 1-1/2 TBLSP. I used a 9oz pkg of udon noodles and there was way too much sauce for the amount of noodles so I kept some aside and used it as a dipping sauce for some beef and chicken satay that I also made. Great meal!

Loved this dish! The vinegar does give it a sharp taste, but the oil mellows it out. My company loved the bold/asian flavours!

Dee-licious! I followed the recipe almost exactly, with the following exceptions: I used 1/8 cup almond oil instead of 1/4 cup peanut oil; I marinated the veggies in the dressing and had them raw (I generally eat veggies raw for their enzymes and higher nutrient value). The flavors and textures were wonderful, with ginger being predominant. The only thing I'd change is next time I'll use a little more hot sauce.
