This was fantastic - a friend of ours made this soup for my husband and I a few months ago, and this recipe was almost as good as hers.  I made the non-vegan version (used butter and chicken broth instead of coconut oil and veggie broth), and it ended up being very good.  One difference between this soup and the one my friend made is that she added a little turmeric to hers, which I will try the next time I make the soup - it adds a little extra kick.  I recommend topping the soup with flax seeds and pine nuts for a satisfying crunch!  It's also nice to serve it with some kind of bread for soaking up every last delicious drop.  Thanks for this great recipe!

I had high hopes for this recipe after reading the reviews.  It seemed like the perfect way to use up the leftover pumpkin and coconut milk I had from two other recipes.  But it was full-fat coconut milk, and perhaps that was my problem.  It was too rich, so even though the flavour was good, there was an overpowering fattiness-- so much so I could hardly finish my small bowl.  My recommendation-- do not use full-fat coconut milk!

This was a really good soup. To spice it up a little bit, I added 1/4 tsp ginger and sprinkled in some cinnamon. Also, a dab of sour cream on top made this soup great.

I made this tonight and my husband loved it!  I made it in the crockpot so I wouldn't have to keep an eye on it.  Turned out great.  Very savory.  I'm a fan!

Yum! I subbed olive oil for the coconut oil, and it was just as delicious. I had lots of people commenting on it and wanting to taste when i brought some to class the next day...and those who did were super impressed!

YUM!  Thanks for this great vegan recipe.  I used fresh pumpkin, a little extra vegetable broth to water down my full fat coconut milk, and added some turmeric, chili powder, fresh ginger and garam masala.  Threw it all in the slow cooker and blended with the immersion blender...a great meal just two hours later.

I absolutely loved this soup. The only changes I made was upping by half every spice except for the salt, and adding 1/2 tsp each of cinnamon and ground ginger. The soup was even better reheated the next day, and was a hit among my friends. Thanks for the great recipe.

Nice base recipe. It was a bit bland and needed to be doctored up. I added more ginger, two basil leaves, a tsp of Peruvian hot pepper sauce and garlic. As a personal preference I like to taste the crunch of the onion and I like how it looks in the soup. And I saved the step of pureeing the mixture and then don't have a blender to clean. A sprinkle of sea salt on the top just prior to serving enhances the flavor. We had this on Halloween and it was appropriately enjoyable for the occasion!

This recipe was very tasty as is. I did it again reducing the curry powder to 1/2 teaspoon and added 1/2 teaspoon garam masala.  Also great!

This soup was delicious!  I chose this recipe because I love coconut, pumpkin, and curry, and I couldn't have been more pleased with the combination.  My housemates and I made a huge pot of it with fresh pumpkins and it went really quickly.  Also, what a great recipe to introduce people to vegan fare!

This is a really simple soup. I am not a big soup maker, but I simply love curry and coconut, so anything that combines those - I'M IN! I only had a large can of pureed pumpkin so I SET THE SERVINGS TO 9 to use up all the pumpkin and didn't have coconut oil so subbed olive oil. After reading the reviews, I made the following changes: added extra pinch of red pepper flakes (1/4 tsp), added 1/4 tsp of ground cardimom, 1/4 tsp of cinnamon, and ground pepper to taste. Once it came time for the blender I used my handblender right on the stove (I love this thing for creamy soups!) and tasted. 
It had good heat, but did find the coconut was a little hidden (maybe b/c no coconut oil?) and the pumpkin flavour was not really coming through so I ADDED 2 TSP SUGAR. (remember my batch was 1.5 times larger so only maybe start with 1/2 tsp if you want to try it) It made a huge difference! Love this recipe! I will make again and try adding some chicken and rice and cauliflower as some have suggested.

Thanks for the recipe! =)

This was a very good soup. I left out the red pepper flakes for the sake of the kids, and I used full fat coconut milk, fresh pumpkin and chicken broth because that was what I had. We were very pleased with the results.

This was phenomenal--a great addition to our christmas dinner.  I only made a few changes out of necessity, though I'm not a fan of changing a recipe before trying.   I made it in the crockpot by sauteing the onons and garlic first then adding all the ingredients.  I omitted the coconut oil (didnt have any) and only used a small mixture of butter/EVOO for sauteeing.  Increased the garlic to 2 cloves, curry to 3 tsp, and the salt to 3/4 tsp.  I had no veggie broth (hence increasing the salt) so I just used water in place of it.  As another reviewer suggested, I added nutmeg, cinnamon and also a bit of pepper to taste.  It was very nice and super spicy--just the way we like it.  No ordinary soup  for us.  My husband RAVED about this soup for three days until it was all gone.  I have to make it again soon.

Husband and I really liked this recipe!  From reviews I was slightly worried to try it because it seemed either people completely altered it and said they liked it or the few that kept it the same either liked it or said it was bland.  Boiling the soup it smelled very fragrant.  Trying it I can see why some thought it was bland.  It just needs some Thai flavor garnishes.  For example I made the soup as is, but we garnished with a little chopped fresh basil, lime zest, and a little squeeze of fresh lime juice.  It brought out the natural flavors of the soup and it was delicious!

My pickiest kid liked this.  I doubled the curry and coriander and omitted the red pepper.  Salted and black peppered to taste at the table.  For a family of 5, I will double the recipe next time.

I followed the advice of reviews and omitted water. I modified receipe by using 4 cups of chicken broth for liquid, I like spicey so increased garlic a bit and increased ginger. I only like fresh pumpkin and wanted creamier soup so added 4 cups of fresh roasted pumpkin. IT REALLY WORKED!  Fresh roasted pumpkin has more texture and water content, this helped with consistancy. It tasted like i came out of professional resturant. Everyone was pleased. Will cook this again.

Great recipe! I did run into one problem - I substituted red curry paste for curry powder, which was delicious flavor-wise, but the curry was much stronger than I anticipated. I used about two teaspoons of the paste, and I actually made the soup so hot I had trouble eating it! I'm sensitive to spicy food though; my hot-food-loving friends who were over for dinner raved about it. (Served it with corn bread by the way - really great combo.)

I love that this recipe calls for coconut oil and milk. Yum! I made this soup before work one morning as I found myself with extra time. I didn't have any coriander and was heavy handed with the crushed red peppers as some reviewers had said the recipe was bland. For some reason I thought it would be a good idea to crock pot it all day and blend it when I got home. Oops. It looked rather over cooked by the time I got home. I blended the cooled the soup and tasted it....and my mouth was on fire! I added another can of coconut milk and a dash of salt and it was delicious.

I am a fan of using imersion blenders rather than a regular blender:  blending is faster and there less risk of getting burned.  The soup is pretty good.  I love the consistency and the red peppers are perfect.  I keep wondering if it would taste good topped with a little maple syrup.

We really enjoyed this soup but I made some modifications.  First I used a fresh acorn squash instead of canned pumpkin (just microwave steamed it and scooped it into soup), added extra curry and a little tumeric because we love flavor, and finally used a whole 15oz can of light cocount milk.  Very yummy.

Very unusual combination of flavors, but a really nice soup. I love curry and I like the addition of healthy coconut oil! The dash of crushed red pepper flakes gives it just a little kick.

I am not vegan and I didn’t have vegetable broth in the house, so I substituted with chicken broth. I doubt that made a huge difference. My whole family loved this soup! I also made it a 3rd time and added chunks of chicken to it after blending. Do not expect this to be a thick soup... it’s quite thin but lovely.

This was a great weeknight meal both my husband and I enjoyed, but I made a few changes. First, I used four cloves of garlic (my rule of thumb is to always use at least double what a recipe calls for). I omitted onions, which meant I didn’t need to boil them with the broth mixture (shaving 10 minutes off the cooking time!). I cut back the broth to one cup and added one cup of water. Took other reviewers’ advice and added ginger and turmeric, skipped the blender because I don’t mind a thicker, chunkier soup, and done in less than 30 minutes! I sprinkled chia seeds (for protein) and shaved coconut for garnish. :)

We loved this flavorful soup for dinner. I added minced fresh ginger, chopped Serrano, and an extra cup of vegetable broth. I drizzled a little hot sauce and fresh ground pepper to taste. Next time I'll add cauliflower or sweet potato to make it more like a chowder.   It was so good.

Delicious soup that's perfect for Meatless Monday! I made it just as directed the first time, and with homemade chicken broth the second time. Both were equally tasty. I don't think it needs the last step using the blender at all. The onions are soft enough and it's a bit more hearty. I served it with a side of beer bread muffins. It's on my permanent rotation now!

I have made this soup many times and it is wonderful! I leave out the coriander because I'm not a fan. I've added cooked cauliflower to this, which is wonderful when blended in the soup with an immersion blender to make it thick and creamy. Tonight I'm adding zucchini and a cup of red lentils to make it heartier and add fiber and protein, as well as great texture. I've used almond milk instead of coconut milk when I didn't have any and it was still great. I've also substituted cooked sweet potato for the pumpkin and then blended with an immersion blender, which was also wonderful. There's so much you can do with this recipe, but the base recipe is also wonderful. I've even served it at a Thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved it!

I'm not really talented at making soup but this one is divine.  Simple and relatively quick to make, I found it rich and hearty.  I put 2 cloves of garlic in because I love it and it was pretty peppy. Also I used a hand mixer right in the pot to blend it rather than pouring it in and out of a blender and it worked perfectly.

I *love* this recipe! This is one soup I keep making as long as pumpkins are in season, and look forward to cooking when the next season approaches. I'll vary the spices (like adding ginger and tumeric, as was suggested in other reviews, and hot curry mix) and pepper each time.

A great recipe for curry lovers! I didn't have coconut oil so I just used olive oil instead. I also used fresh pumpkin and 2 cups of coconut milk. I served in a bread bowl and it was great.

I'm not a huge curry fan, so I cut the curry in half. I kept everything else as directed and garnished with some kale crisps and chopped mixed nuts. This recipe is now saved in my favorites. Loved it!

I served this soup as a first course at a dinner party and it was a bit hit. I did not have coconut oil and substituted canola oil.  But I did have light coconut milk.  I plated it with pumpkin seeds and it looked lovely as well as had that little crunch here and there.  I'd make this again.

Very nice flavor, but in agreement with others, I would double the pumpkin, add a bit of ginger and a little turmeric for color.  We are not vegan, so used chicken stock and are enjoying it very much.

4 stars as written. I followed the recipe almost exactly, except I did not use coconut oil, and I was doubling the recipe and ran out of vegetable stock so I had to use some chicken stock to round it out. We also found it to be kind of bland, so we added some cinnamon, ginger, and a little brown sugar, and that really added some depth to the flavor. I used full fat coconut milk and didn't think the flavor was overpowering. I did choose to blend the soup to make it a smooth texture, and I'm glad I did, though I think having an immersion blender would be a HUGE time saver here. A fairly healthy and (with the exception of the blending), fairly easy recipe. Served this at work for a pumpkin potluck, big hit!

I love this soup! I use McCormick’s mild curry for all the flavor and almost no heat. For a heartier meal, I serve this over a mashed up baked potato. The texture and flavor are wonderful!
For carnivores, a little bacon sprinkled on top adds even more flavor, though it’s not needed.

I got a ton of volunteer mini pumpkins last year (all larger than the usual ones).  So I was looking for different pumpkin recipes to use them in.  I roasted the pumpkin and then froze it in batches in the amounts called for in the recipes I use. My favorites were pumpkin bread and this wonderful, creamy, comfort soup recipe!  LOVE it!  For additional health and color, I add some turmeric.

The addition of an entire can (13.5  oz) of Lite coconut milk  requires a full tablespoon of curry powder, 1-1/2 teaspoons salt, and 1 teaspoonful pepper flakes. These changes create a 5-star soup. However,  as written, the original has too much sweetness and needs more BANG! Therefore, 4-stars. Adjust your spices as needed for your palate. It's delicious with the additions noted to create an excellent and assertive flavor profile.

Just made this soup. Didn't have veggie broth, used chicken broth. Used full fat coconut milk as that was all I had. Added garam masala as others recommended, made the soup so flavorful.  Great comfort soup on this freezing, snowy winter night.

5 star for a baseline inspiration. I'm sure this is good as is but I made adjustments for my own thing... cook your spices with the onion creates a much deeper flavor so add them in the middle of cooking the onions before the broth. I added a bunch of cumin because I like that in everything curry, and lots of cinnamon. I added salt last which really enhanced all the other flavors. Used an immersion blender for a smooth and mustard seed speckled soup. I'm pretty sure I doubled the spices called for but that's personal preference. I had fresh pumpkin that was the inspiration for this, and I am pretty sure it was way better than using canned pumpkin.  I also love making vegan and gluten free so everyone can have some!

I'm afraid I might have screwed this recipe up.  It ended up quite bland and I added lots of salt and ate it with cheese to make it palatable... I'm not usually a salt-adder.  I think it got mixed up in tripling the recipe for the huge pumpkin I was trying to use up.

This is a great soup! The changes I made were: butter in place of coconut oil, 2 cloves of garlic, chicken broth instead of vegetable,  1 teaspoon Himalayan salt, didn't have pepper flakes or coriander, so I added a dash each of turmeric, cinnamon and nutmeg. It is a warm, fully satisfying savory soup great as a starter for Thanksgiving meal! I was asked for the recipe from family members! Thanks, Pharmergirl

Not as much flavour as I was hoping for. I did use left over pumpkin from Halloween though. Maybe it was too big.

I did as others and doubled the spices. I don't think it was necessary though. I also added the tumeric. We really liked the soup, but next time I won't double the spices. Also, I only made half of the recipe (3 servings).

Everyone liked the aroma.  I substituted chicken broth for the vegetable broth, and used double the amount of  pumpkin puree.  I also used butter and oil in place of the coconut oil.

I had never tried cooking vegan before, so this was a good first step.  I followed the recipe pretty closely, but added more onion and more pumpkin.  It's tasty, good consistency, but a bit bland for my tastes.  I took some of the other reviewers suggestions and added more coriander and curry, along with some ginger and turmeric, and a dash or two of hot sauce.  That did wonders, and now it's delicious!  And I feel SO virtuous eating healthy... ;)

Very delicious. I made it with one small fresh pie pumpkin. Cut in half and cleaned, then baked for 30 minutes at 400 degrees. Cooled a bit, then mushed it.

Delicious, though best as a side since it’s not overly filling, in my opinion. I used regular coconut milk, not light. And I added a can of chickpeas to give it some protein. I’m sure that changed the texture and the flavour a little, but it was still delicious!

Delicious! I served this soup for Friendsgiving last night, and it was enjoyed by each guest, including the non-vegan friends and family members! I pureed freshly roasted pumpkins to make the soup. I think that the coconut milk and curry complemented the pumpkin extremely well, and it smelled heavenly! I will definitely make this again -- it is a guest pleaser!

Wow - I thought it was a little weird to make a "pumpkin" soup but I thought what the hell, it is fall and I needed something to compliment a simple vegan casserole! Wow was I surprised! This soup is fantastic and my fussy guests were also dumbfounded! This is a great and easy soup to make. It has a taste that comes out after you sort of swallow it - a wonderful after taste. This is a new fav for fall!!

I loved this soup. I used regular coconut milk, not the lite. I did reduce the  coconut oil to about 1 tbsp. I skipped the coriander as I don't care for it and I did it add two small spicy sausages (casings removed) to appease the husband. This recipe is def a keeper.

truly a delicious blending of flavors that will appeal to many palettes. I made this for a friend for her October wedding. Because the meal was large it served 16 people and they all raved about it, even from a part of the country that prefers Bland Foods. I used organic ingredients for 99 percent of it. I also used an immersion blender which made it far simpler. Wonderful to work with the tools we have :-)

So I had left over pumpkin from pies I made at Thanksgiving.  A friend Adria said, use it for a soup.  We made it and took it  to a potluck.  It tasted really good. It has a savory kick to it, but not overwhelming at all.

Loved this but made incorporated a few changes: cut the oil down to just enough to saute the onions, doubled all spices, added 1 tsp cinnamon, added 1 tsp ginger, replaced the red pepper flakes w/ cayenne pepper (1/4 tsp), added 1/2 pkg of low-fat cream cheese (at the end, then blended with a hand blender to smooth it out). Wonderful, will definitely be making again!

This soup was truly wonderful as is.   My sister and I love the spicy soups so we did put in 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes and it was not too spicy at all.....just perfect.  We will be making this again and next time I am making a double bath so there is plenty for left overs.  It is actually better on day two.   I may add extra teaspoon of curry bc we love spicy soups.  But honestly just as is I give 5 stars.  No edits required for this to be an excellent soup with excellent flavor.   You can add more salt if desired once served.  Thank you!

Lots of flavor but will leave out red pepper flakes next time.  My one-year-old granddaughter loved it. I gave her a few spoonfuls and she let me know she wanted MORE.  Next time without the pepper flakes.  I added a vegetable-barley.blend to it for my second bowl.  Thanks for sharing recipe.

This is out of this world good! And major easy! Just a couple of tweets: I used Chicken and beef broth. I used regular (not light) coconut milk. I added a little turmeric, cinnamon and nutmeg. I didn't put in blender. Didn't have to. My family thinks I'm the best cook, ever, after this one. Can't wait to do for thanksgiving.

Amazing soup. One of our favorite fall recipes that we make again and again. We add about three times the called for cayenne to spice it up a bit and serve with toasted Asiago bread. Love it!

The soup was delicious! Did need a bit more spice, though, so as it's simmering, I added another teaspoon of curry powder at the end to cook in with the pumpkin and coconut milk, and that did it! I don't normally like red pepper flakes, but I didn't find them too overwhelming!

Just made this for dinner and it came out perfect on all aspects; taste, texture, and color. I made some modifications though. Added a half spoon of turmeric to the spices, added the spices to the frying onion and garlic to release the taste and aroma, used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth, didn't have coconut oil so I used sesame oil instead (always like to use it in Asian recipes and carries anyway) and finally as I was using fresh pumpkin I chose to add it a bit early to the boiling broth to make sure it is cooked thoroughly. Overall amazing recipe and highly recommend it

Added a little extra coconut milk simply because I didn't want to waste what little was left...super good recipe, will definitely make this again.

My wife isn't vegetarian like me but she's freaking over this soup.

We also like more texture, so omitted the blender step.  In addition, I minced fresh ginger and sauteed it with the onion & garlic in unrefined organic coconut oil. NICE aroma!  We had frozen our pumpkin from the fall, so used this and some fresh chicken broth with the coconut milk.  (Yes, always dilute the coconut cream!)  Added some cilantro & chives from our herb garden at the end, and voila!  Perfect!

I made it; it was very bland but spicy hot so I made some adjustments. Added more salt to taste (maybe another 1/4 tsp) and half of a small lemon.
Also, I used my hand blender instead of a regular blender.
I really liked it after that, but next time will reduce the pepper flakes to about 1/8 tsp.

I used 2 cut up pumpkins and boiled them down. Then I strained as much water out as I could. I quadrupled the recipe,  used cumin instead of coriander, and then followed the the rest as written.   I ended up with a gallon and a half of soup and the equivalent of 3 cans of pumpkin. So far it's a hit. I hope everyone at out Thanksgiving dinner thinks the same so I can unload on leftovers. I will definitely make this again.

great idea! I'll annoy everyone with my changes, but I cut the veggie broth in half, trippled the curry (I used garam masala), and added gnocchi and parsnips. Turned it from a side dish to a delicious main dish.

Made this to use up frozen pumpkin from last fall.  Delicious.  I hate when people make major changes and still try to rate a recipe, but I have to say that I did make one major, and one minor change.  The major one was that I had some sweet mini peppers so I sauteed them with the onions and blended that up in the mix.  The minor one was I left the coriander out.  I was given a curry spice sampler tin, and I used the half a regular yellow curry spice and half a berbere spice, which is from Ethiopia and is very much like a hotter red pepper curry spice.  The kick was perfect in this recipe.  Finally I toasted a few pepitas just to sprinkle on top of each bowl.  Personally, I think the recipe would have been creamy and tasty enough with the coconut milk left out.

I had chicken stock on hand so I substituted that for the veggie stock. I used butter and olive oil in place of the coconut oil.  It worked out really well.  In love with this soup.  Thanks for the recipe-even though I had to tweak it.

I was curious about this recipe when I saw it, so I decided to make it today since it is cold and gloomy outside.  Its a perfect day for a warm comforting soup.  I followed the directions exactly, except for adding 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper instead of flakes and adding a 1/4 tsp of ginger as well.  I have never been a big fan of curry, but it is so good with the other flavors here.  I love the layers of flavors.  I also made cornbread to go with it.  I would add, don't rush the 20 minutes of boiling the broth...it really melds the flavors and reduces the soup so it will not be runny.  Thanks for the recipe, I will make it again.

I left out the salt as the vegetable broth already had a little in it and we added 2 cloves of garlic. Everyone loved it. I also added a little extra coconut cream as a garnish as in the photo. I will make this again for Thanksgiving and float some pumpkin seeds on top.

This was amazing! I made the non-vegan version: chicken broth instead of vegetable broth, and heavy cream instead of coconut milk just because those were what I had in my cupboards, but I honestly think that following the recipe verbatim would produce equally tasty results.

Excellent!  The light coconut milk is exactly what my recipe was missing.  I used olive oil and chicken broth, and added some ginger and tumeric to spice it up a bit. This is my go-to lunch throughout the winter.

I love this soup!  I made a few changes: I only used 2 Tbsp coconut oil and i added about a half can more pumpkin to make it thicker.  Also, it definitely doesn't need 1/2 teaspoon salt-- just maybe a smidge at the end.  The broth already adds a lot of salt.

Very good, but made changes. No oil, beef stalk (all I had on hand), chili pepper paste instead of flakes, fresh pumpkin, one red bell pepper, one tbsp of coconut milk powder instead of milk, ginger and cinnamon and extra salt to taste. Delish.

Very good soup, found the curry a bit overpowering so would cut it to 1 tbsp next time. I also prefer a thinner consistency; would either skip the flour/roux step or just add more broth.

You can also substitute the coconut oil with butter or margarine, so tasty that way! Just not calorie-wise. Also if you don't have a blender use onion and garlic powder instead of fresh ingredients. I used 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder and 1 tbsp of onion powder. Just whisk vigorously while cooking and it will give a nice thick consistency. Enjoy!

Made this tonight and stayed fairly close to the original recipe.  Did not have coriander, so I left it out and threw a bay leaf in to boil.I used an emulsion blender in the pot.  My husband who is not a big fan of curry LOVED this and so did I.  The amt of crushed red pepper was enough to add a little "heat" but not too much for us.  YUMMMM, perfect Fall soup.

This is a wonderful soup! Very hearty and appealing to most palettes. I've made this twice for the Community Dinner where we live. The kids Love it and so did the adults. With it being vegan and gluten free, there's very little not to love. Bravo and thanks.

I followed the recipe exactly the first time and thought it was delicious.  The next time I made it, I added a little more garlic and 1/4 tsp. ground ginger.  Before serving, I sprinkled with 1 tablespoon toasted pumpkin seeds and topped it with a spoonful of fat free Greek yogurt.  If you use the yogurt, it is no longer vegan.  I am a vegetarian, not vegan, so this was OK with me.  It gives the soup a creamy, silky texture and provides a nice tang.  This is definitely a lovely fall soup with a kick from the spices.  I will be making it often.

We made this as written.  I don't think we used the appropriate pumpkin variety nor did we strain the lemongrass.  As a result, there was a hint of bitterness. I will try this recipe once more with the suggestions above.  As a side note, someone else had originally prepared it and shared the recipe - it was magnificent.  So it has potential.

Great soup!!  I read all the reviews and made some changes of my own.  Used a little less than 1/4 cup olive oil to saute the onions and garlic.  I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth.  Since the chicken broth wasn't low sodium, I omitted the salt.  Upped the garlic to 2 cloves, and added in 1/4 tsp turmeric, 1/4 tsp garam masala, and 1/4 tsp pepper.  Had a pretty big kick from the red pepper flakes.  This recipe is a keeper for me!

As always, I can't rate based on exact recipe.  We like Thai/eastern food. So this is what I did.  1 TBL yellow curry paste instead of curry powder (I never did like the curry powder) 1 tsp garam Marsala. Curry paste is hot and Marsala has coriander, so I left out those 2 ingredients. I used whole fat coconut milk and didn't think it was too rich as JPMJ commented.  It actually wasn't creamy at all.  If I would have had Greek Yogurt or Sour Cream, I would have added a dollop to each bowl.

I loved this recipe...but I did change just a bit.  I thought it needed a little more salt and I added turmeric.  I also added grilled shrimp to my bowl of soup...phenomenal!

Made this tonight and achieved "most favored wife" status.  ;-)  Highly recommended.  Made a couple of minor modifications:
- Used G. Washington's Golden Seasoning and Broth instead of the broth
and
- Added a cup or so of frozen spinach just for added nutrition.  It made the color kind of funky, but it was delicious nonetheless.

Some friends and I made this recipe en masse to feed hungry college and graduate students for a community meal. Very high reviews--and vegan and gluten free--two musts for our crowd. Will definitely make again.

I love the spice of this soup. I have become nearly addicted. It is so easy to make, and delicious with a bit of toast. On average I make a big batch of this every two weeks! Even my kids like it if I leave out the "hot" stuff.

I have made this soup several times and it is devoured within the day!  Last time I doubled the recipie and halved the red pepper and I liked it a little better.  I also use fresh pumpkin that I've boiled and use the water from the pumpkin for the broth.

Modified this and it was the best soup I've ever made! Used fresh pumpkin (my jack o lantern) and A LOT of fresh ginger instead or garlic or onions. Omitted coconut oil but put in the whole can of coconut milk (400ml). So really, this become pumpkin-ginger-coconut-curry soup. But oh so good!

loved this soup. I added Cayenne pepper instead of red pepper flakes, and added tons of extra garlic and curry powder (I like spicy), and used olive oil instead of coconut oil (I'm not a fan of coconut oil). I loved this so much I made a double batch the second time 'round. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

Fantastic! I along with many others added a dash of ginger and cinnamon just because I like it that way, but the recipe is great as is. I didn't blend it. Maybe once I get an immersion blender I'll do it but I don't think it's worth the hassle with a regular blender and I like the chunks.

Yum! Loved it, as did my kids.
**Update**
Have made this several times since and have always used organic ingredients. Tried it this time with regular pumpkin and it was way too bland and not even as vibrant in colour - stick with organic!

I thought this was really good base recipe. I had leftover Cinderella pumpkin puree from making a pie and this was the perfect use for it. I merged this recipe with one for Curried Pumpkin Soup on Epicurious. I used the spices called for in the other recipe, scaled to this one: 1T minced fresh ginger, 2 tsp cumin, 1/2 tsp coriander, 1/16 tsp cardamom [which I realize doesn't really make this a curry]. I also used about double the red pepper flakes called for as I liked the heat, and added about a half cup more pumpkin. This combination had a definite, pleasant undercurrent of heat. My dining companion, who thought it was a bit too hot, said that next time he'd throw in some chicken and butter with the onion, reduce the broth, and add real cream instead of coconut cream. We really didn't get any discernable coconut flavor in our batch, though I thought it was perfectly creamy (I don't like creamed soups). Nice base recipe to play with!

A little too much curry for me.  I think if I had left it out, it would have brought out the pumpkin.  I did use a fresh pumpkin, yum!

I am not the most skilled cook, but I thought this soup was very easy to make, and very delicious.  I had some rice noodles on hand so when I re-heated the leftovers I added cooked noodles to the soup, and garnished with pine nuts (as suggested by a previous reviewer) and a little bit of fresh cilantro...just because I like it.  Very good recipe, I will keep this one!!
