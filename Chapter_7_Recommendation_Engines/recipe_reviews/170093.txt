Very tasty hot sauce. I couldn't find any fresh oregano so I used a lesser of the dried stuff. I think that using fresh would have improved lots and will definitely try with fresh next time. Also, it wasn't as hot as I would have liked (I like it quite hot), next time will be doubling or tripling quantity of habanero.

Fantastic sauce! My 15 year daughter made it for me as we have a plethora of habaneros this year. I make other sauces as well but I wanted one that everybody ( not just the 800,000 scoville nuts) would enjoy. Used "Black Prince" tomatoes and  I can serve this on eggs, fish and pork. We will make this sauce again, thanks Jim!!
