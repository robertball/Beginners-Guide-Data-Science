This is good, but try it with Jack Daniels (or bourbon) instead of wine.  Also, sauce has a little more flavor if you add a tablespoon of chopped green onions instead of chives.  This recipe is good as a buffet dish because it can be served at room temperature.

This was a great recipe! It was so easy to make (so easy I was skeptical at first), but it tasted wonderful, and the pork was so tender.  My husband even asked afterwards how I'd made it, and when he heard how easy the recipe was, tried it himself (and it worked for him too).

I added some cracked black pepper to the marinade (not much - a few twists) and baked the meat for longer than the recipe said - about 1 1/2 hours.  For the mustard sauce I didn't have mustard powder so I substituted 1 teaspoon creole mustard, 1 teaspoon yellow mustard and 1 teaspoon prepared horseradish.

Simply awesome!

This is a really good pork tenderloin recipe.  I used bourbon instead of wine and the pork didn't really need the mustard sauce. It was fine by itself.  Although, the mustard sauce is to die for and I will use that on beef or anything else I can thing of! Be sure to use chives in the mustard sauce, it does make a difference.

This was a hit!  I didn't have 8 hours to marinade the meat, but a couple hours is even enough to capture some of the flavor and make the meat extra tender.  Instead of baking, I put the meat on my George Foreman rotisserie.  Everyone loves the mustard sauce.  I would even use it with beef tenderloin.

I substituted balsalmic vinigar for the red wine because that's all I had, and it turned out great. Very flavorful and the sauce was to die for!!

My husband raved about this.  It made the house smell wonderful!  The kids loved the meat, but thought the cream sauce was a little strong.  DH loved the cream sauce, so I won't try to alter it.  At first he thought it had horseradish in it, which he loves.  I would make this for company in a heartbeat.

This is really, really great! The pork is terrific by itself, and like others, I used extra mustard. The sauce is better the next day, so put it together the night before, too. Spring for the chives!

I only use the marinade from this recipe, and it was fantastic.  I was concerned about how it would turn out because I was making it for company, and it didn't smell appetizing right before I cooked it, but it was really delicious.  I was making Pork Tenderloin with Dijon Marsala Sauce from this site and this marinade just sounded like a good fit.  I highly recommend using this marinade with the Dijon Marsala sauce, although this mustard sauce is probably good, too.

This could easily have been much better than it was, merely by separating the sauce from the meat and choosing one or the other.  The two together was an odd combination that just didn’t work well -  a sort of teriyaki-ish meat  with a (hot) mustardy, mayonnaise-y  sauce.  And hot it was!! After  I mixed it up I knew if I couldn’t tolerate it Hubs never would, so  I added quite a bit more sour cream and mayonnaise to tone it down – and it was still too hot. It ended up discarded.  As for the meat, it was good enough on its own I guess, without the sauce that only made it kind of strange.  Also, I preferred to roast this at 425 degrees, about 25 minutes; much better than the low and slow time and temperature directed.  Interesting to try, but I wouldn’t consider repeating this.

I got a little nervous when making this recipe. I was afraid my family was not going to like it.  Boy, was I wrong.  Everyone raved about it.  I believe the mustard sauce made it really yummy!

This was one of the easiest and most delicious recipes I have ever made.  I did add fresh garlic, ginger & a little pepper to the marinade.  I also added slightly less mustard only because it was really really hot - almost unbearably hot!!(& I LOVE hot food).  I did the marinade & the sauce the day before so all I had to do was put the pork loin in the oven and 20 min before it was done just steam some veggies for a side - Amazing.  This will be added as a regular staple to our dinner menu.(**UPDATE**  I have made this recipe now probably 8 times - I find it is crucial to make the mustard sauce the day before to allow time for the flavors to merry - it is still delicious & one of our household favorites)

I have made a variation of this recipe that never fails to garner compliments. I use 1/4  cup of Jim Beam Bourbon with the 1/4 cup of soy and 2 tblspn of brown sugar. Put into a Ziplock bag and turn once or twice.  Marinate at least 24 hours. The mustard sauce I make is 1/3 cup of mayo, 1/3 cup of sour cream, 1 1/2 tspn. Dry mustard powder, 1/2 tspn. White vinegar and 2 green onions finely chopped. Refrigerate the sauce overnight. Roast tenderloins on a rack at 350 degrees for approx. 50 ministers. Slice thin and serve with mustard sauce on the side for dipping. Excellent with Far East brand almond rice pilaf and steamed baby peas. Delicious, easy and most of the prep can be done the day before. When pork tenderloin is on sale, I marinate several and then freeze them uncooked. You can pull one or two from the freezer and be ready to go anytime.

Add about a tablespoon of honey to the mustard sauce if you don't like the sharp hot flavor.  Some of the reviewers indicated they didn't like the mustard sauce and the honey with it is excellent!  The only thing I changed with the marinate was I added a clove of garlic.  I serve the pork with glazed carrots, scalloped potatoes and buttered broccoli.  The mustard sauce complemented the pork beautifully.

I thought this was okay.  I downsized the amount of mustard powder as some others suggested, but I wished I hadn't.  I think this would have been much better if there had been more spice from the mustard.  Both my dad and my brother gave compliments, though, so it seems they liked it.

I made this for a dinner party on Saturday night.  I marinated the pork overnight and made the dipping sauce the day before.  I adjusted the sauce by reducing the mustard powder to 1 tsp and added 1 Tbl white vinegar.  It was absolutely perfect, the meat was so tender and flavorful and everyone went back for seconds.  This would also be great cooked on the grill.  Thank you for a wonderful and easy recipe.

It paid to read the former reviews before making this recipe.  I took the advice and used bourbon instead of wine, along with using dijon mustard instead of ground mustard.  I also used green onions instead of chives, but I'm sure that the chives would be good, too.  Folks, do NOT over cook tenderloin!!!  I got it up to 145F and by the time I let it "rest," it was probably at least 160F, and waaaaay too cooked (but still delish).  This is a great recipe to pull out when you have guests.  Serve with a nice potato dish and glazed carrots or steamed aparagus (or both).  Perfect Easter meal!

Lovelovelove this dish!! It's the first thing I ever cooked for my in-laws and that should say it all, right?! :) It does take a little longer to cook than an hour, but I always buy a large boneless loin instead of a tenderloin; better on the budget and more leftovers. An absolute winner for any occasion.

I liked the sauce a lot, I don't know if the marinade added too much to it though.  I think if you're not able to marinate it for too long you're not at a loss.  I marinated it for 20 hours but found the sauce to be the best part.  This sauce could be used to dress up chicken, so if you don't want to use a tenderloin you could still make this.  The cilantro mustard sauce from the Rice Krispies Crab Ball Appetizer recipe on this site would also work in this recipe.  I waited a long time for pork tenderloin to be on sale to make this recipe, but found the mustard sauce to be the only memorable part. It would work on other/cheaper meat.

I don't know what I expected but the interesting mix of flavors in this recipe was a tasty surprise!  The sauce has quite a bite, similar to horseradish or wasabi, and it was complemented by the subtle sweetness of the meat.  I marinated the pork longer than I intended, over 24 hrs, and I made the sauce about that far in advance as well.

This is a great recipe. but treat yourself to a meat thermometer and cook til it reads 130.  Remove from the oven and cover with foilf and allow to rest for a couple of minutes to allow the meat to reabsord the juices...

The flavor of the pork tenderloin is very good.  I do NOT recommend pouring all the marinade into the dish and then baking for an hour.  This will most likely burn the marinade and give off a burnt brown sugar smell which adds NOTHING to the flavor of the tenderloin.  Instead, marinate the tenderloin as stated, then salt and pepper the tenderloin in the baking dish and top with some of the marinade occasionally while roasting.  The mustard sauce is very good!

This was very good. I would definitely make it again.  The soy sauce taste was just right, not too strong. Followed the recipe exactly.

Only two small changes, ... a dash of red wine vinegar as well as the red wine in the marinade. And in the fabulous cream sauce, I added wet Dijon plus dry mustard and white pepper. Then I also added a half teaspoon of ground horseradish for tang. I had only dry chives, ... but diced fresh would be incredible! 

This tenderloin marinated for 28 hours as a fluke of timing, ... but was the most tender, moist and flavorful I have ever had. Roasted in the oven about an hour, ... basted three times and served with this heavenly sauce, it was the sort of dish I would serve for my favorite guests, holidays or Royalty.  

Start with plain tenderloins, ... 1 for every two guests, ... marinate as described, ... the longer the better, and you will have a heavenly dish. 

I served this with apples, but you could add tangy greens, potatoes, pickled beets, almost any tangy or savory vegetable. 

So glad I have leftovers!

Well, that was just amazingly wonderful.  Hubby loved it.  When I bought the tenderloin it turned out to be two pieces so after they marinaded (only for 5 hrs) I tied them together.  That worked just fine.  We took them out at 145 degrees and let them sit, they were perfect.  The sauce was great though I admit I put a little less than 1 1/2 tbsp.  So tender and flavourful.  A keeper, thank you so much.

DO NOT CHANGE A THING FOR THIS MARINADE! Mine marinaded for about 5 hours then I cooked it and can I say....OMG! Melt in your mouth good. Hubby said it was the best thing he ever ate! I have had the largest grin on my face since supper last night! I did sub scallions for the chives in my mustard sauce and hubby says he has a new sauce now!  I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could!!!

Absolutely delicious!  I will definitely serve this again.  One note:  Don't be concerned if you can't taste the mustard when you first make the sauce.  The flavor intensifies as it sits.

I made the maranaide for this last night,only thing I changed was I used red wine vinegar,I may change it again to italian dressing next time,I don't know.  But after maranating it all night and cooking it for a hour and basting it every ten minutes or so,it was SO tender! We all loved it,my mother just said she kept tasting something strong in the tenderloin,we figured it had to be the soy sauce but we weren't comlaining about it,it was a good taste,just strong! This is a very good recipe to make again and again.

This recipe was great.  Pork was very tender.  I did tweak the sauce a little by adding a tablespoon of Sweet Baby Rays BQ Sauce.  My family loved it.  I also added the leftovers to a salad with balsamic dressing.

I LOVED THIS! I marinaded this and put it in the freezer until I was ready to make it. The pork was sooo tender. I did not make the sauce because I didn't have all the ingrediants on hand, but next time I will.

First time cooking pork tenderloin, but not the last! This was so easy, great flavor. Didn't need a knife as pork was very juicy and tender - my picky husband loved it. The mustard sauce was great too - added a kick. Followed recipe exactly - wouldn't change a thing. Will definitely make this again!

I was very disappointed with this recipe.  I thought that the marinade was gross and it even had an awful smell while it was cooking.  The pork was nice and tender but the taste was lacking.  The mustard sauce was also disappointing.  I did not realize that it was going to taste like horseradish, so all in all I will NOT be making this recipe again.

Pretty good, the marinade was ok...but I probably wouldn't use it again. I liked the mustard sauce. It went great with broccoli too.

My husband & I LOVE this recipe-it's very simply yet elegant!  The mustard sauce has quite a KICK but we like it-to be on the safe side, I'd recommend starting out with a smaller amount of mustard powder and adding to meet your preference.

The pork tenderloin was average, even after marinating 24 hours.  The lower temp and longer bake time did not help.  The mustard sauce was not good at all.

This was outstanding!  I made it exactly as the recipe calls and it was wonderful.  The mustard sauce is awesome.  Like others, I will make the mustard sauce often and I will include this recipe in my monthly dinners.    Scrumptious.  5 stars!

This recipe is outstanding. The pork is tender, and the flavor is wonderful. I've made it several times, and always get rave reviews. Just a suggestion- make extra of the mustard sauce, keep it in the fridge, and try it on burgers, steaks, roast, you name it. I've had a container of this sauce in the fridge since the first time I made this recipe about a year ago.

The pork turned out very juicy and tender-very good.  However, the sauce was more like a horseradish sauce and neither my husband or I cook tolerate it.

WOW!! Yummy!! Rather than putting the pork tenderloin uncut in the oven, I cut it up about 3/4 of an inch in thickness and poured the marinade over the pork tenderloin medallions. The mustard sauce is stunning!  I added an extra 1/2 teaspoon of mustard powder for an extra kick in the flavor and it turned out great.  I served it with the 'Spanish rice I' recipe and it turned out to be a great combination.  Of course, have a nice bottle of Chardonnay made the meal even more enjoyable!  Great pic by Roxie of the pork tenderloin!

This was absolutely great. I used less mayo and added dijon mustard instead of mustard powder, just to give it a little zing.

I'd give it 5 Stars for just the Pork by itself, but not with the Sauce. I don't see it as a Mustard Sauce, since it tasted like Horseradish! I had to add at least another half a cup of Sour Cream just to take the "Edge" off, it was just way too spicy with all that Mustard Powder. In my Opinion anyway, no Way my Kids could have eaten it. I marinated the Pork overnight and it came out delicious and moist! Took about 75 Minutes to cook and was well done.

Turned out great! Didn't have time to marinade over night, but did for 8 hrs. Made mustard sauce about an hour before needed, should have made the day before as well. I give 5 stars because it was fabulous as was, but I know will be even better the next time I make it. I also took 3-4 oz of the marinade that had been in with the roast for 40 min and made gravy with that and a packet of mushroom gravy mix, water and some sauteed mushrooms. This was some of the best gravy I've made in a while. Even the kids loved all of it (except the mustard sauce). Served with mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli for a wonderful dinner! This is definitely a keeper and something you could feed to vip guests at a dinner party!

I thought this pork loin was very tasty.  Instead of red wine, I used whiskey--scrumptious!!  The tenderloin was so moist and it was perfect even without the mustard sauce.  I did prepare the mustard sauce the night before using only 1/2 tsp of mustard powder (per other reviews)and when I tasted it I didn't like it at all.  I decided to hold off on disgarding the sauce until I was able to try it with the pork and surprisingly my husband and I really enjoyed it.  I will add this recipe to my collection..thanks Therrell Family.

I made this recipe just as it reads for my Mother's Birthday w/ 40+ guests.  It was a smashing hit!  A close friend of my mom's needed the recipe the next day so she could make it for her family.  My husband & daughter don't like pork, but love this!  Thank you for sharing.

This was a hit at a dinner party I had with 2 other couples.  The meat was so tender and tasty.  I did use regular mustard instead of dry as others suggested but would like to try next time with the dry.  Make sure you marinate the meat overnight or at least several hours.

My family loved this meal.  As a weight watcher, I used fat free mayo and sour cream and splenda brown sugar.  They went wild, and loved the fact that they didn't know the calories I just saved them.  This is now theirs and my all time favorite pork recipe.  Thanks!

I marinated the pork overnight in the soy sauce, dark brown sugar and good quality red wine. It turned out wonderful - super tender and succulent, with a really great flavor. The mustard sauce was ok but not nearly as good as I expected. I actually mic'd it for 30 seconds as I didn't like the idea of chilled sauce on warm meat. Anyhow, this was a very nice meal. Thanks!

The most tender, moist pork tenderloin I have ever served. The marinade adds just enough flavor, but doesn't overpower. My husband added horseradish to the mustard sauce and our guests loved it.

The marinade for this recipe was wonderful!  I used low sodium soy and added 2 cloves of garlic!  Will use again!  Didn't use the sauce (don't like dry mustard).  Just really rating the marinade here!  Thanks will use in future.

This was an excellent recipe, we throughly enjoyed the pork. It was very tender,and the mustard sauce was an excellent accompaniment. I followed the recipe exactly, except I added green onions and garlic to the mustard sauce.  I followed other reviewers recommendations and made the sauce the night before, which I agree is necessary as it doesn't taste very good right after making.Will definitely make this again!

This was very good!  The tenderloin was moist, the marinade added nice flavor to the pork and  the mustard sauce was a good compliment.  My only minor complaint is that mine didn't look too appetizing.  The red wine/soy sauce turns it a grey-purple.

I'm generous with my stars because I know that I only try the highest rated dishes.  This one was fairly simple and I had all of the ingredients on hand.  My 3 year old liked the pork too (w/out mustard sauce)!  The mustard powder really does change the kick to the sauce, so add according to your tastes.

This 5-star rating is for the mustard sauce only, as I didn’t use the marinade in this recipe.  Hubs and I served grilled pork tenderloins for the 3rd annual AR Buckeye Bash that we hosted last week.  This mustard sauce pairs beautifully with pork.  I made it a day ahead of time, and I did use the full amount of mustard powder.  In doing so, I think the “heat” from the mustard mellowed a bit.  This has a horseradish-type heat, in fact some people thought it was horseradish sauce, including my Hubs.  If you’re concerned about the amount of mustard powder, add it to taste.  You can always add more before serving if need be.  And use fresh chives!  You just won’t get the same flavor using dried.

This was great!I didn`t make the mustard sauce, but only the marinade, and the meat tasted delicious!!!! I added a teaspoon of mustard and honey into the marinade, and meat was really good! I used the meat to prepare burritos, best ever! It`s a keeper!

This was just awesome.  I am new to cooking and this was easy to follow and had great results.  The mustard sauce added the perfect amount of zing.  Even without the sauce, the loin marinade is something I will use again and again because it made the meat so tasty and tender.

This recipe was good, but didn't rate being our next family favorite.  The sauce was great, but I think the cooking time for the pork was excessive and caused the pork to be a little on the dry side. I will use the sauce again, but I will pass on the marinde. Sorry.

this was good but I thought the marinade needed something - and the mustard sauce was a little hot - my kids couldn't eat it.  The pork tenderloin was very tender.  Next time I will add something to the marinade and do less mustard on the sauce.

Although I thought this dish was okay, the rest of my family didn't really like it.  I have a different pork tenderloin recipe I make with a rosemary rub and they much preferred that.  I thought that this marinade, going just by the recipe, would probably be very good for grilled chicken (or other grilled meats).  It had a bit of a strong taste for a roasted dish.  I also thought the mustard sauce was overly spicy.  I might try this again using Jack Daniels instead of wine, as someone else suggested, and forego the mustard sauce.

This was a great recipe.  The mustard was fantastic, we used it on sandwiches afterwards and it was great with the pork.  It was almost a shame because the juices the pork cooked in also made a great sauce.  Did't know which to use, didnt want to waste either.  I marinated & made it all in a basting bag, very tender & easy clean up.

I marinated the pork for only an hour and it turned out good.  The mustard sauce was ok.  A little too much mustard powder for my taste.  I olny used half the required amount and it was still a little much. Over all, I enjoyed thid dish, but it's not something I would make again.

We didn't care for this recipe with the red wine, however with white, it is a 10 star recipe.  My family also prefers a stronger mustard sauce so I use 2 tablespoons of mustard powder.  You can't go wrong with this recipe!

It's almost a guarantee that pork tenderloin is...well...tender. After marinating overnight and roasting for the perscribed time this recipe does deliver in that respect. The flavour  imparted by the marinade was just so-so. I didn't care for the mustard sauce either. Everyone ate their dinner without complaint but it's not something I will make again. Thanks anyway.

WOW!!!  This was spectacular!!  The only change I made was to the mustard sauce.  I substituted 3 T of Dijon Mustard for the Mustard powder.  The tenerloin was so amazingly tender and juicy and the sauce was great on the side.  My family loved this!

Wow! This was super impressive! I still can't get over how great it tasted, and how simple it was. I didn't have red wine so I used white and a couple of dashes of red wine vinegar. Hubby liked how tender it was and has proclaimed this one of his favorite pork recipes. The mustard sauce was very tasty as well, but the pork tasted just fine without it.

Excellent marinade for pork tenderloin - and super easy. We wanted to continue the wine theme, so we paired with the dijon marsala sauce from the "Pork Tenderloin with Dijon Marsala Sauce" recipe on this site. Out of this world!!

This rating is just for the pork as I didn't have the ingredients for the mustard sauce. The pork was superb. Tender and juicy. Used it for sandwiches in my husband's lunch for the rest of the week and made all his co-workers jealous. Will definitely make again.

Although I didn't even marinate the tenderloin, I'm giving it 5 stars for the delish mustard sauce.  SO easy.  For an extra kick, we added horseradish and it was sooo good.  I just seasoned the meat with McCormick steak seasoning, roasted at 350 for a longer time (45 min) and it was very moist.  Added broth on top half way through and basted several times.  You've gotta try this!

This is an awesome marinade and it's so easy to make. The mustard sauce was very good but not required.

My entire family loves this, and my husband can't stop raving about what a "wonderful cook" his wife has become! :-) Super easy to make and I love the convenience of make ahead and then pop it in the oven when dinnertime rolls around!

This was really a simple and delicious recipe. Like others, after tasting the mustard sauce, I wasn't too impressed. But, after sitting in the fridge for 24 hours it was delicious on the pork. I did add garlic to the mustard sauce and the marinade. I used a gal. size baggie to marinate the pork in and left it in the fridge for 24 hrs. also. The roast was very tender and had a wonderful flavor. Our friends are always amazed at what comes out of our kitchen. When invited to dinner we rarely have anyone decline.  Thanks for this simple but delicious recipe!!

Great flavor and easy to make.  What more can you ask for?  I don't know if my mustard powder was old, but I didn't like the mustard sauce, so I scrapped that batch and made another using regular yellow mustard.  Much better.

I gave this 3 stars but really I would give the marinade a 5 star rating...it was the mustard sauce which no one cared for in our family.  The marinade gave the meat a great flavour and it was very tender.

This dish wasn't bad. Unfortunately, I didn't have a shallow baking dish on hand that would have fit all of the tenderloin, so I had to use a deep baking dish, which dried out the tenderloin a little bit. I added a little bit more of the ground mustard to the mustard sauce. It was good and ended up tasting like horseradish, but afterwards I felt sick eating it - perhaps eating a straight mayonnaise/sour cream mixture was too heavy.

I was not a fan of this recipe. After making the mustard sauce, I did not use it. We created our own using dijon. I marinated the loin overnight and I was not able to cut it with a fork as some others mentioned. Maybe I did something wrong. Thank you for sharing.

Very good.  I used the slow cooker for this, rather than the oven, so it shredded like pork barbeque does.  Beware of the mustard sauce; I like spicey stuff, but wasn't expecting how spicey this got.  Don't get me wrong, it was good--just don't underestimate it!

This was tasty. My pork did not comes out as tender as it sounds like it did for others, but that was proabably something I did. The marinade had great flavor and so did the sauce. I used all of the mustard powder the recipe called for and it gave the sauce a great kick! Thanks!

This mustard sauce is amazing! It reminds me of a wasabi mayo from a local restaurant. I'm not a huge lover of spicy food, but I added closer to 2 Tbsp of mustard powder and thought it was wonderful. It is a perfect accompaniment to this pork tenderloin - even the kids loved it! A definite keeper... Thanks for sharing it!

My husband hated the mustard sauce but I loved it!  My 3 year old, a super picky eater, ate it up too.  I didn't use mustard powder, well I did but it was pretty awful.  I mixed up a new batch with some plain yellow mustard, much much better!  This is an excellent recipe though, you can buy a cheap cut of meat but with the overnight marinating it is made tender.

This was the most delicious meal I have ever made myself!
I added about a tsp (maybe a bit less) of prepared mustard to the mustard sauce and that gave it a bit more flavour, but this was the only change I made to the recipe.

This was very good.  My husband said "it's a keeper".  You definitely need to let the marinade and sauce sit overnight.  Neither of them tasted good at all right after making them but after the flavors have blended for a while they taste much better.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the sauce does have quite a kick so you'll have to like that - I thought it tasted like there was horseradish in it but I like that.

The pork is excellent! The mustard sauce needs a little tweaking. I added a small amount of prepared yellow mustard which helped the taste. Will most definitely make this again.

This recipe was well received by my family. I did add crushed garlic to the marinade. I did marinate it overnight and all through the day. I wasn't sure if anyone would go for the mustard sauce, but I did make it. I made it the day before as recommended and had to use dried chives since that was all I had on hand. Per other suggestions I did use only 1 tsp. of the dried mustard. To my surprise everyone thought it was a nice compliment to the meat. If you are serving this to meat lovers, do not expect to get 8 servings out of this recipe. For big meat eaters you will get 4 maybe 5 servings max.

This was very good!  Cut the recipe in 1/2 for a smaller tenderloin, but followed adjusted ingredients to the letter with minor exception of mustard powder for the sauce:  Did not have enough powder on hand, so added some regular yellow mustard and it tasted just fine. However, I did cut back on the total amount of mustard indicated. Will definitely save this and make again.

I thought this was excellent. I followed the marinade exactly. I subbed plain, nonfat Greek yogurt for the sour cream and used the olive oil mayo for the sauce and it was delicious. 

We put the slices onto rolls and had it like a sandwich with the sauce as a spread. Two thumbs up!

This pork was rather tasty and was a hit with my whole family.  I used a pork shoulder since I didn't have tenderloin and cooked it in my slow cooker and it turned out very tender (cooked it on low with the marinade for 8 hours).  I had lots of drippings which made a lovely gravy (cooked on stove top).  The mustard sauce seemed to be missing something, so I added a bit of honey and that seemed to do the trick.  Overall, a hit with my family, quick to put together and easy to prepare.  This one's a keeper!

Excellent, very tender, I took the advice of others and cut the mustard amount down some, but still spicy.  Had a great flavor.  Will make again!

The pork was good, I thought the sauce needed a little something.  I wasn't a huge fan of the chives, I was thinking of substituting basil to give it more of a refreshing flavor to go with the spice of the mustard.  Not sure how that would be though....Maybe scallions in place of chives would work.  I'll probably try this again some day but tweak it.

This would be perfect, except I don't like the amount of mayo in the sauce.  It's much better (and lower in fat) if you use mostly light sour cream or plain yogurt, and just a little mayo for flavor and texture. The pork is great though, five stars for that.

The sauce was amazing! It tasted like wasabi mayo. I have since used it on sandwiches and with beef.  I followed the recipe exactly and the pork was also excellent.

The tenderloin is excellent and could stand without the sauce, but the sauce is also good.  Kind of like a horseradish sauce, but with the dray mustard rather than horseradish.

Loved it!  Loved the marinade and the mustard sauce!  I did make the sauce and marinate the meat 24 hours ahead and I think it made all the difference (especially with the sauce).  Will definitely make this again and maybe even try it with a beef roast!

This was delicious, and my husband loved it. It is something easy to get ready the night before and just put in the oven the next day. The meat was very moist and had a delicious flavor from the marinade. We loved the mustard sauce. It was similar to chinese hot mustard and may be too spicy for some, but the mustard could easily be decreased.

made this tonight and it was just ok for me. I did marinade it all night and made mustard sauce too at  same time. I have made many pork tenderloins, and I hardly ever  marinade , just rub spices on and  your  good to go. They will always come out tender unless of course you over cook it. And I did only use 1 tbsp of mustard in sauce and it has a kick to it. I didnt  care  for the taste  and neither did my  BF. Will I make  again maybe...

The marinade for this recipe is excellent. The pork was very moist and tasty. Instead of the mayo/sour cream sauce, I tried the Dijon Marsala Sauce posted on this site which worked perfectly.

I had no time for marinating, so I just browned the tenderloin in my dutch oven, threw in the marinade and baked in the oven for about 40 min.  The flavor was really yummy.  I can only imagine how much more yummy it would have been if I had had the time to marinate it.  I was a little skeptical about how well the sauce would go with the semi-sweet/salty pork, but it was a wonderful compliment!  I hate using mustard powder, so I tried what another reviewer did - I used some spicy brown mustard, a little dijon, and a spoonful of horseradish.  WOW!  I couldn't get enough of it.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I can't remember having a pork tenderloin this tender. Absolutely wonderful. The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is that we weren't crazy about the sauce.

The pork roast itself was quite nice although a little dry. However, the mustard sauce was atrocious. It was so bitter no one could tolerate it. I used my usual Keen's Mustard Powder in the prescribed amount but I'm wondering if there may be a difference between the mustards available here in Canada and those used in the U.S.? At any rate, I will perhaps make the roast marinade again, but NEVER the sauce.

very good; mustard sauce has a nice "horseradish" kick to it.  Unless you like your meat red in the center, plan on cooking longer than one hour. I bumped up temp and added half an hour.

An easy-to-prepare marinade. After readng the other reviews I added 1 clove of minced garlic and pepper to it, and would add ginger next time. I also added garlic (again, 1 clove minced) to the sauce, and halved the mustard - and even with this reduction, the sauce was still on the 'hot side'. It did compliment the pork well.

The pork tenderloin was fantastic!  I marinated it over night and then some.  It was moist and very flavorful.  However the mustard sauce was not as good,  I tried it and I was quite disapointed.  I ended up making my own.  I used equal parts mayo, and sour cream.  Then I added some grainy dijon mustard, and a little prepared mustard. (mainly for the color).  I also chopped up some chives and threw them in.  My husband loved it.  I made it for valentines and it was a big hit!  My husband thought we were eating at a gourmet restaurant!

We really liked this recipe.  Easy and flavorful, and the meat was quite tender.  I didn't have any chives (fresh or othewise)for the side sauce, so I threw in about 1/2 tsp of dill weed.  Not bad.  As other reviewers have said, it did tast a lot like horseradish.  This is a recipe I'll use many times.  Thanks for the post.

The marinade was nice but not quite as potent as I anticipated, however, the sauce was such a pleasant addition and so simple to make. Takes only a few seconds to whip up and then let the flavors mellow for as long as possible in the fridge. Everything is always on hand. I added a few chives for a little color and leftover sauce is good for a sandwich spread instead of mayo. Certainly a keeper recipe and how nice to add the sauce for what is otherwise a rather blah looking cut of meat. Gives it a little extra ZING !

Very good.  I didn't marinate it like I was supposed to so I bet these would have been even better.  It was so easy to make to!  You could probably do this in the crockpot.  The extra "dipping sauce" was horrible when I taste tested it but it was fabulous with the meat.  Hmmm...strange...  Anyways, this will definately stay in my rotation.

WOW!  This is absolutely the most delicious pork roast I've ever had, and so easy to make.  I added some crushed garlic to the marinade and marinated it in an oven bag, in which I cooked it the next day.  I used a little more low fat sour cream and a little less mayonnaise to cut back on the fat and it was fantastic, perfect for pork roast sandwiches the following day.

I thought this was ok.  Not as special as the previous reviews lead me to believe.  I did add fresh minced garlic to the marinade to add some flavor but although the pork was very tender and perfectly cooked, the taste was nothing great.  

I did like the mustard sauce, but the recipe makes way more than you will need.  It has quite a kick to it though!  We liked it - I would make the sauce again for roast beef or to use in sandwiches.  Don't know if I would bother with the pork again.

The marinade for this was delicious and  simple. I enjoyed the mustard sauce, but my husband and kids didn't. If I could have given this 4 1/2 stars, I would have. But we'll definitely have this again.

This recipe was so easy to make and it looked so good on a platter garnished with roast potatoes and roasted veggies. The meat was so tender we didn't even need a knife. My guests loved every bite. I spooned the marinade that I cooked with the tenderloin and it was very tasty but everyone loved the mustard sauce too.

I really liked the marinade and will use it again, it adds lots of flavor and tastes great.unfortunately i really did not like the mustard sauce. i did use dried chives instead of fresh (our best grocery store was out) and it had to much bite.

This was super easy and tasted great.  The marinade was perfect.  I marinated the tenderloin about 20 hours, but it turned out perfectly.  Not so strong that you couldn't taste the pork, but it added a great flavor.  Very simple, yet elegant.

I thought this was outstanding.  I loved the flavor of the marinate combined with the mustard and dill in the sauce.  Outstanding flavor, juicy and tender.  I plan to share this recipe with my extended family.

We had this pork loin on Christmas day.  It was great.  My family especially loved the mustard sauce.  It's great for sandwiches with the leftovers, if there are any.

Excellent mustard sauce!!!!  At first, I thought the sauce was icky (I used 1T mustard powder), but the flavors really combined in the fridge overnight.  I'll make this sauce for other things (ham/roast beef sandwiches, etc).  Oh, the pork was great too!

I decided to cook my pork in the slow cooker with this recipe. Since the juices need about 8 hours to mix well anyways, I figured why not mix while they're cooking. It turned out amazing! The meat started to fall apart and it tasted like candy. Everyone loved it as well! So glad I used the slow cooker!

The meat and sauce do not go well together. I have to echo the review that said it was "teriyaki-ish" meat with a "mustard-y, mayonnaise-y" sauce. The meat alone is delicious. The sauce alone is delicious. But the two together are just plain strange and not tasty.

The flavor was ok, a bit overpowering with the wine though. But it was tender and whole family liked it. The mustard sauce seemed like horseradish.

I found that soy and wine do very little in the way of flavour despite long marinade. And mustard certainly needs to be reduced else it crowds out whatever flavour was left in the pork. I shall not use this again - soy and brandy is much better, the less soy the better, too.

I never tweak recipes the first time I use them - otherwise how would one know what the recipe actually tasted like.

Delicious recipe. Home cooks, please pay attention when you shop for pork! There’s a big difference between a pork tenderloin and a pork loin! The flavor, texture and size of these pork roasts are as different as night and day and require different cooking times. Always follow recommended internal temperature guidelines for the cut of meat you are preparing.

Oh yeah, who had their husband wolf down his dinner in less than 3 minutes because he loved what he was eating? This girl. That's right, I made this super easy pork tenderloin and yummy mustard sauce (tastes very close to horseradish) and it was a wonderful night in my house. This recipe is going into my 'make often' recipe binder.

I thought that this recipe was ok.  I marinated the tenderloin over night, hoping for the fullest flavor possible.  It just had a touch of taste and not very moist.  I honestly like the Hormel Teriyaki Tenderloin and think that taste 10 times better without the hassle of using all the ingredients in this.  Also, the sauce was way to mayo tasting.

The pork was wonderful but there must be a misprint on the amount of mustard powder, because, although I cut the amount down to one tablespoon, it was still way too hot - like the spicy mustard served at Chinese restaurants.

This was wonderful! I was a little worried about overcooking the pork. I basted every 10-15 min. or so and it came out perfect! Juicy and tender on the inside and so flavorful. LOVE the mustard sauce! Definitely use the chives and definitely make the sauce the night before to give the flavors more of a kick. I will absolutely be making this again.

I made the recipe as is except for adding red curry powder to the mustard sauce.  My husband and brother liked it a lot.  I did not care for it at all and neither did my kids.  It was a bit dissappointing.

I didn't have time to marinate this for 8 hours - so I came home at lunch sliced the meat, put it in a ziplock and marinated it until after I got home after work. I baked the slices, then topped them with the mustard sauce. My husband absolutely raved about this- something he doesn't ordinarily do! He gave it a definite 5 stars, and said I could make it every week! My 10 year old son also loved it although he ate the meat w/o the mustard sauce. I wasn't quite as thrilled with it- I thought it was OK. Not bad, but not fantastic either. I will be making this again- thanks for sharing the recipe.

I thought this was an excellent recipe.  I used no fat mayo and sour cream and the sauce was still perfectly good, so it made for a very low fat meal as well.  Thanks for sharing!

This was okay.  I think I would add garlic (and ???) to the marinade if I were to make again.  We thought the mustard sauce was gross (strong with no real flavor) so I threw it out and made my own sauce with Dijon mustard, sour cream and chives.

Thanks for the recipe.  My husband thought it was a little mustardy, and as I never measure anything, I may have put too much in.  Next time, will try Lena's suggestion with maybe Dijon and some horseradish.

I followed the recipe to a "T", except I cooked the pork a little longer than it recommended.  It turned out very juicy, and the mustard sauce was a HUGE hit.  I will definitely make this again.

Made this last night, and was it good!  I really liked the mustard sauce.  I did have to cook it longer than 1 hr. (I did it at 350 degrees, too), but it was very tender and flavorful.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I added more dry mustard because when I tasted the sauce i could hardly taste it. 
But it sat in fridge for abt 45 min and WHEWEEEEEEE!!!! Hot! Almost horseradish-ish! Wasn’t bad but too much for me. Next time I will ad about 1/8t extra dry mustard. 
Makes plenty, too! Def enough for 2lbs meat. Marinade is great!

Made this for a large family dinner at Christmas, and it was a smash hit. Marinated the pork strictly as directed, but added 1/4 cup milk (2%) and 1/4 tspn freshly ground black pepper to the sauce for a deeper flavor. Also used fresh green onion instead of chives. The pork was savory and tender, and the sauce was insane.

I took this last night for a July 4th Celebration and it was gone in minutes! This was very good.  The sauce was good but very spicy, I will only use 1/3 of the mustard powder next time.  I had to add 3 tbsp of honey to tone down the mustard powder and then it was perfect for my taste.  The sauce was excellent with the meat.

The cooking time given in this recipe is for a pork loin.   I used a pork tenderloin which only required 20 to 30 minutes in the oven.  The pork was very tender and moist.
We also liked the mustard sauce, very flavourful.  I used dry mustard powder, and it was spicy but not over the top.

weird flavor, sauce was good but did not compliment the meat. Gave it 2 stars because I used the sauce on roast beef sandwiches and it was good. Would not make this again.

I did this with a boneless pork loin.  I doubled the marinade to accommodate the larger roast.  I also substituted tarragon for the chives in the sauce and added a little sugar.  The sauce was outstanding.  It got a thumbs up from my family.  I will make it again, maybe for a holiday.

I absolutely LOVED this...even though I misread the recipe and included the mustard sauce in with the marinade.  It was quite delicious all cooked together!  My husband didn't like it as much, but he's not a big fan of the mustard-y flavor, whereas I LOVE it!!  I will be making this again sometime!

Very good! I'd recommend cutting the mustard powder back to 1 tbs if you don't like a lot of heat. The full recipe tasted like horseradish sauce.

I made this recipe exactly as instructed, except I didn't have chives so used green onions in the sauce,  and it is fabulous.  It has become one of my favorite recipes.  The sauce is absolutely delicious and can be used on any sandwich if you have any left over.

My whole family loved this recipe (including my 85 yr old Mom who is very picky). I followed the recipe exactly as written. I marinated the pork loin for about 20 hours, and made the mustard sauce the day before also. The mustard sauce was bitter by itself, but awesome on the pork! Thanks for a terrific recipe, I have already had a request for it.

I tried this with Red Stag black cherry bourbon as suggested in the comments, and it was fantastic. A dash of black pepper really enhanced the mustard sauce, although I left out the chives because my husband doesn't like them. With the soy in the marinade, this would also go great with a sweet/hot Asian sauce or any kind of horseradish. It's such a simple recipe, and both the marinade and sauce stand alone so well that I'll be sure to go back to it time and again.

I recently found this site before Thanksgiving and everything I made for the big day was great.  This however was just a big fail for our family.  Pork was very moist.  Mustard sauce was too strong, even adding more SC and mayo to lighten the flavor.  Marinade was ok, but the overwhelming response was do not try it again.

This turned out very well, but the original recipe is actually for a pork loin, not a tenderloin (tenderloins are done in about 20 minutes in the oven!) My family loved the sauce, which I added to the roast in the last 20 minutes of cooking so it became sort of a nice gravy. As far as the taste of the sauce, it appears many of the reviewers are mistaking hot chinese dry mustard (which is REALLY hot) for the regular ground mustard we have in our american grocery story spice section.  The two mustards are NOT interchangeable! For this recipe use the regular ground mustard and you will not be disappointed - very tasty, not hot!

I used this recipe for dinner tonight and it turned out rather tasty.  I made the mustard sauce earlier today and added the chives about two hours before dinner, which had an almost horseradish taste to it.   I used the Hormel brand extra lean pork roast @1 lb weight which was plenty.  Had mashed potatoes and vegetable which made a nice meal. Thanks.

This is an easy recipe with everyday ingredients.  The sauce was pretty hot, I will be decreasing the mustard powder.  Got a thumbs up from the whole family!

The mustard sauce is simple and a bit more flavorful with a couple of changes. I substituted a 60z container of plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream and mayo. I used only a tablespoon of ground mustard. I added a little more than 1 tablespoon  and a dash of ground cumin.

This recipe is extremely good.  I did mine with thick pork chops because that is what I had in the freezer.  I didn't end up making the dip so I will have to try that next time.  I used low sodium soy sauce and doubled the Marinade to get good coverage of the meet.  it came out extremely flavorful and moist.  My 4 year old loved it so much she didn't even use ketchup.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

5 Stars for the pork, 0 for the sauce. The first time I tasted the sauce I thought my ingredients must be bad so I threw it out and started over only to find it was just as bad the second time. It's just not even spicy, just unbearably hot; you can't taste the mustard at all. On the brighter side the pork is incredible and has become one of my dad's favorite and most requested dishes. Instead of the 1/3 cup of red wine I just use a berry flavored wine cooler and sometimes add a little garlic. I love that it's so quick and easy!
