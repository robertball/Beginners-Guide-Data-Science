Perfect as is! I didn't add any agave because I don't like my smoothies too sweet, but if you use unsweetened almond milk you may need to. The vanilla extract is a nice touch. The only change I made was to use cashew milk instead of almond milk because that's what I had on hand. I like to blend the oatmeal first on it's own to turn it into a fine powder, then add the rest of the ingredients. Thanks for the recipe Sara!

so good! I added some apple slices since it's fall and a dash of cinnamon. i omitted the agave nectar because I don't have any, but it honestly doesn't need sugar unless you have an unsweetened milk! will make again!

7.31.18  I drink a lot of smoothies, and this will be one that I make again.  I didn’t add the agave nectar, since my strawberries were very sweet, just didn’t need it.  Nice start to the day, and exceptionally easy to make.

I had to make a few changes to the original recipe,  but I liked it quite much. I followed the exact recipe overall, but I didn't use frozen strawberries. I just used some becoming yucky strawberries out of the fridge. To make up for the non frozen berries, I added ice. On the first try, the smoothie did have the pinkish color, but was sorta grainy. The taste was okay, pretty sour even after agave and vanilla extract (probably due to the strawberries not being the sweetest around). The second time around I definitely changed it up a bit more.  I added more almond milk, agave, and a bunch load of frozen blueberries from the back of my freezer. It tasted oh so much better! Next time, ill try and follow the recipe and lil more.

I Didn't have almond milk on hand but used 2% milk instead. Didn't add the sugar or vanilla. But tasted great still! Only con was the hard oat bit.. If there's a solution for that. I think it'll be an even big winner
