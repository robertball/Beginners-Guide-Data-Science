This indeed WAS a wife saver Christmas morning! Easy to throw together the night before. I DID omit the peppers from it only because I'm the only person in the house who likes them. The whole family liked it a lot. Now that I've made it I can see where it could be very easy to play around with it using different meats and such if one were wanting to do so.

Excellent & simple make ahead breakfast casserole. I had no cornflakes or green pepper so I used panko crumbs and upped the red pepper and it was still yummy. Will def make again! Thanks for sharing!

This recipe lends itself to customizing. I liked the ratio of egg/milk custard mixture to bread. I used cubed ham and grated cheddar instead of sliced and I reduced the worcestershire sauce to 1/2 tsp. When I make this again, I would omit the salt. For my taste the ham added enough salt. I really liked the addition of the onion and peppers for flavor and I enjoyed the crunchy topping of corn flakes. I did reduce the butter, also.

This was just OK in my view. Although I baked it the full time it had an overly mushy and soft texture like it wasn't quite set.  Although after sitting for a while and later being refrigerated and reheated, that subsided.  The flavor was a bit odd too.  I'm not sure if was the mustard or what but it wasn't what I was expecting.  Note -- this dish puffs up enormously while baking so make sure you leave plenty of room between it and the upper over rack.  Mine actually got so huge while baking that some of it actually spilled over into the oven and caused some burning & smoking in the oven!

This is a great recipe and I have made it frequently in years past for Christmas and for brunches at work.  Try using ham and I have had great comments when using herb and spice Havarti cheese.  Pimento is another "red" option for festive color.

I used 2  cups of milk due to mushy texture comments. I think the reason it's mushy is the raw onion and red / green pepper also add liquid when cooked.  Instead of regular bread I used a loaf of Brioche bread which is richer and more dense. It soaks up the liquid nicely. I also used crumbled  turkey sausage as we don't eat bacon. I love red and green pepper and added a little bit more than the recipe stated.  It helps to have the wife saver breakfast come to room temperature by having it sit on the counter for 30 min. after taking it out of the fridge.  This will eliminate having to cook it longer than necessary.  Excellent dish!

I did some minor modifications like reducing the amount of bread in order to control carbs and it turned out beautifully. This is very close to my late mother's, from whom I never got her recipe. Thanks and Merry Christmas!

I just made this for breakfast! I was looking for a Christmas Breakfast Casserole and decided to try this. It was delicious! The entire family loved it. I also added Chicken Sausage to the Canadian bacon and it turned out great. I put all of the veggies, seasonings, eggs, butter and milk in a bowl and beat it all together, poured it over the bread, cheese and meats. I didn't have corn flakes so I used Kix instead. LOL. very yummy! Thanks!

I have to say after trying other breakfast casseroles, this was by far the best, in my opinion.  The only substitutions I made were regular bacon for the Canadian bacon and 2 cups shredded cheese for the sliced, as that was what I had.  I was skeptical of the corn flakes on top, but that addition made it so delicious.  This has become my go to for holiday brunches!

This a traditional family Christmas morning breakfast item but I like it so much that I make it year round! I omit the peppers and shred the cheese and sometimes use regular honey ham in place of the back bacon, otherwise follow the recipe exactly and it'll turn out great!  Yes, it does puff up but when it comes out of the oven it relaxes. The corn flakes and butter on top are a MUST, tastes so good!  So, yes, as another reviewer mentioned, if you reduce the butter on top, it will be dry (duh!) so just follow the recipe as written.  It's a winner!

This was just ok for me.  I cut back on the butter to use on top and it was dry.   I served on Christmas morning and my family used ketchup because it was too dry.    I was not impressed .

Thanks for the great recipe.   We only made a couple of modifications, first we cubed the bread, and we forgot the ham, which we were going to substitute for the bacon. It was excellent without the meat anyway. We didn't have cornflakes so we added extra old cheddar cheese to the top

I put the layer of bread on the bottom, but tore up the remaining slices into small pieces and mixed them in with the eggs. This worked great. I used ham, sliced green onions and some chopped smoked red peppers. Used 7 eggs, and made 2x the topping, which was not too much. A friend visiting for Christmas took a very small serving at first, then quickly went back for a larger second serving. My husband loved it. I made fried apples and biscuits to go with it, and it was a wonderful Christmas morning breakfast.

I think this is a Canadian classic, my family has made it for years. Just a little prep and you're off to the races in the morning. I hadn't tried it in a long time, but made it again recently and forgot how good it was! Good for camping too. Thanks for posting.

I love this casserole and have been making it for years. I always trim the crusts off the bread. Sometimes I  change up the bread -- sour dough, multi grain, whatever I have. I've used ham slices in place of pea meal bacon. And I've used different kinds of cheeses too. All depending on what's in the fridge the day before.

I always customize this recipe for a smaller portion because there is only 3 of us.
I don't mind left overs but this recipe is way better when freshly cooked. 
I also use cayenne pepper instead of hot sauce. 
I use sandwich ham. 
And hers the kicker 
I use rice crispys and frosted corn flakes. 
So silly but the combo is to die for.. 
Yummm 
I make this every Christmas morning well night before. 
And sometimes once I a blue moon. 
It is hearty and filling so we try not to eat it often but definitely a one to try or make a tradition

I found this looking for ways to use up left-over corn flakes, and I love it!  I am not a morning person, & we have a lot of overnight guests, so this is ideal.  Being Italian, sometimes I use prosciutto, mozzarella and basil in place of the Canadian bacon and cheddar.  If you want tomato with, or instead of, some of the peppers, I suggest sun-dried.  Fresh added too much moisture.  Works great.  Thanks Toby for sharing.

It was too mushy. I tried to bake it longer, but it didn’t help. Maybe I’d try it again with less liquid.
