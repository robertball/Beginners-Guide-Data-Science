I had never made Guacamole with cream cheese before.  It turned out so creamy.  I did add a few other things like salt, garlic powder, freshly ground pepper, some chopped tomatoes and juice of 1 lime.  Great way to make Guacamole.  It is a keeper! Thanks Server! :)

I played with the ingredients a bit, but made essentially the same thing.  Delicious.  Adding a pinch of dill and fresh garlic is a bit more to my taste.

I made the mistake of bringing this to work for a birthday party. Now I get requests from every department to bring in more!

This recipe is fantastic as is.  But if you are wanting to spice things up here is what i do....I get a small can of chopped jalapenos, drain it and squeeze out any excess juice so guacamole isnt runny, add a little cumin  Then I dump everything in food processor and in 30 seconds and it is the best.  I am now known for my guacamole at parties.  But I never give my recipe out.  If they only knew they could get it here at allrecipes. lol.

I can't tell you how disapointed I was with this recipe.  Other than doubling the recipe, I followed it to a T and yuck!  I didn't want to throw it out, so I doctored it up with cilantro, tomatoes, onion, lime juice, etc, so it would at least be edible.  Even after all the doctoring it was just ok.  I do not recommend this recipe.

Leave cream cheese out to soften (or gently nuke). I inadvertently left off the garlic (minced or powdered) to taste. Enjoy...Great pic, Nandabear.

I get it. I wanted to love it. I thought it was okay. I love guacamole. Avocados are a gift from above with their mild flavor and creaminess. But then you add mild and creamy cream cheese and it just kinda goes bland. I ended up adding salsa to it to try to spice it up a bit more.

This was really good I used the guacamole in a bag from Sam's to speed things up, I was in a hurry. It turned out great! Very tasty.

My children do not like tomatoes or white onions so this is a perfect guacamole for us.

11-28-11: Ann thinks this might need more (fresh, crushed) garlic.
4-27-13:  same this time - Ann added more garlic powder - not garlic salt.

This recipe is my favorite guacamole dip now. My family loves it when I make this. It is by far the best I have ever tasted.
