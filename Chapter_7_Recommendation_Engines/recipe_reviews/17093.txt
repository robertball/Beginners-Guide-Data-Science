Everyone at my birthday party raved when I made this salsa- but you have to add at least an onion and a half to give it some crunch, and I also put in about 2 or 3 jalapeños to make it spicy.  Overall a delicious mix.

this is good but to make it outstanding I added onions, one jalapeno, and squeezed lemon and lime all over. Cutting up fresh tomatoes really makes it great!

Unless you love cilantro, there was waaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyyyyy too much in this recipe, all we could taste was cilantro. Probably the worste salsa I ever had. A waste of time and money.

Fresh tomatoes would be better, but for those of us whose gardens are done producing, this is a great recipe.  Also, it tastes so much better and is so much quicker to just whip it all up in the food processor!

This is the perfect mild salsa. A couple of coworkers don't care for my usual batch of salsa, since I make it really spicy, so I gave this a try. I did throw everything in the food processor, as I usually do. I threw in a seeded jalapeno too, but they can't even tell. :)

It's good.  I did add some onion and a pinch (no more than a pinch) of sugar to cut some of the acidity from the tomatos.

I made this as an appetizer for a dinner party. I only had one can of diced tomatoes on hand so I substituted a can of Rotel for the second can. The Rotel gave it a little extra kick My husband tasted it before our guests arrived and liked it so much I was afraid that there would not be any left  for them. This recipe is a definite keeper! Thanks for sharing.

I tweeked this recipe just bit. I used fresh tomatoes from the garden various types like roma and beef steak tomatoes. I also added sweet bell pepper, small jalapeno black bean and white corn sugar to taste and that makes it good.

Very good but too mild for some. A minced jalapeño would do the trick.  It's a keeper and so easy.

I tasted it as is, which I was surpised that it tasted like salsa with so few ingredients.  I did add a few generous shakes of hot sauce to my taste but it was definitely fine as written

This was really good! I was looking for something quick and easy that used canned diced tomatoes. I actually used one can of petite cut tomatoes and one can of diced tomatoes w/green peppers and onions. I also used 3/4 tbsp dried cilantro and added 1 Tbsp lime juice. Oh, and I added a can of green chilies (mild)Very tasty! Not spicy at all, but I need that for my light weight family ;P

I used fresh tomatoes and added chopped fresh poblano pepper and a little cumin.  I certainly did not use a whole bunch of fresh cilantro...OIY!  That would be TOO much.  I used about 6 stem's worth of leaves chopped fine.  It was VERY good salsa.

I just made this after we got an impromtu basket of hot peppers from my girlfriend. I used this recipe and obiviously added peppers. It only took two to give it a lot of kick. I made it about 20 minutes ago. My family has eaten the entire batch with Tostitos. Awesome and simple recipe.

This recipe was perfect because I didn't have any limes or peppers. I used fresh tomatoes, garlic, and cilantro from my CSA and thought it was delicious.

I am addicted to this recipe!!  It's so simple and easy as a base recipe.  I always add lime juice and jalepeno.  I have added fresh and jar jalepenos and they taste just fine.  Put in seeds if you want some heat. Tonight I added 1/2 of an onion and processed it all really well in my food processor.  My 2 year old son eats it like ice cream!!!  
This recipe, if followed precisely would not have any kick, however, you can add whatever you want and it's great!!!!! Very easy to throw together in a pinch too (if you have the cilantro which is a MUST!!)

Having made this twice (once as written and once following other reviews) , if you like really mild salsa... as written is great , for my preferences it really needs a red onion finely diced, and either 1 can of rotel, and 1 jalopeno with or without seeds seeds, a touch of sugar or sweetner, and just a bit of lime juice, along with garlic and cilantro with a quick spin thru the processor. They make the Rotel with lime juice and cilantro already in it which i will try next time.

This was the first salsa recipe I ever tried and I must say it was delicious. I substituted fresh parsley for the cilantro as we just do not like cilantro....I also added a couple of squirts of lime juice and jalopeno rings from a can, maybe 6....came out perfect.....used my mini processor with onions, j.rings, half a can of diced tomato, 3 cloves of garlic....after processing I added the other half can of diced tomato....nicely chunky....and tasty.

A good foundational salsa recipe, but without onions and 1-1.5 jalepenos it's way too bland. Fresh Tomatoes from the farmer's market help a lot too.  Canned tomatoes are never good in any recipe.

Awesome recipe. Was using raw tomatoes but really wanted a restaurant style salsa. This is it! The stewed canned tomatoes are the secret !
