4 1/2 stars! This was very good!  I used a 16 oz package of Grands Buttermilk biscuits (all I had on hand) and increased the other ingredients by about 1/4 more to compensate.... oh, and I left out the lemon zest because I didn't have it.  I was looking for a quick sweet tooth fix, something in the line of quick cinnamon rolls when I came across this recipe and decided to try it... so glad I did!  I am sure I will make this one again!

REALLY fun to make with my oldest kid. I made no changes or substitutions. Next time, I think I'd use a recipe and a half of the filling. Everyone thought it could use a little more "stuff" on the inside of the rolls. This used on hand ingredients for a nice Saturday morning treat that require special ingredients on a tight budget, which I really appreciated. NOTE: If you have a sweet loving husband like me, make sure you double this for snacking on during the day or for during the week brown-bag lunch treats. He was kind of emo that we ate all of them for breakfast. And by "we", I mean mostly "he".
