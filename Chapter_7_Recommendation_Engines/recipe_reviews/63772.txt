This was the most delicious thing I've ever made! I made a few adustments though a lower fat version. I pounded out the chicken and used 1/4 cup of flour and didn't even use all of it. I seasoned the flour with salt and pepper. I sprayed the pan generously with Pam and sprayed the side of chicken facing up after I put the chicken in the pan. I fried the chicken til done and removed them.I added 1/4 cup of triple sec orange liquor to deglaze the pan and added 1/4 cup heavy cream and 1/4 fat free milk. I added a splash of the lite syrup from the oranges and 1/4 cup of OJ. I used an 11oz. can of mandarin oranges (the whole can drained)I reduced it a little bit. I served it with broccoli and brussel sprouts and wide egg noodles. Yum Yum! p.s. I also added more salt it needs salt!

If you like a very delicate orange flavor then this recipe as it stands is for you. My family and I enjoyed it but were a little disapointed. I will try it again with some additions. Perhaps some orange juice concentrate and adding a splash of the orange liqueur at the end of cooking. On the whole a nice recipe but it "needs something" as my husband said.

As you can see from my photo my oranges fell apart as soon as they got warm which wasn't a horrible thing but unexpected. The other reviews didn't mention this so maybe it was the brand (Festival). I doubled the recipe cut the chicken into bite-size pieces and used penne pasta. I subbed brandy extract and O.J concentrate (quite a bit) for the orange liqueur. I had to add salt and pepper to this as it was a little bland. Hit each serving with a dash of cayenne. I may try this again with a different brand of Mandarins as my husband really loved it. Thanks!

I used this sauce recipe as a drizzle for Pecan Crusted Chicken. It was delish but a little sweet. I added some fresh basil and blendered the whole thing. It was a hit at dinner. Thanks!

I love this dish. It does leave a large amount of extra sauce but it's good on rice.

I was not impressed at all with this recipe. The cream didn't have much flavor and neither did the chicken. Maybe if it was marinated first? I will not be making this one again.

I MUST have done something wrong here. It tasted like boiled chicken with orange alcohol in it. I'm sure it was something I did and not the recipe so please feel free to try it yourself and tell me where I might have gone wrong. Yikes.

Great delicious recipe! Chives optional for picky eaters. I even cut the chicken into smaller bite-sized pieces for the smaller ones and serve over white rice. If looking for an extra spice I have occasionally added crushed red pepper flakes to taste as a nice little kick as well.

I made this and it was wonderful! Perfect summertime dish light and I made it just as the recipe called except for the liquor I used frozen orange juice concentrate for a little more orange flavor. I also added salt and pepper to the flour. Perfect over some egg noodles!
