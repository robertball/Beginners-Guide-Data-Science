I made this according to recipe first (minus the salt) but after I got it all assembled I thought it could use a little more mayonnaise, a little more garlic powder, and because I had it, I threw in one really large chopped celery stalk and some chopped green onion. The honey mustard and jalepeno was an interesting combination, almost like a sweet/sour thing going on. The kids didn't care for it but I liked it. NOTE: The jalepeno I used in this recipe were actually pickled jalapeno rings.

I did not have prepared honey mustard so just used equal parts of yellow mustard and honey.  And I did not have jalapeno peppers so just chopped up some hot giardinierra and added that.  This had loads of flavor and was a nice taste change from "traditional" egg salad.

The idea of this is great, however, for our tastes, it needed a lot more mayo. Added in some minced onion along with garlic and onion powders. Thank you!

Well I wouldn't call it world's best, but it was very delicious.  The pepper added a nice kick!

I made the egg salad as written, but seemed a bit bland, so added a dash of paprika and cumin. That was much better. I liked the jalape√±os instead of dill for a change. I served on a bagel with Romaine lettuce and tomatoes.

Really enjoyed this thanks to the jalapenos!  I added some finely minced red onion and served it on toasted wheat bread with baby spinach and tomatoes.  I definitely prefer this egg salad recipe to dilly ones.

This is my favorite egg salad recipe. I love the bite that the jalapeno gives, I usually use the whole pepper. I also add celery for a little more crunch

The egg salad was very good, adding the jalapenos gave it a great kick! I also added a spicy honey mustard that had habanero in it to add to the kick. Overall, pretty tasty.

I used only 5eggs for two servings and added a handful of coriander/cilantro roughly chopped and smoked Hungarian paprika as well...very healthy and filling...perfect for a quick fix for dinner on a busy weekday...two thumbs up*!
