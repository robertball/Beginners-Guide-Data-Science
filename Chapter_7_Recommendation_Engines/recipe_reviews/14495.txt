Found this fantastic recipe a year ago, have made it several times since for both company and just the family.  It is absolutely delicious and it consistently gets rave reviews.  Here's what I do:  double the marinade, except for the cinnamon.  Mince 2 Tbsp. fresh onion in place of dried.  I try to marinade all day, but I have found that even a few hours is sufficient. I bake the tenderloins in a 400 oven for about 40 min.  And the biggest tip:  take the leftover marinade, boil, and add cornstarch or a flour roux to thicken and make a delicious sauce/gravy. Other Tips - #1) don't leave out the sherry.  It really makes the recipe.  You can buy cream sherry at your local spirits store for around $7 a bottle and you can utlitize it in many recipes. #2) if you are looking for a good side dish to match this pork, try Baked Pineapple Casserole off of this site.  It is excellent!!

Didn't change a thing and it was awesome!  Marinated it for 12 hours.  I don't have an outdoor grill, so I used my cast iron grill pan on the stove.  The best part was the chargrilled outer part -- mmmmmmmm!  Next time I'll probably sear it on the stovetop and finish it off in the oven.  I'll probably also boil and reduce down some of the left over marinade to make a yummy sauce.  This is now officially the only pork tenderloin recipe I'll ever need.  My husband thought it was amazing, as did my very picky ten year old.




Edited to Add -- Made this a week later (couldn't wait any longer, it was that good) and did just that -- I seared it on the grill pan, stuck in a meat thermometer, and finished it off in a 350 oven until it reached 160, about 25-30 minutes.  I boiled the marinade to reduce it to a nice gravy.  Mmmmmmm!  It was moist throughout and so good.  My husband had thirds!

My family thought this recipe was okay, but nothing outstanding. We will not likely make it again.

I'd give more stars if I could!   Like other reviewers, the only change I'd make is to increase the number of servings you prepare, because people will ask for seconds.  Also, double or triple the marinade, and reserve some to be made into gravy by boiling it down with a bit of cornstarch or flour roux.  This gravy is always a hit and is well worth the few minutes it takes to prepare.   By the way, take the time to make sure that you have all of the marinade/gravy ingredients.  Several people who gave this recipe a poor review commented that they replaced the sherry and/or certain spices. These ingredients are the essence of the dish, and really are essential.  I'm always happy to use shortcuts and make substitutions, but this recipe really should be followed precisely.  It's worth an extra trip to the grocery store!!!!

I'm giving this five stars even before I try it because enough of the reviewers who actually followed the recipe say it is worth it. To all the rest, I often wonder what you are thinking? Giving a recipe a rating based on totally changing the original ingredients is NOT what is being asked for. So whether you had great results or not, you should always be honest about the recipe AS WRITTEN!

Loved the ease & amazingly tasty results of this recipe - lots of bang for little buck.  Followed other comments & used 1/2 onion + 4 garlic cloves as substitute for powders.  Marinated only 4 hours b/c that's all I had time for.  Cooked at 350 for 1 hour, wrapped in foil.  Broiled last minute or two (flipping once) to give outside a slightly browner 'crust.'  Boiled remaining marinade for 5 minutes or so to reduce, then added 1 TBL of cornstarch and moved off heat while stirring.  Great as gravy.  Only mistake I made was making 1 loin vs. 2 so I could save one for later.  Entire family devoured the 1st one so there is nothing left for weekday lunches.

I am about to make this recipe for the third time.  I roast it for 1 hr at 350.  I am going to try boiling the marinade and basting the meat this time.  This is a great recipe when you have company. I am bringing it to a Christmas party tonight. Wonderful flavors and juicy.  Thank you for the great recipe!

Terrific recipe Lisa.  I took the suggestion of another reviewer and used raspberry vinegar in place of the sherry and let this marinate for 2 days.  We grilled the tenderloins half way through and then split the down the center (butter-flied them) and finished grilling them.  My husband poured sake on them while they were grilling.  This was the BEST pork tenderloin we've had so far.  Every bite was eaten and I'm making it again this weekend for company.  My husband..(who really dislikes cinnamon) gave this 2 thumbs up.  Thanks for sharing this! Highly recommended.

This was incredibly easy to prepare and very delicious.  I didn't have sherry so i used apple juice instead.  I only marinated for 3 hours and the meat was full of flavour.  Also important to cover the meat with foil and let it rest for at least 10 minutes to seal in all that flavour.  I will make this all the time now!

I just ate a pound of pork tenderloin.  I was supposed to bring the rest to work for lunch tomorrow.  

I slightly modified the recipe.  Like others, I doubled everything except the cinnamon so I'd have more sauce. I used half of a real onion, and 3-4 cloves of real garlic. I also used Low Sodium soy sauce because I'm healthy like that. I marinated mine overnight in a ziploc, in the fridge, so figure about 20 hours.

I don't have a grill, but 30 minutes at 400 degrees in the oven brought the pork to a perfect 145 degrees.  I took it out and covered with foil for ten minutes.  During that ten minutes, I added one TBSP of cornstarch to 1 TBSP of cool water, mixed, and combined in a saucepan with an already heated sauce.  Thickened in a few minutes and actually ended up a bit syrupy - which was awesome.  

Again, this is very, very good.  Will definitely be making this again.

I have always avoided pork because it always turns out dry and flavorless....I have been converted!!  This was soooo easy, lots of flavor, MOIST, & melt in your mouth tender!!  I didn't have sherry, so I sub'd balsamic vinegar, LOVED it!  I brined the tenderloin the night before in 4 cups water to 3tbsp kosher salt, drained, rinsed & then marinated with this recipe for about 8 hours.  Boiled the used marinade for 5 min. then added it to some sliced mushrooms that I had browned in a pan....PHENOMENAL!   poured the mushrooms over the top....WOW!  This will be a once a week for sure!  Thank you so much!!  (p.s....highly recommend the TENDERloin..the reg. loin turns out much dryer.  Don't skip the cinnamon, it is uber yummy!)  I served it with some roasted fresh green beans.

I have used this same marinade for chicken and everyone loves it. I left out the cinnamon because some of my family doesn't like it. I used a pork roast instead of tenderloin. It was good.

Very good!  I used marsala wine instead of sherry, low sodium soy sauce, and minced garlic.  I cut the pork into kabobs and let it marinate for a full day.  I skewered green peppers and onions to go along with it.  This was perfect for the grill. The pork turned out very moist and had a very nice sweet flavor.

5 stars all the way!!!! Don't change a thing! Other reviewers did and they didn't give it 5 stars! This simple marinade is awesome. I only marinated for 2 hours because I was pressed for time but it still was amazing! Make extra because everyone will keep wanting more! A keeper for sure....just try it....you'll see!!! P.S. It was only 5 degrees out when I made this so I baked it in the oven at 425 for 30 minutes instead of grilling. Delicious!!!

We really liked this!  I followed the marinade recipe exactly except for doubling it, but leaving the cinnamon at 1 tsp.  I only had time to marinate the meat for about 6.5 hours.  I pan seared the 1lb+ tenderloin and then roasted it at 375 for about an hour to get the internal temp to 155 degrees.  Pulled it out of the oven, covered with foil for about 10-15 mins (temp reached 160+), then sliced.  Simmered the extra marinade on the stove top while meat was in the oven, added 1T of cornstarch and water to thicken it just a little.  The meat was wonderfully tender and had great flavor, was even better with the sauce spooned over it.  My boyfriend is a fussy eater and he gave this recipe 5 stars.  I give it 4.5 as it's just a tad too too strong on the cinnamon for me but I can adjust that next time, though it IS nice to have a different flavor.  Served with roasted potatoes and carrots - great meal.  Thanks for sharing it!

We just couldn't wrap our taste buds around the cinnamon in the marinade.  I prepared it exactly as given, tripling the recipe to have more marinade.  It wasn't until later that I read the comments to keep the cinnamon at 1 tsp regardless of how much extra marinade you make.  That could have made the difference in this recipe.  If I had it to do over again, I would totally omit the cinnamon, minced dried onion and garlic powder and instead add minced fresh garlic, grated fresh ginger and grated fresh onion.

I substituted not one ingredient based on the comments although I was a little hesitant about the cinnamon. I reduced the marinade with some corn starch and poured it over the pork slices and it tasted great!

We really enjoyed this recipe - the only one who didn't like it was my 3 yr old daughter who is in her "chicken nugget" phase, so her opinion may be biased...  I marinated it for 2 days because we weren't home that night and it was so tender.  Just have to be careful when grilling on the BBQ - have to keep your eye on the meat because the sugar caramelizes and may burn if not watched.  Great and thanks for the recipe!  UPDATED REVIEW - my daughter is definitely out of her chicken nugget stage (won't TOUCH them now) and we make this recipe at least every other week - we love this recipe, even the ex-chicken nugget fanatic!

Made this tonight for dinner and was extremely disappointed.  I thought the sauce was awful. Am dumbfounded at the 4 1/2 star rating. I don't know why I even tried it, as I have a recipe for a marinated pork tenderloin that blows my socks off.  I will post it on Monday for you all and if 100% of you don't agree that it beats this recipe by a mile, I will eat my socks! Please look for Maple-Orange Pork Tenderloin, you HAVE to try it. It is one of the best meals I have ever had in my life.

This is very good and unique! The flavor of the cinnamon goes so well with the pork. We will be making this again. I took the suggestion of a prior review and boiled the sauce. I let the pork rest for 5 or 10 minutes after cooking, sliced it and then poured the sauce over all. Very tasty!!

Just made this tonight for the first time and it was delicious!!!  I used 1/3 cup of soy sauce and 1/3 cup of brown sugar as well as 3 tbsp of sherry and 3 tbsp of olive oil.  I also used 4 cloves of fresh minced garlic instead of powder and used onion powder because that's all I had on hand and it was just amazing.  My husband said it's the best pork he's ever had and that I should make it this way all the time.  Thanks for the recipe!  I definitely plan on making more marinade next time to dip.  I only marinated for about 3 hours and it was plenty...

  How delicious! A real keeper.
 I thought it would be similar to teriyaki marinade but I was pleasantly surprised when it wasn't.
 The cinnamon gives it a unique flavor, like Jamaican Jerk Chicken/Pork.
 I marinated a small pork roast and 2 boneless chicken breasts overnight. I did not grill, I roasted in the oven.
The meat was a beautiful brown color on the outside, moist and tender on the inside.
 An excellent recipe just the way it is; 
 Now that I know how good it is I might try one of the other reviewer's suggestions.
Thank you for sharing!

Good recipe but cooking instructions are incomplete. Grill for 20 minutes turning every 5 minutes. Remove to cutting board and let stand for 10 minutes before slicing and serving.

I wasn't a big fan of this, although some of my guest LOVED it and others thought it was good, but not great.  Anyhow, I marinated this for two days, sub. the sherry for red wine vinegar and reduced the cinnamon (wanted to be safe, since it really didn't sound appealing on meat).  I didn't grill it, I just browned the sides and baked it in the oven at 400 degrees for 30 mins.  Pork was tender and sweet and I really don't like sweet meat.  Anyhow, I'll just pass this recipe along to the guest that loved it; as for me, I won't make next time.

I followed the recipe pretty close, except, when I doubled the sauce I didn't double the cinnamon. I also didn't pack down my brown sugar, I was afraid it would be too sweet. I was out of gas for my grill and not enough charcoal for the other one, so I had to improvise on the cooking method. I seared it in a hot, cast iron pan and finished it in the oven. I served it with steamed rice, green beans and sliced tomatoes from the garden. Yum! Because of the rich flavors of the sauce, I didn't thicken it too much, just a little. I can't wait to try it on the grill.

This was SO GOOD.  I marinated 24+ hours and seared in a steel pan, then finished in a 425 oven for 15 min to 145 degrees.  Thank god for meat thermometers :)  This was super tender and delicious!  I also reduced the marinade with a little Wondra.  Don't reduce too much as it would be too salty.  The thickener makes the difference.

Wow, is all I can say!!  Like others, I used balsamic vinegar instead of sherry and put fresh diced red onion (2 Tbsp or so).  We seared it first and I put it in a 375 degree oven for about 30 minutes, until the meat thermometer read 140ish.  I let it rest for five minutes and the temp went up to 155.  It was the most tender, juiciest tenderloin we've had in a while.....and I only marinated it for 30 minutes.  Next time, I'll do it longer.  This recipe is a keeper!! The cinnamon is what makes it unique.

Sooo yummy! I tripled the marinade because I had a lot of pork. I did not tripple the cinnamon. I baked it at 400 until the center reached 160 degrees. SOOO DELICIOUS!! I can't wait to make it again. Next time I might use a tad less brown sugar. MM...

This meal got rave reviews from everyone. I used onion powder instead of minced onions (didn't have any) and used about a tablespoon of minced garlic instead of garlic powder (love garlic). I let it marinate for about 20 hours - mmm, the marinade smelled sooo good!! I also cooked it a good 50 minutes to an hour because I don't have a meat thermometer and I get kind of paranoid. I warmed up the leftover juice on the stove with added cornstarch - wonderful gravy! Will make again.

From a not-so-great cook, I made this for Christmas Eve dinner, there wasn't a
bite left! Almost 4 pounds of pork, so I increased the recipe to compensate.
After reading reviews, I improvised some of the ingredients. Didn't have
sherry, so substituted with balsamic vinegar and marinated for six hours. Everyone
loved this. I've never had so many compliments on any other dish. 
Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!

I hadn't read the recipe well before beginning to make the marinade.  I had a 6 lb. pork tenderloin so I needed to times the recipe by SIX.  It turned out incredibly good.  The outside was crispy and the inside was perfect.  I basted the roast 3-4 times while cooking it.  I baked it at 325 for @ 3-1/2 hours.  This one will certainly be made over and over again!  Thanks for this recipe!

Ah simplicity! Because pork tenderloin is such a great cut of meat, even eaten on it's own with nothing added, it is often overpowered by well intentioned cooks. This marinade adds just the right touch to the meat. Simple, subtle, but yet very effective. Unlike some other reviewers, I did NOT think the cinnamon was too much, and I really liked what it added to the flavour - it made this a very unique dish. You have to expect this to be on the sweet side - something people won't normally expect from a pork recipe. My 5 star rating is based on making the recipe exactly as written. I make this for my family at least once a month now, and often for company. I wouldn't change anything!

This is my go-to recipe for pork tenderloin.  I have made it with sherry, as directed, and I have subbed balsamic vinegar for the sherry as well - great results either way, but use the sherry if have it!  I will also sub fresh onion and/or garlic if I have it on hand, but it's just as good with dried and even more simple that way.  Since there's usually only two of us, we cook one tenderloin and then freeze the second in the marinade for a quick meal down the road.  To grill the meat we use the 7-6-5 method we found online: 7 minutes on high; flip over and grill the other side for 6 minutes on high; then turn off and leave it set on the grill for 5 minutes.  I also like to boil some of the marinade and spoon it over the meat before serving.  This is a quick and easy dish with lots of flavor.

i didn't have any sherry so i used balsamic vinegar instead.i will buy sherry for the next time. other than that, i followed everything as listed. i kept thinking, i hope i didn't ruin this using cinnamon. IT WAS AWESOME! don't be afraid of trying this recipe and don't leave out the cinnamon! no one at dinner could guess what the ingredient was. each ingredient seems to compliment each other without one flavor taking over.i am so glad i took a chance on this one! give it a try. using the leftovers for paninni's tonight.

This was good but not great. I followed the recipe as written and marinated overnight. There was nothing wrong with it, I just didn't love the flavour. This recipe was ok to make once but I won't be making it again

This is a great recipe. I've made it twice now, once with the cinnamon and once without. I definitely preferred it without! The first time I did it in the oven, which was fine, but it was even better cooked on the grill. I wasn't sure about grilling it with all that sugar, but it turned out fine. I have a three burner gas grill, so I turned on the two outer ones and preheated it to about 400 degrees, then put on the tenderloin. I turned down the flame to about 2/3 on both burners, so it didn't burn. I turned it three times (three sides) and cooked it until it was 155 degrees inside, then I tented it with foil and let it rest on a platter for about 10 minutes to finish cooking. It was juicy and delicious. It did take a little longer to cook on the grill than the recipe states -- mine took about 35 minutes, which screwed up the timing of my side dishes a little, but we lived with it. :) Oh, and I marinated it overnight the second time, and only a few hours the first time... both came out about the same. So, do it whenever it's convenient for you.

This really is the best pork ever. Recipes often say that, but this time it's true. I marinated for 2 1/2 days, made three pork tenderloins and tripled the marinade except for the cinnamon. I used the sherry. My family was amazed. The pork just melted in your mouth. The brown sugar in the marinade made for a nice crisp outside of the pork. Everyone wanted doggie bags to take home leftovers. I was glad I made three for just 6 people. Will definitely make again. 
One note: put a good amount of oil on the grill or it will stick.

This is a great marinade.  I used Marsala wine instead of the sherry 
(what I had on hand) and added crushed red pepper, a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce and balsamic vinegar.  I did a 24 hour marinade and finished on the grill to 145 degrees.  Next time I will reserve some of the marinade and make a reduction sauce for serving.

My husband, son, and I all thought this was great, but the real reason it gets five stars is that the pickiest child in the world, my daughter, actually asked for seconds. I roasted the tenderloins in the oven for 35 minutes at 400 degrees and they came out perfect. As other reviewers suggested, I doubled the marinade recipe, reserved half of it, and made a sauce on the stovetop. That was fantastic, too. This will definitely go into the regular recipe rotation.

Superb!  My husband hates when I make pork because he feels that no matter what recipe I make, the meat is too tough.  He scoffed tonight as well when I told him what I was making.  Then proceed to have 3 helpings!!  He even asked for tomorrows leftovers.  Did this one totally in the oven and used the marinade (heated) to serve over the pork.  5 and 7 year old loved as well!  Wonderful recipe!

This was good, but not quite as good as I’d hoped.  I used fresh onions, minced, and left out the cinnamon.  I pureed it with my emersion blender.  I had one tenderloin, but made the full amount of marinade.  I used half for marinating and the other half to baste on while grilling.  I heated the basting half and added just enough cornstarch mixed with water to give it some nice body and “cling.”

Very easy to make, my family ADORES this recipe! I have aunts and uncles asking me about it! Slightly sweet, so if you dont like that, cut down on the sugar, and absolutely make an extra trip for the sherry, it is well worth it! I made this with the Roasted New Potatoes by pam anderson, and the Oven-Roasted Asparagus by swedish milk- the meal was one of the best I have ever made! I even made the gravy like recomended, came out delicious!

This was so delicious on the grill!  Threw in a few wood chips for extra flavor.  Only had 3 hours of marinating in the bag, but had plenty of great flavor.  I wasn't sure about the cinnamon in it at first, but it really works.  

I think I will also try the marinade on pork loin or loin chops and report back..

I'm on atkins so I replaced brown sugar with splenda, and used rice vinegar in place of sherry which I did not have.   Cooled the leftover marinate with some cream for the sauce. 

I think I will stock up on tenderloin at Sam's club.  This will give us something new to impress dinner guests.

My family loved this pork tenderloin and they asked me to definitely make it again. I have a standard pork tenderloin recipe that I make often, but this MUST become the new standard.  I found this recipe shortly before we were supposed to eat dinner so I didn't have as much time to marinate as long, but it was still really, really good.

I thought it was outstanding!  I didn't have sherry and used balsamic vinegar instead.  I marinated the pork and put it in a roaster pan with lots of veggies and cooked it for about 45 minutes at 375 degrees.  Everything was delightful.  The marinade was perfect on the veggies, as well.

I took another reviewer's advice and used balsamic vinegar instead of sherry. This is probably the most delicious thing I have ever made!

This recipe reminded me of asian barbeque pork.  I loved the flavor.  I accidentally marinated it for 36 hours.  I made the sauce from the marinade, but we didn't use it.  I seared the meat then baked at 400 degrees for 20 minutes.  It was perfectly done.  It was so tender and delicious!

I have to admit, when I first read this recipe I was a little skeptical, even with all the high reviews.  I love cinnamon, but the ingredients just seemed like a wierd mix.  Goes to show, you can never judge until you have tried.  This was excellent.  I followed this recipe to a tee.  The only thing I did do different was I didn't have time to marinate for at least six hours.  I think it ended up being only for 2 and it still was awesome.  I only used one pork tenderloin and after I was done marinating, I poured the leftover marinade into a small saucepan.  I heated up the sauce until it boiled for a few minutes and then I turned it down and added a tablespoon and a half of heavy cream.  It was so good spooned over the grilled tenderloin.  I highly recommend it.  I'm making this the next time I have company over for sure.  They'll be so impressed.  Oh and my husband brought it to work the next day and a bunch of his co-workers thought it was amazing.

This was awesome. I did cook it at 350 in the oven and used a meat thermometer to tell me when it was done.  I boiled up the remainder of the marinade and basted with that and then served it as a topping sauce.  YUMMER.  I used real garlic (4 cloves) and 1/2 a red onion.  Very juicy and yummy!

As Rachel Ray says, "Yum-O"! We loved this! Read reviews and: doubled the marinade, used red wine vinegar in place of sherry, 2 T fresh minced onion, and marinated about 18 hrs.
I chose the easy way out and baked at 425 x 30 min. Boiled down the marinade and added cornstarch afterwards.

YUM!YUM!  It's impossible to get all 5 people in my family to all give a meal "Thumbs up!", but this one did it!  Even my picky, picky 6 year old!  It was delicious!  I sauteed some portobello mushrooms and boiled the leftover marinade, then added them together for a great side sauce!  Thank you so much for this recipe.  We will enjoy it often!

Fabulous!! This was a very easy recipe and very tasty. I didnt have sherry so I used red wine vinegar. Marinated the pork loin for 24 hours in a zip lock bag with the marinade. I cooked it on the grill. It was perfect. I also brought the leftover marinade up to a boil on the stove and used that to drizzle over the sliced pork. Excellent!! Will make again soon!

Usually I'm too lazy to log back on and write a review, but this was amazing...you don't really taste the cinnamon as it blends in nice with the bown sugar...awesome recipe. I cut off small pieces and let it sit in the extra marinade that covered my plate, mouth watering. When you see 95% of the people give a recipe 5-stars, you know you gotta try it...this is a winner. Thanx

This was GREAT.  My husband and I loved it.  I do not use oil, so I substituted chicken broth for the oil and I did not have sherry so I used red wine vinegar and it came out great!

This recipe is great.  Instead of using sherry try a bourbon.  I used Segram's 7 and I think it turned out really well.  Also, I cooked it on a gass grill over indirect heat.....I would definately recommend grilling this.  The cinnamon and brown suger really have a great charred flavor

I haven't had good luck with pork loin roasts (dry and tasteless) so I was pleasantly surprised to find this recipe after getting a good deal at Costco for a pork loin.  I followed the recipe "by eye" meaning I didn't measure, just guesstimated, replaced the sherry with a sweet vinegar (since I didn't have any sherry), added dashes of pepper for zing.  I took the third of the 6 lb. roast, cut it lengthwise (like in the video) and marinated for 6 hours, grilled it on high until it reached 155 degrees and let it rest.  I saw one review that recommended heating and thickening the marinade.  That was the a great tip as it was delicious.  Wish I had waited for all the au jus that came from the loin before thickening but it was still delish!!!  Highly recommend it.

Wow.  Served this with the "grilled pineapple salsa" from this site tonight with pan-fried finger potatoes.  Excellent.  Left-over salsa will accompany chicken tomorrow night.  That's if I can save it from being devoured by DH.  Grilling pineapple adds a certain 'je ne sais quoi'.  One reviewers suggestion to grill red pepper and onion is interesting.  Will try that next time instead of vidalia onion.

In addition to my traditional Easter ham I decided to take a risk and try this pork tenderloin recipe for the first time for Easter for 20 people.  Result: RAVE reviews all around! I followed recipe as written, marinated overnight and reserved the marinade as suggested to make a sauce to drizzle over tenderloin platter.  I used 6 pork tenderloins and converted the recipe to feed 20 people (love this allrecipes feature).  I added about a tbsp. of cornstarch and a wee bit of water. I grilled the tenderloins on oiled BBQ on medium heat for 20 mins, turning once.  Please don't cook any longer or tenderloins will be dry.  A little pink in the middle is fine as will continue to cook as you let rest.  Let rest for 10 mins under tented (not tightly covered) foil. I sliced tenderloins into medallions and fanned out in rows on a large red platter, drizzled sauce over top and finished off with fresh parsley.  The presentation was beautiful - wish I'd taken a picture.  Not a slice was left. Wish I'd made more as people wanted seconds. I served with potatoes Au Gratin.  Thank you Wkeller for this great recipe.

This was incredible!  I had to post a picture of it on the site as well! I didn't change anything at all except for doubling the marinade (including the cinnamon) so I could boil it down with some cornstarch and water (1TBSP each) to make a wonderful gravy. Too cold to grill here so I put it on a cookie sheet with silpat and baked it for 35 minutes, flipping the tenderloins about halfway through. 

It is a fantastic recipe! Try the marinade - as written!

This is a good recipe as long as you make sure to use low sodium soy sauce. I also used real garlic, two cloves and increased the cinnamon to around 2 tsp and increased the sherry to 4 tbs.

People... DO NOT omit the cinnamon!  I know it sounds weird, but really, it's what makes this dish so wonderful.  I've done it both with the sherry and balsamic vinegar (since that's usually what I have on hand) and it's delicious either way.  We don't have a grill, so we roast in in the oven and it's fantastic.

This was delicious!!  I used a small roast and grilled it for about an hour.  I especially like how the outside got nice and dark, looked very nice cut.

I made this last night and our company asked for the recipe.  It's delicious.  I used dehydrated chopped garlic and onion powder.  The only thing I might do is add a little more cinnamon and a touch more sugar but that's just because I like my pork a little sweet.  I'm already looking forward to the next time pork tenderloin goes on sale! YUM.  thanks for sharing!

This recipe was definitely good as far as pork goes.. No one in my family is a big pork eater unless it is bacon, sausage, or ham!  Everyone ate it and said they enjoyed it.  I'll make again since my dad said he liked it, and he's the pickiest eater in the house hold.. yes more so then the four year old!  If he liked it then it's a winner.  This is definitely sweet though, not so much on the actual pork.  I also used something called a pork brisket, and not a pork tenderloin.  It did not effect how it tasted at all though, and it was very good!

This was good, but not great. Followed the recipe exactly but found the cinnamon to be a bit overwhelming. First bites were great, but the cinnamon flavor quickly overpowered everything .I am anxious to try it again, but without the cinnamon and with perhaps a bit more soy. The brown sugar adds a real nice touch to the crusty grill finish. I  love cinnamon on bakery products, but have found that on meat a very little pinch would more than suffice. 
Will keep this and look forward to trying again with a few changes. Except for the cinnamon, it's a winner.

The basis of this recipe is amazing.  Yes, I did make adjustments, however they were minor.  A whole shallot for the minced dried onion, and 1 fresh clove of garlic for the powered.  I kept the recipe  the same, however, I only made 1 tenderloin. I might of added a dash more sherry :)!  I also mixed the marinade in a bowl prior to transfering to a bag.

FYI All Receipe Folks, you can cook this on a George Forman.  Just keep rotating and flipping it. It took me about 10-15 mins to reach 145, then while resting optimun temperature was reached.


, and 6-8 hours may be the ideal marinade time.  Longer marinade times (I did 12 my first time) tended to make the pork extemely soft, almost mushy due to the sherry.

Of course you can't use a recipe the way it's written...lol...today I needed to cook in the crockpot, so I used the marinade recipe x1, put it in the small crockpot with 2.5 tenderloin roast. I did put in omly 3/4 t cinnamon, and used a clove of garlic instead of powder. Cooked on low all day, then removed roast and thickened juices with 2 T cornstarch/1/2 c.water. thought the juice was a little too sweet and cinnamony, so added 1/2 t habanero sauce to the sauce. It was great! Served with wild rice mix and green beans. Very tender and not dry.

Yeah...this one reads a little suspicious for a traditional girl like me, but it is de-li-ci-oso!  I tweaked a little for my family's tastes, but the cinnamon and brown sugar really rock this dish.  The first time, I just cooked them whole in the oven.  Last night I marinated for about an hour then sliced the pork, tossed in about 1 TB of cornstarch, stirred it all together and stir fried it with some frozen vegetables.  Over some plain rice it was a big hit!

Really, really good.  Every one of my kids loved it!!   I marinated the pork in the marinade for 24 hours and gave to my husband to grill.  He threw the marinade out (forgot to tell him to keep it!)  He didn't baste it at all but it still had an amazing flavor and was super tender and juicy. I'm going to try the marinade on chicken next :)

Absolutely WONDERFUL!!!!!! I marinated my roast over night then pour the roast- marinade and all- into a pan. I baked in a 350 oven for approx 40 minutes. Half way through I basted and flipped the roast. This recipe is a keeper for sure

This was wonderful! A nice fall holiday comfort food. Didn't have any Sherry so I used some port wine  and then made a gravy out of the sauce.I also seared the tenderloin in a frying pan and then baked at 350 for about 30 min until the meat reached 160.  Served it with some mashed potatoes and green beans. Got Rave reveiws from around the dinner table.

My fiancée and I were not at all impressed with this recipe. Based on the reviews, I was expecting something phenomenal, and I even made the marinade into a sauce and doubled it in anticipation of liking it so much. Perhaps it was the build up that let me down, but the fiancée and I thought it was hardly even ok. There was nothing about it that made us want to eat it.

Very good. I baked it on a high setting instead of putting on the grill. Lazy on my part. I also boiled the leftover marinade and added some flour/butter to make a thick gravy to use as a dipping sauce (like steak sauce) and not smothering it. Will make again for sure.

Sorry about resending my earlier review. I just wanted to add that I did serve to beach crowd this weekend and everyone loved it.  Had 4.5 lbs, so I tripled marinade.  Roasted loins @325 for about 25 minutes--150 internal temp.
Served with brown/wild rice confetti pilaf and green beans almondine and a salad of baby greens, asian pears and bleu cheese with a sherry vinegarette.  Leftovers were wondeful as cold sandwich on hamburger buns.  Do boil down the marinade and use as gravy.

I replaced the sherry with red wine vinegar and marinated for 48 hours. My husband loved it so much, we had it again the next night. Will try this marinade on chicken and steak. A definite keeper.

I must admit, I was skeptical, but this was the best pork tenderloin I've ever tasted.  I didn't have any sherry on hand so I just used some white zinfandel.  Also, I didn't have the minced onion so I used onion powder plus I used about a teas. of garlic powder instead of just a pinch since I love garlic.  This pork tenderloin was so flavorful and tender.  I will definitely make this again.

This marinade was truly tasty and the hubby loved it.  I substituded madeira for the sherry and onion powder for the dried onion.  I also used small tenderloins (between 1/4 and 1/2 lb. each) so I grilled them for less time (maybe 10 minutes).  And, since I work, I marinated them overnight.  I took someone else's suggestion and before serving, sauteed some mushrooms in butter, then added some leftover marinade and let it boil down.  It ended up making a slightly sticky glaze and they tasted GREAT.

By far, the best tenderloin recipe on here.  The pork comes out juicy and tender.  I always double the marinade recipe and marinate it overnight, and take it to tailgates.  Everyone always raves about it, and the meat actually tastes better as a leftover (if there is any).  Thanks for sharing!!

This recipe is fast, easy, and very tasty. The kids loved it. I made it a day ahead, and they ate it cold as I was slicing it to heat in the microwave the next night! I did not change the marinade; however, instead of grilling, I baked for 30 minutes at 325 F.

I have six kids ages 3 to 12 and they all love this pork.  The youngest is a very picky eater but he devours this whenever we have it.  I have made this a lot of times for guests and everyone that I have made it for asks for the recipe.  This is my all time favorite meat recipe!  Thanks so much for sharing it. : )

This is the best tasting pork tenderloin!  Very juicy and flavorful --- I heated up the sauce/marinade (make sure it gets to a boil) and poured it over the tenderloin and it added a lot more flavor -- I plan to make it again!!!

We had this during the summer.  It was a great recipe.  The whole family liked it.  It really made the grilled out pork taste very gourmet and special, not the typical chops that you think of.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is the best grilled tenderloin I've ever had! It's the cinnamon.  So good, highly recommend you try this. Easy and tasty! Doesn't get any better than that.

I grilled a pork loin last week using this recipe.  It was nice to have a recipe not overloaded with garlic. I had wondered about the amount of cinnamon in the recipe, but I changed nothing!It was fabulous.  Wonderfully tender. Had the leftovers as sandwiches.

Excellent!  Great flavor - beautiful on the grill.  Per other recommendations - doubled the marinade except cinnamon.  Used fresh onion and garlic instead of powder.  Boiled the marinade, added a little corn starch and had a lovely sauce.  Thanks for a great recipe - we will be making this again.

I added buttermilk to the marinade and also substituted balsamic vinegar for the sherry.  I seared the loin on my cast iron grill pan bc I live in a city and don't have an outdoor grill. I also finished it in the oven while I boiled and reduced the marinade (so long as you bring a marinade up to a boil and kill anything unsavory in marinade which has contained raw meat, it's fine).  I added some Rosemary to the marinade as it reduced and discarded it for presentation, it worked really well with the cinnamon.  We liked it.  I think the husband will request it again.

I tried this recipe exactly as written, and I just didn't like it. I expected the flavors to marry as the meat marinated, but they didn't.

This is wonderful. Even my picky husband raved over it. I'm from Cajun country so I put a Cajun touch. I finely chopped fresh onion & garlic and mixed with a little black & cayenne pepper. I made slits in the tenderloin & stuffed the onion garlic mixture in. I marinated in the sauce for just a couple hours & then cooked it in the Flavor Wave oven for 20 minutes. Let rest for 10. Delicious.

I've made this recipe several times in the oven (thank you to whoever made the previous comment) at 350 for an hour. I also substituted two Tbsp of balsamic vinegar for the sherry and it was fantastic! Very tender and great flavor!

This is, hands down, the best pork tenderloin ever!  I took the recommendations of those who baked it (easier to do in the winter) rather than grilling it, and I, too, boiled and thickened the left over marinade.  I sliced the pork, put it on a platter and poured the cooked and thickened marinade over the meat.  There were so many raves, I got a spoon so my guests could scoop up the marinade on the platter.  I was out of sherry so used marsala, but other than that did not vary the ingredients.  I marinated it for 19 hours and roasted it at 425 for about 30-35 minutes.  It shared the oven with oven roasted herbed potatoes.  Seriously, this tenderloin is AMAZING!

Tried on grill - took forever to cook.  Tried in oven - sauce just not right. Made again tonight not realizing I had reviewed previously. Lowering to 3 stars from 4 and noting that too much cinnamon..

Loved it. Followed the recipe exactly, doubling the sauce and not doubling the cinnamon. Even my picky 7 year old loved it. I will be making this for my mother-in-law, and that is saying something!! I baked it in a 425 degree oven for about 25 minutes with a meat thermometer set for 160. Mmmm perfect. I served it with potatoes and green beans, but I think I would do rice or quinoa next time.

Made this last night. Followed the recipe almost exactly, except I used fresh minced onion as I didn't have any dry (my mistake). I also doubled the recipe since I wanted to marinate some veggies to grill along with the pork tenderloin. I made sure to double all ingredients, including the cinnamon. It was very easy to make. Unfortunately, I could only marinate the pork for 4 hours, but the flavor was still incredible. Since I had two pork tenderloins, I did experiment with one, by piercing one after marinating and before grilling, with a meat tenderizer. Both my husband and I liked this one more, since the marinade went into the meat and not just on top. We grilled the veggies in a basket on the grill, and they were absolutely wonderful! I drained the marinade from the veggies (I had marinated the pork and veggies separately) into a sauce pot, reduced the sauce and added a slurry of cornstarch and water to thicken it. My husband used this over his meat, and thought it added a lot of flavor. This could be used over rice or mashed potatoes as a side dish. We served it with corn on the cob and corn bread . Thanks for this recipe. It is wonderful!!

WOW...WOW...WOW! This is an excellent marinade for pork, and I bet it works well on beef and chicken as well! The only thing I did different was add 2 tbs Worcestershire because I was a bit short on the soy sauce. I don't know if that did anything to this, but I do know I will use this marinade recipe over and over again. Thanks so much for sharing it WKELLER! Awesome!

yes and I thought it was to sweet,  might try it again with less sugar. was not one of my best efforts... liked orange marinated better.   but for the most part, don't like it sweet.. personal preference but easy to make.

I am a low-cerber, and was easily able to rework this recipe (just slightly)using Sukrin Gold All Natural Low calorie sweetener alternative to Brown Sugar, and gluten free soy sauce. My tenderloins came out amazing! 

I also added one more twist to the marinade. I tossed in a small amount of red pepper, chili flakes for a little kick. Moth watering, and will be making this again!

This recipe rocks!  If a reviewer gave this less than 5 stars, they did something seriously wrong! My husband, kids and myself just loved this.  Used real onion and garlic, seared it in a dutch oven, then put in the oven at 400 degrees for one hour. Make gravy from the pan drippings, eaters will fight over it (my grown kids did). Thank you for a kick butt good recipe!

One of the best recipes I've found on this site, and I've tried several dozen. So quick and easy and the meat turns out so tender and flavorful -- I always tend to double the marinade, then boil up the extra with a little cornstarch for a fantastic gravy over rice or mashed potatoes.

I marinated the pork for 72 hrs. Used 1 Tablespoon of Raspberry Vinegar, 1 Tablespoon Balsamic Vinegar. (Had no Sherry) Grilled it outside and OHMYGOSH...It was so good. We were eating it standing up. All the flavors came together and made such a wonderful Pork. Between 2 of us we almost ate 2lbs of pork. Call us porkers but it was just so good. Side dish was a baked Yam. Thanks for the recipe. I want another one.

Made this for the first time today and will definitely make it again and again! The marinade was super simple and I think each ingredient is important to the success of this recipe, especially the sherry. Followed the lead of some other reviewers and made a sauce using the remaining marinade with a bit of hot water and corn starch mixed in - delicious!! Don't think I'll ever try another pork tenderloin recipe because this one was PERFECT!

Used this recipe to marinate a 4 pound boneless pork loin I roasted in the oven with carrots and potates and WOW, never have I seen people so excited about a roast. Was nervous about the amount of cinnamon being overpowering so just used a few shakes and it was the perfect amount.  Just enough to make the house smell divine and the gravy taste uniquely delicious.  Substituted balsamic vinegar for the sherry (didn't have any), used a little less sugar than called for, and added a few sprinkles of cayenne.  DEFINITELY use the marinade as the gravy base! Brought it to a boil, added pan juices, and thickened with cornstarch/water.  I doubled the marinade recipe for the roast and might triple it next time because everyone went crazy for it. A keeper for sure.

I followed the recipe ingredients exactly and thoroughly enjoyed this pork tenderloin. I did cook it in the oven instead of on the grill, and it made my house smell like fall! A delicious way to usher in the season with this pork dish and a baked sweet potato on the side.

I enjoyed this marinade. I made the marinade exactly as the recipe calls for, except I baked the pork in the oven instead of grilling it. I baked it at 350 for about 35ish minutes (I had a probe thermometer) and it was quite tasty. The cinnamon was a bit over powering, so I'd probably reduce that a bit; however, I can see it tasting a little differently on the grill.

Absolutely love this recipe. I'm about to cook it again for a group of 6 for dinner, I've fed friends and family and everyone has asked for this recipe after tasting. I sear in a skillet and finish in the over while reducing the leftover marinade to make a wicked sauce! I usually add a tad bit more of everything in order to make extra sauce because it's so good!! Thanks so much for this one :)

Outstanding! I will make this again and again. Only change I made was because I didn't have sherry on hand and used rice wine vinegar instead. Wonderful recipe.

Wonderful!!! Made for company and everyone loved. Doubled marinade recipe and used minced fresh onion, as I did not have dried I did NOT double cinnamon. Marinaded about 7 hours.  Seared on grill on both sides then placed in a cast iron pan and dumped marinade on it and let cook for 15/20 minutes. Sliced thin and served in the sauce in the cast iron pan so it would stay hot.  I was worried it would be too sweet and it was not. This was a nice dish.

This recipe is so delicious!!  It is so tender and flavorful. I didn't do it on the grill, but seared it in the frying pan and then baked it for approx 30 mins at 350 until it reached 170 degrees. I  did what some of the other people suggested and added onion, garlic  and 1/2 of the cinnamon. It is so easy to put together and then used it for the sauce!!( a WONDERFUL addition to the meat) I boiled it for the 5 mins and added 1 TBSP of cornstarch....perfect!! The pineapple casserole on this site  goes great with this dish too!!

Awesome recipe. The meat itself is wonderful. The tip in other reviews to boil the leftover marinade is fantastic. The resulting sauce is delicious. I used a shallot for the onion and some white wine instead of sherry.

Made twice. Baked & then grilled the next. Tasted better grilled because the chars made it sweeter & more flavorful. Definitely make sure u grill or at least char on the pan first if baking.

This is amazing! Boil the marinade down in a simmer for a sauce that is to die for. I've made this once rePlacing sherry with red wine and once with balsamic vinegar. It was great both times. Smells a little too cinnamon-y cooking but it isn't.

Substituted Splenda for the brown sugar.  I used a lean pork loin roast instead of tenderloin and cut it into 1/2 inch slices; then put it in the marinade for about 6 hours.  Layed the slices on an oiled, foiled grilling rack and convection roasted, turning every 5 minutes, until slightly carmelized on edges.  So Yummy!!!  The cinnamon really makes the recipe special.  I think this would be great skewered on a grill too.

This recipe is incredible! I had to substitute balsamic vinegar for the sherry but still turned out great. I boiled the marinade after for a sauce. Will definitely make again.

This recipe was very good. Even my picky 8 year old son ate it up. I marinated the tenderloin in a vacuum Food Saver marinading container and kept it under vacuum for about 12 hours. I grilled it until it had grill marks and the sugar caramelized on the outside. I transferred  it to a baking dish and poured a little marinade over the top. Baked at 375 uncovered until the inside temp hit just 160F. It was awesome and I will make this main course again very soon. I served it with steamed carrots and baked apples cooked in diet root beer and cinnamon. I know, sounds weird but I found the recipe here under easy baked apples or simple baked apples. They were very good as well. I added a little garlic powder to the marinade as well. Love garlic even though you couldn't even taste it in the final product. Enjoy.

Just fabulous!! I did not want to serve more soy/sherry sauce on the side so I made a savory peach sauce - amazing! 2 peaches peeled and chopped, small amt of sauteed red onion, balsamic
vinegar and a dash of hot sauce (or cayenne) all sauteed until peaches are soft (10 min)
soo good!! and my husband though he hated pork!!

I followed the recipe 100%.  I too was skeptical about the cinnimon, but my experience has taught me that spices changes with time and cooking. So true with this one to.  I didn't care for how it smell once mixed, and even after marinating, but once cooked, it was very subtle.  My wife could not put her finger on what it was until I told her.  Best I can describe was it was very very mild jerk flavor.

I used 2  2lb pork sieloin.a  Used my weber charcoal grill.  Seared over hight heat for a few minutes on each side, then cooked indirect to about 145-150 internal temp.  The left overs are going to be great in fried rice tomorrow.

This was delicious.  It is pretty sweet and could probably do with a little less sugar, but delicious nonetheless.  The cinnamon and nutmeg are the magic ingredients that made my husband's eyes pop when he tasted it as he was grilling it.  Definitely a keeper!

Followed this to the letter and it was amazing. We did not throw out the marinade, but brought it to a boil on the stove til it thickened. Used it to brush over the loin as it grilled. Oh my goodness...delicious!!!

Delicious! I took other users advice and omitted cinnamon, replaced sherry with balsamic vinegar, doubled the recipe, used fresh onion and garlic.  I also made a sauce afterward by boiling leftover marinade and adding cornstarch to thicken.  There were NO LEFTOVERS and everyone loved this dish! Thanks!

This was really good.  It would have been a lot better if our stupid grill didn't cook so hot and charbroil everything we cook!  Seriously, it doesn't matter what heat we set it on, it still burns stuff!  The combination of flavors was very good and I am looking forward to trying this again either in the oven or on the grill but watching it constantly and turning it often!

Marinated Pork Tenderloin Haiku: "Bit too sweet for us. (Used fresh onion and garlic, instead of the dried.)" I followed the recipe as written, subbing fresh minced garlic, and diced onion, for the dried; I'm also glad that I reduced the brown sugar to 2 TB, b/c it was still too sugary. I liked the suggestions about boiling the marinade into a gravy to serve alongside the tenderloin (w/ some fluffy mashed 'tators too), but said gravy was, in my opinion, like putting caramel sauce over a savory dinner b/c I thought it was just too sweet. The tenderloin itself was perfectly tender, moist, and fantastic, but I would definitely reduce the sugar even more next time around.

I was a little unsure about the cinnamon and nearly left it out.  So glad I didn't! My guests couldn't quite put their finger on what was in the marinade...never would have guessed it was cinnamon.  Everyone loved it and I will definitely make this again.

Either I was incredibly hungry or this was the best recipe for a marinated pork tenderloin I have ever had.  I will be saving it and reusing it time and time again as it was a bit hit.  So moist, so flavorful.  170 degrees with 10 minutes to rest made it outstanding!

It was very good.  I do not agree that it needs additional marinade as a sauce.  It eas way to sweet to make a good sauce and just turned to caramel! I will make it again, with a single recipe only for the meat.  If you do not over cook the meat, you will not need a sauce.  Don't forget to let the meat rest for at least 10 minutes before you slice it or you will need a sauce!

Followed the recipe exactly as shown and was very happy with the perfectly tender tenderloin. Grilled it about 5mins per side until it reached 150 then pulled it off and wrapped it in tinfoil for 10mins. PERFECT.

This was pretty good.  An easy dish to make for sure. I baked it in the oven.  The sweetness is a little funny but the taste of sherry makes all the difference, definately use that for a unique flavor.

My preference was 1/4 teaspoon of 5 Spice powder instead of the cinnamon, but this was an awesome recipe. The changes I made (omitting onion and adding minced garlic instead of garlic powder) were not because it wasn't delicious as written, but simply because my family likes these things. It earned a full 5 stars just as it is!

Very good!  My husband said "you can make this again" as he was eating, so a winner in my books!  The only change I made was I used a tawny port instead of Sherry since that is all I had, other than that kept it the same.  Marinated overnight and the flavour was very nice.

This is a really fabulous marinade and I highly recommend this recipe.  I didn't change much of anything.  I advise using sherry and not substituting for anything else because it lends a bit of sweetness to the marinade.  I made it for company and grilled to about 120 degrees before they came and put it in the oven for about 25 minutes after they got to my house until it reached 150-260 degrees and it was very moist, tender and delicious.  I love sauces and would always prefer a sauce, but it can stand on it's own.

Very VERY good!  I baked potatoes, fennels, garlic cloves, and carrots first at 475 degrees for 10 minutes, shoved them off to the side, and added the pork tenderloin to the pan to roast with the vegetables for 25 minutes.  It turned out amazingly tender and the flavor was wonderful.  I will make this over and over again!!

Really Good! I did make some changes based upon other reviews: I used 1 small red onion, finely chopped; 1 shallot finely chopped. I didn't have sherry so I used basalmic vinegar. I also added about 1tsp of crushed garlic in place of the powder. Can you say yum! I only used one tenderloin and marinated it for well over 24 hours. Then I baked it for about 1 hour at 350 degrees. I heated the remaining sauce. Then used a little bit of cornstarch to thicken it. I will make again. Very easy and loved by the family.  I made it with Pineapple Cashew Rice and spinach brownies - found on this site.

Wow, this was really good!  I did use white wine instead of sherry since I was out of sherry.  But I doubt that made much of a difference.

This was very good but next time I'll omit cinnamon.  From suggestions of others I marinated overnight and used 1 fresh garlic clove.  Instead of grilling, I boiled the marinade them poured over pork and baked at 375 for 1 hr 15 mins. We had o roo on our grill or I would have grilled it.  It was very tasty.  The cinnamon was a little too powerful.

Excellent!  I have modified my dish as follows though: double the sauce & spices as suggested by another reviewer; put in allspice instead of cinnamon; added garlic powder along with dried minced garlic when I ran out of the latter; put in some balsamic vinegar (didn't measure, but maybe about 1 or 2 tbsp); put in quite a bit of garlic pepper instead of garlic powder (maybe about 2 tbsp).  I baked it (pork loin of about 1.8 lb.) at 350 degrees for about 1 hr & 20 mins.  It came out very juicy and tender but I think that's also because of how I baked it: I wraped it in aluminum foil with all the marinade as closely/tightly as I could so that some marinade was forced up to the top of the loin.  Both my husband and 9 yr old son gave it a 5 star, and my 6 yr old son requested a second serving after he initially said he didn't want it!

This recipe is so easy and delicious (and, I might add, budget friendly). I didn't have any sherry, so I did use apple cider vinegar instead, and cooked in oven at 375 for about 45 minutes (to cold to grill) but made no other changes and the pork loin was delicious. While it was cooking, it made the whole house smell wonderful. Yum! I can't wait to make it again and try to double the marinade to make a gravy, oh, and on the grill next time - yippee!

This recipe gets five stars from me AND my picky husband!  I didn't have sherry, so I used 1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar and enough chicken broth to make 1/2 cup (searched online for a substitute.)  I double the marinade portion of the recipe.  I baked the tenderloins at 425 for about 25 minutes, then thickened the marinade, and served it all with roasted potatoes and steamed broccoli.  It was amazing!!  Definitely a keeper!  My husband suggested I make it again this weekend, when we have guests coming over. :)

This was excellent.  Like others, I cooked the marinade and used as a sauce.  Next time I will make more marinade and use some to marinade the pork and the rest to cook down.  I served this with fried apples and it was wonderful.  Grilled the tenderloin to 160, turning 3 times and let rest for about 10 minutes.

This is autumn comfort food at its finest! I used the leftover marinade to make a sauce. I brought the marinade to a boil then added some cornstarch diluted in water. I couldn't stop "taste testing it"! Next time I make this, I am going to try it in the oven because I think the flavor of the marinade will be more prominent and not quite as covered by the grill flavor. This will be great with warm homemade applesauce...Mmmm!

This is really tender and delicious. The marinade is perfect exactly as written. As per other reviewers suggestions, I boiled down the marinade and added some cornstarch mixed with water and then served that as a sauce for the pork. I make this for dinner every couple of weeks or so.

I've made this several times and have never been disappointed.  Moist, juicy and extremely flavorful.  As for another reviewer complaining about the "awful sauce", there isn't a sauce with this dish--unless she actually cooked the marinating sauce with the pork and then ate it!

So nummy!!! OMG. Tender, juicy, great flavor.  I marinated mine for about 20 hours, and it was great. Cooked on charcoal grill for about an hour.  I doubled marinade, but only used a pinch of cinamon. I dont think I would have liked it too well with alot of cinamon. I just used a pinch, so it had a subtle flavor. I did like others suggested and boiled the sauce. I did not care too much for the sauce on the meat or as a gravy for the potatoes. It was too sweet, and the cinamon flavor was too pronounced.  Otherwise, great receipe. Thanks!!!

my whole family loved this recipe!!  i couldn't grill (it was raining) so i followed the suggestion for 40 minutes at 400 degrees - perfect.  my only substitution was port for sherry as i didn't have any sherry on hand.  thanks for the great recipe!

If you don't like cinnamon, you will not enjoy this recipe.  To us the cinnamon was mild; not overpowering.  I thought this would have an Asian flavour, due to the brown sugar and soy sauce, but it doesn't if you don't use the marinade as a sauce.  (had about 1/4 cup of marinade remaining after marinating all day)  Very tender and Very moist.  Baked at 375 degrees for 1.5 hours.  Could probably go with 400 for 1 hour.

Great recipe! I used Indonesian soy sauce instead of regular and didn't use the sherry, but it came out soooo yummy!

Amazing pork tenderloin recipe!!! My mom said it was the best  she has ever had (and she makes many different great versions)!!! I doubled the everything except for the cinnamon but otherwise stuck to it exactly! I also added some cornstarch and water to the used simmering marinade while the pork was grilling, and it made a great finishing sauce! Thanks so much for this recipe! It is definitely a keeper.

I tried this recipe with 1/2 the cinnamon, fresh garlic and onion on a large pork tenderloin (AllwaysTender brand).  I doubled the recipe and thickened the marinade. It was a big hit.  There was alot of leftover sauce.  I added thyme and julienne carrots and used it to cook some chicken.  Double yum!

I made this recipe for a dinner party I had the other day, and it was a huge hit! The only thing I did different was substitute orange juice for sherry (I didn't have sherry on me). The way the sugar caramelized on the grill made for it nice and crispy on the outside and incredibly tender on the inside! Thank you so much! I will pass this recipe around and definitely make it again!

I actually made this last year for a Christmas Party (I was thinking cinnamon, brown sugar...ok!) and it was delicious, different, comforting.

Of course I would make this again!

A definite 5 star dish.....    I marinated for 2 days also included thinly sliced apples to the marinade. I recommend not using the marinate as a sauce or gravy as I found it alittle to sweet. Pan seared then baked in the marinate for 25 mins at 300

I doubled everything in the marinade except the cinnamon, and even then I think the cinnamon was a tiny bit too strong of a flavor.  Otherwise really liked it though.  I used the leftover marinade to make a gravy (added brown gravy mix to it to hopefully make it more savory) but it was still too sweet.  I think a plain brown or pork gravy would be really nice to help offset the sweetness of the pork next time.

Very Good Recipe!  My husband really enjoyed the flavor that the marinade created and said he's going to request this be made again soon. 
FYI: I didn't have any Sherry so Instead I used Pineapple Juice and added Pineapples to my marinade. It turned out wonderfully.  The only thing I plan on doing next time is just doubling the recipe to cover the meat more. I soaked mine in the marinade for 48 hrs.
Thank You for Posting this recipe :)

This was outstanding.  I marinated the pork tenderloin overnight.  I also made extra sauce that I put aside to use as a dipping sauce with the cooked tenderloin.  We had friends over for dinner and they said this was one of the best meals they have had in a long time.  They wanted the recipe as well.

Oh my gosh, was this ever good!  I only marinated about 3 hours & the only change I made was to add cornstarch to the marinade & boil it into a sauce.  This is one recipe that I highly recommend trying without any changes to the ingredients (I can't believe the # of people that give a recipe a low rating but subbed most of the ingredients, duhhhhhhhh!) Can't wait to try this for company!!!!

Probably the best Pork Tenderloin I have ever made, it is quick and easy and so delightful to the taste. I usually replace the Sherry with Balsamic Vinegar, comes out great everytime.

I thought this was excellent. I baked mine at 350 degrees for an hour and it turned out perfect. Very juicy and full of flavor. I was not sure about the cinnamon, but added it in anyway, and was pleasantly surprised. I will definitely be making this again!

Absolutely delicious!!  I made this for my in-laws and it was restaurant quality great!  I did marinate it over night and we cooked it on the grill - which was very easy.  I highly recommend.  I also did serve with the Baked Pineapple casserole as others suggested & a green bean casserole which was great!!

This was a wonderful recipe!  The marinade was flavorful and delicious.  Of course I did doctor a bit.  I really like fruit with pork, so I decreased the brown sugar to two tablespoons, and added a heaping spoonful of orange marmelade and a splash of OJ.  I also added a pinch of ground ginger.  I heated the reserved marinade and basted the pork while grilling, and drizzled on the carved pork and jazmine rice.  Great for summer grilling!

Very Good marinade. I tend to make spicy or asian-style marinades for pork tenderloins, but this one's a little sweeter and very good. I love the cinnamon. It's not overpowering, but the taste has a nice hint of it. Will definitely make again.

Absolutely, hands-down delicious.  I didn't have sherry on hand, so subbed in a little red wine vinegar instead.  Still very, very good.

One word--AWESOME! This is the tastiest, most tender pork tenderloin I've ever made. I used 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and balsamic vinegar in place of the sherry. I browned the outside on the grill then butterfly cut it to finish. Mine took approximately 25 minutes to cook through. I then removed from heat and covered with foil for 10 minutes. This makes the meat even juicier. YUMYUMYUM...

Came out juicy and flavorful. Substituted red wine for sherry, onion poweder for minced onion, and used prok chops instead of loin. Only marinated for 5 hours and it was lovely. Don't over-bbq!

This was an amazing dish! I made a few modifications. Removed most of the fat and then pierced the tenderloin in several places before marinating. Added about a cup of apple cider to the marinade and after reading other reviews that said the cinnamon was overpowering, I substituted it with five spice powder. Doubled the marinade. Will at least triple next time. Reserved the marinade, brought to a boil and then cooked on low for about 20 minutes until it thickened. I sliced the meat into 1/4" slices and served it with the sauce. The sauce made this a hit with everyone. I don't know if I will ever be able to make pork tenderloin any other way.

This turned out tender & juicy with a wonderful flavor.  Next time I will cut back just a bit on the cinnamon and maybe the sugar, and add extra soy sauce.  If you like a sweet flavor, this is perfect as is.  I was pleasantly surprised that this was not dry (I cooked it in the oven after browning it in a skillet).

This is a wonderful recipe, Lisa, and I appreciate you sharing it. My whole family loved it, especially my youngest (the pickiest). I raved about it so much at work, 5 ladies asked for the recipe. Needless to say, they all loved it too. I used the raspberry wine vinegar, a favorite of mine, fresh onion and garlic, and there were only enough leftovers to make a sandwich the next day--and I used 2 and a half pounds of tenderloin and doubled the marinade. Butterflying the tenderloins makes for quick cooking on the grill after work. Again, we loved it!

The first couple of bites got your attention but then the taste seemed to fade quickly like a out-of-shape boxer in a 15 round fight. It's so-so.

EXCELLENT! I pan-fried my pork tenderloin since the grill scares me, but I just browned both sides of the tenderloin on high and then covered and cooked on low until a meat thermometer told me it was done. This is the best marinade, and plan to use it on a pork loin this summer.

Excellent!  Added rind of an orange to the marinade.  Hang on to the marinade and add to a saucepan with 1/4 cup of sherry and slowly cook down by half.  Wow!  We did it on our Weber (not gas!) and followed the directions in the Weber handbook.  Make sure you don't exceed that internal recommended temperature - that is key.

Can I give this more than five stars? Fabulous. Followed the recipe exactly and let the tenderloin marinate about 11 hours. Everyone loved this. Served with smashed chipotle sweet potatoes. Will make this over and over again.

OUTSTANDING.  Since there is just (2) of us, I get my Tenderloins in 3/4 lb sized.  I used the same amount of marinade and was only able to let it marinate for 2hrs and it was great.  I used the suggetion earlier - placed remaining marinade in sauce pan and brought it to a slow boil.  I let it simmer for about 35-40 minutes.  It thickened and looked beautiful on meat and GREAT on the tongue.  I substituted 'raspberry wine' vinegar for sherry.  My husband was detained at work and even after 1.5 hrs and re-warming in microwave it was SUPER moist and juicy.  Will be using this marinade for chicken as well.

So easy, So tender, So excellent.  I let it marinade for over 24 hours. I also baked it in the oven at 425 until just done.  Only complaint from the crew- I didn't make enough. This is a keeper for sure!!!

Found best if indirectly grilled with a
pan of water under the loin. Also injected some marinade into the loin. I find the loin doesn't alway absorb the marinade throughout. I then brush the loin and place over the coals to finish.

Exactly as is was first attempt. So good my family who swears they don’t like pork devoured it. Very tender, cooked on grill, to 145 degrees, then wrapped in foil to rest 15 minutes. So juicy and flavorful. A keeper.

Haven't made this since this past summer.  Did it again last night for small group with roasted veg's.  A fantastic recipe, no changes need other than double the sauce.  Pay close attention to grill time, it cooks faster than you think.  Stop at 140 degrees and you have perfection.

I have made this recipe several times.  I also added balsamic vinegar and the sherry.  I have seared it in a pan then baked and also grilled.  Without a doubt grilled is best!!  Marinate for at least 12 hours.  I also freeze one of the tenderloins after marinating for a quick dinner later in the week.

Delicious recipe!  I made it as listed and served it with freshly sautéed spinach and scalloped apples for side dishes.  It’s definitely a good idea to double the marinade, as we all wanted more.

We didn't have sherry, so I used balsamic and tasted delightful. Also, roasted in the oven because the weather didn't allow an outdoor barbecue. Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe!

The recipe is great, I let it marinade for 24 hours. It was super tender and flavorful.

THE best marinated grilled tenderloin I've ever made or eaten.  No alterations except for using onion powder rather than dried.  I can envision tweaks in the future.  Let meat marinate the longer the better, 24 hours or more.  So moist and flavorful, if you don't over cook it.  Left overs used in pork fried rice.  Delicious!

I added lots of fresh garlic. Just because u can't go wrong with it. I also marinated for 2 days. Perfectly fine. Not too salty. But I also use low sodium soy. Baked it for 1 hour @ 325 degrees. Very good

I doubled the marinade because I had more meat but accidently added too much sherry, a 1/2 cup instead of 4 T, and I only had it marinating for an hour and a half. I also used chopped onion because I didn't have any dried.I baked it in the oven with some potatoes and carrots and made gravy with the leftover marinade and some chicken broth and cornstarch. So good!! This may replace my roast recipe. The meat was so tender and I loved the flavor.

I made this as one reviewer did, using real onion and baking in the oven, and served over rice. It was great! One thing I'd like to mention though, is people don't usually say in their recipes, whether to bake covered or uncovered like they do in cookbooks. Just saying. 
Anyway, I baked this uncovered and will make again, but next time on the grill. (Love the taste of grilled food!)

I made two changes to this recipe:  I used an electric smoker, so it took a bit longer; and I marinated for 2 days because plans changed.  The additional time did not seem to change the texture, so let it go longer than specified if you need to.  I subbed coconut aminos for the soy sauce and honey for the sugar.  The cinnamon was an unusual addition.  It made the flavor seem like apples had been added.  I'm glad I have a tenderloin leftover for dinner another night.  Thanks for submitting this recipe!

Made this...marinated overnight.  So tender and moist.  Baked in oven instead of on BBQ and will make over and over again.  Would be delicious with chicken as well.

De-freakin-licious! Best part is that all the marinade ingredients are standard pantry items for me, and likely most other cooks. I marinated for about 7 hours, massaging it lovingly every few hours while it basted in the fridge.  I do not have a functional grill, so instead of grilling I seared on all sides in a cast iron skillet (about 2 minutes on 'top' and 'bottom' and then only an additional minute on each 'side'). I then finished in a 350' oven (a little over 25 minutes), and then let rest under foil for about another ten minutes before slicing it, and it was still nice and juicy inside with a tasty crust on the outside.  I did also boil and then reduce the leftover marinade and added a bit of cornstarch to thicken it for a sauce. I may have over-reduced or over-cornstarched as it ended up being more like a thick glaze than a sauce, but it was still crazy good!  This will be my go to pork tenderloin recipe from now on!

I made this yesterday.  Marinated it for 8 hours.  I had a huge strip loin I cut in three as there are only two of us.  Froze two pieces for later.  Took about an hour over indirect heat on the barbeque, probably because of the size.  Made gravy with the rest of the marinade.  The pork was SUBPERB !!!!  My husband loved it and the gravy.  I loved the pork, but not the gravy.  Just my peculiar tastes.  The meat was moist and full of flavour.  Having more tonight.  Last night served with a salad and baked potatoes.  Tonight with baked rice pilaf and a salad.  Yum.  Am keeping the recipe and expect to use it a lot.

Fantastic and easy to make!  I didn't change a thing and everyone loved it.  I have made it twice, once for my family in the oven and once for company at the lake on the grill and both times it came out juicy and very flavorful.  I actually marinated it for 3 days the first time and think the longer you marinate it the better.  I took the advise of another reviewer and boiled and reduced the marinade.  Served it with dinner rolls and pasta salad at the lake. Had the leftovers cold for lunch the following day.  This is a keeper!

Marinated for over 24 hours. Substituted smoked paprika for cinnamon, cooked on medium high grill, not high for 20 minutes exactly.  Tender and no leftovers , which means ultra deli cious and  easy too.

This is my stand-by for the late few years!  I up the brown sugar this time and everyone really like the "new" flavor!  I cook the tenderloins on a Traeger smoker at 350 about 20 minutes.  I use a meat thermometer and take them off at 135, let them stand for 10 minutes and they are always perfect. Served with BBQ on the side or some kind of Chutney.  Winner every time!

Best tenderloin I have ever made!!! Tripled the marinade so that I would have sauce to serve with it!! Since it is snow out, I took the suggestion to sear on stove top and cook for 30 minutes in oven at 350!! It came out so perfect!!

This was fantastic! I didn't have Sherry so I found a substitute online which was 1 Tbsp white vinegar, 1 tsp sugar and 1 Tbsp water and that's what I used.  I only had about 2 hours to marinate it and I cooked it in the oven on 350 for 1.5 hours instead of on a grill.  It was still amazing!  I will be making this again!

Tried this recipe tonight for a BBQ. I didn't have sherry so used red wine. I also used brown Splenda instead of brown sugar (not quite as sweet) We marinated about 6 hours and then grilled on the BBQ.
My guests really loved it and asked for the recipe.
We also did the trick with the marinade to make the gravy, as suggested by some other reviews, and that was really good.
It's a winner I'll use this one again.

The cinnamon just overpowered everything, and I LIKE cinnamon.  So, I will give it some points for ease, but just an OK rating on taste.  My husband agreed - there are MUCH better ways to prepare pork tenderloin.

This was absolutely amazing - I couldn't stop licking my fingers.  I took reviewers advice and made a gravy from some of the marinade.  I saved some and marinaded some venison steaks - delicious!  This was so good, I wanted to bath in it!  Thank you!  Update:  made one with the gravy and one without, we really liked it much better without the gravy though.  We threw the second one on the grill for 30 minutes - it was awesome!  I am making this again today, but have decided to add some fresh ginger and we'll see how that goes.

Delicious! The hint of cinnamon sets this apart from other soy sauce-based marinades. We really enjoyed it, served with rice and broccoli. Definitely recommend thickening the marinade with cornstarch and drizzling over pork and rice. I'll be preparing this often.

This is so yummy. I just made it last week and I'm making it again tonight. I did not use cinnamon and used marsala cooking wine I had on hand instead of sherry. I only marinated about 2 hours and it was still very flavorful.

The meat was very tender, but we really didn't like the flavor. I put in less cinnamon than the recipe called for, and it was still too much. Not at all a good combination of flavors.

Best marinade I've had yet for pork! Only made a few changes. Did not have any sherry so substituted white Zinfandel. Because our family likes a hickory taste when grilling, I added a couple of drops of liquid smoke. Family loved it so much we are making it for Easter!

Delicious. This definitely is on the sweet side. Reducing the marinade and making a sauce is a must. I seared the tenderloin in a cast iron skillet and then tossed the whole thing in the oven to finish cooking.

This is the best pork tenderloin marinade my family and I have ever had.  We love it with no substitutions!

I just made this tonight.  I am not much of a "measurer" but I used all of the ingredients listed and let it marinate 5 hours.  Grilled it and it is delicious.  I boiled the left over marinade and poured it over the tenderloins after I took them off the grill.  Will definitely do this one again.  Sweet, moist and a delicious flavor.

I am constantly trying new marinades but after trying this one, my husband told me to stop looking!  This was delicious!  I made a sauce to serve with the tenderloin by using the remaining marinade.  I boiled the marinade and added 1 T corn starch with chicken broth and added it to the remaining marinade; cooked, stirring constantly until thickened.

Delicious!  I too had to do the balsamic vinegar for sherry substitution because I didn't have any sherry on hand.  I don't know how this could taste any better but I'll try the sherry next time!  I marinated the pork overnight.   I used the recommendation to heat up the marinade on the stove and add some cornstarch to make a gravy and that was also amazing!

This was delicious!  I didn't have quite enough time to marinate for 12 hours - but did for six.  I baked it at 350 for an hour and just under the 170 degrees.  I'm sure it continues to cook a bit and it made for a very tender, flavorful roast.  I didn't have Sherry and used white wine instead.  Will make this again.

This pork is really good; however, if you boiled the marinade down and used it as a gravy, I can't imagine what your blood pressure would be like.  I tried this and it is sooo salty, I can't imagine how anyone could eat it..  Follow the recipe which said to discard it!

Made this tonight.  I'm not a fan of pork, but my kids love it, so I make it all the time.  This turned out absolutely delicious!  The kids couldn't eat it fast enough! Even I loved it!  I omitted the cinnamon as per reviewers suggestions and doubled the marinade then used it for gravy.  Will make this over and over again!

This is one of the best pork loins I have made to date.  I doubled all the ingredients except the cinnamon.  Also used 4 cloves of fresh garlic in place of garlic powder.  Marinated it for 7 hours and put it on the grill till it hit a temp of 148.  Next time I may leave out the cinnamon.

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!  I took the advice of other reviewers and doubled the marinade, used fresh minced garlic and finely chopped red onion rather than dried.  I also used only 1 tsp of cinnamon rather than 2 because that's more to our taste.  The gravy was scrumptious served over mashed potatoes, and the pork melted in our mouths -- no knife required.  We weren't sure the sweetness would work for us, but it certainly did.  My husband and I both adored this recipe and look forward to making it again soon.

I did the recipe and then I used a warmed sour cherry chutney I make toplace over top after slicing. Added sweet potato double baked, string beans with slivered almonds and it was a wonderful supper.

This marinade nicely tenderized the pork, however, the cinnamon overpowered the other flavors leaving a strange aftertaste that drew comments from all family members.  Everyone "liked" the pork, but voted never to have it again!  Too much cinnamon!

This recipe was great! The only thing i did different was use a clove of garlic (or two, i love garlic lol) instead of the powder, and did the same for the onion. It turned out great! I will definitely be doing this one again!

By mistake I used 1/3 of each soy, and brown sugar (but it worked!). I cut a pork loin (much less expensive) in thick "steak like" pieces, marinated them and grilled ~ FABULOUS! Perfect for a summer dinner party!

Made this for supper tonight and it was worthy of all the raving reviews.  I roasted the tenderloins in the oven at 350 for 1 hr after marinading overnight. I thickened the marinade and added it to fried brown rice with mushrooms, onions and peas.  Very delicious.  I did leave out the cinnamon and sherry for personal preferance.

One word: Amazing. I doubled the marinade and cooked it in the oven at 350 degrees for an hour and then finished it up under the broiler for about 3 minutes per another member's review. I wish I had made two tenderloins! My boyfriend and I devoured the entire thing in no time and I would have loved to have leftovers!

I found the recipe was really good.  I think I would try inserting some of the flavouring into the middle of the roast to add more flavour.

This was good.  Cut in half as just hubby & I and marinated 2 loin chops we were planning to grill.  Only marinated for about 2 hrs, but chops were small and gave it great flavor.  I did as others suggested and boiled marinated with water & cornstarch - - - didn't go well with the rest of our meal, but would be great over rice (more Asian flavored than I anticipated).  Good recipe - will make again.

followed other suggestions to double sauce, except cinnamon and did the onion/garlic thing... boiled to thicken and used marinade as sauce...great flavour, and yes, the cinnamon is the 'secret' ingredient in this that really brings out the full flavour.... a keeper for sure... can't wait to try it on ribs!!!

Great marinade!  The sherry and cinnamon make for an interesting twist on the usual soy sauce/brown sugar/oil combination.

Far too sweet. The sugar hides the taste of the meat. If you're looking for a savory recipe I would not recommend this.

My husband does NOT like pork of any kind, but when I make this he humms as he eats it.  It is so good and tender.  I've made it on the grill and in the oven.  I did increase the marinade and boil down as a gravy like the others said.  I also omitted the cinnamon.  We aren't fans.  Thank you for an awesome recipe.

awesome. great call reserving the marinade and boiling it with a bit of cornstarch, it made the recipe perfect. Almost like a homemade hoisin sauce. This will be my go-to tenderloin marinade from now on. Thanks!

This was very good.  The whole family liked it.  Followed the recipe except for using fresh minced onion and doubling the sauce for our taste but not quite doubling the cinnamon.  2nd time I made this I baked it in the oven (snow outside!) and it turned out good as well.  I did not double the sauce and it was fine but I only used 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, in my opinion a whole tsp. would be way overpowering.   I paired it with diced roasted sweet potatoes and green beans which worked very well.

Wowzers-this was fantastic!  I didn't have the sherry and used balsamic vinegar instead and followed the other tips and added 1tbsp of cornstartch to make a gravy.  Excited to try this with beef. Thanks!

I thought this spice mix was very good.  I only gave it 4 stars because of the salt content.  I cut the salt in half, still found it a bit salty, so will cut a bit more next time I mix some, and since I did not have coriander on hand, I used cumin with very good results.

This recipe is exceptional!  I double it (with the exception of the cinammon) as mentioned for gravy. I only marinated it for 1-1/2 hours and it was the most tender pork I have ever eaten!  My husband loved it too!

I thought this would be a great recipe, since we love all the ingredients individually.  It was okay, but it was too sweet for me.  And with the sauce, the pork was masked almost entirely, although I did not have that much sauce.  I will give it another try.

Seriously, the reviews are right - this pork is amazing and so juicy!  I heated the grill to medium-ish, then turned the meat every 5-7 or so minutes for about 20 minutes until the temp reached 160.   I pulled it off and let it sit (covered with foil) for 5-10 minutes before slicing.  Delicious!!  I had read other reviews about making gravy but this soooo does not need it (and I'm usually a gravy fan).

I made the marinade exactly as the recipe called for but I roasted the tenderloin as the grill has been put away. This was tender and perfectly flavoured! Absolutely wonderful! Even my picky eater asked for seconds.  Thanks for the recipe. I will make it again and again.

This is delicious!!  My husband is not a pork fan but agreed to "taste" this dish.  He LOVED it.  The cinnamon creates a very surprising spin.  I bought a 2  pound tenderloin instead of two.  After marinating for 7 hours, I seared the loin on a grill pan and then baked until internal temperature was 160.  I let it sit for 5 minutes before slicing.  I reserved the marinade and boiled it to serve with the slices.  Will prepared this regularly.

This was excellent.  I didn't grill it (out of propane!), so I seared it first in a pan, then roasted in the oven at 350.  Delicious - this recipe is a keeper!

Great flavor.  As others suggested, I substituted balsamic vinegar for the sherry and eliminated the cinnamon.  I cooked the tenderloin on the grill for just 1.5 minutes per side, then finished it in the oven.  Very tender and delicious!

This just wasn't very good.  My son who loves pork complained.  Brown sugar and cinammon just shouldn't be on meat.  The family ate it, but asked that I not make it again.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe but it didn't turn out exactly how I wanted it to and it may be because we oven baked it rather than grilled it.  I marinaded it for about 12 hours but I really don't think the ingredients soaked in the meat.  I doubled the ingredients to make the sauce (everything except the cinnamon) and made a roux with cornstarch.  It was juicy and the flavoring was good, just the color of the final product wasn't pretty.  I wish it was more caramelized or browned.  I did oven bake it on 400 for 40 minutes, used 1 pork tenderloin equiv. to 1.7 pounds and used real onion instead of minced and real garlic instead of powder.  Also used pumpkin spice (mostly cinnamon anyway) rather than just cinnamon.  Since the sauce is so flavorful I made with steamed carrots, salt and peppered and the Honey Roasted Red Potatoes from the website to balance out the flavor.  Will try browning the outside next time but did like it overall.  NOTE:  The sherry is a must! You can find at any grocery store by the vinegar.

This was just ok for us.  I followed the recipe exactly, except that I used organic tamari for the soy sauce (essentially it is soy sauce).  The pork and the gravy I made with the marinade seemed really salty to us.  Granted, we hardly use any salt in our cooking, so for others it probably is not overkill salty.  Just seemed that way to our tastes.

This was great!  I followed other reviews and doubled the marinade and then made it into a gravy for serving.  Pair it with mashed potatoes and a spinach salad - what a great meal.  I will make again and again.

I'd give this 5 stars except that I had to use apple juice instead of sherry.  I'd LOVE to try it with the sherry!  I don't normally keep it on hand however...I'm going to try this marinade tonight on pork chops and use my grill pan.  I'll be using this marinade over and over and over!

Maybe I just have different tastes, but this was terrible! I am not one who usually complains about everything but I followed the reciepe and this just tasted bad. Very disappointed after all the rave reviews. Even discarded the left overs as it didn't even make a decent cold pork sammy.

Excellent! Did not have Sherry so used some white wine instead. Best tenderloin we ever had on the grill. I only marinated this for 3 hours and it was outstanding. Had I let it sit over night it would have been 10 stars I am sure.

I made this recipe last night and served it along with 'Grilled Pineapple Mango Salsa" from this site.  I doubled the marinade recipe, used fresh garlic (2 big cloves) and 1 large shallot in place of the dried onion and I only used 1 tsp of cinnamon.  The end result was really delicious - we will make this pork again because it was delicious even without the salsa.

Excellent marinade.  I substituted lemon juice for the sherry because I didn't have any.  I also left out the cinnamon. Very good, thank you!!

I'm usually not a fan of pork. But this was really good. The only substitution I made was, instead of sherry I used apple juice as others has suggested. I only marinated it for 4 hrs. I can't wait to see how great it is when it is marinated longer.

I subbed grape juice for the sherry, otherwise followed the recipe.  Very very good.  I did have to cut the sauce w/chicken stock because it was so sweet which was due to the grape juice.  This will be our go to recipe for pork tenderloin from now on!  (I marinated them for 7 hours.)  Thanks, WKeller!

A little sweet but pretty good.  Was a hit with the family.  Couldn't find cinnamon so left that out of the recipe, but will put it in next time.

This recipe was a HUGE hit in my house.  The flavors work amazingly well together and the cinnamon, sherry and onions add a depth and subtlety to the flavor that left several of my guests stumped and trying to identify the wonderful combination.  This recipe was quickly added to the recipe box, because as the weather changes and I'm grilling more, this will be on the menu often.    Everyone from children to adults raved about the tenderloin.  I couldn't recommend this higher.  Three recommendations/suggestions... make sure to NOT OVERCOOK.  Also make sure to pull the tenderloin off the grill shy of your finish point.  Let the meat rest.  While it's resting the meat will gain 1/2 to a full temperature and this will seal in the juices, so that as soon as you cut the meat, the juices aren't just lying at the bottom of the plate with some well flavored shoe leather above them.  Lastly, use tongs when turning... don't puncture the meat.  That just gives the juice a place to run out.  Enjoy!

This went over really well with my husband who ate all the leftovers. A good sign of whether he liked something is if he will eat it for breakfast the next day over cereal. This turned into a breakfast meal. I seared mine on a grill pan on the stove top then baked for 40 minuted at 400. I also turned the marinade into gravy.

Yummy!  I cooked this thinking that it wasnt going to be as good as everyone let on, but i was wrong.  I seared mine on the stove (my grill broke) and then stuck it in the oven for 20 minutes on 375.  I closed it up in foil to keep most of the juices in . I only marinated it for 3 hours and still it was great.  This recipe stays in my resipe box!!!

Will definitely be making again.  I did not have sherry so I used apple juice.  This had a very nice light flavor, not super overpowering like soy sauce can sometimes do.  Yum!

Devoured by my family. Don't make just one. Didn't have sherry, so I subbed rice wine but slightly less than the amount of sherry called for. I used fresh onion and doubled the marinade (except the cinnamon), which was became a tasty gravy.

Liked this quite a bit.  I had only 4 hours to marinate, but still a lot of flavor.  it was too cold to grill outside, so I started cooking in a grill pan on the stovetop, about 4 minutes per side-- then finished it in the oven (at 350 for about 15 minutes).

I made this the other day and my husband loooooved it! I altered the recipe a little bit based on other reviews. I added apple juice in place of the sherry because I didn't have any. Instead of grilling it I cooked it in a pan just long enough to get a nice crust (yum) and then a put it in the oven, pan and all on 400 for 40 minutes. It came out so moist and the marinade is the best!  This is the only way I'll cook port tenderloins from now on. Def. my new favorite. :D

Mmmmm.... This was delicious!  I prepared the marinade as directed, substituting fresh garleic and onions for the dried, but only had about 3 or 4 hours to let it sit.  I baked it at 400 for about 45 minutes and it turned out perfect!  The pork had a carmelized crust on it that I really liked, too.  Mmm!  I'll definitely be making this again.

Wow, this was really, really good.  I posted the link on facebook, so others may try it.  I did not have any sherry or olive oil, so I subbed grape juice and canola oil.  I boiled the marinade after taking the meat out, and thickened it with some corn starch.  It was a wonderful gravy/dipping sauce.  My whole family loved it and I will be making it a lot more in the future.  Please try it!

Excellent flavor! I cut my tenderloin into medalions and marinated it that way. Then I seared the pieces in oil in my cast iron skillet to obtain a crisp coating, lowered the fire and added what was left of the marinade w/ some broth. When the pork pieces were finished I removed them and cooked down the marinade/broth. Then I added sliced apples to the sauce, some flour and a bit of broth and milk and made a wonderful "apple gravy". My husband loved it.

I'm eating this right now, after making it the first time. I made it exactly as directed (except accidentally marinading for two days) and it's very good. I wasn't sure how the cinnamon would work with the other flavors, or if I would even be able to taste it. The cinnamon comes through clearly, although not overwhelmingly, and blends well with the other flavors. Recommended.

this recipe was excellent!  i did double the marinade, except for the cinnamon, let it marinade for well over 12 hours, and cooked it for 1 hr. in the oven at 350 degrees.  i couldnt taste the cinnamon flavor at all - or at least it wasnt noticeable by any means.  the tenderloin was very moist and went great with the ultimate twice baked potatoes on this site.  thanks!!!

I wanted this recipe to work for me so badly that this is probably the fourth or fifth time I have made it. Problems sprang with the first tries. I used the oven the first time but the smoke detector went off due to my young experience cooking meat. The second time I overcooked it (both times using pork chops). These last times I used a flat iron steak and a grilling machine. I wanted the meat more tender than when I had the chops, so I killed it even more with a fork and then used another cooking utensil. I only marinated it for about 2 or 3 hours. I grilled it for about 3 or 4 minutes. SUCCESS finally!! It came out restaurant quality. This time, it was SO simple to make. Thank you so much!!

Followed the recipe exactly.  Gtilled the pork and it turned out moist, but the marinade didn't necessary infuse the pork with flavor.  Also because of the sugar, you have to watch it on the grill and turn frequently in order for it not to burn.

VERY good, a big hit at our cookout with friends. I used fresh onion and garlic as well (my boyfriend loves onions so he put a whole on in there while I wasn't looking) I didn't have any sherry on hand so I substituted about 1/4 cup of dry white wine and it came out magnificent, everyone loved it, even the kid who doesn't like onions.

I can't believe I haven't rated this recipe yet! I have made this over and over and it is our favorite way to enjoy pork tenderloin. I have even grilled it ahead of time then reheated in my crock pot with some of the marinade in order to take it to potlucks. Always get rave reviews and requests for the recipe. I slice the meat before marinating , then grill the slices to get more of the great flavor in the meat.

This is a great dish, but reminds both my husband and I of a Holiday Dish.  I followed the advice to bake at 400 degrees for 40 mins and it came out great!

Very good!  I love the cinnamon.  This would have been outstanding cooked on a grill.  But since we don't currently have one, I had to use my oven (425 for about 25 minutes).  Regardless, it turned out great.

this a a great marinade.  I halved the cinnamon and added 2 tsp freshly grated ginger.  It was awesome!  Served with the creamy champagne sauce on this site with the pork tenderloin.

Yummy flavor and oh-so-tender.  Seared the tenderloin in a pan for about 2-3 mins on all sides, then roasted in the oven at 350 for about 40 mins.  Done to perfection.  Will make again just with about 1/2 the cinnamon (even though I love cinnamon, there was just a tad too much of it for me.)

This marinade was fabulous!  My family loved it and couldn't get enough, there were no leftovers!  The only thing I did different was use 2 medium sized onions sliced instead of the dry minced, and I also made a gravy out of the leftover marinade in the pan that the pork roasted in.  Outstanding!  Thank you!

I made this once with tenderloin and it was phenominal. Tried a week later with butterflied pork chops, not so good. I am guessing it was the cut of pork?

*WOW*
this is just excellent-I used 1/2 splenda brown sugar for the brown sugar.

I followed the recommendations of other users, made at least double the marinade and made the sauce afterwards.

Thanks for sharing

This was delicious. I was hesitant about the cinnamon, but went with it, and it brought it all together perfectly.

I marinated it for about 5 hours in an oven safe bag, then I just placed it all in a glass pan, and baked it at 350 for about 45 min. It was tender, juicy and the gravy left in the bag was divine. Clean up was a cinch.

My whole family absolutely loves this recipe. (Well, except for the vegetarian.) It's so convenient to marinate in a plastic bag.  My boy scouts have taken this recipe camping, just mixed up the marinade in a bag before they left. I typically grill it longer than the recipe says, but that is probably because I can never find anything as small as 3/4 pound tenderloins.  My husband perfers it medium (25-30 minutes on medium indirect heat on our Weber).  I prefer it done (30-40 minutes).  But those times are are for 1+ lb tenderloins.  The leftovers are great in "Southwest pork and bean salad".  If there are any leftovers, that is.

Wow!  I don't even like pork and I went back for seconds!  I doubled the marinade recipe for a 2 lb. tenderloin, and baked instead of grilled.  I wish I would have grilled it, though.  After tasting this, I can imagine how the marinade would carmelize on the grill and make it even better!  I also used fresh onion instead of dried, and made the gravy that another reviewer suggested.  Definitely try this recipe!

Good marinade, too sweet for my taste, my son did eat it though and that says a lot!  May try again and cut back on some of the brown sugar and add garlic as some reviewers suggested.

Delicious!  I am not usually to fond of pork, but this was excellent.  I marinated it for 24 hrs like others suggested.  I pan seared it and then baked it in the oven.  It was very tender, more so than any other pork recipe I've tried.  My husband and 2 year old loved this as well!  Can't wait to make this again!

I used pre-sliced boneless pork chops.  I don't really like pork, but this was really great.  I cooked it on a George Foreman grill for about 6 minutes.

Wow.  So delicious!!!  I marinated a 1lb. tenderloin for almost 2 days (okay.. I accidentally forgot about it)... threw it in the oven at 325 for 1 hour.  I then made an additional batch of the marinade, thickened it a saucepan, and poured it over rice and the sliced pork.  DELICIOUS!  A very good fall meal!  I cannot wait to make it again!

When I made this I baked it in the oven. I added several  thickly sliced apples to the pan and poured the rest of the marinade in the pan. It was very good, especilly with the apples. Just watch so the marinade doesn't burn. I covered it loosly with foil toward the end. It was yummy!

I was very hesitant to try this recipe, but after reading all the positive reviews I went ahead. I was reluctant due to the cinnamon...I just couldn't imagine that much cinnamon on a tenderloin. The taste seemed okay, but I think the cinnamon was a bit overpowering and almost bitter. I think if you cut back on the cinnamon, and added a little more brown sugar, the flavor would balance out. I took the leftovers (which were actually better) and barbequed them.

This was excellent.  I purchased a 2 lb tenderloin and cut it in two.  Marinated as suggested using white wine vinegar since I didn't have sherry.  Then I put one portion on the grill for 30 mins. approximately and put the other aside for tomorrow evening.  I saved the marinade as others suggested.  Mixed in some cornstarch with a 1/2 or so of water and thickened it.  Drizzled over meat and had enough forr tomorrow night's portion also.  Would make a great, unusual dish for company. Definitely going into my files.

This is, in fact, the best tasting pork that I have ever had.  My hubby and I have made it countless times for friends and family, and EVERYONE takes the recipe home.  We have also made it in the oven when we ran out of gas for the grill.  375 degrees for 30 minutes or so...we cut the tenderloins in half.  Thank you for an excellent recipe!

I am not a very experienced cook, and I was still able to pull this one off.  I took some others' suggestions to make gravy out of the sauce, but I guessed at how much cornstarch to add, and I think mine was a little too thick...  But for the recipe, I tripled the marinade (dinner for 11) for about 9 lbs of tenderloin.  I marinated the pork for about 6 hours before roasting in the oven.  I roasted it at 350 for about 40 minutes (until the meat was 150). I let it sit for about 15 minutes before serving.  Everyone raved and asked to take home the leftovers.

Superb!  I made exactly as is and poured into freezer safe ziploc bags, along with 4 chops per bag.  Just defrost and cook for a flavorful meal!

I was disappointed with this recipe after all the good reviews.  Hubby and I did NOT like the taste of the cinnamon.  If I ever did try again I would omit the cinnamon, as we did like the sweetness of the marinade.

I had never made a tenderloin before, so I really needed some advice!  This turns out great.  I was amazed to have sherry on hand so I made it exactly as written.  I used another reviewer's idea and baked it at 350 for about an hour and basted with the marinade.  My teenager thought it tasted like Honey Baked Ham!  We thought it was great.  I will make this again...so easy but still a good company meal that you don't have to spends hours cooking!

My husband and I have made this several times and I wish I could give it so many more stars.  This is now the ONLY way we make pork tenderloin, and we absolutely go crazy for it!  I'd love to try some other tenderloin recipes, but each time it comes down to it, we just crave this one!  Try it, it's the best!  The only thing we do different is we marinate the meat in the fridge overnight (flip the meat in the morning, then let it marinate until dinner time) and we marinate the meat frequently while it grills with the leftover marinade (leaving the meat to cook for an additional 2-3 min at the end to cook off any raw pork juices.)  THE BEST!

This is the best pork we have eaten!!  I used red wine vinegar instead of sherry - but followed otherwise, great!
Have made this several times!  Last night, boiled the marinade, then cooked mushrooms in the sauce - amazing!!!

WOW!! what a fantastic recipe!! I did use red wine vinegar in place of the sherry, and I added a few grinds of a spice mixture called 'Heat Wave'. I served it with roasted sweet potato wedges and sauteed spinach with baby portabello mushrooms and grape tomatoes in olive oil and garlic...yum!!
I will be serving this along with Christmas turkey this year.

Great recipe.  The flavors that come through are delicious.  I grilled for about 25-30 minutes and then I took the leftover marinade sauce and boiled on the stove.  Sauted fresh mushrooms in butter and then added the boiled marinade sauce together with the mushrooms.  The whole family enjoyed.  Served with burnt butter rice from this site.  A keeper for sure!  Thanks Lisa

This was fabulous!  You couldn't meet a pickier eater than myself and my husband, and well, we loved this.  While I like sweet stuff, my husband doesn't, so I was worried this would be too sweet for him.  But he surprisingly loved it.  Because of the rain, I broiled it for about 30 minutes, and I can't wait to make it on the grill to see if it's even better.

I will make this again and again.

This was delicious. Very easy to prepare, and cooked in no time on the grill. My husband grilled a 2 1/4lb roast in 20 minutes.  I'm surprised by the reviews of it being too sweet.  I thought it had a perfect "maple" flavor.  This is a keeper.

This was good.  I prefer grilled meats to oven-cooked whenever possible but had to use the oven this time.  I felt it needed something so I prepared the cooked apple topping from the Caramel Apple Pork Chops recipe.  A delicious addition I highly recommend.

This was fantastic.  I baked it as well at about 325 for about a half hour.  I also boiled the leftover sauce from the bag and used it as a sauce for the tenderloin.  Thanks for the recipe.

I'll be honest--I started not to try this recipe because the cinnamon did not sound like a flavor I would want with pork but the 5-star rating convinced me to try it.  I'm glad I did.  I followed the recipe exactly as given and served it Christmas night as one of my finger-foods with home-made angel biscuits and jezebel sauce.  I received many compliments!

Thanks for a great recipe. I marinated this for 24 hrs and then cooked it on the grill-very tender. I substituted red wine for the sherry and it was very good.

This makes a wonderfully tender and juicy pork tenderloin.  I made the marinade exactly as described, then put it and my tenderloin in a plastic bag in the freezer.  A week later I thawed it all out in the fridge over a 24 hour period.  I boiled the marinade and served it on the side but it was TOO SALTY for anyone to eat.  My whole family loved it, but we all agreed it was a touch on the salty side.  I rarely salt anything so we're probably just salt sensitive.  I'll definitely be making this one again but will use low-sodium soy sauce.

This was OK, but the cinnamon was overpowering, and I didn't find it an appealing complement to the pork.

Delicious, I added 1 bundle of fresh brocolli chopped to this recipe to make a complete dish.  Husband and kids both love it!

Very tasty marinade.  My pork turned out tender and juicy.  I served it at a big family dinner, and got rave reviews.  Thanks for the great recipe.  Definitely a keeper!

SOOO GOOD.  We typically have frozen pork tenderloin in the house, so I made the marinade and put it in with the frozen pork - so it marinated while defrosting.  The pork was so tender and so flavorful.  A huge hit in my house!

In a rush, I was only able to marinate this for about 1 1/2 hrs., and it was incredibly good!  I can only imagine how it would be if marinated for the recommended time!  It was devoured quickly and raved about.  Even my picky four year old loved it!  Mmmmmmm!

Stumbled across this recipe and tried it with the pork tenderloin.  It was wonderful and I was amazed it is the same marinade that a local butcher shop uses for chicken and beef kabobs.  A definite keeper!!!!

This is a great recipe -- even without the tenderloin -- just add a little more vinegar for tenderizing.  Also, fresh rosemary really enhances the overall flavor.

My husband loves this.  i put the tenderloin in the marinade  in a zip loc and tossed it in the refigerator and forgot about it. I  took it out 2 days later  and cooked it.  I also made double the marinade and boiled it down for a dipping sauce.

I did follow recipe ingredient list.  But I had to alter the cooking process because I didn't have time to marinate the pork.  So I simply put the meat and marinade in my pressure cooker.  It was delicious.  Specifically, I browned the 5/8" thick pork medallions in a bit of olive oil, put them in the pressure cooker with the marinade and set the cooker to 8 minutes. Yum.  I then removed the pork, added a Tablespoon of cornstarch to the marinade/juices, stirred until thickened and served over the pork along with mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli with lemon and butter.  Yum Yum.

I did make this and it was very good. The only real change (not by choice) was I used Marsala cooking wine because I discovered my lush cat sitter drank up all my Sherry! I’m sure it would have been even better with Sherry. One thing I do with any meat I marinade is poke the living daylights out of it alternating with a couple of forks. Those deep holes allow the marinade flavor to penetrate the meat.

I've made this recipe many times. It is easy to do.  I like to let marinade over night and then grill on the bbq.  I sear on high heat on the bbq then reduce heat on the side where the meat is and increase the heat on the opposite side and make it somewhat like a convection roaster.

I used port instead of sherry.  Marinated for a day.  Bbq'd for 25 minutes.   Let rest then sliced.  The flavour was lovely and was a real hit.  Served with pan fried potatoes and onion topped with sour cream and a medley of vegetables.   Will definitely make this again.

This is the best pork tenderloin recipe!! I have been making this for a couple of years now.  The only change that I make is I add minced fresh onion and fresh garlic.  I made four tenderloins  and mine where about 1.25 lbs each so I tripled the marinade and added about 1 cup of fresh minced onion and about 5 cloves minced garlic. I marinade it for about 24 hours and we always grill it. I like the added cinnamon.  I have even froze the tenderloin in the marinade and my son brought it back to college to make and it turns out great! Such amazing flavor! Thank you so much for sharing your recipe!

Oh my gosh. . .this is AMAZING! I did exactly like it said except I did 1/4 tsp of onion powder instead of the dried minced onion. I cooked it over medium heat on the grill for 4 mins on both sides, then I moved the pork on the top rack and cooked for another 4 mins on both sides. I boiled the marinade and added some flour, then I brushed that all over the pork when it was done cooking. It was super moist, perfectly flavored. . .just amazing. My husband has been complimenting it every bite and my 2 year old is eating the pork faster than we are cutting it up.

The first time I made this was for Family with picky boys. I didn’t have any Sherry, so I substituted a travel size bottle of cognac. Since then I usually use some type of whiskey or bourbon, and it comes out great. The family gave it five stars, and I use it for my “go-to” dish for company Meals and covered dish dinners. People ask me to bring “that pork tenderloin dish you make.”

I added ginger and used divine baking spice.  I have used this recipe on chicken as well as pork and omg it's amazing.  
This is my second time making it so this time I warmed up the mixture to help the sugar melt . 
Love it !

Delicious! I cut back the cooking time for my 1.07lb tenderloin to 35 minutes and it was cooked perfectly. Will definitely make again.

Very Good, I used fresh onion and garlic - doubled the recipe for marinade, use scant t of cinnamon.
Will make again. Seared on grill and then roasted in oven to
140 degrees.  Very moist

A hit for the whole family - even the kids!  Will surely make it again!  I did double the marinade and then used it as a gravy by boiling and adding some corn starch.  I usually make pork tenderloin in the oven, but used the grill as it said.  It was easy and saved cooking time.

I had my husband grill marinated sections of the big piece of pork loin but it came out much drier than I would have liked, unfortunately.  Next time I will bake it in the oven as I know it will come out tender and juicy and flavourful.

I made the marinade as stated, but used a 1 pound tenderloin, and let it marinate over night. Instead of baking it in the oven, I sous vide cooked the tenderloin at 149 degrees for 90 minutes. I saved the marinade to make a sauce as others suggested. The tenderloin came out super tender and moist, but this may have been as a result of the sous vide cooking.  It was nicely flavored by the marinade which was not overwhelming. I thought the sauce was OK, but my husband like it a lot. The sauce came out on the thick side, so I probably should have added some water to thin it a bit.

Great recipe. I had a 1.5 lb tenderloin so cut the recipe in half. Didn't use salt as the soy sauce provided plenty. Added a pinch of brown sugar. It was great! Marinated in a gallon zip-lock bag and hour before baking. This recipe is super easy and delivers. Will add to our weekly rotation. Thanks for sharing!

I have now made this multiple times for guests, and every time it has had rave reviews with people wanting the recipe!

My only change is that I add 1/4 vs 2 TBSP of olive oil to the marinade.  Also: I pull it off the grill/oven when the thermometer reaches 160 degrees.  I have found that it cooks way to much after that and I then have a dry piece of meat.  Let it rest with a towel or something over it to hold in the heat until ready to serve approx. 5-10 minutes.

My family really like this recipe.   I subsitituted Sherry to leftover white wine (if I have any), and it tastes good as well.  I also put it into conventional oven instead of grill for 350 degrees, 45 minutes.  And it came out just right.  Cooked, but not over cooked at all.  Meat is so juicy and flavorable.   Love it.

This is fabulous.  Going to make again very soon.  Marinade was easy to make and I didn't change anything.  I marinated one large pork tenderloin in plastic bag for about 6 hours.  Roasted the tenderloin at 400 degrees for 25 minutes.  It was a nice pink inside and so juicy.  Served rice pilaf as a side and heated up the remaining marinade to pour over meat and rice.  This would be great for pork chops too.

I followed the recipe except for the cinnamon because I don't like it. I have made this twice and serve with grilled pineapple and salad. My husband thinks this is the best pork tenderloin he's ever eaten. Thanks for the recipe. I will put this in my rotation of recipes.

Made this tonight and everyone loved it. Had one small frozen tenderloin that I took out and marinated with double sauce (but only 1 tsp cinnamon) Cooked stove top with sauce (rained in Phoenix tonight - surprise!) When pork reached 150 degrees, took off heat. Separated sauce and added cornstarch and water to thicken. Served with sweet corn and multi-grain rice. Kids liked it, husband and I liked it. 8 year old thought the cinnamon was strong, husband didn't think so. Next time with double sauce with 1.5 tsp cinnamon and try grilling it! Delicious and a saver! Thanks!

Excellent!  I used balsamic vinegar in place of the sherry, marinated about 7 hours, seared in a cast iron skillet, and then finished in a 375 oven for about 40 minutes. Will definitely use this recipe again.

Like many I tweaked it. Left out only the onion flakes, and garlic powder. Replaced with 2 tbsp minced garlic for the marinade. doubled the marinade for gravy.
Had a lot of dinner for two, so served twice. Once without marinade served with applesauce and au gratin potatoes, string beans.
Couple nights later served with mashed potatoes abd fresh carrots ( marinaded a few hours in brown sugar) and the saved marianade from 2 nights before. 
Both times delicious!
Still had leftovers, sliced into  medallions and frozen in food saver bags. I can make the marrinade separate again for 3 weeks down the road

I bought some plain tenderloins on sale and wanted to try something a little different. This was a little sweet and the cinnamon complimented the sweetness and the meat perfectly. Definitely staying in the favorites box!

This is one of the best recipes I've ever gotten !! I've made it several times. I made it as written and with the raspberry vinegar. Both are great. If you try it with the raspberry vinegar; use only high quality. I get mine from Vom Fass.  You can find the online and they have shops.

Loved it!. Have ruined pork tenderloin in the past but this one turn out great. Did not modify recipe. Made the marinade into a glaze but it wasn't very flavorful alone but was great in the meat!

This was a little different, but good. I made it exactly as written, although to cook I seared in a pan and then put it in the oven for 20 minutes because I don't have a gill. You can definitely taste the cinnamon in this, but it was sweet and flavorful.

Make exactly as recipe instructed and found this to be too sweet.  Had to tone down the sweetness when making gravy from the left-over marinade.

Good recipe, tenderloin was moist & marinade flavor came through. I have done this one several times & the outcomes have been consistent. Do this with a grilled asparagus & your favorate flavoring sauce.

Okay, after using Allrecipes for 5+ years, this is the recipe that gets my first review.  I made this last night for my family with rave reviews - which is no small task at my house.  I had to double the marinade because what I thought was a two-pack of tenderloins turned out to be one ginormous 5-lb pork loin, and I subbed my own minced garlic and 4 chopped scallions for the garlic and onion.  Baked in the oven on 350, covered, for an hour and a half and then let it rest another ten minutes.  It was soo yummy.  I took the other reviewers' suggestions and made a gravy with the leftover marinade.  That was too strong for my taste, but my husband and daughter loved it.  I made this with the coconut rice and the pineapple slaw on this site, and some broccoli for green, and it was wonderful.  I will be making this again soon!

Very good.  Simple to make.  We kept the marinade from the pork, boiled it and simmered to reduce then used it as a finished glaze for the meat at the table;very good.

Made the marinade according to the recipe, but placed the tenderloin in a roasting pan and covered it with foil. Cooked at 350 for 1 hour it came out perfect!  The pork was juicy and tender. I will definitely make this again.

Came out moist and nice flavor.  It's nice to cook pork loin in different ways. Definitely make it again. Left overs heat up nicely.  Relatively simple to make, just have to plan a bit ahead to marinade.

I opted to cook it into the slowcooker (4hrs on low) - turned out great!  I made it double portion, and to that, I added 1/4 cup honey and 4 garlic cloves.  Next time I'll try it with maple syrup instead of the honey.

I made this recipe the other day for dinner. My husband is still raving about it. He states this was the best  pork tenderloin I have made and to save this recipe.  The only thing I changed was using the balsamic vinegar instead of sherry as another person stated. I also did't have sherry.

My family and I did not care for this.  Although the meat was very tender, the cinnamon seemed to overpower the other flavors.  I might try it again and omit the cinnamon.

I made a few changes because of my family's tastes. I did not use cinnamon and substituted a very nice Tempranillo in place of sherry. I also added a bit of lemon juice. I marinated for 25 hours then baked at 400 F for an hour and 15 minutes. I followed someone else's suggestion to make the marinade into a roux and added mushrooms. It came out perfectly and I will definitely make again.

This recipe is on repeat at our house! The only thing I change is I usually use Marsala wine rather than sherry, just because that's what I usually have. Great recipe! Goes great with horseradish sauce by Carol46

Absolutely loved it.  I followed the advice of the other reviewers, and tripled the sauce-best gravy ever.  I also didn't have any minced onion, so just chopped up a whole one.  Next time, we're going to try adding apples!

Absolutely fantastic!! Made on the BGE, seared first then cooked indirect at 350 for about 30-45 mins, until  internal temp was 145.. Made as written except added green onions instead of onion powder and also subbed a glove of garlic.

Absolutely delicious.  I didn't want to grill (it's wintertime, you know?) so I pan-seared on all sides before placing a meat thermometer, popping it into the oven @ 350, and cooking until 160.  Wouldn't change a thing.  Whole family enjoyed.

Delicious!! As others suggested I doubled the marinade (only used one portion of cinnamon though) and used the leftover to make a sauce for dipping - good idea because it's so tasty on the pork!  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good.  Has a little sweetness to it, but it goes well with the pork.  I did what other reviewers did and cooked the marinade while the pork was cooking. (even added a little water) the added a tbsp of cornstarch slurry.  Delish!

Very good - I have made it as written and also have substituted apple juice for the sherry, either ways works great.  Good for pork tenderloin or chops.

Made the marinade exactly as written, but my husband and I did not like this at all. The cinnamon flavor really threw us off... I let it marinate overnight, so perhaps the cinnamon tasted stronger than for the other reviewers? I would be willing to make this again, sans cinnamon, as I think the base recipe was pretty solid.

Loved it!! I tripled the all the ingredients as recommended by many (except for the cinammon) so I could make a gravy.  Served with rice.  Will definitely use again.

Delicious! I will definitely make this again. The only thing I'll change is I'll cut the amount of cinnamon in half. It was just a little overpowering for us. Thanks for sharing.

My family didn't like this at all. The cooking time was way too long so I cut in half. But pork was pretty flavorless. Will not make again.

This is my favorite pork tenderloin recipe.  I have made it many times using the exact recipe with the exception I baked it in the oven instead of using a grill.  I baked it at 400F for about 30-35 min and it was perfect.  Line the pan with tin foil as it will make the clean up much easier. The sweetness in the marinade gives it such a great flavour.  I made it with a mushroom rice and asparagus / green beans with cherry tomatoes (both recipes I found on Allrecipes as well).  My guests loved it!

I loved the marinade, just wasn't too sure about the cinnamon.  I will try it again and leave that spice out to see if it makes a difference.  My pork was beautiful and juicy.  I made gravy out of the remaining marinade and followed other suggestions and used minced garlic and onion.  I added more sherry to my gravy, but there is still something missing.  Give it a try!

Made this as recipe stated. Wonderful. Cooked 35 minutes at 375 along with baked potatoes. Made pork fried rice with the leftovers and that turned out great.

I must have screwed it up.  Had a large tenderloin and should have butterflied it.  Marinade didn't penetrate the meat very well and it turned out rather flavourless and uneventful.  I had marinated it overnight so I  thought it would be enough time for the flavour to soak in.  Not sure if I will try it again.  If I do I will use the smaller pork tenderloin .

I was only able to marinate for 5 hours and cut the tenderloin in half to put in marinade. 
This recipe is so delicious. It is definitely a keeper. I started it on the grill at 500 degrees. This was way too hot. 400 degrees seemed best. It was a hit.

This has been a hit every time I cook it. I use a pork tenderloin and marinate it over night, then cook it in the oven (or my NuWave). Amazing.

Made it as is, added a little bbq sauce to finish it off after I barbecued the tenderloins. Boiled the marinade then simmered into a reduction to add on afterwards. Yum!

Just made this yesterday and it was outstanding!   I merely doubled the recipe given I had 4 tenderloins and marinated them for about 5 hours.   While in the bag, I also used a meat tenderizer tool to pound the "c$ap" out of the meat.   It came out BEYOND juicy and tender.   It was the best pork I have ever had and was more tender & juicy than filet mignon.   Highly recommend it!!!

Very tasty.  I marinared about 4 hours.  Next time maybe longer and I'll pierce the tenderloin to invite flavor inside!  I didn't have sherry on hand so I substituted with some white wine.   This recipe is a keeper.

Doubled the marinade, seared it, baked it at 350 to internal temp of 160. It was very tender and flavourful. The few leftovers we had went too quickly and my extremely picky husband loved it. Served with a side of simple mashed potatoes. I also boiled the leftover marinade and added mushrooms to it to add on top of it all.

This was very good
 I was a little surprised thinking the cinnamon was a little odd. I didn't have Sherry so I used a little Balsamic,  and I used fresh onion instead of dried. I'm not sure I grilled it for a full 20 minutes either, as I don't like dried out pork. it came out delicious, nice and tender and moist, and good flavor.

This is super easy and is delicious!! I have made this several times, but made it for a Mother's Day gathering this weekend and everyone raved about it. I would recommend marinating for 12 hours. The flavor is still great after 6, but is amazing after 12! I have cooked this in the oven on 400 for 40 minutes and I have also cooked it in the crockpot on low for 6-8 hours. I personally prefer the crockpot because of the flavor you get.

Very good marinade- added great flavor to the pork.  I did not change anything but doubled the recipe to have a sauce for the cooked meat.  I think the cinnamon is completely oprional- did not need.

We made this for dinner this evening.  I followed the recipe exactly except baked it in the over to 150 degrees and let it rest for 10 minutes.  It was amazing, flavorful and totally juicy.  Unfortunately, I had to leave it in the frige for 2 days and I think that made it just a little too sweet.  Will definately make again but probably won't marinate for more than 8 hours.

Fabulous!  I substituted Merlot for sherry and it came out great!  Wonderful sandwiches the next day!  The next time I will reduce the marinade on the stove to serve as a sauce with the pork.

After serving this to my daughter, she said it was the second best pork I've ever made.  (The first best is a copy-written recipe.)  I will definitely make this for company.

What's not to like about this recipe?!  We have a large family, so I marinated three 1 1/4-lb. pork tenderloins for about 5 hours.  I made shallow slices across of each tenderloin the entire length of the cut in order to allow the marinade to soak through the meat.  This also acts as a guide when cutting to serve the medallions.  I've never had such succulent, tender pork before!  It melted in our mouths!  Everyone loved it and requested we have it again soon.

I ended I letting this marinade overnight for more flavor.  I also covered the top of the roast with bacon then roasted it at 350 for  1 1/2 hours on a broiler pan that was partially filled with water. I served it with cilantro infused jasmine rice and grilled pineapple slices.  My son and absolutely loved it!

Awesome! Melts in your mouth. This may be the best pork loin I have ever made. I used marsala instead of sherry and used fresh onion instead of dried, but those are the only changes I made.  I will definitely make again.

Just made this tonight.  It was amazing.! No leftovers and even my grandson liked it.  Made it as written but didn't have sherry so used balsamic vinegar like one of the other raters mentioned.  Roasted in the oven and I boiled the marinade for several minutes then reduced it to a sauce .  Will definitely make this again.

I have been making this for several years now 2 differences are I use jack daniels instead of sherry and a dip also accompanies the pork...sour cream and chopped green onions which marinate for about 2-3 hours or overnight, a huge hit every time!

Tried this recipe last week and everyone loved it!  Like others suggested, I marinated it for less time, but it was fine - plenty of flavor.  Doubled the marinade ingredients except cinnamon, then reserved it to make a sauce, which was primo (except that I thickened it too much, but that was my mistake).  Served with some roasted veggies and rolls.  Will definitely make it again.

Delicious.  All 6 of us loved it.  We cooked down the sauce, it was sweet.  I like the meat better without the sauce.

I used coconut sugar and molasses to make this paleo and made the marinade into a sauce as others suggested. I thought it was a little sweet but my very picky kids and our guests gobbled it up.  I will definitely make this again but will reduce the sugar.

We will definitely make this again! I baked it instead of grilling since it is winter.  I baked it at 350 with bowl shaped foil in a 9x13 pan....had the marinade in while it was baking since I did not have time to marinade. Still turned out great!!! Also, the leftover marinade makes a great broth to boil carrots in as a side.

even though I've been cooking for about 25 years, this was my first time making a pork tenderloin, as that was my ex- husbands "thing". but they were on sale and I was looking for something different, so I tried it. I tripled the sauce (keeping the cinnamon the same per reviews) and marinated about 8 1/2 hrs, then put it in the oven on 375...though next time I think I'll bump it up to 400. I tented in foil and poured the juices into the marinade to make the sauce. oh, and I actually injected some of the marinade in 3 places on each of the two tenderloins and also basted with it a few times. I kept the recipe the same except for using fresh garlic and onions, but at the end I did tweak it as I was making the sauce...my 12 year old son was tasting as I stirred, and he suggested a drizzle of maple syrup! I did like it better that way actually though. all in all, I personally did not go wild for this recipe...I was kinda disappointed honestly. however, my pork hating husband had 2 plates, so for me that equals success! Lol. I made pineapple casserole II as suggested by another reviewer, and my husband went wild for it, though my youngest son thought it was too "pineapple-y", but that's another review! I think for my first pork tenderloin, it went over well, but I guess I'm weird because like I said, I wasn't crazy about the sauce. but if the fam likes it, and they did, that's all that matters to me! thanx for sharing!

This was very nice. I only added a sprinkle of cinnamon because it's not my favourite. I also cut the sugar in half. I marinated for 4 hours before roasting in the oven. I took the excess marinade and added water, apple juice and cornstarch and boiled it until thick and silky. I served with sweet slaw and my moms potato recipe. It made a very delicious supper.

Absolutely delicious! Modified to fit what I had, red wine instead of sherry, bone-in loin chops instead of the full tenderloin, and roasted in the oven at 350; at 10 degrees outside it's a little cold to break out the grill. The marinade was wonderful, I look forward to grilling season so I can try it that way. Cheers!

As my husband would say, this one goes in the rotation! Followed recipe exactly as written but used pressed garlic clove (one per loin) and fresh onion in place of garlic powder and dried minced onion. Cooked  in oven due to rain. 25 min per pound at 325.  Absolutely fabulous! The combination of flavorings are amazing. Cooked up extremely juicy and tender.

I've made this at least 5 times now and it is totally awesome!  Guests love it and ask for the recipe.  I double or triple the recipe,  barbecue the tenderloins and freeze one or two for later.  This marinade is exquisite and, as others have said, double or triple this as you will be coming back for more!  This is very good with mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus.

Excellent and easy-to-prepare marinade!  Because I was naughty and didn't plan ahead, I had to substitute a few ingredients.  My sherry went missing (I assure you that I did not drink it!), so I replaced it with a few teaspoons of Dijon mustard.  I also used sliced garlic cloves to use up my stock.  I also added some fresh sage from Thanksgiving that was still hanging on.  Also, I decided I wanted onions to serve with the pork loin, so I sliced 3 small yellow onions and baked the pork loin atop them.  The recipe created a lovely juice and tender meat.  Two of my dinner guests yesterday claimed that this was the best pork loin they ever tasted.  Thank you!

This was an amazing recipe. I made 4 tenderloins for a dinner party and every bit was gone!  I do recommend reducing the marinade to make a sauce like others did. It is so yummy drizzled on top of the sliced tenderloin.

My family loved this.  We like pork completely done - no pink, and I like cooking in foil to keep it moist.  Doing it this way means cooking at 375F for 45 minutes to 60 minutes.  Marinating is the key to the terrific flavor.

Made this with thin tenderloins and broiled them in the sauce ( ten minutes total, five minutes a side). I would use a little less cinnamon next time, it wasn't overpowering, just a little much for my taste. So yummy though!! Even got my picky five year old to eat it!

This was very good.  The only change I made was to use 3 cloves fresh minced garlic.  Marinated two tenderloins for just two hrs.   I preheated a large cast iron skillet in the oven at 450 then added the loins with marinade and turned half way through cooking then reduced heat to 400 till done.  35 min total cooking time.    Rest in pan uncovered for 15 min.

The rub used in this recipe is really good and the finished product is guest worthy.  Unfortunately, no one in my house likes sweet meat so the leftovers were never eaten.  I won't use this rub again only because the sweet flavor doesn't do it for us (NOT because the recipe is bad).

Wonderful.  Didn't have sherry so I used balsamic vinagrette as a substitute. Also couldn't grill so I put it in a pan in the oven at 400 for about 45 min.  So moist and delicious. I made the gravy others have suggested but it was so good without the gravy I didn't even bother to taste it. The gravy is just sitting in a pot on the stove.

I used 1/4 cup Sweet soy sauce instead of the soysauce and the brown sugar.  I will for sure make it again.  Sweet soysauce (ketchap manis) can be bought in Indonesian, Dutch, and some Korean stores.

Following the suggestions of other reviewers, I used fresh onions (about 2.5 teaspoons) instead of dried and one clove of fresh garlic, put through a press, instead of powdered. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and could not have been more pleased with the result. After marinating it for about 4 hours, my husband cooked it quickly on a very hot grill. Everyone loved it, including the wee toddlers and young children. I was afraid that this recipe would be too sweet or too "cinnamon-y" for our taste but it was not. I will definitely make this again and again! SOOO super-easy and delicious.

Great marinade. I didn't have any sherry, so I added a little plain brandy. I left out the cinnamon. Didn't hurt this recipe at all. Marinated it for about 3 hours (it could've stayed in longer) then threw the tenderloin on the grill. Awesome. Served with a fresh tomato (out of my garden)cucumber and onion salad, green beans and brown rice! Thanks for this one, will be using this simple recipe again!

Delicious! Didn't have any sherry so I used red wine vinegar instead. Baked in the oven at 400 degrees for 40 minutes as suggested in the comments.

I have made this sveral times and we really like it a lot.  Only 4 stars because I dialed back the cinnamon by about half to get the taste i wanted.  Also have done it in the oven and the grill.  While both were tasty, the grill version was outstanding.  Cold cuts out of the fridge next day were very good also.  I had good success freezing the raw pork after it had marinated in a ziploc.  Several weeks later, just thawed and fired up the grill.

Marinaded all day, and doubled the marinade, with only 1 teaspoon of cinnamon.  Very nice flavour in the meat, and as recommended by other reviewers, thickened the extra marinade with some corn starch and it was great with the meat.  I highly recommend this for pork, and will be trying this with chicken.

I marinated it all day. Used grill pan to grill the sides then put in 400 oven till it reacted 155.  But I tried to make a gravy with leftover sauce. Family did not like that. Made it too thick I think.

This was unbelievably so good and easy. The only changes I made was to double the ingredients except for the cinnamon and I used fresh onion and garlic. Reduce the marinade and basted the pork with marinade the last few minutes under broiler. Baked it wrapped in foil at 350* for 30-35 minutes. Let it stand a few minutes before slicing. All of these tips are a combination of other people's reviews, so thanks for everyone's helpful tips. My husband and I both loved it and will make it again. Want to try it on the grill next time. ~Mindless Cooking

This is a keeper! I was worried it would be too sweet and not sure about the cinnamon. Based on the great reviews, I decided to try it, but I only had one tenderloin. Following the directions other than that, it was delicious - not too sweet, and there was just the right amount of marinade. I heated my grill to high and then turned off one burner. I cooked the meat indirectly over that area, turning it every five minutes. After 25 minutes, it registered 145 degrees. I let it rest for 10 minutes with foil covering it. Perfect!

This was fantastic! Used a pork roast because it was on hand. Also, had no sherry so, I used red cooking wine. I was worried the roast might be tough but the soy and red wine tenderized the meat perfectly. I marinated it 30 hrs and grilled on medium for 20 minutes flipping every 5. Even my picky  wife enjoyed it!

Used this recipe twice now and love it. Turning the marinade into a sauce thickened with cornstarch was a great idea! Didn't have sherry so I used balsamic vinegar like suggested.

Prepared this for dinner tonight and it was a hit!  I substituted a teaspoon of onion powder because I didn't have dried onion, but it worked out just fine.  Instead of throwing out the used marinade I boiled it until it thickened, and we used it as a sauce (sort of resembled the consistency of caramel sauce).  I was sweet and sticky, and was good on the pork.  I was surprised by how much my hubs liked it. He said he'd like to have it again sometime.

This marinade is great!  I didn't have any sherry, so I used whatever red wine I had on hand.  I only had a 1lb tenderloin, so I cut the recipe in half, but next time I will make the whole recipe for one tenderloin so I have more left over for rice.  I also do not like onion, so I used garlic powder instead.  It was so good over rice.  I also cooked mine in the oven at 350 for 45 minutes.  I flipped it after 35 minutes and lowered to 325 for the last ten minutes.  It was perfect.  yum!  I can't wait to make again.

This recipe is a winner! I only had time to marinate the pork for 5 hrs. and it was superb! After marinating the tenderloins, I cut them into 1 1/2" medallions and made shish kabobs with pork/vegetables for the grill. I made extra marinade and held it out to baste the vegetables. My family loved it! Thanks for a great recipe.

I just made this and wow!!!!  This is absolutely fantastic!  I took everyone's advice and doubled the recipe but I also doubled the cinnamon.  I liked the flavor - although I might try it next time without doubling it to see which taste I prefer.  I seared the meat over the stove and then cooked it for about 30 minutes in a 375 degree oven until it reached 140 and then I removed it and tented with foil.  I boiled down the leftover marinade and added some corn starch but I think I added too much because the sauce was very thick and way too rich for me.  So I added about a 1/2 cup of water to it to tone down the flavor some and to thin the sauce a bit - not runny, but not sticky either.  Served with mashed potatoes and corn - this is a KEEPER!

Excellent, loved it. My husband and three sons all raved about how tasty it was. I took some others advice and boiled down the leftover marinade, then strained it and used it for an extra gravy. Made mashed potatoes with this and it was a nice compliment. Will be making this again for company. Easy and good.

I often use this marinade as written or as a base recipe for tenderloin, though I always bake it instead of grilling. I always lots of fresh onion and garlic too :) Thanks for a great recipe.

I thought the pork was fairly bland, even after marinating it over night. The sauce is what really brings the flavor, but I wouldn't say it was worth making again. I cooked it in the oven at 400 for 40 minutes and it might've been a little too long because it was a tad dry. I added a little bit of flour to thicken the sauce on the stovetop.

This was really easy to make, but it wasn't very flavorful (it marinated for about 8 hours). We did heat up the leftover marinate, but it was really thick(we added more water), and overpowering.

Awesome recipe- great flavor and so easy! I used a boneless pork roast and let it marinate for 24 hers, and it was wonderful. It will become a regular on our menu rotation.

Made this on a whim for dinner and was very pleased. I did not modify the ingredients, I made it exactly as stated and the flavour was wonderful. 
I baked it in the oven with all the marinade in the pan, added a thickener to the juices in the pan once it was cooked and poured it over my rice, yummy!

Amazing recipe!  Could not ask for more in terms of flavor.  I didn't have sherry, so I subbed red wine, and I roasted at 400 for 40 min as other reviewers suggested as we don't have a grill.  I can't wait to make this again!!!

Make this all the time and we love it, I do add a pinch of hot slap ya mama seasoning for a kick.  And I also cut the pork into medallions first, and when ready, grill it to about medium well,  so juicy..

my family loves pork tenderloin.  this was so easy.  followed recipe exactly; cooked on grill 25 - 30 min.  It had a nice crust on the outside and moist on the inside - great flavor.  Will definitely make again.

I followed the recipe exactly as written.  The pork was very tender but we just didn't like the flavor.  It was unusual.  The burgundy pork tenderloin recipe is way better than this one!  Won't be making this again.

I give it 5 stars only by using the marinade as a "gravy." I followed others' suggestions and boiled the marinade, then added a cornstarch/water mixture to thicken. Wonderful and excellent this way. I used port wine instead of sherry, which is a decent substitute, but would definitely stick to one of those two - it makes the flavor. I also doubled the marinade ingredients EXCEPT for the cinnamon, but you can't even taste it, so I believe doubling the cinnamon would be OK too.

Had this for dinner tonight and it was excellent.  I used fresh minced onion, seared on all sides on top of stove then baked in 450 deg oven for 25 min.  It was perfect.  Recipe is a keeper, thank you.

This was a "tastey" receipe! I forgot to marinate it over night and only had two hours of marinating. Still very good and tender! My kids gobbled it up and asked for more!! Will definately cook again - with the recommended overnight marinating!! :)

This was absolutely wonderful.  I seared on the stove then finished it in the oven.  The cinnamon is a must.  Don't leave it out!  Perfect with garlic rosemary mashed potatoes and steamed veggies.

This was really excellent, and easy to make. Moist and delicious. Followed recipe exactly with no changes. It is good with roasted red potatoes and carrots cooked in brown sugar and butter, the flavors go well together.

This was AWESOME!  
I doubled the recipe to use for a reduction later.  Since I didn't have sherry, I used balsamic vinegar and a fresh onion instead of dried.  I halved the amount of cinnamon.  Several reviewers were afraid of using the cinnamon but it was excellent.  Don't miss out on it next time, add it! 
I turned on my outdoor grill and let it heat up to 500 degrees. Added the pork, closed the lid and reduced the heat to about 300 and maintained that temp. It took about 25-30 minutes without opening the lid. I placed the tenderloin on a plastic cutting board and let it set for about 5-10 minutes.  Sliced it up and drizzled the marinade/reduction on it.  What a hit this tenderloin was!

This was awesome. Although I would suggest marinating for 24 hours not just the recommended 6-12. I also seared the outside first then lowered the temp on oven and let slow bake for a few hours. it literally fell apart just looking at it.

My husband and I both loved this recipe!  We loved the cinnamon flavor.  I did not have any sherry so I used cabernet sauvignon and it was great.  Will definitely be making this one over and over.

We really liked this alot! I used low sodium soy sauce so it wouldn't be so salty! I left it in the marinade a little longer due to our schedule. It was still great afterabout 16 hrs!

very good recipe, used sherry wine vinegar because that is what i had on hand, marinated 24 hours, baked in oven for 45 min @350, turned out great, hubby wants it on beef tenderloin next, which i think it would work on both.

We liked it.  I learned it needed to be on the top rack of the grill because the sugar will catch fire!  Hahaha... The fatty side was a little...heh-hum...chargrilled, shall we say?  My husband swore it added to the flavor!  :) I used the big meat fork to poke holes all over after it had marinated several hours

I used this marinade for country style pork ribs. Of course, I reducd ethe cooking time for the smaller pieces of meat.  Other than that, I made marinade as specified. The meat was FANTASTIC.  My husband, who pretends not to eat pork even liked it.  The marinade turned into a tasty glaze.  Next time I might add a couple of sprinkles of red pepper.

So yummy!  I cooked it in the slow cooker instead of marinating it.  turned the pork roast over once to let the top soak in the sauce.  Then after it was cooked I heated the leftover marinade into a glaze using a little corn starch.

We have made this a few times and absolutely love it! The only thing I do different is I use fresh minced garlic and onion. I also buy a large tenderloin and cut it into thick chops to grill. The pork comes our tasting amazing and very tender. Like other reviewers I also cook down the marinade and use as a sauce over the pork when it is done, it really adds to the chops. Great recipe. My whole family loves it, even my 2 year old!

Very good! I thought sauce (bec I did boil and thicken it as recommended by others) was a little too sweet. would cut down on the sugar.

This meal got rave reviews but needed some minor adjustments:  Marinate for 12 hrs. Double marinade, use fresh minced garlic and half an onion (chopped),a little pepper but no cinnamon. Sear sides of pork in olive oil before roasting (about 1 hr on 350/ 160 deg). Add McCormick's pork gravy packet to the left over marinade and add water until thickened.

You can make this with substitutions and it be fabulous. I have made 2 ways and each is delish! I didn't have olive oil, so used canola; didn't have sherry, so used rice wine vinegar once and balsamic once; forgot the garlic powder all together...oops; and I only used 2/3 of recommended brown sugar. I also thickened some of the marinade to a glaze consistency. Yum Yum! We grilled over charcoal.

I have to admit -- I made some changes, but boy-howdy it was amazing!! I didn't have sherry, I forgot cinnamon, but I added: normal mustard, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, chopped onion, red wine vinegar, and other seasonings along with what was called for in the recipe. I marinated from 9 am to 5 and then I went the pan=searing route with the 350 oven -- AMAZING! I highly recommend this way...though I am sure this recipe would have been great just as is. I had to improvise, and am happy with the results!

This was delicious!  I followed another user's suggestions and used 2 tbsp of fresh minced onion instead of the dried onio, and baked the tenderloin for 45 minutes on 400.  I covered the dish with foil for the first 30 minutes and then took the foil off for the last 15 minutes.    Served with asparagus and roasted potatoes (olive oil, salt, pepper, garlic powder & dried rosemary).

It was pretty good. Boiled the marinade to use as a sauce. Served it with a salad for a quick weekday meal. Thanks for the recipe. I will be making this again.

Excellent marinade! Husband loved it! The only change I made was I used real onions and added a little more than a pinch of garlic.  I think this would also be really good on chicken.  The soy sauce was not overpowering. Thanks for the recipe!

really good! the whole family loved it.  I added more than a pinch of garlic powder, maybe 3 pinches... I had planned on making it for dinner the same day I marinated it but didn't get to it until the next night.  I think I would suggest 24hrs to marinate because it turned out GREAT.

It was fine but I was surprised that this was rated so highly. It was too sweet. It charred up nicely on the grill and the meat  and spice was nice but it had a cloying sweetness not to our taste.

Great flavor. I make a gravy with the reserved marinade and it is to die for. Heat the sauce over medium heat for atleast 20 minutes to cook off anything that may have been left behind from the raw pork. Mix about 1/2 cup of water with a tablespoon or 2 of cornstarch and add to the sauce. Stir until thickened. OUTSTANDING and VERY sweet. Great for dinner guests.

This recipe has been added to my list of "keepers" for family weeknight dinners.  The flavor of the pork tenderloin is wonderful, and my husband, who doesn't usually like a tenderloin raves about it.

Delicious!  It was too cold out to grill when I made these, so I roasted them in the oven for about 90 minutes and they were tender and juicy.  I will definitely try this again when I can put them on the grill.

Love it Love it Love it!  I make a double recipe each time and save one tenderloin in a freezer bag for when I need to make a meal for a friend.  The smell when cooking is almost overpowering, but the final taste is superb and balanced.  I usually slice it, baste it, and put it back in the oven for about 10 extra minutes above recommended cooking time.

Excellent recipe.  Followed other reviewers recommendation of doubling the marinade and making a gravy from it.  Also only marinaded the pork for 3 hours and it still had lots of flavour.  I really like how I had all the ingridents in house and was able to make a really nice meal that you would get in a restauarnt.

Wow! This was excellent. I only made one tenderloin, but I made the same portion of marinade stated in the receipe. I did use fresh onion and garlic instead of the dried/powder. I grated a very small onion and minced 4 garlic cloves.

This was a really flavorful marinade. I've made it twice, once I marinated overnight and the other time only for an hour. Both were good, but longer is better. I didn't have sherry, so I used a little white wine. I'd love to try it with the sherry next time. And it makes a spectacular gravy too!

Way too sweet for us. We prefer a more savory dish than sweet. I used fresh onion and garlic. If I made this again, although I will probably look for a different pork recipe, I would adjust the brown sugar way down.

I thought this dish was wonderful!  I made a few changes:  I used a little less cinnamon, used lots of fresh chopped garlic and onion.  I butterflied it and cooked it in the oven for about an hour, and then for the last 15 minutes I cooked it on the grill.  YUM!!

This tenderloin was pretty good. I used fresh onion and garlic and omitted the cinnamon. I baked for about an hour at 350 covered with alum foil. After that hour it did not appear to be cooked, however after checking the temp it was in fact done. I would recommend to remove the alum foil and allow to brown on the top. I will make this again. Oh and I also used the juice to make some gravy. That was great.

Had this for dinner tonight!!! It was very good. I marinaded it for about 6 1/2 hours and although it wasn't that flavorful, once I added the gravy I made w/ the extra marinade it was AWESOME!! I doubled the batch for 2 tenderloins and wish I had tripled it because there wasn't that much gravy left over. My husband loved it and suggested that we try and make a stir fry w/ this sauce recipe someday!! I will make this again someday and try to marinade the meat longer and make extra sauce! Great recipe!

This recipe could have been a five-star - I definitely could see (and taste!) the potential. However, we tried grilling it over charcoal and ended up charring the outside to the point where we had to finish it in the oven. Perhaps we should have blotted off more of the marinade before grilling since it had such a high sugar content? Or used the gas grill where we could better control the temp? Will definitely try again, though.

Easy. Delicious. Kid-friendly.  Can't beat that in our household! I substituted about 1/2 t onion powder for the dried minced onion and my tenderloins were about 1 lb apiece.

Everyone loved it! So much better than pre-seasoned tenderloins and so easy. I also baked it at 350 for about an hour and i also made the marinade into a gravy. Will make many more times!

This was very good.  I would give it 5 stars but I did cut the cinnamon in half, otherwise I think it might have been overpowering.  I cut my tenderloin into small chunks so that I could grill it without drying it out too much before it was done.  My husband is pretty picky and he commented on how tender the meat was.  Thanks for a good one!

This was excellent.  Pork tenderloin is one of the staples in our house and this recipe fit the bill.  The only additions I made were to add fresh onion and garlic as some have suggested.  I also added some ground red pepper (cayenne) for a little heat.  1/4-1/2 teaspoon depending on what you like.  Very yummy!

I LOVE LOVE LOVE this!  there was not even one bite left!  A picky 9 yr old even loved it!  I was sceptical but I am glan I gave it a try!  I took some suggestions from others and boiled the remaining marinade and used it.  it is good with or with out the sauce!  I didn't have any sherry on hand so I used balsamic Vinegar it was sooooo good.  I very rarely give 5 stars...

We loved this recipe - excellent! Tender, great taste. It took about 55 minutes on the grill with a low temp.

This was just ok for us.  I have so many other pork tenderloin marinades that are  much preferred over this one.  We did enjoy it but will not make again.

I intended to marinate this 6 hours but plans changed and it marinated for about 16 hours!  I grilled inside on my Jenn-Aire and it was FANTASTIC!!!  I put the left over marinade in a saucepan, brought it to a boil then thickened w/a little cornstarch...this really MADE it!  Everyone raved at how tender it was.  This is a wonderful recipe and I've already added it to my recipe box.

Really spectacular recipe.  I doubled, cooked and used the marinade for a glaze.  Drizzled it on everything!  It even made the potatoes I served with it better.  This is a keeper!

This was a great simple recipe - I didn't grill it, but broiled the tenderloin before baking it.  The marinade was perfect

This is a delicious recipe.  I made the marinade the night before and ended up not cooking it for two days.  I substituded raspberry vinegar for the sherry. The taste was great.  I seared the pork first and then turned down the heat until it was done.  It only took 20 minutes to cook.

This is my "go to" recipe for cookouts and special dinners...EXCELLENT.  I have even eaten the leftovers cold!  It's just that good!  Highly recommend as other users suggested making extra marinade to use for a gravy afterwards.

Neither my husband or I loved this recipe. I marinated it for 12 hours.  It was baked in the oven b/c we dont have a grill.  Grill it and maybe it will turn out better!

This was just okay for me.  I, too, doubled the recipe and like other posters should have only put half the cinnamon as it was too sweet for me.  I also added about 2 tbsp. of vinegar as it smelled so overly sweet after I made it, but I don't think this affected the overall taste one way or another.  Probably won't make again as it wasn't my favorite, but just okay.

One of my favorite recipes!  So easy to make and so tasty, I eat the leftovers cold!  I usually don't keep sherry in the house so I substituted red wine.

Very yummy.  Cinnamon was a nice flavor addition to the pork. Kids didn't want to eat the hotdogs meant for them once they tasted this.  My son used leftovers for sandwich in his lunch.  Will make again.

We enjoyed the flavour of this one!  Made the recipe exactly as directed and marinated the pork tenderloins for a full day and then did them on the BBQ.  Juicy and tender and the cinnamon flavour made this unique and different, but definitely good!

ommitted the onion and used fresh minced garlic.  baked one and grilled the other. took a bit longer to grill than suggested.  overall very good flavor.  will make again.  tasted excellent the next day on a salad with blue cheese crumbles, mandarin oranges, red onion and balsamic vinegar dressing.  yum!  thanks!

I love this recipe for the pork tenderloin.   It is so good and our family favorite.  Wouldn't change a thing.       

I also use the marinade for deer steak, and leave it in  marinade for 1-2 days (longer is better) before grilling the deer steak quickly on a high temperature grill.

I also doubled the sauce, but evidently I am no good at "boiling down". Everything else was great. I just need to work on sauce making.  Family favorite.

It was very tasty and tender.  However, I thought it was a little too sweet, so will probably reduce the amount of brown sugar next time.  I doubled the recipe so as to have extra marinade for gravy.  Even my 10-year old daughter liked it and thought it was very good.

This was delicious.  Due to my procrastination I was only able to marinate for about 2 hours, but the flavor of the pork was fabulous.  I removed the tenderloin from the bag of marinade, discarded the marinade, and baked the pork.  I felt as though the marinade itself was quite sweet so I didn't want to make a sauce out of it, but the flavor it provided as a marinade was delectable. The boyfriend and I agree it is a keeper.

This recipe was great!  I made it exactly as noted, except I used 1/2 teas. of cinnamon.  My husband could not get enough of this pork.

I followed the recipe and this was delicious!  Great flavor and it reheated well the next day for lunch.  It retained the moisture and flavor.

Pretty good, but not the best pork tenderloin recipe I've ever had. Found the whole thing a little too syrupy for my taste.

excellent.  Always have amazing comments from my guests, and they want the recipe.  I have cooked this in the oven too but it's a better taste on the grill.  I've also heated the remaining marinade in a frying pan and it makes a good sauce serves ever the medallions.

Very good flavor.  I did love the marinade, and I made extra and thickened it with cornstarch and water, but the texture was really strange.  I'm not sure why.  But it tasted so good, I'll definitely be making this again.

Fantastic marinade!  I marinated my tendeloin overnight and was a bit worried the flavour might be overpowering but it was just right! The pork was very tender and had just the right amount of flavour! Will definately make again and again!

Just wonderful!  One of the few marinades I've made that you can actually TASTE.  Didn't have sherry so I used Jack Daniels and a splash of red cooking wine.  Only two of us for dinner, so I froze the other tenderloin in the marinade which we'll enjoy next week!

The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I didn't follow the recipe exactly.  I left out the cinnamon, and took the advice of another reviewer and made a sauce out of the marinade.  YUM!!  Very flavorful, sweet, tangy and sure to be featured again throughout the spring & summer!

I have been making this for several years, and it is my "go to" dish when I want a fail-proof entree for guests.   I make it  as the recipe states, although now that we are empty nesters I cook 1/2 pork tenderloin.  That leaves enough for fabulous sandwiches.  One other thing: I use a meat thermometer to judge doneness because overcooked pork is just the worst!

The best pork tenderloin i've ever had.  put a bit extra sherry & brown sugar just to sweeten it up some more.  otherwise, followed the receipe.  20 minutes is just right on bbq at med/high. suggest 5 minutes per each of 4 'sides' of tenderloin.  was nice with a pino grigio

This was a good marinade, it's pretty sweet, but very good. While it was baking my husband walked in the house and thought I was burning some cinnamon potpourri or a candle-I liked that part too. It's something I would make for Christmas brunch.

This recipe has a great flavor.  I would like to try it on chicken.  The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that every time I make it, it has a tendency to burn (I guess it is the sugar).

I made this tonight and my family loved it.  My husband liked it so much that everytime he took a bite he would give a little moan...hehe.  I poured the sauce over the meat after it was done cooking.   Next time I'll double the sauce so we have extra to dip the meat in.  It was really good.  Thanks for the recipes.

Absolutely delicious!  I used a half pork loin and let it marinate the full 12 hours.  I did substitute the red wine vinegar for the sherry.  The whole family enjoyed it!  We'll use this one again and again!

Very, very tasty. Cinnamon gives it a unique flavor. I sometimes marinade for a day or two but with this recipe 12 hrs. is the max. Will enjoy this recipe many times in the coming years.

I thought it was excellent.  My husband, on the other hand, didn't like the cinnamon taste.  Next time I will cook without the cinnamon and see how it comes out.  Also, for some reason mine burnt pretty bad on the smaller piece even though I followed the directions for grilling.  I think I will either wrap it in foil or cook on the top rack next time.  Oh, and others had suggested I used Red Wine Viniger instead of the sherry.  All in all it was pretty good!

This truly was as easy and as good as everyone said.  Make extra marinade to use as a sauce.  The leftovers were even better.

I did not have sherry on hand, so I used red wine vinegar. I also cooked it in my slow cooker on low for about 7 hours. It was very tasty to me, but my husband was not crazy about it. I will try again with cooking it on the grill.

This is the Best Pork tendrloin that I have ever had.  The flavor is unbeatable.  I followed the instruction on grilling unchanged and covered it with foil (as one reviewed suggested)to rest.  It was sooo juicy and tender.  I marinated the pork for a few days which  flavored the pork throughly.  D'lish!!

Thank you :o)

this is so easy and so good.  I did the marinating the day before and when I was ready to cook the next day, threw it on the grill.  Just be careful you don't dry out the pork and everything will be great.  excellent flavour

I made this recipe exactly as shown last night and didn't care for the sweet or cinnamon taste.  It just may be that our preference is for the more southwest flavors or roasted with herbs type recipes.

This was very tasty.  Instead of dried onion I used minced white onion (about 1 tbsp) and instead of garlic powder I used one minced garlic clove.  I also didn't have any sherry on hand so I used white wine instead.  It was very good.

Very easy, moist and flavorful.  We followed the recipe exactly and thought it was very good.  We did boil the marinade, but didn't like it as a sauce.  The meat was good enough without it!

Yummy!! I'm usually not a big pork fan, but I had to stop myself from eating more than I should.  The cinnamon adds that special touch that makes it different from any other pork marinade I've had.

I placed the marinated medallions in tin foil w/ ripe, pitted cherries and grilled. This recipe sounds time consuming, but it's really not. Guests will be impressed. Serve with Shiraz wine, and Chocolate covered pears or cherries for dessert. Great leftovers for Cuban sandwiches.

This was bad. Like Ashton Kutcher bad. The cinammon combined with the salty soy sauce, the acidic sherry and fruity olive oil yielded a unique, yet terrible, melding of flavors. And I even used less cinammon than recommended. Even with all the sugar in there, the pork wasn't sweet at all. Just a hint of maple behind the explosive (like a shrapnel bomb) flavor of cinammon and soy sauce. The char from grilling this doesn't so much complement the flavor of the marinade as much as it masks it (much to the appreciation of the diner). I have never been so embarassed to serve something at my table.

I was pleasantly surprised with this recipe.  The flavors worked well together.  I marinated it for as long as the recipe required, but due to some laziness on our part, and an unseasonably cold evening, we opted to cook this in a skillet on the stove. I seared the outside, then covered it and cooked on low.  The sugar ended up carmelizing, and it was FABULOUS!
So, next time we'll try the grilled way and see if we like it just as much.

WOW!   It was too cold outside, so I did this in the over (under broiler) but it was wonderful!  The flavor was rich and not too sweet.  Definitely will try this again!   Thanks!

Delish! Everytime I use this marinade, I get rave reviews.  However, when grilling, keep eye on meat - sugar content can cause "excess charring"!

We debated 3 vs. 4 stars and finally decided 4 because it was better than average.  I think it was the cinnamon that turned us off -- pretty overpowering.

My husband, who isn't usually a fan of pork tenderloin, loved this dish. I wasn't sure he'd go for the cinnamon, so I used a scant teaspoon of it, and the results were terrific. Even my three-year-old gobbled it up. It has great flavor without being too much. I will definitely make this again.

The cinnamon is the secret in this recipe.  Marinated the pork for 24 hours with excellent results.

This was EXCELLENT! We made it on a Wednesday and put the marinating pork in the freezer. WE left for a camping trip on Thursday morning and grilled the meat on Saturday. A huge hit! I had to triple the recipe because I had 4 lbs of pork to do, but it was perfect! 
Even the picky eaters cleaned their plates... great recipe; will certainly make it again!

This was a nice change of pace to the plain BBQ'd pork tenderloin we usually make.  I will try it again.

We all enjoyed this very much and it was easy to make, but there was one flavor I thought was a little overbearing and left a bad aftertaste.  The best I could figure, it was the dried minced onion.  They just seemed too strong.  I will cut those back to about 1/2 - 3/4 tsp. next time.  I marinated the tenderloin for about 18 hrs. and took a previous reviewer's recommendation of injecting some of the marinade in the meat.  I  used a gas grill, set on medium heat, and it took about 35 mins. for the pork to be done.  I boiled the marinade down and served with the meat, which it seemed like it needed for more flavor.

This marinate was great.  The light cinammon taste went well with the pork.  My 3 year old loved it too.

I have now made this recipe a few times and it is excellent!  Try not to overcook it, as it can be a little dry.  Also, due to the sugar content, it can turn a little dark when grilling it on the BBQ so don't leave it unattended.

Very good...nice flavor after marinating about 3 hours.  It will be even better next time when I have more time to marinate...but 3 hours was sufficient.

Great marinade!! Followed the recipe exactly and the cinnamon was ok and not overwhelming. Will probably double the recipe next time to have some extra for dipping. Maybe try it with chicken.

I found that it took a lot longer on our grill to get it to the right internal temperature, and the outside was a little crunchy; but inside it was still really juicy and tender!  Very good!

This  was very good, I've made it a couple of times and it's turned out well both times. The Cinnamon flavor is different but nice. It went over well with my whole family. I liked it better with pork tenderloin then with pork roast, the marinade didn't get into the roast as well as with the tenderloin.

my husband and i loved this recipe.  i would never have thought to combine these very different tasting ingredients, but it was delicious.
