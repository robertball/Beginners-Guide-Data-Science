We really enjoyed this dish but it felt like it needed more of the soy sauce/sugar mixtue.  We tossed it with a little hoisin and the flavor rounded out perfectly!

I love this recipe. Tasted very much like an authentic recipe I had served to me at a celebration (which I've heard is a traditional use for this dish). I didn't have sweet potato noodles on hand so I used plain glass noodles, which worked well. I recommend being careful to not overcook the noodles in water since they essentially get cooked twice. I also doubled the sauce mix and instead of spinach, and I used seaweed (similar to that used in seaweed salad) which gave some great flavor!
