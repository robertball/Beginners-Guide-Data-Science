I "cheated" and purchased pre-cut butternut squash cubes at Trader Joe's.  I cooked them for 5 minutes in a covered bowl in the microwave.  Then I mashed them with a fork , added the rest of the ingredients and ate. 

With this method, it is a quick, nutritious paleo compliant breakfast. I will be making this again.

I love butternut squash and never considered it for breakfast. I cooked mine in the microwave by cutting in half and placing cut side down in a glass dish covered with plastic; it took 15 minutes. I added a little raw sugar to sweeten. This was really tasty, especially with the crunchy walnuts. I'll try this again sometime. Thanks for a new idea for breakfast!

It was amazing! I would suggest cubing and microwaving rather than baking though. I baked mine for over an hour and it was still too hard. This recipe takes longer to prepare than a traditional breakfast, but it is worth the extra effort. It's creamy and full of texture and very satisfying. A nice change of pace for those on Whole30 or Paleo diets.

This was really good. I pan sauteed prepared squash noodles with the ingredients. Tasted great. Added a pinch of pumpkin spice and used cashews instead of walnuts.
