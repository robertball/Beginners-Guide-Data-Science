Wonderful!  My husband really wanted a sweet pork chop dish like the one he eats at a roadhouse around here.  The apples were so tender and succulent!  We ended up grilling the pork chops and doing the sauce and the apples separately.  I also doubled the brown sugar and butter to make more caramel sauce.  :)

Well.. I read this recipe and thought, "It sounds like plain pork chops with plain cooked apples on top." And that's nearly what it was like. I made it again and tweaked it quite a bit. I salted and peppered the pork chops before browning them, which boosted their flavor. I also wasn't crazy about the texture of the chops right against the apples with no buffer, so I ended up topping the chops with a quick bread stuffing (sweat 1/4 cup each minced onion and celery in 2/3 stick butter, add 1 torn loaf cuban bread, 1/2 tsp. thyme and rosemary, and 1 cup chicken stock), then topped the chops AND stuffing with apples and pecans. As written, I just wasn't crazy about the recipe (sorry!), but I would make it again with these tweaks.

I made it with less pork and only one apple (for two people), but the same amount of sauce.  Melt-in-your-mouth goodness.  Didn't have pecans on hand, but I bet the crunch would be the perfect touch.

An excellent and forgiving recipe. I accidentally added the pecans to the brown sugar and cooked all, but still it was delicious (if not as crunchy as it might have been otherwise). My husband liked this recipe - simply, it's comfort food. One note, I was only making dinner for two, but found we ate all the topping. Might double it for four.

Sorry for poor grades, but this recipe just didn't cut it. I mean, don't get me wrong, apples and pork are a match made in heaven, but this is more of a dessert, really! Drizzle with melted choc and you have instant winner with kids. Won't make again.

These were very good.  I tripled the sauce (but not the apples) with only 3 chops and barely had enough sauce.  At least triple the sauce if not quadruple.  But overall...delicious!

You could eat this by itself as a desert.  It is delicious.  I cooked it seperately from the pork chops and sprayed the apples with I Can't Believe It's Not Butter spray instead of using real butter.

Wow I REALLY wanted to like this but just didn't.  WAY too sweet.  Smelled great but my husband actually asked "are you cooking sugar?  smells like it."  The sauce would be GREAT on ice cream... not so much on pork from what we tasted.  Sorry I hate to give not so positive reviews. I'm sure a lot of my recipies need more sugar for some... but wow, this was SO sweet.

I took tips from other reviewers and doubled the "sauce" and I also used Granny Smith apples instead of red apples. I served this with a homemade bread and celery stuffing and sauteed garlic green beans. My two sons especially liked this recipe--eating their portions and asking for mine! They ended up dipping their stuffing in the extra sauce I made with the pork chops. I'll make this again.

This was awesome, seriously one of the best meals I've made in awhile. I was tempted to lick my plate clean, but I worried that my boyfriend may not find that very attractive :) I did make a few changes...my chops were very thick, so I browned them and removed from the pan. I then added the remaining ingredients(I omitted the pecans and quadrupled the sauce, stirred those together for a few, then added the chops back to the pan, making sure to cover w/ the apples/sauce. I simmered this covered for about 15 minutes, then removed the chops and apples. I thickened the sauce with 1/2T cornstarch mixed with a little water. These are rather sweet so I recommend serving with savory sides to balance things out. I served mine with Stove Top and brussels sprouts.

One of my favorite fall dinners.  It is even better that it is inexpensive and quick to put together.  It's a great weekday meal, or for company.  The flavors are rich and you look like you slaved in the kitchen for hours.  (Only you will know that you didn't have to!)

This was awesome! It reminds me of something my mom used to cook for me. Only changes is no pecans since I didnt have them. Plus I used the same pan for the apples that I used for the Pork. I wished it had more juice so next time I'll add some apple juice/cider.

DELICIOUS!!!  I have never cooked pork chops before so I cooked them longer then requested so they were nicely browned on each side.  I also used green granny smith apples which worked great.  The apples and the caramel sauce are good just on their own!  Like everyone else has said, definitely double the sauce. Or triple it and have some with dessert! ;)

These were soooooo good. I did quadruple the sauce with the same amount of apples. Even with that there was enough, not too much for our tastes: as written will probably just kind of glaze the meat. I used Gala apples which I had on hand, we liked it just fine. I will definitely make these again, thanks so much for sharing :)

Quite sweet, my son wasn't overly impressed but my husband has requested that I make this one again.   Agree that this is a comfort food item!  I'll be making this one again for special occasions.  Also, I doubled the butter and sugar and this did quite well for the three of us.

Pretty darn good. Nice change of pace from normal pork chops. I used one, small granny smith apple, 3 chops (that's what was in the package), and doubled the sauce. I forgot the pecans, they would have been nice, but I don't think it really mattered. It was good, comforting, and really, really easy to make.

I used the carmel apple part of the recipe to dress up a turkey meat loaf I made.  It was great!  I did make one change though; I used 1/8 tsp pumpkin pie spice along with the other spices...it just needed a little kick to it and that did it.  I will make this again.

My hubby took one bite and said "This is better than Cracker Barrel!" It was really easy, too.  I over estimated how long it would take and totally overcooked the apples.  But it was still good.  I only cooked 2 (big) chops and we,also, ate all the apples. It felt like fall! My only problem was when I removed the apples with my slotted spoon, there was hardly no sauce left to cook down. I drizzled it over my soft apples and never mentioned it to Hubby!

Very tasty recipe!  I've made this twice, and I think I'll add a bit more sauce the next time, so I can have some extra to drizzle over the rice I serve it with.  The second time I tried cooking the apples with the pork chops, hoping the pork chops will taste more like apple.  Don't do this please; the apples tasted like salty pork chops afterwards! :P  Overall, a great recipe minus the need for extra sauce.

These are so good. I doubled the recipe and then tripled the sauce and I'm glad I did cuz the family loved them and we had plenty of sauce to go around. I used a mix of apples from granny smith, macintosh and red delicious cuz I wanted to use up the apples I already had and it was great. Served it with white rice and it was delicious. The rice just soaked up all that yummy sauce. Definately a keeper.

Yummy! Easy!  This was the easiest, quickest dinner that I've made in quite a while.  I put the potatoes (for mashing) on the stove to boil and, in the meantime, made the rest of the meal.  It could be considered a little sweet but my 2year old loved it and ate her meat before anything else (which never happens with pork).  I'll be sharing this recipe with friends.  Thanks NPB!

I loved this recipe but I thought it would be to sweet so I added some homemade plum wine when it was reducing and I also added a homemade rub to the chops to spice it up some. I also added cloves and ginger as someone stated earlier to the mixture. I'm sure this would of been good without my changes but I do like things on the spicy side usually. This will be one of our go to recipes. Thanks for sharing

As a newly single dad to a 16 yo I am not a pro in the kitchen. Have been relying on allrecipes to help me had variety to our menu. Son would be happy with chicken nuggets and fries! Bought pork chops on sale, had apples so put in the search mode and came up with this recipe. It was simple an son ate seconds! Asked when we could have it again. Did not alter recipe. It was good! Thanks for the help!!!

This is my favorite pork chop recipe! I made a few small additions. I salt/peppered the chops before browning. I added one half chopped onion (large chunks) and sautéed them with the apples in butter before adding sugar mixture. Added 1/2-1 cup water to the sauté mixture to help apples cook faster and also provide more sauce without needing more butter. I added about 2 shots of honey whiskey to give a more adult (less sweet) flavor. When the apples were soft I added the sauté mix into the pan with the chops, added the pecans, and let simmer another 3-5 minutes (covered) so the flavor would soak into the meat. In hind sight, a handful of Craisins would have been delicious to add!!

Shoot.  Forgot the sugar.  I could immediately tell that "this was meant to be sweet".  Lol.  Still really good and very simple to prepare

Very yummy! Although I triple the caramel ingredients. We have made it many many times, it’s a favorite for the whole family.

I am not a meat eater; however, I love to cook and when I saw this recipe I knew I had to test this one out!  My family loves their pork chops and I thought this would be a cool twist for them. As noted from other users, I doubled up the amount of brown sugar sauce and they just LOVED this! 
I sautéed the pork chops initially with Garlic and Onions and let them brown.  I then emptied the pan and placed the chops in the oven at 275 and kept warm while I prepared the brown sugar sauce and apples.  after that I let them simmer together sprinkling with sea salt and cracked pepper.  
this gave me enough time to prepare the sides of fresh string beans and quinoa.  
It was a huge hit!  will make again!

It was ok, no more then that. Yes the kids ate it with no fuss since it did have a sweet side to it, but the pork needed more seasoning. It was plain old chops with cinnamon apples. lots of room for improvement.
