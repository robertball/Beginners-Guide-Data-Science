Maybe the frosting tastes good with coconuts on it but not on its own. The consistency was more like a mushy heavy custard than the light frosting I was looking for.

This was very tasty. However I used Cool Whip instead of heavy whipping cream. This made the recipe easier. I frosted a coconut pound cake rather than a layer cake. It received raved reviews at a covered dish party.
