I had four cups of fresh cherries which needed to be used on this 95 degree summer day.  This no-bake recipe was perfect for keeping the kitchen cool and really tasty in addition.  My husband really liked it.

This is very close to what my husbands grandmother used to make 50+ years ago.  The recipe was lost(by me) several years ago.  I would use less sugar(3/4c) and mix the cornstarch into the lemon juice so it doesn't lump when added to the cherry mixture.  The original recipe called for a whipped cream topping.  Will use again for family get togethers.

Super great taste, so the 4 sars are only because of my own fault...this is the first cherry pie I've tried making, and, well, I should not have tried to improvise.  Here's what NOT to do: don't use a graham cracker crust, it absorbed all of the gelatin mixture and became mushy. And speaking of the gelatin mixture--don't use regular jello; I guess plain gelatin sets up differently, huh? And/or, I didn't let this cool enough before pouring it over the cherries in the shell. Any-who, it still came out tasting great, and I'm going to have to make this again (following the recipe EXACTLY!), so that I can update my rating to a 5-star. At least it was only an "experiment" on my family, and not for guests :-)

OMG, what a great pie!! It was SO delish. I brought some pieces into work and everyone raved about it!! And it was fairly simple to make. I didn't use as much sugar as the recipe called for so as not to overpower the flavor and taste of the tart cherries. My son and I picked the cherries and I made two pies, using two different recipes: one with regular crust and one with this crust. This crust did not become soggy even after a couple of days.

Love this recipe! Everyone that has it loves how tart it is. Instead of the wafer crust I use a pie crust. Yum!

This was a very nice, refreshing change from the usual double crust, warm cherry pie. The wafer crust really hits the spot and the pie overall looks lovely. Thanks!

I didn't have true gelatin so used a portion of cherry jello, the consistency therefore was a bit runny but didn't affect the flavor at all it was AMAZINGLY AWESOME! We had guests over, one friend said it was probably the best cherry pie he had EVER had...being 50 years old that is a high compliment for this wonderful cherry pie recipe!! 5 stars, I'd make it again and again going to try it with blueberries next! Thank you!

This was easy to make, and it turned out really good! I only used 3/4 C of sugar, and we didn't miss the missing 1/4 C!

Yummy and easy except for pitting the cherries. I reduced the sugar by 25% and it was still plenty sweet.
