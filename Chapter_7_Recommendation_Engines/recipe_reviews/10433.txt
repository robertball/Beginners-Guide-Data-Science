I love this recipe!  I have made them often, and have found a few tricks for them.  First, the quick relese tinfoil works well with this recipe.  Sticking is no longer a issue at all.  After they look done I turn the oven off and leave the brownies in the oven as it cools.  This helps with the gooeyness.  I also vary the chips I use.  Choc.,white choc., butterscatch, candy bar bits...They all work well in this recipe.  I also like to cut the recipe in half and put it in a samller pan(8*8) for a shorter cook time(start to check after about 15 min.).  Since it's hard not to eat them all gone right away, this helps me, since there is not as much to eat!  Give it a try, they are SOOOOOO good!

I have been trying to duplicate a Blondies recipe that I used to make when I was a kid.  This recipe comes closest.  With 3 changes I think I finally found it.  I reduced the flour from 2 2/3 cup to 2 1/2 cup, added a tsp of vanilla and baked it in a 9 x 13 pan, increasing the cooking time by about 5 minutes.  The blondies are moist, chewy and wonderful.  Thanks for the jumping off point.

What a yummy recipe! I followed the advice of several of the other reviewers and made the following changes: I reduced the flout to 2 1/2 cups, added 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and baked it in a 9x13 pan for 40 minutes. The batter was sticky (which the kids liked!), but the blondies baked up nice and fluffy. This is an incredibly easy, EXTREMELY delicious recipe. Thanks so much!

These were very good, but more of a cake than a bar. If you want absolute killer blondies, try Blonde Brownies I on this site.

I was looking for a truly "blonde" brownie recipe, so I omitted the chocolate chips. 
It also didn't appear to make enough batter for a 15x10 pan, so I made mine in 
a 13x9 and baked them for 25 minutes.  I did also add 2 tsp of vanilla.  The 
brownies are delicious!!

I'm not sure what others were talking about, when they say the recipe came out dry.  My guess is that they overmixed after adding flour.  My batch came out wonderfully.  I did jazz it up just a bit though... I added about 3 TBS of good quality instant coffee powder 2 TBS heavy cream, and used milk chocolate chips.  I baked it in a 9x13 pan for about 35 minutes.  They turned out moist, chewy, and really flavorful!  Good job, GREAT recipe!

These are the best brownies I have ever made. I did what the others did, adding a teaspoon vanilla and cutting down on the flour to 2 1/2 cups, cooking for 35 minutes in a 9x13 pan. I also omitted the walnuts and they came out PERFECT!

When I ws kid blonde brownies were my favorite dessert but I hadn't had any in years until I found this recipe.  When I made them I felt like that kid again.  My kids loved them and my husband (who usually hates brownies) loved them and asked for more.  I have since made them several times for my family and for friends.  Thanks for the recipe!

THANK YOU ROSINA!!! These brownies are simply great! Even just the batter was scrumptious! I was out of brown sugar so I substituted with 1 and 3/4 cups white sugar plus 1/4 cup molasses. I also added 2 teaspoons of butter-vanilla flavoring, and that just made it even better! I left out the chocolate chips and nuts for 100% pure brownie pleasure. Excellent served warm with an ice-cold glass of milk!!! WARNING: Don't make these when you're on a diet!!!

I took the advice of changing the flour to 1 1/2C, but it should have been 2 cups or more.  They came out incredible greasy and flat, and way too sweet....NOT a good recipe at all....a bronie whould be moist and chewy and much thicker, not flat and greasy!

These were great!  I doubled the recipe and baked them in 2--9" X 13" pans and 1--8" square pan.  They were perfect in 30 minutes.  I thought they would last a while, but they were gobbled up in less than 2 days.  They taste better the next day!

I will definately make them again.  The only thing I would change is the amount of brown sugar because they were very sweet.  A little vanilla wouldn't hurt either.

Make this recipe with these changes and you're sure to love them!

Delicious blondies, great texture.  I followed suggestions using 2 1/2 c. flour because in all the other blondie recipes I've tried, the flour & brown sugar are in equal amounts.  Forgot to add the vanilla extract as suggested (I intended to) but they still turned out great.  Note: The batter is very sticky and seems like it might not cover the pan and still be thick enough.. but it rises quite a bit (it uses a lot of baking powder).   I spread mine in a 9x13 cake pan and it rose to the top like a cake would.  Also it says to let it cool before cutting, but we couldn't wait and it cut beautifully.. the knife didn't tear up the surface and leave it all crumbly and messy, and each square held its shape well.

I made a couple of changes to bring this recipe closer to another I have for chocolate brownies that is very successful.  I omitted the baking powder and increased the eggs to 5.  I also decreased the flour to 2 1/2 cups.  I added 1 tspn vanilla extract, 1 cup walnuts and 1 cup white chocolate chips.  They were a big hit.  Another keeper.  Thanks!

These were amazing!  A huge hit a work.  Made recipe as is with no alterations - well I used both dark chocolate and milk chocolate chips.  Will probably try adding vanilla and the version in a 13x9 for something different.

I made this and it was a hit at my job potluck.  I didn't change any ingredients.  It was hard to spread in the pan, so I put it in the oven for about 5 mins and then it was easy to spread, and came out perfect!

These are perfect.  I've been using this recipe for years.  Most recently for something different I baked the batter(minus the chocolate chips and nuts) in a mini muffin tin.  Once out of the oven, I put two holes in the top of each blonde with the handle of a wooden spoon.  Then I filled the holes with ganache after they had cooled.

These came out super dense and insanely sweet, although it could have been our fault for assembling wrong.  It used an entire box of brown sugar!

Excellent!!  I just made them and they are delicious warm from oven!!  I followed some of the hints others suggested- 2 1/2 cups flour, 1 tsp vanilla, only 2 cups brown sugar. I also baked them in 9x13 cake pan.  The walnuts and chocolate chips are what make it a great blonde brownie!! Yummy in my tummy!

Too sweet for me.  More like candy then blondies.  However, if you like buttery, gooey blondies, these are for you!  Would make a few adjustments next time - let's see!

I rated this a four because it was an easy recipe and the batter tasted like the blondies were going to be fabolous. However I don't know if it's just me but they turned out more like a dry cake than blondies. I will say this is only my second time trying to make a brownie or blondie and both times they turned out like a cake. I cut the flour down to 2 1/2 cups like the reviews said and I added vanilla extract, but other than that I followed this recipe to the T. If anyone can help and tell me what I might be doing wrong I will highly appreciate it. I will try these again!

Ooooooo, these are one of my new favorites.  Following others' recommendations, I added 1 tsp. vanilla, reduced the flour to 2 and 1/2 cups, and baked in a 9x13" pan.  I added some chocolate and white chocolate chips, and once a few butterscotch chips (skipped all nuts), and voila! An absolutely addictive dessert.

So delicious!  They didn't even last 24 hours! I will definitely make these again. I read the reviews and reduced the flour to 2 1/2 cups; perfect! :)

I think there is just way too much brown sugar because they taste like burnt caramel. I will not be using this recipe again.

Yummy! I made these for a church bake sale and ended up having to make 2 more pans because my family kept eating them! I used half peanutbutter chips and half chocolate chips.

I followed the recipe to the "T", and was disappointed with the outcome. Very cake like, not a lot of flavor. Vanilla would help. I would sub butterscotch for the chocolate chips. To many other recipes out there to make this one again.

These were not what I expected.  The flavor was good but the texture was very dry.  I reduced the flour as suggested in other reviews and baked in a 9 x 13" pan and reduced the cook time.  They were still very dry.  More like a cake than a chewy blondie.

These were very moist and very delicious too. It's kind of hard to rate these though as I ran out of brown sugar and used a white sugar/molasses substitute for 2 cups of the sugar, so I am sure that changed mine a little from the original. What I ended up with was huge pan full of moist chewy thick blondies that were good. Even though I had let the butter/sugar mix cool, it wasn't long enough and when I added the choc chips they started to melt. The dough felt lukewarm at most, but it was still wearm enough to start the chips melting...so now that you know you won't make the same mistake I did. I wouldn't recommend doing the sugar sub as I did though unless you like molasses as the taste does come through in the end product, at least mine did. Maybe it's just because I was conscious of it? Good blonde brownies regardless of what I did to them. I did leave the nuts out. Thanks, I'm sure I'll use this again as it made a huge pan full and they were tasty too.

A little on the sweet side (for me), but moist and brownie like.  I added peanut butter chips and chocolate.  When I do it again I think I will do a little less brown sugar and more peanut butter chips.They gobbled them up at work

Some years ago either Betty Crocker or Duncan Hines had came out with a box blondie recipe and then it was discontinued. I have been looking for a chewy sweet blondie recipe ever since. I had followed a recipe for blondies once before and I guess it was from the WWII period and it seemed like I was cooking in rations. Then I tried a recipe similar to this one and it just turned out horrible in my opinion. It was way too cakey and bland! I would recommend this to anyone who doesn't like chewey gooey brownies.

Very sweet and rich -- a great thing if you like it like that.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I didn't use nuts and used about 1 3/4c chocolate chips.  Next time I might try adding a little vanilla, but the recipe works great without it.

These brownies are awesome!  I made them with 1/2 cup butterscotch chips and 1/2 cup white chocolate chips instead of the semi-sweet chocolate chips.

I followed the recipe exactly and I guess these weren't what I expected they would be.  First of all, they are too sweet.  Second, the flavor is dull.  If I were to make these again, I would cut back on the sugar and add a little more salt to bring out the flavor.  I would also add that I didn't care for the chewy texture.  Sorry!

My boyfriend made these for me instead of a cake for my birthday and we both liked them a lot. We used a 9x13 pan and I believe that a 15x11 would have been a bit better. We had to bake these for 30 minutes to get the center done but the rest of the brownie got a wee bit hard. The flavor was excellent though. We added a little vanilla to the dough.

Wonderful! Chewy texture and great flavor. I used 3/4 cup chocolate chips and 3/4 cup butterscotch chips. I highly recommend using the 15 x 10 pan. The texture is just perfect in this size pan.

I love blondie brownies, but I am sorry to say I was very disappointed in this recipe. They were bland and way too gooey in the middle. They really need some vanilla extract and maybe a quarter cup of white sugar.

I followed the previous reviewer and make 3 changes, also- only 2 1/2 cups of the flour, 1 tsp. of vanilla, and Reynolds Wrap Release to line the 9 by 12 pan for 35 minutes-this would now earn it a 10!!!

This recipe is good. Like others I added vanilla, extra chocolate chips and some honey (I was a 1/2 cup short on the brown sugar). I also used combination of all-purpose and a whole grain flours with no noticable change in texture. The only tricky spot was making sure the butter and sugar mixture was completely cool. I thought it was and well... not so much... all my chocolate chips melted! (Up the cool down time!) Luckily, it turned out to be a happy accident because they taste like a chocolately chess pie... Yummy delicious!

These fell after I took them out of the oven. Had a caramel taste that I didn't really prefer. Didn't taste like blondies to me. It's like they are missing something. Definalty wait to have them till at least a few hours after cooking as they fall apart and are extremely gooey. The sides were very chewy, almost hard. I cut them off before serving. I think I will try the other recipe for blondies and see if I get a better tasting blondie.

Ok I took this ground recipe cuz I liked it the best out of all of them, then I tried my own touch.  Upped the butter to a full cup and cut the flour way down, only about 1.5 cups.  I baked it in a 9x9, and also lined with parchment paper - my chips sank so I got a choco "crust" on the bottom.  The added butter and less flour gave a dense, chewy blondie that many people may have been looking for.  Baked at 180 C for about 35 min.  I put out a plate of brownies and blondies, although it was inconclusive if gentlemen really do prefer blondes :)

Great recipe!  I did take the advice of others and cut back the brown sugar to 2 1/4 c. and added a teaspoon of vanilla and a little extra salt.  I also only put in about 3/4 cup mini chocolate chips.  Makes a BIG batch.  Great for a potluck.  Will make again.

This recipe was very good over-all.  I tweaked it a little bit by adding vanilla and butterscotch chips, and a little less brown sugar. My 9 year old daughter entered it into a brownie bake off and won!  It did come out a bit hard around the edges, but I just cut those off.  The flavor was fabulous!

They tasted great but I baked them a little too long so they got hard.  I used butterscotch chips this time.  I think I will used white chips next time and see which one I like best.

Chewy and yummy! I made these with a 9x13 pan and it came out fine. The batter is more like sticky dough to me... it was a pain in the butt to spread but the flavor was great so it was worth it! Thanks so much Rosina!

Loved them!!  Can't miss with these.  I baked at 25 minutes, and they seemed a bit under done, but great the next day--nice and gooey!

I thought this was a great recipe.  I substituted m&m's for the nuts and chocolate chips.  Also I didn't have a 15 x 10 inch pan, so I just used a 11x17 inch cake pan and they came out soft with a chewy texture.  My husband who doesn't like blonde brownies loved these.

These were scrumptious!!  I substituted butterscotch chips for the chocolate chips just because I wasn't feeling "chocolatey" and the taste was great!  The only problem was that mine weren't completely cooked in the middle, but I think that was my fault - I tend to underbake brownies because I'm afraid of burning them.  However the next day they were just fine!  I'll definitely be using this recipe again and again - thank you for sharing!

I should’ve added vanilla! They were really bland, but this is my fault for not checking more reviews before hand. I did substitute walnuts for white chocolate chips. Will try again adding a tablespoon of vanilla or so...

Not exactly like the blondies I remember from childhood, but darn good nonetheless.  I did as others suggested:  reduced flour to 2 1/2 cups, added tsp vanilla, and I subbed PB chips for chocolate just cuz I wanted to today.  They came out great, and I’ll be making them again.

My changes: 1. line the pan with parchment. 2. cream butter & sugar (took awhile to get all the sugar worked in; you can tell by the color getting a bit lighter) 3. use dark brown sugar (stronger molasses flavor) 4. omitted nuts & choc. chips.  My 8 year old took these to county 4-H fair & got a blue ribbon, so you know they are good!    

If you've had problems with it being dry, you might benefit viewing https://www.allrecipes.com/video/639/how-to-measure-flour/  or another clip about measuring flour...

I did not have any walnuts so I substituted one cup of butterscotch chips.  They are very sweet so just a little piece does the job.

I made these following the suggestion by many to use 2 1/2 c flour and some vanilla.  I also added choc chips, pecans, and coconut to the top before baking and they disappeared within hours.  I ended up with a nice heavy, fudgy blondie; not cake-like at all.  I'm making them again tonight!

Not the consistency I was hoping for. I wanted a moist, chewy blondie. This one turned out to be like a cake cookie. Maybe I did something wrong, but I'll keep searching for another blondie recipe.

They were a huge hit. A bit bland looking (sprinkled powerderd sugar on top)  but very chewy and yummy.I will next time drizzle melted chocolate on top to enhance appeal.

These brownies are super gooey. It's almost like it is half-baked (and I even left the pan in for longer thinking that would help).  I guess I was expecting more of a brownie texture. I should have realized by the picture though (they are not thick and cake-like in the picture either). I was turned off by the goo so I never even tried them. My husband liked them a lot -- he loves undercooked cookies and gooey stuff).

These were so good. I took the advice of another viewer and cut the flour to 2 1/2 cups and added 1 tsp. vanilla. I also topped them with the Fluffy Peanut Butter Frosting off of this site. I didn't have the chocolate or walnuts to put in it either, but they were still great. Will definitely make these again. Thanks.

These were not what I was expecting. I expected a gooey, chewy brownie and instead got a dry bar that crumbled.  The only changes I made were I took them out of the oven 5 minutes early and I omitted the walnuts.
The taste was *okay*, I guess, but the texture was dry and crumbly.

i am a stickler for measurements and exactitude and this was not a brownie. But to be really honest, my husband thought they were great cookies and HIS dad thought that they were biscotti's, and he loves biscotti! it was like a cookie batter only stickier. i didnt go with the nuts but added the chips. my batter was still a bit warm so they gave a nice marbled effect. BUT STILL THEY WERENT BROWNIES AND for the life of me i dont know what went wrong. i did use more butter and less brown brown sugar. 2 tbsp exta butter and only 2 cups sugar, like some one suggested but no cigar! suggestions welcome.

I swear I followed the recipe exactly and they just turned out too cakey and with kind of a yucky aftertaste. I definately should have put in some vanilla. I'm not sure what I did wrong here but I won't be making these again.

This are my all time favourite blondies!  I was looking for a recipe and settled on this recipe because its so easy, yet they are delicious.  I've actually used this recipe to make an icecream cake (in 2x8in pans) and it turned out fantastic!  I took the recommendation in the reviews to use a 9x13 pan and that works well.  I also add 2teaspoons vanilla extract.  Thank you, Rosina!

The blondies are delicious!  They were rich and perfect.  It took a little longer than anticipated, but overall an A+!

I did not like these - they were way too sweet and bland and really not what I was looking for.

These blonies are great!  My husband is a picky eater (especially when it comes to sweets) and he loves them.  Thanks for a great recipe!

These were REALLY sweet and gooey. I added them to my '01 Christmas cookie giveaways and would gladly do that again...they're a little too sweet to have on hand for just the family but make a terrific gift.

These came out very delicious! But as a beginner I have to say that it took a little longer than I anticipated...

These were the greatest.  I added a few more 1/2 cup chocolate chips to the top.  Really good and easy.

Loved this recipe. I added 1 teas vanilla and did not add the choc. chip to the batter.  Instead I put them on top after they cooked and spread the melted choc. over the bars.  My family gobbled them up and ask for more.  A keeper for sure

Made these about a month ago and my husband has been requesting them again and again.  We love them with ice cream on top!  I am making them tonite for a luncheon tomorrow.  Hope there are some leftovers!

Such a rich brownie!  My kids really enjoyed making these with me.  When they were done, we served them with ice cream, chocolate sauce and whipped cream for a Blonde Brownie Sundae!
