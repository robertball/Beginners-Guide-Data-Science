I wanted to comment on this recipe and some tips to make it authentic and give it that restaurant touch.  The recipe itself is fairly good .  The only thing I would add to make it a bit more authentic are as follows:

1/4 cup of finely ground cashews (unsalted).  These should be used as a thickner and not corn starch.  Indian recipes or sauces never use corn starch.  For richer gravies we use ground almond or cashews and heavy cream or yogurt.  
1/4 cup of heavy cream (substitute it in place of half and half)
Finally if you are a true Indian curry lover and love Chicken Makhani you should buy some fenugreek(called methi - pronounced "Mei" "thi") seeds.  
You only use 1/4 tsp of these (they are very bitter) and grind them.  Then add them to the curry when you add your other dry spices.  
The cashew and fenugreek is what gives Chicken makhani it's authentic flavor.

I am an Indian native looking for an Americanized version of this dish for a friend who is  a little intimidated by Indian food.  I gave this recipe a try, and it is almost there.  First, I used fresh minced ginger and garlic, but had to triple the amount. That made a huge difference.  I noticed that many reviewers said the recipe is missing something.  I think that something is coriander.  Most Makhani dishes have a cumin/coriander combination which is missing from this recipe.  I added a little ground coriander and the dish was great.  Perfect for a new Indian cook.

This dish is SO good, my hubby requests it often. Even though I modified the recipe to make it healthier, I still gave 5 stars because the original tastes good too.  My changes: I followed others' advice and added ground cashews instead of cornstarch.  The nuts make ALL the difference.  To make it healthier, I used smartbalance light spread instead of butter. *HUGE TIME SAVER: Instead of cooking the sauce first and then the chicken, have them both going at the same time.  By the time the sauce is finished, the chicken is browned and ready to be combined with the sauce. ** UPDATE** I substituted fat free buttermilk for the half&half, yogurt, and lemon (cuts way down on the fat and ingredients).  While the sauce was simmering, I ground the cashews in a blender and then added the sauce (minus the bay leaf) to the blender to puree all the onion pieces and cashews into a smooth and creamy sauce.  Otherwise, you'll end up with small bits of onion and nuts - not bad, but better smooth.  I then poured the sauce onto the chicken and simmered with the bay leaf until cooked.  Other lower fat options for half&half are light cream and nonfat evaporated milk, but I liked the nonfat buttermilk the best because it did not separate when heated.

This was absolutely delicious! My Pakistani in-laws are quite picky when it comes to traditional food, but this one is a new favorite! I made the following adjustments: Added 1 tbsp butter to the peanut oil, used 4 tbsp butter rather than 2, substituted 1/2 tsp ground ginger powder & 3 cloves crushed garlic for ginger/garlic paste, omitted salt & pepper, added breast meat pieces, substituted whole milk for half & half, used 1 full tsp cayenne pepper for chicken, doubled cornstarch (but not water) to thicken sauce, and garnished with fresh, chopped corriander. The 5-minute prep time is unreasonable. It took me about 30 minutes to prep and 1 hour to cook (including 20 mins of simmering to let sauce thicken and white rice, which is best served with this dish). Also, this only served 3 adults in my family, so I highly recommend doubling it!

This is an excellent recipe, however, the first time we tried it, we decided the chicken needed to be marinated first.  The sauce was good, but the chicken (we used chicken breast) was a bit chewy.  I use the marinade in the other Butter Chicken recipe by Vijar Bhaardwaj (15 minutes in the lemon juice, chili powder and salt and 3-4 hrs in the drained yogurt and spices marinade).  The result is phenomenal!  

In place of the full-fat half and half, I use Land of Lakes Non-fat Half and Half.  It does not affect the taste.  I've also used stewed tomatoes in place of the tomato puree.  

A good side dish is Gobi Aloo (Indian-stype Cauliflower with Potatoes) by Shahzadi, also found on this website.  Note:  Use chopped tomato and coconut milk to make this recipe less dry.

I served both at a dinner party for 14 and they were a hit, with many requests for the recipes.

Tastes just like the dish I love at our favorite Indian restaurant. I make it low carb by using 1/2 cup tomato paste in place of the tomato puree so it thickens without the cornstarch. I also eliminate the water. I add thinly sliced almonds or chopped pistachios also.

Wow! Finally a delicious Indian dish that doesn't take overnight marinating and tons of obscure ingredients.  I didn't have any fresh ginger, so I used half crushed garlic and a pinch of ground ginger and this was dynamite!  Have all the prep work done (chopping measuring, etc) before you heat the oil and you will be able to finish this dish in no time.  My hubbie even loved it and he is not big on Indian food.  This is definitely a keeper!

Took a lot longer than the stated 5 minutes, but definitely worth it.  Instead of the ginger-garlic paste I used 4 mammoth-sized garlic cloves and almost a Tbsp of ground ginger.  I used cream instead of half and half, and didn't have to put in any cornstarch as a result.  Delicious!

Love this recipe. It has changed quite a bit since 2004, thanks to my SIL who's from Surat: In in a bowl, grate 1/2" piece of fresh ginger and two cloves of garlic, add 1/4 ts salt, 1/4 ts dried fenugreek leaves [crushed], pinch of pepper and 1lb chicken pieces. Mix and set aside to marinate while you prepare/measure other ingredients.  
Heat 2 tb of EVO in a large skillet, add the marinated chicken, cook half way through, [some pieces may be golden brown]- remove to a plate and reserve. 
Melt 2-3 tablespoons of butter in same skillet, stir in 1/2 onion roughly chopped, 1/2 jalapeno [seeded], 1/2" fresh ginger and a pinch of salt; once onions have softened, add 2 ts chopped garlic, 1 bay leaf, 1 ts dry fenugreek leaves, 1 ts cumin powder, 1ts coriander powder, 1 ts garam masala, 1/4-1/2 ts cayenne pepper and a pinch of ground cardamom, after 30 seconds, add 2 C of crushed tomatoes [she uses Hunt's Natural] and 1 C of low sodium chicken stock. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low and simmer until tomatoes are tender. Cool slightly, remove the bay leaf and CAREFULLY transfer the sauce to a blender/food processor. Process to a smooth sauce [1 minute]. Pour the silky sauce into same saucepan, return the bay leaf, add 1/2 C of half and half and the reserved chicken, add a bit more stock if it seems too thick, simmer for 5 minutes, gently stirring to avoid sticking, adjust seasonings [salt, masala, fenugreek, cayenne]. She often  adds 1 ts of Ketchup as her 'secret' ingredient.

This turned out good - not quite restaurant quality, but I was pretty satisfied with the result.  I think more masala/seasoning should be added to the chicken, and the whole dish should simmer for longer than what the recipe calls.

My husband kept saying WOW! So this was definitely a hit! I too used fresh garlic and ginger b/c thats what I had on hand. I skipped the yogurt b/c honestly I forgot it and used FF half&half. I also made my own Garam Masala. I replaced the cornstarch with 1/4c ground cashews. I was also heavy handed when adding the spices. Oh and I also marinated the chicken in lemon juice. Next time I will marinate it in yogurt just for a change. Thank you for a delicious recipe that made my hubbs VERY happy :) **I blend the sauce before adding the chicken** I make this so much that I think next time I will add sliced peppers so we can get our veggie's in!-Update-This dish NEVER gets old. It is always amazing. Tonight I had no cashews on hand to grind so I followed recipe and still fabulous! LOVE IT! This will be in our family recipe box forever. I have still never added veggies :-)

I am an Indian woman who grew up with the rich flavors in indian cooking every dinner. This butter chicken recipe is amazing. However, i used fresh ginger and garlic (makes a HUGE difference) and doubled the butter and red peper,  although its still not overly spicy.  I agree with the review below,  add the methi and crushed cashews, that is a staple of indian cooking.  I also recommend making the sauce or entire dish the night before, as the flavors will really come out the next day as they sit.  Then you can warm on low for a few minutes before serving. Also, before cooking my chicken i marinated it in a tandoori spice mix and yogurt for a couple of hours  and that made the chicken itself very tasteful. enjoy!

What an amazing recipe!!  I have tried many recipes for makhani chicken and this is by far the best that I have come across!!  I did what a few others suggested and I added 1 tsp of coriander, doubled the garam masala, tripled the garlic and ginger (i use fresh garlic and fresh ginger and just grated them on a cheese shredder), used 2 extra tbs of butter, added a pinch of fenugreek in the end (i only had dried leaves so I ground those up and used them), omitted the water and substituted ground cashews for the cornstarch.  Also, instead of cooking the chicken separately, I add the raw cubed chicken to the dish when I add the tomato puree.  I lower the heat a bit and let that simmer about 5 minutes, then add the heavy cream (instead of half and half) and yogurt and let it simmer another 10-15 minutes or until the chicken pieces are done.  This process eliminates the extra spices recommended on the recipe for preparing the chicken.  Wow, what a great dish! I will definitely be making this to impress company!!

I'm sorry to say this, because I know I am going totally against the grain.  But I really was SO disappointed in this recipe.  It was NOTHING like I had expected.  I love eating indian food, and really enjoy cooking it.   But this was totally flavorless. I eat indian food once or twice a week, sometimes three times.   So perhaps I'm used to real indian food.  And this tasted like an Americanized version, not like authentic indian food at all.  I'll never make this again!

This was excellent.  Notes:  did not have shallots, so didn't use them.  Also added 1 T butter to peanut oil initially, and doubled the 2 T butter to 4 T.  Made my own tomato puree - threw into a food processor 2 tomatoes plus garlic cloves, added 1/2 can of tomato paste.  Because of the tomato paste, did not need to thicken w/cornstarch.  Did not have plain yogurt so substituted with very thick coconut milk - and it was DELICIOUS.  Kids LOVED this dish!!!  Excellent, and will definitely make it again.  Thanks so much for sharing!!

Thank you! Wonderful recipe...instead of garlic-ginger paste, I minced 1 1/2 tsp. each of garlic and ginger and sauteed them with the shallots & onions. Seemed to work beautifully!

Very very rarely do I think something is restaurant quality, but this comes close! Wow, delicious! I recommend using ghee (clarified Indian butter. You can get it from Indian Grocers, and even some Meijer stores in the 'International Foods' section) as it has a really rich buttery flavor. I wasn't sure whether to use tomato paste or tomato sauce but opted for sauce as I thought it might be too thick using paste. This is a great recipe. Thanks, Mitch!

yum yum yum yum yum!
My first attempt at making Indian food: A Success!! I'm not sure if i did everything according to the recipe, but i sure tried. Lets see...
*I didn't see the point of using onion and shallot, so i just used onion. I'm on a budget :)
*i ground up equal parts garlic cloves and ginger root to make a "paste" of sorts, i'm not sure it's what i was supposed to use but it lended just enough subtle flavor. And again, i'm on a budget! When would i use garlic ginger paste again? haha
*i used heavy cream (whipping cream) instead of 1/2 n 1/2, because i had it left over and one user suggested it anyway. I don't mind the extra fat... yum. ;)
*i could only find non-fat yogurt. Guess i made up for the cream. :)
*blended a can of tomatoes for a tomato puree. It's what we had...
*used frozen chicken breasts, but into chunks. I like white meat better than dark, and it's what we had.
*i used crushed cashews instead of cornstarch as a thickener as one reviewer suggested, because it sounded YUMMY, let alone authentic.

I served this with a blend of basmati rice, sautee'd onion, and sautee'd corn. It was heavenly :)

Yum!  So good.  I modified it according to the suggestions of other reviewers and substituted chick peas for the chicken (I'm a vegetarian).  Great flavor!

I've made this several times. Being the "queen of vacuum sealing" I can say without qualification that this recipe freezes beautifully in individual portions. I always double the recipe and freeze several meals' worth. I've tweaked it a bit, I add a few squirts of Agave nectar and I found that Chipotle Powder is the perfect chili flavor because it adds a hint of smoke. I replace half the butter with Coconut Oil (a much friendlier fat than popular belief). I also pressure-cook the chicken in broth with a splash of  liquid smoke (that's a secret for vacuum sealing ... keeps the meat really tender when re-heating ... which MUST be done in the oven ... never EVER microwave); and I use 1/2 Breast meat and the other half thigh meat. I've memorized this recipe and will be cooking it for years to come!

Fabulous! I doubled the sauce- we love lots of sauce to eat with the basamati rice.  Used light butter & chicken breasts & it worked great! Pretty close to Indian restaurants, but I agree Tandoori chicken makes it better.  Might try grilling my chicken next time.  No need to buy ginger garlic paste, just add approx. 1/4 tsp ground ginger to crushed fresh garlic.

I tripled the garlic, doubled the onion and ginger (used fresh) and tripled the garam masala.  I did not need to thicken this at the end, in fact I added a few extra shots of half and half.  I think because I simmered the sauce for longer than the 10 minutes called for because I was busy rolling and cooking naan.  With the modifications I made it was worth 5 stars.  I will make this again.

We have a favorite restaurant we visit where I enjoy Chicken Makhani. I made this recipe tonight. I have to say that this recipe is almost 100% exact to what I enjoy at my favorite Indian Restaurant! 

If I were to change anything, I'd make the chicken a bit more flavorful (maybe marinate overnight prior to use).  We're adding this to our regulars!!!

I make this in the crockpot and it always comes out delicious! No need for all the sauteing. I put chicken breasts in the pot along with many of the other ingredients and cook on low for 5-6 hours. I dice the chicken up before serving. I add the lemon, butter, yogurt and half-and-half at the end too, about 15 minutes before serving, so the flavors remain fresh. Serve this with homemade naan, if your feeling adventurous, and a side of rice and you won't be disappointed.

This was so delicious.  I was doing a lot of cooking the day I made this, so to make things a tiny bit easier I purchased a rotisserie chicken, took it off the bone and used that.
I wanted it lighter, so used evaporated milk instead of cream, and used ground cashews instead of cornstarch to thicken.  This was amazing and we will be having it again soon!

This is a good receipe but we found it to tomatoe tasting. We cook a lot of Indian Food (my husband is from India) so I would add more yogurt and less tomatoe puree and serve with basmati rice but use coconut milk to prepare the rice instead of water. You can also make some rita to go with it.   This should also be made ahead of time and allow to stay warm and marinate for some time before eating I made it in the afternoon and kept warm in the oven until we ate. Also 10 minute prep time is more than that we like to simmer our spices a long time before adding other ingrdients thats what makes indian food so good!

It is wise to follow the advice of many of the reviews to cut the cayenne pepper down to about half of what the recipe calls for unless you have a super high tolerance for spicey foods.  I doubled the order of this recipe, but only put 1 tsp of cayenne in and it was plenty spicey for my family and the flavor was fantastic. I did sub heavy cream for the 1/2 & 1/2, which may have helped in thickening the sauce, because by the time I added the chicken, it was perfect -I did not need to add the corn starch and water as a thickener. This recipe is excellent and my family really enjoyed it. I will add this to my rotation of recipes... Thanks, Mitch! -I forgot to mention that I did not have any tomato puree on hand so I used a can of stewed tomatoes that I chopped in my blender a bit.  It gave the sauce a real nice texture.

This is AMAZING! Simply the best Butter Chicken ever.  I did use fat free sour cream in place of yogurt, and added a little curry powder in with the spices.  Also used ground almonds at the end, instead of cornstarch.  It is better than any restaurant. Thanks so much for sharing!!!!

Great, Great, Great!  I used Fat-Free Half & Half and Fat-Free Yogurt.  Still great!  I also used cubed white-meat chicken, minced garlic from a jar, and ginger powder (to replace the garlic/ginger paste).  It was still awesome!  My "not too sure about it" wife, loved it!  Thanks!

I have eaten this dish in many Indian Restaraunts.  It's one of my favorites.  This, however was not good.  The chili powder is totally out of place.  IF I were to try this again, I would omit it.

This is a GREAT recipe!  Very easy and very good.  I didn't change a thing and it came out perfect.  I had quite a hard time finding the ginger garlic paste, but finally located it in the produce section near some stir fry mixes and sauces.  Highly recommended!

Marvelous 'base' recipe. The corrections advised by several other commentors were exactly right. I doubled the amount of garlic and ginger paste.
I added 1/2 tsp Fenugreek seeds and 1/2 tsp Coriander seeds (toasted lightly in a pan before grinding very fine) to the dry spices and used ground cashews to thicken as opposed to cornstarch. Add whole cashews to your blender, pulse them into 'meal', then add the entire sauce into the cashews in the blender. This produces a smooth and velvet sauce which is a complete success. HEED the corrections! With these minor fixes, this recipe exceeds all expectations.

As an Indian, this recipe was amazing.  My parents loved it, it was rich and creamy just like at any restaurant in India.  Very restaurant quality.  I subbed the half and half for heavy cream and I didn't bother much with the chicken (didn't do the spoonful of sauce on it - just kinda threw it all together once it was cooked).  I garnished prettily with tomato slices and cilantro and served with naan.  A BIG HIT!

After browning all the spices in the pan, I added the chicken along with tomato sauce, 1/2-and-1/2 in it.  I let the mixture simmer for 1 hour.  Right before I serve, I put 1 cup of yogurt.  For us, this is a wonderful dish!

Too Bland.  I even added extra spices.  Something is missing.  I've eaten Chicken Makhani in Malaysia and Singapore and its much better than this.  We were dissapointed.

We loved this chicken Makhani. We followed the suggestion of some reviewers to use ground cashews instead of corn starch and added coriander and heavy whipping cream instead of half-and-half. It tasted like in our favorite Indian restaurant.

This is delicious served with basmati rice.  Instead of the garlic-ginger paste I used 1 1/2 tsp. grated fresh ginger and 1 1/2 tsp. pressed garlic.  Used canola instead of peanut oil. Reduce heat before adding the half and half first, then add the yogurt to prevent curdling.  The sauce thickened on its own without having to add the cornstarch.  Next time will add 1 1/2 lb. chicken and try boneless breast.  Will make again!

I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could! I took the tips given by one reviewer and added the 1/4tsp of crushed methi (fennel seeds), used 1/4 cup of cream instead of the half and half and 1/4 cup finely ground unsalted cashew nuts as a thicker instead of corn starch...I think the cashews are an essential ingredient...it's not the same tasting sauce without them. I did't have the garlic ginger paste so I used 2 cloves of crushed garlic and some fresh crushed ginger. I also used Greek yoghurt which has a much creamier texture and taste. This dish was divine! Better than some I have had in restaurants. Hubby and 18 mth old both wolfed it down. Even pet ferrets gobbled up a piece that had fallen on the floor and spent the rest of the meal begging for more! You have to try this recipe. We'll be using it often.

Wonderful! I modified this recipe with several of the excellent suggestions -- 1/4 c. cream for the half and half, adding about 1/8 tsp ground fenugreek and 1 tsp of ground coriander to the dry spices. Used a coupla TBs ground cashews as a thickener. Delicious! What really set this off, though, was KevTM's suggestion for turmeric/cumin scented Basmati rice with peas. (See reviews for Curried Coconut Chicken here -- also a superb dish, BTW.) This Butter Chicken recipe specifies 4 (rather modest) servings. Next time, I will double to ensure some leftovers. Also, the suggestion to make your own ginger garlic paste...brilliant! Worked like a charm.

I have been on an indian food kick, and since we have been spending hundreds of dollars at our local indian restaurant, I decided to try a few recipes myself.  I did follow some of the other reviewers recommendations, and I modified some of the spicyness, but this was GREAT.  I did add 1 tsp of coriander, 1 tsp of cayenne pepper and a splash of coconut milk to the mix. I didnt have tomato puree, so I used 1/2 small can of tomato paste, a pinch of salt and 3/4 cup of water to use in its place.  I used whole milk instead of half & half to save on calories.  I also added about 1/4 cup of crushed cashews in place of the corn starch.  My husband always orders Chicken Makhani (Makhanwala), and he stuffed himself silly, and proclaimed that this was better than any Indian restaurant's version. Thank you for sharing!  I will DEFINATELY make this again - but will probably switch to low fat or fat free yogurt or I will blow up like a whale from eating this so often.

delicious, delicious, DE-licious!  i'm indian, and i loved this recipe!  i actually used the corn starch b/c i didn't have any cashews to thicken the sauce and it worked beautifully, no one would know.  a couple of changes - i used crushed tomatoes, and i put the chicken into the pot right after the spices and onions had cooked (this saved me an extra pot to wash, since i hate dirty dishes, and allowed the flavor to soak in better).  i also didn't have half and half or cream, so i used sour cream for that part.  it was so yummy!  better than at the restaurant.  will def make this again!

This is awesome, I made it many times and my husband just love it. I double the recipe ( sauce) and put it in the freezer for future use, so all I have to do is cook the chicken, and I add a little bit of cilantro at the end,it's just so good.... Thanks a lot for sharing your recipe.

Easy to prepare. I used fat free 1/2 and 1/2 and yogurt. Turned out creamy, smooth and yummy. I didn't have ginger garlic paste so subbed fresh garlic and ginger juice. Excellent. Would make again!

I've been eating butter chicken made by the Indian family I work for for years. I also get it every time I visit an Indian restaurant. I decided I'd finally try this on my own and was a little disappointed. 
I made this exactly like the recipe calls for: with ginger garlic paste I bought from my local Indian mart, and  the end result pretty bland. In fact, it didn't taste authentic or even close to Indian, it tasted like an creamy red pasta sauce for an Italian dish! I'm sure I didn't do anything wrong. So I tripled the amount of garlic ginger paste and added more and more garam masala until it tasted Indian. Which it finally did, but only with my alterations. In the end, it tasted pretty good but nothing like the butter chicken I'm used to. I think that I will follow other people's suggestions next time: with real ginger, garlic, cashew, and fenugreek.

It is rather delicious, but it seemed to be missing something to take it over the edge. Not sure what that would be... Maybe something slightly smoky or rich or a different curry powder? Overall still good curry.

Doubled the onion, garlic and ginger. Used cream instead of half and half, didn't have yogurt so I left it out. Left out cayenne. I used canned diced tomatoes because that's what I had. Once the sauce was cooked, I blended it until it was smooth. I added ground almonds as per another suggestion. Tossed in cubes of paneer instead of chicken. Also added coriander (1 tsp) and fenugreek seeds, ground (1/3 tsp) according to other reviews.

I have made this several times now vs. other butter chicken recipies and still love this version.  Only made a couple of tweeks to mine, I used cubed chicken breast instead and about a 1/3 cup of ground chachews instead of the cornstarch and water (based on a few other reviewers and a number of Indian friends who have mentioned that they NEVER use constarch to thicken sauces).  Also I usually leave the yogurt and the half-and-half on the counter from the start so they warm a little by the time it's mixed in.  I also mix those in very slowly to keep it from curdling - which has happened once or twice if I add them too fast and too cold.

I hate to give this such a bad rating, because this is one of my favorite Indian dishes.  However, this recipe is missing something vital.  I can't put my finger on what that something is, but I'll keep looking for the perfect butter chicken.

My husband is from Bangladesh, and I wanted to make something besides the same old chicken curry and other things he has taught me. I addad 1 tablespoon garam masala instead of 1 teaspoon and thought I was in trouble.  But he loved it.  He wants me to serve this to his Mother and friends from Bangladesh coming over this weekend.

This recipe is easy to make and the whole family loved it. I would use no fat 1/2 &1/2 to make it with less fat. I left out the tomato paste and it was still very good and we served it with brown basmati rice as well.

Thank you so much for this recipe, it is fantastic!  I took Yatuk''s advice and used ground cashews instead of corn starch and also used heavy cream but I only used half the amt of heavy cream, I thought that was enough - this recipe is excellent.    I was shocked there was no coriander, go figure.  Anyway, I doubled the recipe and I think that is the perfect amount.  The only variation to the recipe that I added was 1 tsp of honey and a little less than a tsp of sugar because I thought the sauce lacked some of the sweetness that I'm used to with this dish.  I love this so much and I will make this again and again - thank you!  It's great!

Overall I liked this recipe. Like other reviewrs, I thought it was lacking something, but realized that for the most part all of the flavors were right, juts not enough. I ended up doubling the ginger, garam marsala, cumin, lemon juice and garlic. Then it was delightfully flavorful.

I made this recipe with a few changes; added a little more butter (about 1 tbs), a little bit more yogurt (about 1 tbs), an extra splash of lemon juice, I used ground almonds instead of corn starch per the suggestion of other reviewers (I would have preferred cashews but didn't have them), I also added a pinch of brown sugar. I used less cumin than recommended and added some fresh coriander (cilantro). Before I added the ground almond and the coriander the sauce was good but definitely missing something. The addition of those two things greatly improved this recipe. The recipe is good overall and quite easy, considering the difficulty usually associated with Indian food!!

This was a flavorful, tasty recipe and my husband loved it. As other reviewers suggested, I tripled the garlic/ginger mixture (made the mix in my food processor), added a teaspoon of ground coriander, used whole milk instead of half and half, and used finely ground cashews as a binder instead of cornstarch. I also added a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes and 1/2 cup chicken broth (I cooked my chicken beforehand). At the "set aside" stage of step one, I poured the sauce into my food processor and gave it a good whirl as I felt the sauce was too chunky and looked kind of ugly. It turned out very smooth and a lovely shade of rust. I then poured the sauce, the chicken and the ground cashews in a large saucepan and heated it back up. Served over basmati rice. Nice change of pace.

Great Indian dish! I love the heat  and the creaminess of the sauce. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because I changed the recipe slightly so I'm not sure exactly how it is supposed to taste following the recipe to a tee. Unfortunately I did not have any garam masala. I did have all the other ingredients but substituted the chicken thighs for boneless chicken breasts cubed. I also added some tumeric and curry powder (probably about a teaspoon each - my family likes heat). I was very pleased with the dish overall and will make this again. I served this with Indian Chapati Bread (recipe also on this site). Yummy!

This was tasty. However, I grew up on Indian food and something is a little off. I think you need to let the garlic cook a little longer to take away some of the rawness. It tasted better the second day and froze well, so still a great recipe. Next time I'll try a longer cooking time.

Following an Indian reviewer's advice, we upped the ginger and garlic (doubled), and added a quarter teaspoon coriander.  Also, used ground cashews (whole cashews run through the blender) to thicken instead of cornstarch.  This turned out so delicious we are making it again tonight because we just couldn't get enough of it last night!

Awesome recipe, however i made a few changes: for ginger garlic paste, I mashed up equal parts ginger & garlic. Added 1 tsp extra of garam masala in the sauce (it tasted somewhat bland like plain yogurt beforehand.) Used 18% table cream. Used 1/4 tsp ground fenugreek/methi.  Instead of cornstarch & water, I used 1 tbsp ground almounds.  Note that in the directions, cayenne is missing from step #1.  I will definately make this again.  Definately beats restaurant bought Butter Ckn that can be so unpredictable like being over priced &/or runny.

Pretty good.  I didn't find it necessary to do step three to thicken the sauce -- it had perfect texture and smoothness as it was.

This was delicious. I made a few changes. First, I substituted ghee for the peanut oil, and used heavy whipping cream instead of half and half. The heavy cream thickened the sauce perfectly so I omitted the corn starch and water at the end. I also marinated my chicken overnight in Greek yogurt and a mixture of all the spices used in the recipe. This made all the difference in the world. The chicken was flavorful and tender. I will definitely make this again.

Delicious! I had a serious craving for butter chicken, and this recipe satisfied it! I did a little testing with the sauce to see what tasted best to thicken it... ground cashews all the way!I also added the fenugreek seeds recommended by one reviewer. I can't say with any certainty whether or not they made the recipe any better, but I went to the bulk store to buy a small amount, and once I smelled them, I immediately thought of authentic Indian cuisine. I'm going to assume that these must have improved things.

That being said, I rated this recipe a 4 star, as written. With the ground cashews and fenugreek, it was 5 star deliciousness!

The first time I made this recipe, the gravy was loved wayy more than the chicken - the common complaint was that the chicken seemed a little too flavour-less. The next time I made the dish, I marinated the chicken as follows: "1 tbsp ginger-garlic paste, 1/2 tsp red chilli powder, 1 tsp garam masala, 1-2 tbsp lemon juice, 3/4 cup yoghurt, 4 tbsp vegetable oil, 2 tbsps finely chopped fresh cilantro, salt to taste. Combine all of the above, add the chicken, and mix until evenly coated. Refrigerate overnight or for a minimum of 4 hours. Grill or shallow fry chicken until tender and fully cooked.' Once I had prepared the chicken, I followed this recipe exactly as is. Marinating the chicken made this dish delicious beyond words and was much loved by all who tasted it. I realise, that marinating the chicken changes up the recipe quite a bit, but not marinating the chicken just didn't give it the oomph it required. Once marinated, this recipe becomes a 5 star recipe. Thank you Mitchman21 for your recipe!

As some of the other reviewers said, this is pretty bland with the amount of spices as written (and I am a HUGE wimp about spicy food).  I suppose since garam masala is a mix, that different brands vary resulting in some that are spicier than others.  Either way, I prepared it as written and it reminded me of creamy tomato soup.  Tasty but bland. I added an extra  2 heaping teaspoons of garam masala, a sprinkling of chili powder, about 1/4 tsp of cinnamon, a little extra salt, and a heaping tablespoon of tomato paste. I omitted the cornstarch because my sauce was plenty thick enough.  This was my first time cooking anything Indian, so I felt a little lost when it came to the spices, but it ended up very delicious!  I will definitely make this again.

Made as is except added a little fenugreek and coriander as one reviewer suggested.  The wife orders chicken makhani every time we go to an Indian restaurant.  She said this was very close to the version she gets at the restaurant.

This dish comes together easily once all the prep work is done (your mise en place). I served the butter chicken over brown rice, garnished with a sprinkle of chopped cilantro and cashews. My BF praised it as "fantastic"! Definitely will make again.

I loved the recipe. I made it as is except the sauce seemed thick enough for my liking so I skipped the cornstarch part, however that is probably just my personal preference. Will definitely make this many times over. This is definitely better than my normal recipe.

This was my first foray into Indian cooking, and it turned out reasonably good, I think.  I accidentally used too much garam masala, but that was my mistake, and it still came out delicious.  Like other reviewers I felt there was something missing, I'll try adding coriander next time.  This is a great dish for someone cooking Indian for the first time!

This is not only simple but killer. It looks like an ordinary recipe but it has great character. My changes were simple. I didn't use garlic/ginger paste but minced the same amounts from fresh ingredients. I also made my own Garam Masala, a recipe that's all over the internet. Then, to burst flavor at the end, I tossed in fresh, chopped cilantro. Let it simmer. I never needed the corn starch. It thickens anyway. For an extra pleasure, toss in, either, 2 tsps. of Chili paste at the beginning or a whole red or green chile. The heat is just right, not uncomfortable. Enjoy.

It was very good.  I felt like the recipe was lacking something.  I will definantly make this again but try to find the right "it" factor to make this great for my tastes.  Thanks for the recipe.

I wanted to try something different from my typically southern style of cooking and this is the recipe I chose. This was my first foray into Indian style cooking and I have so say that this recipe was a great one to start with. I managed to find some garam masala at a local Indian market and made this dish exactly as the recipe called for with the exception of adding a little extra water when mixing in the cornstarch (to keep the sauce from turning into paste). Absolutely fantastic! I served the chicken over jasmati rice (basmati wasn't available at my local grocer) that was cooked in chicken broth and a little butter and the result was amazing. This is definately a restaurant quality dish and I'll definately be making it again!

My family raved about this one...although most added cayenne pepper to their plates to give it more heat.  I used fresh garlic and ginger but otherwise followed the recipe as is.  I tripled the recipe, fed 6 people and have enough leftover for lunch tomorrow.  Definitely planning to make this again!

I made this twice in one week. I wanted to imulate the Indian resturant we go too. The 2nd time was a winner. I used canola oil instead of peanut, a teaspoon of cumin/coriander, One cup heavy cream instead of half and half, 6 oz. of tomato paste instead of puree. I did not have to add cornstarch and water it was thick enough. Also I added a handful of yellow rasins and almond slivers. They had the rasins and almonds at the indian resturant and I loved them. Im still giving it 5 stars bec I prob would not have attempted to make this inless I found a recipe. This tasted just like the resturant we go to but less expensive. This is one of the best dishes I have ever made and I thank you.

This was excellent. I followed the advice of some of the other commenters and added a 1/2 teaspoon of coriander, and substituted ground cashews for the corn starch. I'll definitely be making this again, probably many times.

Good recipe. I tried another recipe for butter chicken at this site, but I prefer this one. I used 1/4 cup of ground cashews and it was yummy. Served over rice and some chapatti bread (also from this site).

This was excellent!! I doubled the amount of curry though, because the flavour was a little mild.

Quite a nice flavour. I did spice it up a bit with more chilli (I love super hot peppers). I also added corriander to the finished product as a wonderful garnish and used ground cashews to thicken the mix and it turned out fantastic. I did also roast and grind the spices myself.

Did not like it at all. If you know what real Indian Butter chicken tastes like this is a very mild version. I compared it with the real thing (Indian cookbook) and it calls for 6 cups of chopped onion!This dish is definitely missing something...If you are a lover of real Indian food, skip this one.

This is a pretty good recipe.  I have already made about 3 times and each time my husband raves about it.  The only thing I do different from the recipe is that I add about 1 tsp coriander powder with all the other spices and at the end I just let the chicken cook in the sauce and the sauce thickens while the chicken pieces cook, so I don't add any cornstarch.  Taste really good with naan bread, which I buy.  This is one that is a keeper.

This is a very simple but deeelicious recipe. I am Indian so I found the recipe to be a bit too mild for my liking, a little extra of the dry spices, cayenne, heavy cream, and some ground cashews in the last step fixed that! Also, I cooked the chicken with a little bit of ginger-garlic paste, salt and cayenne during the first 10 minutes of cooking to eliminate a bland flavor in the chicken and then proceeded with the rest of the recipe. With those additions, it was fantastic!!!

Oh sorry folks...this one was bad too. I must say I had a lot of fun searching for the ingredients at Harry's in Marrieta, GA...but after that it was all down hill.The flavor was very odd....it was not creamy enough (which of course can be fixed next time) but it was like eating a really bad tasting spice cookie. Unfortunately chicken shouldn't taste like a spice cookie! Hope you enjoy it more then we did!

This is a very good dish. It's a nice change from many of the Curry Chicken type recipes that are on this site. I added a teaspoon of black mustard seeds that really enhanced the flavor.

YUM! This recipe is great! The only changes I made was to omit the red pepper and cornstarch (I thought the sauce did not need thickening).  I also cooked the chicken first then made the sauce.  This recipe is a keeper!

Delicious!!  I just threw everything in my slow cooker overnight (except the yogurt, which I added during the last 15 minutes of cook time, and I omitted the half-n-half) and it came out wonderful.  Next time I make this I will add diced potatoes! Mmmmm...  :)

This was so delicious.  My moroccan husband and two children cleaned their plates.  This is so delicious.  My husband would have liked a lot more "spice" so if  you like spice be sure and kick up the red pepper a few notches but it was great as was for the kids.  I was really impressed with this.  Did I mention this was so delicious?

This was an excellent and easy recipe.  My husband raved about it and my two year old cleaned her plate!  Now I can't wait to impress my friends with some exotic Indian cuisine!  I couldn't find the garlic-ginger paste, so I minced them fresh and made a "paste" with my pestil and mortar.

This was delicious, and my first foray into Indian cooking, which I have wanted to do for a while. Only problem I had was the called-for ingredient "ginger garlic paste." Not knowing what it really was, I just ground up some garlic and ginger in the food processor. Served with basmati rice and steamed spinach.

I made this last night for my boyfriend and he loved it! However,  I noticed the minor things in the sauce because I tried it along the way as I was making it. I really disliked the cornstarch because it made the dish gritty. Next time I will try using crushed cashews like one reviewer mentioned.  It wasn't as tangy or creamy, but Had more of a dull flavor.  I'm not sure if it has to do with the tomato purée I used or what.

Good recipe, i used a cup of yogurt for a velvety texture and would recommend marinating the chicken ahead of time

I made a delicious chicken makhani using this recipe as a starting point (managed to please an Indian friend). 

However, this recipe on its own is missing a few necessary components without which this just does not work at all.

1. (and most importantly) - Brown Sugar!!! There's no sugar in this recipe and chicken makhani is a sweet, spicy dish.
2. Fenugreek seed (another commenter put me on to this - good call). 
3. Double the garam masala (at least) and cayenne pepper. 
4. Coconut milk is not essential, but it changed the dish from fantastic to perfect. 

I didn't end up needing to add cornstarch, the consistency was perfect on its own.

This was excellent! I followed the advice of the reviewers and I substituted ground almonds for the cornstarch/water slurry (my son is allergic to cashews) and I also added 1/2 tsp of ground coriander. Used fresh garlic and ginger - so I tripled that and I ended up doubling the garam masala.  This is as good as any restaurant dish :)

This was a great dish.  I love to make Chicken Tikka Masala, which is really similar to this but this one is quicker and tastes just as great.  I'll be making this again and again.  As usual, it was even better the next day for lunch!

Made this today and it turned out pretty good. In addition to the changes suggested by AMIBOULD (triple the garlic/ginger and add coriander,) I added just a tiny bit of cinnamon towards the end of the final simmer to bring out the other spices and add a little sweet to the spicy. It made a huge difference.

Not quite as good as my favorite local Indian restaurant, but pretty darn close!

Absolutely WONDERFUL! I use chicken breasts instead of thighs. Also, as previously mentioned, use ground cashews instead of cornstarch. If you don't have a food processor, a coffee bean grinder works!

it is tasty, but it is not a good Chicken Makhani.  I followed all the directions, but I felt like there was too much yogurt.  You may want to lighten-up on the yogurt and half-n-half.

Very mild...yummy, but not the best butter chicken I have had.  I made it as the recipe reads except skipped the shallot and the yogurt, and substituted coconut milk for the half and half.

First time making butter chicken and it was fantastic.  Chicken needs more than 10 minutes to cook.  I used fresh garlic and ginger and double the amount.  Other than that, this was just delcious!  Thank you.

This was the first time I made butter chicken and it turned out awesome!  Since I moved out of state, I can't find a place that serves it and it really hit the spot, as I've been craving for a while now.  I used 1/2cup half-and-half with 1/2cup coconut milk instead of the full 1 cup half-an-half.  I substituted the plain yogurt for sour cream and I marinated the chicken pieces in the garlic ginger paste and lemon juice to tenderize it a little.  Served over basmati rice.  SO GOOD!

Made with brown basmati rice. Originally made exactly according to recipe, but after tasting added a lot more garlic and ginger. Was pretty good!

Amazing, easy recipe to use.  I used boneless chicken thighs instead since it's what I had on hand.  The only thing different that I would do next time is I would make my own garam masala and I was thinking of adding some white raisins.  I think the raisins would soak up the saltiness in the sauce and the sweet and salty raisin would make a great addition to the dish.  Overall, what a great Indian dish!

I made this for my OAMC meal swap group. This meal freezes very well. I used cashews not cornstarch, and I doubled the sauce. I also used dark meat from the chicken. Serioulsy sooo good! Every family in meal swap loved this. I made homemade naan to go with this.

I am not rating this recipe-I need help from you with the listed ingredients.  Listed ingredient is 
1 cup of tomato puree---in the cooking directions it says add tomato sauce??  Does mitchman21 want us to use tomato puree or tomato sauce?? Since I have never made chicken makhani before I don't know what kind of tomato flavor you're looking for, or what the sauce consistency should be-- I rated this 5 stars because I couldn't leave a comment without  a rating----based on all the other comments --I know that it will be delicious
thank you

Delicious.  Used coconut oil instead of peanut oil, and made my own ginger-garlic paste.  Also used chicken breast cut into cubes (my husband has an unhealthy fear of chicken thighs. . . strange). Also added some chopped peppers and some frozen peas at the end- gotta have my veggies!
 Really yummy, great consistency, highly recommended!

Probably not fair but I knocked off a star for using too many pans.  I made some major method changes but kept the ingredients exactly the same. First I seasoned the chicken and cooked it, as stated, in a cast iron skillet. I dumped it out on to a plate and continued with the sauce, in the same skillet. I subbed hot sauce for the cayenne so my kids will eat this, but otherwise followed exactly. I added 2 chopped up potatoes and the chicken when the sauce came together and let them simmer together for about 20 minutes. With the starch from the taters, it didn't need any cornstarch. Towards the end I stole a bite and thought it was very bland, so in a small bowl I mixed extra of all the spices and poured it in and stirred it up. Added more salt than I thought I would need, too, but that could be from the taters. I have a feeling this dish is going to be WAY better tomorrow than it is today. I'll update then

Quite disappointed in this recipe, made exactly as written, except instead of cornstarch I used ground cashews as suggested by a reviewer. I found this quite bland, missing a lot of what makes butter chicken so good. I went on an indian food site and found a much better and authentic recipe.

I made this for the first time for a dinner party and everyone LOVED it. We all agreed that it tasted way better than any jar of sauce we've had from the supermarket.   It's easy to make and the only modification is that I added some ground coriander as mentioned buy another reviewer.   I'm so happy to have discovered this recipe. Butter chicken is my favorite Indian dish and this is definitely being put into regular rotation in my kitchen :)

I LOVE this dish!  I make a double batch and freeze half.  It is a very forgiving recipe as well.  You can make changes/adjustments and not end up with a mistake.  The last time I made it, I replaced the 1/2 & 1/2 with a can of coconut milk.  MMMmm!  I also toss in a can of (drained) soy beans for added protein.  I bet one could skip the chicken and use tofu and/or soy beans to make it vegetarian.  Two thumbs up!!

Wonderful! I did make some changes such as using ground almonds a thickener and whole cream instead of half and half. This is just delicious. I also added the ground fenugreek seeds as one reviewer suggested. Very good.

I'm not from India, but was taught how to cook Indian food years ago.  I can make anything from scratch and am addicted to my curries.  Your recipe is the beginning of a good butter chicken.  I found it very bland and had to modify it with more spices.  I made it in my slow cooker on high for four hours which helped blend the flavors.  Thank you though, for the recipe.

If I were to try this again, I'd use 1 cup of coconut milk in place of the half-and-half to make it more authetic Indian. I highly recommend puree'ing the sauce prior to adding the chicken.

Wow is this delicious!  This was the very first recipe I had saved from AR and I am very mad at myself for not trying it sooner!  My husband, who is not into trying new things, loved this!  The only thing I did different was I made my own ginger garlic paste and added more cayenne because I love spicy!  I also didnt need to thicken it in the end because it seemed to thicken up itself!  Super yummy!  10 stars:)

Improvised with what I had in the pantry: chicken breasts (3), vegetable oil, sour cream instead of yogurt and half-and-half, peeled a large tomato and puree it, minced 2 cloves of garlic with same amount of fresh ginger, no shallots nor chili, and kept the garam masala, cumin and cayenne to its original proportions. Terrific texture and flavor. There was no need to thicken with starch but I added more lemon juice to taste.

This was so good!! I wish i had used chicken breast instead of thighs though but thats because of personal preference. I used fat free half and half and it turned out great. I followed the recipe exactly. I will make this again.

Excellent; very nice flavor.  I used half whipping cream, half whole milk.  I doubled the butter, and increased the garam masala in the sauce by half. Used chicken breasts cut in small pieces, and finished the sauce in the pan with the chicken.  This will be my go-to recipe for butter chicken (it is the best one out of the 3 or 4 I have tried).  I made it with just a sprinkle of cayenne so the kids could eat it.

this came out fairly well for me. the only changes i made were to use ghee instead of peanut oil, added some diced tomatoes as well as the puree, added 1 tsp coriander powder in with the spices, used fat free half and half, and used chicken breast instead of thighs. i would rather have used the thighs, but couldnt find them boneless, and was too lazy to debone. next time instead of half and half, i will use coconut milk. i did use the corn starch, but ALSO ground up cashews to make it even a little thicker. added chopped cilantro as a garnish. served over basmati rice with naan bread.....perfect compliments! could have used a mango lassi to drink! tastes even better the next day since the flavors really meld.

I made this dish last night with some trepidation. I've never cook Indian before, in fact I am just getting into the delight of Indian spices. Anyway, I found all the materials easily, and substituted Low fat buttermilk instead of half and half as suggested. Loved the way this turned out and was surprised by how easy and quick it was to make! My husband put on Basmati rice and by the time it was done boiling, my part was almost done! I cooked the chicken at the same time as the sauce so total cooking time was maybe 15 minutes :) Will absolutely make again!

This is excellent!  And boy does it make the house smell good.  Very full flavored.  Serve with a "quiet" rice dish, as the gravy from the chicken provides all the flavor you need.

My sister took me out to a authentic Indian restaurant where I tasted Butter Chicken for the first time.  I followed this recipe as close as possible, but because I live in Hick Town USA I couldn't find ginger garlic paste so I substituted 1/2 a Tablespoon each of fresh ginger and minced garlic.  The dish came out very close to the authentic dish I had at the Indian restaurant.  I even made my own Naan to eat with it - since no one here in Hicksville ever heard of Naan.  Delicious!

My son had never had this dish before and loved it; my daughter, who had ordered it in a restaurant previously, thought it was just okay.  I think I should have held back on the cayenne, as that dominated the dish.  I may try sour cream instead of yogurt next time...the ground cashews were a nice touch.

I took earlier advice and added 1/2 tsp coriander and thickened with 1/4 C crushed cashews instead of the cornstarch and blended the sauce in the blender before combining with the chicken and it was amazing.  It was actually comparable to our favorite Indian restaurant's.

This is great!  I use cashews as suggested, and it makes a tasty difference.  I use low fat cream and yogurt which helps make this dish a wee bit healthier.  I also add a bit more chicken than called for.  Serve with brown basmati rice and warmed naan or lightly butter a whole wheat pita, add finely chopped garlic and broil for a few minutes.  Mmmm!! Thanks for sharing this, MITCHMAN21; it's become a family favourite!

This recipe is wonderful!  I make chicken for 2, leaving the sauce ingredients to scale (for 4) because my husband and I like lots of sauce over our rice.  I also omit the cornstarch and water.  I don't find it necessary; the sauce thickens on its own upon standing.  This dish is one of our favorites; it will always have a place in our monthly rotation!

Outstanding!!! We really enjoyed this dish. As suggested by "Chibi Chef" I added 1/4 c cashews instead of cornstarch, reduced fat buttermilk instead of haf-and-half and when my sauce was ready I put in the blender with the cashews (except the bay leave), so it turned very smooth instead of having little pieces of onions/shallots/cashews. After that put back in the saucepan along with the bay leave and simmered for 10 minutes. Served with basmati brown rice and Roasted Rosemary Cauliflower from this site. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe, Mitchman21!

The base of this recipe was delicious.  I loved the flavors, and it was pretty simple to make!  (I used regular 2% milk instead of cream, and just added little by little as needed - and stirred in, to make sure it didn't get watery).  However, I would not use chicken thighs with this next time.  I think it would be better to skewer large cubes of boneless, skinless chicken breasts and grill them.  Then, to add to the sauce.  Also, I marinated my chicken for about an hour, in yogurt, lime juice, and some garam masala.  Good recipe. :)

This is the best chicken makhani recipe that I have come across.  I doubled the amount of garlic/ginger paste, used heavy cream instead of half and half, added coriander and a little extra garam masala, and added sugar (to taste) and the dish came out absolutely perfect.  I finished each plate with cilantro and a lemon wedge (for a little added kick), and served this with some basmati rice.  Will definitely make this one again and again!

This was fabulous! I made it for my family, and my father LOVED it! (He's really picky!) You DO need a least a pinch of cayenne in the sauce to bring out the flavor.

I love Chicken Makhani and this is a great recipe. I only made a few alterations and it tasted like an authentic Indian restaurant dish. Unfortunately I didn't have any cashews, but next time I make this, I will add those in too. I omitted the cornstarch, added a little dash of cinnamon, about 3/4 cup chicken broth and tossed freshed chopped cilantro on top after I plated the chicken over rice. My husband had 3 servings and kept saying, "mmm, this is really good"

A subtly flavored dish for beginning Indian palates. The flavors meld perfectly together. That being said, it just doesn't do it for me...but I can see how this dish would appeal to many people. Thanks for sharing with us.

As far as Indian food goes this recipe is my favorite. I look toward this recipe as one of my ultimate comfort foods. My husband wasn't as crazy about it because of the cinnamon and spice in the garam masala but I have come to crave it. Also, since it's just my husband and I, I freeze have the sauce when I make it.

This recipe is great however I do wish that the rice recipe was included.  We used white basmati rice but my husband said that typically saffron and cardamom are added.  That would have made this a perfect dish!  We also made garlic naan to go with it.  It was delicious!

I really enjoyed this dish! 

Following from other reviews, I made a couple of changes. I used fresh garlic and ginger and substituted cumin and coriander for the garam masala (didn't have any) and added a handful of cashew nuts, ground up, as a thickener instead of cornflour. As a vegetarian, I used chick peas instead of chicken and bulked it up with quartered mushrooms. 

It turned out creamy and sweet and my husband and I both loved it. Although easy to make, I would be happy to serve this the next time I have company over for dinner.

This is great!  My husband's parents are from India and I made this for them.  Even though this is a North India recipe (they're from S. India) they like it a lot.  Very authentic.  Easy too.

I make this recipe but I like to use chicken on the bones for more flavor and I use a whold carton of plain yogurt and and I use some honey in the sauce after it cooks to take away the bitterness and I use some curry in the sauce and use crushed tomatoes and it turns out awesome.

Really delicious.  Served with brown rice and a nice cucumber salad, this was such a wonderful balance of sweet,salty,spicy and tart.  I added about a tsp. of coriander.  Used tomato sauce.  Roasted some sweet potato along side.  What a treat!  Thanks for your contribution!

Delicious, especially the next day or even after a few hours sitting.  The third time I made this I used Paneer (Indian) cheese, frying it first before adding.  Just as good as with chicken!

I did what I could with the ingredients I had on hand and it still turned out really well, so it must be a 5 star. I only had an organic tomato and basil pasta sauce, and cumin and curry powders - no garam masala- so I improvised. Just used butter, no oil. Cooked the chicken right in the sauce. It reduced and there was no need to thicken it. Don't use cornstarch! The cashews are a much better idea. The lemon was the kicker, though. Gotta have that. Nice to have such a tasty, forgiving recipe.

Had to make my own garam masala since the ethnic food section in my grocery store is extremely limited :(  I found a quick and easy recipe on this site.  This dish was my first attempt at Indian food and my family and I loved it!

Great recipe!  I was a little concerned as someone Indian did not write the recipe but it turned out well.  Adding 1 tbsp of ground almonds and cashews, helps to make it thicker.  I also added 1/4 tsp of ground white pepper, ground coriander, ground chilis, sugar, 1 cup yogurt and 1.5 c half and half cream.  I didn't end up needing any cornstarch as it was thick enough.  

For vegetarians: I made it using Quorn veggie chicken pieces/nuggets.

Rating: 4/5 stars It was a pretty easy recipe with a great restaurant quality result! I also made a vegetarian version with chickpeas instead of chicken. To make it an everyday dish I would use half-and-half and less butter. I made this recipe with a few additions and substitutions: -I used 1 cup of diced tomato and 1/2 can of tomato paste in lieu of the "tomato puree", I just pureed the mixture with my food chopper
-I used whipping cream instead of half-and-half -I added a 1/4 cup of ground almond and omitted the cornstarch as suggested by other chefs on the Allrecipes website -I added an extra tsp of garam masala, 1 tsp of ground coriander, and a dash of ground cinnamon and clove to the spice mixture -I added about a 1/2 cup of chopped cilantro, half in the curry and half to garnish the dish -I seasoned the chicken thighs with a bit of sea salt and garlic powder -I used 1 Tbsp of fresh garlic and less than 1 Tbsp of fresh ginger in lieu of the ginger/garlic paste -I used canola oil instead of peanut oil

Not sure what happened with this recipe. I was so looking forward to it...I followed the directions & used ingredient additions that other reviewers suggested. It turned out oily and thin with no hint of the creamy texture you get in restaurants. I would be glad for any suggestions if this was a user error--I really want a good butter chicken recipe!

Wow!!!  What a fantastic dish.  I almost licked my plate clean.  It's really similar to the chicken makhani at my favorite Indian restaurant, which I now live 20 hours away from. :(  
Anyway, I used chicken breast because that's what I had.  I also couldn't find ginger-garlic paste, so I used half a tablespoon ginger paste and half a tablespooon minced garlic.  It also turns out I didn't have cayenne pepper, so I had to use ground red pepper (though I think the cayenne would've been better).  
Thank you so much for a good makhani recipe!  We haven't been able to find a good Indian restaurant here in Texas and I've really been craving it.

An alternative to try for vegetarians: instead of chicken use cubes of Indian cheese called "paneer". Paneer cubes can be found in the frozen sections of Indian grocery stores and many regular grocery stores. Simmer the paneer cubes in the sauce and the dish created is another East Indian favourite called "Shaahi Paneer".

I made this last night for dinner and it was really, really good.  My husband thought it was great.  Followed the recipe pretty closely but did add some ground coriander and fenugreek (just a touch) and used canned diced tomatoes which I crushed up because I didn't have puree.  I won't do this again with chicken thighs - too much work to debone and mess with - I'll use chcken breast.  Served it with Basmati Rice - it was yummy.

A good recipe but time consuming. I live in an area with many Indian restaurant, one which has the best Butter chicken Ive had. This recipe isnt as good as that but has a nice taste. I added  one small can of tomato paste to thicken as it was quite thin to start.

Wonderful recipe my boyfriend and I always prepare.  I've followed suggestion of marinating the chicken before cooking - makes a huge difference in the texture and moistness of the meat.  but I've made plenty of times without marinating and it comes out just as great.  Thank you for sharing!

Oh goodness, this turned out perfect and was so delicious. Even my 2 kids (who are pretty picky) enjoyed this. I decided to go all out with this recipe and used heavy whipping cream in place of the half and half. Of course that made it ever so creamy and wonderful and I used about a tablespoon of lemon juice. I also had to add more salt to suit our taste, and to the finished product, I added about 5 chopped green onions which I let simmer about 5 minutes before I turned the heat off. My daughter ate this over rice and my son and husband ate it with paratha. We all enjoyed this very much and I will certainly be making this again. Thanks Mitch.

It was good. I prepared this in the SLOWCOOKER. I doubled the recipe. I also took the suggestion of another member and added a pinch of fennel seed, which was a nice touch. I used canned tomatoes because I like the texture and one or two tablespoons of honey. I served this with "Indian style rice" which can also be found on this site. It was very good and everone enjoyed it. But...there was something missing. It didn't taste exactly like the butter chicken I've had. But very close.

Like another poster, I thought this was very good but was lacking a little something, not sure what.  I will definitely make this again and take the suggestions of other posters who added an ingredient.  Hubbie loved it as is.  I served it with Naan.

Excellent. If the sauce is too peppery, try a different garam masala or mix up your own. One of the commercial ones is mostly black pepper, another is mostly salt! I prefer one that has more cumin, cinnamon and coriander. I used a can of evaporated milk instead of half and half.

Very good dish - I followed the recipe pretty closely. Next time I will use a touch less tomato and a bit more 'heat'.  Not the easiest recipe in the world but well worth the effort.

Hey Mitch, this was great!  Our grocery didn't have tomato puree, so I used paste with a little water mixed in.  For this reason (I guess), the sauce was thick enough, so we didn't need the corn starch.  No  matter... it was delicious!  A real keeper.  Thanks!

This recipe was very good and could even have been spicier for our own taste. What my problem was with the recipe is that I could buy Masala ready made (the spices already mixed) and it would be just as good and a LOT easier. I found it to be a lot of work for the eventual result. Nonetheless, it was a good recipe and if you enjoy working a lot in the kitchen then this is for you.

Well, Chicken Makhani is my absolute favorite... usually i can just eat the sauce with a spoon, and dip it in bread...This recipe however, has too much of an overwhelmingly "peppery" flavor...the sauce, was actually a bit tart and tangy at first (i added a tsp. of brown sugar to even it out)- after adding the chicken (which was cooked seperately) the whole thing was just one big peppery yuck! I DO NOT reccomend using chicken thighs, even though i prefer dark to light, just not with this recipe-- the thighs turn an unappetizing color, and well, i don't know-- i just wasn't pleased... The sauce cannot be devoured alone or with naan bread, because it is simply too too peppery, and i followed the recipe to a T

Probably the best Butter Chicken recipe I've found so far. The only problem with it is the amount of ingredients, which may make it challenging for the novice cook. However, having said that, it is recommended you prepare everything ahead of time and pre-measure all your ingredients. I would increase the Masala to 1-1/2 teaspoons and put a little less Chili Powder in.

This was good.  It was a lot of work, and I'm not sure it was worth it.  It did have a great taste though.  I used fat free half-and-half and fat free yogurt so it curdled a little but I was expecting that.  It didn't affect the flavor.  I didn't bother thickening with cornstarch.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts instead of thighs.  I enjoyed the leftovers.  Served with brown basmati rice and whole-wheat naan bread from Trader Joe's.  Maybe I could reduce the work by adding the chicken to the first batch of sauce and letting it all simmer together until the chicken is cooked through.

This is our favorite Indian curry recipe!  It's wonderful - so flavorful, easy to prepare and delicious beyond words!  If you like Indian food and red curries, try this recipe!  We serve it on white rice or with Indian 'naan' bread (you can find this frozen and you can just heat in a pan, in most Asian grocers).  Also, we used 'Patak's' brand Ginger Garlic Paste - we found it in just our regular grocery store (though our's has a pretty comprehensive international foods section).  *Note: I'd cut down a bit on the garam marsala depending on brand - the one I used was a little bit salty.

Very, very good -- but even better the day after, when the flavors have had time to blend. I found the storebought garam masala seasoning a bit bland, so I doubled the amount in this recipe, and added 1/4 tsp. cinnamon. (That's just my preference; others may find it overpowering.) I followed the advice of another reviewer and eschewed the cornstarch in favor of cashews. Also, I boiled the 1/4 cup water before adding the nuts, and let it all steep a few minutes before adding to the sauce.

Restaurant quality recipe.  I loved it.  Note that 1/4 tsp cayenne is called for; additional cayenne is used to make it hotter.  Admitting that I like spicy food, the first 1/4 tsp is a bare minimum for the dish.  This dish be repeated at my home!

I was dissapointed with this. I made it on the premise of the 5 star rating and it was rather tomatoey in taste. I am wondering if I used the wrong tomato base though. It called for tomatoe puree and I used tomato paste. Also it wasn't spicy AT ALL. Probably won't make it again.

If I could give this recipe a six or seven, I would. My husband and I went to a food and wine show recently. I had never sampled butter chicken before but a restaurant in town was serving this dish at the show. I immediately determined to try to find a good recipe for it because I was BOWLED OVER by how good it was. Well, food fans -- this recipe here duplicates the one I had at the food show. You do have to follow it closely. Don't substitute for the garam masala. But it is worth it. Great recipe. Thanks to whoever put it on.

My husband loved it and he likes spicy foods. So I will make it again.  I did use milk instead of half-and-half, a can of diced tomatoes instead of tomato puree, and diced chicken breast instead of chicken thighs.  There are lots of ingredients, but the results are well worth it.!

This was great!! But I did change it up a bit. I listened to the person below that said to use heavy whipping cream, and cashews (instead of cornstarch).  I also doubled the spices in the sauce. Threw the chicken in the sauce, and let it simmer in my LeCreuset for an hour or so. The only thing I want to try next time is to up the cream and tomato purée.  I want a little more sauce - not much, just a little.

The second time I made this I used boneless skinless chicken breast instead of thighs to make it more diet friendly. I also increased the amount of ground cayenne to make it a little more spicy.

I used three tablespoons of the ginger garlic paste instead, and added one teaspoon of coriander as well. Also replaced the cornstarch with a quarter cup of ground cashews (I love it whenever I can get use out of my mortar and pestle!) and served over rice. The only thing I didn't like is that I used tomato paste instead of tomato puree and the taste was overwhelming, so next time I'll have to use tomato sauce.

I tried this recipe this week, my first attempt at Indian food.  My husband and I love it over jasmine rice.
The only adjustment I made was to add about 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt, about 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder and a bit more tomato paste.  We had it with warm garlic naan which was a nice addition.

This dish was absolutely delicious. It tastes pretty similar to what I've ordered in an Indian restaurant.  I made some changes like some of the reviewers suggested. I used 1.5 T of fresh ginger, 3 cloves of garlic, and a cup of whole milk instead of half and half. I will be keeping this recipe!!

Followed suggestions and made a couple of substitutions based on what was on hand.  Used tomato paste (2-3 tb), 1/4 cup of ground cashews in lieu of corn starch, added about 1/4-1/2 tsp ground coriander.  And used fat free greek yogurt.  Also just used mincend garlic (2 cloves) and about an inch of grated ginger instead of the ginger/garlic paste.  When I tasted the sauce at first, it didn't seem very flavorful, but somehow, by the time it was mixed with the chicken and done simmering, it had turned into an amazing combination of flavors...very close to the familiar restaurant taste.

This tasted fantastic.  I did use a 3 pound bag of boneless, skinless chicken thighs and stretched, probably doubled, the sauce.  As the chicken was browning I spooned off quite a bit of the liquid that cooked out so that it would cook a little faster and brown a bit.  Used minced fresh garlic and ginger in equal proportions for the ginger garlic paste.  Do not double the cornstarch as it would end up too thick.  Served this with Baingan Bharta  from this site as a side dish.

i made this using a sauce i found online at spicemode
i used the masala sauce instead of chopping onions, garlic and ginger.
It saved me a ton of itme and kept my fingers from smelling.  the sauce had garam masala and spices already in it.  saved me 30 mins and came out amazing.
my wife loved it.

I make a lot of Indian food, and this is a pretty good recipe. A couple of suggestions. A lot of people seem confused by tomato puree. This is not tomato paste, and not tomato sauce. You sometimes see it in the grocery store as passata, or as strained tomatoes. Makes a big difference. Also, just skip the chili powder. Use fresh garlic and ginger. And if you want that yellowy restaurant look, add a tbsp of turmeric. I use leftover roast chicken, and it turned out really well.

Great recipe. Thank you. Substituted sesame oil for peanut oil, heavy whipping cream for half n half, crushed almonds instead of corn starch, Louisiana hot sauce in place of cayenne pepper and added fresh cilantro to gravy with a very nice result. The sweetness was nice and feel that the additions got close to restaurant quality. I think next time I will add a Serrano pepper to spice it up more.

SO GOOD. The sauce was velvety and spicy but not overwhelming. A new favorite in this house.

I only used a dash of pepper, because boyfriend has acid reflux, and used vegetable oil because that's what my grandmother and my mother and all her sisters mostly used. Weirdly, it was SO SWEET. Tried again, today, determined to find a way to make it work - same deal.

Very buttery, which can cause issues with grease and upset stomach. But otherwise, it's amazing and we love it!

The best butter chicken recipe I've ever tasted! Use cashews instead of corn starch to thicken at the end.

I only wished I had naan to serve with it! I didn't feel like venturing out in the rain to get some, but that's the only thing I can think of that would've made this recipe better! I subbed 2% milk for the half-and-half and used chicken breast. For the ginger-garlic paste, I simply made my own with my knife and garlic press. I can only imagine how much more developed the flavors will become by tomorrow evening when we eat the leftovers!

This was so good! I skipped the water and the starch at the end of the recipe, I felt like it already had great taste and consistency and worried about watering it down. You choose how spicy you want this to be, if you want lots of chili powder or just a little bit. Super tasty!

Very good, but needed a little fresh cilatro stirred in at the end. Also, as another reviewer mentioned, sauce is thick enough but if you wanted to add the water and a thickener, go with ground cashews. I like my Indian dishes fairly hot, so I increased the cayenne and I also added an additional tsp of Garam Masala to intensify the flavor. All in all, a very nice recipe that I will definitely make again.

I have had some problems with the dairy breaking but my whole family loves this recipe! I have followed the few suggestions to make it more authentic, I have fenugreek, and ground cashews. I also added corriander. Today I am letting the chicken sit in the spices before cooking. I would love more easy Indian recipes like this.

What a wonderful recipe! Thank you! I had Butter Chicken in Toronto 4 years ago and my taste buds have never been the same. It seemed too hard a recipe to replicate so I never bothered and settled for Butter Chicken sauce-in-a-jar. This year I'm fearless in the kitchen! This recipe made it so easy. My husband and sons loved it! My hubby said, "Now that I KNOW, you can make it, expect me to ask for it a lot! Thanks again!

I made this for dinner tonight, along with some Aloo Phujia, and really enjoyed this dish. Even my teenage nephew, who is a typical teenage picky eater, really liked this dish. I live in very rural Maine and the nearest Indian restaurant is 100 miles away, so I've taken to cooking Indian food at home. It was a bit too spicy for my sister and brother in law's tastes, so if you're looking for a mild dish, cut back on the chilli pepper( I use Nirav brand Reshampatti Chilli Powder. Like others I doctored it a bit using more yogurt and heavy cream which I pureed with almonds to make a thickener for the sauce rather than cornstarch. An Indian friend's mom told me that's how she thickens sauces, using almonds or cashews pureed in the blender with yogurt and heavy cream. I also added about 4 tablespoons of brown sugar to cut the acid of the tomato puree saves on the late night acid reflux.  I'm betting the left overs will be even better as everything merges overnight. Thanks for a great recipe.

Awesome recipe.  VERY close to our local Indian restaurant version. I added some unsalted cashews to the sauce as it simmered to mimic other versions I've had. This one is definitely going into regular rotation.

Oh, my goodness, yes! It tastes just like the dish I had with my fiance at a truly Indian restaurant. We added more masala than the recipe called for to get the flavor right, and it is better if you put the sauce in the blender to smooth out the onions. Best dish I've ever made.

I didn't find any garam masala, so I just used about a teaspoon of curry and a pinch of cumin.
Also, I added fresh ginger and fresh garlic instead of ginger&garlic paste.

My boyfriend and I liked it very much and I'll most certainly cook it on a regular basis from now on :)

Tasted odd... almost like a burnt/bitter taste and had a sandy texture. 
Too many spices was probably the problem.

My whole family liked it. I Loved it. I was so proud to have prepared such a good Indian dish for my family. I might double the amount of Garam masala, just to give it more of a kick. This recipe is a keeper, and I will be making it again soon! Best recipe (Hands Down) that I have made in a while. Thanks very much for submitting this recipe.

This Butter Chicken turned out very badly. It tasted more like a tomato sauce. The sour cream didn't blend well. And it wasn't thick enough. There's another recipe on the site call "Easy Indian Butter Chicken" that tastes great when I make it.

This recipe is so good! Our kids would eat it every night if they could! I don't bother with two pans. I just brown the chicken with the dry spices first then throw in the rest of the ingredients. I also use vegetable oil instead of peanut oil and fresh ginger and garlic instead of the paste. It's easy and comes out great! We serve this with paratha that we buy frozen at our nearby Indian Grocery store. Add a salad and it is a wonderful meal!

Wow - this is so flavorful and true comfort food.  I added extra cayenne pepper and the heat was just perfect.  So quick to make and it tasted as if it had simmered for a long time.  I will definitely make this again.

I eat East Indian cuisine on almost a daily basis. I have tried many recipes online and often find that they are lacking in flavour and that they do not taste authentic. This recipe however... It is nothing short of phenomenal. I did not use the cornstarch (I don't think that cornstarch is a traditional ingredient), once the sauce cooked down I thought it had a very nice consistency so I let it be. I would highly recommend this recipe to anyone!

This recipe is very easy to make and delicious! I added 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper (because we love our Indian food to be very hot!), 1 tsp of grounded coriander, and doubled the amount of ginger garlic. I'll make this again, undoubtedly!

I doubled the amount of ginger garlic paste, added cumin and replaced 1/4 cup of the half and half with heavy cream. I didn't need the cornstarch and didn't add any ground nuts because my husband is allergic. I also added 1/4 tsp of ground fenugreek seeds thanks to a suggestion here. It was fabulous!!

Delicious! Butter chicken is one of my favorite Indian dishes and I love its creaminess and full flavor.
I've made this recipe twice, with a few small tweaks, and have loved it both times. I use fresh ginger and 1 clove of garlic (grated) instead of the pre-made paste, though if you're in a bind you can also use ginger and garlic powder instead. The flavors won't be as deep, but it works. Also, instead of yogurt and half and half I have used 1 cup of heavy whipping cream, which adds enough thickness to the sauce that it doesn't need cornstarch. I haven't tried many versions of Butter Chicken, but this is a recipe I believe I will come back to over and over again.

I was SO surprised I was able to make this. I took some of the suggestions from others. It was good, but I wanted it to be little creamier and more flavorful. I'm sure the second time I make it, it'll be perfect.

Recipe turned out closer to Chicken Tikka than butter chicken.  There is something missing, I can't determine what, but I found the recipe to be more tomatoy/acidic, than the butter chicken I have had in restaurants.

My girlfriend liked it, though.

Awesome recipe, easy and quick! I wanted a healthier version of butter chicken, & this one came up in Google.  The only changes I made were no butter added, and I didn't have yoghurt, so used Lite Cream instead. Was a total hit with the family, so recommend it!

Superb! My hubby thought it was the best and my 17 month old ate a ton of chicken. I didn't have shallots so just omitted. I didn't have half-and-half so just used my 1% milk and that turned out fine. I didn't know what garam masala was but there is a recipe for it called Easy Garam Masala here on AllRecipes. I didn't have the coriander, cardamom, or cloves but it seemed perfectly fine without. I will have to stock up my spice pantry more. I also didn't have peanut oil so I just used canola.
I had it with rice and naan (also found recipe for that here)

There is a restaurant near us that makes the most amazing butter chicken ever! This is pretty close, which is saying a lot considering I've rarely made Indian food. I used some of the suggestions and used ground cashews instead of cornstarch. I think they added an ice flavor. I also added coriander, and I added a pinch of sugar because the butter chicken I like is kind of sweet. I think I will add a little more sugar next time. It also wasn't spicy enough for our liking, so next time I will add more cayenne. We served it over coconut rice which complemented it quite well. Overall a very good recipe and easy!

So good! the closest to a restaurant curry I have ever had at home! It was a big hit at a friends dinner party last night. I used half of the sauce for a veggie version and just added some chick peas.

Spectacular, everyone loved it.  Doubled the recipe though and used a can of tomato paste and cup of tomato puree. Worked out well because I didn't have to use the corn starch.  Will definitely make it again!!  If you are a beer drinker, Southern Tier IPA pairs with this meal unbelieveably well.  My wife says I should make it when ever company comes for supper.

I have made this several times and we all love it.  I substituted half of the half-and-half for coconut milk and used 2 large onions, 1/2 cup of broccoli florets and 1/2 cup of thinly sliced carrots.  I have used cubed pork, cubed chicken breasts & cubed chicken thighs and all work very well.  I used canola oil because I didn't have peanut oil.  We make this about once a week since I first found this recipe.

I've made this twice now and everyone has really liked it.  I did thin the sauce with some milk.  The "prep time" being listed at 10 minutes is ludicrous--it takes 10 minutes to gather the ingredients from the pantry and frig!

Fantastic recipe- I added a can of condensed milk at the end (perfect). I had to call a friend to tell her it is better than the Indian place we eat at. Living in Germany limits good curry places to eat. this is the best curry recipe and not difficult to make

Phenomenal! After many years of eating this dish at various restaurants, this was the first recipe I attempted on my own. With a few adjustments, this ranked up there with the best restaurant-made Chicken Makhani I've had. I substituted curry for the garam masala and increased to 1 1/2 teaspoons. And instead of chili powder and cumin I substituted a purchased spice mix labeled "masala for butter chicken," and cut out the cayenne pepper. I also added a dash of cardamom and just a pinch of fenugreek to the sauce. Finally, instead of the cornstarch/water mixture to thicken, I used 1/4 cup of ground cashews. Thanks you, Mitchman21! I'm adding this one to my repertoire!

This dish was very good and the instructions were excellent. The only thing that was different from the best chicken makhani I have ever had was that this dish has a bit too much spiciness and slightly less sweeter then the perfect dish. I would recommend letting the chicken simmer longer in the sauce at the very end so that it can soak into the chicken. Overall this dish was delicious and when served with some naan and rice it equals the perfect dinner.

I LOVE IT!  Made few changes, sub 1\2 1\2 with coconut milk, made own garlic/ginger paste of equal amount and used fresh coriander leaves and threw in some cashew nuts.   Taste so great and this is a definite keeper

DELICIOUS!!! I made this in my tiny apt kitchen at college for my three guy neighbors and it was a huge hit. As an avid fan of indian food I've tried many recipes but I did like this one the best. I didn't have peanut oil so i used vegetable oil with a little bit of peanut butter. Doubled the onion, used an extra TBS of butter and of lemon juice, double the rest of the spices except for chili powder and cayenne, and added coriander per other reviewers.  Used a bit extra yogurt as well, and ground up cashews and water instead of cornstarch, then threw in some extra cashews for good measure. Made my own garlic/ginger "paste" which ended up more as diced garlic and ginger.... And used about 1.5 lbs of chicken breast instead. SO YUMMY. My kitchen still smells delicious the next morning, wish I had made more for leftovers but everyone gobbled it up!! Needed a bit more salt despite what some others said, but otherwise have no complaints. Next time will double the cayenne and chili powder as well for more kick. Served with rice, but next time will make sure to make my homemade naan which didnt have time for last night. Give this recipe a try!

I am told that tomato paste is the key but I used just a can of crushed/pureed tomatoes. The sourness added by the yogurt was a bit strong for my liking so next time I'll use more heavy cream and less yogurt. I will also use half chicken breast and half chicken thighs.

I followed the recipe exactly (except for the garlic ginger paste, couldn't find it at the store and made my own) and it was actually kind of bland. The spices were good, the recipe just didn't call for enough of them so I doubled most of them. Otherwise, a very tasty dish. My husband absolutely raved about it...finally, something new to add to the rotation!

We really enjoyed this dish. 
I was missing a number of ingredients and had to make several substitutions: I used coconut milk instead of half and half, sour cream instead of yogurt, 1 ts peanut butter because I had no peanut oil, and about 3/4 a can of tom. paste with 1-2 cups of water instead of tom. puree. I also put the onion, ginger, and garlic all in the food processor and tripled the spices. Surprisingly, with all those substitutions it was still delicious. I'm excited to try it as the recipe details next time!

My husband and I loved this recipe! Will make it again and again! I served it over jasmine rice, with a piece of naan bread on the side. Yummmm! I like the idea of using crushed raw cashews to thicken the dish rather than cornstarch - I will try that next time. I also took the advice of another reviewer and added 1 tsp. of coriander.

Delicious! I haven't made this in awhile, but thinking of it right now is making me drool.. I do use cashew paste instead of cornstarch, and coconut milk instead of half-and-half though.. otherwise this recipe is spot-on perfect! Uber-yum.

So great! Makes indian food accessible to those who haven't cooked it before. I agree with other that this needs coriander in it though.

Delicious!!!  I did what a pevious member suggested and omitted the cornstarch for thickening. I used 1/4c. ground cashews instead.  I also used boneless skinless chicken breast to cut back on the fat content.

This was nothing like butter chicken I get at local restaurants. I followed the recipe exactly and was quite disappointed. It was flavorful, but it did not taste like butter chicken at all and was not very tasty. My boyfriend, who is normally a big eater, only ate half of his portion, because he didn't care for it. My search for a decent butter chicken recipe continues...

This dish turned out delicious! I made several changes though: Instead of using ginger garlic paste I just used fresh chopped of each and in lieu of half & half, I used low fat coconut milk. It didn't turn out as rich, but it still tasted amazing (and saved a lot of calories!)

This was an amazing recipe! My husband is in love with it! We doubled the spices because we love the kick. I used the ground cashews instead of cornstarch and that was perfect, didn't need to add water. We had zucchini as a side. It was wonderful!

I adjusted the seasoning to my own taste (added more cayenne) and availability of ingredients at my house on the day of preparation (used ground ginger, skipped the yogurt, used lime juice instead of lemon). I also added more of my homemade garam masala than called for, skipped the extra cumin and added 1/2 tsp of fenugreek to the recipe. I didn't add cornstarch because I liked the consistency of the sauce without it.

Not my favorite flavor combination, but the people I cooked it for liked it.  I used 1.5x the sauce ingredients because I added some additional veggies.  I also simplified it to a one-dish meal.  Saute together the shallot, onion, and some diced carrots until the onion is softened.  Meanwhile, chop 1 lb chicken breast into bite-sized pieces.  Then add all the spices (I added some coriander, too)--including the garam masala and cayenne pepper that the recipe indicates are for the chicken.  Cook 1 minutes, until spices are fragrant, then add in the raw chicken, yogurt (I used fat free), tomato puree, and half-and-half (again, fat free).  At this point, I also added diced potatoes (about 4) and some chopped cauliflower (maybe 1.5 c).  Simmer everything for 20 minutes, or until chicken is cooked and potatoes are tender.  Then I added about 1/2 c. ground cashews, as well as 2 Tbl. cornstarch mixed with 1/4 c. water and simmered another minute until thickened.  Voila--one pot to clean.

If you want a thinner sauce you can always take some out and put it into the blender or put all of the sauce into the blender before you mix in the chicken. I ended up addeding about 2 tablespoons of ketchup to balence the flavors.

My fiance isn't a fan of Indian food, but he did love this though he found it a bit too spicy for his taste. I loved this! I made my own ginger-garlic paste by pulsing equals amounts of both in a food processor until it formed a paste. As per another review I used 1/4 cup of heavy cream and ground unsalted cashews in place of the half & half and cornstarch. I may try adding cumin, ground coriander or ground fenugreek seeds next time as I've seen it mentioned in other reviews as making the dish more authentic. I used chicken breasts instead of thighs for ease of preparation. This is a great dish for those who have never tried Indian cuisine as it is quite mild. Heat level can easily be adjusted. Served it over rice. Will be making this again very soon!

We just had this with paneer (Indian cheese cubes) instead of chicken, and it was great!  My wife and I love chicken makhani, but we have been trying to eat less meat (hard to say this is a particularly healthy way to do it, but it really satisfies a craving).  To our utter amazement, our two girls (5 and 3 years old) cleaned and plates and both asked for seconds.    Based on some other reviews, other recipes, and what I had available, I made the following adjustments.  I added about 1 tsp of dried fenugreek leaves (kasoori methi - found at our local Indian grocery).  Also I didn't have yogurt, or half & half, so I used a little less than 1 cup of heavy cream.  We didn't have a bay leaf, so I omitted that.  We were short on the chili powder, so I split a serrano chili in half lengthwise and put that in the sauce to stew for a bit too (the heat can always be adjusted with cayenne too).  I didn't think the cornstarch thickening would be necessary, and it wasn't.  Oh, and I used canola oil instead of peanut oil.  I also garnished with cilantro at the end, which really added a nice bright herbiness that we liked a lot.  Finally, I used paneer that I had cubed and then browned in canola oil and ghee (clarified butter) and then put in the sauce to simmer for a bit before serving.  In the future, I think we will try with yogurt and/or half & half just to lighten it a little.  Great recipe - very much like the dish we love at our favorite local Indian restaurant!  Thanks

We ended up substituting sour cream for the yogurt just because that was what we had in the fridge.  This was very good, with some garlic naan, a recipe you can also find on allrecipes!

Very good, authentic recipe.  I made a cashew paste with cashews and whipping cream (thick paste) in the food processor.  You only need a couple of tablespoons but it makes a huge difference.  Coming from an Indian background, I can say that the cooking does not use cornstarch, rather things like cashew paste or cream to thicken up sauces/curries.  Tastes great with freshly baked 'naan' (by Mic), also from this site.  Great recipe - thanks =)

This is my absolute FAVORITE Indian dish, but this one is just OK for me, but not great... Followed recipe tp a T, measuring EVERYTHING even, but end result was not what I had in mind.  Maybe because I set the bar at the Chicken Makhani at the Indian restaurant in our old neighborhood (Qazi's in Freemont for any Seattleites looking for AWESOME Indian lunch buffet!!!), which years later I will drive an hour to get it at least once or twice a year, I just can't forget it no matter how hard I try, but this version here didn't even come close... lacking the rich, smooth, "buttery" flavor that I expect from Chicken Makhani.  As far as Indian food in general, it was decent, but not good enough for us to have it 2 nights in a row and we are leftover lovers... I'll keep looking for 'The One,' but this isn't it.

This recipe was good but not quite as good as our favorite Indian Restaurant. I can't quite put my finger on what needed to be adjusted. I did add a few red pepper flakes to kick up the heat a little. Overall I will be making this again. I'll update with my adjustments.

Pretty good, but I've found a similar recipe here that I prefer although it takes longer. I may use it again if I was in a hurry but probably not.

An excellent delicious recipe as is, but I made a low carb variation for my boyfriend.  I didn't have any garlic ginger paste and substituted 3 cloves of garlic and one teaspoon of dried ginger.  Instead of half and half I used full cream and in place of the yogurt, mascarpone.  Yes, mascarpone.  It was on sale at the store and my boyfriend thought it could be used for something.  Well, it went into the butter chicken.  I also omitted the cornstarch to keep it low carb.  We served it over califlower and it was so very delicious.

Great recipe. I didn't have the garlic  ginger paste, but it worked fine. Also used Cream and sour cream instead of half and half and yoghurt because its what I had in the house. Still tastes great.   Added a tablespoon of sugar because it tasted a tiny bit bitter.

We loved this recipe. It is time consuming, but worth it. I used chicken breasts and also used the cashew paste as recommended. It definitely adds depth to the recipe unlike cornstarch. This one is going into the rotation!

This was okay but not worth the effort.  Like a few others I felt that it was a bit bitter.  If I made it again I would probably add more salt, some sugar and a bit more spice.  I think I will look for other recipes to satisfy my craving for indian food though.

Fantastic Recipe.  I followed some of the other reviewers suggestions, like ground cashews for the cornstarch.  Got rave reviews, will be making this again.

This recipe was excellent, just what I was looking for.  Like another reviewer, I used tomato paste instead of puree and cornstarch, and I skipped the water.

doubled the recipe for my large family. Even the kids liked it. I did follow some other reviewers suggestions and changed/added a couple ingredients to make it more authentic. Changed the cornstarch to ground cashews. Added fenugreek and also used fat free versions of dairy products instead of full fat. Will be making this one again!

Really good and worth the effort. I decided to brown the chicken first in the pan then remove. Then I blitzed the onions and a clove of garlic in my mini processor to make it smooth (I didn't want to deal with transferring hot liquid later) followed directions to add all the spices and liquid. I added chicken and simmered for 45 while the brown rice cooked. I added few pinches of spicy curry powder at the end b/c it seemed to need just a little kick. I will make again and again. All this hints here really made it wonderful. Love all your advice :)

Mmmm really good.  I added 1/2 tsp of coriander to the mix and also 1 tbsp of ground almonds in place of the cornstarch mixture as suggested.  Served over brown rice with pita crisps.

Yummm! I used ground almonds instead of cornstarch, and they definitely made for a richer, more complex flavor. I will make this again.

Based on suggestions, I added a bit of coriander, ground cashews instead of cornstarch and ground fenugreek seeds. I used milk instead of yogurt and half and half, as I didn't have those ingredients. It turned out absolutely fabulous. I will make this again and again. Thanks for this great and easy recipe.

I made this dish with what I had on hand:  tomatoe sauce in lieu of pureed tomatoes, skim milk not half and half, chicken breasts, not thighs.  I had no ginger garlic paste so I used a tablespoon each of chopped garlic and fresh ginger.  Served it with basmati rice and some green peas.  Took the leftovers to work the next day and it was even better.  Will definitely make again.

i made some changes based on what i had in the kitchen, previous reviews, and based on my preference. no peanut oil so used olive oil, added extra bay leaves, upped the yogurt to 1/2cup, 1 sm can of tomato puree, no cornstarch used ground cashews instead, added 1tbsp of ground cilantro, 1 tsp of coriander, 1tsp of garam masala, 1-2tsp of coconut milk powder and 1 tsp cayenne. i also marinaded the chicken in ~1tbsp of lemon juice, ~1/2cup of yogurt, 1tsp garam masala & 1cup of cayenne and poured everything in. i've also tried just using milk instead of half & half and it still tastes good but not as rich. healthier alternative when my clothes are not as forgiving!

I prepared this recipe for a party of ten. Some of which had never had this type of dish before. I have not heard the end of the rave reviews since. I also have a constant request for more fro mthe people that attended. Thank you for the recipe, it is a huge success, and made me look great in from of my friends.

I've only had Indian Butter Chicken once in my life, so I can't say how well this compares with what you'd get in a resturant, but I can say that this recipe tasted wonderful!  My only sub was that I didn't want to buy a jar of garam masala only to find out no one else in my house would eat something with it in it, so I used the "easy garam masala" recipe here on AllRecipes to make my own out of the ground spices I already had in my cupboard.  With fresh roasted/ground, it would probably have been even better!

Very good.  We all enjoyed it.  I didn't have lemon so I used buttermilk in it's place but followed the other ingredients and directions as stated with the exception of using the cornstarch and water, which I used the crushed cashews instead.  It was excellent.

This recipe was just o.k. I mean don't get me wrong, it was very flovorable. I guess I just expected more....You can compare it to be an Indian version of Mexican Mole. I love mole, so I know. It was on the greasy side as well. I will probably only make this in my house upon request, which will not be until like another 8 months or so.

I used chicken breast because I'm not dark meat fan. I didn't have any ginger garlic paste, so I minced 1/2 T. ginger and 1/2 T. garlic instead. I didn't have any lemon juice, but I did have lemonade, so I substituted 1/2 cup lemonade (more because it's only 10% lemon juice). You can toss in a handful of chopped cashews instead of cornstarch and water to thicken the sauce at the end. I didn't do this, but I might try it next time because I like cashews and I read about it in another review after having made it already. Apparently, this is how authentic Chicken Makhani is thickened. This was not nearly as spicy as I imagined it would be. I like it that way, but someone who wants it spicier might want to make adjustments. It was very tasty. There was a lot of more prep work involved than the recipe notes. I found it helpful to get everything ready and next to the stove beforehand. It was scrumptious and well worth the effort. This is a meal I would make again on the weekend or I would prepare the sauce in advance for a weeknight meal.

This recipe is not authentic and needs improvement. Buying the spices at an Indian food mart will help, but it is missing something. I wish I could tell you what...the Chicken Tikka Masala recipe on here is tons better, but that too isnt authetic.

This is a 10-star recipe!  Wonderful, multi-layered flavor.  I even used fat-free yogurt and was concerned it would affect the taste, but you would have never known.

Exceptional recipe. The flavors were balanced perfectly, was simple and took very little time.    I blended up some tomatoes that were on their way out to make the puree and diced a few extra to simmer.  I also added some diced carrot and green onion because I had them lying around.  There really isn't a need to use two pans--I threw the chicken in with the onion in the beginning and it stayed perfectly moist. I just used some of the simmering liquid at the end to incorporate the corn starch to thicken.   The base flavor and technique has a world of possibilities. This is one of my new favorite go-to recipes.

This recipe is a great BASE but I made some changes . The first is I marinaded the chicken overnight in chicken tikka seasoning (found at all Indian stores) this added A LOT of great flavour to the dish. I also added 3/4 tsp of dried corriander, 3/4 tsp turmeric and a pinch of fenugreek. And as other suggested I also added 1/4 cup ground cashews. The end result was fabulous I wont be going out to have butter chicken anymore!

This was great! I used my tribest personal blender to a) make ginger/garlic paste b) grind almonds to thicken and c)puree half the sauce.    I had to make a few adjustments due to ingredients on hand.  In place of cream, I used a small (5.5oz) can of condensed milk and upped the yogurt to 1/2 cup greek yogurt.  I also used a can of petite diced tomato in place of puree.  And 1 large vidalia onion.  Based on another reviewer's suggestion, I added ground coriander with the other spices.  I also used some  maharajah curry powder in addition to the garam masala.  It was the best indian dish I've ever made.   I will definitely make this again.  I may try a combination of breast and thigh.

This was unbelievable!  My whole family loved it.  I didn't have a shallot and so added a little more white onion.  Also, I didn't have ginger garlic paste so I put purred garlic and fresh ginger together and added that.  One last thing, per some reviews, I put in heavy cream instead of half and half.  It worked out fabulously!

Fantastic! I improvised the garlic/ginger paste by making it fresh on the fly, and added more onion since I'd forgotten to buy shallots, but turned out great. I'll try adding coriander, some golden raisins, and chopped nuts next time as well. Big thumbs up!

One Word. DELICIOUS. Fabulous recipe. I never have to thicken mine I prefer the consistency it has already. Followed advice and used equal parts garlic and ginger in a small food processor for the paste. We eat it with basmati rice and garlic naan.

This recipe was fantastic! It was easy to make and I agree with someone else's rating that it is a great dish to introduce someone to Indian food. I made the recipe as is except for the ginger-garlic paste. I took minced garlic and mashed it together with ground ginger which worked just fine.

We loved this more the second time I made it and I did ot have ginger nor the whole amount of cream. I used lemon pepper instead of lemon.
I used a jarred tomato sauce for pasta which had some basil in it.....I don't think any of these changes comprimised the taste though. It was excellent.

My family liked this recipe but we didn't 'love' it. I was hoping for restaurant quality as our local Indian restaurant just changed owners and is no longer very good :( I will make this again but it won't become a staple.

My family and I really enjoyed this dish-even my picky 3 and 4 year olds. I did omit the cornstarch for ground cashews and found it not only served to thicken the sauce but added the perfect amount of sweetness (just a touch)
I've made this a few times now and have tweaked the spices each time to adjust to my guests. Everyone has loved it!

I loved this. However, I did change some things as I didn't have them on hand. I also didn't waste time measuring spices. Good Golly I used ALOT of spices. I added cinnamon, tumeric, corriander, as well as those recommended. I used sour cream instead of yogurt because that is what I had. I also used evaporated milk to thin the sauce instead of half and half. It was soooo good. I served it over rice. My very picky kid's also seemed impressed. Especially when I told them that it was a recipe from India. My 4 year old son said, "how did you get it here". Funny. I think that we have decided to have an international food night every week. Anyhow, this was excellent. Oh yeah, I also added raisins to mine. Just adds a touch of sweetness.

This chicken was delicious. I never thicken my mexican or indian recipes with cornstarch so I thickened this one with ground almonds. The only thing I would leave out next time is the lemon juice.The yogurt and tomato puree are tangy enough. Thank you so much for the recipe I will make it often.

Perfect! We love it every time. I do use the ground cashews instead of the cornstarch. Sometimes I add some frozen peas to the sauce for some extra color texture! So good! Yum!

A new favorite of ours.  The first time I made this I didn't have tomato sauce so I used paste and watered it down...it worked!  I now use just tomato sauce and it's easier than watering down the paste.  It smells so good in the house while making this.  My hubby absolutely loves it and it tastes great with naan bread too.  What a great and quick meal.

Absolutely delish. I used a lot of the recommendations plus ad-libbed a little: used crushed (salted) cashews instead of corn starch, made my own garam masala ("easy garam masala" from this site), pureed equal parts garlic and ginger in a blender to make garlic/ginger paste.  Have made it several times now and loved it every time.

Gather your ingredients before you start, even cutting your chicken. It goes much faster than you think! Wow, made my nose run with all of the chili and cayenne. For a wedding reception I cut those to 3/4 of recipe. A keeper! But, must be served with rice to sop up the sauce

We love this recipe. It's great when you have an indian food craving. I substitute milk for the half and half and it still comes out great. And I even used low fat yogurt and low fat milk to reduce the calories and it was still yummy, just not as creamy. It's an awesome dish.

This was my first attempt to make an Indian dish. My husband said it was great! I used boneless, skinless chicken breast and fat free half and half. Served with basmati rice and Indian Naan II from this site. Leftovers where yummy!

This was a good recipe but I had to add alot more garam masala (I lost track of how much I added.  Maybe ~3-4 tsp) as other reviewers suggested to get the flavor I like.  I also added 1 tsp coriander and used heavy cream instead of half and half. I found that a little (1/2 tsp) of sugar helped cut down on the tomato-ey flavor of the sauce.  My husband and 3 kids (5, 3, &1.5 yo) loved it.  It is a great starting recipe and with a few changes was a hit with our family.

Thia was an absolute hit at dinner yesterday! I will have to tell you I made a few changes because of what I had available to me and what other users changed. To start, I used one big yellow onion instead of the white onion & shallot combo. I used 3 Tbs of butter, 2 1/2 ts. lemon juice, 3 Tbs of freshly grated ginger plus pre-chopped garlic to make up the paste. I also used a lot more of Garam Masala....maybe 4-5 ts. to suite taste and 1 ts. ground coriander. I used 1/4 c. heavy cream instead of half & half and if I had fenugreek I would have put it in also as noted by another user. 

I marinated the chicken with sherry for an hour and when cooking it, I let it cook so that I it browned enough to give the chicken a slight grilled flavor. I also did not need to add the water & cornstarch because the sauce came out to my desired thickness without it. I will note that had I had ground cashews as noted by another user, I would have put some in the recipe.

All in all, my mouth was bursting with flavor! It was my best dish yet when it comes to flavor. Definitely restaurant potential. Thanks!

Yummy!  I used the Greek style strained yogurt instead of plain yogurt.  It made the sauce thicker, creamier and tangier. For my taste it needed a bit more garlic.

This was a fantastic recipe.  I didn't have a few of the ingredients, so I substituted as follows: - No-fat vanilla yogurt for the plain yogurt - 2% milk for the half-and-half - Ginger powder and minced garlic for the ginger/garlic paste Even with these substitutions, it was really great! My 10-year-old is a picky eater, so I just left out a few pieces of chicken for him before I mixed the chicken and sauce. Everyone was happy and full!

This was fantastic and had a very authentic flavor. Even my husband's discriminating taste buds loved this one. I did take the advice of one reviewer and used about 1/4 cup ground cashews instead of cornstarch and it made all the difference. I also used heavy cream instead of half & half.  Make extra because this makes great left overs!

I didn't need the cornstarch, the sauce thickened up just fine on its own. I actually added more cayenne pepper, because I thought the sauce was pretty bland upon first tasting it. About a teaspoon of salt and 1/4 tsp more cayenne than the recipe calls for fixed that. I used the garlic ginger paste and garam masala recipes on this site. Awesome recipe overall. We had it with jasmine rice and naan bread, and it made a fantastic dinner.

We absolutely loved this. I couldn't believe how quickly this came together. I got home from work at 6.30 and we were eating by 7.30. I used tomato sauce instead of the puree and as I didn't have any garlic ginger paste, I mixed some ginger powder with some crushed garlic. My husband can't handle very spicy food and the amount of spice in this was just right for him. Thank you, Mitch, for a meal he really loved.

This recipe was pretty good. I live at least 3 hours away from the nearest Indian restaurant, and goodness knows if they're any good...I'm used to really great Indian restaurants in the Bay Area and now I'm 1200 miles away. This recipe wasn't as good as the butter chicken at my favorite restaurants, but it was still a nice treat. I took the advice to use cashews as a thickener. It was easy to grind up the cashews in a ziploc bag by passing a rolling pin over it a few times. I used this same method to make garlic-ginger paste, which I could not find. I used half garlic and half ginger. I might make this again, but I do like the chicken tikka masala on this website better.

Tried many butter chicken recipes - found this one to be a winner, but only when prepared in concert with the comments from reviewers ie. "ground cashews to thicken sauce, increase garlic/ginger" etc. ALL RECIPES, Sunshine Coast - Australia thanks you !

Delicious! This is one of our favorite Indian recipes. I personally like a lot of sauce so I usually make almost double for that amount of chicken.

My husband and I are real Indian food conniseurs (sp?) and we really liked this recipe!  We did add more masala than the recipe called for along with more chilli powder, we like it spicey!  I also added the ground cashews for thickening as was suggested.  This was great and considering we can't find an Indian place this side of Texas we'll be cooking it again!

We are trying to get more veggies in so I added 3/4 cup each of chopped carrots and celery. Added a pkg of chopped spinach as well. Would do 1/2 the Garam Masala next time and add 2 tlbsp curry powder as well because we like it spicier.  Serving this with shredded coconut, oven-toasted almond slivers and raisins over brown rice.  Also made some sour cream cucumber salad.

this recipe is phenomenal! I did tweak it a little bit. As i do with most of my recipes!! I cooked the chicken as directed first except w/out the sauce, set it aside and then prepared the sauce. Then I added the chicken in the sauce and cooked it a little longer. I needed need the corn starch but for people that like the sauce thick, go for it. The chicken is delicious! I served it with basmati rice. Thank you so much for the recipe!

I thought I would rate this since I have made it several times and will be making it again tonight...I LOVE butter chicken from my favorite Indian restaurant, Cedars, in Seattle...this comes pretty close if you tweek it a little...I leave out the shallot, lemon juice and bay leaf...I add 1 tsp fenugreek leaves, 1/4 tsp salt, 1 TBS white sugar and 1 TBS brown sugar...instead of the tomato puree I just use tomato sauce...pure heaven on a spoon!...I have used ground cashews before, but I don't think it makes it that much better...love it!

this was very good! my husband loves ordering this dish at indian restuarants. he thought it tasted pretty close to what he has when we eat out. i only put a little bit of butter to give it some flavor and cut down on the oil to make it healthier. also, i added the ground cashews instead of the cornstarch.

This was a great recipe.  Even my picky little brother liked it. :) A word of caution though, garam masala has a lot of black pepper in it, so go easy on it and the cayenne until you've tasted the sauce to see if you like it hotter.

Very tasty!  I used breasts instead of thighs because that's just what I happened to have on hand.  I couldn't find ginger garlic paste, so I used one minced clove of garlic & approximately 1 tsp of chopped ginger.  I used milk instead of the half & half for health purposes - still turned out great.  It was excellent & well received by hubby too.  I'll definitely make this again.

This recipe was delicious - but not as I remember butter chicken from my favourite Indian restaurant.  It seemed more like a chicken tikka massala.  It seemed strange to be adding so much tomato puree - which is tomato paste to me.  I added more cumin, chili powder and salt and I seasoned the chicken before I cooked it.  My husband thought it was great though.

I think this dish is OKAY... I REALLY love butter chicken but it doesn't taste like the one you get in restaurants.  I followed the recipe almost exactly, except that I added 4 tbsp butter to the sauce (as suggested by another member).  The sauce tastes a little sour (could be from the yogurt, which also tends to curdle).  I added more about another teaspoon of garam masala, a tsp and a half of honey, and some fresh chopped coriander.  it tasted a little better, but still, not butter chicken.

I made this last night and it was my first time with Indian food except a curry here and there and it turned out fantastic!  My boyfriend, who is a picky eater, loved it! I may tweak the spices next time to see what happens, but as-is this is a great and easy recipe.  THANKS!!!

Pretty good but have to agree with others that it tastes like something is missing or not quite like that of resturants.  I think that maybe this is just because the chicken is not cooked in a tandoor oven and lacks the slight 'smoky' taste that butter chicken has at resturants.   If this is correct, maybe a couple of drops of 'liquid smoke' might add a little something? I am unable to try this as I have searched far & wide where I live and cant find this product but am sure that I remember my dad using this when I was younger (not in curry - mainly on ribs I think!)...would anyone else try this?

This was so good.  My husband, who is the pickiest eater in the entire world LOVED this recipe.  He told me I could make for him anytime.  I also made Chickpea Curry from this site and raita from this site.

Oh, I forgot, I made a couple of small changes- used fresh minced ginger and mince garlic and mixed tomato paste (all I had) with chicken stock to equal 1 cup.

For no particular reason, Indian cuisine has never passed my lips, which is why I was so intrigued by this recipe. Again, as some other recipes I've reviewed, I've nothing to compare this to, therefore, I'm not rating this on its authenticity, but rather on taste alone. I found this dish to be extremely quick and easy to put together. The flavors were not only different, but remarkably delicious. Due to peanut allergies, I used evoo and I made my own garlic/ginger paste. Mitch, this was so darn good and I thank you for giving me the opportunity to "explore the unknown"!

This recipe was excellent. We've eaten at many Indian resturant and it is quite expensive. This recipe did the trick without having to spend an arm or a leg. On thing though is that i added some curry powder to make it more spicy and some sugar to cut through the tomato.
I will definately be making it again.

Great Recipe! After adding the tomato sauce to the onions, I actually pureed the mixture in the blender to give the gravy a smooth consistency. Also used heavy creme, rather than half-and-half.Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.

I LOVE this recipe. That said, I have to make some adjustments to suit my taste. I put much more garam masala than called for (but I used Spice Islands brand, which is probably more mild than an authentic Indian brand). I used sour cream because I didn't have any yogurt. I also used evaporated milk instead of half and half. I used 1 1/2 cans of tomato sauce as well. I didn't need to thicken since I used evaporated milk. So great with basmati rice and naan. This is probably way Americanized- but different than a lot of other recipes and so good.

This is a decent indian recipie for non-indians attempting indian delicacies (myself included).  This is a dish different from the western norm and I would suggest it to anyone wishing to adventure into indian tastes.  I too, like other reviewers found it 'lacked something' - I increased the spice by half, adding a couple of spoons of sugar helped and a dash of worcestershire (sounds odd, but it made a big improvement).  I had to substitue fresh garlic and ginger and crushed tomatoes and also fried some peanuts in canola to get that peanut oil taste. Hope you enjoy it as we did!

This is a keeper!! My husband and I and 2 out of my 4 children loved it. (There's no pleasing everyone all the time at this house)Made a few substitions just because of lack of ingriedients. Used fresh ginger and garlic put through my garlic press, couldn't find the paste at my store. Also used vanilla yogurt instead of plain. Added 1 tsp of sugar. Used fat free half and half. I cooked my sauce slightly longer than 10 minutes and didn't need to thicken it. Thanks for sharing this one!! Next time I will double the whole recipe!!

I make this recipe almost 2 times a month now.  FANTASTIC...this is my husband's favourite dish and he thinks it tastes as good as he gets in a restaurant.  Very easy to follow and no ingredients you cant find in a regular grocery store.

I enjoyed this recipe, but my search for the butter chicken I get in restuarants continues.  The texture and colour were good, but the flavour was missing a little something.  However, if you have never tried this type of chicken before, I don't want to stop you.  It is good.  I am just looking for something specific because, like Mitch, this is one of my favourite types of chicken. My guests were tremendously impressed with the smell and look of it.  I served it over quinoa, the "super-grain," instead of the usual basmati rice.

Yummy!  My picky children and even pickier father all gobbled this up!  To make it a little easier, I used one of those cooked chickens from our deli department (the hotwing flavor)~ it gave the end result a terrific KICK and cut out a huge part of the process.  I also threw in 1/2 cup sour cream at the end to give it a creamier texture.

As you can see im a Chef in the Royal Australian Air Force I increased the ingredients with minor changes to amounts for a few of them for 100 people and used it for a curry luncheon, function at the Officers Mess at RAAF Base Richmond and got great responses from the people that ate the dish, I also tried it myself and loved it. Thankyou Mike

Very good and *nearly* authentic.  Good flavour.  I always add coconut milk to this recipe to cut the sharp tangy flavour out.  I use honey flavoured yogurt as well.  I add more cayenne as well.  Something is missing though.  I will try marinating the chicken and using ghee.

This was incredibly good.  I used olive oil instead of peanut oil, and omitted the shallot and 1/4 white onion and just chopped a medium onion. I grated 1/2T fresh ginger and pressed 1/2T fresh garlic for the ginger garlic paste. In place of the cornstarch and water, I soaked 1/4C unsalted, roasted cashews in ~1/4C boiling water for 15 minutes, crushed them and added them in step 3. And I used 1/4t ground fenugreek seeds, as another reviewer suggested.  This recipe is a favourite.  Thanks, Mitch!

Very good recipe.  I sauteed chicken breasts chucks with half of a tablespoon of garlic ginger paste, salt and pepper until browned then slow simmered it with the sauce.  I also omitted the cornstarch because the sauce was plenty thick without it.  I will definitely make this again.

My daughter and I recently discovered how wonderful Indian food is and we were very excited to try this recipe. I'm not sure what I did wrong, but the yogurt curdled in the sauce. This recipe didn't have the flavor I was anticipating, but was decent nonetheless. Thanks for sharing.

This was delicious!!  I found a spicy garlic and ginger paste in the Indian section of my grocery store and that added some additional spice.  I was also generous with the cayenne pepper and I used a whole onion along with the shallot.  I used chicken breast instead of thigh and I added some of the spicy garlic ginger paste to the chicken while I cooked it with the garam and cayenne.  In the end it had a very nice kick to it.  I'm not a fan of thickeners and this recipe didn't need it at all so I did not use cornstarch.  This was the same if not better than the local restaurants.

Fabulous dish! Rich without being cloying, and utterly wonderful over cous cous.  Substituted olive oil for peanut (allergy concerns), and dusted the chicken before browning.

This is a lot like chicken tikki masala dishes I have had in local Indian restaurants. Too adjust the heat, I increase or reduce the amount of chili poweder. Nice and spicy dish - and it really hits the spot when you are craving Indian food! I serve it over regular minute rice or jasmine rice with Palak Paneer as a side and some warmed Naan.

Very delicious and everyone loved it.  I did not have shallots, peanut oil or lemons on hand.  I used one chopped onion, canola oil and a can of chopped tomatoes (instead of puree).  It came out great.  I went by our local Indian grocer and picked up some Naan bread and cilantro chutney which were perfect accompanies to this fabulous dish. MADE AGAIN ON 3/8/05 - Had all ingredients this time and DID NOT do the cornstarch.  Came out great.

Hrm. I've never had this made in a restaurant, so I can't compare, but what we ended up having was chicken in tomato soup with a cinnamon tinge to it. Maybe the secret is in the garam marsala - I made my own mixture from a recipe I found on another site. I used almost two pounds of boneless chicken breast, so I doubled the sauce recipe, but it was WAY too much, even though I used less half-and-half and more yogurt. I won't be making this one again.

Absolutely delicious. I really like using chicken thighs for recipes like this, they're much more tender than breasts. I serve this one over rice.

This was delicious. I will be making this again. Like everyone else, I just used fresh minced ginger and garlic instead of the paste. I add at least twice the cayenne pepper, and a little  more of all of the other spices, as I like food that bites me back! Served over whole grain rice along side whole wheat naan.

This recipe is wonderful.  The changes I made were based on what I had available.  For the sauce: I omitted the shallots and just used onion.  I replaced the ginger garlic paste with plain garlic.  I substituted sour cream for the yoghurt/half and half mixture, and crushed tomatoes for the tomatoe puree. I actually liked the texture the crushed tomatoes gave to the sauce.  I used a variety of chicken pieces (with skin and bones), browned them, and then added the sauce and simmered for a good 50-60 minutes.  The resulting flavour is outstanding without being overly spicy, and the chicken was very tender.  My husband loved this and I will definitely make this again for company.  A fantastic recipe!

My whole family loved this dish.  It was like the butter chiken you would get at an authentic Indian restaurant.  It's a keeper. Thank you for sharing this recipie with us.

I followed one of the suggestion by adding ground cashews and the recipe came out excellent. Just like what i have in the restaurants. Fabulous recipe and my husband loved it!

Wonderful recipe!  We will make it again--it is the best Indian style recipe we've found that doesn't need lots of involved and/or foreign techniques!  Delicious, even if not entirely restaurant style!  Thanks for a great dinner!

So flavorful without being in-your-face hot!  I am grateful to have an Indian dish I can cook at home.  Made it with carrot rice (on this web site), and they went WONDERFULLY together.  Give it a shot...it's not hard, and the chicken thighs are very inexpensive.

SO GOOD!  We loved it and it reheated fairly well the next day too (the sauce was thinner).

I think next time we'll add more cornstarch because I like thicker sauces.

It's all about the sauce!  The sauce was fantastic!  I suppose that if the chicken had simmered with the sauce for a while longer the spices from the sauce would have added to the chicken's flavor.  It wasn't quite as tasty as the Butter Chicken that I eat at my favorite Indian restaurant, but with a little experimentation with the recipe...maybe, just maybe...... Good recipe and great tasting sauce.

This was really good!!! I didn't have half and half so I used heavy cream and it was really good!!!! Better to error on the side of over spicing than under for Indian food, I have found.

I used cumin seeds adding at the beginning with onions and shallot.  I found the sauce  was thick enough without adding corn starch.  This was delicious!  My wife loved it.

Wow! Great flavor. Boyfriend loved this dish. Used fresh ginger and garlic instead of the garlic-ginger paste which made the dish taste really fresh. Got frozen garlic naan from TJs. Great dish.

An excellent dish! Very tasty, but I did lack a little something. I'll go with the other reviewers suggestions and add more garlic, ginger and coriander and use ground cashews instead of cornstarch the next time. Also the leftovers are delicious!

Disappointed didn't come out how i expected. Didn't taste like butter chicken to me. Too tomato tasting and not enough Indian flavor. I didn't like it with the thigh meat either.  My boyfriend didn't want seconds so that speaks volumes. He loves butter chicken I made this for him.

So this is very similar to another butter chicken recipe that I've created, so I wanted to try it. I also love to add potatoes and bell peppers to mine for that extra bit of flavor and fullness. It's a huge hit in my house!

I will definitely try this again, but with some changes - I added coriander and doubled the garlic, ginger, and masala per other reviews. I also added some unsalted peanuts and served it over curried rice. Overall, the spicing was superb but I think something sweet is missing to offset the tomato sauce and yogurt flavor. Maybe a teaspoon of sugar a dab of honey.

Try using coconut milk instead of half and half and omit corn starch. The coconut mike is much thicker and creamier adds a silky richness

This was my intro into Indian cuisine. Will be diving deeper, loved it. Had to make my own garam masala, local grocer didnt carry it. Had most of the spices on hand anyway. Will def be making this again. Might marinate chicken next time tho, was slightly bland but sauce was good.

This is an excellent base recipe that I was able to modify to make the perfect Makhani. Paired with a version of mint chutney also found on this site, it's out of this world! I would strongly recommend not using the cornstarch--it's entirely unnecessary. Also, if you par-grill the chicken, you won't be sorry! Thanks so much for sharing.

Made the recipe as is and really enjoyed it however it is a bit sweet for me. After reading some other reviews I plan to make some tweaks to the spices, garlic, etc. I love Indian food and I am always intimidated to make it at home but this was easy and delicious.

Made with a few adjustment. Used garlic with no ginger (my masala spice had ginger in it). Also cut the yogurt down a bit and cooked in a Instant Pot (after browning the meat) which makes the chicken super tender.!  Super yummy...will definitely make again and again.

Did this twice, and both times the sauce seemed to break after I added the yogurt. I've not done much with yogurt so I don't know if what happened is normal or if I should be doing something different.

I usually buy jarred Indian simmer sauces, but we’re now living abroad and can’t find a lot of my go to shortcuts. This recipe was a hit with the kids. Thanks for helping me make a familiar dinner in unfamiliar surroundings.

***DAIRY FREE MODIFICATIONS****  I marinated the chicken overnight in a bit of coconut milk yogurt, lime juice, cumin, and coriander. I cooked the chicken first with olive oil and then removed it from the skillet. I then chopped an onion and sautéed until translucent in leftover juice from chicken and 1-2 tbsp dairy free butter, added a rough approximation of 3tbsp of garlic and 3tbsp ginger, 1 tsp coriander, 1 tsp garam masala, 1 tsp cumin, 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper and 1 bay leaf and let that cook for approx 1 minute. Then added 1 cup puréed tomato, 1 cup coconut milk, 1/4 cup coconut milk yogurt and let that simmer for 2-3 minutes before adding chicken back in. I’m currently still cooking, but the sauce tastes so good I had to write a review! Planning on eating with basmati rice and garlic & herb naan ??

You can't top this recipe.  I followed the recipe with the exception of half and half.  Instead, I added butter to regular milk.  The end result was amazing.  Because I didn't want to eat rice again, I took a head of cauliflower, steamed it and added it to the sauce and chicken once everything was cooked.  I sopped up the remaining sauce on my plate with bread.  This recipe is a keeper.

Very good dish.  I doubled it and followed some of the other reviewers suggestions - used fresh garlic and ginger, ground cashews instead of corn starch,  added coriander and upped the cayenne to 2 tsp.  I also used Greek yogurt and the sauce didn't really need thickening to my eye, but the cashews added a nice flavor note.

I made it with coconut milk, and crushed tomatoes....phenomenal! And this comes from someone who strongly dislikes Indian cuisine. Thus, I had to make my own garam masala, to  cater  to my blander palate (I cant handle too much spice). Also the sauce was the exact right consistency without needing to add the cornstarch. Excellent! 
Next time, however, I might get more creative with the chicken and grill it our try a marinade for more flavor.

This was delicious.  I made a few adjustments.  I did not use half and half.  I replaced that with heavy cream and crushed up cashews.  My family likes our food spicy so I added more crushed chili powder.

absolutely love this receipe have made it several times. I always follow the reciepe to the T the first time I make it. I can really fault this recipe, the only tweak I make is adding 1 full teaspoon of cayenne but, then again it does say or to taste. It's slap your momma in the face good! Made a curry rice to go with it.

I altered the recipe when I made it.  I used tomato paste instead of puree and added a little water.  Because the paste  kept the dish thicker I didnot need cornstarch.  It made it much more flavorful.  I also substituted sour crem for yogurt and used fresh garlic and ginger instead of the paste.  Dish is excellent.

Made all the changes that were recommended by Yakuta, and it made all the difference.  

Find some powdered methi, use heavy whipping cream instead of half&half (I recommend using 1/2 cup or 1 cup, instead of Yakuta's 1/4 cup).  Use fresh ginger and garlic (about 5 cloves of garlic, and about 1 inch of ginger, peeled and minced).  If you have a food processor, that will dice up the cashews enough to sub out the corn starch.  This is truly restaurant grade Chicken Makhani once you get the mix right.

After reading some reviews, I made quite a few changes when it came to the spices in the recipe. One user suggested instead of garlic ginger paste, to use just garlic and ginger, but three times the amount called for in the recipe. They also suggested a little bit of coriander.  I love big flavors, so I was pretty heavy handed with the other spices, especially the cayenne. It turned out to be absolutely delicious!

So, so tasty!  I just started trying Indian food - what took me so long?  Easy, even if I didn't have everything, like tomato puree (used tomato paste and water),  plain yogurt (used sour cream) and half and half (used cream).  It's a quick meal that has spice with a bit of heat.  Will be making it again!

This is literally the best butter chicken. I took the advice of another commenter and added the 1/4c cashew... I crushed them into almost a flour. I also added the 1/4 tsp of Fenugreek seeds (crushed) and 1tsp coriander. I switched out the plain yogurt for  Plain (dairy free) coconut yogurt, and the half and half for Lactose Free milk. I also sautéed the chicken in the listed spices to brown the outsides but then added them to the sauce before it was cooked all the way through. I let the chicken cook in the simmering sauce for a couple hours. It was seriously delicious. I will be making this for a longgggg time!

I had to give this a 4 because I could not find ginger garlic paste after going to several stores.  I substituted red curry paste with great success.  Unfortunately I don’t know how much different the ginger garlic paste would have been.

I made several mistakes. First I browned the chicken and then put everything in a Crock Pot. I thought the sauce would cook down enough, but it didn't.
Tomorrow when  have left overs, I will be thickening it up. 
It couldn't ruin the favors, though

Great flavor but too much thickening.  I would reduce the cayenne to 1/8 tsp and increase the garlic.  I used coconut milk instead of half and half and next time I would omit the yogurt.

Excellent dish! We love Indian food and have eaten this dish while living in Asia. Followed recipe but did add a little more garlic and ginger. Also added ground cumin. It was delicious and will add it to our regularly eaten meals. Thank you for this recipe!

This was great! I used olive oil instead of peanut oil and used garlic powder and ground ginger instead of the paste because my grocery store didn't carry it. My 7yr old and my husband both liked it so that's a big win.

The only change I made was that I used grounded cashew nuts for thickener instead of cornstarch. My husband and teenage sons all loved it. My family loves Indian food.

I really wanted to like this, but the flavor was way off. We ended up throwing the whole dish out. Not sure what was missing but it was way too tangy for my taste.

Very good. We will definitely be making it again following the recipe to a T. Couldn't think of anything else that needed to be added or removed. Do season the sauce with salt to taste (as recommended) as it's a little sweet before any adjustments are made.

One note to other reviewers: adding cashews makes this dish no longer butter chicken. It makes it more like a mughlai chicken dish.

This recipe is terrific.  It was my first time making butter chicken and I was surprised how easy it was.  I followed a few suggestions from other reviewers which I think made it even better which is why I give it 4 stars vs 5.  The suggestions were to replace the corn starch with ground nuts.  I used almonds because that's what I had on  hand.  Another was to add a touch of ground Fenugreek.  Done.  Lastly I added fresh cilantro, which I threw in for the last 5 minutes of cooking.   It was a hit!

My daughter asked for butter chicken (we had a jar), but I decided to make it from scratch as I had tomatoes handy. I added some coriander as suggested and got thumbs up. Recipe is a keeper!

Oh my god, it was awesome! I was in a kitchen for a good hour instead of the 30 minutes announced in the recipe. But it was worth it. I didn't have any ginger garlic paste so I used 2 cloves of garlic and a piece of fresh ginger. I also used Greek yogurt for extra creaminess. ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC.

Peanut oil is hard to find here in Rio so I used canola oil instead and as substitute for the garlic ginger paste I used grated fresh garlic and ginger. Also used chicken breast. I browned the chicken first, saved it and added to the prepared sauce. Didn't had to add the cornstarch at the end as well cause the sauce was thick enough. Was so tender and tasty. Loved it!! I'm so gonna make this again and again and again...

I made this recipe several times now and it's always delicious. I use ground cashews as thickener as per one of the reviewers' advise. My picky eater husband, loves it and asks me to pack the left over for his lunch.

This recipe is a new favorite in our house. Butter chicken is my absolute favorite Indian dish, and I am thrilled I can make it at home! My husband actually *prefers* it over the restaurant (best compliment). I do use fresh garlic and ginger, and I use a cup of coconut milk in place of the half-and-half. I also add a teaspoon of Indian curry powder to the chicken. I am really interested to try marinating the chicken in the spices with some yogurt for several hours beforehand and to add ground cashews as a thickener rather than cornstarch (like reviewers have suggested).

In all fairness, having never been to India to try the real thing, my opinion shouldn't really count. That being said, this was the best recipe I have encountered for chicken makhani. I took other  reviewers advice about additional butter, not thickening with corn starch, and using fresh ginger. The over all flavor is outstanding and I will definitely make this dish, using this recipe, again.

I doubled the recipe and used chicken breasts rather than thighs.  I also used chives rather than shallots. We ate on it for 3 days. Tasty!

Awesome Indian butter chicken recipe! I made my own ginger garlic paste with minced garlic and ground ginger bc I didn't have time to get the "fresh" ingredients. I have to say it still turned out amazing! I live near an Indian neighborhood which is well known for their restaurants and this dish is very close to authentic Indian cuisine!!!

This was delicious and pretty easy to make too. Taking previous advice I tripled the garlic ginger paste quantity and added ground coriander to the sauce. I also increased the cayenne pepper because  I wanted it more spicy. It's really delicious! Not as spicy as I usually prefer but still really flavorful.

I made this with some of the suggestions from other posts. I added the coriander, cashews. I didn't have a shallot or heavy cream, so just used an entire onion and half and half. Wife and kids seemed to enjoy it. I liked it too. Not quite to the level of  the restaurants, but I'll make it again.

Amazing! 

I made some substitutions, not necessarily because I wanted to, more because I didn't have all of the ingredients on hand. 

Substituted the peanut oil for 1/2 the amount of coconut oil
Substituted the cream for milk
Substituted the plain yogurt for a small peach yogurt because I didn't have plain lol
Didn't have garam masala spice so I made my own (omitted cloves- not a fan)
Substituted the tomato puree for Marinara
Didn't have bay leaf
No lemon juice, used lemon pepper seasoning instead of lemon juice and pepper.
Might have put a little too much chilli powder but we like spicy so it worked! Added a tsp of red curry paste as well! Highly recommend making this, it was amazing and healthy!

I used chicken thighs that were on sale and left the bone in.  I started the thighs in the oven  to make a chicken wings then decided to go with this recipe.  I added the seasonings to the chicken in the oven and then when the chicken was done broke it up a little and added it to the sauce.  I didn't have any yogurt so I made some by adding fresh lime juice to some milk and letting it sit for 5 minutes.  It lasted three meals for me.  My 6 year old really liked it.

This was SO good.  Made exactly as written except put the pot in the oven for it all to roast for about 20 mins at the end.  My only reference for butter chicken is restaurants and this is nothing like it which means its probably authentic.  SO good

The family loves this dish every time I cook it.  I found a recipe online for the garam masala, bought all the spices and made a bunch to use later.

Excellent... I doubled everything as it was a lot of ingredients  for just one meal... only had 35% cream so did 1 Cup cream, 1 Cup milk... added a teaspoon of Ground Coriander as suggested by someone on here... used a can of tomatoes as I didn't have puree or paste and it is really good, did need the cornstarch at the end though. Used 4 garlic buds and a chunk of fresh ginger chopped together...  a keeper :)

Only change I made was instead of 1 cup half and half I did 1/2 cup 35% whipping cream and 1/2  cup half and half cream. Because of this I used less of the cornstarch mixture to thicken the sauce. Add a little at a time to gauge how thick you would like the sauce.

OMG, this is good....I always make extra sauce because it's THAT delicious over basmati.  I make my own Garam Masala and, per other reviewers, use ground cashews as a thickening agent.   I've also perfected a one-pot streamlined cooking method.   I cut up the chicken and marinate it overnight in GM plus salt, cayenne, and a good 2T of minced ginger/garlic.  The next afternoon, I carmelize the onion in a Dutch oven, toss the chicken and marinade on top and bake uncovered at 375 for 18 minutes.  Then I add a 15oz can of tomato sauce, 4T butter, lemon juice and spices, and cover and simmer at least ten minutes.  Stir Greek yogurt and half and half into the mixture and simmer another few minutes.   At this point, I usually turn off the heat, cover the Dutch oven and let it rest while I prepare the rice, naan and dessert.   Add ground cashews and bring to a boil before serving.  100% rave reviews from family and guests every time I make this!!

This was awesome! I omitted the shallot, used frozen diced onions, used 1 tbsp minced garlic and 1/2" minced fresh ginger rather than the paste. I fried up the onions and spices, made the sauce, then just snugged the whole boneless skinless thighs down in to cook for 30 min or so. Simpler prep and the chicken is so tender it falls apart so don't bother pre- cutting!

family loves this recipe. husband would like it a little spicier, so I add a bit more of the spices. I use heavy cream like other users have suggested and ground cashews for thickening the sauce. I serve it over jasmine rice with naan bread on the side.

Tastes like butter chicken! Just in case anyone else makes the same mistake, I accidentally put in heavy cream instead of half-and-half, so I put in about a quarter cup of milk to help balance the sauce. The sauce turned out well despite the mix-up: it took almost double the cornstarch and water to thicken it, but the sauce turned out pleasantly mild and creamy. My family all loved the dish; definitely making this again (with half-and-half next time).

Excellent!   I couldn't remember if I've already reviewed this or not, but I add a pinch of fenugreek and cheated by using almond butter instead of grinding my own nuts.  Making it again tonight, as I do every month or so.

Great recipe. I served it with a side of yogurt and grilled naan. I took the reviewer advice to add coriander, as well as to use fresh garlic and ginger in place of the paste, near tripling the amount. I also used heavy cream instead of half and half. Next time I make this dish (which I will most definitely be doing) I'll add a little bit more cayenne for our personal taste, and possibly try foregoing the cornstarch step and trying something else as a thickener, as another reviewer suggests. We loved this recipe!

Granted everyone in my family loves Indian food to begin with, but when I cook this recipe there are love vibrations all over the place.  I have trouble finding garlic paste sometimes so I make my own, but other than that I cook it as the recipe states.

A dash of smoked paprika, and a bit more garam masala than called for.  Very pleased with this dish...a hit!  Add some fresh parsley on top before serving.

This turned out really well. I didn't follow it exactly. In the end, it seemed like there was something a little missing when compared to restaurant versions, but it was still good. I'll need to experiment with it more.  I didn't need any cornstarch - the sauce was too thick - I actually thinned it with more half-n-half.  Also, since I didn't have peanut oil, I used corn oil, but then added about half a cup of chopped peanuts. That added a nice flavor and little crunch to it. I do wonder if maybe whole cream might be tastier than half-n-half, but that's very heavy.  Also, I would suggest increasing the spice mixture.  It tasted very tomato-ish, so I added more garam masala and a little bit of curry powder.  Even if you mess around with the exact combinations, I think this recipe is pretty hard to mess up and will turn out pretty yummy.  Best, Ben

My family loved this recipe and I liked it.   I made it according to the directions except made the changes one reviewer suggested to make it more authentic. So used ground cashews (salted) and heavy whipping cream instead of cornstarch and half and half.   No fenugreek on hand so didn't add that. Indian food is hard to make and this recipe was easy and quick. Next time I think I will use white meat tenders which I prefer and maybe ghee instead of butter and coconut milk instead of cream. It is pretty heavy on the dairy and upset my husband's tummy.

Be sure to use generous amounts of both fresh ginger and garlic. Adding some ground coriander to the seasoning makes this just right!

I visited India palace with my sister and had makhani chicken there. Falling in love with it, we wanted to find a recipe and cook it ourselves.  The recipe here in allrecipes was simple to follow and it turned out better than we expected.  We found the spices at a local Indian grocery store and made a big batch of it to eat.  So good.  We feel confident to try cooking more Indian cuisine now!

This was good.  I make a fair amount of Indian food for my family as it is part of our heritage (my father in law is an immigrant from India).  My wife's cousins have taught me quite a bit about Indian cooking and cuisine, but we're 2,000 miles away and I search the web for ideas.  I followed a few suggestions that I saw on here because they rang true from what our cousins have taught me.  I opted to thicken with almond flour and it did a very nice job.  Also, instead of half and half or heavy whipping cream, I opted for coconut cream.  The spices were spot on and I liked seasoning the meat per the instructions.  (Meat dishes are something I've got to work out on my own because the family are all Hindu vegetarians).

Thanks for a good recipe, I've added it to my recipe box.

I've made this at least 4-5 times and every time I just drool over the wonderful flavors mixed together.  What an easy, delicious meal.  Love it so very much and so does my husband.  It's a recipe this is on my go-to list.

Good, but way too much heat for me. I had to use a few tablespoons of yogurt on my plate to cool my mouth off.

We've made this twice now.  The first time we followed the recipe with the exception of using cashews in place of corn starch and added coriander.  The second time we made it with lamb and the above mods, again, the sauce was awesome but we had to simmer the lamb in the sauce for quite some time before it became tender.  Each time it came out perfect!

Tastes great!! I forgot to add the cayenne pepper at the end and so it didn't have a massive zing, but the flavor was amazing!

This was very good and had great spice!  I did sub heavy cream for the 1/2 and 1/2 as that is what I had on hand.  I also used ground cashews in place of cornstarch.  Next time, I would sub something else for the yogurt as I don't care for the taste.

I found this recipe on pintarest. This is the exact same recipe and it is absolutely delicious and authentic top notch restaurant quality exactly as written! Probably could use more than one pound  of chicken for this amount of sauce. Simply Asia makes a sweet ginger garlic spice (available on Amazon) which I used instead of paste. Served over plain white rice.

I made this for a cultural fair, never having made Indian food before and it got rave reviews! so many people have asked for the recipe and I've made it twice since. Using chicken thighs over beats really makes a difference in flavor and moistness, btw. Thank you for this recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly, but added cashews like other individuals suggested.  I thought it was average.  I won't make it again, but will look for another recipe which is more creamy and buttery like what I get in a restaurant.

I proceeded to follow the recipe when it dawned on me how similar it was to Chicken Tika Masala...After some research I found that they are virtually the same, except Makhani uses butter. In the end I felt this recipe was very bland and I ended up adding more cumin and garam masla and salt, salt, salt. Won't make again.

This is good as is and is easily adapted to build flavors we particularly enjoy.  I typically use fresh garlic and ginger instead of paste, and add coriander.  I'll also use a heavier hand with the cumin and add turmeric and cardamom.  It's a very flexible dinner!

I adapted this recipe to make it lower carb and lower fat. I omitted the butter and half and half. I subbed tomato purée with 1 large can of tomatoes with juice. I omitted the cornstarch. It was still very good. Serve with tofu noodles for a low carb option.

I would probably do less (maybe half of what the recipe calls for) of the tomato purée. There was too much of a pronounced tomato flavor for an Indian dish. When I think Indian food, I think of a lot of spice, flavor, and heat (spice not temperature). All in all, the people I made it for seemed to enjoy it. I would make this again in the future with my recommendation.

It was too spicy for me but my brother in law who is a picky eater loved it and there weren't any leftovers. If I make this again I will tone down the spices. Goes great with naan

It was fine, but nothing to write home about. Not bad. Not very flavourful. I'll try it again with a lot more of the spices.

I am giving this 3 stars because I made a lot of changes. First of all, I used thigh and leg pieces, and didst cut them at all. Secondly, I seasoned the chicken with garlic, onion, salt, pepper, paprika, parsley, and garam marsla. I made the sauce as instructed, but added maybe 1/2 to 3/4 cups tomato puree. I added just a little tomato puree, then tasted, then added more. Once I could taste tomato and the other seasonings, I stopped.  Also, I omitted the cumin because it mysteriously disappeared once I needed it, and the chili powder. Thankfully, I forgot to add the chili powder. I added coconut milk, because other reviewers said it would make it taste more authentic. I didn't add yogurt  because I was afraid of it curdling, and added sour cream instead.

I really enjoyed this dish.  I'm not sure but I think it would be better if I used cooked pulled chicken instead of dicing and cooking the thighs. Something about the texture was off.   I also eliminated the cayenne pepper.  Not a fan of the heat.  I'd make it again.  I'll likely thicken it at the end with flour instead of corn starch.    Very good recipe.

This makes a ton of sauce, which is great!  I could easily double the amount of chicken to go with all the sauce.  I used an immersion blender to blend and thicken the consistency rather than adding cornstarch.

I loved it! Followed everything to the letter (except I didn't have ginger-garlic paste - but I used 1/2 t. garlic powder and 1/2 t. ground ginger - or the masala spice, and I used 16 medium, raw shrimp instead of chicken) until the end, where I wound up adding garlic salt and about 1/4 t. more of the cayenne pepper - my dad and I like it spicy. I reduced it a little before adding the cooked shrimp back into the saucepan, and I ended up using the cornstarch at the end as well because I like it thick. Will make again!

Not good at all in my opinion. Tasted bland even after I added more spice than listed. I think there was way too much tomato puree. I won't make this again.

This recipe was SOOOOO good and not that hard to make! It gives you the basics and you can spice it up depending one how you like it... I'm typically a medium spicy type of person. I didn't use the water or corn starch and definitely added more curry powder and cayenne pepper than the recipe called for and it was still medium spicy.  I also used fresh minced garlic and ginger which had a ton of flavor! I think next time I'm might try it with sautéed vegetables instead of just chicken.

Great start! Wish I could give a 4.5 stars since the only problem was a need for more spices. I followed the recipe and my mother kept adding things to make it a proper Indian dish. :) We added some ground cinnamon, ground nutmeg, cardamon, and anise seeds to the simmering chicken with a dash or two of cayenne pepper. Just remember not to bite into the anise seed or cardamon! We also used Himalayan salt (just nice for this dish). I used all lactose-free ingredients, too, and it turned out lovely. Thank you!

I didn't use cornstarch or water, I didn't have have garlic ginger paste, instead I chopped up fresh ginger (about a tablespoon)  and used a tablespoon garlic paste, this was so very good. My sweet husband is still raving about this dish, 5 star dish all the way !!!

As always using what was available at my house. And note I use whole cans, I hate waste or trying to put away half a can of something.  Used chicken breast, diced tomatoes and coconut milk added steamed green beans at the end to boost veg (could serve on the side but why?)Otherwise methods and other ingredients and spices were the same. Hubby loved it and my house smells great on a rainy night in May-Thanks!!

Not my flavor at all. I wanted to try indian food so I gave this a try and I guess maybe the peanuts were just clashing with everything else. I wont make this one again.

The recipe turned out great. I was expecting it  to be more spicy. Will definitely make it again but just add more cumin i guess.

Total success ... Awesome flavor and you can add as much or as little heat as you want.  The family enjoyed it so much that I was tasked to make it twice in the same week. I highly recommend .... and so does the family!

Wow! This is extremely close to the butter chicken from my favorite Indian restaurant.  I substituted coconut cream for yogurt and half-and-half as we have a dairy allergy in our family (no need for water and cornstarch as the coconut cream is very thick), and added 1 t ground coriander.  Absolutely delicious - thanks!

Tasted like the butter chicken I had in Little India (Singapore). I followed Yakuta's suggestions (thank you). Will make again, and again... and yes, again.

I followed others recommendations and swapped the cornstarch for 1/4 cup ground cashews, I made a few other small changes (i.e. low-fat greek yogurt instead of normal; 1 tbsp. each minced garlic and ginger, added 1 tsp ground coriander, tomato sauce for puree, and breasts instead of thighs with reduced cooking time) because of personal preference and what I had on hand. Also I served this over brown basmati rice. This turns out great, similar to restaurants, prep always takes me longer; but 10 minutes is a joke unless you have three people helping you and they are sous chefs!  But give this recipe a try you'll love it too. Thanks for sharing.

I've made this many times - we all love it! Lately we've been eating healthier so this time I made a few changes. I didn't use any butter - I used a 7 oz container of fat free greek yogurt & the juice of a whole lemon. I also added 1/2 cup low sodium chicken broth instead of cream. It was even better & tangier than the full fat version! I didn't use cornstarch and it was very thick & creamy. I also added chopped fresh baby spinach for color. Will make it this way from now on.

First time I tried making butter chicken I hated it!!! But this recipe was AMAZING!  It is also lower in calories, fat, etc than other recipes but SO FULL OF FLAVOR!  It wasn't as spicy as our typical tikka masala, definitely a nice change.  Only change to the recipe was fresh garlic and powder ginger because that's what I had.

I lived in Dubai for a year and half which is where I tried this dish first. A recipe I picked up at the local supermarket there noted coconut milk instead of half and half. We make your recipe (slightly different from above) often and have noticed also too much sauce not enough chicken. I doubled the amount of chicken and kept the amount of sauce the same. We can't handle spicy food with 2 kids so I decreased the amount of cayenne and left out the cumin as it takes days for the house to air out.  With all these changes, it still tastes pretty good. I hope I haven't drastically massacred your masterpiece :)

I marinated the chicken in lemon juice and then in yogurt with tandoori spice. I think next time I would Brown the chicken in the oven. I also added coriander and fenugreek leaves to the sauce in addition to the other spices. Was pretty good.

This was really good, loved the Garam Marsala. I used 1/2 cup of paste in place of the purée. Also cut back a bit on chili powder and cayenne, as kids don't like spicy food. Also left out the water and cornstarch...as it was thick enough. Also added a bit of milk to make it a bit creamier. Will make again.

We liked this. Made as written except used fresh garlic and ginger.  I should have added more cayenne. It lacked the heat I wanted. The sauce was delish. Went back for seconds of the sauce and just dipped my parantha in it. Yum.

Much easier than it looks and the result was very good. I used a chicken cube in place of salt and the other heart damagers stayed the same. This was a definite hit with everyone invited for lunch!

I just cooked this tonight. I am Indian, but I don't have time to cook this the traditional way, so I was looking for a recipe that is a little quicker. This recipe turned out to be just that. I made a couple of adjustments. I added a teaspoon of coriander, and instead of cornstarch and water I used ground cashews mixed with 2 tablespoons of melted butter. It turned out rich and creamy, so I was really pleased.

I love this recipe! My Boyfriend lived in China for a long time and had mentioned that the one thing he missed the most was getting chicken Makhani from a indian family there... I was so excited to make this for him because i have made this recipe so many times before and recommended it to many of my friends. My boyfriend is head over heels for this recipe! He said it tasted even better then what he got back in China- I guess thats the key to a mans heart! 

ANYWAYS- I modify the recipe very slightly putting more garlic and ginger and putting that in my food processer to get a nice texture... i also put my onions in there too... laziness... possibly?... I Also marinade my chicken for a few hours beforehand in a mixture of cayenne, salt, pepper, garam masala and a very little bit of chicken broth and tomatoe juice... so the spices can adhere and really penitrate the meat... I also used buttercream instead of Half and half - which didnt turn out horribly but i wish i would of bought the half and half...

Delicious and easy to make. Served with rice and some naan to soak up the sauce. Yummy.

This is the best of all of the Butter Chicken recipes I've tried.  I did follow suggestions and left out the corn starch.  Instead I took about 1/2 cup of the sauce and pureed it with 1/2 c. roasted cashews and then stirred that back into the sauce and it worked perfectly.

I tried this recipe last night and it was delicious....I was thrilled with the results.  To make it low carb I used tomato paste instead of tomato puree, used 1/4 cup of full cream, no yoghurt or half and half.  I did not add water but instead used the juice that had cooked out of the chicken.  I did not add cornstarch.  The tomato paste was thick enough to make the consistency perfect. This is an amazing recipe and probably the most adventurous recipe I have ever tried in my life...

For my first attempt EVER at making any kind of Indian cuisine I must say this was AMAZING! I did follow the advice of both AMIBOULD and YAKUTA. My husband loved the dish and while cooking it my dogs would not leave the kitchen hoping for something to drop. I will defiantly be making this again.

I've just finished making this. It has turned out to be delicious after initially thinking it would be a disaster. I had forgotten to buy butter and peanut oil. I used instead olive oil spread :O and it didn't have a bad effect. Great recipe!

This recipe came out perfect! I didn't even need to add the cornstarch. I chopped the onion, garlic and ginger finely in a food processor which made the sauce nice and thick. My family loved it!

I tried this recipe and it tastes great! As soon as I added the tomato puree and yogurt the color turned a rich golden orange shade. I finally know how to make Indian sauce! My only advise is to watch out for the Tumeric seasoning. Do not spill any on the counter because it will turn your kitchen counter yellow. It took bleach to get it out. This yellow stays on for days. Other than that this is a great recipe and my husband loved it! Thank you

This was a good Indian recipe that is very filling.  I'd recommend the following to spice it up even more:

1.  Triple the ginger garlic paste
2.  Quadruple the cayenne pepper

Wow! Loved this recipe! I did make a few changes though.. I used more yogurt and less 1/2 and 1/2 to make it healthier. I also added some cardamom seeds to give it more of an authentic Indian kick. I passed on the cornstarch and used grated up cashews and almonds to thicken the sauce. Turned out great!

I recently tried Indian cuisine for the first time at an authentic Indian restaurant. I ordered the Chicken Makhani and was thoroughly impressed with its taste. I thought to my self, “I have to replicate this”. So I searched All Recipes for the best rated Chicken Makhani recipe and came across this recipe. 

I can say for a fact that this recipe is absolutely SPOT ON for its flavor and consistency. I followed the recipe to the letter and discovered that the spices called for here create a very natural heat. The sauce starts our creamy and delicious and the heat just creeps right up on you. I used Garam Masala for the first time and completely fell in love with its flavors. The spice is not at all overpowering to the palette. 

Excellent recipe. I WILL be making this again and again.

My husband is from India and I am from Colombia.  This is my first time making this dish for him and he loved it.  It also got the stamp of approval from my eldest daughter who loves indian food.  I did not use any hot peppers however, because of my youngest child.  It was still very tasty. My mother-in-law will be proud of me.

Love this recipe.  Doesn't taste like restaurant quality but for a first time trying my hand at Indian food this came out perfect.  My husband liked it and he doesn't like anything with a tomato base in it!

After browning the chicken, I added the garam masala and cayenne. I let the spices heat up and toast a little, which made the cayenne come to life! Great way to get more heat!
I followed another reviewer's idea to use tomato paste instead of puree + water + cornstarch. Served this over steamed cauliflower for a low carb dinner. Awesome!

This wasn't bad, I just didn't think it was good. It didn't quite have enough spice and it didn't have a savory flavor either. I think maybe there was too much yogurt and that drowned out the flavors.

This is a great recipe, my family of 5 loved it!  Also made rice & homemade garlic Naan bread that paired with it nicely.  I made the recipe as is & only exchanged olive oil for peanut oil b/c I did not have peanut oil.  Will make again & can't wait to eat my leftovers!

I thought this recipe was great, HOWEVER I did change it. I read all the other reviews and made the following changes: tripled the ginger/garlic paste and also made it fresh, doubled the butter, doubled all the spices (except for chili powder) and put in an extra pinch or two of them as well. I used heavy cream instead of half and half, and I marinated my chicken in yogurt instead, and at the end added 1/4 cup ground cashew instead of water+corn starch. I also added a pinch of ground coriander and garnished with cilantro.

With these changes I thought it was as good as my favorite indian restaurants version. But, in our favorite Indian restaurant, their Chicken makhani has almonds and raisins in it too! I was wondering why none of the recipes online call for that? Interesting! 

Overall, I loved my version of the recipe! :)

This was yummy.  I used marinade from shish tawook grilled chicken because I'm a fan of that recipe and had 2 containers of greek yogurt to use up.  I used fresh garlic and ginger and also probably added more than 1 cup of tomato sauce, then a whole single serving contanier of plain greek yogurt and then added 1/2 and 1/2 until I was pleased with consistency (didn't use cornstarch slurry).  Served with rice and naan.  Also I grilled one bell pepper and onion while I grilled the chicken and sliced the charred veggies and added to sauce with chicken.  I was going to serve seperate but my husband likes everything mixed together, and it was a nice addition!

Fantastic! I have tried I don't know how many butter chicken recipes and they never quite hit this mark - but this one DID!! 

Thanks for the great hints from everyone. I used the recipe pretty much as it - only adding in 1/4 teas of Methi (Fenugreek to the spice fry) and 1 teas of Coriander ground. I didn't have a shallot, so I used 1/2 an onion instead. I also added in the 1/4 of a cup of ground cashew nuts, instead of the cornflour and water. I also used full cream - 1 cup and a 1/4 cup of yoghurt. These things really made it work. 

Really really yummy. Definitely restaurant quality. Thanks so much. :-)

This Recipe is really good. I normally use fat-free for both the yogurt and the half/half. I also have done this with both dark meat and white meat. I personally prefer the white meat. Also makes it a little healthier. I like that this recipe is adjustable. I am not a huge fan of cumin but I love my food spicy so I adjust it just a little every time. I have only tried Indian Food a few times, and this was the first I ever tried to make myself. Obviously, not a good judge of authenticity, but it is a yummy dish nonetheless.

Used lowfat coconut milk and fat free greek yogurt. The yogurt curdled slightly, even though I added it at the end.  The taste was excellent though.  Oh, I also added a little bit of cornstarch to thicken up the sauce.

Too many mods required to make it good. Just OK, had lots left over. Will not make this again.

I love this recipe.  I've made it at least 10 times, and it is always looked forward to in our house.  I usually up the butter to 3 tbsp, and add a tsp of coriander to the spices.  You will not be sorry making this recipe.

Love  love love this!  So close to anything we have had in a restaurant.  I always read the review first to see what might need to be tweaked.  I added more tomato purée and more half and half.  I didn't have ginger/garlic paste so I used powders, Probably 2-3T each.  We like it a little more tomato--y.  I also added a little salt to taste.  Served it with homemade naan- my first ever bread to make using yeast.  Came out a little tough but still delicious. I cant wait to make this again!

I made sushi rice with this, and shaped the sushi rice into a sphere by packing it into a pudding dish, flipping it over in the middle of the plate. I then ladled the Makhani over the rice and served with to Naan. I suggest a bit more salt and more Cayenne than less. I an going to an Indian food store to see if I can get prepared Garam Masala. I wasn't too thrilled with the thigh meat - next time I will, and suggest that white meat (boneless breast) be used. Other than that, the recipe is wonderful.

This is a def an Americanized version of the recipe. However, it’s missing a bit of  the authentic Indian touch. Cayenne will never be a substitute for Indian chili powder or mirchi. The texture and smell are not even close. There needs to be Indian chili powder and one to two fresh green mirchi in the recipe. It’s missing the right amount of tumeric powder, garam masala, cumin powder, fenugreek seeds, fresh tomato paste not the store bought (use fresh tomatoes). Instead of using corn starch use fresh cashew powder to thicken the sauce. You can add fresh cilantro on top to give it some life.

I made this last night and nothing was left but the gravy.  I omitted the shallots since I didn't have any on hand and used 3/4 cup whisked lowfat yogurt instead of the half and half.

I took the advice of some of the other reviews and used heavy cream in place of the half and half.  It naturally thickened up and there was no need for the cornstarch.  I also doubled the amount of garlic and seasonings because I like my food spicy.  Absolutely delicious!

Very very good. I used a combo of soy milk and coconut cream instead of half and half and ground raw cashews instead of cornstarch. I also added about 2 tbsp grated fresh ginger and chopped it with 2 tbsp of fresh garlic instead of using the ginger/garlic paste. During the cooking the tastes were a little off but by the time everything came together and I let the flavors mingle for about 10 minutes it was perfect- just like what I get in a restaurant.

This recipe was pretty good the only thing was it was pretty time consuming, Its good with yellow rice and broccoli on the side. I gave it 4 stars instead of five because it was a little spicy and Very time consuming, it took me an hour to finish and that is a long time for chicken, but it was very delicious for sure :), i would totally recommend  this unless of course you were looking for something quick

Mine was sour both times I made it. I put in more butter too cause I thought it could use it. I don't know what it is but there is something missing I just can't put my finger on it. I don't think i'll make this again, my husband wasn't a fan. The one I have at my local indian place is AWSOME.

This was delicious!  I followed this recipe exactly and although I did not have any prior Chicken Makhani to compare it to, I thought it was a perfect blend of flavors. I served it over Basmati rice and threw some nan in the oven to toast a bit. Everyone ended up ditching their forks and using their bread to scoop up the amazing dish.  Out of curiousity, I also picked up a jar of Indian Mint Chutney. Amazing flavors and spice and we served that in small bowls for people who wanted to spice their dish up.  I don't know if this is even one of the correct ways to use it, but who cares as long as everyone has a great meal!!

So easy and delicious! I only made a ferw small changes:
1. Ommited the flour on the chicken.
2. Substituted 1/2 cup of milk instead of 1 cup half and half. Just to cut the fat a bit. (I used regular full fat yoghurt.)
3. I didn't need the cornstarch mixture at the end. I had it ready to go but the sauce was just the right consistency without it.
My wife LOVED this dish, and it's flavorful without being overly spicy. A relatively easy first dish to try if you're interested in making Indian food. It's inspired me to try some of the more complicated curries, kormas and tikka etc. Yum!

This is a very nice recipe. I made it almost exactly as presented here, except I added a teaspoon of ground coriander and I did not use cayenne pepper (for my mild-mannered family). In the future, I would make this hotter (for myself) and perhaps add a bit more salt than I did. Otherwise, fantastic!

This came out very good with the suggestions provided by those "most helpful" ; )   Marinated chicken breast (cut into chunks) in buttermilk while I prepared ingredients and sauce.  There was a lot of leftover sauce so next time I would use 1lb chicken and cut sauce in half.  I made my own ginger/garlic paste by tossing equal parts into the food processor and adding a drop or two of water to form a paste.  I subbed fat free buttermilk (just over 1 1/4c) for the lemon, yogurt and half&half.  While sauce was preparing I ground 1/4c cashews in the blender.  Removed bay leaf from sauce and added sauce to blend until smooth.  While sauce was out of pan I browned chicken in a smidge of peanut oil and seasoned as directed.  Returned sauce and bay leaf back to pan and simmered with chicken on low for about 20 minutes.  Gave me just enough time to prepare Basmati rice for the side.  This came together very nice with a good amount of spicy heat.  My boyfriend felt it was just right but I would reduce the cayenne next time.  I have a feeling the spice intensified overnight and my leftovers for lunch will be even hotter.

4.5 stars.  This was a simple and tasty dish to make.  I pretty much followed the ingredients, except I used breasts instead of thighs, and didn't add cornstarch or water (the sauce was thick enough on it's own).  I also cooked it differently so that I only messed up one pot.  
First I sauteed the shallot and onion with the oil, then added butter, lemon juice and the spices (which I increased and tossed in some cayenne and coriander).  Added the chicken and browned it for a few minutes before adding the yogurt, heavy cream and tomato puree.  I let everything simmer for about 20 minutes or so over low heat, and served over rice.  Delicious!

awesome, pureed 1/4 onion, 3 garlic cloves and a chunk of ginger to start. Added a teaspoon of Pataks Curry paste, some coriander and a lot of cayenne to give it a good kick.

I have made this dish twice for my husband and I and it is pretty authentic, not to mention delicious. I substituted ghee for peanut oil, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Highly recommend it! Will try one reviewer's suggestion for substituting ground cashew  for corn starch next time.

Very good! So simple and easy. My thought though is to make sure you don't over add the tomato, other wise that's all you'll taste.

A very good and easy Indian chickn recipe.  I doubled the seasonings (garlic, masala and chili) and also added salt and corriander.  My husband is Indian and likes it spicier.  The recipe as written is very mild.  I also added butter, 2 Tbs. just didn't seem like enough for "butter chicken" :)

this is a pretty easy dish to make, and it is even better the second day, after the flavors meld together. The garam masala is important, so don't skip that step. We make this once a week and it's always a favorite!

Made this for the first time, TERRIFIC!  It is a tiny bit time consuming as I am new to Indian cuisine but sooo worth it!  My kids loved it too.  Perfect with some garlic naan!

This was an okay meal, but it tasted nothing like the authentic butter chicken we are familiar with.

The first couple times I made this I didn't measure because I had no tools and it turned out decent. Then I got tool and measured and this is really a fantastic dish. I would recommend it to anyone. Props to the poster

I thought this was good and my family liked it too.  I did not add the cornstarch or water and the sauce was plenty thick.  Next time I will use white meat to reduce the fat.  Overall very tasty and not too much work.

"wow babe" were my boyfriends first words out of his mouth when taking the first bite of this delicious chicken, I did everything according to the recipe and I would not change it one bit! And believe it or not it was even tastier the next day a left over!! I couldn't believe how much this tasted like the local restaurant my company orders from..wow! Lol soo amazing



***Update I used cream instead of half and half and sour cream instead of yogurt and it came out perfect no cornstarch needed!!

lovely! the only thing I would change is turn up the heat (spice) Also we used some heavy cream instead of half and half and did not thicken with the cornstarch mix, it was definitely thick enough. I would add some fresh cilantro next time I think...Overall-marvelous!

4.5 stars.  Yum!  Very tasty and flavorful!  Couldn't find ginger-garlic paste, so I used 1.5 t. of ginger paste and 1.5 t. of garlic paste.  Really wish we had naan on hand to get more of the sauce...  Thanks!

Made with potatoes. The only other thing I changed was to add lemon juice at the end (just before serving) and some kasoori methi.

I had to add more spices than the recipe called for. I also added the fenugreek like a poster suggested and heavy cream. I didn't have cashews to use as the thickener but I will be sure to use that in the future. Solid recipe with a few tweaks.

Great recipe.  I did not know what ginger garlic paste was and so just added fresh ginger and garlic.  I have made variations based on what I had in the house by doubling the yogurt and leaving out the half and half, using buttter milk instead of yogurt and half and using cocunut milk.  It is always good.  I have also used chopped tomotoes and put it  all through the blender.    I make 4 times the recipe and freeze the sauce in individual batches for a quick  meal.

I thought this was great.  It was full of flavor and not terribly complicated.  I had tomato paste which I mixed with water instead of tomato puree.  I also just minced up a bunch of garlic and ginger for the garlic-ginger paste.  My corner store did not have plain yogurt so I used sour cream.  Turned out great!

It has quite a few ingredients, but so worth the many new purchases i had to make. This was much better than the upscale curry restaurants i've been to. i just made it a day ago and want to make it again!

This dish is GREAT! I have made it twice--once with the cayenne pepper, once without--and it is a favorite at my house! The only thing I changed was the type of chicken. Instead of 1 lb. of chicken thighs, I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts, and it was excellent. Also, I did double the amount of garlic and ginger paste. This recipe is delicious, and it's a must with garlic naan and basmati rice! Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

I made this vegetarian by using chicken seitan. (you could using Morning Star chicken strips or store brought seitan) I also made the alterations suggested by the first reviewer -I subbed heavy cream and cashews. I am not sure if its a mistake but I used canned tomato SAUCE not paste as it mentioned sauce in the method and it was a large quantity. Anyway, this is one I will be adding to my recipe box for sure. I love the flavor and I love the simplicity :-)

Chicken was bland on the first day. It's slightly better the next day after it had absorbed the flavours in the sauce. Will look for another recipe to try next time.

This was quite good. At first I made as written other than adding the cornstarch (mine was thick enough for my liking without it) but it tasted like something was missing. I added about a tablespoon of cashew butter and let it sit for a few minutes and it was much better. I'd make this again.

I like Indian food, but I dont really know much about it.  This was a very easy recipe to follow and the end results were really good.  I like spicy foods, and I did add a little extra spices to make it hotter, but really good and really easy!

Great stuff. I've now made this twice. And of all places I found Graham Masala at our local Wal-mart bottled by McCormick of their Gourmet Collection spices.

This dish turned out INCREDIBLE!! One of my new fave dishes by far! I did modify however...First off, I doubled the recipe. Trust me, you will eat such heaping plates of this stuff that the supposed 4 serving sizes in this recipe doesn't go very far! Secondly, I could not find garam masala anywhere so I substituted with a hot curry spice mix and skipped on adding the extra cayenne. Next, I didn't have any tomato puree so I substituted with a 6oz can of tomato paste and about 2/3 of a can of condensed tomato soup.  And finally, I threw in a small bag of frozen peas, a little extra curry powder (I live in the South and we like things with a KICK!), and ground cashews to thicken instead of cornstarch. MMMMM Good! Highly Recommend!!!!

This recipe was outstanding, with a few twists. Per other reviews, I modified the recipe as follows: I used one large shallot and one medium size onion; I doubled the amount of butter and used french unsalted butter (plugra) instead of regular; I used four tablespoons of ginger garlic paste instead of one; I added one teaspoon of ground coriander to the sauce; I added one full teaspoon of salt to the sauce; I used fat free plain yogurt bc I couldn't find regular at the store (the butter made up for the loss of the fat content); I used simple Hunts brand tomato sauce instead of tomato puree; I used way more than one tablespoon of peanut oil to cook the chicken initially. Probably 3-4 tablespoons, at least enough to coat my frying pan. When the dish was finished, I topped it with two tablespoons (roughly) of fresh chopped cilantro. Served with basmati rice cooked in lots of butter with a teaspoon of cumin seeds and some frozen peas. The family thoroughly enjoyed this dinner. The best!!!!!

This is a family favorite! I make my own ginger-garlic paste by blending equal parts ginger & garlic. I also use olive oil instead of peanut oil and 1% milk instead of half and half.

This is a great recipe.  Just made it for dinner, and it was a hit with my 10 yr old niece and my husband.  I even took some over to my friends that are indian.  They said it was great.  I will use this recipe versus the chicken tikka, only because the time to cook and to  prep the dish.  I will make this dish again

This is my FAVORITE chicken recipe of all time.  The only adjustment I have made to this recipe is reducing the amount of tomato puree to about 3/4 cup. When I've made it with 1 cup in the past, it tasted a bit too tomato-y for my liking. Also, the dish will come out the same if you replace the peanut oil with vegetable oil, and if you don't have any cayenne pepper, you can add in more chili powder instead. Chicken breast can also be substituted for chicken thighs.

I tripled this, since 6 hungry adults LOVE chicken makhani. It was really wonderful, though I agree it seemed to be missing just a small something... I can't tell what. I used ground cashews as a thickener, and found that I did need a little more garam masala at the end than it calls for. Definitely a keeper!

Easy and well appreciated by a grade 12 class.  I had the students stir-fry a few veggies and add them to the dish while it was cooking - this increases the nutritional value, and helps stretch the dollar a little further.

This was ok, but it was missing some taste. It wasn't as good as the Indian restaurant's food. I didn't use garam masala though so maybe that's why it wasn't as good.

This was good, but a bit on the bland side, even though I added more garam masala than the recipe called for. I took the suggestion of others by grounding up cashew nuts for the thickening agent instead of cornstarch. I'd definitely make it again, and maybe experiment a bit to try to add more flavor.

Excellent recipe. I followed it exactly with the exception of using plain yogurt (I didn't have any), so I substituted it with sour cream. When I make this again, I'll probably use chicken breasts (or a mixture of breast and thighs) instead of thighs (personal preference). Thanks for the recipe - I'll be making this a lot in the future!

This was excellent.  I followed some other helpful hints posted here and used cashews instead of cornstarch and used fat free buttermil instead of half and half.  I also doubled the sauce and blended it all together.  I served with coconut rice and my husband and very picky 21 month old loved it!!!  Thanks for the amazing recipe

Great recipe but I would make a few adjustments: 1. I did what other reviewers recommended and ground cashews with some of the sauce and added that in to thicken the sauce up rather than using cornstarch or flour. 2. Added 2 tsp of coriander. 3. Added green and red peppers to give it some veg. 4. If you have time, do try and blend the sauce so it's smooth before adding the chicken. Bon appetite! Bon appetite!

This was fantastic. I suggest using 1/4 cup extra of yogurt. I also used milk instead of cream (just to cut the fat) and it still turned out awesome!! My husband wants me to make this for him every week!

This recipe took a lot longer than expected. what i did differently is substituting the half & half for heavy whiping cream and reducing the chili amount. I cook it more often now and i get compliments from everyone who tries it.

I was surprised by how good this dish was. I used cashews (that I ground fine) instead of the cornstarch, and I think it added depth to the flavor. The only other change I'd make next time is to use chicken breasts instead of thighs. Great recipe!

Oh yummy. I used "Easy Garam Masala" from AR and used less cayenne pepper and chili pepper because of the kidlets.

This was easy to make and so flavorful!  Even my 8 year old loved it!  I've never had an Indian Dish turn out this well before!  I had to substitute evaporated milk for the half and half, but it still turned out really well.  This would work well vegitarian as well.  This was so good it cured my fear of making Indian Food.

I agree with some reviewers. I thought it needed something too. Some reviewers suggested coriander, so i added about 3 tablespoons of fresh Cilantro I had on hand. I was really pleased with the results. I like my Indian food at a 5-6 on the spicy scale of 10. I like spicy food, but Indian restaurants have a completely different scale than the rest. Where 10 is really more like a 13 or 14 in my opinion.  This recipe, when made as instructed, comes in at a 2 on the spicy scale. I will definitely make it again, and further tweak the recipe.

This was yummy! I didn't have any ginger, even after sending my boyfriend out to get some late at night. Store didn't have any! So I didn't make a garlic/ginger paste, so I made a garlic/onion paste which was lovely. I didn't have cardamon either, but I had all the rest of the spices. I followed what another reviewer had said and I put more cayenne than usual and it was nearly too hot for me! My daughter braved on, but didn't finish and my boyfriend said it was to die for! Great recipe.

I was not crazy about this...It sounded so good with that many spices going into it, but it actually turned out to be kinda bland. I doubled up on the spices, but that didn't hide the fact that the yogurt and half & half were curdled from all the acidity in the dish. Probably won't make again...

I love this recipe! I make it at least 2 a month.  No need to have peanut oil, vege oil is fine.  I also sometimes add chopped green peppers and/or spinach when cooking the chicken. If you dont have yogurt, you can use lowfat/nonfat sour cream, gives it a little tang.

I second the advice to use ground cashews as the thickener -- yum! Another trick for making this a little healthier & cheaper is to use chickpeas in place of some of the chicken.

So good. I marinated the chicken first in some of the yogurt and spices for an hour, but otherwise followed the recipe nearly exactly. I found this recipe a bit too spicy and I even halved the cayenne pepper so I'd say add it gradually and taste with a big mouthful.

Since we moved away from my husband's favorite Indian restaurant, my husband has been wanting me to make an Indian dish. I found this and although I was missing a couple of the spices, he absolutely loved it. Although he thinks it would be better with a flaky white fish instead of chicken, so I will try that next time, but this will definitely become a staple in our home.

Great flavor!  I couldn't find ginger garlic paste so I made it from a recipe from another recipe site.  I noticed tomato puree in the ingredient list but the directions state tomato sauce.  Tomato puree has a more concentrated tomato flavor than sauce and it was  noticeable in the end result.  We still enjoyed it though.  The next time I make this I will use tomato sauce and see which way we like it better.

I followed the suggestion of others and made the ginger/garlic paste x3 the amount in the recipe.  Also, I added 1 teaspoon of Coriander. This made it taste just like the restaurant!    The recipe made small servings for a family, so i doubled everything in the recipe.

I LOVE this recipe!!! I have made it several times since finding on this site.  My husband requests it often!!  I do a couple different things. I use heavy whipping cream instead of half and half and I don't use yogurt.  I also add a little more ginger-garlic paste, garam marsala and cayenne.  I like a lot of flavor.  I also add just a little sugar to taste at the end.  We LOVE this.  Thank you so much for this recipe.

Excellent recipe, especially with Yakuta's changes. This is the only recipe I have ever found that comes close to the consistency and flavor of my favorite restaurant's butter chicken. I used ground cashews instead of the water and cornstarch, added another 1/2 teaspoon garam masala and chili powder to the sauce and doubled the butter (it is called Butter Chicken ;). Had to use peanut butter instead of peanut oil but it was still great. Make sure you use enough salt... this makes a big difference in balancing the flavors and adding that buttery sweetness.

This was pretty good, instead of 'bay leaf' use curry leaves if you can find them, they have them at authentic asian markets.  This will give the dish a more indian aroma.  Also, I couldn't find 'ginger garlic paste', I used ginger and garlic powder.

I fell in love with butter chicken and decided to make it for me and my boyfriend.  I followed the recipe and added the recommendation to add crushed cashews .. but I still felt like something was missing.  After reading the reviews .. i think there needs to be more salt.  bottom line, this was a decent recipe and would definitely make it again.  my boyfriend loved it.

This is now my favorite recipe.  But the estimated time was off for me--it took me about an hour from start to finish.  It was an easy recipe, and it tasted amazing.  I added cilantro and doubled the salt.  Next time, I will cut down on the chili powder, it's a little spicy for my taste.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  It tasted just like the butter chicken from our favourite Indian restaurant in Toronto.  It just screams for a mango lassi.  We served it with basmati rice.

DELICIOUS! Tasted just like restaurant quality!!
note: I didn't find it necessary to add the cornstarch & water, I think that would have made the sauce to thick.

This is absolutely DELICIOUS! Even though it was SO hot in spiciness it's well worth it. I will be adjusting the amount of chili powder and cayenne pepper to my liking. I thought people were a little crazy saying they thought it wasn't hot at all! I guess I'm not used to it. But seriously is absolutely delicious. I'm new to the Indian flavors but this is definitely worth trying!

This is a very good recipe if u want to make it a little more indian though i would suggest substituting the regular and make tandoori chicken to put in it instead.... also another good thing to add would be paneer i go to an indian restraunt by where i live and i can distinctly taste a hint of paneer in their recipe but i havent tried to do it yet so i dont know how much to put in...

I gave it three stars because that's what it would have been had I not made any modifications to the recipe.

This was a good base but I had to tweak it a LOT to give it some taste, and even then it wasn't enough.  There just wasn't enough salt (and believe me, I'm a salt-hater who only adds it when REALLY needed), and even if I put two pinches of cayenne instead of one, I should have put about four to make it just spicy enough.  I had to add about two teaspoons white sugar too - butter chicken is just not authentic without the sugar taste!  Also I only put three quarters of a cup tomato sauce - it was already PLENTY.  I didn't have half-and-half so I replaced it with a mixture of about 1/4 cup coconut cream and 3/4 milk with about 1 tsp of cornstarch.  I didn't thicken the sauce with water and cornstarch, instead I put about 1/2 cup ground cashews and added some whole cashews too.

All in all it was a pretty good recipe - when tweaked - but still not very special.  I'm probably going to do it again because the ingredients were quite inexpensive, but I'll go on tweaking it each time.

EDIT: realized I missed adding some of the cayenne required.  That would reallyyy have helped :P

One word:  AMAZING!!

My first attempt at cooking an Indian dish resulted in disaster, but after gaining some confidence, I decided to try one of my favorite dishes, Makhani Chicken.

I followed the recipe exactly except that I forgot to season the chicken just before adding it to the sauce, but I just combined the spices once the chicken was already mixed.  I also used heavy cream rather than half and half.  (Also, if you can't find ginger-garlic paste, do what I did and get separate tubes of garlic paste and ginger paste, usually found in major grocer's produce section.  I actually found mini three-packs with both these pastes in it.  Then just combine 1/2 tablespoon of each.)

My husband said this was the best indian dish he's ever had....and I agree!  I can now proudly say that MY butter chicken is MUCH better than what our favorite Indian restaurant serves.

Serve this with Basmati rice.  Plain white rice just doesn't cut it!

This recipe was as good as the meal at my favorite Indian restaurant. I followed the suggestions of some other reviewers and added cashews instead of cornstarch and cream instead of half and half. My whole family loved it! I will definitely be making this again soon.

This is pretty good.  I would modify this next time by pulsing a serrano chile into the tomato puree instead of using cayenne.  It would give the sauce a brighter and spicier flavor.  I always make my tomato puree from fresh tomato.  Don't worry about finding garlic/ginger paste in the supermarket - just use a clove of garlic and a 1/4" slice of ginger in the tomato when you puree it.

i was a bit disappointed with this recipe because it tasted too tomato-ey and musty for me...although my bf liked it, he said that it was a bit on the tangy-sour side..i bought instant butter chicken mix once and thought that was a bit better

BEYOND wonderful!!  This tastes exactly like it does in our favorite Indian restaurant.  I serve this over basmati rice and with Naan from this site, too.  Everyone in our family LOVES this and we've made it several times!!

this is really good but there was some things I changed: 1.)Add 1 teaspoon of Coriander while your simmering it at the end 2.)I reduced the amount of yogurt and tomato sauce by 3 tablespoons and 3/4 cup respectively. 3.) I liked it spicey so I added more cayenne 4.) I had some "Bombay Curry Simmer Sauce" which gave it an essential Indian flavor, it had a vinegary taste to it. Served with Jasmine or Basmati rice and it tastes great.

I have made this recipe several times and love it more every time.  I usually leave out the cayenne as my family doesn't really like spicy food.  Also, substituting cashews for corn starch really adds some extra flavor and thickens it nicely.

This was FABULOUS! Did make some alterations though, instead of cooking the chicken w/garam marsala & cayenne, I added about 3 teaspoons of each to flour, and then coated the chicken with it. Also, sauteed shallots in white wine as well as the oil, it gives them a little bit more bite. But, wow! What a great meal! Thanks!

I haven't made anything Indian in a long time, so I was nervous about trying this, but it was FABULOUS. I actually intended to make another recipe for this from Allrecipes, but I couldn't find tikka masala sauce at the store so I did this one instead. It turned out amazingly well!  In fact after we ate there was hardly enough for my husband to take the next day for his lunch! Even my 15 month old liked it. I used bone-in thighs, which I browned first (next time I would omit the oil and just brown them skin side down first with a bit of Pam, and render the oil from the skin to brown the other side with). It was a bit too oily with the oil AND the skin on. I just took the thighs out and added them to the sauce pan but that meant losing out on all the browned bits from the few tablespoons of sauce that it says to add to the browning chicken. Oh well. It was SO good and reminded me of my trip to India years ago. Definitely a keeper and worth the extra trouble making the sauce from scratch!

This recipe turned out really good, and I even flubbed it a bit.  I accidentally added a whole can of tomato sauce instead of measuring out 1 cup, and a whole tub of yogurt instead of measuring out 1/4 cup.  I also added some ground coriander and doubled the garlic and ginger, as one reviewer suggested. This would be good with chicken breast meat if you don't like the dark meat.

This is the first Indian style dish I've made. I used grouind almonds to thicken instead of corn starch on the advice of others, it added a nice flavor and texture, just be careful how much you use. I also added quite a bit more garam masala and used rotell tomatoes w/ chiles (pureed in processor) for an extra kick. My husband ate most of it before it was done (no lie). Thanks

I made this dish and had to doctor it a bit.  I used minced fresh garlic and ginger and doubled it.  Then I also doubled the spices and added a tsp of coriander.  I also added about triple the cayenne and didn't use corn starch.  I used heavy cream and the consistency was perfect-didn't need the ground cashews at all that other people had used.  I used quite a bit of salt to season it as well as adding garlic powder and ginger powder to taste once the initial sauce was ready.  Overall, it tasted great over basmati rice, will definitely try it again.

4.5 actually. It is was absolutely delicious. The only thing differently would to add some chilies. It was a bit mild. But, we loved the meal. Served with cube boiled potatoes. I wanted curry potatoes, but I thought it would clash with taste. So, we served only with potatoes.

!!: Citric acid in jarred tomatoes, ginger, & garlic can make the dish very sour.  Per other reviews, I used:  double all the spices except cayenne;  fenugreek (too lazy to grind the seeds so I toasted them in oil before adding the rest of the spices) & coriander;  cashews instead of cornstarch; ghee instead of butter; lemon or lime at the end of cooking to taste.  Varying proportions of regular, thick Greek-style & strained yogurts, & half & half & cream are all great—-even whole milk, though result is not as thick.  Delish w/ eggplant (prebaked), mushrooms, & tofu. Since all three release a lot of water, you may want to consider;  press &/or prebake the tofu; precook the mushrooms; use thicker yogurt & more ground cashews. But a thinner consistency is still very tasty, as long as there are enough spices in the whole dish.

Yummy.  My family LOVES Indian food, but it's hard to find recipes mild enough for my young girls 2 & 5, but complex enough for us. This was a hit, my oldest had 3 helpings. A new family regular...oh BTW, I ran out of plain yogart, so I used sour cream instead.

Really good dish. Has a lot of flavor and just spicy enough. I followed it to the T except I left out the cornstarch. Served it over rice with some Naan bread on the side. My hubby liked it alot!

This was very good.  However, it just didn't compare to the wonderful Butter Chicken at Temptations in Mtn. View, CA.  Maybe I can sweet talk them into giving me their recipe!

This was a good dish but seemed to be missing something. I can't put my finger on what exactly, but maybe I'll try adding more garam masala next time and see if that does the trick.

This was very delicious and quite authentic. I used two-three times the ginger-garlic paste and more cayenne pepper. Also, I used cashew to thicken the sauce, not cornstarch. It was absolutely fabulous! I will make it again.

My husband and I love this dish...I hadn't ever tried indian food before and this isn't too spicy for me (I can't take a whole lotta spice)... it was perfect! We love it! UPDATE: SEVERAL PEOPLE SAID IT TAKES WAY LONGER THAN STATED IN THE RECIPE. WE USE A WOK AND IT TAKES RIGHT AROUND THE TIME IT SAYS...MAYBE A FEW MINUTES MORE. ALSO, AS AN AMERICAN, I FIND THE RECIPE PERFECT AS IS BUT I AM NO INDIAN CONNOISSEUR! MMM MAKES MY MOUTH WATER JUST LOOKING AT THE PICTURE! THE ONLY THINGS WE DO DIFFERENT IS MIX FRESH MINCED GARLIC AND 1 TBSP. FRESH GROUND GINGER. OTHERWISE IT'S PERFECT. AND YOU MUST USE GARAM MASALA - DO NOT OMIT. THIS MAKES THE DISH!

This was quick and easy for an Indian recipe.  This tasted almost the same as the butter chicken at our local Indian restaurant, except for the lemon.  I may skip the lemon next time, or cut the dose in half, because I enjoy the sweetness of butter chicken and don't see a need for the tartness of the lemon.  My husband is from India so he's a good judge, and he liked it a lot.  I'm glad, because his mom's recipes are much  more time consuming and exhausting for me to make on a regular basis.  Thanks for the easy Indian recipe!

This recipe was a little bitter, but all in all, delicious. I think next time I will try it with the cashews and fenugreek, though.

This recipe was excellent.  My family loved it.  I used a combination of chicken thighs and chicken breasts and sprinkled a little chopped cilantro on top to finish the dish. Will definitely make this again!

Excellent! This is one of the best indian recipes  I've used. It took a bit of time to find out what "Half-and-Half" was and find a substitute here in the UK, and the ginger garlic paste was a little hard to find. Well worth the effort though, thanks for submitting!

I followed the recipe exactly, and when we tried it, we agreed that it didn't taste like Butter chicken. Maybe what we are used to eating is more of a "Western" version, and this is more traditional.  But having said that, we still felt that it was very tasty. I would make this again, but I wouldn't say that its Butter Chicken.

I have been to a lot of good Indian restaurants and this by far is THE best Indian dish I have ever had.

We did make one change to the recipe and that is used boneless chicken breast.

This was my first attempt at cooking Indian cuisine and what a SUCCESS!  My family loved everything from the aromatic smell when they arrived home to licking the sauce out of the serving bowl at clean up time!  (You'd have thought it was cake batter!)  Like others, I substituted sour cream for yogurt and didn't need to do the cornstarch at the end for thickening.

This was absolutely delicious! I did not have all of the ingredients required so I wasn't sure how it would turn out, but it was great. I did not use the ginger-garlic paste, or cayenne pepper. I also substituted 2% milk for cream and I only had vanilla flavored yogurt. In the end, it was one of the best meals I've ever made. Even after adjusting the recipe and substituting so many ingredients, it still turned out awesome!

Really excellent. I use chopped fresh ginger instead of paste, and half a cup of tomato puree instead of a whole cup. I had to find out what "half and half" was - half milk, half cream - but, apart from that, the recipe is very easy to follow.

This took me forever to make (perhaps a testament to my cooking skills) but it was well worth it!  This has a fantastic flavor - rich and tangy and spicy.

We loveed this!  We eat something very similar at our local indian restaurant, except there it is called chicken tikka masala.  Although this is not quite as good as the restaurant version, it was really good, and it is very easy to make!  This is one of our new favorites!

This was a great recipe!  I was making it for my grandmother, who doesn't do spicey, so I omitted the cayanne and it was still good.  Also substituted sour cream for the yogurt.  Will definitely make again.

This recipe was okay. It did not taste much like butter chicken, but still very tasty. I used milk instead of half and half and a can of tomato sauce. This recipe is definately worth a try!

Love, love, love it!!!  Made a huge batch and sent it in with my husband to work for all the guys and he came home with an empty dish!  To make it even easier, buy a pre-cooked chicken at the market and use that instead of cooking your own!

Very good.  I did not thicken the sauce, either.  Next time, though, I will not put as much yogurt in it.  1/4 cup is not very much but I still felt a very strong yogurt taste, a little too much for my liking.  But, delicious nonethless.

This was excellent!  You can make it hotter if you like, but my husband doesn't care for Indian food because of the warmth so I just made it as written and it was perfect for us whimps.  Made the basmati rice recipe and the curried chickpeas.  All it was missing was some naan bread!  Thanks for the recipe!

I can't believe I pulled this one off. I went to the market and got all of the ingredients, only to discover when I returned home that I had bought chicken thighs with skin and bones. After I skinned and deboned the thighs and started to cook the recipe, I realized that I didn't have any butter, only Country Crock! Despite my set-backs, the dish was great. My boyfriend couldn't stop talking about how good it was. I served it with basmati rice, Chickpea Curry (from this site) and Raita (from this site). A BIG sigh of relief as well as a BIG thank you!

I have made this several times, and it's always wonderful!  I've recently begun using a whole boiled chicken, shredded instead of pieces and doubling the sauce to serve over rice.  Indian food is fabulous, but so many people don't try it because the ingredients can be mysterious.  TRY IT, you'll love it!

My children liked this. We had eaten it in resturants and they said it was just as good. Easy to make and fast. Only thing I would change is less tomato. I like it creamier with more butter taste.

Ok I really really really liked the flavor of this. My husband told me when we got married he'd never eat Indian food but thank to this dish he now promises to go with me. I served it with couscous but I think it would be much better with rice. I will make this again. THANKS!

Great dish.  My husband is Indian, but his family is vegetarian so I have to find good chicken recipes on my own.  We both really enjoyed this.  I added garbanzo beans, too.

The lemon juice makes the cream curdle.  Eventually, when the cornstarch is added, it binds back together.

I was hoping to find something that tasted like what I would get in an Indian restaurant. This wasn't that close. Felt like it was missing something major.

We liked this a lot.  The only change was that we used chopped tomatoes rather than puree because that's what we had on hand.    It was surprisingly easy to make, and I have no complaints about it.  The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is that i wouldn't say it was a knock your socks off recipe - it was just really good.

This was SO good and so fragrant!  I like things a little spicier, so will add more cayenne next time.
I'm going to try a lighter version of my own making and see how it compares.
Thanks

Okay! I am changing my review. Before I said that I didn't like it. This time around, I added 1 can of diced tomatoes and half a can of peas.  That changed it for me.  I served it over basmati and what do you know...yum, yum, yum!

Agreeing with other posters, this dish lacked a certain something.  I followed the recipe exactly, and while it was good, I don't consider it a 'keeper'.

The whole family loved it, but felt it lacked something - not quite sure what though. My husband actually suggested adding some honey - which I now see some other reviews also suggested. Perhaps a little more spice too, although this was perfect for young children. Still a kepper in my recipe box!

SO GOOD.  NOT AT ALL SPICY.  I COME FROM A SPICEAPHOBIC FAMILY AND THEY ALL THOUGHT IT WAS SUPERB.  I USED ONE QUATER CUP GROUND CASHWES TO THICKEN IT INSTEAD OF THE WATER AND CORNSTARTCH...WORKS PERFECTLY.  I ALSO USED GHEE (CLARIFIED BUTTER) INSTEAD OF THE PEANUT OIL AND BUTTER.  ADDS WONDERFUL FLAVOR AND IS MUCH BETTER TO SAUTE IN ALSO.  MAKE SURE YOU SERVE THIS OVER BASMATI RICE.  I LEFT OUT ONE TEASPOON OF THE GARAM MASALA...I FORGOT TO SPICE THE CHICKEN WITH IT...NEVER MISSED IT, DEFINITLEY SPICY ENOUGH WITHOUT.  THIS IS A FABULOUS RECIPE...I'LL BE MAKING IT TONS IN THE FUTURE!

Tasty, and easy to make.  I used boned in chicken pieces and cooked in a pressure cooker; took very little time. I have to admit that it's not the best butter chicken recipe I've tried.

I have tried many Butter Chicken recipes and this one was the closest to the real thing.  It just needs a tablespoon of sugar to make the recipe a little sweeter.

This was only ok. Just a suggestion: add a little bit of honey to make it a tad sweeter, use a little more butter, and use more garam masala. I thought it made it taste a little closer to "restaurant style".

Wow, is this ever good.  It's easy to make too.  The only difficulty I have (and I've made it several times now) is getting it to thicken without burning the milk-based sauce.  It seems to work if it's brought to a very slow boil, stirring all the time.

Great recipe!  My husband, who is not a huge fan of Indian food, LOVED it!  I was too lazy to try to track down garam masala, so I searched for it online.  Found several recipes, so you can make your own garam masala spice mix from spices you probably already have!  Turned out wonderfully!

This is fabulous. It was all that I was hoping it would be. A rich creamy sauce with the tang of tomatoe adding a nice touch. As I was preparing the recipe I thought it called for an awful lot of spice, but at the end I added even more, so definately follow the instructions. I served this with the Lentils and Spinich recipe that is also on this site.

The recipe was very good.  My older son liked it a lot, but my younger son thought it was too spicy.  Other than that it was excellent.  I plan on making it again, but with less pepper.

My family LOVES this recipe.  Even my six year old finishes his plate.  We like a bit more tomatoes, so I used a whole 28 oz. can of diced tomatoes and only pureed half the can, to give it a bit more texture.  This goes really well with Naan bread, which is really easy to make, especially if you've got a pizza stone.

This was wonderful! so flavourful! The first time i made it,i left out the cayenne and it was still a bit hot&spicy for our taste -- we prefer our sauces to be pretty mild. So last night I made it again, leaving out the chilli powder altogether and added a touch of cinnamon. it was fantastic! We loved this with the coconut rice recipe also on this site. the flavours really went together well. This is a new favourite. :)

My boyfriend and I liked it, just wasn't the butter chicken i expected.  It ws a lot of work with all the spices needing to be added at certain times.  It ended up tating like curry chicken, you could buy that in a bottle.  I thought it would be more sweet too.  Not bad though.

De-lish!! My husband and I love this dish. It's fairly simple once you get all the ingredients. What's even better - you have all the spices handy for the future meals. We used chicken breast and crushed canned tomatoes. I added a lot more cayanne for heat/spice. YUM!

I loved this recipe! I kind of had a hard time finding the Garam Masala but finally did and it was great! I will most certainly prepare this meal again!

This recipe tastes great and is so easy to make.  It tastes great with naan, accompanied with a yogurt, cumcumber salad.

Very tasty!  Everyone loved it!  Even my kids who insist they don't like Indian food! Used equal amounts fresh ginger and garlic, pureed a can of whole tomatoes and didn't need to use the cornstarch mixture-thickened nicely with simmering. Served w/Basmati rice and barely had any leftovers even though I doubled the recipe!

This was good but not great. For all the ingredients I expected something better. I did use no-fat half and half and no fat yogurt, which probably made a big difference.If I make it again I will use the standard products. I also was not sure about the ginger garlic paste. I looked everywhere and could not find it so used extra garlic and extra ginger.

This recipe was great - very authentic!  My husband, a huge Indian food fan, loved this.  It was a little too spicy for my kids and me, but we stirred extra plain yogurt in ours, and then it was fine.  Will definitely make again, but I make reduces the spices a bit.

Yum! This was so delicious and easy to make. I'm 16, and I managed very easily! Doubled the recipe to get more leftovers, and marinated the chicken a few hours in soysauce, lemon juice and chili powder. 
Just like everyone else, I made my own ginger-garlic paste by adding equal amounts of ginger & garlic and then mashing them up.
Also added more spices, because I like it hot!
My whole family & bf loved this recipe! Will absolutely do it again! Make sure to serve it with warm Naan, and it will be a hit with anyone! Thanks Mitch for a great recipe!

Great recipe! I used 2 large chicken breasts and cut them into 1" cubes. After cooking the chicken, I added it to the cooked sauce and simmered it all together for about 10 minutes. Also, I didn't have any shallot at home so I substituted extra minced garlic and a bit more onion to make up for it. I also skipped the cornstarch and water -- the sauce was thick enough without them. I will definitely make this again.

I've never had this at an Indian resturant but this was incredible.  Very filling and my four year old even loved it.  No leftovers at all.  We will definatly make this again.

I wasn't really impressed with this recipe.  The only change I made was substituting vegetable oil for the peanut oil.  The end result was kind of bland, and it didn't taste authentic to me.

This stuff is a great please-everyone meal. Just like restaurant Indian, and easy to adjust the flavours. My very non-adventurous parents even loved it. I skip the thickening part, use chicken breasts, olive oil, a mix of jarred garlic and ginger, and serve with pita bread when we can't find naan.

to my surprise it was really really good! I used more yogurt and less cream, added about 1 tsp of tomato paste to crushed tomatoes and about a 1/2 tsp of fenugreek.

This came out ok and was nothing fantastic.  Of course, it may have been my fault since I couldn't find peanut oil and ginger garlic paste, I ran out of shallots, and I used chicken breast meat.  This dish needed salt and was not really spicy.  I don't think I will make this again.

This recipe was very good.  The only changes that I made were:  I used tomato soup instead of tomato puree and used chicken breat instead of thighs and cooked only 5 mins instead of 10 mins.  Also I did not need to thicken it.
Thanks Mitch a good one!

This recipe is almost like the restaurant. So good, that I made it for christmas dinner instead of turkey. To make it taste more authentic I add about 2 tbsp. honey. I also use stewed tomatoes for a nice red colour. You can use any part of the chicken or even make just the sauce and pour it over basmati rice and your favorite veggies and lentils.

i didn't have any half-and-half or cream on hand, so i substituted with 3/4 cup milk & 3 tbsps butter, & added more yoghurt than was needed.  used more chilli powder to give it a bit more kick.  didn't marinate the chicken, but i thought it could have done with overnight marination to improve the taste.  overall, not restaurant quality, but it tasted great!

I followed the suggestion of using fenugeek and ground cashews.  This tasted even better the next day. I used fat free half and half, but If your not worried about fat, real cream would taste fantastic. Marinading the chicken beforehand would make it a little more flavorful. Do you have a good recipe for Chicken Korma?  Thanks for the recipe.

This was very good, although I found it less creamy than the butter chicken I'd tried previously in a couple Indian restaurants. The yogurt gives it a bit of a tangy taste...but it was easy and delicious. My guests thoroughly enjoyed it!

Loved this recipe.. made some minor changes.. but mostly spice related (I love cardamom pods).  All over though, great recipe.
