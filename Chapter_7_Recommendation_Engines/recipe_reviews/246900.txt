This is quite easy to make and has the perfect balance of sweetness and tartness. Love the raspberry gelatin mixed in. I also tried a pinch of cardamon as that was listed in another recipe. We can't stop tasting this jam! I like to sample it on a saltine cracker - reminds me of how my mom gave me samples of her homemade jelly just as it was coming of the stove-mmmmm!

flavor was good but it did not gel and I ended up with syrup.
