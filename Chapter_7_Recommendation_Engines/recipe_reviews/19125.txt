I adjusted this recipe slghtly after reading the other reviews. It must have worked because my husband, who belongs to "picky-eaters anonomous" asked for seconds! This recipe makes the best chicken I have ever tasted. The adjustemnts I made were to decrease the paprkia and brown sugar by half, only use 3/4 c wine and leave the lid off so it thickens better. Try it, you'll love it!

Following some of the advice of others, I modified this recipe to tailor it to my family's tastes.
For this, I used four boneless chicken breasts with the tenderloin cut to create eight pieces of chicken.  I added sliced onions and mushrooms, which I sauted before browning the chicken and returned to the pot after adding the liquid.  I also cut back the sugar to 1/4 cup, as per others suggestions.
In addition, I only used 1/2 cup of a nice "Concho y Toro" chilean merlot and added 1/2 cup of reduced sodium chicken broth for the liquid.
I dredged the chicken in seasoned salt and the paprika and let it sit 15 minutes which helped to create a nice color during the browning process, as I decided not to fully cook the chicken before the simmer to reduce dryness.
I also thickened the broth, as per a suggestion, after removing the cooked chicken by adding 1 tablespoon cornstarch and heating to boiling.
This recipe was excellent!  My two year old gobbled up the chicken and demanded not only seconds but thirds!  The sauce, thick with onions and mushrooms, made a wonderful gravy for mashed potatoes.  
I was paid the highest compliment for this dish as my mother-in-law asked for the recipe!  What better endorsement than that?  Enjoy!

This recipe was great, but the measurements on the ingredient list must be way off.  1 1/2 cups of sugar is WAY too much.  So is 1 tablespoon of salt.  This recipe is perfect with about 1/2 cup of sugar, 1 teaspoon of salt, 1 teaspoon of pepper and t teaspoon of paprika. Also, I suggest simmering the chicken with the lid off so the wine will reduce a bit.

I used 1/4 cup sugar, which was just enough. The 'something extra' I added was 1TBSP unsalted butter. I added in a little cornstarch to thicken the sauce (I spooned some of the sauce into a separate bowl, mixed with with the corn starch and then put it back into the skillet so it wouldn't get lumpy.)
Next time, I may use 3/4 c. wine and 1/4 cup water or broth. It was pretty powerful, but good, chicken. I also coated the chicken with salt, pepper and paprika before I started cooking. I don't remember the measurements but it wasn't the same as this recipe mentions.

This dish has soo much potential, to make it a hit, there must be changes.  First off, I seasoned chicken with salt pepper, and seared in olive oil until juices ran clear.  Then I removed from pan, drained some of the oil, added 1/2 cup of sliced red onion, i garlic clove chopped, 1 cup of red wine, 1/2 cup of chicken stock, and 1 good tbs of brown sugar.  DO NOT USE ALL THE BROWN SUGAR RECIPE CALLS FOR, I also added some garlic powder and onion powder, and 1/2 tsp of dried basil, and a good pinch of crushed red pepper to balance the sweetness.  I let sauce simmer for awhile and added the chicken back to the pan, coating well with sauce.  Let reduce down a little.  Meanwhile I cooked 1/2lb of spaghetti noodles.  I removed the chicken from the pan, and placed on platter, and tossed spaghetti in remainder of sauce. The sauce this way is wonderful!!!NOt sweet at all, and a little spice from the crushed peppers. It will be a winner if you tweak with it, and the spaghetti with the sauce was out of this world, it was a gourmet meal!

I've used this website for a LOT of recipes, but this is the first one I've made where my boyfriend couldn't stop talking the entire way through the meal about how great it was.  He even ate the extra chicken that I made to bring to lunch today!  I too reduced the brown sugar and upped the red wine (we're wine drinkers, so I knew that would be good) and it was delicious. I didn't have any paprika and it turned out fine.  I also seasoned the chicken a little with some salt and pepper about an hour before cooking it.

I personally liked this recipe, but my family members only thought it to be okay.  I think because it is VERY sweet.  I would reduce the sugar and wine.  Since I am the cook, I plan to make it again regardless of the support from my family, but I will modify it slightly so that they also enjoy it.  PS-I agree on the mushrooms-add them! Its worth it.  Also, simmer with the lid off!  This will result in not too much extra sauce (unless you have plenty of something to dip it in!)

Very yummy recipe and something different than what I normally fix.  I cut back on the sugar, and made sure that I used a dry red wine.  I also sliced an onion into thin rings and sauteed it with the garlic for some additional texture to the dish.  I made it the first time for company and everyone really enjoyed it!

I made this for my fiance and he absolutely loves it! I added mushrooms to the recipe and it tasted delicious. Made the chicken again two days later for guests...and needless to say, they enjoyed it as much as we did! Will definately make this again! This is now one of my favorite chicken dishes! Thanks!

This is a simple dish that tastes like a lot of work went into it.  I make it whenever I am short on time, since it only takes a few ingredients. My husband loves it, too.

Truly awful and gross tasting.  I'd given it zero stars if I could.  I used scant sugar since all others said it was too sweet and it was still straight to the trashcan.  This is NOT coq au vin so don't waste your time and be fooled by the positive reviews here.  This is truly the worst recipe I ever made from this site!

What a delicious yet simple recipe! It didn't turn the chicken purple. I think the combination of paprika and quick-browning the breasts tempered the color of the wine quite a bit. Anyway, I cut each breast in half lengthwise, sprinkled with salt and paprika, and browned the meat in two batches, 2 minutes on one side ONLY. Then I returned all chicken to the pan, browned side up and sprinkled with 1/4 c. brown sugar. For wine I used Cabernet Sauvignon, simmering the breasts for 15 minutes, uncovered (added mushrooms last 5 minutes). I removed the meat while I thickened the sauce with 2 tsp. cornstarch in a little water. Then I returned the chicken to the pan.  The sauce was plenty sweet. Reminded me of Chicken Marsala! The key was having all ingredients measured and ready in advance so that the chicken didn’t overcook between steps. Fabulous over Yukon Gold mashed potatoes, which I had made an hour before and simply reheated at the last minute.

This was fantastic!  By far it was the favorite dish at dinner.  The chicken was tender, the sauce was excellent, and it was very easy to make.  (It took me longer because I started with a 5lb fryer chicken and removed the skin and bones to ensure that it would cook evenly.)  Definitely cut back on the sugar.  1/4 c is plenty, I might even scale back a little more next time.

I have to admit that I was nervous as HECK about making this one after all the hit & miss reviews. In the end, I decided to take the advice of some of those who have gone before me. It's always better to err on the side of caution. :) So I doubled the garlic, cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup, cut the paprika down to 2 tsp, and bravely used the directed amount of red wine (a nice zinfandel). The flavors were perfect! I don't like to cook garlic in hot oil at the beginning of browning anything since it tends to burn & get bitter. Instead, I salt & pepper the chicken breasts and brown them, then added the garlic for the last 30 seconds or so of browning just to release the flavor, then followed Step 2 as instructed. Twenty minutes later -- I had delicious, caramely, tender chicken w/ a fabulous deep, dark color. Note that the instructions never tell you to turn down the heat, so I kept it covered & simmered over med-high heat.  This helped reduce the sauce & really blend the flavors. We really enjoyed this chicken! Thanks for the great start!  :)

Simply INCREDIBLE. This will be on the regular rotation at my house. I can't give it five stars because I didn't follow the original recipe. I followed one reviewer's advice who said to use 1/2 cup merlot, 1/2 cup chicken stock/broth and 1/4 cup brown sugar. I sauteed a diced shallot in olive oil. I patted dry chicken breasts, sprinkled generously with paprika, kosher salt, ground pepper and a small amount of Red Robin seasoning (akin to season salt). I then browned the chicken on each side. I removed chicken from the pan, added garlic & cooked for 1 minute before adding wine mixture & deglazing the pan with it. I add two cans of mushrooms. I put the chicken back in, covered, & simmered for 15 minutes in sauce. I removed the chicken and stirred one tablespoon butter into the sauce. No need to thicken unless you double the sauce and then just mix a TBSPN corn starch to a TSPN water & whisk til smooth, add to sauce. Repeat if necessary. Served over mashed potatoes. This is restaurant quality. One of these "knock 'em out of the park" recipes comes along every blue moon and you know it will become a go-to dish to impress or just to have a great meal at home. Can't say enough good about it.

UPDATE: I have made this at least 15 times now still with the above mentioned changes. Note that if you double the sauce do NOT double the brown sugar or it will be too sweet! Add a tspn at a time until it's your desired sweetness. Finish w/ pat of butter. Stellar recipe!

I think what a lot of people don't realize is that this recipe is for *3* pounds of chicken. That much wine and sugar would be a lot for most people who only make 4-5 thighs, breasts, but for the amount of chicken called for it seems just right. If you don't want to make it in such big quantities change the serving amounts..that should help.

This was amazing, but only because I cooked it according to what others suggested! First, I cut brown sugar in half and added that to wine and set aside. I sauteed 1 sliced onion, 1 cup sliced mushrooms and garlic initially, then removed from skillet.  Next, sprinkled chicken with salt, pepper and paprika, cooked in skillet till browned (about 5-6 min per side), topped with cooked mushrooms and onions, then poured wine and brown sugar mixture over top.  Covered and simmered 15 min., served and it was perfect!

I'm glad I cut the sugar back because I think it would have been too sweet with the full cup.  As a side I made rice and mixed in 1 can of mushrooms and 1 can of peas.  I poured some of the juice over the rice and the chicken and it was delicious!  My husband and my 3 year old really enjoyed this dish!

Fantastic recipe!  The glaze was a bit reminiscent of the Jack Daniels Glaze served at TGI Friday's.  I pretty much followed the recipe as written with a few exceptions.  I only browned the chicken rather than cooking it so long before adding the sauce.  Chicken breasts shouldn't cook that long or they become too dry.  Also, I took the lid off toward the end of the cooking time.  That gave the sauce a chance to thicken into a scrumptious glaze!  Very tasty and very easy!  We will have this again.

I noticed some of the reviews before me are a little unimpressed.  I think that's because of the cooking time...I've made this quite a few times and love it.  My advice to anyone out there is to read previous reviews and go with your gut.
I DON'T cook the chx as long as written; I start the sauce the second after I put all the chx in.  Figuring out how the get the wine to boil down into a sauce without drying the chx is hard, I've only done it once, but if you can get it to a gravy consistancey, great!  I always serve with white rice, and hog the "up for grabs" pieces from my family.  This is a gorging recipe for me.

This is a wonderfully easy recipe that just needed a few tweaks.  Some nice additions to the glaze are onions, mushrooms, and a bit of garlic.  I not only cut the brown sugar in half (per recommendation), I also added extra wine since the mushrooms will soak up a fair amount of the liquid.  Add the onions and garlic with the wine and sugar.  Add the mushrooms the last 5 - 10 minutes.  Went great with mashed potatoes and the Grean Bean and Mushroom Medely, also from this site.  Good luck!

Yummy!! I will definitely make this again and was pleasantly surprised at the taste. This would be good for company. It's quick and hard to screw up. Use less paprika if you're feeding little kids. I used 1/2 cup honey and left the lid off so the sauce could reduce and thicken up. Great with rice.

Very good recipe provided you make some of the adjustments suggested in the comments.  I rubbed the chicken with paprika, salt, and pepper before doing anything and let it sit then I sauteed onions, mushrooms, and garlic first and removed them before adding the chicken.  I cooked the chicken for about 5 minutes per side because it will continue to cook when simmering.  I used a little less than 1/4 cup of brown sugar (and it could have used even less, maybe just a few tablespoons!), added the vegetables back in, and added 1/2 cup wine.  After simmering covered for about 15 minutes I thickened the sauce with about a tablespoon of cornstarch.  The wine soaked mushrooms and onions were addictive and the chicken was moist and very flavorful.  Went well with roasted potatoes and carrots.

Don't follow the recipe, half the sugar and paprika and keep the lid off and this is very, VERY good.  Don't lose any of that liquid in the pan, you might want to pour it into a wine glass and drink it.  Yummmm!

I'm fairly certain that wine, when cooked, loses it's alcoholic properties, right??  Well, somehow, This particular recipe magically retains that special something that is Purely addictive!  As other have suggested, I halved the brown sugar & added sliced onions & mushrooms to the mix &....Oh My!!! We've rarely been the kind of family who eats til they're ready to explode but this meal? Simply could Not stop!  Be Warned - you Will love this dish.  Guaranteed.

I found this recipe to be very delicious and took the advice of others to use 1/2 wine, 1/2 chicken broth. Made it just right. I also cut back on the brown sugar ( 1/2 cup) and rubbed the chicken with the paprika and some seasoned salt and pepper and put it in fridge until I was ready to cook. I also used 1 cup of sliced sweet onions and browned them and the garlic in olive oil and removed them until the chicken was browned then added them back with the wine and the broth and brown sugar. 1/2 cup of sugar is plenty and for some maybe a tad less would work. I added the cornstarch just before serving and that worked well too. Hubby loved the whole dish. Served with rice and think next time will try mashed potatoes. Deeeelish.....

This did not go over well at all. The combination of overpowering sweetness and garlic were less than appealing. The wine needed reduction, having only been cooked covered for 20 minutes. Once reduced, the sweetness was cloying. I tried adding some reduced chicken stock, but sadly, that didn't salvage the dish. Ended up rescuing the chicken breasts, scraping all the sauce off and applying some tomato sauce and cheese. They were barely edible, as the sweet, winey flavor had permeated them completely.

This was pretty good but the chicken needed a little somthing extra.  The garlic is pointless since the brown sugar and red wine TOTALLY overpower the taste, so if you want to taste the garlic, throw a little more in.  Despite the fact that it looked like bruised chicken, it didn't taste that bad.

1 cup sugar and 1 cup water is the recipe for simple syrup.  If you mix 1 cup sugar with 1 cup red wine (which already has sugar in it, no matter how dry a wine it is), you are essentially covering your chicken in STRAIGHT SYRUP.  I halved the sugar and it was still too sweet (I saved it by adding chicken broth and more dry red wine). Also, garlic should NEVER be added at the beginning because it burns quickly. This could be great, but it requires such major alteration that you're no longer making the original recipe. I gave it two stars instead of one because it has *some* potential. As written-- TERRIBLE.

The flavor was pretty good, but I had some trouble with the garlic.  Adding it at the beginning, I found it started to burn before the chicken was done (not a great flavor...).  If I make this again, I will add it at the same time as the wine instead.

This is one of the best chicken recipes I've had in a while. It is so juicy and flavorful. Just make sure you make left overs because it just gets better! It basically marinates over night and makes it even more flavorful. I used 3 lbs of chicken, 2/3 C of wine, 2 tsp. paprika and 1/4 C brown sugar. The paprika and brown sugar was plenty, that's the only thing I would change (original recipe calls for quite a bit more sugar — not needed). Make it, you won't regret it!

This was good, but not as good as I was hoping.  I did take other reviewers' advice and I cut back the sugar and the wine a bit.  The sauce was very yummy and my family loved it- especially my kids.  It tastes a little bit like a teriyaki sauce because of the brown sugar.  I don't know that the cooking method and time was quite right.  I questioned it initially because it seemed long for chicken breasts, but then decided to follow the recipe and so I ended up with fairly dry chicken.  If I do this again I will give the chicken a quick sear, then make the sauce and add the chicken back to the pan for a couple minutes.

This was just AWFUL!!!!!  It is too bad because there was so much potential for this recipe.  It is WAY TOO SWEET!!!!  My recommendation is a tablespoon of sugar for the 1/3 cup of wine. It just amazes me the number of people how rated this recipe so high.  For those who would like to try it, my suggestion is to proceed with caution.

This was good...with some changes that I made.  I reduced the amount of brown sugar to 1/2.  I didn't want something too sweet.  I also added some mushrooms.  I served this over roasted garlic red potatoes and it was delicious.  Will continue to make again and again.  Thanks for the post.

First, I scaled this to 3 servings and used boneless skinless chicken. I added extra garlic and also threw in a Vidalia onion. I browned the chicken, not fully cooked though. I then added my brown sugar, halving as I tasted my wine, a cabernet, as it was a somewhat sweeter wine. I cooked it as directed for 5 minutes and lowered it and added fresh, sliced Baby Bellas. Covered and finished cooking. Came out moist and delicious! I aroma is just to die for! Served with plain ol' mashed potatoes and green beans. Will make again! Oh, and if you use a bad wine it will turn out bad...it's the golden rule with cooking...never cook with a wine you won't drink, because when the alcohol cooks off, all you are left with is the flavor!

Easy to make, however, as earlier reviewers mention the brown sugar called for is too much. Cut back and season the chicken when browning helps.

I cut the brown sugar in half (per the recommendations), and the BF and I both agreed that it was still too sweet. I added two small onions and sauteed them with the chicken. I did add 1 tablespoon of butter to the wine sauce, and some corn starch to thicken. I served over pasta, but it didn't really compliment well. If I made it again, I would probably use 1/4 cup brown sugar, keep the sweet cream butter, add whipping cream and a small amount of corn starch-- that combination would probably go well with pasta. I served it with garlic bread and spinach.

This is one of my "go-to" recipes.  My husband and I love it. I double the wine and keep the whole cup of brown sugar - we like sauce. I chop onion and mushrooms and saute with the garlic. Also, to make the sauce a little thicker I remove some of the wine liquid, add some corn starch, and slowly stir back in. We serve over egg noodles. Yummmmy!

I tried this thinking it would be fantastic and it just wasn't. I had to cut down on the sugar by more than half and it was still too sweet. The sauce was also very runny. I wouldn't recommend this one.

This is definitely a 5-star dish with some modifications and is one of the best new chicken recipes I have tried in a long time.  I made a half recipe and only used 1/4 cup brown sugar which was just right.  First, I sauteed 6 or 7 mushrooms and a small sliced onion with the minced garlic in 1 T. olive oil + 1/2 T. butter, then removed to a bowl, sauteed the chicken (not quite to fully cooked), and then simmered all together in the sauce (used 3/4 c. red wine + 1 c. chicken broth---in a half recipe) thickened with 1 T. cornstarch.  By reducing the brown sugar, adding mushrooms and onions, and making extra, thickened sauce this recipe is a winner. I also added pepper and parsley.  The chicken has lots of flavor and is very moist & tender.  Definitely plan on serving this with noodles or mashed potatoes to accompany all the flavorful sauce.

I think I made a slight error and combined all the sauce ingredients and poured them over the chicken to cook -- the result was a very yummy sauce and no purple chicken (which is a good thing!) This was a very easy recipe, I might consider adding a little red pepper flakes to jazz it up a bit or change out the paprika for chili powder instead.

Was ok, my son didn't like the sauce at all, though he is very fussy.  I felt the chicken was very dry, but maybe I just overcooked it.

This is a great base recipe, but I seldom ever use a recipe exactly as it's written because I like to adjust to my family's tastes. I reduced the brown sugar to 1/4 c, added butter when I was sauteeing the garlic and added fresh mushrooms and onions in the mix along with rubbed sage, rosemary & thyme. Before I put the chicken in with the veggies I sprinkled the paprika, salt, and pepper on the chicken. Cooked in my stainless steel pan on stove top on medium heat for about 12 minutes then put in the oven at 400 for about 35-40 minutes and thickened the sauce with cornstarch and used it to coat my spaghetti noodles and served with chicken on top and baked garlic and cheese pita chips. I also used Burgandy cooking wine because we don't drink and that's all I ever have on hand, but it gave it an amazing flavor. Was very yummy. Family ate it up! Thanks for the recipe!

This is a really quick, easy and tasty recipe. I followed other reviewers advise and reduce the paprika and the brown sugar by half, and the wine to 3/4 cup and in 30 minutes I had an excellent meal that looked like it had been order at a restaurant, I served the chicken over a garlic and basil fettucine and the drizzle a bit of the sauce on top and it was amazing...Thanks for an amazing recipe and to the reviewers who for their suggestions.

Not very flavorful...I think it would be better if you marinated it instead of adding the wine after already searing the chicken.

An OK recipe, but it is way too sweet. (I should have read these reviews first!) Try adding mushrooms to the sauce; it's a nice addition

I used chicken thighs and was browning them when I was reminded that I had an appointment to keep so I put the chicken in a crockpot, mixed the sauce ingredient in a bowl (upped wine to 1 1/2 cups with same 1 cup brown sugar + extra crushed garlic), poured it in and set the crockpot on high.  I came home 2 hrs later, spooned the chicken out, stirred a roux into the liquid, and mixed chicken back into the pot after sauce thickened up.  It was absolutely delicious.  I brought some into work for lunch the next day and a friend of mine wanted to trade lunch.

I thought this was a great recipe.  I took the advice of others and added some chopped onion.   I only used 1/2 cup of brown sugar which seemed to be a perfect amount.  My husband's only complaint was that there wasn't enough of the sauce.  He wanted more to mix in with the angel hair pasta and chicken. I agree.   Also, the chicken was a tad bit dry, so next time I will cut back on the cooking time.  Quick, easy and very tasty meal.

I loved this recipe! Like others, I made changes.  I sauteed onion with the garlic, used thigh meat instead of breast (doesn't dry out as much during the long cook time), used only 1/2 cup brown sugar, and used 1 cup Marsala wine. I also seasoned the chicken with seasoned salt and garlic salt while browning. I simmered with the lid off. My husband liked it so much he asked me to fix it again the next day!

good basic recipe. i had no paprika so i used greek seasoning. added sauteed thinly sliced onions & a can of drained mushrooms & 2 tbs of flour to thicken up the mix a bit. also cooked with the lid off to aid in the thickening. i bet this would be good with some thinly sliced beef as well

The dish ended up turning out really well, but I made too many adjustments to give it 5 stars.  First I cut the chicken into small pieces and coated them with pepper, paprika and granulated garlic.  I put in more wine than suggested (because I wanted to use the rest of my bottle) and I'd definitely use a dry wine - pinot noir is not the best for this dish!  I also added cornstarch to thicken the sauce and sliced in some onion rings for more flavor.  It didn't taste exactly right so I added some soy sauce and BAM!  Instantly tasty. I'll definitely make it again.

This was a decent recipe, although I didn't find it to be spectacular.  The sauce was a little too sweet, even though I cut the amount of sugar by half.  Still, it is tasty and easy.

YUM!  This is an easy variation on the French favourite coq au vin.  I've made this over 10x already and everyone who I've made it for has loved it.  I like to add some onions and carrots to it, I sautee them first a little in some water and wine to get them to soften and then add them to this dish.  I have yet to find someone who doesn't love this dish!

Add plenty of a nice red wine - keep adding it and reduce it back for a thicker, richer sauce.

Following the advice of several others, I made changes to this recipe. It turned out delicious! I started by sauteeing half an onion and a pound of fresh mushrooms. I removed them from the pan and then browned 5 chicken breasts which were seasoned on both sides with paprika, salt & pepper. I removed them from the pan, sauteed 2 cloves of garlic (about a teaspoon), and re-added the chicken with vegetables. Then, in went 1/2 cup merlot, 1/2 cup chicken stock and 1/4 cup brown sugar. Cook covered for 20 minutes on low-med heat, turning the chicken once. I served with steamed green beans, roasted potato wedges, and green salad. Rave reviews! Thanks everyone for helping me make a wonderful dinner!

Delicious! I really enjoyed this recipe. I did cut the brown sugar down to a half of a cup, based on other reviews, and it was PERFECT! Just the right amount of sweetness. My boyfriend loved it as well, so I definitely will be making this dish again.

This was pretty darn good after halving the sugar (I didn't have brown sugar) and adding a little molasses. I used red cooking wine as well which may have helped keep the sweetness down as it has salt added. A little runny, but that can be remedied next time. I cut up various vegetables to cook in the wine sauce. Very good! Definitely something I'll make again! (The only downside was the garlic. It burned before I got the chicken in the pan and couldn't taste it much as others have said. I will probably just brown the chicken next time and add the wine as soon as possible.)

I followed the directions of sheinshine with a twist and it was a hit!  I used boneless skinless thighs and seasoned the chicken before browning it with seasoning salt and cayenne.  I then removed it from the pan and sautéed ONIONS and garlic in the pan drippings.  From there, added just 1/2 cup of red wine and 1/2 cup of chicken broth and 1/4 cup of brown sugar (instead of putting it directly in the chicken).  I let it come to a boil, stirred in a tablespoon of cornstarch to thicken up the sauce.  Then I put the chicken back in the pan to simmer 10 minutes per side.   I had planned on sautéing spinach to go with it, but got lazy, so I just added it to the chicken when there was just 3 minutes left.  Great 1-pot meal (though I decided to serve it over brown rice--so not quite one-pot). DELICIOUS

This was really delicious!  We love red wine, so I figured I couldn't go wrong with this recipe.  I added in a few extra cloves of garlic and reduced the brown sugar to just half a cup.  I added about a teaspoon of cornstarch/water mixture to thicken up the sauce at the end and served it with steamed broccoli and garlic mashed potatoes (we also love garlic)!

This is so good my kids always ask me to make this dish! The only change I make is to use boneless skinless chicken thighs rather than breasts because. The thighs add a little extra flavor & are so moist they are basically fool-proof to cook. I usually use Pinot Noir for the wine but have used several other reds always with great results. I usually serve this with Roasted Garlic Mashed potatoes also from this site & a side salad. Delicious!

I cannot TELL you how impressed I am with this recipe. First time I made it exactly as written and it turned out great! Chicken was flavorful, TENDER, and even re-heated well (still moist!). Next time I may reduce the brown sugar to make the sauce a bit less sweet and experiment with increasing the garlic, but that's just nit-picking; boyfriend & I both liked this & it is a keeper!!! (Also, with the pan I was using I was unable to drain the oil, so I just added the other ingredients to it and I really don't think it made a difference on taste while saving a step.)

This is very similar tasting to a honey & Dijon mustard recipe on here however I find this to be the superior recipe.  It is sweet like the other recipe but not as cloying.  I didn't have a regular red wine so I used a nice Taylor Port.  I should have added a bit more salt since the port was much sweeter then a usual red.  There was just enough sauce to toss with noodles.  Yummy!

This was great! However, I did some alterations based on reviews:
--added 1 small onion, sliced
--added sliced mushrooms.
Sauteed onion, shrooms, and garlic together in oil until mushrooms were soft and onions were browned. Removed veggies and set aside; browned chicken in pan after sprinkling with salt and pepper

--reduced paprika to 1 1/2 tsp
--reduced brown sugar to 1/4 cup
--put in 1/2 cup of red wine (all i had left) and 1/2 cup chicken broth

Everything simmered (cover on) for 15 minutes; I added a bit of cornstarch at the end to make a thicker sauce. 

Taste is great!!! Slightly Asian in flavor. I will definitely be making this again.

Excellent.  I scaled this down to 2 servings and used a bone-in chicken breast.  I added half an onion and sauteed it with garlic.  I added a few Tbsp brown sugar (less than called for).  It was very moist and tender.  I served it with rice and green beans.  My husband and I both loved it.  I will make this again.

I give this 4 stars as written. It is very good, but needs some additions. Less brown sugar as others suggested. I added onions, but believe mushrooms would be a great addition as well. Also, crushed red pepper pods to add some spice. I also used some cornstarch mixed in water to thicken the sauce. Salt & pepper a must. I will make this again.

Big hit. Cut back wine (cheap stuff) and brown sugar to 3/4 cup. Sauteed onions, mushrooms, and couple TBL of chopped red pepper before browning chicken and added back for last 10 min. Blended in about one TBL of corn starch to thicken sauce a bit. Served with rice, peas, cornbread.

This was really good and so easy!  It is a little sweet but I liked it that way.  I love the hint of wine through the sweetness.  I will definitely make this again.

My boyfriend and I loved this recipe. I was worried my bf might not like the sauce because he isn't a big red wine fan, but he thought it was great. I didn't have paprika, so I sprinkled a little cayenne pepper on the chicken because I seem to think it's a good substitute for paprika and we like a little kick. Then I used about 3/4 cup of brown sugar (as others have suggested) but I think a cup would still taste great. This is a fabulous recipe and a great way to use some not-so-good red wine. I will definitely make this again and next time I'm going to add some mushrooms.

great recipe! But I did make my own adjustments. I used double the garlic because I love garlic! I used chicken wings instead because I didn't have any breast. I seasoned well with paprika, garlic salt, pepper & dried rosemary.. I dredged in a bit of flour before browning, to get a great color & also I knew it would thicken the sauce later so I wouldn't have to use cornstarch. Next time I will definitely add mushrooms & onion as suggested by others. Instead of the cup of sugar, which I think would b too sweet, I just sprinkled a small handful over the top of the chicken.. I also didn't cook the chicken for 10mins on each side, I just browned it on both sides then added the wine. I used a Shiraz which was great. I simmered for longer than 20mins because I didn't cook the chicken through. I think it was better this way because it gave the sauce & chicken time to really cook down nicely. Served with rice & green beans! Yumm

Delicious and easy.  First dredged chicken in flour seasoned with salt, pepper and garlic powder, but the flour was probably not necessary. Sauteed onions and garlic first, then chicken in olive oil 3 min. each side. Added everything else (reduced sugar to less than 1/4 cup and it was still really sweet), plus some baby carrots and mushrooms. Followed others' tip to add some cornstarch to thicken sauce at the end. YUMMY!!! Husband enjoyed it a lot and he is not a fan of chicken.

I really wanted to like this recipe.  I made it exactly as written.  It is very odd to eat purple chicken, and the paprika tastes....not quite right.  It has one star for the first night I finished my plate.  **Just a thought, but if you change 6 or 7 things when you make a recipe, does that recipe still get 5 stars?  It isn't really even the same recipe any more...is it?

Oh my gosh!  This was fantastic.  I am not a fan of red wine, and was a little "worried".  The combination of red wine with the brown sugar was unbelievable.  I added sliced onions during the last 10 minutes of simmering, had to used breasts w/bones (due to hurricane Ike we take what we can get at the grocery store)and served over egg noodles on a large platter.  Looked and tasted wonderful.

This was terrific! We loved it. I added some mushrooms to it and cut down on the brown sugar as others suggested. One other thing I did since I still thought it to be too sweet was I added a little bit of cayenne pepper. I served this on top of some angel hair pasta and garlic green beans as a side dish. A great meal!

Yum! We loved this! I used whole chicken pieces and they needed quite a bit more time. I reduced the brown sugar to 1/3 cup - no more was needed - and the paprika to 2 tsp. I also threw some mushrooms in with the garlic and that was a great addition. Thanks for a winner.

I don't understand why this recipe is rated so highly by so many people.  I didn't have a problem with dryness (used chicken thigh and reduced cooking time by a LOT) but both hubby and I found it way too sweet.  I should've reduced the sugar by at least half.

this was very good.  I read the reviews, and  followed some  of the suggestions, and added a couple of things of my own.  I simply browned the chicken, did not cook it through to reduce the dryness some peole complained of.   I added only a sprinkle of brown sugar on each breast, and then added a couple of  tbsps of honey.  I also  diluted the wined half and half with chicken broth, and added a heaping tbsp of frozen orange juice concentrate.   Then after throwing in a few sliced  muchrooms, I proceeded as directed, and  it turned out beautifully.  My husband  and I both enjoyed it very much.

This was a good recipe, but WAY too sweet.  Definitely use less sugar - probably half next time.  Also, I think mushrooms would be a nice additional too.

I had some leftover red zinfandel which tasted horrible out of the bottle, but in this dish, it tasted terrific.  Very easy and very good.  Full of flavor.  I think a deep red works the best. Also reheated well.

Gourmet! This is better than any chicken I've had in a restaurant! I only used 1 1/2 lb. of chicken though so cut down the rest of the ingredients accordingly and from the reviews cut down even more on the brown sugar, I used 1/2 cup. My hubby and I loved it!

This was great!  We became members just to rate this one recipe.  We added mushrooms while simmering and they soaked up a lot of flavor.  We sliced the chicken and served it over rice.  I can't wait for company to come so that I can serve them this chicken!

This recipe is so amazing. I made this for my husband and my parents when they came over. I always try to find recipes to impress my mom who is the super-cook in the family and everyone loved it! It was sweet and tangy and great with wild rice. This was entered into my book of favorite recipes! Thanks so much! I make this for guests and its always elegant and yummy!!

This was really good.  I made it for Valentine's Day for my husband, and we both really enjoyed it.  I served it with garlic & herb risotto from Betty Crocker and it was delicious!

I thought this was excellent, though I used just a crumbling of sugar over the top. I also think it would be great if you threw in some mushrooms or brasied some veggies like brussel sprouts or endives. I used a Tuscan Sangiovese and it was simple and flavorful. Impress someone tonight!

The ingredients in this recipe did not sound that good together but I was fabulously surprised.  Very tasty and low fat!  I ended up sauteing the chicken and then baking the chicken in the oven in the red wine.  I will definately make this recipe again! Great!

This calls for a lot of brown sugar. If I make this again I would reduce the sugar by half. It is too sweet.

We really enjoyed this recipe and served it next to a mushroom pilaf (from foodnetwork). Ok, full disclosure..this is a great excuse to open a bottle of wine on a weeknight.  I didn't measure the paprika or brown sugar; instead I just rubbed it on until it seemed "right" for me.

Excellent simple dish that was delicious. I used boneless thigh meat, which worked just fine. I used leftover shiraz and like the other reviewers, I cut back on the brown sugar. 1/2 cup was still a bit too sweet so I will try 1/3 next time. Ran out of paprika so even w/o it, it was still yummy. I accidentally overcooked the chicken in the wine and brown sugar but adding in some chicken broth and scrapping the dry bits and mixing it saved the day. Had a tasty caramelized flavor. Also added the cornstarch (per another reviewer) to thicken the sauce at the end, after removing the chicken.

I just made this; it was good. Husband went back for seconds. I cut way back on the sugar, just about a quarter cup (I also was using about a lb and a half of chicken tenders), and it was still a bit sweet for my taste. I used a nice Chianti for the red wine. No complaints there. I think I would make this again with less sugar and add onions and mushrooms, but other than that, it was a quick dish. My husband had requested chicken piccata, and all I had was red wine, so I looked up chicken and red wine and found this. I'd make it again.

This came out quite tasty!  I did not follow the exact recipe.  I used less brown sugar (I sprinkled it in til I liked it), and then added some veggies and whole grain pasta.  Came out great! I would definitely make this again.

I loved this recipe!  Following the advice of others, I salt and peppered the chicken first, then dredged in salt and peppered flour.

Browned the chicken, added half an onion, garlic and mushrooms.  ONLY added a heaping tablespoon of sugar and 3/4 cup of Merlot.

Sides:  Mashed potatoes, steamed broccoli and of course the unused Merlot :)

Delicious!

I was hesitant to try this because of all the mixed reviews, but it was excellent!  I seasoned the chicken with seasoned salt, pepper, and onion powder before cooking.  I also decreased the brown sugar and paprika by half.  I was still afraid it would be too sweet, but it wasn't.  I served the chicken on top of spaghetti, which absorbed the extra sauce.  Make sure to use good wine!

I read some of the other reviews before making and this turned out great!  I used 1/4 cup of brown sugar & just 3 chicken breasts - i also used 1/2 cup of red wine (a malbec) and 1/2 cup of reduced sodium chicken broth as the liquid. I also let it reduce by leaving the lid off of the pan for about 5 minutes toward the end to make more of a syrup to coat the chicken on the plates.  This was a definite winner and I will be making this again - I may try it in a crock pot next time :)

Everything turned out really great except for the amount of sauce the recipe made. Not sure what happened. I took all the recommendations I read from previous reviews. I started out sprinkling salt, pepper, & paprika over the chicken about a half hour before. Browned the chicken first (did not cook all the way through, about 5 mins only) then added the garlic right before adding the wine sauce. I also cut the wine in half w/chicken broth and simply sprinkled brown sugar over the chicken. The taste was really great! Only problem was it barely made any leftover sauce on the side for our noodles. I think next time I will add more wine/chicken broth & not leave the lid off the entire time during the simmer.

I am a new cook and this was the first time I cooked chicken breast ever (I know!!!) It worked really well. My observations:
1. Pounding the chicken breast to make thickness even is really important (ok this might be obvious to experienced folks)
2. I sprinkled salt on chicken before placing it on the skillet
3. I used only enough brown sugar to brush both sides of chicken and for me, the result wasn’t discernibly sweet and that suited me just fine
4. I used wine exactly as mentioned 
5. I turned the chicken midway to get both sides caramelized 
Thanks a ton for posting this recipe – I am so nervous about cooking and this attempt open whole new door for me. I took a photo but unable to upload it

I adapted this recipe for the slow cooker added more fresh garlic, sliced onions and didn't use the paprika. I halved the wine and sugar. So easy and served with mashed potatoes, it was great.

Here is my version from last night let me first say I hate meat and almost never eat it I am sad to say I cleaned my plate.. I only used 4 chicken thighs skin on I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, paprika garlic powder browned the chicken in my Dutch oven with oil and a tad of butter did not cook it all the way, removed it and tossed the skin yuck, tossed in some onions & the brown sugar (1/4 cup) I know wrong place but his is how I brown my onions I think it can take less. Let them brown for a while then added mushrooms brown, Drained off all the fat left in the pot. I added 1 cup stock scraped up all the bits added the wine I used 1/2 cup wine (pinot noir). Set the burner on 3 cooked for an hour or so turning once. Took out the chicken here is where I must have read too many recipes I had thought it called for a corn starch slurry. So I mixed some starch with water added it to the broth tossed the chicken back in and let it do its thing till veggies were done. Happy mistake as this amazing concoction was just thick enough to stick to the chicken and potatoes yum yum yum thanks so much I was no trying to insult you with the changes this is a keeper it made my husband want to lick his plate clean

This one has become a favorite with my husband, who says he could eat this recipe every day. Unlike other reviews, I actually added a little more brown sugar while cooking, and it did not come out too sweet at all. I have made this twice now, following the recipe almost exactly. The only changes I made were I added some garlic infused dressing while cooking the chicken and did not cover the chicken while cooking as suggested by others. The result was flavorful, easy chicken that my husband thought had been marinating all
day due to the infusion of flavors. I will definitely be making this again!

Wonderful recipe.First of all, the original recipe was for 12 servings.So, most of the changes I read, all closely match when you change the serving size to 5-6.To reduce cooking time for the chicken, and add flavor I cut the breasts lengthwise to about 1/4 to 1/2" thick,dusted with paprika and salt then  dredged in flour/paprika/salt/garlic powder and set aside.Removed chicken and added onion, salt and pepper to skillet...after a few minutes, added garlic.While cooking onion, zapped a can of diced tomatoes in the processor just to break them up a little...then a tsp or (or 1 cube) of chicken bouillon(without water due to the liquid of tomatoes)Added 1/4 cup of "light" brown sugar and about 1/2 cup Cabernet Sauvignon and about a 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper.Once it reduced a little, I added the mushrooms,then had to add a little water and wine. Let that cook for 5m and added the chicken back, spooning to coat. Since the chicken was thin, it was ready in only a few minutes....Delicious.The kids loved it. I did use a whole onion and two large cloves of garlic...it was perfect. I really think the tomatoes add body to it.Thanks again for all of your comments...what a success. The only other tip I have is the flour dredge being seasoned with paprika and salt and garlic, took care of the thickening issue some had at the end. Plus since the chicken was so thin, I didnt have to add it till the end anyway. It was juicy, fork tender and full of flavor.

Nothing special.  I cut down on the sugar as recommended by other reviewers.  It was still too sweet for me although the house smelled so wonderful.  Easy prep, though.  I will not be making this again.

Wow, I felt like I made a gourmet dish! Really enjoyed this dish with a side of petite green beans and pearl onions.  
I didn't follow the recipe exactly however. I actually read a lot of the reviews and took bits of what other reviewers shared they had done with the recipe.  Didn't shy away too much from the recipe. If you enjoy wine you have to try this recipe!

Used a little less sugar and a smidge more wine. Turned out fantastic, and nearly effortless.

A simple and delicious dish.  I came across this recipe when I was searching for a way to get rid of some leftover red wine in my fridge.  I made it with 12 chicken wings and have followed other users' comments to cut down the brown sugar to 1/4 cup.  I also fried the chicken first, took it out, made the sauce by first sauteeing onions and garlic before adding the chicken back to the sauce.

This was delish EVEN though I totally screwed it up...Note to all cooks:  Splenda Brown Sugar DOES NOT measure the way regular brown sugar does lol!
 Even though it was crazy sweet, this was still easy and delicious.  Serve over noodles and with a crusty bread to dip in the sauce, yum!! :)

Simple and delicious. I cut the recipe in half and followed the instructions as written. I used red cooking wine. The second time I made it, I omitted the salt and pepper and it still tasted great!

Also used less than a cup of sugar and wine, for only 3 lbs of chicken?! spiced chicken and cooked with garlic before adding the sugar and wine.

Good recipe... But it's missing something. I wasn't sure what... Maybe some cayenne? It had savory tastes, but the end of each bite left a little something wanting. Slightly bland.

I made it with only 1/4 cup of brown sugar and I used a Todd Taylor Zinfandel. I added 1 sweet, white onion and a package of sliced mushrooms, and I served it over egg noodles. The mushrooms were AMAZING, but again... something was missing. I'll remake with a kick and update another time.

This is excellent over penne. I did reduce sugar a lot (to about 1 tbsp) and doubled the paprika.  I also added a chopped red bell pepper a little bit of bacon to the sauce.

In addition reducing the sugar to 1/4 cup, I used half cup wine and half cup chicken stock.  Also I cooked down the onions and mushrooms as others suggested.  My own tweaks were to dredge the chicken tenders into flour, s&p, before a quick run through the oil which thickened the sauce.  I also added about 1/4 cup of soy sauce and a shake of tabasco to the sauce.  I put it all together in a baking dish and popped it in the oven for about 20 minutes @350 to let it all work together and served it with rice and broccoli.  My husband said it was the best thing I have ever made.

Should remove chicken before adding the wine to prevent purple chicken.  Then add wine and brown sugar, reduce, add flour and milk to create a tasty sauce.  

When cooking chicken add a cup of diced onions, garlic, and mushrooms.

This was delish!  However I altered the serving size to 4, and there was very little sauce.  Next time I may follow the original recipe.  Even though I don't cook as much chicken.

My family loved it!  Cut the paprika to make it more mild.  Still went with all the wine and sugar and added some chicken broth for more sauce.  I dredged my chicken in flour salt and pepper before sauteing in the pan, this helps make the sauce thicker. Thanks for a great recipe.

As others suggested I altered the recipe; only using 1/2 of the brown sugar and wine as called for and doubling the garlic. I think I slightly overcooked the sauce but it still went over wonderful! Everyone liked it, including the kids. I served it with steamed white rice and broccoli and it fit wonderfully. Will make again!

I followed other reviewers’ advice and cut back on the sugar.  For 2 lbs. of chicken, used about 1/2 cup brown sugar, 2 tsp. paprika and 1 cup wine.  I also used some cornstarch to thicken it after removing the chicken.  The chicken & sauce looks sumptuous as well as tasting good.

This was delicious ... Instead of chicken I made meaballs with diced onions in them.  For the sauce, I added sauteed onions and mushrooms, used sherry and chicken broth because i didn't have red wine, I used much less sugar, and threw in some cayenne pepper--just a tiny bit, enough to give it a mild 'bite' along with the sweet. Served over mashed potatoes.  Delicious!  I only gave 4 stars because the original recipe should have included sauteed onions and mushrooms, in my humble opinion.

Good recipe! Used smoked paprika and a nice dry red wine. Substituted Sucanat for brown sugar. Overall nice flavor. Would make again but next time I would add some red pepper flakes  for a little spice. My husband thought it was good and the house smelled great while it cooked.  Served with mushroom almond wild rice and roasted broccoli.

Oh this recipe was so delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly and it was just so simple and divine.  I am going to try to modify it so that I can make it with a whole chicken in a pyrex and not a skillet. I know it won't be the same but I have a lot of guests coming and I'm sure they will love it.  Wish me luck.

Excellent! I followed a few others suggestions and made the following changes. I sauteed onion w/ the garlic. I sprinkled the paprika on the chicken w/ salt and pepper while browning. I reduced the amount of wine and sugar by half and added a 1/2 c. chicken broth. The next time I make it, though, I will reduce the sugar even further...probably down to a 1/4 c. I also added a can of mushrooms.  Also...I think I will double the sauce next time. I served this over pasta (think I will try mashed potatoes next time), buttered Rosemary rolls, and a salad. Hubby said you couldn't get a better meal in a restaurant.

I made this recipe tonight, but added a little butter to the olive oil, a few sliced mushrooms and half an onion.  It tasted just okay to my husband and I, but the kids loved it.  I felt as though it needed much less sugar.  It tasted like teriyaki chicken, which was not what I was expecting for a red wine chicken.

I followed this recipe exactly, and I think it has potential with some changes.  As is, it was very sweet, and lacked flavor.  It didn't even taste like wine sauce.  I'd agree with other reviewers and reduce the sugar, and add some onions and thicken the sauce with corn starch next time.

Recalculate the servings to get the appropriate proportion for the sauce for your meal.  It was okay, too sweet I think.  Reminds me of a thick, sweet teriyaki sauce. I won't make this again.

Although I forgot to add the paprika, I'm giving this recipe 5 stars.  I browned skinless, boneless chicken tenders (seasoned with salt, pepper and garlic powder) in olive oil.  I removed them and deglazed the pan with 1/4 cup chicken broth.  I then added 3/4 cup "jug" red wine and 1/4 cup brown sugar.  I boiled the results until reduced by half, returned the chicken to the pan to glaze a bit.  I scattered chopped green onions on top as a garnish.  Excellent!

Totally awesome. I too halfed the brown sugar, but I also did something a little different when the chicken was done. I removed the chicken from the pan, added more wine and more sugar, and a little flour to make a glaze. yummmmmm.

This totally didn't do it for me. The chicken was just rather dry and the sauce not all that remarkable.

SO good. The red wine sauce was outstanding, NO LEFTOVERS!
I did modify by cutting up the chicken in bite sized pieces.  I also added a lot of black pepper to offset the sweetness of the brown sugar.

Not awful but really disappointing. The reviews with this one are all over the board so I encourage trying it if you are interested. To us, it tasted like chicken cooked in red wine. The "sauce" was awkward with the chicken and didn't enhance the taste of the chicken at all.

Very nice flavor.  I didn't have the paprika but I did sprinkle on some Italian seasoning and a little garlic salt.  I did cut back some on the brown sugar and it was good.  I like brown sugar in meals but find that many recipes seem to call for too much of it, making it a little too sweet. I served with couscous and drizzled some of the sauce on it.

This was tastey but we found it a little too sweet!  I even added a tad less brown sugar.  The sauce was a little too soupy also.  I prepared this with some garlic rice which helped with the sweetness as the rice was a little bitter.  Together we enjoyed it greatly!  My suggestion... if you make this recipe , prepare something that is not sweet at all to go with it!

Liked this recipe very much.  I used a red merlot and more garlic than what was called for and this added great flavor.  I agree with others who said the sauce was a bit to sweet.  I cut the amount of brown sugar down by below half and still seemed on the too sweet side as i poured it over pasta.  The Chicken, however was Terrific and will make it again.

Pretty good - I served it with green beans and couscous.  Chicken in red wine comes out looking a little ugly most of the time, but for me it turned out okay

Very disappointing.  Sorry, way too sweet and I usually like sweet meals.  Flavors did not blend well.  Will not make again.  No one at my table ate it .........except my husband.  He didn't like it but didn't want to waste.  Sorry.

I loved this!  I used a nice, mellow Merlot wine and it turned out fantastic-- not to sweet at all.  Also added mushrooms and onions with the garlic.  Pulled it all out at the end and thickened the sauce up a bit with some flour and poured over the top.

Wow, this turned out fanstastic with all of my adjustments to the recipe. I'm sure the original recipe is delicious, but I just couldn't help myself. I saute'd garlic, onion, red bell peppers in little olive oil until softened. Now don't freak, but I added diced pecans, browning just a little before I added the chicken breasts. Once the chicken was clear of red juices I poured in 1/2 Merlot, 1/2 seasoned broth, and 1/2 brown sugar. We ate this over white Thai rice and it was to die for. It heated up really nicely in the oven the next day at 350 degrees. Thanks for sharing!

My husband and daughters wolfed this down like they hadn't eaten all day (not true!)...there wasn't a scrap left!  The only change I made was to thicken the sauce with about a teaspoon of cornstarch (mixed with 2T wine and added near the end).  I'm adding this one to the "permanent file."

YIKES!!  I cannot imagine using one cup of brown sugar for this recipe!  I took the advice of the review by "Sheinshine" and I was so glad I did!  I used 1/4 cup of brown sugar, onions, mushrooms, half low-salt chicken broth with half wine, and thickened the sauce with cornstarch.  Actually, my adult son & I made this recipe together.  My husband is used to me always trying new recipes, but only a few end up being "keepers".  We got thumbs up on this one!!

I used the same ingredients, only using a whole chicken, & cooking it in the crock pot with potatoes, & it was pretty good.  There was plenty of tasty leftover chicken for Chicken Salad Sandwiches the next night! Two meals in one...I'm game for that!

This chicken was fantastic!  I added a little more brown sugar than was called for though.  It was almost like candy it seemed to melt in your mouth.  I would recommend this to anyone.

Very good, different.  The sauce is thin but you don't need it on the chicken after it's simmered in it for 15 minutes.  I will definately make it again.

The first time I made it - it came out too sweet.  Then I made it again using almost half the sugar that the recipe calls for and it tasted so good!!!  I guess this is for people that are into really sweet food..if you are not then use less sugar than what it says!!

This was okay.  I followed the reciped exactly and the chicken came out very dry and the sauce very sweet.  If I do make this again I will decrease the amount of sugar.  I also found that there was too little oil while cooking the chicken, perhaps that is why it was so dry.  My house had alot of smoke from the braising chicken.  This was good but not the best.  I am not sure if I will make this again.

This was a very flavorful recipe, one of the best I've ever tried! I marinated in seasonings and a little of the red wine for 1/2 hr and only used a sprinkle of paprika and enough brown sugar to coat each breast. Excellent Dish, Thanks Robin!

This was much sweeter than I expected. The title red wine is misleading. Overall,
it was good.

Wow, delicious and easy. I didn't have paprika, and threw a bag of frozen stir fry veggies into the pan to simmer, served over rice, and it was great.

Surprisingly tasty.  I have a bad habit of recipes not working for me (no matter how hard I try to follow the directions); this one works and tastes extremely good.  But, I would suggest not using the full 1.5 cups of sugar.

One of my favorite ways to prepare chicken!! I recommend keeping the sauce you cook the chicken in to dip. The breasts are a bit dry without it, and it enhances the flavor. I also recommend using thighs instead of breasts, and remember, SAVE THE SAUCE!!

This is soooo good!  I changed a few things.  1.Used Chicken tenders requiring less cooking time because they are breast cut into thin pieces. 2.used a little less sugar and more wine (Rich Red Blend). 3. Sprinkle salt and pepper 45 minutes before cooking.  My Husband and I agreed it was delicious.

Too sweet and oddly tasting.  I even cut down the sugar like a lot of people suggested.  Perhaps I used the wrong type of wine, and I'd be interested in seeing what everyone else uses.  But until then I'm not going to try with different types or red wines until its good.

This recipe is a favorite! I seasoned the chicken with 2 teaspoon of salt and 1 teaspoon of black pepper and paprika before cooked. Followed the recipe from there and it was amazing! Will definitely cook again.

Tasty & fast with only a few ingredients.  I used chopped green pepper and onion with the garlic to sauté.  Added a little more red wine. I also  thickened the sauce with a teaspoon of flour dissolved in cold water towards end of cooking time.  Not a speck left!!!

Substituted 1/4 cup honey & 1 teaspoon molasses for the sugar (rest of the family don't eat Brown sugar).  Added 2 tablespoons of fresh ginger. Extra cup of red wine and 1 tablespoon Tamari sauce. Simmered to reduced the sauce almost to a glaze.  Little different, but Very delicious.

Loved this!  My family was a little nervous about it but then tried it and loved it! I did take advice from other reviews and mixed some of the sauce with cornstarch to make the sauce thicker.  Also added mushrooms and onions, sauteed them first and then added them when I added the wine.

I thought this dish was excellent. Not quite sure why the other reviewers thought it was overly sweet; I thought it was the perfect amount of wine and brown sugar. The only minor changes I made was to let it simmer with the lid off, and I also added a small sliced onion. My husband and I both loved it! Will be making again.

Only two of us, so used 1/2 cup red wine, 1/4 cup of brown sugar etc.  Only had chicken tenders so since they don't take long to cook, put in oven.  Had to add flour to thicken.  Sorry - it looks like HECK, and tastes only moderately better.  There are so many better chicken recipes online (check the red pepper jelly one).  This will NOT be made again in this house.

I used three chicken breasts, cut into halves, with 1/4 cup sugar, 2 tsps paprika, and 1 cup red wine (the amount called for in the recipe).  Given all the mixed reviews, I didn't feel great going entirely with the recipe as written, and I think this adjustment worked pretty well.  I wish I had added the garlic later in the browning process though because it burned pretty badly early on - couldn't really taste it in the final product though.

I added mixed herbs, red onion, vegetable OXO and marmite, it was quite enjoyable and easy to cook. The only criticism is the amount of sugar made the sauce too sweet.

This was very good, but it definitely came out much sweeter than I was expecting.  Overall I liked the flavor of the wine and chicken,  but if I make this again I'll probably cut back on the sugar.  There was just something about sweet chicken that just didn't do it for me.

After you cook the chicken on both sides, when you let it simmer 15-20 minutes do you still flip the meat or no?

Even following the other reviewers' advice and cutting the brown sugar down to 1/2c didn't help. This was really not very good.

Yum! I followed others suggestions.  1/2 cup sugar, more wine and I added about a cup of chicken broth while cooking the garlic and chicken because the garlic started to burn very yummy,  I'll make it again for sure!

the sauce was the best, almost cranberry like in flavor. I did reduce the sugar  to 1/2 cup and added chicken stock with a bit of thickener as I was using an entire chicken cut up and needed a longer simmer time with bone in pieces. Would love to add a photo but it seems the pixels are insufficient.

These chicken breasts were ok.  Not what I expected.  And the chicken was purple on the bottom from the wine.  So maybe I did something wrong in the preparation.

Awesome! Chicken was tender, and sweet and sour sauce was really delicious. I did not add garlic and used only 1/4c of sugar.

Excellent red wine sauce! You know it's good when the food is gone before you, the chef, got to have much of it. It's quick and easy. I was looking to try something new and I'm glad I chose this. The only tweaks I made were these: I seasoned the chicken before cooking it and used only 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup red wine. I added 1 tsp cornstarch because I like thicker sauces, 1/4 tsp sesame oil, 1 tbs black sesame seeds, 1 tbs oregano. Fantastic!

Pretty good recipe.  It almost tastes like a teriyaki recipe.  I ended up caramelizing mine, which I probably would avoid doing if I made this again, as it took away from the wine flavor.  Very flavorful.

I used 1 tablespoon of brown sugar with 1 cup of wine and that was plenty sweet.  DO NOT use 1 cup.  Otherwise this recipe is great.  I added some crushed red pepper to the sauce to offset the sweetness and served over penne with a little garlic and butter.  I made 4 small chicken breasts and had just enough sauce with the amount listed here as serving 12.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I looked at the reviews and added chopped onion in with minced garlic, red pepper flakes on the chicken breasts along with basil and used 1/4 cup chicken broth along with the wine. I used about two tablespoons of brown sugar and simmered with the top off.

Made this for my family this evening and have to say it was just okay. Based on everyone else's reviews I cut the brown sugar and paprika in 1/2. I did season with some salt and pepper and used Barefoot Merlot. I still thought it was too much paprika. I think the purpose of the paprika is to balance out the sweetness but I honestly would have preferred it without. My husband who eats anything said it was okay. My 8 1/2 picked at it and my 11 1/2 year old who is a good eater said she really didn't care for it.

Absolutely divine. I followed Hershey Queen's suggestions and boy am I glad. It took a bit of coaxing to get my family to try this somewhat intimidatingly purple dish, but once they did they were hooked.:) I'm making this again tonight per request. Thank you Robin and the very helpful Allrecipes reviewers.

Although I had a small issue with this recipe, it tasted great. I'm not sure if it was too much brown sugar and wine, but my sauce turned into a tar like consistency when it cooled. I poured a small amount of it over the chicken when it was still hot and that was a huge boo boo. It made eating the meal very uncomfortable and we had to eat around a lot of it. Other than that it was very good.

I followed the recipe exactly as it's written (except for adjusting number of servings - no sense in making 12 servings for just two people). Maybe I did something wrong, but I wasn't happy with the cooking process at all and the flavor, while good, was not worth trying this recipe again.

Way too much sugar. I hadn't read reviews when I made it so I didn't know. Also, reducing it to 2 servings didn't work well. I had to add more wine and some water because it evaporated nearly right away when I added it. probably won't make again.

I modified this recipe when I realized there was too much sugar and wine (minimized both). I also added some corn starch to thicken the sauce and toward the end of simmering, added peas and pre-cooked potatoes, which made it a complete meal. Potatoes and peas were great after soaking up the sauce!

Delicious!  This was a huge hit with our dinner guests.  I only had a little bit of two different kinds of wine; a merlot and a pinot noir.  I took the chance and used them both.  It turned out great.

I cut down the sugar and paprika to a sprinkle on both sides. Other than the dry chicken, I did enjoy the flavor. Ten mins per side is too much.

I did cut the sugar down and added mushrooms. It was delicious and will use it again.

I loved this recipe though altered it a little. I did 3/4 cup shiraz, 1/4 cup chicken stock, and 1/4 cup brown sugar. I sauteed baby portobello mushrooms with red onion and garlic in olive oil first. Then, I browned the chicken seasoned with salt and pepper. Once almost all cooked through, I added back in the mushroom mixture and added the wine mixture and let it simmer until the chicken was done. I added a little cornstarch mixed with water to thicken the sauce.

Per another reviewer, I added mushrooms, onions and garlic and sauted them before I put the chicken in.  I seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper and sprinkled some paprika on it.  I used very little brown sugar. I then kept pouring the mixture over top of the chicken. Very good.

Fabulous recipe! I made it exactly as the recipe is written and it was wonderful! A huge hit with the family. I did not find the sauce too sweet. It was perfect for us. Maybe the type of red wine makes a difference. I used a Pinot Noir. Instead of basting the chicken while it cooked the last 20 minutes, I just turned it over so the chicken could soak up the gorgeous sauce and stay moist. Amazingly easy and delicious. Thank you for the keeper recipe!!

I followed the directions exactly, even cut the sugar in half as one other reviewer recommended. I'm not sure if somehow I did something wrong but I ended up with a clumpy, weirdly sweet sauce and dried out chicken. I didn't care for this.

Fantastic recipe! I gave this 4 stars because I did find that using the scaled down measurements for the wine and the brown sugar was plenty of flavor.  You can't go wrong with this chicken.

Followed the instructions of the others and did not put as much brown sugar. I added mushrooms and cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  This was really good.  I will make it again.  The next time, I will add some creole seasoning.

I made this last night for dinner. We served it over roasted veggies (peppers/onions/carrots/mushrooms). 

I thought this recipe was delicious, but definitely the sauce needed some adjustments. I like having lots of extra sauce with my dishes so I actually doubled the red wine, cut down on the sugar (using 1/2 cup per 1 cup of red wine). I didn't have any brown sugar on hand so I added a little maple syrup to white sugar as a substitute. It worked out pretty well (LOL). My husband took extra veggies and put some sauce on them because it was so good.

Next time I make this I think I might try adding a little butter to the red wine sauce.

This was a pretty tasty dish.  I took some recommendations and reduced the sugar to about 1/4 cup, and it was still pretty sweet, but nice.  I also added mushrooms and onion.  I would make this again, but I might decrease the sugar a bit more.

Adapted recipe for 2 servings (basically 2 chicken breasts) - diced chicken into bite-sized pieces and cut sugar by half. DELICIOUS!! Served with spaghetti lightly coated in extra sauce, and sautéed spinach.

I think the commenters are correct in suggesting less brown sugar. I used about 1.5 tablespoons of brown sugar and two tablespoons of black strap molasses, plus a bit more than a cup of red wine. The molasses really added a beautiful color and flavor, plus a nice viscosity. Will definitely make again.

I think this recipe would be good just as it stands, but like all of you I cant resist tinkering a bit. I used 1/2 cup brown sugar, 2 Tbsp soy sauce, 2 Tbsp balsamic vinegar, and 1 tsp of ginger to the sauce mix. I also ended up using 1 can of chicken broth. It reduces down and gets thick much quicker than I thought it would.  So while the rice was cooking (after I had burnt the potatoes) if the sauce looked too thick I could just add the chicken broth a bit at a time.  Fantastic. I will be making this for years to come.

My husband and I agree, the sauce is what makes it, but without that the chicken is average. If I were to make it again, I would add cornstarch to the sauce to thicken.

I too have made this dish, several times. Have made the following changes:  I use 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup red wine AND use 3 whole carrots, peeled and med. slice on the bias and approx. 10 leaves of fresh sage.  I add the carrots and sage with the wine and just let it simmer away.  It makes for a wonderful winter's dish, serve over smashed garlic potatoes...with a nice crusty loaf of bread, the rest of the red wine at the table, or in front of the fireplace!  YUM-OH

This chicken comes out perfectly delicious and tender every time! I've made this recipe three times so far, and it's a family favorite. I usually use more wine and it calls for, but that's really only because I don't measure...just pour. :) Great recipe!

I went along with what the other reviews said and reduced some of the ingrediants...I am a beginner at this whole thing and wasn't sure if I was doing it correctly as I went along BUT when it was finished it was absolutely AMAZING!!!! I added the sauce and chicken on top of a bed of while wheat luingine (next time I will use a different noodle) and added some feta cheese....Can't wait to make it for others :)

This was very good but didn't have enough sauce. I also took the advice of other reviewers and added mushrooms and decreases the amount of brown sugar by 1/2 at least. Overall, it was very tasty but needed some tweaks.

Very very sweet and that was after decreasing the brown sugar almost by half.  The other flavors were nice, but I will decrease the brown sugar even more next time and maybe add some red pepper flakes for contrast.

I made this and it was, in a word – EXCELLENT!  We were really impressed.  I basically made 1/3 of this recipe using about a pound of chicken, but made 1/2 the sauce.  I cut the paprika in half and only used about 3 T. of brown sugar.  I cooked my chicken completely and removed it to a warm oven.  I then sautéed some mushrooms and proceeded with making the sauce.  I thickened this with just a little cornstarch and swirled in a couple of tablespoons of butter.  Then added back the chicken, coated it with sauce and served.  It was delicious!!  And so easy!!  Just writing this review makes me want to make it again, and soon!!!

This is a super starter recipe!  The only thing I did differently was I used bacon grease (because that's what I usually use) and I had a whole cut up chicken instead of boneless breasts and added a small sliced onion.  I also only used 1/4 cup brown sugar.  I used all the paprika called for and actually closer to 1 1/2 cups wine and let it simmer for close to a hour for the whole pieces.

FABULOUS!! I used 3 TBSP of Slenda Brown sugar and used 1/2 cup wine and 1/2 of chicken broth. I wish I knew how many calories are in this and the nutritional facts because I will make this MANY times again!

This was really good and my husband loved the flavor of the sauce.  I also made adjustments according to the other reviews.  It was delicious using 1/4 c brown sugar, 1/4 c red wine and 1/4-1/2 c chicken broth.  I dredged the chicken in paprika, salt, pepper and sage and baked it covered for 30 minutes.  I sauted mushrooms and onions and poured that and the sauce over the chicken and baked another 20 minutes uncovered and then added cornstarch to some of the remaining chicken broth to thicken the sauce and served with brown rice.  I'll definitely make this again.  I'm always looking for new chicken recipes and this is a good one.

This recipe was fantastic. It was a big hit with the family and it was so simple! I first of all fried up some onions in olive oil and garlic, and then put it in a separate dish. Then i browned the chicken with salt, pepper & paprika. Then i added the chicken to the dish with the onions and then added the sauce over the chicken. I used a 1/4 cup od sugar but that could still be reduced. I then baked it in the oven for about 30mins. When it was done baking i thickened the sauce with a bit of corn starch. Next time i will add more wine to create more sauce. i served it wish mashed potatoes and other greens. Dellicious!

way, way, way too sweet! Nearly inedible the way it is. I had to add lots of mustard powder, vinegar, more garlic, etc. to make the leftovers edible. What a waste of chicken and wine. :( Next time I would add maybe only a Tbsp of brown sugar, not an entire cup.

Cut the brown sugar down to 1/4 cup, red wine down to 1/4 cup and added 1/4 cup chicken broth.  Served with brown rice.  You can still taste the sweetness.  Husband didn't care for it.

Awesome! Did a mushroom/onion saute first. Then cooked chicken breasts dredged in paprika/seasoned salt. Removed after about 5 min. per side and then made the sauce: Used the full 1 cup of wine, cut back the sugar to 1/4 cup and added 3/4 cup chicken broth and 1 tbsp cornstarch. Added back chicken/mushroom/onion and simmered for 20 minutes. Came out fantastic!

Fantastic!  I did use boneless chicken strips because that was all I had.  For the sugar, most people said it was to much so I only used it to coat the chicken, closer to half the amount noted in the recipe.  My husband was still talking about it the next day.

Pretty good chicken dish.  As others have stated, way too much sugar so I scaled it back to 1/4 c for 4 breasts and it was still a little too sweet.  I added onions, chile powder and cayenne for a little kick and let it simmer uncovered for 25 minutes.  Served over sprouted pasta.

I'm sure I did something wrong. I used a cabernet merlot and my chicken was purple. The flavor wasn't terrible, but purple chicken does not look at all appetizing. I'm not the best cook, either.

Delicious!  My daughter even loved it and she is the pickiest eater ever!    The sauce was great! However, I think I'll simmer uncovered next time, and add some cornstarch to help the thickening action!!  YUM.  (For Healths' sake, maybe a lot less brown sugar is in order... but it was good!)

This sauce is REALLY good! I, like others, used 4 chicken breast halves and used 3/4 cup red wine (shiraz) and 1/4 cup of water with a bit of flour to thicken up the sauce. Delicious!

I made this for dinner tonight.  I'm happy to say that everybody loved the chicken, even my picky 7 year old liked it.  I suppose it was the sweet taste the wine and sugar gave to the chicken.  That said the remaining sauce was, in our opinion, too strong and not edible as a gravy/sauce.  I made a brown gravy on the side which was much more to our liking.  I did alter this recipe.  Like others I cut back the sugar content to about 1/4 cup.  I used half wine and half chicken broth (I was hoping to tone down on the strong wine flavour I knew this would have.  It wasn't enough.) and put the paprika right on the chicken to brown it. I added some onion as well.  I also added a very small splash of balsamic vinegar to it.  It gave it a beautiful deep, rich colour and did add some nice flavour.  But the over powering wine flavour was too much in the end and the sauce was left in the pan.  All in all it was good.  I will be making it again because it is one of the few ways my 7 year old will actually eat chicken!

Excellent.  My very picky boyfriend RAVED about it.  I changed it slightly based on others reviews.  I reduced the brown sugar (I made the dish for 2, so the original recipe for 2 called for 2 Tbs, 2 tsps brown sugar - I added about 1.5 - 2 tsps total).  Cut the paprika to 1/4 of a tsp (again, it called for 1/2 based on 2 servings. Personal preference - my boyfriend is not a "spicy" guy with food).  Also upped the red wine by twice that for which the recipe called.  I was a little skeptical about the brown sugar/paprika combo. But, WOW.  Great!  Wonderful!  A new staple in our house!

This was very tasty!  I followed others' advice and sauteed some mushrooms and onion with the garlic and set aside.  I cut my chicken into strips and seasoned with salt and pepper and paprika and browned about 5 minutes, put the onion, mushroom and garlic mixture back in with the chicken and then poured the red wine (I used red cooking wine) that I had already mixed with 1/2 cup of the brown sugar over the chicken mix and covered and simmered for 15 minutes.  Delicious and not too sweet!

Overall, this was surprisingly yummy.  I had some trouble getting the sauce to thicken up, so I added a teeny bit of cornstarch and then it congealed incredibly quickly and had a jelly-like consistency.  The flavor was a perfect combination with the wine and brown sugar, but the sugar definitely needs to be decreased.  I used only 1/4 cup and that was still very sweet!  Definitely a good dish worth playing around with.

Very tasty. I also used a bit less sugar, about 3/4 of a cup which may still have been too much. I only used two pounds of chicken and cooked for a shorter time - very nice results - tender and addicting. I served with steamed asparagus, just right!

Read a few reviews, tried it tonight with what’s around the kitchen/cellar. Personally we watch our sugar intake; we were out of brown sugar “splenda” so I went for regular Splenda – 4 packets in a cup of (less expensive) cabernet sauvignon.  Because of schedules I had to really bend the recipe.   Wife wasn’t going to be home for 2 hours.  Let the oil and garlic (per measure) marinate on warm/low for almost 45 minutes.  Put the chicken in and slow cooked it of about an hour (on low)!  While I let the wine/splenda & flour work toward a marbleized state – 30 minutes and I finally pushed it to boil.  I also added butter to the chicken, and kept it covered, the entire time. We were out of paprika, so I instead from the keen help of a teen-aged daughter (with a nose for flavor) used basil & parmesan cheese.   We cooked the chicken fully (but slow) then drizzled on the wine sauce at presentation. DANG GOOD MEAL. Who knew, red wine and white meat?

I thought this recipe was just "okay."  I used a cabernet which was definitely too fruity.  Next time, I'll go with something drier, more spicy.    I should have known better than to leave the garlic in from the get-go as the recipe indicates.  By the time the chicken was cooked, the garlic was completely fried.    Lastly, the paprika wasn't a good "fit."  In fact, I just Goggled Paprika and many chefs recommend only using it a garnish (like on deviled eggs).  Apparently, it has high sugar content and breaks down easily and becomes bitter when cooked.  Perhaps chili powder would've been better.     Not bad, all said and done.

this was great, I used more wine, and less sugar, and served over rice. Also be sure not to over cook your chicken, as some stated it can get dry.

This was good,but,it was way too sweet for me ,even though I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup.I didn't want candied chicken.Cut the brown sugar to 1/4 cup.I also browned chicken and set it aside.I then added onion,celery,carrots and browned them slightly.added the cup of wine plus 1 cup of chicken stock.Then I added the chicken with some quartered mushrooms and some broccoli spears and simmered for 20 min.I thickened it with a slurry of 2 Tbsp. cornstarch.I served it with Brown Rice .I will make it again, with less sugar.

A very good sauce!  I used one cup of red wine and 6 tsp of brown sugar and it was just a tad on the sweet side, but it was still very good.  I added half an onion, sliced, and half green pepper, sliced.  I also added 6-7 garlic cloves, sliced.  I cooked the chicken mostly through and then added the wine and sugar just to make the sauce.  Served over spaghetti pasta and was delish!!

This was very easy to make.  I cut down on the sugar as other reviewers suggested and it turned out very tasty!  Even my kids ate it up!  Thanks!

for lack of a better word, Mmmmmmmm! I tossed everything (with chicken split breasts) into a slow cooker with a little extra wine (I topped up my 1 Cup measuring cup) So goood! :) thank you for the recipe! I got to enjoy delicious chicken and it gave me a reason to open a bottle of red I had. Delightful. *update* I made it again tonight as the recipe directed exactly and it was even better than I remember! So sooo GOOD! I love it and will be making this again and again

Great simple recipe, like others I added an onion which I browned first then added the garlic, and I added some mushrooms. Both my husband and I really liked this, I served it over brown rice.

I love sweet but I was afraid a cup of sugar would be too much for us so I started with 1/3 cup and it was perfect for our tastes.  Followed the recipe otherwise.  This was really, really good and tasted like a lot of work went into it.  Thanks Robin!

I didn't even have to think about what to rate this. It was the best chicken I've ever had. I will be making this on a regular basis. I cut way back on the sugar and left the cover off to cook, as other reviewers suggested.

This was fabulous!  I halved the brown sugar as others suggested but thought it could have used a tad more.  I used smoked sweet paprika and merlot wine.  Soooo good!

This recipe is amazing! I've used several recipes from this website, but this is still my favorite. I took hints from the other reviewers and halved the brown sugar. All in all, it is still a wonderfully simple and tasty dish!

This chicken was delicously tender, and the marinade was superb! I mistakenly cooked half the chicken called for in the recipe, yet make the full serving of marinade--yet I found that the more, the better! I will definitely make this recipe again, and cannot wait to eat the left-overs tonight. This marinade would also be wonderful with steak.

This recipe was easy and great! I cut back on the sugar like other reviewers suggested and I didn't have any paprika so I left that out but it ended up being very tasty. I served it over rice to sop up the extra sauce - fantastic!

Great dinner. I left the recipe as it was but after dinner realized that I should decrease the sugar amount and add either onion or mushroom to it next time. All in all a great meal.

fan-friggin-tastic.  few changes i made:
1) added thin slices of onion with garlic and oil
2) used chicken drumsticks
3) halved the sugar
4) added chopped red bell pepper after brown sugar and red wine
5) omitted paprika because didn't have any on hand
6) left uncovered last 10 minutes to allow sauce to thicken
7) added mushrooms during last 5 minutes
husband LOVED it and will definitely make again.

Disliked by my family for its sweetness and obscuring the meaty flavor. If you like meat to taste differently then this may be for you. Otherwise skip recipe or use dry wine and omit brown sugar.  I did try out the suggestions but they did not help. Here is what I did:  1 Tbsp garlic, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp paprika, 1 tsp black pepper, 1 onion sliced. 4 mushrooms, 1 cup red wine sangria.  Sauteed garlic and chicken pieces in oil until juices run clear. season chicken, add onions and mushrooms and fry some more. add sugar and wine and simmer in crockpot.

Added half an onion, sliced.  Amazing flavor!  This recipe won 1st prize at a friend's "Recipe party."  I used a $10 merlot, but a friend suggested buying Trader Joe's $2 Charles Shaw wine, since the wine evaporates anyway.  I'll try that next time to save a few precious dollars.

I have to say that this recipe was simply smashing.  I ran across it becuase I have a ton of chicken breast (thanks Dad) and a lot of left over white merlot from a cake that I had made.  This dished turned out so well.  I took some to work with me and this dish nearly incited a riot (ha ha).

This is one of, if not THE best chicken I have EVER made!  I took some suggestions and used only 1/4 cup brown sugar; 3/4 cup red wine, and 1/4 cup chicken stock.  Also at the end of cooking I added a Tbsp cornstarch to make it a thick sauce, and served over brown rice.  I was so impressed!

Great recipe, I used a cabernet for the wine and it turned out wonderful. The sauce was really good over the jasmine rice I prepared with the chicken. I will definitely make again, will add more seasoning next time though.

Good flavor, but way too sweet. I tried it with pasta, but perhaps only use the sauce for basting then discard. Do not cook chicken for suggested time, way too long.

Really need to have the type of wine to use specified, I think - I suspect all of the different experiences have to do with the kind of wine. We only had a sweet red wine, so I halved brown sugar so it wouldn't come out too cloying - but in the end we didn't taste the wine at all, only the brown sugar. Would call this 'brown sugar chicken' - my husband liked it but I would only try it again with a different wine. We did not fully cook the chicken before putting in the sauce, only cooked about 5 min each side, and came out cooked nicely.

We really liked this...I didn't measure the sugar or wine but added a little onion, butter, and garlic powder. Nice and thick sauce...do not cook at suggested time. Chicken cannot cook that long. Mine was perfectly juicy.

I really enjoyed this recipe and so did my wife and son, everyone went back for seconds. Although I do wish I had of read the reviews first so that I would have added some broth with less wine as it was a little powerful, My son liked that though because he got to have some "booze" as he put it.

This was fantastic. My husband and I both loved it. It did taste very similar to chicken marsala and would be great if you added mushrooms. Oh, I used 3/4 cup of red wine and 1/4 cup of brown sugar for 2 pieces of chicken and it turned out great. I also removed the chicken after 10 minutes of simmering and added 1 Tablespoon of cornstarch mixed with 1 Tablespoon of cold water. Then I added the chicken back and heated through with the thickened sauce.

What a superb recipe! I cannot believe I haven't come across this one before. I reduced the recipe to serve two people and some of the measurements didn't change so watch out for that and use your own judgement. Next time I will reduce the brown sugar a tad. I also whisked in some butter at the end for a richer sauce but I think that turned it into more of a toffee flavor so I won't do that next time. Served with thin French green beans and a risotto.

This was yummy!! However, the chicken ended up a little dry (even after I marinated it overnight in a simple marinade)

Very delicious!  Did make some changes.  First sauteeing the garlic in the pan before the chicken and the putting the chicken in is a bad idea.  The garlic will burn!  Secound I used splenda brown sugar for less calories.  I used a nice australian shiraz as the wine.  I also put a bunch of already sauteed onion and mushrooms in with the sauce.  Without this the dish would not have been nearly as good.   I put the leftovers over mashed potatoes and it was yummy!  the sauce is very sweet!  Your chicken will become a red color from the stain of the wine don't be alarmed!

This was delicious. My only complaint is that there wasn't enough sauce to spoon over pasta for a side dish.  I added more wine and more brown sugar, then also added some corn starch to thicken up the sauce.  But over all it was very good,

We have mixed feelings about this. My Husband thought it was nice and I thought it was just ordinary. After reading the reviews I reduced the sugar to a quarter cup, added an onion and some cayenne pepper. Don't think I'll make again.

I found the  sauce to be very sweet, so I will definitely be reducing the sugar by half next time.  I also added some mrs. dash to the chicken for more seasoning.  I also used a little bit of flour in the sauce to make it a bit thicker and then served it all on a bed of sticky rice. It was a quick and easy recipe which is great when you don't have a lot of time.  I will make this again.

My family loved this recipe.  A lot of people said that it wasn't sweet but we found that the sauce was more like a syrup and absolutely delicious.  The chicken was a bit dry, being simmered for so long.  
My dh wants to try this sauce over grilled fish and since it has so few ingredients, this recipe will work out great in the condo on vacation.  We're looking forward to trying many variations of this.  
Thanks for the recipe!

I smelled this as it was cooking and thought, great, another boring chicken recipe.  Then I tasted it.  Wow!  This is definitely a keeper!  I took some advice and added onions, broth and roasted red peppers.  Delicious!  This is one recipe I will add to my recipe collection.  I would, however, make more of that yummy sauce because my dad loves sauce with chicken.  I served this with rosemary potatoes and cole slaw.  Excellent dinner!  Thanks for a great recipe, finally!

Much too sweet for chicken.  I think the sauce would be better suited for pork tenderloin.  I do like the red wine with chicken, though.  Maybe next time I'll try with 1 T brown sugar and some shallots...

I expected this dish to be too sweet for my taste, but I always follow a recipe exactly the first time. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the sweetness was mild, and that the sauce wasn't overly syrupy. (Are people using dry wine or something sweeter? Sweet wine might explain why it's too sweet for some.)

The garlic and paprika didn't add much noticeable flavor, but I think too much might have clashed with the wine sauce. I'm considering trying this with white wine, which I think could stand up to stronger garlic. Tonight, I'm going to try a lemon chicken with this recipe as the basis, replacing the wine with lemon juice and making some other adjustments. Also recommend trying it with chicken thighs and legs, which tend to stay moist longer than breast meat.

NB: If this dish is refrigerated for a while, the fat (from the chicken) and the sauce both solidify, and the fat can be easily skimmed off.

I took other's advice about the brown sugar and reduced it to 1/2 cup...unfortunately, it was still too sweet for me but I think it will be good once I reduce to 1/4 cup or less.  I also added mushrooms and left the chicken in a plate so that it wouldn't turn purple.  Once it's tweaked a little, this recipe has potential.

I was thinking 3 or 4 stars for this one... my husband said 2 or 3.  I think he was being a bit critical, but am sticking with the three.  This was simple to make, almost no effort at all.  The bottom half of my chicken did turn a bit purplish... but not much of a concern as I just served it with the bottom side down.

The brown sugar added a nice difference in flavor and complimented the wine well.  I will probably make this again when I am looking for something outside of my everyday favorites.

I must say I was a bit skeptical about this recipe after reading the other reviews. I was worried about it being too sweet and purple chicken...It was to my surprise wonderful. The chicken did not turn purple and the recipe was definitely not too sweet. I used the amount of sugar and wine called for in the recipe. It was perfect. I think using a sweet red wine would make the chicken too sweet, but I used a merlot and it was amazing.

This was just OK.  Not really a whole lot of flavor, and the wine turns the chicken a very unappetizing purple.  Chicken was moist but lacked flavor.

Excellent chicken recipe.  Its best to cook it real slow to keep it moist and use just enough brown sugar to coat each piece.  This was quick and easy and very tasty!

Needed to find a quick and easy recipe for chicken breasts.  This was it!  Very quick and easy.  Great served over rice (I hate couscous!)!  My toddlers loved it, especially w/ the sauce on the rice.

This recipe is great! It was a little too sweet but that is probably because I used a sweeter wine. It was super easy and the chicken came out moist and full of flavor.

By far the best meal I have ever made!  I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out magnificently!  I think the wine and the sugar balance each other perfectly.  Also, I served it on couscous, and I suggest you do too.  Couscous can soak up much more sauce than rice, and as a result, has more flavor.

This was a fantastic recipe, my only problem was that it was a bit dry, however i think using thigh fillets instead of breast it would be very succulent. Thanks!

Mmmm---I loved this chicken!  I diced it up and used a nice Lambrusco; it was very tasty.  I also threw in some raisins while it simmered...It is a sweet dish, but I really liked the blend of flavors.  Very quick and easy.  Good served over rice.  I will definitely make this again!  :)

This really wasn't that great at all!  The chicken seemed watery and tasteless.  However, I cooked mushrooms in the sauce as well and they turned out amazing.

I thought this recipe was delicious!  It tastes like a dish served at a restaurant.  I would recommend making wild rice on the side.

Our family really liked this chicken.I did it with 1/2 cup sugar as someone suggested and cooked with lid off. I ended up with no sauce left at the end--I used cut up chicken tender meat. Next time I will add some water, broccoli and serve with white rice(with a little soy sauce in it) and some pineapple on the side. I even liked it cold---would be good meat for a salad too.

This is the best recipe that I've found for chicken.  Every time I have company I cook it, and I haven't found anyone who doesn't like it.  It really is easy to make, and the brown sugar really makes this chicken awesome!!

I served this dish to my boyfriend for Valentine's Day.  I cut back my brown sugar to 1/2 c., which was more than enough.  I also reduced the red wine, and it turned out fantastic!  I served this with an herb risotto, and he really liked the meal.  However, this is a very sweet chicken dish, and while I loved it, he would have preferred a little less sugar and more wine flavor.  Overall, really good!

This recipe is salvageable if one uses perhaps a tablespoon of sugar (or less) instead of a cup.  I modified the recipe to use only a half cup of sugar and it was still way too sweet. I couldn't eat my rice that had the sauce from the chicken on it. And I rinsed all the remaining sauce off the leftover chicken in the hopes of salvaging it with some savory flavoring later.
What I did like about this recipe is its simplicity. At least I've got a base to use for further experimentation - without sugar.

This recipe (when revised) is absolutely delicious. I read through the reviews before ever making it and I took some of their advice to cut down on the wine and brown sugar by half, which I did and it was still too much. So I ended up using only 1/4c. of Brown sugar and 1/2c. Of wine, which is still a tad sweet for me but it brought it back down to enjoyable.

I made this as written, except attempting to leave the skillet uncovered during braising. The sauce reduced too quickly, and I put the lid back on to try to recover it. The chicken and sauce still tasted very good, but next time I think I will leave it covered for at least the first half of the time, then try uncovering it closer to the end to thicken up the sauce.

Threw this together very last minute but it was amazing! I used more garlic than called for. I also mixed dark brown sugar and white because I had no light brown sugar but it came out fantastic. The sauce is very good and we plan to use it for other meats and seafood.

I think I will reduce the amount of brown sugar next time by a little but other than that, I loved the dish. I also added some fresh mushrooms into the dish that made it just a little better for me.

A family favorite since my high school years, and the first dinner I ever cooked.. this dish is beautiful, and I think best served with a few tweaks: a pinch or so of cayenne, a dollop of sour cream on the side of the plate, and you should definitely cut up the chicken into hearty chunks before you cook it! The delicious taste of the sauce and the novelty of the color it leaves on the chicken is part of the whole point, so more surface area is better!

Tasted like bourbon chicken from the mall. The kids and I enjoyed. I used boneless, skinless thighs. A quarter cup of brown sugar would have sufficed. I used half still a little sweet.

I made this recipe as it was written, although I did change the serving size down to 4. 

It was absolutely delicious. I served it on a bed of sticky rice with a side of sweet white corn. The chicken was moist and tender, the sauce was not too thin and not too thick and it tasted really, really good. 

I will definitely make this again. It was a tad spicy for my young daughter so next time I may tone down the paprika, but for adults this recipe was a winner as is.

Pleasantly surprised! I love dishes with wine, especially red wine. After reading the other reviews, I only used 1/4 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 a teaspoon of paprika, along with my cup of Cabernet wine. The other change I made, I used chicken thighs instead of breasts. I’m not sure what I did different than others but even tho I covered the skillet, after 10 minutes of simmering I had to add more wine and decided to add about 1/2 cup of chicken broth too. At the 20 minute mark, my chicken had a super thick glaze, so I removed it from the heat while I finished making mashed cauliflower (instead of carby mashed potatoes) and asparagus. I told my husband that he probably wasn’t going to like the chicken because he doesn’t care for sweet meals (and it was sweet!) but he loved it and actually had seconds.

Love. loVe.LOVE! The whole family loved it including the seven and three year old!. Lots of paprika for color. Sauteed garlic and onions before adding chicken to brown. Added rosemary, basil and parsley on top of  chicken along with seasoning salt.  One cup of red wine to half cup of brown sugar which was could still be cut diwn slightly.  A dash of soy and bam! I left the lid off during simmer as well to reduce sauce. Served it over butter garlic noddles with slivers of carrot twisted in and fresh green beans. One of my favorite recipes on here so far!!! Oh and cant forget i let the chicken marinate in the wine in the fridge while i chopped, boiled and diced...

This was good if you adjusted it to suit your tastes. As written I would say this is a sub-par dish. The amount of sugar is just way off as most of the reviewers have commented. When I made it I only put about 1T of sugar and that was enough to give added flavour. Served with a wild rice salad it was good, but not something I would rush to make again. If you are trying this recipe then I recommend to cut the sugar drastically and then play around with the flavours to suit your tastes.

loved this recipe although I have to admit that I used chicken thighs instead on breasts. I also followed what other reviews suggested. Sauteing onions and mushrooms first, removing them, sprinkling the chicken with salt, pepper and paprika and then browning the chicken and adding in wine, broth and 1/2 cup brown sugar. it was juicy and delicious !!!

I really like this recipe, but agree with most other reviewers saying to use less sugar.  I only used 1/3 cup br sugar and it came out great.  Dont cover, continuously spoon the sauce over the chicken the full 15 mins.  Sauce was thick and perfectly sweet.

Far too sweet.  I had to add apple cider vinegar to take the edge off the sweetness, the end result as more like a sweet and sour chicken!

I took advice of others and cut the brown sugar, wine & paprika to 1/2.  I also added corn starch to thicken, sliced onions & mushrooms and let it simmer for approx. 45mins.  
Ahhh!  So good!  Served with brown rice and green beans!

Ugh.  Red wine and brown sugar?  With paprika? In spite of all the good reviews I had a feeling that this might be a nasty combination, and it was. And the recipe's cooking time for the chicken is far too long.  I halved it, searing the chicken to a nice brown crust  on both sides and then cooking for twelve minutes in the sauce, taking the lid off the pan for the last five.  The chicken was nice and moist but the sauce was disgusting, and that was with reducing the sugar by 3/4.  I reduced it down to a glaze and that made it tolerable, but I won't be making this one again. Perhaps the author of this recipe could let us know what kind of wine they used; that might help.

Made it with thighs instead of breasts and followed the recipe. When I make it again I will try less sugar and then decide which I prefer. Preparation was quick and easy. The chicken was moist, tender and delicious.

This is a wonderful recipe! I used skinned, boneless thighs instead of breasts. Sauteed about one tablespoon garlic, purple onion, and some mushrooms before cooking the chicken. Set that aside and put back in after the wine was added. I added fresh ground pepper, and salted the thighs with a little kosher salt. Also used about 1/2 cup brown sugar sprinkled on both sides with the tablespoon of paprika. Added about 1 tablespoon of cornstarch to the wine to thicken the sauce. I also added about half a tablespoon of garlic salt. Decided not to drain the drippings as I thought it would give it more flavor. Awesome! Husband just LOVED it!

I made this receipe.  I followed the directions.  Next time I might cut the brown sugar in half of what it calls for. While I was cooking the garlic and chicken I added mushrooms and the mushrooms eventually cooked down.  I loved this receipe.

Wow! I was a little skeptical and expected this to be a little bland since the recipe calls for so few ingredients, but I was very pleasantly surprised. It's definitely sweet, but I like sweet. I didn't have paprika, so I used 1 tsp of chili powder instead. I was ready to use cornstarch to thicken the sauce, but just as it was almost done cooking under the lid, the sauce thickened up slightly on its own. Luckily I didn't add any cornstarch in, because as the sauce cooled it thickened even more. My boyfriend said this was one of the best meals I've cooked. I served it with tator tots from the air fryer, and the sauce went well with those, too! The sauce would be perfect for chicken and waffles! Also, I cut up the extra chicken to throw onto a salad, which I'm sure will give the salad a little sweetness.

The one thing I would change is to thicken the sauce and somehow make the chicken not so dry.

I’m only giving it 3 stars since it seems the actual recipe is not great. I followed other people’s suggestions (half the sugar) and it was great! Another reviewer suggested sautéed veggies with it and I did the same with onions and bell peppers. I also didn’t cook the chicken breasts fully because it would have been really dry so I did 5 minutes each side then the simmering, it ended at 155 degrees Internal temperature and was very moist and juicy. (It is a-ok to eat chicken that’s not 165 degrees depending on how long you have been cooking the chicken). All in all, the ingredients for this recipe worked well! Just half the sugar!

I halved the brown sugar, reduced the sauce and added a table spoon of Tahini sauce.  Before the tahini, the sauce was incredibly sweet and without any depth of flavor.  Next time I will add a little onion in with the garlic.

I read through some reviews and took the advice of others. I reduced the brown sugar, paprika and red wine. I cut my chicken breasts in halves. Seasoned with onion powder, salt and black pepper both sides before frying.  1/2 cup brown sugar. 1/2 tablespoon paprika. 2/3 cup red wine. 10 minutes each side before draining oil. Then dumped the brown sugar/paprika on chicken and poured the wine around. Simmered 20 minutes  uncovered.  Amazing. Definitely a keeper.  Served with white rice and oven roasted asparagus.

SO delicious! I did alter the amount of ingredients. I used 1 tsp each of paprika, black pepper and salt. I used about 3/4 cup of brown sugar and about a cup of Merlot. I cooked with the lid on for 5 minutes and then removed the lid for another 10 or so to let the sauce cook down. I did not add cornstarch to thicken. I served with mashed potatoes using the extra sauce as a gravy. This will be a weekly dinner. Easy and so good!

This was great! However, I did take the suggestion of another reviewer and halved both the brown sugar and the paprika. Also--and maybe the chicken breasts I had were extra large--I had to cook it another 15 minutes before it was safe to eat...and it also turned the wine sauce into a wonderful glaze.

I added less sugar and the 1/2 cup of chicken stock and sauteed some onions as other reviewers recommended. 

I left sauce/chicken uncovered and the sauce was still too runny. I didn't have any cornstarch or flour on hand so the sauce was more like a soup with pasta noodles in my plate. This recipe needs an overhaul for the ingredients.

Even following advice from other reviewers, this still turned out awful. Pretty tasteless, and what taste was there wasn't good. I suffered through eating a bit because I was hungry, but couldn't stomach the thought of eating more. My husband managed to get down a bit more than me, but we tossed the rest.

I don't usually like to make changes until I've tried it once, but this time I made adjustments after reading some of the reviews.  I ended up reducing the brown sugar to just under half, but kept the amount of wine.  Since I love the combination of chicken and rosemary, I added a half teaspoon.  I also just seared  the chicken and let it cook in the liquid, which I thickened slightly with cornstarch.  Thanks for the recipe, everyone had seconds!

I think the recipe is good, but definitely beware not to overcook it-- the brown sugar will turn to molasses. I think I need to take another stab at it:)

Like many others, I cut back on the sugar. Also tried dredging the chicken with Adobo prior to browning. Worked out ok. Added sauteed onions and mushrooms to the mix and had to play around with the wine sauce to get it to where we liked the taste. But all in all, a decent recipe, IMHO. I would recommend this one.

I used red chilli pepper instead of paprika, and regardless it came out great. After basting the chicken for a period of time I took the breasts and set them in a warmed bowl and simmered the rest of the sauce down into a thicker sauce to drizzle.

If I make it again I might try adding red miso.

Shut up! This is delicious!! I followed the recipe mostly, but only had boneless skinless thighs so used those, added 1 T of salted butter and a thinly sliced onion when sauteing garlic. Basted as directed and simmered low and slow. It my sauce thickened up nicely. I will add mushrooms next time, or sure. Highly recommend for an easy and tasty meal!

Quick & easy, first time I made this I used whole boneless, skinless chicken thighs, second time I diced the thighs up and added garlic, leeks and mushrooms.  Cut back on the brown sugar as others recommended, and had it over rice.  Tastes like a slightly sweet coq au vin!

Reduced the recipe to 4 servings, using boneless breasts, which I pounded flat to cook evenly. Reduced sugar, as some reviewers suggested. Greatly reduced cooking time (4 minutes to a side) and it was still overcooked. Used cornstarch to thicken gravy, which worked well. But just didn't love the flavor. Garlic was too prominent and didn't blend with sugar and red wine. Won't be making this again.

Good.  Just good.  Not Great, not an "Out-of-Body Experience," not "Best Chicken Ever," and not "Life Changing" in any way.  I agree with many reviewing cooks that the flavors do not blend.  You taste wine.  Lots of wine.  You taste the sugar.  Lots of sugar.  And then you taste garlic with a hint of chicken.  I cooked the chicken in sauce for 15-20 minutes, removing the lid half-way to reduce the sauce a bit.  It did reduce, but the chicken, as many others commented, dried.  Anything above the sauce line in the pan lost moisture.  Still, it was good.  I would assume that the flavor would change slightly with the choice of wine variety.  It was worth the try, but won't go on my favorite list.

Other than using less brown sugar I followed this recipe.  My family loved it and asked for it again the next week.  I used a Woodbridge Cabernet Sauvignon so, not a real expensive wine, (I only mention it because no one else specified what kind of red wine they used.) which was good enough for us.  I sprinkled about a tablespoon of sugar on the chicken pieces while they browned then flipped them over.   Oh, I guess I used thighs instead of breasts too.  Other than that followed the recipe.

I had to make some changes. Like many others, I sautéed onion and fresh mushrooms with the garlic. Removed from pan and then seared the chicken, which I put the paprika and salt on. I then used 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup chicken broth, and 1/2 cup red wine and simmered the chicken and veggies for 30 minutes. I then thickened using some chicken broth and 1 tablespoon of flour. Delicious. Will make again.

I will definitely make this again..My husband raved over it many times during dinner and even after.
The only thing I changed was adding fresh brown crimini mushrooms and reduced the sugar by half.  Oh and I had no chicken breasts so I used boneless skinless thighs.  Yummy but I will definitely make it with breasts the next time.

I took some of the cues from other cooks and reduced the amount of sugar to maybe 1/3 cup, also used corn starch to thicken sauce. It was easy to make, the chicken came out very tender and juicy, but the sauce was still sweet. My family likes savory flavors more, so I'm not sure what I would do with this recipe. In summary: easy recipe, sweeter flavored sauce, and not sure if I will make it very often.

I followed the recipe except for making it for two.  I used a cabernet sauvignon wine (which we like to drink), and did not find this recipe very interesting.  My husband thought it was on the bland side as did I.  Probably won't make it again.

I made this recipe and it was not a winner for my family. My 5 year old literally spit it out. My 15 year old daughter hated it and said it smelled like  teriyaki chicken but didn't taste like it. My 17 year old son liked it. I thought it tasted a lot like teriyaki chicken and the Mr. said it tastes ok but the chicken was super dry. Not our favorite overall. I think it was the sweetness of the brown sugar and bitterness of the red wine that had something to do with it.  On a positive note, I finally busted out the steamer I bought eons ago and had the most amazing steamed broccoli ever!!

Loved this recipe! So easy to prepare. I substituted cane sugar for the brown sugar and used much less - probably only 2-3 Tbsp to glaze the chicken a little bit. I also added LOTS of veggies to the mix - potatoes, carrots, onions - for some great sides!

I wouldn't make this again. Based on the reviews I cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup thinking I could always add more if needed. Even that was too sweet. Kind of a weird flavor combination.  It would be better without it at all. Maybe a little orange juice or orange zest would be better with it? The paprika just disappeared - though it made it look nice.

I make this recipe regularly in my slow cooker and thicken with corn flour. I am always guaranteed empty plates when this is served! Sometimes I do dumplings with it, sometimes just with creamy mashed potatoes, but always yummy!

I made this recipe the other day for my boyfriend and I, and i was very impressed. it is such an easy and quick  recipe. I always look at other comments to see what others change by adding or reducing ingredients , I did reduce the (wine 3/4 cup )and (brown sugar-1/2 cup)  and (paprika-1/2 tablespoon) 
Good with rice.

Excellent recipe (to use up red wine that sat for too long after opening) following other reviewers comments - halved the paprika and brown sugar and no lid to allow to reduce.  Also added a lot more garlic as we love it and added some dried onions as we had some to use up.

My family of 6 (including 4 kids) really enjoyed this. I thought it needed a little extra something, so I sauteed sweet onions in some butter and olive oil before I added the chicken in to brown. Otherwise, we followed the recipe pretty much spot on. Next time, I will double the sauce for sure, because I made pasta to go with it and there just wasn't enough sauce for the pasta. But the sauce was delish, and we all wanted more!

I recently made this recipe and I must say it was out of this world good. I read other reviews and I also changed few things. I sautéed onion and mushrooms first, removed it from the pan then added garlic and then chicken. I also put half the brown sugar and little bit more wine then the recipe is asking for. just before finish I added mushrooms and onion back with chicken. I also added chicken broth, it just made it better. best part of this recipe is that you can heat it up days later and it still tastes delicious.

I made this after reading many reviews. My edits: use only a small sprinkle of brown sugar and add an onion into the garlic when cooking. I serve this over pasta, and it's fantastic to mix the pasta in with the sauce. My husband LOVES this dish and I'm making this again! Highly recommend, just be sure to tweak to your individual preferences for sweetness.

It was very good and had a good flavor. I am not a fan of white meat, so I'm always looking for a recipe that will give it some flavor I can enjoy. This recipe did that.

I sure wish I had read the reviews! I also wish a recipe couldn't receive high reviews if things were changed. This was soooo sweet, and not in a recoverable way. I tried adding cayenne, soy sauce, and more salt... nothing got rid of the sickly sweet taste. I barely tasted the wine... maybe cabernet was not the right wine for this?  I would love for someone to re-write a recipe of their own based on what they did different to make this turn out. I also checked the flavor at 15 minutes and it was waaaay over-cooked.

The whole family really enjoyed this one! Good balance of sweet and tangy.  The only reason I reserved the last "star" is that I'm very stingy about giving out ratings that high.  

When you see a five star with my name on it, you'll know that I REALLY mean it!!!  Happy dining!

I didn't have red wine, so used white wine, it turned out great.  One full cup of brown sugar seemed excessive, a couple heaping tablespoons gave it enough sweetness.
Spoon some of the sauce over the chicken after serving.

I kind of made a hybrid of this and sliced up egg sized potatoes added cayenne powder and chilli flakes, I also only did about 1/4 cup of sugar and 5/8 cup wine to soak the potatoes all the way through. I added a frozen vegetable medley at the end. simmered with the lid on for 15 then added veggies for five then about seven minutes for it to reduce and I enjoyed it!

I cute up the chicken breasts a little and only used about 3/4 cup brown sugar.  My husband and I both thought it was a little bland.  The flavor itself is good.  There just wasn't enough of it.  Maybe if I had made the chicken bite-sized instead of just smaller?

Really well done, and a great reason to drink while you cook! ;) 
I halved this recipe and used Red Moscato. I have very little complaints; the sauce came out pretty sweet without being too over powering. I'm a happy cook tonight!

I made it already 3-4 times
But tonight, i'm making it with 3/4 cup of brown sugar instead of a full cup, because it can get very dry with the full cup... something close to a chicken jerky. Gage your sugar and you get the perfect meal.
Also, if i may... when you cook it, it is the perfect time to enjoy a blue motorcycle. Check it out, it's here on allrecipes.com  !!!!

I pounded the breasts until they were thin.  I sprinkled them with Smokey Penzeys salt seasoning.  I cooked chicken in the oven at 400 for 10-15 until aprox. 140 degrees.  I used 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/2-1 tbsp of paprika, and 3/4 cup of red wine.  I started boiling the mixture, placed the chicken in it, and let the mixture boil down while the chicken finished cooking which took aprox. 10 minutes.

Ok, not great (even after taking suggestions from the comments). 1/2 cup brown sugar still made it pretty sweet and any more would've ruined it. I was worried about overcooking with the chicken, so I only cooked it for about 5 minutes each side before simmering. The chicken still came out overcooked. Overall, the dish is a decent concept but the directions are pretty flawed.

I really enjoyed the sauce, but gave it four stars because I felt my adjustments made it top notch: with the garlic, I added one peeled, cored and diced Granny Smith apple. I also only had about 3/4 c of brown sugar, so I used that, too.  Lastly, I did the cornstarch wash to thicken the sauce, because I wanted it to top the ginger rice pilaf I served on the side.

The other deleted star was for the men in the house who reacted with very 3-star reviews in regards the sweet sauce. I think the next time I try this, I will reduce the sugar to 1/2 c, add a couple tbsp Worcestershire sauce, include a dryer wine (I used merlot) and add a sprig of rosemary for a more savory effect.

I really liked it, though!

I have made this a few times, but I've made a few changes each time. I use about 1/3 the brown sugar, less salt, more garlic and paprika, and sprinkle pepper and a bit of cayenne on each side of the chicken. Next time I'll probably throw in some chopped garlic and diced onions in with the chicken. Anyway, it's great, and I'd definitely recommend trying it!

This dish does remind me of chicken Marsala.  I read the reviews and only used 1/4 cup of brown sugar. I also sprinkled the chicken with salt, pepper and paprika before sauteing.  Finally, I did also  onions and mushrooms.

I personally loved it. I changed a few things though and will change one more thing next time. I used 3 lbs of chicken - added onion powder - created a 3/4 butter 1/4 wine  sauce that I basted the chicken with while cooking (sauce is light purple) and while cooking in red wine and sugar. Will be cutting the chicken into cubes next time in hopes to pull flavour all the way through the chicken this time.

I also served the chicken with a butter wine sauce on the side for a glaze. Whole family loved it. 

Paired with red lobster biscuits, yellow rice and my special green beans

I'm giving 4 stars because my fiance liked it.  I did have one small issue, when I realized I actually didn't have any brown sugar at home!  I used a little less white sugar.  I also added onions and green beans.  And some extra wine.  It turned out well but I want to try it again with the brown sugar.  Overall though it was nice.

Used half a cup of brown sugar, a cup of red wine and about 1/3 of a cup of chicken broth.  Added 1 onion and a bunch of mushrooms.  Very tasty.

I made this last night; and even followed some of the reviewers suggestions to decrease the paprika and brown sugar.   It was ok; but I wouldnt make again.     The best part was the wine sauce.

I cut the sugar in half and used the 1 cup of wine. Honestly thought it was just ok. If I would have went completely by the recipe it would have been too sweet. Not sure if I will make again.

I'm one of those people who will try a new recipe with friends coming to share a meal. The first time I made this, I freaked out a bit--wasn't expecting the chicken to turn red. Duh. No worries, we all loved it. Like many suggested, I cut the brown sugar and the wine in half. It is delicious.

Did not hit my wife and I as special. We generally love anything that includes wine in the preparation, but this did not shine brightly.Might work better with thighs as the breasts remained somewhat dry in the end.

Turned out yummy but the chicken exterior toughened after a while. I'm a new cook so I'm not sure if that's normal. Heating it up made it worse. But despite everything, everyone loved it. Especially mum who is partial to Arabic and Oriental flavours.

I gave it 5 stars, according to the changes I made after reading the reviews.  I cooked the chicken first, sprinkled with paprika, garlic powder (I was out of minced garlic) and some seasoned salt.  I coated the pan with some cooking spray, instead of oil.  Removed it from the pan, added 1 Tbsp butter and 1/2 a yellow onion, thinly sliced.  I sauted the onion until soft, then returned chicken to the pan, sprinkled with brown sugar (I reduced to 1/2 cup), poured about 3/4 cup wine around the chicken and then added 1/4 cup wine that had been whisked with a little bit of corn starch.  Left the lid off and let it simmer about 20 minutes.  Delicious!

This was so tasty!  I only made this for 4 people, so the red wine decreased to 1/3 cup of wine, which was not enough for the pasta I made to go with it.  So, next time I will double the wine.  There is no reason for that much brown sugar.  I sprinkled my chicken with it and added about a tablespoon to the red wine.  Definitely use corn starch to thicken up the sauce and leave it uncovered.  Also, I used mushrooms which were great in it!  I thought there was no way to make this taste good with plain old wine and sugar, but it was awesome!

Not my favorite, also cut down on the sugar as recommended and too sweet for me. I brought it as a potluck for work and served over rice pilaf and my co-workers liked it but again, too sweet for me and the purple chicken (from the wine) just was not that appetizing to me.

Delicious!  Not sure why the negative remarks.  I love a sweet sauce on chicken and a red wine flavor.  I didn't measure any of the spices or garlic, just seasoned to our taste (heavy on all), pan-seared then simmered.  Easy and yummy-couldn't ask for more.

So easy and very good. I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup. Next time I will cut it down even more, to 1/4 cup. My husband and 3 year old loved it too. It's a keeper.

Yum!! Very 'off the beaten path' as far as chicken recipes go. I always carmalize some onions w/ the chicken & it turns out great.  I've gotten to where I don't measure anything just throw it in the pan. Great recipe!!

The flavor was good.  Though I think it was way too much sugar, would consider reducing it to half for sure.  Also, the consistency of the sauce was off.  Mine basically turned out to be liquid.    I think with a little adjustments it could work.  Still, my go too red wine chicken will be Mark Bitman's apricot chicken not this.

I used this recipe with chicken thighs. I braised them in the sauce and it came out fantastic. Also, I advise adding a little chicken stock (not broth!) to the sauce. The gelatin in the stock thickens the sauce up, as well as, adds a really nice, rich flavor to it!

This recipe is good, but I only gave it three stars because I had to change so much. I only added the brown sugar to taste, starting with a teaspoon. I only got about four teaspoons in before I decided it was enough. I also cooked pancetta with the garlic, which gave it a nice bacony flavor. If I made it again, I would definitely use less oil and remove some of the oil after cooking the pancetta, but that was my fault, not the recipe's. The paprika and red wine combination was delicious. I served it with red wine risotto and green beans. Yum!

I used Black Cat wine to make this. The fruity taste from that and the garlic meshed together really well. This will definitely be added to me recipe list.

This dish is delicious! As is, it is very sweet but I liked it that way. I have cooked this several times and the key is to make sure to check the sauce as it simmers because over cooking it will cause it to burn and harden.

Since I tend to like very sweet things, I went with 3/4 c. sugar to 1 c. wine.  This was even too sweet for me!  The flavor was still fantastic, but I think that next time I'll cut it to 1/2 c.  I added sliced mushrooms and onions.  As other reviewers have said, the mushrooms were amazing!  I did thicken it a bit with a dab of cornstarch dissolved in water.

Super Yummy!  Followed other reviewers advice and reduced brown sugar to 1/4 cup, added 1 cup chicken broth, and used cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  Also and some sauted onions and served over quinoa.  Will make this again and again!

Delicious! I used 1/3 c brown sugar and more than a cup of red wine-- next time I might use just under 1/3 c of the sugar though. I sliced the chicken into 8 pieces and left the top off to really let the sauce reduce.

I went ahead and tried this too. Tried the suggestions with less sugar and paprika, same amount of wine. And it was okay. I don't think I'll be repeating it anytime soon.

Just tasted like chicken cooked in wine.  It had a weird purple color and tasted dry and sweet, in a weird way.  The sauce was def not worth salvaging.  Had to just chop up the chicken and use it for a quesadilla, extra cheese.   I followed the recipe with the most popular suggestions for changing it.  And not to be redundant, but if you all are changing more than 50% of the ingredients/measurements, something's obviously not right.     Prob won't make again unless someone wants to tell me how to make it overwhelmingly better.

This is an easy recipe that tastes great.  Like some others, I used 1/2 cup red wine, 1/2 cup chicken broth and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  I suspect the left overs are going to taste as great as fresh.

So simple! If you butterfly the chicken you can "quick fry" it as well..ready in 20 minutes.  I only cooked two chicken breasts and didn't actually measure anything but this chicken was simple and fabulous.  Thanks for a great, easy recipe!

I thought the flavor of this was great! My 5 yr old. step son thought the flavor was good but complained about the smell the whole time. My husband also thought it tasted good, but we all thought the noodles were too bland and like others have said, the sauce was not usable to put over the noodles. It was too runny.

I too cut back on the sugar and spice and added more wine. I did about 1/2 c brown sugar, 1tbs paprika. This was seriously awesome. Wow. Served with dill/parsley mashed potatoes. Used chicken thighs.

THIS WAS FANTASTIC!!  Like so many others, I made this my way while still sticking to most of the instructions.  I was only cooking for two, so I used two chicken breast halves.  I also sauteed onions with the garlic, and transferred them to a plate while I browned the chicken (which had been seasoned with salt, pepper, and paprika beforehand).  Instead of 1 cup of brown sugar, I only used about 2 tbsp (one for each breast half).  I do not have wine, but I mixed grape juice and red wine vinegar (1/2 cup) and you can't really tell the difference.  I also dissolved 1 chicken bouillon cube in 1/2 cup of water, and poured both liquids over the chicken and onions/garlic.  I thickened the sauce with 1 tbsp of cornstarch before removing from the heat, and served with mashed potatoes.  It was D-E LICIOUS!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was very good and extremely fast and easy. As other reviewer's suggested, I reduced the amount of paprika and brown sugar both by half.  Will definitely make again.

I had never cooked with red wine before, and after making this dish, you'd think I had.  It was great.

this was a wonderful dish. Everyone loved it...i cooked fennel along with the garlic, took others advice and used only 3/4 cup of wine, half of the paprika and brown sugar, and also put a little bit of chicken broth in it...i had chicken on the bone so i put the oven on to 375 and when i browned the chicken along with everything else (let it boil for a couple of minutes) then put the whole thing in the oven (gotta have an oven safe pan)..when i took it out, i took out the chicken, reduced the liquid left in the pan for 5 minutes and put a little bit of corn starch in it, this made it into a glaze, it was so delicious!

I thought this was yummy and only made a couple of changes.  I halved the recipe, cooked the breast on our George Foreman grill instead of doing step one, and cooked uncovered instead of as directed for step 2.  I found the proportions to be perfect for the half serving which was about 2 generous sized breasts.  I will definitely make again!

WOW, this recipe is fantastic! It is so easy to make, but it looks and tastes like a restaurant quality meal. The only change I made was scaling it down for two people, and seasoning the chicken breasts before sauteing. Served with rice pilaf and a salad, and the wine I cooked with. This is going in my rotation for sure!

I made it with cheap wine and was a little disappointed in the flavor.  I will try a more robust wine next time.

loved it - modified it slightly - I cooked the chicken in the sauce for 5 minutes then removed it from the pot and broiled it.  While the chicken was broiling I added mushrooms and yellow squash into the red wine mixture.  Increased the wine to 2 cups.  Added some roux to thicken the sauce.  Removed the chicken from the broiler and added it back into the sauce.  Turned out great.

I modified this recipe a bit, and my boyfriend and I loved it.  He said it was one of the best meals he's had.  While sauteing the garlic, i added half a white onion, and carmalized them both.  When i added the wine, i also added crushed red pepper, and flour to thicken it a tad.  At the end i tossed in fresh basil, and served over wheat linguine, and green beans! Delicious!!!!!

So we took some advice and cut the sugar by half but did add and extra 1/2 cup of water.  We also added some white onions while we simmered the chicken in the sauce.  It was the bomb and we will definately make it again.  Taste it while it simmers as we needed to add some more salt.  Check the pic as it went well with some egg noodles and green beans.

Just made this tonight.  The sauce came out decent (reduced the sugar by a bit and added more garlic) but the chicken came out to be very VERY dry.  Will NOT be making again.

I followed almost all the ingredients (I halved the sugar, that seemed too much), but instead of simmering on the stove, I left it on low in the slow cooker all day...delicious!

Wonderful. Did not use as much sugar however, it still turned out sweet. My husband and son enjoyed it. I served it over rice which balanced the richness. I will keep this as a regular recipe/

I LOVE this chicken!  I use a drier wine to balance out the sweetness of the brown sugar.  If you don't like sweeter sauces you might not like this recipe as much as I do though--even using a drier wine won't make it a non-sweet sauce.   The last time I made this I added a bit of fresh rosemary to the sauce as it was reducing.  Love it!

I made this tonight and really enjoyed it quite a bit.  Not only was it quite simple and quick to prepare, but it was one of the most tasty chicken dishes I've had in quite a long time.  We served it with a caprese salad and seasoned couscous.  The only fault with the chicken came from over measuring the brown sugar.  This made it a bit too sweet for my taste but that is rectified easily enough next time...and there will DEFINITELY be a next time :)

I dont have any paprika so I had to leave out that ingredient. I usually make this with tenderloin but any cut of meat should work fine. There is a special place in Heaven for whoever made up this recipe. This has gotta be the best chicken I have ever ever had in my entire life. Family shares my sentiments.

This dish is de-licious!! I've made it twice, Be careful w/the brown sugar b/c it can become too sweet. You can let the wine sauce reduce even further and toss the pasta in the left overs.

Following some of the previous reviews, I halved the brown sugar, paprika, and red wine, and I am glad that I did.  This was a flavorful and easy to prepare dish.  The sweet and salty are very well-balanced, and the wine adds a depth of flavor with very little effort.

I loved this recipe and so did my husband. I cooked it like they said, but added mushrooms, onion, and a ton of garlic just like other users. I also only added about 3 heaping tablespoons of the brown sugar and a lot more wine:). It came out really yummy and I actually made some extra of the sauce to give it a little more flavor. I paired it with garlic mashed potatoes. I will definatly make this again.

Cute recipe to 3 servings.  Added garlic salt to chicken and sauce and 2 small cans of chopped portabella mushrooms to dish.  Served over salt, peppered and buttered linguine. Wonderfully, unique and a good change.  Will make again!  Too spicy for 4 yr old - think paprika was to much for him.  Hubby LOVED and raved about.  I loved as well!  Very interesting recipe!

very tasty. i decreased the amount of sugar based on reviews, and it was still plenty sweet! i also chopped up a red potato into small pieces and cooked them until fork-tender. then i tossed them right in the sauce! they soaked up some of the juice and got tender and delicious. i never would've paired chicken with a red wine sauce. thanks for the idea!

I have to say that I have never cooked with wine before. Knowing that I say this. I guess I used too much wine and not enough brown sugar. The chicken was moist, and good(underneath the wine flavor)but it just had no real pizzazz. I would love to try this recipe again, I am just a bit nervous about using the wine. I read from other reviewers that this recipe is too sweet, but I didn't have that problem. In my opinion it was too bitter.

Excellent!!
Followed the advice of the top reviewer and it came out perfect...not too sweet at all.
Next time I'll try adding mushrooms like someone else suggested.

Too sweet. I recommend cutting the sugar in half. I added some sliced onion to the sauce which may have accounted for some of the sweetness, but not all of it. I also added some tarragon which seemed to complement the sweet wine sauce pretty well.

Very good.  I made it with lamb chops, and it worked very well.  I used about 2/3 cup brown sugar instead of a cup.  If I were making pork chops, I'd go ahead and use the whole cup.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!!!! I used everything that the recipe suggested!!! Also the last time I ran out of red wine and used sherry wine instead.  It was perfect!!! My fiance' LOVES IT and it is very easy to make.  I usually serve over whole wheat pasta with some type of green veggie on the side.  Also, I cook my chicken within the sauce longer, so it forms a perfect glaze over the chicken.  There is still enough sauce left for the pasta, but it is just thicker.

This recipe is great!! Love it.  As for the measurements, if you change the number of servings (right above the recipe) it will help with the measurements.  This recipe is for a serving of 12...not very realistic for families.  I changed it to 3 and it calls for only 1/4 c wine.

I followed the recipe exactly and we all loved it! Even the kids were wanting 2nds! I was hesitant because I dont like the taste of wine but the brown sugar toned it down. Very yummy!

Not as great as I expected by all the other reviews. It could've been that I modified the servings, but it was way too sweet and the chicken was dry (could be that my daughter had a pee-pee accident in the middle of my cooking). I am going to give it another shot, but eliminate the brown sugar and substitute fresh OJ and I think I will add mushrooms as someone suggested.

I've made this recipe twice though somehow my 2nd attempt didn't come out nearly as good as the 1st. Strange how this happens.. I must've altered it somehow before I cooked it the 1st time.. Gotta make notes next time! =P

This recipe made candied chicken, and not in a good way. I thought I might like it if I reduced the sugar. I love sweet and sour chicken, and lots of other sweet chicken recipes, so after reading some of the other reviews, I was willing to try it. I always taste food during the cooking process for flavor. I found I had to empty half the juice and add more red wine. It was still too sweet. I think the main problem with this recipe is that there is no balance of flavors. I used a Burgundy wine, but I think something much drier would be needed. For those of you who try this and find you don’t care for it, I was able to salvage the chicken by cooling it, chopping it up, adding onions, celery, low-fat mayonnaise, and salted peanuts for chicken salad.

Really good!  I did mine in the slow cooker:  I used about a cup and a half of red wine, about 1/3 cup of brown sugar, garlic powder, salt and pepper.  I mixed it up and added the chicken, then cooked on low for two and a half hours.  Incredibly moist and great flavor!

I didnt care for this recipe much. It was oookay but I def. wont be making it again. All I could taste was chicken and red wine. The plus side was that it made the chicken super moist and tender. Other than that, not so great.

My whole family loved this recipe! After reading many reviews, I decided to cut back on the sugar also.  I used 3/4 cup of wine and 1/4 cup of chicken broth.  It was still sweet, but very flavorful.  It would be way too sweet with all the sugar.  Great recipe, and I'll definitely make it again.

This is a simple, quick and tasty dish, that will be sure to satisfy a picky eater.  The dish is sweet though, so if you need to, cut down on the brown sugar to make it less sweet.  Also be sure to use a good wine to perfect the dish.

This was an easy and delicious dish to fix. Made it for company and they really enjoyed it. Followed suggestion of a few reviewers to not use quite as much sugar and it was still a hit with everyone. I just sort of "eyeballed" it when it came to the paprika and brown sugar. Thanks for the recipe.

We used skinless BONE-IN chicken breasts which made the cooking times provided in the recipe about right.   The sauce ingredients are deceiving sounding – they’re a very good pair once the recipe is complete.  Very easy, quick to prepare & delicious, to boot. 
Give this a try!

I have to admit I was a little skeptical about this one because it uses a lot of brown sugar.  I am not a huge fan of sweet sauces.  But I was pleasently suprised how tasty this dish was!!!

It was okay if you like sweet things.  The chicken came out a little dry because the cook time is too long.  I'm not sure I would make this again.

Maybe it was just me but I thought this wasn't all that great.  It was ok.  I used 2 parts wine to 1 part brown sugar after reading the reviews.  Probably won't make again.  Rather drink the wine.

I would give this 3 1/2 stars, the flavor was pretty good, but like others said "the dish was pretty sweet in flavor."  Also, I wish the sauce was much thicker, it didn't mix great with the noodles.  I also added mushrooms and onions to give it a little bit more of a marsala feel.  I don't know if I will make this again, I might just stick with a marsala next time...good luck and enjoy.

This was terrible, it was way too sweet and I cut the brown sugar in half.  I added mushrooms and onions but that did not help.

My husband and I both love this recipe.  The first time I made it, my chicken did not turn colors; the 2nd time I made it, they did have a purple tinge to them.  Not sure why?  I added mushrooms to the wine and brown sugar while it simmered.  This is a definite repeat in our house!

I agree with others that this chicken was bit dry.  I definately needed more sauce if you serve it over noodles like I did.  I took the chicken out when it was done and tried to thicken the sauce, but for some reason, when I added a bit of flour, the flour would only clump up and not mix in.  That was just an error on my part, I'm sure.  I liked the flavor fine, but it was nothing spectacular.  I know others complained of it being too sweet, but I actually added a little bit extra brown sugar and it was not too sweet for me.

My husband and I liked it, but feel it needed a bit more flavor. next time I'll add more spices. 
I also laid it on a bed of rice instead of noodles.

This wasn't all bad, but it didn't go over very well in my house.  I reduced the sugar by half and it was still far too sweet for my taste.  I don't think I'll make this again.

this was pretty good. i think it was the wine i used though, it was something new i was trying and i didn't really care for it but didn't want to waste it so i decided to use it in this. the chicken had a good flavor, but again i think the wine came through a little too much. i will try it again with a wine that i know i like. thanks for the recipe!

This was awesome!  I served it with angel hair but would also be really good with rice...remined me of Bourbon Chicken you'd get at a Chinese restaurant but with wine...I actually might try this substituting bourbon for the wine.  Great recipe, thanks!!!

I'm very much a beginner cook, but even I was able to whip up this DELICIOUS recipe.  I wasn't able to time the cooking of the chicken to make the sauce thick, but served over a bed of pasta this wasn't a problem.  I may reduce the sugar next time as the sauce was a bit sweet.  Thank you for a delicious, beautiful, easy-to-cook entree!

Just OK. I found the chicken to be dry and overcooked with the cooking time written. Perhaps it would be better if the chicken was moist. Probably won't try again, the sauce didn't really do it for me or my husband. (My kids didn't even eat it and they usually chow down on any kind of chicken.)

Very good.  I thought it would be too sweet but suprisingly it was not, and the wine with the sugar complimented each other nicely.

I used chopped onion (sauted with the garlic) as recommended and kept the lid on while cooking the chicken.  Kept the chicken moist.  I used merlot and did not find it too sweet at all - Good flavor, will make again!

This was so delicious and easy to prepare. So pretty it could be (and will be!) made for company. I used Shiraz wine and added onions. I reduced the recipe for two chicken breasts - but would have made more sauce had I known how good it was. So, so, so good!

LOVED IT!  I have made this reciepe three times now and it always comes out great.  I only used two chicken breasts so I reduced the brown sugar to 1/4 cup but used the full amount of wine called for.  The sauce was excellent with rice.  Thank you, Robin!

I made a few easy revisions: I added a whole onion, sliced and sauteed with the garlic; I used a whole cut-up chicken (with skin and bones); and I added another cup of red wine (I used a boujellouis).  Because the chicken had bones, I simmered for an hour.  My family gave rave reviews, even the picky one!  Will definitely make again!!!

I just made this recipe tonight and it was excellent! I made Uncle Ben's garlic wild rice with it, which complimented the garlic and sweetness of the chicken. It needed a bit more sauce to pour over the chicken though. So next time I'll make more sauce.

This was great! Husband and I both loved it. 
I added some baby portabellas and crimini mushrooms- next time will live them in whole pieces.  
Be careful with how "sticky" this recipe gets!

Will definitely make again!

easy to make... 1 cup of sugar is way too much... id reduce it to somewhere around 1/4-1/2 cup... i added onions and mushrooms... served with chicken flavored rice... overall... decent... way too much sugar...

A good way to use that icky red wine my dad keeps cranking out.  I recommend doubling the sauce as it was very good over brown rice.

Yum!  I have made this recipe several times and everyone loves it.  I love the way the brown sugar tastes with the wine.  Tastes great with a side of wild rice.

I didn't really care for this, although my husband didn't mind it.  I think it may have been that the red wine I used was too rich.  It left kind of a bitter taste in my mouth.

Be careful on the sauce.  Don't turn your back on it for a second, mine cooked away and came out on the really thick and slightly burnt side.  I'm going to try it again, because I know what I'm doing this time :)

I love this recipe. I have made it a dozen times and it is a FAVORITE way to cook chicken. The sauce seems unusual for chicken since it has red wine but it is fantastic. I also let the chicken finish cooking during the simmer to reduce dryness when using boneless breasts. Have also succesfully used other chicken parts as well. Thanks for sharing this recipe, it will be passed down in my family. Even the kids love it.

This was ok, but not great.  I also used less sugar..about 3/4 cup, but if I make it again, I will try 1/2 cup.

This was an awesome recipe.  I was a bit hesitant at first but it had some great flavor.  I also cut down on the brown sugar based on past reviews and found it just perfect.  I will make this again.  As it cooked longer and sat, the sauce thickend and almost made a gravy.

very sweet, especially if you reduce the sauce...
the sauce thickens and makes for great dipping. definitely go lightly on the paprika.
