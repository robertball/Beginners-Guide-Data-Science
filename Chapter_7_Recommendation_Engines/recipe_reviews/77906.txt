This was quite good despite my inability to follow directions.  Left out the mushrooms due to the Mrs.'s faulty taste buds but other than that (and the addition of julienned red bell pepper) used the same ingredients though did not measure anything.  I did not catch to add the pesto after cooking and I think I lost a lot of the flavor in the oven.  I did marinate the fish in salt water for a couple hours and that flavor took nicely.  The chili oil was HOT HOT before cooking but left only a slight - super slight - hint of it afterward.  The fish texture was marvelous and the brine seemed to extract much of the fishiness from it leaving it smooth and buttery.  Oh did not use any butter but added a little sesame oil to the potatoes but still my wife swore the entire dish had a wonderful buttery flavor.  I expected something much more pungent but it was still quite nice never-the-less.

Could not find Chervil, so eliminated it - also only used pesto sauce on veggies, because Sea Bass was fresh caught, and didn't want to change the flavor. Excellent.

Excellent recipe - but you must use Chervil -- I found at Meijers with other herbs - i.e.thyme, etc.-  Gave it a very nice flavor -- I also added 3 garlic cloves to the onion/mushroom mixture -a nd when they are softened, add the new potatoes ( but cut them up first) --Two other things - be generous with the Chili Oil - I brushed it on generously - bth sides - and don't worry - it gives no heat after cooking. Just a nice gentle kick - and make sure you warm the pesto before scooping over the fish. Great recipe and we'll definitely make again.

Delicious! I tried it out for the first time without having any idea how its going to taste... i took a risk to impress my father-in-law and it looked so gourmet and tasted fantastic that i think it worked! I served it w my own home baked multi grain whole wheat bread with olive oil dip... he liked it and went for seconds, and it completely finished. I substituted the chervil with tarragon because i could not find it at the grocery store and i heard they are similar in taste, though tarragon is stronger. and i used sesame chilli oil, which was all i could find, but it added a great flavor with 2 tbsp of pesto sauce on top. I think i added too much salt though and could've done with less. it was very quick to prepare, and it took just 5 min each side to broil the fish.

I didn't have Chervil on hand and I added the pesto to the onion, mushroom and cooked cubed potato mix. I used a sweet onion, instead of red and I put all of this on top of broiled bass fillets and it was delicious! I will make this again.

This recipe makes for a nicepresentation and is quite simple. I actually put the new potatoes in a bowl and microwave them about 5 minutes until tender. Saves time and one burner on the stove and I never notice any difference in taste. I also replaced the chervil with cilantro. I find chervil to be a bland herb that doesn’t do this dish justice. If you’re not a fan of cilantro, you can use just about any herb that suites your particular tastes in the “slash and stuff” part of this recipe.

Excellent!-This was my 1st attempt at cooking fish! It turned out great and will definitely be making it again for my pescatarian boyfriend soon. Easy to make and the sautéed portobello/onions gave the dish a complex but complimentary taste to the (Chilean) sea bass,
