I used my own, homemade pie crust recipe, since the packaged products all seem to have lard. I also substituted 6 oz real whipping cream instead of the artificial whipped topping.  The real thing tastes so much better! Any brownie recipe that can be baked in an 8x8 pan will work, and if I couldn't find peanut butter chips, I might use mini Reese's cups or break up a toffee bar like Heath's.

I made this for a birthday party and it was SO good, but incredibly rich. I have a deep hatred for cool whip so I subbed homemade whipped cream- according to what I found about 3 cups of whipped cream is equivalent to an 8oz container of cool whip but I just did it by taste. I also skipped the chopped peanuts and chocolate chips in favor of chopped mini reese's cups. So good!
[Update: I made this again, without the brownie, and it was just as good- more of a mousse.]

I don't think I will be making this very often - because I could have ate the whole darn pie myself! Oh my! This one is a keeper.  Followed the recipe exactly. It came out perfect and was firm enought to cut into small pieces which was necessary because it is very rich. I read the other reviews and wished I had used chopped up peanut butter cups too. If cutting the pie when it is cold it is hard to cut - let it sit out for a bit and it makes cutting much easier.

Awesome indulgent dessert that will be a hit for the young and young at heart.  I don't know why anyone would go through the work of making this and then reviewing it poorly as "too rich"...hello...its brownie and peanut butter whip topping, I think we all know what we're getting into here!  anyway...I used a deep dish crust, but couldn't fit it all into one...so each time I make this recipe I make two and surprise a friend with the extra - so far everyone has really liked this dessert - its a special treat for sure!

I made 5 pies for Thanksgiving this year, and this one was by far the most popular. It is so delicious.  I had to add more water to the brownie mix, and it ended up being very thick brownie, but then I realized later my brownie packages were more than 15.5 oz so next time I know to adjust to the size of the mix.  I doubled the peanut butter chips as well as the peanut butter in the topping because things never have enough peanut butter for my husbands tastes if I don't.  For those who are a little less in love with peanut butter than he is, I'd recommend sticking with the recipe.  This is definitely one of my favorite pie recipes and one I will make often!

Phenomenal pie! You must be certain to get the 15oz brownie mix (not 18oz) or you can mess the whole brownie portion up! This is one of my new go-to recipes, as it's a hit every time!

This was good, but like other reviewers have noted, there is too much brownie for the bottom layer. And I think the cooking time indicated is too long as the brownie portion was too hard. That said, the top was good.  I will make again, but have to tweek the bottom layer.

This was very good!  It was easy to make.  It's very rich tasting, so small pieces are best.  One caution...I did not make it in a glass pie pan as directed (I didn't have one).  I found that I cooked the brownie much longer than suggested because my cake tester did not come out clean after the recommended time.  This, however, made my brownie a bit hard.  The taste was still good, but I will cook it less next time and take it out before the cake tester comes out clean.

There is too much brownie for this pie, and not enough peanut butter. I added extra peanut butter and the tast was good, but texturally it is off.  Not sure if I will make it again but if I do I would cut the amount of brownie batter in half.

This pie was delicious....but very hard to cut in the pie crust.  My brownie layer was very firm.  Maybe I didn't mix it properly?

I used mini Reeses cups, chopped, in the brownie mix. Next time I'll use real whipped cream. This pie was the hit of the holiday, thank you!

This was my third attempt at a peanut butter pie because my husband LOVES anything with peanut butter.  This one was by far the best out of the 3 recipes that I tried.  The first time I made it exactly as stated except I used a pre-made chocolate pie crust because that was what I had on hand.  It didn't work with that crust, but the filling was soooo good, that I had to try again.  The next time I made it with no crust and just let the brownie be the crust.  Also, I drizzled the top with chocolate sauce and put peanut butter chips on top.  AMAZING!!!  Just the right mix of peanut butter, chocolate, and creamy goodness.

This was the best pie ever!!  I made it just like the recipe states but I did not put chopped peanuts on top since no one in my family likes nuts.  Instead I cut up peanut butter chips along with the mini chocalte chips and sprinkled that combo on top.

Very rich with interesting texture.  Needs vanilla ice cream to balance the richness.

Great! Made it for Thanksgiving dinner, and the layer of brownie added a lot. Skipped the shavings of chocolate on top and just sprinkled with chocolate and peanut butter chips, it looked AND tasted great.

My new favorite pie! OMG this pie is amazing and very rich. I lightened it up by using only 2 tbsp canola oil & 1/3 cup no sugar added applesauce, fat free cream cheese, agave nectar instead of sugar, nixed the whipped topping & chocolate chips. YUM.

This is very good!! I couldn't find the right size of brownie mix so I just bought a bigger box and measured out the right amount of ounces. I don't think that it would matter though if I had used it all! I also used one of those frozen pie crusts since it's hard for me to crimp the sides where they look nice!

The idea of this is great, but the execution was not so great in my mind.  The textures don't really mesh together too well - the pie crust, brownie, and fluffy top layer just feel weird in your mouth.  The pie crust I think is completely unnecessary and doesn't add anything.  Also, the topping tasted a whole lot more like cream cheese than peanut butter to me.

This is a Great recipe. I did alter the ingredients some as I did not have all the ingredients or right amounts. Some cooks said the brownie bottom was to thick. So i had 2 frozen ready made pie crusts i poured 1 box of preped brownie mix into both crusts evenly cooked as specified and cooled. I used 2 containers of whipped topping and only 1 package of cream cheese. 1 cup of the sugar and 1 cup of peanut butter. I did not add the nuts or candied chips. I had Mini Peanut butter cups and chopped them up and topped off the pies. It came out great. The different layers make for a great tasting pie. Thanks for posting :D

I made this for Thanksgiving. It was a crowd pleaser for sure. I did not put peanut butter cups in the brownie mix and I just fudge brownie mix. I wanted to me smooth and it was great. It was a little weird to pure a brownie mix in a pie crust but.........it was NOT overly sweet or peanut buttery

Pretty good.  Actually did not make it in a pie crust and it came out good, maybe just messier.  Sprinkled pb chips and choc chips on top.

This pie was a hit with my chocolate and peanut butter lovers.  I added some chopped reesie's peanute butter cups to the brownie mix.  I chopped candied peanuts and sprinkled them on the top.  Perfect!

This was AMAZING!!!  I could not find the type of brownie mix it called for so I just used a Betty Crocker brand that baked at the same temp and time as the pie crust did so I did not have to worry about folding the foil over the pie crust edge.  I read reviews before making this, and I added a half cup more of peanut butter in the filling because my brother is a peanut butter nut. He added a whole bag of peanut butter chips to the top! It was very good.  Highly recommend for peanut butter lovers!!

The flavor was really good, but the textures didn't mesh that great and when I was cutting it up, the top mousse would separate off the brownie.

this was certainly an easy dessert, very pretty in presentation. I gave it to a friend who was ill and she liked it very much, but I would recommend very small pieces, because it is VERY sweet.

This was pretty good, although if I make it again I think I'll skip the pie crust part.  The brownie part got really hard and it was difficult to cut.  Other than that the flavor was really good and I'd make it again.

I will be making this for Thanksgiving but there are lots of ways to lighten it up.  I will use No Pudge Brownie mix, low fat cream cheese and cool whip free.  It will be just as good and nearly half the calories.

I have not made this recipe yet but it seems really good based on picture and the reviews I read.Saying that, some reviews say that the brownie layer is a bit too hard because of the cooking time and that the amount of it should be adjusted..... How much should each thing be changed? Just so I know when I make it (:

So good. I followed another reviewer and didn't even use a pie crust. It didn't need it.

Make brownies thin! Pour extra batter in side pan- too much brownie makes pie difficult to eat

This pie was awesome!  Although, I thought my brownie would be baked after 35 minutes, when jiggled it looked set, the brownie portion was not like a brownie at all.  It was almost like a creamy fudge, which we liked even better than a brownie texture.  Not sure if it was supponse to be like that, but we sure did like it!! Would definitely make this again...and I wouldn't bake the brownie any longer than I did this time.  It was awesome.

Made this at camp for Memorial Day using the convection setting on my toaster oven. I pretty much followed the recipe, but used a Duncan Hines brownie mix following the instructions for the "fudge type" brownies, spreading the mix up the sides of the pie crust. For the topping, I added some dark special morsels (instead of semi-sweet)and peanut butter morsels, in addition to the the chopped peanuts. I feel that the pie crust helped slightly in cutting the richness. This pie is restaurant quality delicious!

This was great. We agreed with other posters- you don't need the pie crust. I will make it again without. 
Very rich. Makes a lot.

Love this! I used pre-made mini graham cracker pie crusts in the disposable tins. I used my favorite brownie box mix- Ghirardelli Ultimate Fudge- and spooned it into the crust about half full. I don't remember the bake time. Probably around 15 min. Use a toothpick and test (1" from the edge) until it comes out clean.

Awesome! One of my new favorites! I added Reese Cups to the brownie batter as well as on top of the final product. I also added a drizzle of chocolate syrup to the top...along with the peanuts and chocolate chips. Yummy! It was a hit at our family Thanksgiving!

I made this a few Thanksgivings ago, and it was delicious! I substituted the homemade crust for a pre made graham cracker crust. I've also used a pre made oreo crust. I just made the brownies like normal and cut out a circle piece to fit into the bottom of the pre made crust. Then followed the directions for the mousse topping.
