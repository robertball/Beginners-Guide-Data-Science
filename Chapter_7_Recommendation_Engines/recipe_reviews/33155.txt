I have been making this recipe for years and I can't believe I have never reviewed it! This is my go to recipe for muffins -they always get rave reviews and everyone asks for the recipe. I substitute whole wheat flour for half the flour called for. I also add 1 tsp of vanilla for a little more flavor. I have also made this with strawberries and they are great. Seriously, thank you so much for this recipe, I make it ALL the time!! (The batter also freezes really well)
9/19 - update. Still my favorite muffin recipe. I no longer soak the oats in the orange juice, I just mix all the dry ingredients, mix the wet and then incorporate the wet into the dry and add whatever fruit I want. Finely chopped candied ginger and nuts with the blueberries is a great combo.

I did mix the ingredients up a little differently. After the orange juice and oatmeal had a chance to sit for 10 minutes, I stirred in the white sugar, vegetable oil and egg. Once those were combined, I folded in the dry ingredients and the blueberries. I did get 12 biggish muffins out of this recipe. I baked them at 350* for a little over 20 minutes. These looked very pretty and were moist with the perfect amount of sweetness. The flavor that the orange juice gave to the muffins was a nice addition. My family enjoyed these muffins, especially slathered with butter.

This is a great way to change up your ordinary blueberry muffin.  I replaced the oil with unsweetened applesauce and used half splenda/half sugar. Also added 1 tsp. vanilla... Nice addition to the healthy food repertoire.  I am looking forward to trying this with cranberries.

I found that if you follow the amount of baking powder in this recipe as directed, it is just way too much.  It leaves a chemical taste to the muffins.  Not good!!  

I actually did a little research (Wikipedia is awesome!) on why this is...  when a recipe has excess acidity (as this one does due to the OJ) the baking power doesn't fully react and you get that chemical taste left behind.  A number of reviewers said that they halved the amount of baking power just by intuition.  Well, I guess there is science behind it too!

good muffins, even after all my modifications! I used freshly ground whole wheat flour, honey  with an additional 1/4 tsp of soda instead of sugar, applesauce for the oil, added 1 tsp of vanilla (we love vanilla) and left off the sugar topping.  Next time I may use a little more than a cup of blueberries - ran out of blueberries for the last muffin.

I just made these after getting the recipe in the weekly email. They are great muffins and my kids loved them. The batter is really stiff before adding the OJ and oats which made me think I was doing something wrong but they turn out fantastic.

These were very easy to make and quite yummy!  I agree that the texture was not like your typical muffin.  The oats do make it a little closer to a scone or biscuit in texture, but personally I prefer this.  I would say these are the best homemade muffin I've had!  Thanks for the recipe.

Everyone loved the muffins. I changed the recipe a bit to make them healthier. I used wheat flour, splenda for the sugar, eggbeater for the egg, natural appplesauce for the oil and I added orange extract for flavor. This way they fit into my WW and heart consious diet.

absolutely delicious! i even used frozen blueberries but you couldn't tell that they weren't fresh. they tasted amazing right out of the oven, later that night, the next morning, etc., but my roommates liked them so much that they didn't last much longer than that...

p.s. i added an extra crunch to the top by mixing oatmeal in with the cinnamon and sugar. SO good!

Very good muffins. I followed the recipes as is and added fresh peaches also, approx 1/2 a cup along with the blueberries.  I will make these again. They are perfect hot with a bit of butter.

I followed the recipe exactly, except that I substituted pineapple juice for the orange juice. They were good, but not anything special. The batter was really dry and they didn't rise much in the oven. They were more like crumb cakes than muffins in both texture and taste.

This is a tender and moist muffin with subtle orange flavor that really worked well with the blueberries.  I had tons of oat crumble topping leftover from "Rhubarb Crunch," also from this site, and these were the ideal muffin to use it on.  These mixed up in just a couple of minutes and disappeared just as quickly.

My new favorite blueberry muffin recipe.  I had no problem with the amount of baking powder; but I used 1 cup whole wheat pastry flour, so that may be why (I often increase bking powder & soda when using whole wheat flour).  I used unsweetened applesauce instead of the oil. I also only had rolled oats - so that's what I used with great results.  This muffin is not cakey, and surprisingly not "gummy," which I expected from using the applesauce.  It's hearty and just barely sweet, with an essence (not a flavor) of orange that is really lovely.  Excellent with a pat of butter and some tea.  Note that I've also added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts and 2 Tbsp of flax meal for a protein kick, and that made them even better.  These crown perfectly and really hit the spot.  I'm tossing my other blueberry muffin recipes, including the "to die for" one on allrecipes - this is what a blueberry muffin should taste like.  Thanks for a great recipe!

My muffins were just OK and rather bland, though I used sesame oil which is very flavorful. I will try some more sugar next time.

After making this for years now, I LOVE it and more importantly, so do my kids.  I do feel that you must add two eggs, not just one.  They stick together much better.  I also make it with whole wheat flour, I add flax, and sometimes wheat gluten and dough enhancer.  I add a bit more concentrated orange juice.  This is great!

Awesome muffins - not dry at all. Best fresh out of the oven; nice and tender with  a beautiful crumb! I've tried all kinds of blueberry muffin recipes, and this one is easy, delicious and one of the best I've tried! I made two batches over the weekend with fresh-picked blueberries and am eating some for breakfast this morning. I wouldn't change a thing about this outstanding recipe. Thanks!

I chose this recipe because I had the ingredients on hand, but I'm so glad I did!  You can't tell that there's oatmeal in it when you eat the muffins, but it gives it a great texture for those like me who don't like a cupcake texture muffin.  The orange flavor is subtle, complements the blueberries, and gives it something different.  We've all had tons of blueberry muffins, so it's nice to have one that is a variation on the theme.  I would bring these to a potluck and will definitely make them again.

YES! This is it! This is the best muffin recipe I've tried. 

But... I confess. I did make it my own. 

I was out of OJ so I made my own lemonade by zesting 1 lemon then microwaving it for 20 seconds and juicing well. (pulp and all) I poured that juice and zest into a 1/2 cup measuring cup and topped it off with water. I added 2 Tb of sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract to that. Then stirred in the oats and set aside. 

The only other changes I made were pretty basic. I added melted butter instead of vegetable oil and used a heaping cup of fresh blueberries. Instead of Sprinkling sugar and cinnamon on top I put on Vanilla Sugar (just a couple cups of sugar in a container with some post-use vanilla bean pods). 

These were a little dry when mixing it all together and I was nervous about that so I added in about 3-4 tablespoons of milk before folding in the blueberries. Mine came out moist, but set. I'll probably just make a little more lemonade mixture the next time I make these. Yes ... there will be a next time!!!

This is okay. It's like all the reviews say. Texture is scone-like, not cakey. Has a mild chemical taste, but the OJ flavour is intensified the next day. A shot of vanilla would have improved things.

These muffins were a huge success for me! I used half a cup of whole wheat flour, and frozen domestic blueberries. The muffins were quite dense, and not at all dry, with a lovely flavour. My blueberries were huge, so when I first took the muffins out they were close to falling apart. But once they cooled, they were completely stable!

Yummy! I followed the recipe exactly (using frozen blueberries) and they were perfect. The orange juice gives it more of a " morning muffin" flavor! I highly recommend these!!

If you are on a dairy free diet, this is an excellent, versatile recipe!  I have used a tropical juice with strawberries, made as written, and my latest variation was apple juice and shredded apples.  Great muffins!

I could not BELIEVE how tasty these muffins came out. I used more (fresh) orange juice then called for and added a little of my pulp. I also added some vanilla- it just felt wrong to leave it out! when they came out I felt inspired by my behive muffin pans and topped them with honey and powdered sugar. They were GONE as fast as that! DEFINATLY a keeper!

Really good!  I made it exactly except added 1 tsp of vanilla and cut the baking powder down to 1 tsp.  It's a really thick batter and it doesn't rise much but it's delicious!  The kids LOOOOVED THEM!

These muffins taste good but are not usual muffin consistency. They are more like scones.

I have made this recipe countless times. My new favorite alteration is to swap out the vegetable oil for unrefined coconut oil. Yum, better tasting and better for you. They fill up a big 6 muffin cup tin quite nicely. I make them so often that I have a container filled with cinnamon/sugar ready to go at a moment's notice.

These were pretty tasty and baking them was pretty easy and quick. Although they tasted good, I thought they were a bit bland. I think a bit of vanilla and some lemon zest would really add a nice kick. I'd also like them to be a little fluffier, more cake like. I did love the oats in the batter, I have never baked with oats. I would definitely give it a shot because you may enjoy it.

These were very good with the changes I made based on the reviews. I substituted 1/2 c of flour for whole wheat, used 1/3 c of oil and 3/4 c of buttermilk + 1/4 tsp of orange extract instead of OJ. Also I didn't use salt at all and added 1 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp of soda. I use aluminum-free baking powder and haven't had any issues with metallic taste.

These were very moist and delicious, not too sweet with just a touch of texture from oats and flour. They also kept well till the next morning (I did have to guard them though). My 2 year old enjoyed them very much, as well as the rest of the family.

Used old fashioned oats, all whole wheat flour, fresh blueberries, and used only 1/4c of canola oil and 1/2c unsweetened applesauce. So good and you can really taste the orange juice. Different and semi-healthy with a few changes such as these. Kids enjoyed...thanks!

Awesome Recipe!!! Doubled recipe and used white whole wheat flour instead of all purpose and subbed half oil for apple sauce. I also added more blueberries because i wanted to use them up! For flavor, I also added cinnamon and vanilla and I didnt use the topping. Thanks for sharing!!!

This recipe is fantastic. I am horrible at baking but even I could not mess this one up.  I made this muffins in an attempt to get fiber into my 2 year old so I used whole wheat flour in place of all-purpose. I used probably closer to 1 1/4 cups instead of 1 1/2.  The muffins came out so good (and I usually don't like whole wheat flour muffins) I can't imagine how good they would be white white flour.

I followed the receipe exactly but used frozen berries instead of fresh ones. The outcome...top extremely crispy like a snap and inside with absolutely no flavor other than when I bite into a fruit. In my second batch (I can only bake 6 muffins at a time), I added 2 extra tablespoons of white sugar & 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon into the mix. I also stir until the berries break open. The muffins were perfect!

I can hardly believe these delicious muffins are made with oats and are good for you! Just be prepared for the mixture to be dry- it will turn out fine. I loved the orange flavor.

I was given this same exact recipe (only it was called "Anita's blueberry muffins").  The only thing I did differently was to add 1/2 tsp nutmeg to the cinnamon-sugar mixture.  I can't begin to describe the incredible fragrance drifting through my house...makes me think of Christmas time!  Yummy - just a subtle hint of orange juice...not overwhelming at all!

Blueberries are so good for you, and so is the oatmeal.  I just couldn't resist when I read this recipe.  I got up early one morning and made them for my family before we were out the door for the day.  My husband ate 3 of them, and my son ate 2.  Needless to say, they didn't last long at my house.  A great healthy combination that I will make again.  Thanks for sharing!

My aunt gave me this recipes years ago and it holds high honors in my recipes box.  This muffin is not too sweet and has a texture more like a coffee cake than a cupcake.  They freeze well also, if they last that long.

The flavor of these muffins is outstanding. The only thing I did different was I used 1/4 teaspoon of salt simply because I'm cutting back on my salt intake. I also did 1 1/2 cups of blueberries instead of the 1 cup. Other than that, this recipe worked out wonderfully just as it is. Moist, and the sweetness was on point.

In my opinion, these were ok. The batter is super thick so don't be alarmed. They are indeed very dense, which isn't a bad thing, they just aren't amazing.

This is my go-to recipe for blueberry muffins. It's easy and the muffins are delicious. I don't change anything, except I only add about half of the sugar/cinnamon mixture to the tops at the end. Perfect every time.

I loved these muffins and so did my 14 month old. I didnt have rolled oats so I used baby oatmeal cereal. Also, we only had coconut palm sugar. Other then the two substations I followed the recipe exact. I was worried because the batter looked really dry but they turned out so good and were surprisingly moist.   Will definitely make again.

I had to change these quite a bit due to my son's food intolerances, but maybe these changes will work for someone else too. First, I used gluten free oats. Although oats themselves are gluten free, they are often processed in plants that also process wheat. Second, I used water instead of orange juice, dextrose instead of white sugar, gluten free all purpose flour instead of regular flour, and extra light tasting olive oil instead of regular vegetable oil. I sprinkled the tops with brown sugar mixed with cinnamon. The batter was extremely thick, but the muffins, although not smooth like regular muffins, did hold together after baking and cooling. My son was so pleased to get a treat that he can eat. Thank you for the inspiration!

These are delicious!  I used 50/50 wheat and white flour and didn't even taste the difference.  I may use Trop 50 OJ next time as they were definitely sweeter than I am used to. They are light and fluffy and have a nice texture to them.

Used less baking powder, substituted natural applesauce for oil, and added one teaspoon of vanilla, all as recommended.  Biggest substitution was that I used serviceberries in place of blueberries as we have two serviceberry bushes full of ripe berries. The muffins turned out absolutely delicious!

The ultimate in blueberry muffins.  At first, I was not sure about the addition of orange juice, but wow!  These are the very best blueberry muffins that I have ever made.  Everyone at work commented how great these were.

I used 3/4 cup white flour and 3/4 cup whole wheat flour, and also substituted applesauce for the oil to make this recipe a little healthier. I also used frozen blueberries and old fashioned oats, because that's what I had on hand...but let me tell you, these muffins were UH-mazing! The brown sugar/cinnamon topping was like the icing on the cake. And the orange juice? Brilliant. It added just the right amount of sweetness. My 2-year-old and 10-month-old both gobbled these up, and I know the rest of my family will love them too. I will definitely be making them again!

Made a few substitutions with what I had on hand. Used apple juice instead of orange and cinnamon applesauce instead of oil. Threw in an extra 1/2 C. blueberries and forgot to sprinkle the top with cinnamon/sugar. These were wonderful. Very dense.

Excellent muffins!  i followed the recipe exactly (with the exception of leaving off the sugar/cinnamon topping) and they were delish!  the kids loved them too.  easy recipe to follow and they come out great each time I've made them.

Modified recipe a little and I think it worked out to my advantage. Used 1/4 c brown sugar, only 1 tsp baking powder, and skipped the topping. I added 2 tsp of cinnamon, and 1 tsp of vanilla extract.  Also added a pinch of ground clove. Really good!

I was surprised that theses weren't dry, but were really quite good.  I baked the batter in an 11x7 glass dish for 20 min.  I didn't add the cinnamon sugar topping and probably added a little more blueberries than called for.  It was delicious and not overly sweet.  Will definitely keep the recipe and make again.

YUM!!  These were absolutely delicious!  I am on a  restricted sodium diet, and I substituted the baking powder for the sodium-free baking powder I have.  They turned out delicious.  I did sneak a few more fresh blueberries in it than a cup, too! I will be making another batch tomorrow morning and will probably be making them often for many many years to come!

I made these muffins with no alterations and they were delicious. Very moist and perfectly sweet! My only suggestion would be to double your recipe, because you are gonna want more of these babies!!!

Easily doubled recipe and delicious even with the substitution of whole wheat flour for part of the all-purpose flour (1/2 cup whole wheat and 1 cup all-purpose, or if doubling, 1 cup whole wheat and 2 cups all-purpose).

These were excellent!  I just pulled them out of the oven about 30 minutes ago and already my kids have eaten 3 mini muffins each.  As per others recommendations, I added 1 tsp vanilla.  Also, since I didn't have any veg oil on hand I substituted with applesauce.  I will definitely make these again

These muffins had a wonderful flavor and texture. I used one blueberry and cream oatmeal packet along with 1/4 cup of oatmeal. Sprinkled a little oatmeal and cinnamon sugar on top. Also added 2 tsp of vanilla for flavor. My new favorite blueberry muffin recipe.

L-O-V-E these muffins!!  They were a little crumbly, but had great flavor!  Didn't notice the oats - the juice and blending must have broken the oats down.  Regardless, very good and moist!

So good!  This is my mom's go-to recipe for blueberry muffins.  It's hard to tell they contain oatmeal and orange juice in the finished product.  My favorite part is the crunchy cinnamon sugar on top :)

this is a great healthier recipe! My husband and in-laws could not even tell it was a "modified healthy" muffin! I took the advice of other reviewers and used unbleached whole wheat flour, 1/4 cup natural applesauce and a 1/4 cup oil instead of all oil and added a teaspoon vanilla-they were just as moist. This recipe will stay in regular rotation!

I was making a meal for a family whose son had dairy allergies and this recipe fit the bill.  This recipe was easy to put together. It's very flavorful with the orange juice addition and that went well with the blueberries.  My own kids loved it and I passed the recipe along to the family who received them.  Thanks for a keeper of a recipe!

We really liked these muffins!  They weren't too sweet at all.  Dense, yet moist.  And we loved the crunch sweet topping.  I didn't have orange juice, so I grabbed a snack-size cinnamon applesauce and mixed it with water and added to the oats instead.  Used frozen blueberries, thawed and rinsed/dried and it turned out great!  Made 6 jumbo muffins instead of 12 smaller ones.

These were pretty good. I didn't make any changes to the recipe posted. My mom loved them; my friend and her siblings didn't so much. I liked that it didn't use so many blueberries, but I think I'll keep looking for a good low-fat high-fiber blueberry muffin.

These were very good muffins! I used frozen berries. I liked the texture; they were a bit denser than a regular muffin. The oats give a bit of a nutty flavor and a little chewiness. They had the perfect amount of sweetness. The cinnamon/sugar topping is deliciously crispy when the muffins are right out of the oven, but won't stay that way if you store the muffins in a container. These muffins are very satisfying and a little healthier than a standard muffin. I would definitely make these again.

These muffins are so delicious! I love pretty much anything with oats, and I had some fresh blueberries from my grandmother's house, so I figured I'd give these a try.

I had about 1 1/4 cups of blueberries, so I dumped them all in. The muffins are extremely moist and blueberry-y, and the orange juice adds a nice taste. 

The texture wasn't at all like coffee cake. Definitely a muffin! And a superb one at that. I will be making these again, and possibly trying different berries.

Edited to add: I made these again with store-bought blueberries. They're  good, but with fresh blueberries, it was phenomenal!
Use fresh if you can!

they were only alright in my opinion.  the batter was really dry, and I thought maybe I had missed an ingredient or something.   there wasn't very good shape to the muffins either because they didn't have a chance to rise or anything, and they tasted more like scones.  Other than that, they weren't too bad.

My go-to muffin recipe. I've made them many times, but unlike with other recipes, don't tend to change much. I use half whole wheat and half white flower, as well as typically frozen blueberries for the sake of convenience. Otherwise, I tend to just make them as the recipe says (though doubled to account for how much my appetite increases when bread products are present), and they always turn out great.

More like a scone than a muffin, which I prefer. Recipe made 12 pretty small “muffins” so I’d try doubling the recipe next time.

I have to be honest, I had high hopes for these because of the rating. I was crazy about the flavor. If I had to pinpoint the issue I’d say it’s the Orange Juice. It gave it a weird tangy flavor mixed with the texture of the oats, just not for me. They weren’t terrible, I just wouldn’t make them again.

this was more like a scone than a muffin, but I like scones so I'm okay with it. I was surprised how dry the batter was and how much oil soaked my paper liners. 
I didn't have any orange juice so I used limeade but can't really taste any lime.

These are fantastic!  I was searching for a recipe that didn't use butter or milk, as I was out of both, and this recipe came up in my results. I'm amazed how light and fluffy they are, given that the batter was quite stiff after adding the wet ingredients. I added a mashed ripe banana for some extra nutritional value. I used steel cut quick oats, which gave a nice chewy texture, and the juice of two oranges. A real winner.

These muffins were really good! I've never made blueberry muffins with OJ in them before, but I really enjoyed that citrus taste in them. I'll definitely be making these again when I've got some blueberries and OJ in the fridge.

This is my first review in a long time! I made a few changes for health sake. I replaced oil with unsweetened applesauce, 3/4 cup of all-purpose with gram flour and used Spenda blend for sugar. The orange provides an interesting aftertaste- not bad, just interesting. Will for sure make this again

I made this recipe pretty much by the book; the only change was the ripe mashed banana I added (to use it up.)  The muffins taste really good, but are a little crumbly.  I might add 1/2 t. xanthan gum next time, just to improve the texture.  I love the nutritious indgredients this recipe uses!

I made some modifications so my dissatisfaction may be from that.  I used lemon juice and zest from 3 lemons instead of OJ.  Because the lemon is so strong I should have added more sugar or some cinnamon to balance the tart a bit.  I also added more blueberries. Otherwise, I didn't like the batter - way too dry and my muffins came out very small and didn't rise at all.

When warm---tender, moist and fluffy. Not the least bit rubbery, heavy, or tough, which happens with over-stirring.
When cool and set---they never did toughen or remind me of a scone. They were still tender, fluffy and tasty.
Marrrrvelous with morning coffee!

*Use 1/4 cup butter for 1/2 of the oil--makes a richer taste. 
*Absolutely add vanilla. I added 1 teaspoon. 
*I used only 1 teaspoon baking powder as suggested. No metallic taste.
*Use the zest from the orange. That sharpens the orange taste of the muffins and you'll never separate out the texture of it from the oatmeal, even if you don't typically like or use orange peel. Give it a try! 
*Egg sizes can vary, so I used two smaller eggs, where I'd have originally used one nice large egg. None in the carton met with my approval. : )
*Also, to activate the baking soda, add either a couple Tablespoons of buttermilk or plain yogurt. This will lighten the muffins considerably, and provide additional moisture to the batter. Mine was never dry or worrisome. 
*Put all the wet ingredients together with the oatmeal and set aside while you measure out the dry ingredients into another bowl. Then add the wet ingredients all at once to the dry, only stirring until just combined; fold in the blueberries. Overstir=rubber muffins.
*The suggested 1/2 tsp. nutmeg added to the topping is a must if you like nutmeg. It pairs with orange extremely well. 
*Use brown sugar when making the topping instead of white. It goes perfectly with oatmeal

These turned out great!! I didn't make any modifications at all. I think my blueberries were a little too big, which made an amusing mess inside the muffin papers, but they tasted delicious! I will definitely make these again.

With some alterations definitely 5 stars. First, make a double batch they will go quick. Soak the oats in milk, not orange juice. Use 1c. wheat, 2 c. all-purpose flour. Use 1/2 c. brown sugar and 1/2 c. vanilla protein powder. Use 1 c. cinnamon  applesauce instead of oil. Use 2 tsp baking powder. Use everything else as stated (but doubled of course since this is a double batch. lol) For mixing: Mix the sugar, protein powder and eggs into the oat and milk mixture then add to the dry ingredients. After they cool a bit smother with butter and if you feeling adventurous blueberry curd. Oh man! So good and surprisingly healthy.

This is the blueberry muffin recipe I have been hoping to find!  All the others I have tried were too sweet and cake like. This has a nice hardy texture that a muffin should have. Any time I add oats to a recipe I always stat with them and the liquids, that gives them time to soften and absorb moisture. If you add them to the dry ingredients they never moisten and get that "cooked" texture.. I also reduced the oil to 1/3 cup and added 1/2 cup Greek yogurt, this also helped with the  moisture. For a little more orange flavor I added the zest of one orange. I also followed the advise about the baking powder and only used 1 tsp and upped the baking soda to a scant1/2 tsp. What a winner this is thanks!

I used half and half whole wheat flour, large flake oats, and added a handful of ground flax and a half cup of oat bran (increased the juice very slightly). The juice I had on hand was Orange - Mango (fresh), and that worked well.  Also, after reading the other reviews, added a bit of vanilla. The texture and flavour of these muffins was perfect! will make again for certain.

I have been making these muffins for a long time. It's a family favorite. It's great as-is. However, I have made a few other options that are fantastic as well.
1. Egg free option: This recipe works well using Ener-G Egg replacer. Some of the richness is lost but the flavor shines through. I have a food allergic son who loves this recipe. 
2. Chocolate chip raspberry option: Replace the blueberries with raspberries, add 1/4 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips (mini chips work well), and omit the sugar/cinnamon topping. (Before my son could eat dairy I used Enjoy Life chocolate chips with great success in this recipe.)
3. I have also substituted the chicken egg with a duck egg and it turned out awesome!
This is a great recipe that adapts well for those with food allergies. I haven't made a single batch in years... it's always doubled!

I loved the texture of these muffins!  I used half whole wheat pastry flour.  I also used applesauce for 1/2 of the oil called for.   I added a touch of cinnamon to the batter (why not?), and a touch of vanilla.  We loved these and I will definitely keep this recipe!

I used melted coconut oil instead of vegetable oil, rolled oats instead of instant, and used a lemon juice and powdered sugar glaze (after they were baked instead) of the cinnamon and sugar sprinkle.  These were absolutely delicious.  The batter is very thick, they are a little like a scone, not quite as soft as I was expecting, but these are now my families favorite muffins!! They hold up well and are great the next day.

Absolutely loved these.  Only change I made was to add 1 tsp vanilla extract. I will definitely make again.

Exactly what I was looking for! I used Pillsbury Gluten Free multi purpose flour blend, and freshly squeezed tangerine juice (what I had available), but other than that, no changes. Seriously, these are darned near perfect (I prefer this texture to the cake type of muffin too)! I look forward to trying different fruits and nuts, too. Thank you for sharing this with us!

We love these. I didn't read correctly the first time I read and have continued to do it wrong because it's wonderful. We skip the topping and just mix the oats and cinnamon in the batter. I don't often have juice in the house, so I tend to use milk or buttermilk. I actually have a batch in the oven now with orange, peach, mango juice, so I'll see how that is! The kids love it (and my 18 month old just got to help dump flour the first time so she loves it more than ever). This is my go-to muffin recipe.

I made these for the first time today and they were excellent.  I used frozen blueberries and added a Motts original applesauce cup ( 4oz) and a tsp of vanilla.  They really don't need the sugar on top, so next time I will just sprinkle some cinnamon on top.

Wow! Best muffins ever :)
I took the advise of Bode'sGirl and only added half the amount of baking powder for better results.
Enjoy!

7 29 15 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/33155/blueberry-oat-muffins/ ... I followed the recipe! I followed the recipe!  (Okay, using frozen berries, but description says it's okay!  :D)  Good muffin!  The cinnamon is almost undetectable, but gives a nice appearance.  'Couldn't tell about the oj either.  That's fine.  It's a little more dense that most muffins, but that's not bad, just a difference I noticed.  Ohhhh, I upped the berries by a quarter cup.  'Surprised they were done in twenty minutes.  Sum up:  Not all that different than usual blueberry muffins, but definitely worth making.  One more thing, using Rumford baking powder (without aluminum) doesn't leave a bad taste.  Go for aluminum-free.

Very good. I did change a few things after reading the reviews: added 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp baking powder and I also substituted 1/4 cup flour for flaxmeal. I used frozen blueberries, turned out great.

Admittedly, I made some changes--white whole wheat flour, honey in place of the sugar, and coconut oil in place of vegetable.  However, we usually make those modifications and although the www flour makes things a little denser, the honey is just as sweet as sugar and coconut oil makes things more moist anyway.  These were just okay for us.  Kind of bland and a little weird (the oats gave them a very thick, hearty texture).  Might be a good recipe if you are wanting something different, but we'll probably try a different recipe next time.

Yummy, dense, and moist!  Substituted oil for applesauce and added 3 tbs flax meal, also did both raspberry & blueberries.  Then made a streusel topping from a blueberry crumb muffin recipe on this site.  Very good!

These are my new favorite blueberry muffins. I used to make the "To Die For..." ones, but these are easier and just as tasty.  I have made two modifications: (1) I use 1 cup of white whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup of oat bran instead of the full 1.5 cups of white flour.  (2) I add a 1/4 cup of flax seed.  Otherwise, I follow the recipe.  The mix doesn't rise much so don't be afraid to fill the muffin cups almost all the way to the brim.  Great recipe!  Thanks!  I am thinking about adding some orange zest the next time in order to punch of the orange flavor a bit.  They don't need it, but it might be tasty.

I just made these muffins and they turned out delicious. Much better than the: To Die For Blueberry Muffins. I did not taste any extra baking powder or "quemical" taste in mine. And yes, the texture is not like your usual muffin. Everyone liked them. I made 6 exactly like the recipe and 6 without the topping-both where good.

I was looking for a good muffin recipe that used oats and this was it! Although being apple season, I used apples instead of blueberries and apple cider in place of the orange juice. I also added some honey, vanilla and spices - cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice, and they came out wonderfully! Thanks to the advice of other reviewers, I did add probably an extra quarter cup of cider and between that and the extra moisture from the apples, these muffins came out moist and delicious!! This recipe is a keeper!

The only change I made was using apple sauce instead of oil.  These were very good, not too sweet or cupcake-like.  Very easy and quick to make.  I will add another 1/2 cup of blueberries next time though.

I thought these muffins were delicious.  Not too sweet, just perfect.  The only change was I added an egg and about 1/3 cup of vanilla almond milk just for some moisture.  I also added cinnamon to the dry ingredients.  The muffins rose beautifully and were ready in exactly 18 minutes,  As for the oats, i couldn't really tell they were in the muffin.  I will definitely make them again! Probably a double batch and freeze some!

Very delicious after adding additional liquid for moisture. I added about a 1/4 cup of milk and they were perfect for my taste.  It should be lumpy but definitely moist and sticky. Unless you do want a scone, which is what this recipe will make without the liquid.

I just tried this recipe this morning to make for my boyfriend and some work colleagues. Needless to say, they very much enjoyed them. 
The citrus taste is very light, so if you want a more intense taste, I'd suggest adding some zest too. Most of the sweetness is in the topping and blueberries, also, so a sugar addition may be needed. Next time I make them, I might add more oats too. They were there, but I'm not sure if they were as prominent as I wanted.
I was a little concerned because I accidentally used the wrong amount of baking powder and had to attempt to scoop some out of the bowl, but they were anything but ruined. I added some more orange juice to the batter before adding the blueberries to make the batter thinner -- it is extremely thick. I doubled the recipe, so I'm not sure if that had something to do with it.
Otherwise, these are very tasty muffins.

After mixing everything except the blueberries, the mix was very stiff and dry. I'm new at this so was a little perplexed and panicky. I added a little more OJ, then the bberries. The muffins turned out OK - tasty , but I only got 11 and most are small-ish, not "large' as some reviews say. Any suggestions would be welcome!

I followed the recipe exactly the first time......and the resulting muffins were too oily and not sweet enough for my taste.  Next time I doubled the Amount of blueberries, and cut the oil down to 1/4 cup, and added a couple tbsp of applesauce to compensate.   Result:  moist muffins with flavor, not oily taste!

Good base recipe. After looking at other suggestions, I replaced the oil with applesauce, used whole wheat flour, added 1/2 cup Stevia in the Raw. Substituted 3/4 tsp baking powder, added in 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp nutmeg and a sprinkle of cloves into the batter. Also added 1/3-1/2 cup of cranberries in addition to the blueberries. Very moist and satisfying. Works out to 3 points per muffin on WW point system.

I usually experiment with lots of different recipes, but I keep coming back to this one! I've used blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries, and they're all delicious. The orange juice adds a nice subtle flavor. The oats seem to melt into the muffin, so they're not obvious but add a good texture without Being drybat all. This is definitely my go to muffin recipe!

LOVE THESE!  Love the chewy oats and OJ!  I reduced the baking powder to 3/4 teaspoon, and added 1/2 cup walnuts.  Yum!!

I had to add a little extra egg white to get a batter, it was pretty dry initially. Or you could use an extra large egg, rather than the large I had handy. The muffins turned out really well, solid and filling. I made a dozen with blueberries and another dozen with raspberries, I expect any fresh berry would work just as well.

Tasty and quick-to-make muffins!  I took the advice of other posters and used unsweetened applesauce in place of oil.  I also used half white and half whole wheat flours and regular old-fashioned oats to make a healthier muffin.  These will be great to throw in the freezer and defrost as needed for a quick breakfast.  Thank you for the original recipe :)

So...I made this exactly as the recipe calls for, the only thing I changed was adding brown sugar to the cinnoman sugar mix sprinkled on top...the batter wasnt even batter like, still crumbly but I cooked it anyway..they turned out crumbly and not exactly muffin like.....they taste great though, i wish they didn't fall apart so easily is all.

Out standing!  These muffins are the best.  I followed the recipe except for the topping - did not matter because they had great flavor.  I also only had frozen blueberries - about 3/4 c.  Thanks for a great, easy, tasty recipe!

I substituted 1/2 c. wheat flour for 1/2 c. of the white. I also added 1 tsp. vanilla, like another review had mentioned. These were yummy. I forgot to add the sugar and cinnamon on top, they probably would have been even better with it! 
If you are on weight watchers, these are 4 points.

Fantastic, but I made a few changes:
Used steel cut oats; 
1 tablespoon honey; 
reduced baking powder to 3/4 tsp;
1/4 cup buttermilk;
reduced salt to 1/4 teaspoon. Left remaining ingredients the same.  Husband ate 4 immediately. The addition of buttermilk made a lighter cupcake.  Blueberries were frozen.

1. The batter was a little stiff so I added a bit more water until it was a better consistency. I used 1/4 t each baking powder and soda because other reviewers said there was too much powder. I also added a splash of vanilla. They cooked perfectly and were delicious.
2. I used milk instead of OJ, 3/4 cup each white and whole wheat flour, 1/2 t each powder and soda. Muffin perfection!

We love these muffins. Absolutely fantastic!! Family was fighting over the blueberry muffins at brunch!! Will definitely make this my go to muffin.  I did not use the topping, just the muffin.  Was so moist and delicious!! I did use apple sauce instead of oil.

Wonderful muffin!  Just loved it!!  A few tweaks, to make it a little healthier.... I used 1/2 c. flour, 1/2 c. whole wheat flour, and 1/2 c. wheat germ to get the 1 1/2 cups needed for the flour.  I also used 1/4 c. applesauce and 1/4 c. oil.  I was out of eggs, so I used 1 T of ground flaxseed mixed with 3 T water (let it sit for a couple minutes before adding). Like other reviewers, I also added 1 tsp vanilla.  Thank you so much for sharing!!

I made these yesterday and they are a 5***** recipe.  I used a bit less sugar , but they still tasted like a cup cake and not a muffin.  I loved them.  Thanks, they will be a favorite recipe to me. Helen

I rated it 5 stars b/c I didn't want to lower the rating based on adjustments I made. I used slpenda instead of sugar and applesauce instead of oil (as other reviewers did) and they were not good at all. Which is confusing to me b/c others seemed to like them w/ those adustments. I ended up making a vanilla glaze and covering them in it just to make them edible.  Which of course defeated the whole purpose of using applesauce and splenda. :) My mistake! I will know better next time I guess.

Fantastic!  I changed whole wheat flour for all-purpose, applesauce for oil, added a like bit more oats and left off the topping and they still came out fantastic.  I'm not sure if it was just me but mine actually came out very very sweet, overly so for my tastes.  I'll definitely be making these again, but I would use a little less sugar next time.

Very good, very easy.  I didn't notice oatmeal in the finished product.  I did sub. 1/2 brown sugar for white sugar, 1/2 cup whole wheat flour for the white flour, and half oil / half unsweetened applesauce.  I will make these on a regular basis!  4 and 2 year olds enjoyed these as well.

This is the best blueberry recipe, I make it at least once a week and everyone in my family loves it.  I of course make it mine by changing a few things. First I dont make the crumb topping, I didnt really like it the first time I made it, I just add the cinnemon to the mix.  I also always add vannilla to everything, and I have started adding chopped zuchinni in my attempt to add more veggi's to our diet.  These muffins are so good the zuchinni is even good in them, the men in my family even like it and they are not veggi fans.

I made these twice in 2 days. They are great! I used some whole wheat flour (1/2 cup) in place of 1/2 cup of white flour and had to use a little more orange juice because of it. Grease the muffin tin well, and I only cooked them for 15 mins. Make sure you don't overcook them...mmm...mmmm...mmmmm

very good.  will definitely make again.  I used 1/4 cup oil and 1/4 unsweetened applesause thanks to a comment from another reviewer.  I also use white whole wheat flour (King Arthur) in place of the other all-purpose.

These muffins were best right out of the oven! I added a little more blueberries than what the recipe called for because I love blueberries! Good recipe.

This is the best! I love this recipe.I did add 1 teaspoon of orange extract to the oat mixture just because I had it. 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract to the batter. They stay moist and freeze very well. I did use a different crumb topping though so I can't comment on that.But thank you for sharing. This is a keeper for me.

This muffin batter is so versitile - you can add any cut up fruit. I actually did not have blueberries so i substituted strawberries. (peaches will work as well.) They came out soft and light - considering they have oats in them! I made a struesel-oat topping - made from flour, oats, brown sugar, cinnamon and margerine - delicious and it added a really nice crunch to the top! I will be making this again...

Thank you for the recipe, these were awesome. I used the scale adjuster here at allrecipes and changed it down to 6 servings so it would fit in my toaster oven and it worked out perfectly. I substituted the topping, I used the topping recipe from Heather Walker's "Streusel Topped Blueberry Muffins" here at allrecipes.com. 
My daughter and I are now completely addicted. Will make again and again.

These were simply wonderful, a nice alternative to the fat trap muffins at the coffee shop. I did make giant muffins out of them so they required a little more cooking time, but they were fabulous. I really enjoyed the hint of citrus from the orange juice and the nuttiness of the oats.

These tasted great!  They were a little crumbly, but very good.  Thanks for the recipe.

The very best muffin recipe I have ever eaten.  Very moist and quick to make.  I've added cranberries, peaches and other fruits as well as different nuts.

I thought this recipe was good.  They aren't the best blueberry muffins ever, but I like that they have the oats- healthier than only using white flour. I would definitely make them again. Thank you, Ricki!

These muffins are a staple in our house.  My husband and two of my three kids love them.  They also freeze well.

Good, dense muffins.  Very easy to make.  Has more of a biscuit texture.
