Yes. Modified by adding silvered almonds, & using Stevie instead of honey  to keep sugars lower. Wonderful

delicious and fresh and perfect for a hot summer day. Maybe some pecans added would add a little more texture and flavor... Will definitely make again.

My whole family likes this salad.  It is sweet, crunchy and, for the most part, guilt-free!
