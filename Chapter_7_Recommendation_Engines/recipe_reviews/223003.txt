I think it's a shame to make this using a taco seasoning mix (hence the 3 rating) and make my own blend of spices to add more than a salty flavor.  Also, I shred the beef right in the crock pot, or even in a 9X13 pan, to make prep a lot less messy. You can't beat a crock pot dinner!

Loved this. I used only about half of the seasoning and added a little bit of water.

Most tender roast ever!  This is really a good alternative to the same old ground beef taco!

Ultimately this turned out great, but not without some help.  Rather than the packages of taco seasoning and the salt, I used Penzey’s Taco Seasoning, in an amount they recommended for each pound of meat – which actually was more than the two ounces instructed in the recipe.  After the recommended cooking time the meat was tender (of course) and it was good too.   But it tasted pretty much like plain roast beef!  What happened to the taco seasoning flavor?  This would never do, so out of desperation I shredded the meat and put it back in the Crock Pot with a package of taco seasoning.  I found I had to add a little water after that, but so what – now the meat tasted like it was meant for tacos.  All and all, surprisingly satisfying and delicious for so little effort and so few ingredients.

We really enjoy this.  I do a large roast, pull it out to shred and add some cornstarch to the liquids on the bottom.  I return my shredded roast to the pot and toss to coat.  This makes great freezer meals--just divide, bag and freeze!  Defrost and reheat in a skillet with some oil, onion, tomato and bell pepper for an easy machaca beef.  No additional seasoned salt is necessary at the end--there's enough salt from the taco seasoning.

I made this today (accidentally with bone in chuck) and it was easy and amazing! I think you will find more flavor with bone-in, and with good quality meat. My husband and I loved it, and the beef came apart like butter. Great for tacos, burritos, loaded nachos, beef sandwiches or taco salad!

What a gem of a recipe.  

I'm up at a cabin, where we got snow in late September - seriously - and wanted to make something simple, hearty, with few ingredients and that would be tasty, of course!  This hit the spot.  It made great burritos, which we really loved.  This recipe will now be in our meal rotation.  I followed the recipe exactly as written, with the exception of the seasoning salt, which I forgot to add at the end.  Of course, creative cooks can doctor up or make with their own seasoning mix, but this recipe is a winner, just as is.

I've made this over and over again and my entire family of picky eaters love it! We use corn tortillas, diced tomato, cilantro, feta, and homemade creamy garlic sauce to top our tacos. Such an easy recipe with little fuss and that just what a family of 6 is looking for! Thanks for a great recipe!
