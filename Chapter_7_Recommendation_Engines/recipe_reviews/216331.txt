After reading about all of these Navy inspired dishes, I was ready for a soldiers kiss! : ) These were so simple and so good! I did half the recipe to try them out. I had to beat the egg white about 3-4 minutes during each time to get to the correct consistency. I used pre-chopped walnuts from the bag and a 1 Tablespoon cookie scoop to make level even-sized cookies, so they dried at the same time in the oven. I got 15 with half the recipe. When done, they will be slightly cracked on top.  Mine took exactly the 40 minutes. Wait until slightly cool and slide a thin spatula under them to avoid any breaking. These were like little merengue cookies, but improved with the brown sugar. They were eaten up quite quickly.

So easy and tasty! I've never made a meringue cookie, but saw this, had the ingredients on hand, and just had to make it! The outside was crisp and chewy, the inside light and airy. I put them in for 35 minutes to begin with, the tops were dry, but the insides were still wet. I put them back in for the remaining 5 minutes, and they turned out perfect! These will definitely be made again- and soon!

OMG! These cookies were to DIE for! Maybe it's the fact that I'm 4 1/2 months pregnant with twins, who knows, but my son LOVES them too! We only made them a couple hours ago and well... they're just about gone! Delicious recipe, thank you!

This is a fantastic recipe! I added a few things... I have been defeated by meringue before, but this time I won the jackpot! I added in 1/8 tsp each of salt and cream of tartar to the eggs before beating. And a tsp of vanilla extract with the nuts. I substituted the nuts for 1/2 cup choc chips and 1 1/2 cups pecans because that's what I had on hand and what sounded good:) I used the whisk attachment on my hand-mixer and I think that works better than beaters. I used a glass bowl because I didn't have metal and let it chill in the freezer for about 10min( a tip I got from tv) and let my eggs warm up on the counter for about 40min. My cookies were done in 40mins perfectly! Thank you, will make again and again! Try it these are fantastic!

It took a loooong time to make meringue cookies, but it's all worth the wait. These cookies are delicious! Just one note, after 40-45 minutes baking, turn the heat off and let the cookies inside the oven for another 30-60 minutes. Let it dry out. You can even leave it in the oven overnight and take it out ar serve it the next day.

Yum! So good. I made a half batch and beat my egg white for 3 minutes. Although I searched for a walnut cookie and came across this recipe, I realized I'd end up using all of my walnuts, so I used my slap/chop tool on some almonds and used those. They came out terrific. Thanks for the recipe!

Slightly crunchy, lightly sweet-these are great cookies.  I used pecans instead of walnuts, adding just a tiny drop of maple extract to compliment the brown sugar.  I had planned to use a cookie press, but the ground nuts didn't  fit through the tip, so I used a rounded teaspoon as directed.

These were delicious...and so easy to make if you have a good mixer to beat the egg whites.  I only used 1 cup chopped nuts and needed two cookie sheets to cook them all at the same time.  Some were chewy than others, but they all came out perfect.  Left them in the oven for about 10 minute after cooking with the oven off (electric oven).  Will definitely make them again.

Very interesting consistency. I love the flavor. Mine did stick a little, so be extra careful picking them or. Very fragile. Thanks for sharing!

Thank you P.D Miles, I can not believe I have finally found my Grandmother's meringue recipe.  I have been adding walnuts to the plain white sugar recipe for years, just not as good.  I never knew she used brown sugar. She called them kisses, love that they are soldiers kisses.  Thanks again!!!

Too, too, too easy!

I was concerned there were too few egg whites for all that sugar and nuts, but I was wrong.  They turned out perfect.

Second batch, I substituted chocolate for nuts.   I crushed some dark chocolate bark to small crumbs and used just 1.5 cups.  I also stirred 1T cocoa powder into 1C white sugar instead of using brown sugar. This turned out great, but was a little intense.  I may use milk chocolate next time.

Parchment paper makes this such a breeze.  When the pan comes out of the oven you can slide the paper onto cooling racks.  Within a minute you can pull the cookies off the paper, and into storage (if they last that long).

Very light cookies, I didn't use quite as much sugar as the recipe called for but they were delicious. I had to leave them in the oven to dry out a little longer, really about three hours, I have a breadproof setting on my oven that's 100 degrees and it worked great. I took them to work and shared, they were a big hit!

Made this with regular granulated sugar and 1 cup of mashed pecans. Turned off the oven at 40 minutes then left them in for another 10. Perfectly crunchy outside and chewy inside.
