I've made this several times, the first time following the directions exactly, but the bacon was undercooked and left the chicken very greasy.  The next time I pre-cooked the bacon in the microwave about half way first, but again, the chicken was a bit greasy and the bacon wasn't doing anything to compliment the chicken.  Now instead of bacon I wrap the chicken in prescutto and it's perfect!  The flavors mix very well with the feta and spinach stuffing.  It's now the first thing I cook for a guy when I want to impress him, and it works like a charm!

Very nutricious and delicious entree.   Several reviewers said they found the chicken bland and dried out after the specified cooking time.  After I butterflied the chicken breasts, I seasoned them with garlic powder and onion powder. Then, because I don't like chicken that does not have a golden color on the outside, I sauteed in a nonstick pan sprayed with Pam (because I am fat conscious due to cholesterol) for about 45 seconds per side til I got the color I wanted. (The center was still quite rare.)  I made my stuffing by using only half of a 10 oz carton of frozen spinach. (Drain the spinach well on lots of paper towels.) Then I added 3 parts fat free sour cream to 1 part mayo.  Per a previous reviewer I added 1 tsp of egg substitute to bind the mixture.  I also sauteed sweet Vidalia onions and fresh minced garlic to add to the spinach mixture.  Instead of feta cheese, I added grated Parmesan/Romano cheese (about 1/4 cup). After stuffing the chicken, I precooked slices of turkey bacon (less fat) and topped them on the chicken pieces.  I covered my chicken with aluminum foil to bake in a 350 degree oven for about 30 minutes (depends on thickness of your butterflied breasts). It was quite moist and very flavorful (not bland or dry.) And because I cut back on fat at every opportunity, it was healthy for our lifestyle.  Hope this helps those who have the same dietary concerns.

Very good!  I made this over the weekend, adapting it a bit by making a mixture of lemon juice, olive oil, crushed garlic and oregano, and spooning it over the chicken breasts while they roasted (from another similar recipe here on Allrecipes.com).  The lemon and feta work really well together, and the oil helps "crisp" the top of the chicken and bacon wrapped around it.

Love it. Have made some changes that will stay. I roll up inside a slice of prosciutto with the spinach and cheese. No mayo. Skip the bacon. I use a skillet to brown on all sides then add 3/4 cup chicken broth and 2-3 tbsp lemon juice cover and let simmer. Skip the oven. Takes maybe 12 minutes remove chicken wraps and simmer a minute longer to thicken sauce, if needed, then spoon over wraps.

Thanks for the easy and tasty recipe! I did what some other suggested and some chopped onion, sun dried tomatos and toasted pine nuts to the spinach mix. I also heated the oven to 400 degrees and cooked them for 15 minutes covered, 20 minutes uncovered and broiled them the last 5 minutes. The chicken browned a bit more, the bacon came out pretty crispy and the chicken was juicy and perfectly cooked. 
This was a wonderful and easy chicken dinner that I will make again!

I too added a few of my own touches.  I skipped the bacon, brushing olive oil on top of the chicken instead.  Also, my family love mushrooms, so I chopped up mushroom, onion and threw in some bread crumbs into the stuffing, using egg as the binder instead of mayo....way yummy!

This recipe as is I would not have enjoyed however I took the basis and added my own ingredients.  I first used monteray jack instead of feta because I don't like it.  Then to the spinach mix I added chopped onion and mushroom as well as chopped bacon instead of wrapping the chicken in bacon. Once the chicken was cooked I topped it with a bernaise sauce.  It was very rich and flavorful.  Everyone loved it.

I made this following the exact cooking instructions - came out great! Tangy and healthy dish without any added salt.If you have extra spinach left you can add some cream and extra feta to make a glorious pasta sauce - better than pesto!

This is a great recipe but I did a few things different.  I used part feta and part blue cheese (or gorganzola) to add a little more flavor.  I used low fat sour cream instead of mayo and I also added a little minced garlic (I'm a garlic lover!). I baked it on a bronwie pan lined w/aluminum foil and set the chicken on a cooling rack on this pan, this way the drippings fell below and the bacon around the whole chicken got nice and crispy and the chicken didn't sit in the bacon drippings the whole time.  The aluminum makes clean-up a breeze... merely wash your cooling rack.

I was looking for something different to do with some b/s chicken breasts I had on hand and I'm so glad that I found this recipe! I took Linda W.'s advise and poured a mixture of the juice of half a lemon, some olive oil, minced garlic and dried oregano over the top of the wrapped stuffed chicken breasts but also added the finely grated zestof that lemon half (a Microplane rasp is excellent for this!) to the spinach-feta mixture along with some freshly ground black pepper and a pinch of kosher salt. I also used low-fat mayo to help bind the mixture. I uncovered the chicken after 45 minutes and there was quite a bit of lemony-garlicky juice in the pan, which I siphoned out with a bulb baster and added to the rice pilaf I was serving with it... that pilaf took on some wonderful Mediterranean flavors! I can not tell you how wonderful the smell was while this was in the oven and the taste will have me making this again!

I make this with low fat yogurt instead of mayo plus extra garlic, chopped onion and sundried tomatos added to the mixture. Instead of wrapping with bacon, I lay prociutto or pancetta on top of the chicken as it bakes. I've made this 3 times and my fiance loves it.   It's a surprisingly quick and tasty dish and goes great with steamed veggies. I'll be using this dish to impress company, too. ^_^

Out of this world…is the review my guests gave this recipe.  My husband and I fixed this for our son’s wedding and everyone loved it.  We stuffed 240 breasts and didn’t change a thing about it so I think we’re the reigning experts now.  Thank you so much Laurie for a great recipe.  I was worried that the chicken might be dry fixing so many but they made plenty of their own juice so there was no need to even have a sauce for them.  The presentation was really pretty too.  I crossed the bacon in an "X" over the breast and didn't need to use a toothpick because they were close together.  I would give it 10 stars if I could.

WOW!  Used sour cream vs the mayo, added a bit more minced garlic (2 tsp) than what would've been 2 cloves (about double) and used the whole 4oz pkg of feta cheese.  Wrapped each breast in 2 slices of thick cut bacon, baked at 400 for 45min then turned to broil for another 5 to crisp up the bacon and nobody could get enough of it.  Thanks for an absolutely FANTASTIC recipe that will now be a staple in our home!

Easy and elegant!  This dish was amazing.  My first try with stuffed chicken breasts, and it worked really well.  I don't love mayo, so I was reluctant, but the lowfat miracle whip I used worked well to make the chicken moist.  I pressed the garlic for increased garlic flavor, and I added about a teaspon of oregano to the spinach mixture.  I also mixed 2 tsp. olive oil, 2 tsp. lemon juice, and 1 tsp. oregano and brushed it on top of the chicken prior to baking, as some of the other reviewers suggested.  I baked it at 350, and it was definitely done in 45 min.  Excellent recipe, one I definitely intend to make again soon!

This recipe is soooo good!  It was one of the best meals my family and I have ever had.  I seared the bacon as I stuffed the breasts.  I then took the bacon out of the pan, drained it, and then pan seared the chicken on both sides for about one minute on both sides to get it a golden-brown color on the outside.  I also added bacon inside of the stuffed chicken.  Cooked it 20 minutes covered, and 20 minutes uncovered.  I also used feta cheese that was garlic and herb flavored and fat free mayo.  Will make this over and over in the future. Loved it!

This was excellent!  After one taste, my husband immediately said, "This is the dish we make for our next dinner party!"  Which is a pretty big compliment because he really dislikes feta cheese.  I used extra smoky bacon, which added tremendous flavor.  Try this recipe!   Its so easy, but looks and tastes very sophisticated.

Moist and juicy chicken. Made a lemon juice, olive oil and basil marinade and poured on just before baking. Also added basil and parmesan to the feta cheese mixture.  Will make again.  Thanks

This is a very light and tasty dinner, but a bit time consuming. Be sure to make extra to plan for another meal.  Very versatile..definitely goes with a meal sz salad or even with potatoes or pasta.

Cooked the bacon in micro for 3 min. i subsituted the mayo for plain yogurt. Sauted spinach, onions, garlic and mushroom in evoo with w/ a splash of white wine and lemon juice right at the end. Add some sea salt and pepper to taste and cool.  Added feta cheese and yogurt to spinach misture and stuffed and rolled chicken breasts  Seared the outside of the rolled chicken breast then covered in foil and baked at 350 for 30 min and broiled for the last 10 min. Sliced chicken and topped it on a bed of romaine lettuce.

I have made this several times.  Everyone loves it, the only change I made was to use fresh baby spinach and prosciutto.  I figured it would be less fatty than bacon.  All little time consuming in prep but definately worth it.  I have also made a white wine sauce or jus with chicken broth, garlic, any extra prosciutto chopped fine and some white wine.  Just cook on stove top and pour over the dish about 10-15 mins before its finished..phenominal.  I highly recommend this recipe.

WAY TOO LONG on cooking time, which will totally dry out your chicken and the idea of stuffing and cooking a chicken breast without seasoning/searing it first is insane.  Try sauteing some red onion and crushed red pepper in a little olive oil then wilting fresh spinach in the same pan.  Drain the spinach/onion then mix with feta, mayo, and garlic while still warm.  Butterfly and SEASON the chicken, inside and out, stuff, wrap with bacon, pin with toothpick, then sear on both sides in a heavy bottom skillet that you can then transfer to the oven to finish.  Much quicker, MUCH tastier.

Great recipe that has been used for entertaining and inspired my mum's partner to make his own version! We find it difficult to get the bacon to crisp up underneath but figure there is not much hope for that! As long as the dish is uncovered for the last 30 minutes so it crisps on top it is gorgeous :)

Lovely with green veg and mashed potatoes :D

Delicious! It was sleeting today so I used what I had on hand, fresh spinach, fresh mushrooms, mozzarella, cream cheese and hormel real bacon bits. I still used the mayo and we love garlic! I realize I didn't follow the recipe exactly but that's what I love about allrecipes, I still figured out how to make a delicous meal with everyone's help. I didn't have the bacon strips for the outside so I sprinkled Italian Bread crumbs on top & put a few pats of butter. Thanks so much for sharing!

Made this for dinner the other, and while I made it the same, I followed the directions a little differently.  First of all, I partially cooked the bacon in a pan, because I have used raw bacon in recipes like this and it never crisps up, so I cooked it until ALMOST done, then drained on a paper towel.  In the same pan I added the garlic and sauteed that for a few moments and then added several hand fulls of fresh spinach. I mixed light mayo with the feta and mixed well and once the spinach had wilted down, I added that to the mayo mixture, and stuffed the chicken.  Wrapped bacon and secured and cooked for about 30 or so min. (I pounded the chicken down to thin it out quite a bit).

This was very tastey and my family enjoyed it.  I had extra stuffing left over and put it in a small dish, mixed with mozerrella and parmesan and topped with more mozerrella and baked...instant spinach dip!

This was delicious. My kids will not eat spinach, but they ate this. I will definitely make this again. I followed a few changes from the reviews and it was perfect. 1. Mixed 3 part low-fat sour cream and one part low-fat mayonnaise. 2. Baked at 350 for 30 minutes coverd. 3.  Broiled 8 min on low uncovered. Perfect not dried out, yummm

-- I've made this several times, the first time following the directions exactly, but the bacon was undercooked and left the chicken very greasy. The next time I pre-cooked the bacon in the microwave about half way first, but again, the chicken was a bit greasy and the bacon wasn't doing anything to compliment the chicken. Now instead of bacon I wrap the chicken in prescutto and it's perfect! The flavors mix very well with the feta and spinach stuffing. It's now the first thing I cook for a guy when I want to impress him, and it works like a charm! 
 OR --I too added a few of my own touches. I skipped the bacon, brushing olive oil on top of the chicken instead. Also, my family love mushrooms, so I chopped up mushroom, onion and threw in some bread crumbs into the stuffing, using egg as the binder instead of mayo....way yummy!
 OR --This is excellent. I took a previous reviewer's advice and made a sauce out of lemon juice,olive oil,fresh crushed garlic and oregano and drizzled over the chicken. My kids and Hubby love this !!! 
 OR --A few minor improvements and this recipe would be 5 stars. After following the baking instructions the bacon was still soft so I drizzled olive oil over the bacon and chicken and put it back in the oven, but at 425. After 10 minutes the bacon was nice and crispy. Also, I ran out of mayo so I added ranch dressing to the spinach mixture and that was great. 
 OR --This was a tasty and quick recipe. I loved it. Couple of changes: used chicken cutlet an

Great on the grill too. Not sure why anyone would rate this 4 stars then state they have not tried it yet. Rate based from taste.. not what you think it will taste like or how it tasted after you completely changed the recipe.I thought this recipe was very simple and good.

Looks & tastes very good. Easy to make. I cooked in my oven with convection/bake option, NOT COVERED, it got nicely browned outside (bacon was just perfect, chicken was nicely roasted), inside the chicken was very tender and moist, just PERFECT. If covered the bacon will get soggy and chicken will be pale. I put 2 bacon strips on each stuffed breast but now I know only one could be enough, you can just wrap the bacon in a spiral, this way the whole stuffed chicken will get wrapped with bacon. Some of my guests were concerned with eating bacon, they watch cholestrol, calories.  They took the bacons off. They said the grease of the bacon went into the chicken stuffing while cooking. Actually the bacon grease was all over the baking pan. Next time I will try harder for the stuffing to be completely rolled inside the chicken and the chicken overlaps itself, this way the bacon grease will not get into the stuffing as much while cooking. But really, the bacon gives the chicken a nice smokey flavor and it makes it look very presentable and elegant. I will definetely wrap it with bacon again. I had a lot of stuffing left over, next time I will cut the stuffing ingredients to half the amount.Despite comments from some of my guests about the bacon grease, it was still UNBELIEVABLE! I will even try to drain the bacon grease from the cooking pan half way thru cooking. This could be served for a very elegant occasion, party, holiday. Leftovers tasted delicious even the next day.

This was a very good recipe! I did change it around a little. I marinated the chicken breasts overnight night in 1/2 cup olive oil, 1/2 cup of lemon juice and two cloves of galic (crushed) salt & pepper. Then for the filling I added chopped Roma tomatoes and I forgot to add the mayonnaise!!!! Instead of baking in the oven, I actually cooked them on the BBQ and they turned out great! Super tastey, they were a big hit with our guests!! Thank you so much for the recipe, next time I will remember to put in the mayonnaise, although they were still fab without it! :)

This recipe is definitely a keeper! I also substituted the cream cheese for the mayo, and used basil and sun dried tomato feta cheese. My husband, who is not a big chicken fan, raved about the recipe over and over--and that is saying something!!

Exceptional!  I have made these twice now and will be making them again this week.  I did do the following:  partially cook the bacon in the microwave; covered with foil for the first half hour, removed foil, flipped the chicken and finished baking without the foil; after squeezing the liquid from the spinach, I pressed in a paper towel; used 1/4 C mayo and 1/4 C sour cream.

Loved this, but with some changes as noted by other writers.
I used fresh spinach, and sauteed it with the chopped garlic.  Didn't bother with onion, but I'm sure that would be good.  I lightly browned the breasts using cooking spray in the pan prior to cooking the spinach.
I combined half the mayo with low-fat sour cream and the feta.  Be sure to cool the spinach prior to combining it with the cheese mixture if using fresh spinach.
I had a little mixure left over also, but I just put it in the baking pan and put the breasts over it which kept everything  very moist.  I did not use bacon strips, but sprinkled some REAL BACON bits over the breasts which gave the taste but not the fat!
Covered it and cooked for 30 min. at 350, then uncovered it for about 5 min. at 450 to reduce a bit of the moisture.
Delicious and beautiful in presentation!!
A real keeper!!

I added a small jar of roasted red peppers (chopped) to the spinach mixture for a bit more flavor and color.  Be sure to use plenty of Feta or mozzarella cheese to make the stuffing nice and gooey.  And pre-cooking the bacon will keep it from coming out a bit raw.  A very tasty meal!

First time making. Tweaked a little. Filleted breasts and pounded out so they were thin. Seasoned lightly with salt, pepper, onion powder and garlic powder. Flash seared one side on medium high heat for 30-45 seconds. For filling I used 1/4 cup cream cheese (heated) with 1/4 cup mayo. 1 Tbs dijon mustard. 1/4 cup each of grated and shredded parmesan. Added 2 tbs olive oil to pan I used to sear chicken, sautéed 4 cloves of garlic with 2 to 3 tbs of grated sweet onion, salt and pepper and fresh spinach. Then mixed cheese mixture and sautéed spinach. Laid out three pieces of bacon for each breast to help retain moisture. Place breast, seared side down on bacon, thinly layer cheese mixture and roll up.  Use toothpicks to secure each piece of bacon. Baked until 155 internal then turned on broiler to crisp bacon.

My kids - two of them HATE vegetables - (4yrs, 3yrs, and 17 mos.) LOVED it.    I did follow a few of the recommended changes:  1.  added garlic, onions, sun dried tomatoes and a few seasonings to the stuffing 2.  brushed a mixture of lemon, olive oil and basil onto the chicken during the roasting 3.  I roasted it for 20 min. covered, 30 min. uncovered and broiled it for the remaining 10 min. (5 min. each side or until the bacon is nice and crisp).  I served it with a Mediterranean Greek Salad (recipe on allrecipes) and long grain brown rice (couscous would be a delicious side too).    I am definitely going to add this to our regular routine.  It gets a big thumbs up from everyone in my family and it takes a special recipe to earn that!

I made this recipe twice. The first time, I followed the directions exactly and my family loved it. The second time I used bone-in chicken breasts with skin (that's all I had on hand). Like another reviewer, I mixed some chopped pre-cooked bacon into the stuffing, rather than wrapping the chicken. I stuffed the breasts by gently lifting the skin and stuffing beneath it. I thought I wouldn't get much under there, but I was able to use a huge mound of stuffing. I kept the cooking time and temperature the same. I did not cover the chicken. The recipe yielded browned, crispy skin over perfectly cooked chicken. It was even better than before!

The flavors in this recipe are great!  Like some others, though, I prefer the chicken browned and the bacon crispier.  So, I crumbled and cooked the bacon first, then browned the chicken.  I mixed the bacon with the spinich and some sour cream instead of mayo, and added a little cooked chopped onion to the stuffing.  Liked it even better that way.

I made this for my family and they really liked it. I did feel that the bacon made this a little more greasier than I would have liked. Perhaps it would be great to cook on a rack in the oven because what I found is that the chicken sits in the bacon grease.... But then again, maybe this grease helps make the the chicken juicier. I did make a few tweaks to this recipe.... I used fresh spinach since this is what I keep in my house. Also, I did not have any feta cheese so I used white sharp cheddar. I used minced garlic in place of the fresh garlic. I have learned in the past to season chicken the way I usually season my chicken because I love seasoned chicken. I used season salt and pepper for the chicken. I took the advice from another review and created a sauce from olive oil, oregano, garlic powder, and lemon juice. This was delicious and I am so glad that I did this. I poured this on each piece 10 minutes before I removed it from the oven. I will definitely make again. I gave this recipe 4 stars because I had to make some revisions based on my cooking style and love for more seasoned food. Happy cooking all!

This is one of my favorites to make. However, I made a few changes to mine. I do 7 oz. of fresh chopped spinach and 3/4 cup feta cheese. I feel they balance each other better that way. Also, I cook mine at 425 degrees F for 45 minutes covered and 20 minutes uncovered. It makes the bacon golden brown. If you roll the chicken a couple hours before you put it in the oven the chicken will come out a lot more tender. I roll mine the night before, stick them in the fridge until I pop them in the oven, and when they come out they're so tender that no knife is required. Now every time someone has a birthday they ask me to make them Stuffed Chicken. Super Good!!!

My boyfriend cooked this for me last night and it was very good! It was one of his first dishes EVER making because I'm training him ;) and he still managed to pull it off! However, I deducted a star because the chicken was a bit on the dry side. Next time I will reduce the cooking time.

Pretty good--I definitely tweaked it to make it a bit healthier though. I used greek yogurt instead of mayo and added red pepper flakes to give it a kick.  I also quartered some mushrooms, surrounded the chicken with them in a casserole dish, and added the remaining spinach mixture on top of the mushrooms.  Based on previous reviews, I also used proscuitto instead of bacon.

I couldn't believe that it came out looking okay, I'd been nervous about 'butterflying' chicken (it sounds fancy!).  Tasted pretty good too- I replaced the bacon with prosciutto and omitted the mayo (not a healthy recipe at all so I tried to ease the caloric blow...).

I quite enjoyed this recipe.   I would suggest that you do not over the chicken while it is cooking, turn the oven to 400C and only cook for 50 mins, brush with olive oil.  This way the chicken and bacon will brown and looks far more appitizing.   Thank you Laurie for the recipe.

My husband said this dish would be $40 in a restaurant! My spin on the recipe?... use fresh spinach and half sour cream and half mayo instead of all mayo. Use half to stuff chicken, and to the other half of the spinach mixture add fresh chopped tomato and red pepper. In last 15 minutes of cooking, put bed of cooked linguini in a casserole, top with other half of spinach mixture, place the chicken on top and drizzle with any drippings. Finally, top with shredded mozzarella and bake together for the last 15 - 20 minutes. Even my 4 and 5 year olds ate spinach like this!

I loved this-so did my kids!!! which is crazy becuz just mentioning spinach makes them dive for cover!!! But they really enjoyed this recipe. Only change I did make is that I butterflyed the chicken and filled with the mixture, then i dipped in egg and rolled in seasoned bread crumbs and baked. Made it more tasty and didn't have to worry about drying out. Very moist, I think it would be moist even w/out the bread crumbs. The filling seepes into the chicken as it is cooking. Maybe try covering for half the cooking time and I don't think it needs to cook that long. I always cook my chicken on 350 or lower. Keeps it tender.

My family loved this recipe. I didn't have any feta cheese so I used cheddar and it turned out great. My 4-year-old daughter loved it.

This is a great dish. I used cream cheese instead of mayo and used tomato basil feta. It turned out perfect when i poured lemon juice and olive oil over the top. I will definitely make it again.

Absolutely delicious! I changed the recipe a little by adding onions and red pepper flakes sauteed in butter and fresh spinach. I used muenster cheese instead of feta and used 1/2 mayo, 1/2 blue cheese dressing, the juice of 1/2 a lemon, salt and pepper. I did not cut a pocket in the chicken breasts. I pounded them, seasoned them with salt and pepper, filled them with the spinach mixture and folded them over like tacos, securing them with toothpicks. I then laid out the bacon strips, placed the chicken breast on top, wrapped the chicken breast with the bacon and placed an additional strip lengthwise. I baked them for 40 minutes then placed them in the broiler 3 minutes per side to crisp the bacon. We enjoyed these very much. Will make again and again.

Delicious and healthy.  Next time I will use 1/2 the spinach and add more cheese.  I used Parmesan/Romano cheeses in place of feta.  I also used a mixture of 1/2 lite mayo and lite sour cream.  We loved the flavor the bacon added (it was not greasy at all) and may use more bacon next time.  I browned the chicken in a skillet before I stuffed them, as I like the " finished look" of browned chicken.  (you can lower cooking time by 15 minutes this way, too.). I also brushed on a mixture of olive oil/oregano/garlic to chicken half way through cooking.  Very moist!

I'm not good at stuffing anything, but I decided to give this recipe a go.  I don't like cheese, so I omitted the feta, but for flavor I added horseradish and garlic to the mixture.  Also I fried up bacon and added bacon bits to the inside instead of the outside, and I used fresh spinach.  I have never had good luck wrapping anything in bacon; the bacon never seems to get done and it makes the meat underneath it greasy, so I just put it inside instead. I was really pleased with this.  Even if a recipe doesn't call for it, I think meat should always be seasoned, so I seasoned the outside with salt and pepper.

Even after some of the recommended tweaks -- prosciutto instead of bacon, sour cream instead of mayo -- I thought this was just OK. For my tastes, I think more of a savory spanakopita filling would work better -- adding chopped parsley, an egg, and some sauteed green and yellow onions. Also, an hour at 375 is waaay too long. Mine were done in 30 minutes. BTW, Chef John's trick of rolling these up in plastic wrap and twisting the ends works GREAT! (See Video: Prosciutto-Wrapped Stuffed Chicken Breasts).

awesome - i also wilted fresh spinach with EVOO and a little squeezy garlic (i'm lazy) for the stuffing mixture.  Doubled the bacon to wrap it up because it's bacon and bacon is awesome.  Next time I'll go with 4 strips of bacon per breast and maybe flatten the chx out a bit more to cram moor goodness inside.  Great recipe.  Thanks.

I made this last night - WOW it is really good! I did have to make a couple of changes to it. I did a mixture of Feta/Parmesan, cut down on the Mayo to a couple of teaspoons, added 3 cloves of garlic, and salt and pepper to taste. I also completely wrapped my chicken in bacon - around 2 1/2 pieces of bacon per chicken breast. I also basted with the drippings  every 10 minutes or so. The chicken turned out moist, not greasy, and the filling turned out perfect.

Absolutely loved this. Didn't change anything except only used two breasts and ate the rest of the spinach as a decadent side dish.  I would serve this to guests. Probably the best chicken dish I've ever made.

Super!  Easy to prepare, healthy, and delicious!  You can add just about anything you like to the mixture- mushrooms, tomatoes, chopped nuts, etc.  I made extra stuffing to stuff and completely cover the chicken with and I'm glad I did; it added more spinach and flavor to the dish.  If you don't wrap the chicken with bacon, be sure to cook it for less time (I cooked mine for 20 minutes on 400).

These are so delicous! My husband says they are "very gourmet" and tells me to make them whenever we have company over. The only thing I do differently is cook the bacon slighty before I wrap it around the chicken to prevent sogginess.

Delicious! But of course I modified it slightly to our tastes. Instead of wrapping in Bacon, I added chopped, cooked bacon into the stuffing, as well as diced mushrooms and used roasted garlic. Then I coated the breasts with the leftover liquid/juice from the stuffing bowl and covered the chicken with seasoned bread crumbs. Served with roasted asparagus and a nice bottle of chilled Pinot Gris. A HUGE hit with the family!

Fantastic recipe.  I changed a few things to my tastes - egg instead of mayo, goat cheese instead of feta (highly recommended!), and fresh spinach.  I had trouble with how messy the mixture was so next time I think I'll refrigerate it for an hour beforehand. I also seasoned and oiled the chicken. Halfway through baking, I poured out the bacon grease - this made the bacon crispy.  The chicken was just a tad dry so I'll probably turn down the heat a little bit next time.  Overall, extremely enjoyable recipe with lots of possibilities.  This is a definite new favorite.

These were so delish! I'm making them again. I made 12 stuffed breasts and wrapped them individually for freezing. They're perfect for my husband to take to work when frozen and he can heat them in the microwave on his lunch. My kids liked them better than most chicken dishes.

Awesome! I used chicken breast fillets instead of butterflying. I laid down a fillet, spooned some of the mixture on top and then laid a fillet on top of it. Also, I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers to put olive oil and seasonings on top. It was soooo good.

I prefer simply dipping the stuffed chicken in egg white and breading with Italian bread crumbs before baking. Adding crumbled bacon to the filling is fine, but it's no good on top. All of the prepping necessary to make the bacon look and taste appealing is not worth it. Simply cooking the bacon and adding it to the filling is much easier and more successful. Flavored feta is also a nice touch.

My husband made these for dinner and they came out DELICIOUS!!  He followed the recipe pretty much as it was written except he added some seasoned salt to the top of the chicken meat before he wrapped it with the bacon.    YUMMY!!We will definitely be making this again!

Very tasty, exactly what I was expecting from the recipe. A lot of people are complaining about the portion size of the stuffing; are they using the smallest chicken breasts they can find? I buy jumbo packs of chicken, and they have really good sized pieces of meat. One piece is more than some people can eat. So I pounded those babies out to maybe 3/8" and they were great for stuffing. The four pieces just about filled my 9x13 pan! The cheese was almost totally used. The one gripe I have has to do with cooking time. Now I know since I am using a pretty large cut of meat, and pounded it out a bit thicker, that the cooking time will be longer. But after 30 mins, these were totally RAW underneath of the sauce. I don't see how chicken even half the size could cook that fast covered in cold sauce and cheese. I turned the oven up to 375 and cooked for 30 more minutes and it came out perfect.

April 2008. I used shredded Parmesan instead of feta and turkey bacon because I had it. Also steamed fresh spinach with arugula from the garden. Forgot about the garlic, but used a heaping tablespoon of green olive and roasted pepper tapenade. I pounded out the chicken and rolled the stuffing inside, wrapped the outside with bacon. Cooked about 40 minutes uncovered. My daughter and I couldn't believe how good this was, she insists I have to do it for the next "friends cooking dinner" group at our house.

These were delicious!  I did however make a few alterations. I added more garlic b/c we love it. I only had provalone cheese so that's what I used and it was AWESOME!  I'm not a huge fan of feta so I will continue to make these without it.  I also seasoned the chicken breast slightly with garlic salt, lemon pepper, and seasonings salt.  Then I cooked covered for 30 and uncovered for 30 minutes. This is a keeper!

This recipe came out great!!!  I made it exactly as directed, but substituted in ff feta, low fat mayo, frozen cut leaf org spinach, and low sodium bacon.  I also increased the garlic to 2 tsp of jarred minced garlic.  I also followed another reviewer's advice and seasoned the chicken with garlic powder, salt and bl pepper.  Then I stuffed the breasts, and wrapped the bacon.  I took the cover off about 10 minutes before it was done, which added a little more color.  I also let the chicken rest for about 5 min with alum foil loosely covering.  The blend of flavors was a nice change.  I will def be making this again!

This was a tasty and quick recipe. I loved it. Couple of changes: used chicken cutlet and rolled them up after stuffing with spinach, used a little mayo and cream of chicken to taste in spinach mixture, added fresh mushrooms and chopped shallots to spinach mix. Browned chicken cutlets, couple of seconds on each side, then stuffed it. Wrapped bacon around and fastened with toothpick. I also spooned some garlic, olive oil, and fresh lemon over chicken before I popped it in the oven. Covered chicken with aluminum foil, cooked at 350 for 30 min. then uncovered and broiled for 5 min. I think the bacon drippings give this dish so much flavor. Loved it!

WOW, this was fantastic!  I did not use bacon since I am Muslim, but I did not feel like anything was missing.  I basted the chicken breasts with olive oil, lemon juice, thyme (did not have oregano on hand), and a little bit of salt.  I cooked it covered for about 30 minutes and then broiled each side for 5 minutes.  This is definitely something I will make again and again.

Tried this recipe for the first time. The family loved it.  I used fresh spinach and chopped it fine and then creamed it with miracle whip dressing and added the fetta cheese to that.  I flattened the chicken breasts rather than butterfly them.  I then put the spinach in the breast and rolled tightly and wrapped it with the Bacon. I drizzled olive oil and lemon pepper over it. I then baked  it in the oven for  25 mins at 300 degrees.  I then broiled it for another 5 mins to crisp up the the bacon.  My family raved about it.  The only thing I will change next time would be less miracle whip. Great way to get the spinach into the kids

I made this recipe last night. Delicious...  I made a few changes I added roasted almond slivers they gave the chicked a nice crunch. I also beat the chicken paper thin then stuffed it. The nice thing was the chicken cooked in thirty minutes and the bacon wrappend around the whole piece sealing in the filling. I baked it for 20 minutes and then turned on the broiler for 10 min to finish the bacon and make it crisp.

I've made these several times, they are SO good!

A few changes; added salt, pepper & a bit of onion powder to the filling. Also I marinated them overnite in a Roasted Red Pepper Italian Dressing, it added SO much flavor. 

Delish! Thanks for sharing this one, the whole fam loves it!  :)

Made this for a last minute dinner party for 8 and it came out great.  Not as much work as other stuffed chicken breasts recipes I have.  But tasted just as good if not better! Baked it for just 35 minutes and it came out moist, tender and cooked throughout.

Really good recipie, minor adjustment, use two pieces of bacon and creamed spinach...cook at 350 for about 35-45min, an hour is too long and the biggest thing i suggest is to cook it on a wire rack suspended above the pan, this will allow the bacon to become crispy, really makes a huge difference

I thought that this recipe really didn't have much flavor.  I would season the chicken breasts next time, and probably add another piece of bacon.  Also the cooking time was way too long, my chicken came out dry so next time I would check the chicken at around 40 minutes.

Loved the recipe and so did my husband.  I did make some small adjustments.  I substituted fat free Greek yogurt for the mayonnaise and substituted turkey bacon for the regular bacon.  I cooked it covered for 45 minutes at 400 degrees and then took the foil off and broiled it for the last 15 minutes which browned the chicken and crisped up the bacon.  Excellent!!!  :o)

Really liked it! Added minced garlic to the stuffing, cooked on a wire rack on an aluminum foil lined baking tray, and poured some olive oil with fresh squeezed lemon to crisp up the bacon and chicken. I had leftover filling that I baked in a cup with the chicken to add to the pieces when done. Delicious!

I used 2 slices of bacon per breast half since I always cook large chicken breasts. After butterflying the chicken I pounded it out slightly so as to make them large enough to take all of the spinach mixture since I used just 2 breast halves. I held them together with tooth picks. Instead of plain Feta I always use the herbed kind, it adds so much more flavor to anything, also I used cracked black pepper to taste.

I've replaced the Feta with; once with Mozzarella and once with Habanero.  Both came out great !  I've also started using a piece of spaghetti to secure instead of toothpicks ??. A trick I learned from Chef Michael Smith.

SOOOO YUMMY!! I made this for my hubby's birthday. As suggested by other reviewers, I marinated the chicken breast in buttermilk, half-cooked the bacon in pan and cooked the spinach and garlic on the same pan. I mixed mozarella, feta, salt, pepper, cayenne pepper and paprika (for that extra kick!) with the spinach-garlic mixture. The chicken was so moist and tasty. My husband loved it!

I skipped the mayo and added tomato and baby portabella to the spinach (used fresh baby spinach) and feta. I also seasoned the chicken with rosemary before wrapping it in bacon.

This was so good!!!!  I made some minor changes. I used cream cheese and 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese instead of Feta, I used an egg as a binder instead of mayo, I also used fresh spinach instead of frozen and lastly I seasoned the chicken with a little bit of pepper, garlic powder and onion power. I will definitely make this dish again.

Made it the first time as written and really enjoyed it but felt it needed something. Next time I pre-cooked the bacon a little then sauteed chopped onions in the bacon grease, adding them to the filling mix. I also substituted swiss cheese for the feta and added a bit of paprika, salt, pepper. WONDERFUL! I've made this several times now and my family is always excited when I say we're having it for dinner. It has a really nice presentation and would do well as a dinner for company, too. Simple - Good - Pretty. Doesn't get much better than that!

My girlfriend and I absolutely love this dish.  And I real don't care much for feta either.  I made this to use some extra spinach and have become addicted.  I do add another strip of bacon to each because you can never have enough bacon.  But it is excellent just the way it is.

I love the combo of feta and spinach so wrapping that in chicken and then bacon is a great idea.  However the bacon didn't cook correctly for me.  Next time I'll stuff my chicken and then coat them with eggwash and breadcrumbs and cook them that way.  Great recipe.

there isn't much else to be said for this recipe with such great reviews.  i did make a few changes, namesly dropping both the bacon and the mayo from the recipe for health purposes.  i thought the filling still tasted great with just the spinach and cheese.  great recipe! :)

This is a staple recipe for me and it never fails to please. You don't need to cook it a full hour unless your chicken breasts are very thick and large. It's wonderful with a wild rice pilaf.

This is now a favorite - my husband loves it!! I did use half mayo/half sour cream instead but I don't think it would matter either way! The second time we had this I cooked the bacon first and had some issue trying to get it to wrap around the chicken so next time I will definitely just cook the bacon till crispy and then cover the top of the chicken with the bacon! It just doesn't cook enough just wrapping and baking! Awesome taste - thanks for the recipe!!

I LOVE THIS! I used turkey bacon, substituted mayo with greek yogurt, used fresh spinach instead of frozen and added some shredded mozzarella cheese I had on hand.  Next time I may add some finely chopped jalapeno for a kick.

I thought this was pretty good but I think it would be lacking if I wouldn't have salted, peppered and used garlic and onion powder on the chicken. I added sun dried tomatoes and they gave a great sweetness with the tartness of the feta and spinach. I'll make this again but probably with sour cream.

I was a bit leary to try this recipe at first because so many people had made changes, but I decided to use it as an outline with "suggestions" and the end result was delicious!  I real keeper.  Here are the changes I made: added more feta, left out the bacon, subbed one egg for the mayo, added salt, and pepper.  Yummy!     (ps - I'm sure the bacon would be amazing, but this way is healthier and I didn't have bacon on hand anyway).

It was good except the edge of chicken got a little too dry and hard....  My husband and daughter weren't that crazy about this dish since they're not a big fan of spanich...

This was just wonderful and so easy to make.  The only change I made was that I used fresh spinach that I chopped.  I also drizzled some olive oil on top and then sprinkled some of Emeril's chicken spices on it.  It was absolutely delicious!  The chicken was perfect and not dried out at all.  I would have normally preferred to have the outside of the chicken golden brown, but it tasted so good that it didn't matter

I have made this recipe a number of times and actually got my mother in law making it now too!  I did make one change, instead of using frozen spinach I used fresh baby spinach, or cut up regular spinach.  Let me tell you it tastes sooo much better and not soo "spinachy" if you know what I mean.  There is a huge difference between the tastes because my mother in law used frozen spinach...not to say her's wasn't good, but fresh spinach is the way to go on this recipe!  It is also less watery.  To lighten up this recipe I also used light mayo and turkey bacon and this alternative is also very good!

Too much spinach and not enough feta.  the chicken was dry and the bacon was not crisp.  I will try this again but change the proportions to see if I can get it to work. Plus there were beautiful pan drippings which should be made into a thin sauce to perfect it.

Great recipe! I used prosciutto instead of bacon.  It was so tasty and spread better over chicken.  I also cooked them right on the stove instead of baking in the oven. My family loved it and so did I.

I substituted with faux chicken & bacon and used fresh spinach instead of frozen because it's all I had on hand. I also sauteed a little onion to add to the mixture. Delicious!! Will make this again.

Very tasty dish! I think I will try uncovering it toward the end of the baking cycle next time, to allow it to brown a bit, just for a nicer appearance. A definite keeper, thank you!

Made this for dinner last night, and it was absolutely delicious!  I seasoned the chicken with garlic power and S&P after stuffed and ready to go in the dish.  I was a little hesitant about the mayo in the filling, but was pleasantly surprised in the end.  This was awesome!

Delicious and so easy.  Okay, I can't leave a recipe alone.  I skipped the mayo, added cream cheese, then some grated yarlsburg, and a hint of parmesian.  Skipped the bacon and brushed with olive oil which browned beautifully.  Also added some leftover diced ham to stuffing.  Lots of liquid in pan, I drained occasionally, but don't toss it! It made a great sauce with some fresh thyme.  I loved this dish!  definitely will do again.

All I changed was substituting greek nonfat yogurt for mayo and adding a couple tablespoons of sun dried tomatoes and about 1/4 cup of seasoned bread crumbs for binding. Awesome taste and my son actually complimented me on this dish. I did cook uncovered in a deep dish stone bake ware for about 45 minutes and broil for 5  minutes to crisp bacon. very tasty and easy

This was the very first recipe I made from this website and now i'm so faithful to the wonderful cooks on this website!  This was a chicken dish that I have made SEVERAL times!  It's a simple way to make chicken interesting...and it really looks like you put a lot of work into this meal!  Great for dinner parties.  I will add, that I never made it with Bacon...I can't comment on whether it's better or not--I just never cared to add it--so if you're not a bacon lover, it's great without it too!!

This recipe was a winner for us. I cut the breasts open and put in a slice of prosciutto and added the spinach mixture on top of the prosciutto. I browned them on the stove and threw the breasts, chicken broth and lemon juice in my crockpot to cook on low while I did some errands. They cooked up nicely. When I returned, I made some rice and thickened the sauce to make a gravy. Everyone was impressed by this dish. We'll have it again.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe and so does my family!  I did what one of the other reviews said and made a side of lemon juice, olive oil, and oregano, to spooning over the chicken breasts while they roasted.  It is never to greasy, or to dry it's just perfect!

Oh my goodness this was so good.  I did change it up a bit.  I left out the bacon and browned the chicken first as suggested from any reviewer.  I added fresh shallots,garlic, mushrooms to the spinach mixture.  I also used sliced Asiago cheese.  I also cooked covered for 30 mins then uncovered and broiled for about 5 mins.  It was really easy to do as well.  I felt like a real chef.  Great recipe.

A few minor improvements and this recipe would be 5 stars.  After following the baking instructions the bacon was still soft so I drizzled olive oil over the bacon and chicken and put it back in the oven, but at 425.  After 10 minutes the bacon was nice and crispy.  Also, I ran out of mayo so I added ranch dressing to the spinach mixture and that was great.

This was the best, very flavorful and tender. I divided the mayo (using miracle whip and sour cream). I also added a bit or parm cheese. Since I like flavor, I seasoned the outside of my chicken with season salt, wrapped two slices of bacon and baked in the oven.  An hour was good since my chicken was thick. About 15 minutes before it was done, I broiled the chicken to get it brown and cook the bacon. This will be made again. Beautiful presentation, great to impress guest. Can't wait to have the leftovers for dinner tonight.

This was awesome!  Found it worked better to stuff by pounding the breasts to 1/2" thickness, rather than butterflying.  Flavor combination was wonderful. Thank you Laurie for posting.

this was awesome- i used 2 breasts instead of 4, but made the same amount of stuffing.... it was plenty for 2 people. i just kinda put the leftover stuffing in the dish around the chicken. i also used 2 pieces of bacon for each breast instead of 1 for more flavor. i recommend broiling for the last 2-3 minutes so the bacon will get a little crispy. i shared this recipe with several friends who've all raved about it! very tasty!!

Awesome recipe...even my 5 year old begs for it!  I use the "garlic and herb" feta, and completely wrap the chicken in bacon (about 2 slices each), then place them all in a baking dish and surround with mushrooms.  A little white wine over the top, bake as directed, and yum-o!  The mushrooms are to die for, and the chicken is delicious.  Thanks!

As a caterer I made this recipe for a corporate luncheon and it was a huge success.  I modified it slightly by adding a wonderful herbed boursin cheese and some asiago cheese.  I also put 1/4 cup mayo and 1/4 cup cream cheese and added a splash of heavy cream (hey I know...not low cal, but awesome).  Everyone loved it!

I recieved a marriage proposal over this recipe!! I'm rather new at this whole "cooking" thing but this recipe is resteraunt quality for dummies. I did follow a fellow reviewer's idea of basting with a lemon & oil mixture thru-out the cooking process. I also added an extra strip of bacon to my friends plate as he's a bacon-o-holic. Fantastically Tasty!!

An excellent recipe, I would never have thought that mayonaise would have worked but it did and it was beautiful! Everyone commented on how lovely it tasted and how excellent it looked. I used fresh spinach which I cooked before and cooled first with cold water, then squeezed out the water before putting it in the mixture. 
An amazing and spectacular way of using chicken breasts, I really recommend this recipe!

Stunning Recipe! Not only did this make an incredibly delicious dinner, but it was really fun to make. Even my little sister who never eats vegetables, gobbled up every piece of spinach. I would strongly recommend this recipe to anyone and everyone. I served the chicken with rice, which i fried with peas, sweetcorn and Butter.
Helpful Suggestions: Dont worry if you dont have any cocktail sticks, i just wrapped each chicken breast tightly in 2 slices of Bacon and they held their shape fantastically. I also recommend cooking the chicken under foil for 1 hour, and then uncovered for 15 mins. This allows the Bacon to get slightly golden and crispy, and gives the chicken enough time to get tender and succulent. If you follow this recipe, i promise you will not be disappointed! x

I used reduced fat mayo, reduced fat feta, and turkey bacon, and this one still gets five stars! It's the perfect amount of everything.

A++!  I followed the recipe almost exactly and my boyfriend, the pickiest eater in the world, loved it!  The only thing I changed was deciding to cook it uncovered for 20 min at the end in order to brown the chicken a little.  Next time I will wrap the chicken breasts with 2 pieces of bacon instead of just one because the salty flavor was a great compliment.  What a great recipe, thanks!

Very good - my changes were instead of mayo I added 4 ounces of artichoke hearts marinated in oil, and fresh spinach sauted with garlic and olive oil.  Then covered baked for 30 minutes, then uncovered for last 30 minutes.

added breadcrumbs (flavored) to the stuffing and it came out amazing, for that extra special kick, cook using pure convection and uncovered.....

My fiance and I LOVE this recipe.  As suggested by others, I used cream cheese instead of mayonnaise and drizzled an olive oil & lemon juice mixture over the chicken.  The touch of lemon gave it a really nice flavor.  I used bacon the first time I made it but honestly it didn't really need it.  Definitely a keeper!

This recipe was absolutely delicious!  I didn't have toothpicks or anything to hold the stuffed chicken closed, so I just put the chicken in a 13 x 9 pan, drizzled it with olive oil and lemon juice, then put the spinach stuffing on top.  It took less prep time and less cooking time, which made it more convenient for me!  Of course, it loses something in the presentation when prepared this way.  The only thing I might do next time is to double the amount of stuffing mixture because that's the best part.  (I ripped up the bacon and threw it into the stuffing mixture since I wasn't wrapping it around the stuffed chicken.)

OH MY GOODNESS!  This was great!  I only had chicken quarters, so I mixed this up and stuffed it under the skin.  It was delicious.  I love feta and spinanch together and this was a wonderful combo.  We have fresh spinach on hand often and I will be adding this to one our regulars.  Thanks...it was GREAT!!

Excellent - will serve at my next dinner party. Looks very impressive and only took a few minutes to prepare. I added about 2 tbl of minced onion and some garlic salt to the spinach mixture.

Great, even the most finicky of eaters seems to like this creation. Just be sure to get the chicken nice and thin for rolling. The first time I made it, the chicken was not tenderized and it came out too dry.

My husband LOVED this! He thought I spent hours in the kitchen (hee hee). This was very easy and looks elegant. Even my two toddlers liked it. I used miracle whip instead of mayonnaise and I used slightly more feta cheese...turned out wonderful!

Awesome recipe! I had fresh spinach so I just sautéed it with some garlic, salt, and pepper before mixing in the rest of the ingredients. Came out juicy and moist. Last five minutes I broiled the top.

Prep was easy; Insert into pre-heated oven and wait an hour and you have yourself a delicious meal. I wrapped 2 bacons around each as they were rather large breasts; The bacon baked into the chicken giving a delightful flavor to the expectant taste buds...I am not a cook; I am made fun of by many generations in my household. This shut them up! Follow this to the "t" and you will NOT be disappointed!

This chicken was delicious, I did make some changes though. I read some reviews and decided to take bits from some of them. I left out the bacon, the stuffing I used a goat cheese feta cause my hubby is allergic to cows. I added minced onions, oregano, salt, and pepper. I coated the baking dish with olive oil and placed them in then topped with more oregano. Baked them covered for 45 minutes and then uncovered for 10, the broiled for 5 to get some crispy brown colouring. Turned out amazing ha

It was good. I read some of the reviews prior to cooking and cooked the bacon a bit before baking...it still came out super uncooked...I threw it under the broiler for two minutes to crisp it up... There was a ton of liquid on the bottom of the pan and I'm not sure why...ultimately I would make it again!

Amazing!  I substituted the mayo for 1 single serving of plain greek yogurt to cut calories.  In addition, I used advise from 2 others ~ wrapped in procuitto, and cooked on crinkled tin foil to prevent the chicken cooking in grease.  Was FABULOUS!  I will be making this for my boyfriend next weekend, and know it will be a hit! Plan on serving with fresh asparagus, and rice pilaf.  Thank you for such a great recipe!!

My husband and I enjoyed it. I made a few changes.  I wrapped the chicken with two pieces of bacon and sprinkled a pinch of basil, oregano, pepper and paprika. I baked "uncovered" at 400 degrees for about 40 minutes. The bacon was nice and crisped. Nice flavor.  Will make again!

Very good stuffing but the chicken came out rather bland and the 1 hour cooking time seemed a little excessive. The next time I made it, I marinaded the chicken breasts in a simple EVOO, Lemon juice, oregano, and garlic marinade then cranked the oven up to 425 and let the chicken cook for about 25 minutes. It was perfect. This filling gives me many great ideas!

Very good recipe. To the spinach mixture I add some onion, mushrooms, and cream cheese. I used Monterey Jack cheese instead of feta (don't like feta) and left out the bacon.

Made these last night and followed the recipe as written except I did as some other reviewers and made a mixture of olive oil, lemon juice and oregano to baste chicken with. Turned out great. Not sure I would have liked it as much without the basting mixture, I think it may have been dry without.

Good recipe! Like most others, I made some changes to fit my tastes and health goals. 

I used a 10-oz box of spinach, 1/4 c crumbled feta, NO MAYO. I sauteed half an onion, finely chopped, in olive oil, added 2 cloves of garlic (minced), thawed & well-drained chopped spinach when onions were clear, a pinch of crushed red pepper, a dash or two of black pepper and approximately 1/2 tsp kosher salt. I cooked this for about two to three minutes on medium-high heat, then dumped it into a mixing bowl. I mixed in the feta with a wooden spoon until well blended in but not melted through. 

I cut a large pocket in two large boneless and skinless chicken breasts, and tightly packed in the spinach filling, sealing the opening with a toothpic. I sprinkled the breasts with salt, black pepper, thyme and then dusted them heavily with bread crumbs. I melted 2 tbs unsalted butter and added 2 tbs olive oil and poured that over the breasts, then dusted with about a tsp of grated parmesan. Baked in the oven at 425 for 35 minutes: golden brown, juicy, flavorful - totally delicious. This will be a recipe we use over and again. 

Thanks for the "menu idea" - it was quick and something new.

This was very good!  I followed the recipe, the only difference was I used bone-in/skin-on chicken breasts.  I also brushed an herb-infused olive oil over the chicken to make the skin crispy.  It took them about an hour to get done and they were delicious!  My bacon crisped up nicely, probably because I didn't cover it; I totally didn't see that step until I just now came back to review it.  We'll have this again!

What a fantastic and easy recipe.  My family loved this and I know I will make this often. It was so quick and simple to make, the only difference I made was to use pre-cooked bacon.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.

this was great but i did alter it first using melted low cream cheese for the mayo,  mozzarella for the feta, and turkey bacon  instead of pork bacon I also took others idea  and added diced onion garlic to the stuffing and placed some lemon juice salt and peper on the outside before cooking it turned out creamy and goood

very good recipe but made quite a few changes per other reviews suggestions and based on other high rated recipes. First, I marinated the chicken breasts in buttermilk for 3 hours outside of the fridge. I sauteed 1 bag of fresh spinach in butter and added salt and pepper. Then i mixed 2 parts mayo with 1 part sour cream, added sun dried tomatoes and cooked turkey bacon pieces. mixed together with feta and jack cheese and added garlic salt. I used thin chicken breasts and rather than butterflying the breasts, I just wrapped them around the stuffing and then put a peice of bacon and pinned them together.  cooked in the oven for 45 minutes. came out fabulous!

Good solid recipe. Have so far made this twice and both times it turned out great - very tasty. (I admit I left off the bacon - a luxury I can't afford on a student budget - but the dish didn't seem to suffer for it at all.)

Loved this. All I had was chicken tenders and pounded them flat and seasoned with salt and pepper first. Layered 1/2 on bottom of casserole dish and put spinach mixture on top and then topped with remaining tenders. I also added some almonds to spinach mixture for a little interest. Brushed some EVVO on top and followed recommended directions from another reviewer for cooking. 400 covered for 15 minutes, uncovered for 20 and last 5 under broiler. It turned out perfectly.

I made this for dinner last night, and we all loved it.  However, I did modify it a bit. Instead of Bacon I rubbed extra virgin olive oil on the outside.  And I think next time we will cook it for less than an hour as the chicken got just slightly dry. But great nonetheless!

I switched this recipe up quite a bit.  First, I added about 2 tablespoons of ranch instead of mayo to the spinach.  I threw in some chopped onions and Kraft three-cheddar blend shredded cheese.  Stuffed it into the chicken and sprinkled the chicken with a tiny bit of garlic salt, pepper, and bread crumbs.  I skipped the bacon because I frankly think bacon is gross.

Simply delicious! I used fat free mayo and two extra cloves of garlic. I also precooked the bacon in the microwave in layers of paper towel for 3 minutes before wrapping the chicken with them. After baking for the requisite hour I turned up the oven (most to heat bread for the meal) to 425 and the bacon crisped nicely. The chicken remained moist and delicious. I will definitely make this again and would probably use prosciutto next time, not for flavour necessarily, but for aesthetics. Yum!

AMAZING!
This is the first review I have left on this site, and for a good reason. It is incredible! I made two simple, important substitutions. First, I sauteed the garlic until it was browned before I added it to the mixture. Second, I substituted the cup of mayo (gross) with fat free plain Greek yogurt. (Also substituted turkey bacon because I don't eat pork - regular bacon might have been better, though.)
Also, since I was in a hurry, I covered it, cooked it for half an hour, drained some juice, uncovered it, broiled a few minutes.
The result was phenomenal. I would eat this every day of my life.

Very good!  Was a little work.  Had trouble stuffing the chicken and keeping it closed.  Used many toothpicks. =] Opted for fresh spinach sauteed in a little olive oil and sprinked with garlic powder, salt and pepper.  used mont/jack cheese for this dish.  Browned the bacon first, removed from pan and browned my chicken in the bacon dripping before baking.  Next time will take others suggestions and pound out chicken and roll.  Will make again.

This recipe had good flavor and the filling tasted almost like a spinach dip before cooked! Loved it. I did make a few changes which I think made it creamier with more flavor. I used the amout of mayo indicated and then added a little sour cream so it would be creamier. I also added mushrooms (because I love them!) and extra feta. My chicken breasts were very thick so next time I think i would pound each breast half out and roll this mix inside. Thanks for the recipe, my husband loved it and I will definitely make it again!

I flattened the chix breast then put a piece of ham on the breast, sautéed onions and garlic mixed them with wilted fresh spinach and feta.  No mayo and no bacon.  Followed the recipe after that and made a great sauce when it came out of the oven with some chix stock.  Low in calories and delicious as well.

Excellent flavor.  I had to make a few adjustments simply because I didn't have everything on hand that I needed.  I had fresh spinach, so I sauteed it with a little olive oil and parmesan cheese.  Then I mixed that with the mayo, bread crumbs, garlic, and shredded mozarella since I didn't have any feta.  I didn't have bacon either, so i just folded them over and baked them.  I put the olive oil and lemon juice mixture (about 2tbsp of each) and some minced garlic over, as was recommended by others.  It had a wonderful flavor!  The only issue I had was it was a little undercooked, but they were huge chicken breasts...they were actually better reheated b/c they were cooked a little more.

Really good but needed only 45-50 min cook time. I used really big chicken breasts and they were still a little dry. Skipped the bacon to save calores and it still had more than enough flavor.

I made this as a treat for myself and boy was it worth it! I used tomato and herb feta instead of plain and wow! It was tangy, zesty and just delicious! I also used the prosciutto to wrap the chicken breast.  I am going to use this recipe on fish too! I can't wait!

Delish!  I made this very nearly as the recipe states.  I increased to 5 servings and followed the advice of other reviewers and included some sour cream in the spinach mixture.  I used Hormel pre-cooked bacon and it worked great!  Crisp and not at all greasy. Followed another reviewer's advice and cooked at 400*, covered for 20 minutes and then uncovered for 15-20 more minutes - didn't need to use the broiler.  Oh, prior to sticking it in the oven I sprinkled some rotisserie chicken seasoning on top.    Served with green beans and acorn squash...yummy!  Thanks!

Great recipe! I did tweak it a little though. Instead of garlic cloves I used about 1 table spoon of minced garlic, 1/2 cup of yellow and green onions, cut the bacon and put it in the chicken, and breaded the chicken with Lemon pepper panko bread crumbs. Came out great!!!!!

I did not have any feta cheese at the house so for the spinach mixture I used 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese instead. I omitted the mayo completely (didn't have mayo anyway) and used 1 egg mixed with the spinach and cheese. I also used 7oz. of mushrooms and 1tsp of garlic, which I chopped in my food processor and mixed it in as well. I followed the directions for stuffing the chicken except I didn't butterfly... b-c all I had on hand were thin cut chkn breasts...so I just rolled it over the mixture. I wrapped them with prosciutto instead of bacon (to cut down on fat content) and used a toothpick to hold them together. I sprinkled some pepper and EVOO on top and baked in oven as directed. Cannot believe I just got my husband to eat spinach! =Success.

Delicious! I of course seasoned my chicken prior to baking, but it couldn't have been better. :)

This recipe was great!  I had some blue cheese I needed to use so I replaced the feta with blue cheese, which turned out really good.  I also used a piece of thinly sliced deli ham to wrap around the chicken, which browned nicely since I read in some of the reviews that the bacon didn't cook well.  If you have a hard time butterflying (my supermarket only had big, thinly sliced chicken breasts), just cover the flat chicken breast with the spinach mix and then fold the chicken breast in half, securing it with the ham and toothpick.  Overall, great recipe!  Can't wait to try it again with a different cheese!

I'll try this recipe again but I'm adding more cheese and seasoning the chicken before cooking.  I used garlic and herb feta crumbles which gave the spinach filling a great flavor.

This was absolutely delicious, and very simple to make!  I used fresh spinach instead of frozen (frozen is gross and mushy), and substituted precooked bacon for raw bacon.  I seasoned the outside of the chicken breasts with salt and pepper and added the precooked bacon 10 minutes before it was done.  This gave all of the bacon flavor, without all of the fat.  Also, I would recommend cooking for 50 minutes, not an hour.

Served this for dinner with friends and got so many great compliments.  Made some changes:  used sour cream instead of mayo, thawed the spinach in the microwave for 4 minutes on high, used goat cheese & Laughing Cow cheese instead of feta, no garlic, and 1/2 cup homemade bacon bits.  Cut the chicken breasts in half length wise & wrapped the mixture with the chicken breast & partially cooked bacon.  Brushed olive oil & garlic over chicken breast & bacon.  Cooked for 25 minutes at 375 (covered with foil), then 20 minutes at 400, taking the foil off at the last 5 minutes.  Perfect.

This was delicious!!! I read over the reviews and recipe then customized mine a bit. Prepared as directed. Seasoned the spinach mixture with sea salt and garlic pepper. Then seasoned the bacon wrapped and stuffed chicken with some onion powder and nature's seasoning. I also mixed lemon juice, olive oil, oregano and garlic and drizzled that over the chicken. Baked at 375 for 30 min the removed the foil and broiled for about 10 min to crisp the bacon (used 2 slices per chicken). It was very juicy and had a nice pan sauce. I drizzled some of the sauce over my rice. My husband and I were impressed, will make again, yum!!!

Really good-nice flavor.  Next time I make this, I would probably broil the chicken for a couple minutes at the end of cooking to make the bacon get crispy.

Yum!!!  did not butterfly but instead spread mixture on prosciutto on the breast and "rolled" and held with a toothpick.  Baked at 400 on convection for 15 min covered then another 10 minutes uncovered.  Then broiled for about 5 minutes.  It oozed all over, but I just spooned the cheese/spinach mixture over the breast rolls.  Very yummy.

Excellent! I did not butterfly the chicken, I just pounded it thin then rolled up the filling inside and secured with toothpicks.  I only had fresh spinach on hand so I steamed that for 30 seconds then squeezed out as much liquid as possible, added herbed feta and Smart Beat mayo, and I used turkey bacon.  Great flavor!

I used plain yogurt instead of mayo, goat cheese instead of feta, and added sauteed mushrooms and shallots. I cooked the bacon about 3/4 of the way. I used about 1/2 piece of bacon per chicken breast. Might use a little less next time, and also might increase the ratio of yogurt/cheese to spinach. Very tasty!

I found these to be very greasy in the pan. I ended up taking them out of my baking dish and putting them on the broiler pan for 15min to help drain off some of the grease. I should have taken the advice of some other reviewers and pre-cooked the bacon a little bit before wrapping the chicken. The flavour of the filling was great though. I used asiago cheese instead of feta and it still tasted great.

Boring, dry and far too much fat content for the lack of flavor in this dish.  I do not recommend this recipe for those who need flavor in exchange for calories.   I don't mind mayonnaise or bacon when it's worth it.  This dish is not worth it

I rated this 5 stars because even though I added some things to it the recipe was still a great base. My husband I absolutely loved it. I soaked the chicken breast in a water/kosher salt/sugar brine for 2 hours beforehand. I added sauted jalapeño, onion and garlic cloves to the stuffing. I also added extra feta plus mozzarella and parmasan cheese. Some seasonings were thrown in too. Like Some other users I cooked the bacon partially before wrapping. Once the chicken breast were stuffed and bacon wrapped I squeezed fresh lemon juice over the top of each so the seasoning would stick. On top I sprinkled Tony's creole seasoning, salt & pepper. This turned out so great. The only thing I'll change the next time I make this is the season the whole chicken breast at the beginning instead of just at the end. I found when biting into just chicken it was too plain. Great recipe!

I always up the seasoning; I added onion powder, a dash of cayenne, pepper to the sPinach mixture.  I added some real bacon bits as well.  Seasoned the outside and sprinkled paprika for color.  I also partially cooked the bacon; didn't need toothpicks, just tucked the ends under.   I went with 350 degrees for 45 min.

This was awesome.  My husband and I loved it and he asked that I make it on a regular basis.  The only changes I made were to use prosciutto not bacon, and I seasoned the chicken with garlic powder, onion powder and pepper--but there was so much flavor that I bet it would have been great even without the seasonings.  Thank you Laurie!

I made this recipe as written.  I took one suggestion that someone had made about cooking it in chicken broth for fear of it being dry without a coating.  I also cooked it in a corningware dish with a covered top.  I'm glad I used it because it was dry.  I used chicken stock, not broth.  I think the cooking time is far too long and that is why the breasts come out so dry.  The filling is delicious.  Check out the cooking time on other stuffed chicken breast recipes and you will see that most of them call for a 350F oven and 45 minute cooking time.  If this were done, I think that this would have been a 5.

The spinach mixture was good only have a lot of adjustments. As stated the whole dish was very very boring. I added serveral different cheeses, garlic and onion to the spinach mixture and the seasoned the chicken too.

This was terrific and very easy to make. I upped the quantity to 6 breasts and adjusted everything else accordingly except  I used two full boxes of the 10 oz. spinach instead of one and a half for the adjusted ingredients. I managed to use it all, but I had planned on frying up any leftover if I couldn't get it all stuffed in. I added sauteed onions and warmed the garlic, used frozen leaf spinach because that's all I had. It was great. I also prefer goat cheese instead of feta. Taking others' suggestions, I used prosciutto instead of the bacon. It just seemed a bit more elegant to me and less greasy. I almost used Miracle Whip because we don't keep mayo in the house, but I saw Kraft had a sandwich shop mayo garlic and herb flavored so I got that and I believe it really added to the recipe. Delish!! By wrapping the stuffed chicken in prosciutto, I didn't even need to use toothpicks. They held together beautifully. I baked them covered for 45 minutes at 350 degrees then removed the foil and baked another 10 minutes and broiled another 5 minutes to make sure they were nice and browned. They probably would have been fine with a little less time, though.  I almost forgot to mention this. I squeezed a lemon over the chicken before covering and baking them. This also added a wonderful flavor to this dish. I only served buttered noodles with this and that was plenty. I forgot to get a picture of them. Guess I'll have to make them again real soon-YEAH!!!

One of the best chicken dishes I've ever had and extremely good for impressing the ladies.  Thanks a bunch! When I say combine, the only thing I did was to add the mushrooms and the sauce and I thought it was even better that way.

To be honest I would have given it 3 stars, but it was easy to make and that counts for a lot in my book.  It wasn't the best thing I've ever had, but I thought it was good and will make it again and again.

This was a delicious recipe!! defiantly plan on making this more. I baked my chicken in pyrex that was just big enough for the chicken. I check on them 20 mins before the cooking time was up and noticed that there was allot of juices so I drained the dish and left them uncovered for the last 20 mins. The bacon turned out perfect and had a nice crisp to it. next time I plan on not draining  all the juices as the chicken was a little dry.

This has become my "go to dish" for company.  Everyone loves it- including my kids.  It is easy and delicious!  The only change that I have made is that after the chicken is done, I stick it under the broiler for a few minutes to brown the bacon.

This dish came out great.  I'm not much of a cook, but trying, and this was very easy for me.  My boyfriend commented that if he got this at a restaurant he would have a hard time not ordering it again the next time he went.  (huge compliment!)

Most of the filling came out after I had rolled it. Next time I would add the filling in between two chicken fillets and pound the edges to keep them together. Otherwise, I loved it!

Hats off to this recipe!  I made a double batch for 5 people, there was hardly any left! I used fresh spinach,  I accidentally bought WAY too much spinach this week so I was looking for ways to use it up. I also added a fresh orange pepper and just a little bit of room temp cream cheese and fresh Parmesan shredded. I served the chicken on a steaming bed of hand picked Minnesotan wild rice. Everybody went crazy for it and thanked me repeatedly. Needless to say I will be making this again.

I'll keep this recipe but it was a little bland make sure your season the chicken before adding the spinach filling.

My Oh My!  What an awesome recipe!  It was absolutely  yummy.   I had five thin sliced chicken breasts so I placed appx one tablespoon mixture on the chicken breast, after I had sprinkled garlic, garlic and onion powder over the breast.  I used crumbled herb and feta cheese for more flavor and I used a 10 oz. package of steamed spinach.  Instead of bacon, I used proscuitto wrapped around the breast.  Cooked it covered at 350 for 30 mins., uncovered and upped the temp to 375 for the last 15 mins.  This is the best!  Will be making again, and again.

These were easy to make and turned out great. I only had fresh spinach on hand, so I just went ahead and chopped that (I used about 4 oz, which turned out to be plenty). My bacon was a bit rubbery on the bottom, so I turned the breasts over just before they were done cooking and broiled the bottoms for 5 minutes or so. I also sauteed the spinach I had leftover and served that with some jasmine rice.  Not too shabby I must say, not too shabby at all.

Loved this recipe...but I did make some changes in it.  I didn't wrap the chicken in bacon I also thought it would make them too greasy so I put bacon in the stuffing mix instead.  Cut into small pieces.  I also added some scallions, mushrooms and olive oil.  For the tops of the chicken I made and coating out of rosemary, basil, tyme, pepper to taste, tbl sppon of butter and olive oil and poured over chicken...all I have to say is yum :)

My wife and I enjoyed this tonight.  The only change that I made as suggested by others is that I uncovered the baking dish for the last 20 minutes and put on the broiler for the last 5 minutes.  It came out very moist and tasty.  The bacon adds great flavor.  This recipe is a keeper and worth considering for a dinner party.

For those who said the chicken breast was dry. Before stuffing them.    Try brining the breasts overnight and they will be moist.  When cooked through, to brown and crisp up the bacon use the broiler for a minute or two.

Super great, I make this recipe as is, and instead of bacon, I crush French's Fried Onions, and pat it on top of each slice of chicken. Oh my goodness, tastes good, adds extra calories, but boy does it smell good, and makes the outside of the chicken crunchy!! YUM!!

The best chicken breast ever! My husband likes this better than the Chicken cordon bleu II  recipe on this site.I used regular feta 1/2 a chopped tomato, 1/2 cup fresh basil and leeks. Put extra filling around chicken for sauce. Broil for 5 minutes at end to brown bacon.

Delicious!!!  I took some of the suggestions and substituted Parmesan for Feta; added sundried tomatoes; used fresh spinach and sour cream instead of mayo.  I used two slices of Maple Turkey Bacon and cooked uncovered.  The chicken produced quite a bit of liquid which I spooned over the rice served w/ the dish.  Also seasoned chicken w/ garlic powder and pepper.  YUMMY!!

Fabulous flavour!!  I used boneless thighs because it's what I had, then skipped the bacon, and rolled them in crushed crackers before baking.  Also added pepper to mixture.  Fabulous reviews from the whole family, (even picky brother-in-law who ate all the leftovers!) We're coming up with ideas now for other goodies we can use this filling in!  Thanks!

I made this exactly as the recipe says and everyone said it was great. I even had enough to stuff 2 extra breasts PLUS more. My only problem was the amount of oil in the baking pan made the bacon on the bottom not as crispy as the bacon on top. Next time maybe I'll either put it on a broiler pan or turn it over for a few minutes to give the bacon some color. I also left it in the overn a little longer so the bacon could be a little crispier! Great recipe :)

Very tasty!  I precooked the bacon a little bit since I like it a little crispy.  I also browned the chicken really quickly before stuffing since I like the flavor.  The feta mixed in very well and was not overpowering at all.  Great recipe!

WOW! This is GOOD! I changed up the method a bit cause I wanted to use fresh spinach... I cooked the bacon about halfway in a frying pan and then sauteed the spinach in the grease, removed from heat and mixed in the other ingredients straight into the pan. Some had mentioned that the chicken itself was a little bland and I don't like plain chicken, so I marinated it in Newman's Oil & Vinegar salad dressing cause I thought the flavor of it would go well (and it did!). Let it soak for about an hour- wouldn't let it go much longer though cause the vinegar starts to break the chicken down, but 1 hour just perfectly tenderized and flavored the chicken. So anyhow, other than that, did as directed and the outcome was DE-LISH!

A hit at home; everyone loved it.  Served with basmati rice and mustard/brown-sugar carrots.  Found I had a lot of left-over spinach filling though...wouldn't all fit in the breasts.

Definately butterfly then pound out your breasts. Then saute or grill to get some color on the outside. Initially, I like using lemon pepper and garlic powder to season the chicken. The sauteing or grilling cuts down on the cooking time in the oven, usually around 20-25 min in a 350 degree oven. I used half mayo and half sour cream for the stuffing as well as a little roasted red bell pepper and mozzarella cheese. If you dont like feta you could customize this dish to use just provalone, mozzarella or fontina and it would be delishious that way as well.

The only changes I made, were that I used thighs instead of breasts (I think breasts are too dry) and since I don't eat pork, I wrapped pastrami around the stuffed chicken instead of bacon. It was FABULOUS tasting and SO easy.

Yum!  I marinated the chicken with olive oil, lemon juice, and oregano first.  I also added onion and bread crumbs to the filling mixture, and left out the bacon.  Very good, though I probably wouldn't cook it for the entire hour next time.

Wonderfull! I 've made this several times now & always  asked for the recipe.I follow the recipe as is, I also use a "home cured" bacon I get at a local meat store and wrap the each piece of  chicken in 2 pieces of bacon. I tie the bacon on with a piece of string ( not too tight)  & found it holds better & remove just before serving. Thanks again for this tasty, impressive recipe!

This was a great recipe. The only thing I will change next time is less mayonnaise and maybe some ricotta cheese. other than that it was great.

The taste was pretty good (3.5 stars) but the prep -- preparing and stuffing the chicken breasts -- was not worth the hassle (3 stars).  It reminded me a lot of another chicken florentine recipe I have, but no stuffing necessary.  I may take some components of this recipe and add to the other one to make it really outstanding, but I probably won't make this one again just.  And once again I swear NEVER to try another stuffed chicken breast recipe because I just can't get them right.

I made this Friday evening - it was fantastic.  My wife and I love garlic, so I doubled up on that, and substituted prosciutto for the bacon.  I set the oven for 395 and put about a quarter cup of broth in the baking pan to help keep the chicken moist.  I baked for 30 minutes covered with aluminum foil, then uncovered for an additional 15 minutes to brown up the outside.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Wow!! My husband says these are insanely good. Don't hesitate to try these because they are as good as the reviews show. I found it too difficult to butterfly the chicken so I hammered them flat between plastic and then put the spinach on and rolled it up. I poured a mixture of corn oil, garlic, fresh lemon juice and fresh cilantro over the chicken just b4 I baked it. Once it was done. I uncovered it and broiled for a few minutes to get the bacon more crispy. I used all sour cream instaed of mayo and it worked great.     Update: The second time I made this I used parmesan cheese cuz I didn't have feta and also put crushed red pepper into the spinach.This time I used mayo like the recipe calls for and I thought it seemed a bit wet, so I crumbled a big handful of crackers and put it w/ the spinach. I sprinkled fried crumbled bacon over top b4 baking. I was wanting it to be done by the time we got home for church and this was going to be a problem since we were going to be gone for 3 hours, so I put it in the oven at 250 degrees for those 3 hours (tightly covered) and it was perfect when we got home. Nice and moist. I sprinkled fresh lemon juice over it b4 serving. Everyone loved it!! The crushed red pepper really added a lot.

I added the lemon juice, olive oil, oregano, and garlic mix on top of chicken about 25 minutes into the cooking...It baked covered until about the last 6 minutes, just to let it get a little brown on top. I also added Parmesan cheese to the spinach mixture...Added great flavor, and complemented the feta!

This was a great recipe! I did make some adjustments though. I used fresh spinach and cooked it with sauteed garlic, onion, cremini mushrooms and bell pepper. Fot the sauce mix I added a samll amount of perlinis and cut the feta down a bit. I also wraped it with prosciutto instead of the bacon. I cooked it at 350 for about 30 minutes then uncovered and cooked it for an additional 5-8 minutes at 450. It turned out delicious!!!! Thanks for the great recipe!!

I made this tonight for dinner and it came out fabulous! I took the other reviews suggestions and pan fried the chicken after pounding them down. I attempted to roll them but due to the partial cooking it more turned out like folding them over. I baked at 375 for 30 min and 5 min under the broiler and it came out delicious! The only issue I had was that I had a TON of spinach mixed left over though I suppose I could use it for something else. Thanks! :D

This was surprisingly good!  I made a few changes though, as some suggested.  First, I lightly browned the chicken breasts in some olive oil, salt, pepper and garlic salt (just a little)and I think this gave the chicken a lot of flavor.  For the stuffing, I only had Miracle Whip light on hand so I cut back on the miracle whip and added equal parts melted cream cheese.  I only had fresh spinach on hand so I wilted it in the microwave as was suggested.  Also, I partially cooked the bacon in the microwave before wrapping the chicken because it will definitely not get crispy in the oven.  Before I put it in the oven, I sprinkled some pieces of crispy bacon and the olive oil mixture I browned the chicken in on top.  It turned out really well!  I could though, taste the miracle whip which I did not like.  I think next time I will use real mayo.  Thanks!!

My husband and I loved this recipe!  (Kids weren't keen on the spinach, though!)  I used 2 bunches of fresh spinach (1 min. in the microwave to wilt), 3 cloves of garlic, 1 small shallot and feta with red pepper and herbs.  Sprinkled the split breasts with Lawry's garlic salt before stuffing.  I cut the bacon strips in half and just laid the strips on top of the chicken.  I forgot to cover mine, but I think this might have been better.  I baked at 375* for 45 minutes and, as others recommended, put it under the broiler for a few just to crisp the bacon.  The meat was not dry at all and this was such an easy recipe!  I think I'll use frozen spinach next time (so time consuming to separate the fresh leaves from the stems).  Will make this again and again...

Wow!  I mixed 2 parts Top the Tator Sour Cream with 1 part Mayo, added the pressed garlic and Parmesan cheese.  (Didn’t have Feta or Gorgonzola on hand).  I used fresh spinach and layered it inside the split chicken breast with sliced Monterey Jack cheese, and the sauce mentioned above, and then wrapped it in bacon.  Wow!  Be sure to save a little of the sauce for dippin’!

This really didn't turn out nearly as good as it sounded. The spinach flavor was much too strong for me even though I like spinach. It just overpowered everything else. I might try this with fresh baby spinach instead of the canned.

We loved this recipe...I read about the soggy bacon, so the last about 7 min I took out of oven, transfered to another pan (to drain from grease)and broiled it for the last 7 min.  Bacon was crispy and chicken was awesome! We'll definitely make again.

Good recipe for chicken. Even used low fat mayo, and it still came out great. I did leave out the bacon due to fat already present from the mayo, but I think that it would have been 5 stars if I had added it (I love bacon, just not the fat). A definite keeper!

This is a very good recipe and so easy. I pounded the chicken breasts, wrapped the stuffed breasts in two strips of bacon and sprinkled them with a bit of lemon pepper before baking. At someone's suggestion, half way through the cooking, I drizzled the rolls with a mixture of olive oil,lemon zest and lemon juice. 

Serve it for company with an orzo/rice pilaf and a salad or other vegetable. It will impress.

This was great! - The second time I made this, I changed a few things. I used less spinach, but added some red and green peppers, onions and mushroom. Sub cream cheese instead of mayo and you will love it. Definately 5 stars either way you do it!

Marvelous for someone who is on a low carb diet.  I did adjust after reading all the reviews.  First, I used frozen spinach.  Then in a bowl, I threw in spinach (after I cooked it for about 5 minutes), crushed croutons, parmesan cheese, garlic paste- about a 3/4 tsp, the lite mayo (I love mayo) and a dash of cornstarch.  I had no problem butterflying the chicken... I basted it with olive oil, oregano, lemon pepper, lemon juice, salt and black pepper (all to taste)... then I stuffed plenty of the spinach mixture into it.  I didn't use bacon or toothpicks to hold it together... the chicken held together just fine.  And voila!  I couldn't believe how good it was... next time I am going to double the spinach mixture though.  EXCELLENT!!!

Great recipe, very easy to make and tastes gourmet. Doesn't reheat as well as i would have liked. I didn't need to use toothpicks the bacon held the chicken in place. Make sure you drain the spinich after defrosting it otherwise the stuffing gets really runny.

Excellent.  I baked the chicken uncovered for 45 mins and then broiled it for 5 minutes to brown the chicken and bacon.

Excellent recipe! My husband and I both really enjoyed it. I made a few changes. We're not fans of mayo, so following others advice, I mixed together 1/2 part sour cream and 1/2 part cream cheese. We also didn't have any frozen spinach, so I fried some fresh spinach in a little oil and garlic. I also added a touch of Provence spices and a bit of tomato paste. The chicken wasn't entirely defrosted when I cooked it, but it was still a bit overdone. Will reduce the cooking time next time around. May also brine the chicken. In all though, it was so tasty. The spinach and feta mix is the perfect foil for the bacon. Thanks for the recipe. We'll definitely make it again!

I made this last night for my boyfriend and his brother. It was pretty good however the chicken was kind of plain. I would probably brown the chicken first and season it then bake it. I also added some mozzarella cheese to it and covered the chicken breasts with 3 pieces of bacon. I also used turkey bacon,light mayo and light feta instead. I made a sauce out of the drippings in the pan and poured it over the chicken. I just added a couple tbs of heavy whipping cream to it to make it thicker. It was great! I will definately make this again.

The spinach filling is very tasty.  I think next time I will try browning the chicken first, though, as others suggested (for presentation purposes - because it looked a little pale).

I followed the recipe except used 1/2 of mayo and used sour cream also. Everyone loved it. It reminded me of Greek food, and was truly delicious. Served with peas and corn and had no left overs. Thanks for a great recipe

Oh boy.  Okay, one warning, do NOT use turkey bacon!!  I did in an attempt to make these healthier, and the flavor of the turkey bacon overpowered everything!  Yuck.  Other than that, these had a nice presentation and would probably taste great.  I did baste them with an olive oil/lemon juice mixture and baked them on a rack in the oven in a pan (so the grease dripped off).  Also, I used tomato/basil feta and did not like the flavor.  Will try again, perhaps with a different cheese.

Yum! My boyfriend suggested that these need a cream sauce (he said Alfredo). I used a roasted pepper and garlic feta. I also used fresh spinach, and cooked it in the microwave for 2 minutes. Overall, really good! If I do this again, I will top the finished product with a creamy sauce and serve over pasta. I found that at 350 degrees it only needs 35 minutes (I pounded the breasts to a quarter inch thickness).

This recipe was very good.  I followed it exactly.  It's amazing how you don't need any additional seasoning.  The bacon does it all.  I served this with a greek salad, spicy hummus and mini pita breads (from Trader Joe's).  What a perfect, EASY meal.  Even my youngest son enjoyed it and he usually won't eat anything "fancy"...  Try it!

First time I've tried a stuffed chicken recipe and this one came out really good. I followed other readers' advice and preseasoned the breasts with onion & garlic powder, plus browned them lightly before stuffing, wrapping with bacon and baking. I baked them 1/2 time covered, and 1/2 the time uncovered so that the bacon wouldn't come out soggy looking. The breasts came out very moist and very nicely flavored. The strongest recommendation I would make is to absolutely brown the meat before you bake it! The golden brown color makes such a nicer presentation. Overall, great recipe! Thanks!

I do agree this recipe is bland, but a little tweeking and it can be delicious.  I used lofat mayo, herb feta cheese, fresh spinach, fresh garlic of course, turkey bacon and a little bit of chicken broth to keep the meat from drying out.  It's a snap!

I made this for dinner tonight. We all liked it a lot.  I made a few changes though. 
I omitted the mayo and bacon and added a little chopped red onion and salt/pepper to the mixure.  I also pounded the chicken breast flat and rolled them instead of butterfling the chicken. I poured a little Kraft Roasted Red pepper Italian salad dressing on the chicken and added a sprinkle of paprika for color.  I baked it covered for 35 min at 400*.  I served it with rice. Very yummy!

My husband looooved this.  I was a little worried because I'd never "butterflied" chicken before, or tried any stuffed-chicken recipes, and I had alot of questions.  First, the chicken breasts seemed too thick for this to work.  Second, I made the recipe for two and I had waaay too much stuffing left over!  I probably had enough for 6 breasts.  I took the advice of MISCHIEVA and used sour cream instead of mayo, but next time I'll do half/half because it lacked a little salt.  I also cooked it at 400F for 45 mins, but then had to broil both sides for 7 minutes/ea because the bacon (thick sliced) didn't seem cooked enough.  Overall the recipe was great, I know because I just overheard my husband on the phone to his friend say he's just finished eating the best meal he's ever had.

Loved it!!! I changed it a little though. Once I crumbled and measured Feta 1/2 cup wasnt enough so I used an entire 4 oz container of Feta instead. The chicken didn't seem thick enough to stuff so I pounded it to about 1/4 inch thick, I breaded one side and lightly cooked that one side, then I put the spinach and cheese mixture in middle of breast, rolled used two slices of bacon on each breast and secured with skewer sticks. Having pounded it and lightly cooking one side made cooking time about 25 minutes instead of 60. Wonderful recipe!!

If there were a 6 star option, this recipe would have recieved it from me! We absolutly LOVED it! We did end up having extra bacon so we wrapped more bacon on the chicken breast and it not only added to the already wonderful flavor of the feta and spinach, but helped to hold them together very nicely! I may try other users suggestions and try cream cheese instead of mayo next time (only because I think it too sounds good). Overall, easy to make and a wonderful flavor. Will definitly make again and again! Thank you Laurie!

This was wonderful.  Even my picky 7 year old loved it.  Very easy to prepare.  Just make sure your chicken breasts are large enough to butterfly open. Mine weren't so I ended up with extra filling.  Which isn't a BAD thing. :-)

This recipe was pretty good although I found it a little bland. It could be spiced up easily enough. I cooked the chicken for 50 minutes (recipe says 1 hour) and found it to be a little dry. I would cut down the cooking time a little more next time.

Our family enjoyed this chicken dish and thought I spent hours preparing it.  Changes made to the recipe: mixed (1/4 - 1/2c.)ricotta cheese with shredded romano cheese, spinach (use about 1/2 cup per 2 chicken breast), a little egg substitute, sprinkle with basil, parsley and garlic. Put this mixture into the butterflied chicken. Placed in a glass dish, sprinkled oregano and real bacon bits on top, then poured a mixture of olive oil, lemon juice over the chicken, being careful not to wash off the bacon. Baked at 375 for about 45 min to 1 hour. Different baking times for the size of chicken breast. Served with red potatoes, green beans, salad and yeast rolls.

Very simple mix gave great flavour. Only changes made were a prosciutto wrap rather than bacon (suggested by another reviewer) and to season the chicken itself with salt and pepper. It came out a little pale looking as I couldn't get a good browning on it, but other than that it was delicious.

Living in Switzerland, I used aged gruyère cheese instead of feta. I also used fresh baby spinach from the garden. Delicious!

Do you know what I hate about recipe reviews? Well I didn't follow the recipe and added my own tweaks and it wasn't good so this recipe is not for me!!! 1 STAR!

I followed this recipe to the letter with ONE DIFFERENCE...I seasoned my breasts before starting the recipe, nothing groundshaking just a dash of Kosher Salt. This recipe was amazingly easy and soooooo good. The taste is great and its easy to make.

I received great reviews, from very tender to very flavourful.  The only issue I had was the bacon wasn't crispy enough so I'm planning to precook the bacon and hopefully that'll crisp them up.  First time I ever made a meal that I had to stuff the chicken, so for a newbie it quite easy. Recipe is simple.

Love this!!! I cut the chicken into chunks and double or triple the sauce.  I use fresh spinach and just  tear it up with my hands,  Then I cut up the bacon in bite size pieces and throw it all in a pan and bake it.  So easy!!!

I used plain Greek yogurt instead of mayo. I used fresh kale and spinach that I steamed and pressed. I put those in the food processor with minced garlic and feta. I stuffed the chicken, skipped the bacon, and drizzled it with Greek salad dressing. Baked at 350 for 20-25 minutes. It was moist and flavorful!

These were real easy to make.  I did, however, change up the cooking method. I cooked them on an open rack so the juices would drop to a pan below and did not cover them.  I think this helped to crisp up the bacon.  I also cut the breasts thinner and pounded them out so I could roll them easier.  Cooked for about 45 minutes and chicken stayed moist.  Flavor was very good and I will definitely make again.

I sprinkled garlic powder, a little salt and pepper on the chicken and also uncovered the chicken and put it on broil for an extra 10 minutes to crisp the bacon. It came really moist and delicious.

I made this and found it to be bland and boring. I added pine nuts to the stuffing and did not use the bacon because I feared it would not be crisp particularly under the chicken. I  used the olive oil, lemon juice brushed on the top suggested by someone and that caused it to have a very lemony taste and did nothing else. I had hoped it would help crisp the top, it did not. I baked covered for 1/2 hour and then uncovered and the chicken had no browning and was as though it had been steamed because of the covering. Had I used bacon it would have been terrible.

Great recipe, made for some easy variations!Instead of wrapping the chicken in bacon, I precooked and crumbled the bacon into the stuffing mix. I also marinated the chicken in Italian seasoning, then dredged in flour/breadcrumbs and lightly pan fried before putting into the oven.

I opted for no mayo.  Prosciutto on the inside instead of bacon wrapped.  Seared stove-top and broiled in the oven when done.  Added shredded carrots to the stuffing.  The feta cheese had roasted tomato already in it.  Came out great.  Paired it with veggies.  Very satisfying.

This was delicious! I made the recipe as written with the addition of salt and lemon pepper sprinkled over the chicken before cooking. I had, pre-portioned, 4oz chicken breasts so I ended up making six of these. Because my chicken breasts were so small, I worried about them popping open and losing all the yummy filling. To fix this, I tooth picked the bacon on one end of the breast and wrapped it around and down the length of the breast and then used another toothpick to secure the other end. It held the breast together nicely. I saw in the reviews that the chicken was dry. I felt that the cooking time was a little long so I did change the way I cooked it. Instead of simply baking the chicken for a specified amount of time, I used my cooking probe to cook the chicken to 165 degrees. Once it reached that temp, I removed the foil and turned on the broiler for about 8 minutes to darken up the tops. It was beautiful! This is a great recipe that also looks very nice.

I use fresh spinach, tomatoe-basil goat cheese feta, and add onion to the mix. Towards the end of cooking time (last 15 min or so), I take the lid off and switch over to convection ti crisp the bacon. Yum!

Full of flavor. The only thing I did was pound the chicken breast even, after cutting them.  Make sure you only cook  them to 165 degrees to keep them moist.

I think this recipe is a very good start, that many cooks have experimented with, over the time it's been on Allrecipes. I made it for the first time tonight, with a few of the variations (flash-browned the chicken, added cream cheese and a little mozarella to the filling, added some mushrooms, and the lemon-butter-garlic sauce poured over). The main difficulty I had was getting the breasts to close up once they were stuffed. I think it would be easier if they were flattened a bit, and I may try pounding them and then rolling them next time. If you do flash-brown your chicken, be aware that it makes them harder to close up. 

The bacon worked out very nicely but I did pre-cook it a bit in the microwave. The lemon juice & butter sauce also worked out very well. I had a fresh lemon & I think it made a difference in the taste. My hubby likes to have a sauce on just about anything including chicken.

Well, just wanted to thank all of you for a great base and a lot of great variations to play with. Hubby was very impressed and wondered what he had done to get such a special dish on a Thursday!  :)  Oh, and it didn't take an hour to cook, more like 40 minutes.

My family LOVED this!  I used 3-4 cups of fresh chopped spinach instead of frozen.  I also found that Turkey Bacon did not leave my chicken greasy as several of the other comments state.  It was a huge success and very DELICIOUS!

I would have added a photo, but it was all gone by the time I thought of it.  LoL!

Would give it 4 1/2 stars. I cooked the bacon in the microwave for 1 min. Added a doll up of sour cream to spinach mixture and added an egg. I was happy with this recipe and looks very fancy on the plate.

I loved it a lot..My hubby kept saying oh dear this is amazing....This recipe is a keeper!
The chicken was moist. I added prosciutto instead of bacon..Both on the inside and outside of the chicken breast..I seasoned the chicken with seasoning salt...Just a sprinkle...

Delicious. Easy to make. Would go great with rice. Better cooked at 400 and then uncovered and broiled till golden crispy. I added 2 more bacon strips, and it turned out fine.

I used chicken tenderloins, pounded thin.  Fresh spinach, sour cream, feta (forgot the garlic!), pureed, spread over chicken, rolled up. Into the oven 25 minutes at 350 degrees -- used a cast iron skillet so the bottom browned. I was going to do as suggested and brush w/ olive oil but that too I forgot.  DH licked his plate.  The spinach mixture will now serve as a sandwich spread w/ deli sliced chicken or as a pasta topper, once I add the garlic.  Too much good in here for one recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

My family loved it. I didn't have any mayo so I used sour cream instead. I also add a little fresh parmesan I had in the fridge into the stuffing. It was a simple recipe. I did cover it covered for 40 minutes and uncovered for 15 then broiled it for the last 5 to get a crunch on the bacon. Excellent. Already had request to fix it again!! I had leftover stuffing so I added it to cornbread muffin mix. It was a hit.

Keep in mind that this is coming from someone who isn't a chicken lover. I need a lot of added flavor to really enjoy chicken. That being said, I'm not sure I would make this again. If so I'd definitely tweak a bit, adding a pinch of salt and maybe some sun-dried tomatoes to the spinach mixture.

Delicous!  The only thing I did differently was season the chicken first, bind it instead of using toothpicks (easier to sear) and then seared it in a hot skillet to get a nice brown look before putting them in the oven.  My family loved them.  This is a keeper!

This was wonderful!  I followed the filling recipe exactly, but pounded the chicken, instead of butterflying it.  (My knife skills are not the best!) I baked it for 1 hour, then took the foil cover off and baked for 20 minutes more.  Perfect!  I also used the olive oil, oregano, and lemon juice drizzle.  I will make this again.  My husband and stepson loved it too!

Excellent. I made this for my granddaughter and daughter-in-law and both loved it. They also said that the filling is good enough to stand on its own as a spinach dip...kudos.
The only thing I did differently was to finish cooking under the broiler to crisp up the bacon.

AMAZING! I made a couple of changes though...1st i didnt have any frozen spinach, but had fresh spinch, I sauteed that with 2 small cloves of garlic, a little onion and fresh mushrooms in some olive oil and lemon juice. Then, instead of completely mayo, I mixed the Feta/spinach sautee with 1 1/2 oz of plain cream cheese with 1/4 up of mayo. (as someone suggested, we're not too big on mayo here, surprisingly I had some) Then, I wrapped that mixture inside of some slices of Proscuitto, and put that inside of some organic chicken breasts. As someone suggested I mixed lemon juice, olive oil, crushed garlic, and oregeno and drizzled it on the chicken breasts. Then I completely wrapped the chickens in bacon (3-4 peices per chicken breast, we love bacon.)  Then, I used the remainder of the Spinach/feta mix and stuffed some of the fresh mushrooms, and put those right in with the chicken. This also made a great mushroom stuffer. I baked it at 375 for about 50min, until the chicken was done. It was awesome, one of the best chicken dishes I've ever made. I would've taken a picture but it was gone too quick. I will definitely be making this again :)

Great recipe!
I took other reviewers advice and substituted the mayo for cream cheese, the feta cheese for goat cheese, as well as brushed the chicken with an olive oil/lemon juice/oregano mix. I cooked at 350 for 30 minutes (covered) and then broiled (450) uncovered for 5 minutes. The chicken was juicy and the bacon browned.

Loved it!  Easy to fix.  I used fresh spinach instead of frozen so couldn't really measure it.  I chopped the garlic in my Magic Bullet, added the feta and mayonaise, mixed that by hand and added the fresh spinich.  As the spinach wilted I kept adding more until I thought I had enough.  Also I used two strips of bacon crossed over each chicken breast.  Hubby loved it too, but he is a big fan of spinach.  Edited to add: tonight I realized I didn't have feta cheese, so added shredded mozzerella instead.  It was great!

I added a couple of things to this recipe; first I drizzled olive oil on the breasts and coated them with lemon pepper seasoned panko bread crumbs. I added nutmeg, salt and pepper to the spinach mixture, and instead of wrapping the it in turkey bacon, I cooked the bacon and crumbled the pieces into the spinach mixture. Came out pretty good.

Wow! I made this last night (with a few alterations) and it was fabulous! I didn't have all the ingredients on hand, but I was really craving a good stuffed chicken breast. I altered the ingredients as follows:
Added a small handful of jarred, chopped roasted peppers. I substituted Parmesan for the feta b/c I didnt have feta. I omitted the bacon b/c I didn't have it. It was great even without it!
So here is how I made the chicken:
Mixed together the spinach, mayo, parmesan, garlic. Butterflied the chicken and sprinkled with some salt and onion powder. Stuffed the chicken. Quickly seared both sides of the chicken in olive oil in a saute pan. Popped in the oven (covered) for 30 minutes. Perfection!

This came out very well for me, although I too made a few changes.  I substituted non fat Greek yogurt for mayo, and added some kalamata olives.  I also brushed on some olive oil on top of breasts and didn't use bacon as another user did.  Tender, flavors worked well together.  I would definitely make this again.

AMAZING.  Just flat-out amazing.  I cooked 4 chicken breasts but made enough of the "stuffing" for 5 and spread the extra on top.  (No reason, just a whim!)  Rave reviews all around!

I did exactly what it said, one hour is way too much! I left it in the oven for 35 min. The spinach and garlic is not a good combination, I'm not picky with food but gotta to say this recipe is not good!!!

Love this recipe! I have made it before years ago and have recently rediscovered it. The recipe was great as is, only this time I took the advice of other reviewers and cooked bacon for about 1 min in the microwave and it crisp up nicely while baking. Thanks for a great recipe Laurie!

3 to 4 as is because 1) bacon does not cook up crisp when the chicken is done...cook the bacon long enough to crisp and the chicken is overdone; and 2) filling is a tad bland. Both were easily fixed by paritally pre cooking the bacon and I took the suggestion of a previous poster and subsituted ranch dressing for the mayo to add more herb flavor. When the bacon is pre cooked you don't have to cook the chicken forever to get the bacon done/keeps the chicken from getting overcooked. Family gave it the thumbs up though I think it could do with one more clove of garlic in it next time.

Good, but like other reviewers said a little dry! and needed more flavor! bacon didn't add much flavor to the chicken. Probably will not be making again.

I don't really care for spinach all that much but thought if I was eating it with bacon and chicken it would be much better. I still wasn't that impressed but my boyfriend loved it! On a side note I would suggest cutting the mixture that you are stuffing the chicken with in half- it made way too much and I hate to let all that food go to waste.

Delicious. We had some cooked bacon instead of raw so we chopped it up and added it to the spinach mixture, it was delicious that way!

My husband and I tried this recipe a few nights ago, as is and it was good but needed some tweaking. I lightly seasoned my chicken breast with thyme, black pepper, and a little seasoning salt. I also added a pinch of salt to the spinach and feta mixture and omitted the bacon. Viola! The dish tasted wonderful and was well seasoned. I would definitely be making this again in the future.

I have not tried this yet but was looking for a similiar recipe.  While cooking chicken it was periodically drizzled with fresh lemon juice.  It gave the spinach a great flavor.  I don't think the recipe I tried had bacon though  and the stuffing was inserted under the skin of the chicken breast.

This is 4 to 4.5 stars for me.  It's very simple and quick to pop in the oven on a weeknight.  I used fresh spinach and it turned out just fine.  The second time I made it I didn't have any feta, so I used goat cheese and it tasted great, as well!  Very versatile.

Delicious!!  The only changes I made were to season the chicken breasts with garlic powder and to cook the chicken at 400 degrees for the last 20 minutes.

I LOVE this recipe! I always add more feta and diced onions to the mixture and season the top of the chicken before I put it in the oven. I also cook the bacon slightly before I wrap the chicken so the bacon is crispy instead of soggy. It's oh so good!!

only needed to cook for 45 minutes, and broiled the last 10 or so to crisp the bacon. Not the juiciest chicken, but it wasn't dry. I think next time I'll add more feta, but overall it was good and my hubby liked it!

This was a simple and fast to put together dish. I used precooked bacon strips. I did season the chicken with some salt and fresh ground black pepper. I'm not sure I would eat it again as I am not sure I cared too much for the spinach, but hubs gobbled it right up. I forgot to cover the baking dish, oh well, it still turned out fine. Thanks I might fix this again.

Not impressed. I made this a couple of nights ago. I added some fresh ground black pepper to the stuffing and some nature's seasoning season salt and fresh ground sea salt to both sides of the chicken, misted the pan and top of chicken with olive oil and this dish was still relatively flavorless. Won't make it again.

I thought this was good.  The only thing I added was some sundried tomatoes.  My husband didn't like it.  Which is weird because he loves spinach, feta cheese and sundried tomatoes...and mayo too.  HMMM.  But, he's just happy that I cook for him so he doesn't complain much =).

This is a favorite recipe of mine.  I did make a few changes.  I don't use mayo in the filling, and add some pepper for a kick.  I also don't use bacon.
After putting the filling in and securing with a toothpick, I pre-cook the chicken a little bit in a hot skillet, which basically cooks the outside and traps the juices inside and keeps it more moist after cooking in the oven.
I also used a mixture of lemon juice and some herbs (oregano, rosemary, and dried parsley) when I put it in the oven, cooking it covered for a bit, then uncovering it for 10 minutes and throwing a little bit of cheese on the top.
Note that the time in the oven is reduced because of the pre-cooking.
I serve it with some steamed white rice and a greens salad.  Makes for a delicious and healthy meal.

Delicious and simple. (Though I'll have to admit I had to look up how to make a butterfly cut and I used too much garlic!)  Bacon is a decent addition, but not necessary.  I'm sure you could figure out a way to keep it all together using less meat.

Loved this recipe.  I tried it with the bacon and with the prosciutto to see which one my family preferred.  The bacon won.  The prosciutto is good but quite dry.  The bacon made the chicken more moist and gave it more flavor.  Thank you for the recipe.  It's a keeper.

I did a trial run with the original recipe, and didn't like it much. So, I added in cheddar with the feta, as well as sauteed baby portabella mushrooms and shallots. I also salted with sea salt, and added fresh cracked pepper to the outside of the chicken. It gave it a bit more flavor that the original.  I served mine with a spring salad, and baked potatoes. [:

WOW. This is now my new favorite. I followed the recipie to the "T". My bacon was thick cut so I pre-cooked it in the micro and I used fresh spinach because I do not like frozen. Very tasty!

I gave it four stars but with modifications it gets five. I didn't use the flour and I split the chicken breasts so that they cooked evenly. I'm a big fan of vinegar, especially balsamic, so I loved the tangy taste of the chicken and sauce.  Next time I will make twice the amount of sauce because there just wasn't enough.

I followed this recipe exactly... Not very flavorful at all. I love love love feta and i really like cooked spinach and i like chicken...lol.. but I didnt like this. To be fair I give this a three because I think by adding some other ingredients to the mixture it might turn out better.

Made this for dinner and it was really tasty. Almost tasted like spinach dip inside the chicken. I added cooked bacon and sauted onions and a little bit of mozzarella to the mixture, and also used the flavored tomato basil feta. YUM!!

I loved this recipe! I used a spoonful of blue cheese along with some goat cheese instead of feta and added small diced red peppers. I dont exactly follow the measurements of each ingredient, more to taste. I made this for my boyfriends parents, for our first supper and they cant stop raving about it! hehe

Love this recipe.... I have changed it up occasionally by adding chopped sun dried tomatoes, or using flavored feta. Sundried Tomato and basil is one of my favorite flavors to use. I also use turkey bacon and it turns out just fine!

I put in broccoli b/c I didn't have enough spinach and it cooked up nicely.  Skipped the bacon and just secured them with toothpicks.  Very yummy!

I know I will be making this many more times! It was actually the first time I have ever tried spinach and I must say it was the perfect way to do it. I couldn't have asked for anything better. I made it for company and everyone loved it! I am so happy I came across this recipe. The only suggestion I have is make sure to lay the bacon down first, then place the unstuffed chicken on top, then fill and close, then wrap the bacon around the chicken. I didn't do it in this order because I forgot about the bacon until after I put the chicken in the pan and it was quite messy trying to lift the already stuffed chicken breasts to wrap around the bacon. Enjoy it as much as we did!

I have made this in the past and it has turned out a little dry. I am not a huge mayo fan so I switched it up a bit. For the filling, I use a little cracked black pepper and salt, 1/3 cup canola oil mayo, 1/3 cup feta crumbles, 1/3 c plain nonfat Fage greek yogurt, some toasted pine nuts, a little crushed garlic, and lots of fresh baby spinach, chopped up. I butterflied the chicken, then I sprayed a pan and browned the chicken a bit. while preheating oven. Then I cooked some turkey bacon up in the microwave. I mixed my feta/spinach filling and stuffed it into the breast pockets Using broken skewers (I could not find my toothpicks!) I secured a  couple of pieces of bacon to each breast and roasted in the oven for about a half hour.  They were delicious. Not as tart/sour as they have been i the past, thanks to the yogurt, and healthier too. They were moist, browned and perfect! YUM

this is the best recipe ever off all recipes.  it is just succulent and tasty and i used low fat feta and low fat mayonnaise as well as turkey bacon to cut down on the fat content.  i have taken it as my offering dish when we go out and had people over and served it always w/rave compliments.

I made this almost exactly as given in the directions, and it was wonderful! The only change I made was to cook it for slightly less time--after 50 minutes, my  meat thermometer tested it as "done." Didn't find it to be too greasy at all. Will definitely make again.

I made as stated and although very easy I did not care for the flavor of this at all. Maybe it was the feta cheese.  The chicken was a bit dry and the bacon did not cook up right.

Overall dish was good.  I used low fat cream cheese instead of feta (I didnt have it on hand).  Took others advice and added sautéed onions and sprinkled garlic powder and onion powder on the chicken.  Also used chicken filets instead of breast and omitted bacon (personal perference).

This recipe was easy and tasty. I seasoned the chicken breasts lightly with a Tony's, a little lemon juice and a sprinkle of Lea & Perrins and some paprika for color. I didn't measure the feta and probably used a little more than recipe called for. I baked it uncovered and the bacon browned nicely. Great combo of flavors. Would be good to serve for company because it looks and tastes like you spent a lot more time in the kitchen than you did.

This is a delicious and very impressive dish to serve company!  I made a few changes to our liking I used Monterey Jack cheese instead of Feta , only one clove of fresh garlic (we like our garlic very suttel) and drizzled with lemon juice and laid lemon slices on top.

I'm sorry to say this, but my entire family disliked this recipe. I had tried a couple of suggestions made by previous reviewers - seasoning the breasts before filling, uncovering the chicken to allow the bacon to crisp - and still the meal was disappointing.

Can I say YUMMM! My husband loved this and wants me to make it when his parents come to visit. I did cook it about 10 mins longer, by mistake, and it came out just right. So that would be my only change to this great recipe.

Very good recipe. I omitted the chopped garlic and used garlic salt instead, since I don't like a heavy garlic flavor. The feta cheese that I used had basil and other spices in it. That and a sprinkle of salt on top did the trick. Will make this one again.

Terrific!  I used broccoli b/c didn't have spinach.  I also used feta with basil and tomatos.  This added great flavor.  Will definitely make again!

Made these as stated in the recipe and they were wonderful! My 8-year-old absoultely loved them and anytime I can get her to eat spinach, it's a good thing. Very straightforward and easy to  make as well. Will definitely make them again! Thanks for a great recipe!

I went with what one review said and baked the chicken at 400 degrees; 15 min covered, 20 min uncovered, and 5 min on broil.  The bacon was still a bit soggy (I would have liked it to be crispy) and the chicken was very dry.  I'll cook the bacon separately next time.  The filling for this is fantastic and I did add some chopped onions...delicious!

Made this for Family last week.  Didn't change a thing, except I had five breasts. Had enough mixture to stuff all. Cooked with a cover and uncovered the last 15 minutes. Very tender and moist. Garlic was just right.  It was a big hit. My Son and wife had the remainder the next day.   My Son's wife wants me to make it for her parents. I can't wait to cook it again. The prep was so easy, what took the longest was getting spinach thawed.  Thanks for receipt.  Regards, Wood Halsey

Fabulous! I made this last night for my girlfriend and I, and neither of us could believe just how good it turned out. Soo much flavor. The only change I made was using fresh spinach, and using 2 strip of bacon on each chicken breast to hold in the stuffing better. Thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipe.
Update: I've made this several times now, always turns out great. My girlfriend's favorite.

I thought we had gone to a top-rate restaurant! This was so delicious. I did not cover it for the 1st 20 minutes, covered the next 20 and uncovered the last 20.

This was a great dish!!  We don't like feta so we used cream cheese in its place and it made it very creamy and tasty.  After cooking covered for the hour, we took off the cover and let it cook uncovered for about 5-8 minutes to cook the bacon thoroughly.  We will have this again and again.  Served over rice pilaf and what a meal it was!!  Thanks for sharing!!!

This recipe was easy to make.  It was good, but needs a little more flavor in the mix.  I seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper.

I have been making this recipe for several years and i absolutely LOVE it!!! The bacon does tend to be a little "soggy" so i broil it the last five minutes or so and turn them over so the other side gets crispy as well.  I have also tried it using fat free sour cream instead of mayo and that way is DELICIOUS too.  Sometimes i also add chopped sun dried tomatoes to the spinach mixture.  This is a MUST TRY!!

This turned out pretty good. It was pretty simple to make. Like other reviewers, I found that the bacon did not crisp up at all. I don't think it hurt too much though.

Found it pretty bland. Next time I will use a different kind of cheese instead of the feta. (Maybe cheddar and ricotta).

Great recipe as is, but I enjoyed reading everyone else's additions. The only substitution that I made was using turkey bacon to wrap around the chicken.  There isn't a need to broil it if you go this route, which might make the chicken too dry.  Even the picky 5 and 8 year old ate it!

So Yummy! I made these last week and cant wait to make them again. I added rice to the baking dish and let it soak up all the juices. I used fresh spinch because I didnt have frozen. I also used half the amount of mayo and the other half low-fat sour cream. It was perfect. Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious - I stuffed the chicken with fresh spinach, sundried tomato pesto, and laughing cow swiss cheese (light). Then cooked stove top with 3/4 cup of chicken broth and 1 cup of mushrooms with a squeeze of lemon. About 10-12 minutes. So delicious, tender, and flavorful.

Instead of stuffing the chicken I cut it up into smaller pieces and then just place the spinach & cheese mixture on top & finally the bacon. I usually cut the bacon up too because our six kids all want some. If bacon is not cooked enough for your liking, just broil for a few minutes at the end.  Sometimes I have to drain some of the juices off at the end depending on the spinach and bacon I am using.   No big deal, just tip slightly over the sink.  It is so easy and so good-- I love when the kids actually want to eat spinach :).  Perfect for a pot luck too when cut up instead of stuffing the breasts. I always come home with an empty dish.

I started by marinading the chicken breasts in a greek dressing for a couple of hours.  I didn't butterfly the breasts, but created a pocket in which to place the stuffing.  This way it bakes into the chicken and doesn't ooze out the sides.  To the filling, I added 1/4 tsp. fresh ground pepper, chopped sun-dried tomatoes, added a bit more feta and about 1 T. of chopped greek oregano to the rest of the ingredients but omitted the bacon all together. I baked them in the oven as I didn't want the grill flavor.  At the end of the cooking cycle, I placed a couple teaspoons of chopped greek olives then let them sit in the oven for about 5 more minutes.

This recipe is outsatnding!  I have served it to dinner guests several times and received rave reviews.  I add 1/2 c. chopped sauted onions and chopped portobello mushrooms to the spinach mixture.  I cook the chicken slightly on the outside in a skillet.  This makes it MUCH easier to fillet. I also slightly cook the bacon which makes it easier to wrap around the chicken.  My family would eat this every week if I would make it that often!

An easy, tasty weeknight recipe.  I had to make it without bacon and it was still good.  Next time I will try some variations like adding fresh basil, tomatoes, and maybe a little sprinkling of breadcrumbs on the chicken.

This recipe was tricky in that the men in my house loved it, but the ladies aren't a big fan of feta. I think next time I'll try using mozza instead of feta, but overall, it was good! I also, after reading reviews, marinated the chicken in an oregano/ garlic/ lemon juice blend.. gave the chicken a very nice kick. Everyone I've made this for has loved it!

I've been making almost this exact recipe minus the mayonaise, and I sprinkle fresh ground pepper and sea salt on the chicken before I stuff it. I also skip the bacon part, too fattening.

I followed this for the stuffing, but drizzled the stuffed breasts with fresh ground black pepper, garlic, olive oil and fresh lemon juice then baked.

I really didn't care for this recipe.  The mayo just seemed really overwhelming-and this is coming from someone who is a big fan of the stuff.  Unfortunately I will not be making this again.

Very tasty with a unique flavor.  I used canned spinach and it worked okay, but probably would have been even better with the frozen, as the recipe suggests.  I'll definitely make this again.

I liked this recipe but found the chicken a little dry.  I did not have mayo so I used tziki sauce and found it gave this a nice greek flavor.  I had trouble keeping the stuffing from oozing out, there was more stuffing than chicken so I used it in a pasta dish with the dinner.  This turned out well, I would buy fresh chicken breasts that are large in order to stuff these better and would keep an eye on the cooking time to improve the result.  I would make this again though.

Wow - this recipe is wonderful. For my filling mixture, I omitted the mayonnaise and added chopped sun-dried tomatoes - the green and red created a very vibrant and pretty filling. I used one egg white to hold the mixture together. Other than that, I didn't change the recipe. The chicken was a bit dry but I suppose baking in the oven will do that - next time, I will spoon some of the pan drippings over the chicken prior to serving. This would be a perfect main dish to serve for guests - the texture, color, and flavor are all wonderful. This recipe could be so flexible, too - create whatever filling you can think of, and I'm sure it would be delicious!

This is one of our top All Recipes and we eat it at least once a month.  I use 1/4 cup mayo because I personally don't like mayo.  You can also substitute turkey bacon to reduce calories/fat--the regular bacon is a lot better.  Thanks for a great recipe.

VERY good! I gave this a 4 because the 2nd time I made this, I made a few changes that tasted much better. Instead of mayo I used sour cream. I also didnt wrap the chicken with anything. It was much less greasy this way, and you could really taste the flavors from the feta and spinach rather than only the bacon flavor. Was very easy, and definitely impressed my guests. I will make this many more times!

This is a fantastic dish! To remove unwanted excess grease, first boil the bacon for 5 min. or so before wrapping the chicken. It will cook all the way through in the oven and be much less greasy!

As always, I made this as written when I first tried it. It was absolutely delicious and has become a favorite of my family's. The only change I've made so far is to cook the bacon first until it is "rubbery" and browned a bit. Otherwise, it comes out almost raw which is not only unhealthy, but unpleasant to look & very unappetizing.

I was expecting better.  The presentation was nice but taste-wise it was pretty bland.  Definitely season the chicken first, and still it needs something.  The bacon really should be cooked ahead of time, or I liked someone else's suggestion of broiling it the last few minutes to crisp up the bacon.  Probably won't make again, at least not as-is.

I usually complain when people modify a recipe & then leave bad feedback when it doesn't turn out "right"...  I admit, I modified this recipe a bit, but it turned out fabulous, and since the original recipe was the framework for it, I give this recipe 5 stars!!! I used fresh cut swiss chard instead of spinach (removed the stalk, and steamed it in a bit of water, then added butter & lemon juice to taste). Then I added minced sun dried tomato slices, chopped onions, kosher salt, fresh basil, & fresh ground pepper; along with the mayo, feta, and garlic. Used ~ 1/8 cup of lemon juice + ~ 1/4 cup of olive oil, and 1/8 tsp of dried oregano to pour over chicken before baking. Also lightly browned the chicken before stuffing. I Used bone in chicken breast & just stuffed the natural pocket adjacent to the bone, and wrapped it in prosciutto.  AMAZING.  A huge hit at the table, and a definite keeper.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Did not like this at all.  Found the chicken to be dry, bacon definitely needs to be cooked somewhat before baking as was raw when chicken was done.  I love garlic, but didn't find it suiting in this recipe at all.  Very bland.  Will not make again, unfortunetly.

This recipe is Great, so moist and delicious! I marinated the chicken in Lawry's garlic and herb for two hours. I also used fresh spinach instead of frozen and wrapped it in turkey bacon to cut down on the fat. I honestly think that I liked this version better than the original. Yes, I've made it before too :oP  I cooked it at 350 for 40 minutes and it was perfect. So easy to make and yet so elegant!!

Very flavorful and my husband said it definately deserved 5 stars!  We try to cook as healthy as possible, so I left out the bacon as we didn't have any anyhow.  I did use regular mayo but used a little less and added sour cream to it.  I sauteed onions, garlic and spinach in evoo and added it to the feta cheese mixture.  I did use what the others recommended with the evoo, lemon juice, and oregano.  Next time I would leave out the oregano, or use a little less than the teaspoon it calls for. I made sure to baste the chicken after about 10-15 minutes just to moisten the chicken.  The chicken was so moist!  My 4 year old, 17 month old, hubby, and I devoured it all!  We loved it!

Ah, now this was delicious! I cut out the mayo, and used porscutto instead of bacon. Granted, I had to use string to hold 'em together while in the oven. I took Linda W. advice of basting it with the lemon/olive oil/oregano mixture, and tosses some thyme into the feta/spinach mix.
Served with spiced rice and tzatziki, and my dinner guests where thrilled. Thumbs up! Thanks for sharing!

My family loved it!  I changed a couple of things.  I didn't have spinach soleft it out and didn't have a lot of time so I baked it uncovered at 425 for 25 minutes and it was perfect!  The chicken was juicy and bacon was crispy!  Thanks for this great recipe!

The stuffing was really good but I over-cooked the chicken trying to get it to "brown-up". Next time I'm going to keep with the recommended cooking time, subtract 3 minutes and then put the chicken under the broiler for 3 minutes.

this was my 2nd time making it. i added onions to the spinach mix, and substituted miracle whip for mayo. used fresh spinach as well. i used turkey bacon for the top and i don't think it came out as crunchy as i would have liked. i agree with others though- the chicken on the outside was rather dry so next time i'll brush some olive oil or add a few more herbs. regardless, my husband still likes this recipe a lot.

I thought this was delicious. Even my boyfriend, who is not a cooked spinach fan enjoyed his. I made one with a breast and one with a thigh, and I found the thigh to be much more tender and flavorful. It really soaked up more of the flavor.

A pleasant change from a normal chicken breast.
I made a few substitutions, to cut a few calories. I only used about 1 tbsp of mayonaise. I also added about 2 tbsp of greek salad dressing. I mixed the mayonaise, salad dressing, sliced fresh spinach, feta and garlic in a bowl. I ommited the bacon all together. I sliced large pockets into each breast (I did 2) and stuffed them with the mixture. I seasoned the outside of the breasts with S&P and a shot of PAM spray (so it would brown a bit). Served with Penne, in a sundried tomato alfredo sauce and roasted brussel sprouts. Yum!

Great chicken...I took the suggestions of not using the bacon. I coated lightly with flour and browned in EVOO and butter and then baked.

This was tasty (I made it without the bacon), but the chicken dried out too much while cooking.

This was a very tasty change from plain old chicken breast.  It stayed moist and the flavors meshed together excellently.  My 12-yr-old daughter kept saying, "I don't like it--I LOVE it!"  Everyone kept asking for more!  I did cook the bacon for a few minutes per some other reviewers.  I didn't think the chicken was very greasy at all.  I used fresh grated parm cheese (had no feta) and as large as my chicken breasts were, I would've liked to wrap 2 pieces of bacon around each.  I did add some spices (Adobo and cracked pepper & herb) to the chicken before I stuffed them.  This is a fantastic recipe--I can't wait to make it for friends!

This was very good. Not my fave- but everyone at my dinner party loved it. I didn't have bacon- and I think it would have been better if I had. Oh well- I'll try it again.

After hitting 40 I've decided to start cooking.  Slowly we're getting the hang of it, getting my wife and kids to sit at the dinner table instead of heading for the car to eat out.  This dish was a huge hit, we loved it!!

Yummy! I used lite mayo to cut the calories and instead of bacon I brushed on EVOO and lightly coated with ground panko. Also I used fresh wilted spinach. Very nice meal, my hubby says it would be good enough for company :-)

This recipe was great! Not too hard to make. I wrapped each of the chicken breasts in two slices of bacon. Baked for about 35 min then turned on broiler for about 5min. I didn't seem to have the same problem with the bacon not getting crispy like others did. Served with garlic mashed potatoes and strawberries. YUM! Even my 4 yr old LOVED it. She ate 1 1/2 pieces of chicken!

I prepared this recipe last week for my grown daughter.  I substituted Cheddar for feta. Also, I breaded the breast. We both loved it! I asked her what, if anything, she would have added. she said, "bacon". Then, it clicked in my mind that I had forgotten to wrap the chicken breasts! I am preparing it again tomorrow night with the bacon and feta cheese. Looking forward to it!

Very good.  I only had 3 chicken breasts but made the whole batch of stuffing and REALLY stuffed the breasts.  One hour cooking time might be a little much because the chicken was slightly overdone for my taste but then again it depends on the size of the breasts and amount of stuffing.  Monitor for desired doneness.

I followed the recipe and found that the bacon was a bit too greasy, as noted by another reviewer.  The flavor was great, however, in the future I will cook the bacon first and add it too the spinach and feta mixture so cut down on the grease.

This was delicious.  I followed some other suggestions and left off the bacon and sauteed the chicken before putting it in the oven.  I also drizzled the chicken with olive oil, lemon juice, garlic powder and pepper.  My husband loved it.

My family thoroughly enjoyed this recipe. I forgot to buy frozen spinach so I broke up fresh spinach leaves which worked very well.  I pounded the chicken thin, browned it on both sides & baked it for 30 min at 400.  My daughter devoured it!  This one's a keeper.

Made the recipe as written- cooked it covered for about 30 minutes - 350 degree oven - and then uncovered the pan and turned on the broiler for about 5 minutes on each side - we loved it - instead of closing the chicken with toothpicks, I used twine and tied each piece- held together very nicely.

The filling was amazing. I used the previously suggested mayo sour cream combo and threw in some chopped vidalia onions. I also used thin sliced chicken breasts and turkey bacon. Absolutely delicious!

These are wonderful.  My 4 yr old requests this all the time so you know its good.  I don't use the mayo though.  I use 1/2 sourcream and 1/2 crema cheese and keep everything else the same.  I cook is covered for 30 min, uncovered for about 10-15 min, and then I broil for about 5-7 min to make the bacon a little more crispy.  This def a keeper.

This was a great recipe and really easy. I modified mine a little though. I did do the bacon to make it a little healthier. I used fresh organic spinach sauteeing it first with garlic and olive oil. For the stuffing, I used mostly sour cream and some mayo. I also brushed the chicken with olive oil, garlic, and misc. seasonings as well as putting fresh lemon juice on top of chicken.

Made this as directed, but only had half the frozen spinach on hand, so only included this. Also, didn't have any bacon on hand, so wrapped each chicken breast in a slice of prosciutto instead -- I think this probably made it a little less greasy? Anyway, we all loved it and will definitely make it again!

Easy and tasty. I added a sauce of olive oil, lemon juice, garlic and oregano per a revewier's suggestion. Also, I cooked it for 20 minutes, sliced each breast in 1 inch segments and put back in the oven for 10 minutes.  This helped to make it more presentable. And I didn't use bacon because we were out but I think that would add to the flavor.

This was an excellent recipe! I also made some modifications for a healthier and low calorie meal. I substituted Miracle Whip for the mayo and also used turkey bacon, suggested by another member. I added 1/2 cup onion and the tsp of egg beater to the mixture. I love onion and garlic, sprinkling onion and garlic powder on the outside of the chicken added extra flavor. I also covered the chicken in foil and baked for 30 mins. BTW I served with 1 1/2 cup of broccoli and summer squash, making the total calories for 1 serving a low 488!

Awesome recipe...made a few minor changes.  I used fresh spinach that I sauted with a little garlic.  Used cooked chopped bacon with the feta and mayo mixture.  I also browned the chicken after it was stuffed before putting it into the oven.

This chicken was so moist and tasty. I made a few changes. I marinated the chicken over night in italian dressing. To make the filling, I used half mayo and half sour cream. And I did not wrap in bacon. I wanted to make it more figure friendly. It was a great chicken dish that I will make again.

My Husband loved this recipe.... next time I'm going to use a little less spinach and maybe add some onion and cheese (perhaps Gouda?). Thanks!

I didn't use bacon to wrap the chicken and it tasted great! Perhaps I'll use a little more spinach and less mayo next time though.

I made this for my husband, who very rarely raves about anything I make, and he loved it!!  The only thing I did differently was that I used up the whole package of bacon by completely wrapping the chikcen breasts in the bacon...not exactly HeartSmart, but it sure was good!

I made this last night with Zippy Zucchini and Gourmet Mushroom Risotto.  My 15 year old only liked the chicken but my husband loved the whole dinner.  It was very easy to make also.

I made this chicken last night and thought it was amazing.  I used mozzarella instead of feta because the person I was cooking for is not a fan of feta.  I did the same thing as other reviewers suggested and baked the chicken for 25mins then broiled for an additional 5.  Also, I poured a lemon, oregano, evoo mix over the chicken as it baked for additional flavor.  The bacon turned out crispy and the chicken was perfect.  This is an A+ recipe.  When I make this again I will try feta because I think that would give the chicken even more flavor.

I added mushrooms to the mix, and since I only had raw spinich on hand, I used that and sauteed it up with the mushrooms. Next time I will use less butter in the sauteeing process, since it is already pretty greasy from the bacon.  I also added oregano to the mixture.  It was a hit in the house.

I altered this for a healthier version; omitted the bacon, used light mayo.  I also did not have fresh garlic so used about 1 tsp. of garlic powder.  The feta cheese I used was seasoned with tomato and basil.  This was very good, I will probably try it as the recipe is written next time and use the bacon.  Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

Not too bad... the bacon taste is pretty strong, but in my opinion it needs more flavour inside. Next time I'll listen to the reviewers and add some lemon, and maybe substitute some of the mayo with cream cheese or sour cream.

This was an excellent dish! I made it for my parents and then for some friends, everyone loved it!  I served it with a salad, stuffed mushrooms and garlic bread!  It was a lot of food, so the uneaten chicken breasts were saved and cut up on a salad the next day!  Delicious!

This was just so-so.  I only had fat free mayo, but otherwise made it exactly as written.  It was okay, but as my husband said, if he had ordered it in a restuarant, he would have eaten it, but not ordered it again.  Don't know what it was missing, unless the mayo would make that much difference.

Good mix of flavors. I found it a little salty due to the bacon and feta, but still very tasty. It helped to serve it with plain pasta to mellow the flavor. My husband and kids liked it too.

This was great.  With two kids running around I forgot to add the bacon and it still came out great.  I pounded the chicken breasts so it would cook quicker, and made a sauce with the juices.  I will definitely make this again.

LOVE IT!  With 15 minutes left for the chicken to cook, I took it out of the oven & topped it with a couple of sundried tomatoes & a little bit of parmesean cheese, then put it back in the oven.  It was simply divine & my husband loved it!

Very, very good.  I added 1/2 cup of bread crumbs and 1/4 cup of chopped onion.  I crumbled the bacon into the stuffing rather than wrapping it.  I've made this twice already and get rave reviews each time.  Thank you Laurie for this recipe.

Everything was perfect....I cut too far into the breast so I used 3 pieces of bacon per breast.  I also aded some diced tomatoes to the stuffing and used sun dried tomato and basil feta.  Came out perfect.

This recipe was really good. I didn't have the bacon, so I just ommitted it. After baking the chicken, I added cooked rice to it to soak up the "juices" and any cheese filling that leaked out. Really good!

I tried this recipe going off of the other great reviews that it had and I only have to agree with one person below, it was gross.  It was very bland and did not thrill anyone in my family, I will not make it again.

My family LOVES this recipe!  I sprinkle "steak seasoning" on top, to give a little boost in flavors.  Otherwise, the recipe is very yummy. It is easily made several hours in advance.

A decent entree. I substituted 2 tbsp of roasted red pepper spread for the mayo and it turned out quite well. I adhered to the recommendations on the other views (35 min at 400* and 3-5 min/side on broil) and the chicken was not too dry. My only complaint was that it was a bit bland.

I made this delicious dish and it was a big hit with my husband.  The only thing was that the bacon didnt crisp enough.  Next time i would cook beforehand and crumple it up in the mixture.  There was a lot of filling left over so my husband brought it to work and kept raving to his buddies how much he loved this recipe.  I made this dish 4 days ago and he is still talking about this dish.  I will definately make this dish again.

I only had the 8 thin sliced chicken breasts too thin to butterfly so I spread the spinach mixture out and placed it in the middle of the chicken breast.  Then I rolled the chicken breast and bacon around it and tied each breast with twine to hold it together.  It came out perfect!  This is a dish I would make for company.

Presentation is beautiful. As is, I would rate the recipe 'OK' only because the chicken can end up dry, and the chicken to stuffing ratio is not balanced. Next time I'll try to scoop out the middle of the chicken breast so more of the stuffing can go in, and cook it for less time so its not dry.

Sooooo Yummy!  I just found this recipe last week and have made it 2 times.  My husband loves it!  I made a few adjustments.  Instead of wrapping the chicken in bacon, I cooked the bacon and crumbled it and put it in the spinach mixture.  I also added sun-dried tomatoes and chopped toasted pinenuts (the pinenuts made the dish AMAZING).  And I seasoned the outside of the chicken with an italian parmesian seasoning.  I also like to cook my chicken faster which makes it more moist, so I cooked it at 400 for 30mion.  I plan to make this at my next dinner party.  And I NEVER make chicken at dinner parties because it is usually too boring... but not this time!!!-------------------------------------------------
*It is now a week after writing this review and I plan to cook it again tonight!!!*---------------------------------------------------------
OMG - I added toasted pinenuts and got rid of the green onions I had added before and it made it PERFECT!!!  I made it for a friend who had just had surgery and they both loved it too!

This is a recipe you can play with and modify to your liking. I like spices and flavor so I had to add a marination base to it. I stuffed the 3 peices of chicken breast with the feta/mayo/spinach mixture. Then i made a home made dressing (2 tblspn of olive oil, 1 tblspn lemon juice, 2 tspn oregano, 1 tspn lemon pepper, salt and pepper to taste) once i mixed all these ingredients i coated all sides of chicken in this mixture. Then wrapped the bacon around the chicken (2 slices per chicken) secured it with the tooth pick and baked it. The juices from the chicken and the oil/lemon base gave the chicken a zesty flavor and was not dry. I served with roasted potatoes and brocolli.

Pretty darn good and looks impressive. I used skinless, boneless chicken thighs and pounded them thin. I heeded the advice of others and didn't use the mayo and added lots of feta.  I used fresh spinach, just wilted it a bit in the microwave. This was easy to prepare and smelled great.  There was ALOT of fat from the bacon - I spooned it out periodicaly while baking. The only thing I might add next time is a kick of lemon - I think this dish would bennifit from either marinating the chicken in lemon or adding some lemon zest to the stuffing - will try next time!  Thanks for the recipie.

Fabulous. My whole family loved it. I popounded the breasts until they were thin instead of butterflying them. I substituted a scant teaspoon of olive oil for the mayo to reduce the fat. For the grownups, I added sauteed mushrooms to the spinach and cheese mixture. Delicious!!

This was pretty good although I did change it a bit. I only used 2/3 of the mayo and I used cream cheese instead of feta. I aded about 1/4 cup bread crumbs also. It came out pretty good, my husband said he liked it, but next time I'l cover it until the last 15-20 minutes so that it stays moister.

WoW! Excellent recipe...tho I had to change things up a tad.  I did this recipe tonight for dinner but only had about a half a pkg of leftover spinach which I mixed with the mayo, and garlic, then I threw in a 1/4 cup of italian flavored breadcrumbs and 1/2 a cup of Italian cheese blend and a few shakes of parmesan[I didn't have any feta]  I stuffed the breasts and laid the strips of bacon atop them.  WoW...were they ever awesome! This is one of my new favorite chicken recipes.  The whole gang LOVED it!

I thought this was good.. Very nice presentation. However, my husband didn't like it so much and asked me not to make it again. Anyway, for a tip for those interested in trying it, after I butterflied the chicken, I laid it open and pounded it thin (in between platic wrap) for a more even thickness and so that I had more to roll. Maybe I can try it one more time substituting the mayo with cream cheese, as others suggested.

Great tasting and easy to prepare.  Skipped the garlic clove. Basted each chicken breast with Italian salad dressing before wrapping it with bacon for extra flavor on the outside as well.

This entree is simply perfect for the single man to serve to his lady friends.  Its easy, tasty, and goes great with instant garlic mash potatoes and Barefoot Chardonnay.  I varied it up a bit by first cooking 4 slices of bacon to well crisp and crushing it up to add to the stuffing.  Secondly, like others I used half sour cream, half mayo and used blue cheese instead of feta.  Oh yeah, I also used 2 slices of bacon per breast and the lemon juice, olive oil, crushed garlic and oregano mixture spooned over every 15 minutes to keep the chicken juicy.  I had to go find the proportions for the mixture, so I will add them here for others to view if they want...

16 T olive oil
4 t lemon juice
8 cloves crushed garlic
2 T dried oregano

One other thing I found out is that this recipe didn’t hold well for leftovers.  Cook on!!!

i took this recipe and altered it b/c my husband is not a big fan of feta cheese. I chopped a small onion, 4 cloves of garlic, and a can of artichoke hearts, cooked that down with the spinach and added about 4 ounces of cream cheese, a teaspoon of sour cream,and a teaspoon of miracle whip. i stuffed that in the chicken breasts and seasoned the breasts with creole seasoning and cayenne pepper. YUMMY!! will make this one again soon.

WOW!!!  I used a mixture of mayo and sour cream instead of just mayo and substituted mozerella for the feta.  (I love feta cheese, but my husband hates it).  It turned out absolutely incredible.  My husband could not stop raving about it!!!

I took the cover off near the end of the cooking time and increased the oven temp to get the bacon a little crisper. I probably would use less mayo next time.
This went over well with my family.

My family loves this recipe. I do  not have the time to stuff the chicken so I just layer it.  First the chicken then the spinach mix and then the bacon.   I use more bacon so everyone gets at least one piece. So quick & easy.

Do not make this dish - it was horrible! The chicken was so dry (and i cut the time back to 45 min) and rubbery and the filling was bland.  The bacon didn't cook properly on the bottom (i crisped the top by broiling for the last 5 min like one reviewer suggested) and the whole meal was a bust.

I've made this twice, both times tweaking things just a bit.  I used Miracle Whip instead of mayo because I read it in another review.  The second time I made it I put in a little too much so I tasted it, but everyone else, including my 5 yo absolutely loved it.  Mozzarella cheese works just as well as feta, too!

OH MY!!!  This has been the best recipe that I have tried from this website.  I only had 1/3 of a cup of tomato-basil feta, so I added grated parmasean to make up the difference.  I also pounded my chicken breasts into cutlets, rolled the spinach inside and wrapped the bacon around them securing with a toothpick.  AWESOME!

I used this recipe as a reference to make something unique.  I had made a homemade spinach and artichoke dip that was to die for.  I had some leftover and decided to stuff it in some chicken.  So I followed this recipe except stuffed it with the creamy spinach and artichoke mixture instead of the feta spinach.  This was unreal!  My husband was in heaven.  I will def. make this again and again...but with the spinach artichoke dip spooned in as we are not fans of feta cheese.  I think this is a great recipe to follow to stuff chicken with whatever you have on hand, or just to suit your preference. Thanks so much for a great way to make chicken!

Great recipe! I loved it the way it is but my hubby's not a spinach lover so I replaced 2 of the breasts with green olives instead of spinach.  He loved it! I may try it with mozzarella cheese next time to see how that'll taste.

Very good! So easy to make it's an excellent choice for dinner parties. However, I used tomato and basil feta and thought that the amount was a little overpowering (my husband thought it to be perfect). Next time will try using slightly less. I did pour a small amount of olive oil and lemon juice over the top as suggested by others and the chicken turned out super moist! Will definitely make again!

I was really impressed with the presentation!  Very pretty!  However, my husband does not like spinach and scrapped all the inside out.  (I don't even think he tried it)  So, I will probably not make this again, but I would reccomend it to you to try it!

My husband and I both loved this.  I used garlic salt rather than just garlic, and I think next time I will add more feta cheese.

Taste is great. Having no feta, I substituted extra sharp cheddar and cream cheese,turned out great. Next time will try feta.Thanks Laura!

loved it. Read the reviews and cooked it uncovered and then put it on convection for the last 20 minutes. I also had really large chicken breasts so I used about 3 slices of bacon on each. I did add salt and pepper to the stuffing, may add additional seasoning next time to really give it some wow. It tuned out awesome for a first run. Juicy chicken, the bacon was only a little crisp on the edges, but that happens when you use it to wrap something. I used fresh baby spinach, since it's what I had on hand. It was a big hit in our house will be making this again.

It’s a keeper!  This will definitely be in my rotation because I always have all of the ingredients on hand. Other than using fresh spinach and tossing in a handful of chopped fresh mushrooms to the mix, I made it as written. The flavor combo is fantastic!

This was delicious. The only thing I did differently is that I used fresh spinach since I didn’t have frozen. I usually experience chicken breasts as dry but this was not. Will definitely make this again

My family thoroughly enjoyed this recipe. I added chopped onion and mushroom to stuffing - sauté with garlic before adding to mixture. I precooked the bacon halfway in the microwave to cut down on the grease, and ensure it was crispy. I also added 2 tsp olive oil, 2 tsp lemon juice and 1 tsp oregano to drizzle over the chicken prior to baking. I only had thin sliced chicken breasts on hand, so I layered the stuffing between two slices, and baked on a cooling rack placed on a foil lined baking sheet to prevent the chicken from sitting in the drippings. Served with a side of mashed potatoes. Very tasty!

Loved the recipe as is, but after I made it the first time, each successive time I've made this recipe I have added provolone on top of the spinach inside the chicken, used 2 pieces of bacon to wrap each piece of chicken. After I take it out of the oven I add more provolone on top of the chicken to melt while the chicken is hot. What can I say? I love cheese!

Yummy, however the bacon melts and boils which makes it bake faster. Maybe  bake 40 minutes instead.

Made this with Gouda cheese since I'm the only one in the family who likes Feta. Family loved it, but it is very rich that my husband and I actually split a chicken breast. Bacon needs to be cooked a little bit before being put in the oven.

I made this recipe last night for me and my husband  It  was a success!
     I used prosciutto in the filling instead of bacon on the outside as one reviewer suggested. 
     I  pounded the chicken flat so it was a uniform thickness  that made easier to cook and to work with. I then browned both sides in my trusty cast iron skillet. Then I took it out to stuff and put it back it the pan and cooked it for 45 minutes at 375°.

This dish is fantastic! I added an extra clove of garlic and 2 large baby portobello mushrooms chopped to the mixture. I wrapped the chicken breasts with 2 strips of Applewood smoked bacon and I cooked the chicken for 50 minutes instead of 1hr. It turned out perfect! This recipe was so good that my family has requested that I cook several times a month to make them happy!

Excellent. I uncovered the last 30 minutes and the bacon crisped up and chicken got some color. I would cook about 15 less next time.

This is one of my family's favorite stuffed chicken meals. We always use more feta and bacon. Also recommend to broil for a while to crisp the bacon.

I just made this recipe. I used the original directions, except with my stuffing I sautéed diced onions and chopped garlic. Used feta cheese and Parmesan/ Romano cheese. I sprinkled season salt, garlic powder, and black pepper on the fillets and browned them in a warm skillet for about 30 seconds on each side. Stuffed the chicken and wrapped with prosciutto. Used toothpicks to hold it together cover with foil and baked for an hour!!! AMAZING!!! I will make this again, for sure.

Delicious! I got brave and changed up a few things. Didn’t use bacon but brushed breasts with the olive oil and oregano mix that was suggested and because it was a bit watery I sprinkled panko bread crumbs on it and into the spinach mix and at the end I broiled the tops!

This is a wonderful recipe and we just loved it.  Only made two changes.  I used monterey  jack cheese  and I wrapped the entire breast in bacon.  I baked it at 350 for 45 minutes covered, and the last 15 uncovered and turned the oven up to 400.  The bacon browned beautifully and the chicken was moist and very good.  Will be a regular meal in our house.  Thanks Laurie.

I made this tonight but as I always do I added my own personal touches.  Regular mayo seemed a little boring so I went with a Chipotle mayo, to that I added the spinach, bacon, sun dried tomoato, mushroom, some finely chopped onion, Mild cheddar cheese (Don't like Feta) and extra garlic.  I also bought baby broccoli spears and into each breast I first added 1 or 2 whole broccoli spears and then I packed as much filling as I could in and used butchers twine to try and close. it.  I fired up my smoker and cooked them in the smoker for about 50 minutes at 300 and what a treat.  One added note I used 1/2 of the spinach and still had a ton of leftover stuffing, but that was not a bad thing as it was delicious to eat right out of the bowl!

Precook bacon slightly so gets crispy. 30 min covered an 30 uncovered. Use less mayo next time. Used 6 boneless chicken thighs. Delish

FYI:  1 hour is waaay too long for baking. Done in 40 min., unless you want dry chicken. For the stuffing, I sautéed spinach leaves with sundried tomatoes, then melted garden vegetable cream cheese spread, instead of feta cheese. Basted the chicken with olive oil, oregano and lemon pepper, then wrapping with bacon. Pretty darn tasty.

Great recipe! I used feta with craisin and added a few extra. Great flavor medley! I broiled the chicken for the last few minutes to crisp up the bacon.  It looked as good as it tasted so I will have to get a picture next time.

I was looking for something different to make and this wasn't difficult to prep and cook. Make sure your spinach properly thawed and drained as the excess juice makes your bacon not crispy.

This recipe was a HIT!  I did make a few changes.  6 hours before cooking, I split the breast, covered the breast with Zesty Italian Dressing, generously added Italian Seasoning and additional crushed Rosemary.  Then, I placed the breast in a zip lock bag, added an additional 3/4 cup of Zesty Italian Dressing.  Sealed and refrigerated for 6 hours.     To the stuffing mix I added 3/4 cup of chopped Black Olives and 1 small jar of chopped pimentos, drained, and 1 complete bulb of fresh, minced Garlic.     As you will see in the picture, this was a very large breast that fed two of us.  I did use the additional stuffing mix as a “bed” that also served as an additional vegetable since we are vegetable lovers.    The squash and Carrots were both fresh and steamed.     I will do this one, again, soon!

I wanted to make this exactly as written, but only had 2 chicken breasts for 3 people.  so I got creative.  What I did was slice the 2 breasts into medallions and lined a glass baking dish with them.  Then I mixed mayo with the juice of a whole lemon, the oregano, salt and pepper and spooned it over the chicken.  

I then sliced 1/2 pound of bacon and browned it with 6, yes 6, minced garlic cloves.  Once the bacon was cooked and the garlic started to brown, I threw in a bunch of fresh spinach and cooked until the spinach wilted. I spooned this over the chicken, including the juices.  On top of that, I crumbled 8 ounces of feta.  Baked covered at 400 for 45 minutes, then uncovered and broiled for 5.  

When my finicky teenager took a bite, his reaction was, oh...hmm...wow...mmmm.  Can't get any better than that.

We used green onion and cream cheese for the filling for the chicken breasts and wrapped them in bacon. Yummy alternative way to use up what we had on hand without a trip to the store.

My family loved this recipe.  I did not have chicken breasts so I made it with chicken tenders and covered the tenders with the stuffing.  Due to dietary restrictions we do not eat bacon  so we did not miss the taste. The filling kept the meat moist and the flavor was excellent. Just make sure the filling totally covers the meat so it doesn’t dry out.

The changes I made to the original recipe were that I added about 1 Tablespoon of lemon juice and a healthy pinch of dried oregano to the stuffing.  The chicken breasts I used were small and I found that using meat scissors to butterfly them made the job a lot neater!  After cooking as instructed I uncovered the breasts and cooked for an additional  few minutes to give color to the chicken and bacon. Thanks to Laurie for an excellent and easy recipe!

Soooo good!  HUGE hit with my boyfriend and me!  Made almost exactly as described, with the exception of using fresh spinach in place of frozen... I sauteed a bag of spinach (for 2 breasts) with a little olive oil, garlic, salt, pepper and onion powder, and drained it).  I used 3 pcs of bacon to wrap the chicken, as they were rather large... I uncovered the last 15 mins, to help cook the bacon a little more. It was tender and FULL of flavor! Absolutely delicious! Will definitely be a regular meal for us!

I enjoy this recipe, as does my family. I altered the recipe a little.  I did not use feta cheese.  We prefer an Italian blend, Kraft.  I also add an Italian blend of seasonings from McCormick in addition to minced garlic. I did not use frozen spinach.  I used fresh baby spinach.  I followed the recipe according to cooking instructions, as well.  We do not like crisp bacon on this (we tried it both ways), so the cooking time worked perfectly.I also placed the stuffed chicken on a baking rack set in a cookie sheet.  This reduces the the dripping from the bacon sitting on the cheese and chicken.  Superb recipe!!

Terrific!! Had a little bit extra filling and it made a great dip!! Going to try it with some chopped water chestnuts in the stuffing next time for a little crunch.

Just one quick change. Since, the the original recipe does not mention a particular bacon. I used turkey bacon. And, did not add any salt. Everybody loved it! Awesome recipe guy! Thanks a bunch!

I used goat cheese instead of feta because my husband prefers a less bitey cheese.  Instead of wrapping bacon around the breast, I cut the strips in half and laid three half-strips over the top of each breast.  The bacon wasn't as done as we prefer so I used the broiler (2nd rack away) for a few more minutes until the bacon was perfectly done.  I used two large chicken breasts (halved the filling recipe) and it made enough that we split one breast.  The remaining breast we'll split and have two delicious work lunches!

I made this recipe without bacon to reduce the sodium. and  substituting the mayo with olive oil. I topped 
it with alfredo sauce. It was very good.

I didn't mind it, but my husband did not like the overwhelming 'spinach' taste.  Not sure if I will try it again.  If I do, I will try using less spinach or opt for fresh spinach.

This recipe is delicious just the way it is written.  It is also the foundation of many other flavor profiles.  So many of the reviewers had excellent ideas.  Even I changed mine up when I made it a second time.  But i am giving 5 stars to the original recipe

We made this a few days ago and it was DELICIOUS!  We used fresh spinach instead and added black pepper and a dollop of sour cream to the mixture. We also cooked the bacon egg n the microwave for about a minute and then crisped the cooked chicken in a pan. Definitely will make it again!

This is a very tasty dish. I used prosciutto instead of bacon and basted it with ghee and uncovered it for the last 25 minutes to make it crispy. I also used pounded thighs instead of breasts. My family loves it! We will have this again for sure.

The chicken breasts I used were very big (about 2/3 lb. per breast), but the recipe still worked and my husband and I shared a breast each for a meal.  I would add the instruction to remove the foil covering the dish about 10-15 minutes before chicken is done so bacon can cook more thoroughly.

My family liked it. I would just change a couple things-  1st I would put the chicken breasts on a rack so the chicken isn’t laying in its juices. 2nd, the last 15 minutes I would remove the lid/foil so the bacon would crisp up.

Really liked this recipe except I found 1 hour the chicken was dry.  I will definitely try again, this time pulling it out at 45 min and checking for doneness.

We made this according to the recipe but added a few red pepper flakes and salt & pepper, and additional garlic.  We wrapped each breast with one very meaty piece of bacon and was careful not to over bake.  However, the breasts seemed somewhat dry.  The next time we will use Swiss cheese or perhaps blue cheese.  The feta lacked flavor to our taste.  I know we can improve on this recipe.

The cooking time you wrote down is 1 hour but I think irt was too much so it looks it’s juices. It was  very dry.  The flavor was very good. 
I did not use feta cheese but Parmesan.

Flavor was a bit on the bland side.  Think next time I make it I'll remove the foil partway through the oven time in order to get the bacon a bit crispy.

This is a great recipe.  The only change I made was to quick brown the outside of the chicken breast then I stuffed and wrapped the bacon.  Also, I didn't cover with aluminum foil. Came out nice, brown and not dry at all.

This dish came out really good! I did make a lot of changes though. First, I used sour cream instead of mayo (mayo would have thrown off the "Greek" taste IMO), Kraft's Italian cheese mix, and I used garlic powder instead of actual garlic for the spinach filling (I was being cheap... and running out of time). I also cooked the spinach a little bit and seasoned it a little with lemon pepper, Cajun seasoning, Original Mrs. Dash, and garlic powder. I left the bacon out as well (I've been eating too much of it lately, had to cut it out of something!). After that, I followed the instructions to add the spinach drained, mixed in the cheese, cream, and spinach and added some more seasoning to taste. I put the mixture in the fridge while I was cutting the chicken. After cutting, I stuffed the chicken with the filling and seasoned it with the seasonings used in the filling, but this time I added chili powder and a hint of Accent salt to the chicken. I pan seared the chicken (with the filling inside) to my liking (I'm assuming it took about 2-5 minutes on each side?). After that, I followed the rest of the baking instructions. For the sake of time I wasn't able to make the rice used to eat with the chicken, but at least I can do that tomorrow! Also a quick note to everyone: DO NOT BE AFRAID TO USE SEASONINGS OTHER THAN SALT AND PEPPER! You will get SO much more flavor out of your food rather than sticking the to bland S/P all the time!

Made it two different ways.   One without the feta, since I have an allergy to dairy.   Used white rice since it was in frig.  But did it for my mother with feta.  Both were awesome.   Precooked bacon, stuffed it in.  Lemon and oregano on top, just perfect.

I would baste the top of the chicken probably about midway through cooking or when there's about 15-20 minutes left and cook uncovered to get that nice golden brown effect. Otherwise it still turned out good! We'll see what my boyfriend thinks.

This is a keeper.   Simple to make but very flavourful.   As a next time I would cook it 2 minutes less as it was a tad dry.

pretty good.  I found that it needed a bit more seasoning. The suggestion to precook the bacon was very helpful. I will certainly make this again...with perhaps some red pepper flakes in the filling.

I added marinara sauce to the recipe when I baked the chicken.  Topped with Swiss and mozzarella cheeses, it was an amazingly tasteful dish.

This is a super easy and really good chicken dish. I did make some changes however. I used fresh spinach and motzerella cheese instead of feta. I also seasoned the spinach mixture with onion powder, granulated garlic, salt and pepper. Just to taste no actual measurements. I also used 2 piece of bacon per chicken breast and I uncovered the dish for the last 20 minuets of baking to brown the bacon a little.

This came out quite well. I seasoned my chicken , and used Mediterranean feta cheese. I also took the advice of others and used prosciutto.

First of all, I have to say that I didn't have the bacon; when I made this. Nevertheless, it was awesome! I wasn't sure about the feta cheese, since I rarely eat it. Since I didn't have the bacon, I seasoned the outside of the chicken with salt and black pepper. Only on one side.Can't wait to try it again with the bacon. This is a definite keeper!

This was absolutely delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I did broil it  for 7 minutes after baking it for one hour to get the bacon crisp.  

This is definitely a keeper.  I will serve it to company.  This is a 10/10 winner.

I don't know when I have been so disappointed.  The first time I use a recipe I follow it exactly.  This one will not be worth altering and repeating.  The bacon added nothing to the flavor of the chicken, and because it was covered during cooking it looked anemic.  It did not resemble the photo which was supposed to represent it.  It was totally tasteless, especially the chicken.  Yuck is the only way to describe it.  Thank goodness I didn't invite a guest.

I changed from boneless breasts to bone in breasts and made the spinach mixture poured it into the bottom of a 6 qt corning dish.  Topped with breaded chicken breasts and then placed the bacon on top of these. Baked for 1 hour at 350.  It was delicious.

I think it would have been better with cream cheese and spinach! The mayo made the stuffing a little runny, and overpowered the taste of the cheese.

This was a really great recipe.  Another variant of it that I would recommend is to roll them in corn flakes instead of wrapping the chicken in bacon and to use Greek yogurt in place of mayonnaise for a little healthier option.  I also think the filling could use a little bit of pepper..

I made this and honestly did not like it at all. The bacon would not cook I even raised the temp and still wouldn’t cook,it got to the point where I just removed the bacon entirely ($5 down the drain!) there was about a half an inch of grease in the bottom of the pan & on top of it all the flavor was just off idk if it was the mayo and feta mixture but yuck!

Good recipe, no doubt.  But since I changed things, I can’t give it five stars.  I used Gorgonzola cheese; 1/2 mayo, 1/2 plain yogurt; chopped onion in the spinach mixture.  Other reviewers used olive oil, lemon juice, and oregano to brush on top and sides. —-worth doing.   I baked 35 minutes covered, 10 minutes uncovered.    I basted once or twice near end..  Definitely a do-over.

My family liked the stuffing. I made it with broccoli instead of spinach. I did over cook the chicken. It was a bit dry. I did not season the chicken. I followed the recipe. So the chicken did not have any flavor. Next time I will season the chicken and not leave it as long as I did, 45 min. The bacon was undercooked. I will probably not use bacon next time. My dish did not come out as I expected. I definitely will change some things and try to make again just a bit different.

Similarly to other recommendations I limited the mayo and used sour cream and plain greek yogurt as a substitute.  Flattened the chicken and slightly browned it before baking.  Used the aluminum and oven pan with cover to keep it most.  Everyone loved it.

Great recipe. Used thin breasts, won't dip that next time. Baked it at 400 degrees for 30 minutes, then broiled for 10. Should've let it sit for five minutes after broiling, burned my mouth. Added pepper to the stuffing. Chilled  it in the fridge for ten minutes  before the oven. Used herbed feta.

I made this with the thought that the bacon might be a problem. It wasn't. I had to change up spinach for marinated artichoke hearts, but the end result was fantastic. The bacon was perfectly crisped without the chicken drying out or the goodies leaking out into the pan. Next time, I'll be sure to use the spinach.

My husband made this but I think he made the mistake of flattening the chicken so it was very dry.  Would work if I had made a sauce to go with it.  Will try again.  I will not flatten the chicken and I will make a light sauce to cover it.  We also used Harvarti cheese instead of  feta as we are not fond of it.

I've made this twice; the first time it was a bit dry.
The second time was more work, but very tasty. 
The chicken breasts I purchased were quite large and individually packaged. When I opened the package, the breasts were in two pieces, (one larger and one smaller). I butterflied the larger one, then hammered both of them flat. (This was nice because it gave more filling to the chicken/filling ratio, and it gave me two 'chicken rolls' per breast).
To the filling I substituted plain yogurt for the mayo, and added more garlic, oregano, some chopped sun-dried tomatoes in oil, and some bacon bits I had on hand.
After wrapping the chicken around the filling, (and wrapping some prosciutto around the chicken), I then seared the chicken in a pan on the stove; then sprinkled more oregano on top. I cooked covered in the oven for 30 minutes, then put the breasts under the broiler for a few minutes.
The chicken was very tasty and much more moist than the first time I made it, (not sure if this is due to the hammering of the chicken breast or from the yoghurt substitution). 
I considered adding artichoke hearts. . . .Maybe next time.

I always seem to have too much feta/spinach and the bacon wrap keeps the exposed stuffing put. For extra flavour, try prosciutto instead of bacon.

I (and my fiance) absolutely loved this dish!  I always try to cook recipes as they are written, saving the fact that I'm on a restrictive diet so some things get omitted like garlic.   I used thicker chicken breasts so at an hour, the thermometer maxed out at 130, so I baked it for an additional 20-25 minutes with no cover.  Great dish!

Pretty good base, could use something else. I followed recipe, but added salt to the chicken. I feel it could use something else seasoning wise besides the salt. I served with egg noodles and a vegetable. It was good, just not amazing. Recipe has potential

I was impressed with how well these came out!  My grocery store sells very thinly sliced chicken breasts, so I used those, rolled up the chicken around the filling and held it with a toothpick.  I thought for sure the filling would ooze out from the sides and make a mess but it stayed put!  Skipped the bacon because I was concerned about it being overly greasy.

I made it a bit differently. I was struggling to put the filling in the chicken breasts, so i got a turkey Bastet and cut the end off enough that I? could fit half of my pinky finger in it. I then threw the spinach filling in the microwave until it was a bit runny. Sucked it up in the turkey baster and filled the breasts. It worked well and minimized the mess. My husband and i recently moved into our first place so we don’t have much. I don’t have a cookie sheet yet, so i cooked them in a large, rectangular slow cooker. I? threw those puppies in and turned it on high and left them for about 3 hours. This helped keep the everything really nice and moist. After about 3 hours, i pulled them out and threw them into a frying pan to crisp up the bacon.

My hubby really enjoyed this meal. I uncovered the dish for the last 15 minutes to cook bacon. Next time I will pre-cook bacon a little so it's not raw or slimey. I'll also add little red potatoes on the sides.

The filling was so good! Used a maple flavoured bacon that added a nice touch with fresh spinach. I found the chicken at the ends a little dry, so next time I will rub a bit of olive oil on the skin before cooking to see if that helps. Will be making again.

Made this for the first time last night and was pleased with the results. I had to use freshly chopped spinach rather than the frozen kind merely because there was none left at the market, but it came out nicely nonetheless. Will definitely make again!

I have picky kids at my house but made this according to the directions. Kids Loved it!! Then i did different variations of this recipe on request of my husband & the kids. I used cauliflower & broccoli instead of spinach. I also used asiago & mozzarella instead of feta. I wrapped it in bacon & breaded it with an egg wash & flour with season salt, garlic powder,salt& pepper then fried it for a few minutes on each side. I put cream of chicken & cream of celery over the chicken & put it in the oven at 350. Just have to guess on the time. About 40 min. This recipie is so versatile you can mix anything to stuff the chicken with!! It is a family pleaser!!!

I enjoyed making this meal for my family. The process of making the meal was easy, and I found the overall finished taste pleasant and pleasing. I coupled the spinach stuffed chicken with a side of asparagus which complemented the main dish well. I've passed the recipe on to my mother who as well has since attempted the recipe and enjoyed the results.

I didn't have frozen spinach or bacon on hand, but I had frozen kale and prosciutto. Perfect substitutions! I also forgot to add the mayonnaise, but it didn't seem to matter. Very quick and easy to make, even on a weeknight.

This recipe is quite excellent. It's very quick and easy to make, and always leaves dinner guests happy and well-fed. The only thing I would warn potential cooks about is that the filling (spinach, feta, mayo) comes out to be much more than needed for the amount of chicken suggested. Even when I filled up the chicken with an absurd amount of filling each, I ended up freezing enough cheesy spinach "mix" to make another 3-4 servings. Other than that, this recipe is amazing! Very easy, and delicious!

We enjoyed this, and my husband and I both agreed that it's a "do again" dinner. The only change I made was that I used proscuitto to wrap around the chicken bundle rather than bacon. Very tasty!

For golden color, butterfly the breasts then sautée in a little olive oil. Proceed as directed. Before wrapping in bacon, dust lightly with paprika. Dish will now present beautifully. An elegant choice for a dinner party, sure to impress.

Loved this recipe! Very easy to make but tastes like I slaved for hours. :) The whole family cleaned their plates. Instead of rolling the chicken, I butterflied it first, filled the middle with the spinach, then used the bacon to hold it shut. Worked great and was much less of a hassle than rolling and toothpicking.

I followed instructions from another reviewer and omitted the bacon and chose to wrap the chicken in prosciutto instead. Could have cooked it about 5 minutes less. Flavors were wonderful. Will make again.

Like others I used  prosciutto instead of bacon and fat free Greek yogurt instead of Mayonnaise.  I did lightly season the chicken breast with seasoning salt and onion powder and then took the suggestion of the other reviews and mixed lemon juice, olive oil and oregano and poured it over the chicken before putting it in the oven. I covered it with aluminum foil and baked at 375 for an hour. I could have taken it out about 5 minutes earlier but the chicken was great!!!

Definitely make this again. I can't not tinker with a recipe so here's what I did: pounded chicken breast thin, cut in half when butterflying.  For filling,  used Gorgonzola diced crispy bacon green onion  added Feta, added a Romano asigo Parmesan mozzarella mixx of cheese and dollop of mayo. Sautéed  The green onion fresh spinach shiitake mushrooms in the bacon grease .  Also pre cooked the bacon partially. Spooned the fillingin on the chicken then rolled the chicken breast much like a Cordon Bleu .  Baked on a rack, then Broiled the  last five minutes to crissp the  bacon wrap and add color to the chicken. Reserved some leftover filling which I spooned over the top with the drippings. It was a huge hit!

Cooked as directed and it turned out great. Chicken stayed tender the only thing I did differently was to wrap it in two strips of bacon, since the chicken I bought looked much larger then the one in the photo. The bacon never got crispy, so it you are expecting crispier bacon it should be precooked and then placed around the chicken while it's still flexible.

I only had chicken tenders so I couldn't wrap so I just laid out the chicken, spread with the spinach mixture (used fresh spinach) and laid the bacon on top. Super moist. Will be making this again!

I too made a few changes with this recipe:

I wrapped the chicken with prosciutto (folded in half) after filling with the spinach mixture. For the mixture I used a combo of new and items I had on hand: chopped shallot, sub low fat sour cream for mayo, did 1/2 feta 1/2 Gorgonzola. I baked covered at 350 for about 30-40 mins and broiled for 5. There wasn't too much excesss liquid- possibly b/c I dried the spinach with paper towel as much as possible first. We loved the dish and I will definitely be making again!  I hope this helps!

I made this for dinner one night in December.  I made enough for dinner and for my girlfriend to take it to work the next day.  She had to come home early that day (car accident) and while crying about her car, she said, "And I have the most delicious lunch I left at work, too!"  I felt horrible for her, but hearing that made me think I did a good job on dinner, at least.  :)

Used pepper jack cheese instead of the feta. Tasted a little too much spinach taste for me. Will make again though.

This was tasty!  I used all the same ingredients but put it together differently. I only had chicken tender cuts. Not big enough to stuff. I also didn't want the extra fat from the bacon cooking with it.  I put half of the filling in the bottom of the pan, then the chicken, and then the rest of the filling. I precooked  the bacon and crumbled it on top and baked it. Yum!!

I altered the recipe slightly, by substituting garlic and herb cream cheese for the feta, and two slices or bacon per chicken breast, so that it was totally covered. Super hit, even for a picky eater who doesn't like cream cheese. Great recipe!

I'm not a very creative cook, so I have to follow recipes and other people's suggestions. I subbed Monterrey Jack for the feta because I don't care for feta.  If you have plump chicken breasts, you may need 2 slices of bacon to wrap it! I put a rack in a cookie sheet and baked it that way. So much grease my food wasn't sitting in at the end! YaY! It also helped get the bacon on the underside cooked a little more. 

I did find the filling to be slightly bland, could use a little ... something... more. I'm not intuitive enough to know what to add though :( Do plan to make it again!

I read through some other people's suggestions and this is what I came up with. I substituted monterey jack cheese for the feta. I sauteed some onions and garlic. I added that along with a bit of crumbled bacon to the stuffing. After baking them, I spooned a mixture of olive oil, lemon juice and Mrs. Dash all over the top and then I put them under the broiler for about 5 minutes. The flavor was amazing and the bacon was crisp.

This recipe is really good! Although it's one you'll have to do a few times to perfect it. I made only 3 small changes:
-Following another person's advice, I used prosciutto instead of bacon to avoid a greasy mess
-A lot of these recipes in my opinion come out overdone (it's probably my oven), so I did 35 minutes covered, 5 minutes uncovered, 5 minutes broiled to get a good crispness to the prosciutto and the chicken
-I added pepper and a dab of other spices (basil and onion powder) to the top of the chicken as I placed it in the oven.

I think the filling could use a little more something. So next time I might add other ingredients. This is why I gave it 4 stars. Feta is a pretty bland cheese, so maybe also adding a bit of parm cheese or montery would help, as well as some other spices besides the garlic. I also really wish it stated how much to put in the chicken (I guess it depends), but I didn't know if I should stuff it until the filling was practically spilling out, or if I should just do a thin layer. My opinion is it should have been a more flavorful filling, only using a thin layer, then doing some kind of marinate/spice to the outside of the chicken. 

The biggest thing to not mess up is draining the spinach (surprisingly this gave me the biggest difficulty out of everything). On top of putting it in a strainer, make sure you put it in a bunch of paper towels to soak up the water. If you don't, the mayo will get watery. This happend when I put my first scoop of mayo

I made this twice. Once as written and once with slight mods.
The first time I thought it had great potential with a couple of tweaks and that's why I tried it again instead of forgetting about it completely. In the original recipe, it called for bacon which did not crisp up. It was too limp and fatty for my taste and it left the dish greasy. I took the suggestion of other reviewers and used prosciutto and it was really good and it covered more of the chicken so you had more of that awesome pork flavor. I also flash fried the chicken to get a little bit of that golden brown look and to seal in the juices. I added a bit of finely chopped onion to the mayo, garlic, feta and spinach mix, well, because I like onion. It's a four star as written and a five star with my tweaks and because I am rating the original recipe,  I gave it four stars. At the very end, I uncovered it and drizzled it with Ken's Honey mustard dressing and broiled it for two or three minutes to crisp it up just a little bit more. The honey mustard dressing was the cherry on top. I served it with butternut squash from my garden and some steamed broccoli. Yum.

We loved it.  I did pre cook the bacon just a bit.  I sautéed fresh spinach and used vegan mayo. I barely salted the chicken because there's so much salt in the bacon and feta. .  I also turned up the temp to 450 the last 10 minutes  and then ,  again,  for the last 2-3 minutes I broiled it. It could just be my old oven. It was great!  Lots of salt in this dish so be careful salting your chicken.

I didn't have spinach on hand, so I used Colby jack cheese (block, sliced into long rectangular pieces). The family loved it! Will definitely be trying the spinach next go around.

I took a couple of suggestions from reviewers and added a few of my own.  The taste was wonderful, but the chicken was dry since I cooked them for an hour before uncovering.  I seasoned the breasts with salt, pepper and onion powder and let them sit overnight and  I pan seared them before stuffing (per DebD11).  Instead of the frozen spinach I cut up a bag of Central Market's spinach, porcini and white and mushroom in garlic and herb sauce for the filling along with 1/3 cup mayo and 2/3 cups sour cream,  and used shredded parm/romano mix for binding.  Adapted Linda W's suggestion and brushed breasts and bacon with olive oil , garlic paste, and dried oregano.   I will keep tweaking this recipe until I get the cooking, browning and bacon crispness times right.  This is a great recipe.

Awesome taste though I did take the foil off after 1 hour in the oven and then broil for about 10 minutes to get a nice golden brown top...  It looked a little too white without that step.

Simple and very tasty. I followed the instructions exactly except I only used 3 chicken breasts. Bacon was cooked perfectly an held the filling in the chicken. Pre-cooking is unnecessary as one hour in the oven is enough to cook it. A nice main dish that I served with mixed veggies! I will make this again.

I've done this several ways, using pork loin or  chicken thighs. all came out well with the original being the best so far. I plan on using turkey breast one of these days. I have also tweaked the filling and all have worked out well.

Added one egg instead of Mayo and followed the suggestion of others to cook on the stovetop rather than the oven (brown both sides,  add 1/3 cup chicken broth, cover and cook for for 12 minutes.). Fantastic!!!

DELICIOUS!!!! My whole family LOVED IT! Quick and easy. Served with a creamy tomato basil soup. The only thing I did differently was cook it UNcovered for 45 minutes instead of an hour covered. My chicken was moist and delicious. I don't know how others are coming out dry. If they are using the called for amount of  mayo and wrapping it in bacon there is plenty of oil there to keep the chicken moist AND if you cover it, that traps the moisture as well! I just uncovered mine because I like mine to brown a little =) Thanks for a delicious recipe.

Great recipe. I didn't have the right ingredients for this recipe, but I used Philadelphia Cream Cheese with herbs mixed with feta cheese and garlic for the stuffing. The result was extremely delicious. I will try this again for sure.

Made this last night and it came out excellent. I don't like the taste of frozen spinach so I used two 8oz bags of fresh spinach. I sautéed them in a pan with some butter then squeezed out the juice.

Made as is but used fresh chopped spinach and six breast halves pounded thin. Baked at 400 covered for 45 minutes then removed foil and broiled for 5 minutes. This creates a lot of juice in the pan that can be basted on top.  Delicious!  I also had lots of left over filling so I added shredded mozzarella and some Parmesan Cheese, put in a ramekin, and baked along with the chicken (but didn't broil). It made the most awesome, hot Spinach Dip!!!

I had to watch the video to learn how to butterfly the breasts, and it was super helpful. I substituted grated organic, part-skim queso for the feta and minced garlic for fresh garlic. I also used two slices of thick cut bacon rather than the single slice used in the video. After baking for the recommended hour, however, the bacon wasn't at all cooked. So I switched to broiling, which included some eyeballing and flipping the breasts. My boyfriend, my neighbor, my Snapchat friends, and I were all very happy and impressed with the results. It was delicious!

Loved it! Didn't have feta and used goat cheese instead, still came out great. Also, used extra bacon, definitely worth it!

The entire family really enjoyed this recipe.   The only thing I did not like is the bacon was not cooked enough for me.

I used slices of prosciutto  instead of bacon and fresh spinac. I found it to be quite salty  and wasn't impressed with the flavor. This was not a hit in my family.

The Filling/Stuffing was bland.  I had to add some spices and cheese to give it taste.  Excellent recipe to be used as a guide

Made this with a combo of prepared pesto and a spoonful of artichoke and Asiago dip.  Have also used spinach dip.  Butterflied and seasoned chicken breast with s &up, no salt seasoning and  garlic powder.  Wrapped with prosciutto.  Next time use less or no salt. The salt from the prosciutto come through. Very good. Baste occasionally with the oil, and juices. No need to use tooth picks. Based on the size of the chicken breasts, it took approximately 35-45 min.

I make this recipe all the time because it's so tasty and easy. I often use fresh spinach and that works just as well. I don't wrap them in bacon I just spread a little mayo over top the breast and then season with whatever I feel like that day.

The chicken came out so tender! The only down side is after a while the taste loses its appeal, I think next time I'll use less stuffing and maybe marinate the chicken first.

This one is a new favorite at my home. Easy to make and easy to substitute ingredients if you don't have a specific ingredient handy. I also reduced the cooking time. I checked the chicken after 45 minutes.  Yum!

The whole family loved this. The only minor adjustments that I made were to add some sauteed chopped onion (as previously recommended) to the spinach mixture and placed this inside seasoned thin sliced chicken, which I then rolled up and secured with toothpicks. I placed the partially cooked  bacon on the top only. The cook time in my oven was about 45 minutes.

This was super easy to make!  The family loved it.  I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 because it was very rich and after a few bites I couldn't eat any more.

I was skeptical to make this because my oldest daughter hates spinach but she ate it and didn't ask questions. Very tasty and flavorful recipe. I cooked the bacon for about 10 minutes so it took most of the grease out. Other than that I changed nothing! Definitely will make again soon!

I followed the recipes exactly and the chicken came out dry. I thought being covered and using really large breasts it would be ok. I would make this again but not bake for an hour.

My kids loved this and gobbled up the spinach after trying it.  I used Gorgonzola instead of feta because I like the flavor and I tried the lemon juice and olive oil mixture brushed on the top before going into the oven.  The bacon was well cooked but my convection oven helped with that too.  Served it with roasted Brussels sprouts and it was a hit with the whole family.  I will definitely make this dish again, my husband went back for thirds!

Added some portobello, Italian seasoning, red onion and s&p to stuffing would only put bacon on top next time because it was undercooked under the breast.

I made some substitutions:
I cooked fresh spinach with the garlic
I replaced mayo with Greek yogurt
And all I had was some Gorgonzola
I didn't have bacon, so closed with toothpicks and topped with a little sea salt.
Fingers crossed :)

It was really good, but when it said to cover and bake for an hour, the bacon was a little wimpy so I broiled it for about 5 minutes after baking for an hour. Both my husband and I like the taste and will definitely make it again.

i made this for my girlfriends moms birthday dinner which included 7 other ppl so i just doubled the exact ingredients and it turned out amazing! everyone loved it. all i did different was well the chicken cooked i graded fresh lemon and sprinkled it on top the chicken breasts and also made a mixture of fresh lemon juice and veg oil and drizzled it on every 20 to 25 minutes to keep the chicken moist and put some dill on top as well added tons of flavor. i cooked it for an hour overall and then broiled it for 10 mins just to make the bacon crispy.

My sister gave this exact recipe to me years ago.  I've made it many times.  The only change I make is to sauté a bit of onion and add it to the spinach mixture.  I also split the cook time between covered and uncovered.  That way the top browns and the bacon crisps up.  

I've also forgone the bacon and use pancetta over the top.  We seem to prefer it this way, no soggy bacon.  

Great recipe that is easy to make.

I followed the directions exactly and my family and I love it. I've already this more than a few times and everyone who's eaten has had no complaints. No leftovers every time. Sometimes I won't have any garlic, and it still tastes good. I will say that when I bake it, I bake it in a roasting pan with a cover so that the chicken breast doesn't come out too dry.

I found the chicken to be dry but I also used a cookie sheet instead of a shallow dish because I did not have one. I'm going to go out and get a shallow dish and try again.

This is so good, to make it easier, I spread the spinach/feta mixture on top of chicken breasts ( if too thick, I flatten slightly) and to ensure the bacon gets crispy, I cut the bacon and place on top of the breasts instead of wrapping it. It works out great without too much work.  Love this recipe.

I made this pretty much to the letter - except added some chopped onion as recommended by another reviewer.  I also didn't have bacon, so no bacon wrap.  It was excellent!  My 16-year-old daughter loved it - said it was the most flavourful chicken she'd ever had!  I will reduce cooking time next time to maybe 50 minutes as it was a bit dry.  And will definitely wrap in bacon (which I think will save it from drying out).  Excellent recipe!

Worked out great! Made it twice, and on the second time I took the tip to use tin foil. It's fine both ways, just depends on your tastes!

I followed the instructions exactly and I found the spinach feta combo tasting a bit fishy. it was odd. The chicken was juicy and the bacon added a delicious flavor (well of course, it's bacon) but I can't say that I'll be trying this one again. I just started cooking dinner for my family and the only ones who said it was good were my teenage brother and my always hungry boyfriend.

We love this! I have made this several times and the only changes I make is to add a lot of garlic due to personal preference. Perfect recipe.

Great easy meal. I did uncover the chicken after 40 minutes so it wasn't steamed chicken and use prosciutto instead of bacon.

I made this tonight but with some minor substitutions and additions. I used fresh spinach (chopped), added chopped onion and used proscuitto. An excellent recipe I will be making again. Highly recommend.

My first time butter flying chicken, followed the recipe but used cooked bacon to make sure it was crispy, make sure to drain the spinach well or the bacon on the bottom will be soggy. Next time I'll add more bacon. Chicken breast needs all the help it can get

A favorite at my house.  I use fresh chopped spinach in place of the frozen.  I also tried turkey bacon once in place of the regular bacon.  I do not recommend doing that.

I will make it again. Delicious! I used low fat mayo and sliced chicken breasts all the way through and stuffed each piece rather than butterflying. 
Also turned oven on to broil for last couple minutes to Brown everything up. 
Served on a bed of couscous to soak up all yummy pan juices

Used what I had on hand.  Added 3/4 cup of chopped onions, doubled the garlic, sauteed the onions before adding them into the mix, substituted small curd cottage cheese, and used canned spinach (drained). Followed the rest of the recipe.  It turned out GREAT!

It was good, but the bacon was still under cooked. If I make it again, I will precook the bacon a little.

This was SO GOOD... I used a mixture of spinach and kale, which I sauteed with some minced mushrooms and minced half of an onion before I mixed it in with the mayo and cheese. Delicious... I personally can't eat a whole chicken breast in one sitting, so I went ahead and just halved each breast (to make a total of 8) and made more of a chicken wrap than a stuffed chicken breast. My family loved it and they're already begging me to make it again. Great recipe!! Will be a family favorite!!!

The chicken was bland and flavorless; the spinach stuffing added no flavor at all.  Despite the hour-long cook time the bacon hardly cooked through and did not have the crispness which would be expected for such a long baking time.

This was very disappointing.  I made it as written and found it awfully bland. The only reason I didn't give it one star was because the chicken did turn out tender.

This was delicious. I used 6 large chicken breasts and double the stuffing recipe. After the hour of cooking, I drained the juices from the pan, poured some atop the chicken and broiled for about 5 minutes to crisp bacon. Turned oven off, recovered with foil and let sit in warm oven for about 10 minutes to re soften chicken but bacon was really crisp and it was perfect!

This was very good.  I pre-cooked the bacon (added two slices per breast), used fresh spinach and combined part low fat mayo and part low fat herb & garlic cream cheese as well as some garlic and spices.  It was very good.  I also placed the chicken on a cooling rack above a cookie sheet and did not cover the pan.

Excellent recipe! I used fresh spinach and cooked them on a cooling rack over a foil lined pan as suggested by someone else. I also broiled them about 10 minutes to get the desired color and crispy bacon. Yummy and easy!

This was a very simple recipe the chicken turned out very moist, however the frozen spinach and feta were not very flavorful. I cooked it covered for an hour like the recipe says and when it was done I noticed it looked very bland, the bacon was limp and looked uncooked (although after being in the oven for an hour I know it wasnt) I took the tin foil and placed it under the broiler for about 3 minutes it brought the bacon to life and gave the chicken a nice brown look without affecting the moisture of the chicken. Next time I attempt this recipe I think I'll try pre cooking some fresh spinach and adding another cheese for more flavor.

My husband and I love this!!! I keep everything the same except I did season my chicken with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. I did not have enough bacon to wrap each piece of chicken so I fried the bacon and crumble on top of the chicken with extra feta I had.

it's good but it will be better if you added lemon juice to the mix. Also use your spices and put 1/2 cup of water in the baking dish because it was too dry.

Super super good! The only thing I changed was adding mushrooms to the stuffing. I also put a little Italian bread crumbs, and used olive oil mayo instead. The mayo makes the breast super moist! I also used turkey bacon instead because I don't eat pork, and sprinkled some parm cheese on the top! Yummmm

I liked it! Very easy to make. I actually added 2 slices of baxon instead of one. Instead of 375 ° F I preheated to 450°F and the bacon cooked pretty good and the chicken as well. I will definitely cook it again.

I am a beginner in the kitchen and tried this dish today. I didn't use bacon (counting calories), the chicken was fantastic and the spinach with feta filling was amazing! Definitely will prepare this again.

This was not very flavourful. I was raised in Southeast Asia so I like a little oomph to my meals, and this did not have any. That said, it was still pretty edible, if terribly boring.

My first batch the chicken was too dry. I took it out after 40 minutes and it was great. I also used Prosciutto instead of bacon. This is a very healthy and tasty recipe. I would make it again.

The first time I made this recipe and it's not only very easy, it's very tasty. After thawing out my chicken, I found that I had tenders and not full breasts. So, I laid down strips of bacon, placed a layer of tenders, poured in the mixture, added a layer of tenders then topped with strips of bacon. It turned out fantastic. This is a 'keeper'.

I made this for my boyfriend who is hard to please and he loved it! He wants it wrapped with more bacon next time. I also followed someones advice and added lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, and oregano to the chicken breast. Turned out awesome! Just be wary with the cook time. It'll only dry out if you over cook it!

I did change it a little, I added red bell peppers, used a bit more feta cheese, and added some Mrs.Dash Garlic and Herb into the mix. Then wrapped the chicken in the bacon and sprinkled some Lemon and Pepper and Chicken seasoning on top. It taste amazing! I'm making it again for lunch!

I. Am. Addicted. And so is my family. I've made this once, and I'm currently making it once more; just with some changes of my own. And I'll for sure make it again!

One piece of bacon wasn't enough to cover the massive chicken breast, I used three to wrap and one to vertically wrap the others. Because the breasts I buy are so large, I only made three for each of the people in my household. I added 1 cup of Feta instead of 1/2 and a little more spinach; mainly because last time a pretty big amount of the feta had melted out. Added about an 1/8th of a teaspoon of salt, a couple shakes of pepper and jammed it into the chicken. Mopped up the rest of the stuffing with a loose piece of breast and covered the breasts in what little was left. Lightly salted and peppered the top because last time it was a little bland.

My boyfriend complained that the bacon wasn't done enough, so this time around I'm going to let it cook a little bit longer.

Served with broccoli and cheese, and Allrecipes has a recipe named "Holiday baked apples" that's for dessert! 

I'll admit, sometimes I splurge. Whoops.

AMAZING flavor. My fiance made this and didn't drain the spinach very well, but it wound up transferring the moisture to the chicken, keeping everything juicy and delicious.

Tastey! I pan fried both sides of breasts for 45 sec to cut cooking time in half and I used thin cut chicken breasts that I seasoned with garlic powder and sea salt on both sides. Quick and easy recipe and after 30 min was done I sprayed the tops of the breasts with canola and broiled on low until golden. And I used Oscar Mayer turkey bacon that I half way cooked prior to wrapping the breasts and I didn't need toothpicks because thin cut breasts roll up nice :)

Very good recipe. It was my first time trying feta cheese. For anything. I hate frozen and canned spinach so I sautéed the garlic and the baby spinach in olive oil Letting it cool before I mixed it into the cheese mixture. I love bacon so I wrapped two pieces around each piece. The extra held everything together nicely.

I followed the recipe for the chicken breasts.  I only made two, so with the left over mixture, I added Alfredo sauce and pasta. OMG.  This was to die for delicious with a diced fresh tomato and cooked mushrooms added.  Better than any restaurant pasta and it went so well with the Chicken breasts.

I substituted Greek yogurt for the mayo and added a shredded carrot since I had 6 chicken breasts.  Also, because of the heat, I baked on the grill.  Didn't go over as well as I expected with the family but I liked it very much.

This recipe is simply amazing. It's easy and tastes so good! I double all of my portions to make enough for 10 people. I cooked this for my family's Mother's Day meal, and they all loved it. I had no drying out or any other issues. This will definitely be one of my quick go-to recipes.

Amazing! After reading a few reviews I decided to follow the suggestion of mixing the bacon in with the stuffing. It was still lacking, added 1/2 packet of dry ranch mix and YES!! House hold hit!

Added a little S&P to both the mixture and to the top of the chicken. Used very flavorful thick bacon which really added to the flavor. Timing was perfect. Great recipe!

This was great and it's very low carb.  I used a few other responses and I precooked the bacon a little bit.  Also precooked the chicken a little also.  Also used  Monterey Jack.  Pulled it out of the oven and uncovered it.  Spinkled some monterey Jack on top and put back in for 10  minutes.  Great flavor and so easy to make.  Everybody loved it.

This was fabulous, although I did make a couple of changes. Instead of mayo, I used about 3 tablespoons of cream cheese. (My fiance doesn't like mayo) Instead of garlic, mixed in some onion, and didn't have any bacon, so left that out. I also, browned the chicken on the stovetop first for a few minutes on each side, then transferred to the oven to finish cooking. So good! Will definately make again. Next time I will for sure try it with the bacon.

I cooked this covered on 375 for 45 minutes and the chicken was too dry. Next time I'll cook it covered for 30 mins.  I'm only giving it 3 stars because an hour would have been too long.

Ok... I'm not the greatest cook, so keep that in mind with this review... I made this, but being me, didn't follow directions exactly... first, I took out the garlic, yuck... and still used the rest of the ingredients as stated... second, I kind of forgot to cover it until I was about 30 minutes into cooking... lol... typical me... but decided that it was too late to cover it so scratched that idea... lol... overall, I thoroughly loved it... family, they enjoyed it compared to frozen pizza or other frozen cookables... I plan on experimenting now that I sort of have the idea :)

Big hit with my family!  The second time I made it, I ran out of feta & used bleu cheese.  It was still wonderful!  The first time I made it I forgot the bacon-they still loved it!  My crew can be hard to please & there's a lot of them.  This is a definite crowd pleaser!  Thanks for the awesome recipe!!!!

Fabulous recipe.  I used fresh spinach, cheddar cheese, sour cream, fresh chopped garlic, instead of what they wanted.  Cooked perfectly.  The extra stuffing was put into mushrooms and they were fabulous!

I left recipe exactly as is!!! It was delicious. I microwaved the bacon for a minute prior to wrapping. My chicken was not greasy at all ( like others said) maybe because I microwaved it. I did drizzle lemon juice and olive oil over the chicken. My husband loved it!!!

Made this last night and loved it! I had three very large blsl chicken breasts, so I split the majority of the filling up between them and had a few spoonfuls leftover. Also, because the chicken pieces were so big i had to use two pieces of bacon on each one... but whats wrong with MORE bacon? :) baked them at 375 for 30 minutes covered, 20 minutes uncovered, and then turned on the broiler for the last 5 minutes to crisp the bacon a little more. The dish turned out perfectly cooked, but if I had used "normal" sized chicken breasts, I definitely would have needed to reduce their time in the oven. This will be in our monthly meal rotation for sure.

Very tasty! I used shredded Parmesan/Mozzarella mix in place of the feta and I'm so glad I did! The bacon was done after cooking however I turned the oven up to 400 and let it brown a bit more to my liking.

Family loved it! I used turkey bacon (cooked lightly) to wrap it on the outside. I did brown the breast pieces before rolling.  The spinach filling was excellent.  I had extra so I put it in a small baking dish for 20 minutes at 350 and everyone devoured it with ritz crackers! Nothing wasted! They fought over leftovers the next day!

I followed the instructions exactly as it says, listening to other reviews. I checked during the cooking process to see if it was browning or if the bacon seemed to be getting cooked or not. It wasn’t, so I pulled it out of the oven and placed the chicken on a cooling rack on top of a cookie sheet and set it back in the oven, not covered. My bacon cooked and my chicken browned perfectly. This recipe just needs slight modifications for cooking. You need an area to catch dipping/grease in order not to have that greasy chicken.

We really loved this. I played with it a bit taking hints from others, but I believe the core recipe is wonderful. Baked at 375 covered for 30 minutes and then 15 uncovered. 
Jazzed up the filling with the onions and garlic after sautéing them. I tossed the chicken breasts into that same pan and browned them a bit. Color was much better - so more appetizing to me.
I threw in some Italian seasoning. It was fantastic! Thanks to the original poster of this recipe!

Was easy to make and wonderful to eat. I used Gorgonzola cheese because I don't care for feta. I forgot to use mayo and it was great without.

This was great.  I used small organic chicken breasts, so rather than butterflying them I wrapped them around the spinach mix, and used the piece of bacon to tie them up.  I didn't need as much spinach mix due to the small size of the chicken--perhaps only half as much.

I used prosciutto instead of bacon and also basted chicken as it cooked with a mixture of olive oil, garlic and oregano.  It was very good, but nothing spectacular.  I will try it again but will try lower the oven temperature to 350 as the chicken was a bit on the dry side.

Made this tonight for dinner and everyone raved about it!! The stuffing was excellent and the chicken was so tender and juicy - not to mention everyone loved the bacon! The chicken could have been seasoned a little or maybe even marinated lightly, but besides that it was just perfect!

I really loved the spinach mixture!I think it could use alittle more feta but it was very good. Next time Ill bake the chicken for less time. It came out dry. I'm using a new oven so that may have something to do with it. I also used turkey bacon which I cooked first to crisp. Next time Id like to use regular bacon for more flavor. I will def try this again till I get it right.

Everyone really enjoyed the meal. I made some pasta on the side and it worked out well. Maybe a little too heavy of a meal, next time I am thinking of having vegetables. This was my first time making the chicken and the taste was great, maybe I would add some onion and mushroom, only thing I need to figure out is how I can make the chicken be more moist. It was a little dry. Otherwise great.

I made this a few days ago and it was super delicious! The only changes I made was use half.of the amount of mayonnaise to lower the amount of calories a bit... and I used turkey bacon! It came out perfect... didnt miss the other half of mayo!! I would definitely make this again! Hubby and family loved it too! Thanks!

Used kale instead of spinach, prepped the chicken with onion powder before I cooked it, and used pepper jack cheese in the stuffing.  Leftovers?  What leftovers?

I made this. You have to add seasoning to your chicken to make it bare able. The spinach and feta mixture was the only good part. The chicken was not dry but had no flavor at all. The bacon did not compliment it at all and I cooked mines a little past halfway first. I wouldn't waste my time or money on this again.

This recipe was delicious! My mom was so impressed with it. It also warms up well for leftovers. I followed the recipe exactly and it came out great. I didn't have any trouble with the bake time either. The chicken breasts were done according to the time it said at the temperature it called for. I will make this again.

These turned out ok. I think I should have taken greater care in draining the spinach before baking, because I had a lot of liquid  in the baking dish. It still tasted good.

I used this as a base but altered quite a bit.
I used Greek yogurt, fresh spinach (about half a cup), cut the bacon, added some green onions, used Gruyere cheese with a little Parm/Romano.  I also added a bit of chopped red pepper (not much - too much would overwhelm). I basically kept the chicken and garlic and went from there.  Also use garlic salt and pepper on the chicken before putting it in the oven.  It was delicious and quite a bit healthier.

Great recipe but I also omitted the bacon, didn't want all the grease.  I added more herbs and also some lemon. I mistakenly used salad dressing instead of the mayo which was a mistake.  It made it much too sweet.  Otherwise it was a successful dish.

This recipe was absolutely delicious! I followed it exactly and it turned out great! However, right before I took the chicken out of the oven I turned the oven on broil for about 3-5 minutes to crisp up the bacon a little more! So Yummy!

The only problem with this recipe is I assumed that the kiddos wouldn't like it so I only made 3 breasts (one for them to split).  Everyone loved it.  I made it according to the recipe and I wouldn't change a thing.  10 year old thanked me for making such a great meal.  Easy to throw together and will go into the rotation.  Thank you!!

Loved this. I used Turkey bacon. I was baking fingerling potatoes with olive oil and garlic at the end I brushed the garlic flavored oil on the bacon to crisp it up. Also used Sharp Cheddar Cheese instead of Feta.. So Yummy!!!!

Delicious! I  will definitely make this one again. I uncovered it and let cook for another 15 min to get the bacon more well  done. The flavors go well  together.

I followed some of the other comments and seasoned the chicken before cooking. When cooked, the chicken was very pale and the bacon was Very far from crispy. Next time I will use a different cheese and pre-cook the bacon.

I used fresh chopped spinach and light mayo. Also added a squeeze of lemon juice in the spinach mixture and then squeezed a little on top of the chicken with pepper just before baking. I also baked it at 375 for about 45 minutes and 400 the last 15 minutes. It make the bacon a little crispier. very good!

Very Good! I did add a little bit of boccancini cheese, since I was a little short on Feta.  It added a little more cheesy/creamy texture to the spinach mixture. I had chicken breast halves, that I pounded out to thin out, and just topped the breasts with the spinach mixture.  It kept the chicken juicy and tender. Also, I didn't have any bacon or prosciutto or ham, so omitted that entirely, not by choice.   All in all, I loved it and would definitely make again.

I am a cooking newbie and this recipe was so easy and quick and a definite hit in my house. My husband and kids loved it and asked for it to be a regular on the weekly menu. I took the suggestion of another reviewer and pre-cooked the bacon in the microwave because we like our bacon on the crispy side in my family. I also added an extra bacon per breast.

This recipe as stated needed a sauce because it really was too dry an there was not enough basting to drip over the final product.  It also could have used a little more seasoning. However, the presentation was very nice.

I think the recipe takes a little tweaking, but it was the first time I had made any sort of stuffed chicken breasts, so it was a good starter recipe. The one issue I have is that the stuffing turns out to be about double what you are able to fit in the chicken breast, so that is a lot of waste.  The chicken dried out a little too much and overall the chicken just seemed rather bland.  I think next time I will brush the chicken breast with olive oil and herbs to give it a bit more flavor.  ONe thing I thought of doing after the fact was crumbling some bacon into the stuffing to add some favor as well.  The bacon wrapped around the chicken was just limp and kind of useless.  It didn't seem to cook all the way and was just something I ended up pushing to the edge of my plate as I started eating.

Very easy to make and really tasty. Great for serving at dinner parties! The bacon really keeps the moisture trapped in the chicken. I often find that cooking chicken in the oven makes it very dry--not this recipe though!
I cut down on the amount of spinach and used fresh instead of frozen because I don't like the textured of thawed frozen spinach. This recipe actually made enough filling for a total of 6-8 chicken breasts rather than the 4 as stated. My husband loves this and can't get enough of it!

Really difficult to tell when it was done.  Also, I was unsure how much filling to put in each breast. My family liked it, but I wasn't a fan, mostly because the filling was too strong for my tastes.

even though i made too much stuffing, this went down pretty well with my family(I didn;t have any myself).  I used gouda instead of feta(my sister just had a baby and didnt like feta coz it was too strong), and swapped some cream for mayonnaise, but only used a few tablespoons.  The results were excellent, definitely gonna use this recipe again!

Grrreat recipe! Brushed both sides with olive oil and added a little salt & pepper, wrapped with turkey bacon (pre-cooked in microwave for just under 2 min) and kept the rest exactly as stated. NOT dry at all! One of the best meals i've had in a long time! Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

I think this recipe is a good foundation for an easy yet fancy dish worthy of serving to company but I did not think it had much flavor as written.  Next time I will add more herbs, maybe more veggies (in addition to spinach) and perhaps some pine nuts to the filling.  I definitely liked the proscuito wrapping versus bacon (as suggested by others) to cut down on grease.  I also tried basting with the garlic, oregano, oil & lemon juice mix but next time will probably try serving it with a sauce for more flavor.

EXCELLENT!  I used the recipe as stated and wouldn't change a thing!  Chicken was tender and the flavors were lightly medded.  I'll definitely be making it again!

This was ok. Maybe I stuffed to much of the filling in the chicken? I may or may not try this again. I cooked the chicken perfectly though. Just didn't care for the stuffing very much.

I've made this a few different ways. Instead of mayo, I use cream of chicken soup. Also, I have used fresh broccoli chopped very fine. Instead of feta cheese,a good blend of shredded cheese is always a good substitute. I've used turkey bacon as well as regular bacon. It all depends on what ingredients I have on hand. Any of these ingredient mixes are delicious! I do however, always leave out the may for the cream of chicken soup.

I fixed this meal this evening. It was mouth-watering!  I made some changes.  I wrapped the chicken breasts in turkey bacon. I also cut the large chicken breasts across and pounded the breast until about 1/4 inch thick before stuffing them and wrapping them in bacon.  Next I browned the breasts in about 1 tblsp. canola oil. Then I baked the chicken for about 15 to 20 minutes. I served sauteed apples and fried cabbage on the side.  My husband really enjoyed this!  I will make this again.

This is a definate keeper!  I used fresh spinach which I wilted in the microwave...instead of butterflying the cutlets, I pounded them out thinnly and rolled them, sealed with a few toothpicks!  YUMMY INDEED!

I'm giving this 5 stars for flavour and ease. The change I made was to not use mayo, but creamy Caesar dressing. It was very tasty. I also pre-cooked the bacon in the microwave for about 4 minutes first. At the end, I turned the oven to broil, just to crisp it all up. We enjoyed it.

Very good. Everyone in my family liked it and that it is hard to accomplish. They aren't Feta fans so I put Mexican blend shredded cheese in thiers.  I also salt and peppered the chicken. I will definately add more spices next time.

It was a good recipe. I cooked my chicken for about 15 minutes less than the recipe called for. I will definitively make this again but I would add  some more spices as other reviewers have mentioned.

Yum!  This was good, and very easy.  I did not use bacon, because we didn't have any on hand, but I'm sure it would have been great with it!!  Also, I pounded the chicken thin and rolled it up with the filling, instead of butterflying.  Very good!  Cook time was a bit long - I might try less next time.

Thanks to the other reviewers I added lemon juice and did not include the bacon.
I covered the chicken for part of the cooking time so the meat remained tender.
This is a keeper!

We really enjoyed this recipe. I did all mozzarella cheese because we had a bunch left over from a party, threw in a little parmesan, extra garlic and used sour cream instead of mayo.
I also soaked the chicken in Buttermilk as some suggested. My husband and I loved it. And he is one picky eater! :)

Not sure what it takes like as is.  I "kicked it up a notch" using a bunch of ideas from the other reviewers and it turned out perfect!  Added some diced mushrooms (about a handful) and diced shallot (couple of tbsp) to the stuffing - split and flattened the chicken and rolled instead of stuffed so it would cook more evenly; wrapped in prosciutto instead of bacon;  cooked on 400 degrees F 15 minutes covered, then 20 mins uncovered.  Seasoned the inside of the chicken with salt and pepper before stuffing and rolling.  Sprinkled a "kraut mix" (dried veggie flakes and salt) on outside.  Definitely going in the family recipe book as a keeper!

This recipe was divine! I preread all of the reviews and combatted the dryness of the chicken by wrapping each breast with two pieces of bacon, using the extra filling atop the stuffed and wrapped breasts and using  a touch of olive oil on the bottom of the pan. It was a hit!!

OMG this is incredibly good. It's definitely my all time favorite. I'm a little more health conscious so I used turkey bacon instead and it gave it this smoked taste that's to die for...Awesome!!!

My entire family loves this. Even my 13 year-old!  I, too, tweaked it abit. I doubled the ingrediants and added bacon pieces to the mixture instead of wrapping the breasts.  I also put a touch of lemon juice in. After stuffing the breasts, I have mixture left over and just spoon it over the breasts in the cooking dish.  My daughter loves the mixture on it's own, so she always gets as much of the extra as she can.

This will blow your guests away!  It was so easy to make I decided to make it for some close friends.  After the first try I decided to double the sauce because it was so good.  Everyone loved it and I never burnt the chicken.  This gets an A+!

Loved it!! Super easy...will definitely be making again. The only thing I think could've been better, was if the bacon was cooked more and crispier. Which I'll figure out how to do that the next time I make it. Other than that, it was amazing.

I didn't wrap with bacon but will try prosciutto next time.  The stuffing, as following the proportions in the recipe, would've been enough to fill at least 6 chicken breasts.  I also lightly oiled and sprinkled salt, pepper, and thyme on top.  Dinner turned out fantastic and my husband ate 3 of the 4 breasts!

This recipe gave me a great foundation for spinach stuffed chicken breasts.  Things I did differently, was used cheddar cheese instead of feta, pre-cooked the bacon a bit, pounded the chicken breast then rolled it in flour and seared it in the bacon grease before throwing it in the oven.  I loved it!  Next time I plan to throw some chopped water chestnuts in with the spinach mixture. I realize it's not fair to rate this recipe based on not following the recipe, but like I said, it was a great foundation that helped me to get started.  Thanks!

This was a good start, but I doctored it up some, since many reviews said it needed some doctoring.  I fried down some onion, garlic, mushrooms and sundried tomatos.  Once done, I sauted the spinach for a few minutes.  I added that mixture to my mayo and fetta cheese.  Stuffed the chicken breasts.  I brushed on a coating mixture of olive oil, garlic juice, lemon juice and Italian seasoning.  I baked at 400 for 20 minutes and then put under the broiler for the reamining time.  Delicious!

LOVE LOVE LOVE.  My go to recipe.  I double the stuffing.  No bacon.  Throw in oven for an hour then just take out. Never have to check, always perfectly done!  Also any stinky cheese will work well.  I've used leftover stinky cheese I didn't like and it was amazing.

So delicious!!! Made this tonight for my husband and I, and he asked if I'd make it next week when his parents are over. We literally talked about how good it was in between every bite. Only used two chicken breasts, but left everything else the same and then poured the remaining ingredients over the chicken breasts. We also skipped the bacon, but it still tasted wonderful.

I would really only rate this 1 star the way I made it (without bacon)....not recommended.  It was so bland.  I am positive it would be better with bacon, hence 3 stars.  I just skipped bacon since the person I made it for doesn't like bacon.

Just made this tonight and it was absolutely fab! Thanks for the basic recipe! I did change mine up some only because thats what was in my fridge. For the spinach mixture I used  fresh spinach chopped, sundried tomatoe and basil feta, olive oil, garlic and fresh lemon juice. The amt OOil I used just enough to combine ingredients and wilt spinach. NO Mayo. no bacon (none in firdge). I browned the chicken rolls in an iron skillet and then put the skillet in the oven for 30minutes. the juices made were enough for basting. I salted and peppered to taste while in the oven. this will be made again!!!

I made this tonight for dinner and the whole family loved it.  I used a lot of the suggestions.  In my mixture I used more bacon already cooked and diced up with sauteed onions.  I only had romano cheese.  I also coated it with the lemon juice, olive oil, garlic and oregeno.  It only took 35 mintues to cook for me.  Excellent, can not wait to try it again with another cheese and maybe add some cream of chicken to mixture.

Great recipe ~ however I did what another reviewer suggested and went for prosciutto instead of bacon.  I'm sure bacon tastes just as good but I had prosciutto on hand.  Will definitely make again.  Husband doesn't care for spinach yet this recipe had FETA (which he loves) and he ate every last bite :)

I made several alterations to this recipe 1. I used finely shredded pepper jack cheese (dbl the amount) 2. I used just 2 table spoons of mayo 3. I marinated the chicken and grilled it for about a minute on each side 4. slightly cooked the bacon 5. also added triple the garlic and added red bell peppers My boyfriend absolutely LOVED it said it was just like the restaurant, and I loved it too it was probably one of the best meals I`ve ever made. I served it with potatoes sauteèd with onions and garlic and baked with chicken stock/rosemary/thyme/garlic base the whole meal was a hit! Thanks for the idea Oh and I also cooked the chicken at 350 for 30 minutes, and under the broiler for 6 to crisp the bacon the chicken was juicy and the bacon was perfect.

I made this for my husband and he really liked it. The only things I did differently was leave off the bacon (my husband doesn't like pork, and I don't eat meat at all), and instead of using feta (I didn't have any) I used a tangy Irish cheese I found in the deli a while back. I added some dill also, to make up for the tanginess of the feta.

I was disappointed by this dish. I did add onions as others suggested, used pepper jack cheese since it's the only kind my significant other will eat and sprinkled a few red pepper flakes into the spinach mixture.  With all the great ingredients, I expected spectacular flavor but instead the spinach mixture was rather bland. I probably won't make this again.

I made this exactly as it called for in the recipe.  The spinach mix was extremely salty for some reason and 1 hour for cooking the chicken was too long.  I will try to modify it and see if it turns out better next time.

Delicious! The chicken was very tender and juicy. My husband and 3 boys (age 16, 14 and 11) loved it!!! The spinach stuffing was creamy and very rich. I did use crumbled blue cheese this time and it was fantastic. We will definitely be using this recipe again and use the feta cheese as well!

This recipe was a big hit with my boyfriend; he said it was his favorite thing I have cooked for him (yet). I used about double the garlic as we are big garlic fans. Next time, I will use a little less mayonaisse because the flavor was a little overwhelming in some bites. I also added some black pepper to the outside of the breasts, which made a nice crust. You could also use blue cheese instead of feta, which we'll probably do in the future. Overall, a great recipe that we will be eating again!

Good, but not great!  I made the recipe as directed; and I think it turned out exactly as intended, however my family thought it needed some kick.   The flavors almost blended together too well.

Made this recipe exactly as directed, except that I used low fat feta, and low fat mayo, since that's what I had in the house.  Our entire family LOVED it.  We will definitely be making this one again.

I really liked this recipe.  I used turkey bacon instead of regular bacon because it's healthier and I like the taste.  The only thing that I agree with was that I might cut down on the spinach next time but maybe by a quarter.  Delicious!

It came out very well! My husband loves this dish, and wants it all the time. I did do a bit of substituting at the last minute, basically because I forgot to grab some of the ingredients at the store...lol...but it still came out very well..instead of pork bacon, I used turkey bacon, and it didn't come out greasy at all....Perfect!!

Great recipe!  Of course, I added my own touches, and it was delicious!  I used fresh spinach and sauteed garilic and onion then added spinach and a teaspoon of tomato paste and 1/4 cup sherry.  I also used salt, pepper, paprika, and greek seasoning to season.  I only used a a tablespoon of mayonaise, and then added the half cup feta, and two tablespoons of greek yogurt.  I combined the ingredients with the spinach mixture.  I placed my stuffed chicken breasts in my double dutch oven at 250 and four hours later, it was so tender, juicy, and amazing!  I couldn't believe how great it turned out - hubby loved it and we had leftovers for lunch!

Made this for dinner today. Mother-in-law absolutely loved it (that's all that matters, right) Chicken was very moist and tasty. I took other people's advice by using fresh spinach and adding onions to the spinach mixture. I also uncovered the chicken at 20mins left to the window. I cut out half the mayo, I was afraid of it being too runny. Still turned out fabulous. I will make this dish again.

These were so good. I didnt wrap them in bacon, but that was only because I didnt have any. The chicken was so juicy and tender. Will definitely make again. There are endless possibilities to stuff them with.

I made this recipe without the bacon.  I added mushrooms to the mixture as I am a HUGE gan of mushrooms!  It was a bit on the sour side which I didn't care too much for.  Perhaps if the mixture was a tad more sweet (not too sweet, but, not as sour tasting) it would've been awesome.  Will try again with something to sweeten the mixture.  Any ideas would be great!

This meal was very tasty and a great alternative meal for large crowds.   I decided to use ricotta cheese instead of mayo, and I used breadcrumbs and Parmesan cheese to make the mixture thicker.  Adding to the mixture plenty of fresh baby spinach, cooked slightly then drained, just made this recipe great! [For every pound of Ricotta cheese, use 1 cup of breadcrumbs, and one cup of Parmesan cheese,] Don't forget to add one tsp. of dried oregano to give this recipe some flavor.  All the cheese and Ricotta has plenty of salt; so, you really don't need to add more.  Adjust the amounts of the mixture (1 to 1/2 and 1/2) for smaller or larger portions. Cooking the bacon in microwave (about 1 minute for each strip) before placing it around the chicken reduces the amount of grease.  Use olive oil to baize the chicken since there won't be much grease from the bacon.  Enjoy.

My husband liked it very much but no one else liked it   The feta cheese is too tangy for my group.  I'll try it with cheddar next time.  I also used garlic powder instead of two cloves.  Be careful of what kind of bacon you use, it will make a difference in the flavor.

This dish was absolutely delicious!!  I made it for 18 guests, which included some children, and they all loved it.  I covered the chicken with foil while it was cooking.  When there was about 10 minutes left, I took off the foil and put the chicken under the broiler to brown a bit.  The chicken made it's own sauce in the pan which I spooned on before serving. I don't know if the spinach wasn't drained enough or the foil helped create the sauce but it wasn't dry at all.  I had to email the recipe to most of my adult guests because they loved it so much!

This was amazing.  I used finely chopped Spinach because that's what I had on hand.  I added a little onion powder to the mix and freshly ground pepper on the chicken.  I also used the cooking suggestion of a previous reviewer bake 350 covered for 20min, uncovered for 20 and broil for 5.  It came out perfect.  This recipe will definitely be one that I will use a lot.

Great meal easy ok well it needs 2 or 3 slices of bacon :)) FYI better to use lower grade bacon thin sliced rather than the thicker sliced bacon. Sounds great but it wont cook well.

I used gorgonzola instead of feta and added a little seasoning to the chicken breast....Fantabulous!

Loved this recipe. I substituted 4 to 5 wedges of laughing cow light swiss for the feta cheese and it was delicious. i baked for about half and hour and then put under low broil for about 10 minutes to crisp the bacon. Next time I will try to cook uncovered. My family enjoyed it.

delicioso! fam loved it! saute onions and garlic with salt & pepp. also seasoned chicken w/s & p before i cooked it. since i was cooking 4 six-i sub some of mayo for soy sour cream and used 2 bags of fresh spinach that i cooked w/s&p , also sub. grated parmesan for cheese was'nt sure how the kids would like it. used 2 bags fresh spinach-cooked it w/s&p. had a lot left over so i just put the rest on top of the chicken. next time i will cut chic into strips & layer the spinach that way. it took me a while to butterfly the chicken. also used 1 strip of turkey bacon per breast. but fam likes bacon, so next time i'll use 2 strips

Even though we thought this dish was a little dry, I gave it four stars because it has potential.  The feta/spinach mixture was great.  My whole family prefers chicken thighs, so I think the next time I make this I will pound out boneless chicken thighs, spread the spinach mixture on top and then roll them up.

This recipe was SO GOOD and EASY!  My husband loved it and there were no leftovers!  I substitued fresh parmesan cheese for the feta, since that is what I had on hand.  I also added some salt, pepper and oregano for taste.  I used canned spinach, which was not a problem.  I also only had tenderloins in the fridge, so I took the advice of another reviewer.  I layered the bottom of a square baking dish with the tenderloins, topped them with the spinach mixtured and added a top layer of bacon slices.  It turned out GREAT and best of all, there was no spinach mix left over.  No problems at all altering the recipe and cooking this way versus stuffing the chicken - and it was easier.  Will definitely cook again.  Hubby give it 9 out of 10 stars (which is like 10 stars in his book).

This was a really nice change for dinner. I used mozzarella cheese instead of feta - allergy - and blue cheese wasn't an option because the bf doesn't like it. I added diced red onion, salt, and pepper. I thought it could use a lot more spinach, and maybe sour cream instead of mayo. Overall, it was good, but I'll be changing a few things next time I make it!

This chicken was a hit at our dinner table.  I used light cream cheese in place of the feta and I had fresh spinach on hand that I used, too.  This was fantastic!  I broiled it at the end to get the bacon more crispy.  I served it with fresh green beans.  Awesome!

I used Parmesan instead of feta and four pieces of bacon per chicken breast instead of just one.  I also added some Kosher salt & fresh ground black pepper to the filling.  This was one of the best meals I've made in a long time!  Thank you!

I made this recipe without the bacon.  It was pretty good, but I felt it was missing something.  There wasn't enough flavor for me.  I felt like the flavor of the feta was lost after baking it?

I mixed equal parts light mayo with fat free sour cream and added some fennel. Great way to hide vegetables. It will definitely stay in our recipe list.

this was very tasty!  The house smelled awesome while these were baking in the oven.  I did use Turkey Bacon instead of regular Pork bacon and  fresh spinach (I like how it tastes better than the frozen).  I also sprayed the pan with nonstick spray and I sprayed the top of the breasts to brown them a bit. I'd never stuffed chicken before and this was a nice first attempt.  However, I didn't have enough turkey bacon on hand to wrap the breasts enough to keep the filling in..so I could only use one piece of bacon per breast and then I had to use toothpicks to sew the hole closed.  I'm going to make this again with enough bacon and then I'm sure they'll be 5 stars!

I have made several dishes from this site,but none have gotten such rave reviews from my family.  I felt compelled to rate it.  Everyone wanted this one added to my list of weekly dishes.  It was easy to prepare and went down well with everyone, even my pickiest of picky eaters.  It has been added to the rotation as requested.

WOW! This was soooo good. I didn't use the bacon because I was scared of it making it greasy. I would try it with bacon if I knew what to do to keep the bacon from making everything greasy. I will say though that I made this for 2 servings...but forgot to cut the mayo amount, however it was still sooooo freaking awesome! I will be cooking this again in a week or two.

This recipe was okay. I agree with some of the viewers; the mayo was overwhelming. If I make this again, I will omit the mayo, add two eggs and use mozarella cheese instead of feta.

My husband really enjoyed this one. I was told to make it anytime. I paired it with a greek salad. I followed others advice and pre cooked (1/2 way) bacon, blotted up extra grease before adding to chicken breast. Thank you for a good chicken/spinach pairing.

Great new dish. I will use this again no doubt about it. I did add just a hint of lemon juice fennel seeds and a small handful of real bacon bits to the stuffing - It just seemed like it was going to be so bland without adding a little pinch of something? I used turkey bacon and lite mayo to make it a fraction better for us. I also had left over mix so I just wrapped it up in some bacon pieces with a chunk of pineapple. It turned out great. Next time I will again make the bacon with pineapples to serve with this.

This recipe was fantastic. I followed the recipe and the dish came out wonderful. You may have to watch your chicken depending on your oven. some times it will cook faster and other slower than the recommended time. Thanks for the recipe. I will use this one again.

Very good!  Big hit with my family!  I also made some changes as well.  Omitted bacon, used an egg instead of mayo, added onion to spinach mix, pine nuts and seasoned chicken.

Great Recipe.  The only complaint that I had, was that I found it a bit salty.  But that was for my taste, Everyone else loved it.

Great recipe. I marinated the chicken for a few hours with lemon, garlic, oregano and olive oil (took away the gamey taste). I didn't have any bacon and baked the chicken without it. I mixed sour cream with the spinach instead of mayo. Browning the chicken  before baking is a great idea, but make sure to have the temp. on high to avoid cooking the chicken too much before baking, otherwise it's overcooked.

This was fantastic! I used shredded Mozzarella cheese instead of Feta, because that's what I had on hand, but it was fabulous!!  Of course the appearance of the bacon wrapped stuffed chicken is very professional. My husband was very impressed and he loved it! He kept going on and on about how delicious it was.

We loved this recipe!  Big fans of feta, chicken, bacon...The spinach and wrapping of the bacon to secure the chicken proved to be an attractive presentation.  Delicious!

LOVE this recipe!  Super easy for beginner cooks (like myself!) I'd recommend definitely searing the outside of the chicken, and half-way cooking the bacon first, other wise it's undercooked..or atleast looks that way! Delicious!

I made this for the first time the other day and my husband was looking for left overs the next day...of course there was none. In the Spinach mixture I added a little bit of cream cheese for consistency and like other reviewers I half cooked the bacon and then crumbled on top. It was delicious! If you want to impress your loved one with your cooking try this recipe.

I have a 13 and a 10 year old child that of course like all kids can be picky. I tried this receipe and the hubby AND kids loved it! The only thing I have to say about cooking this is don't overcook the chicken because it will dry out. I definitly added this to my receipe box.

Great w/ the French Leek Cheese Pie.    ADD SALT!  Chicken is always bland.  Would consider marinating chicken in something first that wouldn't overpower the stuffing.

Talk about easy, quick, and delicious.  This was very good. I did what some other folks suggested.  I used 2 eggs instead of mayonaise, I added chopped onion and mushrooms to the stuffing.  I also cooked the bacon half way in the micro (using Costco's maple bacon.)  I only had a little feta cheese so I added blue cheese.  I'll make this again

I liked the recipe alot but I did use alot of the suggestions from everybody.  I butterflied the chicken breast and seasoned it with lemon pepper, garlic powder, and adobo.  I seared it on both sides in olive oil.  I then substituted half of the mayo for sour cream.  I stuffed the breasts.  I microwaved the bacon for four minutes.  I then wrapped the chicken breast. After baking about 15 minutes I brushed the breasts with a lime, olive oil, crushed garlic, and oregano mixture. I baked them for 30 minutes on 350.  I only did it this long because another reviewer said after browning the breasts you only needed to bake for 30 minutes.  I still had to broil for 5 minutes in order to crisp the bacon.  I then served it.  My husband didn't like that the bacon on the bottom looked raw even though I had precooked it in the microwave as suggested.  So I took everbody's chicken back and flipped them over and broiled on the other side for about 3-4 minutes also.  I thought it tasted really good.  I thought I could get my picky husband to eat spinach.  He liked the chicken but still wouldn't eat spinach.

I loved, loved, loved this recipe, using prosciutto wrapped inside the chicken (instead of the outside).  However, next time I will use very thin prosciutto slices and lessen the amount because my husband felt the whole recipe was too salty.

SUPER tasty. My husband loved it. I used fresh spinach instead of frozen since we can't stand frozen spinach, blegh! Didn't need to make any changes to the recipe at all, except more bacon. ^_^

Very tasty...with some changes that is. Spinach stuffing-used 1tblsp of mayo, added 1/4 cup of sour cream, dash of nutmeg, cayanne pepper, 1/3 cup sun dried tomatoes, onion powder, salt/pepper to taste, and of course garlic. Tenderized the chicken breast, stuffed, omitted the bacon. Seasoned the chicken with salt/pepper, poured the lemon/oil mixture (per other reviews).  Baked covered at 350 for 30 mins, uncovered, placed under broiler for 5-8 mins.  Served with roasted potatoes...delish!!!!  I know it sounds like alot of salt, etc, but w/o the changes this would have been bland.  Honestly I tased the spinach mixture before I added the extras...blah.

I totally messed up this recipe, and it was still delicious. I made it in more of a casserole form, since I had already cut apart the chicken breasts. It was wonderful, and very simple to make. Next time, I think I will roll up the chicken breasts the right way, and it will be even better!

Great recipe.  Too much mayo for the recipe.  Also, I tried it with Miracle Whip and that didn't turn out like I thought it would.  I am going to try it with real may next time.  Over all, the chicken was good though.

Fabulous! As others suggested I cooked the bacon partway, basted the chicken with olive oil, and added a little salt and pepper. I also used 1/4 c mayo and 1/4 c sour cream(instead of 1/2 c mayo). I the chicken breasts I used were large, plus I pounded them out a bit. The spinach mixture was the perfect amount. Turned out great!

Great chicken recipe - nice moist and rich with flavor. I did make the following adjustments. I omitted the mayo, browned my garlic and cooked it with my spinach until it wilted and then mixed it w/ the feta cheese and I added 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese.

Wonderful.  I added onion, pepper, basil, oregano to the cheese mixture.  Also, as others mentioned, I did coat the outside of the chicken with olive oil, lemon, spice mix, and cooked bacon in microwave for 4 minutes before wrapping the chicken.  This way, the bacon is completely cooked.

We loved these! To make them healthier, I omitted the bacon and just seasoned them with garlic powder, salt and pepper. I sauteed 1 minced garlic clove and an entire chopped onion, and after letting it cool, added it to the spinach and mayo mixture (I had some non-fat sour cream in the fridge so I ended up using about 1/3 sour cream to 2/3 mayo which also cut down on the fat factor). My boyfriend LOVED the filling and there is plenty left to mix with artichokes and a bit more sour cream to make a dip with!

The reason I give it 5 stars is because my "I hate every kind of vegetable" 5-years-old son ate T-W-I-C-E...spinach stuffing and everything! I would definitely season the chicken or the filling with garlic salt or salt and pepper. I used boneless thighs (more moisture), stuffed six of them and had a surplus of the filling. I added more garlic. Feta cheese is NOT overpowering, it blends perfectly.

Use fresh spinach sauted with onion, garlic, add sun dried tomatoes. add to feta cheese and along with sun dried tomatoes.  Omit bacon - dredge chicken roll up in egg white, then bread crumbs.  Bake at 350 for 20 min.

I just cooked this for the first time for dinner today and it turned out delicious. Both I and my husband loved it. I followed the recipe. I used mediterranean feta cheese b/c that's what I had. I added a little garlic and pepper seasoning and onion salt too. I baked @ 375 FOR 50-55 min. and then broiled it for 3-5 minutes to cook the bacon all the way. Mash potatoes on the side. I'll send in a photo later. Looks as good as it tastes:)

I loved it. After wrapping the chicken in bacon I pan fried the bacon so the chicken absorbed the juices, then I baked it. It was wonderful.

Really enjoyed. I didn't have enough feta, so added some shredded Italian cheese mix. Also, drizzled a bit of olive oil, salt, pepper & oregano over chicken breasts. Be sure not to overcook!! Will make again - easy to modify any way you like. will try some of the other suggestions.

I think this was the best chicken that I made so far because it was very tasty and not too satly. I didn't wrap any bacon around the chicken but I put them close together. I thought that the combination of all these ingredients made it so wonderful. I'm going to be making even more again for supper tonight with potatoes and veggies.

Very tasty and easy to make.  I used Blue Cheese because that's what I had and it was still very tasty.  I added this to my regular rotation and it is nice to have something a little fancy for everyday meals.

Super yummy! I am making this again. Make sure to create pouches for your stuffing so the breasts stay nice and moist. I fallowed the directions exactly except for maybe adding some salt and pepper on the outside. Just loved this recipe.

This recipe is great. I also added canned mushrooms that were drained. I ended up with leftover filling so decided to put it in some crescent rolls. They were wonderful. Makes a great appetizer.

This was a very good recipe. You must be a bacon lover in order to appreciate the flavor. My bf loved it (and loves the taste of bacon), I did not LOVE it but thought it was very good (Iam not a bacon lover). The chicken cooks in bacon fat and sucks in all the bacon flavor.

Wow! My husband and I absolutely loved this. I'd always thought stuffing chicken breasts would be tough but it was so easy! I used fresh spinach, microwaved briefly and then chopped coursly. I will cut down on the mayo a bit next time. My husband didn't want garlic in his and boy did he miss out. Wrapping it in a bacon is a must!  When serving I spooned a bit of the sauce in the pan on top of each one. This is a keeper and a company meal! Thanks.

Not a bad recipe. I think I used light mayonnaise that wasn't very good, so that made a big difference, I'm sure. Next time I might substitute something else. I also used minced garlic instead of fresh and then precooked the bacon almost all the way. I sprayed the pan with a LOT of Pam and then covered it with foil before I put it in the oven.

Even though I changed a few things about this recipe, it was awesome. I used fresh spinach and sauteed it with garlic in olive oil. I also used prosciutto instead of bacon, we didn't have bacon. Then I had to use Mircle Whip instead of Mayo (didn't have Mayo). My parents who don't like to really try new things loved it. My dad went back for seconds. Great recipe.

I found the chicken dry and felt the spinach needed more zip, maybe more garlic, a touch of nutmeg or something.  If I made it again I would definitely try flavoring it up and cooking it just a little less time.

The filling was great but I felt like the chicken was a little dry. If I try it again, I would probably try the other suggestions about the olive oil over the top.

I TOOK THIS RECIPE AND ALSO TOOK INTO CONSIDERATION THE REVIEWS.  I ADDED LEMON PEPPER TO THE CHEESE MIX.  MY YOUNGEST DAUGHTER DOESN'T EAT RED MEAT, SO I WRAPPED HERS WITH TURKEY BACON, WHICH COOKED UP MUCH BETTER THAN TRADITIONAL BACON, WHILE STILL RENDERING THE SMOKY FLAVOR.  EXCELLENT!

Made this over the weekend, I pre cooked the bacon about half way, I didnt think it made it greasy like another reviewer said but I also used a good bacon, also added some onion powder and Italian herb blend to the mix, not bad at all.

This was just okay. My family didn't care for it. They didn't care for the feta cheese taste. Maybe next time I'll try a different cheese.

Good but needs salt and pepper! Recipe didn't call for it, and I thought the feta and the bacon would be all the saltiness it needed. Next time I will S&P the stuffing and the chicken before I wrap it in bacon.  Good though.

I make this a lot.  I don't add mayonnaise but a little fresh breadcrumbs, a beaten egg to help bind it, and some pine nuts.

I have made this recipe many times and it is great!  You can use fresh spinach as well, microwave it to soften and squeeze the moisture out.  It is a yummy recipe for guests too and very easy to prepare!

This was a huge hit with my family.  Very tasty!!!  Will definitely make again and again.  Be careful not to over-cook the chicken.  Thanks for the recipe.

My husband was skeptical about the mayo, but sticking with the original recipe was the right decision.  He and I both loved it so much now it's a regular for our dinners.  Also served it when we had another couple for dinner (kinda picky eaters) and they raved about how amazing it was!

AH-MA-ZING!  I made quite a few revisions, though. Instead of mayo, I used 1 part mayo to 3 parts plain yogurt. Instead of feta I used a grated Italian cheese blend. I used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic so I wouldn't have to sautee anything. I also added a bit of salt and pepper as well as chili powder added to the mixture then added an egg to bind the mixture. I boiled my chicken until still raw in the middle then butterflied, stuffed, and baked them, covered, for 25 minutes. I omitted the bacon.

I also mixed sour cream and shredded mozzarella cheese into the feta cheese mixture. I also baked it covered for 30 minutes then uncovered for 30. The chicken remained moist, and the tops were a little browned. I also sprinkled italian bread crumbs on top of the bacon. It was fabulous! No left overs with this one.

Delicious....I used reduced fat feta and turkey bacon. These were so tasty and my family loved them for Easter dinner. I made 4 and still have 2 leftover! They were huge and very filling. Will make again. Thanks!

My family and dinner guests loved this!  I made this for a Greek dinner party I was having and I got rave reviews. I also fixed Charlotte's Tortellini Salad as a side dish and Greek Honey Cake as dessert.

GREAT!!! I used fresh spinach, and miracle whip instead of mayo. Also added a chopped roma tomatoe and a tiny bit of red pepper. Coated the chicken breast with a various mix of spices (oregeno (italian blend), garlic powder, peprika, pepper, celery salt) and wrapped with 2 slices of bacon per breast. Cooked for only 30 minutes and came out absolutely delicious. Best chicken ive ever made!!

4 stars only b/c i changed so much. No baking involved - wanted a quicker meal. *omitted bacon overall. *first saute an onion, 2-3 chopped garlic cloves, and seasoning. Added stuffing mix, 1 box of frozen spinach and water as needed. i kept that on low/warm covered as i went to next step. *Instead of baking chicken, i took a few frozen skinless/boneless tenders (breasts could be used too) and coated with bread crumbs and cooked on pan. *Layed the breaded chicken on spinach/stuffing mix and garnished with grated parmesean cheese. So yum!

I used some ideas from other comments, and this recipe is just fabulous. I used reduced fat sour cream instead of mayo, and fresh baby spinach (steamed), I also tucked the bacon in the pocket with the filling. Came out moist and tender, and my five year old cleaned his plate (that alone makes this 5 stars).

This recipe was wonderful! I took some suggestions from other reviewers and added an egg and sauted onion to the spinach mixture and used half sour cream and half mayo. I also browned the chicken in a non-stick frying pan before putting it in the oven and cut the baking time to 30 minutes. The spinach mixture is also good for a dip with tortilla chips!!

Yum! The only thing I changed was to cut the cooking time to 30 min. (I think mine were a little on the thinner side) and then I put the oven on broil for about 7 minutes. Served it with garlic smashed potatoes and a big salad...we loved every bite!

Awsome...but next time I will use half feta and half white cheese (mozz or colby jack)and possibly sour cream instead of mayonaise, also when I cooked them in the oven in a baking dish I didn't like the fact that the juices that collected in the dish kinda boiled the chicken gave the chicken less flavor. Next time I will prob try to cook the breasts on a rack in the oven and have something under the rack to catch the juices.

Very Good - and not a whole lot of prep!! I didn't have feta, so I just used a mixture of mozzarella and parmasean - also used a little egg white, just to hold it together and it worked perfectly.

It was pretty good, my boyfriend really liked it. I only used half of the spinich mixture, next time I think I'll cut back at least half of the spinich. I would like to make it creamier, and a sauce for the top. I added extra seasoning, but I like everything seasoned.

So very easy and tasty.  The first bite was a little bland but after a few more I couldn't believe how good it was.  Perhaps those who thought it was dry were trying to crisp the bacon.  A definate do again soon meal.

This recipe deserves 50 billion stars. My exceedingly picky husband is still raving about it a week later. It was also so easy to put together. I pounded the chicken breasts instead of butterflying, and it only needed to bake for ~30 minutes. I also broiled for 5 minutes at the end and the bacon was perfectly crisp.

I thought that this was an amazing recipe. I did follow the advice about using olive oil and lemon to baste it with-it turned out beautiful and delicious.

Turned out well.  I did not use the mayo or the bacon and it was still moist and flavourful.  Before putting it into the oven, I seasoned with salt, pepper and oil to give it a good crust when it was finished.  I cooked it uncovered in the oven at 400F for 35 minutes and then broiled for about 10.

Very good as written.  I have also substituted sour cream for the mayo and have partially cooked the bacon (prior to wrapping the chicken) to give it some crispness.  My little boys loved this, too.  Yum!

My husband told me he loved them without even tasting them. These were honestly so great and easy to make. The pictures do no justice, I'm not a great cook or anything and mine looked much more put together than the pictures. The bacon added a great flavor. Thanks for such a great recipe! Definite 5 Stars!

Delicious and healthy! I have wrapped thick-cut pepper bacon around the chicken to add a little extra flare. What a great way to incorporate a variety of ingredients into one dish!

I would have preferred this stuffed with something other than spinach; I found the flavor bitter and strong.  The chicken would have benefited from a sauce to poach in.  The bacon didn't crisp as I hoped, and I didn't want to broil it for fear the chicken would be tough. Next time I'd broil the bacon and crumble it on top.

I'm rating this 4 stars because I did make a few changes.      After pounding out the chicken breast I seasoned the chicken with a bit of salt, pepper and onion powder.  I used Kale  because I did not have spinach.  This dish has so much flavor, very good and easy breezy to make.  Don't forget to put it under the broiler for about five minutes to crisp up the bacon in the end.  Delicious!!  Thank you :o)

I like the "idea" of this so much that I had to modify it to try & get it very healthy.  In its origin, I like it and the kids like it.  It is even better with; fresh steamed spinich with almonds and fresh minced Garlic, 1/2c Cream Cheese (Nuefchatel), 1/2c Havarti or Smoked Guda (crumbled), Boarshead Beef Bacon & brown (sear)the chicken breasts prior to baking in olive oil.  It is also GREAT over brown rice with steamed vegies mixed in!

This recipe took a lot of work, and it looked totally awesome going into the oven - but in the end the filling wasn't as flavorful as the calorie count demanded, although it was still acceptable.  Bacon was good, though... bacon is always good.

I would definetly brown the bacon strips before wrapping the chicken. Also, I laid the bacon down in an "X" pattern on the the baking dish and then I placed the breast on top of the bacon. It made rolling the breast alot easier!! I also had to broil for a few minutes to brown the chicken. I had some of the mixture left over which I used for stuffed shells!!!! Great recipe.

This tastes amazing and looks oh so fancy! Even tastes good the next day to bring to work! I followed the advice of sauteeing the chicken after it comes out of the oven in a nonstick pan sprayed with a butter flavored Pam until I got the light golden color I wanted and then threw the sauce into the pan for about 5 minutes on a low flame. I also followed the advice of using Turkey bacon as a healthier option. I'm not a big fan of feta cheese, so instead I used shredded mozarella. Enjoy!

I sort of combined this recipe with "Feta Chicken" from this site.  I placed the mayo/feta mixture onto very thin slices of chicken and rolled it up.  Then I covered the chicken rolls with italian breadcrumbs.  It didn't hurt to add some garlic salt either!  I ended up with a cooking time of 50 minutes and the meat stayed moist. Next time I may cut back on the mayo some and add a little more feta cheese for flavor.  I have made this recipe exactly as written, and I agree with others that the chicken is too bland.  The bacon does not season it as well as you might think.  If you follow the recipe, you definitely need to add some garlic salt or something to the chicken.

Excellent.  I impressed my chef boyfriend with this one! A few minor changes...some on purpose...some by accident.  I used thin chix breast so did not need to butterfly it. I used 1/3 cup mayo and 1/3 cup feta...instead of the suggested 1/4 cup (whoops...but I would actually do it this way again).  I also added a small amount of chopped bella mushrooms and vidalia onion to the spinach mixture...wrapped the breast with 1.5 slices of bacon each....dashed a bit of oregano...and baked uncovered for about an hour.  The middle was a little dry in my opinion...so next time I might reduce the cooking time by a bit. Served with basmati rice cooked in vegetable broth..and side salad. Added a glass of white wine...just perfect!

I pounded the chicken as others suggested, used fresh spinach through the food processor, used 2 stips bacon and added to the stuffing chopped sun dried tomatoes in oil.  Yummy!  Thank you for the delicious meal!

Made this last night.  It was a to hit!  The four of us ate all of it.  So yummy and tender.  I added chopped onions and Mrs. Dash and Oregano for extra flavoring.  It's so good I can eat the leftover filling by itself.  Might try pita bread with the leftover filling.

Very Very Good!! I put cooked turkey bacon in the filling, not on the outside as i wasn't sure how it would turn out. I did baste the chicken with olive oil/oregano/lemon as suggested by others. It turned out pretty white, but it was very good!! This is a new favorite for company!

Excellent recipe... We all loved it, a great way to get the little ones to eat their spinach.  This is my second time making it and I plan on making this a regular in our household.  I used feta cheese with roasted red peppers.  The first time I used feta cheese with garlic and herb.

This was fantastic. I followed this recipe to a "T" except for one thing. I flattened the breasts and spread the cheese mixture over it and then rolled it. There was filling all throughout. I did have one of my kids not like it, but the other 3 loved it. So, I would suggest that you make sure you like Feta Cheese first and then make this dish. You probably won't like this if you don't like Feta.

My boyfriend loves chicken and I am always looking for new ideas on how to fix it.  This was definitely it! He said it was fabulous. The spinach mix was delicious and very easy to make.  I will definitely make this again.  It also would be a great recipe for company...it looks very impressive!

This was really good and really easy. I also added some pepper and squeezed lemon juice into the stuffing and on top of the chicken. I didn't even need the toothpicks and I placed the chicken on a wire rack in a baking sheet so the a lot of the grease dripped off. Very good, thanks.

This was an easy dish to prepare.  I took the advice of others and pounded the chicken til it was a nice flat breast (easier for stuffing) after stuffing the breasts, I squeezed a whole lemon with fresh chopped garlic and a dash of olive oil to top off the final product. It turned out delicious, easy to make, and quite frugal on the pocket book! according to my new boyfriend, 5 STARS!

Delicious and attractive!  I added sauteed mushrooms and lemon juice to the stuffing.  Uncovering the chicken for the last 10 minutes in the oven made the chicken tender but crispier on top.  You could easily prepare this the night before and bake the next day.

I pulled the receipe a few months ago before I became a member today.  I have made it a number of times since.  I love it.  It's easy and has only a few ingredients - something that's a definite plus for me.  I made a few changes: I used mozzarella cheese because I always have that on hand.  I sprinkle chicken with lemon juice and lemon pepper seasoning. And I add a little olive oil in the dish.  Wonderful!  Thanks so much for a delicious dish.

Very good recipe, love the taste of the spinach and I added sliced portabellas to my version.  Portabellas add a healthy way to fill you up.

This was great with some mushroom pasta I made to go along side of it.  I used basil and red pepper feta cheese and it complemented the chicken and spinach well.

I made this a couple weeks ago, and am just now getting around to do the review. I didn't have bacon, (Next time I make it I will make sure to have some, as I can see how nicely the flavors would go together) but I used the recommended filling. Very tasty! I served it with Potatoes Au Gratin, and they made a perfect pair. Really good stuff!

Baked in about half the time and each chicken breast needed at least two strips of bacon; could've used three! But it was tasty and will try again.

I was sure that I would love this recipe, but found it to be a bit too salty for my taste.  I think maybe I overdid it on the feta or something.  Definitely a keeper though.

I gave it only 3 stars because the chicken was fairly bland.  Everyone ate it, but I don't think they will be asking for it to reappear on the menu soon.

This has by far become one of our all time favorite recipies. Especially if company is coming because it makes a beautiful presentation. We usually use just cream cheese for the mixture (just not big fans of mayo) and it tastes great! We use the garlic & herb feta cheese. Although the bacon never comes out very crisp I agree it is necessary for the flavor value and to hold the mixture inside the chicken. Overall one of the best we've come across. Thanks Laurie for sharing!

Incredible!!!  I used parm cheese instead of feta (personal preference) and light mayo.  It turned out really good.

I made this for my roomates and they absolutely loved it!  To make it a little more healthy I used light mayo and turkey bacon.  It was great.  They told me I needed to "hold on to this one".

This recipe has a tasty filling but I found when you scaled it down for two people there was way to much filling if you are using small to normal size chicken breasts.

I started making this recipe 5 years ago when I was a newlywed who didn't know how to cook.  Not only is it easy, but it is delicious.  I even made it for my first dinner party, and it was a knockout.  It is still a favorite in my house.

This was an excellent recipe to get my 11 year old to eat spinach. This dish was fun to prepare. It makes a beautiful presentation and my husband gave it rave reviews. The only thing I wished for was a more golden color for the chicken and slightly crisper bacon.

I love this recipe and make it often.  I don't keep bacon in the house, so I've never used it in the recipe.  When the chicken is done, I take the juice and add some chicken broth, black pepper, a chopped green onion and some cornstarch to thicken. If no (or not enough) feta cheese has leaked out, I add a few crumbles.  I pour it over or mix it with cooked rice and it tastes great.

Awesome tasting & beautiful presentation!!  Easy too!!  I cut down on the mayo, just used 1/2 tbsp light mayo + 1/2 tbsp low-fat sour cream for each breast and it tasted WONDERFUL!  Also used bacon bits in the stuffing instead of wrapping with bacon........ two big thumbs up!!  Will definitely make again!  Delicious served with brown rice.

This is a very quick, easy, delicious weeknight recipe. Like some of the other reviewers, I baked the chicken, covered, at 400 degrees for about 35 minutes. Then, I placed it under the broiler for about 3-5 minutes per side, just to crisp up the bacon. The chicken was very tender and juicy! 
The only change I made was to add 3-4 chopped sundried tomatoes to the filling. They made a delicious addition.

I had some boneless chicken thighs in the fridge and used this recipe for them instead of using breasts. I also used sour cream instead of mayo cause I did not have any. It was very good and I will make again. My kids loved it as well as the hubby. I found that I had to drain it a couple of times though because of all the fat from the bacon.

I used fresh cooked spinach-rince, cover and heat in saucepan over medium heat, don't add water, the water on the leaves is enough-takes about 3 minutes) and was a little short so I added grated carrot-Delicious!

This was very good.  Between a 4 & 5.  We're going to add a little more garlic and feta next time.  As well, allow to set longer for the flavors of the stuffing to blend together.  We also used 2 strips of bacon per breast.  Very tasty.

Great recipe! The bacon on the under side was a little undercooked with only cooking 1 hr. I'll let it go a few minutes longer next time. It was a hit other than that.

I omitted the bacon and cooked my chicken for only 35 minutes.  The chicken was too dry.  It was probably user error so I will attempt this recipe again, hopefully with better luck.

this was not our favorite.
i didn't like the taste the bacon added to it and i felt like the actual chicken needed some seasoning (i did pepper it a little but that wasn't enough). the filling also would have been better with less mayo and more feta and maybe something else added to it. some sort of sauce would be nice too.

This recipe was excellent, but I changed it a little.  I didn't have enough feta so I used a combination of mozzarella, grated romano and herbed feta.  I had eight chicken breasts, so I doubled everything except the spinach.  I also broiled it for a few minutes at the end to brown things up.  Make sure you squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can.

As suggested by others, I used 1/4 cup sour cream and 1/4 cup Miracle Whip.  Used 2 slices of bacon per chicken breast.  Baked at 375 for 35 mintues, then broiled for 10 minutes.  This will become a regular recipe in our household!!  EXCELLENT!

This was fabulous.  I'm always looking for ways to make baked chicken less "blah," and this was great.  I also substitued mozzerella cheese for the feta due to a finicky husband, and it was a hit.

This was a very good recipe and I will definitely be making it again.  I used half mayo/half sour cream and omitted the bacon and I found that worked well.  Next time I will try sprinkling the chicken with oregano and lemon juice.

I used fresh baby spinach, but I still found this recipe just OK.  It came out really dry and I didn't cook it for the full hour.  I would definately cut down on the cooking time.

This recipe was very good.  My whole family enjoyed it.  The feta cheese was not overpowering and the mixture between that and the spinach was a nice blend.  Thanks!

These had a good flavor but the presentation wasn't what I had hoped for.  I used fresh torn spinach instead of frozen and pounded the chicken very flat and rolled it up with the ingredients.  Perhaps that is why it didn't look as appealing as others reviewers suggested.  Anyway...it is a good recipe that I will using again and adding some variations to it to try some new things.

Easy and taste great!  I only made one slight change by adding blue cheese with the feta.  Great find for us low carb dieters.
