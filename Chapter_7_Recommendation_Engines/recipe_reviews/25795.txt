I like the crispy peanut topping and marshmallow parts better than the base which is like a soft cookie. The topping isn't easy to spread as directed I ended up dumping it all into the pan and then pressing it down with a greased piece of waxed paper. I used cocktail peanuts instead of dry roasted and the nuts don't seem salty like you find in a "Payday" candy bar. I think they would make an interesting (but rich!) dessert with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top.
