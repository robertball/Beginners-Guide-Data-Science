Mmmm, these are good!  My husband ate them all up quickly.  I am not into all traditional Chinese food, but these were just so flavorful that I couldn't resist!  I also brined the pork to make it super super tender (only brine non-Kosher meat or meat that hasn't already been treated with salt - just check the label).  For 4 bone-in rib loin pork chops (12 ounces each), 1 1/2 inches thick, you will dissolve 3 tablespoons of salt and 3 tablespoons of sugar in 1.5 quarts of water in a container large enough to hold the meat.  You may need to add more water/salt/sugar in the same proportions until the meat is completely submerged.  Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour.  Then remove the pork from the brine, rinse, and pat dry with paper towels.  The meat is now ready to be cooked.  Source: The America's Test Kitchen Family Cookbook

I was looking for a rib recipe that was not BBQ (and thus not as sugary).  These were great.  Kids loved them.  Husband asked me to make them again less than a week later.  I did nit marinate the ribs.  Just cooked them in the sauce (plus 1/2 c water) in the crockpot on high for 6 hrs, then broiled them in the oven to crisp them up a bit.  Wonderful!

I thought the flavor and the smell of these ribs were very good.  They were easy to make as well.  The ribs I used (Pork Spare Ribs) were larger than called for and rather fatty, which made this recipe less than perfect, but that was my choice.

Really tasty but dried out a lot.  Would make again but am wondering whether to try cooking in marinade?.....

Very good and predictable.  I did cook it with the marinade in the pan.  After roasting an hour I poured off the drippings, separated and strained the juice and made a sauce with a little cornstarch.  Added just a touch of sugar as well.  Yummy.

Excellent recipes.  Very easy to make.  The only change I made was I substituted white wine vinegar for white cooking wine since that was all I had.  Our 15 year old grandson filled his plate twice, leaving us with three single ribs each.  Guess he liked them.  :-)

Very good, but don't forget to turn the ribs as they will dry out and get too crispy.

The ribs were phenomenal. I used three pounds of Saint Louis Style ribs cut into individual ribs and I doubled the marinade to make I had enough to cover the extra ribs. I made my own five spice powder. Otherwise I followed the recipe. They gave off a wonderful aroma while cooking and the meat nearly fell off the bones. These are some of the best oven baked ribs I have had. My wife liked them but thought they were only OK. I will be making these again even if only for myself. Thank you for sharing.

My hudband loved this! This recipe is definitely a keeper. I used boneless country ribs. We LOVE ginger and garlic so I added an extra teaspoon of each. I cooked it on low in a crock pot for 7 hours then placed the ribs in a pan in the oven uncovered as directed in the 2nd part of the baking  process. Thanks for sharing the recipe! :)

I baked the ribs a bit longer so the internal temp was 190 F so the meat would fall off the bones.  Delicious!

Turned out quite well. I had time to I put it in the oven at 295 degrees for 3 hours and then turned it to 400 degrees for the last 20-30 minutes and took the cover off.  The meat fell off the bone and was quite tasty

Delicious. My family enjoyed not having the messy sauce and the taste was great. I browned them on the bbq grill after the oven as we all like crispy fat. I did add a little lime juice to the marinade.

I think the recipe is heavy on garlic and honey.  
Garlic didnâ€™t handle the long slow cooking heat and the honey was too clawing

I loved the smell of the ribs as they were cooking!  I rotated them after 30 minutes then I took them out of the oven after 1 hour.  I drained off all the drippings into a small pan and warmed up the sauce adding one tablespoon of brown sugar and cornstarch.  I placed the ribs back in the oven at 425F and let them cook for an additional 20 minutes.  I poured the sauce over the ribs as they came out of the oven. They cooked well and looked fantastic but I thought they could have been a bit sweeter!

I added cumin because I did not have enough five spices powder. But this recipe is great! I would've liked the ribs to be softer so maybe 10 more minutes in the oven next time!

The taste was very good, even though I didn't have the time to marinate it as long as suggested.  The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is because they were a little dry for our taste, despite making more marinade than the recipe called for.

These didn't taste bad, but they didn't taste good either.  In fact, even after the full marinating time, they didn't taste like much of anything.  They were tender, but that's about all I can say about this recipe.
