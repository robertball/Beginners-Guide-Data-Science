Instead of room temp, u can actually place it in the ref for about 30-1hr. When you fry it, it will be really crispy! This is one of the sinful yummy foods you'll ever taste

Just made this. I loved the yummy aroma it made but was a little disappointed because it didn't turned as crispy as I expected it to be.  The other commenter was right, I should've refrigerated first before frying.  Also, the flavor was a bit bland. Had to add an extra dash of garlic salt and pepper after frying.
