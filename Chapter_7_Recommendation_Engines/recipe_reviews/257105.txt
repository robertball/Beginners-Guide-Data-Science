The flavor was great.  After the suggested hour of cooking time the potatoes were still too firm so I let it simmer another hour and it came out great, especially on top of couscous.

The cod was cooked to perfection, flaky but not fall apart. This emits amazing aromas while it's cooking.

Kinda boring.  It nearly enough spice in the recipe to make it interesting.

what a wonderful dish. The prep-time takes a while but the flavors are amazing.
I added more cilantro and more ginger and spices to the recipe than it calls for which intensified the  flavors even more. 
Love this dish. 
You can substitute the potatoes with cauliflower rice, I  will  try couscous next time.

We are on diets here so I followed the directions to the letter. There were no “delightful” smells while cooking. The only flavor was the cod, the spices added nothing. It seemed like a waste of the Cod.
