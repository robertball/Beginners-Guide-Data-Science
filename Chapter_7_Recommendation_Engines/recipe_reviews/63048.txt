I was very happy with the taste, but it didn't set up as nicely as I would have liked. It was a little too loose. Next time I will puree the strawberry layer as well.

Very good - especially with a graham crumb crust.  Looks impressive and tastes light.

This was a delicious and easy to make pie.  Everyone thought it was terrific and very flavorful and light.  I'd recommend making the glaze as well, it added a lot of fruity flavor and was a nice complement to the pie.  I'd definately suggest this recipe, for those who want a sugarless alternative, or for those who just want a flavorful, light desert.  My only complaint was that it wasn't very firm.

Delicious!  I didn't have vanilla yogurt on hand though, so I substituted lemon yogurt, and then cut back the lemon juice to 1/2 teaspoon.  I also used a graham cracker crust instead, purely as personal preference.
