I have to tell you--my husband told me he liked raspberry thumbprint cookies so I decided to surprise him with a batch tonight when he gets home from work.  I knew what they looked like, but when I pulled up this recipe, I was surprised to see these had a glaze and white chocolate chunks in them.  I made them and they are one of the best tasting cookies I have baked in a long time!  And oh, so cute, when I drizzled the glaze over them.  They took some time to make but I would say it's worth it.  My advice is to try this recipe and you will be delighted.  They are soft and tasty.  (Oh, yes, the recipe didn't say how to prepare the pan.  I found out you must grease the baking pan or else they will stick.  I sprayed mine with cooking oil.)

These are awesome, but don't store them in a ziplock bag or they'll get mushy.

I highly recommend doubling this recipe.  They are beyond yummy!  My kids kept eating them before I could get the glaze on.  They are gorgeous too.  I'm going to add these to my special Christmas cookies I make every year.

Can't say enough about these.  Thanks!

These weren't bad but found they lacked in flavor - i would have preferred them a bit sweeter. I also had a hard time with timing them in the oven, first batch i baked for time suggested in the recipe but found the centers weren't baked. Not sure if i'll try again.

These cookies are definitely a big hit. People are impressed and love them. However, these are a lot of work for sure, and I had a bit of a hard time with these at first, so I have the following tips:   1. refrigerate the dough so it is easier to handle before you bake the cookies,   2. in my opinion, the best dough to jam ratio is 1/2 tbsp of dough to 1/2 tsp of jam,   3. using my fingers to make the indents didn't work for me so I used the back of the 1/2 teaspoon making sure there is enough dough left at the bottom so the jam doesn't seep through.  Give yourself lots of time to make these and then enjoy the delicious result!

I don't really like white chocolate, so every where it called for white chocolate I used dark chocolate. It worked wonderfully! Also, an 8-10 cook time worked great for me. I think the 5 minutes the cookies cool on the sheet really help them get done.

I initially made these to add to my baked-good gifts.  But My husband and I ended up eating almost half of them before I got them out!!  They are SO good!  I intend making more and doubling the recipe to ensure some make it into the cookie tins this time!! :)

Good cookies!  The prep time is defininitely high, but they're mmm mmm good :)  I would recommend baking them for longer than suggested... about 12-14 min.

These cookies were great.  I made them slightly smaller and used strawberry preserves instead (I find raspberry sometimes too tart).  Even with the white chocolate in the dough these are not too sweet.  And the white chocolate glaze adds a nice sweetness and pizazz in eye appeal.  I'd make these again

Good, but the oats add a weird texture - one that you don't expect from a thumbprint.  I can't really taste the white chocolate, but I did chop it pretty fine, so that the cookies would hold their shape.  I took another reviewer's advice and chilled the dough before baking.  They are definitely a pretty cookie, especially for this time of year.  But for the amount of work and end flavor, I probably won't be making these again.

These are my favorite cookies! My husband loves white chocolate, and these were perfect for him! I added 1 tsp of double strength pure vanilla extract and 1 tbsp of honey to the sugar/butter mixture, and used white chocolate chips. I also added thin sliced almonds, and it was fantastic. I wanted a variety, so I used strawberry preserves, blueberry preserves, and pineapple spread. All turned out fabulous, but the blueberry was the best to me. Not too difficult or time-consuming of a recipe. I have made these countless time and will certainly continue to make again and again!

These were really good tasting cookies although I found that I didn't like the white chocolate pieces in the actual cookie part, and that the cookie dough itself seemed dry.

Very soft and tasty cookie.  I was surprised how well the jam stayed put in a small well and the cookie held together.  I added 1 tsp of vanilla for personal flavor preference. I sprayed the baking sheet before use and then did not between batches.  The cookies stuck a bit but not enough to damage them.  The glaze made them extra attractive and just a bit tastier.  These are very special and I will definitely give them as gifts!

They are yummy. I did bake them about 15 minutes on parchment paper.  No sticking and lightly golden.  I used blueberry preserves and a tsp. of lemon extract for variety. I still have to glaze them and may do a confectioners sugar with lemon juice icing...not sure and the cookies are still hot.

These were just okay for me - I would have liked a sweeter base cookie, whereas this was a bit dry and bland like shortbread.  Combined with the raspberry and white chocolate, they are overall a good cookie, but needs a little tweaking.

next time i'd skip the milk and add some vanilla to the dough - otherwise too sticky.  i didn't add the white chocolate and reduced sugar to 3/4 cups - it was sweet enough.  ps - needs much longer to bake and does better at 375

I was pretty disappointed with these cookies - the delicious name is very deceiving. There is hardly any flavour and they dont' even look nice! I recommend finding another recipe.

This reccipe was a huge disappointment. The batter spread all over the baking stones and the cookies ended up huge and uncooked (or burned) in the middle. I threw the rest of the dough away after the first trays.

I added half cup of chopped pecans. Had to bake a few minutes more since I chilled dough before baking. A different taste and not as rich using part sour cream. I like it!

These were good. I used plum preserves and didn't bother with the glaze - they don't need it. I rated it down a star because they are a little doughy. Can't figure out why and it's probably my fault. But even so they are delicious and I plan on whipping up another batch soon.

This recipe is delicious. It made 42 cookies and I took them to my book club and brought home zero. I did leave off the glaze as I thought the cookies were perfect without it. I am making more tomorrow for a Friday meeting. This time I'm filling some of them with fig preserves and some with pineapple preserves. Well worth the effort

I only made the glaze (used it for a different recipe) and I'd definitely recommend adding less sugar to it (if any). The white chocolate is sweet enough!

Good start to a terrific cookie. After reading all of the reviews, and having many people say they tasted bland I made the following changes: Omitted the chopped white chocolate chips, added 1 t. almond extract to the dough, chilled dough before placing on Silpat lined cookie sheets. Baked for 12 minutes. Delicious. They turned out very nicely. It sounds from the reviews that the almond extract was really needed. The other changes were just my preferences. Will be making these again.

The oats were a mistake in this recipe, would be much better without. Sorry.

These were good but a lot of work.  Also, the jam ran onto the cookie sheet because the cookie itself did not keep its shape in order to hold in the jam. I also felt there were too many oats in the cookie. Next time I will fill the cookies after they bake. Since they will be hot after you take them out of the oven, making a small indentation in the top of the cookie and then filling it would create less mess.

Good cookies. Thank you for the recipe. I gave it a 4 because it wasn't sweet enough without the addition of a little more sugar. But I do like it that it incorporates the oats! My suggestions: Add 1/4 c more sugar, 1 t vanilla and 1/2 t salt. Be sure to make small cookies - the ratio between jam and cookie is nicer. They do spread - I tried them on an oiled stone and then on parchment as suggested - there was no difference in the spread. Good with and without the white chocolate or the glaze. Now I'm going to freeze my leftover dough in rolls. I'll slice it thinly, bake till crispy, and we'll make ice cream sandwiches out of it with the grandkids!
