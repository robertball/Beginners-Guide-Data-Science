My recipe is very similar. My little ones gobble them up. I use raisins instead of chocolate chips and put the oats and raisins through the food chopper. The finer oatmeal texture helps the smaller bite size balls hold together better and the kids who say they don't like oatmeal don't know it's what they are eating. I have also substituted  wheat germ for flax meal

These are very easy and yummy.  I added a banana to this recipe and I made it with almond butter and added a banana. So good.
