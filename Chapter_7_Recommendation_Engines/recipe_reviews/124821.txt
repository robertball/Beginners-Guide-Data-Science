Thank goodness for the experience that more than 50 years of cooking gives you.  Were it not for those 50 years, and I prepared this as written, it would have been a very expensive "crab catastrophe."  Geez - A TABLESPOON of ground mustard!?!  Knowing right off the bat that this would totally ruin the salad, I cut it back by a third and it was STILL too mustard-y.  I also didn't mix in the full amount of the dressing as that, too, would have totally obliterated the taste of the crab, and very expensive crab at that.  I only mixed in enough of the dressing to sort of hold it together.  Also, to cut the amount of heat and spice in the dressing caused by the excessive amount of mustard, I added some sweet pickle relish, which proved to be a good call and a reasonably good "save."  Great ingredients and great recipe...in theory.  BUT - a recipe should not be rated on how it turned out after you tweaked it but on how it stands on it's own.  Tweaked, a definite four stars.  On it's own, sadly, a lone one star.

Excellent salad,Mrs. Mayer. The dressing was outstanding and really complimented the crab.For a colorful presentation, I garnished with black olive slices and minced sweet red pepper.The lemon, egg, green onion and celery enhanced this perfect luncheon entree.

I served this on a spinach salad. I cut this recipe in half, omitting the green pepper and all salt in the crab mixture and the chili sauce and garnishes in the sauce. I think I would have liked it better w/out the ground mustard, but rather spicy mustard and just adjust the amount of mayo. Good dinner for a hot night!

Delicious.  Just like Crab Louis, which I was looking for.  Did not have chili sauce.  Used cocktail sauce and was just as tasty.

I agree with other reviews that the dressing flavor dominated this dish-decreasing ground mustard should help. I followed the recipe except using 3- 6 oz. cans of crab meat (2 cups crab meat not enough).  WARNING: My green onions were very strong and gave the salad a spicy horseradish flavor. That worked for husband-not me!

This is really good but next time I will use only one teaspoon of ground mustard.  My family thought it was way too "hot" (or spicy).  Also, I chopped the egg and put it directly in the salad.

Good lunch salad.  My suggestion would be to add the dressing to the crab mixture a little at a time until you get the coating the way you like it.  Adding it all was just too much.  Sliced avacado on the side is also good.

This was not nearly as good as the other reviews had me expect.  It turned out too runny for my taste, and the chili sauce turned the dressing an unappetizing color.  If I were to make this again, I would leave the chili sauce out completely, reduce the celery seed at least by half, and it might be O.K.

Use 1 tsp dijon mustard and added it into the dressing. Mixed all the dressing separately and just drizzled over the crab mixture.
