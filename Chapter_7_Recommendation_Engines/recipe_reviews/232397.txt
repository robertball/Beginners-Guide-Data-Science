Wow! This recipe came out great. I have two little kids and wanted to make a ketchup without high fructose corn syrup, and to use in our homemade BBQ and sloppy joe sauces.  It tastes just like the bottled stuff. I skipped the white sugar & put in 1/3 c of honey instead, to make it even less processed. Canned crushed tomatoes made it easier to strain at the end, and the consistency is pretty good. I would skip the added water next time when using the honey.  This is a keeper! I'm so excited that I found this recipe & it was so easy using the slow cooker.

I do a couple things just a little differently.  I made a gallon, and froze the extra.  Let me say that my Favorite Ketchup by Far- is the recipe for fermeted ketchup in Nourishing Traditions.  It's EASY and tastes better than anything you can fathom when thinking Ketchup. But I hate to cook a fermented food and I needed a cookable Ketchup for BBQ Sauce. So- I made this, and it turned out great- but I carried over some ideas from my favorite Ketchup.  To the Gallon I used 1/2 cup Fish Sauce, skipped the clove, and used 1 cup honey in place of 2 cups sugar. I used some red wine and some white wine vinegar (just because it's what I had)- it turned out as good as Heinz, and Almost as good at the Fermented stuff I make from NT. Good stuff- no corn syrup, no junk. Also, if you used strained tomatoes you don't have to strain when you're done. Just put all the ingredients in the crock pot, leave the lid off and it's done in a few hours. Worth it- as long as you make a lot and freeze the extra.

This turned out great!  I used minced green onions, garlic, and celery instead of the garlic powder, onion powder, and celery salt.  I didn't puree it because I kind of like the chunky consistency.  I think next time I will try peeled pureed tomatoes and cut the sugar a bit.  All in all, easy and delicious!

I have a question ( I have not yet tried this recipe).  Could this be made in large amounts and then "canned" in a water bath like other veggies and fruits.  I would love to make a big batch of this to keep on my pantry shelves for future use.  Thanks for any suggestions.

This reminds me of really good BBQ sauce! It was very sweet. I would like to also try it with less sugar.

I used a saucepot instead which sped up the cooking process so I don't know what difference that made. 

You could get away without peeling the skin and straining the mixture. It would just be chunky if you like that texture.

I had a variety of different kinds and put them all together. Cut the stem ends off, cut them up and liquefy them, skins, seeds and all. Cooking it in a crockpot for 10 hours, and having to stir every hour pretty much defeats the reason for using a crockpot. I made a batch last night, but cooked it on the stove. You have to pay attention to it, and stir every few minutes, but from the time I started chopping to the time it reduced, it was just over an hour. I did use ground clove, and made a few adjustments, but I can say that it does have a great flavor.

First a quick note: if you are considering this for the first time and are looking at your standard-size cans of tomatoes: the recipe does call for 56 oz of canned tomatoes (so 4 regular size or 2 large size). Pretty spot on ketchup flavor, my kids were surprised when they tasted it. I did make some adjustments/changes 'though. I used brown sugar and used a little less, I used cider vinegar instead of white, used 1t of garlic powder instead of 1/2, cut back the salt to 1t and used maybe 1/16t (or just a dash) of ground cloves and added 1T of oyster sauce (fish sauce would also work). My wife despises seafood, but she has no idea there is oyster sauce in it. I don't often cook from recipes, preferring to learn the whys and hows, and I think this recipe gives you a great sense of the ratio of tomato:sugar:acid to start with. And cooking in the crock pot was slooooow, but allowed me to do other things on my day off. I agree with others and if I wanted it done faster I would do it on the gas an pay attention to it.

Chef John loved your video! I too am one more fool by making homemade ketchup, and I must say I'm sure glad I did it with your recipe.  I used my own homegrown tomatoes, mashed and strained them with my "Sauce Master" so I simply measured 28oz twice (8 cups) then doubled that as I had 30 cups of puree to use up.  Spices & seasonings are just right.
Thanks again Chef John!  Now at least I can say I've made h/m ketchup lol.

Thank you for this fantastic recipe! I've been looking to provide my family with heart healthy options in the way of ketchup (we love our ketchup)! Have tried many and have not been able to consume more than the first few bites of any of them! I made this less than a month ago and we are on our last few drops! I did make a few changes: swapped out the white sugar for 1/2 the amount in Truvia, crushed tomatoes instead of ground, Pink Sea Salt crystals for the table salt, and finally... left out the celery salt only because I didn't have it on hand nor find it anywhere to buy (didn't even know it existed). Got started late in the day; forgot about it cooking in the slow cooker (thankfully on low) and went to bed. Woke up Sunday morning to the most fantastic aroma wafting throughout my house! UNTIL I realized... OMG! MY KETCHUP! It turned out great though! Making second batch with the changes above and found the celery salt! Thank you so much for your hard work in putting this together for all of us to enjoy!

The *only* reason I rated it a 3 is because of the sugar. Rather than add sugar to cut the acidity I put a whole, huge, washed but not peeled carrot in (or a couple not so huge) and let it 'stew' with everything else. It massively reduces the acidity. I throw away the carrot before serving because the carrot has the acid in it if you will. This works with anything that has a tomato base and there's no added sugar. :o)

Have not tasted it post-cooking, but it smells and tastes like good ketchup as it is cooking!  Just wanted to note that the ingredient list does not include cayenne, yet the directions call for adding cayenne.  Perhaps other reviewers have already noted this.  I had to guess at the amount.

For all the inquiries about canning this recipe, I called my local cooperative extension agency who checked with the state food specialist to see if this recipe could safely be canned.  As written, this recipe is NOT acidic enough to can.  BUT if you add 1 1/2 teaspoon of bottled lemon juice per 1/2 pint (8 oz) jar, it can be safely canned in a boiling water bath for 15 minutes.  I opted to just freeze mine since I was concerned that the lemon juice would change the taste.  

I used fresh Roma tomatoes.  I blanched them, peeled them, removed some seeds and diced them.  This recipe takes 16 cups of fresh diced tomatoes.

Wonderful tomato-y ketchup. I make my own ketchup all the time, along with worcestershire sauce. I am a vegan and like natural foods rather than processed. (No anchovies in my worcestershire). This has replaced my original ketchup recipe, I only remove the salt. It is well worth the time if you want your family to taste great ketchup for the first time. Anything I can make myself always tastes better. Try this you will love it.

I have made this recipe twice and followed it to the tee...except, I have used my homemade canned tomato sauce that isn't much more than blended tomatoes and water. Made it in the crockpot. The ketchup is awesome. I did not like other ketchups made with tomato paste! This works out wonderfully! Keeps for several months.

So delicious....I just filled my crock-pot with home-grown tomatoes, crushed in my Vita-Mix. Used the same amount of ingredients but left out the water. M-m-m-m good.

Add me to the list of crazies. I have been making my own BBQ sauce lately so I've been going through quite a bit of catsup. Plus if I make my own catsup then my  BBQ sauce is even more mine.

My slow cooker was lost in a fire so this time I made it on the stove. I set my timer and stirred it about every 10 minutes. I don't have a garden or any crushed tomatoes. I did have some diced tomatoes but not enough for this recipe. I wanted to make at least this much so I used 2 14.5 oz cans of diced tomatoes ( which I put through my food processor) and 1 6 oz can of tomato paste. As mentioned by another reviewer there's no starting measurement for the cayenne so I started with 1/4 t. I didn't add any more it gives it a nice kick you won't get from Heinz but it may be a little spicy for kids (not burn their mouth spicy but possibly complaint spicy).

I found I did not need to strain it I just went through it with my immersion blender (which made a huge mess because I don't have a pot tall enough that isn't way too wide to get good depth for a recipe this size). I poured it into a sterilized squeeze bottle I had saved and it squeezes out just fine. Perfect consistency.

Next time I will use less sugar though or perhaps try honey it was a little sweeter than I would prefer definitely edible though. I will be making this again. Lastly I don't know if it was due to doing it on the stove or because I started with different tomato styles but i

I tried this because I ran out of ketchup and was not going back to the store. I used Contadina style crushed tomatoes and followed the recipe, except, I didn't add any water, and I used 2 Tbsp more vinegar and 1/8 tsp ground cloves. I didn't have time for the crock pot version so I brought it to a slow bubble over low heat and shut it off to cool. It was really good. The consistency was a little runny, but I think it would be even better cooked long and slow in the crockpot. I am thinking of trying applesauce in place of the sugar.  I can't wait to try using different spices and maybe even 1/2 wine, 1/2 vinegar too. The directions mention cayenne pepper, but the ingredients didn't list, so I added 1/4 tsp. I didn't even need to blend this. I might try making a hotter version to go on baked beans or burgers. It makes 2 quarts .

Excellent recipe!  The only change I made was the sugar amount which I lowered to just under a half a cup.  You can always add.  About 8 hours in I tasted and added another Tablespoon and if was perfect.  Different tomatoes have different tartness.  My son did not know it was homemade and pulled the bottle for fries, hd asked if the name brand changed and was glad they did.  I may now have to make this recipe for the remainder of my days, lol.  Enjoy it because as my son said "it is the BOMB!"

So much better for you than store bought and so simple.  I used tomato sauce, and we don't like celery salt, so I threw some celery in and let it cook down, also used stevia and about 1/2 the amount of sugar.  Cooked down in about 2 hours on the stove top and came out perfect.  I double the recipe and got about cups and it is in the hot water bath now canning!  Husband said best he ever tasted!

The flavor is perfect! The taste of vinegar is slightly less than store bought and this is a little more sweet. I think this is way better than  store bought and very easy.

The only alteration I made was starting with tomato sauce instead of peeled ground tomatoes and cooked it on the stove. I was able to reduce the cooking time to 2-3 hours this way and I didn't have to strain anything because it was already smooth.

This will definitely be a staple in my home. I used it with cheeseburgers and fries tonight and later this week I will be making Honey BBQ with it!

This was great.  I didn't know making ketchup could be so easy.  I substituted the 2/3 cup sugar with 1/2 cup agave.  I decided I to make my own ketchup because the store bought ones all contain High Fructose Corn Syrup and I don't want that.  Thank you Chef John.

This is tasty! The only things I did differently were a little less sugar, a lot more cloves and substituted some roasted garlic for the powder. YUM!

I am super picky about ketchup and this is PERFECT!  I made it with a 29 oz. can of tomato sauce so I didn't have to strain anything, and I needed to have it sugar-free, so I used Splenda, and it is absolutely spot on for that top-brand flavor!  I hated the idea of high fructose corn syrup, and Hubs cannot have sugar, so I've been looking for a good recipe, and this is a GREAT one!  It cooked overnight in my slow cooker.  I just have one question:  can I can this in larger quantities?

This is definitely ketchup. How did I do that? Wow!
So I couldn't figure outwhat ground tomatoes are and took the advice of another reviewer and used crushed tomatoes. Then I actually watched the video(I don't usually) and he used crushed tomatoes I believe. Anyways, it was super easy, but after 10 hours I tried to strain it and it was watery.  I put it back in the crockpot and am going to cook it down some more but the taste is perfect. Tried it with some eggs and other than being watery still, it was exactly ketchup. No more no less.
My child puts this ish on everything so I wanted to make a less sugary version for him and this was awesome.  Thanks Chef John!

Update: yeah you're right, making ketchup IS crazy.  It was still watery but no doubt ketchup tasting. My child wasn't too impressed. Instead I mixed it in a lentil soup and it improved it times 10.  I still appreciate you Chef John. 
Sincerely, Crazy ketchup maker

The flavor was good, but it was so labor intensive! I just can't justify the amount of time and effort involved compared with the store bought variety.

This ketchup recipe so simple to make and tastes so close to regular store bought ketchup.  Without the fructose that is so bad for you.  The store bought ketchup, they changed the ingredient list to show liquid sugar which is actually fructose.  I used crushed tomatoes.

I'm currently working on making this recipe a second time in a week. Not because I went through so much, it fills a 16oz bottle of ketchup. No, I'm remaking it because it was too soupy and by that I mean it saturated the buns of both hamburger and hotdog. Not exactly conducive to making a good ketchup. I also wanted a recipe minus tomato paste. Came to the conclusion, you need to omit the 1/2 cup of water entirely! It makes it too runny, also change the distilled vinegar from 3/4 cup to 1/2 cup. This keeps the ketchup tasting like ketchup without being too bitter and also helps keep it from being runny. I used diced tomatoes and then finished pulverizing the tomatoes using my immersion blender, a bit messy, but worked in a pinch because my blender is in need of a gasket. I'll update it once this new batch is done.

I had about 10-15 lbs of frozen tomatoes (unblanched just vac packed) from 2015.  I cut stems off and put the whole tomatoes in my vitamix and pureed, then added sugar, garlic, pepper, salt, cloves, cider vinegar, onions and simmered for about three hours until the consistency of purchased ketchup.  I got a quart and a pint of ketchup.  The cloves made me hesitate but did not interfere with the wonderful taste.  
When my tomatoes ripen I will make more and use a water bath to can them.  Also think this will make good holiday gifts.  I made fried green tomatoes but they were gone before I thought to use my ketchup as a dip but next time I won't forget.

I wanted to make my own ketchup after I saw on facebook  the reality of what store bought ketchup really is.This recipe is excellent for me with a few changes due to personal preference and what I had on hand.  First  I did not add the water.  After cooking for a while tasted it.  .  Way too sweet.  Did not have celery salt used Beaumont Seasoning which has celery seed in it.  Used Chipotle  powder cause I like it.  Also used a variety of vinegars to make up the total amount.  I definitely will make this again.  Also at the end it was not thick enough so I added 1 small can of tomato past last couple of hours.

This is very comparable to name brand ketchup, but of course it's better because it's from scratch. :) I've made this twice now, and it's WAY too sweet. Both times, I added more tomatoes because I was going to freeze it and wanted a large quantity; however, it's so sweet that I had to add a lot more tomatoes. If you're cooking this in the slow cooker, it also takes a lot longer to cook down this way.

The first time I made it, I got tired of waiting for it and put it on the stove in a soup pot instead. It ended up caramelizing the tomatoes, and it was delicious! I used it with a chicken finger recipe that called for spicy ketchup. Even my picky son loved it!

no mustard powder, I do not like mustard, I used red wine vinegar. I also chopped (very fine) and cooked my onions and garlic (onions first then garlic and red wine vinegar to both cool and stop the cooking when they were ready to add). Let that mixture cool a bit before the crushed tomatoe mix, I also added one small can of condensed tomatoes. Also lots of chili flakes because I like it hot. I did tri-colored peppercorns ground fresh as well. This recipe was a good guideline for me to make my own stuff, thank you.

I have made this a number of times. Thanks Chef John. All my changes was to use fresh ingredients in place of the dry powdered. I also used Balsamic vinegar once and red wine vinegar once. Both with amazing results. I also use honey in place of the sugar.
I made this at work yesterday and had to bake it in the oven instead of a slow cooker. It worked out great also. 6 hours @ 325 degrees checking on it every now and then.
My neice asks for this exclusively now. Lol. 
Thanks again.

I've tried three recipes for homemade ketchup, this i s the family favorite. I use fresh "squeezed" tomato sauce, and omit the water.  I follow the spice quantities as listed per 4C of fresh sauce, then leave overnight in the crock pot (uncovered). It's nearly ready by morning, as it takes longer to thicken with fresh sauce  but we'll worth the time!

Really good! I didn't heed the instructions to adjust flavorings when cooked and cold, so I was playing with more vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, a touch of sriracha, as it was simmering, doubting just how good this was going to turn out. At the end of the cooking time, all the flavors had blended beautifully! It does taste a bit like Heinz! I did not use my crock pot, since, if I was to stir it every hour or so, it was just as easy to simmer on the stove. I showed my husband the starting level of the sauce in relation to the handle rivets & told him to watch out for when it had reduced by about half. We both gave it a little stir whenever we went through the kitchen. It also did not take 12 hours on the stove - only about 6 or 7. It even thickens up a bit more after it's been refrigerated. We like it!

Personally, I didn't mind the time it took to make this deliciouis tasting ketchup.  I will do it again.  If you have a large garden and an over-supply of tomatoes, this is a great use for them.  

It tastes as good or better than Heinz ketchup.  My garden is fully organic.  I used only organic ingredients.

I reduced the crushed tomato ketchup to about half the original volume, and then strained the ketchup as directed.  After straining, I found the ketchup not quite as thick as I like, so I strained the ketchup again using cheese cloth to reduce the moisture content.  

The ketchup was sent out as Christmas gifts together with Bread and Butter pickles (FoodWishes.Com recipe) and sweet pickle relish (The Big Easy Chef recipe).  All were delicious.  I am confident the recipients will love them.

First time making ketchup. I used this one as a base and doubled it. I did add a few seasonings and used sugar, honey and molasses along with apple cider vinegar. it took forever but turned out amazing. The only thing I would do differently next time is reduce the sugar a bit. by the time it cooked down and thickened it was a bit too sweet and we like it a little tangier

I made the original recipe without any modifications. Turned out very good and much healthier than the store brands. Just a bit sweeter than the store brands, but I was looking for something different. It fit's the bill. Great on french fries, burgers and yes, even on hot dogs.

I love this recipe. I omitted the salt entirely and it tastes really great. It's fun to do as well. The taste, consistency and color are all perfect! I believe homemade mustard and mayo is next. Thanks a million Chef John!

Fantastic! Making this one step healthier and one step easier. I don't eat sugar or processed foods from the store. Switched out sugar for Agave, put all except tomatoes in cheese cloth, then took out after cooking, squeezing yum back in! Thanks for the recipe! One step Healthier and loving it!!

LOVED this recipe!  Easy, works well with adaptations (ie. apple cider vinegar ilo white, sucanat ilo regular sugar).  We don't mind thick ketchup with some fiber in it so we don't strain ours =)

Great tasting ketchup! Didn't turn out as thick as I liked so I put some of the ketchup in a sauce pot and thickened it with cornstarch. Stirred it into the rest of the ketchup and it was perfect!

Can't say I ever wanted to make ketchup, until I was looking for added ways to cut sugar out of my diet. I swapped out the granulated sugar for equal parts of "swerve" sugar, and "Monk" sugar. Also great if you are on a low-carb or keto diet. There is no possible way, anyone would be able to tell, if I put this ketchup on your cheeseburger. The flavor is amazing! The richness and color....beautiful! My favorite brand of ketchup is "Heinz"...and this was every bit as delicious, if not better.

I made this as I was making homemade tater tots and didn’t want use a commercial ketchup.  The spices were good in this, but it was way too sweet and way too vinegary for me.  I used whole peeled tomatoes and put them in my food processor before putting them in a crockpot.  I seldom use white vinegar as I personally believe it’s better for cleaning than cooking.  I’ll swap out the white vinegar for apple cider vinegar, and lessen the amount.  Also, reduce the sugar.  Remember, these can be adjusted to taste after it cooks for a while.  Other measurements seemed to make a nice tasting ketchup.

Love the recipe  I agree with others that  10-12 hours of monitored slow cooking is a bit excessive, so I made it on the stovetop with stirring every few minutes instead. Excellent result!

This is a great recipe!  I doubled it. Ran it through a water bath and have ketchup to last me at least six months.

Changes I made are as follows:
I used fresh tomatoes from my garden, cooking them down, skins and all, until soft.  Then ran them through a blender. Then continued with the recipe.

I used organic raw sugar instead of regular white sugar.

I didn't use onions because my son doesn't like them. But next time I'll chop them finely in the food processor and saute them before adding to recipe while he is not looking!

I didn't have whole cloves, so I used ground cloves instead.

I didn't strain anything out because after blending and cooking down everything was very smooth.

I will make it again. My point was to cut down on the added sugar. Store Ketchup seems too sweet to me. In this recipe I halved the sugar . It still seems sweet but the next time I will make sure my canned tomatoes have not extra sugar before I reduce the added sugar any more. I have used this as a base for spaghetti sauce. I also have made tomato soup with this ketchup . Wonderful!

I'm not a big ketchup user but my family is and they liked this recipe.  I used honey instead of sugar and it was still a bit too sweet so I'd reduce the amount a bit (I used 1 cup).  Other than that, great taste, very similar to store bought - but better of course,

Absolutely delicious. Two things- Like some other reviewers I made it on the stovetop in the interest of time. It takes about an hour to reduce it. Second, Chef John is right. You’re crazy to make it based on work vs. yield.

To be honest, I am allergic to fructose and my wife is trying a new diet that does not allow any white sugar.  So I used "Splenda" instead of the white sugar.  I would recommend only using 1/3 Splenda instead of 2/3 white sugar...
Honestly I would double this....  Other than the Spenda, I followed the recipe exactly.  After 1 hour of simmer, I tasted great an my wife used half of it to make Sloppy Joes - they were assume; but don't ask, I don't know what recipe she used.  Even though my old crockpot has a "High", "Medium" and "Low", it appears that all of those are "Burn Everything this Person Puts in Me."  So obviously, I did not watch this every minute and my first batched burned after 3 hours on low...  So to make an even longer story short, I have a new crockpot, and my wife found a great price on fresh tomatoes, I spent my day canning tomatoes.  So now I'm making this again with fresh tomatoes.  And after 2 hours of simmering it is unbelievable.  (So, to make a long story short, make it, double it...)

Fabulous flavor in this recipe.  I used fresh Roma tomatoes,  peeled and seeded to avoid any bitterness, about 3-3 1/2 lbs.  It was alot of work to do the seeding and peeling, but well worth it for how wonderful the taste turned out.  Added 3/4 cup of water (instead of the specified 1/2 c), used apple cider vinegar since I didn't have the distilled white vinegar, and added a little lemon juice.  Used Xylitol in place of the sugar (adding maybe a couple of tbsp extra since the Xylitol is not quite as sweet as sugar).  While cayenne was not listed as an ingredient, it was mentioned in the directions, so I added 1/4 tsp. Placed all in my new Instant Pot, on the slow cooker setting, but after 9 hrs it still hadn't thickened much, so put it in a pot on the stove on low, and cooked it for another 1-1 1/2 hrs til It was reduced and got very thick.  Fantastic taste!

I tried this recipe but I had difficulty straining at the end... Is there a feasible way to skip the straining part? 

Has anyone done it successfully?

 Use tomato purée instead of whole peeled? 

Blend the tomatoes enough to make seeds and skins unnoticeable?

I love this !!!  I did make 1 small change.... I am trying to get sugar out of my life, so instead of sugar I used some cooked date puree as a natural sweetener.  This ketchup tastes just like the processed stuff, and it freezes well.  Thank you Chef John!  This was just exactly what I was looking for!

The recipe didn’t have any measurement for cayenne pepper??? So I skipped that. Otherwise I followed the recipe exact. I don’t have a strainer but I found it wasn’t needed after the immersion blender. This is delicious!!!!! First recipe I’ve ever tried that actually ended up tasting right! Thank you!!!

Fantastic.  I won't say it's close to store bought, because that would be an insult.  I used garden tomatoes and some yellow salad tomatoes from the CSA.  The color was a little light because of that so I put a couple drops of red gel coloring & it looked as good as it tasted.

Yum!  I found I like it better if cooked a little less than the recommended 10-12 hrs - has a little more "fresh" taste to it.  I also add maybe double the onion powder and reduced the sugar.  But it's all good.  Fabulous recipe!

Easy and tastes just like ketchup. I made it slightly easier by using my blender instead of using an immersion blender and then pushing it through a sieve.

I haven't made it yet.  But I am planning to make it. I have printed out the recipe and am ready to makeketchup.  I grow my own tomatoes.  To freeze my tomatoes for making sauces, I rinse the tomatoes, then cut them in chunks LEAMING the skins on and put the chunks in the blender.  I pusle the blender till the tomatoes are all chopped up not quite pureed.   I pour each batch of tomatoes into a large soup pan and cook till the tomatoes are done and have reduced a little.  When cooled I put the tomatoes in 1 pint containers and put a lid on and  write what is in the containers on the lids.  Then I put the containers in the freezer in a single layer till they are frozen.  When frozen I stack the containers .  I think I will freeze my ketchup in 1/2 pint containers since we don't use a lot of ketchup.  Thank you for the recipe.

I suppose I shouldn't rate this because I change some of the ingredients.  I use real garlic, onions and celery.  I also have to replace the pepper with basil.  But, it turns out great.  I also use fresh tomatoes from my garden.  Just take some of the tomatoes, push them thru the strainer to get the seeds and put this  in a blender with the cooked garlic, onions and celery.  Blend until smooth, and add to the rest of the crock pot.  I've made catsup this way for years and we all love it. Like John said, it usually takes the second day in the crock pot to get it cooked down to the consistency we like, but really, it's worth the work.

This is a perfect recipe for a ketchup connoisseur like myself. I made it with crushed canned tomatoes in a slow cooker on high for 12 hours, 10hrs probably would've been fine. As many people said you could probably get away with using less sugar-but it's ketchup, and you only live once so I rounded up. I noticed the Cayanne pepper to taste suggestion, although not in the ingredients list, so I went for it. This gives it a perfect spice! I bottled and properly labeled it!

Loved the flavor & soo easy.  Will make again. But I will make it a little thinner as mine turned out very thick & I like mine thin.  I also added a bit more cloves {as I like that flavor} And added 1 or 2 T. oyster sauce.  Thank you Chef  John

I've made this twice now with canned tomatoes and twice with home grown garden tomatoes. We have stopped buying name brand ketchups and only use this.

This turned out great! My kids LOVED it and it tastes so much more fresh compared to store-bought!

I had to tweak it based on what I had/didn't have in my cupboards, though. I didn't have 2 cans of crushed tomatoes, so I used (1) 28oz can of crushed tomatoes and then (2) 14oz cans of diced tomatoes. I was also out of onion powder, so I used about 1/4 cup diced yellow onions. I did not put a clove in it, nor did I put any cayenne pepper in it. I used celery seed instead of celery salt.

After pressing it through a strainer, I ended up with about 4 1/2 cups of ketchup.

Unbelievably good! I used about 4 pounds of garden fresh tomatoes, different varieties, blanched and peeled, instead of the canned stuff, and omitted the water. I got impatient with the slow cooker, so I finished it off on the stove. The taste develops best after it has been in the refrigerator for a couple of days.  Nobody wants to eat the store-bought stuff anymore.

I made it as is. I don't even like ketchup, but I've only had store bought before. This I liked. I'll have to try some other homemade ketchup. My 11 year old eats it but he likes the store bought better. Typical.

The only change I made was in cooking it on the stove top.  I have made it this way three times and it is always delicious!  Thank you for sharing!

This was very easy and tasted fresh, not sugary. Great use of the slow cooker. Made a really good seafood sauce using this as a base. I haven't tried freezing it yet but will repost if it is successful

This is awesome and super easy to make. It tastes better than any other store bought brand. I don't think I'll ever buy another bottled ketchup again. Both my kids and husband love it! We nearly went thru a 36oz bottle of this in a week! So...I'm happy to report that this is definitely a hit.

Made this yesterday, everyone raves about it.  Only thing I did "wrong" was use white wine vinegar instead of distilled, because that's what I had on hand.  I forgot - used 56 oz of fresh tomatoes from the garden and cut the water to a splash.  Also used 1/2 cup instead of 2/3 cup of sugar.  I would like to try this again using fresh onion and garlic - just because if it comes from my garden I feel happier about it :)
