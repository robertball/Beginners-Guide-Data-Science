So, I mixed up the directions, even after reading it through twice: I misread the egg/water being ADDED to the fruit mixture... So my filling was WAY too drippy. That was entirely my fault, but if you are like me, and read it like that, here's your warning! Keep the egg and water apart from the filling. 
I also added about 1/4 tsp. of cinnamon to my fruit, for a bit more spice. 
The whole thing is NOT kind to your baking sheet, so I recommend a layer of foil on your baking sheet first. It'll save you some pain when you wash dishes. Otherwise, this was simple and pretty and tasty.

Tastes good but... Although I used mixed berries instead of peaches, I used the same amount the recipe suggested and it's way too high of a fruit to pastry ratio.  I'll be cooking the other half of the box to go with what's left.  To anyone else who tries this recipe, I'd say 12 oz is more than enough.   The pastry was rather soggy on the bottom, but that's probably my fault for using fruit that's too juicy.

Made as directed except I used fresh peaches.  This is really good.  I like that it is just slightly sweet, most of the sweetness coming from the peaches.

Not bad and very easy. The next time after I have rolled out the dough, I will place it on parchment paper and put it on the cookie sheet then fill it. It was stupid of me to fill it on the bread board and then try to transfer it to a cookie sheet. In fact, I should have rolled it out on parchment paper too. I had enough filling which thickened nicely with 2+ T flour. I think I would leave the nuts out the next time or maybe sprinkle them on top. It could even use a little powder sugar glaze on the top if the fruit isn't too sweet. Bottom crust came out nice and crispy and brown. I would try it again.

I loved this!!   I made as directed but used only 1/4 cup sugar and no pecans because I didn't have any.  If I were to add I would toast them first.   I also used 1 1/2TBSP minit tapioca instead of the flour.    Turned out great.

i made the recipe to the directions, except I left out the pecans and used very ripe fresh peaches.  Overall the strudel was very good, but a little on the sweet side, but that could have been because the peaches I used were very ripe and sweet.  This made a quick weekend breakfast and I'll make it again.
