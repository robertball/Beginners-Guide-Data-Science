I made this recipe but used 50% brown sugar and 50% cane sugar. Once the nuts came out of the skillet, I spread them across some wax paper, sprinkled with cinnamon and the baked the nuts for about 10 mins at 170degC. The result was unbelievable - I can't stop eating them

When you make these, be sure to get the exhaust fan  going over your stove, and once the sugar and water mix starts to crystalize on the nuts, keep on stirring and heating so the sugar stars to melt and the nuts start to brown... it does smoke a little as they brown and you will see the white sugar melting and becoming a clear brown coating on the darkening nuts.  Just when the white sugar is almost all melted, quickly dump onto parchment or a silpat and separate as much as you can with a couple of forks...

These are pretty good. I however have to agree with others that maybe the procedure didn't work for me. They looked pretty raw and had the white powder look. I put them in the oven to see if I could get them extra roasted but nothing really happened. I left them alone and the next day, I proceeded to roast them at 350 for about 10 to 15 minutes. Honestly, with tons of watch I finally got them as golden as I could to my taste. Still, despite the procedure issue the flavor was excellent. I could not stop eating them so I am glad I was making them for someone else. I also, out of curiosity, used half white sugar and half brown organic sugar. Will make it again and report on what I did to make the procedure work for me!

I used this recipe with Pecans and Almonds, (separately) instead of peanuts. It was FANTASTIC! I've had a lot of professionally made candied nuts and have a pretty high standard for them. This recipe was so quick and much easier than a lot of the other recipes and it was awesome! I made 8 batches of this within 2 hours and the only thing I'll say is to make sure to stir it regularly, particularly in the last 5 minutes of cooking. Fantastic!

Next time I make these I would toast the nuts in a non stick skillet for a bit before adding the sugar and water.  The nuts had a bit of a raw taste to them.  I couldn't get them as dark as I would have liked to but that was probably my error, not the fault of the recipe.   The pinch of chili pepper was a nice touch.

Don't be afraid of the heat. You have to melt the sugar.

These were pretty tasty, but the method didn’t take me to a candied nut. It led to raw peanuts on top a fine powder building up on the bottom of the pan. I added a bit more water and got nothing. I ended up adding some honey and that helped a bit, but the peanuts were still raw. I finished it off in the oven at 190° C until the peanuts browned and the sugar finally crystallized. Once cooled, I broke them apart and they were candied...and quite tasty. Thank you for the recipe.

I used the recipe as a ratio template.  I wanted to see if I could use the dry sugaryham glaze packet that comes with a ham instead of the sugar.  My ham packets is made with sugar and honey, so I gave it a whirl.  It turned out great.  I only cooked the nuts in the skillet a total of about 5-7 minutes.  For me, there was a point where the syrup lost all its moisture and became crumbly.  I just added a few teaspoons of water and cooked a few extra minutes.  Also, I cut my almonds into thirds so there was more surface to be coated.
