I made as written except used a pound of can crab due to availability and these turned out EXCELLENT! The mixture seemed a little dry at first but moistened up  perfectly after an hour in the fridge. I loved the Asian flavor in this and everything about these actually.

Land locked and can't find "fresh crab" so I tried with imitation. The patties didn't hold together.  I even tried adding an extra egg and mayo.
