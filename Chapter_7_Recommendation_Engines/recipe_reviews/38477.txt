This dressing is soooo good!  My instinct told me to add cilantro & I'm not at all sorry that I did!  Simple, but tasty.  We used black olives because my little olive queen ate all of the green ;)  We also used croutons instead of the corn chips.  Thanks Lori!

Size does matter!

We had this for New Year's Eve (with Baja Baked Potatoes and Ribeye Steaks with Soy and Ginger Marinade, by the way - both from Allrecipes.com). The dressing was a bit out of proportion to the salad (not enoughlettuce to dressing). And the dressing was too mayonaisey for my taste (I think because the recipe called for "1 avocado" and mine was a small avocado). My recommendation would be to make sure to have extra lettuce for backup- and to use 2 small or one large avocado---or half the mayonaise and add more to taste.

Another trick for working with the avocado is to use a rotation-type cheese grater (like a "Salad Shooter") to "grate" it into the blender, expecially if it is not soft. It is much easier to get the dressing smoothe, since it is particularly thick dressing, and the chunks of avocado tend to stick to the sides. (If you have a food processor, this is probably not a problem.)I have used this method for guacamole with great satisfaction.

GREAT SALAD!  EASY TO MAKE, THE DRESSING IS QUITE DIFFERENT, BUT AWESOME!!! I ADDED CHICK PEAS AND CUCUMBERS TO GIVE IT SOME EXTRAS.  BUT IN MY OPINION THE CORN CHIPS CAN BE LEFT OUT, AND STILL THE SALAD IS PERFECT.

Love this salad! I thinned the dressing a bit with whole milk to get it to the right consistency for me. Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing.

I made this with lime tostitos. It was fantastic! Great flavor and even my 1yo son ate it. Next time I think I would add the mayo & oil by hand because it all separated in the processor when it was pureed. Still tasted fine though. Definately a keeper, thanks!

Yum!  I substituted black olives and fresh parmesean over red and green leaf lettuce and it was great!  My family agrees Chili-Lime Fritos are the best corn chip to use.

Yum! We had a dinner party yesterday and this was a nice light, yet very flavorful salad that complimented my chicken franchaise and fetticini alfredo beautifully. The avacado dressing is a little different and absolutely delish! I'm happy to say that all the kids went nuts over this. Thanks so much Lori!

As much as I wanted to Love this salad. I didn't. Taste like a taco salad with your meat & the dressing was very slimy- Oily. I think I'll stick to a 7 layer salad or something else. Thanks for the post though. I like trying new things.

I really wanted to love this recipe, but we didn't.  I saw others say that it was bland but it tasted like guacamole on lettuce.  The dressing was so thick also...and tasted alot like olive oil.  I ended up throwing the dressing away, but keeping the salad part (thank goodness I didn't put the dressing on the lettuce before tasting it.)  Sorry this wasn't for us..

This recipe wasn't bad, but it wasn't as good as I'd have expected.  I made it for a "ladies' lunch," and fortunately had the ladies taste the avocado mixture before I tossed it with the greens, etc.  They ended up eating bottled salad dressing on their greens, and I ate some of the salad with the avocado mixture later.  I think that if I were to try it again, I would definitely omit the olive oil -- and I might consider throwing in some sour cream.  I did use a previous reviewer's idea of using tortilla chips in place of corn chips, which was very good.

Absolutely delicious!  I served it to a group of middle and high school students at a Bible Study and they ate it up!  One girl came back 4 times for refills!  The only changes I made was to use black instead of green olives, fresh lime juice instead of the lemon juice and to add about 2 Tbs. chopped fresh cilantro.  I will try it with less olive oil and 2 avacodos next time.  Thanks for this very fresh and refreshing recipe.

This salad was very good and different.  My boyfriend loved the lime-flavored chips, and the guacamole-like dressing.  I thought it was good, but I could taste more mayo in the dressing than I'd like.  I'll make this again, probably with less mayo and more avocado.

Loved it!!  If you like avacado you will love this.  It was a mild dressing and salad ingredients are easy to work with; add more or less to your taste. I used black olive instead of green.  Will definitely make again.  Great for company, too.

Brought this to a party and all loved it. Made a few changes - added one extra avocado, used fat free sr cream instead of mayo, and lime juice instead of lemon. The dressing was a little bland, so I added 1 Tbsp ea. of chili powder & cumin, 1 tsp onion powder, and 3 cloves chopped garlic. I thinned the dressing with milk (adjust to your desired consistency) Used about 1/2 c sliced green olives w/pimiento, 1/4c pickled jalapeno slices and added 1/2c cilantro leaves to the greens. Everyone loved it.

This salad is addicting!  I actually messed up the first time I made it and omitted the mayo in the dressing (how do you DO that?!!).  It came out thin and oily, but tasted great!  The second time, I used the mayo the the dressing was a little too thick but tasted awesome.  I think next time I'll use 1/4 to 1/3 cup mayo and maybe add an olive or 2 to the blender to add salt and zest.  Be sure to use Fritos in this salad, they're the BEST!  Little chunks of avocado would be great too, but adds to the fat.

This salad is great... but very rich! I almost cut up an extra avacado to put in the salad, but as I discovered, that would have been overkill. This salad would make a wonderful lunch with some chicken cut up in it... its filling, and tastes awesome. I used black olives instead of green.

This is the best salad I've ever had. You can add whatever vegetables you like.  I added snow peas and black olives and omitted the onions and green olives.  The dressing is what makes this an awesome recipe.  I take this salad to family functions and I always get asked for the recipe!  Thanks for sharing with us!

Really yummy.  Will do this again.  I used  light mayo and light sour cream to equal the amount of mayo called for in the recipe.  I added a cup or so of fresh cilantro and used lime juice.  It needed thining so I use some milk.  Everyone loved it, I even forgot the chips which would definately make it tastier. Thanks:}

This was a nice twist from your typical taco salad...nice taste! The dressing was unique and we all liked it alot.  I also added some fresh, sliced mushrooms.  Hardly any left!! Thanks Lori!

Because I made a lot of this, it didn't go so fast, but everyone really loved the salad.  Tastes good with or without the green olives, so if you don't like them make sure to leave them out.  I mixed in a little of the dressing with th salad and place a bowl of more on the side and it worked well.

I made this for a baby shower I gave with college students in attendance.  They loved it!  There was none left.  Some of them asked me for the recipe.  I can't wait to make it again.

I served this salad at a family get together over the weekend - what a big hit!  Just remember not to put the dressing on too long before you eat.  You don't want soggy leaves!  Thanks for a new favorite!!!

This was SO GOOD my husband wolfed all his down and ate half of mine (wasn't hungry enough to eat the whole thing, it was so huge)!  Just a couple changes:  a plain ol' whisk was fine to combine ingredients, 1/4 c only mayo, only a few drops tabasco, no oil, no garlic clove (just some garlic powder), no olives (altho I would have liked some black ones), no chips (I couldn't have eaten them if I wanted to!)...  I carefully spooned on dressing over top of the assembled salad -- the dressing could very easily have been a very scumptious dip.  I could see me making this again even as a dip with some salsa on the side.  mmmm!!

This recipe sounded so good, but I was disappointed.  The dressing just wasn't right and the combination of all the ingredients didn't suit our tastes.

From reading the recipe, it sounds like it would be good. But honestly, it was very bland - and I am not one to usually call anything bland. I added some cilantro to the dressing to help liven it up, but it was still just ok.

The dressing had an excellent taste, but It was a little too oily for me.  It wasn't very smooth either, it kept seperating... but that could have been something I did wrong.  Overall a very tasty salad.  My husband loved it.

I thought this salad was great! All the friends I shared it with loved it and asked for the recipe. I can't believe some people were so rude in their reviews. If you think the dressing was too rich and gooey, you should use less. If your chips got soggy, you should throw them in at the very end. Use a little common sense. If you change the ingredients, the flavor will be different and you cannot compare. Overall, excellent salad. Thank you Lori!

This was a pretty good salad. However, the chips got really soggy. For next time, I will probably add the chips after the rest of the ingredients have been mixed together.I will try adding salsa to the salad next time too. Also, I added black olives instead of green. The dressing makes the salad! It has a wonderful taste. Overall, this salad was pretty good.

I made the dressing for another type salad and it was fabulous. It could be used for so many other things since it's thick. burgers, sandwiches, chip dip, tacos. We loved it! Maybe I'll make the salad part some day too.

Here is another excellent recipe thanks to Allrecipes. Threw everything in the blender. Used a mixed green salad mix instead of romaine but next time I will use the romaine as I think it would work best. Husband loved the flavor and has requested that I take this to a friend's house for dinner this evening.

This was a very tasty dish, but I felt the dressing still needed something. I ended up adding salsa which seemed to spice it up a bit. Overall the dish was pretty good though.

I tried this salad a second time substituting sour cream for the mayo, adding another avocado, and using rosted red pepper flavored olives in place of the green olives, and it still is not quite right.

This was a very good summer salad.  Next time I may add a few tablespoons of milk to the dressing, it seemed a little thick although it coated the salad pieces pretty well. It had a very good and different flavor, not the "same old green salad" recipe.

I made this for the first time last night and we all LOVED it.  I omitted the olives and added another avocado and a little water (to get a thinner consistency).  Wow, it was so good I had seconds and ate out of the leftovers bowl.  This one is a keeper!

This salad is delicious!  I made it exactly as the recipe states, no changes, and it turned out perfect.  I made this salad to go along with tacos and loved it so much I skipped the taco's and kept refilling my plate with the salad :)  I'm so glad I found this recipe-- I will make it over and over.

This is a great tasting salad.  The dressing makes the salad.  Add the corn chips just before serving or place in separate bowl and let your guest add as much as they like.

Totally awesomely delicious.  Loved the mix of veggies that went in here. I don't know that the cheese was necessary but loved the olives/tomatoes with the sauce.  Not sure why the prep time is 25 minutes, it took about 5 minutes to make the dressing and 5 minutes to throw the other stuff together!

Fabulous!  Like others, I used black olives instead of green.  I use 1 package of "Wholly Guacamole" rather than fresh avacados, and it makes a delicious dressing.  First time I made this I thought the dressing could use a bit more "zip", so second time I added a bit more garlic, a bit of prepared horseradish and a few extra dashes of tobassco.  I usually serve the crushed chips "on the side" so they don't get mushy.  Perfect!

This was very good. It actually tasted a lot like a taco. I left out the cheese, and instead of mayo, I blended half an avocado with 2 tsp of balsamic vinegar and a sundried tomato (I discovered on accident that this odd combo actually tastes a lot like mayo). I also used blue-corn tortilla chips, which are less greasy and not as salty. I think this would be good with black olives in addition to the green. Definitely a keeper. UPDATE: I made this again and subbed homemade salsa for the mayo, and it was just delicious! I'll make it this way from now on.

I absolutely loved this. I was feeling too lazy to dirty up the food processor, so I mashed the avocado by hand, and added the ingredients one by one. I used half lite mayo, half light Ranch dressing, regular onions, and I omitted the olives as I wasn't in the mood for them. What an awesome lunch. Thanks so much, Lori!

People go crazy for this salad!  I love it!  I've made it for parties and baby showers, etc.  It's been a huge hit every single time!  I'm not the biggest fan of green olives, so I sometimes add sliced black olives instead....but that's the only thing I would change. It's perfect in every other way!

I made this salad for my family and everyone loved it.  My grandmother ( a notoriously picky eater) asked for seconds, unfortunately there were none, because the salad was gone in about two seconds.  The only change I made was to add a LOT more hot sauce.

I loved this salad!  If you like olives you'll love the subtle flavor that it adds.  This one's a keeper!

Pretty good recipe.  I followed the advice of a previous poster and added some cumin and chili powder to the dressing - I think without it, the dressing would've been pretty bland.  But with the spices, delicious!  I added some already cooked southwestern flavored chicken and we had it for dinner - good recipe - thanks!!

We enjoyed this salad but I feel like the dressing was a little too creamy.  I may add more olive oil and use juice of one lime instead of lemon.

Good salad Lori.  I made this for my mom and I over the Christmas holidays and we both enjoyed this...though it was very filling.  We left out the green olives.

My entire family thought this tasted awful. Thank goodness we had leftovers in the fridge for something else to eat. Way too much mayonnaise and very little taste to this dressing. Thought the corn chips added a strange taste to this.

This was excellent.  I didn't use the corn chips, and I only used about 2/3rds of the dressing.  It was so tasty.  You could really taste the avacado.  I took this to a friends house and it got raves.

The whole family liked this one.  I cut back on the mayo, as suggested by others, but then added some back to get the dressing to the right consistency.  Add the chips right before serving.  We had leftovers & they got soggy.

We think this salad is very, very good. My picky 12 year old loves it and normally wouldn't touch an avocado. I did change the green olives to black and doubled the dressing recipe to use as a dip for taquitos the next day. YUM!!!

This salad was absolutely delicious!  We reduced the oil to 2 tablespoons - you really don't miss it, used less cheese and chips (although they are delicious in the salad if you want the full fatty thing!) and no olives and added a cucumber.  We will definitely make this again!  Next time I will see what other things we can add to this to make it even more interesting!

Wow, we loved this salad!  I would highly recommend trying it.  I used fat free mayo and made the dressing in the food processor, and didn't have any problem with the dressing that some people mentioned. I used three hearts of Romaine and could have stood just a bit more dressing for that amount of salad, but it was a great change from traditional taco salad.

I liked this, altho I will be making a few modifications next time. Although the dressing was very good, it was a bit too oily. I will cut down on that next time. Also keep in mind, do not add the crumbled corn chips until ready to serve because mine got very soggy as it sat around for a half hour or so!! Soggy chips are not so good. Use fresh tomatoes as I used a can of diced tomatoes which added to the overall sogginess. I also will be using sliced ripe black olives next time as the green olives made it too salty. I did not use hot pepper sauce, I threw in a serrano pepper into the blender and it was just right. 
Lastly, I will be adding a few more ingredients next time. Grilled chicken breast (shredded); black beans; and corn kernels. Can't wait to try again!

As with everyone else we couldn't get enough of this salad.  My son had thirds and claimed "This is the best salad I've ever had!" I didn't have green onions on hand so I left them out and it didn't make or break the recipe.

This is the best, most requested, salad I've ever made. FYI...you HAVE to include the olives, even if you don't love olives. They really add a saltyy component.

I didn't have an avocado but had store bought guacamole in the fridge so I used some of that and the dressing was tasty even if I was skeptical when making it. The 1st bite of my salad convinced me to keep this recipe.Don't be fooled by the light greenish colour of the dressing.

This was good, however the dressing was way to oily!  I would cut the oil in half if not more.  I also added dried cranberries.  Other than the oil issue it was great.

This salad is a miss for me.  It is basically a taco salad without the meat.   I think it would make a much better recipe if it included chicken strips or taco seasoned ground beef on top.  Also, it is VERY SALTY because of the corn chips and the green olives.

Yum!  My husband and I love this recipe and have been enjoying it for 3 years.  Once we get to the crumbs on a bag of corn tortilla chips, it's time to make this salad!

This was okay, a little weird. I didn't put the green onions in, used yellow peppers instead. I also did not put the corn chips in as I am doing low-carb, so I crumbled a few whole wheat crackers in, which was fine. The dressing was what threw me. Everyone raved about how good it was, and it was all right, but really, really rich. I didn't feel like I was eating healthy since it was so thick and gooey tasting.

Really really good salad!  I will definately make this again.  Next time I will omit the salt completely because it was really salty...and I usually don't find foods to be too salty.  Delicious!!

I did not like this recipe at all.  There was way too much oil in it so I ended up throwing it away.  I love avocadoes but did not care for this recipe.  It may be better if the oil is lightened up a lot.

Best thing ever! I have been making this recipe for years (I just now got around to actually rating it) and everyone who tries it loves it. I often add cilantro and use tortilla chips if I don't have Fritos on hand.

Exceptional dish. With so much great flavor, it's hard to believe it's really a salad and has lots of nutritious ingredients. It's also got wonderful texture and color, and it is great as a dinner entree or a party salad. My favorite part about making this recipe was that I could guesstimate most measurements so I didn't have to fill up the sink with dirty measuring cups and spoons. I will be making this one again and again for its vibrant flavor, and I'll be sharing it with those family members who don't usually enjoy salad--I know they'll love it.

My whole family loved this recipe.  I took the suggestions of others and cut down on the mayo and oil and it was not oily at all for us.  I also added a little water to thin it a bit.  I think I would use black olives next time as it does resemble a taco salad.  A keeper for us.

I have made this recipe several times and it is always great!  I don't add the cheese as I don't like cheese in salads.  But I've always gotten rave reviews from guests when I've made this.

This was a fantastic recipe!  We used it for my mother's 50th birthday bbq and it was a huge success.  I used sunflower seeds in place of corn chips, and put chopped avacados on the top of the salad.  Will definately use this again!!!

Very tasty dressing.  I put two small avocados, 2 cloves of garlic, a little more olive oil and the juice of one lemon in it.  I also used iceberg lettuce instead of romaine, as that is all that I had.  It was a traditional, yummy-tasting taco salad.  I recommend it!

I found this to be really good.  In response to those who thought it was too thick-I just didn't put tons on the salad.  I forgot the olives, and cut out the majority of the mayo and added another avocado to make up for it.  Instead of lemon, I used lime because that made more sense to me.  The salad was also great with taco sauce, although I don't know if it would be with the olives in it.

This salad is absolutely amazing.  The blend of flavours are spectacular.  So glad I didn't omit corn chips as I intended to do.  They add texture and flavour.  For the mayonnaise, I substituted half and half mayo and sour cream.  I will definitely make this again and again and use the recipe for pot luck dinners without hesitation at all.  I know it would be a hit.

i was looking for an avocado dressing recipe and this was a great base for what i had in mind.. i was worried about it being too oily so i left out the olive oil and used 1/4 c of lemon juice instead.. i would have liked it more if it was yogurt based bc i felt like i kept looking for tart/sour notes.. like others i threw in some cilantro.. also added a small jalapeno that i removed most of the seeds from and a little bit of onion powder.. it was very tasty.. i used this on a simple chicken salad (romaine, cucumber, shredded carrot, leftover chicken breast, and cheddar).. ty for the start of a delicious lunch

i don't really write reviews anymore, but i had to write one here because this salad is genuinely one of my favorite recipes ever. i've been making it for years now. the dressing is incredibly tasty, & i love the combination of fresh, creamy, and spicy flavors, along with the crunch from the tortilla chips. the only change i make is to use black rather than green olives.

I give this between 3-4 stars. It was confusing to whether this was a side salad or a main dish salad. It seemed heavy enough to be a main salad, but seemed like it would be better with beans, corn, or maybe grilled chicken to make it a full meal. The only change I made was only making half the dressing. I used lite mayo and because my avocado was small I just used the whole thing. The dressing was kind of thick with using the whole avocado, I believe, so I added a couple of splashes of milk. I am glad I halved the dressing, because I still thought the lettuce mixture was slightly too heavily coated.

This recipe is a favorite in our house. Quick, healthy and super delish! We usually add grilled prawns or chicken and serve it for dinner.  There is usually plenty of leftover dressing, which we are more than happy to eat with tortilla chips the next day.

Extremely tasty salad! The dressing is unique and makes all the difference. I've made this for several different groups of company and always got requests for the recipe (including my very picky, non-salad eating teenage sister-in-law). We either use black olives or omit them altogether. Also do not add the dressing until you're ready to serve as the corn chips will soak it up and get soggy. It still tastes great, but the texture isn't so nice.

This is one of my favorite salads.  Served it for Christmas dinner and it was a hit with everyone.  Then served it as a meal, adding a can of rinsed and drained black beans for protein.  I will be adding this to my short list of mainstay recipes.

This salad came out really good with the changes and additions I made. After reading the reviews, I cut back the mayo, used lime juice instead of lemon and doubled it. I added some ciantro and some salsa and played with the consistency of the dressing until it was thin enough to add to the salad (individually, but on the whole salad). It was still thick, but had wonderful flavor! I also added some shredded rotissary chicken to the salad. My whole family enjoyed this!
