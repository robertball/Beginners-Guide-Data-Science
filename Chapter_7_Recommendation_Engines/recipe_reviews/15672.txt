The Brazil nuts in the crumb topping added a wonderful flavor-what a good use for them. This is quite sweet(not as sweet a mincemeat pie, though) I added a chopped pear, too.

Excellent! This recipe is an easy way to have a taste of Christmas without having to make pastry for a pie or go to the trouble of making a Christmas pudding.  So simple, so delicious, a keeper for our family.  Enjoyed it slightly warm.
