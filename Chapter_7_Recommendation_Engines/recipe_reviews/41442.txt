This is an EXCELLENT old-fashioned recipe.  I can understand why this got a few bad reviews-it's a tad complicated to put together the first time around.  Here's my 2cents worth to make this pie a little easier to make: When I beat the yolks and sugar together, I could not get all the sugar to dissolve.  To remedy this, I added my lemon juice next (and, in fact, I used the juice of ½ lemon) and beat this nice and smooth.  Instead of tapioca, I added 3 tablespoons of flour to this mixture. (I prefer flour to tapioca as a thickener in my pie: either will do nicely) Then add the salt, stir in the milk,and then the blueberries.In a separate bowl, beat your egg whites nice and stiff, and gently fold into the blueberry mixture.Sprinkle the flour and sugar into the pie shell as the recipe suggests,and pour in the filling.I found the top of the pie turned golden very quickly;I tented tinfoil over the top to slow this down for the rest of the baking time.BE SURE to tent it ‘high',this pie rises like a souffle during baking, (then sinks as it cools) and if the top touches the foil,you will lose your meringue-like crust! I also covered my crust edge in foil to prevent browning.The end result is a mouth-watering, seconds-please blueberry pie unlike any other.There is a thin ‘custard' like bottom, a creamy blueberry middle, and a thin meringue crust.You will NOT be disappointed with this one-THANK YOU,Barbara, for sharing this family treasure!

Yummy!  My husband said it was the best blueberry pie he'd ever eaten.  Don't expect "meringue" it is more of a thin meringue-like layer.  Also the "layers" aren't that thick which is where some of the confusion is coming from.  But the blueberries and "cream" do kinda separate.  I used frozen berries.  Can't wait to try it with fresh!

I made this pie twice - the first time I did it while I was on vacation at a friend's house.  He did not have a stand alone mixer, so I incorporated the eggs and sugar with a hand mixer and stopped after 6 minutes.  Also, I was using a prepared pie shell, which made a big difference (I used a 9" shell).  The pie was good, but I could see the potential!!

When I came home I started all over again - this time with my stand alone mixer.  I beat the yolks a full 15 minutes, and incorporated the sugar over 10 of those minutes.  This step made the big difference.  Also, I cut back to 1 pt of blueberries.  Those two changes and the pie was superb!!  

Give it a chance - you won't regret.

This pie did not come out well at all. There was hardly any custard in it, and although it looked good when it came out of the oven, as it cooled it went flat! It tasted ok, but not a keeper for me.

This is probably the best tasting blueberry pie we have ever had and I will definitely make it again.  However, it doesn't look very appetizing because the meringue gets dark even though I tented it with foil midway through the baking.  Also, I was unable to get the sugar to dissolve with the egg yolks - there just wasn't enough liquid.  I beat this for 20 minutes with no success.  I had to add drops of water.  I'm wondering if some ingredient is missing here!

I followed the recipe and it did not turn out with a custard. There was a little bit of meringue on top. I don't know what I did wrong. It sounded so good but, it turned out more like a cobbler.

I never did get the sugar to dissolve completely into the egg. I tried FOREVER! But it didn't matter because it turned out great. It didn't have the distinct layers as I guess its supposed to, but it did have a thin crunchy coating of meringue on top. Whatever - we LOVED it!

More work than it's worth.  I picked it because it looked like a challenging, delicious pie.  I was disappointed however with how it tasted.  Not what I was expecting.  Won't be one I try again soon.

What a great recipe - even tastier with a teaspoon or so of finely grated lemon zest added along with the lemon juice!  I've made a 9-inch deepdish pie version of it several times now, using just a pint of blueberries, as suggested, and making no other changes in the recipe other than adding lemon zest.  I'm not sure my sugar completely dissolved in mixing, even after 15 minutes of beating plus beating with lemon juice, but it didn't affect the outcome.  I've been careful to see that my blueberries are completely dry before using them, since the problems some have had with the recipe sound like there was too much liquid, and the pie has been perfectly wonderful, every time.

This is a very good blueberry pie recipe. It was a little hard blending the egg yolks and sugar, especially with just a hand electric mixer, but well worth the work. I will bake this pie again!

This pie took sometime to prepare, but worth every minute of it. I've made many pies over the years, but I have to say as far as blueberry pies go this turned far better than any I've made. My husband, son & I love it. Our next door neighbors let us pick their blueberries because they didn't want them. I made two pies and gave them one of them. They loved it also. Will use this recipe a lot.

This was so good, my family said it was the best they had ever eaten.  I used heavy whipping cream as a substitute for milk, and it worked very well.  Will be making this many more times!

I really don't know what happened with this recipe.  I am a pretty good baker but this pie did not turn out well.  I followed the recipe to the letter. But the meringue started burning before the time was up.  I let it cook as long as I could before it burned.   The blueberries were yummy inside, but it was not a firm pie at all.  All I seemed to get was blueberries in a crust with meringue and some very runny cream.    The blueberries cost me a small fortune for it to have turned out so mediocre.  The only reason it is mediocre was because the blueberries were sweet and tasted nice.

Not for the amateur, evidently.  Ended up without the mentioned layers (merengue above custard).  Just ended up with a foamy, blueberry pie.  Interesting outcome.

Well...I made this recipe again and used 1 tbs. and a 1/2 of instant tapioca. It turned out great! It did take about twice the time to cook. I would reccomend increasing the oven temp a tad and definately place foil over the pie!! Mine was still burnt (not too bad though) around the edges...but it was still good. It didn't seperate really either. Althoug, my husband loved it. I found him in the refrigerator numerous times sneaking forkfuls of it until it was all gone. I think I would rather have made a regular blueberry pie. I was trying to save money by making this recipe because you need like 4-5 cups of fresh blueberry's for a pie. It was good. I don't know if I'll make it again though. Merangue isn't my thing anyway. It's hard to get it just right.

I'm not sure if it was me or the recipe, but this did not turn out.  There were no layers except for a thin burnt meringue topping and what happened to the custard? There was none. I even took it out of the oven early because it was starting to burn.  I was so disappointed.

This has become my "go to" blueberry pie recipe.  I have tweaked it a little.  We don't like excessively sweet deserts, so I cut the sugar by at least 1/2 (I have used as little as 1/4 cup.
I also increase the tapioca to 1-1/2 tbls.  This makes it set just a bit better. Excellent pie recipe!

First let me say that photo here does not do it justice!  Mine is much more attractive!. I've made it twice now, doing a gluten-free crust, and I think it has made my "favorite dessert list" for sure! It is important to have a really good crust on it.  I  use an "old fashioned dough" recipe that calls for both butter and shortening, a little bit of sugar, and an egg mixed with the cold water that is used to bring it to a dough.  It is lovely served warm with ice cream, and in fact, we found that it paired splendidly with frozen greek yogurt, something I don't typically think of as yummy... but my husband bought it, and it really complimented the pie!  I made one last night, and it's all I can do to keep myself from grabbing bites of it all day today!

I made this pie to use some of my hand picked low bush blueberries. They are most delicious but I wanted them to serve more people so looked for a blueberry cream pie. I had no idea that anyone would have a recipe like this.What a peasant surprise and what a rewarding result. My husband and 2 friends thought it absolutely wonderful - so did I!
I have yet to go wrong with an Allrecipes recipe. Another winner going into my home and cottage recipe books.
