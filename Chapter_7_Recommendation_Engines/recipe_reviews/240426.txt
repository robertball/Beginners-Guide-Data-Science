I went into this recipe knowing that I was going to make 2 changes. I had ground beef and so that is what I used and then I couldn't imagine veggie soup without potatoes so I diced up a couple and added them. An hour into cooking  I gave it a stir and just felt there was way too much broth compared to the amount of veggies. All I had in the pantry was a can of pinto beans so I drained them and threw them in there. This recipe is good but I honestly think it needs more veggies than it calls for. I suggest using at least 2 cans of green beans or maybe even adding a can of mixed veggies to the mix. 2 hours was also plenty of cook time for me.

Turned out great! My first time ever making soup. Added potatoes and used frozen veggies and it was delicious.

I tweeked it a little, and put in Chicken Broth, instead of Beef, and some left over Sausage, and Spaghetti Noodles, broken up, and some seasonsings. Tastes yummy.

Loved it because I used this as a"sample" and created my own. Made a bunch of changes - I used:
*32ox mirepoix mix-trader joes
*2 C  prime rib meat - cooked and chopped
*8 C beef stock
*14oz diced tomatoes
*2 C water
*1 can corn, water included
*2 bay leaves
*1 strip kombu
*2 C uncooked brown rice.

Saute mirepoix mix. Add sirloin when almost done. Stir well. Add diced tomatoes, beef stock, water, corn, bay leaves, kombu.  Cook Med-low for 2-3 hours. Add rice. Simmer 45 minutes.

This soup  is excellent.  I worked with what I had on this winter day. I nudged the simple recipe  by using  two 12oz cans  V8 ,  two  bags  frozen mixed vegetables, and no tomato sauce or paste. Instead of fresh beef broth, I had about 3 cups of frozen beef broth leftover from a roast this summer; the frozen beef broth had diced tomatoes in it. For medicinal purposes, I added 1 teaspoon of celery salt.

Made this into a Tomato Beef soup by adding sliced carrots in place of the green beans and corn, and replaced the can of tomato sauce with 2 cans of diced tomatoes.  Served with egg noodles and it tastes just like my Grandmother used to make!
