This sounds almost identical to the cheese ball my mother used to make each year.  One helpful taste addition to this receip with the dried beef is WORCESTERSHIRE sauce!  It really adds a zing to the flavor.  Note that this type of ball improves with age, so make it a few days ahead of when you want to eat it.

THIS IS A GREAT CHEESE BALL!  IF USING DRIED BEEF IN THE JAR, RINSE AND DRY THE BEEF BEFORE MIXING INTO CREAM CHEESE.  THIS HELPS CUT DOWN THE SALT!!  THE BEST!!

Great cheese ball recipe.  I make something very similar to this but I omit the walnuts and add a tablespoon of worcestshire sauce.  Someone else mentioned that this gives this a "zing" and I agree.

This is THE BEST cheese ball!  I had this recipe when I lived in Pittsburgh Pa. years ago and lost it, And could not remember what was in it other than dried beef. Thank You!!  Except I also put onion and garlic powder in it for taste.

This is very similar to the recipe a coworker shared with me.  I made it for a group and it went over very well.  I used 2 packages of cream cheese, 2 green onions and 1 jar of dried beef.  I served it in a bowl nested inside a larger bowl to hold 2 types of crackers (round butter crackers & thin square wheat crackers).  It was gone in no time at all.  Probably should double this one!  Yummy!!

Simple is always best. I did add a dash of red pepper, a splash of lemon juice and 1/2tsp of dry mustard. We roast our pecans in the south in butter and garlic (350) and stir till dark brown - chop those and mash em on the cheese ball for whole 'nother gear.

If I make this again I will definitely take the suggestion of another review to rinse the dried beef.  As is this cheeseball is very salty.  I did add the worcestershire sauce. The flavor combination is good though

I make this around Christmas time every year and it's always a hit! I usually get at least one person that wants the recipe. Great appetizer to take to a party! Full flavored & super simple to make.
