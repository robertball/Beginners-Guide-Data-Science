Mmmmm!  I love this recipe!  While the chard was wilting, I added chick peas (garbanzo beans) to the skillet, and served the whole thing over a sort of quinoa "pilaf".  Also, using red chard gives the chick peas a lovely, slightly pinkish colour.  Altogether, this makes for a complete, easy, and delicious meal.  Thanks for the recipe!

Really good. Added a bit of lemon to it and used honey instead of maple. Same effect, delicious dish.

Love this recipe with 2 personal modifications: chopped fresh garlic to the onion/ginger/stems... and instead of maple syrup, I drizzle Agave Nectar!

This was absolutely wonderful!  I used Organic Blue Agave Nectar instead of the Maple syrup (which I was out of) and added chick peas along with the onions and stalks, then served it over brown rice.  The taste of fresh ginger with the chard was a nice surprise.  What a treat!

What a gem of an idea.  The ginger takes boring old swiss chard to a new level.  I think the next time I make this I will add a clove of garlic too.  Thanks WyndWoman, this is a keeper.

This recipe is delicious! Even my husband who normally hates green leafy vegetables (or in fact practically any vegetables!), really liked it and asked for it to be made again the same way. The only reason I am giving it 4 and not 5 stars is because the directions are inaccurate. This recipe took me almost an hour to prepare, and not 20 minutes as is stated in the directions! This considering that I only made half the suggested serving size! The chard stems alone took about 20-25 mins to soften on medium heat, and the leaves took A LOT longer to wilt on "low" than 2 minutes (I would say about 15 mins at least?) I started cooking ahead of time, thinking that I'll have this ready even before the main course (freshly caught rainbow trout and mashed potatoes), but as it turned out, we were about half way done with our meal, before I could serve the chard. Nonetheless, the flavors work really well together, and I really like the idea of saving and using the stems, when so many recipes call for discarding them. They are similar in texture to celery, but have a much milder taste. So, bottom line - this is delicious and I highly recommend the recipe, but you should plan to start cutting the leaves and cooking at least 45 minutes to an hour before you plan to serve this.

This recipe was interesting. The flavor that maple syrup adds is...a little off for me. I love dark leafy greens cooked almost any way, but there are better recipes than this for chard.

The maple syrup on this was amazing!  I did not have fresh ginger so I used a little powder, probably not the same, but it turned out perfect anyway!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this using some candied ginger I recently made and the syrup used to candy the ginger. It was delish!!!  Several years ago I heard someone on TV saying they stored their ginger in some sterile potting soil.  I did that and when it started blooming I put the pot outside.   I have not needed to buy ginger since.  I live in Florida so this might not be the case in colder climates, but if you have some extra ginger you might want to give it a try.

I found that the flavos were unbalanced -- way too much ginger, not enough anything else.  I tried combatting that by adding 2 tsp. soy sauce and 1/2 tsp sugr, which made it better, but still far from awesome.  Maybe I did something wrong, but it was definitely not tasty.

LOVE the maple syrup/ginger combination.  I will try this with other greens now.  I actually made it before I looked at the correction regarding the ginger but my family thought it was delicious.  I cooked the onions, ginger and stems on low so it took a while longer but it was worth the wait. Thank you!

I made this exactly as directed, with the exception that I used all green chard, as that was what I had on hand.  Both my husband and I loved it!  The ginger and the maple syrup, exceptionally delicious!  I can't wait to make it again with the rainbow chard.

I love Swiss chard and this is a creative way to prepare it. The chard reduces quite a bit when cooked - this makes 2 decent-sized servings.

I have to agree with the reviewer who said this tasted like beets.  Unfortunately, since we don't care for beets, this wasn't a hit with our family.  It looked beautiful in the bowl though, and kudos for the creative cooking method, which I plan to try with other greens that we like better (thinking collards might be a possibility).  The ginger added bite, and the maple syrup added a delicate hint of sweetness.  I found the cook times to be right on for the stems, but 2 minutes was not long enough for the greens.  After cooking for 2 minutes in the pan, I put the lid on for another 2 minutes and let the greens steam, after which they had reduced just the right amount.  Sorry this dish wasn't for us, but thanks for the idea!

Ginger & chard could be my new favorite combo! Didn't have maple syrup so just used a tablespoon of brown sugar and worked fine. Use just a dash more pepper than you think and it will be amazing!

I really dislike sweet foods (sweet should be reserved for dessert IMHO), but after tasting I went ahead and added maple syrup, and it really wasn't too sweet. I wouldn't even call it sweet, but the maple syrup did just deepen the flavors. I didn't measure the ginger, just took a tubor of ginger from the freezer and grated off a good big using the micro-grinder.  I will definitely do this again.

This was my first time cooking Swiss Chard.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of mincing the ginger.  I served it over Quinoa with roasted and diced red & yellow peppers (had them left over from a previous meal.
We both liked it very much!  I will definitely make this again.  We've been adding more and varied greens to our diet and is a keeper!  Thanks for an inventive and taste new dish.

I didn't measure my ingredients exactly, but I think I used a bit more than 1 tbs. oil, substituted maple syrup with honey, added 1 tsp. of red pepper flakes and loved this recipe. I also used ground ginger from a jar (maybe 1/8 tsp.?). Spicy but tasty.

I'd never made anything with Chard before, but this turned out great. (For once I made a recipe exactly as written...) The dish has a good balance of sweetness from the maple syrup and spiciness from the ginger. The chard, itself sits very nicely in between those two flavors. Mild, but not boring. The stems add a nice crunchiness to the leaves, which are not totally mushy like spinach, but still nice and soft. Simple recipe with a good payoff! It pairs very nicely with broiled salmon and wild rice.

"This is amazing!  Thanks, Sweetie!" said my husband.  I agree wholeheartedly. What a fantastic dish!  Hubby doesn't like a lot of sweet in his meals, and so I was relieved to hear that he loved how the ginger balanced with the maple syrup and chard.  I did add a can of chickpeas as some others had suggested, and we loved getting to use the chard stems.  Such great textures and flavors in this dish!  I never would have tried all these ingredients together, but this is my new favorite chard recipe!

A good recipe. I will make it again, for sure. It didn't "wow" me, but my husband liked it and we have a lot of Swiss chard in the garden. This recipe will be in the rotation. Thanks for sharing it!

Fantastic variation on sautéed Chard. Ginger & Caramelized Onion are genius in this dish! Fresh, sweet mmmm, Will make again. Chard can have an earthy, bitter taste some don't like. This removes that argument from picky eaters. :)

Easy? YES. Delicious. Not really spicy, unless you consider ginger spicy. It might be good with a pinch of red pepper added with the onions and ginger saute. I cooked it in garlic oil, but could add a minced clove of garlic. Don't forget the salt and pepper. A great way to prepare summer greens. Kids might even be convinced to eat some because of the slightly sweet taste.

Super simple to make and was delicious!  I usually have quite a bit of Swiss Chard that comes up all at the same time, so I love having various alternative recipes.  This will definitely be a keeper and my family agrees- thanks for the great idea!

We liked this a lot and it was easy to make. It didn't seem spicy at all and the next time I make it I will try to spice it up, maybe with red pepper flakes or Sriracha sauce.

My husband who hates chard liked this recipe! Had just a bit too much ginger for me, so I'll cut back on that a bit. Nice combination of sweet and spicy. This is a really nice alternative to my usual balsamic vinegar recipe, and it was quick and easy to make.

Loved it!  Used powdered ginger and agave syrup instead of maple and it was amazing!

I remember eating Swiss Chard with my Grandpa.  He added both sugar and vinegar, so I tossed about a tablespoon of Balsamic Vinegar over the chard in the fry pan.  I also added a glove of garlic minced with the onion and ginger.  We drizzled the syrup over the chard at the table.  Delicious, just like eating with Grandpa.  Hubby liked it so much, I made it again the very next night.

Recipe was ok. I keep trying to make myself like chard by trying new recipes and thought the maple syrup would help. It didn't.

Quite tasty! But you have to like the flavor of chard, lest it might be a little strong for some.

Delicious, with one small caveat: It took me WAY longer than two minutes to get the chard to edible tenderness. Perhaps it depends on how you like your greens. I like mine tender, and after two, even five minutes, these were still crunchy. So I put the top on my deep skillet and continued to "steam" the chard until it was quite tender - at least ten more minutes.

I had never really tried Swiss chard before, and what a way to get introduced to it!  The ginger really added great flavor.  I used honey instead of maple syrup and it was delicious!  I'll definitely be making this healthy and delicious side dish again!

Loved this and I, too, used Organic Blue Agave for the lower glycemic index. Used a little more ginger since it is a favorite. Fabulous new recipe for us!

Very good and easy recipe.  i served it with rice and the "slow cooker thai peanut pork" recipe from this site.
