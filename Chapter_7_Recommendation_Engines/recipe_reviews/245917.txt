very good recipe, gravy was super. sausage was tender and good. used red bell pepper, instead of the celery,  had to add a bit more broth to keep it juicy. but it was very good
thanks Hillshire farms for a  good, quick and easy meal.

I`m sorry, the Thyme...we could not eat it after a few bits. but it has  a good base. I`m going to try again, but take out the Thyme and add 1 cup of dice pre-cooked potatoes and 1/2 cup of frozen pea`s .But thank you , I would not have even thought to make a pot pie with Sausage(it is a great idea ) we just have to make our`s

I was skeptical because I am not a big fan of vegetables, but this one skillet dish is simple and delicious!

10.10.18  I baked these in oval-shaped pie pans (about 4.5”x6.5”) and ended up with four. I always sub Hillshire Farm® Chicken Hardwood Smoked Sausage in any recipe that calls for smoked sausage, and it was delicious in this pie.  The only addition I made was adding a few red pepper flakes and some freshly-ground pepper.  The pie filling was the perfect texture, moist but not runny, exactly the way a pot pie should be.  Nothing fancy here, comfort food for sure, but baking them in the individual pie pans also added some eye appeal and just a bit more interest. Served with some freshly-cooked apples.  Nice and easy recipe.

Quick and easy. We enjoyed it but I don't think it will be a favorite.
