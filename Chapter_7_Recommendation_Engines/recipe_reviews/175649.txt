I also scaled this recipe down for 4 people.  My husband, two teens and I all loved it.  I've been trying to find a recipe that can rival the frozen wedges readily available in stores, and I have finally found it.  The only changes I made were using fresh, chopped garlic because I didn't have garlic powder, and I added some smoked Paprika for added taste and color.  I'll definitely make this recipe again.

I cut this recipe in half. I found I had the same issue that Pam-3BoysMama had in that the rosemary just would not stick on the potatoes. I think I'd like to try this again without the flour and breadcrumbs and see if I don't have better luck with the spices sticking. I think it might be better.

I love Rosemary. Unfortunately, I really couldn't taste it on these potatoes. Most of the herb stayed behind in the bowl. I tried adding more, but it wouldn't stick due to the breading. They did have a nice flavor and made for a pretty plate, but were a little dry.

Scaled this down to feed 4. It was very good. I turned up the temp toward the end to 500 to brown them a bit more. I skipped the butter step and just used olive oil. I suggest adding more rosemary before baking cause some will stick to the prep bowl and its hard to get off.

I scaled this recipe WAY back, but I only added the listed ingredients basically in the recommended proportions.  We all liked it, but it could have used more flavor, via extra seasoning.  I'll make this again, next time adding more salt, onion powder, and garlic powder.

Added extra seasoning, as the other reviews suggested and they turned out great. Weren't as crunchy as I thought they should be, even though they were browned when I took them out of the oven. When I reheated them in the oven the next day, they were a bit more what I expected the first night, as far as the crunch. My husband and son loved them, too!

Terrific recipe, E-Z and flavorful.  Rave reviews from dinner guests.  

Like others, I cut it way down for a smaller group, which reduces baking time as well. Check it after half an hour.

A couple of tweaks:  Instead of garlic salt and onion salt I used fresh minced garlic and a chopped shallot, then some sea salt.  Worked great.  I'm sure white-end of a scallion or any other finely chopped onion would work well, too.

This is a keeper, thanx.

These were great but I made them very simply. I just sliced as wedges and put into a baking dish with butter and sprinkled with parmsean cheese.  I added more cheese when they came out of the oven so that it would melt. I am certain next time i will vary the cheese and was thinking of adding bacon bits too... Thanks for submitting!

These fries didn't live up to my expectations.  The coating didn't stay on (the excess burned while the fries baked) and the flavour was quite bland.  The texture of the fries was quite good.

Yummy wedges! I cut down the recipe to 10 servings, and we had some leftover for the next day. I found the mixture didn't stick to the wedges very well (maybe next time I will try more butter), so I packed them tightly on the pan and poured over what was left of the mixture. Very good! Will make again.

If I eliminate the flour or nearly eliminate it and turn the wedges over half way through the cooking time I think I would like these. Mine didn't have much flavor and they burned on bottom.

These are fantastic. I didn't exactly measure out the spices, and I'm pretty sure I used more than the recipe called for, but they turned out delicious. I did scale the recipe back and it didn't take the full 45 minutes for them to get nice and crispy, so you may want to keep an eye on them while they're cooking.

I made and served these for a dinner with friends, and the reviews were stellar. All I had on hand were russet potatoes, and the recipe still turned out well. I used panko crumbs instead of bread crumbs, and found the cooking time required was less than the 45 minutes indicated (I did scale the recipe back, for 6 people, so there would have been less volume in the oven).

Used 6 potatoes, 2 tbs. olive oil, 1 tbs. bread crumbs, 1 tbs. wheat germ, 1 tbs. Smart Balance, 2 tsp. garlic powder, salt, pepper, dried rosemary, and a dash of seasoned salt. Baked on 450 for 45 min and broiled on low for another 5 min. Really quick and easy!

I also scaled the recipe way back(gotta love this feature from AR) and i made half of it healthier by omitting the butter and oil and just moistening the potato wedges with water before running them through the bread crumb mixture. I'm always trying to save a few calories for me while still pleasing my butter loving husband! Although the healthier version did not brown as well, they were still crispy and very flavorful. We both enjoyed these potatoes.

Very nice recipe! I love oven roasted potatoes and these had a nice coating which was a bit different. I scaled this way back and basically eyeballed the ingredients. Definitely add more spices and cut back on the flour!  I also added some Parmesan cheese to the mix and overall, this was very good.

I also scaled this down for 4 people. Skipped the butter and used all olive oil, though that may have caused the potatoes to not brown as much as they could have. Added about 1/4 c. of grated parmesan to the flour/breadcrumb mixture. Hubby and kids both loved it, and are expecting it to get added to the list of regulars. Thanks for a great idea!

This is a great recipe. I followed the directions however the coating did not stick well. They did get crunchy though. If you love rosemary you will love these.

Made a smaller portion and used red potatoes. We loved it! I can't wait to make it again. I had no issues with the potatoes sticking to the pan and they had just the right amount of crunch. When you add the flour mix to the potatoes be sure to mix it up good. It should end up like a batter consistency. I also turned them half way thru cooking.

I just made this for the first time. I didn't measure anything. I did half and half butter and olive oil. Wet the wedges. Made a separate bowl with half and half bread crumbs and flour, with onion salt, salt, and creole seasoning. I dipped it like you do fried chicken. Wet to dry. I don't know if you're suppose to just mix the wet and dry mix together. It was still good just a little flowery.

The recipe calls for way too much salt.  I think I cut mine by half.  I do like the texture of the potatoes after baking them.  I also used paprika instead of rosemary since I love that spice.  It had a good flavor.
