I subbed shallot for chives (what I had on hand), subbed cheddar for colby-jack, regular bacon instead of turkey bacon, and omitted mushrooms. OMG, this was amazing. My 4 year old ate half of it in one sitting, then asked me to make it again the next day.

I made this recipe exactly as written, except I used regular bacon, not turkey bacon.  It was so delicious, even my husband, who "hates" cauliflower, ate a big serving!  I didn't tell him what it was, just served it and he ate it all!  That alone makes it 5 stars for me.  I will definitely make it again.  I especially loved the mini-bellas, chopped into the mix.  Very very good!

Really tasty. I had been looking for something with chicken, cauliflower, and cheese, so I adapted this. I had cooked chicken tenders which I reheated in olive oil with the garlic, salt and pepper, and added some rosemary and crushed red pepper (and a smidge of turmeric). Once heated through,  removed from the heat, added the sour cream and mayo and cheese, then cauliflower, and etc per the recipe. I didn't use mushrooms either. 

Two finicky teenagers and myself gobbled over half of it in about 20 minutes. Delicious! !

My favorite dish! I have always hated cauliflower but with this dish, the flavors where amazing! I used sharp cheddar since that's what i currently had in the fridge. It came out tasty, definitely will be making this dish again.

I made this for an office birthday party honoring a staff member who is on a low carb diet.  It is to die for. I didn’t make one change to the recipe and even my husband told me to make it again!   This is now on my “to do at all times” list!

I used about twice the amount of regular bacon but otherwise made it as written. So good! My husband has been trying the keto diet and he says he definitely wants this again! We both went back for seconds!

Very good!  I used regular bacon.  I used green onion as the scallions didn’t look good at the store.  I used the Monterey cheese with some cheddar mixed in.  Thumbs up from my husband and kids.  It reminded me of a baked potato but with cauliflower instead.  I will make this again.

First time I’ve reviewed a recipe.  For a potato loving girl trying to adhere to a low carb diet, this recipe is a godsend! The only thing I tweaked was less mushroom because I’m not a big fan, and I chopped it fairly finely. I didn’t really get the mushroom until I ate it: the mushrooms act as a potato skin substitute, and that is brilliant!  Also, I added maybe a tablespoon of butter as I hand-mashed the steamed cauliflower. Oh, and used pork bacon. So good!

This dish is absolutely delicious! I used light mayo and 1% sour cream. I used regular, store bought, bacon crumble. I used sliced white mushrooms and green onion as well as cheddar. The only thing that I did wrong was I cooked it for too long so the cheese on top was almost burnt.. my mistake, I read it wrong.  I will definitely make this again!

I substituted real bacon for turkey bacon, green onions for chives, and used white mushrooms and I increased garlic to 3 cloves. The mushrooms weren’t cooked after 20 minutes so I turned down heat to 350 and cooked another 10 minutes. It came out very runny. Thickened up a bit when cooled. Hot it’s More like soup. Tasted good though.

The only things I did different was to use regular bacon and then I had to make my own sour cream with cottage cheese and a dash of lemon because I didn't have any.  I loved it!  And it fits my low carb diet.

Yummy & great 'make ahead' side dish for a crowd!  It's a great low carb, satisfying side dish that can be refrigerated the night before, then baked & brought out when guests are ready to be seated.

Wow...The family loved it! The only thing I added was cooked cubed chicken breast which made this a complete one dish meal. (for the fact the men in my house can't live without meat) I doubled the recipe and it was perfect for my family of 6. (w/ leftovers) I will be making this again! 5 Stars!!

Great! Kudos from my wife. Subbed yellow onion for the chives which I sautéed with white mushrooms and  the garlic for a few minutes before adding to the mix. Didn't have sour cream so used milk and lemon juice. Cheese I had on hand was cheddar and mozzerlla so I used that 50/50. Will make again for sure!

This was so yummy. I didn't add the mayo instead added ranch dressing and more of the seasonings. My family loved it even thought they aren't huge cauliflower fans. Def make again. Thanks for the recipe.

I used regular bacon in place of turkey bacon.  It was delicious.  My husband, who doesn't like mushrooms, liked the mushrooms in this dish.  :)  My picky toddler also loved it. A win all around.

Amazing! My whole family loves this casserole. I did make a few changes.  I didn't have mushrooms so I left them out and I added some dry ranch seasoning. also I used Cheddar cheese.

Very versatile dish. I've made it many times. I've varied the cheese based on what I have: Colby Jack, Jack, Pepper Jack, Cheddar or a mixture of the above. I use real bacon. I've substituted ranch dip when I discovered I was out of sour cream. I've used fresh or frozen cauliflower. Last night, I added leftover mashed potatoes and oyster mushrooms. I rarely measure. Always turns out great.

I like this it was so flavorful with enough very many ingredients. I used Cheddar instead of Colby Jack and Greek yogurt instead of sour cream just to add more protein.

Whatever you do, DO NOT STEAM or BOIL THE CAULIFLOWER.  Roast it in the oven (35-45 min), or your air fryer (25 min). This will make the cauliflower crispy and slightly sweet.  Steaming and boiling only adds water to the cauliflower, making it mushy and watery. I made this following the recipe and then again trying to remove as much excess water as possible....and then finally realizing in need to roast them first.  After roasting it, it has been the best side dish, hands down. I will make it for dinner, parities, and potluck and the kids and adults will always gobble it up.  Follow the rest of the recipe, but please make sure you roast them first (LIGHTLY coated with olive oil.  Salt is optional).

This is delicious! This recipe is a keeper! I too used regular bacon instead of turkey bacon. Thanks for sharing.

I pre-made this Thanksgiving Eve except for the top layer of bacon and cheese, and I omitted the mushrooms.  I filled up nibbling on it because it's delicious!  Even better with the extra layer of cheese, bacon, and green onions.  Definitely a crowd-pleaser.

Good but very rich. I think something like a cream chicken soup concentrate would be better than the mayo, sour cream mix.

Super yummy recipe! I subbed milk w/lemon juice (ie. buttermilk) for the sour cream,  cheddar and goat cheese, and onions instead of green onions since that’s all I had on hand. I added extra bacon as well. Turned out great. I will be making this again!

This was so quick and easy.  My son is an extremely picky eater.  He was the first to finish.  He absolutely loved it.  I also added a little Orange cheddar cheese.  It gave it a nice little twist.  I highly recommend making this receipe and will definitely be making this dish again.

I doubled the turkey bacon to appease my carnivorous husband, and he went back for seconds! I used light sour cream and olive oil mayo because that’s what we had on hand. I also buttered the casserole dish out of habit.

DONT USE MIRACLE WHIP!! My error. Use real mayo. The bite in miracle whip came thru, not too pleasing. I used 1/2 the cheese it said and it was still cheesy. I also spiced 1/2 of it with fresh rosemary, that was delish! Overall, I would make it again. Although I would like a less calorie/fat version.

Turned out great. Made it for the holidays. The recipe was just rich enough to make it special. Left out mushrooms by accident, but was great anyway. Next time will add them in. Highly recommend.

Made it following directions except for adding 8 pieces of regular bacon and substituting mayo for another 1/2 cup of sour cream. Lots of garlic too.

My family loved this dish! Made it without mushrooms but still very flavorful. I liked it maybe even better than a loaded potato because of the moisture.

Yum! Substituted low fat mayo and sour cream, it was really good. Omitted the mushrooms since I didn't have any. Will try again with fat free yogurt for the may. Good flavors.
