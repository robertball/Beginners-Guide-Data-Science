Winner!  I made this recipe with my grand daughter for a festive girls lunch.  Really easy and oh so good!  I used very thin boneless pork loin chops instead of the pork tenderloin and it worked out very well. The pork cooks really fast and the sauce tastes like you spent hours on it.   There were four of us 'girls' for lunch and there wasn't a single morsel leftover.  I garnished with some diced fresh tomatoes.  Next time I will steam some broccoli to go along with it.   Thank you!  Great recipe!

I actually didn't have high hopes for this recipe. Normally, I stay away from anything that has jarred sauces. HOWEVER, this was pretty darn good! I added a little more lemon than called for (and next time I will add more capers), but everything else was the same and it was AWESOME! I couldn't get enough and my husband, who is very picky, especially regarding pork entrees, was pleased as well. A happy husband makes a happy me! I served this with roasted asparagus and potatoes along with a moscato. It was great!

Fabulous recipe - used on pork chops, seasoned, browned and simmered for about 40 minutes in the sauce. SOOOO yummy. Tender, flavorful, moist and absolutely delicious. My husband and son both gave this one a big thumbs up.

Made this recipe tonight and it was awesome!  I didn't have any white wine so I just used water and only used 1/2 the jar of sauce (only cooking for 2).  I also left out the cayenne.  I added fresh garlic to the sauce also just before I put the pork back in.  It was a big hit and my husband (who refuses to eat anything with an Alfredo sauce) loved it!

I over cooked my pork chops but aside from that it was a great recipe.  Taste was excellent.

Turned out great. Pork was moist and tender. Served over smashed potatoes . I subbed artichoke for capers because of what I had on hand. Very quick to put together.

very nice.  I cooked pork two minutes per side them warmed again in sauce. the sauce was a beautiful Alfredo.  best I've ever made.  the wine and lemon take it to the next level.  I made homemade Alfredo sauce, not from a jar.

Absolutely delicious! I used boneless pork chops and dried thyme. Put the chops back in the sauce & let simmer until all the side items were finished. We LOVED this! Thank you, Marianne!

Did not care for this at all.  Maybe it was the Alfredo Sauce from a jar (I've never used that before), but didn't think it had much flavor and I even added extra garlic and some mushrooms.  Won't be making this again.

Made as written. Needs more capers, lemon zest and conservative amounts of the spices, just doesn't make for a wow dish. The Alfredo sauce hides all the fresh spices. Nevertheless, Thank You for Sharing.

This was just ok. I made it exactly as written. We like Alfredo, we like pork, but this just wasn't anything wonderful. I think it was the pork and Alfredo sauce that just didn't seem to mesh.

This was incredible! Our little store was out of tenderloin so I sliced and tenderized some boneless pork loin instead and it was great. I did leave out the capers though - not my taste. For a change there were no leftovers!

Made the sauce from scratch, added mushrooms and Worcestershire sauce.  Then poured over whole tenderloin and baked at 350 for approximately an hour.  Served with spaghetti.

The sauce is really great and all the spices are nice and tasty!  I made this with 6 pork chops for my family so I upped the spices to be about enough for each chop. Very good sauce but makes a bit too much. I would cut the sauce in half.

I used bottled sauce in one batch and home-made (the B. Mason recipe from this cite) in another.  No one would touch the bottled sauce after tasting and most thought the home-made was to die for.  Interestingly, the pork medallions from the above recipe were a huge success, otherwise I would have rated this only one star.

Amazing! I didn't have onion powder so used a little of a blended seasoning, Pleasing, from a local shop and added a little celery salt. I also doubled the recipe as my pork tenderloin was bigger than 16 ounces. Other than that, I followed the recipe and my husband and I love it. I will definitely be making this again.

It was wonderful! The only change I made was to remove the pork from the pan after browning and adding it back to heat once the Alfredo sauce was added. Otherwise I followed the recipe to a T. Thank you for this recipe.

Absolutely FANTASTIC and I really don't even like pork!  Made as the recipe called for and it was basically almost gone before I even sat down at the table.  The only thing I think I would add next time is some mushrooms but that is simply because I am a mushroom lover.  Will be making this many more times I'm sure
