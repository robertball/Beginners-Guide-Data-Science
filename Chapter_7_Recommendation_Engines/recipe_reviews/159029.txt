Great easy recipe! I also added the juice from the pineapple to the sauce mixture and doubled the other ingredients in the sauce mixture to compensate for the extra juice. It turned out well as I didn't want to waste the pineapple juice. I served it over rice. Loved it! Will definitely make it again!

This was wonderful!!  Will definitely make again.  The only issue I had was that the sauce was not as thick as I had expected.  Perhaps I might use a tiny bit more cornstarch next time.  Also, I cut the chicken into smaller pieces.  But this was wonderful. Fabulous flavor. Thank you

This is my recipe, so of course, I love it! Spiciness can be increased by adding more crushed red pepper and the chicken should be cut into about 1-1/2" x 1/2" strips (chunks). You can also use fresh veggies or pork for this recipe. Have fun!

There was nothing bad about it, but nothing to rave about either.  My 12 yr old thoroughly enjoyed it, and we'll be making it again because of that.  I thought it was missing something, although the pineapples and apricots were amazingly good in it.

The only reason I can't offer this awesome recipe five stars is because I changed it for necessity's sake. I found this recipe while trying to fix a meal with what was in my pantry and so my ingredients were limited. I used powdered ginger (half the amount)  because I had no fresh, I use fresh garlic (almost twice as much)  because I had no powder, no pineapple, and no green onion. The biggest risk was that I use apricot preserves instead of caned apricots which added a touch of sweetness. I cooked the veggies separate but I'll mix them in next time. Even my skeptical 18 year old nephew loved it....I'll  make this again. It was awesome.

Sorry I did not care for this at all, the flavour was OK, altho certainly not what I would consider spicy.  I used a lot of fresh garlic, rather than powder and I still didn't think the sauce had much flavour.  I also thought the texture of the canned apricots conflicted too much with the slightly crunchy veggies.  If I left the apricots out, and seasoned up the sauce more, would be good, but then it wouldn't be this recipe.

Wonderful recipe! I tweaked the apricot and pineapple amounts based on what I had (more pineapple than apricots) and it was still wicked good. Added some fresh garlic to the ginger, and put some shrimp in there too. As others noticed, the sauce didn't thicken up a whole lot so I added a bit more cornstarch. Still little liquidy, but liked it because the rice absorbed the extra. Definite keeper. Thanks for sharing!

Delicious sauce and chicken!  Instead of frozen veggies, I used fresh bell and sweet peppers, broccoli, zucchini, and tomato and it turned out great.

Wonderful recipe.  I've made this a couple of times now and the whole family enjoys the flavour.  The only reason this is 4 stars rather than 5 is because the sauce does need to be thickened.

To the frozen vegetables I added water chestnuts and fresh snow peas.  I had to leave out the crushed red peppers because our stomachs can't handle them.  However, I do believe it would have been better with them.  Leaving them out, I should have increased the other seasonings.  I plan to do that the next time.  Made according to recipe this would be 5 stars!

I made just as directed, consistency and texture were correct, but the sauce was bland. Needed a lot of seasoning and was just ho-hum. Won't make again.
