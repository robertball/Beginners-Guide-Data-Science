This recipe is the best meal I have cooked in my crockpot. I love Thai flavours and this curry was bursting with them! I like a little heat in my food but my husband does not, so I omitted the chili peppers and I don't use peanut oil so that was left out as well. There was enough heat in the red curry paste to add some zing, but even my husband didn't mind because the taste was so amazing. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. To make sure I got all of the browned bits out of my frying pan, I deglazed it using the beef broth and added that to the pot as well. I would also recommend breaking up the beef once it's cooked to a more "shredded" consistency. That's easy because it's falling apart anyway! That way you can incorporate more of the sauce as you spoon it over the rice. 
We liked this so much that I have just finished putting all the ingredients in the pot to serve to dinner guests this evening. 
I was frustrated trying to find a recipe for beef that was not a stew or pot roast. This turned out better than I had expected and will now be my "go to" meal when I want to serve something especially good and a little different. Thank you for the recipe!

Hands-down the BEST slow cooker meal I've ever made!  For an even more fragrant dish, I sauteed the onion and garlic in coconut oil and used coconut oil instead of peanut oil in the sauce.  I also thickened it at the end with a little corn starch.  So delightful - so tender!!

Really really bland made as written.  It needed lots of jazzing up with more lime juice, sambal oelek, and salt.  I steamed some vegetables and threw them in and that was nice.  Would make again but with above additions.

We really really enjoyed this recipe. I did add extra salt from the get go (seasoned the meat) and ended up adding a touch more again after tasting. Also, browned the meat in the oil instead of adding it to the crockpot.  After the changes I think it was definitely a 5 to my taste.  Next time I might flour the meat to help thicken the sauce (did a slurry at the end this time). Some drizzled sriracha over the top for extra heat!

I followed this recipe exactly except I left out the jalepenos because I was feeding this to my 18 month old. My husband and I love Thai food and eating out, so this recipe seemed great because it was simple. This is nothing like what you'd get at a Thai restaurant. It was pretty bland and not really flavorful at all (I used Thai Kitchen red curry paste). This is more like something my mother-in-law from the midwest would consider an exotic Thai dish. It tasted fine overall and was edible, but I wouldn't call it Thai. This would require major tweaking for me to make again.

Not great, not terrible. The sauce came out much greasier than I expected, even though the beef was of good quality.  I also don't think the flavors came together very well and it didn't have that warm, curry and coconut flavor I would have expected.  I would suggest adding a light cucumber salad or a raita (sp?) with it to compliment.

I liked it and my husband and son liked it (more than me), but it didn't taste anything close to Thai food.  It was like Irish Stew meets Thailand because it was so stew and meatly like.  I would only make it again because my family enjoyed it.

This is so delicious. My household is extremely excited for me to cook this again. I ended up with three pounds of meat, so I adjusted the recipe roughly, mostly by sight, to make sure the meat was covered. I dumped slurry in at the end to thicken it up and we put it over rice. It was amazing. Next time I might try cooking the meat in corn starch as a previous commenter suggested and see if that doesn't thicken it while it cooks so I don't have to add the slurry at the end. I also cooked this on high since I got started late in the morning and didn't have 10 hours to wait for it to be finished on low.

I made this in our Ninja Foodi rather than the slow cooker. It worked like a charm and took about 1.5 hours. Meat was so tender. Seasoning was delicious. Served with rice.

I felt something was missing in the flavor. Maybe just needed more of the Thai curry paste and I will try again with red Thai chili peppers instead of jalepeno.

Most fabulous beef teriyaki I've ever had !    I made a number of alterations to the recipe using more simple ingredients I had on hand .    It did not take the full amount of time recommended .   Only about six hours on though he in the crockpot .     I did not add any hot spicy things like jalape√±os and I dumped in more brown sugar then was recommended .      I dredged the beef in a combination of flour curry and salt  and five Chinese spice blend before Browning .      My beef teriyaki was plenty thick and super savory .       I ended up watering it down significantly to get the right. Consistency .   Since I don't have coconut milk I used extra beef broth and a half cup of old shredded coconut I found in my baking cupboard.  It seemed the other three reviews mentioned that the flavor was not as strong as they would like and that it was too watery so I added Chinese five spice and a lot of curry powder instead of curry paste because I don't have any curry paste Also I will use lemon juice because I don't have lime.               I should add that I had no peanut oil and just used canola. This was so amazing I doubled the recipe and I'm very happy that I did.

I made the recipe exactly because I had never used several of the ingredients; thought I would make adjustments next time if we liked it well enough.  We loved it as is.  The only adjustment I made was to brown the meat and add it to the recipe about 3 hours before serving (hubby thinks meat tastes boiled if added from the start).  I'll definitely maker it again.  The jasmine rice was perfect with it.

I didn't use the jalepeno peppers and used red pepper flakes in their place.  (Someone in my house doesn't like hot stuff.)  It was delicious.  The beef was very tender.  It was a good leftover too!

Lots of potential but bland and disappointing as is. Would try again but will double the curry paste, add at least three extra hot peppers and some fish sauce for depth

This was very tasty, but didn't have enough spices for a strong enough Thai flavor. I'm going to try it again and up the spices.

This turned out really good! As it is, it is not spicy and was a hit with the kids. I made one small adjustment since I used a stainless steel pan for browning. After browning the meat and saut√©ing the onion and garlic and placing them in the slow cooker, I poured 1 cup beef broth (originally 3/4 c) into the pan to loosen up the brown bits. I poured this into the slow cooker. If you browned in a non-stick pan, it isn't really necessary to do this.

AWESOME recipe!!! I added half a red onion, 1.5 green pepper, half a bunch of asparagus and 10 small potatoes. The last 20mins, I added 3/4 cup of water mixed with 2 tablespoons of cornstarch to thicken the sauce.

Great recipe, and easy to make.  Mixed the sauce ingredients after the meat/onion/garlic cooking in a bowl to blend better.  Only used one Jalapeno.  My 11 yr old liked it with the jasmine rice.  He's not a very picky eater but doesn't like spicy food.  The family liked it, so it will be going into the rotation.  Thanks for putting this recipe online.

This is a keeper!    I did change some things because I know our taste, so please no nasty comments.  I used Spring Onions insteads of diced onions, 3/4 tsp. of Red Curry Paste instead of the 3 Tblsp., 2 Tblsp. brown sugar instead of the 1 Tblsp., and I used Thai Fresh Basil and used a lot less than the 1/2 cup.

I only had chicken and tofu on hand (de-boned a rotisserie chicken and fried two packages of tofu cut into triangles in olive oil) I changed the beef broth to chicken and also added 3/4 cup of vegetable broth. I used a full jar of green curry paste and about 2 tablespoons of red curry powder (we like it spicy). Otherwise I followed the rest of the recipe as listed. It came out so flavorful and tender. Next time I'll try the beef. Thanks for a great recipe!!

i follwed the instructions as written, except i used my Instant Pot pressure cooker.  i sauteed the beef to brown it and then drained it as directed and then sauteed the garlic and onion in the pot.  i put everything in the pot and cooked it on the "chili/stew" setting.  When it beeped that it was done, i quick released the pressure and threw in the spinach to let it wilt.  then i served it over brown rice.   my husband loved it but it was so hot he asked me to cut back on the spiciness next time (he did have seconds though!).  The beef was so tender; i would make this again in the pressure cooker.  It only took about 30 mins to cook.

Very tasty. Not at all spicy for my taste. Minor changes - substituted for peanut oil.

Future changes - will thicken after cooking is completed. And will chop the spinach a bit before adding it.

I only used 1/2 jalape√±o because of small kids and it was delish. Even husband who doesn't do spinach loved it.

We absolutely loved this dish. The only change I would make is maybe add another Tbsp of the red curry paste.

The aroma emanating from my slow cooker all day was about to send us into a frenzy!! It was all we could do to wait for dinner time, but it was SO worth the wait. The beef was so tender and the flavor wonderfully savory. This is a keeper!!

I made this yesterday and it turned out TERRIFIC. I was short on time, so cooked on high for 2 hours then turned it to low and it delivered in 6 hours as promised! It was not too spicy - Just perfect.  Not sure why peanut oil was used, which I made a special trip to get. I used lite coconut milk and also put in 2 additional TBSP brown sugar. I will definitely make this again.

I used Light coconut milk because that's what I had but I think regular coconut milk might have made this taste better to me.

I made this as directed (except forgot the basil because we were starving and hurrying) and the whole family loved it: my 2-year old through my picky 13-year old. In fact, everyone had seconds. (That only happens with a handful of favorite meals.) There may be a few tweaks I make next time, just due to preference, but will definitely make again! Would be easy to double or triple and still fit in slow cooker. Served on basmati (our preferred) with edamame on the side and everyone was satisfied.

My 3 star rating is due to the face that I eliminated half of the ingredients I'm sure.  But I wanted to review anyway.  We don't like spicy food so I left out the red curry paste and chile peppers.  My husband doesn't like spinach so I eliminated that as well along with the coconut milk.  However, the dish was still pretty good.  My husband had seconds!  I didn't care for it much but would try it again adding more of my own spices.

This was tasty....and not quite as intensely flavorful as I hoped it would be. Maybe my hopes were too high...but it was not spicy at all.

This was REALLY Good.  Browned the meat in seasoned flour, added a bit more beef stock because we like things saucy; but we'll definitely make this again.  Considering making it with a different protein, like pork.

This was awesome!! I couldn't use red curry paste because of allergies, but used 3T of a reddish curry powder. And omitted the jalapeno bc my kids won't do spicy. I also floured the beef before Browning and the sauce thickened up nicely. Only took about 3 hours in my slow cooker, so I added a little more broth to keep it from getting too thick.

We loved this!!!  I did as the previous comment and browned the meat with a coating of seasoned flour.  I also added 1 Tb. fish sauce and 2 Tb. fresh ginger.   This added another dimension to the flavor.  So good over rice!!!
