I am going to go ahead and give this five stars because it is a good starting point. I knew there needed to be more seasonings added and the reviews verified that. I rubbed olive oil over the tenderloins, followed by some dijon mustard. Sprinkled on garlic powder, salt and pepper and then rolled in Japanese panko bread crumbs with crushed rosemary. Seared on top of the stove with some butter for a few minutes and then put in the oven to finish cooking. Everyone loved this. It looked beautiful, was incredibly moist and simple to prepare. Cannot wait to make it again. Served with sauteed green beans and seasoned potato wedges.

I had no time to marinate and I NEVER make good pork, so I tried this tonight. It was WONDERFUL...so good that this is the first review I'm writing! All three of my kids asked for more, and they won't eat anything! Here's what I did: trim fat, coat with olive oil, sprinkle with salt, garlic powder, onion flakes and cracked pepper. Then I refridgerated it in a bag for an hour, but I think it would have been fine without. Then I poured some Progresso Italian Bread Crumbs into the bag and shook it until coated. Baked at 425 for 45 mintues. It was mouthwatering. Served with mashed potatoes and peas and it was a huge hit with almost no work. Try it!

My teenagers inhaled this one!! I coated the tenderloin with oil and made homemade bread crumbs as my girls can't eat most storebought crumbs as they have milk intolerances. I mixed in oregano, basil, rosemary, onion and garlic powder. This was the most moist pork I've ever had. Do place it on a sheet of tinfoil to keep from having to scrub the pan and tent it with tinfoil, because it burns within a few minutes if left uncovered. Uncover during the last few minutes to brown crust. It certainly helps to have it stand at the end. Overall, it was just terrific

Original Review Dec 2003: This was an incredibly quick and easy recipe.  The presentation is beautiful and it was delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of sprinkling the tenderloins with a little garlic powder and black pepper prior to breading.  It does seem to be a lot of breading, but the crumbs contain all the flavor, and using the amount called for ensures you have enough left for a nice breading after slicing.  Line your pan with foil -- the meat won't stick and you won't have a pan to wash! :)  Update - Feb 2009:  I've made this so many times and just wanted to add that I try to remove from the oven when the internal temp is 145 because USDA guidelines for whole pieces of pork have changed since my original review.  Because pork tenderloins are so lean, you don't want to overcook them as they can easily dry out. A bit of pink is good in this instance! Use a meat thermometer and remove when temp hits 145. Keep in mind that the internal temp will rise a few degrees during the standing process. So juicy, tender and delicious! One of our favorite recipes!

Easy, yes and perhaps you could even get away with elegant depending on what you choose to serve as your sides.  First, you do have to spruce up the Italian seasoned bread crumbs.  I always doctor them up with a bit of garlic, parsley, italian seasoning, crushed rosemary, and Parmesan cheese.  I eyeball everything and mix it together. Now, instead of the oil I tried something a little bit different.  I used an egg wash - two eggs with a little milk.  I dipped the tenderloins in the egg and bread crumb mixture twice, essentially "double dipping" in order to get a nice thick bread crumb coating.  I sprayed the bottom of the pan with Pam to prevent sticking, put the tendeloins in and took the rest of the egg and breadcrumb mixture combined them forming a stuffing mixture and layed that into the pan as well.  I sprayed a little Pam over everything, baked the tenderloins at 400 for 20 minutes, turned them and baked for another 25 minutes.  They were moist, tender, and juicy - perfect.  There's nothing worse than dried out pork!

Excellent dinner tonight! I did alter it some picking ideas from others here. I marinated it for 2 hours in a baggie of olive oil, mustard, crushed garlic, salt & pepper & some sliced green onions.

Then I put the breadcrumbs in a large baggie, placed the tenderloin in & shook it up til it was coated. I baked at 425 covered w/ tented foil. Baked 1/2 hr & then removed foil. Baked til it registered 145 degrees. Let it rest for 10 mins & it was very tender & flavorful. My very picky chef father in law was impressed! I served w/ roast potatoes, salad & leftover green bean casserole we had yesterday (Easter). Thanks for the inspiration!

This couldn't have been any more tender!  Instead of mixing the olive oil with the bread crumbs, I rubbed the tenderloin with the oil, then rolled in the breadcrumbs.  Such an easy dish to serve for company.

This had so much flavor and was so tender and juicy. I seasoned it with onion and garlic salt. Then put it in a medium size bowl rolled it in olive oil then added italian seasoning and bread crumbs in a gallon size ziplock bag, put the pork in the bag and pressed the bread crumb mixture on. Cooked it at 350 uncovered for 1 hour. YUMM
Thank you !!

Two things. The pork should be seasoned first with a pinch of salt and pepper. Then maybe a touch of sage or bay leaf. I use both. Secondly, today's pork is no longer slop-fed like years ago so it does NOT have to be cooked to 165! I tried this recipe and it was too dry without sauce.The fact is with such a lean cut, never cook boneless pork loin past 150-155 at the most. Todays pork is grain fed and does not carry the bacteria it once had. Any good restaurant will cook pork loin to medium at the most. And use a thermometer that you can leave in the meat while cooking. The same reason you don't cut the meat for at least 15 minutes after cooking is the same reason you don't poke holes in it with a thermometer. All the juices will leak out. You can get a meat thermometer with the base that sits on the counter for under $ 10.00. For anyone who roasts meat, this is an essential kitchen tool. It will make all the difference in your roasts. I promise!

One of our favorite pork recipes...and so easy! Should be called "Pork Prime Rib." I rubbed the tenderloin with garlic salt and pepper before breading.  I also used garlic/rosemary olive oil mixed with the Italian bread crumbs. I made a brown gravy with merlot to go with it and it was a PERFECT meal with mashed potatoes and green beans.  Great comfort food!

Wonderful and easy.  Like others, I did season the pork before the breading and oil went on...using pepper, garlic powder, italian seasoning and paprika.  I then used a garlic flavored oil before breading it in a mixture consisting of Panko crumbs and Parmesan cheese.  It does brown up quickley, as others mentioned, so I tented mine with foil for the first half of the cooking time (taking a tip from friend, suemck!).  Will definitely use this one again.  Thanks much!

I made this last night and it was delicious. I did add a few things after reading others reviews. First I combined 1/4 tsp coarse salt, 1/2 tsp cracked pepper, and dried thyme. (I didn't actually measure, but that sounds right.) I rubbed this all over the meat. I had 1 small tenderloin. Next I diced two cloves of garlic and added it to a plastic bag with 1/4 cup olive oil and 1 tbsp Gray Poupon mustard, and placed the meat into marinade for 1/2 hour in the frig. I then mixed 1/2 cup bread crumbs, 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, 1/4 tsp dried basil, oregano, onion power. Combined the garlic marinade, bread crumb mix and a little extra olive oil to make moist enough to stick to meat. Pressed all around sides, placed in a sprayed Pyrex dish with cooking spray, covered with foil, and cooked at 425 for 35-40 minutes. Came out perfect pork temperature, and let rest for 10 minutes before serving. 
Boyfriend smacked it up and said "it was good baby". Thanks,
Molly

I made this following the original directions the first time (with the exception of seasoning the tenderloin with pepper and garlic powder before adding the bread crumb coating) and it was delicious and well-received by my husband. For Easter dinner, I made it and halved the bread crumb mixture because my inlaws are on a lower carb diet and the thick breading might have turned off my mother in law. It was even BETTER with just half the breading, and looked like it was a LOT more effort to make than it was.

Is this tender or what?!  I have to admit that the limited ingredient list worried me a little but then again, it is what intrigued me.  I would highly suggest that you do the recipe “as is” the first time and not modify it to a point that it is not longer the same recipe.  I even broke my rule and decided to tent it for half of the time, after reading some reviews.  I did not come out as “crunchy” as I would have like.  So next time, and there will be a next time, I will not tent it.  However, that did not dent my reaction to how moist, tender, and good this simple recipe was.  Awesome!

Fantastic! Only took a few minutes to put together.  Followed other reviews. Coated with olive oil and added garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper. I rolled in Progresso italian bread crumbs. Lined a shallow baking dish and sprayed with Pam for easy clean up. Covered lightly with aluminum foil. I baked 22 minutes and then turned and cooked another 22 minutes. Browned on both sides very nice. If I didn't turn it, the bottom would have gotten burned and the top would not have browned at all. Excellent flavor and very moist. I will make again.

I found this recipe VERY easy. I took the fellow reviewers advice, and first seasoned the tenderloin with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder. I then took the advice of other reviewers and added a little Panko to the Italian bread crumbs. I coated the entire tenderloin and made a foil tent, since 425 is a very high temp, and I was  concerned it would take longer than 35 minutes. It took approximately 45 minutes, and it came out very tender, and juicy. My son ate so much he game himself a tummy ache, and my boyfriend said this was the best thing I have ever cooked for him. I will definitely make this again!

Easy and Delicious!  I marinated the loin for 45 minutes in lemon juice, olive oil, Dijon and garlic (powder).  Put the Bread Crumbs in a Zip Lock bad and did the Shake 'n Bake thing to coat it.  Cooked at 425 for 35 minutes, rested and had an amazing meat course!  Bon appétit...

Loved this recipe.  Made it exactly as written and it was juicy and flavorful.  Cannot understand why some change the recipe so that it isn't even the same recipe as the originator submitted.

So delicious!  But, the breading always gives me a headache, as it will not stay stuck on with the right thickness, at least not without a not of work. After accomplished to somewhat acceptable, it is so juicy and yummy!

My sister made this dish twice and was raving about it.  I finally decided to make it for dinner for my boyfriend and myself, and it was unbelievably delicious.  I added the olive oil directly onto the pork prior to adding the additional ingredients (garlic powder and black pepper, then bread crumbs, as suggested by other reviewers), and it worked perfectly.  Such a great dish...I would recommend this to anyone.

I just seasoned the tenderloin to my liking, Fiesta Fajita Seasoning, Cavender's Greek Seasoning, and a touch of garlic powder.  (WalMart carries the Fajita and Cavender's.)  Then I just used unseasoned breadcrumbs.  I prefer Panko breadcrumbs because they stay crispy.

I tried this recipe and despite adding additional seasoning found it very plain.  I just want to also say that when a positive review is given, it should be given on the recipe as written.  I have found several recipes in which reviewers give rave review of recipes after listing all they did to change the recipe.  This is really a review of their recipe not the one posted.

You definitely need to lightly lay some foil over this or it will burn, spray the dish with Pam before putting the tenderloin in the oven and for sure use a meat thermometer. It was good.

I have made this many times.  I add salt, pepper and garlic powder to taste in the crumb mixture before adding the oil.  Also, dry your pork loin well so that the mixture will stick to the meat.

This is a good solid simple pork recipe similar to the way I have done it for years, though it should be noted that the USDA has recently lowered the safe cooking temp for fresh pork to 145 degrees, I use a remote meat thermometer and pull mine from the oven at 140, let it rest for 15 minutes and it will hit 150 degrees, let it cool a little aftert that before slicing and you will be rewarded with tender moist  pork, a little pink in pork is fine, but not poultry.

I've made this for years.  Coat the tenderloin with olive oil and roll in crumbs . . . much easier.  I add a little coarse ground pepper and a little extra basil to the mix.  I suggest not over-doing the spices . . . takes away from the wonderful flavor of the pork.  Instead of a flat pan, I roast it.  I haven't met anyone who doesn't like this . . . and it's so easy!    I just read some of the reviews mentioning it was too dry.  The culprit could be your oven.  If you have a gas oven, always reduce the temp. 15 degrees . . . 410 degrees and that goes for everything.

I had very little time to prepare dinner tonight (home from store with a raw tenderloin at 6:45pm on a school night).  This recipe was so easy, and SO good!  (Not to mention the fun it was to slap the olive oil/breadcrumb mixture onto the tenderloin like I was making a mud sculpture...)  My very picky kids gobbled it down in no time and although  I did add some specialty rosemary/garlic sea salts to the mixture, otherwise followed the original instructions exactly.  Served with steamed broccoli and rice pilaf.  I also made a yummy mushroom gravy but this dish really doesn't need it.  It's definitely going to become a regular in this house!

This was so DELICIOUS! My husband ABSOLUTELY loved this! I did do what other reveiwers did too. I spiced it up with garlic salt, rosemary,a little salt+pepper and then rubbed it down with dijon mustard. Then I let it marinate in the olive oil in a bag in the fridge for 1 1/2hrs. Then I took it out and rolled it in the breadcrumbs and put it in a pan with aluminum foil(made a tent)and stuck it in the oven until it reached 145-150 degrees. Took it out and let it rest for 10mins. I also made a sauce from another recipie on here "Pork Tenderloin with Dijon Marsala sauce". It was banging ya'll!! THANKS for sharing!!

This was so moist and tender, and the flavor was wonderful.  I used homemade bread crumbs flavored with oregano, garlic, salt and pepper.  I rolled the loin in the olive oil and then the crumbs.  Thanks for this recipe - I'll certainly add it to my go-to menu ideas!

Absolutely DELICIOUS! Tender, juicy and full of flavor! I seasoned the pork tenderloin roast with salt, pepper & garlic powder, prior to breading. I used Italian flavored Panko bread crumbs and followed the recipe as posted. My family loved it! 
Thank you for this wonderful recipe - will be forever in my recipe collection! YUMMY!

I made this tonight and it was delicious, the meat was very tender and not dry at all.  All I did a bit different was roll the meat in oil, the coat it with Italian bread crumbs to which I added some garlic powder, salt, pepper, oregano and basil.

I've made this twice now, and both times the pork has come out perfectly. Delicious! I rubbed the pork with garlic salt and crushed black pepper first, but otherwise followed the directions as stated.

Great!!  I took other advice and used salt, pepper and garlic powder (mixed it with bread crumbs).  I used egg instead of oil to coat the pork tenderloin in and I pan fried the tenderloin in a fry pan with heated olive oil until the breading turned a nice golden colour.  Afterward I set each tenderloin on a wire cooking rack placed on a baking sheet.  This allowed the pork tenderloin to fully cook and helps drain the oil and liquids while keeping the batter crispy.  I used this cooking method for all my battered dished and they all come out perfect.  I liked this recipe just the way it was but would be interested it trying other spices (rosemary) as other users suggested.  I served this with a creamy bacon & shallot sauce that I concocted and it to die for.  I may need to share the recipe!

This recipe is a keeper! After reading reviews, I decided to add a little salt, pepper & garlic powder to the pork before rolling it in the olive oil and then through the breadcrumbs. I also added grated parmesan to the italian style bread crumbs and put aluminum foil on the bottom of my baking sheet for easy clean-up. The other thing, and I think this was most important - TENT ALUMINUM FOIL OVER THE TOP for the first 27 or so minutes because if I hadn't done that, I'm quite sure the entire topping would have been burned.
Anyway, this was absolutely delicious and very moist. My boyfriend enjoyed it so much that he requested a repeat performance next week.

I used mostly Panko, plus little bit of Italian crumbs + 1/3 part parm & spices (crushed rosemary, garlic power, onion salt/pep). Double dipped in egg then crumbs, and fried to brown, then in over at 400. Next time consider making a sauce for dipping, either pizza or mushrm

An excellent and easy meal to make for a fancy dinner. To avoid burning or mushiness of the crust, cover with foil for half the baking time and then uncover it for the last 10 minutes or so (or more, depending on your oven). This helps keep the moisture in while baking, but then makes the crust nice and crispy too. I marinate the tenderloin in a marinade of olive oil, garlic, black pepper and a splash of wine. Then when I'm ready to start cooking it, go by the recipe and coat it in Italian bread crumbs. It comes out fantastic. You won't be disappointed! We are not pork-eaters normally, but this meal is just to die for!

We will make this again.  My whole family loved it, even the kids asked for seconds- Amazing. I put salt, pepper, and garlic powder on the tenderloin.  Then put the bredding on.  Althought there is a lot of breading I would use it all.  I cooked it the full 35 minutes, without peeking, because I was busy preparing the rest of the meal, and when I took it out The top parts of the breading was DARK DARK brown almost black.  There was so much breading I took my knife and wiped away the dark color.  I put it on a serving platter and it looked elegant. Will serve again.

Fantastic recipe! VERY VERY simple! I didn't use as much oil as suggested and instead of bread crumbs I used herb flavored stuffing crushed in my blender. Little changes but the idea was what I went with and it was great!!

Best pork loin/tenderloin I've ever made!  I used of those flavored pork loins, and made a paste of the bread crumbs and olive oil, and spread it thinly over the entire piece.  I baked it at 350 for about 45 minutes, and then increased the temp to 400 to brown up the bread crumb coating.  Yummy!

Wow, this was great!  I did make a few changes to the recipe.  I rubbed the meat with sage, thyme, and black pepper and let rest for 30 minutes.  I did not have enough seasoned bread crumbs, so I crushed cheddar cheese crackers to combine with the crumbs and oil.  While the meat cooked I heated red currant jelly and spicy brown mustard in a small sauce pan on the stove.  After slicing the meat (my bread crumbs did not appear to be burned) I poured the sauce over the meat - it was delicious!  My husband and I ate half the tenderloin by ourselves.  This is a keeper, thanks for the post.

I took the advice of others regarding the blandness and just sprinkled the pork with pepper and garlic salt and lightly breaded it with the mixture.  It was unbelievable.  I am not a fan of pork, but now, I can't wait until lunch tomorrow for leftovers!!!

Very tender. FYI 425 degrees for 35 minutes would result in extemely rare piece of pork on a 2 lb tenderloin.  I roasted my 1.25 lb tenderloin for 45 minutes before it was only slightly pink/done. Covered with foil 1/2 way through to prevent over browning.

This was too easy!!! Got rave reviews from my family.  I used less of the breadcrumbs and it was still excellent. My breadcrumbs were very flavorful.  I imagine it would not be as good if you do not use very high quality breadcrumbs with lots of herbs. I also did not have the burning problem that some had but I did have to cook it 55 minutes instead of the 35.

Instead of making a paste out of the bread crumbs and oil, I rubbed oil on the tenderloin, sprinkled on my seasonings (salt, pepper, garlic powder), then sprinkled on the breadcrumbs.  The breadcrumbs that fell off burned right away to make a mess in the pan, but it was a lot easier, and the tenderloin came out perfect.

LOVE.  I made this recipe and also made the sauce from the "Pork Tenderloin with Dijon Marsala sauce" and this tasted like a meal I'd pay top dollar for in a restaurant.  I did rub the tenderloin with olive oil and then coat it with the bread crumbs.  I also browned it in a little bit of butter.  I will use this recipe again and again.

This was wonderful. I did it exactly as the recipe said. That I did do is I had some dip left which was  made from a cheese and salsa. I added some light sour cream and warmed it up. It was wonderful to dip the pork into. My husband ate it just as it was. So easy

OMG!! This was fantastic. Took advice from others and marinated in olive oil, dijon mustard, garlic powder, and onion powder for about an hour. Baked at 425 foil covered for 40 minutes then 20 minutes uncovered.

This was an excellent recipe. I had liberally coated the pork with the bread crumbs and this got very dark during the cooking process. When I sliced the meat, however, the dark breading fell away and left a beautiful golden crust. This was moist and flavorful.

This was wonderful.  I did add extra Italian seasoning to the bread crumbs along with some garlic powder.  Seasoned the pork with salt and pepper before applying crumb mixture.  I had 2 pork tenderloin halves.  One I added the crumbs as described the other I rubbed with oil and rolled in the crumbs.  Both were excellent and I didn't notice a big difference in the end result.  I did bake in a foil tent and let it rest for 15 minutes before serving.

This was great. I followed Chrisnoland suggestions and it nturned out fabulous. I never cooked pork tenderloin before and was a little skeptical about the cooking time but it was right on the money. If you try this recipe you won't be sorry.

This turned out fantastic with some changes!  Based on other reviews, I seasoned the pork with garlic powder, onion powder, seasoning salt, pepper and italian seasoning.  Then I put the olive oil on the pork and put the breadcrumbs and pork in a bag and shook to lightly coat.  The end result was so delicious and tender, thanks so much for the recipe!

I've made this Several times and each time it gets better and better !!!  TOnight I used 1-lb center-cut roast.  I start with plain crumbs and add garlic powder, oregano and fresh ground pepper (to taste).  Mix in a little ExtraVirgin Olive oil (about 1-2 TBS). Then pat mixture on meat.  Place meat in glass Pyrex and cook about 40 minutes on 350.  The crumbs get toasted, but NOT dry and crumbly.  The meat is ALWAYS Super tender and juicy.  I love this Recipe!!!

We thought it was very good! I didn't use nearly the amount of breading the recipe called for and ended up throwing out a bunch of the breading. I don't know if that is common or not though.

I made this for dinner last night and everyone who tried it loved it!! The only changes I made were, I liberally sprinkled the tenderloin with freshly grated pepper and garlic before covering with the crumb mixture. The meat was great!! I have not had a really good recipe before for tenderloin so this is definitely a "keeper"! I agree that it would be great for a dinner party because of it's presentation. thank you!

Very good.  My modifications:  I sprayed the pork with olive oil (using my Misto) then seasoned with onion powder, garlic salt, fresh ground pepper, and dried rosemary.  I coated it with Panko crumbs, put it on a foil lined cookie sheet, and baked at 425 until my meat thermometer read 155.  Moist, tender, flavorful!

This was one of the best Pork Tenderloins that I ever made. Rubbed the tenderloin with a Dijon mustard olive oil combination 1st then gave it a generous moist bread crumb covering. Everyone could not stop talking about how good it was.

Excellent!  This was a last minute "I have a tenderloin and have no idea what to do with it" kind of thing.  I had all the ingredients, so I went with it.  Delicious!  I put the tenderloin in a ziplock bag with olive oil, seasoning salt and Italian seasoning while the oven heated.  Rolled it in the bread crumbs to with I added a little parmesan cheese.  Cooked it as directed, though added a tent as per others directions.  Let it sit for 10 minutes and voila! Success!

Best key to any juicy pork tenderloin is a GOOD meat theomometer- bake to 145 MAX then rest under tented foil & you can't go wrong. This was tasty!

The new 2011 USDA guidelines recommend cooking pork to 145 deg. F., the way good cooks have been doing for some time.  A hint of pink.  150 if you're squeamish.  165 is well done and overdone by 20 degrees!

This was very good, but I made one small change--I used crushed cornflakes instead of bread crumbs, and I made another with stuffing and they both turned out very good!

Very moist and tender.  I seasoned with Salt, pepper and italian seasonings. The reason I gave it 4 stars (I wish there were 4 1/2) was when I cut the meat the "crust" fell off.  It was sticky enough to stick to it to bake.  I will make it again and and maybe add more oil.  Thank you for a twist to pork tenderloin!

This was easy and very good!  I drizzled a little olive oil on the tenderloin and then made the bread crumb mixture with plain bread crumbs (it was all I had) and seasoned the bread crumbs with garlic, salt and pepper, then rubbed it on the tenderloin.  Will def. make again!
Thanks..

I'll definitely make this recipe again- it was easy and there was no leftovers!  I put olive oil in a ziptop bag along with some mustard and garlic and marinated the pork for just a little while. Then I coated the pork with seasoned bread crumbs.  I did spray the coated pork with cooking spray a few times while it was cooking to help the breading form a nice crust.  The pork came out perfect and not dry at all.

This was wonderful!! After I put olive oil on, I sprinkled with Lawrey's garlic salt (which has a little parsley) and pepper.  I mixed some shredded parmesean cheese in my bread crumbs then rolled the pork loin. This was so tender and juicy. I will make this again!!

I loved this recipe and so did the family.  The only thing I found was that the excess breading started to burn after about 15 minutes.  Solved that problem by lowering the temperature a bit and very loosely covering it with a piece of foil. 
Made this recipe twice in one month.

This was a quick easy meal. I put the pork in the oven and then put unpeeled potatoes on the bottom rack of the oven. It was all ready at the same time and took 5 minutes to prepare.

My favorite pork tenderloin recipe.  I believe that you must use high quality breadcrumbs for this however.  I also like to add parmesan cheese and garlic powder to the breadcrumbs.

I also took advise of others and seasoned the loins about 30 min. before adding the breadcrumbs and cooking.  I added granulated garlic, ground pepper, salt and celery salt.   I also added Fine Herbs to the breadcrumb mixture.  No complaints here!  Quick and easy!

Good, easy and very pretty.  I put a little garlic powder and pepper on  the meat before coating it, but it was still fairly bland so next time I'll add some additional spices.  I will make it again  because it's easy, attractive and fast  and basic enough that just about anyone would eat it, making it a good choice as one of two or more entrees at a dinner party.  I made 1/2 of 1 tenderloin for 2 people and it looked like a "special" meal, served with baked sweet potatoes and collards I cooked in the pressure cooker (7 minutes makes them perfect) with sea salt and olive oil.  I gave it 4 stars for looks and ease of preparation, but couldn't do 5 (my husband loves meat much more than I do and he was very impressed with it)

I did not care for this recipe - bland and too much breading. Pork tenderloin is a bland meat unless seasoned properly.  Typically, I marinated the tenderloin prior to roasting and add a glaze need the end of the cooking.

After reading the reviews I added extra spices, tented with foil, changed the cooking time to an hour and 15 (it was on the larger side) and it turned out moist and browned, and tasted alright.  You must tent for the first half hour at least otherwise the breading will be sure to burn.  I was very pleased with the moisture which is why i'm giving 2 stars.

That being said...the breading did not stick.  I mixed exactly as said and packed it on.  As soon as you go to turn over it all falls off.  I even tried added a couple of eggs to make it stick.  No help.  I had a larger loin and even then the breading was very thick.  You could do better to use less crumbs, throw them in a bag and give the loin a light coating.

I won't make again. And it was a learning curve for me to sort the reviews differently.

I will give this recipe 2 stars, only because it actually was very moist.  However, it took much longer to cook then the recipe dictates.  Also, the flavor of the crumb mixture was less than appealing.  It burned, and fell off and that was fine, because it didn't taste good.  I had to put an aluminum foil tent over the roast to finally get it to the right internal temp.  I will try this method again, but certainly with different breading.

Ugh!  The pork was very tender and moist -but flavorless.  I added herbs and cheese to the breadcrumbs so they had flavor, but the meat did not absorb any of this.  Tenderloin would be better with sauce and grilled or seasoned well and cooked in pastry.

Good basic recipe but I had to add extra seasonings as well. Also found that the wonderfully 1/4" thick crumb coating slid right off the meat like wet sand when we tried to slice it. Next time I will try adding something to the crumb mixture to help it hold together better for slicing....maybe an egg white?  Also, took out of oven at just 155 degrees and let set for 10 minutres before slicing....Perfection!

It came out very good. I just added some garlic salt, oregano and basil to the crumb mixture and it turned out great. The pork was tender. I will make it again.

Absolutely delicious.  I made  little cuts into the tenderloin here and there, inserted slivers of garlic seasoned with salt & pepper. Then continued on as the recipe directs.  Love how the coating keeps the meat juicy and so tender.  The next day, I warmed leftovers with a little barbecue sauce and served it on a roll.  Yum!

I followed tips from several others. I rubbed olive oil and dijon mustard over the tenderloins. Sprinkled on garlic powder, salt and pepper, parmesan cheese & onion flakes and then rolled in Italian Bread Crumbs until well coated. Baked at 425 for about 45 minutes. I tented it with tinfoil so it didn't burn, but uncovered during the last few minutes to brown the crust. I removed the meat from oven when it reached about 160-165 degrees (measured in center of thickest part of roast). The internal temp will rise a few degrees during the standing process anyway (about 10 min), and you'll end up with safely cooked, yet juicy tenderloins.

Super yummy-super easy.  I didn't even have to beg my 5 yr old to eat it, which believe me, is a feat unto itself.  I did what some of the others suggested, and spinkled with pepper, garlic powder and onion powder before the breadcrumbs, then put foil over it about half way thru.  It took my 1.25 lb tenderloin about 50 minutes to reach the right temp.   I will definitely make this again.

The pork was very moist with good flavoring.  I had a little trouble slicing it without the breading breaking off.  I had a 1.5 lb tenderloin and it did take between 45 - 50 minutes to reach the 165 degree.  The end result tasted very good and I will be trying this again.

I made a few modifications.  I rubbed the tenderloin with olive oil, then rolled it in breadcrumbs that I seasoned with basil, oregano, garlic powder, salt and pepper.  Baked it as directed, and lined the pan with foil for an easy clean-up.  Very tender and tasty!

Very tasty yet very simple pork dish!  It's a great recipe to make if you're a bit tired and you don't want to prepare something too complicated.  May I suggest the inclusion of 2 tablespoons of cumin or thyme (for 6 servings) to add a bit more flavor but the recipe is fine as is!

I made this recipe for guests and then again the next day for my family.  A few changes.  I rubbed the tenderloin with olive oil, rubbed in salt, pepper and Italian seasonings and rolled it in the Italian seasoned bread crumbs.  Cooked as directed to 160 degrees and let sit 10 minutes.  Came out wonderful.  It was properly cooked and still moist and tender.  I will add this recipe to my collection.  I also liked it because it was so easy and not time consuming.

I've made this twice and had a hard time getting the breading to stick to the pork, but it did keep the tenderloin very juicy and moist. Second time around I sprinkled a little garlic and onion powder on the pork and added a little parmesan cheese to the breading.

While the end result was quite tasty I will note, DON'T cut your tenderloin to see if the center is still pink.  It lets all of the juices out making the pork dry out.  I didn't realize this and did cut one of my tenderloins...it came out extremly dry, while the uncut one moist and delicious!!!

This one is just as easy and yummy as everyone says. I have no idea how they get the crumbs so thick, but thinner works great - just don't add extra to cover any bare spots or you'll have little dry spots. Be sure to tent the meat (maybe even cover it part of the time) to keep it from getting a bit dry. Serving gravy with it is really good!

Instead of mixing the olive oil with the bread crumbs.  I mixed a little Cayenne Pepper, Garlic, Onion Salt, Rosemary and Oregano with the bread crumbs.  I dipped the pork tenderloin in the olive oil and smothered the pork and then I dipped it in the bread crumbs.  I repeated this process.  I baked it in a roasting pan and it was so good.  I, of course, didn't make enough of this dish to please my family.  However, I'll definitely make this dish again!

Truly a wonderful entree.  I coated it with grain mustard, and used Panko breadcrumbs instead of Italian as suggested by some other reviewers.  I cut the temperature back to 400 instead of 425 as I was afraid the bread crumbs would burn but would cook at 425 the next time.  Could have been a bit browner.  Will definitely make over and over!

Just made this tonight and received rave reviews from my family. I followed several suggestions from earlier reviewers. To ease clean-up and avoid possible burning of the breadcrumbs, I lined a speckled roaster with foil, then draped a sheet of foil over the top. I liberally coated my 3 tenderloins with garlic salt, pepper and Emeril's Italian seasoning. I used fine Italian breadcrumbs, patting them on the pork after rubbing olive oil on them. I baked for 40 minutes at 425, and they were juicy, full of flavor without a hint of scorched crumbs. They had the  flavor of a turkey and dressing dinner,  with much, much less trouble!

This was my first time cooking pork tenderloin, and it was a success!  

I read the other reviews and followed some of the suggesions.  I rubbed the tenderloin with a little bit of olive oil.  Then I sprinkled both sides with garlic powder, onion powder, italian seasoning, black pepper and Mrs. Dash.  I put some seasoned breadcrumbs in a bag and put the tenderloin in the bag.  I shook until the tenderloin was coated.  It was nowhere near as thick a coating as in the original recipe.

I baked for 35 minutes and had no problems with burning breadcrumbs.  Delish!!

This was awesome!  Very moist and juicy!  I had to use a small pork loin instead of a tenderloin and it still came out wonderful. Just had to cook it longer. The breading keeps the juices inside and it was wonderful.  The whole family loved it.  I did have a problem with the breading burning, so I turned the temperature down and scraped off the very top and moistened the bread crumbs with butter spray.  Still turned out great.  I think I will use less bread crumbs and more oil so the breading stays moist. I also used the ziploc bag to get the breading on there.  Thank you for the recipe Susan!

Excellent recipe! I have been looking for a non-apple pork tenderloin recipe and this was perfect. I rubbed the tenderloin with oil and garlic and sprinkled with salt, then shook it in a bag full of the italian bread crumbs. Delicious, thanks very much!

Wonderful and easy way to cook pork tenderloin.  I've made this a few times already and it always comes out moist.  I would recommend shaking the tenderloin in a bag with the breadcrumbs rather than trying to pat the breadcrumb mixture onto the tenderloin.  I also sprinkled the tenderloin with cayenne pepper before coating with the breadcrumbs to give a little kick!

Outstanding! The only thing I did differently was to add a little garlic powder and onion powder to the breadcrumbs. Husband loved it! Thanks so much, Susan!

The pork needed more flavor, but the crust was delicious, and the meat nice and tender.  Maybe I will marinate next time to get more flavor in the meat.

This was only my second pork tendeloin ever.  It was very yummy and juicy, but I only had regular bread crumbs, so I added some italian seasoning.  My only complaint is that it needed just a little more flavor (we are garlic people)so next time I think I will add some fresh chopped garlic to the mixture.  I made it in my toaster oven/broiler and shut it off after 25 minutes.  It kept cooking and was perfectly done and juicy because of the bread crumbs.

This was so easy and yummy.  Even my daughter who doesn't do pork loved it!

Only changes were:  I sprinkled both sides of the pork with garlic powder and pepper after rubbing it with the EVOO.   

yum

Simply the best. Tip: rise the pork on a cooking grill in the pan and add some water with a ton of garlic.

Following other reviews, I seasoned the pork with salt, pepper, ground mustard, and onion powder.  To give it some extra kick, I slit the pork in half lengthwise and stuffed it with 1 finely chopped mushroom, 2 cloves thinly-sliced garlic and 1 green onion (white and green ends).  I secured the pork and then packed the breading on as directed.  Warning:  The breading becomes deeply browned before the meat is finished cooking.  Definitely use a meat thermometer to test for doneness.

I don't know what I did wrong.  The breadcrumb topping was gross.  We ended up taking it off. I was very disappointed. I don't know what the rave is.  I even added garlic powder, salt, pepper and onion powder for seasoning.  I will not make this again.

Success!!  I saw this recipe and since I'd just bought a pork tenderloin this very morning, I decided I would make this tonight for dinner. As I began to assemble the ingredients, I realized that I was out of breadcrumbs, Italian or any other kind. However, I did have some Stovetop stuffing mix and I thought "hey, it's bread crumbs, sort of" so I made the stuffing in a bowl using the amount of butter called for on the box but used only half a cup or so of hot water. I mixed it up until it just held together when pressed into the meat which I'd oiled & seasoned with salt & a pinch or two of Herbs de Provence. Then I packed the stuffing mix on and popped it in the oven as the recipe called for.  35 minutes later, we were eating dinner. I served it with asparagus sautéed in garlic butter & mashed potatoes. My daughter, who maintains that she doesn't like pork, loved it & ate more meat at this one meal than I've seen her eat at any meal in the past 3 or 4 years.   We will be having this again and I might even try using the breadcrumbs next time.  The stuffing was pretty amazing though. This entrée was a hit!

This is our new favorite way to eat pork tenderloin! Served it at a dinner party and was met with rave reviews. I prepared in advance and put in fridge. Pulled out half hour before baking and stuck in oven. Needed closer to 45 minutes to cook through to perfection.

Made this last night - after reading so many reviews I put the breadcrumbs in a baggie and pressed them into the tenderloin.  It was very tasty but it never "crusted" up...  Can anyone help me?  Did I need more olive oil?  All the tips on seasoning were great!

This was so delicious! I made it with whole wheat bread crumbs, garlic and onion powder and italian seasoning.  I sprinkled parm cheese on it before putting in the oven. I cooked a 2 lb loin for 30 minutes and then tented it for 10 minutes to let it rest. It was by far the best, best pork I have ever had!

The other reviews got it down. It's a great starter recipe, but needs a little "oomph" thrown in. Season it however you like, but definitely add some herbs and spices, or a marinade of some sort.

Simple, but laking much flavor (other than breading taste).  More of a giant pork nugget.

I loved this!  I did use ritz crackers (off brand) because I couldn't find the Italian Seasoned  bread crumbs, so I put Italian Seasoning in the cracker mixture as well as meat tenderizing seasoning and onion powder and garlic powder and it turned out really good!  The only thing is it took more than 35 minutes to cook, but then I'm still having trouble interpreting my oven dial. :-)

Wonderful dish. This melted in our mouths it was soo good. I used a cast iron frying pan to bake this in and used tinfoil over the top to lock in the moisture. I also added carrot spears half-way through and they came out sweet and tender. Like others, I put olive oil in a dish and added seasonings such as mustard seed, cumin and Italian seasoning mix. Then I rolled the tenderloin in that and then coated it with Italian bread crumbs. YUM! Will definitely make this more often.

The pork was tender and moist and that's the only good comment I can make.  I followed the recipe EXACTLY and it was a bitter disappointment.  The bread crumbs fell off everywhere, the Italian seasonings were WAY too salty, and they were dry and burnt.  After scraping off all the breadcrumbs, we were left with meat that was ok, but would have been better with ANY OTHER treatment.  I read many of the other reviews and was mystified.  Did you all make the same recipe I did?  My instincts told me that eggs & milk would be more useful than olive oil.  Wish I'd heeded them.  No one took a second helping.  I'm going to try to figure out what to do with a pan full of overly seasoned, dried out breadcrumbs overwhelming some valiantly moist pork.

This made my Fiancée actually go 'muuummm' for the first time to something I have cooked.. I used multiple comments about preparation - rubbed olive oil on the loin then grey pupon - then bredded it with panko bread crumbs - then seared it in the stove before putting it in the oven. This recipe is so yummy!

For extra flavor, I also rubbed the tenderloin with the oil and added garlic powder, parmesan cheese, and italian seasoning before using the breadcrumbs.  I didn't add the oil to breadcrumb mixture.  It turned out very flavorful...and smelled awesome!

Good recipe, easy to do.I punched it up a bit more by inserting a bit of garlic through knife slits and before I rolled it in the bread crumbs,I covered the meat with mustard spiced with horseradish.Tasted great!

This was good, but I would not have rated it outstanding.  It definitely needed more flavors. I followed the recipe, except I added a few shakes of garlic pepper to the bread crumbs. I think with a little imagination, this could have been upgraded from easy and elegant to 'over the top' delicious.  Pork tenderloin is almost always tasty, juicy and extremely tender.  I just wasn't that impressed with the bread crumbs and olive oil.

I don't know if I would use the word elegant, but the sliced meat does present nicely.  I followed the recipe as written, just added some garlic powder, salt and pepper to the meat before coating with the crumbs.  Very good!

Several people mentioned that you need to spice up the breadcrumbs. I didn't see that until AFTER the tenderloin was served, unfortunately. So it's really bland. I can't give this recipe 5 stars when it needs doctoring-up with additional herbs... also, in case you happen to have panko italian breadcrumbs around, in my experience the outer layer will burn before the pork is done - so I recommend no panko!

So easy and quick to prepare.  A definite make-again.  I followed the directions of the first reviewer since I didn't think there would be enough flavour just using bread crumbs and we loved the zing the Dijon mustard added.  Didn't have Panko on hand so I just used Italian seasoned bread crumbs instead.

Super Easy and Excellent!! I followed other's advise and shook the tenderloin in a bag with the oil and bread crumbs. I did need to press the bread crumbs into the meat once it was in the pan.

I don't understand why this didn't work for me.  I followed the recipe to the TEE, and this dish was just...not good.  The breading was extremely mushy and did not stick to the pork at all after cooking.  The pork itself was not very tender, and certainly not "juicy".  I baked at 425 to an internal temp of 165 as directed (which took approx. 28 min. in my oven).  I will not be making this again.  :-(

This was pretty good.  I was worried about the bread crumbs burning before the meat was cooked so I lowered the temp to 400.  I also seasoned it with garlic powder, onion powder salt and pepper.  I will be making this again!

This recipe is everything that the title states...though I agree with most of the previous reviewers that it's necessary to season up the pork pre bread crumbs.  I found I needed extra oil to make the bread crumbs stick better and roasted it uncovered at 350 for approximately an hour.

I drizzled with oil, sprinkled with lemon pepper seasoning then just sprinkled all sides with bread crumbs right in the pan.  Baked as per directions and finished with an apricot preserve/deli mustard/orange juice sauce from a different recipe on this site. I usually make extra at dinnertime because my family loves leftovers for lunch the next day,but alas, this was all gone in one sitting.  We loved it!!

This is now one of my son's favorite dishes.  I had some problems with the breading also.  I place the tenderloin on parchment when breading and use the parchment to "pack" the breading.  I cook it on a rack in the roasting pan. I have also prepared this the night before and refrigerated it, which seemed to really help keep the breading in place.  I have overcooked this at times, and it still tastes great.

This is yummy and very easy!  I did season the meat before rolling it into the oil and breadcrumbs -- and I used the foil tent method. I've made this before and I'll make it again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Good idea but needs some tweeking. My bread crumbs started burning before the center was completely done. I tried covering with foil but it was too far gone. Maybe on a diff temp it would do better?

If you are looking for something simply and not fancy but with a great taste this is it!  I rubbed the oil on the tenderloin first.  Then, I did add garlic powder, onion powder and some salt and pepper.  Then, I rolled it in the breadcrumbs.  I thought that was the simplest way to do things.  Easy and good!

As written, this was kind of bland.  Not all Italian seasoned bread crumbs are created equally though.  I think the concept is good - next time I will use regular bread crumbs and my own seasonings.  Oh, and I rubbed it with the olive oil then pressed into the bread crumbs.  I agree with the others who say to cook it to 160 - will be too dry otherwise.  Thanks for the great starting point.

I absolutely Love this recipe! It's so nice to find a recipe for tenderloin that doesn't have to be marinated for 8 hours! I changed just one tiny thing, only about 1/4 cup of olive oil mixed with dijon mustard, italian dressing and onion powder. I figured why add that much fat/calories when you can get the same taste with less? It turned out fantastic & cooked perfectly in exactly the time listed. Thanks again!!

Love this recipe!!  I added salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder prior to the bread crumb mix and this came out wonderful.  I will use this again and again!

This dish is just like its name - Easy & Elegant.  I read several reviews and marinated it overnight in a ziploc bag.  Marinade consisted of olive oil, sliced garlic, dry mustard, salt and pepper.  Put some rosemary in the panko crumbs and voila!  It's delicious and even my one year old couldn't seem to get enough.  Definitely goes into my "make again" recipe box.

This was a very tasty way to cook pork tenderloin.  I coated the pork with olive oil, salt, pepper, and garlic pepper in a ziplock bag.  Then I dumped in the bread crumbs and shook the bag until the pork was well-coated.  I placed on a foil-lined pan and baked as directed.  When it was done, there was a nice crust on the pork and I didn't have to clean a pan...I just threw out the foil.  Next time I'll add some grated parmesan to the bread crumbs.

My boyfriend is a chef and intiminating to cook for. This was my first time I was left to cook the pork tenderloin and this came out moist, tender, and delicious. I even used salt-free bread crumbs and it was still rather tasty.

Great recipe. Did add parmesan cheese to bread crumb mixture. Crumb mixture keeps tenderloin moist and tender. My family loved it. Definitely a keeper.

Outstanding. Incredibly easy. Great for company or just when in a hurry.  Most tenderloin recipes need marinating and planning ahead.  This one is perfect for when it is too late to marinade.  I sprinkled the tenderloin with salt,pepper,garlic powder and onion powder liberally before coating with the seasoned breadcrumbs.  There was none left for the fridge!

I prepared this recipe to take to friends who had a death in the family.  I doubled it and saved half for my own family.  The pork was delicious and tender.  The family who received it was very, very complimentary as well.  The only thing I did different from the original recipe was to coat the tenderloins with olive oil and fresh garlic, covered with clear wrap and refrigerated overnight.

This dish was perfect!  Moist and flavorful.  I didn't need all of the breading, though.  You could probably cut back to about half of that.

Very good and tastey. Kids ate every bite which is always good to see. I used italien bread crumbs.I had a 31/2 lb tenderloin which needed to cook longer. A keeper in my book.

Easy and tasty.  I think baking is one of the best method for pork.  Also, I would marinade it beforehand to add some more flavors and spice.

I made no changes, but I do think the cooking time was much too long.  Next time I will take out after 15 minutes and cover with aluminum foil for 10 minutes.

I made this roast twice so far and both times it came out juicey and had a nice  medium brown crust on it. I did wait 10minutes before I cut into it. Very easy and made a nice presentation.

I made this according to the recipe, except that I cooked it for about 45 minutes,  and it turned out pretty well, but a little dry.  Then I read the review which said it doesn't need to be cooked to 165 degrees.  Next time, I will take it out of the oven at 155 or 160 degrees.

First time I’ve ever been able to make pork loin without overcooking.  I would suggest covering with foil until last 10 minutes otherwise the coating burns.

I added rosemary, garlic powder, salt and pepper to Panko bread crumbs.  Rolled the pork tenderloin in it and seared in a pan with melted butter before putting it in the oven.   My family loved it.  Seems like a good recipe for when you have people over- not much can go wrong!

This simple and delicous dish has become a regular in my household.  My daughter's favorite and the rest of the family lovesa it too.  We have it at least 2-3 times a month. That good and that easy!
I do season my pork just a bit before applying the breadcrumbs and oil.

Like others, I seasoned the pork with garlic powder, salt, and pepper before applying the crumb mixture. I also tented it with foil while baking and while it still burned, it was probably not near as bad as it would have been without the foil. I checked the temp after 35 minutes of baking at 425 degrees, and it was done. Overall, I thought the flavor was decent even if half the breadcrumbs did fall off. I had never made a pork tenderloin before and was apprehensive, but this was simple to prepare. I would probably make this again.

This was terrific!  Made 1/2 recipe (1 pork tenderloin) for two people.  Used 1 cup panko mixed with 2 tsp dried Italian seasoning plus 1/4 tsp kosher salt, mixed with 1/4 cup olive oil.  Made as per the original instructions except baked in a glass baking dish.  The crumbs did not stick really well but who cares? 40 minutes plus 10 minutes rest was perfect.  I will be making this often, we loved it!

This has been a weeknight staple for years.  I don't use as much of the bread crumbs and olive oil as called for in the recipe.  I also serve it with the sauce from the Herb Roasted Pork recipe on this site because my husband likes a little sauce on his meat.  He finds this pork a little dry for his taste so this sauce solves the problem.

I made this exactly as instructed except I only had a single 1 pound tenderloin, so I halved the crumb mixture. The recipe makes a lovely presentation and the moisture and flavor are perfect. I served this entree with rosemary roasted potatoes which cooked while the roast cooked and I heated canned English peas seasoned with butter. It was a lovely and delicious meal that received raves from my family. It was easy to make and didn't make a huge mess.

Delicious as written, also I think this recipe would be good with added seasonings based on what your family likes. I'm thinking of adding Italian seasoning, then maybe some Parmesan or mozzarella on top a few minutes before its done.  
I think I will use this in many variations, thanks for this great recipe. The whole home grown pork loin was devoured ! Glad we have more loins in the freezer.

This came out perfect, nice and moist.  I would add a little seasoning before adding the bread crumbs the next time, but it was still very good.

Uh Yum! First time I have ever attempted a pork loin and this turned out perfect. I did everything as stated (did add a little S&P before coating with the oil and crumbs). Even the picky teenage daughter loved it. So easy and so good! Thanks for sharing!

I followed some of the other reviews with adding garlic & onion to the olive oil, salt & pepper.  I also added extra Italian seasoning to the bread crumbs and "double" breaded them with the egg wash and then sprayed with Pam Olive Oil spray. After 40 min it was done, I did have to let it rest in a foil tent for a little longer (+30 min) due to Honey working a little late. Actually I think it just made it even more moist.  It is the Second best Pork Tenderloin I've ever had!! Super Easy, Super delish!!

Simple and delicious - exactly what I look for in a recipe! I followed the advice of a few reviewers and rubbed spices (salt, garlic powder, pepper, onion powder, rosemary) all over each tenderloin after first rubbing with olive oil. The flavor was just right! After covering with a generous layer of Italian bread crumbs, I popped them in the oven for 40 minutes at 425, letting them rest for 10 minutes afterwards as suggested. The only change I would make next time would be to pan fry before oven roasting in order to get a crunchy crust.

You just have to give this 5 stars due to the ease & few ingredients. Used Progresso Italian Breadcrumbs. No extra seasoning needed. Two 1 lb tenderloins came in the pack. Very moist & tasty. Took me by surprise!

I just put this in the oven, but not without tweaking it.  I'm sure that it will be juicy with this technique
I could not get the bread crumb and oil mix to stick.  Wonder what others did that got them to stick. I added an egg to the crumbs and oil and finally got it to stay on.  I probably should have seasoned the meat before, but was having enough to cope with the crumbs.  My tenderloin was only 18oz not 2 lb. I used fresh bread crumbs, so maybe they don't stick as well.

Even with seasoning the meat, using panko,, tenting with foil and using a rack to keep all sides crispy, my family and I just didn't love this. It was juicy enough (I took it out at 150 degrees and it rose to about 162 after sitting), but it just didn't appeal to us. Probably won't make it again.

hubby loved it... rubbed it with some prepared Dijon first, the coated it with the bread crumb mixture.  Next time I won't try and turn it over. The bottom doesn't need to be coated. Also, I used a canola oil.  Olive oil is expensive, canola is cheaper and doesn't really have a taste, so it's all good.

We loved this!  Used a 1.5 lb tenderloin and marinated it in some olive oil, garlic, salt, pepper, and thyme for about 30 minutes.  I then rolled it in Garlic and Herb Bread Crumbs until completely coated.  Placed in a shallow roaster on non-stick foil and roasted at 400 for 20 minutes tented with foil and 10 more without.

Rubbed with olive oil, sprinkled with garlic and onion powder then the italian bread crumbs.  Since 2 tenderloins come in one package it took closer to an hour to cook, moist and delicious!

I made this recipe exactly as written, and it was both moist and delicious.  I used a 2-pk pork tenderloin purchased from Sam's Club, and only needed to trim off the tough "silver skin" and then follow the recipe.  Easy peasy, and my company, an accomplished cook, called it her new favorite pork dinner!

The first time I made this, I found it very hard to get the breadcrumbs to adhere to the pork. This time I took the advice of "DIANAMATT" and first oiled the pork (after salting and peppering it) then rolled it in the breadcrumbs. This worked better for me. And I used lemon flavored panko breadcrumbs by Progresso - this absoultely gave it a wonderful flavor! I think lemon is great with pork. I didn't give it five stars only because the crumbs still don't fully adhere this way, but it was definitely better.

Read the reviews and we marinated the pork beforehand in olive oil, garlic, and some herbs.  The recipe called for way too much bread crumbs.  I also tented the pork for 30 minutes as some of the reviews recommended.  My husband loved it, I liked it.  It just lacked something...

This was very tasty but I would cut the amount of bread crumbs down by half.  I used a 2 lb tenderloin as suggested but there was way too much bread crumb mixture.  I am not a huge fan of Italian flavored bread crumbs so I think next time I will make my own crumb/herb mixture.  The meat came out moist and tender...very nice

This was a huge hit with my family!  I read quite a few of the reviews and used some of the suggestions (tent the meat for the 1st half-add garlic powder, paprika and Italian spices) and then added a little of my own twist~lemon pepper~ and it came out perfectly.  You could cut it with a knife.
Made 2 tenderloins so there will be plenty of sandwiches tomorrow!

Just like everyone said..awesome! Easy, juicy and tasty. All four of my kids loved it. I made a brown gravy with butter, onions, ketchup, worcestershire sauce, gravy master and brown gravy mix to go with it. Delicous:) "Best dinner ever" said my 9 year old!

This turned out excellent however I didn't have italian seasoned breadcrumbs so used panko and italian seasoning instead.  Pork stayed nice and juicy.  Delicious!

I tried some other reviews suggestions & it didn't work as planned.  Searing the meat before putting it in the oven.  The breading came off during the searing process.  I must have made a mistake somewhere.   It was just ok for me.  I still give it 4 stars due to it was a suggestion that screwed me up &   not the followed specified recipe.  (the result I had would have been more like 3 stars)

this was easy and time saving. I enjoyed the simplicity of the meal, and it was inhaled by the whole family. I deduct one star because the meat was dry. I made a red wine sauce to go with the pork and served it with sauerkraut and baked potatoes to minimize clean up and energy used.

Love this recipe, it was a hit and there was no leftovers! LOL Adds a nice change from the boring same ole pork taste every time. Although, this is like the elegant homemade version of Shake N' Bake for pork.

Awesome! We had to cook it for 45 minutes, and we added a little of Tastefully Simples Onion Onion and Garlic Garlic to the top. It was so moist and so tasty, and I don't normally like pork.

This was absolutely delicious! I cooked it as listed, except I did add some Rosemary, garlic powder, and onion powder.  I did put the foil on the bottom of the pan for easy cleanup. And I also rubbed some olive oil on the roast first before putting the bread mixture on it. It was so good, it didn't need any gravy!  The only problem I had was that I had to cook it a little longer than the 35 min. required. My pork was just a little bit over 2 lbs. and I had to cook it about 50 min to an hour to get it done. Will definitely cook this one again!

This Recipe looks GREAT and makes for a beautiful main dish. The taste however was kind of disappointing and bland. I think I'll stick to the grill for pork tenderloin from now on.

This recipe is phenomenal! The pork is crispy on the outside and fork-tender moist AND juicy on the inside.  For a crispier type coating, make recipe the same way using your favorite salad CROUTONS (I love Caesar), put them in a ziplock bag and use a rolling pin or similar object to crush them (don't forget to squeeze the air out of the bag first!). The first time I made this I didn't have the fine bread crumbs so used the crushed croutons - it makes the coating much crispier. You can do this with boneless/skinless chicken breasts and chops in the oven too! You won't believe it until you've tried them all!

Awesome and super easy! This was my very first time cooking a pork tenderloin and I was concerned it would dry out. I defrosted a frozen loin in the microwave, poured the olive oil over the meat and also patted it down with garlic salt and black pepper. Then I threw the meat into a plastic bag filled with store brand Italian style breadcrumbs and did the "shake and bake" coating. Placed the meat on a foil-lined baking sheet and covered with a foil tent to prevent burning/drying out. After I let the meat rest (it cooked faster than I thought), my husband put the tenderloin back in the oven without the foil tent to brown the crust.   We served this with mashed potatoes, gravy made from white wine and a can of cream of mushroom soup and peas (I didn't have green beans, which would've been better IMHO). It was a hit, the kids ate it up!  Thank you for sharing a great recipe!

This was ok.  I added some extra flavor as other users suggested...onion/garlic powder and salt and pepper.  It may have been the type of bread crumbs I used but I didn't think it was a *wow* type of recipe.  One user stated they tented the meat after it cooked, so I tried that for about 15 minutes while it rested.  If you want the crust crispy - don't do this...it made it soggy.  I am going to try it again but will marinate the meat to get more flavor.

Holey Schnikes!! Not only was this easy to make, both in terms of ingredients needed and steps to take, but it turned out AMAZING and in such a short cooking time!!  This was the perfect dinner for my husband and I, and I will be adding this to our regular rotation!!    Like many of the other reviewers, I added some extra bits to the meat before I coated it in the olive oil/bread crumb mix: garlic sea salt and dried italian herbs.

This was the best recipe for pork tenderloin that I have ever made. Tender and juicy, my husband was very pleased with this dish. I may make this for our family get together Xmas dinner instead of the usual turkey it's that good. I also got great gravy from the drippings.

Fantastic! Juicy, flavorful and easy to make...who could ask for more?  I also seasoned the pork prior to breadcrumming and used a roasted garlic olive oil. I also put some olive oil in the baking pan, nothing skuck and my pan did not burn.  Pork can be dry, so I was pleased to taste how juicy this actually was. Make sure to cover with foil...helped trap the juices. Next time I will put in an oven bag to see if I can make it juicier!

Very good recipe. Easy to make and tasty. However, the amount of breadcrumbs/olive oil was too much - we had a lot left over. (it was the right ratio of breadcrumbs to olive oil tho). Also, it does not need to be 1/4" thick - the excess all fell off when carving. Will make it again!!!

This was awesome...it was tender and yummy!! I never make good tenderloin and my husband actually complimented me on this one!!  The only thing I added was some Parmesean Cheese to the mixture.  Just be sure you have enough cook time.  It was more like 1.5 hours to cook although I may have cooked at a lower temp too. Very easy. =)

This was really good, but my crumb breading kind of came out like stuffing and kept falling off. However, the recipe was still very good, I will make it again.  I did sear my pork loin beforehand and added more seasonings.

Yum, yum, yum.  Everyone loved this recipe, including my picky eater.  The picky eater did remove the breading though.  I had a bit of trouble with the breading sticking, my pork roast was probably too damp. It didn't reheat the best (in the micro), so I think I'd try to make a smaller roast next time or divide my roast in half before cooking.  It froze very well and the issue we'd had earlier with the breading in the microwave was forgotten.  (I had about a 3# roast and it made enough for 3 meals for my family of 4.)

I used a lot less breadcrumbs than called for, closer to 1/2 cup for two medium tenderloins. I should have used more spices as many other reviewers did, but I was in a hurry/lazy. However, the tenderloins turned out very nice and juicy. I will use this recipe again, adding some extra spices!

A simple and excellent way to make pork tenderloin! I followed the recipe except scaled the breading/olive oil in half as my tenderloin was smaller. I did add my own seasonings to the breading, and followed the advice to line the pan with foil. I also tented the pork with foil until the last 5 minutes - this will keep the breading from getting burned. The pork was incredibly moist, and did not need any sauce (even though I made a gravy). A nice versatile recipe I will make again - thanks!

Loved this recipe!  Like someone said before...it was nice to fix a tenderloin that didn't have to be marinated for hours!  I used the club crackers (with Italian dsg. seasoning) as one reviewer suggested....was very good but next time I want to try the Italian bread crumbs.

Okay, this was delicious! I never cook pork roasts because they come out dry and nasty, but this was so easy and delicious! I did season the roast a little bit before adding the bread crumbs. Thanks for posting this recipe. I will definitely be making it again.

This was a nice, moist pork recipe. I coated the pork with a bit of "hearty" mustard.  I also added garlic powder and seasoned salt to the bread crumbs as suggested.  Everyone loved it and gave it 4 stars!

I followed the lead of another reviewer and rubbed my tenderloin with grainy mustard, a sprinkle of garlic powder and rolled it in crumbs.  I added fresh rosemary and fresh parmesan.  Seared the loin and then popped it in the oven.

Absolutely wonderful !  My children love this recipe.  I also throw in rosemary and rub the tenderloin with a whole grain mustard before rolling in bread crumbs.  Can't go wrong with this.  If your oven is accurate than the 35 minutes is perfect !!

I'm not sure I should give this five stars, since I added spices to the panko bread crumbs I used according to some suggestions, but as a "foundation" recipe, it was great, and really allows for experimentation. Sometimes, I just need to know what temp. to cook it and for how long! This is that. Simple, moist and good!

This was so simple, but the roast turned out to be very moist and just prfect. One thing, I would cook it a bit longer not at a higher temp but just a tad longer that wat has been suggested.

definately a 4 star as listed, but a 5 star with a few little additions as suggested by others!  What a great idea for a quick dinner that everyone absolutely loved.  Thanks so much.  I also rubbed the meat with salt and dry mustard powder, basil and rosemary before adding the crusted breadcrumb mixture.  I am wondering what a little honey in the breadcrumb mixture would be like?  I think I might add a tsp of liquid honey on the next try.  A definate keeper to play so it can be made a few times in the month and not taste the same twice.

Nothing outstanding here.  Luckily we seasoned the pork before putting on the  breading to give it some flavor.  Most of the breading actually fell off the pork when it was sliced and served.  Won't make it again.

Very easy. The recipe made much more breading than I needed. Husband loved it, but I thought it was a little bland and pasty.

Really easy and super tasty!  I slathered mine in a zipper bag with olive oil, salt, lemon pepper, and garlic, then browned in a skilled before breading.  I'll probably be making this on a regular basis.  I can't wait to experiment with different herbs and seasonings in the breading mixture!

This was a quick and easy dinner.  However,  it made a huge mess, about 90% of the breading feel off of the pork.

Like some others, I seasoned mine before breading.  I used Herbes de Provence by Penzeys Spices.  Any spice you prefer with pork would work well with this recipe.  I tenteed mine halfway through to avoid over browning.  It came out tender, delicious and temporary!  The family ate it up and there are no leftovers.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

This is a keeper!  I followed previous reviews and seasoned the pork before breading it and then breaded it in a mixture of bread crumbs and parmesan cheese.  I also covered it with foil for 1/2 the cooking time.  It was fantastic!  Thanks!

Very delicious!  I had to use plain bread crumbs since that was all I had on hand, but added my own seasonings and it turned out great!  I noticed that the top was getting pretty dark about half way through cooking also, so I flipped the meat about 1/4 turn every 15 minutes and it browned evenly and turned out great!  Mmmmm.....

I tried this recipe and found that the crumb coating cooked too fast and burned before the meat was done, so I had to keep spooning out the burnt parts while cooking.  So, although it did not look pretty when it was finished, the meat itself was wonderfully moist and delicious.  I will not likey make this again.  Maybe it's my oven?!

This turned out moist and delish.  I did rub some seasonings, garlic powder, cracked black pepper and some rosemary into loin before rolling into bread crumbs. This is my personal preference when cooking.  I like seasonings.  Thanks for the post.

This was great.  I accidentally overbaked it, but the pork was still moist and tender.  Looks fancy enough for company, but is really quick and easy to prepare.

Excellent recipe.  I had been holding onto this one for awhile and finally decided to make it for supper tonight.  My only change was adding rosemary & Herbes de Provence spice to the Italian bread crumbs.  The taste was wonderful and very moist.  Thanks

This recipe really surprised me.  I'm not much of a person for breading, but this wasn't overwelming, just a nice amount of crunch that kept the meat nice & moist.  

I surprised someone with dinner with this & they were later than I expected.  This sat in the oven longer than it should have, but I turned down the heat slightly & it didn't overcook!

This is very tasty for such a quick and easy recipe. I rubbed garlic salt and pepper on the meat before the breading and it came out yummy. I did lower the temp to 400 and cooked it until meat therometer read 165 degrees. We'll be having this again. It's a keeper.

Had this dish on Friday evening and it was a hit with my husband and I. I as well added a seasoned rub before pressing cracker mixture.
Also, to prevent the darkening you all are experiencing, just lay a piece of foil on top of baking dish, no need to wrap it down. Mine was golden delicious!!

This recipe was easy, but not elegant. The crust turned into crumbs the second the knife touched it. It was also very bland.

I found this recipe to be easy, but without a lot of flavor.  I would have to dress it up a bit with spices and parmesian cheese, etc, to try this one again.  But, it was good to just even think about breading a pork tenderloin as a quick dinner solution.  Thanks.

Although this was super easy, I found it rather bland.  The crust was not crisp, as I would have liked it.  One good note, my 4 year old son ate it up!  He even had seconds (which is VERY rare when it come to meat)!

we just made a version of this, I started off w 2 small but nice tenderloins. I followed advice of other reviewers and dry rubbed w S&P, garlic & onion powder.  I also coated it w couple TBSP of dijon mustard let sit in ziploc bag in refrigerator @4hrs. i had to go to work so my daughter(24yrs old)coated w 2 parmesan crusted shake n bake packets, you can use bread crumbs & seasonings, she placed on rack 2inches apart in roasting pan covered with foil she baked @30 min @ 400°(preheated), removed foil, inserted a thermometer in thickest part of bigger loin, baked another 30 min. she said it registered 150°. she let them rest 15min & sliced. she served dinner to her dad when he walked in door. served with sauteed cabbage, noodles & onions (halushki) that we made earlier & buttered green beans. I ate when I came home from work...she said she was worried that roast might not be done in middle or would be dry after.. I reheated in microwave....wow it was so moist & tender...my husband said he really enjoyed the pork it was moist,tender & he liked seasoning but he wished it was served w mashed potatoes lol hes not fan of cabbage lolol.

this is good recipe to start with but I always read reviews and think hmm does this review sound good, take the recipe to next level, will my family eat this...enjoy & TY!

Made this for dinner tonight.  I used panko crumbs, as that is what I always have in the house.  Added S&P, garlic powder and thyme.  It came out surprisingly moist.  Sliced thin and served with mashed potatoes and green beans.  Super easy and quick.  This is a great base recipe that has a lot of potential for alterations, and still be great.  Thanks for sharing.

The only thing I did that wasn't in the recipe is something I'm doing to all my pork these days. Started with pork chops because I like juicy, tender chops and it worked so well, I did it on ribs. And now on the pork tenderloin.  I brine. Dissolve a couple of tablespoons of salt in a cup of boiling water. Add ice to cool it off and enough water to cover the pork in a plastic bag or container. Add spices. For this one I added Italian spices and a bit of lemon juice. I vary the time I leave things to brine depending upon my schedule. And I dry the pork when I remove it from the brine. So for this recipe, this was the only thing I did that the recipe didn't call for. It was very tasty and definitely worthy for entertaining purposes.

The crumb coating did not stick evenly using the sealed plastic bag method recommended in the recipe. I tried to even it out with my fingers but it was difficult and is still uneven. If I make this again, I will try drizzling with oil and then sprinkling the crumb mixture over.

I used plain bread crumbs with a packet of Italian salad dressing mix and I coated the tenderloin first with mustard before the bread crumb mixture.  We loved it!

I made it for a small dinner and the guests thought it was pretty good, " but not great"  I finely chopped 2 large red apples and mixed with the bread crumbs to add a different flavor.  I thought it tasted pretty good and something different for my typical port tenderloin

Made as directed with some seasoned bread crumbs from bruschetta crackers.  I picked this recipe because I didn’t have time to marinate.  This was my first pork loin but not my last!  Easy, economical, and tasty!

It's surprising good and very easy to make!  Serve  it with mashed potatoes, green beans and pepper jelly (Trader Joe's).  If you have left overs, it's really good in a sandwich with mustard.

Followed other's suggestions.  Rubbed the tenderloin with a combination of grainy mustard, Dijon mustard, garlic and onion powder.  Used Panko bread crumbs that had Rosemary, fresh pepper, and a little Kosher salt added to it.  Browned the tenderloin in a little butter and grape seed oil and then placed it in a 425F oven until the internal temperature was at 142F.  By the time the meat had rested the loins were done to medium.  The meat was so juicy and tender, everyone had seconds.  This is definitely a keeper.  Thank you to everyone for the suggestions.

My husband loved this, but I  accidentally cooked it a bit too long....however it didn't get dry like I thought it would, it was still moist enough.  I have a fear of under-cooked pork, and in fact usually don't eat pork.  Did this for my hubby, so if he's happy, I'm happy.

In olive oil , browned red onion and minced garlic, add lemon juice and water to get a small amount of drippings and flavor, this goes in bread crumb mixture. Add rosemary and other herbs and seasoning for flavor boost. Remove from skillet.

Before browning tenderloin in oil, seasoning it with garlic powder, onion powder and thyme. 
Place in foiled pan, put bread crumb mixture on top of meat. Add a foil lightly on top , bake, remove foil to brown top. 
Yum

It's a good main course.  I do not recommend leaving it in the oven until you get an internal temp of 165, that's way too done.  I remove from the oven when it hits 145 and the temp continues to rise as it rests to ~165.

Really enjoyed this recipe. I did not tent or cover the tenderloin as others wrote and had no problem with breadcrumbs browning too fast. However I did find the crusting separated easily from the meat when I was cutting it.....had a good knife so will definitely try it again.

Followed the recipe. Won’t make it again.
Too much breading that didn’t stay on tenderloin.  Was blah as well.

I gave this a 3 or 3.5.  The positive thing about this recipe was the pork was tender and moist.  So, for that I give it the three stars.  My main issue is the breading.  I could not get it to stick.  Most of it fell to the bottom of the pan and burned.  I tented the pork with foil so that prevented burning on the actual cut but I had plenty of burned bread crumbs in the pan.  Once out of the oven they weren't really that moist and continued to fall onto the plate.  They just didn't add much to the flavor or presentation.  I think the next time I make this (I will try again) I am going to do an egg wash similar to fried chicken and season the heck out of the pork/crumbs.
I also found that the cooking time was way off.  I used a larger cut so I expected an increase but it was a good 30-40 minutes more on top of that.  I just went by what my thermometer was telling me.

The pork loin was nice and gender but the coating, which I had to use more oil than it calls for, just crumbled off when we cut the meat to serve it.  Other than that, it wasn't bad.

This was good, but I added extra seasoning to the breading, basil, rosemary, thyme, onion powder & garlic powder . I did cut down on the breading mixture by a 1/3 & I added more oil. Other than that I followed the recipe.  It was delicious.

As others recommended, used garlic powder, pepper and salt before rolling in the breadcrumbs.   I rolled them in panko with parmesan cheese, italian seasoning, parsley and thyme.  Then added italian seasoned breadcrumbs to the mixture and rolled the tenderloins again, patting them down with the breadcrumb mixture. Deeeeeeeeelicious.  And the family agreed.

This turned out amazing!  I had a 3 lb pork tenderloin so I cut it in half.  Baked at 425 for25 minutes, checked it, then another 7 minutes. My only regret is I had a lot of extra bread crumbs laying on the sheet pan and they burned and got quite smoky.  But the pork was juicy and flavorful!  Will definitely make it again!

It was very good, however I was hoping for a moister meat. I followed the recommendations about covering it 
, cooking to 145 degrees and then allowing it to cook outside of the oven... but it was still not as moist and juicy as I had hoped. That said, the seasoning and crust were very tasty.

This turned out great.  After coating the tenderloin with olive oil, I sprinkled Himalayan salt and pepper on the tenderloin as suggested by other reviewers.  I used panko bread crumbs mixed with a little bit of rosemary and baked it longer than the instructions to 40 minutes and let it set for a bit after taking it out of the oven.    Very simple!

Absolutely delicious. Made it again tonite. Had it last week for the first time.  I make my own Italian breadcrumbs and freeze for pork chops, chicken, steak, etc. So I used those. And try to have a pork sandwich the next day on italian bread.  Wow! This is a keeper. Thanks again. And very easy!!!

This recipe's a keeper.  I didn't have any breadcrumbs, so threw some plain old salted crackers in the food processor along with the oil & seasoning.  Delicious.  Only small downside is that the lovely looking coating fell apart when I sliced the meat.  Maybe it was the crackers.  No matter.....  it still was delicious.

The crumbs were very flavorful! It sounded good, but 15 minutes after being in the oven, my crumbs were burnt. I scraped and covered the pork. The tenderloin was not tender after the cooking time indicated. I wrapped it in foil and put a pan of hot water under it on a 275-300 degree oven for 2 hours. It was tender, but I prefer to sear, wrap pork in foil cook pork at a low temp in its juices and the outcome is fork tender. As I was having company, I made mine.

I made this dish around 5:30 today with many child friendly interruptions!! To make it fun for kids, have them prepare from beginning! I would recommend having all ingredients on hand prior to preparation. During the lesson, if you feel you are losing some student, possibly pull them aside and simply ask if this is wear you want too be!! The best cooking class involves an extremely dedicated teacher as well as children that are truly interested in Learning!!

Made for Sunday supper. Was easy and good. Baked uncovered at 350 for approximately 40 minutes.  Rubbed with olive oil and Dijon mustard then rolled in spiced up breadcrumbs.  Think Otto would prefer a gravy with it.

I tweeked this recipe based on other reviews.  I coated the tenderloin with olive oil, sprinkled with garlic powder, basil and crushed rosemary.  Last, I applied Italian bread crumbs and panko.  Roasted at 400 degrees for 45 minutes.  It was delish!

Maybe I should have read the reviews first...because I found that the crumbs didn't stick very well, they burned before end of cooking time and the pork wasn't really very tender.  Not horrible but not something I will make again as written.

I seasoned with salt, pepper & garlic powder.  coated with olive oil, then rolled it into the bread crumbs and added a little bit of crushed rosemary.  I don't know if it was the olive oil or the breading, but this is the most tender & juicy pork loin I have every cooked!  Try it....you won't be sorry!

I read the comments and followed what some other people suggested. I stuck to the recipe except that I added Italian seasoning and salt and pepper to the pork before the bread crumb mixture. Then I seared the pork on the stovetop with butter before roasting in the oven. Super delicious and crispy. Very moist and flavorful. A great fall/winter type dinner.

First time ever roasting a tenderloin.  Couldn't find Italian flavored bread crumbs.  So added a packet of Italian salad dressing powder to 2 cups of regular bread crumbs and the oil.  It came out very moist and tasty.  May try again, but think I prefer slow cooker thick boneless pork chops a bit better.

This was easy to make and it tasted so good.  It was really  tender and delicious.  I had to cover it after 15 minutes to keep if from turning too brown.

This is one of those recipes that gets a 5 for ease and short prep time.   The flavor is very good (as long as you don't overcook I cooked til 150 degrees). I used panko, good olive oil, and Italian seasoning after salting and peppering the meat. Can't get any easier or faster.  Good reason to keep frozen tenderloins on hand for for quick after work meal prep.

This was super moist and tender.  I seasoned crispy panko crumbs with my favorite spices and tented the pork with foil until the last 10 minutes as recommended in another review.

I made this exactly as stated. I must be a clutch because I had trouble slicing the tenderloin and keeping the bread crumbs from falling off. My knife was definitely sharp enough. I think if the crumbs would have stuck it would have added more flavor and crunch.

This was my first Pork Tenderloin, my wife usually does most of the cooking at our house but like most men my age I have become interested in what goes on in the kitchen, and when she comes home and supper is on the table - I'm a real hero. 

     I followed the directions exactly and I believe the trick to a tender/juicy tenderloin is placing it on the pan "fat side up", it makes all the difference. Between myself, my wife, son and daughter - the 5 pound tenderloin was gone the next night. We packed sandwiches and tenderloin biscuits for work after supper that evening and had leftovers the next night.

    I rubbed the meat on all sides with vegetable oil and then added salt and pepper. Wrapped in foil and baked for almost 2 hours (it was a rather large tenderloin). This one is definitely a keeper.

Really good, and easy!  My 2 girls (13 and 10)  liked it, which means this recipe's a keeper!  Question.  Will this freeze well? Sometimes 2 loins are too much and I would like to prep and freeze the second for a quick week-night meal.

I cooked it 45 minutes instead of 35; it took that long to reach 160 degrees. Other than that, just did what the recipe said, only half as much (only had one tenderloin). I was so pleased that the pork did actually come out juicy; every other time I tried roasting a tenderloin, it was dry. (Usually, to avoid the dryness, I just butterfly it, add rosemary and pepper, and broil it.)

This was a very good recipe and it will go into the dinner rotation.  It is also an excellent company entree, with stress-free prep & cooking.  I did add a few more spices garlic & onion powder, S & P). I used a meat thermometer with a probe, and it took a bit longer to cook than stated, but that could be my oven.  I followed another's advice and tented foil over the top for the first 20 mins and I'm glad I did.  It came out perfect  - tender & juicy and a little crunchy on the top, but not burned.

Easy to make and perfect results!  I almost made this in the slow cooker, but am thankful for the comments about baking this better cut of meat.  After reading a few of the reviews, the only thing I did differently was brush it with melted butter and added salt & pepper.  Delicious!!

I rubbed olive oil on the tenderloin, then generously  coated it with chipotle mustard.  I seasoned with it with garlic salt, smoked pepper, crushed dried rosemary, seasoned italian breadcrumbs , and backed it in a covered ceramic container for 45 min at 400 degrees.  Absolutely delicious and  very tender.  The chipotle mustard and smoked pepper gave it a smokey flavor with a kick!

One of my wife's favorites! I made it tonight but didn't have bread crumbs. I ran some lime tortilla chips through the blender instead. It was a nice twist that went great with the pork.

This was wonderful -Very juicy and tasty. I have made it twice and the only thing I changed the second time was to pat the tenderloin with the olive oil and then roll it in the breadcrumbs. This was easier and probably used less oil. Could not tell the difference in taste!

(totally new to cooking)
The tenderloin I bought already had garlic honey seasoning so I went light on added garlic.
Had some Panko crumbs I wanted to use up so used them instead. Dried meat and then coated by rolling it in large ziplock with the oil-moistened crumbs.
Packed crumb residuals around loin on cookie sheet covered with foil. Essentially perfect result.

This turned out great!!  The only change I made was to drizzle some olive oil, then salt, pepper and garlic powder over it before I put the bread crumbs on.  It was so flavorful and moist. Definitely will make again!

Wonderful!!!! I like using pork shoulder roast instead of tenderloin as it doesn't come out as dry. I also added rosemary and some fresh basel  + 1/4 cup of sherry and more breadcrumbs makes it a lot more savory and sooooooooo moist!!!

My teenagers and husband loved this recipe.  Very easy!  I did slather  the tenderloin with dijon mustard and olive oil then sprinkled it with garlic powder, onion salt, oregano and a little cayenne pepper.  Next I rolled it in Italian bread crumbs and baked until temperature of 150 F.  I let it rest for 15mins.   Sliced and served it  with mashed potatoes and salad.  Will definitely make again.

My family loved this recipe and so did I. 
Rub the meat with olive oil and some spices then press on the crumbs. Then a second coat with melted butter and more  crumbs. Give 10more minutes in oven because I had 2 big tenderloin pieces.  Let sit before serving. Tender, juicy and jummy.

This was fantastic! I placed it in a large bag with the olive oil and made my own seasoning. Then poured the breadcrumbs in a large bowl and rolled the loin around to coat. I baked 15 mins at 425 in a greased 9 x 13 inch casserole dish with halved yellow baby beets on one side and diced kohlrabi on the other. Flipped the roast, added another dish of green beans, added seasoning, olive oil and butter and baked another 20mins. I will make this again. Next time I'll add parm cheese to the breadcrumbs and experiment with different roasted veggies. Wonderful recipe!

I just made this for my best friend and I.  I've never made a pork tenderloin before, but have eaten them out at restaurants. It was fantastic! I coated it first in oil, then coated it with Dijon mustard.  Followed by Italian bread crumbs.  It was literally the best, moist pork tenderloin I've ever had.  I've been wanting to make this for at least a year, and I'm thrilled I used this receipt.  No need to try others.

I made this tonight, and it was really good.   Using advice from other reviews, I coated the tenderloins in olive oil, and then I seasoned with salt, pepper, and garlic powder.   I shook the tenderloins in a ziplock bag with half Italian seasoned breadcrumbs and half Panko breadcrumbs.   They were only lightly coated, so after laying them in the pan, I added some olive oil to the remaining crumbs in the ziplock, making a crumbly coating mixture, and patted that onto the top and sides of the meat.   Cooked according to directions.   It was scrumptious.

Decided last minute to make this and I'm glad I did!  I sprinkled salt and pepper plus a little ground sage on the pork tenderloin before rolling in breadcrumbs.  Actually, did breadcrumbs, dipped in whisked egg, then rolled in breadcrumbs again.  Seared in an oven proof pan first then put in the oven - the result was a moist, tenderloin served with "my favorite green bean casserole" from this site.  Had a little leftover that I tasted today (day after) and it's still delicious.  Nice recipe.  Thanks!

After reading other reviews, I also marinated the pork on a zip lock bag with olive oil and various spices and then cooked as per the recipe. Turned out very good - will make again.

This was so easy and good. The bread crumb mixture kept the pork tenderloin moist. My family loved it and I have passed it on to my friends. Next time I will lower the temperature to 375 and cook it a little longer, if necessary. It seemed to burn some of the crumbs. It could just be a difference in ovens.

To give it a flavour boost I made a few changes.  To the oil, I added low sodium soy sauce, some worchestershire sauce, and a dash of basalmic vinegar.  I brushed it on the tenderloin, sprinkled it liberally with garlic and onion powder and then rolled it in Italian seasoned breadcrumbs that I added a handful of Parmesan cheese to. Make sure not to overcook, and let it rest before slicing.. Delicious!!

Anytime I attempt a pork dish, I always tend to overcook and dry it out. This came out AHH-MAZING!!!  It was so easy to make, and soooooo moist. There was nothing left by the time dinner was over!!  This is definitely a keeper. The only thing I did different was use complete seasoning to give just a bit extra flavor.

Excellent recipe.  I followed it exactly, with one exception, and it came out great.  The only change I made was regarding the internal temperature.  I baked the pork, uncovered, at 425 degrees and took it out when it registered 145 degrees on the meat thermometer, about 40-45 minutes.  Some reviews stated that the breadcrumbs would either burn or fall off the pork.  I made sure the pork was thickly coated with the breadcrumbs.  This allowed the ones that burned to fall off and I was still left with a nicely coated piece of pork.

Sooo easy and sooo delicious!  I marinated this overnight in olive oil, pepper and garlic salt for some added flavor. The bread crumbs didn't stick 100% but that didn't take away from how awesome this dish turned out. I will definitely be making this again!

Really really good! Two pieces of tenderloin lasted us two meals and reheating the second piece the following night gave us a piece of pork that was equally as tasty the 2nd night as it was the first night.  I just microwaved it real fast to heat it back up.  This has become my favorite way to prepare tenderloin and I'll be using this recipe often.  There was no way the crumb mixture was sticking to the meat enough to leave a 1/4 inch coating but it didn't really matter.  It still tasted wonderful.  Thanks for posting this.

Absolutely loved it!  Quick! Easy!  The pork stayed sooooo moist! My olive oil & bread crumb mixture didn't crisp up as much as I had expected, but I can work with that.  My S.O. REALLY dug it!  (If the man's tummy is happy, that's half the battle of dinner time!)

I did season the meat before cooking as recommended by others but I still found this lacking in flavor.  It was really easy to put together but I would not make it again.

Wow, this a simple dish, but it does not lack in the flavor department!! I was so shocked. My husband asked what was on it and I said breadcrumbs. He couldn't believe that one ingredient could make it sooooo flavorful.  It also cooked perfectly, even though it took so long.  I will definitely use this as a base recipe and mix it up with some different spices, bread crumbs, etc.

Used a 1lb. Pork tenderloin. Seasoned with spices of choice first, olive oil next, placed the pork in a plastic bag with bread crumbs, till covered nicely. Baked at 350 for 45 minutes.  The pork was in fact very tender.

I would have given it a 5 star rating but I gave a 4 instead since my husband wasn't a fan of the breading.  I followed another reviewer's recommendation and rubbed the pork with a Dijon mustard and oil mixture. I only had plain bread crumbs so I added black pepper, garlic powder and dried basil. I will definitely make this again but with half of the bread crumbs.

Good and easy.  I did marinate the tenderloin in italian dressing before breading.  I didn't need nearly so much breading as is called for in the recipe.

I liked this, but I think it could be better. I had to cook it longer than the recipe said, but I do wish I had a meat thermometer so that way I can go by temp instead of time. It needed some more seasonings. However, I think it was still a great base recipe.

Overall, I followed the recipe pretty closely.  I did take the advice of other reviewers and marinated the pork in an herb mixture for 1 hour first.   The flavor was good, but I will add even more garlic and herbs next time.  I originally thought this recipe was only "OK", and gave it three stars.  When I remarked on it to my husband, he said that he really liked it and wanted me to make it again.  I changed my review to four stars to take his opinion into account.  He liked it because the meat stayed moist and tender.  It didn't bother him at all that the breading fell off like dry sand.  I had expected a breading that would be crispy on the outside, but moist enough to cling to the meat like oven-fried chicken.   This recipe does not deliver a coating that sticks, but it does protect the meat from drying out in the oven.  The olive-oil soaked breadcrumbs form an effective moisture barrier such that the crumbs brown instead of the meat.  Letting the meat rest after leaving the oven does stabilize the crumbs enough to make it to the table for a nice presentation.

My entire family loved it!  I've used Italian bread crumbs and garlic/herb-both are good but we liked the garlic/herb better. Have used on pork and chicken breasts-both are yummy.  Super easy weeknight meal.

Great recipe.  I would serve it to guests, it is that good. I will add it to our regular rotation since it is so simple and has ingredients that are always in my kitchen.

My family liked this recipe.  Easy.  I dried pork loin well so crumb mixture will stick to the meat.  I put meat in pan lined with aluminum foil and made a tent over meat.  Meat is moist but coating was soft.

The name says it all.  Go through 87 variations if you want, but this one is perfect AS IS.  At most, a little salt/pepper/garlic seasoning first, and I like just rubbing the oil right on the pork and rolling it around in the bread crumbs (easier).  Do tent with foil while cooking to prevent burning bread crumbs, and remove from oven at around 160 degrees (it will cook more while resting).

This was a game-time decision as it was after 5 and I had no time to marinate my 1# loin. I wound up just rubbing it with a little olive oil, sprinkling it with salt, pepper, onion powder and garlic powder, and then rolling it in some Italian breadcrumbs (probably less than 1/2 a cup). I probably wound up cooking it for about 50 minutes total - you'll just have to check based on your oven. It was so tasty and juicy. I made it with Quinoa with Peas and Sweet & Spicy Sweet Potatoes, both from this site. It was a good-looking and great-tasting dinner. DH and DS (5) loved the pork.

I was disappointed with this recipe.  The pork was not dry but the breading just didn't add anything special to me.  We ended up scraping it off.  I am deleting this recipe from my box.

Made this once and it was absolutely wonderful.  I didn't have the Italian seasoned bread crumbs, I only had plain bread crumbs.  So I added Italian seasonings to it and it turned out great.  It has been asked for by my husband more than once, so this is definately a keeper.

This looked good and easy and it was actually both.  I read many reviews before doing this, and decided to try it first without any modifications except lining the pan with foil and tenting the tenderloin.  I have a digital accurate oven and did not use a meat thermometer or probe.The bread crumbs at the ends were still a bit charred.  Also, the tenderloin shrunk up a little and pulled away at the ends of the crusting.  I think cooking at a little bit lower temp will fix this. Contadina Seasoned Bread Crumbs, an old standby, were very flavorful right out of the container.  Next time I do this I'll use fewer breadcrumbs and maybe rub some egg yolk over the tenderloin to help the crumb mixture stick.  Again, it was easy to prep, and was plenty good fixed up and cooked up exactly as written.

Great!  Kids of all ages loved, easy to make, easy to cook even for me, I usually over cook pork tenderloin but this turned out just right.  I did make use of the other suggestions to add some herbs and seasonings to the breadcrumbs.   I'm going to make this for company next time!

Mediocre at best.  I followed the recipe exactly and while the pork was moist this was probably due to the fact it had solutions added before it was packed.  It wasn't bad...just not the 4.5 stars I was hoping for.   Perhaps if it was marinated in a flavorful sauce first?

We didn't love it. I live in a remote area, so I made my own bread crumbs. That part was good, we just didn't feel like it was amazing. However, my picky 8 year old loved it. Go figure.  Rated it 4 stars because of how quick and easy it was to make. Would make again if I needed something super quick and easy, but that's it.

I have never cooked, bought, or even tasted pork tenderloin, so I was wonderfully surprised at how awesome it turned out. I did salt and pepper my pork first, and I also seasoned the panko bread crumbs with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder. I also used regular canola oil since I didn't have olive oil (did I mention I was a beginner cook?), so I don't know how much of a difference that would have made in taste. I rubbed the oil on the pork and then rolled in the seasoned bread crumbs until it had a nice thick coating. Cooked it until the thermometer read about 155-160, and oh my the flavor was AMAZING! Not to mention it made the house smell wonderful. It was so moist and full of flavor, and all three of my kids really enjoyed it. My six year old told me I did a good job! Lol, what more can you ask for? Plus, it still tasted great reheated the next day!

Delicious! I followed other reviews and added garlic powder, parsley, and Italian seasoning. It took my 1.5lb tenderloin approx 50 minutes to cook.

Turned out great.I even ate my whole piece and usually do not eat pork well. I made homemade bread crumbs. Dried bread in oven and ground up in processor with Italian seasoning.( heaping tsp. with about 6 lg. slices of dried bread made whole cup of crumbs when ground). I poured olive oil and honey mustard dressing in a bread bag with about a tablespoon spicy brown  mustard and marinated roast for about an hour, covered it in the bread crumbs and baked it according to the recipe. Unbelievable

This was really easy and tasted excellent. I did rub the pork with a little bit of olive oil before rubbing in the seasonings. I also didn't have fresh so I used dried.

I decided to change my pork this year for New Years Day, and went with this one. It is amazing!! I was nervous because the crust gotvery dark, but it locked in all of the flavor-and this will be served in my kitchen to start every New Year!

This dish did make the pork tenderloin very tender, I found the amount of bread crumbs were to much, next time I do this dish I will lessen the amount of crumbs to 1/2 the portion suggested.

After all of the great reviews, I was very disappointed.  I don't know why this didn't work for me.  I followed the recipe.  The breading was just okay and the meat was not tender and juicy.  I'm hesitant to try it again.

This is an excellent recipe. The whole family loved it and the pork came out perfect even though my oven is broken and I had to cook it in my toaster/convection oven. I rubbed the olive oil on the pork loin and seasoned with salt, pepper, and garlic powder, then pressed the bread crumbs onto the pork loin. Easy and impressive.

My first non-dry pork tenderloin.  Instead of packing the crust on the tenderloin, I spread the crust on plastic wrap and rolled the tenderloin like a jelly roll.  That worked, and no messy hands.  I marinated in a store bought greek marinade.  Will try again to perfect the crust and add some more flavour with a marinade.

Easily the most moist tenderloin I've ever made. You barely need a knife to cut it. What's more, my wife is a notorious sauce fiend but when she eats this, I don't hear a word about a sauce!

Made this in a pinch for a family meal. Flavors were really good. Proportions of breading seemed a little off. Maybe I had too much loin, but mind didn't cover all the way for the full .25 inches all around. Still really good, though. Will definitely make again. So easy.

This was the best Tenderloin! My first attempt at making one and for an Easter crowd no less...  I did this recipe exactly as written and it was delicious. The only thing I had a problem with was getting the breading to "brown". I tented while cooking and then uncovered at the end hoping for some browning and never did get it.  Overall the taste and tenderness was delicious and I will be makin this again.  Thanks for sharing!

Prepared this just as the recipe was written, and found it to be good, but the meat itself didn't have a ton of flavor. It did look nice! I think it would need the marinating that some of the reviews suggest to make it 5 stars.

Hmmmmm. I think this has potential (even though I was not a fan...). Made this for dinner tonight. My bf liked it, but didn't "love" it. I pretty much followed Susan's directions to a T, but did make a few adjustments as many others did. Here are my changes: a) marinated my 1 lb. tenderloin (I 1/2'd the recipe) for ~ 1.5 hrs. in 1 garlic clove (sliced) & 1/4 c. EVOO, b) made several 'slits' in the meat & filed w/ the sliced garlic , c) brushed both sides w/ ~ 1/4 c. dijon mustard / seasoned to taste w/ s&p & d) liberally coated all w/ 1 c. Italian bread crumbs, tented w/ aluminum foil and baked as directed. I am not sure how long it took for my tenderloin to cook thru (I used my Williams Sonoma digital thermometer set to register well done - 170 degrees). I found my meat to be a tad tough. This has NEVER happened to me b4 (I've cooked many well-done tenderloins that were juicy & tender). I think I need to buy my meat somewhere other than the Italian market next time (I have noticed that the frozen tenderloins I purchase at the Italian butcher are a dk. red color; the ones I purchase fresh at my local grocer are much lighter colored, similar to raw chx.). Could this make a difference texture wise? Who knows! This is definitely worth giving another go, but, when I do, I'll be sure to omit the mustard & follow Sue's directions :) Served w/ garlic carrots by Chris & herbed mashed potaotes. Thx. for sharing :)

This was very good. I took the advice of a few other reviewers and marinated the pork tender-loin in a honey-mustard marinade I made. I coated the meat with the bread crumbs, then mixed some egg into the rest of the crumbs and pressed it on to the outside for some extra coating. This was my first breaded meat dish and I'm very glad I tried it! I did find that it definitely needs to be covered as several reviewers have noted, and that I needed to avoid having too many bread crumbs on around the base of the meat, as those cooked much faster than the rest and I actually had to pull it out of the oven and scrape the extra away.

I tried the suggestions of rubbing the meat with salt, pepper and garlic powder prior to the bread crumbs.  I guess that I rubbed in a little too much salt, because the meat was *very salty*.  I would try this recipe again, but I'll have to pay attention to how much seasoning I add.

Very tasty! I cooked mine for plus 15 mins and covered with foil half way. I used a garlic/lemon prepkg pork loin.  I wish the crust was "crusty".. maybe add an egg?

Even using the suggested revisions (salt, pepper, garlic powder) my family found it lacking in flavour.  I probably wouldn't bother with this one again.

The whole family loved this one! Olive oil is just too expensive for our budget right now so I used real butter (its expensive too but we buy it on sale and freeze the extra) to mix with the bread crumbs. There were an awful lot of excess bread crumbs in the bottom of the pan. If I were to make any changes I would simply just reduce the amount of bread crumbs used. Otherwise it was WONDERFUL! Naturally it reminded us of breaded pork chops. Great with scalloped potatoes and fresh peas from the garden.

This was great. I will definitely make this again. It also was super simple. My only issue is that I overcooked the pork because I forgot that it keeps cooking for a few minutes even after you take it out of the oven. I will be more careful next time.

I'm not a huge pork fan but this was good. The only thing I changed was putting a little seasoning on the pork before putting the bread crumbs on. I gave it 4 stars because the bread crumbs came off too easily when done cooking.

This was definitely easy and elegant. I bought pork tenderloin that was already marinated in honey mustard and then all I did is add the bread crumbs. The pork took a while to cook though, probably 50 minutes. We were getting hungry and impatient so I ended up cutting it into slices to speed up the cooking. Next time I will make sure I have a meat thermometer on hand. It was super easy, still moist, and delicious. I will definitely make this again!

Super easy and tasty. I added some thyme to the bread crumbs just to give it a little more oomph.  You can pretty much add any spices you want.

I have made this several times but a bit different. I marinate it in Teriyaki sauce for about an hour then roll it in italian bread crumbs. My family loves it when I make this.

It was a very flavorful, moist tenderloin and very easy. The breading kind of fell apart at the end of the baking time and was more thick than I'd imagined.  Overall, it was very tasty and everyone loved it.

Simple and tasty.  Next time I will experiment with how I get the bread crumbs to stick to the tenderloin. Someone mentioned coating the meat in olive oil and then sprinkling with bread crumbs, this might work better for me since I had much of the bread crumbs fall off after cooking.

This recipe is easy and the meat turns out moist and tender, but, to us, the meat was bland tasting. First, I rubbed the pork with garlic flavored olive oil and ginger. Then I liberally sprinkled paprika, salt, pepper, Italian seasoning and garlic salt on the pork before breading. I also added Parmesan cheese to the Italian bread crumbs. Baking time was closer to 50 minutes. We are definitely in the minority here, most people seem to love this recipe, so I'd recommend giving it a try. However, I don't think I will be making this one again. Thank you, Susan Burget, for posting the recipe.

I thought this was very good, and yes, very easy.  My only complaint was that it was a little "Shake & Bake" like in taste, I think.  I mean, I loved the olive oiled crumbs which created a crispy, crunchy outside, but after doing this homemade, I felt like I could have done a box of Shake & Bake.  That being said, the cooking time was just perfect and my coating/topping did not over-brown or burn, so that was great. I did add some other herbs & spices/garlic to the recipe.  All in all -- very easy and very happy family with this meal. (Served it with a boxed parmesean cous cous, which was a terrific accompaniment).

Was tasty and certainly easy enough but It could use more flavor. Next time I make it I will marinate it first like another reader in Olive Oil and garlic. I will give it another try.

It was good, but the breading came out a little more moist that I like. I like my breading to be a little dry and crisp.

Very good. Moist and tender. I added a garlic powder and onion powder to mine to add some more flavor. Only problem was I would use plain bread crumbs next time and maybe less coating on the pork due to my husband said it was to much. I like the extra on so you'll have figure out what you like. overall a 4 and i will make again!!

Wow was this good! I added a bit of fresh rosemary to the bread crumbs to add more flavor, as well as sprinkle garlic powder on the tenderloin before covering with bread crumbs. Will do again! Thanks!

This recipe was very easy to make. I actually substituted the bread crumbs with crushed seasoned croutons. The extra crunch was a nice addition.

This was fantistic...I finally made pork without it being super dry.  I used a marinated tenderloin along with the Italian seasoned crumbs.  The whole family loved it!  Thanks for the idea

I only had plain breadcrumbs on hand, and while looking through my spice cabinet to add italian seasoning, I came across Emeril's Bayou seasoning. I decided to mix that in with the breadcrumbs instead.
The family loved it.  Very tender and moist meat. I will be making this again.

Good flavor.  Hard to get the right consistency to make the breadcrumbs stick to the pork.  Also, it looked horrible, not elegant at all.

A very good recipe - the meat was tender and moist and very easy to make.  We used plain breadcrumbs but added lots of oregano, basil and garlic powder.

This was good, it really did stay very juicy and tender!  I only gave it 4 stars because I guess I wanted a little more flavor, i am used to marinading a tenderloin, but this was such a great easy and quick (no time wasted to marinade) recipe!!

My husband used to complain that pork tenderloin was too dry until I found this recipe.  This cooking method ensures moist pork every time.  I have made this repeatedly with excellent results.  I do have a problem with the bread crumb crust breaking off when the meat is cut but with the amount of oil added to make the crust maybe that's a good thing.

My hubby prepared this dish for my Bunko group and it turned out well. Cook time did take a little longer and I was concerned about undercooking the inside and the outside getting burned but overall a hit.
