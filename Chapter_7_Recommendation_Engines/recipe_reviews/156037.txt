This recipe was really great. I read the other reviews about adding the cheese last, etc.  There is a very easy solution to this.   I just covered the pan with foil, and baked for one hour.  I removed the foil after the hour and completed the baking for an additional 30 minutes.  I was concerned with all of the tomato sauce and adusted slightly.   I added 2 (15 oz) cans of tomato sauce and 1 (6 oz) can of tomato paste with the garlic/oregano flavoring.  It turned out perfectly.   Cut very easily and my hubby loved it.  Don't forget to place foil in the bottom of your oven!  Saves  big mess.  Thanks for the recipe.  Will definitely make again.

This recipes is really good, except do not add the final layer of mozzarella until the very end, otherwise it ends up burnt to a crisp! haha whoops! Otherwise, very delicious.

Depending on your interpretation of "classic", this is NOT traditional lasange. Best to make your own sauce..with fresh basil added at the end with a cup of red wine and fresh garlic. Also, ground beef lends less flavour than Italian sausage. The rest of the recipe is just OK and best for those who are unable to make a proper sauce.

As good as any I have ever had! The only thing I changed was to use two jars of prepared sauce instead of messing with making my own. Had to give it 5 stars. Really good!

This was a very good simple lasagna recipe. I made my sauce a little different because I like to sneak extra veggies in whenever possible, so I added grated zucchini, carrots and green pepper.  I used whole wheat noodles and cottage cheese instead of riccotta, just because it is cheaper.

This was excellent.  My husband made this for our groumet pot luck group and everyone loved it.  The sausage gives it a little extra zing!  It didn't take 90 minutes to bake, though.  We took it out after an hour and it was done.  Thanks!

Barb, I love this recipe. I've used everything you've mentioned except the sausage. I also use cottage cheese in mine and big slices of mozzarella on top. I will difinitely be using the sausage on New Years Day. Thanks Rosie

Good stuff, but take the time to make homemade sauce.  I used fresh tomatoes and replaced the beef/sausage with ground turkey.  Yum!

VERY good.  Didn't have large enough dish for all the layers.  Only cooked for 1 hr, plenty of time.

This lasagna was phenomenal. I've been looking for a good standard lasagna recipe because I am 33 weeks pregnant and would like to start making meals to freeze. This fit the bill perfectly! My in-laws came over and kept raving about it. I just made a few changes, mostly based on other reviewer suggestions. I only used 2 cans of tomato sauce and 1 can tomato paste. I also used minced fresh garlic and kosher salt in place of the garlic salt. Since I didn't have oregano and basil, I used Italian seasoning and also a little cayenne pepper to give it just a little bit of a kick. I also used oven-ready, no-bake noodles for the ease. Finally, I covered it with foil while it baked until the last 15-20 minutes. Also, I baked it for 65 minutes and it came out perfect. I will definitely be making this again and again!

This was soooo good! We used 3 pkgs of sliced mushrooms and cooked them in butter, garlic and wine until soft and yummy.  I also carmelized 1 1/2 onions and layered that over one of the meat mixtures.  We had company for dinner and we all thought it was the best lasagne ever.  I followed previous suggestions and used 21 oz of ricotta and cooked for 30 min. @ 350 covreed and the remaining 30 min. uncovered.  It slices like a dream, looks great and was truly the best lasagne I have ever had!!  Thank you so much Barb R

Great recipe. I added fresh garlic and onions to the meat when i browned it cuz when i make italian sauces, it's got to have fresh garlic, onions, and herbs if possible. Cover with foil up to the last 20 minutes or add the cheese the last half hour and it wont get too dark on top. This is a classic keeper. If there are leftovers they wont last!

This is a decent recipe.  Though I don't see the reason for all the baking considering everything in the dish is already cooked, such as the noodles and the meat.  You could make this same dish with uncooked noodles (yes, seriously) and as long as they have sauce on one side ... just cover with aluminum foil and bake for 60 minutes @375.  The noodles will be perfect.  I promise.

We made this for a big family gathering and it was a huge hit.  To cut down on the amount of meat used, we omitted the ground beef and chopped up kidney beans in the food processor.  No one was the wiser.

I made a few changes to this recipe. I used crushed tomatoes instead of two of the cans of tomato sauce. I also mixed in about a half of a small container of cottage cheese to the ricotta mixture and used a little less mozzarella and then substituted colby/monterey jack for the rest. Turned out great!

This recipe is very good - but - does anyone believe the prerp times on these recipes?  This one says 15 minutes prep time, and then tells you to simmer the tomato mix for 30 minutes.  Not to mention the cleaning, chopping, etc.  My critique is that far too much tomato sauce is called for, and as others have said, 90 minutes baking time is a good 15 minutes too long.  Also, am I the only one who did not know there is now pre-cooked lasagna pasta on the market?

This lasagna is great! I added a couple handfuls of fresh chopped basil to the ricotta mix, as well as used fresh mushrooms instead of canned. I added two red bell peppers chopped up also. Overall, turned out excellent!

'twas delish! I made a few adjustments: used 1 lb ground turkey instead of ground beef; about 2 tsp fresh garlic (I love garlic!) instead of garlic salt; 2 cans diced tomatoes to replace 2 of the cans of tomato sauce; cottage cheese instead of ricotta; one chopped onion cooked up with turkey/sausage; baked covered with alum foil for first hour, uncovered for last 30 min.  Even my VERY finicky children enjoyed it, albeit they all complained about the mushrooms. Was very flavorful, tender, moist, and tasty!

I use this recipe countless times, and it has NEVER failed! I use ground turkey along with spicy italian sausage.  I also used the advice to cover with tin foil for the first 45 and then off for browning the last 25.. FOOL PROOF and equally amazing!!

The cooking time was too long, and it would have tasted better with fresh ingredients.  Slice your own mushrooms or use presliced if you don't have enough time.  Also, a fresh tomato or two and minced garlic in the sauce added some zest.  It also would have benefited from some red pepper and cumin, just enough to add a spicy and savory flavor.

I made lasagna for the first time ever and used this recipe and it was a major hit for my family. My picky 9 year old ate it up not knowing that it had mushrooms in it until he was finished and he begged me to make it the same way again tomorrow lol! I was super excited this was an amazing recipe for picky eaters and first timers!

I used 10 lasagna noodles, which is half a whole box. This way I had five lasagna noodles for each layer. I used fresh garlic instead of garlic salt and I added chopped onion to the sauce. After tasting the sauce, I did add a bit more spice. I have to say that using ricotta cheese may be more expensive but I've come to find that my lasagna held together much better than when I use cottage cheese. I changed up the layers, starting with the noodles first as a base and I only repeated the layers once and I did double the shredded mozzerella. Very simple, quite easy. Out of a huge lasagna pan, only one serving was left.

I used the smaller amount of sauce as others mentioned, and omitted the sausage, only because I didn't have it on hand.   My whole family loves it!

This was very tasty, but definitely be sure to cover the top with foil or add the cheese later.  My husband enjoyed this very much!  Thank you.

This is a great guide for lasagna. We made our own meatsauce instead of jarred sauce or what the recipe called for. We also did not use italian sausage. My husband doesn't care for fenil seed so we used a pound of ground pork instead. There is never enough mozzarella cheese so next time, we will use/have more. We cooked uncovered for an hour and let it rest. It was a hit! My 4 year old niece, who is pretty picky, went back for seconds! We'll definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing!

Pretty boring recipe.  I substitited italian sausage for the hamburger and used some tasty spaghetti sauce in place of the tomato sauce.  Also there's the cooking time is entirely tooooo long.  You can actually layer uncooked noodles and slide in the oven for about 45 minutes and you're good to go.

I liked this recipe and my family did too, but, when I made it a second time altering a few steps I liked it a little more. I think this is a great foundation recipe that individuals can put a twist to if wanted.

We loved this! The italian ssg adds a ton of flavor. I used Bertolli sauce instead of making it. Tripled the parm (what can I say, we love cheese!)and sliced up and sauted fresh mushrooms in butter, red wine and garlic vs the canned ones. I actually made 2 pans and froze one, using only 2 layers in each.

Bene! Bene! Make sure you use real parmesian cheese. It comes in a big wheel, not in a can. I like to have a little Merlot with it because it has red in it. Presentation is key. Only use Mozzarrella cheese on the top. No yellow cheese.

Mushrooms are a favorite of mine but do nothing for this dish.  Dish needs diced  tomatoes. Garlic salt needs to be replaced by garlic powder or fresh garlic.

This recipe was very good; however I did make some adjustments.  First, I used a pound of fresh mushrooms instead of the canned mushrooms.  Next, I used 3 cloves fresh garlic instead of garlic salt.  Also, I used 2, 28oz cans of diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce.  Finally, I used 1 ½ pounds of mozzarella instead of a pound.  I plan to try fresh tomatoes next time, I find the fresher the recipe the better it is......Bon Appétit!

Very good sauce! But, I don't think it really needs a whole 90 minutes to bake. We had a brown-not-quite-burned crust of cheese on top at 60 minutes. Probably would have been okay at 45-50 minutes.

I had never made lasagna before this recipe. I made it for a few of my friends that are crazy for the stuff. I eye-ball measured on the herbs, added spicy italian sausage and used a red and black pepper blend. The table was silent while everyone ate. After dinner everyone hugged me. It was that good.

This recipe was good but it got a little dry and I think it was from the cooking time.  I don't think it needs too cook that long because everything is cooked beforehand.

Followed the recipe to a tee(no mushrooms), the only exception was, like all the other reviews say, add the cheese last.

Wow this was a bit different from the traditional lasagna i am used to but this reminded me of the lasagna that my grandmother used to make for us a long time ago. This is definitely a favorite recipe of mine. I will continue making this one.

My family DEVOURED this dish and begged for more! I did not make any changes to this recipe the first time I prepared it, but made it a second time with spaghetti sauce to save some time and we couldn't tell! I'm asked to make this once a week!

I thought this was perfect. It is exactly what it says it is a Classic Lasagna. I had made lasagna before and it was so time consuming I never made it again. This was pretty easy and I am a mom of a toddler and preschooler with little time on my hands to cook a big meal. It was comforting, yummy and easy and I didn't change a thing.

You don't have to precook the Lasagna noodles. Prepare everything and layer the noodles without cooking them first it is easier to spread on the cheese and saves time. I added  large link polish like sausages cut up in the meat sauce also. Yummy

This was my first time making lasagna and it was super easy!  I added a few handfuls of fresh spinach, ground turkey instead of beef and sausage, whole wheat pasta, and omitted the mushrooms (but will add next time).  Delicious!  I think next time I will add more noodles!  Thanks!

I made this lasagna last weekend and it was very great! However I did make a few changes right from the start.  I used 1 teaspoon of fennel seeds along with 1 small chopped up onion and two cloves of garlic when cooking the meat.  I also thought the 3 eggs to one 15 ounce container of ricotta and parmesan cheese was too runny so I added another 6 ozs of ricotta, plus a teaspoon of nutmeg to the mixture.  When layering, I also added slices of provolone to the layers!  Since I wasn't cooking the lasagna til the next day, I didn't boil the noodles. After completing the lasagna, I covered it and placed in the fridge til the next day. Cooked it covered for 30 mins and uncoverd for the rest of the indicated time.  It was so delicious and will be my lasagna recipe for years to come!

I thought this recipe was very delicious; however I made a couple of changes. Instead of beef I used turkey, I used twelve noodles instead of nine, and I used two cans of sauce and two cans of fire roasted diced tomatoes instead of four cans. I also waited to add all of my mozzarella cheese at the end. Overall this was a wonderful recipe.

Fabulous recipe!  I've used it several times now and have made it my own by using more noodles.  I also use only 3 cans of tomato sauce and add 3/4 of a cup of red wine at the same time as the tomato sauce.  -my favorite red wine to use is cabernet sauvignon.  I cover the dish with foil for the first hour and take off the foil for the last half hour.  Got rave reviews at today's family celebration.  I constructed the lasagna last night, covered it with foil and put it the fridge overnight.  Took it out an hour before putting it into the oven to bake today.

Lasagna needs sauce! This was so dry. I made more homemade sauce the next night & fixed it. At least double the sauce or look 4 a different recipe.

I've been using this recipe to make lasagna for about 28 years, but I've never used mushrooms.  My children and all the people I've made it for, love it.  So do I!  Maybe I'll try it with the mushrooms next time.  If you try it, it will become a favorite at your house too!

This recipe was terrific.  Like others, I cooked covered for an hour.  

I thought the sauce was a tad bitter so I added a tablespoon of sugar.  

The sausage was fantastic!

I thought this recipe could be better the ricotta cheese mix was thick. Next time I will maybe add an egg or use less cheese and also I will wait until about 10 minutes before the lasagna is ready to put the cheese on top.

I did quite a bit of altering in this recipe to make it healthier. I used whole wheat lasanga noodles, ground turkey instead of sausage & beef, low-fat cottage cheese instead of ricotta, and made sure the olive oil was extra virgin. It tasted great and is way better for you.

Fantastic recipe! I use Italian sausage from the market as to make it extra spicy and I use 2 tbsps. of Kirkland's Tuscany spice blend instead of what the recipe calls for. Everyone loves it. Definitely worth the prep time. I make it for me and my husband, and just freeze the rest for leftovers later.

I made this for 30 people at my Celebrate Recovery group at church last night. I added cooked pancetta instead of salt, hot Italian sausage, fresh mushrooms and no boil lasagna noodles. Everyone loved it.

Awesome recipe!  Of course, I used my own sauce (I use my own home canned tomatoes, 2 cans tomato sauce and a can of tomato paste to give it thickness).  The egg ricotta mixture is simply perfect and makes a great authentic lasagna.  Will be making this one from now on!

This was really easy to make.  I used no-boil noodles and ground turkey, though.  Because of the no-boils, I had to place the noodles away from the sides of the pan because they expand. The cooking time was shortened from 90 minutes to 60.  And I also took the advice of adding old red wine at the end of the meat sauce cooking time. Oh, and of course add the top layer of mozzarella at the end.

This was such a hit!  I ended up making half of the recipe vegetarian and baking the two pieces in separate, smaller dishes.  I used about half of the sauce the recipe called for (I bought actual sauce instead of just tomato sauce) and used fresh herbs.  All else according to the directions and it was the best ever!

Great recipe! I didnt use any of the herbs or tomato sauce  as I can my own spagetti sauce so I used it in its place which already has herbs. Boy did these noodles swell but it tasted great and feed my family of 4 3 meals!

This was absolutely delicious!
It took about 2 hours though.
I substituted 1/2 mild, 1/2 hot Italian sausage in for the beef. This added an added flavor that was delicious!
This is enough for 12 people, not 8. It is huge!

I loved it. I didn't add the sausage, so I halved the seasonings and added slightly less sauce. I also didn't cook it an hour and a half. I cooked it 40 minutes covered, 10 minutes uncovered (added the extra mozzarella at this point) and then took it out and let it sit for about 10-15 minutes. It was delicious! I quickly replaced this recipe with my old lasagna recipe.

Really good.  I put the cooked meats into the food processor for a quick spin to make really small pieces.  It's easier to spread around the lasagna and makes it easier to eat too!

Very good. But, I put a little bit too much of the cheese mixture on the top. It made it a little bit too strong. But otherwise it was AMAZING

It was yummy. Definately let it simmer how long it calls for. I didn't and It would have probably had a richer flavor if i was more patient

Wow! A lot of work goes into making lasagna but it was worth it! I used some of the tips from other people on the site but for the most part didn't make many changes. Now I've made this several times and I do something a little different each time but I love this as a great base recipie! Thanks

I am from a very italian family and am very picky about dishes like this. I am a nanny for very picky eaters and was looking for more kid friendly versions. I found this recipe and it is AMAZING!! The children LOVE IT and even the pickiest eater, had 3 helpings of it! I added a little more garlic and seasons to taste, but nothing drastic! This recipe is def for moms or dads of picky eaters!!!

I have never tried to make lasagna,always thought it would be complicated,but I tried this recipe and my family loved it.I think it is very close to Olive Garden Lasagna.Remember to add topping cheese after baking and return to oven till melted(uncovered)

Best lasagna I have ever tasted.  I don't cook the noodles either.  I just buy regular lasagna noodles and put them in uncooked.  I have been told this lasagna tastes "restaurant style".  Very good.

This was my first time making lasagna, and it turned out YUMMY.  I made it for guests, and everyone had seconds.  I used ground turkey instead of beef, and Hot Italian sausage.  Although it does take awhile, I will definitely make this again.

The oven might not cook at 350 but rather like 275 or 300 that happens with some ovens , the seal gets old or maybe warps from heat stick a thermonitor in there sometime you'd be suprised.

This was a big hit with the family! I used three jars (16 oz) of Ragu w/flavoring instead of the tomato sauce (along w/ the seasoning listed) and a little extra cheese (can't go wrong w/extra cheese) and people were asking for the recipe. Well worth the time!!

This recipe was ok, was a little disappointed because I was a beginner and I think next time I'll make my own tomato sauce instead to give it more flavor. Also, I think this dish has too much meat in it. I could have done it without the Italian sausage.

I as well have made this recipe for years. . . Although we sometimes add additional meat, sliced hard salami works very well. I omitted the ground beef and went with 2 lbs of Italian sausage. This recipe was a bit too salty, so I will omit the garlic salt and just use crushed garlic next time. Does anyone know if you end up with a layer of noodles on top or meat sauce. The recipe said to layer twice but I had so much remaining sauce I just ended with a layer of cheese and then sauce, saving the remaining Mozzerella for the top during the last 30 minutes of baking.

I rarely make a recipe the day I save it, but I did this time.  It was excellent!  The only change I made was to use 'oven ready' lasagna noodles to save time.  That required, according to the directions on the package of lasagna noodles, adding additional moisture.  Worked perfectly, and will definitely make this again.  Thanks!

Our Family loved this lasagna! I used a standard casserole dish that was rectangle and used nine pieces of lasagna, and did not use all the meat mixture. I did not change anything about this recipe and cooked it as stated. My noodles got a little crispy around the edges, but they were wonderful and members of our family liked that part. We loved, loved, loved this lasagna!  I made a second batch using zucchini instead of noodles. I cooked it for 45 minutes. Zucchini was still a little bit crunchy but our group liked that. Both recipes were loved by everyone. I would not change anything about this recipe. It will be staying on my favorites list.

This is the first time I have made lasagna, and it was a hit. EVERYBODY, even the most picky eater in the house had two servings. The only ingredient I  didn't use was mushrooms.  Next time I think I'll  use a little more ricotta cheese (felt like I ran a little short on my last layer).  I double and triple checked oven settings to make sure I had it right; I wound up taking it out about 20 minutes earlier than the directions suggested and it was fully cooked and very brown; I think if I had cooked it in the oven as long as this recipe says, it would have burnt. VERY TASTEY

The recipe came out great! I cut the cooking time down to 1 hour without noticing a difference. I used turkey meat in place of ground beef and left out the sausage (didn't have any on hand). I used only two jars of tomato sauce and it was saucy enough for us! Served with homemade garlic bread and you have a great meal! Will make again!

Loved it... added an onion... added some pepperoni.. as cooking the sauce it looked too big for the 13x9 baking dish... used one size larger and added a few extra noodles...  covered with foil when cooking and added the last mozzarella cheese and uncovered 10 min prior to taking out of the oven... dang near perfect!!  Had it with Garlic Bread and an Italian Salad... The Wife liked it so much she is sharing some left overs with friends... -- I'm a slow cook so prep took a while.... clean up was easier than expected - probably due to the foil.

This was quick to make. I liked it didn't have onions in it, but wasn't crazy about the mushrooms. The sauce leaves more to be desired. Good but not great. 3.5 stars

Family loved it! Used pasta sauce already seasoned, oven ready lasagna noodles and Italian shredded cheese that included parmesan, romano, mozarella and provel. No need to cook 90 minutes, an hour at 375 was plenty.

I thought this lasagna was great. I added onion and chopped garlic and 1/2 tsp of fennel. I also only baked it for 45 minutes, that's all I thought it needed. I use this recipe every time I make Lasagna.

a couple of different touches! 

1. (DON'T KNOCK IT TIL YOU TRY IT!) when preparing the dish, I slice a couple of boiled eggs to add to the layers. they add a nice touch. my mom used to do that once in a while. to sample this, just add the eggs to one side of the dish (or make a separate dish) I love it! 
2. prepare and bake the dish the day BEFORE you are going to serve it. refrigerate it overnight, then warm it up the next day! much, much tastier!

Ended up leaving out the meat and mushrooms.  Used 2 jars of prepared spaghetti sauce instead of the tomato sauce.  Also, I did not cook the lasagna noodles ahead of time.  I put them into the casserole dish uncooked.  This lasagna was amazing!  Will make again and again!

I made this dish to take to a friends house for a funeral dinner. When it can time to bake it I had a problem.  As it was baking I began to smell something burning.  I went and checked on the lasagna and the even though the recipe calls for 90 minutes at 350 by one hour into it, the top was ugly brown and burnt.  I took it out of the oven and am embarrassed to take to my friends house.  Hopefully, it will taste better than it looks.  The top layer will have to be thrown away!

Delish! This is by far the best lasagna I've ever made.I wanted a more flavorful recipe than the one we had previously been using and tried this one. The one thing I always do when making lasagna is heavily season the ricotta with Italian seasoning and plenty of salt about an hour or so before assembly...this always seems to make such a difference in the taste and flavor of the overall dish. But the rest of the recipe I pretty much followed to a T. As the author suggested, I used spicy Italian sausage. I was crunched for time, though, and only baked this about an hour, but it still came out amazing! Made two pans and stocked the freezer with pre-cut pieces of this yummy dinner to have on hand. Thank you for this recipe!

I came in from work tonight and the house smelled so good. My wonderful husband had made this lasagna. He just followed the recipe except added MORE CHEESE!! Oh my gosh, it is the best meatiest, cheeseiest lasagna ever. The sauce was divine too, just right. Like other posters, did not cook the full time- 60 min was plenty.

i love it, very tasty. only thing i changed was i used two cans of prepared sauce instead of making my own.  Everyone that has had it loved it and keeps raving about it.  oh and instead of ricotta we use cottage cheese, have tried both way and like both but we just like the cottage cheese better.  enjoy :)

I don't think the Ground beef does this justice, I would use more sausage in place of it.  Make your own sauce instead of using canned sauce.  It was ok. may family likes mine better.

This was an awsome recipe.  It does have a long cooking time but it was simple to make.  I have made it twice and it has gone over very well.  I even made a vegitarian option by omitting the meat and adding more mushrooms.  Thank you for the recipe!!!

LOVE this recipe.  I make it everytime a friend has a baby or else could use a break from cooking for a couple of nights.  Everyone is so impressed when they receive a homemade lasagna, but when they *taste* it, that's when the compliments start rolling in.  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious!!  Followed the recipe & only added some extra Spike seasoning and 1/2 bag frozen carrots, thawed to the meat mixture.  Huge hit, I'll make this again and again.

I loved this recipe!  I did omit the eggs,thyme and parm (just simply forgot)but there was no lack in flavor.  I did use italian seasoned turkey and mild ground sausage.  I added several dashes of worstechire and tabasco to the meat sauce as well as a little brown sugar. I also decided last minute to saute some mushrooms in garlic and butter which I also put into the sauce. Carmelized onions added sooo much to the dish and it turned out beautifully(layered on top of meat sauce)  I did reduce the cook time to 1 hour and it still set up nicely!!

Beware! The cooking time should be 55 minutes not 90! I ruined it by baking too long!

Very good though my picky daughter thought there was too much sausage. Will reduce sausage to 1/2 lb next time. Yes, it was worth trying again, everyone else liked it.

This was pretty good. I think I might use more mozzarella next time and top with some more Parmesan. I used canned sauce and added zucchini, broccoli and cauliflower to the sauce.

Great lasagna recipe. I made a few modifications; turkey in place of beef and used whole wheat pasta. It is an easy recipe and made enough for me to freeze some for another meal.

This was wonderful. The italian sausage really makes this dish. I always do homeade spaghetti sauce, but the jar stuff would still be awesome.
