Very flavorful.  May be too sweet for some with the pineapple, so I added a few dashes of chipotle hot sauce to give it a touch of heat.

I enjoed this sandwich. I left out the boullion because I didn't have any and I served this in a whole wheat tortilla instead of a roll. The only thing I felt was missing some heat. To counteract the sweetness of the pineapple I added a small bit of cayenne. I also would have liked a bit more flavor from the sweet chili saice since I love that stuff. next time I'll add a drizzle of that to my wraps.

I loved this as a nice change from BBQ or pulled chicken. I did make a few tiny changes - no green onions on hand, so I used vidalia slices, and my sweet chili sauce is actually pretty sweet, so I added another splash of vinegar and a few dashes of dried red pepper flakes to add the kick. I liked the coleslaw with the cheese in it, but for the future might not top the sandwich with another pineapple ring - a tad to sweet for me and made the bread a bit soggy. I will make this again!

It was ok. Very different taste. I suggest using fresh lemon juice. My husband liked it alot.
