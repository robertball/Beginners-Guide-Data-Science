DELICIOUS! This is a very wet, soft brownie, with the perfect amount of Grand Marnier. I would recommend cutting them into 1-inch squares because they're so rich. HINT: pour the batter into the pan, and then sprinkle the chocolate chips on top of the batter. (Mine sunk to the bottom and melted.)

Delicious recipe! I love orange and chocolate together and this does the trick. A tip for those who mention their chips sank to the bottom: toss the chips in a bit of flour before adding them to whatever you're baking, and they won't sink :)

These are GRAND (!) and have become a regular item for company and gift-giving. Note: A small piece goes a long way. I found mini chocolate chips work best; standard size sink to the bottom. I believe most people will enjoy these brownies.

These were excellent. Since I did not have any baking chocolate on hand I used the conversion on the back of the cocoa powder (3 Tbsp cocoa 1 Tbsp oil per square of chocolate). I also used 1 Tbsp orange extract in place of the Grand Marnier and zest. They tasted just like the chocolate oranges at christmas time. Very moist brownie. I will certainly make them again.

I had never made brownies without a mix before this, so was a little concerned starting off. After reading reviews, I used 1/4 cup of Kahlua instead of the Grand Marnier (just because that's what we had on hand) and these came out fantastic! Our guests loved these brownies and have asked me already to make them again. Great recipe!

these were excellent. I did not use choc chips at all. I think there could be a lot less sugar and I will try that next time.

I tried Hennessy Cognac with extra vanilla, orange zest - fresh and dried (McCormick Valencia Orange Peel). I also put the chips on the top and all the flavorings in the mix. I baked for 35 min. The flavor was good. I think the next time our family would like to try Chambord as we like chocolate/raspberry flavors.

SO fudgy and moist!  Really fantastic combination of flavors that won rave reviews with a group of 10 who "taste tested" it.  There were leftovers which was fortunate, because these brownies actually tasted better 3 days after they were made.  I'll make them ahead next time.  Scrumptious!

These made great Kahlua Brownies by removing the orange zest and adding 1/4 cup of Kahlua. To serve, I put a generous brownie square on a plate, topped each with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, and drizzled with hot chocolate sauce. It was a delicious dessert.

I have been adding Grand Marnier to my brownies for years.  These are awesome...if you try them once you will never settle for regular brownies again!
Orange liquer is not the same...

We all liked these, however, thought next time I make them I will use less Grand Marnier...taste was a bit strong. (I like GM on the rocks, so it's not a matter of not liking GM.

How could this NOT be good?! Very satisfying and yummy.  I agree, though, that it should be cut into smaller pieces, because it is rich -- and deadly for dieters

I made these for a dinner party, and the guests loved them!  
I followed the recipe exactly, but since I wanted the orange taste to be a bit stronger I added a tablespoon of orange extract along with the Grand Marnier.

Great flavor! My family loves the chocolate oranges that come out at Christmas time and these tasted just like them! I only mixed in the Grand Marnier and did not spread the remaining on top, and I sprinkled the chocolate chips on top only.

After trying this recipe, I am definitely going to make brownie trays instead of the traditional cookie trays as gifts.  Coworkers and family loved them so I made two more double batches tonight.  I tried one with Grand Marnier, one with Kahlua and one with Peppermint Schnapps.  The orange had the strongest flavor but Kahlua was my favorite.   Great recipe!  Thanks for making my Christmas baking so easy!

Wonderful flavour.
I didn't have any orange zest so I added orange extract. Added chocolate chips on top and they were done in 30 minutes with no jiggle in the middle at all.

This is an orange-flavored brownie recipe that is wonderful as a close to a good meal. I didn't find it overly rich, and I used milk-chocolate chips and 2oz. of unsweetend chocolate instead of 1 oz.  I also added sliced strawberries and cream on the plate as a complement to the orange flavoring.  The end-size is pretty small though, so you could double this recipe for a larger crowd.

Delicious.  fudgy and rich.  I sprinkled Milk Chocolate chips and dried cherries on half to try it.  Yum! the side with the cherries was slightly less rich than the non-cherry side but had a nice tartness and complimented the Grand Manier wonderfully.

Good - gooey and chocolatey, but the orange flavor was not as strong as I would have liked. If I were to make this again, I would probably add a little orange extract to pep it up a bit.

These are AWESOME!!! Love them! 
I also sprinkle my chocolate chips on the batter after it's in the pan because I did notice that they sink to the bottom otherwise. These are a no-fail treat that I will continue to keep making! Thanks!

The best brownies I've ever eaten!  Already a family favorite after making them once!  They're super easy, moist, fudgy and delicious.  I can't imagine ever making any other brownies-they're absolutely spectacular!

Wow, super rich, moist, chewy brownie flavor.  I replaced half the butter with applesauce, used semi-sweet chcoclate, and a bit less sugar.  Chocolate orange isn't my favorite combo but many people at work loved these.

This is a very adult brownie. Everyone loved these when I made them. They make great gifts. A good recipe for the holidays.
