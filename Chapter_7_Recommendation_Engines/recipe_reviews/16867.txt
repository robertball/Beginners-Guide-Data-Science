I just folded into triangles and sealed.  I fried one to taste then decided it needed a little something so mixed the pepper jack with cream cheese, a touch of garlic powder and a drained can of chopped green chili peppers, were much more exciting to eat with the additions.

I love making cheese sticks using wonton wrappers. It gives them a different taste and texture. I usually buy cheese bricks when they are on sale and make huge batches of these and keep them on hand in the freezer. Reheat at 350 degrees for about 10 minutes and they will turn out crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside as though you had just made them fresh! Serve with any sauce you like, salsa, spaghetti sauce, pesto, cocktail, etc.

Mmm, Tasty! Made these for a christmas party and they didn't last long. I used cubes of pepperjack cheese instead of shredded.

Any version of fried cheese is great in my book, but these become to die for if you add some cooked ground taco meat. If you seal them in a triangle shape, you can get the most filling in them.

I like these with shredded fajita meat, diced green chilis and regular jack cheese.    DO NOT OVERFILL the won ton.  I make pot stickers all the time; if you have to stretch the wrapper over the filling - it's going to leak.  Dip your finger into a bowl of cold water, outline two edges of the won ton on two sides, and flip the corners together to fold  a triangle and gently pinch the side together.  Dip in some guacamole, pico de gallo or if you want an immediate heart attack, more queso.

These came out SUPERB!  I added half a can of diced chilies, chili powder and garlic powder to the cheese to give it a little extra kick!  I live in S. Korea..and we don't have won ton wrappers..instead we have Lumpia Wrappers (i've never handled wonton, so don't know how it differs in taste)...I wrapped up the cheese and sealed the wrapper up with an egg/cornstarch mixture..then I froze them overnight to ensure they would stay sealed during frying..they ended up frying up beautifully!  Easy to make!!

These were really good.  Definately serve them with some salsa or dip.  They are kind of plain alone.

These are amazing. A little time consuming but well worth it. I added some fresh cilantro left over from salsa I made to go with these. I did make a few hours ahead of time so they did get soggy but crisped up well in the oven.

Instead of deep frying them, try lining a muffin tin with the wonton wraps, filling them with your favorite mexican mixings, and baking them at 350 for about 10-12 minutes.  There goes  your bursting problem and they are scrumptous!!

Great recipe! I made them  once, as written, and they were very delicious. So I will give it 5 stars! But the next time I made it, I definitely put my own spin on them! I cooked up a small amount of taco meat, mixed it with chopped onions, chopped jalapenos, cream cheese, and pepper jack cheese. Then I stuffed the wonton wrappers and fried em up. I took them to a party...they were gone within 20 minutes!

I added cream cheese and a can of diced chilis to the pepper jack cheese.  Addictive!  I made Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce for dipping.  We ended up not even eating dinner, just the wontons!

These were good, but needed more flavor. The second time I added taco seasoned chicken & onions. Also as a healthier option I baked instead of fried. They came out much better! This is a good base recipe, but I highly recommend adding some more to it whe you make it at home.

I am laughing on this one!  I could not find won ton wrappers so I used fillo dough instead.  It worked out but they were not very pretty with my artistic fillo dough wrapping, but the flavor was great and I got glorious reviews from everyone on the taste.  I took some others advice and added chopped up jalapeno sausauge links, some green chiles and fine grated cheese.  Served with chipolte sauce and guacamole.  Will make again and try to find the won ton wrappers next time so they will look better!!  But the fillo style tasted great!

I tried this recipe after reading the reviews for reviews and recommendations.  These are tasty all the ways I made them. The first round I made two different kinds, half the batch using pepperjack and the other half using cream cheese.  I thought the pepperjack was tastier and more exotic tasting but the cream cheese was good as well (not alot of cream cheese is needed).  Since you get a ton of wonton wrappers.  The second round I used chicken with carrots and celery as well as minced garlic, seasoned with salt and pepper.  Chicken was SO good.  I would recommend that you also explore several versions.  Its quick and easy to wrap, and fries in just seconds (you don't want them too crispy).  Its a must try! Enjoy!

I used cheddar/jack and added a little dab of diced ortega chilis in each one.  So good, it's hard to stop eating them!

These were great right out of the pan. I did as she suggested and made some ahead of time and then put them in the oven later. They turned out horrible! I will never make these ahead of time again.I will however make these to serve right away as they were delicious fresh made.

Where's the beef? I would add refried beans and shredded beef to the cheese.  Make a dipping sauce out of sourceam and salsa.

The only way I can rate this recipe is with 5 stars because I failed terribly at making these little difficult things. Wow I don't know how I screwed these up so bad. I couldn't get the edges of the won tons to stay together and they kept tearing. Once I got that under control I fried them and all the cheese came out of them(guess I didn't really get that all the way under control). Kinda like when you get a crab ragoon from a chinese place and all the filling is gone :-(, ugh so sad and frustrating. Okay so I decided to bake them and the same thing happened the cheese came out allll over the cookie sheet. Ugh so sad and frustrating. There was one out of the ones I fried that I did get to taste and it was really yummy, if I ever attempt these again I will def. add some stuff to the feeling. Oh well better luck next time. LOL

Very good. After I had them I thought there are all kinds of stuff you can do. Last time I put taco meat that had onion and green bell pepper, a little cheddar cheese...fabulous! Maybe next time I will make mini apple pies! Thanks so much for the recipe!

I have many many eggrolls and wontons in the past. I had no problem filling and sealing the wontons but when I fried or baked them all the cheese had leaked out. It could be the cheese I used. I would try this again but with other bulkier fillings added like refried beans along with the cheese. And they were yummy, just hollow in my case.

I Didn't shred my cheese and I fried them..I didn't have any trouble with splashing and a little bit of cheese seeped out on some of the won tons (that's why I wouldn't recommend shredded) ..but if you just make sure the oil is not too hot and you're won tons are fried for 2-3min...not longer..it shouldn't be a problem...Don't hesitate to try these just cause other reviewers added way more ingredients..They're delicious as written..Don't forget the salsa!

Sounds delicious, probably will take viewers advice and spice it up with meat & chili.  Has anyone frozen these? Can they be heated up in oven nicely?  That is a key ingredient in my schedule.

This was good, but needed a little something.  I ate them with some hot sauce i had on hand, and it was a nice treat, but I think there is room to improve by adding different ingredients.  I plan to try again at a later time and add some onions or garlic to see if I can get some more taste.

Outstanding! Just pepperjack cheese is too bland in my opinion, so I added sliced serrano peppers and cilantro to mine. Everybody raved, I'll be making this again.

Added some taco meat.  Used sour cream and some cheddar cheese sauce, along with some salsa to dip in.  Delicious.  Thanks for the post.

The texture & taste of the wanton wrappers is brilliant . I added finely shredded green onion , finely chopped coriander (cilantro)  & a pinch of Mexican chilli powder to liven these up a little. They were delish! I also served them as an accompaniment to a  corn & red pepper soup I made for a Mexican dinner party which worked really well.

I cut my cheese into little bricks to make these easier to wrap.  The down side of that is the cheese doesn't melt all the way through once they're fried.

Great flavor!  My family loved them.  We did have a problem though with them opening up and the filling draining out.  I  was thinkg maybe the oil was too hot? We followed the directions to seal them but they still burst open.

Good base recipe but I felt it needed more flavor and for the work envolved. I added 1 tsp garlic powder & 1 tsp onion powder, 1 can diced green chilies as well as 1/4 jar of jalepeno's - which I diced small. More Jalepeno's = Hotter so add to your taste.

Loved this recipe! I did a combo of mexican seasoned ground turkey along with the cheese. Makes a wonderful appy served along with sour cream and a good guac. Thanks so much Karen!
