I gotta tell ya...all I wanted was some ribs. I've never made them before so I thought I'd give this a try. All was going well. I had them in the oven all rubbed up. Smelling good! Then it came time to check them. I pulled them out of the oven and, unbeknownst to me, a hole had appeared in the foil and it dumped hot chili powder lava all over my wrist. It hurt so dang much that I threw the ribs up on the counter and juices went all over my tile floor. I yelled a bit, and my dog come running in and started licking it up. I went to shoo him away and slipped and fell on my rump and hurt my knee. I yelled some more and my mother came in to see what the ruckus was and slipped and fell right next to me. When she did, her foot came up kicked me in my nose. Now I'm bleeding all over the dang place. My dogs barking, my mom's freaking out. I'm moaning in pain. When it was all said and done, I ended up with a bandage on my wrist, a swollen knee and two black eyes. And to boot, my dog has irritable bowel syndrome from all that chili powder juice he licked up. All I wanted was some dang ribs!

Soooo....when I finally got a chance to eat these things, they were ok. If you like, and I mean really like chili powder then these ribs are for you. If not, you won't care much for them. The rub is strong and overtakes the flavor of the meat. Just my opinion. But then again, I couldn't breath when I was eating them. Maybe that impaired my judgment a bit. ;)

This is a 10 star recipe - the best & easiest method to make ribs.  As indicated - use your favorite dry rub and your favorite BBQ sauce but use this low and slow method.  For make ahead 'ready to BBQ Ribs' I usually coat the ribs in the dry rub and wrap tightly and let sit in the refrigerator over night.   Bake at 250 for at LEAST 2 hours - sometimes they take longer.  Then I let them cool in the package - drain the juices out of the package and  store in the refrigerator until we are ready to grill.   Finishing them on the grill, using indirect heat is so easy and there is virtually no clean up other than to  wipe your chops and toss the bones.   Enjoy!

I do a few things differently. Most important is to get the membrane off the back of the ribs instead of just pricking them . Bone side up, make a shallow slice mid way through the rack, then using a paper towel, lift and pull the membrane off the rib bone, it generally comes off easily. Makes a huge difference! I also use my own dry rub mix but that's personal preference. to get them crispy, I throw them on the grill after baking 2.5 hours. when I'm making them for a crowd, I'll bake them in the morning, open the foil and slather on BBQ sauce, then rewrap the foil and ket them rest all day until it's time to throw them on the grill. This way I can enjoy my guests and still serve great ribs!
If it's a rainy day, I'll put them under the broiler for about 10-15 minutes instead of grilling, we like our ribs moist with the outside crispy and not so dripping with sauce.  
On the positive, this is a good recipe but don't be afraid to adjust the seasoning to your liking. We don't use white sugar at all, the dark sugar adds to the caramelization of the finished ribs and we use a lot less salt. Low and slow is the way way to go when it comes to finger licking, fall off the bone ribs! Enjoy!!

Finger lickin' good!  The key to "fall-off the bones" tender ribs is in the cooking method - low and slow is the way to go and this method is perfect for anytime you want ribs or if it happens to be raining and you can't grill.  And, as Chef John states this works with any dry rub and bbq sauce. So, you can use your favorite combination or get creative -either way you're in for a treat!  I used the rub in the recipe, but played with it a bit to use what I had on hand.  I cut the recipe in half because we had a small rack of baby back ribs and since I didn't have dried chipolte pepper I subbed garlic powder instead.  For the bbq sauce I opted for KC Masterpiece.  We finished these on the grill over low heat basting just as the recipe states for the last 20 minutes. This was so simple and so delicious - perfect with a side of coleslaw and cornbread!

I made this yesterday wowie was it ever good!  I didn't have "ancho" chile powder so I used regular chile powder in its place.  Also didn't have chipotle pepper.  I added some garlic powder.  The meat was so tender I actually couldn't cut through it...fell right off the bone!  Overall this will be my GO TO recipe for ribs!  Thanks Chef John!

Absolutely the best oven baked BBQ rib recipe I have ever tried !!! I''ve been on the hunt for a really good oven baked rib recipe, and most have fallen short of my expectations.  Cooking times are spot on, and the ribs are fall-off-the-bone tender!This one is a keeper. You won't be disappointed! Thanks Chef John! I'll definitely be trying other recipes of yours!

This recipe provided the method to my goal: ribs that were tender, but didn't fall off the bone (I wanted some chewiness and being able to pick up the ribs and eat them). I didn't use the rub here, but another one I had, but followed the cooking process for the first two hours. Then I put them on the grill, watched them carefully, turning and basting so they wouldn't burn, for about 45 minutes. They were perfect! I cooked three racks at once, and didn't have to increase the cooking times or anything. I will do this recipe again!

This recipe will give you good tender ribs.  With that said, there is nothing special about the recipe itself.  Like Chef John says, you can really season it with anything you want. All I had on hand was the white and brown sugars, plain chili powder and salt and pepper.  I did add some bbq seasoning to it to add extra flavor sicne I did not have those other seasonings.  The main thing to this recipe is the foil cooking method because I use this method with other meats (they always come out tender).  Also, I used pork spare ribs instead and they still came out tender just had to cook an additional 30 minutes.  By pork already being salty, I found that 1/4 cup salt was too much.  Next time, I'll cut down to maybe 2 or 3 tablespoons.  I'll also add more brown sugar... they weren't quiet sweet enough to me but still good.

These ribs were awesome!  I was looking for a great oven baked baby back rib recipe an this one was on the  money.  I added liquid smoke when I added the bbq sauce.  They were very moist and fall-apart tender.  I also let them marinate in the rub overnight in foil before baking.

Like most of the reviewers here, I also modified a couple of things...  For some reason, I can't just follow a recipe as is, lol.  First, I chose to use my own creation for a rub:  3 TBSP salt, 1 TBSP each of black pepper and garlic powder, 2 TBSP of brown sugar, and 1/2 tsp each of cumin and chipotle seasoning.  Cut the slab in half, rubbed each side of both halves with the rub, then WRAPPED IN PLASTIC WRAP and then foil.  Followed the first set of cooking instructions, baking in the oven at 250 for 2 hours, but wanted some of the char-grill flavor, so finished on a charcoal grill slathering with generous amounts of a mixture of Sweet Baby Ray's Original and Sweet and Spicy sauces, turning and brushing every 10 minutes or so for the last 50 minutes.  Gotta say, the turned out great!  Served with homemade potato salad and Ranch-Style beans.

Holy smokes. I can't believe my teenage son and I made these awesome, fall-off-the-bone ribs.  He was LITERALLY speechless.  I gave up making ribs years ago because, well, they weren't good.  These, however, are amazing.  All that basting really pays off once you taste them. My husband couldn't believe we made them ourselves. SCORE!

I loved this recipe!! The only suggestion I have is to peel the film from the back of the ribs, instead of simply pricking it. If you run a upside down spoon along one of the bones, it will slide beneath the film, allowing you to grab and pull it off!--I also sometimes use liquid smoke on the meat prior to the dry rub, just to give it a "grilled" taste.

Way too much hot stuff, and WAY, WAY TOO MUCH SALT!!!
I agree with the methods off cooking. It's great, and the ribs were tender. But the ingredients were too strong, and there was way, way too much salt.
I won't be using this recipe again.

Wonderful! Had to use what I had on hand and did modify slightly, blending a few recipes together (sorry, can never follow a recipe). Trimmed the back skin, cut the ribs in half. Lightly put on the rub the night before (should have quartered the amount of rub for 2 racks of ribs) minus the cumin, as my chili powder had it in it, and used much less salt, popped it in the fridge. Next day, sprayed the foil with oil and brushed the ribs with just a bit of the bbq sauce, sealed it tightly and into the oven at 250. Reserved the juice when that was done. Basted at 350, first with the bbq sauce, then with the reserved juice. First time doing babybacks, loved them!

I don't like my ribs done to the "fall off of the bone" stage and this recipe lives up to the way I like them. I've done this one several times now, first as written, then with about half of the salt (It would take me a year to use 1/4 cup of salt), then with the salt omitted all together. I've found that the pork ribs naturally seem to have all of the salt that I need as the "saltless version" is the one I like the most. LOVE these ribs when I can't get to the grill or in  the dead of winter

Good recipe.  However I found the 2 hours cooking time on low before turning up the heat to be at least 30 to 45 minutes too short.  I generally use St Louis cut spare ribs rather than baby back, don't know if that makes a difference.  And let me add, I prefer ribs with meat which pulls easily off the bone with a fork but still retains plenty of moisture. I find almost 3 hours low and slow cooking, followed by 30 to 45 minutes at 350 works better.  I baste with a simple vinegar and brown sugar based sauce.  I like the ribs in this recipe, but I just like mine a teeny bit better.  Of course don't most ribs cooks say the same thing?

Wow I love this recipe. I was looking for a good way to do ribs without having to use a grill in case of bad weather and now I think I'll be using this method for ribs as often as possible. The meat was literally falling off the bone and oh so good.

This has been the only cooking method for my ribs I have used in the last year, the meat falls off the bone and is always amazing! Everyone who eats them loves them. I did change the sauce a bit since we like a little more kick.

Used my own rub which had a lot less salt and chile powder and finished with apple butter bbq sauce. ALWAYS remove the membrane on the back by sliding a butter knife under to loosen it and then grab hold with a paper towel and pull off. Used on 4 racks of side (st louis style) ribs and this METHOD is the best I have found compared to boil and bake or slow grilling on crowded rib racks (as I can't fit 4 racks flat on my grill). I like being able to use 2 cookie sheets and doing 4 big racks for a family gathering. The foil protected my pans from the charring that happens to the sauce at the end. I needed the full 2 hours at 250 to start, rotating the pans after 1 hour, and then they needed the full last 50 mins at 350, basting with sauce every 10 and rotating pans for even cooking. I found they were perfect and tender at 200 degrees internal temp when probed multiple places, and no resistance on the probe going into the meat. Found the meat still chewy under 180 degrees so I gave it the full recipe time. These pulled cleanly and very easily off the bone but didn't fall apart,  which I like. I suspect baby backs would have overcooked as side ribs are much bigger. Taste test or temp test baby backs at least 45 mins earlier. If they're done at 195-200 degrees internal temp but not adequately  sauced, just sauce and broil for a few minutes to caramelize.  I like the slower saucing over 50 mins, but my side ribs needed it to get to a high enough temp to get tender enough and melt th

Before you read any further, cut WAY DOWN on the salt - perhaps just 2-3 tablespoons. Otherwise, this is an awesome recipe, even with substitutes such as regular chili powder and skipping the chipotle pepper (they don't have such delicious spices in Switzerland!). YUMMY!

I have made these twice: once followed the instructions exactly and cooked them in the oven.  The other time I did the final cooking on the bbq. Both times they were absolutely fantastic.  I did do the first cook in the oven for probably closer to three hours and they still held together beautifully on the barbeque.

I love this recipe, but I'm a BBQ kind of guy. So I cook these bone side down, and I add a 1/4 C to a 1/2 C of Apple Juice. I have a friend who like to add a fruit juice (think he uses Pinapple) into the BBQ sauce and mixes it well. From there I follow the recipe to the letter.
FYI, ALWAYS REMOVE THE MEMBRANE. The membrane does not allow seasoning to pass through, and can be tough and chewy in the bite.

Used my own rub and homemade BBQ sauce but the cooking method alone is worth 5 stars.  Super easy, super easy clean up too.  The meat was juicy, tender and stayed together when ribs were cut but not tough at all.  I didn't want "fall off the bone", I want to bite into that sucker, and I was able to!  I don't make ribs often, honestly I think that they are quite expensive for the amount of meat to bone ratio, but as I got a 2 1/2 pound rack on sale I couldn't resist the treat.  This is the ONLY way I'll cook ribs in the future.  Thanks!!

Have made this several times.  I cut back on the peppers because I can't stand the heat, otherwise I stick to recipe except I remove the membrane.  It always comes out great and everyone I serve loves it.  I always wanted to make my own ribs because I don't care for most of the restaurant sauces and they all think BBQ has to burn your mouth.  I use my husband's recipe for the sauce which is mild and a little sweet.  Add some potato(baked or mashed), maybe corn on the cob and coleslaw or steamed broccoli and be ready to unbutton your pants because you will not be able to put it down.

Great recipe, worked perfect.

The above ingredients for the rub mix produces quite a bit.  I was able to coat 3 full racks of baby backs with only half of the amount made.  I just saved the rest for the next batch.

Note: If you have a hearty flavorful BBQ sauce, I would recommend going "light" on the rub, otherwise it will be too salty.

for extra good ribs add a little less then 1/4 cup  DR PEPPER in to the foil before baking. The acid in the soda helps break down the meat making the ribs so yummy

I had to eliminate the chili seasonings & half the black pepper because my husband can't handle the spicy stuff, but still a great rub and cooking technique.  For summer, we put the ribs on the grill for the last 30 minutes or so that you're basting w/the bbq sauce...YUM!!

1st rub:  DON'T use the amounts given for just 1 rack.  The proportions given are for making a large batch to keep on hand.  Just dust the rack with a few handfuls.
2nd:   cook time is too short for 'fall off the bone', should be minimum 4 hours for 1 rack, or at 200F 6 hours (my preference).
I WOULD STRONGLY RECOMMEND A CORRECTION TO NOTE THAT NOT ALL THE RUB IS TO BE USED!

The cook time was spot on for BABY BACK RIBS, and YES THERE IS A DIFFERENCE IN TYPES OF RIBS! The rub was good too, but I will scale the salt and sugar down next time. I also rub liquid smoke all over the ribs prior to rubbing in the rib rub for a nice smokey flavor. It also helps the rub to adhere. YUM!!

I made these on the 4th of July. I took a chance and made 4 racks of ribs...2 pork, and 2 beef racks.  I'd never made beef ribs before, so I cooked them exactly like the pork ones.  Followed recipe exactly...used Famous Dave's rib rub as the dry rub.  Best ribs I've ever made, and guests said they were tastier than any restaurant or smokehouse they had been to!!  Thank you Chef John.

This recipe is a bit time consuming but they are well worth the extra effort.  My husband is pretty picky when it comes to ribs but he said they are the best ribs he's ever had.  We both highly recommend using this recipe.

These ribs are absolutely wonderful.  I took them to a potluck and not 1 rib was left.  Received lots of compliments and gave the recipe to several folks attending.  I would highly recommend using the Creole Seasoning recipe that is with the Oven Baked Jambalaya as your seasoning.  I did and it's wonderful.  I will try the rub mentioned in this recipe as well. Note: is did add some of the items in the rib rub to the Jambalaya seasoning like dry mustard.

I followed the cooking directions for the ribs but used my own scratch made rub mix and BBQ sauce. They turned out awesome for oven-baked ribs. Definitely a great way to cook ribs indoors minus the grill and when the weather is cold or inclement.

I have never made ribs in the oven before (only slow cooker or boiled and grilled). This is THE method you want to use, even if you don't use this rub recipe, the method is flawless.

I followed to recipe almost exactly for the rub, and the ribs were salty, sweet, a bit spicy... DELICIOUS. I just used a mix of BBQ sauces that we had in the fridge for the sauce. Again, worked great. 

Everyone loved them and I will be using this method and rub inspired by this recipe from now on. Just need to find my perfect BBQ sauce to go with it. A real keeper.

This recipe was outstanding!! The only things I would change is to remove the membrane first and cook for 2 1/2 to 3 hours if you want them to fall off the bone. The rub was a little spicy for my husband and daughter but I loved it. I will make these again!!!

Great recipe! I have made pork ribs with this recipe twice already. I changed rub a little (add whatever spices I had) and like someone mentioned, I applied dry rubs and put ribs in zip lock bags, marinated for about 6 hours. I planned to cook on grill (after slow cooking 2 hours) but it rained so cooked in oven. Perfect!! I think next time I will definitely cook on grill.

Simply the BEST RIBS EVER! What's more, they look as good as they taste.  Please give this one a try and alter nothing.  It is perfection.

Followed the directions except for the spice rub. Used Masterpiece Sweet Honey rub. Ribs were tender but not fall-off the bone. I don't like sloppy, super tenderized ribs so these ribs were great.  If you want a more tender end-product up the initial temperature to 275 degrees. Highly recommend!!

It's pretty good, but sometimes they can be a little bit salty. You've got to be extreme careful with the timing or else some of the ribs will melt with the foil.

These were great.  My usual procedure with ribs is to remove the membrane on the back side of the ribs.  I cooked for 3 hrs at 250 instead of the two-step procedure shown here.  The meat fell right off the bone.  I finished them off with barbecue sauce for 15 min at 350 deg.  Will be making them again.

Used my own rub, so can't comment on that. But the cooking method is fine. It's not fall off the bone, but it's nice and tender. Would recommend.

This recipe is very easy and the ribs turn out melt-in-your-mouth tender!  I have to admit, while I've made this recipe a few times now, I never use the same ingredients for the dry rub.  I try to stick close, though.  These are the best ribs I've ever made.

I have made these at least 6 times now. Just the best!! I've even done two racks at a time. The only thing I change a little is the last 50 minutes. I baste only about 2 or 3 times. You could do every 10 minutes as the recipe says too but I get lazy. They still turn out fall off the bone tender. So good! I use a BBQ sauce recipe from this site too.

I used my own rub but followed the directions.   I had to leave  them in the foil for an additional 45 minutes to get them to the fall of the bone status but love this method for ribs in the oven.

It's not so much the ingredients, but the technique in making it. I use Famous Dave's dry rub and whatever BBQ sauce I have on hand. It is sooo good, and so easy to do.

Love this recipe, and really love the rub on the ribs. I also peel the entire membrane off the back of the ribs, instead of just pricking it with a knife.  After making this once, I had issues sealing up the ribs tight enough in the tinfoil in the oven, so after rubbing the ribs down, I put them in the slow cooker for three hours with a tight lid, then followed the recipe from there.  The meat is so flavorful and tender, but not so tender they just slide off the bone.  Perfect!

This is a terrific recipe and followed it accurately. Not sure I would make any changes other than to maybe slightly change the amount of chilli  powder for guests who do not like spicy-however it was just perfect for us.

I used this recipe last night, and altered a few minor things.  I cut the rack of ribs in half to make it more manageable, and to be able to use two different sauces.  I used the remains of a rub I had previously put together for another recipe.  My oven seems to run a little cool compared to most, so I bumped the initial temperature to 275 and increased the bake time to 2.5 hours.  Then I increased the five saucing intervals to 12 minutes each at 350 after the first 10 minute interval didn't quite cook down the sauce to the point I desired where I felt it was ready for another saucing!  Cutting them into individual ribs before serving seems like a very minor detail, but it did make serving a lot simpler and cleaner.  Fall-off-the-bone, lip-smacking good!!  This will now be the go-to rib recipe in the recipe box!

I've made this four times now and haven't been able to duplicate the same results each time.  Here's what I've learned so far.  Be sure to start with a rack of ribs similar in size and length as the one in the video, at least 3.5 to 4.0 pounds of meat.  If your rack is smaller than 3.5 pounds, then the initial 2 hours in the oven will be too long.  I was able to get the same results as Chef John with a 3.5 pound rack, but I found the meat was already falling off the bone at the end of the 2 hours. Therefore, I followed with only 2 10-min. sauce sessions.  The recipe calls for 4 more times of brushing on the sauce, back in the oven for 10 minutes, etc. so that adds potentially another 40 minutes of baking. With a smaller rack of ribs there is the potential to overbake during the sauce sessions, and then they do in fact get dried out.  So, be careful to start with the proper size rack of ribs.  If you want to use a smaller rack of ribs, then reduce the initial bake time accordingly and be aware of the meat drying out too much during the sauce sessions.

I used this recipe for my first attempt at making ribs, and it was fantastic. Had a nice, lingering light burn thanks to the dry rub. I used a Harris Teeter sauce that is very similar to Sticky Fingers sauce.

I have cooked a lot of babyback ribs and this is the best method I have found. They come out very tender but not sloppy, and full of flavor. I used Spade L seasoning for pork from Albertsons stores. Mild but delicious.

I did as others suggested and removed the white membrane off the back. We don't like our ribs too spicy/hot, so I left out the peppers and added garlic powder. I cooked for a total of 3.5 hours, because we like falling off the bone ribs. These are delicious.

Loved using this process to produce the juiciest ribs ever!! I used Cajun seasoning as my rub and Sweet Baby Ray's honey barbecue sauce! It was divine and the husband thought they were the best ribs he's ever tasted! Thanks!!

Used Memphis bbq rub from Savory Spice Shop and The Shed sauce. Cooking method is spot on. Tired of the bbq already and it's not even Memorial Day yet. :(

First time making ribs, and I was nervous to say the least but my husband and I loved these ribs! Followed recipe to a "T" and they came out perfect, longer the rub is on the ribs, better the flavor (bit of common sense). I did not remove the membrane as others have suggested and they turned out great for us.  Thank you Chef John for your recipe and video tutorial.

If I only had one word to describe it, it would be delicious!  I used a mesquite seasoning I bought from Costco because I didn't have everything on hand and it came out so good!  The other thing I did different was to pull the membrane off of the back of the rack.  This helps in allowing the seasoning and bbq sauce to really penetrate from both sides

This is the only way I have ever made ribs and it is by far the BEST! My family loves it and leftovers are never a problem. :-) Thank you Chef John for such an easy recipe to follow and a laid-back style of cooking.

Great results -- with one caution (see below).  Cooking instructions are spot-on -- 2 hrs at low heat cooks the meat through tenderly without burning the sugars in the rub; and the last hour at higher heat in opened foil with meat side up develops a nice 'bark' without drying the meat. Mixing up your own rub gives opportunities to fine-tune flavors.
Now the ONE caution -- in our experience, the quantities listed for rub ingredients yielded much more than we needed for a single ~2 lbs rack of baby back ribs, and doubling it (on another occasion, when we made two racks) gave us much, MUCH more than we needed.  We're saving the extra for next time -- but you can cut back when you mix your own.
So: five stars for instructions and results, would give less for inaccurate quantities.

This recipe is great.  I use a Grill Mates rub. The end result is tasty, tender, and fall of the bone ribs. Also, after taking out of oven, I cut up ribs a place on grill with additional BBQ sauce.  Yummy... Give it a try.

I used store bought BBQ sauce so didn't use any of the ingredients.  However, the baking method worked really well and the ribs came out very nice.

I made these ribs last night. I also had leftover rub which I saved for future use. They were fall of the bone and excellent. They literally fell off the bone when I picked them up to serve. They were a little spicy for my kids but next time I will just do less rub on their portion because the flavor was excellent. Will definitely make these again.

Fantastic!  so delicious and tender.  Wish I bought more ribs.  But then again, I would have over-eaten if there were more.  so tasty.  I don't need to look any further for a baby back rib recipe - this one is all I'll need.  A sure keeper.  Thanks Chef John for sharing your recipe!

I used a pre-made rub with hints of mesquite and brown sugar in it, and then also rubbed with brown sugar. For the sauce I used Sweet Baby Ray's.....they were amazing! First time making ribs, and my husband was not disappointed.

Finally!  A rib recipe where the ribs are very tender, but don't fall off the bone. I don't want to eat ribs with a knife and fork!  I did use a little Dr. Pepper in the foil packet, but these were absolutely delicious!  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Thanks Chef John, you nailed it!!  Ribs were incredible! The method is fail proof.  They were so delicious, everyone made me promise to make it again it soon. This is now our new Super Bowl tradition.  My notes for next time:  Made three racks for 6 people . Cut racks in half, used half amount of salt, added 1 tsp. garlic powder.

This is my go to baby back rib recipe (or more succinctly my method) for winter months. I use a different mix for the dry rub, as opposed to the one in Chef John's recipe, but the ribs always come out (with very little effort I might add) with just the right flavor and chew.

My husband actually decided to make Baby Back Ribs -- and I found this recipe for him.  He watched Chef John's video a couple times and went for it  .... and they came out wonderful -- except a bit spicy for me (we always order the mild ones at a restaurant).  My husband was pleased and will probably make them again -- but with a bit less "heat"!

I love this recipe, low and slow is the way to go. I prefer
 St. Louis spare ribs. I like the way the sauce gets "lacquered" on at the end. I even cook my ribs this way in the summer.

I didn't have all the ingredients but it was delicious. I've made it twice so far. My younger son said "The first time I had this it made me feel like I'd eat ribs forever!"  It was a hit at our family dinner.  I plan to continue making it(with all the ingredients :) over and over again!

I have done ribs a lot of different ways. This one is a fail safe. If you have never made ribs before, try this method. I use my own run, but do everything else the same. They turn out very good. Chef John is genius.

I made these last Christmas and will be making again this Christmas. Everyone loved them. I just used a pork rub that said for low and slow cooking and I added brown sugar to the rub.  I put the rub on, wrapped in foil and let set in the frig over night. The best ribs ever.

I use my own dry rub, but follow the directions otherwise.  These consistenly turn out the best.  It'll be the only method I use for ribs.

Will definitely use this recipe again.  I cooked mine a little longer as I could see from the video that they were not as tender as we like them.  A keeper for sure!

I got my baseline from this recipe.  I used my own blend of seasonings.  I like the long slow cook method in the oven wrapped in foil.  I have a couple of people undergoing some dental work so eat off the bone would not work right now.  So I just cooked longer until opening the foil and they were fall off the bone perfect.

Ive seen some comments on the chilli recipe you dont have to use his recipe. But by far this is the best way ive seen without using a grill or a smoker for good ribs, i used a brown sugar based rub with a sweet heat bbq sauce worked out great!

I use this recipe every time and it turns out perfect every time! Meat falls right off the bone. I use a meat thermometer At the end and pull them out right when it reaches temp and let them rest on the counter.

Make sure to peel off the membrane on the rib side before seasoning and cooking. Low and slow is the key. Used my own seasoning and sauce. Turned out great. Draining off the drippings and 10 minute increments of basting and finishing made the difference. Best ribs ever. Now the crew expects them every weekend.

As many other commenters, I made this with some modifications. First, I found pre-seasoned St. Louis style pork ribs on sale at Costco ($2.49/lb) so I did not use the rub recipe. Then, I mis-read the recipe (oops!) and added some barbecue sauce at the beginning instead of when I unwrapped the ribs after 2 hours. By the way, many thanks for sharing so amusingly to the reviewer who spilled the juice on himself. I was very careful in opening the foil after the first 2 hours and drained the juices into the sink without spilling it or getting them on myself.

My preferred barbecue sauce is Bullseye Original. It tastes the way I think barbecue sauce should taste. But that is my opinion which is like like noses; most people have one. Anyway, I followed the cooking time suggested by the recipe: 2 hours at 250 degrees sealed in heavy duty aluminum foil followed by 50 minutes open at 350 degrees, basting every 10 minutes. Even though the ribs were St. Louis style rather than baby back ribs, this was enough time to cook them the way I like them: not falling off the bone but cooked through and chewy. If you want your St. Louis style ribs to fall off the bone I suggest you extend the 2 hour sealed portion of the cooking time.

Not fall off the bone tender but tender just the same. Outstanding flavor. If you want fall off the bone give them an extra 15 - 20 minutes before letting them cool.

I didn’t feel that these ribs were tender enough. They tasted fine but they were a bit tough, definitely not fall-off-the-bone.

These were delicious! I loved the heat level, but my 7 y.o. daughters said it was too spicy, so the only thing I might change is the amount of chili powder in the dry rub. I had already halved the amount of cayenne. They come out nice and tender, and then I always finish them off with Williamson Brothers bbq sauce. Yummy!!

There was so much rub that it was was gritty when you ate it. I'm not sure why anyone would put this much rub on anything other than a pork shoulder with the intent of making pulled pork. 

Other than that, it was cooked very nicely.

Next time I will try making half the amount of dry rub and less cayenne and ancho chili powder. Great taste but a little too spicy for me. I will definately make them again!

Very very good!  The painted on bbq sauce in the last hour of cooking really seals the deal.  I loved the flavor of the Ancho chili in the rub.  The finished ribs were succulent,  sweet & spicy  but not overly so. Very easy to prepare!

I have made this at least two times. It is easy to make and so delicious. I followed the recipe first time. Second time all I could find in storage was teryiaki sauce. That was really good too. I keep this recipe in my "favorites" so I can get to it quickly. I intend on making it quite frequently. I need to add that I am not a fan of ribs, but can not resist eating these.

Family approved, therefore will remake.
Only 3 tweaks: no ancho chile powder, 1 tsp cumin, and no chipotle.  This recipe is so good!  I'll have to go out and get the ancho chile and chipotle powders to try, but not sure about the whole 1/2 cup thing.  I baked my 3.8 lb rack for 2.5 hours.

Absolutely delicious and very easy, albeit a little time consuming for the last 50 minutes.  The results were worth the time, though.  I have not enjoyed such tender pork in a long time.

Followed the recipe. Only change I would make - because we don’t like overly saucy things- is I would baste with bbq sauce only twice and probably increase cooking time for 15ish minutes after each baste.

BEST ribs EVER! I love all the tips, tricks and easy to follow instructions. I will also try this on the smoker grill but excited to have been able to make ribs indoors during the winter that tasted like they were made on a grill! Thanks so much!

I have made this a few times and it's always good. I love my grilled ribs and was surprised how well these turned out.  I followed the rub recipe the first time and it was great.  I like to experiment and tried other rubs and they were great also.  This is my go to recipe for cooking ribs when the weather is too nasty took grill outside.

Compared to many rib recipes, this was very simple. They tasted great! Very good! Two suggestions: 1) I’d cut the salt ingredient in half, there is a little too much suggested, 2) for one rack of ribs, the amount of rub you end up with is 3 times what you need to thoroughly coat a rack. At these amounts of ingredients you could easily cover three racks or more.

Amazing.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's original BBQ sauce and it matched beautifully.  I also added some Garlic power and Onion power to the rub.

Surprised at how good they were. Too much chili powder and chipotle for me. Would add roasted garlic powder and liquid smoke. But I will make them again with this recipe, along with my mods.  Chef John knows what he's doing.

Was delicious and looked restaurant made! Didn’t have all pepper spices on hand, but had enough to make a great tasting rub. Will definitely make again since my husband was out of town when I made them.

I could tell from the flavor it would have been delicious if I had known the difference between a rack and a slab.  LOL.  Waaaay too salty for two slabs of rib.  Probably perfect for one rack(which is a minimum of 8 slabs of ribs).

These are the next best thing you are going to find to the barbeque!  I always spread my dry rub on, you can change up rub ingredients, anything goes really, and put them in the fridge for a couple of hours.  Then I make my homemade barbeque sauce while these are in the oven.  Do not omit the layering of the sauce, absolutely yummy!

I used my own rub, baked the ribs in an oven bag for 2 1/2 hours & then baked them open with B BQ sauce for about 1/2 hour. They were tender & the sauce stayed on the ribs. Will make these again.

Did two racks with this recipe, one with barbecue rub and sauce, and the other I did with a Jamaican Jerk sauce/marinade (my barber said to try it on baby back ribs).  I cut the ribs into about 5 bone sections.  I did 250°F  for 2 1/2 hours because the ribs were right out of the refrigerator.  There will be a lot of liquid to drain, so be prepared.  The basting every 10 minutes helped with determining doneness.  The ribs on both sets fell off the bone.  Good luck.

Have made these a couple of times over the last few months. We LOVE them!! Absolutely the best ribs we've ever eaten!! Made slight changes on dry rub, just simply because I didn't have everything the recipe called for, so I just kinda went with what I thought would be good and used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce and WOW!!!!! Making them again today too.

Made the rub a little simpler as I didn't have all the ingredients but the same idea.  Did leave it in the refrigerator for a few hours after applying the rub.  Delicious and very tender.

The questions is “will you make again?”, absolutely! Like other reviewers have posted you can season these anyway you like, we used our favorite dry rub followed by favorite bbq sauce... I’m rating this recipe 5 stars for its method of cooking. It yielded moist ribs with a wonderful coating of bbq sauce that stuck to the ribs. I often turn to Allrecipes not only for a new recipe to try but also a method in which to cook an existing one i.e...length of time in oven, oven temp used or even compare list of ingredients other cooks use for same recipe. Allrecipes is a great resource and I thank all the great cooks who contribute!

I used the Rub with Love brand steak rub all over front and back and Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory and Brown Sugar BBQ sauce.  Did 4 coats of sauce (one every 10 minutes) after the initial 2 hour cooking time with the sauce. I punctured the back side of the ribs all through before cooking  as directed and wrapped in heavy foil as directed.   Husband said it reminded him of his favorite BBQ from his childhood in Georgia.

This recipe uses TOO MUCH SEASONING... Especially SALT. I thought that 1/4 cup of salt was a typo, so I used half that amount and was still skeptical. For good reason, because I thought I was going to shrivel up and die like a snail from eating these salty ribs! Next time I will trust my gut and use my own judgment on measurements rather than follow a recipe. The only thing this recipe is good for is the proper cook time. Will never use this recipe again.

Amazing! The rub is so good you hardly need any barbecue sauce. I halved the amount of rub and it was still plenty. So tender and delicious!

Two hours at low temp caused ribs to release all moisture.  Result:  dry stringy ribs with okay flavor thanks mostly to Sweet Baby Rae.

It's tasty. Maybe I might put some spicier pepper/spices or use some of those ingredients to crispy-fry/deep-fry them (maybe not all of them but some).

Let me start by saying that I did not use the ingredients in this recipe as directed. I actually used a Weber smoke rub made for pork but I followed the instructions perfectly and they came out AMAZING!!! I used Heinz Sweet and Smoky BBQ sauce on top and again, TERRIFIC!!! I used pork ribs NOT a rack of ribs.

I have made this recipe about a dozen times and have always had perfect fall-off-the-bone ribs. A few tweaks - I use all brown sugar and not quite as much chile powder. I also do not put barbecue sauce on the actual ribs - 2 family members don't like sauce, but they do love the dry rub in this recipe.  The ribs are sweet, smoky and delicious all on their own!

Maybe my rack of ribs was smaller but this was way too much rub. I used about 3/4 of it and it was still too much. Also, I think there's too much salt in the recipe. The ribs did cook really well though, so I'll make this again and adjust the measurements.

This is a very good rib recipe! I made it exactly as it’s written and I’ll make it again. The leftovers never tasted “leftover”. I don’t know if that was due to being pork or if it was the cooking and seasoning method, but definitely a plus as far as I’m concerned.

Fantastic!  I read other reviews and some say it was too spicy - I cut back on the  Chili Powder, and pepper and decreased the salt to about 1/8 Cup and removed the membrane (my preference)  I used to make in my pressure cooker/instapot but I prefer this method .  Very very very good and so easy!  Thank you Chef John!

I'll make it again but with half the amount of spices recommended, possibly even less. This was a little too spicy so I will also reduce the amount of chili powder and pepper.

The ribs were delish. I watched the video and followed the recipe as written with exception of using a bottled BBQ sauce. Definitely would make again. Super Bowl success.

Not only did I make it, I made it five times already! Our local Acme supermarket runs specials on ribs (buy one get three) so  it’s been a ribalicious winter for us... especially on Sundays.
The recipe is easy to follow and the ribs are just fantastic for not having been cooked outside. Super Bowl Sunday is tommorow and we’re having Chef John’s Shrimp Cocktail and Chef John’s Baked BBQ Ribs... only I’m passing them of as Chef Mathew’s... hehehe!

I will definitely be making these ribs again.  The rub was the perfect level of spicy with our honey barbecue sauce.  They were easy enough to make, and we manage to have everything at the local grocery store here Cupecoy, Sint Maarten.

My Ribs turned out AMAZING and YES I made some changes as I realized I didn't have BBQ sauce.  I did not wrap them in foil, rather I placed them in a baking dish and put foil over top.
My dry rub consisted of Turmeric (instead of cumin) with Salt, Pepper, Cayenne, Garlic Powder, Onion Powder and Sugar.  I made my own BBQ saude with Ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, Salt, Pepper, Dark Brown Sugar and Brown Mustard with a couple shakes of cayenne pepper.  I had never made Ribs in the oven EVER and this recipe was failsafe.  They tasted like I'd get them in a restaurant, just WONDERFUL

Exactly like others have stated. It’s not exactly what kind of seasoning you use , it’s the method. Use the seasoning you are comfortable with. Taste the seasoning before you apply it in case you need to make changes. Time and temp is spot on. Baste with your favorite Bbq sauce and enjoy! So easy to make a caveman can do it!

Making these ribs right now, so far I am impressed. The ribs bent easily in middle and now are getting the bbq sauce. I like this recipe, it allows me to cook good ribs inside when I don't feel like running smoker. If you want a smoked rib taste look for smoked paprika or use liquid smoke cautiously.

This recipe was fine but I'm not sure what the dry rub really brought to the overall flavor of the dish and unless I did something wrong it was almost unbearable salty. A quarter cup of salt is a LOT and it came through in the final product. The sauce - from a bottle - helped balance it out and I like salty foods but half my family couldn't eat this as the salt was overpowering. I'll probably make it again but cut the salt way down.

Five Star, for sure.
I've cooked pork baby back ribs in the oven and out back on my Weber grill.
Never have baby backs tasted better, IMO, until I tried this recipe.
Perfect !

I admittedly am among those who did my own rub and sauce. My dad has a combo that he uses that I LOVE, but he has a smoker and smokes his ribs.  I can't do that--maybe someday, one can wish--so instead I used this cooking method.

Absolutely spot on. Well cooked, still moist and fantastic. Comes off the bone without falling to pieces.  I'm using again today to make a slightly different more asian inspired rack of ribs, but I'm excited! 

Thanks lots!

My husband loved them.  He said that this recipe is better than  the ribs at his favorite BBQ joint. I found the sauce a little thick  on them and if cooking for myself would only coat them about half as much.

Personally it was delicious but all other family members found it too spicy hot and one wouldn’t eat them at all. So if heat sensitive cut back on the chili or chipotle seasonings. If you like hot and spicy you’ll love this recipe.

Had a rainy day and I did not feel like holding an umbrella and tending to ribs at the same time. 

Followed this recipe. The only thing I would change is what to do with the membrane on the back. I am something of a stickler for removing it. It makes all the difference in the world. It was some good comfort food for my wife and sister-in-law.

Everyone loved this recipe!!! I usually use emeril a essence but I was out!!!  I didn’t have ancho chili powder just used regular and I didn’t have ground chipotle pepper powder so I just skipped it!! 250 for 5 hours and then threw the bbq sauce on and put on the grill for a few minutes!!! Definitely a keeper!!!

This rib recipe never disappoints!  I've made this several times and the ribs are always tender and flavorful. If you don't have all of the rub ingredients you can certainly make your own. The only change I've made after following the recipe as is, is to brush with sauce twice instead of  4  times - I think it depends on the sauce.

I’m trying to find the last  recipe I used blew this one away . The other method had the ribs  wrapped in BBQ sauce the whole cook which resulted in much more tender meat. These weren’t terrible , just not great. Another thing , I think the recipe is written wrong on the rub ,, there’s no way you want to put 1/4 salt in the rub !

I made my ribs tonight using the same method, however, I changed some of the ingredients. I didn't have any dry mustard nor cumin..so I do without. I added garlic and onion powder.  They came out great!!

I've been using this recipe for about 5 years and I love it.  I follow it as it is written.  I make up a batch of the rub and keep it in a sealed container and use it all summer and winter.  I use it on all types of ribs not just baby back.  The ribs always come out so tasty.  thanks again Chef John for a wonderful recipe!

I’ve made this recipe several times and it never disappoints! The ribs fall off the bone and taste amazing. I usually broil them for a few minutes before taking them out of the oven.

I consider myself a good cook but Ive never felt accomplished cooking ribs until today. Chef John's ribs are the best my family has ever eaten. My husband considers himself a rib connoisseur and hasnt stopped raving about these ribs. He said, "dont change a thing!" Best ribs ever!!

I've made these ribs several times.  They are good.  We don't finish them nearly as long as the recipe says.  another 20 minutes on either the BBQ or in the oven at 350F is usually enough, and we only brush our favorite honey garlic BBQ sauce on the meat side of the ribs lightly for 10 minutes, then another light brush of sauce for another 10 minutes.  The ribs are juicy, tender and not overdone this way!  Good recipe for sure!!!

The first time I made this recipe, I followed it to a T, but it was too spicy for me.  I have since modified it to half the salt, and leave out the cayenne pepper and the chipotle pepper.  This is now my go-to rib rub. I sprinkle this on my cooked chicken wings, and I always have some on-hand.
The timing for cooking is right on with my oven.

The ribs were just OK. Definitely not fall off the bone tender but kinda tough. Plenty of sauce which give it 3 stars

It was good. I think next time I'll finish it with three 10 minute cooks not 5. Some parts came out a little dry. But still good.

We tried this and was completely surprised at the ease of the recipe and the results of the ribs. The ribs were tender and the flavor was fantastic.  I will definitely be making lots of these ribs.  (EDITED/UPDATED) I have used this recipe as a guide and made ribs several times with different rubs and sauces, or no sauce at all. Each time the ribs have been excellent and very satisfying.

My husband said they were the best ribs he has ever had! Falling off the bone and delicious.  I didn’t have mustard powder so I rubbed a small amount of yellow mustard on the ribs before adding the spice rub.

Here is my take on these babies.
If you have the time and means, fire up the outdoor grill when they are almost done. Place the ribs over HIGH heat for about 2-3 minutes per side. This sears the meat and seals in the flavor and also gives you a slight char adding even more flavor! Serve with your favorite BBQ sauce on the side for dipping (I warm mine slightly) and enjoy. This also makes any leftovers less messy to handle.

didn't follow the dry rub exactly because it was last minute but followed all other directions, adding a hi broil for a few minutes at the end. Turned out superb!  Can't wait to make them again and be better prepared!  Will make a spicy Cole slaw to pair with it!

I was so excited to try this recipe.   Seemed simple.  I am not the best cook so I am always looking for easy successful recipes and the reviews suggested this would do.  The rub was great.  Let it "marinate" overnight sealed in foil.  Cooked in oven for 2.5 hours and the ribs were still very tough and hard to cut.  Wasn't sure if it was my ribs or if they needed to cook longer.  Put them on the grill for 20 minutes.  They tasted great but were tough and dry and nowhere near fall off the bone.   Perhaps they could have cooked another hour or so in the oven likely.  I will try again and cook them 3-4 hours in the oven before raising the temp or grilling.

Sorry Chef John, I can only give this recipe a 4. That's a first for me with your recipes... I made the mistake of making the recipe without reading the reviews  first, as I normally do.  There is way too much salt in the rub, and I used 2 tablespoons, not  a 1/4 cup as called for! I'll use my own  salt-free concoction for the rub next time. There will be a next time because the low and slow baking & basting method makes for truly tender ribs, that as Chef John says,  come clean off the bone to the bite. Thank you for this fool proof  'oven-baked' method for those of us who live where outdoor BBQ season seems to be getting shorter and shorter.

Baked mine in foil at 200 degrees for 3 hours then increased to 350 for the last hour during basting of BBQ sauce.   Would definitely make again.  Very tender ribs.  Used too much of the rub but will cut back on that next time.  Very easy way to make excellent ribs.  Thanks for the recipe

Low and slow is the way to go. The only thing I do differently is to use a broiler pan with a rack and then cover the entire top of the pan with foil and seal by pinching around the edges. This way the fat from the meat drains into the pan instead of having the ribs stew in their own juices.  Then I uncover, sauce and broil on both sides.

So I was disappointed in this recipe. I measured all ingredients and the salt seemed like a lot, but this was my first dry rub experience and I should of just went with my better judgement, but I didn't. We aren't on a salt diet it's just the salt is not proportioned correctly with the other spices. That's my opinion, I will try spice rubs in the future, and adjust the salt accordingly ; )

This is an excellent recipe. The rub is a delicious combo of sweet and spicy. I followed the recipe but had to omit a couple of the spicy things since I didn’t have them. I doubled the recipe because I had two racks..love wrapping them in foil to bake...very easy and little mess! Can’t wait to try again!

This was way way way too hot for me.  I cut the spices in half and had to rinse off the spices before I added the barbecue sauce.  The ribs were super tender, falling off the bones but the hotness wasn't for me or my family.

I did not add any salt.  I did add 5 cloves of chopped garlic.  If you like to add heat add some red pepper flakes to BBQ sauce.  I did not cover the glass casserole dishes, (2). This recipe is very easy.  Oh I used light brown sugar,  made this recipe 2x . Pork riblets and babyback ribs. In this recipe you can add fresh dill, basil, cumin depending on your taste. Very simple base sauce recipe.

Made it for the Super Bowl, I received compliments,  since I couldn't find the ancho chile powder I used paprika and regular chile powder. I doubled the recipe for the seasoning since I had 3 slabs, however didn't used it all, I didn't want to put too much and make it too overpowering with it, next time I will put more. For the sauce I used "Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce".

I have made this 3 times and I will make it again.  I have used different rubs as well as the recipe rub, but the recipe rub is good and am using it today.  The ribs have always been fall off the bone tender. I used a supermarket bbq sauce that my family likes, but may make my own today.

Texture was amazing, very juicy and delicious. I followed the recipe's rub recipe and I love it. The recipe makes A LOT extra rub so I jarred it up. 1/4 of the dry rub recipe is enough for one use. Next time I might use thinner layers of BBQ sauce because the sauce layer ended up a bit too thick for me.

Followed the recipe  except I made only half the rub.  I'm glad I did, because it made so much, I still threw half of it away.  HUGE waste of spices.  Cooked the ribs as directed and they came out tender, but we did not like the flavor of the rub.  Maybe I used too much in my attempt to use all the rub I made?  I will not make this again.

I made two racks o' ribs (hungry boys in the house!) and left them in the oven longer (low and slow). I don't think you can go wrong if you have the oven very low - you can let them go and they won't dry out on that first go around.  Otherwise, I followed instructions to a tee on the prep work, rub (my secret is SMOKED PAPRIKA, though) and then in the glazing at the end. I serve with cornbread and homemade potato salad (made with a hint of sour cream). Quiet, happy, eating, boys......  LOL (A mom's paradise)

Instead of using 1/4 cup of white sugar I just used a 1/2 cup of brown sugar and I added in some liquid smoke for flavor.   I left the ribs in for 3 hours and then once out of the oven I cooked the BBQ sauce in on the stove top for 15/20 minutes.

I only used the instructions for temp and time.  I used Sonny's Sweet BBQ sauce because THAT is what BBQ should taste like, to me.  Whatever sauce you love sure makes it easier than making your own.  My husband is a trained chef and he said these ribs were EXACTLY how ribs are supposed to come out.  Tender and juicy! I had never made ribs before and thought it would be more trouble than they are worth.  I was wrong.  With my sauce and these directions, the only down side is that you can't have them spontaneously.  LOL We have these once every 2 weeks.  LOVE THEM!!!

I knew right from the beginning that the rub was going to be too strong (spicy) for me and the guests that were going to be eating the ribs. So I used a brush dipped in water to apply the dry rub. I used about a table spoon of rub on the back of the ribs and a table spoon on the front. All I can say is how everyone enjoyed them. The combination of chili powder, black pepper, chipotle pepper, cumin and brown sugar was amazing.  Not to mention the addition of homemade BBQ Sauce to finish them off. The only recommendation I would make, which I will follow next year would be to place the ribs (If doing three or more racks) would be to place the foil wrapped ribs in a disposable foil chaffing pan to collect all of the juices from the ribs as I used a jelly roll pan which was not deep enough to keep the juices from overflowing onto the oven bottom.

This is my  preferred way to cook a rack of BB ribs, en lieu of a smoker.     I use my own rub, and during the covered low-temp phase I use a bit of liquid smoke.  Its obviously not the same as real smoke but when oven baking I prefer it to just a dry rub by itself.

Giving 5 stars because it is great as written, though we preferred it (6 stars) using  the method as written with the exception of using my own rub of salt, pepper, McCormick's chipotle garlic, cayenne, paprika, onion powder, Italian seasoning and brown sugar (better caramelization  than with white sugar). PLUS I removed the membrane purely out of personal preference. I think the rub adheres better without it, some critics think the membrane holds in juice better.

Really good and very simple.   Ribs were very tender but didn't fall off the bone.  Really impressed with the barbecue sauce, basting in the oven every ten minutes  the last fifty minutes of baking,  tasted just like the grill.

My family loved the BBQ Baby Back Ribs. Very Delicious.

I doubled the recipe for over 5 lbs of baby back ribs and cooked it to recipe except for what I added/changed (see below). 

The only comment is that even though I only used 1/2 the amount of kosher salt, the ribs came out somewhat salty. I would use less salt next time.

The ribs came out with a nice crust and great flavor.

Except for the following:
- cut salt in 1/2 - used 1/4 cup of salt for double the recipe
- added Spanish sweet paprika (2 Teaspoons)
- added granulated garlic powder (2 Teaspoons).

I cooked my ribs for two hours at 250 and then for 50 minutes at 350, basting every ten minutes. My ribs came out tough. It took too much effort to chew.

I did not have ancho chile powder but used simple "chili powder" and also did not do the 2 tbsp. of freshly ground black pepper as after grinding 1 tbsp. my wrist was done. All else as per recipe and wow! When I took out of the oven, my daughter immediately exclaimed...oh no they are burnt! They did have a darker hue vs saucy ribs. But when I cut off a piece and saw the pink I was was relieved. When I popped that piece into my mouth....yum yum yum! So long Smokey Bones, there is a new gal in town this summer.

I call myself following this recipe to the T, however I really didn't like the outcome. I didn't like the taste of the rub, It was WAYYYY too salty for my taste. I guess I would reduce the salt amount and increase the sugar a lil bit so it could have more of a BBQ taste. I wouldn't try this recipe again...

The recipe for the rub is good for 3 racks, so save back 2/3 of it and use it the next time you make ribs!

I was raised in a household that boiled the ribs until they were cooked through and then smothered in BBQ sauce and seared on the grill. Last year I bought a smoker and turned my family on to the better taste but for Mother's Day I didn't have time to mess with it. Instead I used this method, only I substituted  a premade rub(Emeril's Rib Rub), and they were by far the best ribs we have ever had. Gonna make them again tonight.

I'll make this again - I have a lot of the rub left over.  It was pretty good.  The business of basting every ten minutes for the last 50 is onerous, so I quit after 4 bastings, and nobody complained.  Served with German potato salad and cole slaw.

Now the family's favorite way to cook ribs. So simple and succulent. The technique has become my go-to for other slabs of meat as well. If only there was a way of spicing, wrapping and slow-cooking meatloaf.

Excellent, tender as well.  Just used the oven, but might put on the grill a few minutes next time.  I used my own dry rub and cooked in foil as stated; added barbecue sauce after following directions to raise temp to 350 and basted every 10 minutes.  This is a keeper,  Thanks.

I followed the rub recipe with one mod. I only used a tablespoon of salt vice two the recipe calls for.  If I use it again, I'll leave out the chili powder too. I bought 2.5 lbs of grocery store baby-backs. Next time I'll get a rack from the butcher, who sells better quality meat. I applied the rub the day before cooking and put the ribs in a gallon Zip Lock over night. About an hour before oven time, I pulled the ribs out of the fridge to let them come to room temp. Per directions, I wrapped them foil and baked at 250 degrees for 2.5 hours bone-side up. I ramped up the oven to 350 degrees, basted the ribs and put them back in the oven meat-side up for 15 min; then re-basted for another 20 min. Then I pulled them out, basted again with JD BBQ sauce and topped the ribs with brown sugar and put them under the broiler for five more min. The ribs were not "fall off the bone", but that is okay. They were tender and moist with a slight crust.  Bottom line, the recipe worked. I think a tablespoon of chili powder dominates the rub and there is no need for two Tbs of salt. The real key of course is a good cut of meat. I've noticed over the last few years grocery store meat quality has taken a nosedive. So, I'll be supporting my local butcher more. Next time I'm in the mood for ribs, I'll order some from the butcher, do the rub sans chili powder and cook per the recipe.

This was a great recipe! I used my own rub, very similar to this recipe. The ribs were falling off the bone tender and broiling the ribs before taking them out added better color and crispy-Ness. We loved this recipe  and will make it again!

This is a fabulous recipe. So quick and easy.

I get lots of "ohs and ahs" every time, and I make this a lot.

I make a big batch of the rub, so it's ready to go whenever.

Have been experimenting with rib recipes for quite a while now.... this method works well although i usually cut about an hour off by doing ribs at 350 for one hour instead of 250 for two hours... mind you this is with back ribs so might be different with side ribs....  i have my own dry rub and usually do up 50% bbq, 35% honey garlic, and 15% chipotle/experimental  awesome technique that works well...

I didn't use the white sugar , salt, cayenne pepper or chipotle pepper due to diet restrictions and personal preference but used everything else and cooked them exactly as the recipe stated. They were amazing, best ribs I've ever made! I think you can use any ingredients you prefer and as long as you cook them the way the recipe says to, you can't lose! I can't wait to make them for family and friends!

I thought these were very good; however I didn't have some of the ingredients on hand like others substituted ancho chile powder with reg chili powder, didn't have chipotle pepper so omitted it. I cut down on the salt to 1 T as I have high blood pressure.  I used Stubbs mesquite barbecue sauce. It was very good. I'll make them again.

Easy and delicious! Hubby had doubts, but was pleasantly surprised.  I rubbed it with brown sugar and a bottled rib rub. Then topped it with Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce. 
Will definitely make these again.

Fabulous! Technique is everything! Used " a very popular BBQ sauce" from this site :)
The second time I made these I put them on the grill  after 2 1/2 hours in the oven. Brushed with BBQ sauce before and during grilling for  20 mins. Perfect!

The rub was very strong. I boiled the ribs first to shorten the cook time. I covered it for an hour at 250 degrees. Then uncovered at 300 degrees for 30 minutes.

These ribs were the best we've ever cooked.  A few reviewers commented that the method is the main thing so I used a prepared mesquite bbq rub and finished with a bold sauce. I also removed the membrane because of personal preference. Chef John's cooking instructions were followed to the letter and the ribs came out exactly the way we like them - tender, juicy and full of flavor but with just enough 'bite' to them so that they weren't falling apart.  Will absolutely make these again.

Good, but too much salt and a bit harsh  on the peppery spices. The other thing I don't understand is why we're making so much of the rub. There was enough to handle a rack of ribs from an episode of The Flintstones.

First time I've ever made Baby Back Ribs. My husband was so happy to see the rack on the table. He squealed when he took his first bite. Then the second. It eventually turned into what sounded like a naughty movie playing at the dinner table. I'm so glad he loved this recipe. I will use it from now.

I used spareribs and my own dry rub. The meat falls off the bone. I cooked these to serve as finger food and  cut into 2 rib sections before wrapping in foil.

These came out really good! My husband asked if I brought them from a restaurant take-out. (Maybe that says something about my cooking!)
I cut the spice recipe in half and it was more than enough for the rack of ribs I bought. I reduced the salt by a lot because the amount seemed excessive. I didn't have any ground mustard so left that out. Even with those changes, the spices tasted great.
You do have to plan ahead since the cooking time is so long, but they're not difficult to make, and they're  definitely worth it! I will be making these again.

I really liked this method of cooking the ribs - wrapping in foil kept them moist and tender and minimized cleanup too! I didn't have any dried chipotle chile pepper so I substituted paprika.

Fantastic ribs. Flavorful and juicy. I dialed back the ancho chili powder to 2 tablespoons and the cayenne to 1/2 teaspoon. This still plenty of rub and a and a medium level of spicyness.

Easy and delicious.  The perfect recipe.  I did remove the membrane to allow the rub to get to the meat on the backside.  I also rubbed the ribs the night before and refrigerated until I was ready to bake.

Great recipe! They did in fact, fall off the bone. I used another pork rub rather than  the rub recipe because I don't like that much heat, but I'm sure my husband would have loved it. Easy and simple. Will definitely use this method again.

I agree this is a 10 star recipe.  Very easy and delish!  Changed the dry rub a bit and grilled on low heat instead of returning to oven for last 50 min.  Used my own BBQ sauce.  Good flavor, tender.

This is a great method of making ribs in the oven.  I was a little skeptical about the rub...seemed like a lot of chile powder but as it turned out it was perfect.  I did use my own barbecue sauce  and cut back on the salt, but other than that I followed the recipe to the letter.  The ribs were falling off the bone tender and so succulent and tasty.  There wasn't a bit left over.

We will definitely make these again.  I didn't change a thing because I don't believe I can review a posting if I change it.  I coated the rib liberally so I did double the spices for the rub.  They were perfect.  Yum.

My very first attempt at making ribs..Encouraged by all the reviews and having confidence in Chef John's recipes, I decided to give it a try.  Turned out excellent.  Just the right amount of spices for the rub, and perfect cooking time.  Even my fussy five year old granddaughter had several helpings. I will add this to my repertoire of family favourites.  I will try this with BEEF ribs.

Deserves 10 stars.
So different than ribs covered with a BBQ and made in the oven that are falling off the bones in the oven.
These are honest to goodness ribs that's taste and feel just like BBQ  from a local restaurant.
Tender but eaten off the bone.
I am now deleting every other rib recipe I have

This never fails to produce moist, fall-off-the-bone ribs!  I've made them eight times, often for company, and get rave reviews every time.  The rub is good as is,  but I've also used store rub that comes in a jar and it works just as well.  I put mine, very tightly wrapped, in a 225° oven for about four hours.  After turning it up to 350°, I open the foil and baste with BBQ sauce a few times over fifteen minutes.  Really tasty!

Sounds like a lot of  spices and time-just season ribs with pepper and garlic-cook on Q for an hour on low top rack-turn once and watch for flare ups-now add Q sauce-maybe honey as well-cover ribs with tinfoil-not heavy-continue on top rack low 1 hour-enjoy-less time needed for thin ribs-Don

This recipe has quickly became one of my families favourite dishes. One thing I do is drain the juice off into a sauce pan from the ribs before basting them with bbq sauce. I use the juice to make delicious gravy to put on potatoes...my family absolutely loves the ribs and gravy!!

This was a fun recipe to make.  I used my Bosch blender and it mixed perfectly.  This is better than any restaurant.  I've never made my own chili powder before but our local Wal-mart had the ancho dried peppers and I had some New Mexico peppers.  I used a combination of both and followed the recipe exactly.  It is delicious. .  I served them for our July 4th celebration. My whole family raved over them.  I also used "A Very Good BBQ Sauce," recipe with them.  Perfect combination in flavors.  OOOOOHH SOOOOO GOOOOOOD!

I made my own rub and used Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce. I'm rating based off of cooking method! They came out perfect. My oven I think gets overheated so I did 350 for the first 2 set of 10 minutes. Then I lowered to 320 for 10 and then 300 the last 20m.

The low and slow oven method is THE BEST for super tender ribs and I have been using it for almost 50 years.  I would have rated it 5 stars, but the ingredients/amounts in the rub (e.g. cumin, white sugar etc) aren't for me, so not saying it isn't great for some people, not just for me.  I keep it super simple using McCormicks Grill Mates Montreal Steak seasoning as my rub. (**Montreal Steak seasoning also comes salt free - and excellent!!**)  I don't find it necessary to prick the bottom nor to bake meat side down to produce the tender/moist result.  I simply season both sides liberally (or to taste depending on how spicy you like your ribs)  with the seasoning (or rub of your choice as many others have suggested);  line the baking pan with foil making sure the edges are securely wrapped around the pan edges, place the ribs in the pan (meat side up is just fine) and cover with a layer of foil - again, making sure to seal edges tightly (which is the key to the ribs staying moist and ultra tender).  Bake @ 250 degrees 2 1/2 hours for 2 - 2.5 lbs of ribs.  Remove top foil layer.  Place back in oven, uncovered for about 20 minutes - then start to baste with your favorite BBQ sauce - ours happens to be Big Rick's Chipotle BBQ - bake for another 30-45 minutes, basting every 10-12 minutes.  OMG - this is rib heaven for us.  Tender, moist, super flavorful with a bit of a kick (the Montreal Steak seasoning which has black & red pepper, garlic and paprika a some of the ingredients add

These ribs were amazing.  I followed the recipe exactly and I can honestly say they were delicious.   I am sure they will become a family favourite.  The ribs still had some bite which was great and we kept them hot in the wonder bag.   I made sure the membrane was removed  and found this enabled the rub to penetrate the ribs.   Thanks very much.

I made these for Memorial Day dinner.  I had 1 full rack of baby back ribs and about 1/2 the recipe of the rub was perfect for a solid covering.  I wrapped them in foil and put them in the fridge for 24 hours to marinate.  I cut the salt down to 1/8 a cup (remember I only made 1/2 the rub) and didn't feel they were too salty at all.  Instead of adding garlic powder to the rub, I rubbed the ribs down with Trader Joes Chopped Garlic and that made the rub stick to it very well and added a great garlic flavor.  The great tip on removing the entire membrane instead of just pricking it was a great help.  These ribs came out very good - my only complaint was with 4 slatherings and baking with the sauce on them, I thought they came out over coated and sticky - it could have been the sauce I used (Sweet Baby Rays) or maybe an overly generous coating, but next time I think I will try it with only 2 coatings and 3 hours of baking for a less "sticky" rib.  They definitely fell off the bone.

The cooking method and results were terrific.  I was able to accomplish on the grill using indirect heat.  However, the rub was the rub.  I followed the recipe as written and had so much more rub than needed - enough for 3 racks of ribs - but I figured Chef John knew better than me so I put a ton of it on the ribs and it was waaaayyyyy  too much.

Great cooking method. I used rub I had but would use this if I didn't have some. I followed what others said and just used prepared bbq sauce I purchased. I did remove the membrane on the back rather than pricking. My family loved them and requested I make again.  When we have grilled they are usually burned so this was great. Perfectly cooked and tender

My, oh my, oh MY!  Made these 5/30/16, and they were so tender, they fell apart when lifting from the pan to the serving platter.  Baking Nana is right, use your own rub and barbecue sauce, if you like, because the main event here is the method.  I used a "mesquite" rub, then after the main baking time, which was about 2 1/2 hrs., I slathered KC Masterpiece barbecue sauce all over and put the ribs over some applewood chips on the grill, low, about 30 minutes, turning half way through.  Will DEFINITELY make again.  Thanks!

Made this several weeks ago and found it very spicy.  Going to make it again only cut back on the ancho--it was expensive and gave the heat, which literally burned our lips!  Other than that, the taste was good and technique was easy.  Very moist and flavorful.

Made this 5/11/16.  Used half the amount of salt & was glad I did. 1/4 cup of salt would have made this inedible.
I wish I had used about a teaspoon of black pepper as well.

This was a great way to cook ribs. I followed the one reviews suggestions baked for 2.5 hours at 250, then rested them for about 2 hours and finished them on the grill. 
Any favorite rub will work.

I used Stubb's Pork Marinade and let them soak meat side down in the fridge overnight and used Mark's Feed Store's Red Barbecue sauce to brush on the five times. Turned out great, Riblicious. Great recipe.

They say a picture is worth a thousand words, but a video is worth a great dinner. Chef John you did it again. I was always afraid to make back ribs, but since  you taught me some other wonderful recipes, I took the plunge, and it was a success. I used Penzey's Chicken and Rib rub, a couple of  bbq sauce combos and dinner was wonderful. I hope you get to read some of the reviews so you can see how much you help non-cooks like me turn into a darn good every day success. Thanks, Chef John.

Wow - I just took them out of the oven after the first dry rub cook.  I was distracted for a while and when I went back to drain the fat, they smelled sooo good so I ate one.  Then I ate three more ribs before I even put bbq sauce on them to cook in the slow cooker for dinner.  OMG, they were delicious just like that.  Thanks so much for this recipe.  I will always cook by ribs like this from now on.

yes but the ribs were too soft, the next time I'll cut down the baking time to 1-1/2 hrs. the method is as good the grill and one heck faster. Must admit I used my own rub.

I made this today for football playoffs.  My husband and son thought the ribs were good but I think they were way too salty ( I made it with only half the salt that the recipe called for.) I had them wrapped in aluminum foil and it took 4 hours to get to temperature.

Great recipe!  I  usually make my ribs in the slow cooker but wanted to try it this method.  The first time was pretty good.  A lot more flavorful.  Next time, I will cook it a little longer  to get the fall off bone effect.  The only thing i changed was instead of pricking the back of ribs I ripped off the whole membrane.

Entire family, including teenage daughter, liked these ribs. I made my own spice rub, but any good rub will turn out well if you cook the ribs this way.

Super spicy I even cut the spices in half as recommend by others the saving grace was a sweet bbq sauce! That calmed the spiciness down still could've cut back on some of the  spices though... It was cooked perfectly

A little too much salt & hot for my family. Next time will cut down on both. Ribs were tender & very juicy, cooked perfectly. I'll leave a little sauce off next time also.

Like many of you, I'm rating this recipe based on the method of cooking. Due to lack of time, I used a store-bought rub mix (Safeway brand Sweet & Smokey BBQ Rub) and Stubb's Original BBQ sauce. The ribs turned out PERFECT! I'd never made baby back ribs before. This is a great weekend recipe. We'll have leftovers which we're looking forward to snacking on for football Sunday.

My entire family loved this recipe! It is very simple and delicious! I didn't have dried mustard so I used garlic powder. I used half the amount of chili powder because it was all I had but I wouldn't add more if I could, it was fantastic with half the amount. It was more than rub for 7 lbs of ribs. I removed the membrane on the back and then I thoroughly rubbed them on both sides. I baked them at 275 for 2 hours and basted every 15 min. Thank you for an amazing meal!!

These were absolutely delicious!  I made them exactly as the recipe stated with the exception of a couple of spices I didn't have and cut down the salt to 2 tbs.  I also only used brown sugar because I like spicy better than sweet when it comes to ribs.  I will definitely be making these again as they are the best baked ribs I have ever made.  I will try them next time with the mustard and probably cut down the basting time to 40 minutes instead of 50 since they were very slightly overdone.

Absolutely scrumptious!  Modified the dry rub to my taste and left out white sugar - fine with just the brown.  A keeper for sure.  Thank you.

We LOVE these ribs!!! I have made these probably 14 times in the past few months. Everyone begs me for the recipe. I make a big batch of the spice rub and store it in our spice cabinet. Due to the fact I have small children (4 & 2) I do cut the spice down considerably and I add 2 tablespoons of garlic powder. During the summer I prepare the ribs as described and grill them on low (with one of our three burners off) for 2.5 hours, draining the liquid after 2 hours and basting with BBQ sauce the last half hour. Delicious! The only way we eat ribs:)

This is a fantastic recipe and method! I have made the rub recipe at least four times already. I will probably be keeping a jar of it in the cabinet (and maybe for Christmas gifts!!) It's great on pork chops and chicken, too!

I've made this multiple times with excellent results and compliments from the family. I make my own rub but I bet even just salt and pepper would be fine.

Great easy, low tech way to do delicious ribs.  We like them really fall-off-the-bone tender, so we increase the pre-cook time at 250 to three hours.  We don't baste as often with barbecue sauce as the recipe calls for -- just once or twice -- and they couldn't be more tasty and delicious!  Also, I use Jack Daniel's rub (instead of making it myself), which is available in most grocery stores.

This is a really easy to follow recipe and more importantly, it came out finger licking good!! A must try if you don't have a grill or want ribs on rainy days. I followed the recipe almost exactly…I didn't have ancho chile powder, and dried chipotle pepper…I substituted with what I have on hand. The slow cooking method is key and I'd recommend to do this on your day off; it does take quit a bit of time but well worth it!!! Thanks for the recipe, I would definitely do this again and again and again! 
For the BBQ sauce, I made my own. (ketchup, brown sugar, sea salt, black pepper, Worcestershire sauce, red wine vinegar (can  be subt with white vinegar), water, dash of hot chili sauce). Simmer in a small pot for 15 min. Brush the sauce on meat-side, bake at 350 F for 10 - 15 min, brush sauce again, bake. Repeat 3 - 4 times.

This is my first attempt at ribs. So good everyone really enjoyed this recipe and it was easy to follow. I did my ribs two ways. One in the slow cooker, not as flavorful. The other was this recipe, hands down winner. This is my first review and photo and it was deserved!

Unfortunately I did not like this recipe. Way too much salt and pepper.  I am a spicy food lover, but this was awful. There were no subtle flavors, just full on salt and pepper, yuck.

I cheated and used pre-seasoned baby backs from Costco but followed the remainder of the cooking instructions per recipe.  I even omitted BBQ sauce on a quarter of one rack because one of my kids  doesn't care for BBQ sauce. These were awesome as well!

Fabulous Recipe Chef john!! These ribs were fall off the bone tender!! I LOVED THEM!! I did have to use regular chili powder Thats all I had on hand! Loved them still the same! I loved the flavor that the rub gave the ribs Absolutely Delish!! I did stick them in the broiler for a few when I took them out of the oven to caramelize the bbq sauce!! These will be made again!!!

I have never made ribs. I tried these because I didn't have to deal with a charcoal grill. Very pleased with the result but after the 250 degree stint, I sprinkled sugar on the rack each time I renewed coating with the bbq sauce. Worked for me!!

Chef John,    Thank you for your recipe and helpful video.  My  kids helped make this for dinner.  NO ribs left my husband didn't'  get any.   Oh guess we better make them again soon. Easy recipe to follow. Had everything in my kitchen already..   The rub is very  good.   I added 1 tablespoon each of onion powder. And garlic powder. I. Will probably  try the rub on some chicken soon.   Thanks  Carla

wonderful recipe for super moist ribs that fall right off the rack!  of course like with any other ribs recipe you must use a bbq sauce you like because that makes or breaks the final outcome!

I give this 5 stars for the method.  I use my personal rib rub and sauce.  This method is so good I wouldn't fault anyone for cooking ribs this way in July.

Made a practice rack for an upcoming dinner party. Very easy, very tasty, excellent. I found an inexpensive pork rib rub, I will sub it for all the seasonings and increase the sugar next time.

This is a fantastic recipe. I loved the rub but I am guessing any favorite will do. The cooking of the ribs is what makes this a five star item.  Flavor and tenderness were at 10 stars!!

DELICIOUS!! These ribs were so good my sister-in-law said they were better than those my brother cooked on the grill. Of course, he wasn't there when she said it.
;-) The meat literally fell off the bones. Will definitely make these again.

Used my own rub but the cooking method was spot on, wonderful! Adding the sauce, cooking, adding sauce made these soooo good.

Wow, wow, wow!! I've been messing up oven baked ribs for years (could never get the fall-off-the-bone trick), and was on a mission to get it right. Slow cooking in foil first is THE KEY! How could I have not known this earlier?! I improvised a lot on the rub -- about an even mix of chili powder, cumin, paprika, garlic powder and brown sugar. I usually try to stick exactly to the recipe, but I had to use what I had. Results were amazingly good none the less!!

Fantastic and so easy.  I divided the rack into three for easy handling.  Didn't use a dry rub, instead brushed on some sauce on both sides, wrapped and baked.
