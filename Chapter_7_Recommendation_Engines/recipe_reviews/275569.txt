Only adjustment I made was to use cake flour in place of the wheat flour, as I never buy that. I tasted it so I could review it, but will be serving this to friends tomorrow night after our dinner out. The cake is a bit dry. I will serve with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or some freshly whipped cream because of this. Not sure I'd make it again, but I did use up 3 plums that I had in the fridge, so that's good! UPDATE: I just had a piece for breakfast, after warming it a bit in the microwave (12 seconds) and added some whipped cream, and that really helped the dryness. I updated my star rating to 4 stars!
