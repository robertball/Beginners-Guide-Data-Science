This recipe is satisfactory but for me it isn't a Puttanesca without anchovies, so I added them in the second time and it was a four star dish then, maybe even five.  Some people have an aversion to ancovies, so this would be perfect for them.

Delicious! I did make a few substitutions due to what I had on hand... 1 c. canned sauce & 1 lg. diced tomato instead of the canned tomatoes. Also substituted sweet cherry peppers & hot pepper flakes for the hot cherry peppers. I'll definitely make it again.
