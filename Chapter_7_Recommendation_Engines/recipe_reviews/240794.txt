I've tried several Yorkshire recipes from this site with disappointing results.   This one is a winner!   The only change I made was to use buttermilk instead of regular as that was what I had and needed to use it up. I I also sprayed the extra large muffin tins that I used with cooking spray first and may have used a bit less oil as I didn't really measure the olive oil but eye balled it.   Rose really high and was light and fluffy.  Just what I was looking for!

There's no need for that many eggs.  I eliminated the egg whites and the results came out high.  Since my husband had the butter out, I placed thin slice I the muffin pan...just make sure not to burn the butter.  Although it had successfully risen really high, I felt it was missing salt.

These puddings rose beautifully and were very light and airy.  I used a popover pan, and next time I will increase the amount of batter in each cup from 1/4 to 1/3 so I end up with 6 very high puddings instead of 8 smaller. I would think that 1/4 cup batter would work perfectly in a muffin pan, but if you want that hi-rise, somewhat dramatic look, you'll need a little more batter if using a popover pan.  There was a lot of olive oil sitting in the bottom of each popover cup after the puddings were baked, so I'll try 1/2 tsp oil in the future.  I was concerned that if I microwaved the batter for a minute, I'd end up with scrambled eggs, so I micro'd it for 30 seconds, put the lid on the bowl, and then set in the sun for about 15 minutes which gave me warm batter. These were really, really simple to make, and tasted great!

For the first time these were pretty good! I added some smoked Gouda and melted it in the milk first. I let it cool a bit and added the eggs. Next time I'll add 2 teaspoons of kosher salt, 2 teaspoons of minced garlic and 4 ozs of Gouda (instead of two). I'll try it again in a few days. Great recipe!

I made these for Christmas dinner.  Let me start by saying, I am a sucker for traditional/historic recipes and I enjoyed mine with beef gravy over it.  That said, the rest of the family either used jam or honey, and was not as positive about it.  Still, probably the best Yorkshire Pudding recipe I have found on here.  It was nice and crispy, and rose nicely.  Only change I made was to go 50/50 with olive oil and meat drippings in the muffin pan for traditional flavor.

Mine did not turn out very good. They were tough and they only rose 1/2 way. Maybe the temperature was too high? I followed the instructions as indicated
