Not an authentic green chili stew, but this is WONDERFUL and perfect for tailgate parties!!!  I have made it several times since the original posting in 2008 and have discovered it's best served as a winter dish.  It's great as is, but  changed the recipe to suit the family's preference.  1.)  Lightly dust the cubed pork (tenderloin) with 1/2 cup of flour, 1/2 tsp of onion powder, and 1/2 tsp of fresh ground garlic/ black pepper mixture before browning.  2.)  Substitute the canned corn with fresh corn.  Grill the ears and cut the kernels off - grilling brings out the natural sweetness in the corn (do this in the summer and freeze the corn in small baggies for use during the winter).  3.)  Use 2 cans of green chiles and 1 small can of salsa verde in place of the 3rd can of green chilis.  4.)  Add 2 thinly sliced carrots.  5.)  Increase the cumin by 1/2 tsp for more flavor.  6.)  If you have wood smoked, fire roasted tomatoes with garlic, it makes all the difference - if not, try no more than a drop of wood smoke seasoning to give a great flavor to it.   Serve with sour cream, tortillas, or corn muffins!  This is a WONDERFUL recipe!!!  Try it, I guarantee you'll enjoy it....

I made this for our family and for a client tonight.  What a hit!  I did make a few changes to make this stretch.  I used a pre cooked 1 1/2 lb pork tenderloin, cubed.  Sauted the onion, celery, carrots and 3 cloves garlic in oil....added the meat and 2 Cups broth and  8 oz diced green Ortega Chilies....simmered for about 45 minutes.  Instead of the fresh tomatoes I added 1 14 oz can diced tomatoes with jalapenoes and then I added 1 28ox can green enchilada sauce.  Cumin and oregano per the recipe, 6 medium red potatoes diced.  I garnished with chopped cillantro, grated cheese and a blob of sour cream.  Excellent!  You could even add cabbage and zucchini...maybe next time.

WOW!!!  Ok, I will admit that each time I go out to a Mexican restaurant I usually will order the chile verde - and this reciep tastes just like it!  Delicious!  I added one yellow onion and three garlic cloves and sauteed them with the pork before adding the rest of the ingredients.  I also used one can of tomatillo salsa because I did not have all the cans of chiles.  I served it with sour cream and torillas...we definetely will be making this again!

Oh my goodness, this is SO good!  I had some leftover carnitas and asked on the Recipe Exchange for suggestions of what to do with it.  This was the first recommendation I got and I'm glad I went with it!  I had to modify the recipe slightly based on the ingredients I had on hand.  I didn't have any fresh tomatoes, so I used a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles and then added only 1 extra can of diced green chiles.  Since the meat was already cooked, I steamed the diced potatoes and celery in the microwave for 5 minutes to soften them up before adding them to the soup pot.  I also added about a Tbs of minced garlic and about 2 tsp of onion powder, based on a recommendation by the person who suggested this recipe to me.  I let everything simmer together for about 30 minutes and then we topped each bowl with shredded Mexican four cheese blend.  DELICIOUS!  I'll definitely be making this again and again!

I modified this some by adding a can of Hatch enchilada sauce. I cut up some pork shoulder, rolled the cubes in flour and browned them. Then added the onions with some garlic. This was so good and the leftovers were just as great.

Being a Native New mexican, who happens to also be a Pueblo Indian. I fine this incorrect. We never add cumin, oregano, canned corn, and NEVER EVER celery or canned green chiles. We boil the pork, and add fresh or frozen corn. Roasted and (peeled) New Mexican green chiles. For a 2lb roast at least 2 cloves of fresh garlic. You can add 1/2 c of diced tomatoes for color. Boiling the pork cuts down on the added oil. If you boil the pork for an hour with the garlic before the remaining ingredients you will notice a big difference. But please drop the cumin, oregano, and for Petes sake the celery & canned chiles!!

I did almost exactly what Keri did with this recipe.  First of all, I cut the recipe in half and omitted the oil since my pork was cooked already.  I started with a can of tomatoes and green chiles (didn't have any fresh tomatoes) as well as 1 can of diced green chiles.  I added frozen corn kernels and the rest of the ingredients, except for the meat, and cooked it for 15 minutes.  Then I added the left-over cooked pork tenderloin and cooked it for about 20-30 more minutes.  Delicious!

This is an excellent recipe!  I changed it a little: I dredged the cubed pork in a mixture of 1 1/2 cups flour and 1 teaspoon cumin, let it sit for about 15 minutes, and then browned it in batches in my Dutch oven in a little oil.  I then returned all of the meat to the pot, added enough of the chicken stock to make an inch in the bottom of the pot, brought it to a boil, reduced heat, covered, and simmered for about 45 minutes before completing the recipe as suggested.  This will result in very tender morsels of pork.  My husband and I both loved the result.  Delicious!!!

I used rotel tomatoes in place of fresh & this was very bland. Maybe it's supposed to be that way?? I ended up throwing in more cumin, oregano, & some chicken base & added a can of black beans.

This was really great! And it even was only 9pts on my WW diet! I made a few changes. I used chicken breasts since i didn't have pork. I used about 1/2 cup of frozen corn, no celery. I wanted some Tomatillo flavor in it as I saw in another recipe, so I used a 7oz can of Chile Verde Sauce along with 2 cans of green chiles. I left out the cumin since it had enough flavor. I only wish I could have 2 servings!

Was very good. I added more stock, extra potatoes, a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes, a can of great northern beans, 16 oz frozen corn at the very end, garlic, a carrot celery. I sauteed mirepoix and pork, threw in garlic and spices last minute and added the stock and tomatoes and cooked for an hour. then last half hour added potatoes and beans, then last 5 minutes added corn. topped with cilantro and sour cream and served with roasted jalapeno cheddar cornbread recipe from another site.

Very yummy and easy. I used frozen corn, not canned. I also used a few diced tomatillos and one Anaheim pepper (roasted, peeled, and diced) instead of the canned green chiles. Not too spicy for the kids! It's a keeper!

Okay, I tweaked this just a bit due to what I had on hand and my personal taste (more broth/soupy, onions, cilantro for topping etc.) but hands down this was a great recipe with good flavor, fast, and easy to make. I will be keeping this one for days when I don't have much extra time but crave a hot comforting soup. Thank you!

I put everything in the slow cooker and cooked on high for 6 hours.  I didn't have potatoes, so I added 2 cans of white beans.  This is a very good soup and makes a ton!  Next time I will decrease the chicken broth to 3 cups to make it a little less brothy.

Yum! Mine turned out a little too spicy for my kiddos, I don't know if it's because I used fresh roasted chile peppers, or if it's because I subbed a can of Rotel diced tomatoes with chile peppers instead of the fresh tomatoes- I think it was probably the later.  But my husband and I LOVED this! Make sure to watch the pot- all of the broth will evaporate and you'll end up with a smoky, burnt flavor if you're not careful. :) We served over rice then, or added more liquid and reheated as soup for several meals.  Thanks!

This tasted alot like Chicken Tortilla Soup to us.  I cubed the pork and put everything in the crockpot on low for 10 hours.  If I were to make it again I would definitely cut the amount of meat in half.  2 pounds is waay too much for our preferences!  We topped with finely shredded sharp cheddar and served with "Grandmothers Buttermilk Cornbread" from this site which was a good accompaniment.  Also, this had more of a soup (brothy) texture as opposed to what we perceive to be a stew as the recipe name implies.

Ever since I discoved fresh Hatch peppers we love any green chile stew dish.  I did skip the corn as I don't like it in a soup or stew-just a weird preference on my part.  Used some 5-6 large green chiles I had frozen last sumer and also threw in about a cup of green chile salsa.  I too let it simmer all day to thicken a little.  Had fresh flour tortillas to soak up all the goodness of the broth!

I don't know what to say, other than WOW!!  What flavor, delicous, and easy! I had a garlic herb pork sirloin so I used that, browned it with an onion and an elephant ear clove of garlic.  I did not have the chicken broth, so I substituted veg. broth and beer. I had one 28 oz can of green chiles, and being that I used the beer and the chiles were mild, I figured what the heck and used them all.  I did not have 3 cans of corn, so added a can of black beans, with one can of corn.  It turned out very well.  I think the (dark) beer might have overpowered the chiles if I hadn't had twice the amount called for in the recipe, but they complemented each other nicely.  Really Great Recipe, easy and differant.  Will make it again~ Soon!

I loved it. I made a couple of additions though. I put a can of Green Chile Ench. sauce and used Chicken and Sirlion Steak. I also let it cook half the day. But, it is really close to the Green Chile Stew that I get in my hometown in New Mexico. Thank you for posting this recipe.

This is one of my favorite recipes I've discovered on this site. I can happily eat leftovers for days when I make this. Just can't get enough.
