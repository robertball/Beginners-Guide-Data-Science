I tried this recipe and was not disappointed, however the easiest way for me to make adzuki ice cream is simply letting a half gallon of vanilla ice cream melt and adding the beans and refreezing.  This is a lot more work but has an authentic homemade taste.

Very delicious.  I used kidney red beans since I had a bunch, but otherwise didn't deviate from the recipe.  It came out delicious, but very rich - too rich for me!  I think next time I will substitute heavy cream for light cream - it may take time to make, (I did mine without an ice cream maker, too) but it was fun and worth it.  Tastes better than store-bought, and cheaper too.

This was just OK.  Not as good as most red bean ice creams i've had.  It took a long time to make (with the beans boiling) and tasted great out of the ice cream maker, but after sitting in the freezer over night it had a flaky consistancy and tasted much grittier than I would like.  My husband loved the way it tates and would probably give it at least 4 stars, but since I spent all that time - I give it only 2.  I followed the recipe exactly as written.

VERY GOOD.
I used a pressure cooker for the azuki beans so it would cook much faster. And I halfed the recipe.
I would recommend to use red beans as a substitute for azuki beans if you can not get you hands on azuki. 
I've made anko before, so when I found this I was quite excited. And it's no disappointment! My sister doesn't even like anko but she found this quite tasty!
My ice cream maker broke so I just put it in a bowl and straight into the freezer. I will definitely make this again and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes Japanese sweets. :D

We had some purple hull cowpeas instead of azuki and this recipe stil turned out excellently! We didn't use all of the liquid after boiling the beans and it turned out just right. Great flavor!

This recipe did not freeze in my 2qt ice cream maker. I have never had an ice cream not freeze before. I think there may have been too much liquid. I ended up having to let it sit in my freezer and turn rock solid. The flavour is very powdery. I think one would do best to put almost whole red beans in as a mix-in for vanilla instead. I probably won't be taking my chances on this recipe again.
