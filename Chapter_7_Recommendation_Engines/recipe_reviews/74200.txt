My dog loves these treats! I lined up all of her treats, and she chose one of these! I added a few tablespoons of parsly and garlic powder. I also added some peanut butter. I recommend cooking a lot longer to make a texture similar to other dog treats. Thanks for the recipe! **UPDATE** I have found that the shelf life of these treats are about 2 weeks or less. But don't let that stop you from trying this great recipe!

These are Awesome !!! I omitted the salt and added 2 bouillion cubes (1 Chicken, 1 Beef) and 2 tsps. of garlic juice for the summer, to keep the fleas etc off my dogs.  They absolutely love these treats.

Four paws up from my Ridgeback, who seems much more excited to get these treats than the ones from the store. I ended up with 100+ treats, making them about 1.5 inches around (along with some tiny Pomeranian bites too). I added peanut butter to the second half of the batch. Thanks for sharing this easy, no roll recipe!

UPDATE: In case you're new at this, I wanted to remind people that these treats will get moldy since they have no preservatives. Keep a close eye out so your pooch doesn't get sick! My frozen treats have thawed out quite nicely.

Love this recipe! Read through all the reviews and ended up adding reduced sodium beef broth instead of water, a dash of garlic (for the fleas) then a dash of parsley (for their breath). Mixed in a touch of food coloring for red and green Christmas Canine Cookies! This is a great BASE recipe for your pup - I am going to add some peanut butter next time (salt-free of course)!

My basset hound loves these!  I omitted the salt and substituted fat free, low sodium chicken broth for the water.  I put the dough in the fridge for about 10-20 minutes and then took it out, pressed the dough into a cookie sheet and then used cookie cutters to make Christmas trees and stars.  I simply peeled away the extra dough and pressed it into another cookie sheet and repeated the process.  The biscuits are really cute!  I took them to a cookie swap for girlfriends with dogs and I gave some to my vet for Christmas (along with people cookies!)  A+ recipe!

My chihuahua/terrier mix is going WILD for these. I added a chicken bullion and some cheddar cheese. I break them into smaller pieces for training. I even made some in long skinny shapes to fit in his Kong!

This was really easy. I liked that you didnt have to roll out the dough and cut with cookie cutters this was much quicker. I rolled into balls and let my 2 1/2yr old press them with a fork(like for pb cookies)Instead of veg. oil I used bacon grease and instead of water I used meat drippings...I have a george foreman grill and I usually save the juice to pour over the dogs food. I also added 1/2t garlic powder. I'm not sure if I'll put in the whole tablespoon of salt next time...not sure why it needed so much. I would never use that much in a recipe for people. Anyway..my dog loved the cookies. We will make again for sure.

I added a beef boulion cube to the hot water.My 15 week old shi-tsu loves them- cant get enough. They were easy to make and fast. However, my German Shepard doesnt care for them at all- he took them in the yard and burried them. The rat terrier ate one- only because my shitsu had one.Maybe I will add another cube or two to the water next time.

Fantastic recipe especially since you do not have to roll out and cut out...I substituted oatmeal for the corn meal flour and added 1/2 c applesauce and used 1/2 c water...also added 1T cinnamon with the dry ingredients...make these every Friday and dogs wait in front of the oven for them to be done...definately a 4-paws recipe!!!

thank you for the easy to make recipe.. my dog loves these biscuits.  I made a couple alterations: used a mixture of oils(evoo & fish & vitamin e oils); no salt (instead crumbled 1 cooked slice of bacon & 1-Tbls of bacon grease). Also, I rinsed off the egg shell after including egg & peeled membrane from inner shell then put in warm oven to dry it completely then into a plastic bag & crushed with rolling pin until it was powdery & included this(calcium) into mixture. Included 2-tsp garlic powder (this is good to combat fleas; this small amount will not harm your dog, remember this is a treat & not dog food or dog food replacement & should be fed accordingly based on your dog's weight).  Also, my bf's dad saw me take these out of the oven & ate one with his cup of tea. He really liked it! (fyi: yes, i did tell him it was dog biscuits... haha)

This is an incredibly easy and inexpensive way to make dog treats.  My pup, Lucy, has IBS so we have to be very careful about the ingredients we feed her.  As you can imagine, it makes buying treats challenging.  This is a great substitute for the organic pricey treats.  Like others, I substituted low sodium chicken broth for the water, and I skipped the salt since the broth still had plenty of it.

Well the dog loves them, no surprise there! I found the dough very easy to work with. I did replace the salt with parsley and added a scoop of crunchy peanut butter.

Easy, had the ingredients on hand except cornmeal and I subbed a.p. flour.  Subbed 50% less Na beef broth and threw i a 1/4 o shredded cheese.  Fresh out of the oven my 14 year old Boston looked at me and smiled.

Fast and easy to make and my dogs went crazy for them.  I did two batches I substituted bacon drippings and hamburger drippings for the oil.  I used a dog bone cookie cutter and they came out great.  Will never buy store bought again!

Wheat Flour and Corn meal are not good for your dogs, they do not digest it well.  Substitue for Rice Meal and Bean Flour.  LEAVE OUT the salt.  Keep egg shells in (better for them), use light olive oil instead of veggie oil.  The recipe isnt healthy for them, but its a good concept.

This is a great easy recipe. Yes, these will mold quickly. Just take a few of them and keep them in an airtight container for the dogs. The rest can be frozen up to 1 month. just take out what you want to give your dogs and let them defrost at room temp for 1 hour before you give them to you 4 legged friend...

6 paws up, my 3 pups loved these, I followed some of the reviews and added in 1 1/2 tbsps parsley(I used fresh as I didnt have dried), 1 C shredded cheese, 1/2 c peanut butter and used chicken broth instead of water and added in some bacon grease. Even Malachai my super picky border collie loved them, and when i gave him the choice of his favorite cookies over these, he went for these.

This recipe is wonderful but I did make a few changes.  I did not add salt.  For the oil I used half olive oil and half bacon fat.  I used chicken broth for the water.  Next time I am going to try beef broth.  I tried it on 3 dogs and they gobbled them up.  Thank you for this recipe.  Any idea where I can get dog biscuit shaped cookie cutters?

Smells so good baking! I have made them as it is written & have added peanut butter my dog likes them either way. She gets excited while Im baking them-she knows what's to come! I make balls & flatten with a fork just like little PB cookies! I'm going to try cheddar cheese next time! :-)

Last pan of these currently in the oven and so far my dog loves them! Like a lot of others, I left out the salt. I also made them in 4 "flavors" and added peanut butter, cheese, apple, and parsley to separate batches. Easy to make and stamps very easily with cookie cutters- cute! My golden retriever is definitely NOT a picky eater but he's still laying next to the oven/cooling rack waiting for more!!

My dogs love these. They also like the real beef bones with the marrow in them from the butcher but when they are done chewing all the "good stuff" out of them they don't want them anymore.  I fill the hole with this dough and bake them until the dough is hard and it gives those bones new life.  I bake them "on edge" and not flat on the pan so they bake evenly through. It takes a bit longer than the biscuits take. Be careful!! It takes a long time for these to cool enough for dogs to eat safely.

I've been eyeing this recipe for a while. It's my big boy's birthday today (he's 12!) so today was the day. Thank you, thank you, thank you for this recipe! I can finally make decent looking biscuits! I totally left out the salt, it's NOT good for your dog. Other than that, I made this to the T and it worked really well! I didn't need to add any more flour or water. The birthday boy and his little brother and sister all love these biscuits. Thanks again for a super recipe for my pups!

I don't know the difference between flours, and I bought the most expensive kind of wheat flour, and I used the most expensive cornmeal mix, but I am still saving money, because my dogs love them so much that their eyes roll back in their heads, and I probably have saved lots of money considering how much I have made them, I decided to make them smaller so they will last longer. great recipe now if I could only make beer 4 my husband we would all be happy

My dog loved this recipe.  We also had another dog over this weekend and she loved them too.  My dog is allergic to corn, so I substituted white flour for the cornmeal and it worked well.  I added cinamon and parmesan cheese--go figure, the dogs loved it.

Dogs loved them, I  made them with low sodium chicken broth intead of water and added some parsly for breath. I added a little salt for taste, but just a shake or two, nowhere near the amount the recipe called for. My Sheltie is a therapy dog, so no peanut butter, even though he would like it, because too many kids in school with peanut allergies. IMHO, I would keep this in mind when giving as gifts. Instead of balling the dough, I just pressed it flat into the cookie sheet, then cut it into training size bites with the edge of a spatula while still warm from the oven. Much easier!

My Aussie & Lab loved these cookies. I did add peanut butter and cut the sugar down to a teaspoon.   Both my girls wanted more as soon as they ate the first one. Eight paws up as it were.

These are the easiest and best dog cookies!  Our dogs go crazy for them.  I omit the vegetable oil and salt but add flax seed meal as a healthy substitute.  I also add banana or peanut butter and a little honey.  I freeze most of the cookies and then pull them out of the freezer about 10 at a time so they last longer and don't go bad.

Wow!  Doggie approved, but I am wondering about nutritional value.  Of course compared to the sotre bought treats these has less preservatives so they win on that vote.  Now would could we add for extra vitamins?

My two dogs love this.  I substitute chicken broth for the water, I don't add salt, and I add about 3 TBLSP of peanut butter.  My cookies didn't come out shaped as a cookie, they retained the same shape as the way I placed it on the sheet.  Next time I'll flatten in out with a fork.  They kind of look like small pieces of chicken. :) I also froze the other half so that the cookies don't go bad. And keep the baked cookies in a sealed container so they won't spoil.

I made these for all of my dog's friends at the dog park. They were a huge hit. I also substituted the salt for 4 bouillon chicken cubes and I added some parsley for fresh breath. I will be making these a lot.

I just made a double batch of these.  It made 18 dozen and took about an hour.  I substituted the tablespoon of salt with 4 bouillon cubes (chicken).  I also used a melon baller and then flattened to quarter size snacks.  They are a HIT!!!!!  Emma Grace loves them!

These little doggy biscuits were very easy to make. My 3 year old enjoyed helping. However, even after sealed airtight, they molded within 4 days. Next time I will cut the recipe in half, or even a third so they won't go bad so quickly. Dog like them!

Noodles loves his biscuits!  He shared some with two doggy friends yesterday and they loved them too!  Hubby even took a taste - said they were a bit salty so will cut that down to make them more healthy next time.

My dog lili is so picky, she likes them but takes a long time to eat them. But I made these for christmas presents for my family and friends dogs and they loved them, I used low sodium beef broth instead of water, bacon dripping instead of oil, and added 1 cup of cheddar cheese, I strongly suggest that you put the mixture in the refrigerator for 15-20 minutes then you can roll the dough out and use cookie cutters. Excellent recipe with alot of options.

These passed the taste test, so they're given an automatic 5 stars.  Both of my boston terriers loved them.  I chose to roll out the dough and cut them into cute little stars and moon shapes.  The dough handled beautifully; no need to add additional flour.  I also didn't add any of the salt - I didn't think it served any purpose.  Besides, I threw in a small amount of parmesan cheese anyway.  They baked up very nicely and filled my house with a pleasant smell.  Thank you for posting the recipe!

I followed previous recommendations:  I replaced water with organic chicken broth, slightly reduced the amount of salt, added parsley & made them like you would peanut butter cookies.  My dog loves them.  They are quite chewy & I believe next time, I will cook them a couple minutes longer for a crunchier texture.  My Bishon loves them.  I will definitely make these again.

I have four spoiled dogs, an English Mastiff, a Rott, a Dobe mix rescue and a little mixed breed I rescued off the streets!  All the dogs loved the recipe, although I used organic chicken broth in place of the water, a little garlic and added a cup full of cheddar cheese!  This is so much better for them than the stuff you buy at Wal-Mart!

Nice simple recipe - I customized it by omitting the salt, using spelt flour instead of whole wheat and chicken broth instead of water. I added some spices:  1/2 tsp each cinnamon, ginger, turmeric and cumin - yummm nice earthy aroma. My pup gives them a 2 paws up!

This recipes is sooo easy and easy to adjust to make different flavors. Perfect as is! Or some variations: I replace the veggie oil with bacon drippings (and omit the salt). Another variation is to add 1/2 cup peanut butter for a PB treat or 1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese for a cheesy snack. Roll directly onto parchment paper, use your cookie cutters to cut out, lift the extra sides and voila! Perfect cookies! You don't need the 2" between cookies because these don't spread/rise much. Your puppy will love them and great to wrap and give as gifts!

I'm only 13 and I made these treats by myself, and, well, they didn't turn out the best. I followed all the instructions, did the correct baking times, and had every exact measurement of the right ingredients, yet my dog Rosie didn't go as crazy for them as some of the other reviewer's dogs did. She sort of sniffed it suspiciously and ate it reluctantly. Maybe I did something wrong, or I need a grown ups help! :) Still I really like this recipe becuase it was easy to make and I got about 120 biscuits out of it instead of 42. :)

Our pup absolutely loved them. He has been picky lately too, which we found extremely bizarre seeing as dogs eat anything, so we opted our of store bought treats and found this basic [but tasty] recipe. We added natural peanut butter and some cinnamon to give it a little something. He cannot get enough of the taste and smell. Waited by the oven until he was finally able to snatch a few.

I made these biscuits today for my doggies and they love them!  And I feel better about giving them treats without all the chemicals and preservatives.  I halved the dough, added about a 1/4 cup of creamy peanut butter and a little extra flour to that half.  I then added 2 teaspoons of minced garlic and about a tablespoon of parsley flakes to the other half.  My dogs liked both variations.  This is a keeper!!!!  Thanks for posting!!!

This is a great basic recipe...I did modify it to fit with some ingredients I had on hand...I used 2 c ground oatmeal, 1 c yellow grits, 1 c flour then I used olive oil instead of veggie oil and about 1/2 c baked weet potato and 1/2 c dried cranberry paste...also washed the egg and used my magic bullet to process the whole thing shell and all...added garlic juice and 1 T parsley...and after reading some of the reviews I used a beef bullion mixed with the cup of water...I gave my dogs (chihuahau, shiihtzu, and pit bull) a small amount of it raw...THEY LOVED IT and were begging for more:) I believe they would all give it a 4 paw rating! Thank you for sharing this recipe!

My 4 m/o male chihuahua, Aiden, loved it. I shared it with my neighbour too coz it made into alot of cookies. I made it very small (1/4" size). I added crumbled bacon and replaced the oil with bacon fat. Replaced the water with 1/2 cup milk & 1/2 apple juice. I baked it in 350 oven for 40 minutes since in 20 minutes they were still raw inside. Overall, good basic recipe. Will make it again.

My dogs definitely approved of these. I omitted the salt, instead adding a little bit of bacon grease. I also only used a drizzle of oil. Came out great, thanks!

Excellent! My Chocolate lab loves them so much. He was so excited for another one, I noticed there was a huge strand of drool hanging from him mouth! He loved the dough too, just like me:)

I followed the advice of other people and used beef broth instead of water and omitted the salt. I added about 1/4 cup of parmesean cheese and about 1-2 Tablespoons of parsley. Next time I will add garlic too. This recipe is a perfect base that you can customize however you want.

My dog loves these. I omitted the salt, as she is almost 13 yrs old, & I don't think anyone's dog should have this much salt in their food. As suggested by others, I used chicken and beef broth in place of the water, & they were a big hit. So wonderful that you don't have to roll them out. I'll make them for my canine soulmate on a regular basis.

Shih Tzu tried and true.  My 3 know when I'm cookin' up a batch and stick to me like velcro until their they get one (like my kids with Christmas cookies).  I used beef broth and omitted the salt as suggested.  Won't by store bought puppy cookies any more.  Thank you for sharing.

These were really easy. My 'boys' loved them. I left the egg out and added beef bouillon and granulated garlic. After the initial bake time they weren't hard all the way through so I put them back in a 350' oven, turned it off and let them dry out in there for about 2-3 hours. I think crunchy is better for their teeth

I tried this recipe for my thirteen year-old Dachshund and my grandmother's also thirteen year-old Labrador Retriever mix and Poodle. I tried it myself before giving it to my dog. It tasted delicious! Then I have my dog a piece of one, to get a canine to sample. She couldn't get enough of it! After re-reading Three Dog Bakery's story for the bajillionth time, I knew I had to try giving my dog fresh-baked cookies. I choose the one I had all the ingredients for already and had good reviews. I am so happy I tried this recipe. Not only could my Dachshund not get enough, but my grandmother's dogs gulped it down like Christmas dinner, then proceeded to beg for more. It was a wonderful treat for them all and I certainly will make it again. Thank you so much!

This recipe turned out great!  Thank you for sharing this. 
I made it exactly how it was supposed to be made for my first batch. It was great.  In my second batch I added some peanut butter. My dog seems to like the one with peanut butter in it.  I also tested to see if he liked these treats better than the store bought ones...and he chose the home made treats over the store bought! Thanks again!

I just added a small packet of wet dog food(meat chunks) into the mix. If it needed more flour just add a little bit. The dogs liked them. Very easy to make. I used a plastic shot glass to cut out little rounds and pricked with fork before baking.

My lab loves these!  I added some ground-up sausage patties that were left over from breakfast and used the sausage drippings as part of the oil.  I also didn't add the salt since we were putting in sausage.  I like this recipe because you could really add anything to it - and you don't have to roll it out and use cookie cutters.

My Coton puppy loves these treats! I've made them twice, once with peanut butter and once with bacon drippings. Because I'm using them a training treats I've made them very small. I take the dough and divide it into smaller segments. Taking one segment at a time, I roll it into a rope the thickness of a pencil.  Then, using a knife or board scraper, I cut the rope into 1/2 inch pieces. The  treats are about the size of a peanut. Bake them for 15 minutes until very firm. Store in an air tight container.  Your dog will LOVE these.

I can literally delete all my other dog treat recipes.. I LOVE this one.. Comes out Fantastic every time, can change up the flavors for variety, although as it is, is just fine..The dough is so easy to work with, I form into bone shapes by hand, its so pliable. But the best part is my 3 large babies Sophie, Baron & Winnie absolutely Love em !  Thank You so much for this recipe..

I made these for my mom's puppy and she loved them...I think. She'll eat pretty much anything, but this is the ONLY time she's ever freaked out when someone got too close to her as she was eating. The only thing I did differently was that I did not add the salt. Not sure why it's needed. Will try peanut butter next time.

Delicious! I added 1 bouillon cube on warm water and omitted the salt. Both my mom and I tasted them and they're even yummy for humans! Of course my dog loved them and keeps staring at me while I bake them.

Just finished making these for my dogs & they loved them!  Replaced garlic salt (for fleas) for regular salt & added 2 tablespoons peanut butter.  Gave the first ones to my 2 dogs while they were still warm & they disappeared quick! :-)  Can't wait to try with other ingredients that my dogs might like!

Excellent Recipe! VERY EASY! The furry guys (even the cat!) love this recipe. I put in 2 bullion cubes - either beef or chicken and sometimes add peanut butter to change them up. I love that I don't have to roll them. Thanks for the recipe.

These are easy to make.  I thought they tasted a little bland, even when I used beef broth instead of water, but my dog seemed to like them!

My pup seems to enjoy these.  The recipe made a ton - he'll be snacking on these for quite a while.

Very easy to make and nice that it didn't require being rolled out.

These are like crack for dogs!  I added garlic powder and some chopped up left over chicken and they devoured them! So easy to make too with ingredients that I normally have in the house. I keep them in the fridge so they don't spoil but I can't see that happening since a recipe barely lasts a week. No more purchased treats in this house!

My dog loves this treat though the amount given to put on the cookie sheet per ball is not enough. I recommend doing a tablespoon rather than a teaspoon.

I add Turkey Bacon to this recipe, never added salt. I have a dog (Min Pin) that is diabetic and he loves them. I also have an older dog Australian Shepherd,and this does not add fat that is never needed. I also make a double batch of these. I put them in an air tight container and I freeze 1/2 of them.

Easy to make, and makes a lot. I have a golden retriver who will do anything for them. I only have one dog and tha batch made so much I gave some to two of my friends (one who has a very picky dog) and both dogs loved them. I tried it with beef boulion first she liked it ok, but when I make them with natural peanutbutter she goes crazy. (I eyeball how much to put in.)

I used a cup of beef broth in place of the cup of water, added a tablespoon of parsley, and omitted the salt because of the extra sodium that the broth added. I'm not too sure if corn meal and polenta are precisely the same thing(?) but I used polenta where the recipe called for corn meal. I baked them for thirty minutes on a greased cookie sheet and my dogs all loved them! Chihuahua cherished it carrying it away and taking her time with it, German shepherd/malanois didn't even move from his sitting position and inhaled it and pitbull/lab crumbled it in his jaws and let all the pieces fall on the ground before licking them all up. Odd, surely, but the point is, they all loved them! This recipe made us exactly 24 biscuits.

My dog loves these! The only difference,was that I added some beef bouillon for some extra meaty flavor. It is really easy and quick and the dogs love them. A quick tip is to make sure they cool completely before storing them so they do not get moist and crumbly.

I made this as an End of the Year gift for my daughter's(6 yr old) Kindergarten teacher's Yorkie. I first wanted to make sure my two Pugs  would eat them. They were not sure about them but once they ate one oh my they had three before I knew it (my 6 year old gave it to them). This is my fourth batch. I wanted to make sure I had enough for the teacher's gift then for my boys. I did add a jar of Gerber Squash. I still have some baby food left over from my 23 month old.
