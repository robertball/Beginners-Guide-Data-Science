This turned out really great. I made it for my room mate and myself and we both really liked it.
I made a couple changes though. I added 1/2 Lb of spicy Italian sausage, a bay leaf, and some diced portobellos. I did not add any red pepper since the sausage would add the spice. 
To account for the extra meat, I added a few extra ounces of pasta sauce. 
I will be making this again in the future.

Simple and delicious! I did use ground beef b/c that's what my family likes, but kept the recipe the same, otherwise. Great flavors and textures... The family LOVED this sauce, which makes it a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing! :)

Well done, Chef John... this recipe was so unique from the usual spaghetti sauce I've done. I wasn't sure about milk in the ingredients but wow, the end result was 5 star yum! Everyone raved and wanted more. I didn't have the diced steak on hand the first time I made it, and ground beef still turned out great. Thanks... this will be a repeat fave.

My family loved this recipe! My teenage nephew even said it was "incredible" (and we all know how hard they are to please). Will make a again!
