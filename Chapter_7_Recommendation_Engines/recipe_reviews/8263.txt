As a professional decorator, this icing is a great base.  Most will think it too sweet and I agree but you can use 1/2 shortening (hi-ratio or Sweetex is best but crisco will work if that is all you can get) and 1/2 SALTED butter and add 1/4 tsp salt also (popcorn salt works best as the grains are smaller but regular table salt works fine if that is what you have), salt cuts the sweetness in icings!

This frosting was amazing! I used it to repair a store-bought cake that my mother dropped. It turned out beautiful and tasted great. My husband was teasing me about eating the icing by the spoonful. I used all butter in mine. I suspect that anyone who had a problem with the frosting tasting like shortening probably had shortening that was going bad from age. I learned from experience that if shortening is old, the flavor overpowers anything it's cooked in. Yuck! Anyway, this is definitely my new favorite icing recipe!

Very easy to make!  My version is: I did 1/2 butter 1/2 shorting and only 3 cups of sugar.  I also didn't fill the 1/2 cups all the way because I only had 20 cupcakes to frost.  I also used 1 TB milk instead of water and added about 2 ts. concentrated defrosted canned OJ and orange marmalade (to taste-about 2 TB) to make an orange flavored frosting.  You can even add a drop or 2 of orange food coloring!  It turned out great!!!

I am not usually a fan of white frosting (DULL!) but I had to make some so I used this recipe.  Except my Crisco was expired and I didnt have unsalted butter so I used two sticks of regular butter, 3 Cups of powdered sugar and a little extra milk and vanilla. OMG, it is SOO good.  I dont know why everything calls for shortening in frosting recipes but the all butter alternative was WONDERFUL.

This is the recipe that we used when I took a cake decorating class.  For the whitest icing make sure that you used CLEAR flavorings. (available at the wilton section at your store).  The almond extract 1/2 tsp and butter flavoring 1/2 tsp is a nice addition to the vanilla.  Make sure you chill it well if you are doing flowers.

I have been searching for a great icing recipe, and this one is awesome!  I made it twice with half crisco/half butter and it turned out well.  The third time I used ALL butter; I prefer butter over crisco.  If you don't need it to be bright white, this works just as well and gives it a nice, buttery taste!

This is a great recipe. To make it healthier I use Spectrum Organic all veget. shortening which has no trans fat and is made with palm oil and has lots of the good polyunsat. and monounsat.fats.

I needed an icing to go with the Swedish Nut Cake I made (also from this site) and I choose this one. I didn't have the cream cheese and so I wasn't able to make the proper frosting.  Definitely the wrong TYPE of icing for the cake I made, but the taste was amazing.  I sometimes get cravings for birthday cakes, just for the icing.  Now I can make my own at home.  I used regular vanilla instead of the clear, and it came out bright white!!  I didn't have to beat mine anywhere near five minutes, more like 2.  I did add 2 more TBLS. of water so that may have been why.  Thanks Meghan...this is so good!

This is just a beautiful frosting!  Creamy, smooth, fluffy and delicious, perfect for piping and easy to mix up - just dump all the ingredients in a bowl and let 'er rip!  I didn't need a pure white frosting so I used half butter and hi-ratio shortening, however, I've used all shortening many times and have no complaints of greasiness or the frosting being tasteless.  Those who do have those issues might try using hi-ratio shortening, a pinch of salt which heightens flavors and a teeny bit of almond flavoring ('tho I prefer just the vanilla).  And by all means make sure whatever shortening you're using is fresh and not rancid!  (Or, take the extra steps and make the more complicated and fussy Italian, French or Swiss Meringue Buttercream Frosting...)  I used an egg white for part of the water called for and then just added a teaspoon or two of water until I had the piping consistency I wanted.  One recipe frosts two dozen cupcakes generously.

This was really easy to make and kids love it. The white color makes it a great foundation to decorate upon. I used it for cupcakes and it worked really well.

I have no idea why anyone would rate this anything but excellent. I have tried four different frosting recipes with each birthday cake I have made for my kids. This one not only was a great crumb layer, but when thickened made for terrific decorating.  but the real stars belong to taste!   my mother in law, a tough critic, RAVED about it.  look no further.

This truly is the best white icing ever!! I changed the recipe by only using three cups of powdered sugar instead of 4. I also have found that I need to make 1 and a half of this recipe to ice a cake and decorate it. You really do have to beat it for 5 mins if you want it to turn out good...

This recipe made me happy & unhappy.  I followed suggestions, subbed half butter (salted).  Also, used half & half instead of water - so it would remain stable but soft.  Ended up adding 4 3/4c sugar - a pound basically. Also added a scant fourth almond extract & scant fourth salt.  Well, yum frosting.  Similar to bakery/birthday cake type, BUT NOT WHITE WITH BUTTER.  'Should've known better, I agree.  'Followed review on that one, too.  It looks white compared to butter frosting, sure; but if we're talking color?  It isn't.  I "need" PANDA WHITE.  I am not kidding.  :)  This isn't panda white.  It appears there will be more than one cake in my future.  Oh, mine yielded about 3 1/2cups w a little help from the electric mixer.  I don't see how 4 - 5 are possible unless you reeeeeallly whip it.  'Guess ya could.  Oh, a little 411 if you're new to frosting:  Whipping will lighten the color - artificial or not.  Next day: 'Tried making whitewhite frosting w/o butter, subbing sour cream & shortening.  Not good.  Even added 2T butter & still, not good.  'Ended up using this lessthanPandawhite frosting & everyone liked it.  I'll keep looking for white that you can eat though!  :D

Icing was very  very easy to make. The first time I followed the recipe, it was really  bland so I had to add more sugar and vanilla, but there was still something missing....just tasted like I was eating sugar flavored Crisco...

greasy , flavourless,tastes like cheap grocery store frosting! Quick and easy not a good trade off, i would rather take more time and NOT use shortening as the base fat, better tose cream cheese, butter or some kind of mix of both or a egg white or whipping cream type.......

This made a greasy, tasteless icing that quickly dried out.  It leaves an unpleasant coating on your tongue.  It is also overly sweet.  I happen to like the icing on most grocery store cakes, but this isn't it.  This was purely a waste of time and ingredients.

3 stars because I had to modify the recipe. I used 1 cup of softened unsalted butter and the full 4 cups of icing sugar.  I used milk instead of water, then added another 2 - 3 tbsp to thin it out. After making the icing, and being dissatisfied with the sweetness, I read some more reviews, and added approx. 1/4 tsp of salt. It really cut the sweetness, and made it taste more like icing and less than sugar.  I also had to work with the icing quite a bit to get rid of the graininess (yes, I was using icing/confectioner's sugar, not granulated).

This is my standard frosting, and it is based on a the Wilton recipe. It is infinitely adaptable. I add 1 teaspoon of almond extract and use regular vanilla extract (Adam's Best).

Followed directions exactly but it didn't taste good and left a bitter taste in my mouth. We made it for my daughter who has a lot of food allergies, and she took one taste and said it was icky, she wouldn't touch her cupcake again till we cut the top off. We through away the doll cake I made for her and the rest of the frosting. Also, though it held it's form, it wasn't easy to spread smooth, so the decorating looked sloppy. I used a buttercream recipe for the rest of  the cupcakes and it was much easier to work with.

I LOVED this icing.  I used all butter instead of shortening and cut down the sugar to 3 cups instead of using the 4.  I couldn't stop eating it; it is the best icing ever!

My family did not care for this frosting; it was way to sweet! It did work well for decorating, but no one would eat the finished cake! It also colored very nicely; for these reasons, I give it two stars. I'm sorry, but I will not be making this frosting again.

This is the BEST & easiest white icing I've ever used!!  I made this for my son's 1st b-day cake (it was a puppy) and it just made the cake! The icing was delicious & had everyone raving about the cake. I added 2 extra TBS water like suggested & it was the perfect consistency for icing the cake.  I had to double the recipie, though...which was no big deal. I will be using this from now on! Thank you sooo much for sharing!

Horrible, threw the whole thing away. The shortening gave out a bad taste but then its probably just my shortening. Too sweet, not to mention. Won't make it again.

This was exactly what I was looking for.  Just like the icing at the bakery my kids love.  I think the key was beating it for the full 5 minutes.  I used the 10 setting on my kitchenAide with the whip attachment and the icing was fluffy and perfect for piping onto cupcakes.  Thanks!

I substituted butter for the shortening.  How can butter, sugar and vanilla go wrong?  Of course it was delicious!

After adding extra water (2 tbs.) and vanilla (1 tsp.), I got it to the right consistancy. I used butter flavored shortening instead of plain, it gave it a yellowish color but looked great with the pink sprinkles I used.

This is a very good icing. I've used it for every decorator cake I've done.  Use half and half instead of water.  The consistency is much better. Also, I use lemon or almond extract in place of the vanilla.  Good for flowers and other fancy touches.  Just add more powdered sugar so that the flowers will hold up better.

Really good but also really sweet!
I cut the recipe wayyy back because I only needed enough frosting to frost a cake.
I also used 1/2 shortening and 1/2 *salted* butter. 
I added just a tiny pinch of salt after tasteing it, that cut back the sweetness, and after that the frosting was very very spoon lickable!

Thanks for sharing!

I really liked this icing, I made it for my husband's birthday cake and it really whipped up fluffy and light. I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening and it still stayed nice and white.Wonderful flavor,I put it on a Hershey Recipe Black Forest Cake.Simply delicious

I used this recipe for the first time yesterday.  It was very good. I did add an extra 1/2tsp of vanilla extract. I used real vanilla extract, not the clear imitation. So it had an ivory color. The texture was perfect. It received many compliments from my guests. I'd definitely use it again.  As some others stated it was very sweet. That is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.

I can see this being a useful decoration icing... but... if you are looking for flavor, it is not very sweet or creamy and the shortening gives it strage taste.

By the time you alter this recipe to make it palatable, you would be better off using another one, or one of your own.  I followed all directions to the tee, but this recipe, left a lot to be desired.

This icing was not very good...it left a funny flim of shortening on your tongue and i used waaaay more icing sugar than the recipe called for. It was a great consistancy for decorating and with more icing sugar was ediable, but without the added icing sugar it tasted terribe.

used all salted butter no shortening, increased vanilla, and added 1/4tsp salt, only used 3C powdered sugar, and thinned with additional milk for spreading. This was great not too sweet because of the salt, perfect for us.

This recipe was GREAT... but I did not follow it to a tee... i used 1/2 tsp almond extract and only 3 cups of the sugar and it tasted wonderful... it was still pretty sweet so I can see how using 4 cups would make it VERY sweet.. highly recommend the almond extract

Great consistency for decorating!  I used all butter instead of shortening.  Be sure the butter is at room temp, and beat on high for a couple of minutes. Fluffy, sweet and delicious.

Very Good!  However, be careful, the icing is very stiff, and hard to spread.  If you are afraid that you might "peel" up the cake, then you might want to add a little water.

Awesome recipe. Easy to make, versatile and tastes good. I added a little lemon zest to the recipe to frost lemon cupcakes...absolutely divine. The basic recipe is great and I'll try other variations as well. The possibilities are endless when you have such a simple base.

I really enjoyed this icing.  It was very easy to make and turned out GREAT.  
~A tip though if you are using it just for icing; you don't need 1 full cup of shortening, I used 3/4 a cup and that was more than enough.  I also used 1/4 cup of water, and some milk to make it the consistency I preferred.  And lastly, I used about 3 tsp of vanilla, just so it had a little more taste.  
I will use this recipe again, and I would reccomend it especially if it is your first time making frosting.  Thank you for this recipe Meghan! :)

I'm about to gain 20 pounds.  I sort of wish I'd gone my whole life not knowing I could make this icing from stuff I already have in my kitchen!  It tastes absolutely exactly the same as the icing on the cakes from the grocery store bakery!  I'm in love!

I did sub half butter, at the suggestion of several other reviewers.  It's not bright white, but I'm not picky about that.

I make this a lot with the "White Almond Wedding Cake" recipe on here.  I'm now the "famous" family member who brings the best cakes to every get together. I use all butter instead of the shortening.  I have made cupcakes out of these recipes as well and taken to events.  People have asked me if they could make orders for their kids birthdays and if I own a bakery.  You can't go wrong with this recipe.

My daughter made this recipe last week for some cupcakes she was baking.  She did all the research and cooking on her own so I didn't even see the recipe for the frosting ahead of time.  I tasted it as she was frosting the cupcakes and did not like it at all.  I took one look at the recipe and figured out why - all shortening?  It had that chemical taste to it (and the shortening was not old) plus it was incredibly sweet.  While it did have a good texture for frosting, I prefer something that has a butter base.  Only one out of my four kids liked the frosting - the others scraped it off.  Interesting to note that of the few reviews I read that give it 4/5 stars, they ALTERED the recipe and used at least a portion of butter.  I hate when people change the recipe around, but still give it 4/5 stars.  When there's such a big alteration in order to make the recipe work, it doesn't deserve high praise.

Perfect!  I cut the sugar down to 3.5 cups and added .5 cups of cocoa powder and whipped it (adding water to get the consistency that I wanted) and it is perfect!  Not too sweet, not too chocolate-y

This recipe is just fantastic! I was afraid to use it because I normally don't like shortening based frostings, so I took other's suggestions and did half butter and half shortening. I also used milk instead of water, and only used 1 tbs milk but I used almost 1 tbs of clear imitation vanilla, because imitation isn't as strong as the real stuff. But this was just great, the first recipe for frosting I actually LOVED the first time I tried it! most of the other recipes I have to fiddle around with for a half hour. Oh I also whipped the butter and shortening for about 5-7 minutes and added the milk and vanilla, it helps absorb the flavor of the vanilla better and makes for a smoother frosting. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!!

I loved it...this was like the best icing ever!!!When  I  first tried making it I wasnt paying close enough  attention to the recipe and used regular sugar instead .Anyone else who gave this recipe a bad rating probably had the same problem....(the second time it was great!!!!)I LOVED IT! I agree with another review i saw for this recipe ...I dont understand how anyone could rate this anything but excellent !!!:)

This recipe needs to be modified quite a bit to taste good. Use at least 8 cups of confectioners sugar and 2 tsp of vanilla and 1 tsp of almond extract. Add some salt to taste, and it will take more water to get it to the consistancy to spread on a cake. Keep tasting till you get it lke you want it.

Great to decorate cakes using a piping bag.  I did have to add more liquid to the icing though.  Just bit by bit until it would pipe out better.  I didn't find it too sweet compared to my usual recipe.

this is a great fluffy icing, the whipped fluffiness made it a little hard to use to decorate a cake though. The best part is its not too sweet and lactose free for my son.

Very simple and delicious for cupcakes. I used half butter, half crisco. I also used milk instead of water and upped it to 3 Tbsp for a slightly creamier texture. Would need to double the recipe for a layer cake.

A great quick icing, very white! I used it for cupcakes not decorating. Also I used regular vanilla and it came out just as white. Thinking about trying to add fruty flavors.

This icing is good, but you need to use milk in place of water to have something to "bind" it together (the fat in the milk) otherwise, your icing can separate leaving you with a big mess.

not a recipe I would use for decorating cookies or muffins. But I used all shortening. Using half butter like she said might help. It tastes like the sugar roses they put on top of cakes.

very good, but it had a weird taste. i ended up using clear imitation coconut extract, instead. that gave it a more 'frosting-like' taste.

This is a decent icing. It's reminiscent of Oreo cookie filling, but the consistency is odd because of the shortening. It doesn't melt in your mouth the way butter-based icings do.

I had to try twice to succeed with this recipe.  Beating it for 5 minutes made it all warm and lumpy; you could feel the sugar! But the second time I mixed it for a minute (approx.)and it came out perfect and fluffy!

I used Splenda that had been run in the food processor for this recipe to make it sugar free and it turned out wonderful! I also just used extra vanilla instead of water and added a splash of rose water. It came together really quick, but i let it beat with the wisk attachment for the full 5 min and it is so fluffy and creamy! Anyhow, this one is going into the recipe box :)

Beautiful looking icing. Consistency  was wonderful.  Quick, easy, and I had all the ingredients on hand.  I sifted my powdered sugar in one bowl, then creamed my wet ingredients with the shortening in another bowl and added my powdered sugar, heaping tablespoon, one at a time to mix thoroughly for 5 minutes.  My only complaint is that it was to gritty sweet for my taste, but looks great on a cake and was easy to make.If you like sweet icing, this one's for you.

YAY!! I am soooo happy! I've been looking for a frosting recipe to cover my cakes, and I've tries a million that all went wrong. I was going to give up when I tried this one. It went perfectly!!! 

I only used 2 and a half cups of sugar, and a little more than  tsp of vanilla. Great recipe! This is a keeper!!

Can't say it took 5 minutes to get this to be frosting. Beautiful consistancy, added some cream to thin a bit. sets up very quick and 
looks great when done. I used 1/2 butter, 1/2 butter flavored crisco. Tasted great the next day but taste
quality goes down with time.  Eat it quick and you'll be satisfied.

This worked great for decorating with a star tip on an Easter cake.  The only thing I did differently was to add lemon extract instead of vanilla because it was a lemon cake :)

This frosting was fast and easy and made a beautiful, white frosting. I added food coloring to some reserved frosting and piped decorations with it. Worked great. 
It tasted good, too. Even my husband liked it, and he hates frosting.

So usually I am all about taste and not looks, but in this case i needed a frosting that was stark white to make baseball cupcakes for my son's end of the season baseball party. This frosting stayed true to it's promise, i used 1/2 shortening 1/2 salted butter with 3tsp of vanilla 3tbs of milk 3 cups powdered sugar and a pinch of salt. Was exactly the color i needed and tasted great too! Thanks for the recipe!

I just made this recipe.  I used cream instead of water.  The consistency is perfect, flavor just like a bakery frosting.  I am impressed.  :) It was fluffy and white.  I used wilton clear vanilla.  This will be my go-to frosting from now on.

This recipe is so perfect, so easy and so, so inexpensive.  And versatile? You betcha'.  Our favorite is to add a little extra water and peppermint extract and whip it for 5 minutes.  It makes the lightest frosting.  And it is the absolute best for decorating.  The possibilities are endless. Thank  you Meghan for the refresher on the best icing/frosting ever!

I used this recipe when decorating a half-sheet cake this past weekend.  As another reviewer suggested, I used 1/2 cup EACH Crisco and salted butter.   I do no agree that water works to thin out the icing; rather, it turns it into cement!  I didn't bother with corn syrup, either.  I used just a little milk (started with a teaspoon and added in little bits as I needed it).  The icing is is very easy to work with, although if you are tinting it and need to use it at different times during the decorating process, put the piping bag(s) in the regrigerator to firm up (hot weather and icing do no not mix!).   Using 1/4 tsp salt also cuts the sweetness of the icing, as the same reviewer suggested.

I recently used this icing on a wedding cake. I took other reviewers advice and added a bit of salt and butter flavouring instead of vanilla. It turned out very well.  Very sweet, of course, but tasty!

This is a crusting decorator's icing. I use one similar all the time because it smooths out like fondant on cakes. I use flavored creamers for the liquids, however,, and that makes a difference. This is a lot superior to use when decorating cakes as it holds well and as long as you don't use butter, holds up to heat and humidity problems. No sliding and you don't have to worry about how long it  can stay out of the fridge. Love it!

Yummy! :) I made this with the butter cake recipe also found on this site. It is sooo good. I am not a fan of shortening, so I just used butter. I also added a sprinkle of cinnamon. This was fantastic! It will definitely be a go-to from now on! :D

This is a wonderful mild frosting. If you love super sweet, this is NOT for you. We make most of our cakes w/o frosting, because my husband doesn't like frosting but when he tried this it was a huge hit. Plus we have a lot of foreign friends who all agree American deserts are TOO sweet, many of whom agree that this is a good frosting.  You can change the texture by adding a VERY small ammt. of milk/ water (a few drops) at a time to get desired consistency.

This makes a great icing! I didn't have any shortening, so I used 1 3/4 sticks of butter. I did find it a bit too sweet, but after I added a few dashes of salt it was perfect. The texture was perfect. I didn't have any food coloring, so I added a few teaspoons of the red velvet cake batter to it to give it color. It worked perfectly! I will definitely be making this one again!

This icing is way to greasy, it leaves a coating of grease in your mouth. I even used half butter and half shortening. I could imagine all shortening as being even worse. I used only 3 cups sugar and it was still too sweet. If I were too do it again, I would stick with the oldie but goody, all butter icing, with milk instead of water.

I took the advise of some other reviewers and used less powder sugar as well as using some butter in place of some of the crisco and I gotta say, this stuff is gooooood. Not too sweet in my opinion. Just right :)

I gave it 3 stars simply because it's easy to make. The problems I had though is that it's somewhat greasy, tastes too much like the confectioner's sugar, and is not good to work with to actually decorate a cake.

This might be fine for decorating a cake, but I don't think it's meant to be used on the whole cake, which is what I did. I prepared it exactly, making sure to thin it per the instructions. It tastes like very sweet Crisco. Won't use this again.

This recipe was good for coloring and icing the cake.  However, it tasted very greasy because of the shortening.  If you don't like that "thick on the tongue" taste, I would recommend Martha Stewart's Swiss Meringue Buttercream.

Even though I'm just starting out, I found this icing a little too sweet. But my mom and my sister found it perfect. It went well with the cake. Besides the sweetness, it's one of the best homemade Icings I've tasted.

It's great!  I have to make a birthday cake for my friend's surprise 30th birthday party, and I have been looking for the perfect white icing.  I have sampled many different recipes . . . and this is the winner!

Very easy!!! Added a little extra water but not quite the 3 tbls suggested. Used it for decorating cupcakes. Loved the texture. Might try it with 1/2 butter, 1/2 shortening next time.

This was terrible. With much modication I'm not even sure it will help this recipe.  It could be the shorting that gives it the bad taste. I will not try again.

Great for cake decorating.  I thinned part of it with milk and used it to cover the cake and used the thicker frosting to add decorations.

It's my default icing.  Although I whip it into a chocolate icing when I feel the need rather easily.  A great recipe!  Thanks!

I have made this icing several times now and it always is a success.  First time I used it to make a barbie dress-birthday cake.  It was perfect as "glue"  Nice and thick-pumps out easy.  Can't say enough good things about this icing.  Would not use as an icing to just ice a cake-little thick-but still OK-just would probably use a thinner one to get a smooth look.

I followed all the directions, and it was still too stiff, even after whipping for over 5 minutes.  I thinned it just slightly and it was perfect.  I made this strictly for decorating a cake, and it tinted wonderfully.  The flavor was just so-so.  It's definitely better for decorating.  I didn't have butter on hand (due to sending the hubby to the store instead of doing it myself), but I'm sure the flavor would be much better with softened, salted butter.  

I'll use this one from now on when I decorate.  It was just super easy!

Unfortunately, I wasn't overly impressed with this recipe.  I followed the suggestions of some previous posters, opting to use half shortening and half salted butter.  While it was easy to make and did create a nice bright white base which took on colors easily, the taste just didn't do it for me.  It was really greasy and not at all what I look for in a frosting.  It worked well in my piping bag and all of my decorated cupcakes looked good, but I was hoping for a better taste.  So my search continues...

The only thing I changed was using half crisco and a stick of butter.  It "melts in your mouth" better this way and taste great.  Thanks for the recipe idea, everybody loved it.

I used half Crisco and half salted butter.  Also added some almond extract.
I like it much better than the all Crisco icing I've been using for years, and the butter did not affect the whiteness of the icing.

This recipe was like magic- it was my first time using shortening so I was a little scared that it wouldn't turn out right- but all of a sudden a bowl full of shortening-crumbs turned into beautiful white frosting!  I'm not sure if I put in the right amount of sugar and it still tasted delicious!

Excellent frosting.  I added about 1 tsp of 'imitation butter extract', which is only slightly yellow, to reduce the shortening flavor.  The icing was still stark-white, but had a better flavor. Beating it longer really does make it super-creamy, and I think that it is better the next day.

Great, also works with butter (if you don't need a pure white icing).

Use your finest beater in the mixure, so it beats smooth, beat on high and several minutes, and for God's sake, don't forget to SIFT THE POWDERED SUGAR. Not doing so is how you end up with lumps. You can also pre-dissolve it in a tiny bit of the water, if you are careful.

However you prepare it, if it's too runny just gradually add some more powdered sugar. Logic!

This really is the best white icing ever!  It's exactly what I've been looking for but could never find.  I did use 1/2 shortening, 1/2 butter, and it turned out perfectly.  Yummmm...

This really is the best and simplest.  I quartered the recipe for my cupcakes and used butter instead of shortening.  This produces a cream coloured icing.  VERY yummy! Thanks!

Excellent icing. I mixed sprinkles in with it for a kid's cake, and it was fun. Using non-clear vanilla extract did not make it off-white at all, but it could have just been the lighting in my kitchen, I never saw it in natural light.

A quick, easy and WONDERFUL frosting. I used milk instead of water and almond extract instead of vanilla. The more you beat it the fluffier it gets. It really makes your cakes look like a professional baker made it.

This is the icing I have been looking for!  I put it between 2 chocolate chip cookies and make my own Double Doozies (Great American Cookie Co.)!  Although, I did have to add more vanilla and more water to thin it out a little...it is a great icing!  This one's a keeper!

I used this frosting to make a traditional coconut cake, and I think this frosting worked well with the coconut. This may sound odd, because the cocnut was sweetened, but the coconut actually helped cut the sweetness of the frosting. 
  Without the cocnut, I wouldn't have liked this recipe nearly as much because I don't care for the greasy mouth feel of vegetable shortening. For this reason, I opted to use half butter and was very glad I did. I was afraid the butter would tint the frosting yellow, but even using half butter kept it white.
  The recipe suggested cutting the frosting with water or corn syrup if using as a regular cake layer spread, but I liked it just as is. If my frostings are not extremely thick, they tend to run away from me on the cake and I lose control. Besides, my motto is, if it doesn't have an inch of frosting on it, it's not really cake.

VERY SMOOTH... I love this frosting recipe...

However I did substitute half of the shortening with COCONUT OIL... as well as leaving out the vanilla so that we could simply enjoy the coconut flavor from the oil... This frosting felt as though is simply melted in your mouth... Thanx so much for a great new recipe to share with my 3 boys... OMG it came out AMAZING!!!

Wow... this is easy. I don't like the all shortening part so I did mine all butter. 3 cups of sugar and 1/4 cup corn starch. Double the vanilla and no water or corn syrup. I just added sour cream till I liked the consistency. This is now a keeper !! Oh and I followed missyvixen1217 and added some salt. Had to grind it a bit to make the grains small enough.

I made this icing for a cake I made and it was so sweet and it tasted all grainy from the sugar and I only added 2 cups of sugar. It made so much icing.

The icing it's self tasted great. It makes for an amazing base! Although, I reduced the sugar amount to 2 1/2 cups, because I feel the icing would be too sweet if it had more. When I was decorating my vanilla cupcakes with this icing, the icing almost fell apart. I used all butter and 1 teaspoon of pure vanilla. It was just as white and tasted fine. I'll probably use this recipe again, and add something to give it a little more flavour. :)

I did not care for the shortening taste. It was creamy for me and had a nice consistency and went on well. I just prefer a more buttery taste. I won't use it again.

This is my first time ever making homemade icing. It was perfect. Just enough sweetness. I used butter as a substitute for the shortening and I also used real vanilla extract. The dark color did not give a hint of color change the white icing. This was great for me

Love this recipe!  So fast and easy and has a great whipped texture....I made a few changes: cut the recipe in half (perfect for 24 cupcakes), used 1/2 shortening and 1/2 butter, and 1/2 t. of almond extract instead of vanilla.

I just made this icing to ice cupcakes! I added two tablespoons of water to make it a bit thinner, mixed it by hand with a fork and then added 3 big tablespoons of natural smooth peanut-butter - and let me tell you, people - it is SO GOOD!! i shredded a little dark espresso chocolate over top and we now have a kitchen full of gourmet cupcakes to enjoy! YUM! thanks!

This was very good, but I didn't have shortening, and so I put margarine in it.  At first I didn't know that you were suppose to whip it for 5 min. but after I did do that, it was great.  It wasn't white, because of the margarine but it was GOOD

I love buttercream icings, so I wanted to have some butter flavor in this, but keep it a nice white icing.  Subbed in 1/4 c salted butter, 1 tbsp milk, and 1/2 vanilla, 1/2 almond extract.  Reduced shortening to 1/2 c and sugar to 3 1/2.  Definitely needed to add water for texture, but milk gave it a creamier flavor.  Would definitely make this again, probably play with different clear extracts/flavorings.  If you're looking to decorate a 2 8" rounds, you'll need to 1.5 or 2x this recipe. With my slight reductions, it was barely enough to fill and frost. 

Great recipe!

This is a good basic recipe. I used half shortening and half butter. Once the frosting was set, I mixed in 1/3 cup of coconut. I used the frosting to top 20 white cupcakes.

This recipe started out perfect! It wasn't too runny, but not to thick either.......then it started to melt. It was just sitting out for a couple of minutes and it became pretty runny. It still had a good taste but I would recommend using it ASAP after you make it. Overall, good recipe. Thanks!

Simple and delicious frosting. Tastes JUST like what you get at the bakery. I used the regular brownish vanilla extract and you couldn't tell a difference. Don't bother buying the clear imitation vanilla flavoring. My kids enjoyed squirting the icing on the cupcakes after I put it in a sandwich bag and cut off the tip so they could squeeze it out. This one is a keeper! 5 out of 5 because I needed a homemade icing without soy products that my kids would like. A homerun!

Excellent!  I make the One Bowl Chocolate Cake III from this site all the time and decided to make my daughte's birthday cake with it so I needed an icing recipe. I tinted it pink so I wasn't worried about it being bright white, so I uses all butter and regular brown vanilla. It was excellent!  Everyone was impressed with my pink 2-tier "from scratch" birthday cake!

I had to make a cake for a girl at work.We forgot her birthday today. We remembered everyone else.(I know, that is so bad) So I wanted to make her a homemade cake and icing. She likes sweet icing. So this is perfect. I whippped it in my kitchenaid mixer. It was light and fluffy. Thanks for a great icing recipe. We ordered her flowers too. NOONE gets flowers. LOL

This is a great basic that can be altered.  I used unsalted butter but when found it too sweet, I added a little salt.  I also used lemon juice instead of vanilla.  This is quick, easy and the consistency can be changed with a little water.  Yummy!

I did not care for the taste of this icing. I followed the recipe exactly. I didn't think it was too sweet it just tastes too much like grease. The consistency is fine though. I bet many of the of reviewers that had trouble in that area used granulated sugar in place of confectioners sugar.

This recipe did not work for me. It tastes like pure lard with sugar, basically. its lumpy, i mixed it in a kitchen aid for about 8 minutes at least, and then 5 by hand. i know i am only 16 and a "beginner" and all, but this was just sad :[ I don't recommend this icing.

The name fits perfectly (Best White Icing Ever)This icing was great and sooo easy to make. I only made 2 changes instead of 1c. of Shortening I did 1/2c. Shortening and 1/2c. butter and then I used 1 teaspoon of Almond extract instead of vanilla extract. I also noticed if you are using this icing for whole cake you need to add a little water. I will use this recipe from now on my whole family loved it.

this recipe was my first attempt at making icing! and i must say its really really easy. I did substitute the water for milk and also used all butter instead of half shortening half butter. It turned out alright! :D YAY! 
It does get a little watery at the edges like one of the other member said. but all in all, i will make this again! :)

Very easy to make. I've never made icing from scratch, and it was so easy. Loved it! I did substitute 1/2 c. butter for 1/2 of the shortening. Worked well.

Wow I could eat this straight!  This really is the best icing ever! well, with using the modifications suggested.  I used half baking margarine and half shortening (would've used  salted butter if I had it, I'm sure that would taste better), and milk instead of water, and a day later in the fridge it is still fabulous! Be sure your butter and shortening aren't old, they absorb flavors and odors of your pantry and fridge.

This is a good basic recipe, but I can't justify giving it 5 stars. Made it twice and took the advice of others the second time and adjusted the sugar to 3 cups and used 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening, but still something wasn't quite perfect.

This was the best! I followed the recipe, except I did take the advice of missyvixen1217 on the part with the 1/2 shortning and 1/2 salted butter.  I tried it for the first time today and cannot keep the kids out of it!!! Thanks so much. I'll keep this one on file!!!!

I was in a pinch with my frosting situation, when I came across this recipe.  I was able to make up the frosting and frost the cake in less than 20 minutes.  It is not just quick, it tastes great too!

Fantastic recipe. So easy! Brilliant on chocolate cupcakes and then with a cherry on top. The only reason I am giving 4 istead of 5 ticks is because it didn't set/dry out very quickly.

I made it with half shortening and half butter.  It holds color well and the cupcakes that we iced looked beautiful. However, it is not as creamy as I am used to and very sweet.

Perfect.  Everyone loved it!  For Valentines Day, I added different flavor and color (cherry, orange, lemon and lime) for different conversation hearts, we left some of the icing white and wrote conversation heart messages on them.  They were stunning and fun!

This recipe was wonderful. My son is allergic to dairy products, so I needed an icing that did not have butter or milk in it. This one worked wonderfully on his special (no dairy/no eggs) cupcakes. It spread easily, and it tasted great. I cut the recipe in half and it worked just fine. I will be making this recipe for every special event from now on.

I only did a half-recipe of this, and I still had plenty left over after frosting a two-layer 12" cake! In addition to halfing the recipe, I used half shortening and half butter (a quarter-cup of both), and I added a tablespoon of water and about a tablespoon plus one teaspoon of corn syrup. This thinned out the frosting and made it taste less like buttercream (which I don't much care for) and made it much sweeter - too sweet, in fact, for me, but the rest of my family adored it.

While I am a 73 year old male,I only started cooking 3 or 4 years ago & have had my share of flops with Icing.  My Springer Spanial could make this one it is so easy. I used some of the suggestions & they must have worked.  Everyone loved the cake. (Devils food )

Absolutely delicious!!! I didn’t need whopping 4-5 cups this recipe makes, so I cut it into 1/4. This was very easy and it turned out really good. The point about adding corn syrup if you are just icing a cake rather than decorating was really helpfull and turned out great. This isvery good !!!

I halved the recipe and used only butter and followed the rest of the instructions to the T, but it came out crystalized, clumpy and very runny.  It didn't look that way at first, but after a minute or two of sitting waiting for the cupcakes to cool, it became that texture.  I don't know if the bowl I used to mix it was too shallow or if I wasn't using a high enough speed on the mixer, but it was definately NOT creamy and smooth to texture.  The taste was great, though, so I still used it with the dark chocolate cupcakes, but I ended up dipping the cupcakes into the mixture because the clumpy runny crystalized icing was too thin to spread with a knife.

The fault here lies with the me and not the recipe.  I will try this again and use the half butter/half shortening suggestion!

I love this icing. It tastes great. To me it's like the kind of icing you find on cakes from a bakery but with out the greasy feeling left in your mouth. I too used 1/2 shorting and 1/2 butter and it was still bright white. Thanks Meghan for posting your recipe.

This icing was just perfect with the Moist Yellow cake recipe. For the shortening I did half butter and half Crisco. My co-workers could not believe the taste. I also added a little more water. This recipe will be my frosting recipe for all my baked goods!

Very quick and easy to make, but it was a little too sweet and too dry -- not creamy enough to form good letters on a cake.

A perfect go-to recipe In A pinch! A bit sweet, no doubt but can easily be rectified by  what kind of "cake" or recipe you use it for.
It's also a great base recipe to add your favorite flavors !
Th e consistency ( which can be altered from stiff to a drizzle) is perfect as is!
Will definitely use again and again...

I love this icing. My family raves over it and I was asked by my dogs groomer to make his wife a cake for her birthday. I made white cake squares for them last Christmas and she loved.  I also use on my coconut cake. I add 1/2 teaspoon coconut extract as well as clear vanilla

I am allergic to dairy casein and I made this using just 3 cups of powdered sugar and two tablespoons of so delicious coconut milk in the box and crisco butter flavored baking sticks. I mixed it in a kitchen aid stand mixer and mixed it about 10 min total. I am loving how it turned out and how it tastes, not too sweet at all. This will definitely be my go to icing recipe. Thank you so much and God Bless

I have made many different frosting and decorator icings.  This icing would not even stay attached to the cupcakes.  It literally slid off the cake.  I’m throwing it out.

Great!!  I already had butter out of the fridge so I substituted for half of the shortening.  I thought it was fantastic and so did my taste testers.  I added some cocoa powder to part of it for a nice milk chocolate frosting.

Yes.  This IS the BEST white icing/frosting EVER.  Everyone raved over this frosting.   I used regular vanilla and it still came out perfectly white.  Easy to make, easy to spread, easy to color and use for piping.  THANK YOU!

I used butter flavor crisco by accident and because of that the frosting came out pale yellow instead of white.  Next time I'll try regular/original crisco and then I'll decide which I like more. My kids like it, but they are sugar addicts. I didn't expect them not to. ;)

I liked this frosting. It spreads very smoothly, but it is a bit too sweet and it took a long time mixing it before it became the the right consistency. If decorating is your top priority, this frosting is great! If taste is your top priority, you may want change this recipe a little, or choose another frosting. Happy Halloween!

No flavor. I threw in some butter, it did not help. I finally started adding lime juice to cut the sugar.  It was better, and a good accident to note is that with more liquid it fluffed up beautifully.

it was ok. but when I added butter and MILK to it I came out really good and creamy. and if you add more vanilla you get a better taste to it.

This is my favorite recipe for icing! The recipe with 1/2 butter is definitely NOT a favorite of mine. If the temperature is warm, the butter separates from shortening and the icing appears "melted", when this happens, the color (if you color your icing) separates as well and you end up with white specs rather than the intended color. It took me 4 hours to frost a cake that should have taken me an hour at most, because I had to put the icing and cake in the refrigerator every 10-15 minutes to harden it back up

This is a little too sweet, but nice none the less! It is shockingly fluffy--- never experienced that before with icing. I definitely would say it is good for a fluffy topping.

I have friends with lactose issues, so I didn't want to use my go-to buttercream recipe.  This one saved the day!  It is soooo soft and fluffy!  I used half vanilla/ half almond (because I'm addicted to almond buttercream), and I love it!  Thanks for a great alternative!

This is a fine last-minute quick frosting. I used 3 cups powdered sugar and 1/2 organic vegetable shortening and 1/2 salted butter (I was out of unsalted butter) and REGULAR vanilla since I wasn't going after a truly white color. It tastes as though I could have used 1 cup veg. shortening without a problem. I would definitely not add the 4th cup of confectioners sugar. I had to frost a cake at the last minute for a school function and this worked out well; saved the day, actually. Thanks everyone for the input on this recipe!

Loved it!! I made it as is, only adding one tsp of butter extract. I'm sure you could mix in any flavor. Might even add in  I was searching for a dairy free recipe and this surpassed my expectations on what I would find! I plan on using this recipe on my daughters birthday cupcakes (allergy friendly wacky cake) in a few weeks. This would be great for swirling on top!! I'll be sure to post our guests overall thoughts and take pics.

works great!  I used milk instead of water.  Also, with food color and various flavorings.....i.e. lemon or coconut, you can make any kind of icing you like.

I used unsalted butter instead of shortening, as it did not matter if I had bright white.  I love this recipe!  I didn't understand what all of the fuss about butter cream was until I made this recipe.  I am about to try to adapt it to make chocolate frosting & hope that I do not mess it up too much. :)  I would recommend with this as well as most frosting recipes to just add a little at a time and make sure that everything is well blended before adding more sugar etc..

This was a good frosting, Light and fluffy. The only problem I had with it was the aftertaste. I don't usually put shortening in my recipes. But it did work great for decorating my chocolate cake.

I used 1/2 of the amounts but I used all unsalted butter instead of shortening. I also used real extract vanilla because I didn't have imitation. Since I found it to be too sweet I added 1/2 Philadelphia cream cheese and it came out really good. The amount was way enough for a nine inch cake.

The icing just tasted like shortening.  Luckily, I used butter flavored shortening or it would have been even worse.  Even my kids who love basically anything with sugar did not like it.

It seems that very few of the reviewers actually used this recipe, and instead used a version of the Wilton frosting, which is half shortening, half butter (and is my all time favorite frosting recipe).  This recipe as it is written, however, has a few issues.  I tried this recipe because I needed something that would not spoil in the mail on its way to Afghanistan, and Crisco doesn't spoil in hot conditions.  Compared to the Wilton frosting, which is my standard buttercream, this was  (1) way too stiff and (2) not nearly sweet enough.  To fix it I ended up adding 1.5x the amount of confectioners sugar called for in the recipe and 1.5-2x as much water.  I think the recipe would also have been better using milk instead of water, but as I was concerned with spoilage I stuck to the water.

I found this recipe when I realized I didn't have enough butter to do my usual frosting recipe, and thought I'd give it a try.  Turned out fantastic.  I also loved the consistency of it!  I only made two changes - I used real vanilla extract (liberally - I don't measure my vanilla, and I love the flavor!) and about 1/8 of a cup of whipping cream.  Saved it to the recipe box, I will definitely pull this one out again!  I can't wait to play with flavors with this frosting!

This was horrible.  All you could taste is shortening, I even only used half shortening/butter mix.  It was very gritty, and tasted awful.

I did not care for this recipe.  I am NOT picky about sweets either.  I've liked, if not loved, every cake and frosting I've ever had until this one (from Safeway cakes to wedding cakes to box cakes to homemade cakes with various frostings).

I tried this recipe because it has no dairy.  It's easy to make and works well to ice a cake, but I do agree with a lot of reviewers that it is overly sweet and lacking in flavor, so I could taste the shortening.  I used Spectrum vegetable shortening (palm shortening) so perhaps it tastes better when using Crisco.  I used the white to frost the cake, and then added come cocoa powder to what was left, and piped brown writing onto the cake.  I definitely prefer the chocolate version, as the cocoa masks the shortening flavor.

I only needed half the amount of icing this recipe gave, so I just halved all the ingredients. 2 c. sugar, 1/2 c. shortening, etc. After mixing everything together, the icing was WAY too sweet for my taste. Since the recipe didn't call for salt, I added 3 tbsp salted butter and 1 extra tbsp of water to balance out the sweetness of it. It just needed those adjustments and it was perfect!

Did not care for this.  Followed it exactly but the shortening gives the frosting a strange texture in your mouth. The rating is for the recipe as printed. Note everyone who rated it high changed it.

This icing is amazing, simply amazing. It actually didn't work too well on my cookies, because it didn't stick to the surface very well and therefore wasn't really spreadable, but I think it would do okay on a different cookie or cake (I was using a very firm, buttery sugar cookie) or if piped on. More importantly, the icing tasted so good that I couldn't resist using it anyway, even though I had to just drop a hunk onto the cookie and smush it down. It tastes just like the cream filling in Oreos ... SO good. I'll definitely be using this recipe again.
BTW, I used this recipe as-is (all shortening, no butter) but only made 1/4 batch.

A good alternative to buttercream.  I used butter flavored Crisco. I do agree with other reviewers who say it's a bit too sweet, so I plan on playing with adding less sugar next time.  But one successful variation is "White Raspberry", which means you add 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1 1/2 tsps raspberry flavor instead of just vanilla.

I made this minus the vanilla extract plus a little bit of sour cream and a little melted butter and milk instead of water and it worked out very well.  I didn't use a hand mixer, only a fork and it didn't quite look like the frosting in the picture but I was able to drizzle it nicely on my cake. Tasted great!

Excellent! I used this on a cake I baked for a friend whose son is allergic to dairy and eggs.  I used a little less sugar, and added a little bit of water at the end when mixing to thin it out a little to frost the cake.  It was SO yummy!

I've tried using confectioner's fine sugar which was grainy even after more than 30mins of mixing.  End up, I have to throw the entire mixture and redo.  This time round, I used Icing sugar and it turns out great within 5 mins!  I've replaces 2 tablespoons of water with 3 tablespoons of milk but the icing is still quite hard for piping out.  Suggest to add more shortening and water/milk for a fluffier feel

This is an excellent recipe. As stated, it looks a little "iffy" when you start out, but mixing it for the full 5 minutes turns out beautifully. I halved the recipe and added 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon then piped it onto cinnamon biscotti. Absolutely delicious!!!!

Great! I had less icing sugar than I thought, so I had to half the recipe. Still worked great, and I added a pinch of each, cloves, allspice and cinnamon. Yummy!! My toddler loved it! I found it sweet, but no sweeter than any other icing, and by adding the spices, it helped to balance the flavors out. Also I used 1/2 lard and 1/2 salted butter.  I will use this one again for sure!

Easy recipe, very flexible.  Took others' suggestions and substituted half the shortening with butter.  Also added only 3 cups of powdered sugar, but I love sweet stuff so I think it probably would have been good with 4.  Easy to tint and decorate with!

I made this with butter since I worried my shortening had turned.  It was very good, and has a nice light texture.  You can still feel the powdered sugar texture, so it's not one of those creamy icings, but it's good :)

I halved the recipe, since I only wanted to ice a strawberry sheet cake, and used 1/2 shortening and 1/2 butter, as other reviewers have suggested. I only had unsalted butter, so I added about 1/3 tsp salt, which cut the sweetness a little, also. It turned out very smooth with a sweet, but not-too-sweet, taste!

A really good recipe.
Last time I made it, it was too greasy, so this time round I took the advice from the other reviews and added half shortening and half butter.  The only only problem is that the icing is no longer pure white.  I forgot that butter in the USA is much much paler than in the UK!  It did taste much better than last time though!

Beautiful icing for cupcakes.  I added a little milk as to pipe through a bag.  I placed on white cupcakes and tasted great with the cake itself. I am fond of buttercream but this has a great appearance like that of a professional bakery.  The kids love it.

This icing was great with a few modifications.  I had to soften it up with lots of corn syrup and water because 4 cups of icing sugar was too much.  Otherwise, it would have been great for frosting borders, but I wanted to spread it all over the cake.  Simple and basic, I think this can be used to build on.  I used almond extract instead of clear vanilla.  It makes a huge difference, because I feel that artificial vanilla doesn't come through and is tasteless when used in icings.

Perfect! I made a half recipe. I used half butter and half crisco and 1/2 teaspoon almond flavoring. Very sweet, but I like frosting very sweet.

This was really easy to make and worked great.  One caution is make sure you don't add too much liquid.  I thought it was a little thick so added some more water an ended up adding too much.  I will be using this recipe again for sure.

This is definitely the best white icing ever.  I can't buy store-bought bakery cakes because my son has Celiac Disease and can't have anything with wheat.  He always comments on those cakes so I wanted to find a frosting that is the same as what he sees at birthday parties and bakeries.  I was not disappointed.  It's super easy to make and frost.  Thanks Meghan!

It tasted too much like the powdered sugar and shortening. I followed the recipe exactly and used my electric mixer to make sure it was combined well.  It worked for the cupcakes though... 6 year old kids aren't that picky ;o)  I think it would be better with less shortening, and do half and half butter and shortening.

Excellent decorating icing, it really holds it shape. But once it's covered it softens up. I added a little more milk when mixing and added peppermint extract and cocoa. Very tasty!

I made to decorate a Fourth of July cake.  It tastes like the bakery bought frosting.  It's really sweet but very good!  The kids loved it and so did the adults. I used 1/2 shortening and 1/2 butter and a little extra vanilla.

Fabulous frosting!! I used the half butter half shortening directions - only had salted butter, but that worked out just fine.  My family and I like the "greasy frosting" you get on bakery cakes - and this was similar to that, only better!  Thanks for the recipe.

tastes just like the kind of icing that you would find at a supermarket, in the plastic tubs - yet it has a good home-made taste.
will use again.

MmmmMMmmm!  This frosting really is white!  I love to cook and my younger cousins love to cook with me. Usually I dont let them help because they make a mess but this was sooo easy and quick and tasted great (cousins ate it out of the bowl hehe).  I recommend this recipe to anyone that has low ingredients and wants a get tasting frosting thats easy to make.

I have only used this icing once so far, and already have requests for the recipe. 
I used the half shortning half butter suggestion and used it on a carrot cake!
Excellent icing, it is all I will use from now on! Thanks!

This was very easy to make.  My husband like it and he doesn't like icing usually. It wasn't very easy to get it to stay on my cake however.

Very easy to make.... colors well.  It's a bit sweet & sugary, though, so kids will probably like it more than adults will.
