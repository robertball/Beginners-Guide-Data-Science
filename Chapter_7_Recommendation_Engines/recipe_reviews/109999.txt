Not something I would make again. The dressing has too much vinegar and the taste is overpowering.

The dressing is delicious, but the salad itself is a bit boring for us. Next time, I'll use mixed greens and add black olives and red peppers.

Dressing was bland.  Mostly tasted like tequila.  Needs to be pumped up a lot to be a good salad.  I added black olives for more flavor.

Lovely, refreshing and crunchy. I added a bit of brown sugar to the dressing to make it a little less tart. It was great with a hot barley and butternut veg dish

This was pretty good! I used red onion instead of green onion.  I agree w/ others that said the tequila was a bit strong, but hubby liked it, lol. I may play around with this a bit more...Thanks for sharing. :)

I needed a quick salad for dinner and someone from ‘thebuzz’ posted this recipe and I had all the ingredients.  It came together quickly and had very good flavor.  For me the tequila taste came through ‘loud and strong’, DH could taste it, but thought it was the right amount taste.  A good salad, just not my favorite.
