This was really good. I made the recipe with a few changes. I cooked the veggies first and removed them. Then I cooked the meat. When the meat was browned I added the veggies back in. I then added a couple of Tbls flour and mixed that around.Then I added a couple of cups of beef broth and stirred to make a gravy. Then added the rest of the seasonings. I cooked up some elbow macaroni and added that. The family loved it and so did I. The flavor was awesome.

Excellent recipe and scrumptious.  I made it without the jalapeno and green beans, but added some Tabasco sauce to give it the extra bit of flavor.  Very satisfying meal.  Next time I'll serve it with rice.

This recipe called to me b/c the ingredients sounded like just about everything that I put into a Cottage Pie (minus the mashed potato topping.) Once it was prepared (exactly as written, w/ the minor exception of more green bell pepper than red), I was disappointed to find that it tasted like a vinegar-ey, sugar-ey hamburger stir-fry. My husband gave it a 4 (although he stuffed his servings into a warmed tortilla w/ salsa and cheese), my 3-year old wouldn't touch it, and I gave it a 1, so we'll settle for 2 stars. Perhaps w/ some substantial changes that would either turn it into more of an actual stir-fry, or into a Cottage Pie, I would've enjoyed it more, but as written, I just couldn't shake the over-powering taste of vinegar and sugar. Thanks for giving me a chance to try something new though!

The picture alone caught my attention. I wanted to find something different to cook and this looked fabulous. Since I am feeding a house of 7, I thought it wouldn't be enough so I put it on rice. Absolutely amazing.

Thanks for a great recipe. My constant complaint about my own cooking is it all tastes the same -- but not a problem with this recipe! I made changes based on my tastes and the veggies I had to use (only 1/2 of the meat, asparagus instead of green beans, kernels from a leftover ear of corn, 1/4 tsp of crushed red pepper instead of jalapeno and no sugar). I also appreciate this being a one-pot meal and very easy.

Great meal! Very filling. Wasn't sure if it was just going to taste like wet meat when I first put it all in the pot, but it turned out wonderful! Very flavorful. I probably put in more vegetables and more worcestershire than it called for. Will make it again. So simply, quick, my husband devoured it all!

What a tasty way to incorporate loads of great veggies into dinner! I did double the sauce, I like things very saucy. Made some quinoa as a side, flavored with beef bouillon, apple cider vinegar, soy sauce, & Worcestershire sauce... the whole family devoured it and loved it. The only complaint I got was that it was too spicy- it was from my sister who is a baby anyway! Will definitely be making this meal again!!!

Loved this dish for its flavor and one pot ease.  I substituted ground turkey for beef, cut the sugar in half and omitted the broccoli and green beans. Served it with white rice. Now that I have tasted it I think the broccoli would work well or even cauliflour but would leave out green beans due to personal taste. Will add this to my go to recipes for weeknight dinners.

This was yummy.  I was looking for a recipe that used ground beef a different way than the norm, and I loved it!  My husband liked it too.  We didn't have green beans, but I thought it was excellent just how we made it.  Great recipe.  Good flavor!

The 2 things I changed was that used food processor to dice peppers and onion and to shred the carrots. String beans are in season so used fresh. Nice change from everything having a sauce. Would definitely  make again. So easy.

I followed the advice of other readers and added flour and beef broth and served with yellow rice.  The family thought it was great.  I also added mushrooms which gave it a new texture.

This recipe was very flavorful. I didn't have red peppers so left those out. First I cooked the ground beef in oil, when browned I removed from pan then cooked all the veggies in the pan, returned the meat then added all the seasonings. Turned out great. Next time going to try on a bed of rice!

Made this last night minus the green beans but otherwise as written.  Will make again but will cut down slightly on the vinegar other than that it was a quick and simple meal.

Interesting flavor. I didn't add the sugar because we're watching our sugar intake. Also left out the green beans. Hubby liked it and kids even ate it.

Quick, tasty and creative.  :)  The recipe is clear and easy to follow.  Thank you!!   I did leave out the jalapeno, and traded pepperoncini for the bell peppers, since that's what  I had on hand.  I'll actually go shopping for all the ingredients next time.

Nice change of pace from heavy cream based ground beef recipes.  I made extra sauce which I would recommend.  I added more veggies than called for as I liked the ratio.

Delicious adobo flavour and loaded with veggies! I used coconut sugar instead of white, doubled the sauce and added a TBs of arrowroot to thicken. I omitted the canned green beans but did throw in 1/2 cup of frozen peas and corn. I steamed covered for 15 minutes and would lessen that to 10 next time to retain a bit more crunch. This is a great clean out the fridge recipe as far as veggies go and I will be making this again. Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

Not impressed. Really tasteless. I doubled the sauce so the veggies would steam in it and would have sauce for the brown rice. It's a stir fry with Hamburger. I really don't think it works.  If I try it again, I would use much more black pepper, less sugar and thin slices of steak instead of burger.  Maybe even some Balsamic. My husband liked it but he was the only one.  Big plus is that it is a good healthy meal.

Excellent!  I searched for broccoli and hamburger and found this.  I did not use jalapeno. I used sweet little orange peppers only. I also adjusted the sugar ratio to the vinegar: 1/4 c apple cider vinegar and not quite 1/2 c of brown sugar.  That was the trick.  Taking the

The only different I did was served it over whole wheat noodles.  Which gave it  little more substance.   Served with honey garlic bread and a tomato and cucumber salad.

Initially I did not make any changes, but when the dish was done I needed to add more sugar, salt, pepper and vinegar.  I liked the variety of food in the pot and would make it again, but lacks a little flavor.

I've made this a few times and love it! I use fresh green beans and have also added bean sprouts. You can use any veggie in this for a low carb healthy meal. I really like the unusual flavour and tang the vinegar adds to the beef. If you do serve over rice then double the wet ingredients.

My husband & I were NOT happy with this recipe.  It hardly had any flavor.  We tried everything to dress it up, but it just wasn't flavorful... We put a scoop of the final product onto a flour tortilla & threw in chopped jalepenos, cilantro & red salsa.  This was ONLY to get through the food, not suggesting that it necessarily made it any better, just edible.  We usually make 3 recipes a week, so once we had cooked it, we were stuck with it in our rotation for the week.  Not cool.

Made this last night and it was very good.  It's a nice simple one pot meal with a lot of flavor.  I did add some extra veg, used ground turkey instead of beef, left out the sugar and jalapeno.  The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because my kids would not eat it.  However my husband and I really enjoyed it and we will be keeping this recipe for future meals.
