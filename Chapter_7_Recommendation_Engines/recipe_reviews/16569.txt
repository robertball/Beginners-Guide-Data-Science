I have been making these for 47 years and in the original recipe it calls for shortning with part butter. The half cup of sugar and 2 tsp of ground cinnamon at the end is only mixed and sprinkled on top of cookies before they are baked, it is not to be added to the cookie dough. These are a traditional cookie in my family and are delicious. When you bake them do not over bake, they will appear to be not fully cooked but they are, let them cool some before eating.  Enjoy!

The recipe calls for cinnamon and sugar at the end, but then doesn't say what to do with it...I rolled the (sticky!) balls of dough in it before baking, and they turned out great...is that what's supposed to be done??!

I made these for my friends and family for Christmas, and I ran into some problems. My first batch were crisp and they stuck to the bottom of the pan, even though it was greased. We added more flour (maybe a little too much) to get the dough less sticky, and to give the cookies more substance. That worked- too well. They were very floury and thick. So we added more of everything and they came out similar to the first ones, but better. I don't know if it was really worth it, and I don't think I will make these again.

Yummy cookies - my mother-in-law was transported to her youth!  A little too cake-like for my taste, but the recipe said that!  I'll be sure to make them when she visits.  Thanks!

They took a lot of time to get the cookies shaped nicely, but they got second place in the county fair! I think these cookies taste great, and my friends and family love them!

Oh my, these are so good.  A light, cakey cookie that melts when you bite into it.  Be prepared, the dough is sticky!  I made some by dropping dough balls into the cinnamon sugar, spooning some on the dough balls and rolling them around.  The "rolled around" cookies had a more dramatic look to them.  Either way taste just fine.

These cookies didn't look as "pretty" as I had hoped, and to me, tasted like  pancakes.
My family hasn't done their taste test yet, but unless I get rave reviews from them, I most likely won't make these again.

These are great cake-like cookies.  I didn't have buttermilk, so I substituted regular milk with 3 t cream of tartar and let that mixture stand for about ten minutes.  It turned out great :)

This is a recipe my great grandmother used to use, and has remained a favorite. We sprinkle the cinnamon sugar on the cookie before baking.

This is precisely double the recipe I have in my file cards. None of my family are thin so I think I'll stick with the half recipe. My recipe has sour cream as an alternate to the buttermilk.

My Mom has been making cinnamon jumbles all my life.  My kids and husband look forward to these every Christmas.  These cookies don't taste like any other cookies and that is what makes them special.  Good recipe!

These were very good and I loved the cakey texture, although I did not find them sweet enough. If you like not too sweet cookies, these are perfect! For myself, I added a tiny bit of brown sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg into the batter and it still was not sweet enough. I then made a white glaze icing similar to cinnamon roll icing and added that on top along with more cinnamon and nutmeg stirred in. The final result was absolutely delicious and reminded me of Christmas!

Awesome! I made 1/4 of the recipe. I added a little more buttermilk until the consistency was more pancake like. I spooned half the batter into a circular dish. I sprinkled 1t cinnamon, 1 T sugar, 1/8 t nutmeg mixture. Then I poured the remaining batter on top. I baked it at 375 for 40-45 minutes. It was delicious. I will definitely make this over and over. Great presentation, the middle peaks and is puffy.
