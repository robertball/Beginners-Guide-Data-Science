I followed the recipe pretty closely but used some reviewers suggestions.  I drained the sourkraut but didn't rinse it, because we like the tangy taste of the sourkraut.  I buttered rye bread slices on one side and spread Thousand Island dressing on the other side.  On the dressing side I placed a slice of swiss cheese, sliced  Pastrami from the deli and then topped with sourkraut.  I cooked them on my George Foreman grill until the cheese was melted and the bread was nice and toasted.  They were delicious!  I only gave the four star rating because the sourkraut in the middle wasn't very warm.  Next time I make these I will warm the sourkraut in the microwave first and maybe add another slice of swiss too!  If you like Rueben sandwiches you will love this one!

I work as a grill cook at Cracker Barrel, and while the Reuben is one of the most annoying things to make at a busy time, It doesn't take nearly 45 minutes to make. Maybe 5 at most from start to finish. If this recipe works for you, then good. However, we do it quite differently. We start off by putting approximately 1/4 cup sauerkraut (we never measure it, we just grab some) on the grill, and a bag of about the same amount of chip corn beef on top of that. Then we put two pieces of bread down with some butter, and put two pieces of swiss cheese on each piece of bread. Once the sauerkraut and beef has heated up for a minute or two, we put it on one piece of bread, and put the 1000 island dressing on the other piece. As I said before, it shouldn't take more than 5-10 minutes to make.

Great sandwich. The only change I made was to heat the sauerkraut in the microwave for 20 seconds before adding to the sandwich. I like my sandwich warmed all the way through. Thanks.

These were great.  I used George Foreman grill, which was easy and quick.  I donâ€™t like soggy bread, so I put the dressing and sauerkraut between the meat and cheese.  I also only used one slice of cheese per sandwich.

A good mustard is the way to make a Reuben. Down in south Alabama we did not start hearing about this thousand island business until about 10 years ago.

So good, but grilling each side on medium heat for 15 minutes each?! The bread would have been charred! Mine were perfectly browned at about 5-6 minutes per side. I would recommend keeping a good eye on your bread and toast it to your liking. Great recipe.

Hubby and I love this sandwich. I like to use the sweeter "bavarian style" sauerkraut with the caraway seeds. Somtimes I change it up and use mustard instead of thousand island dressing.

Great sandwich! The classics never die! This was so good and so easy to make. If you use good quality ingredients you'll end up with a wonderful sandwich. I used "Thousand Island Dressing II" from this site. Perfect for a quick lunch - YUM!

Well liked by all.  I also spread the 1000 island dressing between meat and cheese to keep bread from getting soggy, and agree with another review, you have to use butter, not margerine.  Use deli corned beef and you have the genuine deal here.  Great recipe!

As is this sandwich is fairly good, but with some simple tips it can be great.  You should drain/rinse the sauerkraut, and warm it up either in a skillet, or in the microwave. (If you want the kraut to be much more prominent tasting dont rinse it, but still warm it up). Also warm up the corned beef.  This ensures that the entire sandwich is hot all the way through without worrying the breaad will burn.  Also use deli style corned  beef sliced very very thinly, and put on as much as you feel is right.  Slicing it thicker makes it slip out of the sandwich when you  bite into it. Shaving the meat makes it easier to eat without losing the meat.  Reubens were invented here in Omaha where I live, and the standard is to use Thousand Island (or Russian) dressing..but I digress.  Use a high quality dressing. I use 2 slices of baby swiss-one on each side of the sandwich.  Assemble in this order: dressing, cheese, sauerkraut, meat, another slice of cheese, and on the 2nd slice of bread another layer of dressing (use as much or as little dressing as you prefer). Use butter, and cook until browned and crispy. Excellent!

My husband's favorite sandwich is a reuben, and he usually goes to a local deli for one.  I wanted to be able to make them at home for him, can I came upon this recipe--it was very well received!!  I've made it several times since I found it in early 2005, and the only change I make is to use a little more thousand island dressing than the recipe calls for since that is my husband's favorite part

DELICIOUS!!!!

This is hands down my favorite sandwich. And this recipe is great and easy to follow. I made it for dinner and it was a huge hit. I added additional cheese and additional corned beef...because I have some big boys in my family. :)

Fantastic!  I used pumpernickel bread & subbed mozzarella for the swiss (I don't normally have swiss in the house, because nobody really cares for it on a regular basis) & put some horseradish sauce on it....YUM!  Thanks for sharing Colette, we eat these often!

I used to make Reuben's in a restaurant, and I got great raves for mine.  To improve on this sandwich, I would add more corned beef, and also add an equal amount of Pastrami.  The total meat weight of 12 oz.  In the New York Deli, they put 1 lb. of meat on each sandwich.  Also mix the sauerkraut and dressing, and put it in the middle of the sandwich, so the bread doesn't get soggy.  Also, wring out the sauerkraut, so it's not wet.

If you really want a good grilled sandwich you need to brown the inside of the bread first. Then assemble and cook the outside.

Perfect, classic Reuben. In my book it's worth making a corned beef brisket (I like "Slow Cooked Corned Beef for Sandwiches," also from this site) just to make this sandwich!  As others have noted, drain and RINSE the sauerkraut and heat it briefly so that it's good and hot by the time the sandwich is done.  I used a marbled rye, which made this sandwich especially pretty.  Whether you use deli corned beef or cook your own corned beef brisket, make sure the meat is tender! There's nothing worse with a Reuben sandwich than to take a bite and pull out a big hunk of tough meat, leaving the rest of the sandwich behind! (I've had a Reuben like that in a restaurant or two...)

Edited: 4 stars because I believe you need to heat the kraut & corned beef on it's own as 15 min's cooking per side will likely burn the bread. Instead of deli meat (only 2 pieces?), I use leftover corned beef I cook at home (sliced real thin & at least layered 1/2" thick per sandwich) Warm it with kraut on top (in a covered skillet) and then assemble with the cheese prior to grilling on a skillet. Otherwise it may not get hot throughout. I also rinse and drain the kraut well to avoid too much tart or soggy bread. Personally, I dont care for a wet Rueben so I dip in TS dressing as I'm eating it. I get the bread nice & crispy over med/low heat for approx 5 minutes per side. Good basic recipe but...I found needed minor adjustments for cooking technique and skimpy amount of corned beef per sandwich as written. I sure do love a well made Rueben, YUM!

A great base recipe to learn how to make a Reuben but you gotta cook your own meat! It's too easy to skip.  Instead of deli meat, I used "Slow Cooked Corned Beef for Sandwiches" from this site.  If butter is banned at your house like it is in mine, using cooking spray works just as well to make the bread crispy.  I also used Publix 2% swiss cheese and Publix fat-free dressing.  Made a good and practically guilt-free sandwich.

This is a good sandwich.  When I make reubens at home, I spread one side of the bread with a small amount of spicy mustard in addition to the dressing.  I also only buy refrigerated kraut, rinse it well and squeeze it dry before putting it on the sandwich.  The rinsing keeps the sauerkraut taste from overpowering the rest of the ingredients.

Ingredients are fine but assembly and cooking need help. here's the secret: 
1. Heat the corned beef and sauerkraut separately in the microwave until just warm
2. Put cheese on one piece of bread, Corned beef on the other 
3. Put sauerkraut in middle with Thousand Island on it (keeps bread from getting soggy)
4. Simplify your life- don't butter the bread. Put a pat butter in the pan and melt just before you put sandwich in. When side toasts pick up with spatula, add another pat of butter turn over.
**For best results heat should be on the low side of medium-low. Use a frying pan with a lid. This holds in the heat and ensures the inside is warm and outside isn't burned.

Yummy! My husband *loves* Reubens and these got a big seal of approval from him. I followed the directions exactly and we were pleased with the results. Served with Claussen dill pickle spears, which were a perfect compliment to the sandwiches. Thanks :)

We used roast beef and dipped into 1000 Island on the side. Otherwise, this was fantastic. I drained the daylights out of the kraut, and had no sogginess. We liked the tanginess of the kraut, and texture, the extra crunch. Hubby had it with gherkins and hot potato chips. He's no fan of Swiss cheese either, but loved it. We both give it 5 stars. One note: I fried these in a skillet, like for grilled cheese sandwiches, and no way did they need 15 min each side. I had a gas stove burner on medium, laid in the buttered side down, built the sandwiches while they were cooking, then turned after about 7-8 minutes. Use an XL spatula, and feel under for crispiness... but be careful of burning your fingers in the pan. Again, LOVED this sandwich.

Great recipe!  I read other reviews for suggestions, and it came out perfect.  Like other people, I put the thousand island and the sauerkraut in the center of the sandwich so the bread didn't get soggy.  I found that it was easier to put in the center if I put the (already drained) sauerkraut in a bowl, microwaved it about 30 seconds to heat it up, and then mixed in the thousand island dressing.  I kept the grill on medium-low heat and was able to heat it up for the recommended amount of time without burning the bread.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great basic recipe for a traditional reuben sandwich.  I make some minor substitutions, following my mom's recipe:
Instead of corned beef, I use pastrami.
After draining the sauerkraut, I put it in a medium bowl and mix in the thousand island using a fork.  Other than that, I assemble the sandwiches according to this recipe, and my husband and I love them!

Just 'built" a couple of these and they are great! The kids don't like the sauerkraut, 
or corned beef, so this is a "grownup" sandwich in my house! They only took 5 
minutes per side, but I weighed the sandwich down with a heavy pan on top. 
VERY delicious!

This is the delicious recipe we use at home. We drain the sauerkraut and place it in a small saucepan on low which warms it as well as evaporates any juice left after draining it. Another taste treat for this Reuben is to try honey mustard in place of the 1000 island or regular mustard. This is a great sandwich as a stand alone dinner or lunch...Thanks much

This is really an excellent recipe, and the perfect way to use leftover corned beef.  I had lots of corned beef left from St. Pat's day celebrations, so I made this more than once; it works beautifully even with slight changes.  I had to use a different bread the second time, and used some leftover jarlsburg cheese (mild swiss) - still delicious!  I agree with the other reviewers that you should warm the corned beef and sauerkraut prior to assembly and cooking of the sandwiches, but this is easy to do.  I simply turned the oven on to 350 degrees and popped the beef and sauerkraut in it before I started getting the sandwich stuff ready, and by the time the grill was heating up and I wanted to put the sandwiches together they were nice and warm.  At any rate it worked great, although I used a stove top grill and only grilled the sandwiches for 7 minutes per side.  Longer than that and they started to burn, so I would suggest watching the sandwiches because all grills aren't equal in heating.  The second batch I also tented tinfoil over them as they cooked on the grill; this helped to keep everything toasty.  Yum!!!

Lots of tweaks are required for this receipe. First you absolutely need to drain the sourkraut. Squeeze the sourkraut out over the sink before placing it on the sandwich. If you don't do this, the sandwich will be soggy. As well you do not have to use the bread. Use any whole wheat bread and spread both sides with easily spreadable margarine. I've perfected this receipe over many tries. Feel free to use any Swiss cheese, Grieire is particularly good. I put two slices on one side and one on the other. In addition to thousand island dressing, spread the inside of one side of bread with Dijon mustard. It's delicious! The order I use is margarine on bread face down, thousand island dressing, two slices of Swiss cheese, drained sourkraut, a lot of corned beef, another slice of Swiss cheese, thousand island dressing, bread with Dijon mustard on the inside and margarine spread on the outside. Grill as you would for a grilled cheese sandwich on low-medium heat. The second side will cook faster than the first. Enjoy with a pickle.

This a great recipe. I mixed the thousand island into the sourkraut ala restaurant style. It's fabulous - the sweet dressing mixed in with the kraut.

The Rueben is one of my favorite things to order at Ma & Pop style restaurants, but I've never made one at home until today.   With all the other Rueben recipes out there, I'm glad I picked this one to try first.   It's just how I like them.   Thanks!

I used my griddle.  On one end I toasted the bread on the other end I warmed up the corned beef and the sauerkraut (drained).  I made 1000 island dressing from scratch (no egg recipe).  piled all the ingredients on the bread and finished toasting.  NO SOGGY BREAD!! Easy and favorite sandwich in our home.

This was awesome.  This recipe calls for sauerkraut to be drained.  Some people must have missed that.  I used pastrami, turned out awesome.  Used a cast iron skillet and the sandwiches turned out beautifully and oh so yummy!!!!  The layering here is good, and was the reason I looked a recipe up anyway.  Also, if you're cooking stovetop, put the lid on the pan for a bit and that will help with heating the cheese/sauerkraut.  Ours were the perfect temperature throughout.

This is a my favorite sandwich, and I really don't need a recipe to make one, but this one will suffice for the novice.  You don't need 15 minutes to brown your bread though--you'll burn it up!  And I also recommend warming the kraut first.  As for one reviewer's suggestion to use mustard--that's a matter of personal taste, I guess.  REAL Reuben sandwiches have to have thousand island dressing!

Amazing. Definitely the best Reuben I've ever had. I won't be ordering another one in a restaurant because I know I'll be disappointed. I used the "Slow Cooked Corned Beef for Sandwiches" also on Allrecipes.com which I'm sure helped make this sandwich amazing. The deli down the street claims to make the best reubens in town... well, I think I've taken that claim to fame away from them now! I've eaten them 6 days in a row now!! Love pregnancy :)

Excellent! Hubby had mustard, I had TI dressing.  Followed reviewer suggestions for warming the corned beef and sauerkraut. Next time I think I'll buy a few more slices of corned beef but we really enjoyed these as written. My mom used to make the best Reubens. These made me remember her so thanks for posting.

Very good, used pastrami instead of corned beef and used AR's Thousand Island Dressing III.  Decadent, but delicious, exactly the way a reuben should be.

This is an excellent sandwich.  Be sure to use sauerkraut in a cooled bag (usually from the deli or around the hot dog area in a store).  This is far better than the canned.

03-24-2011 Fixed this for our St. Patrick's Day meal.  The sandwich is delicious.  A reuben is my sandwich of choice in a restaurant, but I've never made one at home.  This is a great recipe to use.  It came together quickly and I cooked them on the griddle along with Swiss Cheese Potato Pancakes from this site.  Everything got done at the same time and we had a wonderful meal.  I will for certain be making this again.  Thanks Colette for posting this recipe.
03-19-16 ~ The best part of the St. Patrick's meal is the leftover corned beef - just to make a Reuben! This is a great and filling sandwich. I used two-toned bread and 'Not Thousand Island Dressing' from AR in place of bottled dressing. The sandwiches were amazing. I might be a little biased, as a Reuben is my favorite sandwich.

Fantastic sandwich!  To cut down on the fat, I used turkey pastrami, lowfat Swiss, and fat-free Thousand Island (Kraft brand is wonderful!).  I served these with "Restaurant-Style Coleslaw I" from this site.  As another reviewer suggested, be sure to heat the meat and sauerkraut before grilling.  Thanks for the recipe!

I used the recipe "slow cooked corned beef for sandwiches" from this site for this. I did butter the bread and brown it in a skillet, but then I just layered the sandwich and heated it in the microwave. The bottom piece of bread  became a little soggy but it was still delicious. The next day I put the bread in the toaster- I got a nice crispy sandwich. My husband called this recipe "dynamite!", and he tells his family all about this feast!

This is THE Reuben! Taste just as good as the diner's.  I only made one and really didn't follow the directions and it tasted great! Pressing the sandwich a bit really helps keeps everything from shifting all over the place when you turn it.  but it would be great if this was made on a panini gril also! Make sure you have the heat on low enough so it takes enough time to melt the cheese and warm the corned beef and saurkraut.  Also, I'm a butter girl, but think you would HAVE to make this with butternot margarine.

I make my Reuben this way as well.  Do warm the sauerkraut before assembling and drain it well, then squeeze it to remove any remaining moisture.  Adding a thin layer of horseradish to the meat side of the bread is a tasty addition.  If you use only one layer of cheese, it is helpful to grill the meat-only side first, then the cheese side.  This allows the sandwich to heat up so the cheese melts properly.  Mustard is also a good addition if you rinse the sauerkraut.  Otherwise, it can be a bit overpowering.  As others have mentioned, 5 minutes per side is probably sufficient.  You do not want the bread to injure the roof of your mouth! On the rare occasions my husband and I order a Reuben at a restaurant, we are usually disappointed and make this version within a couple of weeks.

The secret to a good Reuben is the kraut.  Don't just drain it; take a handful of kraut, hold it over the sink and squeeze out as much juice as possible.  Also, use a top quality kraut.  My favorite is the Claussens generally found next to their pickles in the refrigerated case near packaged lunch meats.   The Swiss cheese is equally important.  I was recently served what could have been the world's best Reuben, but they ruined it by using a pasteurized, processed Swiss cheese-like glop.  Use only good natural Swiss.

Oh, seriously delicious! I used Boar's Head corned beef (you MUST use excellent quality corned beef for a great Reuben!) and had them slice it very thin. Be sure to cover your pan while you brown these and keep them on a medium/low heat. This will ensure that the sandwich is warm in the middle with nicely melted cheese and perfectly browned bread. (15 minutes per side is waaayyy too long, so disregard that in the recipe directions.) I am not a fan of Russian dressing, but love TI, so that is what I use and enjoy on this sandwich. Oh, and rinsing the sauerkraut is a must unless you adore it and love a very strong taste of it in your sandwich.

We prepared this tonight.  What a treat.  We used American Cheese instead of Swiss.  It was absolutely the best Reuben I've ever eaten.  Try it, you'll love it.

great recipe....however....use home cooked corned beef.  Not any extra trouble.  Fix corned beef and cabbage on Sunday, Reuben sandwiches on Tuesday.  Otherwise, use the recipe...AS IS.  You'll be happy.

this is the same as my moms recipe and i have been making them for 20 years, if you put a lid on the pan while toasting the sandwiches, the whole sandwich will be hot and the cheese will be melted. so wonderful and easy!

I really don't care for anything on this sandwich but I love them all together!  I prefer to used Carl Budding corned beef and I use Miracle Whip instead of Thousand Island.  I alway plan to eat these while my husband is away, this is one thing he doesn't care for that I absolutely love!

This was pretty good, but my kids hated the Thousand Island dressing!  I will just leave that off next time.  When I toasted them in a big heavy skillet, I also weighed them down with another pan and a big heavy can inside the pan.  They came out nicely browned and all the "goodies" stayed inside the bread.

If you follow the recipe like it says it will turn out perfect, the reviews are just repeating the same thing, most of them say to drain the sauerkraut which is specified in the ingredients list. The cook time says 15 min per side on medium heat so that the insides are warm all the way through and the bread isn't burnt. Othere reviewers weren't being honest with the Stars because they wanted to take a short cut method or not fully read the ingredients list or instructions. If you want a 5 star meal follow everything it says and pay close attention.

Love Reubens! 15 minutes per side is definitely too long for this, but the ingredients and method are spot on. I did a quick pickled cabbage instead of sauerkraut and some leftover corned beef with rye/pumpernickel bread. So yummy! Thanks for the recipe!

Wonderful sandwich! This is how we make ours ingredient wise. However, instead of deli corned beef, we always use any left over corned beef from St. Patrick's day to make our reubens. We warm everything up before creating this masterpiece of a sandwich!

Great sandwich! I used more meat and sauerkraut with seeded rye sourdough bread and fried them in the frying pan. They turned out great, my husband and I loved it. Next time i'll try it with a different type of sauerkraut and with pumpernickle bread.

Classic!  Make sure to cook these slow so the meat heats and the cheese melts.  Nothing worse than crispy bread with cold fillings.  I make my own Thousand Island using "Thousand Island Dressing II" from this site because I hate buying a whole bottle just for Reuben night.

Absolutely delicious and EASY!  I am obsessed with Reuben Sandwiches, and this is better than anything I've ever paid for in a restaurant.  One thing I'll do next time is melt butter and brush onto the bread...it's just hard to flip on the griddle when the butter is still in cold lumps :)  That is ALL I am changing though!  Kudos to Colette, this is wonderful!

A classic and very good.....I am basing my review on having my share and knowing that this sandwich is amazing. On another note....I am not sure what the problem was with the corned beef I had purchased at the deli the other day....looked and smelled great....was very excited to eat the final product and hubby and I were just disappointed that the meat was extremely rubbery and hard to bite into let alone chew.....all in all.....definately not the recipes fault or an error of mine....just a nasty cut of corned beef....lol.....thanks for a great recipe though!

I made these for my dad's bday lunch- reubens are his fav- and everyone LOVED them. I used reduced fat mayo in the dressing, reduced fat swiss, and Brummel & Brown spread (just happens to be the spread I always buy) and they chowed those things! I am a vegetarian, so I can't tell you personally, but I did make myself one sans corned beef and it was delish.

this is an excellent sandwich! i prefer marbled rye bread for eye appeal & russian dressing (when i can find it). you can also cook a corned beef brisket for dinner & slice the leftover meat for this recipe instead of spending extra $$ at the deli. thanks colette!

Excellent! It came out just like the picture. I had never had corned beef or sauerkraut before and am not fond of thousand island, but the flavors blended together were great. I've made it 2 nights this week. so simple!

classic sandwich...Great taste.  15 minutes is a little long, 5 minutes per side is more like it.  Try it you'll like it.  Don't forget the dill pickle.

YUM! I just got finished eating this!

I made mine this way:
Buttered the Rye Bread, but a slice of swiss on one piece of Rye, 1000 island on top of swiss, spread the kraut, rolled 4 thin slices of Corned Beef and put them side by side on top of the Kraut, put more dressing on top of beef (I LOVE it messy) and then another slice of swiss before topping it with Rye.

Cook just like a grilled Cheese.

A good tip is to really heat up your pan before cooking.

Thanks for the recipe!

Even though I don't much care for Reuben Sandwiches, my hubby just loves them.  He says that these tasted just like the ones he ate in NYC, which is praise of the highest order!!  I will make these for him every year on his birthday from now on...thanks so much Colette!

I used marble bread instead (a mix of sourdough and rye), and it was absolutely delicious; it was probably the best reuben Ive ever had! 10/10 would make again.

Yes, this is pretty much how to do it, but I also heat up my kraut prior to grilling the sandwich. She must cook on a very low temp to cook 15 on each side. After reading Mr. Wonderful's comment about mustard, I am tempted to try a bit of Dijon in my 1,000 island since my husband just loves mustard. Why not?

Try cooking sauerkraut.  First rinse kraut. In frying pan place one diced onion and 4 tbsp butter. Cook on low till onion is translucent.  Add 16 oz kraut and cook on low med heat for 10 to 15 min. Add brown sugar to taste and cook another 5 min. Takes sour out of the kraut

Awesome with the leftovers from mauigirl's Braised Corned Beef Brisket.  I did cook an onion in a little olive oil and added the sauerkraut to warm through.  I used Not Thousand Island Dressing by Mike Harvey, dePITA.  Cannot wait for my next homemade Reuben, thanks ColetteG.

Great recipe! The only change I would make is to spread mayo on each side of the bread, then toast one side of each piece.  The toasted side will become the inside of your sandwich when you grill it.  Two great things happen when you do this: first, the bread is nice and crisp on both sides and soft in the middle; second,the toast has a little bit of a sweet taste to counter the tartness of the sauerkraut. Try it once and judge for yourself.

This was a wonderful sandwich, can't wait for my daughter to try it.  I usually make corned beef and cabbage but this time I wanted to use my corned beef a different way.  I'm so glad I found this recipe, I will make again!

So delicious. My boyfriend gobbled them up. I used pepper jack cheese instead of swiss for a little extra spice. I also grilled using my George Foreman grill. They only took minutes this way.

I have to take responsibility for using the dressing which I do not care for.  Love Reuban sandwiches but the dressing ruined it, for me.  Instead of butter I brushed the bread with olive oil. If you have a George Foreman grill it does a great job on this classic sandwich.

Someone mentioned that Thousand Island dressing is a "new" thing on a Reuben, and it is.  In the olden days we always used Russian dressing on a Reuben, and I still do.  There are several good recipes here for Russian dressing, some really easy and some taking a bit more time and effort.  Try them and choose the one You like best, I did!

pretty good just something missing - maybe it's the just the 1000 island dressing i used - i just felt like the whole sandwich lacked flavor - maybe there needs to be some additional seasoning added or make your own 1000 island

My husband is a Reuben snob, and he loves this recipe.  I make them with our corned beef left over from St. Patrick's Day.  My tips are to make sure you use high quality sauerkraut, and cook the sandwiches on LOW for 15 minutes on each side.  That way they are hot all the way through, but not burned.

Now my husband doesn't have to order it at every restaurant we go to searching for the "perfect Reuben." He says "This is IT." We prefer Pepperidge Farm's Pumpernickel/Rye Swirl. Like mominpa I warmed the meat and kraut briefly in microwave before grilling sandwich. Libby's Crispy Saurkraut,& homemade Thous. Island Dsg. I find 5 min. grilling on each side sufficient.

You can't go wrong with these and you can't mess them up.  We nix the sauerkraut and sometimes use Provolone cheese instead of Swiss.  We also use our panini grill to make them.

Used the recipe on this site for "chilled Russian salad dressing" instead of just plain thousand island, but kept everything else the same.  This was so good, as close to the Carnival Cruiseship Reuben sandwich!

Absolutely delish! I used german rye from the bakery, claussen sauerkraut (refrigerated), and a heaping helping (1/3 pound for one sandwich) of Boars Head Pastrami and 2 large slices of Boars Head Imported Swiss Cheese.  I used "I Cant belive It's Not Butter" Spread even though I almost always cook with butter, because it's a dream to spread on bread.  I heated the sauerkraut in the micro 20 seconds then squeezed out the moisture in several paper towels. We split the large sandwich between the two of us. Wonderful!! Thank you!

Use dijon mustard instead of dressing, and pumpernickel bread. YUM.

Great recipe. I heated everything separately though because I'm away from my sandwich toaster. Left out butter and added a bit more thousand island. Very tasty:o) thank you

Followed another reviewer's recommendation and lightly toasted bread before assembling the sandwich...that and pressing out extra liquid from the sauerkraut were great tips to avoid sugginess.  Added extra slices of the corned beef and another light layer of the dressing.  Also found this cooked better on low heat.  This recipe's a keeper!

I make the Rachel version of this sandwich using Smoked Turkey Breast, since I love this sandwich, but not a fan of Corned Beef.  I also use Baby Swiss cheese for a milder flavor and light Thousand Island dressing...it's soooooo good!

Have always loved Reubens, but learned a little "secret" many years ago from a chef while attending Food/Beverage management courses: 
1. Use French dressing rather than the traditional Thousand Island.  Different flavor altogether.
2. Drain and wash sauerkraut, and press with paper towel to dry before assembling sandwich.
3. Brown both sides of bread so sandwich is not soggy.
Just these few little changes make a lot of difference!

I mix the Thousand Island dressing with the well drained sauerkraut. It helps hold the kraut together and allows the flavors to begin marrying. The heat from toasting the completed sandwich in the pan or grill will hasten the melding of the flavors.

These Rock!!!!  Make sure to warm your canned sauerkraut.  I dumped my one can into a small sause pan and warmed it up.  I added based on who wanted a little or a lot.  :)  My picky son loved them and my hubby had a second sandwich.

My favorite sandwich of all times!! I thought you had to go out to a deli somewhere to get something this good. I like to use sourdough bread; thinly sliced. I heated the sauerkraut in a pan and lightly sauteed it with onions; then drained. I had previously cooked the corned beef in a crock pot the day before, then sliced it up and just re-heated it in the microwave. I also added a little thousand island dressing in between the meat & cheese. I tried this on my boyfriend and daughter and they absolutely loved it!! The onions with the sauerkraut made a little extra kick to it. Served with kosher pickles, potatoe chips & beer!! So........good.

I gave it 4 stars because it did taste good but next time I will read all the reviews first.  The bread did get soggy from the dressing I put on it and next time I will use a grill pan, I tried my foreman and all the cheese melted off.  Oh and I will use less kraut on everyone's except mine and my 3 yr old she picked it off and begged for more lol.

Yummmmm!   I have always loved this sandwich.   Instead of deli corned beef - I used a 3 lb  fresh corned beef brisket.  I browned it in a cast iron ceramic pot and then poured about 18 oz of beer in the pot with the seasoning pack. Cover with the lid and cook at 325 for about 2-1/2 -3 hours.  This was just enough time for it to be tender, but, not completely fall apart.  Wrap the brisket in foil and cool until sliceable.  Always slice against the grain with corned beef.  This will also work in your crockpot for probably 8 hours on low - or just do your traditional boil on the stove.  Fresh corned beef makes a world of difference.  Just slice thin for your sandwich.

Thanks you so much for this recipe!! I made corned beef for St. Patricks Day, basically because I wanted left over meat for Reubens. I absolutely love this sandwich, but wasn't sure of all the ingredients. Thanks for helping me!!!

I love reuben sandwiches and I've made them before using other recipes, but I really liked how this recipe says to layer the meat and cheese and the suggestion of puting the dressing on both slices of bread.  I used to just do one layer of each, but this way is much better!

Excellent!! Made these with pastrami instead of corned beef (hubby is not a fan). Also used sourdough French bread instead of rye, and I cooked the kraut up with onions first. Cooked these on my griddle--cut the cooking time way down. Yummy!

Made this sandwich with shaved turkey instead of corned beef since that's what I had on hand. I found it didn't take as long to make as the recipe says. Hubby and I absolutely loved it! This a going to be a new regular in my house.

Excellent. I heated the sauerkraut  in the microwave before putting it on the sandwich - If you don't, The bread will burn before the heat gets to the middle.  About 2 minutes on each side at a medium heat was perfect for me. Fast, easy and delicious. If only it was healthier :(

YUMMY, YUMMY, YUMMY!!!!!  HAVE USED NEARLY ALL VARIATIONS - SUCH AS BARVARIAN SAUERKRAUT, PASTRAMI, MARBLE RYE, AND HEATING THE KRAUT BEFORE GRILLING THE SANDWICH.  IN A PINCH I HAVE ALSO USED BUDDIG SLICED CORN BEEF.  ONE OF THE BEST VARIATIONS I HAVE MADE THOUGH IS TO USE VIENNA DELI TURKEY PASTRAMI (AVAILABLE IN CHICAGO AND ELSEWHERE).  TOTALLY AWESOME!  BUT I WOULD NEVER USE
MUSTARD...................  SORRY!

This sandwich is great, but if you don't like Thousand Island dressing, just add some prepared mustard. It is great that way too. Marbled (rye/white) bread gives a Reuben a fancy appearance.

This is a great recipe.  I made a boiled dinner for St. Patty's day so I sauteed up chopped corned beef with some of the onion and potato from the dinner.  So it was almost like a hash.  I then used margerine to butter my bread (which worked just fine) and then put some of my "hash" mix on the first down side and tehn 2 slices of swiss cheese topped it with the next piece of bread!  It was FANTASTIC!!!!!  Thank you so much!

I used dark rye, Jarlsberg Swiss cheese, & Ken's Steakhouse 1000 Island dressing and made the recipe as written for a light St Paddy's Day supper.  Served with green beer. Thanks, Colette!

This is very yummie.  I used provolone cheese and pastrami.  I put it in my George Foreman grill and it went real fast.  My husband said as a side dish with this reuben I should have made a cucumber salad.  I will the next time.
We really enjoyed it.  It was better than any reuben at any restaurant.

Fantastic!  Fattening, messy, and yummy.  My husband loved every bite.  I used pastrami in place of corned beef, but it was still awesome.  Will make these again for sure.

This recipe was precisely what I had in mind to make.  Only thing...the last step in the recipe recommends 15 minutes of grilling per side...2 minutes is more like it.

This was very good! I heated both the sauerkraut and the corned beef as some advised.  Hereâ€™s a tip that works for all grilled sandwichesâ€”instead of butter, spread the outside of the bread with a thin layer of mayonnaise. It makes a lovely, crispy sandwich, and no one will guess you used mayo.

The ingredients are good but you need WAY MORE corned beef and cheese and sauerkraut to make this spectacular restaurant style. I used 1/3 lb of corned beef and 1/4 lb of Swiss cheese for each sandwich. also used marbles rye and pumpernickel bread. I cooked the corned beef and sauerkraut on skillet separate before making the sandwich to ensure heated all the way through. My husband was loving it.

My husband said this was the best Ruben he ever had.  I liked it too.  If I eat something one night I will not eat it the second night.  This one broke my rule.  We had them two nights in a row.  I made them on a Panini make.  Perfect topped with the homemade Thousand Island dressing.

I used a freshly cooked corn beef. I added a little less sauerkraut and a little more home made thousand island dressings. Two slices of Swiss was overkill... It made it too rich, something I did not believe exsisted. If I made it again, I would only use one slice of Swiss per sandwich.

Did not use as much of the dressing because my family and I don't like our Reubens too sweet.  Just a hint of sweetness is needed to flavor the sandwich perfectly. I rinsed and thoroughly pressed the sauerkraut dry, then heated it slightly in the microwave. Great recipe...our guests and family loved it!

LOVE this recipe, used it but doubled the cheese and beef and heated the kraut for 20 seconds before putting the sandwich in the skillet. Toasted on each side for 10 minutes, long enough to give it a golden toast color that's beautiful and not to dark.

Made as directed except I heated saurkraut until warm. Don't rinse kraut just drain. It doesn't take that long to brown, watch so sandwich doesn't burn.

These are tremendous. I make them with my own corned beef briskit made in a slow cooker the day before. The meat tastes better but I don't have the ability to shave it like a deli can, so there is a trade-off. Also I mix the kraut and dressing together before I spread it on the bread. The kraut stays on better that way. It helps to mash the sandwiches a little with the spatula while they're cooking.

this is a great sandwich! I built the sandwich exactly as written and it did not come out soggy at all, as some other reviewers had described. it was perfect! warm and melty on the inside, nice and grilled on the outside.  I did warm the sauerkraut in a small saucepan before adding it to the sandwich. do NOT substitute the butter for margarine â€“ the butter taste really makes a difference here.  also, the cooking time seems to be way off. 15 minutes per side is definitely too long. 5-6 minutes per side is all it needs! I have made these 4 times this month â€“ soooo good!

Great with corned beef or pastrami.  If you are making a bunch for a crowd, I find it is easier to bake them in the oven.  Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper, and put buttered sandwiches on the cookie sheet.  Bake at 450F for 5 minutes, turn Reubens over, and bake 5 minutes more.  Perfect every time.

Try doing the grill thing and put a smaller frying pan on top of the sandwich to press it down aka a panini.  If it smells like smoke, turn down the  heat.

When making mine I use two pans, one large pan for the buttered bread and the other for the meat and sour kraut. I put enough meat and kraut for one sandwich in a pan and warm it up while in the other pan I'm toasting the bread with the cheese on one slice. When cheese is melted and meat and kraut warm place meat, kraut mixture on top of melted cheese , right before serving place thousand island dressing on top on meat and close sandwich .

If you can get the deli sliced corned beef yummy! For those who live far away from shopping, you can still enjoy a good sandwich. I have used canned corned beef as we don't have a deli market available, and it still makes a tasty sandwich. We also use mustard if we don't have Thousand Island dressing handy. Love these with homemade potato salad!

I used my home made rye bread. It's an easy assembly.  I prepared it in advance, wrapped it up until we were ready to cook it, then put it on our preheated George Forman Panini Grill.

We love Reubens, I also heat the kraut & corned beef either in the skillet or microwave remember just heat don't cook! The sandwich is then warm in the middle and not cold.

Excellent recipe. I used pumpernickel instead of rye and buttered one side of each slice of bread, then laid them on the griddle with a couple slices of Swiss cheese on top and spread about a teaspoon of dressing on each face. In the interim, I heated the sauerkraut and corned beef in the microwave on high (90 seconds per sandwich's worth). By the time the beef and sauerkraut are done, the bread is toasted and the cheese is melted. Combine and voila! Reuben perfection!

LOVE this sandwich. It is now among my "quick - go to - dinners" for after a late day at work, shopping, or play.  We all enjoyed this.  Relied upon the reviews to help and used several suggestions, ie, heat the sauerkrat, and toast the bread to our liking. Really good / really easy/ really quick. This MAY just be perfect. thanks

This sandwich was excellent.  I well be serving it more often than just St. Patrick's day.  My husband loves grilled Reuben sandwiches and he thought this was great.  I used Bavarian sauerkraut as suggested and I grilled in my panini press.  They came out really well.

My husband likes Reuben Sandwiches so the pressure was on.  I used boars head sauerkraut and grilled the sandwiches for about 7 min per side(15 mins would have burned it) and the sandwich was great. I have never had a reuben before and I even liked it!! :O)

I left out cheese and butter, toasted the bread, heated the meat and saurkraut like others suggested, and thought that everything was very good (minus the extra calories from the butter and cheese). I also used pastrami, I don't like corned beef. Would definitely make again!

Sounds good, but kinda skimpy on the corned beef ( 2 slices???).  I load mine with deli thin sliced corned beef or pastrami (preferred) and use my Cuisinart "Griddler" to toast and press them.  Results are always excellent with sides of dill pickles and home made potato salad.  Never met a Reuben I didn't like.

I am a lazy young man who was looking for a quick and easy Irish food to make. So this was a perfect recipe for me as opposed to spending too much money eating a Reuben at a restaurant/ fast-food joint. I own an electric skillet and this will definitely be a repeat meal come St. Patty's Day.

I followed the recipe and turned out great. But 15 min a side would of been way to long.

Excellent, but absolutely NO WAY on the 15 minutes on each side.  Even at medium heat, my sandwiches were burned to a crisp after 10 minutes.

I put the dressing in between the sauerkraut and corned beef, which helps the bread stay toasty. Very good and easy

This was wonderfully delicious. I made this for my husbands's supper and he loved it. It is too good to be so quick and easy. I took the advice of some reviewers and heated my saurkraut, put it between the meat and cheese, and did not rinse my saurkraut. We like it tangy too. Thank you Colette G. You get 5 stars from me.

My BF is kind of a picky eater so i was worried he wouldn't like the Kraut.  After watching him eat two sandwiches I would conclude he liked dinner!! The  only thing I did different was I used Sourdough, only because I didn't have any Rye bread. VERY EASY and VERY GOOD!

Ah, the Reuben, one of my favourite sandwiches.  This is an excellent recipe as written.  I do prefer though to lightly butter my outside slices of bread with Miracle Whip.  They brown up beautifully and add a bit of zip.

A very helpful hint!!  Without buttering the bread yet, or putting on the thousand island, place half the ingredients on one side and then halt the ingredients on the other.  Broil the sandwiches so the inside gets nice and melted.  Then, butter the outsides and grill.  Then, dip the sandwiches in the thousand island.  It is so yummy this way!!!

My husband and I love reubens, so this was a great quick fix. I skipped the sauerkraut, but added a slice of provolone to the swiss.  Also, instead of thousand island, we mix salsa and ranch. Its great on the sandwich AND as extra to dip with. I find it all cooks better if you heat the meat separately in the microwave on a plate first, then build your sandwich in the skillet as it cooks. That way your cheese melts without having to burn the bread. Make sure the burner is on low, and be patient. Sooooo good when they come out though.

Everybody loved these! They were delicious, but next I will use thicker slices of meat. I made myself a meatless version with extra cheese and it was still great :) We had to use sourdough as none of the THREE stores we went to had rye! :( I'm sure they'll be even better next time around if we can actually find the darn bread!

I combined your recipe with tips from previous users. Microwaving the kraut first and using my George Foreman grill made a fantastic sandwich with very little mess or fuss. Thanks.

To cut calories, I use spray butter for the grilling of the bread, low-fat dressing, low-fat swiss cheese, and lean corned beef.  I grill mine using a press.  We like ours grilled flat like a panini.

These are really tasty, and super easy to make.  A nice change of pace from regular sandwiches.  We don't like rye bread, so I used a light multigrain bakery bread and it was great!  Makes a good light dinner with chips and a salad!

I used Arnoldâ€™s Jewish Rye (very good), Kenâ€™s Thousand Island, real butter, Boarâ€™s Head Corned Beef, Swiss cheese slices and Bavarian Sauerkraut.  I put the sauerkraut in a small bowl and heated it the microwave for 30 seconds, then grilled for about 6 minutes per side on my pancake griddle until golden brown.  Very tasty.

My hubby LOVES these sandwiches! I whole heartedly agree with using two slices of cheese, if you're splurging on a sandwich like this might as well enjoy it to the fullest! We only eat thousand island dressing on these sandwiches so I didn't see the point of buying a whole bottle. I made half a recipe that is posted on this site and it was Perfect since I was able to use dill relish instead of sweet!! Thanks to whoever recommended heating up the sauerkraut in the microwave first, I had never thought of that and it really helped :o)

The basic Reuben here is so good it would be difficult to improve...but here is my effort. I will use the Dark Rye Bread, Thousand Island Dressing, PepperJack Cheese which adds a little "sizzle" to the "tang" of the sauerkraut, and I add a bit of onion as well- Red onion, sweet onion or even green onions. Finally, sometimes I add whole green olives with the pimentos. They absolutely compliment the flavor of the kraut. I do not butter or fry my sandwiches as I take them to work in my lunch kit. Maybe that gets the sandwich too far away to be a real Reuben, but it is a wonderful variant.

Delicious!  I did not measure the ingredients because it just didn't seem necessary.  I used thin sliced corned beef from the deli and 1000 Island from a bottle.  So easy and so good!  I will definitely make these again!

This was a great way to use up our leftover corned beef from St. Patrick's Day!  I shredded the corned beef with a fork to make it easier to eat, I hate it when you bite into a sandwich and the meat comes falling out.  My husband loved this recipe so much that I plan on making it once a month.  I cooked the corned beef in the crock pot (on low for 6 hours) in Guiness Beer.  Very tasty!!

I love Reubens and this is how I make them, but grill for 15 minutes per side???  Is this a typo?  On a hot grill or frying pan mine take 2-3 minutes a side at the most.

EASY and DELICIOUS!!  I savored every bite.  I will definitely make this again.  I used pumpernickel and provolone though as substitutes because it's what I had.

We love reubens and this one was excellent.  No thousand island here. Just corned beef, kraut and swiss...so, so good.  I also weighed down the sandwiches as they were grilling with a heavy pan.  Makes them even more crispy and delicious!  Served these with the black bean vegetable soup on this site.  Very nice together.

Not sure where the "Ah" factor comes in on this sandwich.  Firs of all I used twice the amount of corn beef it called for and I wish I had of used more.  Second of all it ended up tasting just like a regular reuben.

This is a really good construction of a reuben sandwich. I used the same ingredients but didn't worry about exact
proportions. Excellent.

Excellent!  Had everything on hand but rye bread so used whole wheat.  Was still delicious.  Since I make my own rye bread I will do it soon and the first thing I'll use it for will be this Reuben.  Thanks!

Yummy! If you want to try a variant, make the "Rachael" sandwich by using pastrami instead of corned beef and cole slaw instead of sauerkraut.

This is one of my favorite sandwich!

To speed up my grilling time and also to avoid burning the rye bread, I decided to put the sauerkraut, corned beef, swiss cheese on a separate plate and heat them in the microwave and then transport them back to the grilled rye bread and spread some thousand island dressing. I also love eating this sandwich with half sour pickles.

Good, easy recipe, but you can't possibly grill this for 15 minutes per side. You'll burn the bread! Mine was more like 3 minutes per side.

These are delicious! Even my kids ate them! I am gluten free, dairy free and allergic to eggs so for myself I substituted Schar GF Artisan Baker Multigrain Bead, Earth Balance Soy Free Buttery Sticks, Daiya Swiss Style Slices and I omitted the thousand island dressing.  The result was still delicious.  Thank you!

Colette G.  I really enjoyed this sandwich, thank you for sharing !!  Key points of Yours that need to be followed is the draining of the sauerkraut and lightly buttering the bread.  Therefore you end up up with a dry grilled flavored sandwich, not a soggy one. Thank you for those reminders.  No changes here, none needed.  Oh, and of course add that pickle !

My homemade sauerkraut was ready for New Yearâ€™s Day dinner and I wanted to test it out. Store made bread, Kraft 1000 Island and this was a tasty Reuben.. not the best Iâ€™ve ever had but definitely will make again.

This was possibly the very worst dish I ever have made. One bite and the rest went into the Green Bin. It was my first experience with Corned Beef, and I can't say I became a fan.

We love this recipe! It tastes just like the both of us (from NY) would expect a good Reuben to taste :) Especially good on the daily fresh rye that I get at the bakery. Yum.

We love this recipe and make it all the time! I use fresh (Claussen's) sauerkraut and drain it by squeezing all the liquid out. I buy Boar's Head corn beef and Boar's Head Imported Swiss from the deli, both sliced on 2, Marie's gourmet Thousand Island dressing, and we prefer the dark Pumpernickel bread. I add a sprinkling of caraway seeds over the sauerkraut before cooking. I grill them on low, covered, turning them once. It requires about 10-15 min on each side, in my experience. (When I used higher temps and didn't cover it, the bread scorched and the filling wasn't heated through.) When they are done, we use some of the Marie's dressing for sandwich dip!

It was amazing!! I used Boar's Head deli slice corned beef and Swiss cheese. Starting with prime ingredients assures best results. I cooked it for about 10 min on my Foreman tabletop grill. Delicious! I've made it 2 nights already, and will finish it off tonight. Boar's Head has no preservatives.

Next  time I will add more corned beef slices and 15 minutes per side is ridiculous. Maybe it should be corrected cause there are people out there that follow recipes to the letter and they are going to end up with some charred sandwiches.

This was excellent! The only adjustment I made and would recommend is to shred the corned beef before putting it on the sandwich.

Came perfectly due to the sandwich construction, instruction. 
Will make whenever I have leftover corned beef.  Served it with cabbage soup - another great recipe find.

I'm not a sauerkraut fan so left that off. I quickly heated the corned beef in the skillet first, put aside and then assembled the sandwich for grilling.  The preheated corned beef on the skillet gave the bread extra flavor. Turned out delicious and 5 -6min tops.

Perfect! I made my own corned beef and used marble pumpernickel rye bread. I used my panini maker and did warm the drained but not rinsed sauerkraut first. It came out crisp and tasty.  Dill pickles and chips were the perfect accompaniment.

Great!. An old favorite. We sometimes make Reuben snacks/appetizers by using party rye, canned deviled ham, sauerkraut, thin Swiss - broiled til cheese melts. But this sandwich is just so so good!

Good but a little greasy, a little rich. Might be better without butter, half the cheese and less dressing.

The only way I would do this different is saute the sauerkraut until browned in some beef broth, to give it some flavor and then add it to the sandwich

It really tastes better if you slow cook the kraut for a couple of hours before making the sandwich.  Of course it is also much better if you have some course mustard mixed with some horseradish!

My wife prefers to have the kraut drained and rinsed, otherwise the smell is too strong for her.  I tend to stack more corned beef to give the sandwich that deli look.

The headline says use for leftover corned beef, but the ingredients list calls for deli sliced corned beef.

That said, using hand sliced corned beef from Saturday's corned beef and cabbage resulted is a real meaty sandwich that was very satisfying.  I do not stock Thousand Island dressing so I used a mix of sour cream, horse radish and hot spicy mustard.  I used a lot of horse radish and hot spicy mustard, but it should be "to taste".

I will make corned beef and cabbage again soon just to have left over corned beef for grilled reubens!

One of my favorite sandwiches.  I have a hard time cooking these so I've adapted...  I butter the bread, add swiss and put it in the cast iron skillet open face.  On a place I put corn beef, sauerkraut, thousand island dressing and nuke it for a minute.  When the bread is done grilling, I scrape off the meat,kraut, thousand island onto the sandwich.  MUCH easier to deal with this way.  YUMMY!!!!

This is THE perfect reuben, thank you Colette G!  Used top quality ingredients and made a corned beef just for this reciipe (have a freezer full from when they were on sale for St. Paddy's Day)  A tip for all of you who found your sammie to still be cold inside after cooking:  Cook on med-low, and COVER YOUR PAN WITH A LID.  And take your time, these can't be rushed.  This will insure that outside will be crispy and golden, but not burnt, and the inside will be perfect with yummy melty cheese and warm meat and sauerkraut.  I served these with warm German potato salad and sour pickles.  Absolutely fantastic :).  Thanks for posting!

I used corn beef  from our St Patrick Day dinner. I followed  the suggestions by others to drain sauerkraut and warm before making sandwich .  It was delicious . You can judge how long to warm sandwich on both sides. 8-10 mins on med-low. I nice change in eating.

Delicious! Heat the sourkraut first before putting it on the sandwich to grill. It will speed up the whole process and ensure that the 'kraut is warm. I will definitely make again.

Reubans are incredible.... the only thing i would change in this recipe is using real corned beef brisket... also heating the sauerkraut first helps with making sure the whole thing is heated through... so sauerkraut is good on the side... i didn't think it should take 15 minutes to brown espeically if you are using fresh cooked corn beef and sauerkraut.. just cook until toasted...

This is excellent.  I warmed up the sauerkraut in the microwave for 20 seconds.  I had no problem with sogginess by putting the dressing directly on the bread.  I made 2 sandwiches with 3 slices of corned beef on each.  Cook time was about 6 mins per side.  I served with sweet potato fries.

Great classic recipe! I stuffed mine so full that I was not able to flip so only the bottom got grilled but that was my own fault. The only reason I am giving a 4 instead of a 5 is because the cooking time is way off. 5 minutes on one side was plenty, 15 would have burnt.

I love Reubens and this sounds like a pretty good one but I feel this needs more corned beef (one or two more slices per sandwich), plus I mix the Thousand Island dressing with the sauerkraut. That sweetens up the sauerkraut a bit so you don't get that sour taste with every bite. If eating out, I usually order a small side of Thousand Island dressing.

If you like sauerkraut and corned beef these are so good!  I make my grilled sandwiches on my George Foreman grill, so they end up nice and  pressed together and super crispy.  I've not measured out the sauerkraut or the dressing, when I made reubens, just 2 slices of bread, a slice or 2 of cheese based on preference and same goes for the kraut and the dressing.

Skipped the sauerkraut and made on the George Foreman grill. This was a nice way to use up left over corned beef.

Made sandwiches with "left-over" St. Patrick's Day" Corned Beef.  Used my George Foreman grill but next time will used less butter on the bread slices.  Delicious!

This is by far the BEST recipe I have ever found for Reubens. I've always made it using Black Rye and homemade corned beef instead of deli-sliced, and it is a family favorite.  Suggestion if you're using home-cooked corned beef, press the sandwiches while they're being grilled or else they'll be too big to munch on!

Love me a good Reuben! I thought I had an excellent Reuben last time I was in NY, but I think this tops it! Now I can just make them at home. I used the Corned beef for sandwiches, recipe on this site and made a side of Colcannon. OMG, me and the hubby were in culinary heaven!!

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars even though I myself, did not like it. However, I think I just don't like corned beef and never realized (I was raised a vegetarian and some meats are still news to me). My Hub and picky son loved it however, and I could tell I should have liked it, I just didn't. :)

This is a great, basic reuben. The only change I made was to use sourdough instead of rye bread since we don't like rye. I also followed other reviewers suggestion to heat the sauerkraut and the meat before grilling the sandwich to make sure it was hot all the way through. Grilled it in our panini maker and it was delicious.

This is an AWESOME recipe. It is the same one I have always used. The only thing that I change when I make it, is I use fresh corned beef that I cook and I make my own dressing! (And add more to the individual sandwiches, based on taste.) Thank you for sharing!

This is exactly how I make my Reubens and there are always requests for seconds.  I don't drain my sauerkraut but merely shake off the excess brine before putting it on the sandwich.  Great recipe Colette!!

Yummmm!  I made these for dinner tonight and they were just perfect.  I used lower fat swiss cheese and really good beef peppered pastrami from Sam's Club.  I used the Thousand Island Dressing on here at AR and it was just perfect.  I read some of the reviews here and I never knew that you can rinse the sauerkraut so it's not so tangy.  It was the best Reuben I've ever made!

Good and classic! You may want to double up on the corned beef depending on how thin the slices are.

I made this for our family get together and it turned out great.  They said it tasted just as good as at a bistro.  I basically added a little extra of each ingredient on each sandwich and they were perfect.  I also bought rye and pumpernickel bread so my family could choose their favorite version of a reuben sandwich.  Delish!

We made these for St. Patrick's Day and they turned out great.  I made them with rye/pumpernickel bread and used butter spray instead of butter as it's a bit healthier and coats evenly.  I toasted them on our griddle at 325 degrees.  I also covered them with pot lids to help the cheese melt faster.  I would definitely recommend this recipe!

Great sandwich, but I mixed the dressing and kraut together and put between meat and cheese rather than directly on the bread.  TASTY sandwich.  Served it with Carrot, Potato, and Cabbage Soup (recipe here on allrecipes.com) for our St. Pat's dinner

Wonderful recipe!  I made the mistake of using "light Thousand Island" and my husband notice the difference. He said he lloved the sandwich, but the "sauce was a bit too watery". I noticed the difference as well, so next time I will make it just as indicated. The sandwich is so good, that it is not worst a few calories to change anything to the recipe!

I like variations to a classic grilled cheese sandwich. I left off the dressing because I am not a big fan. I like the combination and we made once with salami which tasted great too! Great dinner choice when you don't want to think too hard. Warning my kids did not like them.

I made this sandwich and it was great.  I agree with a couple of the other people, you want to warm the corned beef and the sauerkraut first, but make sure you drain the sauerkraut very well.  I would make this again and again.

This recipe is so easy and very, very good. My husband loved it. My only mistake was buying low-quality thousand island dressing, which affected the overall taste. I did warm up the sauerkraut and am glad I did. I served it with garlic-sauteed asparagus and a pickle.

Pretty good. We made it exactly as it stated and I think if we were to do it again I would not use the second slice of the swiss cheese and I would use some thicker corned beef and probably more of it. The swiss kind of overwhelmed the rest of the sandwich for us.

This was so easy to make, and a lot cheaper than buying them at Arby's!!! The only thing I did differently is I heated up the corned beef in a skillet with a little bit of olive oil before making the sandwich.

This was quite good and I will make it again. I did rinse the kraut once and heated it in a pan before adding it to the sandwich. Also, my store does not carry corned beef as a general rule, so I used pastrami in place of the corned beef. My husband absolutely loved it, as did I! I do suggest either making your own 1000 island dressing or buying a very high quality brand instead of the standard ones.

I give it the best rating because I don't want to order a reuben sandwich when I go out anymore.  This is just as good or better.  My husband absolutely loves this sandwich. I followed the recipe exactly...we love them with the Thousand Island.

I wasn't sure I'd like these but I ate the whole thing!  Very tasty.  I had a problem with the bread being too moist to toast well with the thousand island dressing and saurkraut, will just make sure it is well drained next time.

This sandwhich came out just the way my husband likes it.  We switched the corned beef for pastrami and used a dark rye, but all in all it's excellent.

This was great and I really enjoyed grilling the sandwich. We make reubens all the time but I have to say rinsing the saurekraut first and grilling made them taste so much better.

Great!  Just like I used to have them when I was a teenager.  Just couldn't remember what went in it until I found this recipe.  Thanks!

Reubens are always good, but keep lots of water handy.  Soooooo salty your ankles will swell!!
