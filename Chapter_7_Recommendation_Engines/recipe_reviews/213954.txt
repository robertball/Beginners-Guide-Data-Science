I really liked this and wouldn't change a thing next time. I did use can baby corn because that is all I have available here.

This was a good low calorie dish! I added two chicken breasts chicken and used two cans of baby corn so I doubled the sauces  to make sure there was enough. I used shiitake mushrooms which were good but will try others next time.

This turned out to be a very nice, light, tasty side dish.  Browning the garlic really added flavor!  Used chili paste in the sauce instead of an actual pepper as topping as some have recommended.  Omitted the cornstarch mix in due to the sauce having a nice consistency already.

Yum! I did omit the chili pepper as I didn't have one on hand, but I sprinkled with crushed red pepper flakes while cooking to add a little spice. This tastes a lot like the mushroom side dish I always order at my favorite Chinese restaurant.  Thanks :)

I liked this recipe, my husband said it was just ok. To be fair, I did have to make a lot of changes:  1. To make the recipe kosher, I omitted both the fish sauce and oyster sauce. I subbed the 2 of them with 1 tablespoon soy sauce.  2. When I went to cut up my mushrooms it turned out they were spoiled, so I had to use canned instead. I also used canned baby corn.  3. I threw in some cubed chicken cutlets to make a full meal.  4. I added some crushed red pepper flakes instead of the red chile pepper. I also left out the cilantro.  Overall it was good but not 5 stars. I will try it again using fresh mushrooms.

EDIT:
Tonight I made it again using fresh mushrooms- made a world of difference. I also used 2 Tb soy sauce and 1 Tb Worcestershire for the fish+oyster+soy sauce, which also made a huge difference. I added 4 chicken cutlets like last time but left the sauce the same and it was still enough. Used dried instead of fresh cilantro. Overall a healthy, filling, and tasty meal!

This was absolutely delicious! I had never used fresh baby corn, but I found some at Wegman's and decided to give this a try. I also added one bok choy to the mix, and used low sodium soy sauce. The end result was so good! Thanks for this!

I thought this was a great recipe. I skipped the corn starch and extra water. The liquid released by the mushrooms and the soy, fish and oyster sauces provided plenty. I added a small can of diced (mild) chile peppers. The next time I make this recipe, I will double it and make 8 servings.

Delicious.  I had no fish sauce so substituted two parts soy to one part lime juice.  Also had no chiles so I threw in a little crushed red pepper.  Left out the cilantro.

I made this as a side dish for the "Barbequed Thai-Style Chicken" recipe. It complemented it quite well!

This was delicious!!!! My husband thought it was good but not great but I however loved it! I've been trying to find a good asian stir fry veggie recipe to go with the Baked Teriyaki Chicken from this site!  The changes I made were adding more garlic because I love it! I also used canned baby corn because I couldn't find any fresh & have never seen it fresh. I left out the fish sauce since I didn't have any so what I did was use 2TBSP soy sauce to make up for it, I also used 2TBSP oyster sauce since I added fresh broccoli to the dish & it needed more sauce. I also used red pepper flakes while stir frying since I didn't have any chili pepper.  It was good my only complaint was I think I will add less cornstarch or leave it out all together next time. I know the sauce is suppose to thicken up a bit to stick but it was a little too thick for me. But still very good!

Stir-Fried Mushrooms with Baby Corn Haiku: "This blew us away! And I had to use canned corn. Wish I could find fresh!" I have every intention of making this again (possible w/ the addition of chicken, tofu or shrimp to make it more of an entree) as it was easy and delicious, and I'll be sure to track down fresh baby corn, or at the very least use a more interesting mushroom than the baby bellas that I got on sale. The only other change was sprinkling w/ crushed red pepper flakes. We were very surprised at how wonderful this turned out to be!

Right away I knew I wanted to make these because they feature my husband's favorite: baby corn. This recipe is so easy, and tastes like you just got it at the corner mom & pop Chinese joint. So quick, easy and economical, thanks for sharing, we will make this again!

Great low-cal, low-fat side with some asian glazed fish, but we found the fish sauce, soy, and oyster sauses to be over poweringly dark and salty so added a bit of rice vinegar and mirin to lighten it up

Very good.  Only thing was it was a bit too salty for me.  I couldn't find fish sauce, so I used worcestershire sauce instead. I will make it again.

Delicious, and definitely a recipe I would make again. The best part is, this sauce base could be used with all sorts of meat and veggies.  To be fair, here are the changes I made: chili sauce instead of the chili pepper; added 2 small chicken breasts, which made it a main dish and also gave it a good flavor.

Yummy. I add chicken to make this a main dish.
