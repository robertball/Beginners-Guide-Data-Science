This is a terrible cake. I am a pastry chef and followed the recipe as written plus my oven is well-calibrated. What I ended up with was a dry hard product that was a complete waste. Needs at least 1 cup sour cream another egg and 1/2 cup butter. Beware!

Following the recipe as directed made something more like cookie dough. Not pourable. I had to add 1 cup water. Cake turned out very dry. Maybe needs less flour and some oil for moisture.

This is a horrible recipe. It does not have enough moisture. The cake does not "pour." You can pick up the whole lump with a spoon. I actually think that the submitter must have left something out. I added milk just so it would spread and then when it was backed it had such a strong flavor of baking soda it gave everyone hartburn. Sorry

I tried this recipe after my friend told me about it. I made it for her but I used molasses and granulated sugar instead of brown sugar (1 cup mild molasses 1 cup gran. sugar = 1 cup brown sugar)and she thought it tasted even moister and more flavorful than hers!

very nice change of pace not just a regular yellow or chocolate cake. I used a purchased vanilla icing and we loved it. Has a nice crust on top making it easy to ice.

I made this cake with a few changes and it was delicious. There's definitely an ingredient missing because there is no liquid called for. I added 1 cup of milk 1 more egg made the sour cream 1 cup instead of 3 Tbsps and used 1 cup of brown and 1 cup of white sugar instead of 2 cups of brown. The cake came out moist and delicious! It doesn't even need frosting!
