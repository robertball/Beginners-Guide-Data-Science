This recipe is very tasty. I have made it a few times and it's a home favorite. I have also made it w/o the coconut milk. It is great both ways. Next time I make this I plan to add some different veggies or double the carrots & celery.

My whole family liked it alot. I made it a second time so I am updating my review. I think it was even better this time. As a final step I blended the soup briefly in a blender and we liked that consistency more.

Yummy. Not too spicy. Perfect balance of spices. I made it in a pressure cooker with chicken.

This was a little bland to me and fell sort of flat.

Good and easy! I replaced the butter with olive oil, to make the recipe vegan, and added a few extra pinches of red pepper flakes.

Fragrant, warming, and a great way to combine all the beautiful fall flavors of our CSA share. I made it vegan by subbing veggie stock and added some chick peas and potato cubes to make it a meal.
