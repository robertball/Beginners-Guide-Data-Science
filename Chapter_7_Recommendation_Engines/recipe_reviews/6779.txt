I would love to be able to give this recipe 4 1/2 stars- it is very good.  It is simple to make, tastes really good, and makes plenty.  I won't give it 5 stars because it took considerably less time to bake for me than the recipe called for, which for a less experienced baker could have resulted in burnt bread, and the rolled dough size was too vague. (I rolled it 1/2" thick and it was probably about 24" long.)

I left out the raisins (don't care for them in baked goods), let it rise in the fridge overnight (for more developed flavor),rolled it in a mix a flour and 10x sugar to make the crust more tender and left the melted butter out. It turned out nicely, and the large amount allowed for one baked loaf today, one baked loaf to freeze, and one roll of dough to freeze for another day. FYI, this is similar to the recipe I used to use comercially to bake sticky buns- it would work well as rolls.  Oh, and the milk doesn't really need to be heated. I used water and milk powder and it wasn't warm- it turned out fine.

This is the best bread in the universe!  My whole family and all my friends have become addicted to it since the first time that I made it, and now I have to bake it by the dozen!  It's moist and very flavourful!  The cinnamon swirl is the highlight, so don't skip that step!  I love it toasted with peanut butter!  It's delicious!  When I make it, I use two cups of raisins and add a bunch of cinnamon to the dough.  I also make it with half whole wheat flour.  It's the best this way.  To enhance your eating pleasure, I reccomend unrolling it as you eat it!  Aaaaaah, irresistable!  I also tried a funky variation!  Instead of putting in raisins, I used three chopped up Granny Smith apples!  It tasted great!

Oh my word is this bread simple to make and DELICIOUS!  I've already made two batches this week.  Just for any one who wants to know, this recipe can be halved and still get two hearty loaves out of it.  When halving the recipe I altered it a bit though:  I kept 1 c. water for the yeast, I kept the 1/2 c. white sugar (with dry ingredients), I added 3/4 c. raisins, not quite 4 c. flour, almost all of the 3/4 c. sugar  and all 2 tsp. cinnamon (mix to be sprinkled inside of bread).  Also, my oven runs hot so I set it for just over 300ยบ baked for 30 minutes, lightly buttered the tops and shut off the oven and let both loaves sit in there for like 10-15 more.

This was the closest I have come to making my "dream" cinnamon-raisin swirl bread that I used to eat at an Amish restaurant I where I waited tables.  I used my Bosch mixer to make it, and I substituted dried cranberries for the raisins.  
  Several things:  the dough does not get "stiff," but remains very sticky--the stickier the dough, the moister you final product will be, so don't panic if you have hands full of sticky dough.  (If you keep adding flour to make a "stiff" dough, your bread will be dry.)  Also, to save time, I warmed the milk in the microwave.  The baking time is also a little deceptive, I think.  I was worried about it getting done in the center, so I baked it the full time, but then the crust was burned (unless you like a really hard, thick, brown crust--I don't.)  Next time I make it, I will try a little shorter time in the oven.  
  The end result is great toasted; I like it with butter, plain or with pumpkin butter (a new recipe I just tried today.)  Have fun trying variations, and thanks for the great basic recipe!

This recipe is a hit!  This was my first time baking raisin bread and it turned out beautiful and delicious (I have posted pictures).  

What I suggest is to use BREAD FLOUR and NOT all-purpose flour.  My bread rose so easily and the size of each loaf was huge.  I am not a fan of all-purpose flours for bread.  I also doubled the amount of raisins and mixed them into the dough instead - this way they are evenly distributed throughout the dough and you can ensure in having some raisins in every bit!

I also increased the amount of cinnamon by a couple of tablespoons.  Also, MAKE sure to cook it for 30 minutes max, I have a strong oven and 45 min would have killed it.

Great recipe!

Oh my heck, this is delicious! Two of the loaves were devoured by my son and husband within 24 hours! It is heavenly with some real butter melting on a warm, toasted slice.  I see myself making this bread a lot for the holidays, etc.

One caveat if you make this in a kitchenaid mixer (or similar stand mixer): Unless you have the mixer withthe largest bowl (the one you need the crank to lift up) the dough will come up over the top of the dough hook.  I just kept pushing the dough back down. NOT a reflection on the recipe; it's just a lot of dough for a stand mixer! :)

Delicious and so easy!  I made mine in a Bundt pan and loaf pan, it made the bread easy to slice and carry to work! Definitely a tried and true recipe! Thanks so much for sharing!

Hands down the best bread I've ever made! I wanted to use my bread machine so I made 1/3 of the recipe. Here is the conversion:
1/2 c. milk, 1/3 c. water, 1-1/2 t. bread machine yeast, 1 egg, 3 T. sugar, 1/4 t. salt, 3 T. butter or margarine, 1/2 c. raisins, 2-1/2 c. + 1/8 c. flour, 2 t. milk, 1/4 c. sugar, 2 t. cinnamon, 2 t. butter. Disregard dissolving the yeast/waiting 10 minutes. Add the ingredients according to your bread machine mfr. instructions. Use the dough setting, adding the raisins when 5 minutes remain in the kneading process. At the end of the cycle, proceed with step 4, making 1 loaf. Bake 30-45 minutes. Enjoy!
Update: I made this again and substituted 1/3 c. oats for 1/3 c. flour and packed brown sugar instead of white sugar. I also added 1/2 t. cinnamon along with the salt. Last of all, I made the original recipe of the cinnamon sugar mixture and sprinkled this very generously over the rolled out dough. I saved the remaining cinnamon sugar for another use.

I don't really like raisins so I decided not to add them.  I also used ~1 T of sugar in the yeast mixture to ensure proofing.   Buttering the top of the dough (I used butter flavored PAM) before baking will ensure a soft crust.  I added 1 T of eggs to my 2 T milk called for in the recipe.  Monitoing my fat intake, I used fat free milk and Egg Beaters.  It turned out great.  The basic bread can be used to make other swirl breads like purple yam or use cocoa powder and sugar for a chocolate bread.

This was a very good recipe. I really love raisens so I think next time I'll put the raisens and add more cinnamon throughout the bread. 
Thank you! A good treat.

Excellent recipe.  Kim-marie, a bit of help for you if you try again....
you do not need to heat the milk.  Just warm it a bit so that it is a little warm, this will help the yeast to "grow" (that is the foam you will see on top of the milk - growing yeast and it will smell very yeasty as well) , if you get it to hot you will kill the yeast and end up with that funky dough ball at the bottom of the bowl.  (You may be able to find temp instructions with the packet as yeasts are not all identical...but as a general rule, you will be safe at just barely warm.) Just get it finger warm.  Also, when you are adding warm liquids to yeast bread recipes it does help things to rise a bit faster but be aware that the warmer the dough is while kneading it the more flour it will "take on".  It will be stickier and you will be tempted to add more and more flour. Be careful not to add  too much flour or you will end up with dry/tuff end result.  I like to leave a little of the flour out of the recipe and add it back in during the kneading and/or work with cooler dough. With some tricky doughs that are tender I even skip the bench flour altogether and spray the surface with butter flavored spray and my hands too.  Someone mentioned hard, reddish crust, this can happen when the dough rises to long.  The extra sugars from the proofing can cause this.  Try baking it a bit sooner and see if that helps any.  Hope this helps you some.  I remember the first loaf I ever made....I think they are still

This bread deserves SO many more stars! It is the best bread I have EVER tasted! Really, it is perfect with just a few changes: 1. Melt the butter when you mix it in with the yeast, or else you will have soft chunks of butter floating around. 2. Add some sugar (a teaspoon or so) to the yeast mixture so that the yeast will have something to make it grow. 3. Let it rise the full amount of time both rises so that the dough is nice and full when baked and doesn't have openings in between the cinnamon swirls. I let mine rise about 1 hour both rises. 4. Add some cinnamon to the dough to make it even more flavorful. 5. I brushed the dough all over with milk before baking it so it would have a tender crust. 6. I baked my bread way less than the time indicated. It was only baked 30 minutes and wasn't gooey or anything inside, (except the cinnamon mixture was). With these minor changes the bread is perfect. Also, I didn't add raisins because I don't like them in baked goods.  Following the suggestion of another reviewer I added slices of apple to the cinnamon mixture. One reviewer said that they used brown sugar for the cinnamon mixture. I tried doing that, but I think that the brown sugar taste is overpowering. Maybe light brown sugar would be better, but I think white sugar is best.  One more thing: After baking the bread and brushing melted butter over it, I sprinkled more cinnamon mixture.  It looked really nice.

The bread is delicious and freezes well.  As with most homemade breads, it dries out much faster than store-bought, if you can keep it in the kitchen that long!  As others mentioned, the dough was sticky; I had to add 1/2 - 1 cup more flour when kneading.  I added more raisins because I love every bite to have  raisin.  Next time, I will add more cinnamon per my son's request.  I will definitely make this again and again.

I couldn't decide between 3 and 4, so I give this a 3.5. I made this bread twice (no raisins  both times). The first time, I didn't have any problems with the dough, but it came out bland. That's where the 3 rating comes in. The second time I doubled the cinnamon filling, using half brown sugar and half white. I used salted butter for the instead of unsalted (and added about 1/2 teaspoon salt to the dough), and I added about 1 tablespoon cinnamon to the dough. I also added a little more sugar to the dough. After all these additions, the bread was great! It wasn't bland, the filling was a stand-out, and it tastes awesome plain or as toast with butter. 
Also, the bread only took 30 minutes to bake each time.

Oh my gosh, I LOVE this bread!!! I changed a few things. I added 1 Tbsp of sugar to the yeast/water and let it sit for 10 mins. As the yeast was activating, I mixed the other ingredients together, except for the flour. I also used butter instead of margarine and 1 1/2 cups raisins since I like them a lot!  I added the yeast mixture after 10 mins and then the cooled milk. I also used 4 cups of unbleached all-purpose flour and 4 cups bread flour since I have read that all-purpose flour isn't the best for bread. I kneaded the bread for about 10 minutes, not just a few. Let rise for 30 mins. For the sugar/cinnamon mixture, I used 1 cup sugar and 4 Tbsp cinnamon since I also love it! I covered the rolled out dough completely and then rolled it up. Lastly, I placed a glass pan of water on the bottom rack in the oven. Apparently this helps with browning the crust and keeps it from burning or drying out as easily. I preheated the oven to 400 degrees and then after I put the loaves in the oven, lowered the heat to 350 since so much heat is lost when you open the oven and apparently the first few minutes are crucial for rising. I baked for 16 mins, then turned all three pans around and baked for an additional 16 mins. I believe 45 minutes would be WAY too long. In the end, they are beautiful, and I will post pictures. Hope this review helps.

This was good, but not great.  The flavor is very plain, and though I doubled the amount of raisins, it's still missing something.  I think adding cinnamon to the dough might help, and if I try this again I'll increase the amount of the cinnamon filling as well.  I thought there would be too much in the recipe as written, but my loaves taste just like white bread with a little bit of cinnamon and raisin.  Not at all what I was hoping for.  Thank you for sharing, though!

Faye, thank you for this recipe! It is a family favorite!  I have been making this in my Bosch for years, with a few minor modifications.       *First, rather than scalding the milk, I use very warm water and powdered milk for this step.  *Second, I use only 1/4 c, butter in the dough.  *Third, I brush the dough with butter rather than milk before sprinkling on the cinnamon/sugar mixture.--I like the flavor  the butter adds.  Lastly, I roll the dough into one long roll like a cinnamon roll and cut it into thirds and seal the edges before placing in my bread pans.   These steps have helped stream-line this recipe while maintaining the integrity of the original.  * Finally, this dough makes EXCELLENT cinnamon rolls!  Just slice into 1 1/2' slices instead of three segments for the bread. Frost with cream cheese frosting and you are good to go.  HTH!

This is 10 star recipe!  Some of you need to learn to follow directions.  If your loaves were dry, you either didn't measure your flour properly (stirring flour, spooning into measuring cup and lightly leveling off) or you added too much flour in the kneading stage.  It probably took 1 - 2 cups more of flour to knead.  You want it to be smooth enough to handle, but still slightly "sticky". If a recipe specifies all-purpose, that's what you use--not whole wheat or cake.  I divided the dough into 3 equal portions and rolled and wrapped one at a time.  My pans were Doughmaker's 8 x 4 pans and the loaves were nice and high. It is a very wet dough, but that's what makes it taste so wonderful! It baked in about 30 minutes.  If you want to leave it in longer, I would recommend loosely tenting it with foil for the remaining time.  My flour was Bob's Red Mill unbleached white.  I nuked the butter until it was about half-way melted and it whisked in beautifully.   If you can't see that a 3 loaf recipe wouldn't make "a lot", and then leave a slightly sour remark,  then don't make this recipe. Faye, thanks for the wonderful recipe!  I hope to make it MANY more times.  I'll have to work on my rolling technique, mine weren't as "pretty" as the picture, but it tastes divine.

Very tasty indeed. I changed 2 things: 1 1/2 cups of raisins instead of 1 and instead of 3/4 cup of white sugar I used 3/4 cup brown sugar. Turned out wonderful. Thank you.

Generally I liked the base recipe for this bread.  I added some cinnamon to the bread dough as other reviewers did.  I also did a different take on the filling.  I soak my raisin with cinnamon, vanilla, and a tad bit of cloves.  I made a kind of smear with the 1 stick (4oz.) butter, softened, about 2 1/2 tbs. of cinnamon, and 3/4 cup of brown sugar instead of white sugar.  I like how lovely and fragrant the loaves came out.

The loaves are really delicious! They did get brown before the baking time was up so I put a tent of aluminum foil on top. Also, I couldn't figure out why Faye says the bread is rolled around cinnamon butter. It just said to brush the dough with milk then sprinkle the cinnamon sugar on top, the roll. My family loved it and I plan to make them again.

I hardly ever give 5 stars, because i find I usually have to add or change something in the recipe to make it really good. This one is great the way it is, and is easy enough to change around to fit my mood and appetite. 

I like to soak my raisins in apple cider and cloves for a little while before I make the bread. Not until the raisins are really plump, but enough to start softening that up a bit. I then use the left over liquid in place of some (or all) of the water used to start the yeast. the yeast is ready in no time and this adds a little more flavor. I also prefer brown sugar to white for both the sugar in the dough and in the filling. I also replace 1 cup of white flour with wheat for texture an color and add about 1 tsp of whey powder for each cup of flour I use. 

I roll out the dough to less than 1/2 inch so that i get more layers of swirl. I usually end up using more cinnamon and brown sugar than the recipe calls for, and add a bit of nutmeg as well. 

I know every oven is different. I'm at sealevel and have found 40 minutes to be just about right, covering with foil for the last 15-20 minutes. I sometimes get some dripping from the pans while baking, so I put a pan underneath.

My family loves this bread, and those i have shared it with have also given it high marks. 

Works great for cinnamon rolls too. I use this Vanilla Butter Cream Frosting recipe: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Vanilla-Butter-Cream-Frosting-232945

This is the best bread I've ever tasted in my entire life.  Moist with a yummy cinnamon swirl.  I put more raisins and cinnamon, to make it more tasty.  Eating this bread makes you feel like you're in heaven.  May sound wierd, but it tastes especially yummy toasted with peanut butter.  Mmmmmmm.

The only bread my family actally PREFERS to eat plain!
Very tasty, moist and delicious.
Great for cutting out fattening spreads like butter or margarine.
Definately at the top of my list!

I wish people would stop rating based on their modified recipe of something. It seems like every 4 or 5 star rating was given after adjusting parts of this recipe. It gives an unfair and unrealistic rating to the recipe. As written IMHO this raisin bread is no more than a 3. Sure I can change it to make it better, but that would mean those clicking on the highest rated recipe would read every comment. In a nutshell, this is too sweet, not enough raisins, and cooked for the suggested time will end up being a disappointment.

Excellent recipe, but 1 cup of raisins is not enough.  I used 2 cups and it was perfect for this size recipe.  Also I found it easier to roll the dough into 3 separate pieces instead of one large one.  I've done it both ways.  Three is easier to work with and tuck in the ends of the bread.

I make this bread about once a month.  This is something I do that I did not think to add to my first review.  Instead of using butter to adhere the sugar and cinnamon to the bread I use 1 egg beaten with about a tablespoon of water.   This holds your bread rolls together so much better.

This is a wonderful recipe! I made 6 loaves for Christmas gifts, saving 1 loaf for us. Got RAVE reviews from everyone, even from my very picky mother-in-law. The only thing that I did differently was to use golden raisins, I prefer the more subtle flavor. Will be making this again, and not just for Christmas gifts.

This bread should be a staple in anyone's recipe box. And if you don't make bread, this is a fantastic recipe to start with. I didn't change a single thing - even for a yeast bread, the directions are clear and easy and finished loaves are SO tasty - plus! easy to freeze - plus! make the world's greatest toast in the morning (the melted butter with the cinnamon swirl is perfection). Try it - you will love it.

I'm not new to baking.  In fact, for years I haven't been able to make a simple batch of cookies without ending up with chocolate chip cookie "buns."  This was the first time I tried to make cinnamon raisin bread.  I didn't roll it as prescribed because I was wary of making a mess and mixed the cinnamon and raisins together.  Also split the top and added butter. Next time I think I'll add a bit more cinnamon as well.  This bread was amazing for my first!  By the time it was cool, 3/4 of it had been already eaten. Brava!  This recipe is a keeper.

Wow, I'm not much of a cook, especially not a baker and I made this as a special surprise for my hubby who loves raisin bread. It turned out great! Deeelicous! I don't have a bread machine - not even one of those machines with a dough hook. Had to make it with my own two hands and it still worked for me. I will make this again and again and again. I iced two of the loaves with canned vanilla frosting. Great recipe Faye!

OH my goodness. This is awesome. When I mixed the water and yeast I also added a tsp of white sugar this will poof better and let you know your yeast is good. I added just over a cup of raisins and next time I will add even more. I rolled my dough a little thinner than called for but it produced great swirls.

Yum! I halved the recipe and still got two large loaves! The only thing I changed was to add extra raisins and a dash of cinnamon to the dough itself. One word of caution: keep a close eye on the baking time as the recipe says 45 minutes but my loaves were baked perfectly in less than 35 minutes. Every oven is a little different!

This recipe is heavenly! I made it with rapid rising yeast...placed all the dry ingredients together then added the liquids in my stand mixer. It was good right out of the oven but was even better the next day after all the flavors blended. Really yummy toasted. Thanks Faye!

This was my very first time making bread and it looked and tasted like I've been making bread for years.  Very easy recipe and tasty bread.  I didn't want it too sweet, so I only added about 1/3 cup sugar in the mixture and then less than 2 tablespoons of sugar into the cinnamon mixture and the bread still turned out great.  I used larger raisins but next time, I might use a mix of larger and smaller raisins because the larger raisins didn't mix evenly throughout the dough.  I would also add extra cinnamon to the dough.  Careful with watching the time especially after baking for 40 to 45 minutes as the bread burns easily.  I will definitely be making this again.

What a great recipe, it was so east, I made some yesterday and then i had to make more this morning!

I cut the recipe by a third so I made two loaves, i wanted to make sure my stand mixer could handle it which it could perfectly, 3 loaves would have been too much. I switched the recipe up a bit the second time, I added cinnamon directly to the batter and put in extra raisins. I also did half whole wheat flour and it turned out great. For the swirl mixture, i did half white sugar and half brown sugar with the cinnamon, preferred this mix the best. 

And definitely only bake it for 30 minutes!!

Few... thats a lot of dough!  I used my KA mixer, and everything went in smoothly. I did notice that the dough was very sticky -hard to really 'knead'. Im going to make it again, but next time i will make these adjustments:
a bit more raisins, 1 cup white sugar, 3 tablespoons ground cinnamon (and a little cinnamon in the dough itself). Also 45 minutes was way too long... i actually put it in for 29 minutes and it was perfectly light brown.

love the recipe...it was my first attempt at making a flavor bread and it was a hit! I was sort of dense in the center and hard to cut (squished together), if someone could let me know what I did wrong that would be great!

What a great bread recipe!  Like cake!  I really don't like raisins much is baked goods but, I could eat this one all day.  I tried it with canola oil instead of butter in the bread and it turned out beautiful.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe.

The picture doesn't do this recipe justice. There is a better picture in the "photos of this recipe" and that is exactly howmy loaves turned out - absolute perfection. I wish I could rate this with 6 stars because it's the best bread recipe I've come across ina long time - and I love making yeast breads!  I didn't change a thing in the recipe.

This bread was so easy to make, and usually when I bake things don't turn out right.  This must be a fool proof recipe.  I can't wait to make it again!

A wonderful bread for toasting or eating plain, and very good and easy to make, but something is missing in the flavor for me.  Still, I would make it again, and I was proud to give a loaf to my parents. It is a beautiful bread!!

Although I only began baking this year, this reciepe I tried truely was a masterpiece.  The bread was easy to make and my family just loved it.  I added some more cinnamon and cut the baking time from 45 minutes to 30 minutes. (Although I think the baking time was due to the fact that the oven I use sometimes jumps to 400 degrees F. Need new one)

So rich and delicious -- best cinnamon raisin bread I've ever had.  Very moist, doughy, sweet and flavorful.  This tastes like a cinnamon roll to me.  If you are already familiar with making yeast breads, this is not hard at all.  The recipe is large, so I halved it.  Also, I used whole wheat flour+wheat gluten for the flour and soymilk instead of milk which did not deter the deliciousness.

Having never made raisin bread before, and having very little experience making any kind of bread, first looking at this recipe intimidated me. However my loaves turned out beautiful and perfect the 1st time - how exciting! I added cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla to my dough for extra flavour and moisture. I also used coconut milk in place of regular milk to make it vegan and extra rich and it worked out great.

This was a fun recipe to make. (I seem to be on this whole bread baking kick lately. GREAT stress relief.) I cut the recipe in half, used an almost full can of evaporated milk I had to use or lose and added about a tsp. of vanilla. I used my Kitchen Aid to make this bread, first proofing the yeast with the sugar and warm milk/water in the mixer bowl, then added the butter and egg, then the dry ingredients. This dough did need a couple more tbsp. of flour to get it to finally pull together in a ball. Once it did, I kneaded it with the bread hook for five minutes. I got two medium loaves out of this recipe that were a little on the small side. I think because I drizzled the loaves with butter before they rose for the second time as formed loaves that they came out with a croissant-type texture on the outside. Really good bread. I think using the leftover evaporated milk was a money idea. I'd make this again. Good stuff!

I loved this recipe for raisin bread.  I never think there are enough raisins when I buy the bread at the store, so this was my chance to add more!  I added about a quarter cup more than the recipe calls for and it wasn't too overwhelming at all.  I can't wait to heat up a slice and it it for breakfast!  This recipe did make three loaves, so I had some extras to give away!

FABULOUS! This bread is like brioche, only with cinnamon and sugar and raisins. Really really good! I added half brown sugar and half white with the cinnamon for the middle and it turned out really great dessert bread. My family--including my husband who claims to hate raisins--loved this bread and could not get enough! It's a pretty fool-proof bread. Quick to make and has much room for error for those who are beginners. This IS A KEEPER!!!

I baked six loaves for family and friends at church for Christmas this year.  Each loaf came out beautiful and beyond my imagination!  Everyone that received a loaf raved over it. The Lord has really blessed this recipe. It is so good in the mornings with some butter spread on it and fresh from the broiler oven!  It is perfect!  My grandmother, when she was still with us, made raisin bread for our families for Christmas every year - everyone told me that this recipe was even better - she would be pleased that I'm carrying on the tradition.  I will, Lord's will, make this many many times.

I scaled the recipe to make 2 loaves and made some changes. I didn't have enough plain flour so i used a mixture of plain and bread flour (about 2:1), I used butter in place of margarine and I also doubled the raisins and added them into the dough so that they would be mixed throughout. Before rolling out the dough, I divided it into 2 and rolled them seperately to make it easier to manage. The dough tends to be sticky so I coated the table and the dough with a little oil. I find that if you use flour the dough tends to become dry. I didn't follow the recipe for cinnamon sugar as I had already doubled the raisins and didn't want the bread to be too sweet so I brushed butter on the surface of the dough to make it more moist and tasty) and just sprinkled enough cinnamon and sugar to cover the surface. What resulted was a soft and fluffy raisin bread with a nice swirl in the centre. Because I only had 1 loaf tin, I made 1 loaf first and wrapped the other in cling wrap then froze it before the 2nd rising. The night before I need the loaf I took it out of the freezer, unwrapped it and left it at room temperature in the loaf tin to complete its second rise. The next morning it was ready to bake.

This cinnamon raisin bread was SO GOOD, (and relatively easy to make), that I just had to take the time to register myself so I could write a review!  It's excellent.  If you think you won't use all 3 loaves simply wrap tightly (you may want to lightly grease the plastic wrap) and freeze one or two before the second rising process.  Chances are that you'll be unfreezing them before you know it, though.  SO, so good.  Thank you for posting this Faye!

Made this as-is and found it very sweet for me, but great recipe to play with. After heating the milk, I added the raisins (increased to 3c) to let them plump up.  Then I added the cinnamon to the milk so that the cinnamon was in the dough and not just a strip.  I only used 1/2 c sugar because I like a hint of sweetness.  I proofed the yeast with water and sugar.  I also used 1/2 c bread flour and the rest all purpose to give it a little more lift.  I kept the dough sticky.  This tastes great just out of the oven but also makes wonderful toast.

This was delicious fresh out of the oven and even better the next day, toasted with some butter. I thought the bread and the cinnamon swirls held their shape better and was easier to slice into thin slices the next day after being refridgerated overnight. The only thing I did different was use maybe two tablespoons of sugar total (for half the recipe) in the swirls because I didn't want the bread to be too sweet... I wanted bread, not cinnamon rolls. This will be made often in my house, thanks for sharing!

Delicious! Makes three huge loaves. I stirred in the last cup of flour in by hand, even my standing mixer couldn't stir 8 full cups. The dough is thick and slightly tacky for moistness. Don't add too much flour when kneading. Will make this often; maybe as gifts for the holidays when topped with confectioner's glaze.

This was really good,but the bread had no flavor. I found myself wanting to put peanut butter, more raisins, or anything on it. Next time I will go with what others said and add cinnamon to the dough. Even the swirl wasn't full of flavor. :(

This recipe rocks.

I cut the recipe in half and made 1 loaf and 6 buns in cake pan.    After 20 minutes, I removed the buns.  Also after 20 minutes, I covered the loaf loosely with tented foil and baked it for another 10 minutes. At the suggestion of most of the reviewers here, I only cooked the loaf for a total of 30 minutes at 350 instead of the 45 minutes indicated in the recipe.  However, the 30 minutes was not long enough - the center of the loaf was still somewhat wet.  Next time I will leave in for another 5 minutes.
 
Even though the center was still a bit wet, this did not ruin my loaf, as I just sliced the inner part of the loaf and toasted them, which cooked them through.

The buns came out great - I made a glaze with cream cheese, little milk, little confectioners.

Delicious!

Extremely Delicious Cinnamon Raisin Bread Take Head...Contrary to other reviews..I found this bread DOES need to bake for 40 - 45 minutes. If you think it's getting to brown on the top after 30 minutes you might want to consider covering with aluminum foil.

This was the most amazing bread I think I've ever eaten! I followed another person's review and halved the recipe the way they did. It turned out perfect! The only thing was I didn't put many raisins in as I couldn't recall if my hubby liked raisins. I'll definitely put what the recipe calls for next time! We loved everything about the bread! When I halved the recipe, I made one loaf of bread (in a loaf pan) and I put the rest in a 9 in round cake pan... So it made quite a bit! Next time I will make a whole batch and freeze the extra loaves! Thanks so much Faye!

Made this with wheat and bread flour (5c/3c), doubled the raisins (2c), decreased the sugar (1/2c). increased cinnamon (3T) and added a bit of cardamom. Very delish!  Had a hard time waiting for it to cool enough for slicing.  Can't wait to try it as rolls.

Okay- DELICIOUS! I just had a piece right out of the oven. So soft, and sweet, and perfect with some butter!  I followed others' advice cut the cooking time. Mine was perfectly brown after 25 min. I also followed someone's advice to leave the dough a little sticky to ensure a moister bread.   It makes 3 loaves, but I only have 2 loaf pans. So I sliced up the 3rd loaf, put the pieces in a 9X13 pan, and sprinkled the tops with brown sugar. Tomorrow we'll have sticky buns for breakfast.

Delicious - even modifying for my bread machine!  I have a small bread maching and I wanted to save time and make the dough that way so here's what I did: (this is also so I'll remember next time!) change the number of servings to 12; warm the  milk and the water and add in the order listed according to your bread machine.  For the ingredients that are listed as "2 tbsp plus 2 tsp" I used 3 tbsp.  Still used a full cup of raisins (softened in some warm water for about 30 minutes ahead of time) - added about 20 minutes into kneading cycle.  Also added about a tsp of cinnamon into the bread.  When dough cycle finishes, continue with the directions as written but only make 1 loaf!  FABULOUS!!!! Can't wait to make french toast tomorrow morning with this delicious bread.

Made this today. I would have given this recipe four and a half stars but I haven't figured out how to do a half star yet.   First time ever making bread so I was a little nervous.  Was very pleased with the end result.  Didn't have three pans so I baked two in the pans I did have and divided the other third of the dough into three pieces and backed in mini pans.  All of them came out great.  The only thing I would change is I would add cinnamon to the dough itself to add more of a cinnamon flavor.

Fabulous bread and easy to make. It makes three good sized loaves. Make sure to watch your cooking time. I made the mistake of setting the timer for the full and not checking my bread until it went off. My bread turned out to be a little browner than I would have liked.

This bread really IS what cinnamon raison bread is supposed to taste like.  Make phenominal raisin toast!  Next time I will double the raisins.  I thought it was a little sparse on the raisins.  Perfect flavors though!!!  This recipe is a keeper!

Easy recipe, very tasty. I tried substituting wheat germ for 1/3 of the flour and adding more sugar to the swirl. Came out great, but beware because it does make it a heavier and the loaf did not rise as much as an all-purpose flour would. Also, a tip for the raisins: soak the raisins in hot water for at least 10 mins prior to adding to the dough. You'll end up with raisins that plump up and are  very juicy and moist. This might help with the raisin issue that the other reviews seem to be discussing.

This is a  very good recipe ! I made mine a little different but it still turned out great .  I halfed the recipe and used bread machine yeast and used bread flour and made the dough in a bread machine and then put the swirl on cinnamon and baked it in a oven .  It turned out great !

YUMMM!!  This recipe is very popular around here.  I have been making this bread for about a year, and it's the best raisin bread recipe I have tried.  The only thing I change is to add almost double the raisins.  I make two loaves and then with the rest of the dough I make cinnamon rolls!!

Excellent Recipe.. easy to follow.  outcome. After rolling we left the dough sit for more than an hour and which rose and was beautiful.  when cooking keep the temperature low because the top darkened quickly.  LOVED IT... Can't wait to makeit again.

I halved this recipe and it still made 2 large loaves.  The crust on it was really dry and hard...idk....ok bread.  Needs more cinnamon..maybe in the dough...and more sugar in the filling.

I reduced the recipe to 12 servings which made one perfect loaf. I also added 1/2 cup of raisins to the batter. This is the best and easiest I have ever made.  Next time I will make three loaves, because one was gone quickly!

from all the reviews, i was a tiny bit dissapointed at the results...though it could have been due to the fact that i didn't add enough butter. Also, a tip: after rolling the bread, you can cut it into slices and then bake, it makes wonderful little snack bread things. looks  really pretty ^^

this was the first time i've made bread. it was successful but my parents were a little disappointed by how few raisins there were. i increased the raisins to 2 cups and my end product was excellent. my parents loved it and we ate it within a few days. raisins added additional flavor and is much better. this is now a family favorite!

This is the absolute best cinnamon raisin bread.  I sped it up by adding the sugar, salt, + butter to the milk.  Then cooling the mixiture w/ ice water.  Also I don't have 3 loaf pan so I froze the 3rd roll.  Think I'll slice it and make cinnamon rolls.  yummy.  Plus you have to try this bread as French Toast.  To die for.

Great recipe! I made a few "healthier" changes: I used half whole wheat flour and half bread flour, brown sugar instead of white sugar for the filling, and 4 tablespoons cinnamon. I brushed the top of the bread with milk prior to baking and did not put melted butter on top. I rolled it up and put the whole thing in a bundt pan. Let it sit for 30 minutes, then put it in the fridge overnight. In the morning, let it come up to room temp and baked for 35 minutes.

With a little effort I was able to convert this to a single loaf recipe for my bread machine, after trying a couple of disappointing bread machine recipes for cinnamon bread. We just had our first (warm!) slices and are more than pleased with how it turned out. I used an earlier suggestion of half whole wheat flour and it's so delicious. Thanks for posting!

Very tasty bread, with a rich, chewy center. The only problem I ran into was that it was really dry the next day. I was a little disappointed in that. Maybe I'll try using not as much flour next time.

This recipe is AMAZING! I did substitute all the butter with coconut oil(in the dough, oiled the bowl, and on the dough to rise, plus oiled the warm bread after it came out of the oven) I also put half brown sugar in the swirl layer. VERY good bread, awesome flavor and a nice soft texture!

This is such delicious bread! This was my first time making a loaf of bread and it was much easier than I had anticipated. I scaled back the recipe to make one loaf and kept everything the same except for using brown sugar in the cinnamon swirl instead of white. My loaf only took about 25-28 minutes to bake. The bread itself is really light and fluffy and has a nice thin and tender crust. This tastes so good toasted with butter. I will definitely be making this again!

I agree with others that it does not take 45 minutes to bake this bread.  It only took me 30 minutes and had I not read the reviews, I would have ended up with burnt bread since I am a newbie at baking.  I halve the recipe and used whole wheat flour instead of white flour.  I ended up needing a lot less than 4 cups of flour though.  Maybe the recipe was not meant to be halved but it's simply too big of a recipe for just two people!  DELICIOUS bread though!  I am going to use this to make sticky buns next time.

Delicious!! Tastes wonderful when used as your bread for french toast. My 2 recommendations.....more raisins. I doubled the amount in my recipe.....it's raisin bread, you need a lot of them!! And I added another tablespoon of cinnamon. My mother and I loved it!

This was really easy to make. I did make a few small changes though, that's why I rated 4 stars and not five because of my own changes. I doubled the raisins for one, also I had to add more flour, as this bread is a very soft dough. After I let it rise and rolled it out, I used 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar and 2 Tbsp. of Cinnamon for the swirl. I took another reviewers suggestion and baked for 30 minutes at 300 degrees, then turned off my oven and let them sit overnight. I think this would make wonderful toast for the morning, french toast or even a very good bread pudding. Tyvm for this recipe =)

Instead of all purpose flour, I use 5 cups of whole wheat and 3 cups of bread flour. I use skim milk, and add 1 1/2 cups of raisins as well as 3 to 4 tablespoons of cinnamon depending on the brand. With my modifications, this is my always-in-the-freezer bread. I'd hate to start the day without it toasted for breakfast!

I have made this several times now and it is by far the most successful bread recipe I have tried. I have actually started using it as a basic recipe and just leave out the cinnamon/sugar/raisin combo. I also use 1/2 whole wheat pastry flour. I get so many compliments - it's delicious!

This is a wondeful recipe!  It got rave reviews from my family! The bread was very soft and moist.  I made half the recipe which gave me 1 large loaf and 3 mini loafs (there was enough dough for 2 large loafs, but I only had one large pan, I will purchasing another one soon though!) The dough was very easy to work with and rose beautifully. Added enough flour to make a soft but not sticky dough. I substituted raw sugar for the granulated sugar in the cinnamon sugar mixture, it has a much coarser texture. Sprinkled top of loafs with cinnamon sugar as well. I baked the large loaf for about 30 minutes (covering the top of the loaf with foil the last 10 minutes of baking time) and the smaller loafs for about 15 minutes. The cooled loafs sliced up very nicely and toasted wonderfully!  It is very much like the raisin bread that we used to get at the neighborhood bakery years ago.  The only other changes that I will make next time is to brush the rolled dough with butter instead of milk, and to double the amount of raisins. Love it!!

When I bake bread it generally doesn't come out very well- this turned out GREAT! Light and fluffy. I used a combo of about 1/2 bread flour and 1/2 all purpose flour because it's what I had. I also had about 1/2 cup of chocolate ganache leftover from another baking project that I mixed into the filling mixture. YUM.

I'm not sure where I went wrong... My bread turned out very dense and bland. No visible swirl...crumbly... This was my first time making bread, but from the reviews, I thought it would be flaky and yummy. The dough seemed really sticky and it didn't rise very much. certainly not doubled. I left it in an unlit gas oven for three hours and next to nothing happened. It didn't rise at all the second time. I had this sad looking lump of cooked dough in the pan. No hollow sound. Wasn't so bad that it could be used drive nails but something went really wrong.  I was very careful to add all the ingredients and follow instructions exactly too.  I'd like to try it again, but I have sooo much of this dough left! I stuck two loaves uncooked in the freezer...

this was pretty good! it does NOT take 45 minutes to bake however... i freaked out when i turned on the light to check on it after about 25 minutes and it was practically burned! the bread has a heavy lead texture and the cinnamon swirl is a bit too biting cinnamon for me.

Baked at 350 degrees for 35 minutes. Put a loose tent of aluminum foil over the loaves for the last 10 minutes of baking. Absolutely perfect.

If you follow this recipe exactly (note: the loaves probably only need 30 minutes to bake) you should end up with a perfectly fine batch of cinnamon raisin bread; a plain raisin bread with a light, sweet swirl cinnamon swirl running through, perfect for toast.  I prefer my bread to be a bit sweeter and much more moist, though, so I use the following modifications; add 1/2 c sugar and omit 1 c flour to the main dough; leave out the raisins for the filling.  This will make your dough sweeter and super sticky, so it may be more difficult to work with, but the loaves turn out so much more moist.  The stickier the dough, the more moist the bread will be.  Then I double the sugar in the cinnamon swirl filling and sometimes substitute brown sugar for half of the white sugar.  I sprinkle raisins liberally on top of this.     If you want to make cinnamon rolls, just cut your rolled loaf into 1" slices (or however thick you want) before the second rise.  Before baking, you can pour a mixture of sugar, cinnamon and melted butter over top which will give them a nice sugary glaze, or you can use one of the many icing recipes on this site.

Very moist, but not too moist bread. Our family really likes gooey filling and lots of raisins, so I trippled the filling and rolled it tight. I cooked one third of the dough in a regular bread pan, but the other 2/3 I rolled into a spiral and placed in a large cheese cake pan. It went over great.

This is instantly a favorite in my family!  The only complaint I have is the cooking time.  I ended up putting it in for 30 minutes instead of 45 and it was done.  If I had left it in for the time stated on the recipe it would have burned.  Other than that I have no complaint at all!  I'm definitely going to make this again.

This bread got a 5 star review at my house. I had to join this group just so I could add my 2 cents. I made a confectioner's sugar and milk glaze for the top. Yum! Thanks for a recipe that works.

If I could give this 10 stars, I would.  I've been making this bread for a few years now.  I don't make bread often but when I do it's usually this one.  I usually separate the dough into 3 parts and roll them seperately.  I don't usually measure the cinnamon sugar, I just put alot, haha, that's the BEST part of this recipe!  The dough puffs up beautifully!  The best is to eat it with peanut butter and unravel it as you eat it.  MMMMM, so good.  Everyone I give this to loves it.
Someone told me once it was too sweet but I don't think so...that's the nature of raisin bread!  I love it!

Really good, but double that cinnamon filling! I'm a person who is easily overwhelmed by cinnamon and even I thought it was too little! Also, I don't get what it means by tucking in the ends, anyone could explain it? P.S. Don't use half bread flour, half ap like I did! My texture was off because I did that, but was not reflected in my review.

Just had to write my first review after years of using this website.  GREAT bread.  Used my bread machine for about 6-10 minutes of kneading, soaked the raisins in hot water before adding to machine for the last few minutes of kneading. Becareful they carry over a bit of water and can make the dough sticky. I'll roll it out thinner next time so I get even more pretty swirl marks.  I used extra sugar and cinnamon and wished I wouldn't have it made it a bit more like a cinnamon roll inside rather than traditional bread. But is that really a problem ;o) This bread is better than anything store bought and so super easy to make.

Flavor was fantastic but found it to be a bit dry and the crust got a little hard.  I will definitely make again soon but will play with the recipe a bit so it is more moist.

Excellent recipe!  I used my bread maker to do the hard part for me.  Then after rolling it out (minus the raisins) and putting it in the bread pans, I let it rise overnight.  That way, I was able to put it in the oven in the morning and have fresh, warm bread.
I baked mine at 350 degrees for about 30 minutes.  Just let the bread come to room temp first before putting in the oven.

Thanks for the great recipe!

I've made this several times (changing it only to use a cup of raisins per loaf) and it has always turned out delicious.  My only problem has been getting fairly large separations in the rolled seams (especially in the center even though I've tried to roll it extremely tight.  Any suggestion?

This recipe yields a bread that taste wonderful toasted and smothered in butter... not quite worthy of 5 stars, though. The bread dough, itself, is rather bland tasting, but I think a bit more salt and sugar would help to give it some more flavor. The raisins are absolutely what makes this bread yummy, though! I used golden raisins and they were sensational. As for the "filling", a lot more cinnamon must be added, not only to make up for the lack of taste, but to ensure that a nice, brown swirl pattern is visible. Could also use a bit more sugar on the inside of the roll, and nuts would be nice. Other than the bread being a bit light on taste and cinn/sugar, it is a verry tasty recipe with loads of possibility... just needs a bit of tweaking!

Can you say perfect??  Texture, taste, everything!
I increased everything by 1/3 so I could make 4 loaves (that's what fits in my oven) and they came out beautifully.  I also substituted 1/2 wheat flour. My family loves this - it is nothing for 3 loaves to be gone within 2 days.  And toasted??? yummy...
I gave a loaf to a friend and now she wants me to come over and make it with her!
Thanks Faye for a fabulous recipe :o)
By the way... how can I find more recipes by you???

Oh my, this was heavenly!  I don't make bread often at all, but this was an easy recipe to follow with great results.  I did substitute whole wheat flour for half of the regular flour, and the only further "tinkering" I would do to this recipe to appeal more to my family's taste is to add more raisins (my 2 and 4 year olds LOVE raisins).  This recipe has officially made me want to make bread more often! ;-)

I made this for my 3 year old grandson, he loves raisin bread, and it was incrediabely good. I cut the recipe in half, as I only had 1 package of yeast and I still got two nice loaves. I frosted them with just a simple glaze ( powered sugar, a couple teaspoons of butter, a teaspoon of valilla and water to desired consistancy )at my grandsons request. I will deffinatly make it again. Thanks for a great recipe.

Excellent!  Wonderful toasted the day after!  Be sure and roll tightly, or your rolls will separate when baked. I halved the recipe, and it made 2 high, delicious 8" loaves. Thanks, Faye, for sharing this recipe!

I scaled this down from 36 servings to 12 and the ingredients came out very easy (no 1/16 cups of flour or anything).  Also added extra rasins, but did everything else just the same.  My bread didn't rise as much as I thought it would so my loaves (I made 2) came out smaller than a regular loaf would.  But - it was wonderful - we loved it and would definitely recommend it!

I was pleasantly surprised by this bread.  I normally don't have good luck with breads I make by hand, but these loaves turned out great -- wonderfully moist and delicious.  The only thing I did differently was heat the milk in the microwave to 110 degrees instead of heating it on the stove.  Great recipe, but if you're fond of raisins, it would be wise to add more than 1 cup.

Very good, but turned out slightly dry. I would recommend doubling the cinnamon sugar mixture, doubling or tripling the raisins, and adding some cinnamon to the dough. A powdered sugar glaze makes it twice as good.

Absolutely wonderful recipe. A soft and fluffly bread with  just the right amount of sweetness.  

The one thing I did differently was I added 3 cups of raisens instead of just one.  

Also, I only had two loaf pans so I made cinamon rolls out of the remaining dough.

Try it! You'll love it.

Very tasty bread. I added the cinnamon to the dough and omitted the filling step, instead I braided the dough into four breads.
Loved the taste, just sweet enough with a lovely hint of cinnamon without being overpowering. Only one note: the raisins were by far not enough. I added two cups instead of one, and I could have easy doubled that to get a true raisin bread.
Otherwise, great recipe!

Wonderful bread.  Makes great french toast.  I would probably increase the sugar a little.  The eggs give it a very nice solid consistency.  Toasts exceptionally well.

Faye, I could just KISS your Dad!!   (You mentioned this was his recipe!)  It is truly the best cinnamon raisin bread recipe I've tried. My daughter and I will give it with pride to family and friends for delicious Christmas food gifts! I used the medium sized foil pans instead of the 9X5 loaf pans, and it made 4 instead of 3. The loaves were light and high, and so moist!I swirled on a thin confectioner's sugar glaze, and put a few of the cinnamon red dots on them, too, and they looked like they came right out of a European bakery!I added pecan chips and used the raisins they have out now that are for baking since they are very, very moist! You never need look any further for the perfect cinn raisin bread recipe! This is it! Thanks to you and your dad!

We made this and followed the advice from DANDK1997. Left the dough to rise overnight, and didn't heat the milk. We also used brown sugar instead of cinnamon+sugar, prunes instead of raisins (double the amount in the recipe), and olive oil instead of butter. Total baking time was 50mins and this is really as delicious as everybody here says. The crust is my favourite part!

my gosh!  I can't believe I just found this bread.  It is identical to what my Mom used to make years ago.  She used it for cinnamon rolls too,  Just cut the roll in one inch slices, let rise again and bake.  I added extra cinnamon to the filling, personal preference.  Otherwise I stuck to the recipe because I believe you should the first time you make it.  I'm so glad I did.  It is a real keeper.  I may even make this as the "Birthday Cake" for one of the "girls" at work.  It will be a pleasant change.  Thank you for sharing!

I made it exactly as described and it came out perfect!  Three loaves baked in metal pans were pulled out at 40 minutes in our electric oven.  Start keeping an eye on it at 30 minutes. The hollow sound was correct in determining that it was done.  The cinnamon swirl is delightfully sticky. Previous attempts I've made at cinnamon swirl breads have fallen apart because I put the raisins in the swirl and used melted butter for the cinnamon sugar mixture.  Mixing the raisins in the dough is much better.  I still rolled a few in the swirl.  Milk instead of butter kept it from separating and probably helped prevent the center from being doughy.  This is a very tasty bread, hot or cold.  Definitely a keeper!

This was the best homemade raisin bread I have ever made! So delicious. I made it exactly as stated in the recipe with the exception of adding about a 1Tsp. of cinnamon to the bread batter with the raisins. I love extra cinnamon in my raisin bread. This is a keeper for me. So yummy!!

This bread is excellent - the perfect amount of sweetness. I included the raisins, but next time I may omit. They just look pretty in the bread but don't contribute much. I only prepared 1/3 of the recipe, as I wanted to use the bread machine...1 loaf requires roughly 25 minutes, otherwise you will have a beautifully burnt bread! Thank you!

This bread was awesome. My turned out ever so slightly dense, so that's why I give it 4 1/2 stars. I probably just needed to let it rise a tad longer the first time around. Instead of raisins, I used craisins!!! So awesome, next time I'll probably add 1/2 c more craisins. I love how the tart cuts down the sweet. YUM. In my cinnamon mix I used 1/2 c dark brown sugar and 1/4 c white sugar with the 2 tblsp cinnamon! AMAZING! It says to let it cool so you don't squish it when it gets cut. Well, squished or not my family couldn't wait until it cooled. It was SOOO yummy. My picky toddlers gobbled it up for sure. :) Win-win for everyone! It was a great family project to make with my little girls!

I use this recipe frequently for bake sales.  I make two batches of bread and then make one batch without raisins for carmel rolls.  I just slice the bread roll and put the slices in a pan that has butter and brown sugar on the bottom.  Always the first item that is sold out at the back sales.

Really expected and hoped for more. It taste very bland and floury.. I even had to make a cinnamon roll style glaze for it to try and give it some flavor. Not at all what i thought it would be.

We loved this bread! I omitted the raisins but will definitely add them the next time. This is a really great bread that is not too sweet and has just the right amount of cinnamon and sugar (I used brown sugar for the swirl) that it doesn't feel like you're eating candy for breakfast. This made three big loaves; I baked one right away and froze the other two. When making one of the frozen loaves, I simply take it out of the freezer before bed, put it in a greased loaf pan and place in the oven, covered with the oven light on and let rise overnight. Then in the morning, I bake according to the directions. We find our bread is ready in about 30-35 minutes. Thanks for a great recipe Faye!

This is fantastic! I used my bread machine on the dough cycle and made half a batch, which still gave me two small loaves.  I may take some of the other suggestions and add a bit of cinnamon to the dough and maybe use brown sugar in the filling...but great texture, flavor and appearance...will definitly make again!

I have had numerous compliments on this recipe! It has also been succesful using high-altitude adjustments as I live at 9200 feet! Do not mix and save overnight. Make sure you have the time to bake it as soon as the recipe calls for it.

We cut the recipe in half (following FAIR_LADY's suggestions) and still froze a second loaf - this is fantastic!

This bread was a hit. Unfortunately I didn't realize it makes 3 loaves so I had to run to my neighbor's to borrow a loaf pan! She didn't mind me returning it full, though. After about 3 days the bread became pretty hard, though.

I actually scaled this down to make one loaf, thinking my small household could never manage three loaves. Now I wish I'd made all three and intend to do so at the weekend and freeze two of them. The dough is beautiful to work with and the instructions on how to achieve the swirl effect are very clear even when making only one loaf. I found 25 minutes baking time was all it took for one loaf. This is definitely becoming a breakfast favourite with my daughter, Faye thankyou so much.

Amazing! My first attempt at making real bread, not just a "quick" bread! We couldn't stop eating it. Next time I will try half whole wheat flour and half all-purpose. A MUST-TRY recipe!

A great bread; I can rarely get a loaf to stay around for more than a day.  I do recommend substituting part brown sugar for the filling and I use more raisins.  But, it's definitely a go-to recipe for me.

This bread is very good.  I (almost) made it as written.  I had to separate it in 4 loafs instead of three (I guess my pans were a little smaller then the directions said).  I cooked them for 20 minutes.  I did not butter the tops after they were cooked.  I also had it rise in my oven (turned off) with a dish of boiling water beneath the breads.  It took only half an hour for each rising with this method.  
NEXT TIME: I will put cinnamon in the dough as well as in the sugar mixture.  I wanted more cinnamon.  I will cook it a little longer as well.   The directions are simple and it wasn't very time consuming.   I think with the changes, I'm gonna rate this a five stars!

I wish i could give this recipe 10 stars.  This is such a beginner friendly recipe.  The loaves came out flawless and everyone raved about it including my 2 year old who is so picky.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.  I followed everyone elses suggestions and baked for 30 minutes and they came out perfect.  Thanks so much!!

Oh my heavens! This bread is amazing. I cut in half each time and I still get 2 huuuuge loaves. I use sucanat instead of sugar (it's all-natural...it's sugar before it's ever been processed, therefore it still has the molasses component and it's perfect for baking, desserts, etc. It also reacts in your body like a whole grain instead of sugar. My mother-in-law got me on it 1 year ago and I'll never go back to regular sugar!)

I have to say I was a bit disappointed.  After reading all the reviews I was expecting better.  Turned out a bit dry, the dough was too sweet... It was okay, but not quite up to the hype.  I will try it again to see if there was something I did wrong.

Delicious! Definitely make again...the flavor is awesome! However, the reason for only 4 stars is b/c the texture was not as firm as I would have liked. But that being said this is sooooo yummy.

This is great!  I add in more raisins too (about 1.5 cups total) but otherwise follow the recipe as written.  

When I knead it, I spray my silpat with spray oil, spray my hands, and that way I don't have to add more flour (thereby drying out the dough) but I'm still able to knead the dough nicely.  Also spritz the kneading surface with spray oil when I'm rolling it out to form into loaves.  

This bread is delicious, everyone who has eaten it has loved it!

Made with part wheat flour.  Turned out well... a bit dry.  May have to tweek the baking time.  I also added cinnamon directly to the dough and did not swirl it.  Kids and hubby ate it up!

I almost never put up reviews but I have to agree with others...the flavor of this bread is really really good.  If there is anything I can add...for whatever reason my yeast was dead and the dough didn't rise. Freaking out over potentially losing three loaves of bread-I added instant yeast directly to the dough and kneaded again-got a reasonable rise but dense bread. Adding more raisins next time as a personal preference and will try retarding the rise a bit more to see if I can pull out even more flavor. Thank you very much for the recipe.

Oooh man this stuff is delicious!! I've made this twice now, and the second time it turned out even better than the first! Which is pretty amazing! My family ate it up even though they were reluctant to try because of the raisins. Perfect! wouldn't change anything. Will definitely make again.

This recipe is wonderful! I was bored one night and made cinnamon rolls with the dough and OH MY! My husband and girls ate them in a day! I rolled out the dough and spread a butter, cinnamon, brown sugar and nutmeg over. Rolled up, cut and put in oven with homemade cream cheese icing. Thanks for the recipe!

Love, love, love this bread! I followed suggestions of SandraJ, and convert the servings to 12 - reduces the ingred to make 1 loaf. I use 1c all purpose flour, 1c bread flour, 2/3 c of whole wheat, 2 1/2 tsp of instant yeast. I still use 1 cup of raisins (in hot water microwaved for 35 secs, toss them into my bread machine after it's been mixing for a cpl.  of min.) (no need to wait til the add-in beep)  At end of dough cycle I turn dough onto floured board and roll out in a 9x12 (approx) rectangle.  I mix 2 T of melted butter with 2 T of milk and brush the surface to the edges. I mixed 1/4 c gran. sugar with 1/4 c brown sugar and 1 tsp cinnamon with 1/4 tsp nutmeg and sprinkle on dough leaving 1/2 inch edge.  Rolling tightly I compress the sides as I go, put into a greased loaf pan and brush the surface with the butter/milk and sprinkle just a bit of cinn/sug on top. (you could set for 2nd rise at this point) Instead, I do this in the evening, cover the pan lightly with plastic wrap and put in the fridge. I get an overnite rise and in the morning I set on top of the stove while I am preheating the oven and let it rise a bit more. Only thing I have noticed is that I have to watch the bake time....at 38 minutes my bread was almost too brown...but was delish! I did spread on a light cream cheese icing...omg this is heaven slathered with softened butter with a big glass of milk or cup of coffee. Would be killer as french toast-but never makes it to that point! Must Do Recipe!!

Amazing recipe! I usually don't like cinnamon raisin bread and only made this to use up some raisins we had around. As soon as it came out of the oven- I ate a quarter of a loaf all by myself! My family and even my Mother-in-law loved it! Very moist and flavorful! I will definately make this again!

I didn't bother with the rolling out and cinnamon/sugar filling.  I put the 2 tbsp cinnamon and 2 cups raisins in with the flour, etc., mixed everything together.  The bread is great, just what I wanted.  I made this into four nice sized loaves.  However, there is no way they needed 45 minutes to bake. Half an hour or 35 minutes is plenty. Next time I will add a cup or so of whole wheat flour to the mix.

This is excellent! I halved the recipe because I wanted 1 loaf, but I didn't realize this recipe is for 3 loaves, so I had 1 huge loaf. I used the dough cycle on my bread machine to do all the hard work. Then, I baked it in the oven for 30 minutes after rolling up and it was done. It is so delicious! My kids and I loved it. I will definitely be making this again.

This recipe made a delicious, moist, flavorful bread with a light texture.  I have made bread with my machine for years, but was nervous about trying a recipe "by hand" for the first time.  Even though I live at 6,000 ft. I decided to try the recipe without any adjustments and thought it turned out great.  My main concern was the large quantity of dough was difficult to handle without a heavy duty stand mixer.  Also, my yeast/warm water mixture never got frothy even after 25-30 min. so I just used it anyway.  My bread also was perfectly golden brown after only 25-30 minutes.  I will definitely make this recipe again, perhaps halving it.  I think I will also try dividing the dough first and then adding the cinnamon mixture to make it easier to roll and distribute the cinnamon evenly.

This recipe is not written well. For beginner cooks - please double check the amts you use when starting. I messed up on the milk in the first line, never added the yeast, etc.  My advise is to read the entire recipe carefully and make sure you leave notes for yourself to make sure you don't screw up.  Mine did not come out very well - but I think I need to remake it before leaving a bad review.

Excellent! I didn't use the raisins because not everyone in the family likes them, but this bread makes for GREAT french toast in the morning. Easy to make and easy to freeze to keep loaves on hand. I will definitely be making this bread over and over again, and next time I will add small chunks of apples to the dough.

Thank You, Thank You, Thank you.  I have tried other cinnamon bread recipes in the past and was not impressed with how they turned out. This recipe was very easy and the bread was amazing. My family went through one loaf last night after dinner when it was still warm. Then we finished off the second loaf this morning when we toasted it. This is going to be a recipe that we use alot.

I made this with golden raisins and substituted some whole wheat flour.  Like one of the other reviewers, my dough didn't raise to double but it baked up perfectly.  This is the best  cinnamon raisin bread recipe out there, I much prefer it to any bakery version.

This is a good recipe. However, I doubled the cinnamon-sugar mixture for the center, since I like I moist, flavorful center in swirl breads. I also sprinkled raisins over the rectangle before rolling up, just to give more life to the swirl. I think the recipe could use just an extra boost of flavor, so I would suggest increasing the salt to about 1.5 tsp or even 2 tsp, and throwing in at least 1TB of cinnamon into the bread mixture. You'll definitely want to bake it for 25-30 minutes. I baked mine for 25, then turned oven off for 10 more minutes since the center was still a little gummy (probably b/c I doubled the cinn-sugar mixture). I made these to give as Christmas gifts this year, should be a hit!

This is a great recipe.  The soft dough was great to work with, the end result was great texture and not to dense.  I did break the dough up into 3 pieces to make the loaves instead of doing it all as one.  And the loaves were a bit large and really puffed out of the pans.  Next time I will probably make 4 smaller loaves.

I want to start by saying I'm not a baker.  This is the first thing I've ever made successfully from scratch.  I have 4 children and 3 of them absolutely love raisin bread.  I thought it would be a good idea, and cheaper, to make it instead of $3 per loaf from the store.  I settled on this recipe and I love it, they love it!  It's moist, delicious, came out a beautiful golden brown and made the whole house smell wonderful.  Thank you for posting it.

Delicious! I used apples instead of raisins because my husband doesn't like them. I halved the recipe and had two large loaves. They definitely only needed to bake around 30 minutes.

Fabulous!!!  This bread is delicious.  I made the dough machine and didn't add the raisins until I was sprikling on the cinnamon and sugar.  Oh - and I added a bit of brown sugar.  Came out great and freezes well too!

oh boy. i am in heaven. as i sit here devouring my second slice of this bread, i feel that i must encourage everyone to try this recipe. I give the actual recipe like a 4 1/2,  but the end result, after some changes, a 5. The changes i made were mostly due to my preferences. I used half whole wheat bread flour because i wanted a wheat bread, I omitted raisens because i can't stand them, and I added a couple tsp of cinnamon to the dough. My bread only needed to be baked for 30 minutes. I also only have 8 in and 7 in loaf pans so I made two bigger loafs and two smaller ones. Don't skip the buttering step at the very end. I think it made a world of difference in my crust. I also changed how i rolled out the doughs. Instead of one big one, I divided the doughs and rolled each one up alone, because i wanted a really thin layer and did not have room to roll the whole thing out in one fell swoop. also, a stick of margarine works great in this recipe so don't think you should have to sub in real butter. Although i do not think i used enough cinnamon sugar on top of the milk, it still tastes amazing. I did not measure how much, but just sprinkled it on the dough. I also wanted different fillings so i wanted to roll them invidually. I did craisens in one loaf. The only thing i would change next time is to chop them up a little. The bread still looks and tastes great but I think it would be better if they were more evenly distributed in smaller pieces. I will be gifting this bread to ma

I would have given this recipe a rating but there are a couple of suggested changes I would add to the recipe.  After I made my first attempt of bread, I reviewed the recipe and the photos other users posted up on Allrecipes and noticed that many photos included the raisins mixed in with the cinnamon&sugar mix.  This definitely helps incorporate the raisins evenly into the bread.   Baking time was a bit long.  I would probably check on it after 30 minutes.  I like it just golden brown because I don't like a crispy crust.

It's delicious bread, yes, but I used bread flour instead of all purpose, switched the milk for butter and omitted it on the top of the loaf, and rolled the loaf in cinnamon and sugar. I also added some skim milk powder to the bread itself. It's good, but I've had much better.

I give it a 4...even though it is an amazing recipe.  30 minutes was plenty long enough for the bread to bake perfectly.  The recommended 45 minutes would have burnt the daylights out of it!  At first I thought I had killed my yeast since the dough didn't double.  But once I had rolled it and put it in the pans to rest for the last hour, it did rise beautifully.  Both of my kids gobbled this up!  It is very, very good!  Next time I'm going to try it with brown sugar in the filling.

My first attempt at cinnamon bread, this turned out quite delicious.  I'm also delighted that it is so beautiful!  I used the precise quantities called for but based on other bread-baking experience, I changed the add-in order of ingredients.  I used my KA dough hook and since I didn't want the raisins beat up I added them last.  I forgot the melted butter until after the second rise and I think adding it at that late time may have affected the crust.  I'll report later the verdict from the four little guinea pigs next door.

I'm fairly new at the whole bread-baking thing, and my last several attempts have been not so successful. But making this bread gave me a major self-esteem boost. I did double the ooey gooey cinnamon/sugar filling and covered the loaves with aluminum foil for the last 10 mins of baking to prevent burning of the crust. The end result was absolutely beautiful. I love the spiral that came out crystal clear in each slice. I've been toasting this bread every morning, and topping it with cinnamon butter and some of the leftover cinnamon/sugar mix. Yum! Next time I think I'll add a little cinnamon to the dough mix like other reviewers have suggested!

Better than store bought!!! Thank you! I followed Deb's review for making dough in bread machine. Also,I made it a  little healthier,I used half wheat flour and half braead flour,used eggbeaters instead of eggs, and splenda in place of sugar in the bread. For the filling I used half brown sugar and half splenda. Wonderful.

The only change I made to this recipe is for the cinnamon mixture, I used 1/4 cup white and 1/2 cup light brown sugar. I made 2 loaves and a pan of cinnamon rolls. This made an amazing bread! I will look forward to making it again.

Very good, and I usually don't like raisins, but had a craving for cinn. raisin bread. This was my first time trying this kind of bread recipe. I used 6 cups white bread flour and 2 cups wheat bread flour, trying not to add too much more, although the dough was a bit sticky. I used my kitchen aid and kneaded until the dough came off the sides slightly and started up the hook, which wasn't far because there's so much dough. I sprinkled a little cinnamon in the dough, used golden raisins, and butter, not margarine, and brushed melted butter on the rolled out dough instead of milk. When it was time to transfer to a large bowl, I spread some oil around the bowl with my hands so I could better handle the dough, get it off the hook and out of the mixing bowl. I think I baked for about 35 minutes. I will definitely use this recipe again.

This is wonderful!  The ONLY prolbem I had is that I only baked it for 30 minutes as other reviewers suggested.  It was uncooked in the middle.  Such a disappointment after all the time and ingredients.  But that's not the fault of the original poster.  That's my fault.  I should have followed the recipe exactly the first time around.  Oh well.  The dough is fantasic to work with and I will be making this over and over again, only using the full 45 min. to bake!

How could anyone give this recipe anything less than a 5?! Turned out wonderful! Made it yesterday afternoon and by bedtime, WHOLE LOAF GONE! Did change a little. Didn't measure my cinnamon filling, just taste tested until right. I also used butter to moisten dough instead of milk. I also left out the raisins b/c didn't have any on hand. Will definately make this again and again. Thanks so much for a great recipe! Not just from me, but also the family.

Absolutely delicious. Even after its frozen, it stays good. Its light, but not too light. Of the three loaves, only one made it past a week.

This is EXCEPTIONAL bread. All we kept saying, while biting into the warm, mouth watering, perfectly sweet bread, was "Wow, Oh my God!" 

The only thing I changed; I used 3 C. whole wheat flour. Other than that, I did everything as written.

You *have* to make sure the water temperature is exactly right when dissolving the yeast, otherwise you'll have a disaster. If you don't have a thermometer, just put your hand in the running water until it's just a little too hot, then turn it down to just bearable. By the time you put it into a cool bowl, it should be about 110 degrees F.

I made this bread last night and it was pretty easy and very tasty.  The only thing I would change would be to roll the raisins up with the cinnamon sugar instead of putting them straight into the dough.  I cooked mine for 40 mins, covering with foil after 20 mins to keep the top from burning.

Simple and delicious!  The top looked a bit dry, though.  I think next time I'll try an egg wash.  It was a cold day when I made it, so to aid the rising process, I preheated the oven to 500 for about a minute, turned it off, and let the dough rise in there.

This was my very first bread recipe--or ever using yeast. I was so nervous but the loaves turned out great! My dad's birthday is coming up and I wanted to surprise him by baking some bread that resembled his favorite bakery's bread that closed down. I froze 2 loaves and baked the other one. I just had to try it to make sure it turned out okay--and it was fantastic! So moist and the top was nice and crunchy. With the cinnamon mixture I combined 1/2 stick melted butter, 3 tablespoons cinnamon, and 1 cup of brown sugar, and raisins. I sprinkled that on top and the brown sugar and butter really made the bread moist. SO GOOD! I ate half a loaf last night! TRY THIS RECIPE!

I've already made two batches of this bread.  Each loaf lasts, maybe a day or two.  My kids, husband, the children I babysit, friends who stop by, and myself love this bread! It is so good with toasted with butter or spread with honey and almond butter.
I have adjusted the recipe a bit.  I use a mix of freshly ground flours (Prairie Gold, hard red, aramanthe, quinoa and oat), plus I use two cups of raisins and up the cinnamon sugar mixture by 1/3.  I also use sucanat instead of sugar.  
I have to take half the recipe out of my kitchen aid mixer before the kneading process begins.  I knead half in the micer for 6 minutes, than take that out and do the other half.  It makes three nice size loafs.  I love this recipe and will be making it often.

This is the best cinnamon raisin bread. I do the dough in my bread machine---but don't add the raisins until it's rolled out and I'm adding the cinnamon/sugar mixture. That way, there is a nice ribbon of raisins in the swirl part. YUM!

This is excellent cinnamon raisin bread.  I've never made any, and I wanted a swirled bread, so I tried this!  I made the dough in my bread machine, putting the raisins in at the fruit/nut beep, then continued as the recipe states.  Bf and I both love it.  I forgot to grease the top of the loaves or brush with melted butter, but it was still delicious.  Very pretty as well!  Thanks for sharing.

This was delicious!!  I think my yeast was not very good, or that I was just impatient because my bread did not bake up as high as I had hoped, but it tastes great.  Made it in 2 tube pans instead of loaves.  I added more raisins and chopped walnuts to the swirl before rolling up to put in the pans, next time I will double the cinnamon and sugar called for because my swirl came out very faint after baking.  I made two with the idea of taking one to work, but now I don't think I can pry the second one from my BF's hands!

I used 1/2 WW and 1/2 AP flour, used flax in place of eggs, canola oil instead of butter and soymilk instead of dairy. The bread still came out soft and perfectly flavored. A really really good, easy bread.

I have made this 2 times in the past week. Last night I froze one loaf of dough.  I just wrapped it in plastic wrap before the second rise.  I'm sure it won't be long before I pull it out and bake it, but the work of making it is already done :)  The only thing I changed was more raisins.  But that is obviously a personal preference, nothing to do with the original recipe.  My Husband and children love it toasted with butter!!

This was my first time trying this recipe. I substituted 2 cups of fine whole wheat flour for two cups of the all-purpose flour. They still came out well, although they probably didnยดt rise as high as they would have without whole wheat flour.

Very good and easy...I did not make a glaze for the top....but next time I will, I think it would make it just that much better.  I noticed that it dries out quickly...but I think all cinnamon raisin bread tends to do so.

Besides the fact that it took a whole afternoon to make, this bread is delicious!  The three loaves vanished in two days.  The whole family loved it.  I added raisins, about 1/3 cup, and I would even put 2 cups in next time I make it.  That is my only modification.  Thank you for the great recipe!

Mmmm....this came out really nicely and made 3 great loafs for one one time the effort.  The only thing I would change is maybe make more filling (the swirls were thin) and for sure add another CUP of raisins.

So good! I added some nutmeg and ground cloves to the cinnamon sugar mixture. I was worried that I had messed up because my loaves had lots of air pockets after the second rising, but they turned out perfect! Thank you for the recipe!

Definately a recipe I will try again but next time will only bake it for 30 minutes. Also, I agree with others about increasing the cinnamon and raisins. All in all a keeper recipe that all 4 of my fussy-eater kids enjoyed.

I made this two nights ago. It was the first batch of yeast bread I've ever made. I read the reviews before hand, and stuck with the recipe exactly. Everyone seemed to think it needed more cinnamon but other then that it was very good. Thanks for helping me through my first bread baking experience!

This was a really great recipe. I made it for my friends and fiance and it was gobbled up. One suggestion, make sure you roll up the bread tightly or else you will have big pockets of air in your otherwise perfect loaf.

I used 2 cups of raisins and a quarter cup more of the sugar/cinnamon mix.  This made three HUGE loaves and was really easy to make.  I also only baked them for 30 minutes and they were fine.

I used my bread machine for this loaf & had to customize it to 3 1/2 cups of flour. FANTASTIC!! I didn't have eggs, so I used egg substitute and 1/2 tblspn olive oil and just as much warm water an egg would be. I used dried mixed fruit instead of raisins in the fruit dispenser and just added the cinnamon, margarine, 2 1/2 tblspn white sugar to the whole loaf at the beginning. I added an extra tsp of cinnamon to the loaf and it tastes great! So more or less dispered the swirl throughout the whole loaf and it tastes wonderful toasted under the grill.

This really was terrific and pretty much fail-safe.  I've been looking for a recipe low in sugar and without preservatives to feed by toddler, who devours raisin bread.  I seriously cut back on the sugar called for in the recipe - at least half in the bread mix and even less in the cinnamon swirl.  It worked out just fine.  I'm always surprised by how much sugar Americans have in their bread anyway.  The only other thing I noticed was that it didn't really seem to have a lot of raisins in it.  Not that I'm a huge fan of raisins. But I think next time I would at least increase the amount of raisins by half again, if not double it.  Thanks for a great recipe.  It went down a treat with everyone, even with my fussy parents!

This bread is fantastic.  It is mildly sweet and delicious just sliced and buttered or toasted.   I thought it would last long enough to try making it into french toast but we gobbled it up too fast.       I made 2 changes:  I used butter instead of margarine and I used half Bread Flour and half regular unbleached flour.   It produced a dough that was easy to work with and loaves that were beautiful to slice.  (Sometimes you bake a cinnamon raisin bread and there are gaps between the rolls and it's kind of a mess but not with this recipe).    The only tips I have to offer are 1. Don't obsess over the measurement of flour.   Add the flour slowly until you have a dough that is smooth and comes away from your clean, dry hand.  It may be more or less than 8 cups, depending on the humidity of your room and the type of flour you use.     2.  Be careful not to overbake it.  I checked the oven at 35 minutes to make sure it wasn't too brown.   I gave two of these loaves to friends and they loved it so you can bet I'll be making this one again and again.   Thank you, Faye!

I've made this so many times by now and every time I make it it comes out perfect.  The three loaves never last.  It's excellent toasted with peanut butter and jam.  It's plainly divine.  Instead of many one big roll and cutting it, I just divide the dough in three and roll each out individually.  Sometimes I add chopped apples to make cinnamon raisin and apple bread.  It's just sooooooooooo good!  Also, the recipe is fool-proof.  It's impossible to mess this one up, it works every time.

My grandmother has a raisin bread recipe that has been passed down from generation to generation.  Although it would be considered a sin to add cinnamon to her recipe, I felt this was just as close to her wonderful recipe!!  I aboslutely love the cinnamon swirled throughout the bread.  Very good toasted with butter or cream cheese.  I just wish this didn't stale so quickly - but unfortunately us home cooks don't have all those preservatives to keep it fresh for days and days!!  I did, however, take the stale bread and use it for french toast.  Added a bit more cinnamon to my egg mixture - oh so yummy!!  My boyfriend gobbled it up quicker than I could make it - so you could say he approved, too. :)

SOOOOOOO GOOOOOD! I have had fun with this recipe from start to finish. This is a nice dough to work with. I used 2 cups of raisons and a little more then 7 cups of flour. I decreased the baking time by about 15 mins. The loafs came out beautiful. Next time I might use some brown sugar with the white sugar and cinnamon mixture. I will use this again.

I made this recipe with one major change.  I used whole wheat flour instead of white and it turned out wonderfully.  We all loved them.  They were moist and flavorful.  I did add more raisins though.  Great bread and will definitly make again.

This recipe is awesome!  Instead of using the raisins, I diced up some granny smith apples and turned it into apple cinnamon bread.  Everyone absolutely loved it!  It's also great as french toast.  The recipe was precise right down to the cooking time.

First, I will say that this bread is wonderful. It looks so pretty when sliced, and it has a nice contrast between the not-so-sweet bread and the sweet and cinnamony swirl. I left out the raisins--not a big fan of them in bread (oatmeal cookies, yes). Second, I must say that this bread reminded me of the dangers of hot sugar! I burned my hand pretty bad flipping this one out of the pan, so a warning to the young and inexperienced--use a towel when flipping the bread out of the pan!

Oh WOW!  What a wonderful dough.  Used my KitchenAide to mix and knead the dough.  Had to add a bit more flour, but dough is just BEAUTIFUL and easy to shape and work with.  This is the way Cinnamon Raisin Bread should be - not that messed up brown stuff that comes out of the bread machine.  By the way - I love my bread maker, but not for this kind of bread.

Great recipe Faye... Although it was hard work, it turned out great. I gave one loaf as a gift and froze one roll to try out as cinnamon rolls. The third one, between my husband and i, was gone in two days! I also used brown sugar instead, and used a little extra cinnamon and raisins. tasted great toasted.

If I could rate this higher than 5 stars I would. It is excellent. I halved the recipe and it still made 2 nice sized loaves. The only part that I didn't halve was the raisins and the sugar/cinnamon mixture for the center swirl. Thank you for a recipe that will be made over and over again.

So incredibly tasty.  I was completely chuffed when the family were surprised and impressed when they cut it open to reveal the cinnamon and sugar swirls.  :-)  

I am doing something wrong though because the ends of the loaf rise up high and the middle kind of, well, sinks.  Can anyone suggest how I fix this?

As a first time bread baker, I was a little intimidated by the recipe at first- but I could not resist the challenge due to the wonderful reviews it had. . so my twin 3 year old sons and I tried it today.. and it was fun and came out sooo YUMMY!!! I gave my mother and sister a loaf and it was a hit with them too. Thanks so much for giving us a boost of confidence.. this success encourages me to continue to learn to bake- it's Worth it!

A very tasty raisin bread... I usually double the amount of raisins use butter instead of margarine and substitute 2 of the 8 cups with whole wheat flour for a more natural bread with a little more texture.  Yuh-me!

This was my first time making cinnamon raisin bread and it turned out great!  It was fairly simple to make and everyone LOVED it!  I cut the recipe in half since I only had one loaf pan and I added more raisins.  I will DEFINATELY make this again

This is the best and closest to the bread my mom used to make. 
The only things I change are using bread flour, adding another 1/2 cup raisins, which I soak in warm water to soften prior to using, and I use melted butter not milk on the rolled out bread prior to sprinkling plenty of cinnamon and sugar! 
I also rollout thinner to get more decadent swirls!!!

This bread turned out so good. I soaked the raisins for 30 mins before I added them to the bread. Also I sprinkled the leftover cinnamon and sugar over the top of the loaf.

This bread is easy to make and i'll do it again but I agree that the baking time is way too long and I followed the directions and ended up with over cooked bread. Butter helps but next time i will decrease the cooking time. I only wished had read other reviews before putting the loaves in the oven.

Great recipe. The kids loved it but requested extra raisins, cinnamon, and sugar next time.  I followed the advice of another reviewer. I noticed the bread was browning quickly at 350 so after 15 minutes I turned it down to 300. At 30 minutes I turned the oven off and at 40 minutes it sounded hollow. Came out amazing.

Super easy, second time I've made it. This time went better as I didn't not roll as tight before baking and I didn't over proof the loaves. It does not take 45 minutes to bake, at least in my oven, only about 35.

Ok, I've made a lot of bread over the years with limited success- but this recipe came out brilliantly! I made half a half recipe and It was moist, rose to a good height and tasted delicious! I can't stop devouring it! My crumb was a lot tighter than the cover picture, but it is not too dense and still soft. I made these two substitutions: to add some extra nutrition; I used 1/2 cup of oat bran as part of the AP flour amount called for, and used half and half to brush the dough before adding the cinnamon sugar. Both worked well, and I may tinker with different types of flours next time I make it. I also upped the cinnamon (how can you go wrong?) and raisins. This will become a long-time favorite! Thank you for sharing!

This is a very good recipe. The review suggestions that I followed were:
Add a pinch of sugar to the yeast to get it good and foamy.
Double the amount of raisins.
Sprinkle a bit of cinnamon to the dough.
Don't worry about the dough being sticky.
Double the filling mixture.
Roll the filled dough tight.
Only bake for 30 minutes or so.

I prefer an egg wash for the loaves, and I sprinkle the tops with "chunky" sugar for a special treat.

Great and easy. Second time around added more salt, left out raisins and cinnamon. That was also great. Third time used 2 cups whole grain flour and the rest bread flour, fabulous also.
All 3 times needed 1 extra cup of flour, the dough felt too soggy, maybe eggs were too large. Also baking was done at about 33 mts. All told will keep making this bread because everyone loves it, and its gone before we know it. Thanks!

I've never made cinnamon raisin bread before and this was a huge success! On the advice of other reviewers, I added extra cinnamon to the sugar and set my oven timer for 30 minutes instead of 45.  The recipe doesn't indicate the first rising time, but I gave it an hour.  I will definitely make this again.

First time breadmaker here. This was pretty easy and came out great. mine was a little dough-y. Not sure if it needed more time to bake or more time to rise or if I just added too much flour? Also, I agree with the comments about reducing baking time. Mine took 30 mins at 350, not 45. 

Otherwise it was easy and excellent!

I have made this bread several times now and everyone goes wild for it. My brother said it is what he wants for his birthday this weekend so I will be making it again. For those of you that say it comes out dry: I have never had this problem, the main reason being that whenever I make bread of any type I never add all the flour stated all at once. Work a major portion of the flour in to start then gradually knead in only what you need to make a smooth dough. I also add 2.5 to 3 cups of raisins because that is how we like it :)

Just like my momma made it.  I followed several suggestions: mixed 1/2 WW Flour with white, but refrained from adding extra flour (the bread turned out nice and moist), and I soaked the raisins in rum to soften them and give extra flavor.  DELISH!

I tried this recipe twice and added extra flour both times because I felt the dough was too sticky to knead.  In each case, the bread turned out okay - it had a nice flavor but it was dry.  My solution was to toast it and add butter, which made it perfect!  I later watched a YouTube video showing that IT'S OKAY to have sticky dough, it recommended using a scrapper as you knead the dough.   So, resist the urge to add more flour and this should be just like dad made it!

Used this recipe in my bread maker and it was soft and delicious! I skipped out on the extra butter and cinnamon that I was supposed to roll into the dough and it was still wonderful. Compared to the standard cinnamon raisin bread recipe that came with the machine this is phenomenal and stayed fresh and soft until we finished the whole thing. The recipe from the box was so hard just few hours after sitting on the table. Great recipe and will definitely keep it for life

This was excellent! I added more cinnamon than it called for and next time will add more raisins. My oven is a little hot so I lowered the temperature and just checked it every 5 minutes after 20 minutes. The texture was perfect and was very moist. I've not had success with a cinnamon raisin bread recipe like I have with this one. It's a keeper!

I make this recipe very often. It's a great breakfast bread. I throw in cranberries as well as a diced Granny Smith apple. I also proof my yeast in the water that I reconstitute the raisins and cranberries in.  I also cut the white flour in half and sub wheat flour for the other half. I've made it both ways.... By the recipe and my own and it's great both ways

Wonderful recipe. I triple the raisins (we love raisins) and add them just before the dough comes out of the mixer so they don't squish. It's perfect. Freezes well, but tends to get hard and dry if not eaten within three days. However, tastes so good it won't last 3 days!

Found this to be a very bland (and by day two dry) raisin bread.  The bread itself needs cinnamon and a touch more sugar to go with the swirl.  I make a lot of bread, and this recipe will not be joining my rotation. It baked fine and looks great, but the taste is meh.

Loved this recipe.  Made a few changes like only adding about 6 1/2 cups of flour.  It came out GREAT.  I also soaked my raisins in about 1 cup of spiced rum and 1 tsp vanilla that I heat on the stove.  I added only the raisins to the dough.  I used the left over Rum/Vanilla mix instead of the milk when roling the dough to add the cinnamon swirl!

A Favorite amongest family & friends, this bread doesn't last the night in this house! It is wonderful toasted the next day (if it survives the night) Adding dehydrated blue berries with the raisins is also very tasty! Very simple to make, and taste delicious!

Absolutely Delicious! Hubby says better than the pick-two bread restaurant up the street (you know the one)! I made this recipe as written BUT with a couple of minor changes: I used Bread Flour AND I split the ingredients in half and used my bread machine for the mixing, kneading and first rising. For the first half batch, I made two loaves in my oven. For the second half, I rolled the dough out into a longer rectangle and sliced into 24 rolls. Those are three pans of eight each--breakfast for my family, and am sending the other two pans home with my children's friends. Oh, yes--30 minutes was plenty of time in both of my ovens. Thank you Faye!

What a fantastic bread this was!!  My family and I adored this bread and could hardly wait for it to cool down before digging in.  I was relieved to see that though the outside crust of the bread was quite solid, the inside was moist and fluffy as I was hoping for in a good cinnamon raisin loaf. I used unbleached all purpose flour.  I used butter instead of margarine, and quick rise yeast (made the water a little warmer than what was called for--I don't know if this made a difference or not...yeast is always iffy for me, the proofing time seemed to be the same as active dry) and cut down the recipe to one loaf. Note about this: I cut down to 12 servings to make one decent size loaf, but if you want it to fill the pan, 16 or 18 servings might give you the desired amount of dough for one loaf pan.  I omitted the butter glaze, because we all spread margarine on our own slices so that step was unnecesary for us.  This bread recipe could be used as a base for many other add ins or just as a plain loaf. Thanks so much!

This bread was to die for. However, I really don't need 3 loaves and there's no room in my freezer so I calculated the recipe for 1 loaf. Here's what I came up with: 1/2 cup milk, 1/3 cup water, 2 1/4 tsp. yeast, 1 egg, 2 Tbsp. +2 tsp. sugar, 1/4 tsp. salt, 2 2/3 cups flour 1/4 cup brown sugar 2 tsp. cinnamon, and 2 tsps. melted butter.

This bread, in my humble opinion, is low on the salt...... but some people might like that, especially those that are watching their salt intake.

I have been on a "mission" to find the perfect cinnamon raisin bread and I just found it! I am relatively new to bread making, and this recipe was easy (and fun) to make. I made my dough the night before and let it cold rise overnight in the fridge, and then pulled it out the next morning for the second rise. This made three of the most beautiful loaves. It slices very well, and the texture is just simple plain perfection. So yummy toasted with a little pat of butter. I will be making again and again.  Thank You !!

Excellent bread but it was almost too much cinnamon.  I never thought it would be possible to say that.  The dough was kind of sticky and wasn't very easy to work with.  I read what others wrote about only cooking it for 30 minutes, I checked at 30 minutes and it wasn't even close, unfortunately I ended up opening up the oven more than I normally would which may have messed up how it baked.  It smelled awesome though and we will still make it again.  Update: made it again and put about a tsp of sugar in when I proofed the yeast. Definitely need to keep the dough in the mixer as long as you can before you knead it.  I kept the rectangle more even and tight and it cooked up beautifully. Kids said they liked it better than store bought.

Im giving this 5 stars because it tasted FANTASTIC but I had to cook it at 300 degrees fro 32 minutes. Also, if your going to use a bread machine to make dough, roll the raisins in with the sugar. Otherwise you will have tiny bits of raisin through the bread. I also prefer it with brownsugar rolled in. VERY good with these modifications.

Delicious! And not very difficult. I did 5 cups AP flour 3 cuprs Whole Wheat flour. I let it rise 12 hours in the fridge. I forgot to put the raisins in during the first rise! I just pt them in when I rolled the dough with the sugar/cinnamon and it came out great! I'll be making this again. Thank you for this recipe.

I'm not an expert bread maker, but this recipe was easy to follow and my bread turned out great! I wasn't sure if I would actually get the 3 loaves lised as the yield, but I sure did!  I wish the bread was a bit sweeter, next time I'll just try to add a whole cup of sugar instead of just a 1/2 cup.  Although, my husband did eat half a loaf by himself the first day I made these.  I had to hide the other two so they'll last.  It is a great recipe, I'll definately be making this again!

First, but only cinnamon raisin bread recipe i'll ever use. I didn't have any raisins so i substituted cranberries, but followed the rest of the recipe carefully and they turned out magnificent!!
Very soft, moist, and delicious with just the perfect amount of sweetness!

Made exactly as the recipe states (with the exception that the bake time should be more like 20 minutes, not 45!) and this is fabulous!  I made a batch and gave the loaves out for Christmas, and everyone absolutely loved it.  I've made again since and have found it slightly improved by adding a little cinnamon to the bread dough in addition to what goes in the swirl, and I also prefer using melted butter instead of milk for the swirl.  I also prefer it with about one extra teaspoon of salt and a teaspoon of vanilla in the dough.  I'm about to make another batch for thank you gifts for various people - can't think of a better way to show appreciation than with this bread!

Hands down my family's favorite raisin bread!  I do also add 1 medium grated apple to the mix, it seems to help keep the bread more moist without making the dough too sticky.  Makes great PB&J's to perk up school/work lunch and so good with just butter too!  I make this every single week.

Amazing recipe! I used 2 C whole wheat flour and 5 C all-purpose flour in the main dough and then added about a cup of all-purpose during kneading. Used butter in place of margarine (semi-melted in microwave). Also proofed the yeast with 1 t sugar. Didn't need all of the sugar/cinnamon filling, either.

I just made this bread and my oh my is it delicious! I ended up making it into 4 loaves with a 5th "mini" loaf. It took mine a little longer to bake for some reason, but I had no problem with them burning, I just left them in the oven until they were brown on all sides. Once they were cooled I drizzled a powdered sugar glaze on top, Soooo good!

This is the first time i have ever made bread and it was delicious! It is a little hard to gauge the cook time, but the first time is always an experiment. I used a couple of different pan sizes and the small ones came out perfect.

I made a few changes by not roll the cinnamon butter mixture into the dough and used it as a glaze. after baking and letting the bread cool I then sliced it into 1 inch thick slices and dipped the bread into A 6 egg 2 cup of milk mixture and served it as French toast for my kids and family. It was a huge hit. Also I sprinkled confectionate sugar with fresh maple syup.

I scaled this down to make two loaves.  I had to guess with the yeast as I didn't have any packets and wouldn't have used 1 1/4 packets anyways, so I did 2 1/2 tsp.  I upped the raisins to a full cup and will increase that to add least a cup and a half next time.  I used a mixture of bread and all purpose flour.  This is a nice, sweet raisin bread recipe that I will for sure be using again.

Too sweet for our tastes. The dough was too puffy and it was hard to toast because the rings of dough separated.

I have not had very much success baking yeast bread in the past but decided to try this recipe when my son was home from college for the weekend.  It went together quickly and rose up just like it was supposed to.  I had high hopes.

When I took it out of the oven I glazed it with a cream cheese glaze from this site.  The bread smelled amazing and the first slices were pretty good, just not excellent.

It was so dry as to be almost inedible by the second day.  I had wrapped it in plastic wrap and then a freezer zip lock bag.  I paid attention and followed the directions as closely as possible.  I'm hoping someone who is a better baker than I am will tell me what I did wrong.  Now I have 2 loaves of dry bread.  I think I will use the leftovers for a cinnamon raisin bread pudding.

We really liked the taste but I was expecting for it to be lighter. It was dense but once I figure out how to make it lighter, it will be perfect.

This bread is FABULOUS! I even forgot to let it rise the first time and it still turned out great. We used half freshly-ground whole wheat flour and half bread flour and it's light & fluffy and moist. We made one large loaf and 5 mini loaves. Definitely a keeper!

Wonderful warm cinnamon raisin bread was a hit with the family. I added more raisins due to personal tastes but, no other subs were made. Excellent addition to my bread arsenal!

Absolutely wonderful!  3 loaves was a bit much for us so we cut the servings down to 24 and made 2-one in the freezer and one on the counter.  We also cut way down on the amount of sugar and cinnamon that we spread on the dough and used evaporated cane juice in place of refined sugar. What we ended up with was a delicious subtly-sweet bread that was a delectable complement for whatever we choose to spread on it!  Try toasting a slice with a bit of Land O' Lakes "spreadable butter with canola oil"! YUM!

Well, I totally pulled a *Lucy* on this one - I cut recipe in 3rd as I had 2 different recipes I wanted to try, and failed to catch AR didn't reduce the amount of yeast properly.  They kept it at 1 package ... so after 45 minutes of rising, my bread was exploding over the sides of pan.  Went ahead and baked (sure it would totally collapse), but YIPPIE!  It held up!  Nice, light and fluffy beyond belief lol.  I do wish there was more cinnamon flavoring in bread, but I'm sure that was my error.  Nice sweet dough.  Will def make again.

I made this bread and everyone said it tasted great, I personally didnt care for it but everyone has their won opinion as far as taste goes.. The only problem I had with this bread and Im sure its something I did wrong, after the bread was baked and it cooled and was cut.. the bread where the swirls of cinnamon is, didnt stay together, so it would come apart, is it the milk, should I have used something else to make the cinnamon stick?  other than that i had no problems with the bread.. Thanks for the recipe!

Made it once following the recipe (minus the raisins) and it was great!  To make it healthier, now I use 2 cups whole wheat flour, the rest bread flour (makes for a better texture).  I also substitute 3/4 cup flaxseed for 1/4 c of the margarine.  I skip the butter in the "filling" and use brown sugar in place of some of the white.  Still yummy, and almost guilt-free!

wonderful, but I made a few changes. I used 2 cups of golden raisins (soaked in warm water for an hour), and my baking time was about 5-7 minutes less. My butter did not mix well, so I heated the sugar,egg, butter, milk mixture over low heat until it melted.

This recipe is awesome!  Came out really moist, just sweet enough.  Delicious toasted!  Makes three loaves so its totally worth the time.  I added a little cinnamon to the dough, used half and half to moisten the dough instead of milk, and substituted a cup of wheat flour for some of the all purpose.  This was the best yeast bread recipe I have ever tried, really good!  Oh yea I might add a few more raisins next time, like 1/4 cup.

Excellent recipe.  I scaled it to make 1 loaf.  I substituted 1 cup sourdough starter for the milk, water and yeast and reduced flour by 1 cup.  This made a nice moist dough.  Baked for 45 min. at 350 degrees as directed and it came out perfectly.

bland, bland, bland.  of course that didn't stop me from toasting it, slathering on butter and eating it like there's no tomorrow! next time i'd use more raisins, more cinnamon, some whole wheat flour maybe? i'd also halve the recipe.  it was a HUGE amount of bread.  my husband liked it, so i sliced it up and put it in the freezer for him to toast for breakfast.

This bread is the best. I got a little scared when it was rasing, but it turned out great. It is a dense bread with good flavor. I did not change a thing. And I am not going to. Thank you !

this is a great recipe. i make it to take into work and get rave reviews (if i don't eat half of it before i manage to package it up). i mix up a larger amount of the cinnamon/sugar to sprinkle on the rolled-out dough and it makes for sweeter gooier swirls.

Overall great recipe. The cooking time definitely needs to be decreased- I baked mine for 35 minutes and it was still a bit too dry. When I greased the pan I coated with with the left over cinnamon sugar to add more cinnamon flavor and it turned out really nice. Maybe even adding some cinnamon to the dough itself would be good.

This is a very tasty bread, but I substituted brown sugar instead of white.    To the previous reviewer, one thing I recall an experienced baker telling me is that fresh milk does need to be heated, as the enzymes weaken the gluten in the dough.  Using powdered milk makes this step unnecessary as you mentioned.

Currently trying to make this bread and the dough is so sticky!! Have added at least an extra two cups of flour and have kneaded the dough to death.  Poor cinnamon raisin bread! I fear for your future edibility!

Very good and beautiful, it was a little dry, but that could have been my fault because i halved the recipe and instead of adding one and a half eggs ( the original recipe calls for 3 eggs) i only used one large egg, but all in all this is a great recipe!

My mother & I made this together because we thought it wold be nice, clean, hard work. Well, it was, but it turned out horridly. At first, it was nice the cinnamon was melty and fresh, but then it was hard and it just tasted like regular whole grain bread. I think that if you add double the raisens and cinnamon, it'd be a solid four stars.

This recipe was so easy to follow and tastes great!  My boyfriend wanted Cinnamon Raisin Bread and he thought it would be something we could make together!  The smell that came from the oven was so delightful! Thank you so much for posting this recipe!  I topped it with Turbinado Sugar instead of the butter! Yummy!

This definitely lives up to all the five star reviews and is a really delicious bread.    A couple of comments based on what others have said. 1) I have an oven thermometer and I'm certain my oven was at 350 degrees.  It took 27 minutes for two loaves to brown nicely.   2) I'll definitely pinch the edges next time as the cinnamon sugar seeped out the ends after baking. 3) This is a *bread* and not a pastry.  As a bread, it's plenty sweet and cinnamon-y.  My husband has pronounced it better than his favorite store-bought version, which was my goal.

Okay at best, glad I read lots of reviews cause it only needed to cook for about 25 minutes for me, and there was not very much cinnamon taste next time I will use a different recipe.

I loved this bread!  It turned out very pretty, not to mention tasty.  The only reason I gave the recipe 4 stars instead of 5 is that it was so large!  I actually made only 1/3 of the recipe.  I was very pleased with the results.

Wow, this recipes rocks! I have only made bread once before, but this recipe is really easy and I didnt have much of a problem. I did cut the batch in half and still ended up with 2 loaves. I also, after reading a few other reviews, cut up some apples and added that to a loaf before I rolled it up. I took them to work and they were gone when I turned around!!!! Great in the toaster with the slightest bit of butter. Yummy.

I haven't even eaten any yet (it's on the last rising) but I'm already giving it 5 stars just because it's rising so beautifully, I'm sure it will be fantastic! I exchanged a 1/4 cup of the white sugar for the filling for brown sugar.

This recipe deserves 5 stars. I live in the north so it took 7 hours total to rise twice and bake but was well worth it after it was baked. I mixed it as is this first time but will try some of the lower fat suggestions on this site like using splenda and brown sugar, and part whole wheat. But if you want bread the good ol' fashioned way, prepare just as the recipe says. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Not as sweet as I expected and it was also much denser then I thought it would be.  Makes good toast.  However, I will not make it again.

Great Recipe.  Only made one loaf instead of three.  Did not use loaf pan - just baked the loaf on a cookie sheet. Good alternative for those whose loaves are longer than the loaf pan. It turned out great.

This was a really easy recipe and so delicious. It turned out three very beautiful loaves of bread. My family of five ate one loaf before it had cooled.  I will be making this for a long time.

My mon loves cinnamon raisin bread and I tried this recipe for the 1st time about 6 months ago and she loved it. I make 4 loaves at a time cut them and freeze them for my mom. I usually have alittle dough let over and take the rest of the dough and make cinnamon buns with it.

Yum! I gave this a 4 because I did tweek it just a bit. First I added vanilla to the dough, and I doubled the amount of raisins and filling, which in hind site, I probably won't do again- double only one or the other, not both. This bread is great just out of the oven, and just as good the next morning toasted. Make sure you roll the loaves EXTRA tight to ensure you end up with a tight swirl. I apparently got lazy on one of my loaves and had large gaps between the top layer and the rest of my loaf... which makes it impossible to toast- all the raisins kept on falling out- but that was TOTALLY my error!! Also, as a side note- some of my loaves were too long to fit into the pans, so I had to cut the ends off- in the fashion of "waste not want not" I baked them up on their sides, cinnamon roll style- hummina, hummina- OMG SO good! You could absolutely use this recipe to make raisin cinnamon rolls! So good!

I cut the recipe in half and used the suggestion of starting with 30 minute cook time.  The other suggestions to add a little cinnamon to dough, brown sugar instead of white, and buttering the top before baking gave me a golden brown, flaky piece of heaven.  Too much cinnamon in the dough can make it not raise enough, so use caution!  Thank you so much!  P.s.  I started it all in the bread maker and used caution with additional flour when I saw the gooey mess.

I have made this bread over and over and over again.  If there is none in the house I get complaints!!  It is wonderful!!  When a hot batch comes out of the oven, my 17 y.o. son cannot wait to cut into it.  The only suggestions I have are to watch it as it bakes.  As someone else suggested, it is usually done after 30 minutes.  Also, to get a really full, puffy loaf I let it rise about 90 minutes after putting it in the pan.  Love this recipe though!!  Thanks!!!

It was okay. You need to roll it really tight in order to get a good swirl going. The bread was a little dry for my taste and fell apart if I tried to toast it.

This is great bread.  I only had two loaf pans, so I used the "extra" dough and sliced them into cinnamon rolls.  They were great!  I may make them all rolls next time as the kids loved them.  The bread rose and baked up very nice.  This bread is not too sweet, so it is good for breakfast.

I halved the recipe and made two 8x4 loaves and a smaller loaf. I added 1 T of cinnamon to the flour mixture and kept the original cinnamon sugar. Delicious! My loaves don't have the pretty swirl as I messed up the dough and ended up just dumping the cinnamon sugar in and baking. Tastes great with butter!

I had such high hopes for this recipe - the bread turned out very dry.  Maybe it's because I used measuring cups to measure the wet as well as dry ingredients 'cause I broke my Pyrex measuring cup.  I would appreciate any feedback, and will probably try again.

Delicious. Everyone in my family loved this recipe. I followed it exactly, save one item; my baking time was only about 30-35 minutes, so perhaps this is why some people complain about dryness. This bread was fluffy and had just the right amount of sweetness.

This recipe was great!  It had a nice texture and was plenty sweet enough.  I'll definitely make this one again! :)  The bread dough was pretty sticky for me after adding the recommended amount of flour.  I added a little extra (about 2/3 cup) to stiffen it up.  As other reviewers mentioned, the bread does brown really fast.  I put foil lightly over my loaves at 30 minutes and continued baking it for the recommended time.  It turned out great.  Also, the ends of the loaves need to be really folded under.  I just pinched them, and they unrolled during the second rising and baking.  (The bread was still great regardless).

I made this for The Hubby lastnight.  He is addicted to Raisin Bread and I was really growing tired of having to buy 3-4 loaves a week.  This recipe is spot on, in fact I believe Hubb's exact words were "oh my this is good stuff".  I will definitely be using this recipe, probably on a weekly basis.  In fact Im currently trying a different version of the recipe and making dinner rolls out of the dough.

I can't imagine bread any better than this!!  It is light and fluffy and so yummy.  The only thing I would change is a little more salt.  You won't be sorry trying this recipe!!  Thanks for sharing it with us!!   Hmmm...I'll bet it would be good as cinnamon rolls too....

Really good if you up the salt, raisins and cinnamon. It turned out great when I upped the flavors a bit. Nice and dense but not like a boulder. 

A few tips. Cut the edges of the dough when you roll it so it's a perfect rectangle otherwise it's a strange blob shape that makes it hard to roll. Go easy on the milk or you'll get a big oozy mess. 

I found it a bit hard to "tuck the edges in" so I just pulled the top and bottom layers of the bread together and pinched. wasn't that effective though. Oh well, more to do with my skills than the recipe!

Made this for the first time today.  Came out PERFECT.  And it is delicious.  This is great with tuna on it...the flavor combo is amazing.  Use as a sandwich bread or a breakfast bread.  Freeze it.  Eat it.  Love it.

OOOHHHHH...so good. Definitely one of the best raisin breads I've ever made. I added a little more cinnamon and raisins then it called for, just for a little more flavor. It turned out great! Three nice size loaves...enough to send a loaf out to my parents! My husband and daughter love this bread as well. I definitely will make it again!

Great recipe and honestly wasn't too hard to make with the help of my kitchenaid and the dough hook.  I used bread machine yeast (all I had on hand)and it worked just fine for me.  I also increased the raisins from 1 cup to 2 cups and am glad that I did.  This would be great with a glaze as well.  My husband made french toast with these yesterday and he said they were great tasting.  I didn't get to try them but thought I'd mention that.  Thank you for sharing the wonderfully easy recipe.

It wasn't as moist as I was hoping, but it was still good. I made the dough using my breadmachine. Worked great. I will make again in the future.

This was pretty good. The recipe calls for 1 1/2 eggs which kinda threw me for a loop....but I did the best I could to use 1/2 an egg! In all, it wasn't very hard to make and it turned out pretty good. It makes 3 loafs so there's plenty to go around!

great recipe.  I didn't have 3 loaf pans so I cut the recipe down by a third.  I had to shorten the baking time by 8 minutes - I wish I had taken about 12 off though.  It was a little dark on top but was great in the middle and on bottom.  I would try to measure my rectangle better the next time because when I rolled it up and then cut it into two loaves it was a little long for one of the pans and I had to scrunch the dough in the pan.  The bread still turned out great but the scrunching made the middle of the roll loosen up a but causing a slight gap in the swirl.  It gave it that homemade character so it was still good.  The loaves didn't last long.  Next time I'll buy a thrid loaf pan instead of cutting down the recipe.

I cut this recipe down to one third; dont' think my bread machine can take all that flour, but since my daughter ate almost the entire loaf herself, I will do the kneading myself next time and make the entire three loaves! I will add more raisins in the roll up, and maybe drizzle a little butter in that part also.  This is a wonderful recipe; a KEEPER!

Very, very good. This was also the first time that I've ever made a bread recipe with yeast. It took awhile for the yeast to get frothy in the water, so I turned the oven on, with the yeast/water mixture sitting on top of the oven, and this seemed to activate the yeast. I also agree that some sweet-tooth types like myself may prefer more of the cinnamon-sugar mixture. Overall, though, I'll definitely be making this again.

I made this recipe so it would only do 9 servings (just my husband and me so far) and it turned out GREAT!  It's just like the cinnamon bread you get at bakeries.

Bread was great.  I thought the amount of sugar was fine, although if you wanted it to taste like a cinnamon roll you could up the sugar.  It didn't seem to stay fresh for too long - first day was best.  But we loved it as french toast the following morning.

Overall a very good recipe.  I agree that it needs more raisins though.  Definately make sure you roll it very tightly or you'll end up with air bubbles in the middle of your swirl.  I also added the raisins on top of the cinnamon sugar rather than kneading them into the dough because I thought they might get mashed while I was kneading.

Moist bread that rose/baked well!  Very easy to work with.  Reccomend using extra sugar for filling if you want it very sweet though.  Overall going in my box of "keepers".

This was pretty good, although, I thought it lacked a little flavor.  I might try increasing the sugar.  I baked for 45 minutes and it was a touch overdone.

Definitely a keeper!  This loaf is delicious, moist, and wonderful all around.  I did make a few changes though.  I didn't have enough raisins, so I used about 1/2 chopped dried apples.  I used a mix of bread flour and white wheat flour.  Also, before rolling up the dough, I moistened the dough with 1 tbsp butter, not milk.  And instead of white sugar, I used brown sugar for the spice swirl.  Yummy!

The flavor was great, but my bread came out very dry. I am going to chalk it up to human error, maybe used to much flour or cooked a little too long. Next time, I will put a shallow pan of water in the oven while it is cooking. This made a very good toasting bread.

I was a little skeptical of all the incredible reviews this recipe had, but they're all true! This bread is wonderful. I made two loaves with a half-recipe and they were gone within a few hours - they were SO good. I'll make it again for sure (the whole recipe this time!)

thanks faye, for another great recipe! It was SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good. I made mine in mini aluminum pans--it made nine of them! wrapped them up for Christmas goodies in those little cellophane Christmas bags. Everyone loved them. Next time I will add more cinnamon, cause we are all crazy for cinnamon here! Thanks for a great treat!

I thought this was good, but it comes out very hard each time I have made it. I would like it a lot more if it was softer. It makes great toast with butter for breakfast. A family favorite the next morning.

Great bread!  Holds up to the knife, but soft and sweet... I used a bag of Hershey's Cinnamon Chips instead of the butter and cinnamon filling, just because I had one in the cupboard, and it came out great. Thanks!

I like to give this bread as a gift along with a jar of homemade apple butter.  I mix either raisins or chopped apples in with the dough.  I use the dough cycle of my bread machine to do the hard work for me!  When it comes out of the machine, I roll up the dough with the filling and let the loaves rise again for another 30 minutes.  Then I bake as directed in the recipe.  This bread makes great French toast...if you have any left over!

I made this and it turned out to be a total flop, but more my fault than the recipes I think.  I know I put too much flour (this was the first bread I made, I thought the dough needed to be thick like for gnocci).  It turned out that it wasn't completely cooked in the middle.  Will try again.

This is delicious bread (even though I got distracted and overbaked my loaves).  I omitted the raisins and added some cinnamon to the bread dough for extra cinnamon-y goodness.  Makes wonderful french toast, too.  Thanks!

Delicious bread!  Thank you for sharing this.  The only thing I did wrong is "killed my yeast" by getting my water too hot.  Yes, this was a major mistake but the loaves were still edible just flat. :) I will definately make this again and I learned from my mistake so hopefully the next batch will be fabulous!

This was definetly a "Mikey Likes It" recipe!  My whole family loved it!  I only need to remember next time to roll them a little tighter, one loaf was a little hollow!  Absolutely worth the time.

This recipe was excellent! My whole family loved it. I did however add extra sugar to the bread mixture. I like it to be sweet throughout not just in the cinnamon swirls! Thanks a bunch!

Excellent!  The perfect loaf of cinnamon raisin bread!  I doubled the number of raisins (to 2c.) and it was great.  Someone mentioned in an earlier review that there was a bit too much dough in a full batch for their Kitchenaid mixer.  To clarify, I have a 5 qt mixer and I had to finish kneeding by hand at the end - too much dough.  If you have the super-mondo mixer, you'll probably be fine.

I used 1/2 white flour and 1/2 whole wheat flour as well as egg substitute.  It turned out great, but I didn't need to bake the bread for as long as the recipe called for.

great recipe...I altered it a little with an extra cup of raisins, and lots more cinnamon-just because we love them-this is moist and not too sweet-toasts beautifully-I doubt any of this will last until breakfast in the morning!!

I have one word for this recipe, WONDERFUL!! I thought that it was very easy to make and I found the cook time and temp. exactly right. I did add more raisins and doubled the cinnamin sugar mixture, otherwise it is great. I like it with a little powered sugar and milk icing.

Great recipe. It was easy and the finished result was great. All three loaves were gone in 1 day.I made a loaf for my mother and she used it to make french toast and said it was the best. Thanks.

This was very good and easy to make. We don't like baked raisins so I didn't add them and it was still tasty and even better the next day in the toaster!

I love this bread! it's so good, some one stole one of the loaves from me in the dorm (I was very upset to say the least). I eat a slice of this bread with organic peanut butter and marmalade-it is absolutely mouth watering! I always get questions as to what I'm eating, and then jealous looks. ;)

This was my first time working with yeast, and this was a nice introduction.  However, a word of caution: be very careful working with the cinnamon/sugar, rolling, and cutting into thirds!  The best way to keep it inside the bread is to pinch off the ends instead of cutting it; it'll help keep the mess down.  I served it with buttermilk frosting.

This bread is very good.  I think next time I will add more sugar to the dough and put some cinnamon is as well.  It was much less sweet and cinnamon tasting as I thought it would be.  It could also stand more raisins.

This is the best cinnamon raisin bread I've ever had!  My mother agrees - and that says a lot.  Everyone I've given a loaf to loves it.  It makes tasty French Toast as well.

Wow!  What an awesome cinnamon bread recipe.  Very light and tender-using quick rise yeast cuts the time in 1/2.  This will be a favorite in our house!

it's absolutely amazing. I let it rise two hours before shaping, not sure if that makes a difference or not, but I wouldnt change a thing. if you want it a bit sweeter then you could prob double the filling as some other reviewers suggested.

Great recipe, I put twice as many raisins in and twice as much sugar and cinnamon.  I substituted brown sugar for white for the "roll".    It came out of the oven brown and tasty!

Delicious and smells great.  I'll cut the recipe by a third next time though since that was a good bit of dough to knead.

Followed recipe exactly using bread flour. Three generous loaves. Was done at 32 minutes though.  A keeper. Thank you. Will definitely make more often. Maybe try golden raisins, dried apricots or currants next.

This is wonderful bread. Just bake it for 30 minutes instead of 45. And whatever you do, donโt cover it when itโs rising the second time. I did, and taking the cloth off took off a big layer of dough and deflated the loaves.

I did not make any changes. This is the first bread I ever baked. It came out good. Although i had a tough time with kneading the dough as the dough mix was very loose.

If I could give this recipe a 10; I would!  It is by far the best bread recipe I've ever eaten.  It makes 3 full loaves and I could not get over how well it turned out.  It was easy and of course, it takes a while for the bread dough to rise twice but well worth every minute.  The best!!!!

Just made this with a slight twist. I added 1 1/2 apple (chopped small) and added it to the sugar and cinnamon then rolled the dough. My family loved this bread. Thank you for sharing??

We did exactly as the recipe said and it was delicious. In the future I would get fancy with it and add icing or some reduced apple pie filling for extra flavor.

I've been making this bread for 9 years. My family LOVES it, especially my son, who now at the age of 15, still gets excited when I make it. I don't deviate from the recipe too much... substitute almond milk and raw turbinado sugar. Extra cinnamon. Extra raisins. I've made it with both bread and all purpose flours and prefer the latter. Great for peanut butter sandwiches. So easy to make, and quick to get eaten up!!

Delicious bread ! I mixed mine in a bread machine and added raisins during that time , I followed the recipe exact except for subbed the white sugar for brown ( only because I had Costco size bag that needed to be used up ) the flavor turned out great but You could really tell the brown sugar was there ( I also doubled the sugar cinnamon)  - next time I'm gonna try the white sugar . I baked it for 25 min then checked internal temp to see how much longer it needed , (also added foil over the top ) it took 10 more min to reach done temp , so 35 total and it was perfect . Easier for sure to slice the next day - but my husband COULDNT WAIT ; )

This was so good! It came out really soft and light. Next time I might double the filling amount. Mine was done at 30 minutes. Make sure you donโt forget the salt like I did because the salt is really important!

made this last month and loved it. I did add some sugar to the yeast mixture and made two loaves and 20 cinnamon buns. I did cut the baking time to 35 minutes for the bread and 20 minutes for the cinnamon buns as my oven runs hot. Delicious. Will definitely make again. Also i plumped up the raisins by soaking them in hot water for 30 minutes before adding to mixture,. Oh and bye-the-way it won first place in our annual fair.

Only change I made was to soak the raisins for a few minutes.   The instructions were clear and easy to follow. Absolutely loved it and will definitely make it again

No, I did not make any changes. We loved the bread. I gave a loaf to my neighbour and her family and she said they all loved it. She said if she would have let the kids eat as much as they wanted, they would have had it gone in one feeding. I will continue making it. The next time I would like to try craisins instead of raisins. I am sure it will turn out to be just as good.

Lovely dough, beautiful to work with. My dough only required 6.5 cups of flour, other than that, exactly as written.     Makes fabulous cinnamon buns, canโt wait to make other sweet treats with the remainder.

I would try this bread recipe again. This time I would take more care in sizing the portions more equally. The final product was well received by my family.

Absolutely fantastic! I did make some adjustments: used half brown sugar and half white sugar. I substituted 2 cups of white whole-wheat flour instead of all white flour, used craisins instead of raisins, used butter instead of margarine, and added grated orange peel and a tablespoon of cinnamon to dough. I did double amount of filling, but will cut back a bit next time, as was almost too much filling. But they were fantastic! Will make many more times.

Love this bread, easy to make tastes great every time.  I did change a few things after the first time  ( I always make everything by the recipe the first time.)  I used bread flour, it just seems to rise better, use 11/2 to 2 cups raisins (I love them) used brown sugar just think it tastes better in cinnamon raisin bread then white also increased it to  1 1/4 cups. Increased the cinnamon a lot I use about 4 to 5 TBS. In mine but I like a lot of cinnamon.  Only bake it for 30 to 35 min. Thou mine always comes out great and I've used this recipe probably about 20 times. Perfect recipe for beginners and CV or experienced Baker's.

Tastes good but not amazing. It made three good sized loaves for me. Top formed some kind of crust which my kids liked but I didnโt care for it.

This a good recipe to use if you are making this bread for the first time. I made 1/2 the recipe and used suggestions from various reviewers.. I love cinnamon and raisins  so I added 2 tbsp of cinnamon powder and 1 cup of raisins in the flour.. The dough will be sticky.. Don't fret.. I just add a little butter on my hands to moisten the bottom and top, mostly to prevent the top from crusting while raising..

Recipie was amazing and easy to follow. Though cook time seems a little too long. I took my bread out 11 minutes earlier than instructed to or else it wouldโve burned.

I made mine with cranberries and we loved it. I usually let it sit in the fridge overnight and cook the loaves at separate intervals. My go to recipe for a sweet loaf right now, and like that its not overly sweet.  Am wondering if I can make it with poppy seed mixture, might try that next.

Made a half recipe (omitting the raisins) in my bread machine (just the mixing part). Turned out perfect to rave reviews-this is now my standard recipe. Love this!

I made this a little different than the recipe called for, as raisins are a migraine trigger for me. Rather than mixing into the dough itself, I sprinkled the raisins onto the dough after sprinkling with the cinnamon sugar mixture. I could have cut into 4 rolls worth, maybe more - the dough was extremely sticky, so I did end up using almost an additional 1-1.5 cups of flour for that.

This is a great recipe. I thought it might be too much for our small family, but it freezes beautifully and we had no trouble eating it all! I made two loaves and made rolls with the last third. Both came out well.  Maybe next time I'll use a bundt pan for the third loaf.

Delicious! I changed it so it would only make 2 breads (One for the freezer). I added a tsp of sugar to the yeast mixture per suggestions. I also decided to use bread flour and wheat flour instead of all purpose. Increased the raisins a bit too. This was so good toasted with butter and made the whole kitchen smell wonderful. Will definitely make again!!

Great recipe, everyone loves it. I shortened the baking time by 5 minutes, could probably shorten it a few more minutes. It is awesome plain or toasted with butter. I have yet to try it as  french toast.

Well, I watched the video and whom ever made it left out the milk step, and I always watch the video to make sure I didnโt leave it out anything or missed a step. Well they need to check it and redo it.I used gluten free all purpose flour, and truvia. I will not make this again it was a waste! Not happy how it came out. I wish I could leave out the star!

Oh my goodness, this recipe is to die for!  I'm on a cruel keto diet, but I made this for the first time for my boyfriend and my parents.  The smell in my apartment about brought me to my knees!  I did use King Arthur's bread flour and proof the yeast: other than that, no deviations from the recipe as written.  Any reasonably experienced baker would have zero problems with this recipe.  If however, you are NOT an experienced baker, PROOF YOUR YEAST!  This means you add a teaspoon or so of sugar to the warm water and the yeast - you then wait for the yeast to 'puff up'.  It's unmistakable - you should smell the yeast and there should be obvious little yeasty islands floating on the water.  Also, make sure the milk is not too hot or it will kill your yeast as well - if you don't have a thermometer, test the liquids just just like you would a baby's bottle.

My family say it tastes like a fabulous cinnamon bun - the crumb was nice and tender and the crust just right.  Follow the recipe (but proof your yeast!) and you'll have a family favorite.

Fantastic!
Added 2 tsp cinnamon to flour. Quartered 15 pitted prunes and added them at the very end.  Lowered the heat as many suggested.
Will be making this again and again!!!

This bread is amazing!  The dough is rich and so easy to work. I make it without raisins as my husband isnโt keen on them, otherwise I wouldnโt change a thing.  I like that the recipe makes 3 loaves...perfect for sharing with friends & family.  I do agree with other reviewers about the bake time. I baked this bread to perfection in only 30 minutes.

I made it because it reminded me of a bread we have over here in Barbados called 'Light Sweet' or 'Choice Bread'. I gave it a 4 star because it was pretty bland, practically tasted like nothing to me so next time additional sugar will be added. Upside is however is that the dough rose beautifully and was nice and moistly fluffy (if that makes sense). I've decided that the dough minus the raisins and cinnamon can be the perfect base for another bread.

Um. The video boneheadedly leaves out where you put in the milk, lol! And the yeast isnโt proofed in the video, it just goes in with the water first and then the eggs and the sugar and salt and then the flour. Very weird. Iโll still try the recipe using the written instructions, but I sometimes watch the videos for clarification, or, in Chef Johnโs case, because theyโre also entertaining. Please fix the video, though.

I made this with half whole wheat and half regular flour and it came out great. I had to add two tablespoons of half and half while mixing the dough because it became too stiff for mixing. It took about 90 minutes for the dough to double in size. Cooking time varied within my oven--all the loaves were baking on the center rack. One loaf was done in 40 minutes. The others finished in about 45 minutes. I will definitely make this again.

This was my first loaf of cinnamon raisin bread, and my sixth loaf of bread in general (I learned to make challah recently, and decided to try something else.)

I followed the recipe to the letter, and it worked wonderfully.  I got three loaves of wonderful smelling delicious fresh raisin bread.

The taste was good, but the dough was too dry and I had to add more butter to make it come together. I'll try it again to be sure I didn't make any errors.

I was able to make 3 loafs with this recipe. I baked it for 30 minutes after reading a few of the reviews but also needed an additional 15 minutes after checking. The bread is a bit bland. I will add vanilla extract next time. Photo provided.

The mobile version of this recipe last the first ingredient as 2 tbsp of milk when it should be 1 1/2 cups of milk. I would have had a disaster if i hadn't read the laptop version first.

This was the bomb! As others said, I didn't warm the milk and let the dough rest and rise in the fridge overnight before kneading, rolling, rising, and baking the next day. I cut the recipe to 1/3 for just one loaf and it turned out great. The only thing I'll change for next time is to add more cinnamon sugar to the middle!

This turned out well and had a great flavor. Just I'm used to either having it stated sifted flour or normal packed flour. I usually measure the three times if it is not stated sifted flour. So it would be very helpful if this is the case. I also substituted butter with coconut butter. Use the same measurement as with butter. It brings out more of the different flavors out, plus being healthier .

I have made this recipe twice now. Really a good recipe! I am having a problem with the rolled layers separating inside the loaf. Am I not rolling it tightly enough? I will have to try putting the raisins in the dough next time, hoping it will keep the roll tighter. If anyone has a suggestion, please let me know. I am on facebook under the name Anne LeMaitre. Thanks.

My sister and I have been making this recipe every Easter, for the past 3 years now and it has become a family tradition:) We also use our Grandmother's baking pans which makes it all the sweeter.  

We have only made one change, 45 minutes is much too long, we cut back to 30 minutes top! The recipe is GREAT!

I almost didn't make this when I saw it required a rolling pin. Glad I made it anyway. It rolled out like a dream. If anyone is wondering about making it with almond milk I did and it turned out just fine. It only took 30 minutes or so to cook but my bread pans are smaller than average.

The only change I made was melting the butter before adding to the mix. This bread was ok, but very cake-like and less flavourful than I'd hoped. If I made it again I'd add cinnamon to the dough rather than just in the swirl, but to be honest I think I'll try to find another recipe that's a bit more like bread and less like cake.

Wow! A recipe that can be made exactly as directed. This came out fantastic. I made two giant loaves of bread. I let it cool a little and then had a piece with butter while it was still warm. Oh so delicious. Thank you. No changes to this recipe and I will be making it again.

My husband said this was the best thing I've ever made.  It was so incredibly delicious.  Two changes made: instead of dissolving the yeast in water, I added extra milk and dissolved it in the warm milk. Then, I didn't have time to bake it after putting it in the loaf pan, so I refrigerated it for about 3 hours instead of leaving it out to rise for 1 hour to rise as the directions state. It rose beautifully and looks and tastes amazing!

1. i added a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice to the sugar/cinnamon mix.

2. After the individual loaves rose in their pans, prior to baking, i beat a single additional egg and brushed it on the tops of the loaves, and sprinkled a little more sugar/cinnamon mix on them.  This gave them a sweat, crisp brown top.  When i brushed the butter on after baking and let them cool, it was wonderful!

Other than that, i followed the recipe as laid out, and am very happy with the bread!

I will never buy raisin bread again!  This recipe is easy and delicious.  Love that I get 3 loaves out it and it freezes really well.  Also makes the most amazing French toast! I did add more raisins and heaping tablespoons of cinnamon.  Perfect!

Easy to make and very delicious!  It was actually fun making it with how sticky and messy the dough is.  If your's isn't sticky and messy, it will probably come out dry.  The only change I made was using 1 1/2 cups of raisins, instead of just the 1.

Great recipe to get started with my (inevitable) tweaks. I plumped 1.5 cups of raisins in hot water with a stick of cinnamon for about an hour, then drained and dried them before adding to the dough. Used about a teaspoon of sugar in the warm water when proofing the yeast.  Added cinnamon to the dough. I used 3 cups wheat flour, 2 cups bread flour, and 3 cups all purpose flour for a light wheat. Doubled the filling and used half brown sugar.  I have smaller loaf pans, so this made 4 lovely loaves for me.

I LOVE this recipe!!! It is really easy to make,  and ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!! I have made this recipe dozens of time. It's perfect as written, but I have also done a couple of tweaks a few times. My tweaks include adding one to one and one half teaspoons of cinnamon and a teaspoon of vanilla into the dough as it is being mixed. When I punch down the dough and prepared to start forming loaves, I divide it into three equal portions before rolling it out to add the filling. For me this is easier to work the dough. The other small change that I have made to the recipe is to swap the white granulated sugar for powdered sugar, this helps to alleviate the large holes you sometimes get in any breads that have a filling.
  I noticed that one person who left a review commented that her bread baked in less time than the recipe called for. There can be several reasons for this problem; 1. her oven may run a little hot, 2. her pans could have been smaller than the author's bread pans, and 3. Weather and humidity in the air can affect baking times. As with any recipe, there is trial and error. I think that's half the fun of learning new recipes, the other half is eating and sharing with my family and friends!!

fantastic base recipe. Hubby and I  cant get enough. Toasted with creamy peanut butter is my favorite.Made the dough in the bread machine and cut the recipe down to make just one loaf as a previous reviewer suggested from Sept 12, 2008.  Only things I did different was bake for 35 mn, added abit of cinnamon to dough,  added more sugar cinnamon  before rolling. Perfect and delicious

This is a very yummy recipe and makes three nice sized loaves of bread.     After reading reviews, I set the timer for 20 minutes and it's a good think I did that. I used two light colored loaf pans and a dark pan.  The light pans were not done in the middle.  The outside was beautiful, but very soggy in the middle.  I  covered the tops with foil and put them back into the oven at 375 for another 15 minutes.  The bread in the dark loaf pan was done to perfection.

The flavor is wonderful and it toasts nicely as well.  I will make this recipe again.

This is great!  I used coconut and wheat flours because they were all I had (about six cups).  Mine didn't rise, but I'm sure it was my fault.  Still good.  Thanks!

Comes out great! This is my 3rd time making it! I have since adapted somewhat the past two times...a little cinnamon and vanilla mixed in with the eggs and milk, a little brown sugar mixed into the cinnamon and sugar layer. Iwhat..it has been delicious each and every time. Last time I ate an entire loaf in 1 day told the hubby it was our 5 year old son. Lol ssshhhhh...after that I gave a loaf away to his friend. Had to get it out the house! But...here I am again, 2 weeks later, with three more delectable loaves waiting to go into the oven.

Changes: I halved the servings, which ends up calling for 1.5 eggs.  I used 2.  Bread flour instead of AP. 1/2 tsp cinn in dough. Brown sugar instead of white in filling.

I made one long loaf and baked it on my bread stone, but it easily could have been two. Baked for 45 min, 20 min of that tented w/ foil to prevent burning.

Very good. My dream bread would be denser (eggier?) or perhaps with some pastry flour.

But this bread did rise up rally well, was easy to mix and knead and work with.  Very good finished consistency, will hold up well for making French toast.

I baked a batch of this bread for the restaurant - it lasted about an hour & a half - everybody loved it.  I was easy to make, although I was a little daunted about rolling the dough!  Goodness know why?  Anyway, I am baking a double batch tomorrow, it will be interesting to see if my first attempt was experienced baker's luck!

My bread did not rise enough. :( although I followd the recipe quite well. I just didnt have a thermometer so I just boiled the water let it cool for a minute and mixd it with the active yeast and let it sit for 10 min. n mixd it occasionally.

I really like the ends of my bread. But the middle was just not cooked. I know what I did wrong! I took it out of the oven way to early. This was my very first time making bread, and inthought it was going to burn as it was turning brown. But the ends tasted lovely.

The planets must have lined up! This turned out so well. Soft and tasty. i do melt the butter in the milk on the stove but no need to boil milk just heat enough to melt butter. let it cool to 110 degrees.  It just makes it a bit easier when pouring all the ingredients in the bowl to mix. 2 tsp vanilla. I add 2 tbs "vital wheat gluten" to this recipe and all my breads for that matter. it helps dough rise. I used half bread and half all purpose flours. I begin in the mixer adding only 4 cups of flour on med high with paddle attachment for about 2 minutes. Gets the gluten going. Change to hook and add as much flour as the mixer can handle then kneed in the rest by hand. Then knead the raisins in last.  Damp towel over buttered bowl in oven with light on.

Mm, some good cinnamon bread. I followed this recipe pretty much to the T. (Used bread flour instead of all-purpose flour, and used lard instead of butter or margarine, otherwise it was unchanged)

A few problems I did have with this recipe though. One is that I didn't need nearly as much of the cinnamon-sugar mix that it called for. I only used about half. Another is that the cooking time, as many other reviewers have stated, is far too long. It was cooked in about 30 minutes, with the oven set to 325 degrees. 

But these problems are so minor, and the bread was so delicious, I'm rating it five stars anyways. :)

This was my first attempt at cinnamon raisin bread and OMG it turned out delicious! I followed the recipe exact, other than adding extra raisins ;) I wasn't sure what size or shape of a large rectangle to make and after my first attempt I now have a better idea. Also, instead of spreading milk on the dough I put some melted butter, I don't know why, I guess I thought it'd give it extra buttery flavor but I think it helped the dough suck in the cinnamon and sugar because I didn't have much swirling going on. Besides that, the bread was a HIT and was devoured. I was told it was the best cinnamon raisin bread they've ever had. Sweet deal!! I made it for brunch with the in-laws, so I only really needed 1 loaf. I froze 2 of the loaves before the final rise to save for later. Next time, I'll use the milk.

Made this recipe for the first time in 06. I've made it a few times since, but today I only had 1 pack of yeast. I halved the recipe (1 egg + 1 yolk), and it turned out great! I was able to make 2 smaller loaves.  The only part of the recipe that I didn't half was the cinnamon sugar. Next time I might even add more! Such a great, easy recipe!!!

Very good, I suggest rolling the dough out thinner than 1/2" to get a better swirl of the cinnamon and sugar mix.

I liked this recipe. It's easy to make and tastes delicious. I did add more raisins and a little more sugar than the recipe stated. I also baked it for 35 minutes instead of 45, and covered it with foil after the first 15 minutes. I will definitely make it again.

Debated between this recipe and one found on a blog. So happy I chose this. Took all 3 loaves camping and entire family loved them! I soaked the raisins in warm milk so make plump.

I only gave this a four, but not because it's not good bread, just because I had to tweek it to get the results I wanted. Ok, I cheated. First of all I didn't want 3 loaves, so I changed the "servings" from 36 as listed to 24, so I acutally made 2/3 of a recipie.  I followed the recipe exept that I used 3 teaspoons of Active DryYeast instead of the Breadmaker Yeast I use in my machine. I also added 1/8 teaspoon of cinnamon to the dough and increased the raisins to 1 cup. I put it in my bread maker (Panasonic SD-RD250)  on "basic dough" and it rose so much that it hit the lid of the machine. I poured it out onto a bakeing mat, rolled it out and added the sugar/cinnamon  mix and rolled it up. This amount of dough made three nice loaves in 5x9 pans, so if you make the full recipie you could easaly get four loaves or more from it. I baked fo 30 minutes as recomended by others and I now have three nice light perfectly done loaves of bread. I noticed that some of the photos showed bread that was flat and heavy. I think that might be due to trying to make too few loaves and not letting it rise enough.

I did 1/3 of the recipe, used an egg substitute because I was out, and brown sugar for the swirl instead of white. No raisins, cooked for 30 minutes and it was a bit more done than I would have liked. Put it in the fridge overnight after the initial rise. Delicious!

THE BEST CINNAMON RAISIN BREAD EVER! I did make a few changes for personal taste mainly. I adjusted the recipe for 2 loaves and used 1/2 cup of white raisins and 1/2 cup of dried cranberries soaked in orange rum for about an hour and drained. Also used brown sugar in place of all white sugar in the recipe. I added 2 tsp. of cinnamon to the dough and 2 tsp. of vanilla. Before second rise, I brushed melted butter and honey on top and sprinkled with rolled oats. Incredibly moist, full of flavor, and sinfully delicious!!

I made a half batch in my bread machine tonight and it was fantastic! Super easy that way (I was short on time) but I would be willing to try it the traditional way another time.

CAUTION: This bread is highly addictive!
There ought to be a 12 ste[ program for it, it's that good.
When visiting , my mother-in-law won't let me in her house unless I have a loaf of this with me.

Seriously, it's delicious, easy to make, and makes enough to share and still have some for yourself.

Tasty but I had issues. This was the most difficult dough to work with that I've tried in a long time. I make good bit of bread, but I usually do straight, high hydration doughs with only minimal kneading and smaller quantities. I didn't know how the dough should feel for this one. Expected slightly stiff but mine was crazy sticky (added flour but didn't want to add too much). Never did pass windowpane and the dough became stickier and floppier as I tried to knead it. I didn't bother rolling and filling. Problems could have been the weather or milk or a new flour brand... I'm going to try it again and see if things improve. Gave a generous four stars because it still tasted good and problems might be with me. Next time I'll try treating it minimally like my others.

This turned out really good. I'm not much of a bread baker but I tried this one. I did make 1 substitution. I used 4 cups Whole Wheat Flour with 4 cups All Purpose flour.

delicious!!  I made it the first time following the recipe exactly and it was very very good!  The second time I added more raisins (didn't measure just threw them in) and used melted butter instead of milk before sprinkling on extra cinnamon and sugar.  Even better the second time around!

Good instructions!  My only problem is that it came out rather crumbly but very tasty.  I did not get air pockets like some of the other pictures show.

Loved it!!! My 4 & 6 yr old girls couldn't get enough of it! I omitted the white sugar for brown sugar. This bread is so good toasted w/butter or cream cheese and a cup of coffee! I froze some of the bread and plan to make French toast over the weekend with it!!

This came out great! (and I am not good at making bread..;) I used an 8 x 4 loaf pan and the loaf came out perfect, nice and moist, using the recommended 30 minutes of cooking time.

This is a wonderful recipe. I suggest you double the raisins. I thought the recipe needed more raisins. Other than that the effort and time put into baking it is worth it. MY husband and friend enjoyed it much.

People beg me to make this more often, and since it makes so much I don't mind sharing. This makes a lot of dough, great if you like to gift food out or freeze it for saving later.

I do make a few minor changes when I'm baking  this. I use brioche yeast for one. I also use a mix of golden and regular raisins that I re-hydrate in the hot milk the recipe calls for. I also use more raisins and save about a half cup for the middle. Instead of regular sugar I use dark brown sugar for the middle roll and less cinnamon (the husband is not a cinnamon fan but he likes the bread like this). I actually have to cook the bread longer and at a (very) slightly higher temp. since I have a countertop oven. I use only the bottom heating element and use a drip pan under the bread to help distribute the heat. Though a baking stone would be much better.

Overall it makes a tasty, soft, and sweet bread that  is great on it's own or used as a decadent replacement for regular bread in French toast or bread pudding.

This recipe was really good! Easy to make and was really tasty. One of the previous reviewers mentions adding cinnamon to the dough itself which I missed seeing until my dough was already on the rise. I think it could use the extra cinnamon. I imagine that this would make fantastic french toast the following morning.

Perfect! I cut the recipe in half and make one loaf in a 9x5 pan, and it's the perfect size. I cut it down to 1 egg. I cooked mine for 35 mins, then left the oven open and the bread in to cool. SO good!!

I've made breads before and always come up flat...I just figured I couldnt cook.  I tried this recepie and finally knocked one out of the park.  It was so tasty and fresh that my boyfriend said it looked like something I bought from the store.  Now I know it was the recepie and NOT me...Awesome bread and I'll be making it again!!!

Absolutely an incredible bread.  I put everything into my breadmaker and let it do the work through the dough cycle.  I cut the recipe in half so it would fit in my machine.  Once it came out of the machine, I formed it into the loaf in the pan, let it rise and baked it.  WONDERFUL!!!   Am already planning on my next loaf!  I did add 2T of cinnamon to the dough.  Update 10/9/11.  Have made this numerous times and experimented with the filling.  We have found we like the filling doubled.  Tried to triple it, and it was too sweet and gooey.

just came out of the oven, and i couldn't wait for it to cool.  delicious!

*update*  i just made this again, but this time i wanted a chewier bread so i used half whole wheat flour and i added an extra 1/3 cup of milk, and then i let it rise overnight in the fridge.  the whole wheat takes a bit longer to rise-- i think an extra 10 minutes or so for the second rise after i rolled it out.  also i used 1 cup of raisins and one granny smith apple-- i think this version is even better than the original!

Recipe needs at least 3 t. of salt and margarine being a transfat should be replaced with canola oil.  Otherwise great.

This was my first time baking bread and boy did I choose a great recipe!  This is so good.  I halved the recipe and it yielded two loaves.  The next time I'll add more raisins because I like having a lot in my raisin bread.  I did cut back on the baking time to 30 minutes based on the reviews, and it was baked perfectly.

We love this recipe!  I let the loaves cool, slice them thin with electric knife and store in the freezer.  When we want a couple of slices I just stick them in the toaster, then spread a smiddgen of butter on them.  Great with a cup of cappachino!

Very Yummy!!!  I did not use raisins because I didn't have any.  Mine only baked for about 30 minutes.  Next time I may take it out about 5 minutes earlier since the bread was a little bit dry.  My 16 month and 4 year love it.  They eat it with Breakfast and as a bed time snack.  It made 3 wonderful loaves.  I will definetly be making this once or twice a month.

Excellent! I cut the recipe into 1/3 for one loaf and made the dough in my bread machine. I put raisins in 1/2 for my husband and no raisins in the other half for my picky son. I just put the raisins on top of the cinnamon and sugar and rolled up the dough tightly. Between the three of us we just about devoured the whole loaf in one night. Can't wait to make it again. It was incredibly easy using the dough cylcle in the bread machine.

This bread was so good! I followed the recipe to a "T" and it was perfect.  I made 2 loaves of the bread and used the rest for cinnamon rolls. The 2 loaves of bread were gone before the end of the day, the family loved it.  Definately a keeper!!!!!

Dried out quickly.  Not quite the texture of a great cinnamon bread and needs more raisins.  But Super when toasted.

LOVE this recipe! I made it twice and both times I read the recipe wrong! I melted the butter and mixed it with the cinnamon and sugar. The first time it melted out of the ends a bit. The second time I divided the dough in thirds, THEN filled it and rolled it. I used regular flour the first time and bread flour the second. I think I like the texture of the bread flour over the regular but it is delicious either way.

I really liked this recipe, it was my first taking baking bread and everyone really liked it.  I did add regular cooking oats and small chopped apples to the swirl mix which I think helped it to be a bit moister.  Overall great, and you must try it with cream cheese.

I really liked this recipe. I followed it to the T, except I used skim milk and egg substitutes in lieu of milk and eggs. I did add 1/3 cup brown sugar to the sugar/cinnamon mixture for the swirl - and it came out so good and gooey. Paired with a little cream cheese frosting, this is a great dessert as well. Thank you for sharing!

Very good recipe.  Used half whole wheat flour/all purpose flour.  Agree with other reviewers - needs more raisins.  A little on the bland side.  I might try putting orange zest next time.  Thanks for posting the recipe.

Delicious! I have never made yeast bread before but was dying to try. I only wanted to make one loaf so I converted this recipe to 12 servings and used the measurements exactly. It turned out great! I haven't had a chance to toast it yet because we keep eating it just the way it is. Thanks!

Great and easy recipe.  First time making bread and it was fairly easy. I used bread dough instead of all purpose flour.  The bread came out very light and fluffy.   Next time i would probably add in a little more raisins but overall even my VERY picky daughter liked it.

Easy enough to make, and with a good taste and texture. I would have added a bit more cinnamon, and to get the dough to the correct texture I had to add a bit more flour, but all in all a good recipe and one I will make again, for sure!

I took some reviewers' advice and increased both the cinnamon and the raisins.  I think next time I will increase both even more.  Overall, though, a great treat for breakfast.

Yum this is really good!  I took the advice of some others and added a bit more sugar to the dough (which I made in my bread machine) and cinnamon.  Will be making this for the inlaw's visit next week!

This is excellent bread! I love cinnamon and raisins, so I just add more of those two ingreadients, and this bread disappears! The smell of it baking draws people right into the kitchen!

This is incredible!! I admit, it's my first homemade bread that I didn't use the breadmaker.

I followed the recipe almost exact but used half whole wheat flour and doubled the raisins.  

Oh, and I was out of cinnamon so had to use pumpkin pie spice... not as sweet as the cinnamon but still very good.

I made this bread for the first time today and it is FABULOUS! I experiment a lot with bread making and try all kinds of recipes and this is by far my favorite yet. I would use more raisins next time too.

this was very good.
it didn't need to cook the full 45minutes, i checked on it and it was done in about 25-30.
i will also add more raisins next time and some cinnamon to the dough.
very delicious.

I loved this recipe. Being from a family who not really likes raisine bread except me i tried it. My uncles and I just love raisin bread so I made it for my 4-H project. I did everything to the T and it came out wonderful. I ended up being overall yeast bread champion. The judge couldn't tell what else to do to make it better it was so perfect!!! Love this recipe!!

WOW!  YUMMY!!  I usually don't like store raisin bread, the top always tastes to burnt for me, but this came out perfect!  I used the suggestions of another person on cutting it in half, but keeping somethings the same, and it is absolutely wonderful.  My first time making bread, and i am thrilled!

This recipe is outstanding. I once made many breads by hand for an organization, and this was far and away everyone's favorite. I do like to add more cinnamon and sugar than the recipe calls for, including some cinnamon in the dough itself.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  It is the best cinnamon rasin bread I have ever tried.  I make the full batch and freeze the extra loaves so I can have some anytime I have a craving for a sweet.  It also makes WONDERFUL french toast!

Great recipe!  This was my first time making a 'swirl' type bread, and it turned out beautifully.  I reduced the recipe to 2 loaves, and used both white and wheat bread flour.  Also, I used golden raisins, I think they are yummier than the dark ones.  I've been counting WW points and have been baking to keep busy, so I've been sharing a lot.  I've given this bread to my neighbor, and my parents, and also have 2 loaves in the freezer.  Everyone just loves it.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

This bread came out really well. After adding all the flour to the mixture, mine was still a little crumbly, so I added a touch of water and it came together nicely. Also I only had instant yeast so I just mixed it in with the flour. I would definately make this again!

I think this bread is delicious.  I made it just as the recipe asked for, and it turned out 3 great loaves.  I am not a seasoned chef either, so its easy enough for the ones just starting out on the journey.

My 13 year old grand daughter wanted to learn to bake bread.  We chose this recipe.  It came out perfect.  It did rise faster than we anticipated and cooked in 25 minutes.  That was o.k. We could taste it sooner.  She beamed at all the rave reviews.

We love this recipe! I do find I need to add a little more flour to make the dough manageable in the first stage of the recipe (before first rise) but that's only my preference. You won't be disappointed with this recipe!

I am sure it is excellent exactly as it is, but i increased amount of raisins by 1/2 and used 1/2 dark raisins and 1/2 golden raisins. Just for looks.

Maybe I did something wrong, but it took the middle of the bread over an hour to get done and keeping them in the oven so long made the tops of  the loaves very brown and hard. The bread itself was very dense when I tried to cut it. I made two loaves and made cinnamon rolls out of the extra. The cinnmaon rolls came out fine. The swirl pattern in the bread is really pretty once I hacked my way through the crust. And the house smelt wonderful while it was baking.

D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S! I had to add more flour and I added 2.5 cups of raisins. When I rolled out the loaves to add the sugar and cinnamon mixture, I ended up with left-overs. I was afraid that it wouldn't be sweet enough. It turned out perfectly! It was just the right amount of sweetness. I'm glad that I didn't use all the sugar mixture! I will make this recipe again.

Wonderful recipe!  I had to hide a loaf to make sure my family didn't eat it all.  My loaves weren't quite the same size, I didn't roll it out evenly, oops on me, but it came out perfect anyways.  Highly recommended.
