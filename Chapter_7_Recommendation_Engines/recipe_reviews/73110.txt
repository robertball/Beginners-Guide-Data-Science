My wife loves this sandwich, but I use a cheese slicer to make thin slices of apple to place between the slices of  the peanut-buttered bread.

An even healthier idea, leave out the bread.  Use sliced apples to dip into a little container of PB or cut apple in half, core, then fill each side with PB & put back together before bagging for lunch.  Just pull apart before eating.  Also, celery sticks filled with PB or cream cheese with raisins on top are a healthy delicious snack.

Simple and delicious - great for a quick snack! I love peanut butter and apples. It not only tastes good, but it's good for you! I toasted my whole grain bread so the peanut butter go a little "melty" and instead of shredding the apple I just sliced it extra thin. I added just a bit of cinnamon to the apple and it was yummy. I can't wait to try this with crunchy peanut butter!

Wanted to make another suggestion...try this combination on a tortilla and eat as a wrap.  You could also try, for a change, using shredded celery or carrot in place of the apple.

I call this the "apple pie" sandwich! I don't shred the apple but just cut really thin slices and stack as many as i can on the bread. I PB both sides so it will stick together and I add a little cinnamon!! YUMMMMMMM!!!!!

this was one of my favs as a child, bananas work well to, and to make this meal or snack into an activity the kids can make there own, spread peanutbutter on one piece of bread and have cut apples, bananas, and even cereal ready for them to put on top, you can toast the bread to make it easier for them to work with

i was delighfully surprised at how good this sandwich was!  I used natural peanut butter and granny smith apples (the only apples I had on hand).  The refreshing crunch and taste of the apple added a nice flavor.  Will definately make again when we need a quick lunch!

We love this sandwich and have made them for years with Granny Smith apples and crunchy peanut butter! Absolutely a nice alternative to the regular PB&J.  We also sometimes substitute banana's for the apple! That is fantastic, too!

Try this recipe with light, high fiber, whole wheat bread, then you can afford yourself or your child a little extra peanut butter without making this a high-calorie meal.  You can cut back the calories (especially from simple carbohydrates) and up the fiber and protein content for a really healthy treat!

If you put a thin (or thick if you prefer!) layer of peanut butter on BOTH slices of bread and use thin slices of apple, it will not get soggy.  Love this sandwich and have been eating it for forever!

Holy cow, was this a tasty treat!  I took the advice of one of the other reviewers and used toasted Cinnamon Raisin bread.  I shredded the apple and tossed it with a little bit of honey, cinnamon and cloves for a hint of added flavor.  Oh my, was this good for my late night munchies.  Will try this on a toasted Cinnamon/Raisin bagel tomorrow morning.

I used to just slice a thin layer and place in the sandwich. Slicing is a really neat idea! For lunches I mixed the shredded apple in a little lemon juice to keep the apple from turning brown.

I have enjoyed PB sandwiches with apple slices for years.  They are best, though, made on Cinnamon-Raisin bread, such as the Pepperidge Farm brand or Arnold's.  YUM!!!!

A smash hit with my 2 year old! We love this with organic peanut butter spread on one cinnamon whole wheat Eggo waffle topped with thinly sliced apple.  Then, serve it folded in half or cut into fours.

Try adding a few slices of bacon to the recipe.  Trust me - it's fabulous!  Perfect combination of savory and sweet.  Has been my favorite sandwich since I was a child.

My boyfriend loves this.  If I make his lunch the night before, I usually put a little lemon juice on the apple, and often try little variations, such as adding cinnamon & cranberries or walnuts, or a little fluff and banana, etc.

These are awesome!
My mom used to make Apple Smiles when I was little.  It was my favorite after school snack.  
Sliced red apples, peanut butter on one side, with mini mashmellows in the middle of two peanut buttery slices.  It looks like a big, happy, red smile with little teeth and used to make my day in elementary school.

I originally made this for my boys to see if I could find a way to get them to eat peanut butter. I got one to but the other still wasn't interested. I, however, loved it. I'll be making it again for myself. lol

I've tried this toasted and I love it. I've also made one with equal parts PB and Cream Cheese, and half that amount of honey (or some drizzled over the apples instead of mixed into the spread). A favourite breakfast of mine during my student days.

This is delicious. If you have the time, it's even tastier if you slice the apple thin and saute with a bit of butter, cinnamon, and about a teaspoon of sugar, until the apple is tender. Makes for a gooey and delicious sandwich!

This has always been a staple in our house. I do have another suggestion to try as well. I spread PB on one slice of bread and spread honey on the other...add bananas or apples, either tastes great! It's a super yummy lunch. My husband even loves this tasty kid meal. I've also used sun butter (made from sun flower seeds), which definitely doesn't have the same taste of peanut butter, but will do when PB is restricted at school because of allergies.

I've been making this sandwich for years... some variations on it that I would recommend would be to toast up some rye or a bagel and spread the peanut butter on it while it is still hot.  I use natural crunchy peanut butter.  I also peel the apples and slice the apples like one would for an apple pie, which makes it easier to stack the apples on top of the toast.

This recipe is fantastic.  My mother has Type II Diabetes and she can eat this sandwich without the sugar in jelly. The protein in the peanut butter is good for diabetics.  She loves this sandwich.  Thank you for the wonderful idea.

My 3 year old really enjoyed these! I didn't shred the apple, instead I cut them into very thin slices because they where a little bigger and wouldn't fall off his sandwich as easily. I also used crunchy peanut butter to give it even more texture! I will be making these again. They are a great snack!

It became to mushy to quickly if I were to do it again I'd refrigerate the apples before cutting them.

I used my mandolin V-slicer to get really thin slices of apple and I used my homemade cashew nut butter. Probably not sweet enough for me but my toddler loved it so that's a triumph.

These were very good. They inspired me to try some other variations.  I shredded the apples (helps to press or squeeze the apples a bit to remove some of the moisture), and stir them into the peanut butter.  From there, you can take this recipe to a lot of places depending on the preferences of your family. You can stir in one or a combination of the following: raisins or sweetened dried cranberries, mini chocolate chips, nuts, honey, chocolate or hazelnut spread, or even crumbled bacon.  These are terrific stuffed into mini pita breads to make tiny sandwiches that won't fall apart.

I have have eaten this in the past, and I will again soon, apples and bananas are at their peak in Australia at the moment.
One thing I would look at seriously is NOT peeling the apple, just wash and slice it, most of the goodnes and fibre is in the skin.

Perfect lunch for a mom that's trying to eat balanced meals and drop a few pounds. I used natural chunky peanut butter, a small Granny Smith and whole grain bread. With a glass of FF milk, I was plenty satisfied.

This was a good alternative to Pb & banana.  Next time I think I will thinly slice the apple instead of shredding it and add some raisons. THX

Finally, a sandwich that I can eat. I love apples, but unfortunately because of a denture problem, cannot eat them. I also love peanut butter. This is a perfect solution. No...applesauce does not fulfill the taste of a fresh apple.

My kids eat PB&J on an almost daily basis.  We always use the Simply Fruit spread so we don't get the added sugars...this is even better--the real deal!  Adds a nice crunch, too.  I think I liked it as much as the kids did!

Love this recipe. Actually when I was really little, I ate apples with peanut butter sandwiches. Then I realized I could slice and put them in the sandwich, so it was awesome. Super crunchy apple peanut butter sandwich! =)

This taste great and only took about 5 minutes. I made 2 sandwiches because the apple was pretty big. I also chopped up the apples very finely.

Other suggestions: bananas with peanut butter or apples with cheese (I'd recommend cheddar for kids, but brie is good, too).
