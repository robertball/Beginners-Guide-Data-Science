I used wheat rotini pasta because its what I had on hand. It was great. Also added fresh mushrooms to onion and garlic mix. I seasoned my chicken with Mrs Dash and I'm glad I did because it would have been bland. I substituted the marinara sauce for just diced tomatoes as I wanted a lighter dish.  It was awesome. I will definitely make this dish again!

This is even easier if you make it all in one skillet, less to wash. I added in some black olives also.

This was very easy and very tasty. Make sure you use a good marinara sauce with this as that is the main flavor.

4 and a half stars.   I feel that salt and pepper are an option in every recipe and as one reviewer wrote, most of the flavor is from the sauce, so make sure you have a good one before you move on.   I liked the way it came out except it was on the watery side from the spinach.   I will most likely make this again, but I will remove the foil half way through the bake time.

I made this almost exactly as written & it was very good.  My whole family, cleaned their plate.  I didn't use quite as much onion or garlic as the recipe called for.  I served with veggie pasta & no one even noticed.  Very good, will put in the rotation!  Thanks for the recipe.

This is a great start! I also added sun dried tomatoes (in oil sliced), kalamata olives sliced and Italian seasoning (basil, oregano, some crushed red pepper) Instead of baking it, I put the spinach and tomato sauce on top and covered while leaving it on the stove top. My tomato sauce had artichoke hearts in it but if it had not, I would add a small can drained then chopped. I would have added some Feta or Parmesan at the end too but I'm trying to cut back on cheese :(  This was a winner and I will be making this again. Next time I may add orzo in substitute of the noodles.

This is relatively fast and easy. I read the reviews, and agreed that seasoning is needed on the chicken.  I pounded 3 breasts (pounding is a must - makes chicken tender!) and sprinkled boths sides with a bit of salt, pepper, oregano, and a bit of crush garlic.  I let that sit for 30-45 min in the fridge.  "Florentine" often means spinach and bacon, so I chopped up 6 regular slices of bacon, crisped them up, then put those on top of cheese in the last 5 min of baking.   Served with whole wheat spaghetti; it was a very nice, hearty dinner.

Good weeknight meal. I added salt, pepper, basil, and oregano. Leftovers were even better reheated the next day.

I removed one star because the absence of salt and spices led to a bit bland chicken. I recommend adding salt and spices to the onion-garlic mix before adding the chicken.

"Blah." In one word. I started cooking two years ago because if you can read you can cook. I select a recipe and then use your comments because you've been doing this a lot longer than me. I added mushrooms, onions, kalamatra olives and Mrs. Dash seasoning on the chicken.  The resuts....Boring. I need some advice. What's a terrific chicken recipe? Thanks to each one of you. You are the best. Jack from St. Louis

Absolutely scrumptious!  The chicken was flavorful and moist and the spinach was perfectly tasty. This is a great recipe for an elegant dish that is easy to make for a weeknight meal.  The whole family loved it!

This was a wonderfully easy and quick meal to make which tasted fabulous, particularly given how little effort was required!  I added a few extra spices to the chicken mixture (i.e. salt, pepper and Italian seasoning) and would probably add even more next time as I prefer a lot of spice, but it was excellent as it was. I will definitely be making this on a regular basis now that I've discovered it!

This was a good dish. Had it with some warm crusty bread and went back for seconds! Going to try it again soon but with Italian sausages instead of chicken.

This turned out great and my wife loved it!  I added mushrooms with the onions and used edemame noodles instead of the fetuccine to give it a healthier edge.  It is on our list to have again!

Loved this!  Very easy and healthy.  Hubby even ate the spinach.  He dislikes cooked spinach but there was enough garlic in the dish to mask the flavor of the spinach.  Would definitely make again!

It was good but the chicken does need more flavor. I made no changes and the chicken came out tasting bland. After I served it I tried adding Italian seasoning but all it flavored was the sauce. It's still a good chicken dish.

Thank you! This has become a go-to quick and easy, healthy meal for our family! I don't even add the noodles half the time.  I do usually add mushrooms and as another reviewer stated, splurge on a nice marinara.

I followed recipe exact, except i seasoned my chicken with garlic salt and garlic powder first before cooking, otherwise this dish is a bit bland for my taste.

I liked this recipe but I do agree the chicken needed seasoning. I'm glad that I checked the oven at 20 minutes because the sauce was runny so I took the foil off for the last ten minutes and it was fine. I'll be making this again but I'll add some spices for extra flavor.
