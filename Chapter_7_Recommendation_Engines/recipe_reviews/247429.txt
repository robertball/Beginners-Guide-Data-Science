I made 2 changes. I fried my tofu separately and added it to the final dish because we like ours crunchy and my other change was bellas instead of shiitake because I had some on hand that needed used and because they are more affordable. This was good. The instructions are a little hard to follow but other than that I have no complaints.

I love this recipe for Beef Sukiyaki! It's kind of hard to find the thinly sliced beef near where I live, so I use the meat that's pre-sliced that they use for Philly Cheesesteak at Walmart. 
Instead of raw egg, I pick out the ingredients that I want from the pot into an individual bowl of rice, and me and my family share it as a hotpot. 
You can throw in some pre-made potstickers if you can't find the noodles.
