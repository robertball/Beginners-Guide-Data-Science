I used my last two tablespoons of Dijon mustard and after tasting thought it needed more mustard so I added a tablespoon of whole grain mustard. It was either that or honey mustard and the sweetness was already there from the ketchup and mayo so I went with the whole grain. This recipe was great! I do however think it needs more mustard than the recipe calls for. Can't wait to make it again once I buy more Dijon. This would be a great sauce to dip fries in too!
