Good, not-too-sweet cookie.  But if you make the dough balls 1" and use a teaspoon full of jelly, you end up with cookies with holes in them edged with jelly.  Make the dough balls 1 1/2" in diameter, and just a dab of jelly, and you're all set!  Makes about 21 cookies.

I made these for the first time during the holidays with raspberry jam... everyone loved them!!!  A word of advice... keep the dough in the fridge between batches otherwise it will be too soft to work with.

My mom used to make these for christmas, so I decided to make them this year, and with the low cookie yield, quadrupled the recipie, without taking into consideration that they take more work than a rolled or drop cookie, as there's both rolling [dough] and dropping [jam] involved.  And use just a touch of jam, or it drips out the side.

Well balanced recipe. If you're in a hurry, this does well in a microwave also. Cook on full power for 2-3 mins on an ungreased microwave-safe plate

I have to agree with the previous rating ~ I carefully went through each step and found the cookies to spread out much too wide on the cookie sheet.  They didn't look like the jam thumbprints I am used to, but tasted okay.

These cookies were not quite what I was expecting.  They spread on the pan to become much larger than any other thumbprint cookies I've tried.  They did taste good, but did not have the presentation I was hoping for.
