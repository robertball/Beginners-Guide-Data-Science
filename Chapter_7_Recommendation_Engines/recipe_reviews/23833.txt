I modified this recipe like many other users did. I made mine with 16 oz. of velveeta, and 10 oz. for regular orange cheddar. I did use the evaporated milk, and i did increase the salt just a little. I cooked my noodles a little bit. I didn't cook them all the way to al dente, but i was leary about putting them in uncooked. I boiled them probably for about 3 minutes. The mac n cheese came out awesome. Made it on a Sunday morning to eat with football in the afternoon. Was very rich, but we like it that way. If you don't, subs reg milk for evap milk. It's easy. Watch and stir though, it can burn on the bottom. I cooked the cheese, milk, egg and seasoning for about 30 min before adding my hot pasta. Then i cooked on High about 1.5 hours. Then i turned it to low. It was done and ready to eat, I just kept it warm. Next time I will add some pepper. That's it!

This turned out pretty good, but I added alot more to it. For one I did not cook the macaroni before I put it in the crock pot so the noodles did not get soggy. I also added some mozzerella cheese, parasean, and cream cheese. Put some worstchire sauce in it too with some diced onions and some dry mustard.The kids love it.

I made this recipe for a mid-day office pitch-in.  I started it in the morning and thought it would be fine until lunch time.  It had started to dry out by the time it was ready to be served.  I would not recommend cooking for longer than 3 hours.  I also did not cook my noodles and they were perfect.  At the suggestion of another reviewer I used Velveeta instead of Cheddar.  Overall a really good recipe.  Just be careful of cooking time.

This is a very easy recipe, a snap, but very, very rich.  My kids and my husband found it too rich.  I plan to make it again, but modify it by cutting back a bit on the cheese and decreasing the evaporated milk, substituting with regular milk.  Also, unlike other crock pot dishes, this cannot be left too long over 3 hours or it does begin to dry out.

If my husband could only have one meal before he died, this would be the choice for him. If I've got this in the slow cooker when he comes home his eyes light up and I get an extra big hug, LOL! I make with no changes. Love, love, love it!

I liked how easy this was to prepare, but it was way too salty and almost too rich.  I would recommend the following adjustments:

* 1 c. condensed milk mixed with 1 c. regular milk
* 1/4 to 1/2tsp. salt (if using Velveeta cheese)
* 2 1/2 c. cheese (if using Velveeta)
* reduce cook time to 1 hour after pasta is added

The cheese was clumpy so my 6 year old wouldn't eat it but others thought it was wonderful and couldn't get enough.  Tasted great although I did use sharp and extra sharp cheddar cheese. Probably only cooked for 2 hours after adding macaroni.  Then as it remained in the crock pot until everyone finished eating the sides and bottom did get darker, not burnt, just a little brown and chewy. That I think is the best part, tasted wonderful, like the top of the macaroni and cheese you would cook in the oven. Thanks for the recipe, it reminds me so much of a local restaurant's mac and cheese, that closed several years ago. Will definitely be making this again.

This recipe was great but definitely needed a few modifications on timing! Also, make sure you have time to stir it every 45 min-1 hour (or more frequently) so it doesn't burn! Here is how I made it and it turned out well... probably a little rich so next time I will use only regular milk and no evaporated milk but that's a personal preference. Anyway, I used: 12 oz evaporated milk (can) with 1/4 cup skim milk since the can didn't come in a 16 oz size, 2 tsp salt (could've used a dash of pepper), 1 egg beaten, 2 tbsp butter, 1 block velveeta cheezse (32 oz), and just over 1/2 pound of elbow macaroni (~10 oz). I cooked the liquid ingredients for 1 hour stirring part of the way through. I then added uncooked macaroni at 1 hour and then only needed 2 hours to cook it...any longer and it would've burned/dried out. I would've probably been fine with 1.5 hours to keep it a little creamier but that's ok. I wasn't sure if the noodles would be softened by then. If you want a creamier variation, I would boil the noodles for 3-4 minutes and then only cook it for 1-1.5 hours after adding the noodles to the sauce. It turned out well! But like I said, it was a little rich so next time I will use only skim milk and no evaporated milk. Enjoy!

"YUM" I made this for a carry-in and my co-workers loved it. They have asked me to bring it back numerous times.  Some have asked for the recipe for their own get togethers.

Very easy, I have made this 3 times and my kids do not like it for some reason.  I think it's ok, maybe a little bland.  I used way more cheese than needed because my family loves cheese but it was still missing something...

I really hate giving something a bad review, but I was just so disappointed. I read all the bad reviews but I kept myself hopeful that mine would turn out well like some reviews, but it turned out terrible. I was fine with it looking bad and having that weird texture like so many people talked about, but what did me in for giving it a bad review was that it had next to zero flavor to it. If it looked good and had no flavor, or looked bad and had tons of flavor, I would be willing to try it again w/ some editing, but I think I'll find a different recipe for mac and cheese.

I was very disappointed in the way this recipe turned out.  I was so excited to find a recipe for mac and cheese made in the crockpot (with 2 small children, i'm always looking for simple recipes), and most of the reviews were great, but the final product wasn't.  I only left it in the crockpot for 2 1/2 hrs after adding the noodles, and it was more then done.  But the cheese was clumpy, instead of smooth.  I could personally taste the one egg in the recipe, and it seems to me that it may be the reason that the cheese clumped up (like scrambled eggs on noodles). It smelt wonderful while it was cooking, but when my family sat down to eat it, the flavor wasn't anything special, pretty bland. I was beyond disappointed, I wanted so badly to like it because it was so easy to make and my whole family just loves home made macaroni and cheese, but I won't bother making this recipe again.

My favorite recipe. EVER.  Used skim milk and switched out half the cheese for Velveeta.  Never pre-cooked the noodles before adding them and cooked on high for about 3 hrs in the Crock.  Added salt, pepper and paprika.  Yuuuuuuum

I used shredded Jack and Colby cheese.  I followed directions except:I cooked cheese/milk mixture for 30 min.  I added uncooked pasta, sliced smokie links, and cooked for 2 hours.  Very tastey but would have to double recipe if want to make a large crowd.

This started as a good recipe, but the longer it cooked in the crock pot the soggier it got.  Not sure if I cooked the noodles too long.

I threw out the whole batch. It cooked faster then the recipe said and the cheese became coagulated and it tasted burnt. I even put the slow cooker on warm and it still burnt. I won't be making this again.

Figured I would give this a try even though it had mixed reviews. I followed the recipe exactly. Maybe it was my fault because I used sharp cheddar, but I just didn't care for the taste or texture.

I thought this was a very tasty, rich cheesy recipe.  The cheese overcooked so separated and the milk curdled so it wasn't so pretty to look at.  I think my slowcooker cooks faster than most because almost all recipes on this site overcook if I follow the directions.  I wouldn't cook this any longer than 2 hours on low total.  I added the noodles raw and shut off the slow cooker and they were cooked perfectly in about 1/2 hour without any heat!  I will make this again reducing the time dramatically.  Thanks.

Very good! A note- If you are going to make this recipe you should know it's more of a custardy M&C. This was a hit with the adults, but the "Blue Box" lovers weren't thrilled with it. It was veeeery easy to make, but I did make a few alterations...I added some sliced Velveeta to help add some creaminess, a touch more canned milk than called for, a touch of honey, a little extra pepper. I also precooked my pasta, but only until it was just softened, still quite firm- this prevents a mushy texture. I stirred this a couple of times, cooking it on low. I don't think this is something I would cook all day, as it was actually ready to enjoy within a couple of hours. This would be a great addition to grilled chicken and cole slaw when you don't want to heat up the kitchen with your oven. Yum!

The aroma of this dish was great, but the textural results less pleasing.  It had a strange cottage cheese-like texture, and the pasta was quite soft.  Not something that I would make again, with (good) cheese costing what it does! I'm glad that some folks liked it though:-)

I was very excited to try a slow cooker mac 'n cheese recipie, when I found this one, my expectations were high.  I was so disappointed-I followed the recipie to a "T", but the mac 'n cheese turned out clumpy and extremely oily.  I did cook for less time, and I added the noodles uncooked, as suggested in my slow cooker instructions.  Oh well... I'll try baking next time!

This is very easy.  And very very rich.  Too rich even for the bf, who loves mac and cheese and cream of whatever soups . . .but he was complaining about the amount of creaminess and made me add in more pasta, for a total of 16 oz (I boiled the other 8 oz since I'd already served the mac n cheese by then).  To be fair, I may have added more cheese than called for since I added nacho cheese sauce (which by the way, made it flavorful, so if you are wanting a less bland cheese sauce, it fit the bill) and some leftover spreadable cheese (yes, I was cleaning out the fridge, I admit.) along with the cheddar called for.  However, I did only use 2 cups of cheddar and tossed in the rest of the cheese.  This really does work in the crockpot, but you really cannot just set it and leave for your workday of 8-10 hours.  You need to stir it--I stirred every half hour--and you can just put in the pasta directly into the crockpot.  All told, the cheese was in the crockpot by itself for about an hour and a half, then the pasta was in there for about an hour.  With more pasta--which you'd definitely have to boil separately bc there's not enough sauce to coat it, I don't think--this works for us.  thanks for the recipe!

Easy to make, very yummy.  It did start to stick and burn a little, so plan on stirring it up occasionally.

I have attempted this recipe several times because I love the idea of crockpot mac&chz. As written, it is not creamy at all! I finally wised up and do the following:  Omit the egg. Use Velveeta not cheddar chz! Use whole milk and water. When you use whole milk (about 2 cups) and water (about 1 1/2 cups) you do not even need to precook the pasta! Trust me on this!

My two little grandsons love mac and cheese and it just didn't taste like the real thing.  Perhaps I am too used to the cheap box variety.

Beyond mushy noodles (even though I boiled AND cooked for less time than recommended), not at all creamy, and pretty bland, aside from the salty flavor.  I won't even try to alter this recipe to make it better; it needs too much work.

This was an awesome recipe!!!  Made exactly as stated but had to use the cheese on hand - which made absolutely no difference...I'm thinking.  Used 1 C. of Velveeta (which I really don't care for but used it for it's creamy qualities, 1/2 C. Parmesan, 2 C. Sharp Sheddar and 2 slices of provolone.  So sorry to say I couldn't post a picture because...simply said...it just didn't last around this house after serving.....Thank you for an awesome recipe!!!

We really enjoyed the recipe.  Thank you.  It was very creamy after only a few hours of cooking.  If left cooking too long in crockpot, the cheese gets chunky.

This was a great recipe! I think the crunchy, sticking cheese complaints are actually what makes this so good! Adds great texture to the dish. I made a few adjustments for our family. I added 1tbs of Dijon mustard, some finely chopped onion, garlic powder and made a roux sauce with flour, butter and 2c of skim milk since I didn't have any evaporated milk on hand or an egg. Turned out wonderful! If your expecting Kraft Mac n' Cheese skip this recipe. It's a much better version in my own opinion!

Their is just no nice way to say how horrible this came out.  The cheddar all seperated and became clumpy, the sides that touched the slow cooker became dark and hard. We will not be making this again.

i was really not impressed with this recipe. I could not imagine cooking this for as long as the recipe indicates. Then I tried it with the velveeta, and it was better. i think it would be ok if your'e home to stir it every now and then, and add additional milk when needed. definitely don't cook the pasta ahead of time.

This was absolutely EXCELLENT. I was so impressed by the flavor and consistency! I watched it often and stirred every 15 minutes or so the last hour. I also continued to add a bit of skim milk every time I stirred to keep the consistency creamy and not too gluey. So impressed! Will definitely make again!

I ended up throwing it out. It cooked much faster then the recipe said and the cheese became coagulated. I even put the slow cooker on warm and it still burnt.

I love mac & cheese, but I did not care for this recipe. The cheese separated and it looked bad. It tasted ok, my not the best I have ever tried. I will probably not make this again.

This was ok. I think mac and cheese is probably a little difficult to make in a slow cooker. Mine was done way before 8 - 10 hours and soggy. If you want something you can just assemble and go without checking on then this is not the recipe for you. If you have time to monitor the macaroni while cooking then it's probably pretty good.

I followed the recipe with the exception of using regular milk instead of the evaporated milk.  It was not edible as far as my family goes.  It smelled good, but did not look or taste good.

I think our family must not like mac and cheese made with cheddar; we're used to a creamier, Velveta-type sauce.  We found the cheese to be clumpy, and unappetizing looking.  If this is what you are used to, however, you'd probably like it.  It's certainly easy!

Okay, what the heck. It was delicious before cooking it on low for a few hours. Honestly, the slow cooker aspect isn't even that necessary.  It's just congealed instead of being creamy.

I made the recipe exactly as it is written, but only cooked the whole thing together for an hour. It didn’t need more cooking as it was starting to get stuck to the sides of the pot. It came out amazing!!

Very tasty!  Tastes better than it looks.  Have to agree with some of the other reviews and wish I had remembered before making, sub velvetta for the cheddar.  Kids turned their noses up to the look of the clumpy cheese.  Adults liked it.

If you use real cheddar cheese, only cook for a max. of 1 hour if you want a smooth creamy cheese sauce.  Just put all ingredients including noodles in at once. I also add about a tsp of flour and shred my cheese.

Have made this a few times and it's always a hit!! I usually put the pasta in first then combine sauce in bowl and pour over. just seems to mix easier. Have also done this in the oven when having a pot luck but couldn't use a slow cooker. Cooked macaroni ahead of time, kept it in a large casserole pan. The day of cooking I just mixed all sauce ingredients on the stove top, poured over pasta and heated through in over for about 20 min. Either way you do it, it always is a huge crowd pleaser!!

This was terrible. I made it just as the directions say. I am a bit frusturated at the reviews that have 4+ stars and they have changed the recipe a lot. When you change it a little that is okay but to use a totally different cheese, which is the main ingredient, that is frustrating to others. If you try this the time on how to cook is totally off. Good Luck.

I love this web-site and hate to give bad marks on anything, aside from using a reduced fat cheese I followed the recipe exactly. It came out so clumpy that I actually stopped cooking it after 2 hours and threw it away. I will not be making this again.

This was a congealed mess by the end of the first hour after the macaroni was added. Poor texture, and almost no flavor. We tossed it out and made a box of kraft mac & cheese.

Huge hit.   Par boiled the pasta.  I used 3 cups of velveta, and half cup of pepperjack.  Gave it a nice bite.  I only cooked for 2-2.5 hours.

i love love love mac & cheese, and i love slow cookers, so i thought this would be an wish fulfilled.  unfortunately, the end result was not as tasty as i would have liked.  i think that the cheese sauce overheated and separated, because it was a little sour and a little grainy.

I've had bad luck with crock pot pasta recipes but this worked. Like some other reviewers I didn't cook the pasta but all worked out to perfection!

I made this for after church on Sunday afternoon. The only change I made was using different cheeses. The general concensus was that it was too cheesy.  That would be the only change I will make next time, and there will be a next time.  Very good mac and cheese.

Was okay.  Had to had alot of milk and it was still very think.  Thou I did add pepper jack chesse to give it a little kick. And I did add some Velveeta cheese to make it more creamy.

I was so excited to try this but was left with dissapointment.  Just not good.  And so many just as simple but tastier mac and cheese recipes that can be made much quicker in the oven.  Wont make this again.

I made this for the first time on Thanksgiving and it was awesome.  It was a hit!  Fast and easy to cook.  I probably should have sprayed the inside of the crockpot before making it.  It did burn a little around the sides, but it was still great.  I'm making it more often.

I love macaroni and cheese, but apparently not cooked in a slow cooker!  Turned out a thick mush.  I didn't even pre-cook the pasta, and it still turned out very mushy.

I liked the taste of the Mac and Cheese but it was a little too clumpy for my family's style.  It cooked way faster than I thought it would. The taste was good but probably won't make this again.

My children really liked this. I found the bottom of the pot to be sort of a quiche consistency. I did stir well, perhaps I did not cook long enough? I see many recipes calls for 6+ hours. Flavor was good. Will try again.

This is a great recipe for mac and cheese. A lot of people thought the texture is not pleasing but that is because of the cheddar cheese. There is not really a way to make cheddar creamy without it getting clumpy. Very good to eat though!! My whole family loves it!

This was a great recipe, although I added cream cheese, and a can of cheddar cheese soup, I also didnt cook the macaroni fully before I put it in with the cheese sauce.  It was a little too custardy for my liking, but my husband loved it.

I think i probably over cooked the sauce with this recipe. When I stirred it halfway through the cooking time it looked great and tasted cheesy and smooth. Later on it turned into a kind of cheesy scrambled egg.delicious but didn't look so good!!! I will definately make it again because it tasted so lovely....i think the error is with my timing not the recipe.

I happened to be out of the evaporated milk so I tried this recipe with powdered milk (and water of course) and a box of mac & cheese.  I added only about 2 cups of cheese and added some browned ground turkey and it was a big hit with the kids.  I really liked the fact that I could make it in the morning and when the kids and I got home after a busy day it was ready.  It wasn't pretty, but very delicious!

It was greasy and it separated.  I wouldn't recommend this recipe.

This was very easy! The end result did not look good, but my very picky 3 year old and husband loved it! I only  cooked for 1 hour after pasta is added or it dries up. Anything that I can get my son to eat is great.
