followed the recipe to the letter.the flavor was very tasty, only thing wrong was that I used thawed hamburger,the loaf was  very "wet" or not firm.even with that,there was'nt  much left over.baked mac and cheese accompanied the meal. Will definitely make it again but  use  fresh not  previously frozen ground beef, if that does'nt fix it maybe  one more egg and an increase in the breadcrumbs to make it firm. very yummy!

I used Pork Sausage and sprinkled mozzarella cheese and spread tomato paste on the top, it was an awesome meatloaf.

This meatloaf is great! I'm an impatient cook, so I didn't let it cook long enough. However, it was great and my family loved it.

Made this last night for the fam and they ALL loved it!  It was nice and moist.  I think next time I might only use 1 egg.  Also, I omitted the onion since the salsa I used was pretty chunky.  I used onion powder (~1tsp.) and garlic powder (~1Tblsp.), also.  This is TOTALLY going in my recipe box!

We love this recipe.  I have made it several times and I have used various BBQ sauces and salsas and it always turns out great.  Nice change from the standard meatloaf.

Loved this meatloaf.  Made it with ground turkey and added a few dashes of chili pepper and cayenne pepper to give it a nice (but not overwhelming0 kick.  Added pressed garlic as well.  The meatloaf was nice and moist.  I had some right after it came out of the oven and it crumbled a little.  Served more of it an hour later and it stayed together nicely.  It was  big hit.  Will definintely make it again.

I used 1 1/4 lbs. ground turkey instead of the 1 1/2 ground beef ( healthier) and only 1 egg. Most of the reviews read that it didn't hold together well.  I'm pretty sure you should only add one egg per lb of meat which is most likely why it is too loose as written, it either needs 2 lbs of meat or 1 egg. I choose the latter. I shaped it into a loaf on a foil-covered cookie sheet (with edges) rather than in a loaf pan. Also I let the meat loaf "rest" for about 5 minutes before slicing it. I gave it 5 stars because most meatloaf recipes do not translate well to a turkey meatloaf, but this one was very good as is.

Wonderful recipe!  Used half turkey and half beef that was previously frozen so only one egg was used.  Added 1/2 cup of chopped bell pepper for more veggies (usually used in previous meatloaf).  Will add to my recipe collection.  Thanks.

Really good!!! My husband had been complaining that my "Betty Crocker" meatloaf was too dry, so I decided to try this recipe, and it was perfectly juicy!  It also seemed plumper than my usual meatloaf.  I added garlic and banana pepper (and omitted the salt & celery salt) so mine was nice and spicy!

This recipe was different, but I wasn't hot over it.   It was so moist, it fell apart when cut into.  I had to eat it like ground hamburger rather than slice it.  Maybe more breadcrumbs or using one egg instead of two would have helped.

This was very tasty as written.  I do think next time I will add more crumbs or crackers to hold it together a little more.  I guess that is just what I am more use to.  But the flavor was good and will make it again.

this was okay, we used a capsicum salsa and it didn't really go, would make it again without tweaking and see how it turned out. Mine was lovely and moist.

Meatloaf was awesome!  I added some jalapenos, black olives and muschrooms to spice it up and give it a little zing.

This is a little bit watery like some of the other reviews said, but you'll get over that once you taste it. I'm not a big fan of meatloaf but the taste of this was mouth watering!

Loved it.  Used Piacate sauce instead of salsa and cooked it in my smoker at 275 with a temperature probe so I knew when it was done.  Hint: put the meat loaf in the freezer for about 30 min then take it out of the pan, then you can cook it without it sitting in all that grease.

Really tasty recipe!  I found that this, if eaten the day prepared, is alittle too moist, and would suggest cutting back on the amount of liquid.  However, if eaten the next day or two... firms up and is better.  But really a wonderful taste!  Will definately make again!  Thanks.

I rarely make meatloaf, and decided this would be a treat for my husband.  Well, I'm glad I made this because, he absolutley LOVED it!  I used sweet garden salsa, and honey barbeque sauce.  I'm sure a healthier verision would be to use ground turkey, but then you would have to adjust the ingredients a bit.  Great recipe, and so easy to make!

My family did not care for this meatloaf.  It was a little "too" something but we couldn't quite figure out what.  The only thing I left out was the celery salt but I don't think that made the difference.  We won't bother making it again.

My husband eats and loves his meatloaves. He said this might have been the best one I ever made. I agree it was a tad crumbly but the taste of the salsa veggies with the onions he said was a nice touch.

I used lean ground beef and expected the meatloaf to have some difficulties staying in loaf form which it indeed did. However, taste was bland, would have enjoyed more of a kick to bring out the "southwest style". Easy to make and edible.

I've prepared a south-western meatloaf for years, much like this one.  Instead of bread crumbs I use crushed Fritos corn chips and some taco spices.  I made this the first time for my father.  I was just a young girl feeding Dad while Mom was away.  He said "that was the best darned meatloaf I've ever had, but don't tell your Mom I said that".  They are both gone now and I think of Dad when I make this meatloaf.  Thanks for the memories Dad.

Love this recipe.   It is my go-to one.   I find myself making it slightly different each time but mostly based on whatever I have in my pantry.   Sometimes it seems more Mexican in flavor and sometimes more Italian.

1 1/2 pounds of hamburger does not cook in 1 hr, I usually have to add 20 minutes. I also cut back on the catsup and add 2 Tbl. salsa. Additionally, I use Panko bread crumbs, which helps to not make it so wet.

This will be my new go-to meatloaf recipe. It was excellent. I used salsa with a medium heat level and mesquite bbq sauce. Followed the recipe to a "T", and I found nothing that I would change; it's perfect as-is.

I have modified this recipe to use ro-tel instead of salsa and more spicy bbq sauce than ketchup in both loaf and cupcake sizes and it's awesome!  Pop a little garlic mashed potatoes on top and the cupcakes are a mad hit, plus, you can freeze the naked cupcakes for a quick snack at a later date.

Very tasty with a little kick. I added extra cornflake Crumbs, soft but not falling apart. May try with one egg next time.

We love this recipe my kids used to always complain when I made meatloaf for dinner until now, when I make this recipe I hear compliments not complaints! I did not make any changes except I add BBQ sauce on top towards the end of the cooking time

Like many others who reviewed, I am not generally a fan of meatloaf, but husband likes it, so I thought I'd give it another try. I really liked the moisture and flavor of this recipe. Like at least one other, I used Panko for the breadcrumbs, because I had them on hand. And I used just one egg at the suggestion of some. It was a bit crumbly, but I highly prefer that to the more firm recipes I've used.

Great flavor!  Used a 20 oz. package of ground turkey, 1 egg, and just 2 Tbs of the BBQ sauce and a splash of spicy mustard. Cooked for 1 hour and 15 minutes until the internal temp reached 165. Added shredded cheese on top and placed under the broiler for the last few minutes. Held together just fine!  Served with rice and steamed veggies.

I have found that if you add a little cheeze-its (your choice, but Peperjack would be good) instead of bread crumbs or crackers or with it as well, it gives it a great flavor!

This was my first time making a meatloaf, and I made it for my son who is in the hospital recovering from cancer and a stem cell transplant. His taste buds are struggling from chemotherapy, so I thought this recipe would be perfect to get his taste buds dancing. I was right! He loved it! I have never been big on meatloaf, but I will definitely make and eat this one again! Fantastic!
