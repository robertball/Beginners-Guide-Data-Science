Tried this last night for dinner, only cut the cooking time down.  Once lobster shells turn red the meat is done, that is when the lobster should be removed from pan.  Other than that the flavor was great, my husband loved it.

This recipe was delicious, the lobster flavor definitely came through in the end with good, solid flavor.  I started the recipe and wasn't sure where it was going to end up since the recipe offered two suggestions for the lobster itself. The only addition I made was to add some tomato paste to thicken up. No need to read further the recipe works completely as is.

Couple of thoughts - First I used shears to cut the bottom of the lobster tails before cooking with two thoughts in mind.  First it will let some more lobster seep into the sauce, second, I am going to have to open the lobster tail at some point so this was a good place to start.  Then I followed the recipe completely but pulled the lobster tails out about 45 min during the simmering.  I stirred and pressed the sauce and added two Tablespoons of Tomato Paste to thicken it up.  I cut the tops of the shells and pulled out the meat.  I cubed the lobster meat and put it back in the sauce for the remainder of time. Again the recipe works great as written these were just some observations.

Very good easy recipe, I followed it to the letter with just a little twist, I used 15oz of diced tomatoes (that's all I had in the cupboard) instead of 28oz crushed and for a little added flavor I substituted organic red pepper tomato soup for the tomato sauce (32 oz).  I cook with fresh, all natural or organic ingredients so the flavors blended wonderfully and I also left the lobster in for the full cooking time to add to the flavor like the recipe stated.  I will make this again; I made just a small handful of cappellini pasta and tossed it in the mix with the lobster meat right before serving, yum!
