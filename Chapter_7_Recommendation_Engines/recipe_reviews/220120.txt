I was looking for a quick and easy recipe and stumbled across this.  I only had cod, but it worked perfectly.  I followed the recipe (almost) exactly.  It was spicy and delicious.  Highly recommended.

This was very yummy and fast. I was worried the maple syrup was going to make it too sweet, but it was well balanced with the Cajun seasoning.

This was definitely spicy for our taste but it was approved to try again so this recipe gets a solid 4 stars.  I could see the paste complementing any firm fish such as salmon and I think it would also be good on shrimp.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

This syrup mixture is sweet and spicy and delicious! I brushed it over salmon and baked it in a 400 degree oven for 20 minutes.

This was good and spicy! I didn't have Cajun seasoning, so I made the "Simple Cajun Seasoning" recipe on this site. 
Instead of brushing the seasoning on, I threw it in a ziploc with the Mahi Mahi for 5-10 minutes, then cooked it under the broiler. My 6 year old said, this is a 5 star meal!

This is going to be one of my favorite recipes!  I loved this and it was so easy to make......not to mention fast which is a must when you  have a baby!  We have made this twice with  two different cajun seasonings....just remember not all brands of cajun seasoning are created equal! We love "Slap Ya Mama" form Louisiana, but also use Zataran's which isn't as spicy.  Thank you Janel!  This recipe is great!

I am making this for the second time since Christmas.  The flavors definitely draw you back and it is easy to prepare and company worthy. I used the "lite" version of Tony Chachere's as my creole seasoning.  It is lite on salt - not on heat!  I am making a double batch of the sauce this time so I'll have some extra  for rice.  I will not double the creole seasoning, however.  I like things spicy but it was a kicked up a little high for me.  If you are making it for the first time I would advise starting with half of the tablespoon-- you can always add more!
This recipe does not disappoint.  Thanks for sharing Janell.

This recipe just didn't quite do it for us, although it certainly was easy. I cooked a batch of rice and while that was simmering, I mixed the spices with the syrup. While the fish was cooking, I tossed a spring greens salad with balsamic vinaigrette, which was an excellent complement to the rice and the heat of the fish. Bust the fish wasn't the star it should have been. It was my fist time cooking Mahi Mahi and it seemed a bit bland, despite the Cajun spice. I will give it another try with different fish and see how that works for us. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This is now my absolute favorite way to cook fish.  Other reviewers have said that a lot depends on the cajun seasoning that you use, and it definitely does.  My grocery store generic is way too mild for this, so I usually toss in a little cayenne pepper.  I don't always like spicy food, but something about the mix of the sweet and the spicy just hits home for me.  I definitely recommend this recipe, just remember that a lot depends on which cajun seasoning mix you use.  But even with one that's too mild, it will still be good fish.

This was a hit in my home even with my 11 year old fish-hating son.  I did not have Cajun seasoning so I used Southwest seasoning blend by Pampered Chef.  Tasted terrific.

This was great! Made the recipe exactly as written. Quick, easy and very flavorful! I will make this again. I used Creole Seasoning Blend from this site as the Cajun spice. *I've made this several times now and still love it. One thing I do differently is to put the oil in with the maple syrup and spices and coat both sides of the fish with it. Then I lightly spray my frying pan with Pam and add the fish.  I also made it on the George Foreman Grill, and it turned out great.

OMG! I love sweet and hot! I thought this was perfect although my husband thought it was a little hot. Instead of using the cajun seasoning (really high in sodium!) that I had in the cupboard, I looked up on this web site how to make my own cajun seasoning and used much less salt than needed. Next time I'd like to add a mango or melon salsa for the top. This is definitely a keeper.

Good flavor.  I baked in individual foil packets on a cookie sheet at 400 for 16 minutes  Used real garlic in place of powder and cut the Cajun in half but could have gone with the full amount.  Used sugar free syrup- just the right amount of sweetness.

Excellant and easy. It is however definately spicy. I used Tony Cacheres creole seasoning and real maple syrup. Also, I only brushed the seasoning on top on fish, and cooking in a black iron skillet.

I thought this was quite tasty, made as directed  other than turning the heat down some so the glaze wouldn't burn, as my fillets were on the thick side.

I am rating his on what I think it should tast like.  I want it to be good.  The problem is that in our market a Mahi fillet is a section of a fish which is nearly 2 inches thick at thickest side and perhaps 1 to 1 1/2 at the other.  Brain went to sleep on this one. That is I didn't look at the picture . You can't cook a 2 inch piece of firm fish in 5 min per side particularly with sugar on it. So, cooking it longer started to burn my Vermont maple syrup.    Rescue , some water lid and pan roast.  It was rescued but slightly bitter from the burned sugar.  So next time, lower temp, some water in the pan and a lid from the beginning . I will update my review when I adjust the cooking process for thick fillets.

Made this tonight for dinner and it is simply delicious!  Fast and easy are my call words and this recipe fits the bill.  Since I had 4 fillets (I used salmon) I doubled the sauce ingredients.  Will definitely be making this again.  Thanks for posting this wonderful recipe Janelle.  :)

This was really good - I reduced the cajun spice by A LOT and it was still pretty warm - I also added a lot more garlic powder.  I cooked the fish in a non-sick pan with just pan spray, minus the oil - hubs dug it!

Fantastic for how simplistic it is! I used Jerk Seasoning and regular pancake syrup (what I had on hand) and the mahi came out great; very flavorful for the little amount of time that it took to make. Next time I will try 1/4 clove of fresh minced garlic instead of the powder.

Excellent, a nice departure from the typical lemony flavors for fish.  I used Jerk seasoning instead and holy moly what a nice sweet and hot combination.  Thanks for the recipe.  It's a keeper.

Easy and very tasty. I skipped the maple syrup. I just couldn't see maple syrup on fish.  Actually, I just prefer my sweets sweet and my other foods to not be sweet.

The recipe I used was identical except only 3/4 tbsp of the cajun seasoning. The wife can't handle spicy, so I only used 1/4 tbsp. Not noticebly spicy at all, just added flavor. So dial in your spice using this as your range.  Little effort, big results. The lack of effort I'll keep secret when company  comes over.

Delicious! It tasted exactly like the butterfish recipe they have at Roy's Hawaiian Fusion Restaurant. My husband and 4 kids loved it! It was not too sweet at all and the flavors were very balanced. I used swai instead of mahi mahi and Italian seasoning instead of garlic powder because that is what I had. I will be making this recipe again and again.

This was so easy!  I rarely make fish, because it's often hard to find fresh fish here, and frankly I never know what to do with it.  This was great.  I used Tony Cachere's cajun seasoning, and pure maple of course.  Simple & delicious.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I had high hopes for this recipe but it was too spicy.  I will try it again with half the cajun spice and see if it's better.  Disappointed.

Great flavor but the fish seemed a little chewy instead of nice and flaky. Could've been the fillets I used. Next time I will try baking them instead.

Super quick and yummy. I didn't have cajun seasoning so I used Old Bay with Blackened Season.
I used MahiMahi but will definitely try this with tilapia and cod

Cooked according to directions 3 min per side since our fillets were small. Slightly spicy but nicely balance with the sweet. My picky eater boyfriend said he would eat these again!

This was a quick and simple dish to prepare. I didn't think that I had enough sauce for the two filets but the amount was just right.  While not a dish I would make for company, it was a good week night dinner.  Very tasty.

This is a new favorite in my house! What I did was sprinkle with Mahi Mahi with the Cajun seasoning and garlic powder. Then I put it in the pan, skin side up and cooked it about 4 minutes and then flipped it and cooked it 4 minutes longer. I then put it on a small cookie sheet and spooned the maple syrup Cajun seasoning glaze over the fish. Put it in a 350 degree oven till it at a temp of 141 degrees! Don't let it get over 141 or it will dry out fast!! Served over rice with green beans! Yummy

Quick and easy recipe that you can whip up in a blink! Light tangy flavor, not overwhelming, but can be easily adjusted for more of a spicy kick. Served it on a salad, and didn't even need dressing because of the juices/sauce from the fish was enough. I added salt and pepper. I will try marinating the fish next time.

Unfortunately, the glaze mostly burned, which left the fish tasting kind of....fishy with not as much flavor as I was expecting. On the plus side, it was easy to make.

I made this with two beautiful mahi filets, one ended up in the gulf for fish food. It was a total fail for me. Hubs hated it, I was so disappointed, thought I would love it, it was a mouthful of spicy, salty mess.

My boyfriend absolutely loved it! He said it was the best fish he'd ever had. I thought the cajun seasoning was a bit too powerful, so next time I'll do a lighter brushing. I actually dumped the remainder of the mixture on the filets as they cooked, so that's probably why it was a bit overwhelming. All and all, great recipe. I'll make this again.

I had high hopes, but the maple didn’t come through at all, just spice. Tried again with more maple and less spice (and fresh garlic), and still meh. This time I ultimately heated a little maple syrup and drizzled on the mahi - better, definitely tasted the maple, but wasn’t spectacular.

We really liked this recipe -- I think it's 4 stars as written, but when I made it, I thought it needed "something" extra --  generous grindings of  black pepper and sea salt helped elevate it to 5 stars.   Note -- your choice of Cajun seasoning will determine whether you need more salt, pepper, or even a bit of cayenne.

This recipe was fantastic. We are not huge on salmon, but with this recipe we are now. I hit mine with a little splash of lemon juice when I took them off the heat just to give it a little moisture back before serving.

Wonderful and easy, but should you use “Slap Ya Mama” for the Cajun seasoning, cut by half! Too spicy.

Easy, tasty and the perfect glaze for the Mahi. I’m gonna have to try it with Salmon. I followed the recipe and it was great. Love a five minute mix :)

The glaze stuck to the pan and, when burned, the maple syrup smell is ghastly! The fish itself was alright, although did have a strong taste.

Simple and delicious. apprehensive about a tablespoon of Cajun seasoning, so only used a teaspoon (and used a rib rub seasoning because didn’t have Cajun) and only used a quarter teaspoon of garlic powder. It was flavorful, but next time will use the full amounts called for in the recipe. Spooned sauce from pan after cooking over the fish and rice on the side. Yum! Yum! Yum! Love this recipe.

So easy and perfect for mahi but I will definitely try on other fish. I cooked it for 3 minutes both sides in frying pan then baked for 5 minutes at 400 degrees in my little Breville oven.

So good! Perfect balance of sweet and spicy. I added some dried onion flakes because we love those, but otherwise followed it exactly. Served over a bed of steamed veggies. Even my very picky eater son couldn’t get enough.

This is my first time trying anything with mahi mahi.  I made it as written and found that even though the sauce is good (tough to go wrong with the combination of garlic, tomatoes and wine), it overwhelms the fish. All I tasted was the sauce. Thank you for sharing the recipe.

Great recipe! I didn’t have any maple syrup after all so I used organic honey, I think it’s a great substitute. I paired it with broccolini and it was a perfect match! I’ll definitely be making this again soon.

i had 1lb  so added a bit of syrup/seasoning/garlic paste...just a bit. Have to give it time because the sugar burning off makes you think you are killing the fish..you are not. Cooked two 8 oz fillets about 9/10 minutes total. Real good.

I often fish the Sea of Cortez while staying at the Hotel Palms de Cortez. We bring our catch home frozen in coolers in the form of checked luggage at the airport. 
Well anyway I ran out of Mahi Mahi so I tried this recipe with Wahoo. Yum, what a nice recipe. I recommend doubling the maple sauce. I will cook again.

The cajun seasoning was very over bearing. Maybe lower the amount of seasoning to better balance with the syrup.

This was very delicious. Non-seafood loving BF loved it too, kept saying how great it was and how my seasoning was spot on. I added one crushed garlic clove to the glaze and some chili powder. I added some Irish smoked sea salt to the fish ahead of time and also to the glaze before cooking, and it tasted way too salty, so I added just a little more syrup to balance it out. I would not add salt next time, as the Cajun rub I purchased clearly had adequate salt. Brushed on other side after flipping as well. I cannot wait to have leftovers for lunch! MMM!

Perfect balance between sweet and spicy.  I found a recipe for simple cajun spice as I didn't have it on hand.  Turned out just right! The mahi mahi comes out moist and tender.

This recipe was phenomenal. We made it with fresh tilapia using store-bought cajun seasoning (I'm sure the homemade version is ever better, but it tasted just fine to us) and Camp maple syrup. It was nice and spicy, but definitely not overpowering for our tastes. The sweet-spicy combo was excellent, but it still allowed the flavor of the fish to shine. And it was SO easy. Will definitely make again.

Loved the taste of sweet and spicy with the Mahi Mahi. Used organic pure maple syrup and "Cajun Spice Mix" by DiamondLil from this site. Felt everything was spot on for cooking time. Just needed to pay more attention to the fillets after the first sear.  We had different sized fillets (approx. 1-4oz and 1-6oz) and next time I'll be sure to increase the amount of paste. Mine ended up overcooked a little and tasted bland whereas my husband's fillet was perfectly cooked and had more of the flavors come through too. Delicious and easy to make! Will be making this again!

Easy to make. I used regular pancake syrup and honey because I didn't have Maple. It tasted just great. I would use less cajun spice next time, was a tad salty. But all in all this was a great flavorful dish!

Flavors would have been perfect if the full amount of creole seasoning were halved. Made it too salty for me and I love salt. I used Tony Chachere'a. 

Other than that the sweet heat is yummy.

It wasn't bad. I'm just not a huge spicy food fan so I used a lot less of the cajun seasoning to dull the spiciness down.  I liked the taste but next time I think I'll add some garlic powder or onion powder.

Used Tony Chachere's Creole seasoning.  Followed recipe. Cooked filets 5 minutes on 1st side and 3 minutes on other side.  Spicy deliciousness.  Will definitely use this recipe again.

I'm new to the cooking world and eating fish but this seemed easy enough. I thought the maple syrup would make it a bit to sweet but the other spices were a great blend. Thanks for sharing the recipe I will do this again.

For the first time using this recipe, I thought it was excellent! Some prior reviews mentioned cooking it at a lower heat with thick fillets. I would wholeheartedly recommend that. The marinade got a little too caramelize before the fish was done. I look forward to using this on salmon also.

This was so easy to make and really good!! I didn't have "cajun" seasoning exactly, but I had Flavor God spicy everything seasoning. My husband was worried that it would be too sweet---not at all. Really tasty.

This was so, so easy and nom...nom...nom good. I mixed up the maple syrup, cajun spice and garlic yesterday but something came up so my fillets were left in the marinade for 24 hours. I don't know how much difference that makes, but, because there wasn't anything acidic in the mix to "cook" it chemically I figured it was okay. It was fantastic! The flavors are extremely complimentary and there is just enough sweet and fiery to be a great taste pairing. Definitely a new favorite. Pretty presentation on a bed of rice too.

Used Zatarain creole seasoning instead of cajun seasoning. Sweet and spice flavor is good, but too salty.
Next time, going to try it with diy reduced-salt cajun seasoning.

Made it . Followed the recipe exactly.  My daughter LOVED it! Next time, I need to double the recipe.  She "inhaled" the fish even before the buttered  noodles were finished cooking. Yes, it was that delicious!  Thank you for sharing this awesome goodness!

Fabulous! I made it with trout because that's what I had. I followed the recipe exactly--using homemade Cajun seasoning from another recipe on this site. This would be an excellent sauce for almost any type of fish/seafood, I would think. Hubby licked the plate clean. It's a keeper!

I made it exactly as specified, including using real maple syrup.  I was looking for another way to cook fish, and this recipe didn't disappoint.  If you like sweet and spicy together in a glaze, this is the recipe for you.  Mahi is the perfect type of fish for this recipe also.

This was very good, but I did change the cooking method - thus only four stars.  I used one of the creole seasoning mixes from this site (please don't ask which one because I have made several different ones, and can't remember which one this was!), and instead of frying it on the cooktop, I baked it in the oven - preheated to 400 degrees, for about 15 minutes (our filets were rather thin) on a baking sheet that had a very light coating of avocado oil (better for cooking at high temperatures, so I've read).   Perfect, without the extra oiliness I seem to get when frying fish.  My husband thought it was very good too - his only request was that when we make this again (and we will), was to brush both sides of the fish with the maple glaze.  Thanks for a great recipe - I never would have thought of a maple glaze for fish;  however, having had this I'm going to try one of the salmon recipes from this  site that includes maple syrup!

I needed something really quick and easy as I ran out of time to cook the recipe that I bought the Mahi Mahi for.  My son and hubby really liked this.  I will for sure make this again.  I served with wild rice with fresh chopped jalapeno stuffed in poblano peppers with cheese on top.

I made a similar yet far more labor intensive dish that called for Salmon and I liked it so I figured this would be just as good. I had my heart set on some Mahi but when I got to Publix I saw that Swai was on BOGO, soooooo I got the Swai. Good news, it was delicious!!

this was our first time having mahi mahi, sadly i should have made a lot more. I marinate it for about 30 min, because I like the added flavor.

This was so good. It tasted so amazing. I cooked it in foil and it did a great job of keeping the juices in. 
I also used chicken season with a little bit of chili and it was perfect for someone whose not very fond of spicy food.

Quadrupled sauce recipe.  Pre-heated oven to 400.  Basted fish, baked for 10 minutes.  Basted fish again and broiled until caramelized....about 3-4 minutes.  FABULOUS!!!

WOW.  Super easy and really good.  I like spicy food, but boy this was spicy with a nice sweetness to it. I actually cut down on the cajun spice a tad bit.  But i highly recommend this recipe!

This is so easy and so good. I also use this maple Cajun sauce on salmon. It is a hit with the whole family and tends to hide the "fishy" flavor for those that aren't as fond of fish.

Very nice flavor ! My family loves it! I also used it on pan seared chicken breast .  Pan seared chicken in olive oil and a touch of butter.  During last few minutes of cooking, I brushed on mdple Cajun mixture. Tastered great! Love to serve booth with oven roasted veggies like broccoli or asparagus, wild rice and fresh field peas with snaps.

This was so fun! I made my own Cajun spices with Tumerick, curry, Cayanne pepper, ground coriander, and smoked paprika! I added some French Piment, the garlic powder & maple syrup. I cooked as directed and the taste & tenderness was superb! The fish has a hint of sweet with a perfect kick. My family was happy :)

This was a nice surprise.  Mahi mahi isn't my favorite fish so the stronger flavor of sweet then spice was delightful.  I used homemade creole seasoning so it had the heat level that suits us, Cajun would be nice too, didn't have time to make my own.  I marinated the fish for an hour in the seasoning and maple syrup in a ziploc.  DH loved it too so will make again.

The mix was a bit too spicy for my liking and my husband disliked it as well.  Additionally, I tried using the spread on frozen mahi and it didn't come out very good at all. This is the second time I tried this recipe. I'd try it again, but with fresh mahi and a little less cajun spice.

I made this last night. I loved it! Very easy to prepare. My daughter who normally does not like fish, tried it and actually liked it. She said she would eat it again. The skin was crispy, the sauce was sweet, the fish was spicy.

It was a little spicy for the kids, but I was surprised at how well the flavors all blended together. It gave an otherwise mild fish a ton of flavor, and best of all, could be thrown together in a short time since I always have the ingredients on hand.

I could not find fresh mahi mahi and ended up substituting with catfish. FANTASTIC, simple seasoning. Next time I plain using it for entertaining a few guests.

Very tasty. Loved the combination of flavors! I did cut the amount of olive oil in half, though. Will make this again!

Incredibly fast and easy, with a delicious mix of flavors.  I tend to like things with a bit of heat, so this was an excellent way to incorporate - hot, plus the sweet of the maple syrup made for tasty times in my mouth.  If serving with rice, making a bit more of the sauce would be a good idea. I'll definitely be making this again!

Not sure I was into the sweet of the syrup with the spice of the cajun. I like maple syrup, and I like cajun, but the two together didn't mesh well. Which is strange because I usually like sweet and spicy. I may have put too much syrup in so I will try again with less.

I made this recipe for my daughter and I. This was excellent.  I did not use all of the creole seasoning as she doesn't like things too spicy.  This was a really simple and tasty recipe for fish.  I can imagine this on salmon as well!
