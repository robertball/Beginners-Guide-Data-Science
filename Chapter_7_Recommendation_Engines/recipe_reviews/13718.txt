This was a very good recipe - however to make it more pudding in texture and richer tasting- I added 2 eggs and a half a cup of half and half milk. This also gave it a more souffle appearance. I also used the "Jiffy" brand of cornbread mix as it has a sweetness already in the mix. I will use this recipe again.

I have never had corn pudding before but decided to make this just as "something different" for Thanksgiving.  I was reluctant, at first, because I come from a very traditional family and I wasn't sure how they would take it.  To my surprise, everyone loved it and raved about it.  Even the pickiest and most critical eaters loved it.  The only problem I had was, since I've never had corn pudding before, I really wasn't sure what the texture or consistency of it should be.  It says "pudding", so I'm thinking it should be the consistency of pudding.  But then maybe I was mislead by the directions on the recipe where it states that it's done when a "knife inserted in the center comes out clean".  Well, I waited and waited, and kept setting my oven timer over and over again, waiting for the knife to come out "clean", well, an extra 30 minutes or so later, it still wasn't clean and I don't think it ever did come out clean.  So, for those of us that are trying a recipe like this for the first time, maybe the directions should be more clear and less deceiving.  Although this came out really good, I'm still going to give it a 4, only because of the directions and the extra amount of time needed to make sure it was cooked (as per the directions).

This dish was delicious after I altered it a bit.  I added two eggs to the batter, as I wanted a dish more similar to pudding than cornbread.  I also baked it in a 9x13 dish as opposed to a casserole so that it would cook more evenly.  I will definately be making this again.

Very quick and easy.  Everyone likes it!  I rinse the corn to get the "canned" taste out.

My 12 year-old daughter mixed this up with no difficulties. I'd never tried a corn pudding recipe without eggs, but we all agreed that this turned out great!  Thanks for a simple, yet delicious, recipe!

Delicious! I would highly recommend substituting butter for margarine and sprinkling some sugar on top before baking. Enjoy!

My daughter made this for Thanksgiving.   We didn't have sour cream but substituted plain lowfat yogurt.  It was very delicious-minus a couple of calories.  Texture and taste was perfect.

I made this twice. Once exactly according to directions and it was good. The next time I added these variations and it was excellent! I added 1 beaten egg, 1 red pepper, 1 jalapeno. It was a hit at Thanksgiving dinner yesterday.

This was a huge hit at Thanksgiving - so much so that my son-in-law (a very picky eater) has asked me to bring it to their Christmas party.  I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and added 2 eggs; I also borrowed from another corn pudding recipe and sprinkled a little sugar on the top.  Delish!
Just a further note on this dish - it does not need to be served piping hot so it makes a great picnic or barbeque side dish for summer entertaining.  It's light, sweet, and just as good when at room temperature.

I've been eating corn pudding for years, but I've only made it once before. I used this recipe tonight and served it for Easter to people who had never had it. Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. Based on the suggestions I made a few modifications. I added 2 eggs, 1/4 cup sugar, and 1/2 cup half&half and used 1/3 cup butter instead of 1/2. I also sprinkled in some crushed red pepper, salt and pepper. I baked at 350 for 55 minutes, and it came out perfect.

Couldn't be easier and is delicious. It went perfectly with a pork roast. I added 2 eggs, beaten, and was careful not to cook too long. A nice addition to my recipe collection.

This was good, but it was more like a cornbread consistency where as I was looking for a more pudding/souffle like texture. My whole family loved it though!

As per other reviewers, I added 2 beaten eggs and 1/2 cup Half & Half, and I am also a huge fan of Jiffy Corn Muffin Mix, and I used that. I used butter instead of margarine. The result was a big beautiful souffle of corn pudding with fabulous flavor and texture. I've never tasted better corn pudding. I used it as a side dish to a pork loin. Big hit!

I make this quite a bit, only I add chopped crisp bacon and a drained can of whole kernel corn.  I also use butter instead of margerine and I grease the pan with bacon grease. Good thing I only make it a couple times a year. It's so good you just about gorge yourself.

I made this for a july 4th  picnic.  Before I could even get to the table to eat, it was gone! everyone asked if I had made more! I had worked the night before, and threw this together in the fridge when I got home that morning to bake later.  Got to love the quick, easy and tasty!

Great! I made this tonight with ham.  I used low-fat sour cream and made my own cream-style corn based on Brookville Hotel Cream-style Corn from this site (one can corn, 1/2 cup half & half, 2 tsp. sugar, 1/2 tsp. salt, 2 tsp. cornstarch--combine and bring to boil, stir & simmer till thickened, then use immersion blender to break up the kernels). The pudding turned out great.  I don't know what the consistency is supposed to be, but mine is soft and very moist after 45 min. at 350.

This was really good!! Everybody marveled at how tasty it was at Thanksgiving and I'm making it again for Christmas. I followed the recipie exactly, except i "messed up" and didn't drain the corn first. I was upset because I thought I'd ruined it but it turned out excellent...no one could even tell  =)

Made exactly as written and this corn pudding was very good.  It set nicely whereas the corn pudding recipes I've tried with eggs didn't. Will make this to go with our ham for Christmas but will add a few tablespoons of white sugar to sweeten it just a bit.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!!

This is definitely a comfort food, and comfort foods aren't usually gourmet dishes, but for what it is, I gave it a 5.  My husband and I were at a Bolivian restaurant this weekend for lunch and had a "corn pie" appetizer they called "huminta" which was sort of like a corn souffle (tastes similar to cornbread, but more moist like a pudding).  I topped it, as the restaurant did, with grated cheese, and also added 1/4 c milk to ensure moistness; I think I'd reduce that to 1/8 c as it seemed very moist, and one or two reviewers complained of dryness.  We had a carb-fest and ate half of it last night! :-)  Thanks, Becky.

I have to give 5 stars to any recipe that draws as many raves as this simple side dish.  I doubled the recipe nd used a 9 x 12 baking dish.  I added 2, not 4 eggs, and a minced onion.  I baked it for a little over an hour, until the knife came out clean (because it was deeper than a single recipe).  The outer edges overcooked a little, but no one minded.  I served this as a perfect compliment to a spiral ham, scalloped potatoes, green beans and the garlicky butternut squash (on this site).  All they talked about was this cord "pudding".  One last note:  Once we were finished with dinner, I had a few "squares" left over.  When I moved them to a container, the texture was quite a bit more firm, if that's how you like it.  I will let it cool for at least 45 minutes the next time I make it, and I will make it again for sure.  Thanks Becky!

The first time I made this I was very disappointed  it tasted funny and the consistency was mealy.  But I gave it a second chance, using the suggestions of other reviewers and rinsed the corn, added an egg and a sprinkling of nutmeg; I also used only half of the package of Jiffy.  The result was fabulous!  I've never had such good corn pudding. It had a nice custard texture without being too "eggy".   Some of us also stirred in a little Texas Pete at dinner :) so next time I'll probably do that in the preparation. Thanks for the tips, I'll be making this for Christmas dinner for sure.

Delicious!  I wanted to make enough for a 13x9 pan so I used 2 cans each of the kernel corn and creamed corn, but kept the other ingredient amounts the same - 1/2 c. of butter not margarine, 1 c. sour cream, and one box of corn muffin mix.  This was super easy to make and every single one of my dinner guests loved it!  Will definitely make this again!

Made this for Thanksgiving this year.  Everyone LOVED it!!  I would recommend baking in a shallow dish - or plan for a longer baking time.

Wow!  Of all the things I made for Thanksgiving, this got the most raves.  It had a really nice flavor and texture.  I was worried when I served it--it looked dry.  But the taste was phenomenal!

I have tried half a dozen corn casserole recipes from AllRecipes, but with an added egg, I like this one best.  I found it must have an egg to get the right texture, and I always use Jiffy Mix for some added sweetness.  I served this at a teacher's luncheon at Christmas, and have had many requests for the recipe.  It is so easy and so delicious.

I made this for my husband to bring into his work for a thxgiving potluck. He text me and said everyone loved it and pple were asking for the recipe! I followed other reviewers tips: Add 2 eggs, 1/2 cup half&half, 1/4 cup sugar, 1tbs crushed red pepper, salt/pepper and fried up some bacon which i ground up in food processor, added to the mix and used the leftover bacon grease to grease the 9x13 pan with. Baked at 350 for 55 minutes. It was just a test drive to see if pple liked it, if they did i was gonna make it for our family thxgiving. Since its a huge hit I will for sure make this for the family! Hopefully it will turn into a traditional recipe I can make every year :)

This came out a little dry for us. It was more like cornbread with corn in it. Not bad but I wouldn't call it corn pudding.

My version of this dish is to melt the butter in the casserole dish.  Then mix the other ingredients together, adding 1 egg and just a touch of salt, and pour on top of the butter.  Delicious!  Sidenote - this dish works with reduced fat sour cream but isn't as good substituting plain yogurt.

There is a rib joint nearby that makes a terrific "corn pudding" and I have been trying to find a similar recipe.  Most end up as more of a custard, and I was looking for something akin to Kentucky "spoon bread"--soft, moist corn bread.  Well, this is it!  A cake consistency, like corn bread, but the creamed corn and sour cream make it so soft and moist you really can use a spoon to eat it!  This recipe is wonderful in its simplicity--you can add all sorts of things to it!  I added some shredded cheddar, chopped green chiles and a little ground red pepper.  This is a fantastic side dish to accompany summer grilling--I love it with bbq ribs and chicken.  Thanks Becky!

really good!  right when i was ready to make it i noticed i forgot to get the sour cream--but i did have buttermilk and so i used a cup of buttermilk and it worked perfectly--i will use buttermilk in the future to save on fat and calories--i cut back on the butter a bit and added half a can of green chilies--makes a good size casserole!

I love this recipe, with 4 beaten eggs added. I always bake it in a hot water bath (boiling water in a larger pan)for about an hour and a half, it turns out like a poofy souffle, beautiful.

Very good, however my family all felt this dish was way to rich. The butter needed to be drained out of the bottom of the casserole dish.  I will try again with half the butter and half the sour cream.

Yummy!!!! My husband and I like corn so I decided to try this recipe and we both liked it. I made some changes though. :) I substituted margarine with natural apple sauce and sour cream with fat-free plain yogurt. I also used 1/2 cup of cornbread mix and 1/2 cup of yellow cornmeal. Baked at 350 degrees F for about 90 minutes. Thanks for sharing Becky.

This is a yummy dish, reminds me of the holidays when I was a little girl.  I didn't change any ingredients, but I did throw the whole mix in a blender.  I love it as is, but I have some picky eaters in my house that don't like the corn kernels.  The blender made it smooth and creamy!! Be careful, while it does depend on your oven and the dish used...it will still most likely take longer to bake.

I added one egg to mine (two was too many) and definitely prefer using real sour cream to yogurt. The yogurt didn't have a rich enough flavor. I also cut the butter by half (and used real butter).

This is a GREAT recipe! I added 2 eggs, 1/4 cup of evaporated milk, 1/2 cup of minced onions, and a can of cream of chicken soup. I had to cook it a little longer. 350 for 40 min. then 400 for about 20 min.

This was so good! It was kinda between corn bread and corn pudding. I was able to turn it on to a plate and then on to another plate so it was right side up. I followed the recipe to the tee except for baking it a full hour the first time I made it. The second time I made it I thought I'd make it "my own". After reading some reviews I decided that jalapenos sounded great,then I add two beaten eggs . In the store I seen some Mexicorn,"perfect" and then decided to put it in baking cups (cup cakes). Well they stuck to the paper in the baking cups and the jalapenos and Mexicorn took away the great sweet corn pudding/bread flavor. I'd give "my own" corn pudd'in ***3 stars at best. I'll be making this again, probably before the weeks out, but I won't be changing anything except the cook time. Five Stars!

Made this for Christmas dinner. I made it as stated for my daughter and spooned out a small ramekin for her, then added one egg and some chopped green and red peppers for the casserole. It was great both ways!

I didn't really know what to expect when I made this and was pleasantly surprised.  It was really good and both my husband and I liked it.  I did add two beaten eggs as recommended by others.  It took an hour to cook in my oven, but, was perfectly browned on top and a great texture.  I think I'll try the recipe as written next time though to compare the consistency.  No need to look further for a corn pudding recipe!

VERY delicious!  I am NOT a cook, but was surprised how EASY this was to make and was a huge success with my incredibly picky husband!  I didn't have a 2 quart dish so I made it in a square glass baking pan and even after 1 hour of baking the knife did NOT come out clean in the middle...after an hour 15 minutes I gave up and took it out and found that I overbaked it around all the edges.  Not sure if it was the baking dish I used or if it is suposed to be a bit "pasty".  Either way, don't be fooled with the knife not coming out clean, DON'T over cook it!  Other than that drama, it was delicious and better than my mother's age-old recipe!!

I modified this one to use the ingredients I had and other corn pudding recipes on this site.  Instead of the cream corn, I used two cans of corn and one can of cream of celery soup.  I added milk, sugar, and a can of diced green chiles. I only added half a container of cornbread mix.  When it went into the oven, the mixture was very moist, but when it came out, it was perfect!  It took about 50 minutes to cook.

This is a great recipe!!  I added 1 tblsp of sugar and used 1/2 cup melted margarine (I forgot to set it out to soften, so I microwaved it).  I also cooked this in a 9 x 13" pan for 30 minutes and it turned out perfectly.

Haven't made Corn Pudding in a very long time.  Made this last night and it was a hit with everyone except my 12 yr. old grandson.  Even a guy who had never eaten corn pudding before liked it.  Thanks,  Will definitely make often.

This recipe tastes very good and it is easy to make with items I have on hand.  I made it for a Christmas potluck with the family.  Everyone was asking who made it and what was in it.  I had a bit left over and warmed it the next day but it was a bit chewy.  I will make this again though just enough to eat for a meal.

I used fat free sour cream, one egg beater's egg and 1T sugar.  My son didn't care for it...but he's weird.  My husband and I both did.  I'll likely make this again.  It did take WAY longer than 45 minutes and I even ended up putting in the microwave at the end to get it done.  The knife never came out clean.

Very good and easy!  I didn't have sourcream, so I used 1c of lowfat plain yogurt instead, and about half the butter.  Also, added 1/4c of milk and 1 egg.

This? Was Fabulous! I made myself ill eating it because it was so good I just couldn't stop. Very, very rich. I wonder if you could use non-fat sour cream and have it not be so heavy. I'd hate to monkey with the flavor tho. Super yummers.

I made this dish for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit!  I had to make copies of the recipe for my guests to take home.  This will be a holiday regular on my table.  It's so easy to make and is true comfort food.  Thanks Becky.

This was tasty.  I accidentally left it in the oven about 15 minutes too long and it was just right for us.  I'll intentionally leave it in a bit longer next time.

I have been making this for 7 yrs for Thanksgiving and its always a hit & requested. I also add 2 eggs and I add a cup of Cheddar Cheese to the top for the last 10 minutes of cook time. It's done when the top is golden & not when a knife comes out clean. If your knife comes out clean then you've baked it too long!! Let this dish rest 10 minutes before cutting/spooning into it. Letting the dish rest allows it to set and you will get the best consistency when serving & eating.

Great holiday side dish. I had it the first time for a holiday potluck at work and fell in love with this dish and researched the recipe. 

It is my go to side dish to go along with ham. Easy, simple and yummy!

I always use butter instead of margarine.

I made this on a whim and it turned out so well I decided to make it on Thanksgiving. It made a wonderful addition to a traditional Texas lineup and everyone loved it, so much so that they asked for it at Christmas too! It's an incredibly easy and delicious recipe that I will, no doubt, make again and again.

Super easy and really, really good. As it was the first time making it, I followed the recipe exactly. I was a little nervous because it still seemed wet in the middle despite baking it a few minutes longer, but once I took it out of the oven, it "set up." I served this for Easter dinner and everyone enjoyed it. My mom copied the recipe and made it for a church dinner later that week, and she brought home an empty dish.

I can't stop craving this. I make it as side dish with chili and with Mexican meals. I use only half of the margarine called for and use fat free sour cream and its still great.

This was really good.  I doubted the sour cream at first, but the taste was the perfect balance--not too sweet and you can taste the corn bread.

I love this stuff! you can add fresh or canned jalepenos or diced chili peppers. I don't add eggs & don't think I'd like it any more pudding-y. I love the texture (like spoonbread) & it's so good w/ BBQ ribs or chili. Thanks!

This is nearly the same as a delicious corn pudding we had at a recent Thanksgiving. The only difference: bake for 15 minutes, sprinkle on a cup of grated parmesan and bake another 30 minutes.

Although my kids claim this is "not the same as grandma's", they managed to eat the whole pan. I cut the amount of butter and sour cream in half and added one egg. I will certainly make this again.

I have made this time and time again and everyone just loves it. The only thing I do different is I double the recipe and drain only 1 can of the whole corn and use the jucie in the mixture from the other can. It is really good. It taste like the corn pudding in the low coutry of SC. This is a great recipe

We love this corn pudding!  Everyone requests this as a side for Thanksgiving and Christmas.  Our neighborhood pitches in to provide Christmas dinner for the local firestation... guess what I fixed?!  I mix together in the morning, put in the fridge until time to cook, it couldn't be any easier.  Thanks for a great recipe!

We really liked this recipe. I added 2 eggs and used Jiffy as previously suggested. I also baked in a 3 QT dish. It was still 1 1/2 in. thick when done. I also made my own creamed corn, and used all fresh off the cob! Yummy!!

I am REQUIRED to make this for Thanksgiving and Christmas every year! Sometimes I add chives to the recipe, but either way it is great. Best of all, I can put it together in less than 5 minutes and know that everyone will be happy with it.

MY FRIEND MADE ME TRY CORN PUDDING FOR THE FIRST TIME, AND I LOVED IT.  UNFORTUNATELY, I FORGOT TO GET THE RECIPE FROM HER. SHE TOLD ME IT HAD SOUR CREAM IN IT.  SO, I TRIED THIS RECIPE! MY FAMILY REALLY LOVED IT. THE SOUR CREAM MADE IT MOIST. I BAKED IT FOR 40 MINUTES TILL IT WAS A LIGHT BROWN ON SIDES AND ON TOP. DON'T SKIP THIS RECIPE IT'S A KEEPER.

Some of the reviewers must not know what corn pudding is.  This is one of the best tasting corn puddings I've tasted, and it was really easy to make.  As with most recipes, I added a little Lawry's to the mixture.

I had this at a big potluck birthday party last weekend.  My sister and law and I walked around the room asking all 75 or more people there if they were the ones who brought the corn pudding, so that we could get the recipe!!  It was fantastic, and is MUCH easier than any of the other corn pudding recipes I've ever had.  I promised my sister in law that it would be on the table when we see each other again for Thanksgiving.

Excellent taste but, I agree, it should be called Corn Cake because it definitely isn't the consistency of pudding.  Teenagers would not eat it but my husband and I liked it.  Thanks, Nannie

Awesome! I Made this for thanksgiving and the varied "tastes" all loved it! even my finicky teenagers loved it! It was quick, easy and gone after one sitting!
I now use it as a very succesful side to my famous mexican dinners- chicken and steak fajitas, green salsa and homemade refried beans.

It was a big hit.  As one other reviewer suggested, I added 1/2 half & half and two eggs.  I received raves for this dish.  So easy.

Super simple and awesome! I doubled it with 4 eggs. Cooked almost 1.5 hours & got rave reviews from all. Not too pudding-like but really good. Sour cream makes it less sweet which is a good thing. Made it before w/o sour cream & it was way too sweet. Very rich!

This is a great recipe.  I added the two eggs and a little milk.  I also added two teaspoons of vanilla extract.  It came out killer. Every one went crazy over it. Try a little maple syrup on top. really tasty.

Made this according to the website & it was good. After reading the comments I added an egg & used less sugar- maybe 2 Tbsp-& less butter- 4-5 Tbsp. The best change was to microwave 2 ears of sweet corn & cut the kernels off & use this in place of canned regular corn. My diabetic husband appreciates the changes & it was still a great sidedish.

Made substitutions to the recipe by using butter instead of margarine, adding 1 egg and sprinkling top with Sugar before baking. Baked for 1 hour vs 45 minutes suggested.

Delicious, easy comfort food. However, the cook time wasn't NEARLY long enough. I had to bake it at least 20 minutes longer, and probably could have gone another 10 minutes or so but my timing for dinner was completely off due to this not being ready when the recipe said it would be.

I made it as written with a cup of Self Rising corn bread mix, and 1/2 c of oil, since I was out of butter or margarine. I put a bit of grated cheddar on top before baking. I think it is delicious, and I like the crunch of the corn kernels. I sprinkled some sea salt on top before serving. It is not creamy like a pudding, but very moist and flavorful. I bet it would be good with a can of  chopped green chilies mixed in.

This is my favorite no-fail holiday side dish! I make it every Thanksgiving and Christmas, and have used this recipe for years! I always substitute the "Soutwestern" corn (or Fiesta Corn, as it's sometimes called) to give it a little extra kick.

I made this recipe following the directions exactly. I have issues with those people who add this and that and still rate a recipe and often NEGATIVE.
This recipe is amazing. It is not the eggie soufflé that I recall as Corn Pudding. It is denser, thus making it easy to cut into neat little squares. 
As mentioned by other people, this was a hit at 2 different parties!  Serving it at room temperature, does not affect the yummy factor.
One small thing. The recipe itself calls for the cornbread mix.  It is actually as listed in the description "Corn Bread Muffin" mix. EZ does it.
My criteria for a good recipe is easy, not overly costly, and delicious. It is!
Please don't substitute margarine for butter, hominy for canned corn etc.  and expect it to taste as great as the excellent reviews state.  :)

I add one egg to this recipe, and sometimes sprinkle a little sugar on top before baking.  It's a new family favorite!

Tripled the corn and added 3 eggs. It was a yummy souffle of corn pudding goodness.

I added 2 eggs and baked it in a 9x13 dish. It turned out great. It ended up being my favorite dish at the table.

OK, I don't know how to rate a recipe I have tweaked.  We have many discussions about this on the Buzz.  But I want to tell you I used Greek yoghurt instead of sour cream and it worked fine.  Also added 2 eggs, as many others did. And I used two cans of whole kernel corn because I was already into making the recipe when I noticed I did not have creamed. Also threw in some dried chopped onions. So, I'm sorry for the changes.  But it was very good!

My mother-in-law had a recipe for this that my husband loved.  When I called to get it she couldn't find it.  So I tried this one and it was great!  Everyone in my house loved it.  The kids even asked for the leftovers, which they never do.  It is a keeper!

Was very good as the recipe stated, but I really hated sticking in an entire stick of butter. Would prefer a slightly healthier version, but as it is, it was really yummy. Will definately keep this one for special occasions and potlucks!!

Great just the way it is! The only change I make is using a 9x13 dish instead of the 2 quart. Huge hit with the family and always requested when doing get togethers. .

Excellent. I made this as a side for a burger cookout last night. Both kids and adults loved it.  I modified the recipe by cutting the sour cream in half and adding two beaten eggs. I also used frozen corn instead of whole kernal canned corn. I cooked it in a 13x9 pan just until set (earlier in the day), and then right before dinner I put it back in the oven for about 5-10 minutes to reheat and served warm. I will definitely use again.

As the other readers suggested, I added eggs, half and half, and sugar.  It was still too breadlike.  Next time, I will cut the Jiffy in half.

I love this recipe! My mom makes a corn pudding and it is ok but it is nothing like this one! The recipe is perfect but I made the corn bread as directed on the box first then I added about 5 to 6 teaspoons of sugar which gave it a sweet taste that was out of this world. i also used Green Giant sweet corn and sweet cream style corn! Fantastic recipe!

This recipe was a perfect base, but needed some extra seasonings.  I added garlic, onion, 1/2 cup cream of chicken, 1/2 cup cream of mushroom, 1 egg, red pepper flakes, sugar, salt and pepper to taste. I sprinkled the top with shredded cheddar cheese. You can really season it anyway you like. 

Made it for the first time on Thanksgiving and it's not even Christmas yet and I have already made it by request three additional times for family and friends.

I tried this for the first time on Thanksgiving.  SO easy and SO delicous!  This will be a staple from now on, seriously, you just can't get any easier than this.  The only change I made was that I used butter instead of margarine, and I used Jiffy Corn Muffin Mix.  Thanks!

This was pretty good. I added an egg to ensure moistness, and cooked for about an hour at 350. Will probably make again.

This was a huge hit at Thanksgiving!!  It took longer than 45 minutes to bake and even then the knife didn't come out clean so I was worried it wasn't done but it was superb!!

I used 2 ears of fresh corn instead of the can of corn and did add an egg. This was very good. Next time I will add pepper (jalapeno, maybe?) and or onion and top with cheddar.

If I could, I would give this recipe 3.5 stars.  I like this recipe.  It's a good side dish for mexican food, or a comfort food type meal (think Thanksgiving dinner, turkey, chicken, etc).  I baked this in an 8x8 glass dish, which made it thick and moist.  However, as much as I like it, it is not a SPECTACULAR recipe, in my opinion.  It's just a good, solid one to have on hand.

I have tried many recipes from this site and I have really enjoyed them.  This one, however, is dry & flavorless.  I would not make this one again.

I make this all the time for my family and they love it!  It's so easy.  This recipe comes out more "gooey" (as opposed to "bready") than some of the other easy ones I've tried.  I like it that way.
