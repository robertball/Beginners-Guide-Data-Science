This is a great, classic 'made from scratch' cake recipe.

Beware cooks searching for a moist cake like that from a boxed mix. This isn't it! This is a more dense, sturdy cake. Almost brownie-like without the sickening sweetness of a brownie.

For Christmas I baked this cake, then layed mini peppermint patties and milk chocolate chips on top right out of the oven. After a few minutes they were melted and I spread them around the top for a marbled mint  chocolate frosting.

This cake was great, however, I cannot give it 5 stars due to incorrect instructions.  The evaporated milk and cocoa powder should be cooked at low heat, so that the cocoa will dissolve without burning the milk.  The frosting should be cooked at low while the cocoa powder dissolves, but then turned to medium high so that it will boil and then thicken.  I stirred the frosting for about 1/2 hour before I just turned it up.  I should have done that about 25 minutes before that.

This is the easiest chocolate cake I have ever made.  It rose so high and was light and delicious. I will use this recipe often.

instead of using condenced and  evaporated milk in the cake mix try using the same amount in butlermilk instead also adding two tablespoons of stong coffee will give it a more chocolatey taste. also if you don't like the frosting try mixing chocolate chips into the batter and dusting the final cake with powdered sugar.

Wow, this was actually really horrible. I made it while my baby was napping to try and satisfy a chocolate craving and I am so sad. It is not good at all. Practically no taste at all... Too bad...

I must say that I was disappointed in the end result. The cake, itself, turned out big and full. But it was not as sweet as I was expecting, partially due to the addition of the cocoa/evap milk that was cooked and added in, but didn't have sugar mixed in with it to begin with.  Also, the frosting tasted like nothing but thick condensed milk.  I may try this again, when I'm looking to experiment a little, and use another reviewer's idea of putting chocolate mints on top of the hot cake and allowing those to melt to make the frosting instead.

OK.. Ive made this again and obviously did something horribly wrong last time! This cake is great BUT how do you make the icing?? I've been stirring endlessly for too long and gave up on it... I have a soupy liquid in the saucepan. Nothing thickened to a paste in any way. Does anyone have any tips of what I can do to save it?? I cut my cake expecting to have frosting for it so not having icing sorta ruins the good cake! :(

I have to admit I was a bit skeptical of this recipe at first as I am a from-the-box baker. But, I was pleasantly surprised. Instead of the frosting recipe, I drizzled some caramel topping over each piece of cake and it was devine.

I am disappointed with this cake. I removed the cake from the pan and frosted it. I cut a piece and took a bite, I chewed so much until I finally was able to swallow. The cake itself did not taste bad but the texture was rubbery. I may try again but I used a lot of time and supplies on this cake.
