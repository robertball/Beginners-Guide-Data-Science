7.19.16   I’ve only made one clafouti (plum) before this one, and the texture on this leans more  heavily toward custard or  eggy.  The recipe doesn’t say to use tart or sweet cherries, but bing cherries were on sale this week, so that’s what I used, as well as throwing in a few Rainier cherries that I had left in the fridge.  Chef John doesn’t tell you in his video to not pit the cherries, but I’d recommend that you do (the first recipe reviewer didn’t).  My cherries were very large, so I cut them in half, placing them cut side down on the custard for a nicer presentation.  This was OK, but I wasn’t wow’d by it, and this simply could be because I’m not a person who goes bonkers over clafouti??  Certainly was simple enough to make.   I garnished with a shake of confectioner’s sugar.

I wanted to try this with some fresh cherries that I had, but saw that it was best warm, so I made half the recipe in a 1.5 qt. dish.  I did not pitt the cherries and used 2 eggs (rather than half an egg) and it was puffed, browned and a knife came out clean at 35 minutes so I pulled it out.  Having never had a Clafouti before, I can't compare it to another, yet I think it is really wonderful.  It is tender with nice crusty edges (until it cools) and not overly sweet. I don't like eating around the cherry pitts but wated to try it.  Next time I think I will pitt them and cut them so that they can be enjoyed in smaller pieces easier.  Overall I think it is a wonderful use of fresh cherries. Thanks.  Fun to try and really enjoyable.  Other recipes recommend serving it with a dusting of powdered sugar.

When I'm going to a potluck, I don't usually try new recipes.  I took a chance with this one though and it got rave reviews.  I made it just like the recipe called for, except that I used a can of Oregon brand sweet cherries and cut them in half.  I'll be making it again!

Simple recipe that's quick to put together.  I used fresh Bing cherries and chose to pit them  (which also took the most time).   With the amount of sugar, I was surprised that it wasn't too sweet.   There was a nice vanilla flavor to the custard.  It would be good for a special breakfast dish too.  I  think next time I might add a little cinnamon, nutmeg or lemon zest to the sugar sprinkle over the cherries. Update.  Have been serving this warm for breakfast. This time I added some nutmeg and cinnamon to the sugar sprinkle .  It made a very yummy breakfast served with bacon.

Made this with tons of ripe blueberries in a pie plate, first used leftover crust from a Gateu Basque (had a disk of it saved in the freezer), and lastly I topped with powdered sugar. I love that French custards are not too sweet! Let's the sweetness of the fruit shine. I also enjoyed it cold like a fruit tart. Thank you sharing the recipe! Will use again :).

I found a jar of sour cherries in my pantry and was looking for a quick recipe to make.  Didn't have enough for a pie, and this recipe sounded good.  I was right!  It is delicious!  Definitely making this again.  Posting a picture.  I couldn't wait more than 5 minutes for it to cool...so one serving is missing! haha!

I have made this dessert many times exactly as it is written. It always draws rave revues. 

Word of caution: do not over bake it. Start checking at 10 minutes for the first baking and then for the second baking at 35 minutes.

I found this rather flavorless & slimy. I halved my pitted cherries. I’m not sure if this cause the cherries to release too much of their juice. The cherries kind of reminded me of grapes in this once they were cooked. Maybe I didn’t use the best kind of fresh cherries. There was only 1 kind available in my grocery store. It was edible but I won’t make it again.

It was awesome and not difficult to make. I used cherries that were getting old. Did not pit them, feel pits add flavoring. Yes it does have custard consistency.
