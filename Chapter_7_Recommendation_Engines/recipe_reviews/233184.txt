Meh, not my favorite...at all.  All I tasted was soy sauce.  No garlic, no ginger, no onion, nothing!  I even used garlic rice vinegar.  Eat everything separate and enjoy them.  This will not make you happy.

Disappointing. Salting slices made for salty slices, not dry ones, as the extracted moisture simply liquefied the salt. The subtle flavor of the faux shellfish (I used lobster) largely drowned by salt here and the soy sauce (I even used low sodium). Very underwhelmed. There may be some subtle trick / technique which would be critical (?), however, I'll leave that to someone else to discover.
