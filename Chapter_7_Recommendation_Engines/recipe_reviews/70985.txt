Interesting!  Chicken with gravy, but with a twist:  spicy heat for a Southwestern kick; Grana cheese for an Italian twist; almonds and avocados for contrasting textures and flavors.  

It really worked.  One person called it "housewifey."  Overall, a unique, creative blend of flavors you might not think would go well together, but they did.  

When I make this again, I will probably go the "healthy" route.  i.e. replace the cream with starchy "thickeners" that may be handy, and sautee with olive or soy oil rather than butter.  To save time, you don't need to sautee chicken until done - you can brown quickly and then let the chicken finish cooking in the assembled dish when it is in the oven.  Also, nothing beats home made chicken broth for extra flavor (defatted, low-sodium).

OK...well this was dinner tonight and it was awesome!  I noted all the advise they other people had tried...I used half and half instead of cream (cut those calories!) Butter substitute...again we are heathly eaters here. Sliced the chicken so its smaller fillets.  I used 3 mushroom mix pre cut in the produce section, gives great flavor rather than just using plan button mushrooms.  Served with a little Motz. cheese on the side (boyfriend loves cheese.  I cut the avacado into chunks and put it on top of the chicken with the mushrooms and put the sauce on top.   Also served with fresh roasted red pepper brown rice.  I would totally serve this again!  Thanks for this recipe!  Its awesome!

This one isn't going to make it into the rotation.  I'd say we're fairly adventerous with our tastes, but nothing about this was really all that special.  It didn't seem like a "casserole" to me really - we served it with pasta to utilize the sauce. The sauce was decent, but kind of ho-hum.  The nuts in the dish didn't really add much other than calories.  The avocados - I like them, but they seemed to get lost in the other flavors.  I found this to be just very average and I won't make it again.

Looking for something differenct, I made this for dinner last night.  It got RAVE reviews!  My husband isn't hard to please, but is very hard to get a 5 star rating from.  He said that this was 5 stars EASILY.  I used less chicken & made more gravy.  Also, lightly salt, peppered & garliced prior to browning - then used less salt in gravy.  Tossed in a couple of dashes of red pepper, as well.
This one is definitely going into our rotation, but I think that when the family is over, I'm going to make it more "casserole-y".  I think I'll cube the chicken, then brown & follow the rest of the recipe like normal. The chunks of chicken in the delicious sauce can be served over a bed of brown rice.

Preeettty good, I didn't have almonds so I crunched up some croutons and had that as my crunch factor, not as healthy but still good. There was just one thing missing in my opinion.. Garlic! I used it to season my chicken as I pan fried it, my mushrooms and a small amount in the sauce as well. I made it over jasmine rice and the turnout was successful. next time i might cook the rice and place that under the chicken to let the drippings do their thing. thanks for the recipe!

This was awesome! Though the gravy was just enough for 4 chicken breasts so I can't imagine it working for the 8 pieces it asked for.

Excellent! The only thing I changed was, after reading other reviews, I only used 4 chicken breast. I agree that it is not enough sauce for 8 breast. Adding this to my go to list. Wonderful taste.

This is a fantastic unusual recipe.  We used a lower fat version by using benicol butter and fat free half and half.  Great flavor and even my 9 year old enjoyed it.

We love this recipe. Made a couple minor changes, substituted yogurt for the cream to cut some calories/fat) and omitted the almonds for personal taste. Thanks for sharing!

I really enjoy this recipe! Its a great twist on traditional chicken with rice dishes that my family likes. I tried it the first time as-is (I usually try a recipe first to give the author the benefit if the doubt). Our family tries to eat pretty healthy so for us the original recipe was too salty, and buttery for our tastes. But other than that I love the idea of making your own cream sauce rather than using Cream of Mushroom and the hot sauce adds an extra kick that is different than Paprika, which I usually use. 

The second time I made the following substitution/ omissions and it turned out great and is a lot healthier for my kiddos:

1. Omitted butter and used just a little olive oil to cook the chicken, sprinkled with italian seasoning & paprika for more flavor. 
2. Substituted whole milk for Cream = Less calories/ cholesterol, etc
3. Omitted salt 
4. Saute mushrooms in the same pan as chicken, using the oil already in the pan instead of adding more butter. Substituted Sweet red wine for Sherry.
5. I cooked a Quinoa & Wild Rice blend and layered the chicken, mushrooms & sauce on top to soak up all the yummy flavor instead of cooking them separate.

This was amazing.  It took me about an hour and a half rather than an hour so I will probably reserve it for making on a weekend next time, but I will DEFINITELY be making this again.  Delicious. Definitely dinner-party worthy.

Wonderful twist on Chicken with white sauce.  Tasted great.  I added a sprinkle of Pico de Gallo seasoning just before serving.  Other than that, followed the directions to a Tee.  Perfect!!

This was a great once in a while meal. I found that it took a tad bit too much butter and will lesson the amount next time. I also used only 4 pieces of chicken and had plenty of left overs. Other than that I used whole wheat flour, onions, garlic, and spicy green peppers. I also did not have sherry but had white cooking wine and it tasted great with that. I will def make this dish again.

My family enjoyed this chicken dish.  I will definitely make it again. I agree with other posts regarding the number of chicken breasts.  I used 4 large breasts and cut them in 1/3 before sautéing.  If you use more chicken there will not be enough sauce. I added more hot sauce and some garlic powder to the sauce. I also added a bit more basil and rosemary. I cooked everything in the same skillet to save time. Just pour the sauce over the chicken and then add mushrooms. I blanched asparagus to serve with the chicken (asparagus goes well with the sauce and mushrooms) plus brown rice/quinoa.

Delicious! Took more than 30 min of prep but I chopped and sautéed an onion too ( and used a tsp canned chopped garlic).used gluten free flour and my gravy wasn't very soupy but yummy all the same. Used pine nuts instead of almonds. The avocados really added the best finishing touch, I would have never done that on my own!

Even though this was more work than I like, I'm adding it to my recipe box. Will make again.

I'm very surprised by the positive reviews as I usually find the reviews on Allrecipes to be helpful/accurate. I followed this recipe to a tee and it turned out incredibly boring and bland. The flavors and textures simply do not match up here.

This was really good. I used milk instead of cream and cut butter in half. I didn't have sherry so used vermouth and a splash of port instead. I used baby portobella mushrooms. I sauteed the mushrooms in the same pan after the chicken and then made the sauce in the same pan after the mushrooms. The flavors came together great. I did season the chicken with salt, pepper and garlic powder while browning. I think next time I might omit the almonds as they didn't add much flavor and the avocado was delish but gets lost in all the other flavors. I served over pasta. I did make extra sauce as others suggested so I had enough to go with the pasta.

Other reviewers were right.  There were too many ingredients in this and the whole dish wasn't great.  It didn't need the avocado or the almonds.  The rest of the ingredients worked though.  I thickened up the leftovers, put it on a bun, and called it a shredded chicken sandwich.

This is surprisingly amazing. The almonds and avocado add a great texture to the chicken! They really do go well. I added a hint of paprika at the end after the avocados too. Turned out to be an excellent surprising great dish.

Awesome rich but not overly casserole, goes great on a bed of brown basmati rice.

Delicious, albeit very rich.   Next time I make this, I will wait till the end to make the cream sauce as it thickened quite a bit while it was sitting and I had to add a lot more chicken broth.   Made this with brown rice and used the sauce to top the rice as well.   YUM.

Delicious! Love the flavors and the fact that there's parmesan cheese in the white sauce. Served it over rice. Will definitely make again.

My husband isn't a huge chicken fan unless it is made a certain way.  He liked this recipe and ate the leftovers too!  I didn't have any sherry, so I used a dry white wine instead.

I am not a fan. The recipe has too many different, strong flavors going on. It also has far too much butter for a recipe that doesn't end up very tasty. There are many excellent recipes on AllRecipes, but I can't count this one among them.

This recipe is scrumptious! There were no leftovers. Due to food sensitivities of family members, I substituted soy creamer for the cream, and left out the almonds. Spectacular!

My whole family lived this recipe!  I have a difficult time finding delicious recipes that DO NOT have onions or tomatoes that affect my fructose malabsorption problem.  This recipe is perfect full of flavor, not missing a thing.  It is labor intensive but worth it!

This is my new favorite chicken dish! Very tasty.  Whole family loved it.  I did make a few minor changes to cut the calories-eliminated the butter except for the sauce. Used half & half and upped the rosemary and basil to 1 teaspoon.
Thanks for a great recipe!

This sauce is amazing!  After sauteing the chicken and putting it in the casserole dish, I put it in the oven.  Then make the mushrooms and add them on top of the chicken and put it back in the oven, then make the sauce.  So you can make everything in one pan on the stove.  (Then I made "Sauteed Kale with Apples" from this site in the same pan.)  I used milk instead of light cream and it was fine because it's cooked with flour.  And as a sherry substitute you can use apple cider vinegar and some sugar.  I would call it a 'bake', not a 'casserole'.  This is going in my regular rotation!

This is a wonderful, comfort food kind of meal.  (Although I question the author's understanding of the word "casserole"!) I made only two changes, one intentional, one accidental.  I halved the amount of flour, because 1/4 cup of flour is way too much for two cups of liquid. I forgot the hot sauce, but we all agreed it did not need it. The taste is sort of a fried chicken cream gravy with an Italian twist.  I bought an avocado and my husband and son both tried it with the avocado(I don't care much for it), but ended up pulling off the avocado and eating it separately.  Both agreed it was out of place and unnecessary to the dish.  Loved the texture and subtle flavor added by the almonds, although in the future, I think I will toast the almonds by themselves and sprinkle on after taking the chicken out of the oven because they don't toast well sitting on top of the sauce. As others have pointed out, just brown the chicken, there is no need to cook it fully before baking it for 30 minutes.  I served it over rice, but mashed potatoes would work well too.  There is not enough sauce for 8 breasts, but there is too much for 4, so I think 6 is what I will try next time.  Absolutely delicious.

I only wanted to use 2 chicken breasts instead of 8, so I cut the recipe down, but still used 1 1/2 cups mushrooms, and made 1/2 of the sauce, which was a good amount.  I think with 8 breasts, it would need more sauce perhaps, Also, I pounded the chicken breasts before I cooked them.
My husband and I loved this and will definitely make it again!!

Did not use the hot sauce because I don't like spicy things, and I seasoned the chicken with garlic, salt, and pepper while browning it. Otherwise, I followed the recipe. It was really good and I will make it again. The almonds gave a nice crunch and the avocado added flavor and color. Very pleasing dish. Next time I will serve it over rice so the sauce has something to soak into.

I made this recipe with no changes, except I substituted toasted walnuts for almonds, because that's what I had.  Although I liked it, I have to say I will not make it again.  There are so many more unique and flavorful recipes for chicken on this site (for my taste).  So, a good meal, but not a "repeater."

Great recipe.  Few changes, reduce the cream by 1/4, replacing it with milk.    I sprinkled the top with some parmesan cheese and grilled the casserole for the last 10 mins which gave it a nice crusty top.  The almonds were spinkled on top of the avo just before serving, will use sesame seeds next time as they'll add more flavour.

When I first tried this recipe, I didn't like it.  But I oddly found myself wanting seconds so I gave it a 4 and not a 3.  Everyone in my family said it has way to much butter/oil.  And to be honest, there was something else that just didn't seem right that I just couldn't put my finger on.  I give it great points for being a change of pace and for good flavor, but still there was something just not right that nagged my husband and me for the entire dinner.
