Overall, we loved the recipe. I made it almost exactly as directed except I used dry spices and guessed on just how much zucchini was in " 3 medium zucchini." (Would have liked to see cup measurement of zucchini instead of "3 medium zucchini" but I'm a relatively experienced cook and I can guesstimate.) It might be helpful for others, though. My son, age 18, doesn't like zucchini - he tried it and he had seconds. Both my husband and son requested that I make it again some time, but suggested more stuffing and more spices. That said, The taste and texture and essence of this recipe were definitely a hit! It reminded me of a light version of eggplant parmesan.

Bravo! I thought I would have left overs to take for lunch the next day. Nope, it vanished before my eyes. This is a winner. Kind of like a vegetable lasagna without the noodles. I didn't have fresh herbs and dried worked great. I used bread crumbs instead of stuffing as well.

I think this recipe is really tasty! If you use the italian flavored diced tomatoes they give a lot of flavor.  I did not have three zucchinis so I used one yellow squash and some broccoli (cooked until tender).  Very good.

OMG this was great!! I just made it for dinner to go along with grilled pork tenderloin.  I had three servings!    I used diced tomatoes that  were already seasoned with oregano, basil and garlic.  I sauted  EXTRA minced garlic with the onion to give it more flavor.  I also used pork stuffing mix to go along with the tenderloin. I used dried spices and added extra, per other reviewers.  WOW, this was soooooooo good!  I will definitely save this receipe for next year!

I made this recipe for a work luncheon and it was absolutely fantastic! I left out the stuffing mix but I did use the Del Monte diced tomatoes with basil and oregano already added in there so I did not have to add my own seasonings.  Everyone wanted the recipe!!!YUM!

Very good... I would even enjoy the vegetable portion (excluding the stuffing mix and cheeses) over hot pasta!  Only thing I changed was to substitue dried herbs for the fresh because I didn't have them... 1 tsp dried basil and 1/2 tsp. dried oregano.

I added a can of drained/rinsed cannoli beans to make this a main dish. I think it fit the bill. I may have used to much of the stuffing and the cheese didn't melt as I was hoping. Overall, I think the recipe was just ok.

I never liked zucchini in the past and wanted to try something new. This was fantastic! I loved the italian flavor and will definately be having this again.

Note....I left out the stuffing to save on carbs and it was an excellent side dish.

The flavors were good and the family liked it. It was difficult to know what constitutes 3 "medium zucchinis" but we managed. I didn't have any stuffing, so I substituted a couple of cups of small seasoned croutons and got good results with them.

Delighted to have another zucchini casserole recipe.   This is good but feel that it needed a little more flavor.   My husband loves black Olives so added about 1/2 cup sliced plus some hot pepper flakes to taste.   Thanks for a nice addition to my files.

guests loved this and it looked great. it's also a great way to sneak in veggies =) After reading some reviews, I added a little bit extra tomatoes and spice for added flavor.

This was tasty. I think it could use more tomatoes, next time. Thanks for the recipe.

I've made this twice to rave reviews.  I actually omitted the mozzarella and I think it was much fresher tasting.  The Parmesan cheese stands out more

This gets 4 stars based on lack of information in the recipe.  Once made with some adjustments, it definitely deserves 5 stars.  First, I used 4 cups of zucchini and lightly salted it before sauteing which removed more moisture.  Next since I did not have fresh spices, I used 1 teaspoon each of basil and oregano.  Then I used italian style diced tomatoes for more flavor.  I served this at a potluck and there were no leftovers.

This was fantastic!! I haven't reviewed anything before but had to for this one.  I've been desperate to find different things for all the zucchini my dad keeps giving me.  I used dried spices as well, and one can regular tomatoes & one can Italian tomatoes (all I had on hand).  I even messed up and didn't cover it for the 1st 10 min, still great!!  Kids loved it (they're big veggie eaters though, just FYI to all parents out there).  I just wish I could eat more of it. :)  Can't wait to try the veggie portion over pasta.

This was a great recipe. For the top crust I had garlic and cheese biscuit mix. So I crumbled that on top and half way through I added water to make it crust up a litte. The second day was better than the first day.

Very good. Not hard to make. Everybody in my house liked it which is rare. They said the house smelt incredible when I was cooking the tomato mixture. I didn't have any garlic salt I use garlic powder (I eyeballed it) and add a little salt. Will definatley make again.

7 31 17 ... AR is messing with my mind.  I reviewed this & only the stars show.  :/  Well, I halfway followed directions - to the point just before stuffing & cheese.  Served over rice.  Good, but easily improved.  Freezing leftovers for soup.
