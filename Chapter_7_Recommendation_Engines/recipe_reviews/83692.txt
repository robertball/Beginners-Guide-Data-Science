This was very good.  I wasn't quite sure about the chinese noodles, whether they should be included raw/dry or cooked first per the instructions on the package.  I opted for raw/dry since the recipe was called "crunchy salad" and I think this was the right choice.  It was very tasty and a nice change of pace from a normal salad with dinner.

I served with Jamaican Jerk Chicken Kabobs and the flavors were a nice complement.
