This is a 5-star recipe all on it's own, but it's a 10-star in my book with the following additions and changes: I added 2 cups of pecan halves and 2 cups of pretzels.  One 14.25 ounce box of Chocolate Chex mix is just over 9 cups so I put the whole box in.  I increased the butter to one stick (or 8 TBS), increased brown sugar to 1 full cup packed plus 1 heaping TBS and increased corn syrup to 4 TBS and a 1/4 plus a little more tsp of the baking soda. It was a little work to mix it all up, but WELL worth it in the end! Left out the chocolate drizzle as this didn't add much to the treats and was quite messy if you pick up a handful to munch. You won't miss it, honest. This has turned into our favorite!

Very sweet, very addicting. I am not a drizzler, so I added the vanilla chips on the last stir before turning it out onto the waxed paper.

Sooo addicting!  I followed the recipe to a T (except we couldn't find white chips, so we deleted it completely).  So, so, so, so good.  You do NOT need the chocolate.  I repeat you don't need the chips!  I think it tastes fantastic without it and would make it messy if you had chocolate drizzle (melting on fingers, etc.)  I agree with a pp who said nuts would be good with this.  As I write this, I am snacking on this mix with some almonds.  Perfect combo of sweet and salty.  Recipe gets brownie points b/c it is all made in the microwave. WooHoo!!!

We've been making this at Christmas time for the past 10 years. Chex used to call it "School Fuel". We leave off the drizzles and bag it as gifts for surprise visitors and the children's friends. Fantastically easy with an addictively sweet crunch.

OK I have to say that I have not personally made this, but my mom has.  It's amazing and completely addicting.  She makes it for me all the time and takes it to group functions.  She's said that it's not too difficult either.  I'd make it myself, but come one, some things are just better with mom's special touch :)  She's made it by drizzling white chocolate, milk chocolate, a combo.  For halloween she didn't drizzle chocolate but she put in colored m&ms.  It's really easy to change things up a little to make it look a little more festive.  But no matter how she makes it, it's always amazing!

Really good!I'm not big on microwaving, so I prepared it like I would do caramel.  I put the butter, sugar, and cornsyrup in a pan over medium low heat until it was melted, then increased the heat to get it bubbling (about med-high).  I let it simmer for about 3 minutes, then stirred in the baking soda, let it simmer for about 15-30 sec more (stirring constantly) and then poured over the cereal.  You have to work fast before it hardens up, or put your mixing bowl with cereal over another bowl of hot water to keep it "loose".  I then drizzled with melted peanut butter chips, and YUM!

This was awesome and totally addicting!  I got so many compliments and I've been asked to bring it back for Christmas.  It's so simple and easy, and now a favorite.  Next time I'm going to try adding peanuts and pretzels for a more salty-sweet snack.

I made this using only rice and corn chex.  Omitted the chocolate/white drizzle, too.  OMG, these were great!  The carmelly coating was not sticky in our hands.  My 7 year old, husband, and I all enjoyed this treat.  Great travel/road trip food.

I love this mix.  It's always a huge hit at parties and everyone asks for the recipe.  The first time I made it the store was out of chocolate chex, so I bought regular.  This worked great!  It was actually better than when I made it with chocolate because that was too sweet.  I also leave out the white chocolate and throw in a couple cups of pretzels and peanuts.  One other trick - let the mix cool completely on wax paper, then when cool, gather the mix in the wax paper and crunch.  It's much less messy and you get perfect bite-sized pieces.

These are good.  The white chips I used got frosting like when I microwaved them.  Not sure how to fix that.  My husband thought peanuts and pretzel sticks would also be good added to this as it needed something salty in the mix.  I would make these again.

Very easy recipe.  I added mixed nuts and m&m's and it was a hit with my teenage daughter's friends.  This is a keeper and I will definitely make it again.

This was great. I agree with someone else that you DO NOT need to use the chocolate chex mix which is more expensive anyway. I used half corn and half rice and actually made 4 batches right away. Excellent! Went great at a party I had.   I used white almond bark melted and drizzled over instead of vanilla chips because this was cheaper too!

Since my oven is not working I decided to try this recipe.  I used mix of wheat,rice and corn chex, mini pretzels and popcorn trying to keep it to 8 cups combined.  I also added slightly crushed peanuts and toffee bits to the mix.  The "carmel" coating wasn't the gooey carmel but a nice light glazed coating almost like a crunchy toffee. I was afraid that cooking the whole mix in the microwave at the end was going to make the mix "soggy" but it held its crunch. Very easy to make. Tastes good too.

Great recipe for a quick sweet snack.  Melt the white chips at 50% power - not high - or they will burn.  Also, you can add pecans or peanuts for an even bigger "bang."  My daughter made this and said she also added minimarshmallows for a different twist.

Super easy!  For those of you who don't like to drizzle, melt your chips/vanilla bark in a freezer ziplock bag at 30 second intervals.  Squeeze the bag after each 30 seconds. Once it is melted (took about 1 minute), snip off a tiny corner and drizzle away.  Soooo much easier!!

This recipe is a keeper -- perfect for holiday gift baking.  I did not use the vanilla chips and added chopped almonds and pretzels.  The first time I made it I did not use pretzels and I found that the sweetness needed something else to balance it.  Once I added in the pretzels, it was perfect!  Very addictive!

I loved the taste of this, but after the first day, it got too chewey.  Maybe next time I will cook it for a little longer or just do as another reviewer did and cook the caramel mixture separately so I know what temp it gets to.  I may add more things next time, too, like some popcorn, pretzels and nuts, but will make again.

I tried this snack over the holidays and brought it to our big family gathering. It was so delicious that it barely made it to the event because everyone was snacking on it at home. My entire family ended up loving it and have told me I have to bring it every year. Thanks Chex for making me look good!

This is so delicious.  I had a really hard time getting white chocolate to melt and drizzle easily.  I suggest just adding M&Ms or white chocolate chips at the end, unless you are more talented than me.  I added a handful of peanuts before the caramel glaze, which was delicious!  If you want this slightly chewy rather than crunchy, add about a tbsp more of corn syrup.

I make this every year at Christmas, but at other times as well.  I don't leave out the white chocolate chips!  It tastes delicious with the white chocolate.  It is a super easy recipe to make and doesn't require a ton of ingredients.

Interestingly, I've never actually used Chocolate Chex with this recipe, but using regular Chex has worked fantastically.  Caramel-coated Chex mix.  Mmmmm.

I made these without the chocolate, turned out good, but maybe a tad less baking soda, could taste it a little when done.

Great as is! Make it one step easier and add the vanilla chips at the last minute of microwaving.

Made this for a Christmas gift and could hardly keep out of it! It is really yummy!  I couldn't find chocolate chex so I used 1/2 corn, 1/2 rice and then drizzled with 1/2 chocolate and 1/2 white chocolate chips.  After I poured over the mixture on the cereal, I spread on a cookie sheet and I baked it for 20 minutes at 200 in the oven as opposed to microwaving the entire mix.  Then I spread on parchment paper and drizzled the melted chocolates.  Great and easy recipe!

This is really good.  I make it each year to give to neighbors for Christmas.   However, I can not find the Chocolate Chex anywhere this year.  So, I used the plain Rice Chex and drizzled white and regular chocolate over the top at the end.  It was still really good.  I also added pretzels.  YUM!

Love it.  Crunchy chex and caramel, yum.  I was making for Christmas treat so added red and green M&M's but put them on after I spread it out on the pan and most of them fell off when I went to break it into bite size pieces. Next time I'm adding a topping I will mix it in before I spread it on the pan.

I sent 10 bags of these to work with my husband for his department supervisors, upon his arrival home I was told that they declared it a drug since they couldn't stop eating it!  Simple and makes a nice gift.

Very good, but I made extra topping to pour over. Make sure you do stir when all is in microwave, I didn't do it, and some are burnt tasting.

I used cinnamon chex instead of chocolate and it was really good. Raisins would be a good addition if using this flavor of chex.

Sounded good...tasted even better. We did omit the vanilla baking chip drizzle, but added M&Ms and cashews. This makes a great tailgate snack!

I used the entire box of cereal. I added 1 cup of vanilla chips and 1 cup of pecans, and stirred them in before microwaving mixture.
This was an easy recipe to make, keep this in mind when you have to stir up something quick for a party or get-together.

This is addicting!

Wonderful recipe!  I followed the recipe completely the first time and was very pleased.  I later modified it to give as Christmas gifts - added M&M's (rather than drizzle), peanuts, Cheerio's, and pretzels.  The result was a wonderfully sweet & salty treat...very addictive!

This is a tastey recipe...very easy to make. The drizzle didn't work out so well so I had to just add white and milk chocolate chips to the mix.

The best snack mix ever!  Took this to a family gathering and the kids and adults loved it.  I noticed that my nephew imparticular kept taking cupfuls back to his seat. So what was left....not much I bagged up and sent home with him.  Of course trhen my oldest daughter asked where's the mix...I said oops!  So be sure tyo double the recipe like I did.  Takes about 1 and 2/3 boxes of cereal to do so.  Then I had milk chocolate chips I also melted and drizzed on the mix with the white chips.  My husband who is not a huge fan of chocoalte was in lovce with this also.  I have ideas already on how to add items to the mix for next year at Christmas time.  But as for now it couldn't be any more perfect as written in the original recipe!!!  5++++++ stars!

Awesome! Just a few tweaks. I added 2 cups chopped pecans And I used 6 cups Chex mix 3 cups wheat Chex Chex 3 cups rice Chex. Next time I’ll use 3 cups choc Chex 3 cups rice Chex. Depending on how powerful your microwave you might want to cut back time to 2 minutes after all mixed together. Couple pieces got too brown.

This stuff is way better than I expected it to be. I actually improvised on this one somewhat. I didn't have chocolate Chex, so I used Corn and Honey Nut (4 c each). Many reviewers mentioned adding something salty, so I threw in some peanuts and broken pretzels. Then I thought about the 1/4 bag of white chocolate chips in the pantry and threw those in, too. And I remembered 2 Hershey bars left over from S'mores, so they were chopped and added to the cereal. Because I added more stuff to the bowl, I increased the caramel ingredients to compensate(1 c brown sugar, 8 Tbls butter, 4 Tbls corn syrup, 1/3 tsp soda). When I read the instructions again and realized it all had to go into the MW for 3 mins, I was concerned about the chocolate I'd added, but it all melted and blended in nicely. I didn't drizzle with anything because I was concerned about the messiness in eating. Finished product is delish and won't last long.

Very yummy and easy! I didn't have chocolate chex so I used corn chex since that's what I had on hand. I did what other viewers said and omitted the white chocolate all together. I did add M&M's at the end to have some chocolate and figured the hard candy coating would help so that it didn't melt and get gooey. It worked out good and was so simple. Next time I want to try this with the chocolate chex. I'm sure it tastes amazing!

I could not find Chocolate Chex anywhere in Tallahassee, FL.  I bought Honey Chex and went with that. Added mini square pretzels and honey roasted peanuts. My brown sugar mixture seemed too thick but I stirred it in. I went with one of the other reviews and used the entire box of cereal with adjustments to the other ingredients. Personally, it was too sweet for me but everyone else who tried it LOVED it, wanted to take some home and a couple of people called back to get the recipe. My granddaughter wants to make it for her teachers for Christmas so, I will make again. I think I'll try adding mini chocolate chips next time, maybe dark chocolate or something to offset the sweetness.

I couldn't find Chocolate Chex, so I used a mixture Cinnamon and Rice chex.  It was still very good.  And it didn't get soggy!  I also added MnM's and mixed nuts.

I have just made this for the first time to serve tonight when we have friends over for gaming night!  Wow...talk about super fast and easy!!!  I did follow recommendations by Kelley and used the whole box, 1 stick of butter, a heaping/packed cup + 1 Tbsp brown sugar, and a 1/4 + 'a little' baking soda.  I threw in 2 cups of pretzel balls (bite sized pretzels we had on hand)to give it that sweet-salty mix.  I decided to do this on the stove top instead and on medium high added the butter, syrup and b sugar and melted...then I turned it to high just for a minute to come to a frothy boil.  I removed it from the heat, turned the heat to low and addded the cereal and pretzels.  When half of the dry ingredients were mixed in I put it back on the stove and continued to add a cup at a time and gently folded it over and over until it was all mixed and lightly coated.  Beginning to end this took MAYBE 10 minutes...was turned out on a sheet pan covered with wax  paper and we were eatting it while still warm!  Will add pecans next time!  and yes there will be many more for this new favorite!
