I cheated and used the last bits of a rotisserie chicken from the grocery deli.  Great quick dinner, especially with a squeeze of lime.

Didn't have bell pepper so I added corn. Anything goes. It was wonderful on top of rice too.

I really love this recipe. Only thing I did different was squeeze lime on top. :)

Made it without the bell peppers and used cumin instead of the cilantro and was still great.

Great meal! Way to cook, very tasty. Combine it with the homemade corn tortillas for a little more fun.
