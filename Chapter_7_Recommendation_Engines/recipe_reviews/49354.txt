I thought this was pretty good.  I have never tried a mango salsa.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This is a real crowd pleaser and always the first to go at our barbeques and pool parties.  I omit the habanero peppers  because the kids donâ€™t like them but it is still fantastic.

With good quality mangoes, this is to die for! I sauteed my onions in a pan instead of heating up the grill.
