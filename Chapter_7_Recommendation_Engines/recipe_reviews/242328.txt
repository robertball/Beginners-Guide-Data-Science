Very good! I used the Chef John's cooking technique, (450 degree oven for 10 min) instead of broiling.  I also added about 1 teas honey to cut the acidity. Excellent recipe! My husband loved it!

This is awesome! I added Italian bread crumbs the last few minutes in the broiler. Man was this super fast and easy. Definitely will make again.

I made this tonite for my husband and I.  To broil the fish until "it flakes easily with a fork" took me closer to 15 minutes in my electric oven.  I was also disappointed by how wet the fish remained.  I keep telling my husband that fish live in water, so you got to expect some water.  I might try this recipe again using haddock because I liked the mayo & seasonings.  The idea of throwing bread crumbs is appealing.

Delicious and oh so easy! I added more garlic because we love it but this may be my easy fish dish.

I would definitely try again with a different fish. Polluck was new to me. I will try swai or halibut next time.

I made this using fresh pollock and it came out great. Easy to make and great tasting. I will make it again.

Very yummy!! I used a thawed package of pollock which included five fillets. I doubled the ingredients (using veganaise instead of mayo) and used extra parmesan to top it off. Everyone liked it including the kids. Will definitely make it again. (Served the fish with mashed potatoes and corn)

Turned out great! Made it with pollock fillets that I had actually frozen and thawed. It was delicious and so easy!

Great recipe with lots of flavor.  I increased the garlic to a whole head and added a little bit of feta to kick it up a notch. This will definitely be added to my regular rotation.

Family liked it but seems to take longer than stated for it to get crispy and it was a bit wet. Apart from that we enjoyed the flavor

NOTE: The bag said the fish can be cooked from frozen but the recipe didn t mention if the pollock had to be frozen or thawed. So I mixed the ingredients and placed on the frozen fillets. They need to be thawed or semi thawed. Fish came out cooked with the exception of about two inches in the middle. I put back in oven for 10 mins at 350 and they came out fantastic.

I made this with swai and it was delightful-- have made several swai recipes from this site and this was by far the best! I tripled the garlic and used lite mayo. Yum! So tasty
