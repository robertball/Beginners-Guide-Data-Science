Great recipe...I used macadamia nuts/roasted instead of almonds.

Absolutely delicious! I am not Jewish, but my daughter's boyfriend is. I was asked to see if I could do some nice options for Passover / Easter dinner. Made this with fresh whipped cream and Gelato, along with the chocolate sauce in the recipe. It was AMAZING! I will do this for any dessert occasion beyond Passover. I did have to take it out 6 minutes early from the oven. I halved the recipe and baked in a stick-free loaf pan. No leftovers. Everyone had seconds!

This was so amazing that my husband called me Betty Crocker and ate the last piece which I was saving for myself (and then asked me when I was making another one).  So decadent and chocolate-y... and perfect for Passover (much better than those Passover cake mixes!)  I used a regular round cake pan.  Melted 12 ounces of chocolate chips and 4 ounces of a Lindt chocolate bar.  Didn't use any nuts or topping.  Yum!!

Easily the best Passover dessert I've had.  I topped it with whipped cream.

Made this for dessert for our gluten-intolerant friend and we all loved it.  Super rich, but very good. I did bake it an extra 10 minutes thinking the knife was supposed to pull out clean, then read more carefully and thought I'd wrecked it, but it was still super fudgy in the middle, so probably could have baked longer even and been fine. ( I personally liked the outer edge best where it had baked more.) I sprinkled it with mini chocolate chips before baking then drizzled slices with warm salted caramel and hot fudge sauce, topped that with coarsely chopped toasted/roasted salted almonds and a swirl of whip cream.  Yum! (A good quality vanilla ice cream would have hit the spot, too!)  One tip...I would beat the egg whites/ sugar first and then do the melted chocolate/ yolks.  By the time I got my whites whipped to peaks, my chocolate had started to cool and thicken, making the folding really tricky. I never got "fully incorporated, smooth and fluffy," but thankfully, it still seemed to bake ok, so that was a blessing!

We had this last night for the first night of Passover. Huge hit! Will definitely make it again (I didn't add the topping and it was still wonderful).

Best flourless chocolate cake ever. Used whipped butter to make it a little lighter.  Serious improvement over the Passover desserts of my youth.
