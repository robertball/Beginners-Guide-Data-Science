This recipe is excellent if you DON'T cook it for 5 HOURS. I cooked a 9 pound turkey breast using this recipe but using the following cooking directions and it came out very juicy and delicious: 
Roast in the preheated oven for 3 hours; or until an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the breast, not touching bone, reads 165 degrees F. Baste turkey with pan drippings and let stand 10-15 minutes before carving.

I used a half turkey breast with bone weighing about 3 pounds (Trader Joe's), so I adjusted the sauce accordingly.  I didn't have the heart to flip the breast over halfway through because it would have soaked off all the wonderful herbs on the top of the turkey---I just added a little more to the sauce at that point.  I think the cooking time was off because I would not cook turkey to 180 degrees, but rather the new time of around 165.  This would  be a good way to fix a little more turkey at Thanksgiving time without doing a whole bird.  If you were going to serve this with mashed potatoes, you would perhaps want to have a little more of the gravy!  Thanks for a nice meal!

I had my doubts about 5 hours of cook time and was I ever right.  I took it out after 4 hours and it fell off the bone.  I am not going to have to worry about de-boning it!  It was also quite dry.  I am sorry I didn't check the internal temperature after 3 hours max.

Followed it almost exactly, didn't have bullion, and used herbs de provence. Instead of melting the butter, I just creamed it with the herbs and stuffed it under the skin. Also, took off the cover during the last 30 minutes to get some color on the skin.

I had a 4.5 lb turkey breast, and cooked covered for 1.5 hours, and another half hour uncovered and it was perfect.  Also, I didnt turn it over, didnt see a need.

ABSOLUTELY the BEST turkey recipe!!  I've tried several since my hubs is a turkey connoisseur.  The only changes were: I had a 6.5 lb turkey breast, I used a whole stick of butter, I had no savory- so I used: 1/4 tsp fennel seed, 1/2 tsp of celery salt, 1/2 tsp pepper.   in 3.5 hours it was falling apart and super tender.

Roasted an 8lb turkey breast bone in using this recipe. It was moist and delicious. I do like to brine my turkeys, breast or whole, for at least 12 hours.  Using my 9 lb round LeCreuset dutch oven was much simpler than the roasting pan method. I didn't turn my turkey over. Roasted it in 350 degree oven for 3 hours than took my Reynolds off that I used to tent the turkey breast for 1 hour to get the great golden color. Wish I would have taken a picture because it was beautiful. Will repeat this one again.

I had a meat injector that I’ve been wanting to try. Melted the butter added the spices, (well I didn’t have any Savory so missed that one) injected away like a pro. Placed the breast in my slow cooker on high for 4 hrs. And it received raved reviews from my family!  The leftovers are tender an delicious. And a turkey pot

A 9 lb breast in a cast iron dutch oven. everything as written, except it was done in 3 hours, not 5. Turkey came out falling off the bone and was moist and tender.

Will make again, but now know that I don't need as much time.

This is a great recipe but as stated by others  5 hours of roasting is way too much. Three hours proved quite sufficient. The drippings make a flavorful gravy. This one is definitely a keeper for our family.

I had a 7 lb turkey breast and followed the directions, greased the turkey with canola oil, not butter, but mixed butter with the herbs and after about 90 minutes put some of the herbs and butter under the skin. A little later I used the remaining herbs and butter to coat the turkey. I paid close attention to my temperature gauge inside the turkey. It came out well and the recipe is nice and easy.  I can't remember how long it roasted, just as long as it took to reach the proper temperature. Also the gravy was good.

Made this tonight, smelled like Thanksgiving!  Used Turkey stock instead of chicken broth, added a thinly sliced habanero pepper to the butter mixture, 9 lb bone in breast, roasted covered in a Dutch oven 3 hours at 350 and it was perfect!  Stuffing, gravy, fresh zucchini and yellow squash sautéed in a little water!!  Yum :)

The only thing I changed was to reduce the butter to 3 TBS. I baked about 3 hours and used the meat thermometer. This one is a keeper!

We enjoyed this. I had a two pound single breast so I cooked it for a 1/2 hour covered and a 1/2 hour uncovered. I think that it would have been better to add the herbs to unmelted butter as the butter would baste the breast as it melts.

Didn't cook for 5 hours, did 3 like everyone else.  There is nothing special about this recipe.  Maybe I was expecting more from the reviews.
