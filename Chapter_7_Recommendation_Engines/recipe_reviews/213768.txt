Brownie, these were excellent.  Very similar to my Grandma's rolls - the ones she'd make without a recipe she made them so often :)  The only change I made was to use buttermilk instead of the milk.  It added the nice tang.  I also used half butter, half shortening (butter flavored Crisco) and they turned out lovely with a nice crumb, tender and soft.  Also, I left my dough very sticky.. a bit less flour, so reserve that last 1/3 cup to add a couple tablespoons at a time at the end of the mixing cycle in my Kitchenaid and gave it a 5 minute knead.  It helps to lighten them a bit. I didn't make them cloverleaf style, but rather made 12 rolls in a 13x9 pan.  Brushed them with a bit of melted butter after baking and yikes.. they were gone in a flash!  Thank you for sharing - this is definitely a keeper.

I only gave this 3 stars because although they were good when just out of the oven, they go hard quickly and for the time needed I would make my regular bun recipe.

I have never made dinner rolls before so I found this one to start with.  I have made these about 5 times now and they are so good! Just a tip, i grease the bowl with a cooking spray and then once the dough is in the bowl, i spray the dough with the spray too- then I am not trying to turn it over.  The dough will rise bigger if put in an especially warm place in the kitchen- I use the stove top on one of the rings near the one used for heating the milk. Great recipe!

Made these today to accompany Split Pea and Ham soup. They were super easy to make and were a huge hit! Next time I will use less sugar and will lower the oven temp. I am working with a new oven and haven't discovered its' lil quirks as of yet.

The rolls turned out delicious, however next time I'm going to add more sugar.  I kneaded the dough instead of simply stirring it, and I placed the dough in a bowl on a warm stove, so the rise time was reduced to one hour for the first rise, and less than an hour while the rolls were in the pan.  Also, they baked for only 10 minutes at 400 degrees. The pic of the rolls on a glass plate are mine.

I loved them! I used butter in the bowl, and they were the perfect texture. I will be making them during the holiday season.

I have tried 2 other recipes (that were pretty good) but this 3rd one, grandma's clover leaf rolls, is the best. They turned out perfect.  You know it's good when your 7 & 8 year old grandsons love 'em.

I almost gave them a five its very close. I used Kerry Gold Irish butter and one tablespoon of Crisco oil for my batch. I also allowed my rolls to rise covered on a warm deck twice. The rolls were light and absolutely delicious!

Let in for 15 minutes and burned the bottoms by overfilling the oven with three muffin pans full.  About half came out great and the other half were overdone.  Eveyrone ate them anyway and said they were great.  Check after 12 minutes.

I made this recipe, with a few modifications, for the first time on Thanksgiving.  It was just my immediate family (and I had a roll of crescents for back up!) so I figured why not experiment.  They turned out great and I will use again I am sure.  We are a wheat bread family, but I have always wanted a soft white dinner roll recipe for special meals.  (I may experiment with wheat flour for everyday rolls sometime.)  I put the warm water and yeast in the bowl of my bread machine to proof.  I then scalded the milk in a small sauce pan, dissolved the sugar, salt and butter (instead of shortening) and added this mixture to the machine.  I added 1 tsp of vanilla to the recipe for sweetness and used 3.5 cups of A/P flour instead of 3 1/3.  I set the machine on dough setting for 1.5 pound loaf size. My machine took just under 2 hours to complete, and the dough came out perfectly, no mess or worry about rising.  My 5 year old daughter and I then made 1.5 inch balls and placed in two round cake pans that I lightly buttered, close but not touching.  Each pan held 10 rolls.  I covered with a towel and let rise for appx. 1 hour until they doubled in size, filled the pan and were touching side by side.  I baked at 400 for 15 minutes then brushed the tops with butter.  They were really wonderful and great addition to the table (and leftovers!).  I realize this is a big deviation from the recipe, but for those of you who want to simplify things with a bread machine, I hope this helps.

I've been looking for a good dinner roll recipe for a while and tried these with good results. The texture of these rolls is like a super fresh store bought hamburger bun, and the flavor is wonderful (I added a little extra sugar). I thought the dough had a nice consistency, rose well, and was pretty easy to work with. I prefer a little coarser texture to the crumb, and next time, I may reduce the flour and some of the shortening to try for a little drier texture. Otherwise, very similar to my "grandma's" dinner rolls, which we all know, are to die for.
