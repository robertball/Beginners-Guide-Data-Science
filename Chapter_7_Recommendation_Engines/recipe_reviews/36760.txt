This is a good "light" version of tabbouleh.  I recommend using only 2/3 cup of parsley, though.  I truly love lots of herbs, but there was too much parsley even for me!  I also recommend using only 1 cup boiling water on the bulgur.  That way the bulgur soaks up all the water and no straining is necessary.

Very yummy. It has a fresh Medditerranian taste, and is great for a hot night. It takes a while to chill, but is well worth the effort. I also found that two tbsp parsley is enough.

Very good tabbouleh recipe! Gave some to my friend (who'd never had it before), she and her hubby raved about it and asked for the recipe. My only change was to add 1/2 of a seeded and chopped cucumber. And this really should be eaten within a day or two as it will tend to get soggy. Thanks!

This is a great recipe. I've made it twice in the past week. But instead of using boiled water, I've just done what the Bulgar bag suggests and use a 1 to 1 proportion of bulgar to hot water. Ex. I use 1 cup of bulgar and pour 1 cup of water (or just a little more) over the bulgar and let it sit for an hour. It turns out perfectly. And as far as I'm concerned, the more parsley and mint the better. At 150 calories for 1.25 cups, it's a wonderfully healthy meal.
