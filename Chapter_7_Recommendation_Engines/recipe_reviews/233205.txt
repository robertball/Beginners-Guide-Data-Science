This has a nice chili flavor, and it would be a great alternative to beef chili.  Cannellini beans or Great Northern beans would be good in this, too.  Use uncooked rice in the stew if you want a thicker consistency.

This is just delicious and so easy, too. If, like me, stew is sometimes too thick and almost gummy for you, you will like this recipe. Before putting over the rice, it is almost soup-like unless you really cook it down for a long time. But soldier on and put it over the rice and it is perfect! The level of spice in the Herdez (R) Roasted Pasilla Chile Mexican Cooking sauce is perfect. Spicy enough to taste but not overpowering so the flavor of the  other ingredients come through on their own. You can always, like this recipe does, add more chilies and other seasonings to adjust the heat to your own taste. Since most packages of corn tortillas contain more than the 4 called for in this recipe, cut the remaining ones in strips or triangles and bake until crisp to add as toppings. Thank you Jennifer for a great recipe and thank you Herdez for a really great line of cooking sauces. I will surely be using them in the future!

Great flavor. Once you add hot sauce, lime juice, and cheese it's wonderful! This is a great recipe if your wanting chicken stew.

This recipe came out pretty good. My sauce did not thicken up so it was more like a soup than a stew. I was nervous about adding the corn tortillas when I did but no worries. It did need salt for my taste buds. I shared it with my neighbors and they have requested the recipe! Thanks for a great recipe!!!

This was a huge hit in my house.  The only thing I did differently was omit the Cannellini beans because I forgot to prepare them ahead of time.  I already knew I liked the Pasilla sauce but the rest of the ingredients just worked perfectly with it, producing a spicy stew with a level of heat even the children liked.  This will make repeated appearances on my dinner table.  Thanks, Jennifer !
