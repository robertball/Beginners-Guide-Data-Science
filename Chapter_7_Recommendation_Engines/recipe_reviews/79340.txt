This recipe was too dry for my tastes.  I am more accustomed to cobblers where the fruit filling includes sugar and makes a saucy fruit base.  The overall result of this recipe is more like a coffee cake.

Sorry to say - but I would definitely not make this again!  The recipe called for 60-70 min to bake - checked in 50 min and the top was way too done. Also dissapointed in the cake part - had no flavor and wasn't moist. I am going to try and salvage the apple portion.

I was intrigued by the method of this recipe and decided to try it out.  Very nice, and so easy!  I didn't have evaporated milk so I used half-and-half instead.  The cake browned very golden and inside was very soft, light, moist and pancake-like. If "cobbler" might be a misnomer, think of it as something like an apple upside-down cake.  The only change I'll make next time is the honey drizzled over the apples-- I'm not the biggest fan of honey, so next time I'm going to replace the honey over the apples with maple syrup or date syrup.

Outstanding!! Only thing I did was cover it with tinfoil 30 minutes into the total cooking time...turned out PERFECT!
