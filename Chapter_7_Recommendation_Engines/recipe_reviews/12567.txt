This pie just won me 1st prize in a pie bake-off with 50 other pies.  Turned out great on my first try.  Very easy to make and set up nicely.  I used a few variations: add some spice with dashes of cinnamon and nutmeg; use dark chocolate chips for more intensity; and coffee liquore instead of bourbon.  I know these variations may make it less "traditional" but this recipe overall is a genuine 1st Place Winner.  Thanks, Judi!

This, although tasty, isn't quite what I consider to be a traditional Derby Pie.  Derby Pie is a little more moist and fudgy than this lighter version. (Almost a brownie texture)  Walnuts are traditional, but I think pecans would have been better.  (Just a matter of taste.)  Keep it authentic and use a small-batch Kentucky Bourbon.  (I used Woodford Reserve.)  Make sure you serve warm with a scoop of vanilla bean.  Enjoy...and make sure to wear your flashy hat!

I have made this countless times. Added vanilla extract as well as quite a bit more bourbon. Also, used a whole package of chocolate chips. Made this the day before for a friend's birthday. Also, makes great tarts.

This recipe is great! I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I find it very hard to tell when it's done so sometimes it's over/under-done. The only ingredient alteration I make is adding a little extra bourbon and vanilla. After everyone loved the pie, I made these in bar form for a picnic: they turned out GREAT!  For a 9x9 pan, I used 1.5 times the recipe.  One circular pie crust still covers the bottom of the pan - I cut off the excess crust about 1/4" up the sides. Baked for 30-35 minutes. COOL COMPLETELY before you cut them into squares.  Next time, I'll double the recipe and use a 9x13 pan.

Quite good, but not traditional, though it stands on it's own nicely.  I used brown sugar for more depth in the pie and felt the walnuts were too strong of a nut for this recipe.  Next time I'll use pecans and more bourbon as the taste was lost in this recipe.  If you're looking for something quick and easy, this dessert could do in a pinch quite nicely.  Thank you Judi!

This recipe was great. I had been looking for this recipe for a while. The only thing I will do differently next time is add vanilla to the mixture.

I made this pie for my husband who is a chocolate chip cookie hound.  He loved it!  The only change I will make when I make it tomorrow for the Race is that I will substitute brown sugar for the granulated.  A personal choice, as the granulated sugar alone seemed a bit lacking in "oomph".  Otherwise, a luscious and decadent treat!

From a girl who was born and raised in Louisville, KY, this a darn good rendition of a Derby favorite :) I've tried quite a few Derby Pie recipes and for how simple this is and how good it tastes, this is my new favorite! I don't do alcohol in my recipes, but I did add some pure vanilla as suggested. This was a HIT with family and friends and, most importantly, with me!

This recipe is wonderful and very easy!  This pie is better than the same pie at a very exclusive restaurant in our town.  I'd recommend making two and taking one to a friend!!!

This pie is absolutely one of my favorites.  I have had something similar in local steak
restaraunt but this tops it. I shouldn't give the kid friendly rating because we kept this
one to ourselves.  (Told the kids it had yukky stuff in it) Thanks for the recipe!

What a great recipe. This improved on my mom's family recipe that she taught me years ago. I stuck with some of my own stuff though for some items: 1. used 1 teaspoon vanilla and no bourbon. 2. I used 1 egg yolk instead of 2 eggs for a more gooey pie. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Very good recipe - I used pecans instead of walnuts, and I found that in my (gas) oven it took about 45 minutes to bake. I actually made two of these pies, one using vanilla instead of bourbon, and discovered that both tasted equally good. Thanks for the recipe - it's definitely a keeper!

Goodness - where has this recipe been hiding?  I absolutely love how easy and delicious this is.  I agree with others - this is a great chocolate chip cookie pie and MUST be served warm from the oven with whipped cream or ice cream.

Let me preface my review by saying I have never had a Kentucky Derby Pie before. Therefore, I have nothing to compare this to or to know whether or not it is authentic.  I also subbed vanilla for the bourbon since I was sending this to school for a social studies project on US regions. With that said, I thought it was very good! Like other reviewers said, it is reminiscient of a big chocolate chip cookie.  Especially good warm.

Overall not bad, but I would recommend adding at least 1/2 cup bourbon because it gets lost in the chocolate.

Delicious, though not what I anticipated.  I thought it would be similar to a pecan pie, but it is more like a deep dish chocolate chip cookie.  I baked one for Thanksgiving day and another one the following day since I had ingrediants.  I used Southern Comfort instead of Bourbon and it was just fine. I put 2 tablespoons in the second one and it did not alter the consistency.  I are with a few dollops of  cool whip.  This is a keeper! Fast and delicious!

This was very good, although I wish it would have had a bit more pecan-pie texture and taste to it.  I think I might try brown sugar next time.

It doesn't get any easier than this. It tasted like a giant chocolate chip, nut cookie! It was really good. We served it at room temp but I think next time I will try to plan on it still being slightly warm when served. Thanks for sharing!

This pie was very good, but I wanted a little stronger bourbon flavor. I would probably double the amount of bourbon in the pie next time I make it.

Ever since I first made this as part of our Kentucky Derby celebration, I cannot stop making it. It was a huge hit, my family requests it constantly! What makes this so great is it is as easy to make as it is yummy. I use a whole cup of chips instead of the 3/4 indicated.

This was great!  I made it exactly to the recipe and the only change I will make next time (yes, there will definitely be a next time) is to add more bourbon for a stronger taste.  I also might try a different liquor in the future!

This is a great pie! I added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla and was generous with the walnuts, plus I doubled the chocolate chips (all bc I was using a 9 inch shell), but that was just my preference! I was wonderful as is! Thanks, Judi! This is a keeper! You made my Derby Party dessert a hit!

I followed the recipe exactly, but it didn't stand out as a keeper for me. Sorry.

This is a great recipe - I made it for my inlaws over the Holidays and they loved it.  I also used more Bourbon and Vanilla. This is a super easy dessert that tastes like it took forever - a keeper for us.

What a wonderful treat and great addition to our Kentucky Derby Party. I only thing I would suggest is to be sure to serve this pie with some ice cream or Cool Whip. Thanks for sharing. YUM!

This is a great Kentucky Derby Pie. I did halve the Bourbon and it still had plenty of Bourbon flavor. Thanks for the recipe!

Well this was delicious. My one caveat, don't do like I did and store the pie in the fridge until ready to serve. It gets hard as a rock when it's cold! Warmed back up, it was phenomenal. Lesson learned, next time it stays on the counter until I need it.

Ok, I guess it was my fault for not reading the whole recipe.....but, at the top of the recipe it says bake 1 hour. at the bottom it says bake 30 - 40 minutes? Didnt read all the way through. Checked it at 45 and looked done so I took it out. WAY over done. So, don't go by the baking time posted at the top of the recipe!

It was really good.  I did take others advice and added a bit more bourbon and used brown sugar not white.  
I will increase the chocolate chips next time (just a bit).

This was really easy to make, but it wasn't very good.  It set up and looked like the photo, but it just wasn't very good.

We used 1 cup chocolate chips, and 1 cup of sugar, also 2 tablespoons of bourbon.
We will cut the extra sugar next time back to 3/4 cups.

I made this the day before, for my ''Derby'' party..It's very easy to put together and tastes yummy.. I made my own pie crust..I added 1 teaspoon Vanilla Extract instead of adding Bourbon.. I cooled & sliced the pie and put each piece in the microwave for about 30-35 seconds and topped it with Cool-Whip! This will definitely be a ''treat'' at every Derby Party from now on!! I got a lot of RAVES, and one lady wanted the recipe.. Everyone said it was like a warm chocolate chip cookie, & FANTASTIC ... Thanks Judi!

UPDATE:  I have one friend that loves this pie & asks if I made it each time she comes for dinner!!  It's my favorite ''Go-To'' pie, even for Birthday Parties!!  8/21/16

Liked this, didn't LOVE it. Super easy though! Wish I had had this warm from the oven, might have loved it more, but made ahead of time due to needing the oven for other things. Anyway, put homemade vanilla ice cream on this. Of course, it was yummy, just didn't blow me away enough to want to make again. :-( Made exactly as stated, by the way.

I made this last night. It was easy enough, which is the good part. All the chocolate chips did not completely melt. It just does not have the consistency or a real, or regular, chocolate pie. I did not use the bourbon because I dont like the flavor of alcohol. The flavor was good though.
I recommend taking the extra time and melting baking chocolate instead of using chips. I did not try this with this recipe though.

This was delicious.  I followed the advice of some other reviewers and added 1 tsp of vanilla.  I only used 2 tsp. of bourbon, because I didn't have much, and felt this was sufficient.  Thanks for the recipe, I will definitely make this again!

This pie was delicious and very easy to make.  It was quite rich though, so be prepared with some whipped cream or ice cream.  It baked up beautifully with a nice crust of cooked sugar on top.  It was a perfect end for our Thanksgiving dinner (celebrated a bit early)!

I can't believe it has been over ten years since I last made this!  Remembered it and made it tonight.  So delicious.    Original review:  this is good and easy, but really rich, so cut SMALL pieces
