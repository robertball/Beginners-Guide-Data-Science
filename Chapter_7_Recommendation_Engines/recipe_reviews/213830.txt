Of all the soda bread recipes I've tried , this is by far the best ! I made this for my cafe's St. Paddy's Day luncheon, and the reviews were RAVE !  It even brought tears to one older Irish gent who procliamed " It tasted exactly like his childhood..." Bank on this recipe !

This was delicious. I followed the recipe exactly. Yes, the dough is wet, but no you do NOT need to add more flour. Just "knead" it with the spoon if you don't want to get your hands sticky. I needed to shorten the baking time, so I divided the dough into 12 greased muffin cups. It worked great. PLUS it made more of the yummy, crispy edges. We LOVED this and will make it often!!

Really great and simple recipe.  Recommended cook time is too long.  I cooked mine for about 25 minutes and it was perfect.  Will use this again.

I made this bread tonight with some potato soup and my husband and I both LOVED it!  We ate almost the entire loaf just between the two of us.  We saved a little bit just so we could see what it would taste like cold.  I agree with the other reviewers, the bake time is way too long.  I cooked it about 25-30 minutes and it came out perfect!  Also, instead of kneeding it on a floured surface and making a round loaf, I put it in a bread pan and it turned out fantastic!  To the person who said it was a wet lumpy dough, that's how it was for me too.  I didn't add any more four and just baked it and it turned out great!  I'll definitely be making this again!

Fabulous! Note to others - this batter is sticky only if you don't stop adding the milk as directed. Add only enough until the dry ingredients hold together. I have found that means that I don't use about 2TBL of the milk/vinegar mixture.

My husband and I love this bread. I originally made it because I needed a bread for dinner and didn't have time for one to rise. The sticky dough is exactly how a real soda bread should be. I've made the milk/vinegar mixture only add up to 1 cup, and then added 2 TBSP melted butter. Also, if I double it I usually add just a little more salt and sugar. Fabulous recipe though, I always get compliments on it!

Made this bread today, It was really good. I did follow the advice of another review post with only baking for 30 min. I'm eating some while I'm writing this :). I think I might like it either a bit more sweet or a bit on the salty side. Maybe add some fruit. We loved it!

Amazing!! I was looking for a go to Irish Soda Bread recipe, this is above and beyond what I was looking for.  Honestly, I was not a huge fan of soda bread, but my husband likes it. After he tried it he said it was the best soda bread he had ever had.   I have tried a few recipes in the past this is the only one I will make again and again.

This is a very easy, very tasty, very authentic soda bread recipe.  I agree with other reviewers who said that the baking time is too long.  I baked mine for 30 minutes and it turned out beautifully.  This is a sticky dough, so I try to handle as little as possible.  I just mix it with a stand mixer and scrape the dough out directly onto the baking sheet, making a roughly mound shaped lump.  Then I sprinkle a little flour on the top, pat the dough into a reasonably neat rounded shape and slash an X in the top.

This was my first experiment with soda bread.
It came out delicious! I made it to go with the Potato soup! (Ultimate potato soup by THUMPER74137) A chorus of Mmm's were the only sound at dinner that night! Thanks!

Baking time recommended is too long.  I baked for 30 minutes or so and it was perfect.  Allow to cool somewhat for easier slicing.  The taste is a bit like a buttermilk biscuit, but no shortening so does not have a biscuit texture.  Crispy on the outside, somewhat dense and soft on the inside.  The kids enjoyed it and it was gone quickly

This is so quick and easy. I made a loaf for St. Patrick's Day supper, and two days later my 11 year-old son made another loaf. It's that simple. I used buttermilk in place of the milk and vinegar since I had some I needed to use up. I'll be making this again and again!

Very good, quick and easy bread, follow recipe excatly, except don't bake as long 30 minutes is enough time, I brushed it with some butter on top after 25 minutes of baking, and then baked for an additional five, just to get the crust golden.

Delish! And super easy! I added 2 tablespoons melted butter for extra buttery taste. The dough was extremely moist, but no need to add extra flour. It bakes just fine and might get too dry if you add flour.

This is the real deal!! I made this with lamb stew. I originally had a box mix that I made. I had a funny feeling I should make another, just in case. So glad I did. The box mix was, quite frankly, . It tasted awful. This is so easy anyway, its a waste of money to buy a mix for flour, baking soda, salt and sugar... This was delicious. Tasted just like what my grandmother used to make, and she was Irish through and through. 

Only changes I made were to reduce bake time to 30 minutes and brush butter on the top at the last 5 minutes.

After making as written and baking for the stated time, I find it hard to review how the bread tastes as it comes out way overcooked and rubbery.  Very disappointed, and not sure I care to try again.

This was sooo good--and so easy. I made it to go with soup and the bread was done first. I kept picking at it, waiting on the soup because it was just so good. I think you could add herbs if you wanted something different (not sure how traditional that would be), but you don't need to. I'm going to try adding rosemary next time.

I just baked this today and this is very good stuff! I did add an extra TBSP of sugar just because we like a slightly sweeter bread. Dough was very wet, and I only baked this for 35 minutes. I think 30 would have been enough though. This was so easy! I might try adding raisins to this and maybe a touch more sugar next time just for fun and experimenting!

Excellent Recipe, been using it for years.  I do update it a bit with caraway seeds and currants or raisins.  But excellent crumb, easy to modify with other seeds and additions while sticking to the basic recipe.  Thanks everyone for your input.

Great Bread! I originally made if for St Patrick's Day and now I make it all of the time because it is so easy! Only about 10 minutes of prep and you have fresh bread for dinner. I changed the cooking time to only 40 minutes and it is perfect. I also do 1 cup whole wheat flour to make it a little healthier. 
 FYI, it is also a very wet dough but that is what makes it so moist. Great for any occasion!

Simple and authentic, and best of all very easy to throw together quickly with ingredients that are on hand.  I actually used real buttermilk rather than the milk/vinegar substitution, but I'm sure the substitution works fine.  I also only baked for about 30 min (and did three loaves on the cookie sheet) and got the perfect level of done-ness.  This recipe is great and tastes like bread I ate as an exchange student in Ireland years ago.

We liked this a lot. Good simple bread. It's easier to just throw it into a bread pan and bake instead of shaping it into a loaf. It's really wet and hard to shape. (I've tried it both ways)

A decent bread. I wasn't too thrilled with the taste, but my family prefered this over the whole wheat soda bread I made. I just loved the Irish Wheaten Bread recipe, but this one had no flavor. I baked it for about 25 minutes and it came out flat. I either flattened the bread out too much, or more baking soda is needed. If I make this again, I will use whole wheat flour.

omg Brennan! Thank you so much! This was the BEST Irish soda bread I've ever tasted and the true original, like you said, straight from the Emerald Isle! Delicious!  I ate half the round I made and am about to start a second. I baked it for 35 minutes instead of 45 but that is the ONLY change I made. I love the fact that the recipe uses the trusted and true milk and vinegar combination. So many people think buttermilk is the same, but it isn't. Not when it comes to true Irish soda bread. Making at least 3 more of these rounds so I can freeze them. A wonderful bread to keep on hand, as the cost of standard loaves continues to rise. Thanks again!

So yummy!  I will make this often.  I only baked it for 30 minutes and had to add a little extra flour because the original dough was really wet.

OK First of all, I rated this 5 star even though the 45 min baking time is way too much.  30 mins is perfect.  I have got to say that this bread was the easiest bread I've ever made and it is "da bomb diggity"! I should have made a lot more on St. Patty's Day!  I'll be making this all the time. When its a hit with my teenage grandkids, I know its good.  A total keeper, this one is.  What I did to make the easiest clean up ever is that after washing my hands well, of course, I just left everything in the bowl and kneaded it with my hands. Plopped it on my greased pan and stuck it in the oven for 30 mins. A cup of buttermilk works instead of the milk and vinegar. The milk and vinegar mixture is actually the substitute for buttermilk. My mama taught me that years n years ago. OH YEAH!

I make this all the time now. However, I bake it for less than the time stated because it gets done a lot sooner than the time indicated.  How anyone can knead the sticky dough on a floured surface is beyond my understanding.  I just plop it in a greased bowl and bake. Turns out perfect!

This was sooo easy & sooo good! Much easier AND tastier than another Irish soda bread I tried. I halved the recipe & made a very small loaf which I cooked on toaster setting in a buttered pie tin in my not-so-good/about-to-be-exchanged convection oven. I served it with "True Bangers and Mash with Onion Gravy" recipe here. Cut the loaf in quarters. Hard crust & very soft center. A perfect accompaniment to the dish. I will definitely make this easy & yummy recipe again! I'd like to make it & have it with jam or marmalade. NOT just for breakfast, though!

Wonderful & simple.  My only adjustment was that I used a cup of buttermilk vs. the milk and vinegar combination suggested in recipe.  I also would recommend going with a high-gluten flour instead of standard all-purpose flour - it gives it more body.  Will definitely make again.

Excellent. Didn't do anything different and it was wonderful. Mixing it up, I thought, "This is going to be a giant [American style] biscuit. Not so, it was a wonderful bread. My only lesson learned was that I didn't cut my X deep enough. But the loaf in the oven now is just right. Can't wait until supper! Thank you for this great, authentic recipe.

This was great, I only had cider vinegar and it worked fine.  Mixed it in the Kitchen Aide, and baked it on pizza stone. Dough was very sticky..  I was very unsure it it would bake up properly but I figured with so few ingredients I had nothing to loose. Don't change a thing. It was tender and a bit sweet, not too sweet. Best I have made yet. Will make this again for more than just a St. Patrick's Day dinner.

Just made this for St Patricks's day and instead of milk and vinegar used buttermilk (need a little more) like my mother in law Hannah used to make on griddle.  My husband loved it and I just made 2 more for tonight for the grandchildren coming over.

This turned out great. I've doubled the recipe to make 2 loaves or lots of "biscuits" I like that it doesn't call for added fats like shortening or lard.

Wonderful recipe. Added 2 tablespoons of  vinegar to an empty measuring cup and filled the rest with milk. It was the perfect amount of liquid for the recipe.  Also, the other reviewers are correct.  30 minutes is a more accurate baking time.

This was just delicious.  I added 2 T. melted butter and a smidge more sugar.  It had a wonderful flavor and went great with Split Pea soup with ham.  Will definitely make again.

I was out of bread and didn't feel like running to the store. And in general I don't like the store bought pap in the plastic bag anyhow, so I was looking for a recipe that didn't involve hours of letting the dough rise and I found this.
I followed the instructions, only didn't scour the loaf deep enough, a problem I usually have when making bread, but other than that it came out perfect and absolutely yummy.
I especially love the nice, deep, crispy-chewy crust.

I've made Irish Soda Bread since 1992. It's versatile, crunchy on the outside soft on the inside, fun and gratifying to create. I added dried apricots this time.  I enjoyed this particular recipe. Yum! Satisfying. Thanks!!

This is my new favorite soda bread recipe. My husband and I had it last night with some creamy onion soup--so delicious! In the future though I might cut down the salt just a tiny bit. He thought the salt level was perfect, but I prefer just a little less. Thanks for sharing this!

This was really good but very very sticky dough. Probably the stickiest dough I have ever used. It was almost impossible to knead but at least it picked up a bit of the flour from the surface. There was no way for me to make an X on the top. But alas it came out really good and for so few ingredients it's definitely a keeper. The baking time was definitely off for me and it was done in about 20 mins.

I wish I didn't listen to all the reviews and had instead baked it for the full 40 minutes.  I baked it for 30 and it was still doughy inside.  Next time I will follow the original recipe.

For the record, I used soy milk, as I always do in baking.

Incredibly easy. Once you read the reviews you realize the dough is suppose to be sticky and the cook  time should be somewhere between 25-30 mins.

I followed the recipe except used real buttermilk. I took the bread out of the oven after 30 min as some suggested and was tempted into cutting into it right away. Center was not cooked, so i put it back in the oven (turned off) and let it sit in the residual heat for 5 min. Then, I let it cool on the sheet for 10 mins. It was gone 10 minutes after that! Yummy! The dough *is* soft. I used my stand mixer with the dough hook and used just the hook to mix and kneed the dough. It took about 2 min for everything to come together. Use damp hands to help shape the dough on the sheet. Oh, and I used a silpat instead of greasing the baking sheet. This is MUCH better than another soda bread I tried last week!

Solid. Very easy to make. Moist. Very subtle flavor. One where spread is highlight. I did love the crunch of the crust. Like a baguette as for crunchy crust factor. Mildly sweet.

Tremendous recipe exactly as written.  Makes a fantastic corned beef sandwich.  My husband asked me to make it again as buns so he could use one with a hamburger.    Yes it's sticky but it works perfectly and is so delicious it's worth a few sticky fingers.

YUM!  I baked it in a loaf pan and spread an egg white on top.  I reduced the cooking time (as others suggested) to about 34 minutes.  My kids ate it all and asked or more!  I just vigorously stirred it with a spoon for 30 seconds without adding additional flour.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!

I'm not too familiar with soda bread, so I don't know how authentic this one tastes.  But I can tell you that it is one good bread.  Slightly sweet, crusty on the outside and soft but dense inside.  Everyone loved it, and I am looking forward to using it for corned beef sandwiches.  Made exactly as written.  I was concerned that the dough seemed wet, but I stuck with it and kneaded a little more, and the dough turned out very nice.

Very easy and delicious. Like all the reviews I read, 30 minutes worked better than 45. I used a cup of buttermilk instead of the milk/vinegar concoction.

So good. I have tried many soda bread recipes & haven't found one I liked until now. Since printing this recipe a week ago I have already made this 3 times, it's that good.

I've been on this site for years and this is my first review. I feel so strongly about this recipe I had to say something. Im not a strong cook and the idea of making bread from scratch scared the heck out of me. I made 6 loaves of this in one evening. I made the first one and my family loved it so much I had to make more for them to take home. I didn't change a thing about the recipe. I make this for all occasions.

This is the one. Simple . Easy. Dress it up or down. I topped mine with a coarse sugar crust to turn it into a dessert, but you could just as easily add savory herbs. Next time I'll make two. Three teenagers demolished a single loaf in just a few seconds. If the dough is too sticky, knead more flour into it. That's how dough works, folks. Watch for done-ness at about 30 minutes. My oven usually takes about 10 minutes longer than instructed, and this time it took 5 minutes less.  "Golden" is the color you want it; any darker and your crust is going to be tough.

I was struck by Jeff Mowatt’s review that said an Irishman had tears in his eyes after tasting this.  Figured it had to be good!  And it is.  Didn’t make any changes and my husband greeted me this morning saying, “Wait until you try the bread toasted.”  Next time I will put in a few raisins and maybe a bit of cinnamon.

This was a good, easy to make 4 star recipe but needed a little more to make it a great 5 star recipe.  I made 1-1/2 times recipe since as written wasn't enough for 8 people to have two slices each (i.e.; 3 cups flour, 1-1/2 cups buttermilk, 3/4 tsp baking soda, 3/4 tsp salt etc).  I added a total of 4 tbsps of sugar and a 1/2 cup of raisins.  45 minute cook time was too much even with 1-1/2 times the recipe, only took 35 minutes.

This is a simple and quick, very delicious recipe. I had better luck baking it for 20 minutes rather than the 45 listed in the directions. Even with that much less time the crust was still chewy/crunchy perfection.

This was the first time making and eating irish bread. Very nice surprise. I served this with beef stew. I found it tasted absolutely amazing with some butter. I will definitely make this again. I love that it was so simple. I am rating this 4 stars though instead of 5 because it was just right baked for 30 min, as other reviewers suggested. 40 min would have been over done.

Made this on St. Patrick's Day and it was delish! Not too heavy like soda bread can be. Will make it with other meals; not just with corned beef.

I made this a few times now and I can tell you right now it's exactly how my grandma made it and it tastes phenomenal!!! I've did a little experimenting with this recipe and have added Caramelized onions to the dough and holy goodness it tastes great. I put the curdled milk in the pan to retrieve all the flavours also! Amazing

Best one I've ever made! I also pulled it out around 35 mins in, as my oven is pretty hot.  Even my picky hubby liked it.  Not dry at all but fluffy inside and crispy outside.  Might try it with whole wheat flour next time and see how that works.

I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of taking it out of the oven after 30 minutes.  I did not add extra flour, even though the dough was really sticky and could not hold a round shape.  The result was a rubbery textured bread that did not have a great flavor.

Excellent option for a yeast-free bread.   Made no modifications.  Reduced baking time to 40 min - and changed from top to bottom shelf half-way through for a more even crust.

Bake time was much too long. My oven usually takes longer but at 45 min my loaf burned. Cutting off the burned bottom it still tastes really good. The dough is sticky but handled it very little with flour.  Added a box of raisins. It was great. I will make it again for sure.

Delicious!  I followed the directions but based on some of the recommendations I added an extra tablespoon of sugar, 2 teaspoons of caraway seeds and half a cup of currents.  I baked for 30 minutes. It was absolutely delicious warm with butter.

If you follow the recipe exactly, as I did, the dough comes out too thin. I rescued it by following the Amazingly Easy Irish Soda Bread recipe. I added 2 C of flour, 1/2 C of  margarine or butter and 1 egg to the batter. This came out fine. 

In the future I will add 1/2 C of the vinegar and milk mixture and slowly add any additional vinegar and milk mixture  until it forms a batter that can be kneaded.

I've made this bread 3 times and the amount of milk I used was different each time. Just add 3/4 of it and mix and then add more if needed.  It's really yummy bread and I will make it many more times.

I added a couple cups of applesauce instead of sugar.  Then added flour to make dough stiff enough for bread!  I also tripled the recipe.  This goes fast here.  It needed the 45 minutes.  I also used tin loaf pans.  Turned out great

Easy recipe as written, except cooking time should be reduced to about 30 minutes. I made this for company and it was a great hit. I will certainly make this again!

Great recipe!! The dough does come out very sticky. but will work once turned out onto well floured surface. I decreased cook time to 25 min or so. 45 is too long and would've burned it.

We’re making a trip to Ireland soon, and am anxious to try 
‘real’ Irish made Soda Breads ...   Aside from the name, this recipe sounds the most authentic, super easy and should be really great tasting ...   I will update upon return (with a ‘taste base’ for comparison) and again after making my own Texas version  ... eat well y’all !!

I had to add additional flour, but other than that, this is a quick and easy and quite delicious bread! I also use powdered buttermilk so that makes it easier as well.

Made this for St Patrick's day dinner. Not sure what was needed. I followed the recipe and it turned out hard on the outside and doughy on the inside.  I went back and tried again with the same results. Not sure if it is because I am at a higher altitude, but it was another disaster even after reducing the baking time.

Quick bread, tasty, as a word of warning go light on the flour on the outside and try 30m I'm the oven.

Has a biscuit consistency. Next time I'll try honey instead of sugar.

I made it for a brunch meeting and added two T. Mediterranean seasoning as I was sauteeing the vegetables, added some fresh asparagus I had and also cut the sour cream in half, but added some leftover Boursin cheese which gave some more flavor. Served with sour cream and fresh salsa toppings, it was a hit!

It was very good. Because this a none yeast bread it does not rise very much and tends to be more dense, however, my italian wife who prefers “airier” breads, loves this heavy but moist bread. Its a little wet and sticky when you make it. Don’t add extra flour, just what you turned it out on to form it up. I bake ours on a preheated cast iron skillet dusted with corn meal. Awesome! Sliced with butter, is great for breakfast or tea.

I've tried a few soda bread recipes and this one is head and shoulders above the rest. Easy to make, no fancy ingredients, and super yummy! I will admit, I add more flour to the recipe as I kneed the dough. It's too sticky otherwise. But I try to not add too much and dry the dough out.

Tried it last night with a pot roast.  It was fast and easy to make. We ate the whole thing.  We liked it so much that I doubled the recipe and made it again this morning!  Great as French Toast as well as Grilled Cheese.  I love Sourdough, but living in South Florida has made it difficult to keep a good starter.  This Soda Bread recipe may be  a great substitute without the hassle and inconsistency of my sourdough.  If you can afford to spend a few cents in ingredients and 45 minutes of your life, I highly recommend trying this recipe.

This was so sticky there was no way I could take a knife to cut it.  I had removed from pan twice adding about a cup more of flour.  In the oven now but not sure how it will turn out as since I added more flour maybe I should have added more sugar, salt, and soda.  I will update once done.

This bread is so easy and really good, if you want a crusty loaf of bread to go with soup or dinner this is a good easy bread to make.

Love this recipe!  I doubled it and added 1 more tbsp of sugar and it came out perfectly!  I make at least once or twice a month and my son loves it when I do.

I found that I get a better product if I absolutely make sure that milk sits for at least 10 minutes, that I double the soda & salt and change the bake time to 45 minutes at 350 F.

I converted this to be gluten free as I have celiac disease.  I used 1 C rice flour, 1 C tapioca, and added 1.5 teaspoons of xanthan gum.  I also used a little more salt and a little less sugar. I normally make soda bread when I am too lazy to go buy yeast. This is not the recipe I normally use for soda bread but decided to try this one.  It came out very crusty and good.

I have an electric oven, so I put a pan of water on the bottom shelf for moistness.  I also baked the bread in a cast iron skillet. Maybe because it was GF, I had to bake it the full 45 minutes.  It came out dense, but delicious.  I had to exercise self control and not eat the whole loaf.

I've been searching for true soda bread and after trying countless recipes for "Irish Soda Bread" which are sweet, almost like scones, I almost gave up until I came across this one.  This is what you eat for dinner.  So simple, so easy to make and so good.  Makes boiled potatoes and salt a really good dinner. Thank you for sharing  a bit of Erin with the world.

Made it, following the recipe.  Will watch the timing more closely next time, and stop adding liquid according to the directions.  We enjoyed it even though it was a bit heavy.  Plan to use it more and more often as a quick, yummy addition to easy meals and company.

I doubled it and cooked it in two bread pans for 30 minutes. It was so simple and so good. We will be making this many more times. My English husband was so pleased with it.  So tired of seeing people put raisins in soda bread. 15 years in England and have never seen this once, anywhere.  He has family living in Ireland and been many times and has never seen it there either.

I have been looking for a crusty soda bread and have had a difficult time finding the right recipe. This is everything I wanted. Really delicious. And I  think it's a good thing I made two loaves because I just might eat one by myself.  I'm living overseas and can't always get bread. This was one of those days.  I don't want to knead and play with yeast.  And tea bread tastes good but not all that different from a muffin.  
But this fills my craving for bread . Thank you for bringing me some home in the Caribbean.  Five stars, no changes.

Mine turned out hard as a brick and never got brown.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Maybe it needed some kind of shortening?

Super quick & easy. Turned out great! Followed another reviewer's suggestion to knead in the bowl & saved myself a mess. Also didn't use all of milk mixture, just what was needed for dough consistency. Makes a rather small loaf.

My kids loved this.  I did decrease the time to 25 min at 400.  The outside was golden brown, inside a little on the moist side.  Tasted fine and not soggy the next day.  I think I will try 375 for 25 to 30 next.

one of the easiest recipes I've ever made I would either add more flour or less milk and don't bake as long as the recipe says bake it for 20 minutes it was completely done

Absolutely delicious.  Did not change a thing but I did bake it in my cast iron skillet.  DH and a neighbor that we had over for dinner, LOVED it.  She even ask for the recipe.  So simple, yet amazing texture!

Great and easy recipe! I’m making my 2nd loaf of the day the family loved it so much! The first time I used a non-stick sheet to make and bread was done in 25/30 minutes. The second time I used a regular cookie sheet and bake time was 30 minutes. Thank you for wonderful recipe!

I used buttermilk only because I had it.  I'm sure the soured milk would be just as good.  Followed the rest of the recipe.  Took about 40 min. in my oven.  I chose this recipe as it makes a smaller loaf than some of the others.  I will continue to make as it was wonderful!  Simple and delicious!

I have been making this recipe for my family for a while.  We love it, always have.  I suggest turning the oven to 375 and cooking for the same amount of time.  We found that it's pretty hard and crusty and difficult to cut when cooked at 400.

I made it as  directed the first time however only needed to bake half of the recommended time because it was really browning at 20 minutes. Which turned out to be enough time.  I was a little concerned with the consistency of the dough which was stickier then I had anticipated.  The second time however I added an extra half cup of flour and kept a little to the side for use if it got to sticky then baked for the 20 min.  Now it's a big hit and my family loves it.  Next time I will try doubling the recipe because it says it serves 8 but i have a family of 5 and we each got practically a tease of the bread.

Just finished having corned beef and cabbage with this Irish Soda Bread. This was delicious! I doubled the recipe with the exception of the sugar. Only added the 1 tablespoon. What flavor! Moist  inside with a beautiful crust. Only baked for 30 minutes. My dough was on the sticky side which I feel made the bread stay moist. Will use this recipe again and again.

We all loved it . I made it tonight. No leftovers for sure. I did not have milk on hand but did have half and half so tried it instead and it turned out fine. Will follow the recipe exactly next time. Wonderful texture and flavor, easy to make. Thanks for the recipe. I have tried others before with not such great results and I am a bread baker .

This was wonderful.  My husband loved it. I used part home-ground Prairie Gold flour.  I did not need all the milk called for.   Wonderful hard crust and soft inside.   I will be baking this again.

I followed the directions.  I used buttermilk.  I added it GRADUALLY. Using a large rubber spatula I folded it all in until it formed a nice round ball.  Then I put on a plastic disposable glove and kneaded it.  Not at all sticky.  Then I put it on a greased cookie sheet and patted it a couple of times, cut two deep grooves, and brushed a little buttermilk on top.  Thirty minutes later I had this beautiful loaf, so I went back and filled the same mixing bowl and did it again. Now I have two beautiful loaves.  A million thanks.

Did two, first one didn’t last! Cooked the second one 5 minutes longer, as the first one was a little under done. The reviews were right, 30 minutes is just about right. Will definitely make this again!

Fresh bread is the best, but this is easy and quick. I will be making this more often. I had all ingredients on hand except vinegar, I subbed with fresh lemon juice which worked great. I also added whole wheat flour to it as the dough was extremely wet. Brought it to a nice consistency with delicious flavor.

Teachers wanted to make bread for Kansas birthday week. Wanted an easy as possible recipe and there are a lot of people in Kansas with Irish ancestry! This was easy for 1st graders to handle. It is sticky so they need to put a lot of flour on their hands. We have aluminum tart pans and divided each by 6 and they each had their own bread. Kids really enjoyed it!

I have made this twice. The first time I put fresh spinach and chives in the bread, and followed the baking instructions. This time I followed recommendations about the milk, and only added 3/4 C. I also used bread flour, instead of AP, and some dry seasonings for added flavor. I also lowered the oven temp to 325° and baked it in a cast iron pan.
I really do enjoy this easy and tasty recipe, and I will continue experimenting with flavors!

Super easy, fast and delicious go-to bread. I definitely agree on shortening the baking time closer to 30 min.   Be sure to make the sour milk mixture at least 10 minutes before mixing with the flour mixture as it definitely makes a big difference in the taste.  If I do use the entire amount of sour milk, I sometimes add extra flour (tsp at a time)to the right doughy consistency  and it's always  perfect! If you have more than a few guests, I suggest doubling the recipe, it goes fast!  Enjoy !

This came out delicious.  No need to knead the dough.  I doubled the recipe, stirred with a spatula, and put it into a cast iron pan.  Easy peasy.  Soooo good!

This bread is wonderful and I will make it more often than once a year.  I only had fat free skim milk so I put a heaping tablespoon of low fat sour cream in the cup of milk and mixed well.  Then I added the vinegar.  I divided the dough in half and scooped the dough onto a prepared pan.  I floured my hands and shaped the dough.  Ate it the next day, excellent texture and flavor.

I made two different soda breads for St Patrick's and this one was by far the easiest. It is a bit smaller so cooks faster (agree with others that 30 minutes is good) but tastes great, and I will be making it more often (as strongly requested in my house).

This didn't work out as well for me. Followed the recipe exactly. It was very wet and hard to shape into anything so I just place into a greased loaf pan. It didn't have much taste. Many reviewers said to bake for less time, so I did, 30 mins. It was pale but done so I'm glad I took it out. The bottom crust seemed tough to cut and the bread didn't have much flavor. Thankfully I had made apple butter or it might have sat there without being eaten. I wouldn't make it again.

I've made this several times and it's wonderful! The only change was cooking time. The first time it came out a bit dry. My oven I think is hotter than it says so I cooked this for 28 minutes the second time I made it and it was perfect! The 3 rd time I made it I put it in a cast iron skillet to cook in the oven again for 28 minutes. Worked great! This is so easy to make! Just make sure you measure everything correctly.

I decided to use buttermilk instead of curddling the mike and added grated cheddar cheese.  It only took 30 mins to cook.  I made the first batch by just adding the milk and mixing the second batch was better when I slowly added the milk and stopped adding as soon ad the loaf stuck together.  Using the dryer dough made for better bread.

Bravo, Brennan! This was a HUGE hit at my house for St. Patrick's Day -- so much so, that I had made two loaves yesterday and am making two more today!  I made a couple tweaks to the original recipe: I added raisins and increased the sugar to 3 Tbsp. Per popular reviewer suggestion, I also baked the bread for 25 minutes, which produced beautiful, rustic loaves. Fantastically easy and delicious, this recipe will repeated in my kitchen!

Excellent and very easy. I've been making Soda Bread for years but decided to try this one as it looked so easy. It was much better than my old standard and infinitely better than the kind you buy in the supermarket. 
Only change is that I brushed the crust before and after baking with a little mixture of melted butter and milk. Great crust. Family told me to make this kind again... and I will.

This was so simple to make, was just fantastic. Did not change a thing, just added one extra Tablespoon of sugar. Baked in iron skillet, as others suggested bake for 30 minutes.  Plan to make it often, makes excellent toast as well, so good any time just not for St. Patrick's Day.

I made this recipe twice, one for my family and one to give away for St. Patrick's Day. The only change I made was using actual buttermilk instead of soured milk. The first time I made it I used the one cup of milk, and the dough was very bread-dough like. The second time I made it, I added a little extra of the buttermilk since many reviewers said it should be sticky.  The second loaf was the one my family ate, and it was amazing. Soft, chewy, tender texture.  I hope the first loaf turned out the same!

I pretty much followed the recipe exactly and got phenomenal results. The only deviation I really made was to use my mixer with bread hooks rather than knead by hand. I did take note in Step 3 not to add too much of the soured milk -- just until it came together. I ended up with about 1/4 cup of the soured milk left over. As others have said, it doesn't seem to require the whole bake time; mine only took 22 or 23 minutes. Also, not sure if it matters, but I ended up letting the milk and vinegar stand longer than 10 minutes -- about 20 minutes. I didn't worry too much about shaping a perfect round on the baking sheet and it still rose nicely and looked/tasted great coming out of the oven. I love bread and I love this recipe. It's actually kind of got me wondering why we go out to buy bread at all.

This is the first time I made this, so I have nothing to compare it to!  I added some currants. I don't know....maybe I don't like bread like this.

It was delicious! I've never had soda bread before so I don't know how it's supposed to taste. It tastes a lot like a pretzel (especially warm out of the oven) which makes sense because of the baking soda. 

I mixed it all with a spoon and really never touched it except lightly when transferring it to the baking pan. It was all wet and lumpy, but I didn't add any more flour. I was tempted to add some even just for forming the loaf, but I resisted the urge. I'm glad because otherwise it might have made the bread too dry or tough. 
I also brushed it with butter for the last five minutes of baking. It was very delicious and I will make again, especially since it is very quick.  If you can serve it immediately after it's done, I think the flavor is at its best. 

I think this would make a wonderful loaf for sandwiches too.

I whipped up this recipe up last minute  to go with a stew.  It turned out great, though, I kind of over baked it.  I will do this recipe again and watch it closer next time.

This was terrific, as is. I also made a loaf with buttermilk. Nice, very good. Husband says this is our new "Daily Bread". Easy enough to do it every day, as well.

Wow!! Id give this 5 stars if id used white vinegar but sadly I only had apple cider vinegar.  I dont think it changed the taste much.  It was so tasty!  I shortened the cook time to 25 min like other reviews and it was a nice golden brown. Otherwise followed all the directions. Im not a great baker but i will make again

This is a very authentic, delicious recipe. Without raisins and much sugar, this is the ideal soda bread, and it is easy to make. I should have reviewed this a while ago, as this recipe has been a staple of our family meals for quite some time now. Very good.

I was a little skeptical when I was putting it together but WOW! It came out super delicious! I did as others and baked for 30 minutes - made no other changes. I'm going to follow the lead of the other reviewer who used the muffin cups - Irish soda bread muffins and marmalade are going to be the hit of my next brunch!

Made it in honor of St Paddy's Day and it was delish! I didn't read the reviews ahead but I took it out at 40 min and next time I'll do 35. Very simple with terrific results. I did add two tablespoons of sugar. Thanx!

The final texture was rubbery and the crust very tough. The dough was also quite sticky to work with. It didn't hold it's shape at all, I should have chosen to put it in a pan.

This is basically a giant biscuit, and so the dough should NOT be kneaded. It's too wet for that anyway. Just pour it into a greased round cake pan, and don't worry about cutting a cross. 20 min. was enough time. The texture is slightly chewy, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.

I love this recipe! So easy and inexpensive and wonderful texture and flavor. I've used all purpose flour and other times whole wheat. Both are really good as a treat or part of a meal. I can hear my Irish ancestors cheering!

Delicious. Served with homemade potato soup and the whole family loved it. Our family of 3 made quick work of it so you might need to make a second loaf to have enough go around. Made as exactly as stated but only needed to bake for 30 minutes rather than 45. I think that might just be my oven though but I'm glad I checked it when I did. It was perfect.

I made this bread because I didn't have buttermilk--this recipe called for milk with vinegar !I followed the directions , but I added a bit of green food coloring (for St. Patrick's Day).  Everyone raved about the texture of the bread.  It was delicious with fresh butter.  I'm making another loaf today and I'll also baste it with melted butter and sprinkle some sesame seeds on top or maybe poppy seeds.  Great bread---a little messy to make, but it's worth the time and effort !  !!!

I followed the recipe and added a handful of dried blueberries - I baked for 30 minutes based on previous reviews. Delicious. 
Other reviews said to not use a floured surface for kneading, but I did b/c the dough was so wet - next time I will still use a floured surface but use less flour for a crispier crust.

i found out i didn't care for it personally. But it really is a pretty bread and tastes exactly like i tried at a very nice restaurant.

This was ok.  Maybe it's supposed to taste bland, but I wasn't impressed.

Loved it! 1/2 an hour in a cast iron pan. Knead 3-4 times only. I just took this out of the oven 20 minutes ago and I'm heading back in to make more!  Better than biscuits with less than 5 minutes prep time and fewer dishes!

I used buttermilk because I have buttermilk. Next batch will be sour milk!

This is the best recipe I've found. 25-30 minutes is the best baking time, and if I'm adding raisins I'll add and extra 1/2 tbsp or so to make it a tad sweeter.

Used buttermilk, but otherwise made as written.  Hard chewy crust and doughy interior.  Served with Guiness Corned Beef and Irish Champ, which were very good.  Sorry, not sure what went wrong.

This makes a small loaf that was just enough for three people with St Patricks day dinner but was excellent. Travis and Austin loved it. Only needed to cook for 30 minutes.

I made this very easy bread to go with my corned beef and cabbage on St. Patrick's Day! The only thing I would do is maybe use a milk or egg wash on the top because it looks pretty dry. The inside was not too dry though. It was my first time making Irish Soda Bread so I was pretty happy with the results. I will make it again for sure!

This soda bread was so easy to make and tasted very, very good.  Yes the dough is very sticky, but if you do not want to get your hands dirty then stay out of the kitchen.  This bread is so tasty we will be having it next week with an irish stew.

Absolutely loved this recipe! I used buttermilk and replaced 1 cup of the flour for whole wheat flour and it came out perfect. Crunchy outside and soft inside. So easy that I will certainly make it again. Thank you!

I baked mine 30 minutes because of other reviewer's suggestions, but it was still doughy in the middle. Wish I'd followed the recipe and baked it for 45. But I think if cooked the proper time it would be delicious.

I made this bread with less milk because it was so wet.  Still incredibly sticky.  I made two loaves and, after baking for 30 minutes (and it was nice and brown)
