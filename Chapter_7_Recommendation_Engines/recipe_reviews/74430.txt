One of my favorite sandwiches to make for lunch for my husband and I.  I have also tried out a few alternatives that are equally delicious. I always use good season's italian salad dressing mix and use balsamic for the vinegar part and olive oil for the oil part and drizzle over the inside of the bread instead of dipping.  The added seasoning and the olive oil/balsamic give it such a great flavor.   I have added a slice of provolone which adds wonderful flavor.  I have added roasted red peppers instead of tomatoes and grilled chicken.   I have also used all kinds of diff breads but we like the italian or harder crusted breads best.  The original recipe and all the diff ways I make this are all 5 stars!  You can't go wrong.

Wonderful sandwich that's quick, easy and delicious! I toasted the bread, salted the tomatoes and added a little cracked black pepper. I also added some roasted red peppers. I added a bit of olive oil to the balsamic /red peper flake mixture and drizzled that over everything before closing the sandwich. I cut in into sections and wow - excellent without a ton of effort!

Looks & tastes gourmet, but is so easy!  I used unflavored dental floss to easily slice the cheese - just wrap around and pull tight as it slices.  I used store bought herbed foccacia bread and toasted in the oven to crisp it up.  Just broke off pieces of bread for rustic look. Prepared tomato, cheese and basil on a platter and drizzled with vinegar and left it marinate until I was ready to used it in about an hour.  Great for summer lunch for guests!

I had this on whole wheat bagel bread today for lunch and it was spectacular!

Some notes:
- Cut the basil leaves, not chop, but whole leaves tend to pull right out with each bite.
- I drizzled the oil and vinegar on the bread, layered on the tomato, basil and mozzarella then drizzled some more and then toasted lightly.
- Next time I will lightly toast the bread first too!

It's a perfect lunch for work, I have everything pre-sliced in baggies in the fridge ready to be made in the toaster oven at work tomorrow!

This is a favorite of mine.  It's healthy, delicous, and takes minutes to prepare.  It's best with crusty Italian bread and Roma tomatoes.  Fresh mozzarella is a must.  Rather than dipping, I usually sprinkle the balsamic vinegar on the inside of the bread just before assembling.

My daughter specifically requested this sandwich for lunch. Because she was taking it to school, I sprinkled the balsamic right onto the bread. She couldn't have been more thrilled and asked for it again the following day. Thanks so much!

This is a perfect summer sandwich! If I am having friends over I will buy a large muffaletta and make a gigantic sandwich and then cut it into wedges. A quick and easy way to feed a crowd.

Simple, but we made it more of a meal. We roasted red peppers & red onion on the grill, then when almost ready, added mozzarella cheese. Per reviews we dipped in red wine vinegar. I'm going to add portabello mushrooms next time & just put a little roasted red pepper dressing or raspberry vinaigrette on hoagie or hard bun. I liked this much more than my husband.

Very nice way to use the summer tomotoes.  Quick and easy to make for a crowd.  I used Newman's Own Balsamic Vinaigrette with the sandwich.  It is quite delicious.  Thanks for the recipe

I thought this was good... Used red wine vinegar instead of the balsamic, and just drizzled it over the sandwich.

Very good! I used two 100 calorie english muffins for this and it worked out perfectly for hubby and I since they're round and the same size as tomato slices! I also love balsamic so it was a great version for me! I might try it with italian dressing next time and also broil it to melt the cheese. Yum, Yum!!

There are so many options for this sandwich but my favorite is to use a loaf of french bread & slice it to the desired length for your sandwich. Next, tear out the middle of the bread (the soft part), sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese, chopped tomatoes and chopped basil on one side. Then, sprinkle red pepper flakes on the sandwich. Close the sandwich and press together. Finally, heat in a pan on the stove to warm the inside and make the bread crusty. Delicious.

Not bad. I think the key is the bread....don't overdo it with too big of a roll. Also, a little olive oil or lowfat mayonnaise would make it better

So fresh and yummy! I would make it on toasted bread or those sandwich rounds worked perfectly as well.  I would drizzle the vinegar mixture on the bread to let it soak in. No dipping needed this way!

This was a pretty good sandwich. One I would have again. One thing I want to say is don't make the mistake I made by just drizziling the balsamic directly on the sandwich. By the time I got to the second half it was a bit soggy. Dipping (as the recipe states) is the way to go.

Very good.  I just drizzled some balsamic vinegar on the sandwich itself instead of using it as a dipping sauce.  I, for one, love balsamic on everything so it doesn't bother me to have balsamic on this sandwich.  I also put the sandwich on a multi grain baguette.  So simple yet so delicious!  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent sandwich. I had just some ciabatta rolls and didn't use red pepper flakes as I don't care for it. I followed others' suggestions to add a little olive oil (EVOO) to the vinegar and just put on the sandwich itself rather than dipping. Toasted it as was suggested, too. Will eat this again! It was a 4.5 really for me.

This is a great for a simple, fresh tasting lunch.  I drizzled the balsamic over the bread and the tomatoes rather than using it as a dip, and I just chopped the basil.  Next time I think I'll try toasting the bread a bit.  Thanks for a great vegetarian lunch option!

So good and easy! I think this combo is one of my favorite sandwiches to date. I'm not a huge fan of vinegar but the red pepper flakes sounded really tasty. Unfortunately, we were out of vinegar so instead I just spread Italian dressing on the inside of the bread like a sauce. I also toasted mine for a bit in a toaster oven. It was amazingly delicious!! I'll have to try it with the vinegar next time.

This was delicious and absolutely screams summer! I had a ciabatta roll that needed to be used, so I used that and I lightly toasted it under the broiler. Instead of making the dipping sauce. I just splashed some basalmic right onto the sandwich and sprinkled with the pepper flakes....SO GOOD! I can't wait to make this with garden fresh tomatoes! Thanks for sharing. :)

The original recipe was great, but to add a little extra, I added 1 very thin slice of prosciutto and some oregano.  Put it on a crispy italian hero bread with a side of marinated mushrooms.  Makes a great summer dinner.

This was great!  We used basil and tomatoes from the garden and fresh bread from the bread machine.  Didn't even need to melt the cheese to make this sandwich wonderful!  I will be making it often.

How could something so simple be so spectacular?  I used foccacia bread sliced down the middle for the bread.  Toasted it first on the grill and then made the sandwich on half of them and broiled to cheese melted.  OMG good!

This is a favorite in our house. I use the Buffala Mozzarella, it is made from the milk of the Water Buffalo and so much more creamier than made from cows milk. More expensive but worth it. I call this sandwich Caprese salad sandwich. Yum!

Pretty good sandwich.  Didn't change a lot of things but I did mix the balsamic vinegar with about 1/4 c olive oil and then brushed it on some broiled Italian slices.  Sprinkled the bread heavily with Italian spices.

Very Yummy. I put mine on a french style hamburger roll since I had some left over. Toasted the bread and spread the balsamic vinegar right on the bread. I left out the red pepper flakes since I'm a wuss. Very refreshing!

AMAZING!  And surprisingly filling...even my 6"1' husband was satisfied with two sandwiches.  I used Focaccia because it is so flavorful and I toasted the bread in the pan with a drizzle of olive oil.  And instead of dipping in the balsamic, I drizzled it inside the sandwich...sooooo good!

Delicious summertime sandwich! I have been making these for years, and I believe it is very important to use freshly grown summer tomatoes. Only thing I do different is add olive oil to the vinegar and drizzle over the sandwich instead of dipping. This was the first tme I used crushed red pepper with these and it adds great flavor. Thanks for sharing!

This recipes is amazing with a few adjustments.  I used Ciabotta bread instead, grilled chicken and added thin tomato slices along with diced sauteed red peppers.  To complete the sandwich, I first toasted the bread, while it was hot I added the pesto/mayo and sprinkled it with mozzarella cheese (i wanted to use it up or else I would have used slices)and I put it in the microwave for like 20 seconds to melt the cheese. On top of the cheese I carefully placed the cubed grilled chicken. On the other half I put the tomato pesto, bell peppers and tomato slices. I combined both sides and it was warm & delicious! I will make this again & again!

I customized this for 1 - I used a whole grain english muffin, cut the muffin in half, drizzled with olive oil and balsamic vinegar and sprinkled with basil flakes (I didn't have fresh basil on hand).  I toasted the muffin halves in the toaster oven.  Then I put slices of tomatoes and the mozzarella on top, sprinkled with more olive oil, balsamic vinegar and basil on top.  I put it back in the toaster oven for a few more minutes to warm it up.  It was great for an easy lunch that is healthy too!

Loved the recipe. Thanks. Funny, I did not have fresh basil so I substituted fresh cilantro and it did taste quite good. I am sure fresh basil would taste excellent. Thanks again.

Very good, though we didn't use half of the vinegar as a dipping sauce.  The vinegar's pretty strong and you don't want to overpower the sandwich, so we you don't need so much.  The sandwich itself is a great way to use the tomatoes and basil from the garden!  Yum!

This is one of my favorite sandwiches with slight variation.  When the author says fresh mozzarella, she's right - get the kind in water if you really want it to rock.  Garden tomatoes make all the difference asl well.  Fresh basil is awesome, but it can be pretty good with fresh spinach too.  I like it with just EVO and a sprinkling of dried oregano, salt and pepper - the balsamic is good, but I prefer it without.  Add some Prosciutto for a non-veg treat.

This was so easy! And tasty too! I used fresh basil from my garden and fresh chives for a little onion tast. I used Italian Bread and a few store tomatos, then drizzled balsamic vinegar and olive oil on the bread. I also put a little mix of the two in a side dish for dipping if others wanted more :)

My sis came to visit from out of town so I picked up the ingredients, fresh french loaves and some of the things the other reviewers mentioned and had this for dinner.  Some of the traditionalist added ham, turkey or beef and the more daring went with the basic recipe or added roasted red peppers, onions, mushrooms cooked with garlic and/or black olives.  It was great and if you decide not to use one of the ingredients don't let it be the basil. I will definitely serve this again when I want to show off. 5 plus stars!

This is a delicious sandwich. I spread the balsamic vinegar on the bread along with some fresh roasted garlic and put under the broiler for a couple minutes then added the mozzarella, tomato and fresh basil leaves. We think the veggies and mozarella are best left cold.  If using with a different kind of cheese, I may try heating it.  Will experiment with different breads.

Very good!  Used a garlic herb bread. Sprinkled the bread with balsamic vinegar and then toasted the bread and melted the cheese in the oven at 375 for 6 minutes.  Added the tomato and basil.  Perfect!  Omitted the red pepper flakes.

Even though I usually prefer meat on my sandwiches, I don't even miss it when I have this. I did make a few changes though: I popped the sandwich (open faced) under the broiler for a couple minutes- just enough for the cheese to melt and the top piece of bread to become golden. I then drizzled olive oil and the balsamic onto the top piece of bread, as well as the red pepper flakes and cracked pepper. This was great- I had two today already!

This was a nice light sandwich. Only good if you have really flavorful tomatoes from the garden.

Very quick, tasty, and  light lunch. My personal touch was a dab of pesto to the bread. I did not make the vinegar sauce just to try the sandwich itself. Will absolutely make it again. Try to get the best Mozzarella you can.

This was so great. I toasted the bread with some garlic butter, and added a few shakes of Montreal Steak Seasoning to the tomato layer. I didn't think it really needed the vinegar, but it tasted good with that too.

I love this sandwich! I julienne the basil because I don't like biting into a big leaf and I think it tastes better. I also throw my balsamic vinegar in the food processor with a few cloves of roasted garlic and drizzle in some olive oil until it's creamy. It's too strong otherwise. One time I turned it into a grilled cheese sandwich (minus the balsamic drizzle) and my boyfriend said it was the best sandwich he'd ever had. So many possibilities with these simple ingredients!

I only had a few things on hand but still managed to make a delicious light lunch for myself! I lightly toasted two slices of Ezekiel bread, they are smallish and flat. I sliced each slice in half lengthwise. I poured a bit of balsamic vinegar into the cap to have more control and very gently and lightly drizzled it over the toast. I took twelve basil leaves and placed three on each slice, then since I only had baby mozzarella balls I cut six in half and placed a half on top of each basil leaf. Then I drizzle olive oil all over it and a light shaking of sea salt. Each slice was three perfect bitefuls. It was fantastic! And cute! Next time I'll try the pesto. Just didn't have any. Didn't want tomatoes or red pepper. Delicioso!!!

Outstanding. used Le Brea whole wheat rolls that I toasted, used a brush to baste the tomatoes and bread. Marinated everything prior to cooking for several hours. Served with home grown cucumber and sweet onion with apple cider vinegar. I think I paired it with a Pino but don't hold me to it.

Ive always loved the tomato mozzarella sandwich at Panera but it's so expensive so thought I'd make my own. I used sweet basil from my garden and fresh French bread from store, really juicy garden tomatoes from the farmers market slightly salted it and added a wisp of black pepper.  I used a more expensive fresh mozzarella and balsamic vinegar mixed with EVOO and brush it on the bread . Toasted the bread.   Yummy lunch.

I make this sandwich with ciabatta bread and grill it with olive oil first then open face in the broiler with the tomato, basil and buffalo mozzarella, then when the mozz is soft, put a little mayo on the top with some pickled pepperoncini.  so simple and so flavorful

I did these as open faced "melts" for a recent party I had. They are completely yummy and way easy to make. DH asked for more later after everyone had left. I brushed the bread with EVOO and toasted. Then put down the sliced ripe tomato, chopped fresh basil, and fresh mozzerella on top. I put it back in the oven just until the cheese started to melt. So simple and awesome. Great with a nice bowl of soup ....or by themselves!  Thank you for posting.

Decent. I used foccacia bread instead of italian because that's what I had on hand. Seemed a little plain to me. Maybe a small amount of red onion would have jazzed it up a bit.

I have gotten into panani's, I have made something similar. I would use whole wheat ciabetta roll, split, spray olive oil on each half, and toast in my  George Forman's grill for a few minutes, when I make pesto, I save some and mix the pesto and mayo, spreading on each half, I add roasted peppers, fresh mozz, left over chicken cutlet and put on my  grill till fresh mozz is melted.  MMMMMM good!!!

I make this sandwich on lightly buttered French bread and use Brie instead of mozzaella and add cracked black pepper and balsamic vinegar.  Reminds me of days I got this sandwich in England in a deli on the High street!

If you haven't tried this, you don't know what you're missing!  I love fresh mozzarella, tomato and basil sandwiches.  I've been making them (on any kind of bread, usually a whole grain or multile grain), but it's great on Italian.  I use a little olive oil or italian dressing.  I hadn't thought of using red pepper flakes;  I'll have to try that.

These were delicious! I made these and a few other types of sandwiches for my daughter's birthday party. I sliced up the tomatoes, basil and mozzerella the day before so on the day of the event they took less than 5 minutes to assemble. I used a roasted garlic Italian loaf of bread and Newman's Balsamic Vinegraitte dressing. As a tip - I used those long toothpicks with the frill at the end to divide the loaf into sections before slicing into individual portions. Yum! Everyone love them. They were also great as leftovers since the bread was so substantial they didn't get soggy at all.

Excellent sandwich recipe.  Easy and simple, four ingredients and you are good to go.  I will have to try with Provolone as suggested by another reviewer.  But this is sandwich I would take to work or make for a picnic.

Excellent, quick, and easy. Great for a light summer meal.

Combining some reviewers' suggestions, I put the sandwich under the broiler, added freshly cracked pepper, used red wine vinegar, and diluted the vinegar with olive oil. (Actually, I just used a few drops of oil and vinegar.)

I "veganized" the recipe, using "Teese" soy cheese, which melts fairly well.

Next time I'd like to try a reviewer's suggestion to pre-soak the bread with the oil/vinegar. I think I'll add some roasted red peppers, too.

Pretty good, but next time I'll make some adjustments. I'll probably use the vinegar in a dressing or mixed with something so it's not so strong. I'll also toast it in the oven so the cheese melts a little. I'll definitely have it again though!

I thought this was an excellent light summer lunch sandwich. I have also added it as a must to servie for my vegetarian vistors.

I made basically 2 kinds of sandwiches out of this recipe because of my fiance's picky-eating habits. On both sandwiches I used fresh Mozzarella cheese & served on wheat French bread. I used a olive oil herb mix to spread on both sides of each piece of bread. On one sandwich I used roasted red peppers in place of tomatoes & added some pancetta. I used grape tomatoes in place of big tomatoes on the other. Used a griddle pan to toast. Served with a chicken tortellini salad. I really liked this recipe but probably won't make again due to fiance's pickiness :o)

I believe I used a bottled balsamic vinaigrette dressing instead of the plain vinegar.  So simple a recipe shouldn't be necessary, but thanks for reminding me how great this combo can be!

These were pretty good, but the vinegar needs to be diluted with oil or something. Another option would be to have some sort of a sauce right on the sandwich. It seemed like something was missing but I couldn't put my finger on it.

Very delicious and refreshing.  I recommend using Roma tomatoes.  And many grocery stores sell loaves of Italian bread that you "finish" in the oven; I think most of them are baked for about 12 minutes at 400 degrees.  They make wonderful bread for sandwiches such as this one.

I had everything on hand except the bread so I used regular wheat bread.  This was bold in flavor and light at the same time.  I'll make this again when I have the ingredients on hand.

I had to use toasted whole wheat bread. It was very good.  After I assembled it I put it in the oven for a few minutes in order to melt the cheese.
