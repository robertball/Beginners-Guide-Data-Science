This recipe is missing one stick of butter (use 2 sticks). Most brownie recipes for a 9x13" pan use 2 sticks butter. Hope this helps.

the only thing that was "wicked" was my temper after wasting ingredients to make a dry, dull, flavorless brownie. don't do it ladies.

I did not like this recipe.
The batter was too thick to spread and 
it turned out very dry with hard edges.
I didn't even leave it in the oven as
long as the recipe called for!

I thought these were great, easy-to-make fudge brownies.  I did double the butter, as suggested, and used pecans vs. walnuts, but that's personal choice.  I thought the flavor and the texture were both great!

This was a great recipe! Rivals my mom's "best ever" recipe that I loved as a kid. Had a sweet tooth when I was making them, added three tablespoons creamy peanut butter, half a cup of chocolate chips and a handful of flake coconut, and they weren't too sweet, but were chewy and great-tasting!

maybe i made it wrong but it came out like dry cake (in hindsight the flour, salt, baking powder combo shouldve been a dead give away. it was ok but we weren't real crazy about them.

I thought this recipe was ok, but it was very heavy and hard to spread. Also, I baked it for less time than called for and it still came out a little dry. The chocolate taste is very good, though. If I were to make this again, I would bake it for even less time at a lower temperature.

I'm sorry, but this was not a good recipe.  The batter was very thick, and when done baking it was very dry and heavy.  I even baked it less than it said.  It did have a shiny top although.

I read the reviews and went with 1 cup butter, 3 eggs, 2 cups flour and I added 1/4 cup or so of chocolate syrup with the eggs and sugar mix. Everyone loved them. Good luck.

I thought these brownies were very tasteless.  I've had mixes that turned out much better.  I think the recipe needs more salt and more chocolate.  I melted chocolate chips and drizzled them over the top to try to make up for their lack of flavor.

I did not like these brownies. they were more like an extremely dry cake rather than brownies. i understand some ppl enjoy cake like brownies, but im not one of them. I added an exta 1/2 cup of butter as others suggested. I also added a 1/2 cup of brown sugar as the batter didnt taste sweet enough before baking. before baking I added  peanut butter on top and swirled it in. though, none of these tweaks made a huge difference in me liking these brownies. sorry wicked brownie originator, theyre just arent that great at all :(

Too much sugar, not enough butter. Ended up having to use milk in a desperate attempt.

Much better with a layer of cream cheese in the middle.

I wish I'd read the reviews first.  After mixing as instructed, I found the batter to be too heavy.  I added about a 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce. And since I read the reviews, I've been keeping an eye on the timer:  took out 10 minutes earlier than recipe states.   Now, for the taste test......very cakelike, not fudgy, very bland.  Glad I added some moisture.

I did not care for these. however, on the bright side, you won't gain any weight from these brownies... because you won't be eating them. too dry, too cakey, too sweet, not chocolatey.

this is a very dense, fairly flavorless brownie. it was mushy on the inside and had a hard top. (I did cook it for only 30 minutes due to other reviews saying the cooking time was too long.)

I did not care for this recipe. i started it and came out with a paste-like batter, read the reviews and added some extra butter and coca to attempt to save it and it still came out like a dry cake. I think there were some mistakes in the amounts when this recipe was uploaded.

My 10 year old daughter made these yesterday and they were delicious. She chose this recipe because we didn't have chocolate in the house, only cocoa powder. She didn't use walnuts and only had 3 eggs but the brownies were great, soft, slightly chewy, very chocolatey but not too heavy. Not the most amazing recipe out there Im sure but easy and pretty good all the same. She is making another batch as I write! Thanks.

i doubled the butter, and baked at 160 C or 350 F for 25 minutes.  A bit on the cake-y side, but good flavor.  Not too sweet!  Easy prep and easy ingredients list, which is a must, as I am living in China :)

We did this recipe in a 9X13 inch pan.(in case you were wondering)and only baked it for twenty minutes. To add flavor and interest we put on a creamy icing which can be found under our name. Overall, we can see where you could go wrong, but we didn't! Hahahahahaha. Yum

Bake time is too long.  Try about 25-30 minutes max.  For regular brownies add more sugar than the recipe lists.  Also, I made them into orange chocolate brownies.  I zested in one large (light in color; less citrus oil) light-orange, orange.  They were perfectly delicious!

Oh my gosh, I wish I would have read the prevoiusly posted comments before I made these.  I agree with the other postings saying that the batter was sooo thick I knew they wouldn't turn out in the back of my mind.  I also baked at on;y 325 degrees and for 5 less minutes and I ended up with a pan of brownies you couldn't eat beacuse they were so dry.  Sad I wasted all the ingredients and my time.

I couldn't believe this recipe had so much sugar in it, but was very tastless.  They turned out like dry cake.  I was very excited to try a new brownie recipe, then very disappointed when I took them out of the oven.

Thanks for this recipe.  I lost a favorite recipe that used cocoa powder and this is the closest I've found so far.  I did double the butter as others have suggested.

I made these brownies as a base for a trifle and the dense cake-like consistency was perfect for that.  I made a few changes based on other reviews.  I used the 1 stick of butter but only used 2 eggs and half the flour.  I also added a teaspoon of vanilla.  These are not sweet brownies but may be good with a frosting or ganache.  I did not add the nuts to the batter but sprinkled them between layers of the trifle.  I also used an 11x7 pan instead of a 9x13.
