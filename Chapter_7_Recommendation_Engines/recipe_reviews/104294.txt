Really tasty!! My favorite tilapia recipe so far!! I didn't have all the ingredients on hand so made some modifications trying to keep with the spirit of the recipe (dried herbs instead of fresh, onion instead of shallot). I also value speed when preparing meals so instead of marinating, I just poured the marinade on top of the fillets, dumped some diced vegetables on top of them, and put them all in the oven together. A full, well-balanced, tasty dinner was on the table within 20 minutes of arriving home. Can't beat that.

I rated this recipe three stars as written....I was not real impressed.  The second time I made it (not realizing I already tried this one), I put the fish in a 9X13 baking dish and scooped the marinade over the fish. I allowed this to sit for approx. 1 1/2 hours until baking it.  I put sliced zucchini over the top, added some additional sea salt and fresh ground pepper. Then covered with foil and baked at 450 for approx. 23 min. or until zucchini was crisp tender.  This was awesome!!! The whole family devoured it, including my picky 2 year old who even scraped her plate for the first time ever!!!

THE BEST TILAPIA RECIPE EVER!  I made one teeny tiny change:  OMIT the sugar.  Put everything into a food processor and blend.  What an AWESOME flavor.  Thanks for sharing.

I did have to make a few changes, due to what I had on hand - like:  No shallots - just used onion.  Out of red wine vinegar, so just used 1 tbs white vinegar, and 1 tbs red wine.  Added an extra splash of lime juice.  I thought cilantro would make a better addition over oregano.  Cut the tequila to 1 tbs.  Even with the extra splash of lime, I was hoping for a more limey flavor.  (Also, sprinkled a bit of cayenne over my portion.)  Don't get me wrong, it was good - but could be made a lot better...

I made this for my husband, and he never forgot it! He loves the taste of this marinade. The only changes I make to the recipe are using 2 teaspoons dried oregano (instead of 2 tablespoons fresh), using extra garlic, and omitting the tequila. I also do not throw out the extra marinade - rather I cover the fish with it in the baking pan while baking. I even serve the fish with the extra pieces of marinade on top. It looks nice and tastes wonderful. This also smells so delicious while baking!

Didn't have shallots so I used 1 TB dried onion. I also cut the sugar in half as suggested by other reviewers but next time I will add the full 2 TB as I don't think it was too sweet at all.  I didn't marinade the fish- just put frozen fillets in a foil lined pan and poured the marinade over them.  Cooked them at 425 for about 18 minutes.  This ones a keeper!

Don't wait for summer for this one.  No need to make any changes.  The ingredients of the marinade combine to give a refreshing and unique flavor.  I fixed this for my family, along with the Alfredo Potatoes, and it was a big hit.

This is a great, simple marinade, good for when your side dish is a little work and you need something nice but which you don't have to worry about.  I used Captain instead of tequila, which I didn't have - I think any brown liquor would do.  Also I used one small onion instead of the two shallots.  I served it with fennel risotto and cooked arichokes and it was great!

This was AWESOME and I will make this over and over again (especially the sauce!). I took a lot of other reviewers' suggestions: omitted sugar completely, threw all marinade ingredients in food processor for a better blend and consistency, and then sliced zucchini thinly and layered it on top of fish, making the fish SO TENDER. Also added a finely sliced jalapeno (minus the seeds) on top of the zucchini for an extra kick. Paired it with "Best Spanish Rice" from this site for an AMAZING dinner that my friends couldn't get enough of. We literally licked the pan!

This was excellent.  I'm not the first to point out the following, but it's worth echoing: do not throw out the marinade!  Definitely pour it over the filets before you bake them.  Mine were cooked perfectly in 10 minutes flat.  Served with white rice and broccoli rabe, which were both solid complements.

This was incredible! I'm not sure why reviewers are leaving out the sugar and the tequila. Those were some of the best flavors. Highly recommended, by far my new favorite tilapia recipe.

A very tasty dish. A little too sweet though. I used 1 tsp. dried oregano and I spooned the marinade over top before baking. It went perfectly with "Brazilian White Rice" from this site and a salad. A nice summertime meal!

This was pretty good for us. I wanted to use my home-grown lemon-basil so I substituted that for oregano. I also had to use red wine bc I had no vinegar, and green onions bc I had no shallots. Was pretty good with the tilapia. I served with lemon wedges and parsley.  I also made the same marinade for baby gold and red potatoes, carrots & home-grown green beans, also marinated and broiled. The marinade was very strong with the veggies.

Delish and moist tilapia! Couldn't find a shallot, so used onion, and used a tiny bit of cooking wine since I had no tequila, but kept everything else the same. A forgiving recipe and I think it would be good on other fish and maybe poultry? Thanks!

This was a little too sweet for me, so when I make it again, I will take down the sugar a bit. I am also a garlic lover, so I will probably up the garlic too. Otherwise, this is a great tasting marinade!

I'm giving this five stars based upon my slight revision to the recipe.  I used cilantro, not oregano (toooo strong), I did not use tequila at all, and I only used 1 teaspoon of sugar.  I also baked it at 400 for about 25 minutes.  The fish seemed to turn out better at this temp and baking time.  It's a delicious recipe, though!

We had this tonight, made as written only with onion for shallots and dried oregano instead of the real thing. It IS very flavorful. My husband liked it quite a bit. The kids wouldn't touch it, scoundrels. I don't know if I will make it again because it obscures the fish taste so very much. I prefer something little less strong.

This was great!  I did not add the shallots, sugar, or tequila, and I used cilantro instead of oregano.  I took another reviewer's advice and cooked the fish in the marinade. I did not line the pan with tin foil. Excellent!

Very nice way to make tilapia.  I did not add sugar or the optional tequila and broiled it for 5 minutes after 10 minutes of baking and also left the marinade on the fish as did some others and served this with lobster ravioli! A success!

We really liked this Tilapia recipe.  I think the next time I make it I will put a little bit more lime juice in it.

If I could give this a 3-1/2 I would.  I think it had good flavor, but, was a little sweet for our taste.  I will try it again, but, next time use a little less sugar and add some red pepper flakes.

Loved this diSh!  Like others I didn't have time to marinate long, so I cooked the fish with the marinade in a foil pouch. Absolutely fantastic.  Now part of the rotation.

My husband and daughter really liked the flavour of the fish but thought it should be cooked longer, even though I cooked it longer than recommended. Might grill it next time.

The was very good! Made a few changes based on what I had on hand. Used green onion and dry oregano instead of fresh and the shallots. I cooked it with the marinade @425 for 15 mins. The marinade was very good its something I would put on a salad.

Sweet and tangy. Great just as written, but now that I don't have a lot of spare time on my hands. I marinate the fish and then wrap them individually in foil and cook in the crock pot for 2 hours on low.  They come out perfect every time and I don't have to do any dishes!

Have to agree with most that as written it is a little bland. I think the fish needs to marinate a lot longer. I'll try it again with less sugar.

I really liked the mild, but well blended flavors of this dish.  Left out the tequila (didn't have any) but otherwise followed the recipe.  Only marinated for 1 to 1.5 hours, but I still think it worked out fine.  Tasty and easy, thanks for a great summer dish!

Omitted the tequila because I didn't have any.  Kept all other ingredients.  Poured the marinade over the fish prior to cooking.  Very yummy!  My kids even ate it up.  Easy to make.

I had some tilapia in the freezer but wanted to do something different with it than usual.  This recipe sounded great and I had pretty much all the ingredients on hand so I printed it off and got after it!  The marinade smelled AMAZING!  I didn't measure the ingredients, just kind of guessed which I do often.  Mine turned out to be a little "strong".  But, I'm about 99% sure it's because I likely used too much red wine vinegar.  So, measure that out accurately and you should be good to go.  Excellent recipe, ENJOY!

SO GOOD! I didn't have shallots so I used a half of a sweet red onion instead and it was SUPERB! I also used jarred minced garlic instead of the chopped fresh garlic...and I made the marinade and poured it over the fillets and baked...WOW. My boyfriend said this is the best dish I've ever made. THANK YOU CreativeCook!

Substituted 2T minced white onion for shallot and honey for sugar.   Marinated for approx. 1.5 hours and baked with marinade in 9x13 pan.  Absolutely delicious.  Would love to try again with some tequila.

Came out a little bit too sweet.  I did use Patron silver tequila and used dried oregano.  It wasn't bad, but it's not something I'm dying to make again.

Loved this!! I didn't have red wine vinegar so I used apple cider vinegar and I didn't have shallots so I used some chopped green onion, including the tails. And I used dried oregano - probably about 1 tsp. Oh - and I didn't have tequila but it tasted fabulous without it.  I poured the rest of the marinade on top of the fish and threw it in the oven for 10 minutes and it was perfect. This is good enough for company!

Very good!!!  It was much better than I expecteted after tasting the marinade.  The fish was very tender and flakey.  I needed to cook mine almost 15 min.  Very happy with the recipe and will make again.

This is a great marinade.  Enhances the flavor of the fish without overpowering it.  I baked it as directed, but I think it will be even better next time when I pan fry it.

My whole family loved this so this will get mixed into one of my standard ways to make fish. I just made a couple of changes: dried oregano instead of fresh and key lime juice instead of regular.  Also I used 1.5 T of tequila instead of 2.   I marinated the tilapia for about 8 hours.

Excellent.  I worried it would be too sweet but was exceptionally tasty. The only change I made was using cilantro instead of oregano.  Not sure why I did that, had both fresh but it was still great.  Tilapia can be a little boring but this has a great flavor with out being overpowering. Thank you for sharing.

We though this was a simple and tasty if forgettable way to prepare tilapia.  We love garlic and shallots so we strained them out of the marinade and baked on top of the fillets.

I loved this!  I did, however, cook it in a skillet on top of the stove since we're in a summer heatwave.  Five minutes on each side in a moderately hot skillet did the trick!  Going to try this marinade with chicken next time.

Really good, very simple. I marinated on the baking sheet I used for 3 hours. Cooked at 400 for 15 minutes (4 4oz filets). I omitted tequila and shallots and added about 1/2 teaspoon onion powder. Fantastic, great flavor, not dry at all!

Very good! Definitely worth letting it sit & marinate (vs cooking it right away like I did the 1st time).  I didn't use shallots & replaced the red wine vinegar with 1/2 white wine vinegar, 1/2 balsamic vinegar because I had it on hand. Had some left overs & accidentally ended up eating it with fresh tomatoes...yum!  That was super yummy!

The girls liked it in March 2015. Didn't use shallots or tequila.

Wonderful recipe! I've made this a few times now-- once with exactly as written and another time reducing the sugar by half, and another substituting the lime juice for lemon. It was wonderful everyway I made it! My whole extended family loved it (including picky kids!)

For flavor I would give this a four, but it came together so quickly and with ingredients I had on-hand, so I'll bump it to a five. Plus, my husband ate three fillets - always a good sign! I used green onion since I had no shallots; 1 tsp dried oregano since I had no fresh; skipped the red wine vinegar; about four cloves garlic pressed; added some capers; a bit extra oil and lime juice and salt... I didn't have much time for marinating, so I poured it over the fillets in a 9x13 and let it sit for about 45 minutes and then threw in some green pepper, zucchini slices and a couple of shrooms (veggies sitting in the fridge); baked covered at 450* for 25 minutes and served over couscous. Filling but light and delicious!

My kids loved this! I grilled it over medium heat 3 minutes per side and it was perfect.

i used this on a 10 oz mahi fillet.. i marinated for 4 hours.. threw 2 potatoes (sliced), 4 large mushrooms (sliced), a small handful of baby carrots, and a small head of broccoli (chopped) in a pyrex.. mixed the leftover marinade with 1/2 cup of chicken broth and poured over the veggies.. laid the fillet on top.. covered with foil and baked until the fish was done.. removed the fillet and continued cooking the veggies until tender.. bf and i both felt the fish needed more salt.. for the veggies, we added S&P to taste.. it was pretty good after all was said and done.. but i was expecting the fish to be more flavorful.. maybe if i would have had the fish on the bottom like Meghan did, it would have made a difference

We all loved this dish.  The marinade was wonderful! The next time I make it, I would like to top the fish with a mixture of parmesan and parsley before baking.  I think it will look prettier, and the parm will give it just that extra little crispiness and salt that I was looking for.  I served it with brown rice and asparagus.  It was a big hit and soooo easy!

This was so easy and delicious!  It was a little bit too sweet for me, so next time I'll just use 1 Tbs instead of 2.  I still enjoyed it though!

Just finished making and eating this. I followed recipe except I didn't have fresh oregano, 
so I used dry instead, and only used 1 tbsp. Definitely recommend this recipe, it will be my go to recipe for tilapia from now on.This is wonderful!!

I've made this a ton of times because it's so good and easy.  I omit the sugar and tequila but keep the rest as is.  I've also just dumped the sauce on the fish and cooked immediately if I don't have time to marinate.  Great with steamed veggies!

The mix of oregano with tequila was a little weird--the Italian and Mexican flavors were a bit confused. I'll try next time with cilantro or coriander.

I made this recipe exactly as written and my entire family loved it.  The recipe says that it makes 4 servings.  I have 3 men and it was not enough for them so next time I will double the recipe.

I made this tonight for a very special couple in my life, I didn't let it marinate as long as the recipe called for, but it turned out wonderful anyways. Thanks so much
