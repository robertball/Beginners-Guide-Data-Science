Okay, so this sounded really good, and it might have been, except for the following..... I'm not sure why you would cook chicken breast in butter because the amount of time that it took to cook my chicken breast was way longer than 10 minutes, so the butter started scortching, and I'm not a big fan of burnt butter. THEN 3/4 cup of almonds covered only 3 of my chicken breast - so I had to grind more. THEN the cooking time to make sure the chicken is cooked through - well I don't know if something is wrong with me or my stove or my cooking abilities, but by the time these were done on the inside, the coating was burnt and my chicken was DRY. There are other things that I wasn't so thrilled with, but those were the biggies. ANYWAY, I think pounding out the chicken so that it might cook faster would be a good idea, maybe marinating it in some buttermilk so that it isn't so dry, and to me this amount of chicken needed more sauce and I was hoping for more orange flavor. It was very bland. SOOOOO....for the amount of time and effort and clean up that went into making this meal that I am sad to say there are waaay too many leftovers of, I will not be making this again!

Very flavorful!  I'd make it again :) But next time I'll probably bake it in the oven because it was sooo time consuming on the stove and all the breading was falling off and burning.

I was skeptical at first (especially as I was boiling the milk), but this turned out to be excellent. Some tips: Make sure you have enough butter when you flip the chicken, or the almonds burn. Next time, I'll make the sauce in a sauce pan while the chicken cooks, not wait for the same pan, so that the sauce and chicken are ready and warm together. Don't skimp on the orange flavorings. This was great with brown rice and veggies (sugar/snow peas which I sauteed in 1T of the sauce).

I don't like being the first to rate, but after trying this I had to do it. I don't like sweet on my meat usually, but this was AWESOME! I did not have rice, and had to have something for the wonderful liquid I served it with egg noodles. It was so good I could eat it every day.

This recipe is delicious. The sauce has a nice smooth sweetness to it. Very tasty. Next time I will try doing the chicken in the oven for a healthier choice.

This was not simple to make at all, and I don't think I will try this one again since overall the taste of the dish was just underwhelming. The sauce turned out SUPER lumpy, and all the almond coating came off the chicken into my non-stick pan. I would suggest pounding the chicken into thinner portions or butterflying it before proceeding to make it cook faster. I think the fact that I had to cook the chicken pieces so long until it was done was the reason the almond coating came off into the pan. The reason for the lumps? I am not sure. I think mixing the flour into the milk in another container before pouring into the pan would have helped. But, I followed the directions as noted. Thank goodness my blender saved the day by eliminating the lumps, however when it was all said and done and the sauce was ready, when we sat down to eat the chicken, I found the flavor bland. Lots of effort for little in return.
