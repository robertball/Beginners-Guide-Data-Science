This was great!  I used pepper bacon instead of regular bacon.  Also, my husband and I both agreed that it would be better with fresh green beans so I used 2 1/2 lbs of beans (I increased the servings to 15)  This worked great.  My neice and nephew who normally don't eat beans loved them. Will definiely make this again!!!

This was a HUGE hit. I used sliced mushrooms from a jar and it was just great. Didn't understand why the soy sauce but I followed the recipe just the same. I think it sets off something in the flavors. PERFECT! Made this at Thanksgiving just because it's easy to do in large quantity.

UH-Mazing! 
I used frozen green beans and cooked them prior to adding to bacon/mushroom mixture.
There is a lot of grease from the bacon, so I prefer to drain most of the grease before adding in the green beans.
Wonderful recipe-- I made it for the in-laws, and my mother-in-law actually asked me for the recipe!

I'd give this recipe more stars if I could!  This recipe was fantastic!!!  I made the beans for a cookout with friends and even though I doubled the recipe it was all gone!  Made it again for the family and they loved it!  I took the advice of another reviewer and added a splash of Worchester sauce  - it adds a little something.  But really the recipe is great!  Thank you for sharing!

Didn't measure, just used ingredients in the proportions that seemed right for me.  I used frozen, French-Style green beans and this was a nice way to dress them up. I particularly enjoyed the flavor the soy sauce contributed.

This is a great green bean recipe.  The bacon gives it such a nice flavor.  Next time I will use fresh or frozen green beans because the canned ones are too soft for my taste.

Ewwww.  This really was horrible.  The smell itself made me scared to try the dish.  However, I did try it and sadly, the smell was better than the taste.  Stay away from this dish.

This was great! I did change it a little. Because I ran out of garlic cloves, I used about an 1/8 to 1/4 tsp. garlic powder. I omitted the soy sauce and replaced it with salt and quite a bit of pepper. I used frozen green beans instead of canned French cut green beans for a higher nutritional value. I also omitted the mushrooms because I don't really like them. Otherwise, it was awesome served with French toast and baked apples. Made for a great, elegant breakfast!

These were really good. I used all the bacon grease too (per a previous review) and my uber picky husband and son couldn't get enough. The soy sauce was good, but I also added a dash of worshershire (also per previous reviews) and it made it better. Overall a keeper.

The best green bean recipe ever.  I make this every holiday and for regular dinners.  The only thing I changed is that I use the center cut Oscar Mayer bacon, otherwise I think there is to much bacon grease.

This was not a big hit at our party.  It neither tasted nor looked good.  I followed the recipe to the letter, but it just didn't work out for us.

My hard to please family, plus 5 year old, loved this.  I used walmart brand frozen green beans, fresh garlic, the oscar meyer center cut bacon and dash of worcestershire as suggested by others (plus soy sauce). Everyone said they were the best green beans ever. The frozen beans were soo easy and great I will definitely use them again!  Was able to get them well done but not crispy...just right for the south. We too eat healthy...if concerned just take out some grease and add back in if needed later.  Kept ALL the bacon in though.  Fantastic and a keeper.

We really enjoyed this.  I cooked the bacon, set it on a paper towel, drained most of the grease from the skillet, and then proceeded with the rest of the recipe as written.  Otherwise, I think it would've been too greasy.

Okay - here's the thing.  These beans are AWESOME!  Really yummy.  Now, no one cringe out there, but we left ALL the bacon grease in.  Yup.  I know, I know, it's nuts!  But we just went for it to try it, and see what happened.  I honestly don't think it would have been as good if we had only put in some for "flavouring".  And in case anyone's interested out there, I'm an extreme heath nut, and this would NOT be something I'd do on a weekly, or even bi-annual basis!  But once or twice a year won't kill you. . . so try it!

A different way to serve green beans; we liked it.  They're a little bit southern with an Asian twist, I'd say.  I used fresh green beans, steamed them first (I thought the canned would be too mushy)but otherwise followed the recipe.  Beans were nice and crispy.  Maybe some folks would find it a little too salty for their taste with the bacon and soy sauce, but we didn't mind it; I used low sodium products.

Everybody enjoyed these beans. I used canned mushrooms (all I had), added splash of worcestershire sauce and doubled garlic. So different and so good.

We all loved this recipe. Used peppered bacon (only about one-eighth of a pound) and microwaved a frozen bag of haricort verts from Trader Joes. Everyone had seconds including the kids.

I did this recipe and loved it. I just didnt add mushrooms and onions because my 8yr old is VERY picky. So instead i fried the bacon then added fresh (ends cut) green beans. Pepper to taste. Great flavor

Transformative!  This recipe is for those who do not like canned French-style green beans.  I used the basic ingredients of the recipe and enjoyed the dish.  I now like french-style beans.  Thanks for sharing, this quick to make side dish.  I will use this recipe again with various types of beans: fresh, frozen, can.

I made this at Thanksgiving and, while I did not care for it (I also forgot the soy sauce though) it got rave reviews from my family. My 2 brothers in law even requested I make it for Christmas even though I was not going to be there.  I used canned mushrooms and I suggest draining the beans and canned mushrooms WELL before adding.  I will make again before I pass final judgement.

I made these beans tonight.  I made them acording to the receipe.  The only things I will do next time are:  I will drain the green beans.(the receipe says add the green beans.  I drained half of the juice off)  then, I would add waterchestnuts which are not called for, but we both thought they would be a good addition.  Great receipe.

Real good recipe.  I did add some diced onions at the same time I added the mushrooms and garlic.  Soy Sauce gives it a very distinct flavor.  I'll make this one again!

This recipe was easy and delicious.  I made a few changes.  I drained the fat from the bacon, didn't add the mushrooms, and used fresh yellow and green beans (boiled for about 3 minutes).  My family loved it.  This one is a keeper!

Loved this recipe!  Loved the flavor of the soy sauce and garlic with the smokey flavor of the bacon.  I drained most of the grease from the bacon.  I omitted the mushrooms and used "cut" instead of "french style" beans.  I also drained all but a few tablespoons of the liquid from the canned beans because I thought it would make the bacon too soggy.  They turned out great.  Will make them again and again.

I highly recommend using fresh green beans instead of the canned variety. I snapped the ones I used and boiled them in water a bit first before making this recipe. They turned out very nicely. I like the mushroom and bacon flavor mixed in with the vegetables. Pretty good.

I made this tonight as written, and we did not like it at all.  I don't think there is anything I could have done to make it better.  The flavors just didn't blend, and it was greasy, even after I poured off the excess grease like others suggested.  We will not be making this again.

I followed the recipe exactly as written, although I like to rinse the green beans two or three times to get rid of "the can" taste before cooking. I'm not sure how the soy sauce works, either, but it does! These green beans are so good! I have made them several times...and will continue!

Wow!  This was so easy and really tasty!  Good way to cook fresh green beans.  I used low sodium soy and it adds a nice flavor to the green beans.  If your green beans are fresh it may take a little longer to cook.  Ultimately delicious, one of hubby's favorite veggie dishes!

These were ok. Didn't have enough bacon flavor for me so I added a few touches. Had bacon bits on hand so threw in them and some worchester sauce. Really livened it up.

This is a new way to make flavorful green beans, but beware if you are a health nut.  After cooking in bacon grease, I'm not sure the green beans count as a healthy dish anymore!

It works really well when you add 1 tablespoon of Tomato puree just before serving.  Just let it simmer for about 1 minute.  Great recipe!!!

This is one of the best recipes I have ever made! I like to add some mushrooms, and put in a splash of Worchester sauce. You will love this as a side for any great entree. Give it a try!
