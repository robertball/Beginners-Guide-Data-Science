MY NEW FAVORITE GO TO, SO GOOD! I used 2 fresh chicken breasts chopped into bits and cooked with half a package of Taco Seasoning mix (which allowed me to omit the other spices) and about 1/4 cup of water after browning the onions and mushrooms. Use whatever you have in your refrigerator. It made a nice glaze. I also cooked 1 cup of long grain white rice the day before (use that leftover Chinese white rice or any flavor) and add it to the chicken, whole kernel corn, black beans (all drained) and 1 small jar of Pace Salsa. I simmered it until all the seasonings combined. Super quick and simple.
I then put it into a olive oil sprayed 9x13 pan topped with Mexican blend cheese and crumbled tortilla chips. I baked at 350 for 1/2 hour.  You could bake less since everything is already cooked. Baking it and letting it set a little while just adds to the end flavor. Top with sour cream and chives when serving. This tastes better heated the next day, if your lucky enough to have left overs! :-) My husband can't wait until I make it again-so easy, tasty and quick!

I frequently use recipes as a guide, after reading the reviews. I made just a few small additions: used fresh chicken tenders and sautéed with 1/4 sliced onion and 1/4 orange pepper chopped and about 10 grape tomatoes cut in half, 1/4 tsp Adobo powder.  Once everything was lightly cooked (not mushy).  I added beans,corn and spices to pan just to warm, stirred in half of cheese and baked as directed. Then added rest of cheese and tortilla chips to top -10 minutes more baking 3 minutes broiler.  Started with burrito but enjoyed it better without the burrito. Served with fresh fruit.

Yum! Really easy to put together and really tasty. My salsa wasn't the thick type, so there was quite a bit of liquid at the bottom of the dish. Serving with a slotted spoon fixed that though.  Definitely will be making this again.

Good tasting meal. I used two cans of black beans. Also, just used reg chicken breasts diced and cooked in a skillet with taco seasoning before adding to meal.

We loved this! I hadn't planned dinner and had frozen chicken breasts which I sprinkled with taco seasoning and baked at 350 for an hour then sliced and added the rest of the recipe ingredients stirred and baked as stated.  Delicious!

Excellent recipe. I used left over roast chicken, chopped into small chunks. I didn't have Mexican cheese blend in the fridge but I did have cheddar, mozzarella & Jalapeno Monterey Jack. I nuked some basmati rice on the side, mixed the 2 together & YUMMY !!  A quick & easy dinner.

This was amazing!  The only thing I did different was used two bone in chicken thighs that I had put in the crockpot that morning. After the chicken was cooked I skinned it amd took it off the bone. I didn't have tumeric so I doubled the cumin and added a pinch of cayenne since hubby and I like spicy food.  We ate this like a taco dip with doritos amd a little sour cream and taco sauce on top!

I added more cheese to the top and I used a pre-made chicken fajita mixture that I bought at the butcher shop.  The fajita mixture already had spices, peppers, onions in ITV so I did not add the single spice ingredients.
I served it with tortilla chips...everyone loved it!!! And I will definitely be making this again!

Made it EXACTLY as written, Tyson chicken strips seasonings, everything, even the timing.  Recipe did not mention thawing the frozen strips ahead of time so I left them on the counter just under a half hour. Surprisingly good, since I more a fan of fresh ingredients, not canned or frozen.  The green salsa was mrs. Renfro's HOT and the only one in my market.  Next time I will try a cooler version.  There WILL be a next time!

This has joined the dinner rotation at our house. I typically use shredded chicken breasts seasoned with taco seasoning. I do serve with rice and sour cream as some of the other reviews suggested. Tasty, easy, weeknight dinner!

Delicious recipe. We made bone broth during the day with a whole chicken. We shred the meat off, and cut it into cubes, tossed it with some GLUTEN FREE (DIY) taco seasoning, about 1T. Added the rest of the ingredients, and served it over lettuce with some jalepenos, sour cream & habanero sauce for those that wanted it.  Crushed tortilla chips, too.  We will have this one again!

It was good but something wasn't right. I would have rather shredded chicken and used more like nachos. Corn was a good addition.

This was terrific and would make again.  I used some leftover chicken fajita mixture from the night before and cooked up some more chicken on the side to make enough to put this together.  Didn't use the tortilla chips, but "toasted" a couple of sandwich wraps to have as a side dish.  Delicious!!!

This is one of my favorite dishes and have served it several times to friends with rave reviews.  The only change I make is to add 1 tsp of Mexican oregano & 1/2 tsp of a southwest seasoning for a little more kick.  I also made it once with red salsa instead of the green & it's a toss-up as to which I prefer.

Great casserole! My whole family loved it. I changed my ingredients a bit, I used 3 fresh chicken breast chopped into bits, cooked with 1/2 bag of taco mix (to eliminate the other spices), and used 2 cups of Mexican cheese,used the 1st cup in the pan with the chicken,sauce, corn, and black beans and also added a cup of cooked rice. I simmered them all until the seasonings were combined. Then I put it into a olive oiled 9x13 pan. Topped it off with the last cup of cheese and crumbled tortilla chips. Cooked it @350 degrees for 30 mins. I will definitely be cooking this again (maybe one a week).

I made it and it was really good. Flavorful, quick and with a side of homemade guacamole and chips it made a great lunch just as the recipe is. The next time I made it I grilled 2 large chicken breasts over charcoal and chopped them up. Then I substituted for the ground coriander a half teaspoon of ground dried diced orange peel plus 1/4 teaspoon of ground cumin  and chopped up two green onions to mix in. It took it to another level. I"m going to add some black olive slices the next time around. This is a recipe that you can easily add variety without losing the wholesome goodness of the original.

Yum, whole family loved. Sauteed raw seasoned Fajita chicken strips, and cooked off or poured off extra remaining water. Used couple cans of rinsed black beans and less cheese. Did not add rice or any extra carb like many reviewers suggested. Spread in 10x13" pan to bake. Good "comfort casserole" without the loaded extra fat and carb content.

I used navy beans instead of black beans. My mistake. This doesn’t translate well with substitutions. It’s very blandly seasoned which is great for those who don’t like spicy.

Very good! I didn't have salsa verde so I used a 1/2 cup of green enchilada sauce.  I did top with the tortilla chips, plus we used tortilla tip to scoop and eat. Yum. Will make again.

Will make this recipe again. Alterations include: used 1.3 - 1.8 lbs of chicken breast cooked with fajita seasoning and about 2 oz. of green chiles cooked with it. Also, used mild chunky salsa instead of salsa verde.

This one was a keeper! It was so quick, easy and flavorful. I served it over a warmed a tostada shell for  added crunchiness . Yummy! The leftovers the next day were just as good.

This was so easy to make and (even better) was so tasty eat.  I had 2 precooked chicken breasts available so I diced those into bite sized pieces.  Then I used a homemade verde sauce that was super spicy.  So, in order to mellow the heat, I mixed about 1/2 cup sour cream into the verde sauce along with some leftover cilantro lime rice (about 1 cup) from dinner the night before; I then followed the recipe as written.  This is definitely a weeknight, or any night, dinner winner - my who family loved it!

This was very simple and quick. I chopped up two boneless chicken breasts into chunks, mixed it with a cup of red salsa instead of salsa verde. Everything else stayed the same (although I only used 1/4 of cheese on top.).

I had to make some changes because I thought I had balck beans, but didn't.  I ended up using a can of chili beans.  It actually tasted really good.  I will make this again on with the black beans.

This turned out really great.  I chose this recipe to use up some leftover chicken, corn and black beans.  I shredded my chicken as I had less than the recipe called for, and used Tex-Mex spice mix instead of the individual spices.  This made a great side dish.  By adjusting ratios of chicken, corn and beans it could be a main course, a side dish, or with finely shredded chicken would be a fantastic nacho dip.  Will definitely make again.

Quick and easy "as is", but a great spring board to customize. I sauted onion in a skillet, then added fresh cubed chicken and a small can of enchilada sauce, simmering until the chicken was cooked through and the sauce reduced to a thickness I liked. I omitted the salsa and spices, but combined the remaining ingredients together per the recipe and skipped the oven completely. Served with rice. An easy meal for the books!

It was decent.  I will make again but not in a rush to do so.  I felt there was too much chicken as compared to the other ingredients, and it should have been cut up.  The big strips overwhelmed everything else.  I made as directed, and the flavor was fine, but I think next time I will add some black olives, and maybe some diced red or green pepper.  It certainly was easy, though, so 5 stars for that part.  Great for a last minute dish.

This recipe is a 3 by itself, but I think it was a 4 the way I made it.  I added chili seasoning and onions.  I also made Spanish rice and served the casserole over a bed of the Spanish rice with sour cream on top.

I was looking for a recipe to use the jar of salsa verde I had in the pantry, and I am so glad I found this one! I made a few changes: I sautéed a couple of boneless chicken breasts seasoned with a little salt, garlic powder, and chili powder; I used frozen corn instead of the canned; I also had some black beans in my freezer, so I used those instead of canned, as well. I didn't have any tortilla chips, so I had to omit those, but next time I will use them. This dish was a winner and has been added to our menu choices. Thanks for great recipe!

I also added a can of green chili, and served it over rice.  I used a pint of my own bottled chicken and sprinkled taco seasoning over it before adding it to the mixture of rice and corn.  It was easy and yummy!

This was amazing!!!  Instead of a casserole I put it in taco shells.  Added a little hot sauce and was in heaven!

This was definitely yummy. I used chopped pieces of leftover rotisserie chicken that added really nice flavor.  But it was still a  little too bland/basic. My husband and I agreed that  it was a home run with added (red, fresh) salsa and/or sour cream  but wouldn't  have been great without.

Like other reviewers, we used boneless skinless chicken breast cut into chunks and seasoned with taco seasoning. It was easy to make and delicious to eat. We will definitely be adding this into our meal rotation!

This turned out great!

I added more cheese than the recipe called for. I also bought regular chicken breasts, pan-fried them, and then shredded them

This recipe doesn't serve five. I would say it serves four at the most. You will go back for seconds so, make double if serving four.

Delicious, simple and easy. Used the chicken breast strips from Costco it's not seasoned. I was a little worried but I just increased the cumin and coriander by a little and it turned out great. A keeper for sure

Solid dish! Me and my wife ate the whole thing in 24 hours. I don't usually buy the Tyson strips so I just stripped chix and lightly pan fried it prior to adding it to the baking dish. I'd recommend either using Tyson or marinating your chicken to match the dish. Also, you could add more beans or corn- I had room in the dish to "bulk" it up. And crushed up tortilla chips added needed texture. Darn this is good!

An excellent meal, my husband and I love it and even my 3-year-old picky daughter will pick at it occasionally. I have stopped rinsing the beans, all you need to do is drain the liquid really well and you’re fine. Also someone mentioned liquid at the bottom - if you stir it and let it sit for five minutes when you take it out of the oven it will absorb the liquid. Great with tortillas, chips, or as is!

In house food critic raved about it too!  I had made a batch of Salsa Verde that turned out very/too hot, but in this casserole it was perfect.

One of the few meals our family of 7 goes back for thirds and fourths on. We use Foster Farms chicken and add about 14 oz. of salsa. Sometimes instead of corn we will use green beans, and sometimes I add both. Great meal to quickly put together.

I used my homemade Green Tomato Salsa Verde and grilled my own chicken breasts to make this. We liked it a lot. Will make it again.

I loved this recipe! I didn't have salsa Verde, and so I substituted it with green enchilada sauce. I also added a couple of cups of rice to make it more filling and to be able to feed the whole family. The first time I made it I did it without the rice and I liked it a lot, but the second time when I made it with the rice I loved it!

My husband said I could make this again which means he likes it.  I used just the plain Grilled and Ready to Use Chicken because that was what I had but it was still good.  Quick and easy also which I love.  I will be making this again.

This is delicious! I'm not a big meat eater so I reduced the amount of chicken. I added a small chopped onion and a little more salsa verde just to finish what I had left in the jar. Instead of the chips, I had 3 leftover corn tortillas in my freezer that I cut in pieces and folded into the mix. I also used less cheese. I'll be making this again.

Absolutely loved this stuff! Soo yummy. The only flaw to it was eating the leftovers made it kind of soggy. Definitely best eaten freshly made!!

This was delicious! I made it with leftover chicken breasts, boiled in chicken broth and deboned, served with rice, tortilla chips and tossed salad.  Hubby gave his words of approval, "you can make this again." ?? -CEStillman
