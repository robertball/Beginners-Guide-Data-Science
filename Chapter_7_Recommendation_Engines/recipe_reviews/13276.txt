Nice recipe, although the onion needs to be cooked a tad longer.  The broth is a little lacking in flavor.

I would give more stars to my version of this, but if you made it following the recipe, it would be very watery and bland.  I used the amount of vegetables in the 16 serving recipe, with generous 1/2 cups, but only used 5 C liquid instead of 12.  4 of those cups were my homemade soup stock, not water, so had much more flavor.  I started by sauteing the onion, with a couple cloves of garlic, twice as much salt, and a little crushed red pepper, until the onions were tender, then added the stock/water and the first potato. I used fresh chopped tomatoes instead of canned, added at the end.  It came out very good but made enough to serve 4 people generously as a main dish, not 8 (amt of liquid I used) and clearly not 16. And I still needed to add salt and pepper when it was finished, even having doubled the salt.
