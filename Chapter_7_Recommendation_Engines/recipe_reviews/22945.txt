I must preface this recipe with the fact that I chose this based on a white chili that I love at a PNW taco shop. This was very close, but I did make adjustments to try to duplicate the restaurant recipe. I used 3 cans of great northern beans and I pureed one of the cans to give a little thickness to the soup/chili. I also added 4 minced garlic cloves. I had no turkey, so I sauteed 1 1/2 lbs of chicken breast tenderloins. I added about 1/4 teaspoon of allspice to give it some depth and added dried cilantro to taste. Left out the cheese & parsley cuz I forgot:) This is an excellent winter time recipe. Very healthy too. Thanks so much Mickie.

this was really good. i used leftover thanksgiving turkey and it was perfect. everyone is sick of thanksgiving food after a few days of leftovers so this did the trick. add the cumin a little at a time until it's to your taste.

I used this recipe for a chili cookoff and won- great chili.  I used ground 97% fat free turkey which I browned first.  I also added in a bell pepper with the onions and celery, and a very large finely chopped zucchini when I added the beans.  I used cilantro to top instead of parsley.  I added in a can of black beans and an extra can of broth as well.  It was super yummy!

This recipe turned out great!  I added Cayenne pepper to spice it up and served it with cornbread, sour cream and MJ cheese.

This turned out awsome. I did make a few changes. I left out the onion im alergic so i added some onion powder. Left out the celery and corn. Dont drain the beans you will get a thicker and tastier chili. I only added 1 can of chili peppers and cut the cumin in half. I also added some red pepper flakes and a bit of chili powder.

Now that it is pheasant season, use your game as a great substitute to this yummy recipe. Just cook the pheasant in your crock pot to make it easy to pull from the bone.

I had a similar recipe for White Chili and lost it so I came to my trusty allrecipes.com for a replacement.  This one fits the bill.  The only change I really made was to use fresh chicken and saute it with the onion and celery and I didn't have corn, or even want corn in it, so I threw in a can of white hominy.  Absolutely delicious addition!!!!  I love hominy and any time I can incorporate it into a dish, I'm very happy.  I'm looking forward to my leftovers this week!

Looks more like green chili then white chili.  Put in the crockpot and turned out really good with some cornbread.

This was pretty good.  Too much cumin for me so be careful if you are not a fan.

Something from the picture tells me that this is topped with more than just shredded cheese and parsley. Is that crema?

It was a great use of leftover Thanksgiving turkey.  Needed more spice for me so I added a dash or 2 or 3 of cayenne pepper and extra hot sauce.  Overall a tasty winter dish.

Try adding a yellow bell pepper to this. My husband and I both loved it and said it will go onto our favorite recipe list. Easy to make too.

Delicious! I left out the celery because my family doesn't like, added a pinch of garlic, but otherwise left the recipe as is. Served with Fritos and Monterey jack cheese. Meant to top with sour cream, but forgot. It didn't even matter, it was so good! Family went back for seconds. Nice change of pace from a tomato based chili. Can't wait to eat the leftovers tomorrow!

This was delicious.  My husband and I both enjoy a little heat so I added a couple more teaspoons of cumin.  I felt that it needed more liquid so ended up adding a third of a can of broth.  My husband was late coming home from work and it ended up simmering for an extra hour, this didn't appear to have any impact on the texture.  I will definitely be making this again.  Thank you for a great recipe.

I had never made any form of white chili before. this has become an absolute favorite. it is the simplest and best tasting. It is so easy. i only ever use one can of green chilies and often use chicken. so simple I even have the recipe memorized.

I used chicken, no corn, no hot spices, served with a dollop of sour cream. Very good!!!
