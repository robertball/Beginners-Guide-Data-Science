Moist and delicious! Very easy to make. This recipe uses more pumpkin than most recipes I've seen, resulting in a great pumpkin flavor. This recipe makes great muffins too.

This was a delicious and moist bread and my children loved it. I used the low fat evaporated milk and it was wonderful. I added a little extra brown sugar and put some small chocolate chips in one batch to make it a desert bread. I have also added raisons. My children aren't real fond of nuts so I came up with other add ins. Coconut is also good as an extra in this bread.

Great bread, nice and moist. I was very surprised how simple it was to make. Next time, I will add a little more pumpkin pie spice,brown sugar or some extra cinnamon. Will definately make it again.

I was pretty disappointed with this one. 
i love pumpkin and decided to try this. It turned out very bland, even after others suggested to add more brown sugar and cinnamon!will continue to look !have to say that it is very moist but the taste just wasn't there for me.

I followed others' advice and added a bit more brown sugar.  I also added more evaporated milk, and it's so dense and moist.  This is some of the best pumpkin bread I've ever eaten.  I serve it chilled, and everone has loved it.

Didn't really care for the flavor of this.  It wasn't sweet enough for my tastes and needed much more spice.

I was disappointed with the consistency of this bread.  It turned out rather rubbery.  I would also recommend using more pumpkin pie spice.  But overall the falvour was not bad.
