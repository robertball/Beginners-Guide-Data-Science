Love the flavor & the heat. Do not reduce the salt, it actually needs it. I always use fresh cracked pepper and gound salt. Just the way I do things. Next time I may add a little mayo just to see what that does. It makes PLENTY!!  We used it for a prime rib roast and had plenty for future sandwiches. I will not buy the creamy horseradish store bought stuff again now that I made this!!!

Excellent and easy.  I did add a squeeze of fresh lemon and garnished with parsley.  Perfect accompaniment to the stuffed beef  tenderloin.

This is simple & quick to make......and delicious. We love things with a kick, so I doubled the horseradish.  Absolutely yummy. I served with sliced brisket and for lunch the next day, put dollops on some  black bean/quinoa veggie burgers.  Fabulous!

Had a hearty taste, but just needed a little more. I used it to make some Horsey Deviled Eggs (a recipe that I also found on All Recipes), which made it even heartier.

I ended up using horseradish mustard in place of horseradish… Seemed to balance the ratio quite well with my added lemon juice… 10/10 Planning to use this for my Father’s Day meal!

Very easy and tasty. If I make it again I would use about half the horse radish and make only a third of the recipe. It makes a lot. Full amount of horse radish was a bit much.

I made this for the first time last night and it was excellent. We made it to go with a boneless rib roast, but ended up slathering on everything -- bread, veggie sides, you name it. 

A couple alterations I made based on other recipes I was seeing:
Added about 1 tbsp of stoneground mustard
Subbed a little of the sour cream for mayonnaise, plus a few drops of stevia extract for a little more sweetness

I made this, the only alteration I made is I added a squirt of mayo to make it a little sweet.

Absolute perfection! No changes necessary except maybe to add or eliminate the amount of sour cream based on your heat preference. This is SOOOOO good! Thank you for this simple and delicious recipe!.
