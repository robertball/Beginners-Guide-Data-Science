Fantastic! My husband devoured this! The only thing I changed was that I added a few spashes of spicy szechuan sauce since I saw that it was a bit sweet.. And I just really like the mixture of sweet and spicy. Overall, I will be making this again.

Made this with beef and with chicken on separate occasions. Both were delicious. I cut back the soy sauce as it is a bit too salty for our family.  did not always marinate over night and it was still yummy.
I have made with recommended veggies and with my own mixture all turns out fantastic. I serve mixed with rice noodles and i have served with rice.

I only used the recipe for the sauce. I have a go-to veggie list my family tolerates. At any rate, I added a teaspoon of sesame oil and a teaspoon of hot sauce to balance flavors and swapped apple cider vinegar for rice wine vinegar because I didn't realize I was out. I served it over rice. This could very well have passed for a restaurant dish. I'm not one to immediately toot my horn, but I'm definitely making this again.

JUST MADE IT. I DOUBLED THE RECIPE. ADDED JAPANESE EGGPLANT TO THE AMOUNT OF MUSHROOMS I HAD TO MAKE UP 2 CUPS. ASPARAGUS IS TOO EXSPENSIVE SO I USED BOK CHOY. STIR FRIED THE BEEF AND VEGGIES SEPARATELY, ADDED THE BEEF IN EXTRA SAVED MARINADE WITH CORNSTARCH AND BAMB!!!

A delicious combination that goes well with home made stir fried rice as well, or over a bed of steamed white rice and lettuce.  To note, although it adds on a little more time, I stir fry my meat seperately, and only for maybe 30-45 seconds per side, it comes out delightfully crispy and not soggy...also, drain and save your marinade if you like, but don't stir fry in it, that defeats the purpose and you're more boiling the meat.  :D    Kudos.

This is really good. I'm a rather difficult person to "wow" so I'm giving this recipe 4 stars. As the recipe is written it's a little too sweet for my tastes, but overall I'd say it's definitely a nice, easy dinner and very tasty.

Delicious, made as written except I did not have rice wine vinegar, so I used 25% water and 75% white wine vinegar.  My husband and son enjoyed this recipe and I have the go ahead to make again.  My only complaint would be the beef was over cooked, so next time I will not cook the beef as long before I add the veggies.  Thank you for submitting this recipe.

I loved it for its garlic and beef, then as well its asparagus (under-used in my kitchen) and red bell pepper. It was a little on the sweet side. But its flavor balance was just waiting to see the light of day.

Essanaye's Sesame Beef Stir-fry Haiku: "Per the cook's foot note, I didn't use the cashews. (Also removed beef.)" After the steak was browned, I removed it to a separate plate and covered to keep warm while I continued w/ the recipe and its veggies, returning it to the skillet w/ the cornstarch slurry at the end; otherwise, I can only imagine that the steak would've been the texture of a leather shoe and that would've made me sad. But otherwise, this was a really tasty stir-fry and since I knew that there would be leftovers I skipped the cashews entirely; I found that the leftovers tasted even better anyways! Thanks Essanaye - I think I've found my new favorite stir-fry (sauce) recipe, and next time that I make this, I'll probably toss in whatever vegg's on its way to wilty territory.

Made the recipe as is. The beef turned out dry, over cooked and too sweet. Brown sugar is better than white sugar in this type of recipe.

This wasn't bad, we just weren't fans of the sauce.  Too sweet and too bland somehow.  Thanks.

Loved the flavor of this and all of the vegetables!  I do think that you could change up the vegetables with whatever you like. My husband says itâ€™s a keeper so I will definitely make this again.

This was real good and had great flavor.  I cut sugar in half and used brown instead of white.  Served over rice.  The cashews are a nice touch, but I forgot  to add the green onions.  Next time...  I followed some reviewers suggestion and drained marinade  before briefly stir frying meat, stir fried vegs separately so they stayed crisp, thicken marinade and then added all other ingredients.  Only add cashews & green onion when serving.
