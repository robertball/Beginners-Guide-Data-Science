Excellent base, but here's how you make this world famous soup!!!!!!!  First sautee your onions and your celery.  Second, I added some green onion, and garlic.  Before adding water, season it with salt, pepper, thyme, and parsley.  Then a little dousing (1/4 to 1/2 cup) of white wine (chardoney) never hurt anybody.  Do this before the water is added too.  To thicken add a roux or substitue heavy whipping cream.  Also, throw in some fresh sliced mushrooms (1/2 cup or so) to really get some great flavor going on.  I threw in shredded swiss the chedder for a little more depth and it worked.  Really worth keeping, the most effort was in the chopping of vegatables.

AWESOME soup! I followed a few suggestions from the reviews and had the BEST soup the other night! This will become a regular for us. I suteed the onion & celery with mushrooms, salt, pepper, thyme, & parsley in butter. This smelled wonderful. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly. This made enough soup to fill my 6 qt roaster to the TOP! So start with a LARGE pot. A+ recipe.

W-O-N-D-E-R-F-U-L-!!!  I took this potato soup to a pot-luck at work and everyone said it was the best potato soup they had ever had.  I cooked my onion and celery in with the bacon and left the extra bacon grease in the soup pot!  Very fattening, but tasty!  I also used Campbell's Cream of Mushroom Soup with Roasted Garlic and added a couple of dashes of Mrs. Dash onion and herb.  Great recipe!  Will definitely be using this one over and over

Excellent! The ingredient list is spot on.  I sauted the onion and celery in a little butter and added some black pepper.  Used 3 parts chicken broth to 1 part water to make sure it didn't taste like chicken soup.  Have used heavy cream & half & half, they're both equally as good.  Put the bacon in with the potatoes so the flavor sinks in. So many wonderful flavors, my step-son who doesn't 'do' soup said it was the best he's ever had and loves it! I add garlic to most things but wouldn't for this recipe, thanks! All my other inferior potato soup recipes are getting deleted from my box :)

This was a great recipe to start with.  I peeled my potatoes, then I fried the bacon and set it aside.  I sauted the onions and celery in the bacon grease, then drained the grease off.  After boiling the potatoes, onions and celery, I removed about 1/3 of the water.  It seemed like it was going to be too thin for my taste.  After combining all other ingredients, I simmered for another few minutes, then let it stand on the stove, covered.  It thickened up really well and was wonderful with bread.  Everyone loved this soup, and I will definately be making it again.  Thanks!

This soup is awesome! My husband is taking it to work with him for several  days now. He called me at home just to tell me again that it "rocks". It made a lot but we like it reheated even better. The only thing I would alter is if it looks like you have a lot of water left after you are done boiling the potatoes and celery and onions, I would take out about a cup or two of water and then add the other ingredients. It will make it a little more creamy. But it was great just like it was. I just prefer creamier soup. I also topped it with sliced green onions. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was very good.  I scaled down to 4 servings and used cream of celery soup on place of cream of mushroom. Added some shredded cheese and chives when served. Next time I will peel the potatoes (didn't like the peel coming off while eating) and try ground sage sausage.  *update* I've make this again and added dried thyme, parsley and garlic to give more flavor.

This is a great recipe!!  I'd never made homemade soup before and this was a very easy one to start with.  I added a little more cheese and less bacon.  My kids LOVE it and want it at least once a month. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Fast & yummy is always a winner with me. Very good and filling too. Some changes, saute' the onion in the bacon pan, along with a little fresh garlic. Also, whenever I make a cream soup instead of cream, half & half, or whatever the recipe dictates I use canned milk. I suggest mixing the milk in a bowl with the canned soup before adding to the hot water so it wouldn't have lumps. Didn't have any celery, didn't even miss it. Also, I didn't add the cheese to the pot. Instead I prefer to add the cheese like a garnish on top of the soup in the bowl. I also added a dab of sour cream to my bowl before pouring the soup in. The soup was a little thinner than I prefer, so I mixed a little corn starch with a small amount of milk and added that at the end. This is a great recipe, a real keeper.

This is pretty good, although I prefer my bacon bits sprinkled on top of my soup, not actually in it, I will stick to my own standards.  I also added a couple more boullion cubes, cause I like flavor, a "little" salt and some pepper.

Good recipe.  I left out the chicken bouillon cubes and used about a cup of country ham broth.  Great flavor!

The original recipe contains WAY TOO MUCH sodium.  Instead, buy the healthy choice (Fat Free and less sodium) or just less sodium can of cream of chicken.  Also, omit the chicken bouillon.  The sodium in the can of cream of chicken is enough seasoning.    I also added a little chives or diced scallions for garnish.

Excellent !!! But one tip, do not waste your time frying all that bacon, only to put it in the soup and it gets all soggy again...UGH !  Buy 'real' bacon bits(not those fake Bac-O's kind) and thow them in/or on top, when you serve the soup.  YUMMO !!!!!!!!! :-)

This is absolutely the worlds best potato soup. I was not sure if my  family would eat it as some of them are very picky eaters. My grand daughter ate two bowls of it and as I was putting it away after eating she asked for more! I have enough left for another meal. I definitely will be making it again. I did add 2 cloves of garlic and sauted the onions and celery in butter and did not have half and half so I used 1 cup of whipping cream and 1 cup of milk instead. Very good.

This is a great base. I sauteed my onions, celery, minced garlic in the bacon grease. I used chicken broth instead of water. I added cream and half and half instead of condensed soup ( did not have any on hand) topped with crumbled bacon, scallions, and cheese. Very yummy and easy. I am making it for the third time as I write this review.

This is to die for.  I peeled the potatos,  sauteed the celery and onion and use heavy whipping cream instead of half and half.  I also added about a cup of leftover mashed potato but it would be awesome either way.  This is fantastic!!!

They weren't lying when they named it the best.  I've made this several times and it's always a hit.  Tip: if I don't feel like frying up a pound of bacon (or the bacon doesn't make it once it's fried) I'll throw in a 3 oz jar of real bacon bits.

I changed it up a little.  I used russets, reds, and sweet potatoes, the left over ham from Xmas and pureed half of the soup in the pot to thicken it.  I didn't add the cream of mushroom soup. Great soup!

Because I don't eat MSG, I had to change a few things...put the veggies and the potatoes in broth to boil, homemade a cream of mushroom by sauteeing the mushrooms and onions, making a roux, then adding heavy cream. Also used ham because it was on clearance, very nice.

This is the BEST EVER soup. It is now my favorite food. I upped the cheese to 2 1/2 cups, and some of it was sharp cheese. This is really good and it has a tangy "umami" taste to it. I LOVE it. I've never tried a better potato soup, even in the restaraunts. My ONLY complaint is that I can't stay away from it. It deserves 6 stars! PS. Ground pepper-or the smoked kind- is needed!

AMAZING. I had never made homemade soup before, found this recipe and couldn't believe how EASY, QUICK, and DELICIOUS it was! I thought it tasted just like Panera, maybe better! I made it twice recently, the first using half and half the second time substituting milk (forgot to buy half and half), it made a HUGE difference, it was much thinner using milk, do not substitute :)

This can be done by adding mushrooms and thickening it with potatoes being mashed a little or a roux. Seasoning - salt, pepper, garlic powder, or whatever you might want to enhance it. This is bland as is.

I've made this a few times. We always double the recipe because it goes so fast in our house. My wife begs me to make this at least once a month.

I thought this soup was VERY easy to make and quite tasty. I did add a few red pepper flakes. I also used the lower sodium bacon. And I did follow the advice of others and I sauteed the onions and celery with a little bit of the leftover bacon grease. Yummo! :-)

This recipe was introduced to me by my boss at a company function and I liked it so much I asked her to share it with me. After she told me she got it from allrecipes.com I served it at a party I had at home. I served it with the bacon and the shredded cheddar on the side and let everyone top there soup themselves. It was a huge hit and now everyone is asking me where I got the recipe from. Thank you for sharing your recipe with us our family will enjoy this again and again i'm sure. Just a note it dosent seem to taste as good the next day as a leftover. so finish it all.

Great Soup!,  I cut the bacon back a little (12oz), added chopped garlic and parsley.  I agree with other reviewers celery and onion needs to be sauted first.  Certaily feeds more that 10.  Will make again and again.

I made this potato soup in the crockpot and it turned out wonderfully. A great hearty soup for a cold day. Plus- very tasty and didn't need any extra seasoning. I added a bit of cornstarch to thicken it up a bit (probably because of making it in the crockpot), but it was VERY good. Thanks!

I made this recipe for a New Year's Eve party. Everyone LOVED it. One lady said I need to make this every New Year's Eve from now on. One of the guys told me again the next day that it literally is the best potato soup he has ever had. I used Monterrey Jack instead of Cheddar cheese(to avoid annatto food coloring) and sausage instead of bacon because it is what I had on hand. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. We will definitely be making this one again.

If I  had 10 stars  I would give them!   Loved It.  Only substituted one thing and that was the half and half for whipping cream.  I was leary of the cream of mushroom soup but added it anyway and it was awesome.   This also the perfect base for New England Clam Chowder!

WOW! I sauteed the onions and celery, and used the bacon as a topper....IT WAS FANTASTIC! I had unexpected company come in, invited them to stay and they said it was the best potato soup they had eaten.  This recipe makes alot!  It fed 6 adults and a child with at least that much left over.  You will not regret making this recipe!  I PROMISE!!!!!

LOVE IT!  The first time I made this it was OK.  I took out the bacon and put in cubed ham.  Also I added another 1/2 cup of cheese.  YUMMY!  It's now one of our favorites.  Even my picky 4 year old loves it.

We absolutely LOVE this recipe!!  The only change I make is that instead of cutting up celery and adding it, I use cream of celery soup instead of the cream of mushroom!  It is perfect for our family. My 6 and 3 year old girls ask for it often!

I forgot to buy the half and half so I didn't add any to soup and it turned out wonderfully!  I also used a can of cream of celery soup instead of the mushroom as called for in the recipe.  And I did not use as much water to boil everything either.  Instead I used half water and the other half with chicken broth.  My boyfriend says this is a must make!

We tried this soup for one of our weekly dinner parties.  It's a good basic recipe but our improvisation made it better.  To accommodate the vegetarians at the party, we used a whole box of No-Chicken Broth which actually tastes the same and cooks just as well.  For the bacon bits, we served them on the side to use at their own discretion.  We did the same for the cheese because somehow 2 cups was not enough.  When boiling the potatoes, we added plenty of garlic salt, chives, parsley and rosemary which gave the recipe a wonderful flavor.  The cooking time was actually much longer than suggested because the soup resisted thickening.  To give it that thick, creamy consistency we added half a tablespoon of cornstarch and mashed with a potato masher (did the job perfectly and was less to clean).

I love this!  My husband and I practically drink it until we're stuffed!  And then we take it to work for lunch the next day.  I make it in my slow cooker and let it cook all day and then when I come home I put the cream/soup and cheese in.  I skip the bacon, it just doesn't sound too good to me, but I might try throwing in some bacon bits sometime.  I also add 1 carrot just for some color.  We love this a lot!  Have made it twice.

I agree that it's an excellent starting point but I also agree with others on content and cooking - I saute onions, celery, garlic in a little of the bacon drippings until they begin to look clear and are soft but not mush and I do NOT use an entire pound of bacon -- use your personal discretion on garlic, onions, bacon etc. - if you love em use more, not so much use less. I boiled the potatoes then rough mashed about half of them putting them back into a cup of the potato liquid (for the starch) added 2 cups of chicken broth (use more broth or water if it's needed to cover everything) and put the veggies in with the potato mixture let simmer, add a pint of half and half (or heavy cream), a regular can of cream of mushroom soup - salt and pepper to taste at this point - let it get slow bubbly hot again and slowly add as much milk as you like - less for thicker soup more for thinner soup - when it is nice and bubbly add cheese ( I used Colby, Swiss and sharp cheddar combined) when the cheese is melted stir in 8 ozs of sour cream and bacon - garnish as desired.  It is heavenly.

I have tried many potato soup recipes and liked them all, but this one was really the best ever! My husband loved it. I sauted celery, green onion and a clove of minced garlic in a little butter and sprinkled on salt, pepper, thyme, and parsley as others suggested. I used the same large nonstick skillet/wok to add in the potatoes (peeled) and brown them a little bit, as I have another recipe that has you do this and I like having the potatoes slightly browned. I used one packet of the new Knorr homestyle chicken stock concentrate dissolved into 3and a half cups boiling water, was just the right amount of liquid for the recipe size. I also used 4 cheese mexican grated cheese instead of cheddar. I left out the bacon since I don't eat meat and it was still wonderful! I will be making this one often.

OMG, this is wonderful!!!  I used fat free milk, and low fat cheese.  only had about 6 pieces of bacon, so I crumbled that on top of the soup.  Lordy, this was GOOD!!  Used no celery, but used celery salt, since I HATE the texture of celery. Actually halved potatoes, but used full amount of other ingredients.  After taters were done cooking, I smashed them with a ricer right in the pot, and that made the soup really nice and thick.  WOW - I'm wishing I had some left for breakfast this morning!!  This is definitely a keeper -

This recipe tasted so good and it was so easy to make. I used real bacon bits and added a little flour to thicken it. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This recipe is great! The only thing is that I sauteed the celery and onions in bacon fat, (real healthy, I know) and thickend the soup with instant mashed potatoes. Turned out fantastic!!!!!!!

Good Golly!!!! This is the BEST Potato soup we've ever had!!! We sauted in butter flavored pam instead of butter or grease. We used one can of real bacon bits (less fat) and topped each bowl with reduced fat sharp cheddar and chopped green onions. Yummy!!!!

I followed some reviewers advice and sauteed onions and celery in the bacon grease.i also removed one third of the liquid after cooking potatoes before adding half and half.i am glad I did or it would have been too runny.i also do not like cream of mushroom soup and substitute it in any recipe.i used cream of onion.i didn't use a whole onion since I was going go use cream on onion soup because I did not want to have overpowering onion flavor.i also added a big of the bacon grease that I had drained.i was very impressed with how good this tastes. I am a novice cook so I was double impressed that I was able to make something so delicious

Was easy and delicious. I also sautéed the onion and celery in addition to a clove of garlic. I used cream of celery soup,  half whole milk/heavy whipping cream and added chives. The bacon and cheese were added to the bowl as desired.

I ended up saving part of the bacon to add to each individual bowl, as this recipe made SOO much.  I did the same thing with the cheese.  Also used fat free half and half to save calories.  I used the real bacon bits to do the same.  This recipe turned out amazing in the crock pot, although it is HUGE.  LOL definitely share.

it's perfect. the only tweak that makes it even more perfect is to put your soup into a blender on lowest setting for just a moment, like a couple of blinks, before you add your cream and cheese... you tell me

This was my first time to ever make potato soup, and I was amazed at how easy and delicious this recipe was.  I read the reviews beforehand and took the advice to sautee the onion and celery in the bacon grease before adding them to the soup.  I also topped with the bacon instead of adding it to the soup to keep it from getting soggy.  It tasted absolutely amazing, and the kids LOVED it.  Will definitely make again!

i used a can of cream of mushroom soup and what i had in the fridge: a cup of milk, an entire stalk of celery, an onion, a small bag of baby potatoes, 6 oz of bacon. I omitted the cheese because the soup alone was decadent enough for me. I recommend frying the bacon first and using the bacon drippings to saute the onion, celery and potatoes. I only used 3 chicken bouillon cubes, covered the veggies in water and let it come to a boil. I turned the heat down to medium and added the milk, cream of mushroom soup and chopped bacon. I let it all simmer for another 20-30 minutes. DELICIOUS!!! Didn't need any extra salt because the veggies were cooked in the bacon grease

I have made this twice and both times made some very different changes. The first time, I omitted the cheese but added nutritional yeast and garlic and broccoli. It was great. The second time I used the cheese but added one grated carrot and 1/2 pack of baby bella mushrooms to the saute before adding the ingredients. Great again! Neither time did I use bacon because do don't eat it and it was not missing in the taste department in my opinion. A keeper recipe and I think the secret is the mushroom soup. I tasted it right before adding it and it...big difference.

world's best is not an exaggeration. well, at least it's the best I've had.  I prefer to use cream of celery though- the mushroom is a little deep for this soup. Plus, I added some cooking wine and dried parsley to finish it off.

Being a big fan of potato soup in winter I tried this one. Excellent!!! As is. Kept the potatoes unpeeled because we like them better that way. I didn't saute the vegetables so there would be more texture. And yes after cooking it was a little soupy, so I lightly sprinkled in some potato flakes and it was perfect. I've tried other recipes here and the only other potato soup that's equally delicious is the Slow cooker easy potato soup. Different, but still killer good. I'm finished trying other recipes, these two are all I'll ever need.

This soup is delicious!  The only changes I made were that I sauteed the onions and celery in butter before adding to the soup and used real bacon bits instead of cooking the bacon myself. Everyone in the family loved it. I will certainly make this again.  Thank you for the recipe.

Delicious! I took a bowl to work for lunch & had to end up forwarding this recipe to some of my coworkers!! This recipe is 9 servings and there are 3 people in my family...the next day all this was gone!!...:). Will definitely be making this more often. Think it will be great especially with colder weather months!

Great recipe.  I used suggestions of other reviews.  Sauteed onions and celery in olive oil.  Peeled the potatoes.  I boiled the potatoes maybe a little too long to evaporate some of the water, but still turned out good.  Used thick bacon and put the half and half and roasted garlic mushroom soup in the frying pan used for bacon and added mrs dash herb and garlic then poured  soup mix into potatoes and probably added 2 1/2 cups of cheese.  Everyone loved it!

Soup was very good and filling. I sauteed the celery and onion as someone else suggested. The only thing I would to different Is peel the potatoes. Personal preference.

I loved this soup.  I made a few substitutions based on what I had at home.  I used shallots instead of an onion as I just bought some at the farmers market, I also used a can of evaporated milk in place of the half and half, I put half of the bacon in the soup and kept the rest reserved for garnish, a couple dashes of natures seasoning salt and I added half a packet of dry ranch seasoning for additional flavor.  Topped it off with green onion, bacon crumbles and cheese.  Mmm I will make it again!

Okay guys this isn't homemade but it's hands down a keeper. Made it last night. Double Recipe. sort ta. Used 5 lbs potatoes, quart of half and half, large pinches of parsley and thyme. no salt. Used family size Campbell mushroom soup, one stick butter and only 1 lbs bacon. When it appeared that it was going to be thin added 1/2 cup of instant mashed potato. Made a large crock pot full. Put it out at my VFW and they all had at least one bowl almost had to beat them off. This is a great basic fast tasty potato soup. Before you knock it, try it, adjust it if you want you will like it.

I love the idea of this soup, but could not bring myself to make it as written. Six bouillon cubes would make this waaayyyy too salty and not add much to the overall flavor. Instead, I used low sodium chicken broth in place of the water called for and NO bouillon cubes at all. As for the onions and celery, to create a more complex flavor, I sauteed them in a little bit of extra virgin olive oil (and added 2 cloves fresh, minced garlic), then added the potatoes and continued on with the recipe as written. To lighten this up, I often add whole milk in place of the half and half. I have also done a roux to thicken it, using skim milk. I also often add fresh, sliced mushrooms and on occasion, whole, sweet kernel corn for just a slightly different taste and texture to the potato soup.

Excellent used this as our favorite recipe for years.   When I'm in a hurry I use a 32 oz bag of diced hashbrown potatoes instead of cutting up potatoes I do every thing else the same turns out perfect

I followed this recipe exactly as written. But I did make the mistake of adding just a tiny bit of salt, which I regretted because I think the bouillon and bacon made it salty enough. The taste was a bit bland. It tasted more like the chicken bouillon than anything else. If I ordered this in a restaurant I would be pretty disappointed. Needless to say, my search continues for the perfect potato soup recipe.

I've tried several different potato soup recipes over the years and I will have to say this is one of the best recipes so far. Also, it was so simple to make without much preparation which is great for our busy family.  This one will go to the top of my 'soup' list for sure!  And I didn't change or add one thing - you don't need to!

This recipe is definitely a winner for me!! Of course everyone thinks they can make your recipe better. I did take a few suggestions though. i sauted my red onion, celery and fresh mushrooms that i added in the bacon fat while the potatoes and boullion started cooking besides that i followed the recipe. i for got to add the cheese at first and i though it was delicious. after i added the cheese i alomst wish i would have omitted it. it was still very good but the sharpness of the cheese agve it bite. This is the second time ive made this and i will be making it again. Great comfort food.

This probably is the ultimate potato soup.  But I'm not a potato soup fan.  I made it to please the crowd at a soup contest at my sister's house.  It was complimented but didn't win.

Really great recipe to start with. I made some changes per other's reviews: Sauted the onion and celery in bacon grease before adding it to pot, as well as added some other seasonings such as garlic salt, fresh-ground pepper, and thyme. I also sauted minced garlic in the bacon grease, put it in the pot, and added half the chopped bacon back to the fry pan after the garlic and that really made the bacon taste even better. I used the garlic bacon as topping for the soup after it was all done - we liked the crispiness of it. My husband was craving potato soup and was very pleased with this, as was I!

Very good, thanks for the recipe.  The only thing I changed was to saute the celery and onions in a small amount of the bacon grease.  I also used golden mushroom soup instead of regular cream of mushroom, because it's what I had.

I used the bacon ends and pieces and topped it with some green onions. (I had also used the suggestions and added salt, pepper, garlic, and sauted the onions and celery) It's an excellent soup! My two year old loves it too!

great recipe! i made a few changes, nothing major though. i used cream of celery soup instead of actual celery or mushroom soup. also, bouillons and bacon make this VERY salty so no need to add salt.

I agree - the World's Best Potato Soup! I am veggie so I replaced the bacon with grilled and cubed Halloumi cheese and also added some sliced avocado just before eating it. I used semi skimmed milk instead of the half and half and left the cheese out entirely (because I'd added Halloumi) and it was heaven. I will certainly be making it again!

This is wonderful and very easy. Had no problem with it thickening. Do agree that you need to mash a few potatoes up to thicken.  Do try this. You won't be disappointed.

This was a tasty soup... Although, I should have read the other suggestions and used the bacon grease for the onions and celery.  I agree with the others when they said the soup was too thin.  I actually drained some of the water... added more half/half and some cornstarch to thicken it.  I also added a can of corn.  When I make this again I think I will wait until the soup is done to add the bacon... (I like it crispy)...  I served it with Italian bread and it was perfect for a cold winter day!

Awesome!!! This is the first potato soup I made. But the best potato soup my family and I have ever had.  I did sautee the onion and celery in with the bacon, and put half of the potatoes in a blender then added back to the soup.  Very thick and hearty. This is one we will use again.

I made it into a potato and broccoli soup.  It came out very delicious although my partner thought it wasn't thick enough.  Since we don't eat pork, I omitted bacon.  I served it in a sourdough bread bowl on a chilly day.  It was perfect!  I will definitely make it again.

A great soup that i will definitely be making again! Like other reviewers i would say that the best consistency for this soup is obtained by liquidizing helf of the soup when its done. Also, i think the recipe has it right on the salt (or lack of it), as the bacon adds all the salt you need.

This soup is wonderful! I made it for my family for lunch today since it's a little chilly. I added some sour cream and chopped green onion, and my family absolutely loved it. My mother in law asked for the recipe :) I doubt I'll ever be using another potato soup recipe .

I just tried this recipe and it was very good. I had recently tried a cup of potato soup at one of our local restaurants and it was so good that I had hoped to find a similar recipe.  This recipe came close to that and was easy to make.  I didn't need to change a thing, and it turned out really well.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I fixed this soup for my son, who had just had surgery, and he loved it and I have been fixing it ever since. I usually add just a little more cheese. This is absolutely our favorite soup.

This soup is so good I made it three times within a month!  I peeled half of the potatoes because my kids don't like peels and I also used 12oz. of bacon as suggested in other reviews and it was perfect.  Added extra sharp cheddar cheese and this was the best soup I've ever made!
This has to be one of the best recipe sites for people who love to cook, I can't hardly make anything without using this site for a great new recipe.  Thanks Elizabeth!!

The soup was good but not as thick or as creamy as I had hoped.  The ingredient list called for 8 potatoes -- how big and what kind?  Instructions said--enough water to cover, again that may not be specific enough and so my soup was watery.

Loved it! I cut the recipe in half and used 10.75 oz of evaporated milk instead of half and half. I left out the celery and added mushroom. I used another review that stated to saute onion and mushroom with spices and white wine. Excellent. I didn't have much cheddar so I mixed it with mozzarella. It needed much more cheddar. I also didn't have bacon so I put in the remaining bacon bits that we had (approx 1 tablespoon). Even though I cute the recipe in half it could feed us for 2 - 3 days.

The was AWESOME. I have never been a fan of the condensed soups, so I was a little hesitant at first, but this came out great. No one would have known had they not seen the can. ;)
I added a little salt to pick up what the bacon didn't quite cover, and pepper. That's it. Excellent recipe and better the next day.

Excellent recipe!!!  I loved it!  I omitted the bacon because I didn't have it and I didn't even miss it.  I also scaled the recipe down to 4 servings and it still made enough for lots of leftovers tomorrow.  To make a thicker consistency I mashed the potatoes in the soup.  Gave it a real good texture.  Overall great taste and very easy to make.

I craved potato soup the entire day and had a recipe in mind to use. I didn't have all the ingredients so did a quick search and found this. I wasn't sure how this would turn out. Some of the ingredients made me skeptical, however, this soup was a hit! I asked my husband if this was a keeper and he said DEFINITELY! My daughter said it was the best soup I ever made. Very good to warm you up on a cold night!

This is one of three potato soup recipes I fancied trying but I don't think I'll bother with the other two! This is a GREAT!! I omitted the celery as my husband doesn't like it, and used a mixture of heavy cream and milk as I didn't have half-and-half. I wanted a creamier, less chowder-like consistency so I smooshed the mixture with a potato masher. Tasty, hearty and warming. Thanks, Elizabeth!

By using the suggestions in the reviews this became a 5 star recipe. Otherwise I would've only given it a 3. I took the advice of others and sauteed the celery and onions with mushroom (use wild mushrooms if you can) salt, pepper, parsley, thyme, and 1/2 - 1 cup of white wine. Also I doubled the amount of cheese. I then reserved about half of the potatoes from the soup and added the rest to my food processer and mixed it in there. Then I added the reserved potatoes, the bacon ans a cup of whipping cream to thicken and heated it again.  By far the best soup I have ever had, thanx for the great recipe my entire family LOVES IT!!!

Really yummy!  I had to add more boullion, salt and sugar.  Maybe I'm a taste junkie though.  This made tons!  My husband loved it!  I would have given it 5 stars but I had to add seasoning and my husband thought it would be better with crispy bacon served on top instead of inside the soup.  That's probably just personal preference though.  Thanks alot for a yummy recipe!  I'll be making this one again and again.

This soup really is the world's best! Very, very, easy to make and so delicious. This is a restaurant quality potato soup. Like other reviewers suggested I sauteed the celery and onions with thyme before adding. Will definetly be making this awesome soup again.

Fantastic. We didn't have bouillon cubes, so we used 2 cans of Swanson chicken broth+ 1/2 a can of water, and it was great. There's only 3 of us in the family, one of whom is only 3, and this made a huge pot of soup-and there was NONE leftover. We were stuffed! Thanks for the great recipe!

I love this soup, easy to make and ready to serve in a short period of time. I’ve made this so many times and we love it. I leave out the bacon, but other than that I make it as written.

This is my three teen children's favorite thing I make, hands down. All their friends have me give their Mom's the recipe.   I change NOTHING about the recipe, and it is delicious.  I often take this to people who are not feeling well or just to friends when I make a double batch, and everyone loves it.  I am sure it is still good with other things added, but the recipe is wonderful exactly as written.

This soup was awesome.  I did use beef bouillon instead of chicken and cream of mushroom with roasted garlic soup the second time I made it and it was just as good.

Yes, I added mushrooms, also I would suggest not to use too much of the bullion. Too salty, other than that it is tasty

Very good soup!  I sautéd the celery & onion in a couple TBSP margarine before adding potatoes, half and half & cooked bacon, and water (I added 1 can chicken broth and rest water to cover potatoes).  Great comfort food for a cold day.  Family all enjoyed and will make again!

I peeled the potatoes. I added garlic and leeks, which I sauteed in butter before adding the rest of the ingredients. I also added a little cayenne and some bacon fat. A pound of bacon seemed a bit much, so I reduced this to about 1/2 a pound. I will definitely make this again with these changes, as it was delicious.

Like others have stated, I think slicing fresh mushrooms and using roux as a thickener produces a much better result  than resorting to a canned gelatinous blob. I had a red bell pepper lying around, so that was diced and went in to provide some color and a bit more flavor. I also snipped a few pieces of green onions on the top to garnish the bowls.

Made it tonight. Left out the cream of mushroom soup, it tastes too metallic to me. Added a bit more cheese. It was great. It’s going on my winter soup menus.

The flavor was good, but it definitely wasn't the best I've ever made. I added some corn starch to thicken it up some because it was way too watery. Still wasn't creamy enough for our tastes.  I also added salt and pepper to taste. I won't make this recipe again.

The recipe does not call for salt, pepper, parsley or any other seasonings and it does not say what to do with the other half of the POUND of cooked bacon.  I think a half pound of bacon would do.

I followed the recipe plus some of the recommendations from other reviews such as sautéed the celery and onions in butter before adding them to the pot. Yum! It is certainly a meal you could enjoy with leftovers as well.

Went over well with my family. If you like it thicker I suggest making a butter and cheese roux and add to the soup. We added sour cream a dollop of sour cream to our bowls and was delicious.

Sooooooo good! When I make again, I probably will sauté the onions and celery as suggested by others who have made it. My celery needed to cook a little bit more after my potatoes were done. Such great flavor!

I have never made potato soup before and I followed this recipe step by step. The  only thing I did differently was take out about a cup of water and it made it creamier. It was the best potato soup I have ever tasted. I shared it with family and friends and they were completely impressed and enjoyed it as much as I did. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Great base.....did as some suggested....added  garlic, black pepper, parsley, thyme and mushrooms.1 cup of cheddar and 1 1/4 cups Swiss. Substituted low sodium chicken broth for water and used 8 ounces of portabello creamy mushroom soup for the cream of mushroom. I almost forgot, I also only used half the amount of bacon, and substituted diced ham for the missing amount of bacon. 
Was super deeeeelish!!

I did alter this recipe a bit but only because of what I did and didn't have on hand.  I didn't have a whole pint of half and half, so I added a can of Campbell's cheddar cheese soup with the cream of mushroom.  I only had 4 large potatoes, so at the very end, I was simultaneously roasting chicken and threw some breast meat in because I like a thicker soup.   It was a good recipe but I did add quite a bit of black pepper in at the end.  It was just a bit bland for us.  Thanks for sharing the recipe, it was an easy base and pretty versatile to throw some left overs together into something yummy.

would i make it again.....yes. would i change the recipe.....somewhat. 1. no bouillion cubes. since i made this soup for 6 people.....it called for 4 3/4 bouillion cubes. i changed it to 4 3/4 cups of salt free chicken stock, otherwise it would be too salty. 2. NO CREAM OF MUSHROOM SOUP. i took 1 cup of cooked potatoes, mashed them, and put them back in the pot as the thickener.

I've been searching for years for a fantastic potato soup recipe.  No recipe ever hit the mark...then I found this recipe.  By far THE BEST potato soup I have ever made, a definite keeper!  The only real change I made was to add 3 cups of shredded carrots and cut the bouillon cubes down to 3 from 6.   6 cubes is just way too much sodium for anyone.  I also jazzed it up with extra old white cheddar instead of regular cheddar. I always use red potatoes for everything as they have so much more flavour and they don't need to be peeled...and finally, I find the Applewood Thick Sliced Bacon from Walmart is the best kind of bacon to use.  Can't get enough of this soup!

Im not really a fan of this recipe, mostly because the potato is unpeeled and i don't like that. I wish I had peeled them before adding them.  Also, I added the bacon after it finished so that the bacon didn't get soggy. It also seemed to be missing a lot of depth due to the lack of spices. I had to doctor it up.

My family and I love this soup.  I do put some white wine in it.  We put the cheese and bacon on the top after. Yum.  I have made this twice and will make it again and again.

This has easily become a favorite soup for me and my family- my husband wants me to make it all the time and our friends are requesting it every time we have a gathering. I followed the advise of one review and sauteed the onion and celery first- I also added a little fresh garlic, about 1+ cloves. Everything else I followed pretty much as indicated in the original recipe. Great soup! I served this dish with grilled steak each time but will try with grilled chicken next time I make it.

It could've been good (I followed exactly except didn't have an onion) & it was just too salty with the boullion cubes!

Good soup. Left out the celery & mushroom soup. Used heavy whipping cream, added chives & fresh mushrooms (some of our favorite baked potato toppings). Came out great & didn't take too long to cook! I also smashed some of the potatoes after they softened.

My husband and I love this recipe.  I have made twice.  Only thing I did diffently the second time was add some fresh carrots and cooked my celery a little bit before because the celery was too crunchy for one of my friends. :-)

Great bones...
I really love this soup and my husband loved it too! He is not easily sold. I used the advice of other members and added Garlic and fresh mushrooms. I sautéed the garlic,onion,celery and mushrooms in the bacon grease and added that to the potato water. I also added a half of cream cheese to help thicken the soup when I added the cheese.
The spices I used were garlic salt, thyme, ground coriander, parsley and lots of ground pepper. Delicious!! I am the type of cook who adds a little of this and that...whatever I have on hand and this is a keeper recipe.

This will now be my go-to potato soup recipe!  A few minor changes: I seasoned it the way I like to season potato soup, and I also took my masher and gave it a few mashes to make sure it was thick enough.

Didn't add cream of anything soup, used low sodium chicken stock, sautéed onions and celery in butter, with 6-7 baby carrots chopped fine.  Put in crock pot on high for 7 hours--pureed some to thicken the rest.  Used chunks of a ham steak.  Added crispy bacon and scallions on top when serving.  Very good.  Potatoes were actually too well done, next time, I'll cook on low.

This was so flavorful and delicious.  A very inexpensive  and hearty meal. And extremely easy to make.   I added pepper, extra cheese and some sour cream.  Delicious!  The whole family enjoyed it.

Goodness, that's this soup. I left out the canned soup and added powder bullion instead, also used the new potatoes so I left the skins on. My only complaint was that I didn't make enough, it will be a regular in this house.

It really was wonderful. I never salt anything (medical reasons) and this for me was pucker up salty. I would make it again for the rest of the family.

This potato soup is absolutely delicious. One of my co-workers brought in a large crock pot full with all the trimmings (we added green onions) and the pot was empty after lunch. We bugged him for the recipe and he said he got it here. I look forward to making the soup for a rainy or snowy day. It is fantastic!

I've made this several times now and forwarded this to several friends and received VERY good reviews.  It's EASY, don't even have to peel the potatoes and it is very tasty.  Add a salad and you have a meal.

Truly is World's Best Potato Soup!  I did as another suggested and sautéed ingredients in 1/2 cup white wine.  Rather than doing this in a stock pot, I used the electric pressure cooker for much faster soup!  Pressure Cooked Step 1 for 4 minutes, added remaining ingredients and Pressure cooked for 3 more minutes!  PERFECTION!

Very good.  I think I'll use Velveeta cheese next time because it would add a little extra flavor, I think.  I also added carrots, green beans, and ham and both myself and my hubby really enjoyed this soup.

I have made several potato soup recipe, but I like this one the best.  I followed the directions as written, EXCEPT after boiling the potatoes, I combined everything in the slow cooker and let it simmer for an hour.  I also added a little corn starch to thicken it up.  It was yummy!

The soup is good, but I would suggest subsituting cream of mushroom for cream of potato.. Makes more sense in my opinion. Also, I don't like bacon in the soup because the bacon won't stay crisp, it becomes soggy & flimsy.   Otherwise, follow the recipe sauteeing the veggies first.

This recipe is really good.  As many of people do, I did change a couple of things.  I used Swansons chicken broth instead of boullion cubes and water. I also used 1/2 lb of bacon and used Tillamook shredded mexican cheese instead of all cheddar cheese. I put a couple of dashes of Mrs. Dash garlic and herb in also. Very good. Everyone in the family loved it.  I have put this in my recipe box!!

This soup is AWESOME! I didnt have half and half so I substituted that with milk, and to make up for the thickness, I added a extra can of cream of mushroom soup. This was my first time making a soup, and it was great! thank you!

Delicious! I live with my boyfriend and a roommate. They loved it! I tweaked just two things though. I added two cans of cream of mushroom instead of one. Still used half & half. Also while everything was in the pot almost ready, I took a masher and mashed the potatoes slightly so they were not ALL chunks. Gave it a creamy texture with some chunks as well. Very impressed!

this soup was very yummy! the only thing i would change next time is reducing the salt. i would suggest using one less buillon cube and also low sodium cream of mushroom. salt can also be added later! with that being said, i will definitely be making this again. Oh, and my boyfriend loved it!

Great soup, did adjust it a little. I sauteed the celery and onion in a little butter, used evaporated skim milk rather than half and half or cream.

This is the best potato soup! Total comfort food. I skip the celery-(not a fan). I have tried this soup with various cheeses and it's always a winner! I cheat and use the pre-shredded cheese in a bag to save time.

This is the best, Cook the Bacon and Celery and Onion and Mushrooms sauteed together, leave the grease!!it the will not affect the soup!, enhances the flavor!, do it in a Crock Pot! I use the New Digital GE one with Presets! pick # 7 3 hrs on high and wala!

This is a great recipe.  I would have given it five stars but I thought it needed to be a little thicker.  I did make some changes.  I Fried the bacon and first so I could saute the celery and onions in the bacon grease( I put the bacon on a plate so I could put the bacon in the soup after I had dished it up)I also put carotts in with the celery and onions.  Instead of water I used chicken broth.  I think next time I will just use four cups of chicken broth instead of six.  I also think that I will try cheese whiz instead of the cheddar cheese next time I make this.

This was a good soup, just not our favorite potato soup.  We're still looking for that one, but this one was pretty good.  It was a little thin...that's my biggest complaint.  I hate having to thicken cheesy soups.  In my opinion, they should be creamy and thick without help...but that's just me!  I did saute my onion and celery to help them along a little.  Thanks for posting.  I probably won't make again just because we have a couple of others that we like, but this is a really good recipe, so definitely try it and decide for yourself if it's your "world's best!"

I have used this recipe several times.  I also make a few changes.  Use chicken broth instead of water.  I use cream of celery and cream of chicken soup.  Always put in extra cheese and use the bacon for individual topping.  i think it gets to soggy if you put it in as the recipe calls for.

I have made this recipe several times now for the concession stand at my boys wrestling tournaments.  It is always a huge hit.  People come back to the concession stand asking who made the soup and asking for the recipe.  I "fried" the celery, onion and diced bacon together then added it to the boiled potatoes.  Followed thre rest of the recipe, except, occasional used just milk instead of half and half and gotten just as much appreciation.

This recipe for Potato Soup is delicious! The only changes I made were to chop the onion and celery very fine and saute them in a little of the bacon drippings before adding them to the soup. I only added about a 1/4 cup of the bacon to the soup, the rest went on top when it was served so that it would remain crunchy. I used Cream of Chicken soup and 3 cubes of Knorr chicken boullion. To make it creamy I used a hand blender to puree the soup as a final step. I served it in homemade bread bowls to a group of 12 girls and they couldn't get enough!!

Very good. Very rich! Added italian sausage as well. We decided we liked the bacon better as a topping - you get more of the salty flavor that way. So I cut the amount added to the soup & saved the rest for topping the soup.

This is an amazing QUICK recipe, my entire family, including a 3-year-old, absolutely loved it, asking for seconds and thirds! I served it with cheese tortilla chips, and used velveeta, and monteray jack cheeses in the soup (I didn't have cheddar). Wonderful recipe with several variations!!!!

I made this recipe and I used 2 cans of chicken broth instead of water. I also traded the cream of mushroom for the cream of onion. I did not use a onion due to the soup. Be careful do not add salt the bacon will provide that!!! Other than that it was great!!!

THIS WAS EXCELLENT. MY HUSBAND SAID IT WAS ALMOST AS GOOD AS MY BAKED POTATO SOUP. BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS EVEN BETTER THAN THAT. THANKS FOR SHARING, ELIZABETH.

This was awesome for a new learner, I really impressed with this, I was not crazy about the bacon I think I will leave that out next time, it was really good and even better the next day. Thank you.

I made this tonight and like another person who reviewed this soup this week mine came out a little watery.  It would be nice to have some idea of how many cups of water and how big of potatoes.  It is still very delicious tho!

Thankx Elizabeth, this is wonderful !  My husband made this and it's definitely a make again.  He used 1 quart of homemade chicken broth and made up with water when needed. We have low-sodium chicken bouillon and about a tablespoon was added.   He also used a heaping tablespoon of dried lovage.  Best made a day ahead.

This soup is excellent!  One thing that I may change next time, is that I would peel a couple of the potatoes.  My whole family loved it...and wants the recipe.

The texture of this soup is very thick and creamy, almost stew like. However I did not like the amount of onion in the soup. I personally do not care for onions. It almost seemed like it over powered the soup.

This is delicious soup, made with ingredients I usually have on hand.  I used fat free half and half, healthy request soup, and 1/2 reduced fat cheddar.  Turned out great!

I love potato chowder, and was ready for a new recipe.  I used a lot less bacon (half) and threw some frozen corn in near the end. It was delicious.

WOW!  No question about it, this is the best potato soup ever.  I cut down on the bacon to 1/4 lb. and I used cream of celery soup because that is what I had on hand.  It came out wonderful.  I will make this again and again.

This was my first time making soup and this was a good recipie to start with - easy to make. My husband loved it! Next time I make it, however, I am going to leave the bacon out...it may be that because I am in my first stages of pregnancy that it didn't work for my taste.   I will make it again though, thanks for the posting!
