Wow!  Really good!  I actually made this in the crockpot because I was at work all day.  I cut the sausage up first, browned it on the stove top.  Put the sausage, onions, and peppers in the crockpot.  Then I made the sauce (beer, tomato paste, and seasonings) on the stove in the pan I had used to brown the sausage.  Added the sauce to the crockpot and cooked on low all day.  We made into sandwiches and it had great flavor!

This was a first for me. I have NEVER used beer with my sausage and peppers before. And look what I've been missing all this time! I used 2lbs. spicy Italian sausage, so I left out the hot sauce. I only had 2 each red and green bell peppers, so that's what went in the skillet, along with the 2 onions, 4 cloves of garlic, 1-1/2 cans of beer (I was thirsty), the tomato paste, 2 Tbsp. each of fresh chopped oregano and basil, and a sprinkle of dried parsley. Wouldn't have added cilantro even if I'd have had it. We ate these on Italian bread subs, and they were Oh-so-yummy! Even better for lunch the next day. Thanks, Robert... this recipe is now in my "Tried and True" file.

GREAT Recipe! I made this recipe yesterday. I browned the sausage and removed it from the pan, and added the onions, red peppers, and green peppers  letting them absorb the sauce from the sausages. I removed the onions and peppers from the pan, and added the garlic, beer, tomato paste, 3 tablespoon of hot sauce, 1 tablespoon of oregano and fresh parsley, salt & black pepper. I let it simmer for about 10 minutes and I cut the sausage into bite size added everything back in pan, and continue cooking in low heat for about 45 minutes. I served it with rice. It came out Super! my husband and daughter loved it.
For sure I will do this recipe again. Thanks for sharing.

I must admit that I am not a huge fan of sausage and peppers to begin with-but this recipe has changed my mind for good.  Absolutely delicious.  I felt like I was eating the prize winning sausage and pepper on a roll at the state fair.  It's that good.  Only changes were I only had one onion, used parsley instead of cilantro, and more green pepper than red...I used two thirds sweet and one third hot for the sausage.  I did add a bit more paste than what called for as well.  My husband moaned in satisfaction with every bite-I'm not kidding!
I would suggest using a better grade of sausage-it tends to omit less fat!

Made this for a family gathering and used water instead of beer, since some folks would have freaked out at the hint of alcohol.  Everyone enjoyed it, and next time I'll use beer for sure!  Keep in mind that the success of the recipe depends on the quality of sausage you use.  If you're lucky enough to live in an area with lots of places that make and sell their own sausage,I suggest that you try those varieties over the mass-produced national brands. Some of the national brands have large amounts of salt, fat and preservatives and if you can avoid some of that, you're ahead of the game!

Excellent recipe and fairly easy to make. I cut the recipe in half but used a full can of tomato paste as someone had suggested. I cooked the sausage using my "no oil" method and it came out fine...pierce sausage all over with fork and cook in about 1/4 inch of water. Once the water boils off the sausage will fry in its own fat.

This was really wonderful. I cut the recipe down to 1 1/2 lbs of sausage, 2 red peppers, 1 green pepper, 1 large red onion and 2 small/medium yellow onions. I also used 1 1/2 cans of beer instead of 2. It was wonderful served over penne pasta, and also awesome on italian bread as a sandwich. Thanks for the recipe, Robert!

I cut the recipe in 1/2 for my husband & I and ended up using a Michelob light ultra (which is a low carb beer), that was left over from a summer bash (we didn't care for the taste & what a better way to use it).  I did use the whole 6 oz. of paste, & also used our butchers "medium" Italian sausage (which has a bit of kick to it) .  I didn't cut the sausage up & served it in a sausage bun smothered with the sauce....YUUMMMYYYY!!!!  My taste buds were yelpin!  My picky husband LOVED it!  Thanks very much Robert!

This recipe was extremely tasty!  I'm not a beer drinker and I don't like peppers and onions!  But the flavor was excellent.  I cut up hot and mild sausage and cooked as I always do (in the oven @ 325 in a brown and serve bag for about 40 minutes) then I cut up the onions, peppers, garlic, (used Emeril's hot sauce and Labatt's Blue) and other ingredients and placed in a 4 qt. Nesco roasting oven.  I mixed in the sausage and let simmer for 1 hour on low. (Melt in your mouth tender) Served on a crusty roll with provolone broiled on top in the oven.  Yummy!  Received "this is very good" reviews!

I made this dish on new years for a bunch of friends and it was the hit of the party. I used Harpoon IPA for the beer, and it was fantastic. Any IPA    (India Pale Ale) will do the trick. The only problem i had with this recipe was that the sauce was too thin for me. This is more than likley due to me adding too much beer, so i give this recipe 5 stars.

Pretty good and easy to do.  I like things saucy, so I made the sauce as directed, but only used 1 lb sausage, 2 peppers and 1 onion.  Once it was all cooked up, I added 1 cup of rice and 1 cup of water to the mix and let that simmer for about 30 minutes.  It turned into a nice one pot meal.  Thanks!

I am so not a "cook" by any stretch but people think I am a "chef" when I make this - they love it!  I add chicken breast at the same time the sausage cooks & bring a Chicken Cacciatore touch to this dish.  Awesome Awesome Awesome!  I love this!

Being Italian, would never use cilantro in this recipe,  I use fresh or dried basil and I use white wine.  I brown cut up sausage, deglaze pan with wine, stir in freshly cut up peppers & onions (not browned), cook in tightly covered pan in 350 oven till peppers are cooked, the flavors all blend.  This will keep the shape of the peppers & onions, they won't be overcooked and mushy.  I start with a cup of wine, after 30 min. In oven, uncover and taste, more wine or chicken broth can be added if needed.  I also omit the tomato, we like the white sauce.  I serve this with crusty Italian bread or rolls for sandwich's along with a salad I dress with white wine vinegar & olive oil.  Whatever way you decide to prepare, I'm sure you, family & friends will enjoy.

This is really good. Great thinking Robert. I also added fried potatoes to this, I fried them first in the oil specified and then added the sausage. I must be a Ro-tel queen cause I added a can of Ro-tel instead of tomatoe paste. Didn't use the cilantro. Still turned out really gr8!

I made this for a large group (25 People) and let me tell you I should have made it for 50. It was all gone and the folks were screaming for more. Great receipe, your really deserve "10 Gold Stars" for this one. Thanks for sharing. I will be making this again for a large group in August, I will figure at least half again as much ingredients for this event.

This recipe was very good with lots of flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly.  However, it was a little soupy.  Next time I will reduce the amount of beer and add more tomato paste.  I served the sausage and peppers on crusty french rolls, which tasted awesome!  Next time, I will serve over rice for a different spin on the recipe.

How can people rate a recipe when they change it?
Also if the beer is too nasty to drink why would you want to eat it?

This was out of the WORLD, I cooked it just like it said with two bottles of Heinekena and a whole can of tomatoe paste to thicken the sauce which worked beautifully. This is a terrific keeper to my collection. My husband and my parents said it was great!!!!!

My Dad used to make this when Mom wasn't able to cook.  We three boys looked forward to it with gusto.  That was more than 45 years ago.  Glad to see it's still around and loved.  He called it "slumgullion".

I thought this was great and I don't ever eat sausage, peppers, and onions.  I really liked the sauce (I used Amstel Light).  Changes I made with good results:  used 2 lb hot sausages, 2 small sweet onions, 2 green peppers, 1 red pepper, all of the sauce ingredients (1 1/2 beers) except didn't use fresh herbs.  Used 2 tbsp dried oregano and 1 1/2 tbsp dried parsley.  I might go a little easier on those next time, though.  I like my peppers and onions really mushy so I simmered them for at least an hour.  Thanks for the recipe!  Served over rice but will get hoagie rolls for leftovers.

Overall, this was a good recipe, but unless you have a large family, I would suggest using only half of the meat and cut down the number of peppers as stated in the recipe and use a pot instead of a skillet. I would make this again!

Very very good.  I halved the recipe and used 1 pound of sausages - didn't slice them up but served on hoagie rolls with the pep "sauce" over them.  At the very end of cooking I thickened with a hefty sprinkle of Wondra so it was saucy instead of soupy.  Also used home grown Hungarian peppers as well as bells (half and half) so it had a good kick to it.

My husband loves sausage sandwiches, and would only get them at the fair in the summer.  Since I found this recipe he has it all year around.  I have made this for several football parties we have hosted, and it is always a huge hit!!!

Made it based upon the reviews, and didn't like the taste at all.  I've had sausage and peppers before, and this just didn't taste good to me at all.

We love this on rice! Use the richest beer and multicolor peppers and onions: it will look so pretty.  Ran out of fresh herbs, used freeze dried, but the recipe forgives you.  Smells much better after the beer cooks down. Other people's sausage and peppers seem so bland, greasy, and mushy in comparison.

Great recipe!  Changed it slightly, but still very, very good.  Recipe makes quite a bit and a skillet will be too small.  I recommend using a dutch oven only.  Don't use olive oil, sausage alone makes more than enough oil! I had to drain excess oil in dutch oven after cooking meat because it creates about a half cup of unnecessary grease that doesn't add anything but calories. Leave the blackened bits on the bottom of the pan, they add flavor.  Used 4 peppers, 1 red and 1 vadalia onion. An Italian recipe like this needs more garlic, so I used about 6-7 cloves.  Added 2 12 oz bottles of Miller Lite and 2 cans of tomato paste.  Sauce is much to thin without the second can of paste.  Added extra spices to include basil, italian seasoning and oregano.  Didn't have any fresh so I used dried seasonings.  Omitted the cilantro because I didn't have any at the time.  Doubled the hot sauce and used only hot italian sausage.  Simmered everything at the same time to better incorporate the flavors. Served over bow tie pasta with grated mozzerella and parmesan.  Will also serve on grinder/hoagie rolls.  My family loved it and everyone ate 2-3 helpings!  Passed the recipe with the changes on to my cousin who raved about it!  This is now in my recipe rotation and will stay there.

I've made this recipe quite a few times.  My only alteration is to saute the onions/peppers/garlic before deglazing the pan.  I then remove them, deglaze, and proceed with the recipe.  Everyone usually prefers me to use spicy Italian sausages when I make it.  Thanks for a tasty recipe!

This recipe is tasty, filling and simple.  My boyfriend and I both thoroughly enjoyed eating it with a crusty baguette.  In order to cut some of the bitterness other reviewers mentioned , I added about 3 tbsp of ketchup.  This added a touch of sweetness and rounded out the flavors.  I also sauteed the onion, peppers and garlic in the pan after removing the sausage then after a few minutes added the beer.  I also tried this recipe again using red wine instead of beer, came out fantastic!

This really is the best ever sausage dish.  I use guiness when I make mine.  I also took the advice of one of the other people and fried potatoes in a skillet to add to the dish.  The portion sizes are huge, but I just freeze in the leftovers.

I've made these several times.  I've never put in the cilantro because I never have it, but it's always good.  I serve them on buns with provolone or mozarella. Wish the sauce was a little thicker though.

This is the GREATEST Sausage and Peppers recipe I have ever had. I make it with whatever beer I have on hand and it always comes out good. The only change i've made is I add about 2 tsp. of fennel seed. Once I started it and realized I had no beer, so I used water and I actually really like it that way too. I have made this many times and if it's been 2 weeks since the last time, my 7 year old or husband asks when it's coming up on the menu. Thank you for sharing!

This is so flavorful and delicious! I did not have tomato paste at home, so I reduced a 15 oz. can of tomato sauce instead.  Perfect!

I had to make many changes due to a lack of ingredients here in Prague where we live now, but it still came out pretty tasty. The shop was out of red peppers so I had to use green and yellow ones, and Italian sausages are not abundent in this part of the world so I ended up with a combination of Czech herb and Hungarian paprika sausages. For the beer I used Gambrinus, which is a famous Czech brew. I was a bit worried because of all these alterations but in the end it was quite nice to mop the sauce with baguettes and the sausages worked, too so I guess the recipe is fool proof! Perhaps slightly too garlicy, but it may have just been my oversized cloves. Thanks, we are having the leftovers for dinner.

I followed the recipe and wasn't very excited by the outcome. Not sure what the rave reviews are for, but different strokes for different folks I guess. The sauce this cooks in was bland/lacking and it diluted the flavor of the sausages. I'll try a new recipe going forward, but thanks anyway for the suggestion.

Great recipe! I cut it in half and it still fed 5.  I still used the whole can of tomato paste, and doubled the garlic. Also, I added crushed red pepper.  I used Amstel light, and used a beer and a half. Everyone loved this!

Very good!! Served at a 4th of July party and didn't ahev to grill in the heat. Left the sausages whole, browned them and cooked vegetables and then put all in crock pot and cooked for several hours. Rave reviews from guests. We used hot italian sausages (I thought it was too hot but everyone else loved them hot).

I made this recipe with a few minor changes.  I used hot Italian sausage, a mix of colored bell peppers, white onion and dried oregano, and dried parsley instead of cilantro.  This one surprised me.  I was sure that everything was going to taste like beer, but I couldn’t even taste it in the finished dish.  Both Hubs and I really enjoyed this over pasta, so I’m sure I’ll be making it again!

Just anothr one of those special recipes that make me smile when I go to make it.  Why? Because of it's simplicity,  because of ease in prep and prep time, but mostly becaue of the request to not wait so long to make it again!  Killer!

This was fantastic... I was licking my plate!!  I did make a few changes, as follows:  As per another reviewer, I added chicken along with the sausage. Instead of beer I used home made pasta sauce. Used dried basil and oregano.  It was a little bit like a cacciatore -- absolutely delicious.  Oh yes, sprinkled some Romano cheese on top.

Excellent recipe and great for a party.  I don't like cilantro so I omitted that but everything else was the same.  Just a bit of warning...I made this with the hot sauce as listed and it was very spicy. In fact, I  actually ended up making a second batch without the hot sauce because I was making it for a party and thought it may not appeal to everyone if it was too spicy.  We love the spice - but I would add gradually if you're serving this to others.

Made this for the pre-game tailgate at the Meadowlands for the Jets game.  It was SENSATIONAL!!! I'm going to make it again this week.  I used Sriracha hot sauce which worked really well and a lager.  Next time, I'm going to use an ale which may add even more flavor to this delicious recipe.  Thanks!!!

I prepared this recipe for Super bowl.  Everyone absolutely loved it.  I used fresh mild/sweet Italian sausage and a lager beer.  I also started it on the stove and finished it in a low temp. oven. Served with a brown rice and also sub rolls.  A for sure keeper of a recipe. thanks for sharing.

I made this tonight per recipe, except for the following.  First, I put in a 16-oz can of diced tomatoes.  Second, when I cook sausage and peppers I usually cook them for a long time on a low heat, so I added more beer whenever the mixture got dry.  (Since the recipe uses cilantro and hot sauce, I went with a Mexican beer).  These are very, very good sausages and peppers.  The cilantro isn't overpowering, and the hot sauce doesn't take over the dish.  The only "difficulty" I had was that the recipe I printed off makes a lot of this, a WHOLE lot.  So I had to divide and cook it in two large pans (my pans are about 16" diameter).  This will be great on pasta, in a sandwich, or just to eat on its own.  I highly recommend it.  Thanks very much for contributing it!

I was really worried when I made this, because after I poured the can of beer in, the smell of the beer and veggies cooking was gagging me (I used Heineken, might use a different beer next time). I made it for a birthday party, and I thought I might have ruined 6 lbs of sausage.  But soon the beer smell cooked off, and I added the tomato paste and red hot sauce.  It was absolutely wonderful!  I will always cook them this way.  They were the 1st thing gone at the party, and everyone loved them.  You couldn't even tell there was beer in it.

We loved this recipe!  I used chorizo sausages (what we had in the house) and they tasted wonderful, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It was very flavorful and tasty. Next time, I might use just 1 tablespoon of hot sauce to make it slightly less fiery. This is a keeper.

Halved the recipe. Added one jalepeno and one hot red chile pepper to substitute the hot sauce. Had to use a bit of corn starch to thicken due to the beer thinning the sauce excessively. All that being said, very tasty and hearty dish. Saved and will make again.

I made this a few nights ago, I used 1.5lb of sweet ita sausage, 1 1/2 cans of a light beer, 1 full can of tom paste, 1 red onion and 2 red peppers with 3 cloves garlic and the recommended spices.  I tossed this over a full lb of pasta.  I thought it had a great flavor and did not take long at all to prepare which is always key!! Not to "soupy" at all, in fact it worked quite well as a pasta sauce!

I made this exactly as instructed except I substituted basil for the cilantro and used only 2 red bell peppers, no green peppers, and one red onion.  Also, I used 3 lb hot Italian sausage and no hot sauce.  We used Shiner Bock beer.  

The sauce was thin, bitter, and far, far too "bell pepper-y" in flavor.  We fished out the sausages and will use them in sandwiches, with spaghetti sauce, kind of like a meatball sub.  But my husband complains about the waste of two beers and I'm sad I wasted the peppers and onion.  Sorry, I know I'm swimming upstream on this one!

Good basic, I am italian and my family makes this with sweet or hot sausage, olive oil, onion& peppers and potatoes. Salt and pepper to taste, cover for 15 min to cook potatoes then take the top off and let it brown up a little. Serve with crusty italian bread-Hubbys favorite dish.

Very good recipe! Both myself and my boyfriend enjoyed it! I was only cooking for two so I halved the recipe, and I still have leftovers for lunch tomorrow. I completely forgot the garlic but we did not miss it. I used dried oregano because I did not have fresh. I did not have tomato paste, but I used about a cup and a half of tomato sauce thickened with corn starch, and it worked out just fine. The beer I used was Redhook ESB... added excellent flavor! I will make this again! Thanks Robert!

This is a wonderful recipe; thanks so much for sharing!

I used lean turkey Italian sausage (1 pound hot, and 3 pounds sweet) to cut some of the calories and fat, and it was still amazing.  I'm a fan of dark beers, so I used Deschutes Brewery's Black Butte Porter, which is a smooth brown porter.  

Other than subbing turkey sausage for regular sausage, I kept this recipe as is, and will definitely be making it again.  I live with all men, and this was a huge hit with them as well!  (They couldn't tell I used turkey sausage, so I think I can chalk that one up to a victory.)

Great recipe!  I skipped the cilantro (I thought I had some in the fridge) and used some Full Sail Wassail which is somewhat of a rich malty beer and it worked really well.  Will definitely try it again!  Thanks!

Ok, let me start by saying that based on flavor, I would give this 5 stars... based on whether it looked like the picture, it deserves 4.  The pic makes it look like it turns into a true spaghetti sauce texture... I could not get it there... it was very soupy.... but, despite that, the flavor was fabulous!  We served it over rice and have leftovers :)  Any suggestions to make this sauce thicker?

Yum!  I made only a few changes for 2lbs of sausage:  Used one 12 oz bottle of beer, one whole can tomato paste, 1 habanero pepper in place of the hot sauce, added a portobello mushroom, and omitted the cilantro.  It was delicious; more italian in flavor than would have been with the cilantro.  I cooked it in a roasting bag in my crockpot for 4 to 5 hours on high.  Will definately make this again!!

I was very interested in trying this recipe. I changed the olive oil to canola oil and oregeno to italian seasoning. I did not think that my wife would like it but she said it was excellent and of course I enjoyed it. My son however, did not like the vegies but he ate all the meat I gave him. I used Budweiser

This was totally delicious.  I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of the beer (I'm just a little pregnant) and it still turned out so very yummy.  The flavors blend so well, the cilantro and garlic are excellent.  I added some crushed red pepper for some zing (abour two teaspoons) and it was great.  Served over rice and my picky husband LOVED it!  Thanks Robert for a delish recipe!!

This was excellent!!!  I made it on spur of the moment last night and didn't have all the ingredients on hand and it was still fabulous!!  I didn't have any peppers on hand so I only used onions, and I had no tomato paste so I just used some tomato sauce instead.  I also cut the recipe in half.  I served it over top of some Italian rolls and it was delicious!  My husband loved it too, and he's a pretty hard sell when it comes to new recipes!  I will definitely be making this again (and again, and again...).  It's a keeper!

I made this for dinner last night with Italian Sweet Sausage. Made it exactly as written, but left off the Cilantro... although I had some, I read the last review and so left it out.
My family LOVED IT !!!! I served it over cooked elbow macaroni, with a sprinkle of shredded Parmesan, lots of good French Bread to soak up the DELICIOUS JUICE !!!!! ALL my sons and my husband (me too:-) ) had seconds, it was the bomb !!!!

I made this tonight and my family loved it.  Followed some of the hints from others, thickened the sauce at the end with some cornstarch, and served over grilled garlic bread.  I used Bluemoon beer and fresh sausage from the local Italian deli.  A keeper for sure.

I often make a similar version of this with just a couple cans of tomato sauce and serve it over rice. It's always delicious and kids like it too.  The beer sounds like a nice change, I'll have to try it.
P.S.  This is a HUGE recipe!!

Darn good stuff!  I also added in chicken after browning and cubing like I did the sausage. My only change to the recipe would have been skip or use 1/3 of the tomato paste.  I might add another bottle of beer in that case.  But that is my personal taste.  I used only 2 lb of meat and still had plenty for leftovers after dinner for 2 hungry adults. Thanks!

Reduced the sausages by half (only because of the amount of people I was feeding!) but kept all else the same.  Simmered in sauce for close to an hour and it had the perfect taste and consistancy.  I think the results with beer is far better than the wine used in past.  Thanks much!

I swear I have tried them all and this is the best yet.....I followed the recipe exactly and it truly is outstanding.... The peppers add so much flavor and I have never used beer before and if that added to the flavor it was great.  Thank you for sharing

This was by far the best Sausage and Pepper recipe I've ever made. No grease and it was very tasty. My husband loved it as did my daughter! I made it for a company function, increased the recipe in order to serve 21 and it worked great. One change I did make was that I used half Turkey Sausage and half regular sausage. Tasted great!

fabulous! i made this for a few friends and my bf and we all loved it. i made some variations. First, i cut the recipe in half, but i only had 3/4 lb sausage so i used that and 3/4 lb of chicken. I used one can of coors light.  I threw everything in the crock pot, set it on low for 8 hours and served it over brown rice. Very easy and delicious!

"IF" this is not the "Best Ever Sausage with Peppers, Onions, and Beer", I have no idea what is. I made this yesterday for a Family gathering of 30 in all age groups. It was a Hit! My Wife prepared everything else, must have been 10 other dishes prepared. Somehow it seemed as if I got all the credit for my tiddly little bit in preparing this dish. It was eaten by it self, over rice and on rolls. 
Thank you Very Much for this recipe.
I did not have and could not find any fresh Oregano. I replaced with 1 tablespoon dry Oregano and 2 tablespoons fresh chopped Basil.

OK, so I dont even like peppers & I loved this dish!!!!!!!!!  I sliced everything very thin, I used 2 green, 1 orange, 1 yellow & 2 red peppers.  Such pretty colors.  Instead of hot sauce, I added hot pepper flakes to the EVOO before I added the meat.mmmm so good..Also I didnt add Cilantro, just didnt sound good to me in this recipe & I love cilantro.  I served on toasted & garlic buttered hoagie rolls....Goes great with an ice cold beer!!!

Wow, this was really good!  I've never managed to make sausage and peppers that tastes as good as at the fair....until this.  I scaled down the recipe slightly (a little over 2 lbs of sausage, 1 bottle of beer) but used the whole can of tomato paste.  I also replaced the cilantro with parsley because the idea of cilantro in this recipe just didn't appeal to me.  Other than those changes I followed the recipe as provided.  I used a combination of sweet and hot italian sausage from a local butcher and simmered it for almost an hour to really let the flavours blend and the sauce thicken somewhat.  I served it on hoagie rolls and plan to have the leftovers over pasta for lunch tomorrow.  (And then probably freeze the rest, since this recipe makes a LOT of food.)

Awesome recipe. We always get these great sausage in a bun sandwiches topped with peppers, onions and a terrific sauce at our state fair.  Never could figure out what made them so good - now I know.  Left out the cilantro also. Thank you.

Not bad at all.  I used a Chicken Sausage to cut down on the fat and a light beer.  Next time I think I'll make a tad more sauce to really saturate the rice though.  Good recipe!

Not sure what I did wrong with this one, but I didn't care for.  I cut the sausage into one inch pieces, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  Too much grease for me and I found the flavor to be very bitter.  Maybe I'll try again with a different beer? Thanks for sharing.

Interesting.  Like other reviewers - it has a distinct taste, however it didn't really spark my tastebuds.  I made it exactly as written and served it over bowtie pasta, but I think that I could achieve a similar effect with a jar of roasted pepper spaghetti sauce and italian sausage.

I was asked to make this for a get together by a friend who'd had it in the past.  As it turns out the "beloved Italian mother" of the group also brought sausage and peppers!  I was terrified!  I hope she didn't noticed that mine was gone before hers was :}

This was so unbelievably good I was amazed. Bravo Mr. Catalano.  My Italian family loved it too.  The only thing was my poor husband suffers from heart burn something terrible which I completely forgot about so next time I will add just a pinch of baking soda to help him out a bit.

I am not a beer drinker...can't stand the taste
of it...but this recipe is fantastic!  I even used the entire l6 oz. bottle to make more sauce
because I was serving it over rice.  It did not
taste like beer after the flavors all blended
together. If I serve it over rice again, I will probably use tomato sauce instead of paste.

I thought this recipe was great. I tried a second time and added a bit more tomato paste and olive oil to make a thicker sauce and reduced the amount of beer a little. I also took the advice of some others and added some tabasco to spice it up.  I really enjoyed it and would ake it again.

I scaled this recipe down to 4 servings.  I was a little hesitant about the beer, because we only had Corona.  However, it tasted great!  I only used 1 bottle instead of the 1 and 1/3, and I also added a can of stewed tomatoes as well.  I didn't have red peppers, I used green.  This was a delicious dish!  While eating, my husband asked me how I made the sauce.  When I told him, he said "very good...it doesn't taste like your typical sauce!  I also like the bite it has to it."  I also added some red pepper flakes and some red ceyenne pepper too for some extra "zing" (and because I used sweet sausage not the hot and we like some hotness).  Anyway, thanks for this wonderful recipe!  We LOVED it! I will definately be making this again! :)

I made this for a football game party, and EVERYONE enjoyed it.  I served it on toasted hoagie rolls.  Next time, I will pour the beer more slowly and watch it carefully, as the beer spattered when I poured it in to deglaze the bottom.  The only changes I made were: 1) I made it in the electric skillet.  2) Half of the sausages I used were spicy.

Good stuff.  Browned the sausage, then added a little water, the onions and (only green) peppers to the pan and let them caramelize a bit before adding a bottle of beer.  Substituted 16oz tomato sauce for the paste and basil (1T dried) for the cilantro.  Added back the sausage and simmered with the lid off while we cooked some spaghetti.  Could still faintly taste the beer (honey lager) even with only one bottle, so glad that we didn't use full amount.  Stirred in 1oz cream cheese at the very end to thicken and make a little creamy.

Halved it loosely. Browned hot Italian sausage and removed. then sautéed peppers and onions. Threw in garlic last second and removed from pot. Added beer to deglaze and burn off alcohol. Added paste and oregano. Let simmer for couple minutes. Added sliced sausage and peppers to warm. Could do whole sausages on buns.

This is absolutely delicious, but I couldn't fit all the ingredients in one pan.  I'd suggest cutting the recipe in half or maybe using a really big soup pot.  Will definitely make this again though.

This is really tasty and easy to adapt to whatever is on hand.  The sweet taste from the beer complements the spicy sausage.  I used no oil for the sausages (they are greasy enough!).  It's a quick, easy dinner with things normally on hand.

Delicious!!! I only used one bottle of beer which added amazing flavor. I used hot and sweet sausage which I grilled first then sliced and added to the saucy peppers, onions, and beer mixture. Again, another great pot luck....bring to a party dish. Everyone enjoyed!

this dish was Awesome!! MY hubby loved it and he is very picky! He had seconds and then finished off the left overs later that night!! I made the recipe according to the directions except only used 1 1/2 cans beer. Next time I think I will substitute butter for olive oil for a sweeter taste and cut back on the hot sauce as my kids thought it was too spicy. This is a keeper for sure!!

Made with sausage patties to go on a bun with ranch dressing and colby-jack cheese.  Used Italian seasoning instead of cilantro.  I love sausage, pepper and onion sandwiches, but I thought the beer made the peppers taste rather bitter.  I think I'll skip the beer as per usual.

I made this for a school potluck. Because there were children, I substituted the beer for water and added more herbs. After the food line diminished, I thought I would get some. The dish was totally gone!!!! My daughter told me later that it was a hit!

This was really, really delish!  I only made a few small changes: I added only 1 1/2 beers, 2 cans of tomato paste and used 1 pack of hot sausage and 1 pack of sweet.  I would have liked the sauce a bit thicker, although it was very tasty as I made it.  Next time, I will add 1 beer (or maybe a tad less) and 2 cans tomato paste.  Great flavor!

WOW! What a great recipe, even my picky eater raved about this and warned me that there better be left overs for him for supper the next night.   I served it over garlic buttered penne and it was a huge success.  For this, I doubled the amt of tomato paste, but when I make it for sandwichs I do not change anything from the original recipe.  I did make it in large quantity for an open house last summer using a big roaster.  It was not quite as tasty as making it in the smaller quantity but it still went well and there were no left overs.  I have been asked to make it again this summer for another open house.  Thank you so much for offering this recipe

This turned out pretty good.  I am not a huge fan of sausages or peppers so I made some changes:

-I used only 3 peppers, half an onion
-Used only 1 beer
-Omitted the worshtershire sauce and cilantro

It was juicy and the beer really added a nice flavour to the sausage.  This is totally a man's meal since my father and boyfriend really liked it.

Other than cilantro (which I do not like) and having to use dried oregano, I followed the recipe almost exactly and it was delicious.  I used five different colored peppers and a lot of onion and garlic.  I also left the sausages whole--and served on a seperate place--so they wouldn't be swallowed up in the vegetables.  Next day or two I'll mix leftovers with pasta and add a little spaghetti sauce for another satisfying meal.

the idea is good but i used corona and that wasn't good, it had an acid taste to it. next time: saute pan brown sausage in evoo, remove, brown onions and peppers, remove both to crock pot. deglaze pan with something else, white wine maybe or a different beer or a stock. then add tomato paste, and spices or just a can of diced tomatoes. put in crock pot on low for an hour or 2 to meld the flavors, i liked that part.

Awesome recipe, my snow bird in laws brought over all these ingredients before they migrated south for the winter and I was looking for a way to use them seeing as we're not beer drinkers. Fantastic, my only complaint is that it was a little acidic so I did add some sugar to offset that. I also halved the recipe which by any normal standards would feed 8-10 adults. The only real change I made was subbing parsley for the cilantro as I didn't have any on hand and didn't feel it required a special trip to the store. I served this over rice, my husband suggested I make this and serve on hoagie rolls for football Sunday. This one will surely make it into my recipe book.

I always claim that I don't know how to cook, as I have a family of chef's. This was just too easy. I used red, yellow and orange peppers as I hate green peppers, cilantro a must, 2 cans of beer-that was easy. My favorite red onions, check,  but you can use sweet yellow. Used 1/2 hot sausage 1/2 sweet, just a dash of the hot sauce. Served over linguine and the crowds went wild! Thanks Robert for my new favorite!

This was very good.  My family really enjoyed it.  I did not have tomatoe paste.  I substituted tomatoe sauce. The sauce ended up being a little thin--but we LOVED it!

I cooked this for my family prior to Christmas. They LOVED it & prior, hated Italian sausage (I snuck it in there on them.) I also made for this year's New Year's Eve gathering at a friends & everyone devoured it! I only added a little more heat (hot sauce), otherwise, everything else remained the same. I'm curious how seafood (shrimp & salmon)would taste, will try at another time. Definitely a keeper!

Outstanding!  I used spicy Italian sausage and skipped the hot sauce & cilantro.  The first night I served it on Hoagie rolls, sprinkled parmesan cheese and served it with a salad.  My husband couldn't stop talking about it.

Two days later, I added about a cup of spaghetti sauce, and served it over whole wheat penne pasta.  My husband said it was even better than he could have imagined.   
It made a lot so I still have some in the freezer!  This is great for people without much time to cook.  I can't wait to serve it to guests.
Added information:  I just made it with 1 lb. boneless, skinless chicken breasts and 1/2 lb turkey jalapeno sausage.  Same GREAT taste but LESS FAT.  Must be the peppers!

Yum! We loved this one. I did make some slight alterations - more garlic, more oregano and cilantro, half sweet and half spicy sausage. I used a couple of bottles of Smithwick's (minus a few swigs for the cook). It came out great - served with fresh crusty baguettes.

Oh my gosh! I've never posted a review but this recipe is getting one.  I got this recipe in my inbox as a recipe of the day yesterday and made it last night and it was AWESOME.  If you like sausage and peppers you will rave over this.  I thought that surely the flavor would be bland because there wasn't much too this recipe but boy I was wrong.  This is a true keeper and I brought it to work today for lunch and I'm thinking of making next weekend and taking it to deer camp.  Kudos for posing this recipe!!!!

I know the vote is 165 to 1, but I wasn't thrilled with this recipe.  I love brats done in beer with sausage, but with the tomato paste and italian herbs, it just didn't work.  Easy to do, though, just not better than a good jar sauce.

This was great, great, great! I halved the recipe, except for the tomato paste, garlic and herbs. I added a little garlic powder and a shake of red pepper flakes. I used Amstel Light for the beer. Has an awsome flavor! I used mild Italian sausages, next time I might use Hot. I also will add melted mozz cheese. Also, I will serve with garlic bread next time! Really good, fast, easy and inexpensive! Beware: heartburn may occur!

I had high hopes for this recipe, based on the reviews.  We found it was missing something.  I followed the recipe exactly, but it was a little bland for our taste buds.  If I try this again, maybe I'll be a little more picky about what beer I use.

This is truly the best sausage and peppers recipe ever. The beer is key. I use half sweet and half hot Italian sausage. It makes excellent sandwiches too.

This is excellent!  Not only does it taste great, but it's a very flexible recipe -- in fact, I've never made it with beer!  I always use a 12oz package of Italian sausage (5 links), one yellow onion, and one or two bell peppers (whatever color I have on hand).  It's great by itself or served as a kind of sauce over spaghetti squash or whatever carbilicious filler you choose.

I've been eyeing this recipes for ages but when the time came to make it I always reverted  to cooking the family receipe.  Yesterday I caved in and I am so glad I did.  We loved it!!!!  No changes made - I ended up using both hot and sweet sausage.  We will be making this again and again. It's easy to make too. Thanks submitter.

This was awesome! Scaled it down to 4 svgs. I used extra tomatoe paste because I wanted it to be a thicker sauce. I also used dried herbs instead of fresh. You need a large dutch oven or stock pot to cook in. We served it over bow tie pasta . Very good!

This WAS excellent.  I made it for 2 people, so I cut the meat and veggies in half, but used the same amount of sauce...was great over rice pilaf.  We have already talked about when we will eat it again.

Very easy and great.  My husband loved it.  I didn't have any cilantro and it still turned out great.  The smell of the cooked beer is a little strong, but the taste makes up for it.  I served with rice.

Wow!!  This is a delicious recipe!  I used sweet and hot Italian sausage and Yuengling beer.  The sauce it makes is incredible, what fabulous sandwiches we have enjoyed around here today!  This was an easy recipe and very excellent tasting-it will stay in my file.  Thanks for sharing.

We loved this meal.  The sauce was so tasty.  My husband said, "Put it in the rotation please!"  I will serve the leftovers over angel hair pasta.  
When I prepared the meal I did cut the meat down to 2 pounds, and there was plenty. 

My one question would be what is the best beer to use!

I must admit I was skeptical of adding beer. But after trying this, using Pacifico beer, the results were very tasty. This is a keeper!

This recipe is amazing! My husband kept saying how delicious it was. 

Like others, I used "Hot" Italian sausage so I left out the hot sauce . The only other substitution I had to make was using dry oregano and dry cilantro but it still came out great! Thank you for sharing this recipe!!!

Very easy and quick, but don't use an IPA since it gives the whole dish an unpleasant bitterness!

I don't add the Hot Sauce, I use really hot Basque Chorizo and that has a way of spreading the flavor throughout the mixture! 
We love this!! I make it several times a year!!

Fantastic meal. I used stout for the beer, and left out the cilantro. I ran out of tomato paste so I took a 28oz can of whole tomatoes, blitzed them in the blender until smooth, and simmered them down on the stovetop while I cooked. And I ended up using the whole lot of tomato sauce. I also added a tiny bit of sugar to balance the bitterness of the beer, and used dried oregano and basil. Served it over a bit of jasmine rice. This recipe will definitely be going into regular rotation at my house!

I want to still give this a 5 even though I changed a tad of the ingredients.... the only change I made was with the spices... I didnt have cilantro and to be honest would not have used it anyway. I used fresh basil, dried oregego and parsley. I only had Hoeegardden available which is a belgium white beer, and doubled up the sausage because I was bringing this to my potluck event at church... Needless to say it was a hit, not a pepper/onion or sausage to be left. In fact someone took home the left over sauce that they want to put over some pasta or rice when they get home.... The sauce was delicious and the hot sauce just gave it a touch of heat that was just the right amount.. Plan on making this over and over... I actually made this recipe by mistake, there was another recipe on allrecipes that I made before that was similar, but used wine instead... when i got to reading/preparing this I saw the beer and said oops, but, went with it anyway and I am sure glad I did. Liked this much better... Thanks again love this website!!

This is by far the best sausage and peppers recipe I've ever tried. I have never been a fan of the meal and stumbled upon this recipe when looking for one for my husband who loves the dish. Always willing to try a new recipe even if I don't typically enjoy the ingredients I took a bite and found it to be absolutely delicious! As one other reviewer noted I also found the sauce to be watery, next time I will use an extra can of paste. Amazing recipe overall though.

Yummy, but very strong beer flavor.  If you want less beer flavor, sub 1/2 chicken or beef broth for the beer.

This was great- so easy & tasty! Made it as written except halved it and didn't use any red peppers b/c I only had green. (also used kielbasa b/c that is what my husband bought but next time I'd use italian turkey sausage I think).  Made it w/ some steak fries but might try rice next time b/c the sauce was yummmmy.

This recipe was O.K. but I probably will not make this again.  I think using 3 T. of olive oil is way too much and caused spattering of oil all over the place including on me.  I used a non stick pan so I did not have any blackened bits to scrap from the pan.  Once I completed browning the sausage, I just placed everything in the slow cooker for four hours.  With the leftovers, I removed the sausage, cut into bite size pieces, onion and peppers from the sauce and added a jar of pasta sauce to serve over spaghetti.  This got rave reviews.

I always hear about how simplicity creates exquisite flavors; I CAN NOT AGREE MORE!!! I cut the recpe in half to try it. I literally woke up the next day wanting more. I'm trying to hold off making it until my holiday office party which is next week but I don't know if I can.

This is a relatively easy dish to make.  Since there are just two of us I modified the portions.  After browning three sausage links I sliced it up and browned it a little more in the pan.  I used half of a green, yellow and red bell pepper, half of a red onion and a little more than half a bottle of beer.  I substituted the oregano and cilantro for fresh basil, because that's what I had on hand. I probably made too many modifications that it's no longer the original recipe -- but this recipe was great inspiration, for sure!

I guess I'm the only one who wasn't too crazy about this recipe.  I had to cut it down to serve  the 2 of us, I used 3 sausages, the vegs, cut down to serve 2 which was fine but found that the tomato paste was too strong and with the 1/2 bottle of beer it was all around strong.  I'll make it again but will use tomato sauce instead.  I cut the peppers in strips but found them too big so will dice them the next time.

Don't know where all the awesome reviews come from but it lacked taste for me!  It was really bland and ate it b/c I spent so long cooking it.  :(  When you have three kids running around trying to cook a good meal is so hard...its very disappointing when it doesn't turn out like you had hoped.

Super!!!!! cooked the sausage in the frying pan and then put it in the crockpot.  Then I made the sauce with the peppers and onions and let it cook all day on low.  I was impressed with how tender the sausage was!!!  Even my daughter who normally doesnt eat peppers and onions ate hers!!  We will be making this again but next time we are going to try it out on sub rolls instead of rice.

Substituted tomato sauce for paste.  The dish was very good. I used hot sausage instead of sweet and less oregano.  No cilantro.  Will make again.

I used an oatmeal stout beer, wrong thing to do it was a bit too much. Otherwise I think this would have been a great recipe

This sounds very much like a recipe my aunt used to make along time ago, except minus the peppers and add sauerkraut and use kielbassa sausage. has anyone ever heard of that? id love to have the original recipe.

I used this for sandwiches and it wasn't as good as other SOP recipes I've tried. I cut the recipe down to a third because I was only serving 2 people. There was too much sauce and veggies for the amount of sausage I had, especially since I couldn't fit that many veggies on the rolls. I think this would be better as a main dish served with pasta or rice, which can soak up the sauce. 

I had the leftovers a couple days later. The beer gave the leftover sauce and veggies an off-note, and I ended up throwing some of the dish away. I used an IPA, as the recipe didn't specify what type of beer to use. I think a milder pale ale or a lager would work better if you planning to have leftovers.

Fabulous recipe!  Who knew beer would make such delicious sauce!  I followed the directions exactly as written except I used fresh polish sausage.  If you're a fan of fresh polish sausage (not the name brand smoked kielbasa) try it, you won't be disappointed!

Great recipe!  I pretty much halved it, did not have tomato paste so I drained a can of chopped tomates and used that.  Served over rice and it was great!

I've been making this recipe for years, minus the cilantro, (I use fresh basil) and I never measure any of the ingredients.  (Just depends on what I have on hand).  As another reviewer stated, if you don't have good quality Italian Sausage no recipe will taste good!!  I am blessed to live in Chicago with many many different Ethnic shops.  I only purchase my Italian Sausage from one Deli.  I cut the sausage in "sausage roll" size, serve it all on fresh baked sausage rolls topped with freshly grated Parmesean/Romano or BOTH!!  YUMMY!

This was a great recipe. Instead of Italian sausage I used Lukanka sausage and served it on fresh hogie buns and it was fantastic. The lukanka gave it an extra kick. Very good recipe, thanks.

Awesome -- especially with garlic. I am pleased, such as most people, with garlic which, always in proper portion based on taste, is a terrific and standard item in classic dishes.

This is a great recipe, I changed it a little just because I only had dried herbs. I only made about half the amount. Its funny to look through the pictures of this, so many different variations, makes me wonder if people just make what ever they want.   Oh well. I followed as close as I could and it turned out perfectly. When I think of hot sauce I think of Franks Red Hot, but I didn't have that so I used Saracha and just a few dashes of red wine vinegar. It turned out great. I Have never put beer in my sausage and peppers so this was new to me. I used yueling-ling (sp?) it added some depth.   All in all I will make this again. Maybe I will transfer everything to the slow cooker after browning and deglazing. Just to make the sausage, peppers and onions to really meld together more.

Pretty  good. Next time I might use a better beer than PBR. The cilantro and oregano also runs the risk of being a little too strong, next time I might cut back some on how much I put in.

Used roasted red peppers and one can of beer and served over rice. Ideally i would have used buns with melted cheese but we didn't have any. I will make it again though with the buns.

This was delicious!  I didn't have any peppers, so I just used onions.  I think it would have tasted even BETTER with the peppers!  The sauce was amazing and so easy to make!  I had it over rice, while my husband tried it on bread and both ways were great!  He suggessted next time to try the sauce over meatballs too!  I am sure that will taste just as good!

Cooking in the beer first gets a lot of the fat out.  I will use this trick more often with sausage dishes.  Then I just moved to the crock pot and served right out of that for a party.  Very good.  Thanks.

I love, love, love this recipe. I've been making this recipe for over 4 years now and still love it. It's very easy to tailor the recipe to your liking whether it's the sausage type of the amount of veggies. When I make this for my husband and me, I use spicier sausage and when I make it for our kids, I use a mild sausage. The kids love it - minus the vegetables of course! I have also made this for potlucks and have received rave reviews. Thanks for a great recipe!

Good recipe.  I had some sausage and beer (from another recipe) so I figured I'd try this out.  I served this over rice and used Dos Equis beer.  I didn't taste any beer, but I'm sure it mingled with everything else to enhance the flavor.  I'll try serving this as a hoagie next time.

This was great!! We, of course, ad-libbed because I didn't have exactly the right ingredients and needed less.  The main change I made was I used Ragu pizza sauce and left out all spices.  We also served it on toasteted Italian bread with Provolone.  Even my somewhat picky 3 year old LOVED it!She told me several times, "that was good pizza mommy!"

Awesome!  I made sandwiches and melted provolone cheese on top for Sunday football game and everyone loved them.  The only change i made was adding extra paste and a little sugar.  Only because i wanted the sauce thicker for the sandwiches.  Excellent recipe!  Will be the highlight of many football sundays to come! Thanks!

Added a little sugar to offset bitterness of tomato paste. Actually a little brown sugar worked better. May try it again with petite diced tomatoes instead of the paste.

this was good.  I used less beer than called for.  I also made once in the crock pot - I just browned the sausages, then threw together will all the other ingredients in a crock pot on low for 7 hours.  Really tasty!

This was wonderful my family loved it and it tasted better than I thought it would :) . I added some garlic powder in addition to the fresh garlic and cayenne powder to give it more of a kick.

Very spicy, but good overall.  Next time I think I'll use mild italian sausage.... my boyfriend bought the hot ones and that mixed with the hot sauce was a little powerful for me.  Other than that I really enjoyed the flavour and something different for a change.

Had already made another recipe of sausage and peppers, but really liked this website.  So tried this recipe and it was even BETTER than my original recipe.  The beer really make the flavor! Used sausage that was between medium and hot...so I didn't use the hot sauce.  Definitely recommend this recipe to anyone!  Much better the 2nd day!

Very good! I used fresh (homegrown)ground sweet-hot sausage instead of link sausage and some extra oregano. I also added about a tablespoon of honey to cut down on the bite of the tomato paste. It was delicious mixed in with brown rice. The kids loved it! I'll definitely make again.

This was sooo good; I left the sausages whole, and I cut the recipe in half, but it was delicious.  I cooked it in my 2 qt. crock pot (since I'd cut it in 1/2) and we ate it on toasted hoagie rolls.  My husband loved it and so did the neighbor we gave some too.

This was very good.  I was expecting more of a punch of flavors with all of the spices....still very flavorful though.  i used sam adams beer and may put in an extra bottle or so to bring out the flavor more.  Will definitely make again, husband loved that i was pouring beer into dinner  :)

This was SO tasty but I really didn't like the brand of sausage I used. Husband didn't mind at all, but I ended up picking mine out, and just eating the veggies and sauce. I loved the flavor of the beer in the sauce - subtle but different. I'll make this again but with different sausage or maybe kielbasa. The only thing I did differently was to slice up the sausages before I browned them in the olive oil. Great recipe, Robert. Thanks!

I've been using this recipe for a couple of years now, and still love it.  I use half or less of each ingredient, except the tomato paste, and it still makes enough for more than 2 meals for my husband and I.  I like to eat it on a sub roll the first day, and with pasta the next.

Would've given it a 4.5 if it were possible. I added a couple cans of green chillies to kick it up a notch or two. I also left the sausages whole, and spooned the sauce over the potato bread buns with the peppers and onions on top. GREAT!

This recipe was fantastic.  I subbed pasta sauce for the tomato paste, but it is true, the beer makes the recipe (and I don't even like beer). I used Miller Genuine Draft, but I would love to try a different beer next time.  Very flavorful, I will use this one over and over again.  My husband loved it.

YUMMY is all I can say!  Husband LOVED it! Followed the recipe exactly, and it made LOTS, which is great to feed a large family.  Teenage son said "it's a keeper, Mom!"  (Two younger boys wouldn't eat it though, peppers and onions not being one of their favorites :). I was skeptical at first with that much beer, since I don't like the taste of beer, but the sauce tasted great with the other ingredients.  This would be great over pasta....will try that next time.  I will defintely be making this one again!

My husband made this and chopped the bell peppers so fine, and added 1 jar Ragu Mushroom spaghetti sauce. After browning sausage and cutting into chunks, he place all into the crock pot and walked away till evening, when his poker group was very impressed and all wanted the recipe! P.S. He used Sam Adams beer!

Sausage and beer, what could be better! This is easy and delicious.  I used a red onion, but could have probably used a yellow onion with the same results.  I served it with rotelle pasta and a tossed salad.  Thanks for a winner.

Oh, I have to give this one 5 stars! Everyone in my family from old to young LOVED IT! I cut down on the ingredients and it still fed 5. If you want a change from the ordinary spaghetti sauce, try this one. We all liked the sweet of the Italian sausage pared with the spicy sauce. I will make this again and again. My husband has a cholesterol problem so we use turkey sausage. Used a bottle of home brew beer (ignore the smell when you add the beer) and cooked the sausage with the sauce instead of adding it later. Seems the longer it simmered, the better it got. 
Thank you Robert!

All I had on hand for this one was polish sausage and it worked great. I wasn't confident about the beer, so I made it without by using a can of diced tomatoes in addition to the tomato paste. Very yummy. After reading a few more reviews, I think I may try the beer next time, but I won't use the oil for frying, since the sausage had enough of its own grease.

This is such an easy and tastey meal! As with most recipes, I did some things differently. I only used 1.5lbs of sausage and 2 red peppers. I could have cut the peppers down even more! There is much more than 6 servings here. I probably got 6 servings with what I used. Anyway, I also topped it over rice. I didn't add all 2 Tblsp of hot sauce (only 1Tblsp) because I was afraid it would be too hot. It wasn't-next time I'm going to add 2 Tbspns. Husband loved it!

This was delicious.  I would have never thought of adding beer, but it really added a nice flavor.

This was AWESOME!  My husband and I loved it.  I even cut the recipe in 1/2 and it was delicious.  The sauce was nice and thick and not too overpowering.

Definitely being added to the rotation. Made exactly as written except I had 2 lbs and 6 oz of sausage. One pack spicy the other mild which was perfect. Served over brown rice

This was very good.   I think I will cut back on the tomato paste next time, just to suit my own tastes.    I used Guinness for the beer (I think a darker beer is better), I left in the cilantro, and I pierced the sausage, browning it with water and it's own juices, per another reviewer's good idea.    I will make it again.

Really, really good — amazing results.  I chose to use mostly red and orange peppers.  I didn’t mince the garlic but rather gave it a fine chop — it was really nice.  I was glad to still have some fresh oregano in my garden, it really pushed this over the top.  The only thing I felt was lacking was salt — I added more and it was perfect.  My husband loves SP&O and the most recent sandwiches he’s gotten when dining out have been underwhelming — he said this one was “out of the park.”  Make it — thank you for sharing this recipe.

I made this according to the recipe (basically). It was just ok. I usually have these ingredients on hand so in a pinch I will make it again but will play with the ingredients next time. Since I have an 8 year old who is spicy sensitive, I used 1 pound mild Italian sausage and 1 pound smoked sausage and omitted the hot sauce. He won’t eat the peppers and onions so... Like other reviews I didn’t use cilantro. And as one reviewer did, I too added 1 cup rice and 1 cup water which was a good idea!-

" Alrighty now" say I.   I've made this dish too too many times before,  soo what could they  possibly teach me.   LOTS. I made this at 2AM, & me" sweety Bear " woke up from bed  because of  the lovely smells,  He refused to take his night time pill, because he can't eat anything for 3 hrs. after taking it, & he wanted this food NOW. That's what Bears do. EAT NOWWWW!  The beer is really a HUGE add on, & if you are afraid to drink , don't worry. The alcohol boils off if you let it come to a boil. I simmered the whole meal, very slowly, & one more thing. A HUGE difference in this recipe is how you cut your onions & peppers . Do it LENGTHWISE!  I used to cut it into chunks, but last night at 2AM I had a great thought. CUT LENGHT WAY. What a difference., &  it makes it easier to eat from buns, or Lnguini, or just from the pot. Too good. Thank you, & to all you wonderful " foodies" Happy 2018 New Years.    Cheers

This recipe was really easy to make and taste soo good.  However I used tomatoe paste the first time I made it. The second time I used tomatoe sauce and it was so much better.

OMG! This came out soooo delicious! I did have to omit the cilantro, as my husband doesn't like the taste of it. So instead, I substitute it with dried parsley (1 tsp dry  = 1 Tbsp fresh). I also had a bag of green & red peppers & onion, so I saved time by adding that in, instead of it being individually. I've saved this recipe & I will be making it again and again. ????

This turned out better than I could have imagined! I used Dos Equis beer and added a little tapioca flour to thicken the sauce. 4 hot and 6 sweet Italian sausage. Served over toasted buns. Sooo good! Thank you!

I actually substituted sausage for chicken breast.  I floured and seasoned the breasts and cooked them first in the pan with oil, then removed and followed the rest of the directions.  I also added mushrooms as well.  It was delicious!!!!!!!!!!!

I have made this recipe many times.  I  made it exactly as follows, on the cooktop in my beloved Le Creuset pot, and it turned out great.  I have also grilled the sausages (I especially like Italian turkey sausage), sautéed the peppers and onions in a pan and deglazed, then poured everything into the crockpot on low for 6-8 hours.  That is actually my favorite method.  Great for a crowd, love to serve this on the 4th when we get back from the parade in town.  Sausages melt in your mouth!

Been making sausage with peppers and onions forever. This is an excellent twist. Everyone raved about it. Only thing I changed was I didn't use cilantro (don't like it).

This was a great recipe to use up peppers from my garden! I used 4 red peppers, 2 orange, and 1 green. Used Coors Light since that's what we drink. Our local grocery store makes their own Italian sausage so I bought 2 rings of it. Also used 1 tbsp each of dried oregano and parsley since that's what I had on hand. Overall a delicious recipe! Served with garlic toast. Thanks so much :)

This was great!  I grilled the sausage seperately and then I added the rest of the ingredients, except the hot sauce, into a crockpot and cooked for about an hour or so on high setting.  Turned out amazing!!

This was great!! I had all the ingredients on hand. I did not cut up the sausages into slices and we had sausage sandwiches. Tastes like outside of Fenway! Next time I will try like another reviewer mentioned and cook them in the crockpot. I'm happy to have another sausage recipe, and one that isn't over pasta!!

Tried this tonight. Hubby hated the beer taste, not liking the after taste , either. Three other adults loved it. I think next time I might try adding beef broth and not the tomato paste and beer, too much like spaghetti to me.  If you like the peppers & onions do add as much as the recipe calls for, they cook down & get lost in the tomato sauce. Other wise a good base recipe to make your own. We put ours on hoagie  buns .

This recipe sounds so good as a change from just plain sausage.  However, I would like to sub something for the beer.  No beer in our house.  What would be a good sub.

I used Sweet and Hot Italian sausage - the sauce needs a little something and I can't figure out what.  The recipe was decent, but almost a little too tomato-y - and not quite thick enough.

The whole family LOVED this recipe.  I just swapped out dry Italian Seasoning Mix and Dry Basil for the oregano as I didn't have oregano and because we love cilantro, I actually increased it to 4 tablespoons.

It turned out pretty well, but I would recommend using a lighter flavored beer. Stouts work, but have a bit too strong a taste for this.

I halved the recipe. Skipped the red bell pepper (used more green), regular onions instead of the red, dried herbs (Italian seasoning- homemade) and a lime beer. Was tasty on buns with melted cheese the for dinner, and leftovers were just as good over rice for lunch the next day. The tomato paste was a bit much, so I'll probably use less next time and thin it out a bit.

WOW!  This was soooo good!  I used the recommendation for the crock pot version.  I cut the recipe in 1/2 and used a medium crock pot.  I did end up using a whole 6 oz can of paste though to thicken it a little more.  Also, to make it healthier I used low fat mild italian chicken sausage.  I also used a light beer to lessen the beer taste.  Did not use cilantro, used dried oregano and parsley.  Next time I will wait to salt it and maybe use a low sodium paste though.  The first night we had it on whole grain pasta, the second night as a sandwich.  It was AWESOME!!

I used Italian sausage and guiness. Next time I'll sauté the onions and garlic in a bit of olive oil before browning the sausage. The beer tends to cook off before the onions are done. The result is a great spaghetti sauce.

Very good and very easy.  Except for the red peppers, I divided everything by half to serve two with leftovers; however, even then it could have served six.  I used dried herbs which seemed to work fine.  In addition, I used two roasted red peppers from my jar and added them when I returned the sausage to the skillet.  I used hot sausages, which may make the dish too spicy for some.  After I poured the second half of the beer bottle into the pan, I was sorely tempted to add a bit more.   Thankfully, I resisted this urge.  Served this with the Rice with Herbes de Provence, which was a nice side with an herb contrast.  A reasonable quality 2009 Chianti went well too.

Very good! My husband said it was "awesome" and thanked me for making something he likes ;)  What he means is that it was spicy enough for him, while it was definitely too spicy for me--heartburn city! Next time I will use only 1 TBS of hot sauce (I used Jim Beam hot sauce) and let him add more to his own serving if he wants. FYI: I used ShinerBock beer and it was good!

So good.  The only things I changed was I added pasta and a little spagetti sauce and served it as a one dish meal.  Loved it!  Guest loved it and had to give them the recipe which they used for a dinner celebration. Also I use broth instead of beer - sorry never going to waste beer on cooking, rather drink it.

I used spicy sausage, fried the peppers and onions up right after the sausage, took them out, put in garlic, beer, paste and spices to simmer for 10 minutes then added meat and pepper onion mix back in for 30 minutes.  I would probably add less beer next time, or remove juices after peppers and onions because it was too wet.  The flavor was awesome!

So yummy!  My husband bragged and bragged about this meal for days!  I added a little more tomato paste and some El pato brand mexican tomato sauce just to thicken it up a little.  I also added more tobasco sauce and some cayenne pepper.  All in all this was a DELICIOUS meal that we ate on for days!

This was phenomenal...I used tomato sauce instead of paste, I skipped the cilantro, and added a dash of sugar to offset the bitterness.  My picky husband loved it and even had seconds!  I will definitely make this recipe on a regular basis.

Who would think beer and tomato paste make such a Great Hot Sausage dish! I boiled my hot sausage for 40 minutes before browning it but that was the only part that I did differently.  I hated having to use 2 beers for the dish but it was certainly worthwhile!I only used green peppers as I had no red ones to use.  I added only 1Tablespoon of hot sauce instead of 3 Tablespoons,  since I used hot sausage.  My husband likes it hot and he said it was Perfect!  Thanks for this recipe, it is a Keeper!!

UPDATE: MADE THESE AGAIN, BUT THIS TIME, I SUBSTITUTED PARSLEY FOR THE CILANTRO (DIDN'T HAVE THE LATTER) AND ADDED SLICES OF MOZZARELLA CHEESE TO OUR SANDWICHES (WHICH I MELTED UNDER THE BROILER... MMMM.....). MY BEER OF CHOICE WAS CORONA. I ACTUALLY PREFER USING A LIGHTER BEER. Not bad.... Although good (my fiance really enjoyed this!), I don't think  this is "knock your socks off good." I like my slow cooker sausage sub recipe MUCH better. Notwithstanding the opportunity to make my own enhancements, I made a few changes. I cut this in HALF, but kept the amount of garlic as is and used all green bell peppers (they're more economical). My beer of choice was Abita Turbodog (all I had on hand). FYI, Turbodog is a brown ale local to Louisiana (my fiance says...). I elected to cook my sausage thoroughly FIRST as opposed to just browning it and allowing to finish cooking AFTER adding to my veggies (I've had bad luck with undercooked sausage in the past). My only complaint with this recipe is that the cooking instructions are quite vague. Thankfully, I am a seasoned cook (or at least I consider myself to be!), so I seamlessly navigated thru the ambigious steps. A novice cook might struggle, so for that reason, I can't award this a perfect rating (sorry!). We served ours sandwich style (on toasted sub rolls) with homemade potato chips and our remaining beer! Thanks for sharing, Rob! It was nice to try your recipe. :-)

Very good recipe!  I used ketchup instead of tomato paste. The sugar in teh ketchup offset the bitterness of the beer.  I used Guinness beer (left over from a guinness stew recipe).  And I cut the sausages into pieces so it would brown more.

My DH loves this. This is a recipe he asks for all the time. I use only 1 bottle of beer and hot(spicy)italian sausage so no hot sauce. Great over rice or pasta.

This was just a weird dish. I halved the recipe and it was still a ton of food. It's true it tastes bitter and it is definitely missing something, just not sure what. I feel that it is lacking texture. It seems like this would be good with cheese on bread, like others have suggested.

This was absolutely delicious! The whole family, including my 1.5 y/o daughter loved this. I followed the recipe almost exactly, except that I allowed the beer to simmer a little longer before adding in the veggies just to burn off more of the alcohol, since our toddler was having this meal too. And I used hot italian sausages because that's what I had. We will definitely be making this again and again! Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe was very tasty. I too cut the recipe down to 1/3 of the current and it still turned out well. I used Blue Moon beer and substituted sundried red bell peppers, as I didn't have any fresh. But the flavors were well balanced and I will definitely make this again.

Made this the other night and it was very good.  I did have to add some sugar though to cut down on the bitterness of the beer.  We ate it on hoagies with provolone cheese.  Yum!!

I make this recipe all the time. My boyfriend and I love it! I cut the recipe in half so I don't have tons of leftovers but I keep the garlic and spices the same. I also use the Hot Turkey Sausage which helps cut down on the fat. Also, you do not need to cook the sausage in oil. The sausage will create grease when cooking - the oil just adds extra grease.

This is very good.  I use turkey sausage and different colored peppers for plate appeal.  Make sure you use the biggest pan you own (I end up using my wok) because this recipe yields a lot!

Great recipe!  I took this to a neighborhood progressive dinner and everyone raved about it. I did cut down on beer (used Guiness) and added some red wine instead.  Omitted the cilantro. Also I cooked in a large roasting pan in 250 degree oven for 2 1/2 hours. Delicious

Maybe I did something wrong, but this turned out very bitter.  I had to add brown sugar to the sauce to make it edible.  Even then, the bitterness was still a distraction.

GREAT RECIPE!! I was in a hurry and didn't think I had time to make it, but I was determined and everyone LOVED it. They said this was a keeper and make it again soon. I had to go to a meeting and told them what I had made for dinner and they all want a copy of it also.

Versatile recipe.  I originally served it over rice; then I made hoagies with the leftovers, adding some melted mozerella and browning in the oven. Kids and husband preferred the hoagies.

This was good but I am sure it was not as good as it could have been due to lack of few ingredients.  I didn't have any tomato paste so used ketchup, no oregano or cilantro so used Italian seasoning.  Next time, I will try with proper ingredients.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this for the 5 men in my family.  They all loved it.  They added more hot sauce to their individual plates.  We had enough left over for 3 lunch plates which thrilled them! The flavor is wonderful! Thank you!

I have been experimenting with different recipes for sausage and peppers but this one is by far the best.  The red peppers and onion made the difference from the other dishes I've tried.  The beer seems to mellow the flavor of the peppers.  Everyone who I had try this yesterday has asked for a second sandwich.

Wonderful recipe!!! This was a great "manly" meal for my hubby and father in law!!! B/c I used hot sausage, I reduced the hot sauce by half and it was still spicy. Also, from another review, I cut the sausage into pieces before cooking to cut down on the cooking time. I served it over white rice. it was a big hit!!! Thanks!!!

This recipe was just delicious! I scaled it down to 4 servings and still had left overs for the next night. So flavorful I threw it on a steak roll and enjoyed the heck out of it.  Very easy to make as well.

I have never taken the time to review one of these recipes, but I just had to this time!  This is the best recipe for sausage and peppers that I have ever tasted.  I followed the recipe exactly, and it was perfect!  It makes quite a bit, but I know its going to get eaten fast.  Thanks for this great recipe!

Made this with hot sausage and added tabasco as well - turned out very hot. Used Coors Lite and dried "italian seasoning", didn't have any fresh herbs. Still very good, though. Next time I'll try sweet and hot sausage over bow tie pasta. I served w/rice but it absorbed most of the sauce.  Great recipe - thanks!

My hubby LOVED this recipe and would have given it 5 stars.  I wasn't that impressed.  The sauce needs a little playing with.  Maybe some more spices a little extra hot sauce?  I will play with it a little.  Thanks Robert!!

Great recipe!  I reduced the recipe to serve two.  I had to improvise as I did not have tomato paste so I used an 8oz. can of tomato sauce (not quite the whole can).  I also substituted dried herbs for fresh (oregano and an Italian blend) and omitted the cilantro.  The sauce was very flavorful and zesty.  It was great over penne pasta.  I will definitely make this again!

I used pasta ssauce and Italian seasonings, and instead of cutting the sausage into pieces left it whole to serve as sandwiches on Italian bread. My husband and our guest loved it. I only used one bottle of MGD. This recipe would adapt well to a crockpot and increased quantities for a large group, something I will keep in mind for football season.

This was just delicious!  I really hate peppers so I thought I wouldn't like this much, but the flavors all combined and were great together.  I was a little concerned about the fat content, so next time I may use Healthy Choice smoked sausage but I know it won't be as good as the Italian sausage!  This one is a winner.

FABULOUS!!!!  I didn't have fresh oregano so I used 3 teaspoon dried, and omitted cilantro.  If your sauce is too runny - try simmering uncovered or partially uncovered.  This is my new favorite sausge recipe.  Thanks for sharing this one!!!

This was the messiest dish I've ever made.  Forget a large pan...you need a HUGE pan.  There's just so many veggies to put in.  I added all the ingredients that I could, but I ran out of space.  I cut the red peppers to 2 intead of 3, and only used 1 out of the 2 required onions.  I used a very large pan, but apparently it wasn't big enough.  I had to get another pan out and split the veggies up.  Everytime I tried to stir it around, stuff would go splashing everywhere.  The flavor was ok, but nothing special.  I couldn't imagine just eating it plain, so I made sandwiches by scooping it onto french rolls and putting cheese slices on top.  Just seems like a lot of trouble to go through for a couple sandwiches.

I enjoyed this recipe and thought it was a nice spin on the classic combo of sausage/peppers/onions. My only change was that I made it with a mix of small sweet red, green, yellow, and orange peppers instead of just large red and green ones because they were fresher at my grocery store, and I'm glad I did because the mix of colors and flavors from the different peppers was awesome. In the future, I'd deffinately use less hot sauce, because my boyfriend found it almost too spicy to eat.

I bought a big bunch of Italian sausages from Costco and wanted a different way to cook them besides pasta dishes. Pretty good flavors. The aroma of the beer while cooking was overwhelming stinky though.

This was great.  My finiky husband even enjoyed it.    I payed attention to the other posts and I used half the beer and it was fabulous.  Two thumbs up I recommend this to the expert and beginner alike.

Although, I was initially skeptical that the beer would give this a bittery flavor, I was pleasantly surprised it is absolutely a DELICIOUS recipe. I did saute the onions and green peppers first, before browning the sausage, to release the flavors and carmelize the onions. My husband will definitely be asking me to make this dish again soon. Thanks!

We liked this a lot.  The only reason I gave one less star is that I thought it was a little soupy.  I added rice though and made it into more of a jambalaya - the flavor was magnificent!

YUMMY! I am still a beginner cook and was very pleased at how simple this recipe was and had such a fantastic flavor!! My hubby loved it! He ate his on sub rolls and I had mine over rice. I think I prefer it over rice because of the yummy sauce. This is a keeper!!!

I prepared this reluctantly because I usually make this only so-so and made it along with goulash and chicken fingers for a family party.  Well they went nuts. THIS RECIPE IS FABULOUS!!! I used less beer because I upped the recipe to 35 servings and I used the sauce from my pasta but it was just great. A WINNER!!!!!

This couldn't have been simpler. We followed another reviewer's advice and served it over bow tie pasta. I would say that it was a bit on the watery side though, so next time I will reduce the amount of beer.

Great flavor.  Very quick and easy to make.  The second time I made this I added 1/2 can more beer and about 1 cup of bowtie pasta for some starch and an easy one dish meal.  It will become a favortie.

This was good!  My husband and I only eat sausage once in a while and usually made one of two ways, so this was a nice change.  He said, "It's a keeper."  :)  I cut the recipe in half and used dried herbs since I didn't have fresh ones.  I also only used green peppers since we didn't have red ones in the house.  I agree with the review that said the smell is NOT good when you first add the beer & veggies, but then the beer smell cooks away and the result is yummy!  We ate it over rice, but it would also be great as a sandwich on a big, crusty roll.

Didn't use Italian sausages, just some I had in the freezer, some spicy lamb ones and some normal pork ones but it was a hit.  Very tasty, easy to prepare after a days work, good with plain rice.

This recipe is nice but there is something missing. Either a different mixture of herbs are needed or a sweetness to combat the bitterness of the beer (I used Becks). Will try again as my boyfriend loves sausages but will play around with the flavours.

I used this recipe "as is" until it came time to add the sausages back to the pot, then I stuck it all in the crock pot to simmer for a couple of hours.  My husband loved it...so much so that I only got a little taste!

This was the best sausage and peppers dish I have ever had. Brought it to a party and it was a HIT. Only problem I had with this dish was I didn't have big enough pan to cook all this so at the end where you mix everything together to cook it through, I poured it into large baking pan instead and popped it in the oven, 375° for 20 minutes.. Came out perfect.

I guess this was pretty good.  It's a hearty dish, but something seemed to be missing.  It looks great on presentation anyway.

Hi folks, I'm glad so many people enjoy my recipe, over the years I've read every review, and it makes me so proud!!  Since I came up with this recipe, I've cut alcohol completely out of my diet, and have made the recipe using non-alcoholic beer and it works out just as well!
