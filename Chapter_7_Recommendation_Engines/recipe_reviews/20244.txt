As a resident of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, I've made and eaten saskatoon pie many times. This recipe is excellent. Simmering the berries softened them and made the flavors blend together nicely, taking away a bit of the berry's tartness. It also had a nice texture, not too runny when served warm.

My grandmother would have been so pleased! I picked Saskatoon berries all night last night and wondered if I'd ever find a recipe that would make a good pie. Well... this is it! I would have give this a 5-star rating, but determined that the recipe was was improved just a touch by adding 1 tbsp. of cinnamon to 5 cups of Saskatoons. Absolutely delicious and ridiculously easy to make. Bravo!

While on a hunting trip in Northern Alberta my husband brought home saskatoon berries that was given to him by the
farmers wife which they had picked and froze.  I made this pie today and it is the BEST pie that we ever ate.  I did not cook
the berries first, and it gave the pie a very slightly berry crunch which made it extra flavorful.  All I can say is that I wish 
we had more saskatoon berries in our freezer for more pies.  Truly a wonderful and delightful pie.

Fabulous recipe, thanks for posting! I crushed the berries a little before boiling and made slits in the top crust. Otherwise, the consistency was great, the recipe is fantastic as is! Regina, Saskatchewan.

Found these berries on the property I was renting, so I decided to be a domestic diva and make some pies.  It was so good we did not mind smiling with bluish cast teeth for the rest of the night.  And my guests asked to bring some home with them. Diva, I am!

Great recipe!  I thought that there may be to much sugar but it turned out just the right sweetness for our taste.  I added a small amount of cornstarch to thicken up the liquid when simmering it and that seemed to work great... Highly recommended recipe!

I have picked my share of Saskatoons as a child, but the aunts were always in charge of the pie.  I used this recipe to bake my first pie (ever) and it got rave reviews.  They have officially handed the torch down to me.  I followed the recipe except added some corn starch at the end as per previous review.  Already have two more in the oven.  Super easy!

I used to pick Saskatoons every summer in Manitoba as I was growing up and Saskatoon pie was a welcomed reward for our efforts in the sand hills. I now live in Southwestern ON and have a Serviceberry Tree as a landscape feature right at our front door. However the birds usually beat me to the berry harvest plucking each one off as it ripens. This year I guarded my tree with a fruit tree netting and got an ice cream pail full of Saskatoons off it yesterday, enough for 5 pies. I was delighted with this recipe and found the berries much more tender, juicy and flavorful than my best childhood memory of Saskatoon Pie. Boiling the berries first made the berries more tender and juicy. The lemon juice enhanced the flavour and seemed to get the natural fruit pectin working, so the pie was not too runny. It is perfect sweetness and very delicious. This Recipe is a keeper! Thanks I'm delighted!

My mom always made Saskatoon pie, when the fruit is ready.  It's my favourite "fruit" pie.  I've never made it until now ... delicious recipe.  My whole family loved.

Wonderful pie!  I used 5 cups of frozen saskatoons and cooked them without water.  Used 2/3 cup sugar instead of 3/4 cup.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe. Used the No Fail Pie crust recipe from the Crisco box.  Hubby enjoyed the pie even though he doesn't like the texture of saskatoon berries.  My three kids ages 1.5, 3 & 6 loved it!

Wow! What really surprised me was the intense almond flavor (from the seeds, I guess). I have a serviceberry tree, but I've only eaten the berries fresh or put them in muffins and scones before. 

Maybe it was the berries I used, since they were very ripe and the seeds were a bit large, but the pie tasted like some sort of almond torte rather than like fruit. That's not a complaint - it was very good, just unexpected. If I hadn't made it myself, I'd probably wonder if the crust was made from almonds, or if there was a layer of marzipan under the filling.

I made the filling exactly as written, and It was thick enough to hold together nicely. I see no reason to add any additional thickener unless perhaps you don't pre-cook the berries.

Instead of a 2-crust pie, I made it like I make my Concord grape pie -- a single crust, with a flour/sugar/butter crumb topping.

Perfect! We used frozen berries and found that simmering it for about 30minutes to an hour made the sauce around them darker and more fragrant. I don't like using flakey crusts so I found an amazing recipie in my Company's Coming Pie's Cookbook that makes a sweeter softer dough.  Thank you for this recipie! they are so good!! We made 6 pies in one night, two extra deep ones and four regular ones. MMM :) boyfriend from Herbert Sask and he just loves them!!

easy and great. I put in 5 cups of berries and increased the flour,sugar and limejuice (all I had) porportionally. Next time, try adding more flour or a bit of corn starch as it was quite runny.  But... great.

I added one cup of fresh raspberries to the 4 cups of saskatoons after it was finished boiling and right before putting the pie together.... This was a great addition.

Oh my gosh, this was insanely good. We have a serviceberry tree and I picked a ton of berries so I decided to make a pie. It was sweet and tart at the same time and tasted a bit like cherry pie. Forgot about the butter, but didn't even notice. I wish serviceberries were in season year round!

Great recipe. I read the other reviews and added about a tablespoon of cornstarch, along with 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and a pinch of salt.  I also used the lid of my pOt to strain the liquid into the bowl of dry ingredients, whisked that together, and poured it back into the pot -  folding it with the berries.

I tried to make it exactly as written but i actually forgot to dot with butter, and i also added jello crystals to the filling so it would not be runny, (my husbands grandmas advice) let me just say this pie was incredible, i dont even like pie and rarely eat it but had to do something with the saskatoon berries growing in my yard. Im thankful i chose this recipe, i cant say it enough, THIS WAS awesome!!!

Made this with freshly picked saskatoons and it was delicious.  As another member mentioned I always add cinnamon,  also I almost had to double the recipe for a 9" pie.  But that also depends how much filling you like.

My family went to a saskatoon berry u-pick farm and came home with a giant bucket full of berries. I had no idea what to do with them, so I came on this site to look for a recipe, and found this one for saskatoon pie. I'm so glad I did, this pie was delicious. I followed the recipe exactly and used Ruth's Grandma's Pie Crust from this site. This pie has a great taste and texture, and there's almost a hint of dark cherry flavour after it's baked. If you have access to saskatoon berries, definitely give this pie a try.

Loved this recipe, so simple yet so tasty!  I used cornstarch instead of flour and added in about a cup of raspberries just before I took the mixture off the stove.  Everyone loved it!

My first attempt at using Saskatoons -  a total success!  The recipe was easy to follow with no "weird" ingredients.  And the result was delicious!  The berries were cooked perfectly,  juicy, tender and flavorful.  I got rave reviews - thanks Liz!

It came out delicious the first time. I substituted white sugar for coconut sugar that time because it is better for you and used solidified coconut oil instead of butter. The second time I used maple syrup in replacement of sugar and almond flour instead of regular flour and yet again it came out wicked awesome. Next time I will try combining Saskatoon berries and blueberries.

I absolutely adore this recipe. I’ve made Saskatoon lies before that turned out dry. The secret is cooking them down a little just like the recipe says. I also cook the berries down like this and use it to top cheesecake. (Yummy!)

We have saskatoon berry bushes growing wild on our property and pick a pile every Summer and then freeze as much as we can!  I've used fresh and frozen berries and both ways came out great! Makes a delicious pie, not too sweet and pairs very well with ice cream! It has been a hit everywhere I take it!!! Lots of requests from the kids too!

Loved this filling. I used frozen saskatoons and increased the amount to about 6 cups. I decreased the water as they were frozen, and otherwise left the recipe the same. Delicious!

The 4 Star is because I reduced the sugar quantity and increased the amount of berries but otherwise I was extremely happy with the results. Hadn’t baked a Saskatoon pie for many years and it was very popular at Christmas.  Cooking the berries was new as well but it turned out great.

I found simmering the berries softened them and made the pie more palateable and tasty.  Next time I make this pie I plan to add more berries so it's bursting and maybe add a little more simmering time.  I am hoping this will open up some of the berries to add more of a jam like consistency to the pie.

Tasted great it wasn't too runny and berries weren't hard. Although I am glad I doubled the recipe because I definitely would not have had enough to fill the pie. I recommend using 5 or 6 cups for this recipe.

Best pie ever!!!  Followed the recipe but added 5 cups of saskatoons..my daughter requested a whole pie for herself...so am making 2 more tonight ...yum!  I brush the bottom crust  with slightly beaten egg white  before adding the berries and the top crust with slightly beaten egg yolk and some whipping cream, after fluting the edges.

Followed suggestions of others: 5 cups of berries (I added some cherries which were getting a bit old: quartered them.)  This is better than a recipe I had tried last year -- boiling the berries made them more the consistency of blueberries when the pie was done.  Very tasty.

Awesome pie! I did the recipe as it is and I think is great. Loved the nutty flavor and the consistency is just perfect. I would like to try adding cinnamon as some reviewers suggested and see how it comes out, just being curious here lol.

This is the first pie I attempted to make, with service berries from my local park. It turned out WONDERFULLY. The filling was very thick and rich, not watery at all. Not too sweet, not too tart, and was gone within the evening. I used a doubled recipe of http://allrecipes.com/recipe/24094/butter-flaky-pie-crust/ for the crust, and it was perfect and super easy. Will be making this again soon!!

This recipe is almost word for word from one passed down to me from my mom, an original Saskatoon resident.  Only difference is instead of 3 T. flour, hers calls for 2 T. quick cooking tapioca.  It has never let me down.  Oh so good.  About to bake one for a family get together.

Really good basic recipe. Only added a pinch of vanilla powder, a pinch of cinnamon, a very light pinch of nutmeg, and some very light icing sugar on top. Had people asking for seconds after a large meal. Don't forget the vanilla ice-cream!

This is a great recipe!  Not too sweet or too tart,or too runny or too dry; it was just right.  Because I had extra saskatoons, I used 5 cups of berries and upped the sugar by another tablespoon, which filled the crust nicely (4 cups wouldn't have been enough).  Great recipe, and a nice way to enjoy the fruits of the family activity of going berry picking.

First time I ever tried making saskatoon pie myself, and this is my first review ever on AllRecipes.com and I just wanted to say that this was the best pie I've ever had. Saskatoons are my favorite berries of all time, I grew up eating them. So this pie was perfect as it was, and got eaten up very fast, even when I asked the fam to save some! lol  can't find my picture now otherwise I would have posted it too..happy baking!

Made the pie using frozen/partly thawed berries.  I threw in a couple TB of tapioca to help absorb some of the extra moisture (that frozen berries produce) and the pie was excellent.

Loved this recipe, easy and delicious.  I added 1 tbsp of Tapioca to the berries while they were cooking for a thickener and 1 Tbsp of Cinnamon.  Everyone loves this pie.

Saskatoons are plentiful where we camp, and this year was a bumper crop. I had enough for three pies so I tripled the recipe. Delicious! Took some to work for a few people that grew up rural, just to give them a taste of their childhood! I will apply this recipe to blueberries, if I am lucky enough to score some this summer. Great recipe!

Really good, great consistency as other reviewers have said. A true 'Toon pie as my great aunt commented. Would have given 5 stars but found it a bit sweet (could have been my berries). Adjusted the sugar on the next pie and it was awesome. Thanks!
