I have made this soup just as the recipe says and it is GREAT. I have also made it with chicken now that the holidays are over and there isn't any left over turkey,and it is just as Great. Will enjoy this all year round.

It was delicious, except I felt like it was lacking a flavor. Instead of using sweet potato I used Russet so that might be it.

This is the first turkey soup I've ever made that tasted wonderful. I love turkey soup but I usually love OTHER people's turkey soup. Now I love mine! I didn't have the bay leaf or sage leaves so I added thyme, rosemary, basil a touch of poultry seasoning and sat and pepper. Yummers!

This was great, I was really impressed with the way it turned out! Didn't measure, just used left over dark turkey meat and 'scrapes' that I had brined and soup turned out very hearty. I think the biggest change is I used white potatoes instead of the sweet potatoes and used Ditalini pasta instead of the ultra micro kind. Anyway, thanks for sharing.

My picky toddlers had mixed responses to this, but my husband and I both loved this recipe! Great mix of veggies, turkey and noodles, and relatively quick to make. I did end up adding a bit of salt and pepper at the end and then it was perfect.

This Turkey soup was just what we needed a couple of days after Thanksgiving! I used our leftover turkey and it hit the spot! I highly recommend this Thanksgiving soup to anyone whose tired of turkey sandwiches. I will defiantly use this recipe again.

Did a quick search for an easy Turkey Veg Soup recipe, with so many to choose from this one seemed the quickest/easiest; I used a smoked turkey leg and this recipe turned out amazing.

OMG!  This was so delicious!!!  I normally fiddle with recipes adding this or that but I stayed true to the ingredients and was so pleased.  My  3 y/o ate it all up and hubby and I had seconds.  I bought turkey cutlets and boiled them separately prior to making the soup.  Did have to add salt and pepper at the end to taste but that was just because of the broth I used.  Used ditalini pasta and was perfect for this soup.  Will definitely make again.

Pretty good soup.  I followed the recipe with two minor exceptions:  I used about 1.5 cups (instead of 1/2 cup) of Skinners Wide Egg Noodles as the pasta, and I used white meat turkey instead of dark meat.  The broth I used was home made turkey broth made from our Thanksgiving turkey carcass.  The rub I'd used on my turkey added some flavor to the soup, otherwise I think some rosemary would have been nice.  Also would probably be good with wild rice.  This will likely become my weekend-after-Thanksgiving staple recipe.

Simple comfort food and a great way to use holiday leftovers.  I did not have a sweet potato so I left it out. Served with salad and cornbread.

Delicious! I used my leftover thanksgiving turkey carcass cooked in the crock pot all afternoon with the onion, garlic, fresh sage and added tarragon. The last hour I added red potatoes, butternut squashed cubed small. I added my green beans a few min. before serving because they were leftovers and I did not want to overcook them. I added 2 more cloves of garlic and extra celery leaves for depth of flavor. I think the squash added to the flavor as well. I did cook a bit of rice in chicken stock on the side but it was not necessarily as this soup stands on it's own and was very hearty without pasta or rice. I think the fresh sage is especially important, don't skip this ingredient if it is available! I will be keeping this recipe, yum...

Love this. Didn't use sage and added marjarom, thyme, rosemary, and a little crushed red pepper. Didn't use green beans or sweet potato. Opted for fresh baby spinach at the end for some greenery. Yummy.

This was a great recipe for boring leftover Turkey!  The sweet potatoes, garlic and green beans are a great mix that adds good flavors to an otherwise boring meat.

Very good soup!  Not sure why some find it to be bland unless they did not salt and pepper to taste.  I used about 1 and 1/2 tsp of dried sage and leftover white turkey meat rather than dark meat.  I will be making this again!

Really good, I used regular potatoes instead of sweet. I doubled the recipe and froze half for later.

Soup was very good (with extra seasonings) and a nice treat for leftover turkey.  I did make my own turkey stock from my leftover turkey and used peas and corn because I did not have any green beans.  I also added more belle's seasoning because I thought the soup needed more flavor.

I was looking for a turkey soup that was a little different - not the usual white potato or noodle type.  This was GREAT!  I made it just as written, except that I used my homemade turkey broth from the turkey carcass. I didn't have sage leaves, so I used bay leaf, and a little dried tarragon and basil.  The sweet potato/turkey is a wonderful flavor combo, with all the other veg & orzo to give it body.  Husband & after-Thanksgiving guests all loved it.

This soup is great for a cold day. I used half vegetable broth and half chicken broth since that was all I had, and used a white potato instead of the sweet potato.

Perfect Turkey soup leftovers soup - not too much prep time needed and most of the ingredients are available right after Thanksgiving fresh.  Fresh vegetables taste better in my eyes so I used that instead.  I used my turkey juices as well in addition to chicken stock I premade.

I will make this again next time I make turkey, and didn't have to make many changes! I made my own turkey broth, and I find this helped greatly with the flavouring. I also had leftover fresh thyme and oregano so added about a tbsp of each, on top of the fresh sage and found this much more flavourful. I also added 4 cloves versus two, an additional 2 cups broth, and 2 sweet potatoes and 2 regular potatoes, rather than potatoes. It turned out great! Make it with Chef John's buttermilk biscuits:)

I knew with the full amount of liquid, this would be more soupy than I prefer. My minimal changes were halving the liquid, 1.5 the orzo and just because for flavor, 1/4 teaspoon of turmeric. Ended up hearty and thick, just as hoped.

This was the first time I made turkey soup, and I questioned the lack of seasoning of this recipe. I ended up adding salt, pepper, thyme, rosemary, and an extra couple of cloves of garlic (you can never have too much garlic). I used golden yukon potatoes because that was what I had on hand, and did not have any green beans to throw in. After cooking the vegetables, I just threw everything in and let it all simmer for a couple of hours until around dinner time. It was very flavorful and turned out to be a huge hit.

The only thing I would change next time is to cut out the pasta or use larger sized noodles. I used orzo and it was hardly noticeable in the soup, not to mention you already have the potatoes as your starch.

I thought this soup was great. I used a rotisserie chicken instead of turkey and I didn’t use sweet potato. I thought it needed a little more flavor so I added some dried thyme and that made a huge difference! I also added oregano and black pepper, but it is really the thyme that gave it the flavor it needed.

Fantastic recipe.  I boiled the carcass and used my own turkey stock, controlling the salt.  I also added fresh chopped broccoli and corkscrew noodles.   Everyone lovvvvvvved  it.  Such a great use of the turkey meat, right off the bone.

This was a great recipe to use up those Thanksgiving leftovers. I always like to make a recipe without substitutions before I review but I did not have the sage, bay leaf or tiny pasta on hand, so I used fresh thyme and shell pasta instead. All in all it was a great fresh-tasting soup that was even better the next day! The great foundation of the soup allows for lots of creativity as well. Definitely a keeper!

I used this recipe after thanksgiving and it turned out really well. I did have some changes such as using homemade turkey stock, I left out the sweet potato and for pasta used medium egg noodles. I really liked the addition of fresh green beans to the soup.

This was absolutely delicious.  I agree that it does need salt and pepper, but other than that, it was absolutely delicious.  I will definitely make this again.

Never made soup and it’s probably my fault it’s not a 5 star. However I did enjoy it but it just needed a little something extra for flavour. I will make it again but need to figure out what else to add. Any ideas?

Turned out great! Filling and lots of flavor. I did add a bit of salt and pepper at the end for an extra touch. Never did sweet potatoes in a soup before, they add a nice taste of sweetness in there.

Very yummy soup. I did modify it however. I used button mushrooms instead of green beans, white potatoes instead of sweet potatoes  and barley instead of pasta. I would definitely make it again.

My overall impression was "meh, it's okay".  I added some additional seasonings to try and give it some umph.  The orzo soaked up a lot of the broth so it wasn't very soupy the first night.  When I heated it back up the next night I added a can of broth + a can of water and even added more orzo and it was better definitely better the next night.  I kept thinking a lemon-flavored turkey/chicken would have made it a lot better.  Overall it was a good enough soup, but just keep in mind that at the end of the day it's still just turkey soup...

Maybe it was because my turkey was grilled and therefore had a smokey flavor, but that combined with the sweet potato made a weird flavor combination that I didn't care for.

I used my leftover turkey carcass to make turkey stock and used that instead of chicken broth. I also left out the noodles. It turned out awesome!

Great post Thanksgiving recipe to use as guideline. We added some extra vegetables, fresh herbs, and a squeeze of lemon. Delicious and hearty, and easy to customize!

This recipe is so easy, and adaptable!  I mostly followed the directions, but added a couple more spices, including marjoram and parsley.   I also added some cooked wild rice.  My husband raved about it  and wanted leftovers the next day!

This was a really tasty soup!  I used turkey broth made from the carcass. Used the breast meat left from our Christmas dinner. Definitely a keeper.

This was an excellent and very easy soup.  I used white turkey meat since that was what we had and added a bit more broth, more noodles, and more meat.  Loved the sweet potato and bean.  I think it would work just as well with chicken.

I added some cream of chicken soup and some cayenne pepper and I loved it. It was good even the kids ate it!
