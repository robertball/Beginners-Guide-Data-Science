THIS IS AMAZING!!! I made it exactly as stated with the exception of using heavy whipping cream in place of the milk. It was subtle but very flavorful. Pure delight. I will be making this again soon!!

For a novice cook this was very easy to make.

I made it for Canadian Thanksgiving and my family loved it.

Donâ€™t think it needs the sugar, felt it was too sweet- I have cooked white/sweet potatoes together before with no sugar and like it better.

Made this for a family gathering and everyone loved it. Will definitely be making this again.  Followed the recipe and see no need to change anything!

I gave a three star because I did not want the sweetness of brown sugar; added some garlic salt, smoked paprika, and used sour cream instead of milk. I really like the result. The combination produces a mild sweetness.

This was good, but, made exactly as described, it's a tad bland. I will likely try it again with double the spices.
