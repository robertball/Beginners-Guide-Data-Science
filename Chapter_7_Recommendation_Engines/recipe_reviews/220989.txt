Excellent flavor!  Make sure that you don't over cook your roast - I put the glaze on at internal temp of 135 and next time I would do that at 125  - and cook to not quite 145.  You want the FINAL temp. to be 145, after resting.  This is company worthy and very easy.   Enjoy!

Wow! This was great. Served with Chef John's roasted vegetables and BBQ'd corn on the cob. Took advice of others and halved the salt. Used the pan drippings, some white wine and corn starch to make a sauce to pour over carved roast. Family and guests just about finished the whole thing. This is a keeper!

This was THE BEST PORK LOIN I have EVER had.  I have several pork loin recipes but this is the one that I will use from now on.  It was juicy and very tender.  I did adjust my time to an hour instead of 40 minutes and then the 15 minutes after the glaze was added.  You will not be disappointed.

This was the best pork loin roast I have ever made bar none. I served it with grilled plums (with a spoon of goat cheese in each), with a drizzle of spicy mango balsamic vinegar, a sprig of rosemary for garnish, (also used a bit of fresh rosemary minced in the brine) and it was incredible. A hit at my dinner party.

This brine was fantastic!  Was feeling "creative" in the kitchen so added some Maldava Coconut sugar as well to the brine.  Pork stayed in the brine for 24 hours.  Went completely off the grid when it came to cooking the pork.   Used a Terra Cotta "roaster" normally used for Whole Chicken (It is soaked in water for at least an hour so the food will not dry out when in the oven).  Covered the entire bottom of the roaster in pearl onions, added some maple syrup, quite a bit of maldava coconut sugar (does not taste like coconut), the mustard, salt, dried ginger, fresh rosemary and chopped garlic.  Seasoned the pork with salt, pepper, and maple syrup.  Placed the pork on top of the onions, packed the coconut sugar on the top of the pork to form a crust.  Cooked in the Terra Cotta Chicken Roaster (which is a covered roaster).  Once cooked to temperature (always check with a thermometer!), switched the over to broil, took the top off the roaster and put the roast back into the oven so the sugar crust would actually become a crust and caramelize.  Let the roast rest uncovered -- did not tent with foil for fear the coconut sugar crust would become soggy.  This was fantastic!! This was the most flavorful pork I have ever made -- and am quite certain it was because of the fantastic brine from Chef John -- the combination of flavors was delicious.  Thanks, Chef John!  I would have never gotten so creative in the kitchen without this recipe! Am making your beef goulash tonight!

This was very good - but I found it just a little salty. I had two roasts, so I doubled the recipe for the brine and maybe that affected it? Might just slightly cut back on the salt next time. I deglazed the pan with a little white wine after browning the roasts and left them to roast in those juices in the oven. Added a little more wine about halfway thru the cooking time. Very good.

Really good!  I didn't have real maple syrup; just used the regular maple-flavored stuff I had in the cupboard.  I used the stoneware insert from my crockpot to brine the roast and that worked well.  Couldn't think of anything else that was deep enough to completely submerge the roast; my roast was three pounds so slightly larger.  I used my (new) cast-iron Dutch oven for roasting.  I don't have a meat thermometer so I probably ended up leaving the roast in the oven a bit too long, although it was still moist and tender.  (I did cover during the last third or so of the roasting time.)  I also didn't use the glaze as I wanted a meal-in-one and didn't think the flavors would go all that well with potatoes, carrots, and onions.  I will most definitely use this method whenever I cook a pork roast but tweak the seasoning to go with whatever else we're having.  The seasoning in this recipe is very good but would have been better had I selected different sides.

My local grocer sells gorgeous whole, DIYB (do it yourself butchering) pork loins--dirt cheap. Until I found Allrecipes (and Chef John), I only had one recipe for this succulent cut. {I put maple syrup over green beans one time--it's delicious on just about anything!} This recipe produces meat with excellent depth and complexity of flavors, without seeming "overthought". Super trendy take on honey mustard sauce soon to become a classic. Thank you, Chef. Also thanks Baking Nana for reminding me that the meat is still cooking after its time in the oven. My only wonder is if you can brine, then freeze the loin, will it turn out the same result after defrosting in the fridge... would the defrost count as brining time even though the meat is not sitting in the brine. ??

This was delicious.  Even my husband, who is not usually excited by new recipes, said "this is REALLY good!" My dinner guests raved!  I will definitely make this again.  I needed a larger pork roast (about 4.5 lbs). I increased the brine by 50% so that the entire roast would be covered.  I refrigerated overnight, and it was perfect.

Wow was this ever good. I had pretty much given up on pork roasts because they were always so dry. This one was almost as tender and a tenderloin. And I even screwed it up a bit. I forgot to sear it before I put it in the oven, forgot the glaze, and overcooked it a bit, but it was still great! I didn't find it too salty at all. That brine was phenomenal! I'll never make another pork roast without brining it first.

This is one of the best pork tenderloins I have ever made. It was a touch salty, so I will put 1/8 C kosher salt instead of 1/4 C next time. Very moist and flavorful - I highly recommend using REAL maple syrup and not the flavored stuff. I also used all the drippings in the pan as a tasty sauce to serve on top the pork. EXCELLENT recipe and, if followed exactly is only 7 Weight watchers points plus per serving

Could not have turned out better. The best pork loin roast ever. I didn't alter anything. Made up the brine the night before - in the refrigerator overnight. Immersed the loin at 8.0aam and took it out of the brine at 4.00pm. Guests raved about it.

The second time I made this loin roast I left it in the brine overnight from about 9.00pm until about 4.00pm the following afternoon before removing it from the brine and preparing it for the searing and oven. I think the longer brining is better.

Best pork loin we've ever had. I made it exactly as the recipe called for and it was flavorful, juicy and simply amazing. Husband and 15 year old twins loved it - the only bad part was no leftovers. Next time I'll double the sauce, as it was perfect as well - and this comes from a family that doesn't love mustard.

I thought the maple-dijon glaze was amazing; I will definitely use that again.  But I really don't think 10 hours is long enough to brine a 2 1/2 pound loin.  I could not taste that brine in the meat at all.  If I try this again, I will brine it overnight.

I am always looking for new ways to prepare pork of any kind. I stumbled onto this recipe, and since I had already planned a weekend of cooking, the prep time was ideal. WOW! This was far and away the best pork loin I have ever had! The maple flavor was incredible, and the way that it mixed so well with the Dijon mustard just took it to a whole new level. And the pork! I have never had pork loin that came out so tender and moist! I will definitely be making this again, and I believe I will start playing around with brines as a whole! Just incredible!!

This is an excellent pork brine. I used on 4 bone in pork chops (a lil over 2lbs). I made the brine up the night before and then put the pork chops in before work. My husband grilled the chops.  They came out tender and juicy. He thought they were excellent. I would definitely use this again. They are company worthy chops.

Yummy!! Another recipe of Chef John's that is a keeper. For those who follow this recipe, don't be cheap and ensure to use real maple syrup. On a side note, I had to sign up to Allrecipes to compliment Chef John. Keep up the great work!

I made this for Christmas dinner.  My very critical mother-in-law said it was the best pork roast she had ever had.  The subtle taste of the sweet maple really enhances the pork.

I followed this recipe exactly except that I added less salt to make the brine as recommended by other reviewers - about 1/3 cup salt, 3.5 cups of water and 1/2 cup of maple syrup (this plus the loin and the other ingredients filled my 8 cup batter bowl).  I also followed the advice of Baking Nana and cooked the roast to an internal temperature of 125, added the Dijon/Maple glaze and then completed roasting to 142. Amazingly, (I love a recipe that is accurate) this took 40 minutes followed by 15 minutes exactly!  My roast was 2 lb 4 oz.  When the roast came out of the oven the glaze was beautifully set; it was so gorgeous actually, I couldn't believe that I had done it! It was super delicious and moist although I wish that I could taste more maple inside the meat. This is my first time brining with anything other than salt so I am not sure if it is fair to expect more sweetness and maple flavour. I will make this recipe again when it comes time to impress the in-laws.

I have subscribed to this site for years and have never felt compelled to review a recipe ... before now. I have used this recipe many times, and each time I am rewarded with a roast that is succulent and flavourful. Simply superb!!! I can think of no better way to describe the results achieved with this easy method of preparation. Lean pork can be dry, but this method produces perfection. A critical element of becoming successful with this recipe is to carefully measure the temperature of your roast in order to avoid overcooking, which is the primary reason for failure to reach the desired outcome. Try it. You'll like it!!!

Gave this to my mother as a suggestion for how to make the pork loin she was defrosting for our Christmas dinner. SOOO glad I did. Possibly some of the best meat I've ever tasted, so moist, evenly flavored, and delicious. She used a meat thermometer, think that helped make it perfect. Trust all the 5 star recipes, this one is a keeper and repeater.

This is excellent!  I'm not a huge pork fan, I generally find it too dry and lacking flavour.  I followed the recipe exactly with one exception, I didn't use  any red pepper flakes.   
Any leftovers I had were just as tasty as it was fresh out of the oven!

For the record, I'm only rating based on the brine itself. The brine is SO good. Pork tenderloin, to me, is a very mild but pleasantly flavored meat so it's very easy to overpower it. I used this brine (I recommend brining the full 10 hours if you can), patted them off, and put them in my smoker with apple wood chips. One hour at 270 degrees, then an hour at 225 degrees, and the result was absolutely blissful. A couple of times during the smoke, I brushed the tenderloins with maple syrup and sprinkled with kosher salt. Mild smoke, mild sweet, mildly salty. Perfection.

I only had a small loin so I reduced the ingredients and cook time accordingly.  I only had maple-flavored syrup but it was delicious, moist and tender.  This recipe is a definite keeper and I will probably invest In some real maple syrup but I am not sure if I could stand it if it's any better!  :) 
p.s.  I brined it overnight in the refrigerator.

This was amazing, I allowed mine to brine for 8hrs and the out side was so tasty. I didn't change anything in the ingredients except that I had to substitute the red pepper flakes for cayenne pepper. I'm wondering if I can do this in a slow cooker? If anyone knows please let me know. Thanks Chef John!!

This recipe was by far the best pork I have ever made. My hubby is a picky eater & doesn't like condiments so I didn't use the Dijon mustard. I used kosher salt like some people said & I didn't have pure maple syrup so I used Log Cabins syrup. We didn't even glaze it!I wasn't sure it was cooked enough because it looked pink inside but I trusted the internal thermometer & it did read 145 degrees. I noticed in the photo gallery above that it can look pink but be fully cooked. I pulled it out at about 135 degrees & watched it go up to 145 as it sat on the stove. I will definitely make this again. We had NO leftovers which is very unusual for pork in our home!

I wanted to make this with a pork loin roast as the recipe suggests but at the butcher's those roasts were small and looked to be lacking in any fat at all ( to me that means tasteless), so I opted for a tied boneless pork blade roast that was 3.5 lbs and nicely marbled.  I made the brine as described in the recipe but increased the ingredients by half  to accommodate the larger roast. I also added 3/4 tsp of liquid smoke to the brine and I'm glad I did. You have to be stingy with liquid smoke...too much and it dominates but in this case it was a nice underpinning for the maple flavour. The blade roast rendered its fat and was so lovely and moist without being the leas bit greasy. I took it out of the oven to glaze when it was 125ºF, then returned it to the oven for another 15 minutes. Next time, I will cook it at this stage to 145ºF on the meat thermometer since the slices were a wee bit pink in the middle but the ends were fine.  I made extra dijon-maple syrup glaze and fellow diners spooned it liberally over meat  and green beans  -  and loved it also. I rounded out the feast with mashed potatoes and  cumin-maple roasted pepper squash.  Great meal. Thanks, Chef John.

Must say that I screwed this up a little and it still came out tasty.  Albeit the pork loin was a little dry, the overall taste was delicious and the instructions easy to follow.  My problem is I had a 5 lbs pork loin and tried to use the formula given (20 minutes per pound) and I pulled it out even 10 minutes earlier and got my internal temperature right where it was suggested, but it came out a little on the dry side.  Not to worry because the glaze compensated for my mistake and the overall texture was fine.  Just wish I could have had the juicy meat demonstrated in the video.  Next time I’ll cook for less time.

Made as is but let it sit in the brine for four days then baked it.  I baked mine at a higher temp as I like to cook pork at 400 F.  Was absolutely delicious and am making it again this week, it's in the fridge right now in the brine.  What a simple and delicious recipe.

Super easy and flavorful.  The brine really helped the pork loin stay moist.  Although mine sat in the fridge for close to 15 hours.  I skipped the glaze and it was still wonderful.

Great brine for pork! I think next time I will use apple cider for the liquid. I smoked my 2 pork loins at 200 for 3.5 hours and they were moist and tender. I got rave reviews.

i cut the cooking time by 5 minutes, because the loin I used was a little on the small side, and it was still slightly overcooked. So next time, I will check on it at least 5 minutes earlier. Otherwise, great flavor. Don't taste much mustard, so I may add a little next time.

This was a big hit at my house. I cooked the brine and cooled it then soaked the pork for 2 days. I then made a sauce with the pan dripppings and Medeira wine. I reduced the wine and finished it with butter.

Ok, this is the second pork loin recipe that I've tried from All Recipes, the other being the one using balsamic vinegar. No contest! This recipe is a lot more flavourful and looks more appetizing as well! It's not as easy to make as the other one but it's not hard and the extra effort is well worth it!

this was AMAZING! Came out perfectly! Our pork loin came with two cuts so I put the mustard maple glaze on one and left the other without. My boyfriend loved the glaze and I adored the recipe without. Will definitely add this to my future dinner plans

We made this pretty much as written and it was delicious.  My husband used Montreal Steak Seasoning instead of salt and pepper.  Since the weather was beautiful we grilled rather than baked the loin, but I am sure it would be very good either way!

Excellent recipe! I ended up grilling the roast in our Green Egg and it turned out spectacular. The brine and glaze really helped keep this lean cut moist and flavorful.

WHAM-O! This is the recipe that makes the saying, "...would make shoe leather taste good" a reality. I would trust this recipe to a very expensive or large piece of pork to, even something as special as a crown roast! It was especially great when made in a pressure cooker ( how I made it for Easter) I was pleasantly surprised with not only how tasty the meat was but how easy it was to make once I got the brine done. I cannot say enough good about it. 
If you want to make it exceptional, go the extra mile and buy real maple syrup. You will be rewarded!!!

Thank you! I’ve finally learned how to make flavorful, tender, moist pork loin! I’m definitely cooking this the next time I have company for dinner.

This was so delicious - reminded me of maple bacon or sausage. I left the pork loin in the brine overnight as other reviewers suggested. Christmas dinner was a hit!

I did not change anything except that I forgot to put the maple syrup on on the last time baking.
It was delicious. I really loved the sweet taste of the pork.
I'll make this again. Thank you

Super moist and darn tasty!  I added dried rosemary to the brine solution just because I love rosemary with pork loin.  Also,  I didn't have  maple syrup so I used Blackburns with a bit of honey  in the finishing glaze. The results were outstanding and my kids and I really enjoyed this!  It's a keeper!

Brined for 6 hours.  Roast was only 1.5 # so used half recipe for brine.  Set timer for 40 minutes, but at 35 the temperature was already up to 175 so applied mustard/maple sauce and just let it rest.  In spite of temperature being over 165 degrees, the pork loin was moist and the taste of the brine was evident and quite delicious.

My pork loin was over 3 lbs and this was still enough brine. I made sure to use kosher salt and did not find the pork to be too salty. I brined for 8.5 hrs and found this to be enough to create a moist pork loin. I increased the amount of maple syrup to the Dijon and basted several times to give more flavor to the meat. Sliced thin-this made excellent  pork sandwiches. The extra brining step makes all of the difference in the world. At 145 degrees the meat did look a little pink and it had a different color to a part of it. Since I cooked the meat ahead of time, I warmed it slowly in 175degree oven with the juice to get rid of the pinkness when it was time to eat.

I made this in a Romertopf clay cooker and layered apples and onions in the bottom with some carrots. It was delicious. My husband said if the company wasn't there, he would have eaten the whole thing himself!

I began making the brine, only to find that the Maple syrup had been used! So, I improvised with honey and brown sugar. Pulled out the pork, only to find that it smelled funky. SO! I pulled out a pork roast from the freezer, set it in the brine in a sealed container to refrigerate for a day or so. Took it out, still partially frozen, and let it set for an hour on the counter. 
I browned the roast as directed, then coated the top with a crust made from brown sugar, dijon mustard, and pepper, and set it on top of a bed of fresh garlic cloves (mixed with the oil in the pan and added a bit of sugar). Covered  roast with foil, then into the oven until done. Uncovered, topped with a thicker coating of the brown sugar and dijon crusting, and set it under broil for about 15-20 minutes. Let it rest.

Defintely a new family favorite! Fairly easy to make. We brined it for about 4 hours because it was last minute. We also added a bit of exclusive Alaskan Birch Syrup Vodka to the brine. We had side dishes of Paremsan Crusted Au Gratin and Lemon Pepper Peas. It was a perfect dinner and super easy to make.

It was GREAT!  I have a real issue with garlic these days, so I just left that out and it was still FABULOUS.  Didn't get quite the browning I expected before putting it in the oven, but it still turned out great!

The pork was tender, moist and quite delicious.  The only downside is that, as others have mentioned, the maple taste was nowhere to be found.  A little disappointed, but I will add more next time and see if that works.  The glaze was awesome!

It was OK, but don't see myself making this again.  Brine made it moist, but there was a strong ginger taste - overpowered all other flavors.  Other reviewers mentioned the sweetness from the maple syrup, but I couldn't taste the maple at all.

I didn't have 8 hours but the flavors sounded great, so I turned this brine into a marinade by omitting the water, decreasing the salt and increasing the amount of maple syrup, and adding a bit of apple cider vinegar to tenderize the meat.  I cooked the roast to 135, it went up to 145 sitting on the counter (I love my meat thermometer!) Served it to extended family on New Years Day, and it was a big hit!  I'll definitely be making this again!

I made this for my evening church group and everyone seemed to love it.  I had never brined anything before so I followed that part of the recipe exactly as written.  But then I made some slight changes.  First I seasoned it with garlic powder and coarse ground black pepper since many people on the reviews felt it was too salty.  Then, rather than cook it in the oven, I cooked it on my grill.  My grill has 4 burners so i shut off the middle two and placed the pork loins over  these middle burners  with the outer two burners set on high so they were cooked indirectly.  (prior to placing the meat over the middle burners, I seared them over the hot outer burners).   It took one and a half hours to 2 hours to cook 3, three  3 pound pieces of pork to get it to 145-150 degrees.  The pork came out perfect and moist.  For the marinade I put in more maple syrup than mustard so that the Dijon flavor didn't dominate it!  Great recipe!

Really good.  Juicy and flavorful.  Browning it in the skillet made a lot of smoke but what a great smell.  I did't get the 8-10 hours of time in the brine, more like 2 hours but seemed to do the job.  I will make it again brining it for the entire time.  My husband's favorite meat is pork and he said this recipe is a keeper.

Excellent.  Family loved it.  I have done this several times and the last couple times left the glaze off, still delicious.  
Gives the meat a unique texture and flavor by soaking in brine.  I use more garlic, and often pour some white wine over the top and place lots of veggies, carrots, onions under meat while roasting in a dutch oven enamel/cast iron pot.

Wonderful flavor. We used the juices from the bottom of the roaster to add to the slices. I will definitely make this again.

Fantastic. My first time making pork chops and it came out great. Maple syrup, mustard and seasonings make it come together. I didn't have the ginger, garlic or rosemary so I used basil, Lawry's seasoning salt, and garlic powder. Still came out amazing! Next time I will reduce the amount of salt, it was a little bit too much but overall A+.

This recipe made me stop lurking and sign up because I had to say thanks and it was amazing. I stumbles upon this while harvesting maple sap in my back yard. SO..... I decided to skip the water and maple syrup and just use maple sap. I don't know how the original worked out, but the maple sap bring was amazing. I assume it's just similar to the watered down maple syrup since that's what fresh sap is ;-)

I made a double batch of brine as my roast was larger and kept the salt at a 1/4 cup. I made the brine the night before, set the loin in around 8:00 am and cooked it at 5:30. Wow the temp went from 110 to 150 fast, so yeah I over cooked it, but it was still pink and amazing. I used a pepper grinder for all pepper in this. Next time I might add more red pepper and make more mustard sauce. My picky 7 year old loved it.

Best pork loin recipe yet! Can't wait to serve this to company. I used half the salt and deglazed the pan with wine, like others suggested. Then poured the juice over for serving.

Excellent!   My son and I really like pork from time to time but my husband doesn't.....until now.   This was the juiciest, most flavorful pork we've ever had.  I used a 2.5lb pork loin, real VT. maple syrup, fresh rosemary because that's all I had, probably a little more garlic and ginger and 1/4 c. salt based on previous comments.   I made the maple/mustard sauce, put most of it on the roast and saved some to serve.   Loved it!   Thanks for the recipe, I can now make pork from time to time.  I'll try this with thick bone-in pork chops and see how he likes them.

Delicious this was by far the best pork loin I have ever made not salty at all and the smell of maple syrup while it was cooking was so good we could hardly wayt for it to be done I will definitely keep the recipe as one of the favorites of my family, thank you for sharing the recipe.

This was amazing. I did cut the salt in half for the brine. I also forgot to add the dijon-maple sauce during cooking, so I served it on the side, which worked great.

This was amazing. Made exactly as instructed except I only had a 1.5 lb. Pork loin so I reduced oven time to 40 minutes total. I used fresh rosemary instead of dried. I also basted the loin periodically after applying the glaze. Next time I'm buying a bigger loin.

This was amazing!!! I made it as written but added apple and onion slices to the pan before putting it in the oven. I also made gravy from the pan drippings. I served it with green beans and roasted potatoes. My kids thought it was one of the best meals I have ever made!

Simply PERFECT!! the only thing I did was cut the salt in 1/2 based on previous reviews. This cooked beautifully, tasted fantastic, looked amazing and everyone in my family enjoyed their meal.  I did brine the roast in a sturdy ziplock bag, so it stayed totally emersed during "brine time!" Thank you Chef John for another FABULOUS recipie.

I haven't tried this yet, but want to. The problem I have is that I have to cut the salt way down low. Anyone have any suggestions how I can make this using a lot less salt. Also, how about using either low salt or salt free maple syrup?

I have made several of Chef John's other receipts and really loved them, so did my quest.

Try placing roast in slow cooker and brine ingredients minus the water and less salt for a world of flavor.

Great brine. You can also use molasses instead of maple syrup. Quite a bit difference in price, brine for  four hours and grill them. Turns out nice  and juicey. I use peppercorns instead of pepper 3 to 4 of them.Please don't  over cook  or grill them.

As others have said this is good enough to make for company.  I did not have cracked pepper, so I subbed 3/4 tsp ground black pepper and that worked just fine in a pinch.  I also skipped the ginger because I did not have any; but, I will be sure to add it next time.  My 11yr old ate all of the food on his plate and made sure to verify that this dish woud be worked into our regular rotation of dinners!  That makes it a keeper for me.

MOIST!!!!!!  Was that the brine??  I did have it in the brine for longer than 10 hours...maybe 12 and it was not salty just increadibly moist.  Will definitely only cook pork tenderloin this way from now on.  Melt in your mouth!!!  Roasted it on the bar-b-que on high then slowly for about a half hour after - basting throughout.  Thank you so much Chef John!!!

The pork was extremely moist. Cooked to 145 or 150. I rinsed the pork after the brine and dried prior to searing. The brine would be good with any treatment not just the mustard finish. I made 2 in a cast iron pan Large one took maybe 18 min and smaller one maybe 14. Cooked at 400.

So many flavors in the brine and the only one that came through was a faint whiff of ginger. I even used a small amount of reserved brine to cook the roast in, but that didn’t help.

I had about given up making pork roasts because I always dry them out. This was the best pork roast ever! My whole family gobbled it up. I used a 5.5lb pork roast so I doubled the brine, exactly as written. So so good. And the glaze is amazing!!

This turned out great.  Made it using a 3.75 boneless pork loin roast.  Was only able to let it soak in the brine for about 6 hours, but that was enough to make a very tender, juicy roast.  Cooking time at 325 degrees was about 1 hour and 15 minutes total. Will definitely make this again.

Made this recipe for my very picky eaters.  They absolutely loved it.  The entire loin was gone in just one meal.  My husband even said, "I want to keep it eating because it is so good, but I'm full."  The pork was tender and so flavorful.  Will be adding to my favorites!

Loved the moistness brining imparted. 
Glaze lacked the “wow factor” I had hoped for.

After being on allrecipes for MANY years and finding a lot of good recipes, none have prompted me to actually write a review before now! I have the world's pickiest husband and he will NOT shut up about this pork! Seriously! What's interesting about this is that he will not eat ANY of the ingredients in this recipe except the actual pork, salt and pepper, and maple syrup. Had he known what was in this prior to tasting it, he would never have even tasted it. He's a very plain food eater. He doesn't like any condiments, vegetables, or spices outside of salt and black pepper. 
All day today, he keeps bringing up how amazing it is and how tender and how moist. He even asked what was in it- I was afraid to tell him, especially the mustard part, but after I told him- he just reiterated how delicious it is! 
If it matters, he is 48 years old so this has been his entire life. He was the child who often sat at the table till bedtime because he was NOT giving in and eating anything he didnt want.
I made this exactly as written,  including the 10 hour brine time and cook time. My pork loin was 2.07 lbs and I used the conversion at the top to change ingredients for 5 servings instead of 6. Thank you so much, Chef John!

This was wonderful. My only change was as recommended I put the glaze on at 125 and took it out at just over 140, and while resting it warmed up to 145. Very tender and wonderful flavor!

Followed the recipe...I had a smaller roast so cook time was altered. It came out juicy and beautiful! I did leave it in the brine for 24 hours before browning and then roasted about 35 min. till almost done then added the glaze for another 15 min. Thank you so much!!!!!

This was the best pork loin that I have made.  My husband loved it.  Will be making this again and again.  I used sugar free syrup because it is all I had and it came out just fine.

I made a pan sauce while the roast was resting. I deglazed the pan with 1/2 cup chicken broth, reduced down a few minutes. Remove from heat and swirl in 1 tablespoon butter. Fantastic!

This was delicious!  I added Brussels Sprouts around the pork loin about half way through the cooking time. I seasoned them first with garlic powder and salt and drizzled them with a little olive oil.

I've never "brined" before. This was SO much more simple than I had ever imagined! The pork loin turned out SO great! The meat was tender and full of flavor. I don't think I have ever made anything so good before.I wanted to keep it all for myself, lol!   THANK YOU!

Made it exactly as the recipe went.  I marinated the pork a little longer, so I omitted the salt when preparing the meat.  Served it with fresh cantaloupe and green grapes.  Clean plates all around!  Used my new programmable meat thermometer and it was perfect.  Very tender and juicy.  Had a bit of left overs so tomorrows dinner is going to be Cuban Sandwiches!

I bought a whole boneless pork loin at Costco yesterday and was looking for something to do with it. I had about six pounds, cut 1/3 into a roast that I applied this marinade to for cooking tonight, 1/3 into a roast for the freezer and another 1/3 into chops.  When I poured the marinade onto the roast I was cooking tonight I found I had more than enough so used the other half on the chops for the freezer, will freeze them pre-marinated, I think that will work fine. .

The texture of the meat came out wonderful, very tender and juicy and the flavour was very nice.  I used about a two pound pork loin roast in a dutch oven, browned stovetop with some onions first and then put the lid on and put in the oven about 375, then immediately reduced the heat to about 250. After about 30 minutes I took the lid off and applied the  dijon/maple combination. Couldn't find my thermometer so went with my gut, worked great. 

The only change I made was due to my taste.  I borrowed a couple spoonfuls of Dijon from my neighbour since I have never bought this (I don't really like any mustard but often include the yellow variety or mustard powder in cooking).  Turns out I do not like Dijon AT ALL.  So I'd maybe brush on yellow mustard with the maple rather than Dijon.  But that's all on me, since I just don't like the flavour. 

Overall, very good, the texture and taste was wonderful. The Dijon taste was tolerable for me but I would not make it with that next time.

Everyone raved about this - the pork was so juicy.  I altered very little.  Seasoned more before browning with extra spices to our liking, and doubled the maple syrup and mustard, keeping half of it to add to to the drippings to make a gravy.  Delicious!

Delicious!  Used 1/2 the salt called for in the brine, we aren’t salty people.  Flavor had depth but very simple dish to execute.  This one is definitely going in the rotation!  Used the rest of my maple syrup in mashed sweet potatoes & served with sweet peas.  Perfect!

I made this for company, in spite of never having made it before (what can I say---I'm a risk-taker) and it turned out really well. I was concerned because more than a few reviewers considered it too salty, but I still made it as directed, and it wasn't too salty at all. That makes me wonder if some of these reviewers used regular table salt for the brine--the recipe should have been specific--instead of kosher? I will say that I think the cook time is too long. When I took it out at 40 minutes to glaze, I put in the instant read thermometer and it was already done enough. I just left it in for another 5 minutes or so, so the glaze could at least heat up a little. Added note is that I had cut a 5-lb pork loin in half, and this meat tasted so good that I prepared the other half the same way, but just wasn't up for greasing up my clean cooktop by browning it at high heat, so I just heated up the iron skillet I was using, then put the meat in and turned it over after a few minutes. Didn't have as nicely browned outside that way, but it tasted just as good, and there was no stovetop cleanup.

This is the best pork I have ever made! I put it in the brine overnight to make it easier the next day. I also used bacon grease from our morning bacon in place of the vegetable oil, and it added amazing flavor! Definitely going to be making this again.

I have continued to buy boneless pork loin when its on sale as it is really lean and gives plenty of leftovers. What I had not liked was how dry it can be. Well, this brine worked wonders! For fun I had some maple bourbon and added it to the brine. I think I brined it too long as it was a bit salty. I went almost 36 hours!  I shoulda read the bottom comments....My fault!
Also, I think in future I'll turn over half way during cooking as bottom half was cooked more than the top half (some almost seemed too rare).
Maybe some maple bacon on top anyone? Might add that too.

The meat was moist, tender and very flavorful.  I roasted it until the internal temperature was 160F because I wanted the pork to be well-done.

This is my most favourite recipe for pulled port and have used pork loin as well as shoulder roast usually intended for pulled pork. Every person who has tried it has loved it. I do not soak in the brine over night if it is too last minute a decision and usually put extra maple syrup in it. I will keep playing with it, but no matter what I do if I keep the recipe to the ingredients, it never fails to impress.

Excellent recipe, but cooking times are far too long. Fortunately, the brining process helps with the overcooking/moisture level.

Turned out great but too salty. If I make this again I'll halve the salt in the brine, and not salt it before cooking. Then I suspect the other non-salt flavors will come through more.

I used some of the suggestions and changed a little.  After brining for 8 hours, I browned  a 5 lb pork loin in a dutch oven on the stove top.  I removed the meat and made a layer of sliced onions, added about 6 minced garlic cloves, several sprigs of fresh rosemary and a few tbs of maple syrup.  The meat was placed on top, dutch oven covered and placed in the preheated oven.  After about an hour and ten minutes, I checked for internal temp every ten minutes.  When it reached 125 degrees I removed the cover, glazed the meat with 2 tbs mustard and 3 tbs maple syrup.  As suggested by others at 135 degrees, I changed setting to broil for 10 minutes and glaze was beautifully caramelized.  This was served with Chef Johns basic roasted vegetable recipe: however I used butternut squash carrots and potatoes.
I will make this again and again.  Thank you Chef John!!!

DELICIOUS! I followed directions (almost exactly).
I marinated all day but didn’t have time to cook. To prevent from over marinating I removed the meat from the marinade and sealed it in a gallon zip bag and refrigerated until the second day. I let it come to room temperature before cooking as directed.  Leftovers warmed well. Also, thin slices made great sandwiches on toasted bread— drizzled with the  delicious maple syrup & Dijon mustard. I’ll be making this sauce for other meat dishes too. 
Yes, I’ll be making this again. Thanks Chef John!

Made it basically to the recipe, except I used about double the amount of pork loin but there was enough brine to cover it all. I also used butter to fry up the loin once it was brined. The flavour was very good! It was still somewhat pink in the middle but definitely cooked through, not brown like in some of the pictures. Will definitely make this again.

I made recipe as written with the only exception being that I only used 1/2 the amount of salt in the brine (my husband has problems with high blood pressure) .  I did brine the pork loin for 10 hours and the end product was extremely salty.  It was very moist and juicy!  I love ginger but was not a fan of it in this recipe.  I did like the maple flavor .  I may try this again next time with a small amount of salt in the brine and no ginger.

I usually love all of Chef John's recipes, but this one just didn't do it for me. It definitely wasn't bad, but not spectacular.

This was an easy, very tasty recipe. My husband and I are not big meat eaters but when we have brothers and sisters for dinner we need to find something to cook that does not break the bank.....our families are both meat eaters. This recipe will be made many times now that I have tried it. I made the marinade the day before I needed it just to give time for the salt to incorporate.....and it did. I put the pork into the marinate at 6:00 a.m. on the day I was going to cook it. I had bought a Pork Loin (shoulder) that weighed in at 3.25 lbs. so I had to make 1 1/2 times the amount of marinade and I did find a plastic container that just fit my roast. Browning the roast was difficult only because of the size of the roast.....but fortunately I did have a very large frying pan (ScanPan2000) that could also go into the oven.  I used a digital thermometer and an instant read thermometer......and I did not trust either so I went with my own experience. The roast came out of the oven after 1 hour and 20 minutes and then sat tented to 30 minutes while we got everything else warmed. The pan drippings were served as au jus and this was excellent.....the whole meal was a success, the roast was moist with that lovely moist sheen and we served with a sweet potato casserole, broccoli cauliflower casserole and a beautiful lettuce and sprout salad with a tasty honey-lime dressing!!  This recipe is DEFINITELY a keeper. Glad I stumbled across this one!! Thank you...

This will forever be my go to recipe for cooking pork loin. The kids loved it. Only thing I will need to remember is to do a quick rinse to the pork loin after it's been in marinade for 8-10 hours, it was a bit too salty.  otherwise, it had great flavor and very moist.

Followed the recipe, except for the red chili pepper flakes.  Roast came out moist and juicy.  Family enjoyed the delicious flavors of Dijon with a hint of maple, savory and sweet.

This was so good! My husband loved it! We were both skeptical about the maple/mustard sauce but it was perfect. We only cooked half of the pork loin and the next week we tried a different recipe. Nope! THIS is the one for us! I can't wait to have it again.

THIS IS THE BEST PORK LOIN EVER. I Prepared brine last night and made fordinner this evening and it was excellent! I served with glazed baby carrots, also uses maple syrup, and hassleback potatoes courtesy of Ree and a dinner roll. Perfect meal. Hubby loved it. Very moist and tender, cut with a fork, with great flavor. Note: Only put pepper on before searing as we don’t use a lot of salt and the brine salted it perfectly. Will definitely be making this again. As other suggested, I brined mine for 24 hours and used a meat tenderizer. Also cooked in cast iron skillet. Def a keeper??

This roast was delicious!  I used a pork tenderloin, only because that's what I had in the freezer.  So moist and tender.  Will definitely make again soon.  Thanks for teaching me to brine:)

My first adventure in brining and I chose this recipe after reading dozens of your reviews. (It really helps build confidence as well as offer suggestions by reading reviews first). 
My pork loin was just as the recipe promised: juicy, tender and flavorful. I served it to guests which made it even more important that it turned out well.  Intending to purchase pork TENDERLOIN, when I got home and realized it was just a pork loin, I freaked! I always associated that cut of meat with being dry and tough. Not with this recipe! I followed it exactly except instead of searing it on top of the stove, my husband seared it briefly on the BBQ grill which not only browned it nicely, it imparted a bit of a smoky flavor.  
By the way, I had a larger cut of meat: 4.22 pounds. I doubled the brine recipe but only increased the salt by 50%. I brined the loin for 20 hours & it was perfect. 
I am already looking forward to my next brining project and will keep this recipe close at hand because it was such a success. I would give it 10 stars if I had the option!

After browning the roast, I added some white wine to the cast iron Dutch oven to deglaze the pan.  I returned the roast to the pan with a mix of cubed butternut squash and whole crimini mushrooms. Delicious!

I made this pork loin roast for New Years Day dinner. The first time I ever brined meat. It turned out very well, it was tender and juicy, there were no complaints.  If I made it again I would perhaps make a sauce out of the marinade as some reviewers have suggested.

Loved the flavor!  I took an additional step.  I combined the maple syrup, dijon mustard, and cayenne pepper to taste and heated in the microwave.  Then drizzled over the slices of pork when served.  Yummy!

Wow.  This is the best brine recipe I and my wife have ever made.  Thank you!  Made a modification or two just for us.  Added an onion, some mushrooms, and a little water to the mix while in the oven.  This gave us the ingredients for a gravy or a great onion soup.  YUM!

Like others, I reduced the salt by half.  I also marinated in the brine for 24 hours.  Very tender and moist.  Cooking time was longer since I had a larger roast.  Just use a meat thermometer and it will be perfect!

Absolutely stunning! My mother, who hates meat, had seconds. A brilliant combination  of flavors with the dijon and maple syrup. I accidentally put the glaze on before I put it in the skillet, but I think the chance for the glaze to caramelize a little just enhanced the meal.

The pork tenderloin turned out beautiful and tasty! I followed the recipe precisely and let mine brine for about 9 hours. Spices wee just rights. It was an easy dish to prepare. I wouldn't change anything. Actually, I'll use Kosher salt next time. The recipe doesn't specify Kosher salt, but the video. I used regular, as it's what I had in hand and the recipe didn't specify. Loved it and so did my family, including a picky teenager and a picky 4 year old.

This dish was easy and delicious, particularly if you enjoy salty foods.  I used a 2.5 lb pork tenderloin and brined it for approximately 28 hours.  I cooked it for 40 minutes at 325, added the do-not-skip sauce, and it was done (155 for my family) after about 1 hour.  Spoon the sauce from the bottom of the pan over the pork once cooked.  Highly recommended.  My spouse loved it, although he thought it a tad salty.

This is the recipe that converted me to brining.

The flavor and moisture that this brine imparts to the pork tenderloin is amazing. You don't even need a knife to eat this. All of my kids beg me to make this regularly.

My kids hate mustard, so I unfortunately have yet to taste the maple-dijon glaze; instead I make a white wine reduction pan sauce with the drippings, chopped shallots, white wine, and chilled butter and drizzle that over the finished pork. 

The key is to brine long enough, but not too long (or the pork will become too salty). 4-5 hours is enough to my taste. If I am going to brine 8-10 hours, I cut the salt back a little. Also, be sure to remove the silverskin from the tenderloin before brining.

Two more tips: Use a meat thermometer (an oven-safe probe thermometer is best) and take the pork out when it reaches at 145F.  Last, if you have a blender, you can skip cracking the peppercorns and crushing the garlic and chopping the ginger - just toss all of the brine ingredients in the blender and let it rip.

Not bad despite hours of brining. I expected it to be jucier than it was,however,it may have been the roast I used which was very lean. It had a lot more flavour the next day. Maybe next time I'll use a roast with a little more fat.

My family loved it! I used ground garlic and ginger (half tbsp for each of what is in the recipe) because that's what I had in my kitchen. Didn't used the skillet in the oven because I don't have any oven proof :( instead used glass casserole dish. It was great though. In the skillet where I sealed the meat, cut some potatoes and carrots and cooked them there, made them tasty.

This is a terrific recipe!  The brine made a huge difference to the usually dry pork loin.  It was tender and juicy and I followed the recipe to a "T". No leftovers and my picky nephew had seconds.

I had a seven pound pork loin (cut into two pieces), so I doubled the recipe and that was more than enough to marinate the pork in.  I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and halved the salt. The meat marinated for about 24 hours.  I have both roasted and barbecued the loin -- they turned out great either way!  On the bbq, I cooked the meat at a high temperature to brown it, then lowered the temp to 350.  Even with the larger piece of pork, the meat reached an internal temperature of 140 in approximately 50 minutes.  Very tasty -- everyone loved it!

Really enjoyed this recipe. I have done it exactly as Chef John suggested in the oven and I have grilled it. Both were fantastic, but in my opinion, (which I highly regard and respect :-) ) it is best on the grill!!! Yum!

Nice flavor, but changed the recipe for time constraints.  Seasoned pork steaks, and seared.  Made the glaze from all other ingredients, except salt...baked at 350 for 15 mins.  Very good!  With more time I would like to try as is.

It was absolutely delicious. I don't  understand the notice about  not brining the meat more than 10 hours. ¿What's the reason? I left mine for 13 hours  and got the flavour all inside the loin.

2nd time making this, and the only change both times is using ground ginger instead of fresh 'cause that's what is in my pantry. I brine for 10 hours. The flavor and juices are amazing! Oh, I also use regular maple syrup, must try with real maple next time.

Exceptional!  Moist and delicious - clean plates all around.  I used a 4 pound end roast and increased the brine recipe by about half.  The only substitution I made was chives for the garlic.  Seared for about 8 minutes, roasted for about 45-50 minutes before adding glaze.  Definitely a meal for a special occasion!

I tried this recipe with Pork Chops and grilled them caramelizing with the Dijon Mustard Sauce at the end.  The result was excellent(WOW!) I have never made pork that was as moist or flavorful. I've shied away from Pork Loin because I haven't been able to get the meat moist but I'm looking forward to trying this recipe with the Loin as well.  Definitely making this recipe a staple.  Thank you Chef John!  I love your work!

Make sure to use Kosher crystal salt. It's far less dense than anything else out there and yields a perfect lightly salted flavour even after 9 hours of brining. Such a good recipe!

I made this for Easter Sunday with friends and we all agreed it was the best pork loin we have ever eaten.  I will use this again and again.

Yummy, tender, juicy and fabulous!! I had a huge 8 lb loin that i cut in half so i doubled up on almost everything except the salt for the brine (trying to watch my high blood pressure) and it still came out juicy!! Give it a try, you wont be disappointed!! Another winner from chef john!!

The meat eaters in our family loved it, and even the two other picky eaters ate some of it. That's a winner in my book! I followed the recipe exactly, except was out of garlic so used garlic powder. Thanks for a great recipe!

Moistest pork roast I've ever had! That being said, it's also the first time I've brined something. I will never cook another pork roast without brining with this or a different brine recipe :)

This was delicious prepared as written. I let my 2 1/2 LBS. Pork Loin brine for 9 1/2 hours. Cooked it for 40 minutes, added the maple syrup spread- cook for another 15 minutes... It registered about 150- 152. I let the roast rest in the hot pan covered with aluminum foil for 15 minutes. Perfect!

I added to the brine with another recipe, added some crushed dried birds eye peppers, dried onion flakes and tripled the amount of garlic; seared the pork on the stove top longer. Cooked the pork with the garlic I marinated with, it turned out perfect! This is the best pork loin recipe I have ever used, the pork sweats were well worth it! I also used less salt (half the amount) in the brining recipe, your not pickling, your brining.

I loved this, and unfortunately I have no leftovers because my son did, too. I had an 18-oz loin, so cut back the brine volume a bit. I soaked dry posole overnight, then put that into the crockpot with some water and chicken broth. I placed three potatoes in the crockpot and stuck the loin on top of them so it wouldn't be swimming in the posole's liquid. Cooked on low all day. At the end of the day the pork was moist, easy to shred, and the posole was great too. I was in a hurry and forgot the last step, still great.

This had two things I like in the recipes I try... Incredibly easy and amazingly tasty. Pork is not my wife's favorite and she asked, "when can you make this again". I followed the directions pretty closely except for using Deli mustard instead of Dijon. My mistake, not reading the ingredient list accurately, but it was very good anyways. Thank you Chef John!

This is a really good brine recipe for pork. I had 2 huge bone in chops that were over 2 inches thick and didn't want to dry them out so wanted to brine them. The pork was melt in your mouth tender. I followed the recipe exactly and the reason I am giving it 4 stars is because of the glaze. The next time I make this recipe I will cut the mustard in half or just leave out the glaze altogether as we weren't crazy about it. I have made several of Chef John's recipes and have loved most of them. I follow his recipe the first go round and tweak it to our tastes if needed after that. Thanks again Chef for another great recipe!??????

Made this this week,  it was very moist and had great flavor!  I did add more grated ginger.  Served it with a warm roasted beet salad and wild rice.  Husband is not a big fan of pork since it is always dry, but he loved it.

I didn't have ginger, or Dijon mustard (used yellow instead). I was only able to marinate this for half an hour while the pork came to room temp out of the refrigerator.  Despite these differences, this pork came out EXCELLENT.  Very tender, very moist.  I should have cooked it a bit less, as it was a little on the "well" side cooking it exactly as directed, but the family devoured it and can't wait for me to make it again.  Great recipe, great flavors!

This recipe is terrific...easy to prepare, cook, and the flavour is great....such an interesting blend. But most importantly, the meat is sooo moist when  'brined' for 8 hours. 
Definitely a repeat!

Thanks chef John for another winner. I'm just learning how to cook and this was easy and truly delicious. Just don't overcook or it will be tough and dry. Last time i made this in a Dutch oven and I think it cooked faster that way and turned out a little over done. Still the flavor is top notch!

Very tasty and I love the brining, keeps it moist. Didn't have any maple syrup on hand so I used molasses in slightly lesser amounts. It worked well! Will make it again.

I used pork loin pieces, not a roast and basted both sides.  Marinated for a few minutes only. Cooked at 375 degrees for 6 minutes each side. It was lovely with sauteed mushrooms and asparagus as sides! Will definitely make as a regular option in our menu.

WOW!! made this yesterday since I was snowed in and poor hubby had to go out and deliver the mail. Knew he was going to have a miserable day so I wanted to have something special for dinner. Didn't have rosemary and used 2 pork tenderloins weighing in at 2 1/2 lbs. Took only about 30 minutes total to cook and was crazy moist and delicious. We fought over who was going to get the little bit of leftovers for lunch today. Thanks, will definately make again!!

We loved this recipe. I happened to have cider on hand and added a cup to the brine. Wonderful. Will definitely use again. Moist and full of flavor.

This recipe is no joke, I made it a week ago and am making it again tonight. My girl and I ate most of the roast ourselves but had a heel end leftover. I gave it to my neighbors..they smelled it and sliced it up cold..lol I didn't use an oven though, I smoked it using cherry wood. Its a have to try recipe.

RAVE reviews for Easter Sunday Dinner. Served with mashed potatoes, Knorr's brown gravy and steamed broccoli. DEEEE-LISH! And so easy to have prepped for the most part the night before. DEFINITELY will make it again and again.

We loved this recipe at my house. The meat was juicy and very flavorful. Pork loin is very inexpensive here in Indiana so I buy it often, but it is always dry and bland. This simple and inexpensive brine turns it into something special!
