I make this constantly and here is a trick that I use. Immediately after cooking according to it's posted recipe, I transfer this entire soup to a Crock Pot and continue to slow cook it until it thickens to a "stew consistency". I then serve it over white rice and sprinkle it with white Cojita Mexican cheese. It is delicious and I often eat several plates of it.

Made this soup again this evening.  Allrecipies made horrible edits to my recipie and I get bad reviews.  6, 7, and 8 are all one step.  It's simply setting the oven to broil, place sausage on brolier pan, and broil until brown, about 10 minutes.  After I cut the sausage in quarters/slices I pat them down in paper towels to remove the grease.

I made this and took it to school for lunch the next day. My friends all told me it was amazing and didn't believe I made it from scratch or at all. If you follow this recipe it will lead you to success. Not to toot my own horn, but... toot toot. :)

I thought  this was a great soup. I was low on potatos, so  used one  large sweet potato and 3 reg. potatos. Would do this again. Also used turkey sausage, chicken broth (because that is what I had)  and extra carrot. YUM! A good addition to my kitchen. Oh and I also pressure cooked the beans ahead of time to avoid problems of undercooked beans.

Quite tasty. I had left over pinto beans from a different recipe so it made the prep much faster and easier as I only had to cook the other veggies. My husband and I don't care for smoked meats so used a turkey sausage to keep the fat down and it was very nice still. Will make again.

Poor time directions. Directions followed directly and the beans were far from done after 2 hours of simmering. Transferred the entire pot to the crockpot as other reviews suggested and after 8 hours on low, they were done. The flavor was really good. The receipe as written is a huge amount. It's just my self and my husband and we were able to have it for dinner and a few lunches with enough to freeze for later.

Excellent. The spices. as well as the consistency, were right on point.  I 've made it 3 times this week for different groups  and most joyfully shared your recipe each time. Thanks for a job well done.

Delicious! I made it pretty close to the recipe.  Except:  no celery so I used celeriac chopped fine and fried with the onion, tomato sauce, and added corn.  The sausage was chopped small and fried. I dumped it all in the crockpot and cooked it about 5 hours. 
I topped it with shredded cheese and served with garlic bread. I will definitely make it again.

I loved the flavour of this soup and will definitely make it again. I precooked the beans using my instant pot  and added them near the end and just fried up my sausage in a pan and added it, but  otherwise I kept to the recipe. The broth, tomato juice and a sugar really added something special.  Thanks for sharing.

I used black beans instead and it turned out great. I put everything together and let it cook for 2 hours and it turned out just as good. Black beans are my favorite and hey have more flavor

First off, this is a recipe which requires a day (or at least several hours) at home, because it must be "babysat" at several stages during the preparation. Nothing is difficult, but I followed the recipe exactly, and even though I am not a newcomer to cooking and know how to multi-task, this recipe took me three hours, start to finish. One other thing to note is I had to add more water (or beef broth) when I added in the potatoes and carrots; the liquid had already cooked down too much. So, rather than the stated 2 cans of beef broth, I would have four cups of beef broth on hand, and add liquid as needed. It is a good soup when finished - I did as one reviewer suggested and placed into the crockpot on low when everything was ready to serve. Just not worth the time of preparation, in my opinion.
