I've made this a few times now. I cut down to 3 eggs and cook a little longer than 6 hours in the slow cooker, it doesn't have the texture of cake -but it's not supposed to. More like pudding/cake. We love it under vanilla ice cream or the next day for breakfast. Hey - how much worse is it than a doughnut??

This cake has a bit of a wierd texture, but is awesomely sweet and sooooo moist.  I have given out the recipe several times.  It has been a huge hit at my house!  I serve it as the base of a sundae with ice cream and a little chocolate syrup on top.  Love it!  Thanks for sharing!

I'm afraid that there is too much fluid in this recipie, as mine came out a very stange texture...not cake like at all. The flavor was very good, but the cake was heavy, wet and spongy.

This cake was a bit too moist and was a odd texture.  Good taste if you don't like sweet cake, however I would only use 1/2 the sour cream and 1 less egg if I made it again.

This was very easy and delicious. I made it in my crock pot, but keep a watchful eye over it as the time stated in the recipe would have resulted in burning. It was done in 4 hours. We loved the crock pot version because I set it to warm after the cooking was done and we had a warm chocolate cake for hours. Not a recipe for dieters. Lots of sour cream and eggs in this one. this a keeper and I see myself making this one a lot...I may even try to come up with a vanilla or red velvet version!


ADDENDUM.....I tried a vanilla version...yellow cake mix, vanilla pudding mix, same amount of eggs, sour cream, oil, and water. Still used the choc chips. DELISH!!!!!!!!

I managed to burn mine to an unwholesome crisp.  I thought that it was supposed to be dry like an oven baked cake, so I let it linger in the crock pot for an hour extra.  Not a good idea.  Charred chocolate really smells bad.

The flavor of this cake was good, but mine was too moist.  Next time I will cut the sour cream in half or reduce the oil.

I love this recipe! It's great because you can make it early in the day and it's ready later for company. Once it appeared fairly set, just a little jiggle to it, I turned the crock pot to warm until I was ready to serve. Needs to be served with ice cream, IMHO.

I thought this was a good and easy recipe to have on hand when you need something in a pinch to take to a potluck. I baked it in a crockpot using the exact ingredients listed and baked it on low for 5.5 hours and it was perfect. I served it with ice-cream~~delicious.

I give this cake 5 stars for ease, but 3 1/2 stars for flavor, but I'm not a box mix fan. The sour cream and chocolate chips definitely help. When you need a quick no-fuss dessert that everyone likes, this is it. I always make it in the crock pot. It is supposed to have a moist pudding-y texture. Serve warm with ice cream, it's delicious.

I have made this twice now and each time I make it this cake it caves in as soon as I take it out.  Too much fluid I think.

Slow Cooker version: This is so good. It's very rich so you need a good vanilla ice-cream to go with it. It IS NOT a regular cake texture. It's not supposed to be. If you want a regular cake texture then make a cake the "regular way." I've heard of this kind of cake called a lava cake because it's kind of goopy--but not totally. I think next time I may try milk chocolate chips to see if it will be a little less rich--for the kids' sake.  Love it!

I make this cake all the time - it's my "funeral cake". I use 1 cup sour sream - 1/2 cup oil.  Then if you want to change things up a bit - use Chocolate mint chips - peanut butter chips - heath bar chips. I also make a chocolate frosting and add peppermint ext. or melt some peanut butter and mix into the chocolate frosting..... This cake is all sorts of fun.

I am in the process of making this cake, it should have been done 20 minutes ago, but the cake is still "jiggling", for lack of a better word. If I had known it was going to take this long, I would have gone for something less time consuming.

I only used 1/2 cup sour cream and added 1/2 cup 2% milk (I didn't realize I had so little sour cream).  I kept everything else the same and cooked it in my oval slow cooker (Hamilton Beach) for 3 1/2 hours.  I was looking to make a lava type cake and everyone said this was better than any restaurant's!

This does NOT work in oval shaped crockpots.  I was so dissappointed!  Burnt on the outside and runny in the middle.  I am sure it makes a great cake if cooked the traditional way.

This was a tricky recipe to get right, but was definitely worth it once I did! I made mine in the crock pot. The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly. The outside burned to a crisp, but the inside cooked perfectly. I tried it again two days ago, but this time I stirred the batter every 30 min or so to help it cook evenly. Because of the texture, this did not mess up the cake. I still followed the ingredients and heating instructions. It was so delicious! I will definitely make it again!

I split this cake batter into two round pans instead, and after baking, layered them with cherry pie filling and whipped cream on top.  Turned out awesome.

I made this in a crockpot and after about 3 hours it was starting to burn on the bottom. The recipe calls for 6 hours, so be careful about the timing of your crockpot.  The cake was delicious and everyone enjoyed it, but in the future I will watch the time.

Several of our cooking forum members made this and it was quite interesting to see how varied they all turned out in the slow cooker. We all cooked it on low but not one our cakes were done at the same time. One members cake took six hours, another five, one was three and a half and was burned and I let mine cook for four hours and fifteen minutes and it was totally overdone. Wasn't too crazy about the texture either, but I'm sure had it been baked in the oven the results would have been much better. Will give this another try but in the oven this time. Thank you!

OUTSTANDING in the crock pot, be sure to have some ice cream with it to tone it down as it is VERY rich.

I didn't like the taste at all. It wasn't sweet enough and I could taste too much of the sour cream in it. The batter tasted better than the cake.

I am totally amazed at the number of reviews that mention this cake being too moist.  It is a pudding cake!  It is not a regular dry cake.  I grew up on these chocolate pudding cakes mom made from scratch.  Yummy!!  Enjoy all that moist flavor, best of all with ice cream!

So good and way too easy. I cooked for 5 1/2 hours in the slow cooker on low. I think I over cooked it. It did not have any "pudding" to it. But it was wonderfully moist and dense. I used Duncan Hines Dark Chocolate Fudge cake mix. Per the advice of another post, I only used 1 cup of sour cream. I used fat free sour cream and sugar free/fat free instant pudding. I don't recommend mini chips. They were too small and just kind of disappeared. I would have preferred little chunks of chococlate to bite into. I forgot to buy ice cream and I will never live it down. Everyone kept saying it needed ice cream. All I had was whipped topping. Bummer.

I used a chocolate fudge cake mix instead of a milk chocolate one and this turned out perfect!  Tasted like Applebee's molten cake without the runny center.  Served it warm with ice cream. Will definately make again.

I made a few adjustments to this recipe and it turned out amazing!  Use a white cake mix, vanilla pudding mix, and white chocolate chips in place of the chocolate ingredients. Top with a can of coconut icing. Delicious!

I followed the recipe to a T for the crock pot and mine was done in less than 3 hours on low! It was almost over done! I definitely say to watch it as it cooks, since the edges of mine are crunchy. Overall it tastes great though!

this is really good!  i cooked mine in the crock pot, i have a large, oval Rival.  It took less than the suggested 6 hours- more like 4.5 hours then it began to smell like it was beginning to scorch,  so watch yours the first time you make this cause i'm sure every pot is different.  i didn't use the chocolate chips and i made it with low fat sour cream,  and i had to use 2 smaller pudding packages (1.7 oz each) because the suggested size was not available to me.   not sure if that made any real difference,  but we enjoyed how gooey and fluffy this cake turned out,  spoonable but not too sweet (it is not like eating brownie batter).  i will make this again!   Thank You :)

This cake would receive 5 stars if it weren't for the stirring. I only used 1 cup sour cream and 1/2 oil, but I did stir the cake every half hour for about 3 hours total baking time in the oval Crock Pot, and it was done then. It is absolutely delicious and everyone loved it. Definitely serve with vanilla ice cream!

SO GOOD! I changed it a little because of all the reviews. I used 1 package chocolate cake mix. 1 package pudding and 4 eggs just like the orginal recipe said to. BUT I only used 1 cup light sour cream, 1/2 cup water 1/2 cup oil and the whole 12oz bag of chocolate chips :) I also cooked it 3 hours in my oval crock pot and then left it on warm for 2 hours. It was perfect.

I followed the recipe to a T, using a bundt pan. This came out EXACTLY how a pudding cake should, ooey gooey in the middle, moist all over. I'm not sure why people were complaining about the texture, this is a PUDDING cake.   Fabulous! Thanks for sharing.

I've made this cake for over 30 years, though I've never done it in the slow cooker.  We call it the Chocolate OverDose (C.O.D.) cake.  My favorite variation is to brew 2 bags of Bengal Spice tea (Celestial Seasons brand) into the water.  Gives it a wonderful spicy/cinnamon flavor.  I'm also going to try Raspberry Zinger and Mandarin Orange Spice flavors.  I've tried mint chips, but it makes it too sweet for me.

Wonderful, moist, and oh so easy. I don't think I would attempt to make it without the crockpot though. I spooned it out as it was VERY moist. Topped warm with ice cream. A true winner !!!!!

I followed this recipe exact and made it in the oven. It was very easy to make and delicious served warm with vanilla ice cream. The whole family agreed that it was a great dessert. I do agree that it doesn't have the texture and sweetness of traditional cake, but it was very good.

I do not have chocolate pudding, but added rum. It was moist, but not heavy enough.

I agree with other viewers on the texture of the cake.  At the time I was making it I thought that 3/4 cup of oil was too much.  I will try this recipe again cutting down the oil significantly.   I might try a 1/4 or a 1/3 or whatever the box says for making the cake.  I hope this helps.

I made this cake the night  before Easter, it all but overflowed the bunt pan, not only did that happen but when I took it out of the oven it sunk like a ship. I decided to try it again after church on Easter and this time I put some in the bunt pan and some in a loaf pan it came out fine but when I took it out of the oven again it sunk like a ship. I am done with this cake.

I made the mistake of trying to alter the ingredients per other reviewer's remarks. It came out too dry. Next time I will follow the recipe as it's written instead.
