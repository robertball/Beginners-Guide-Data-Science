Came out great! Added more tuna and used celery due to not having scallions.

I put 1 tspn of oyster sauce,  1 tspn of bottled kimchee base to give it a little kick. I omitted the mustard.

I followed the recipe as is. I thought it was very good but next time I’ll cut down on the Dijon. It’s good but definitely pronounced and for me, more subtle would be better. It’ll be good with Siracha mayo as a dip. I had some Asian dipping sauce left so used that instead.
