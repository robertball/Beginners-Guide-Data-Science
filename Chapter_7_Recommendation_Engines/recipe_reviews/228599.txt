I thought this was delicious. I did make a few changes, but nothing drastic. I added tons of garlic powder and onion powder because I do to almost all my dishes. Plus I added like 1/8 a cup of Worcestershire sauce. I wanted a healthier option so I omitted the sour cream and instead added a little milk. I cooked it down to thicken it. Yummy!!

We did ours with meatballs, which our kids love. It was quick and easy on a sports-practice school night!

This recipe didn't go well for my family.  To us, it was bland and needed extra garlic and  worcesterhire sauce to help it out.  I also added in some sauteed mushrooms and a seasoning packet of HVR salad dressing mix to liven it up.

My family and I really enjoyed this dish!  I made a few additions - used butter instead of oil, added a little flour to thicken the sauce, added a little mustard and green onions.  My kids loved it so much that they asked to have it for lunch tomorrow at school!  As there were no leftovers, I guess I'll be making another batch!

Not that bad but the AllRecipes recipe in the slow cooker has even more flavor. Great choice in cut of beef for this recipe. I think I will use this type of meat next time with a different recipe.

For economic reasons I used boneless chuck steak sliced thin and browned. Added onions, garlic and I added sliced portabello mushrooms and cooked for aa few minutes. I added water,covered, and simmered until almost tender (1hr)and most of liquid was evaporated. Then I added the portabello mushroom sauce and simmered for another 20 min until thickened. Added the sour cream and served over egg noodles.We all loved the flavor of this entree.

I have to agree with the other reviewers that this was pretty bland.  I was expecting big flavor from this can as a boost, but nope.  However, it is low in sodium so that's a good point.  I had to add 3 more cloves of garlic, 1 additional t of worcestershire sauce, doubled the sour cream and an 8oz container of fresh mushrooms, then it was pretty good.

We really liked this recipe & will use it again. I did tweak it though. After all, it is just a starter, not a finisher. LOL! 
I first off used only 3/4# of venison loins. While cooking them, I added about 1/4 tsp. California style garlic salt with parsley. 
I had button mushrooms in the fridge to use up, so I added about 6 of those, sliced, while sauteing the onions. Waited until right towards the end to add the garlic clove, so as not to burn & get bitter.
When this was done, I tasted it & it still needed a little more of the California style garlic salt with parsley, so I added about 1/4 tsp. more. I also added about 1/2 tsp. coarse ground black pepper. 
I cooked my noodles in water with chicken bouillon  in it for added flavor & then drained them & tossed them with about 2 Tbsp. butter. My husband doesn't like noodles, but he loved this!

A basic & bland beef stroganoff that was actually a big hit with the kids at my daughter's sleepover. I felt that while the sauce had a good mushroom flavor, the lack of mushroom chunks was noticeable. Have to do something with the beef too since it came out a little bit tough. A keeper in a pinch.

This turned out good, but I made alterations, so I don't know if my rating is fair. I sauteed fresh sliced mushrooms with the onions. I seasoned the steak with Montreal steak seasoning and cooked it with worcestershire. I also added extra worcestershire sauce to the sauce mixture as well. I mixed it all together with noodles that I cooked.

Was pretty good, I did however use worcestershire, garlic, portabello mushrooms and onion, and I used cream of mushroom soup, instead of the starter sauce.. Have made it a few times this way, My family loves it.

Definitely needs a bit more seasoning to be good. I used butter instead of oil to cook the beef and then to cook the onion and garlic. I added some sliced baby bella mushrooms with the onions as well. I doubled the Worcestershire sauce and sprinkled some onion and garlic powder (about 1/2 teaspoon each) for more flavor.

Great recipe but I added a dessert spoon of hot english mustard (already made up) to the low fat sour cream at the end which gave it the zing it needed. Delicious!

Good recipe. I added a bit more Worcestershire sauce, a can of mushrooms, and some parsley flakes. I didn't think it was as bland as the other reviewers. It had just enough flavor. To each their own.

Love this dish! Very simple and delicious. The only changes I made was a substitution of vegan cream cheese for regular cream cheese and I used Quorn meatless beef. Will definitely make again!

Instead of using sirloin steak, I made meatballs with ground beef. I browned the meatballs in a little oil, then simmered them in the sauce while I cooked the noodles. I used 7 ounces of noodles, which was perfect for the amount of sauce. My family loved it.

Yuck. I followed the directions, and it looked just like the picture. But it was barely edible. First of all, that mushroom soup stuff tastes only like canned mushrooms, which I find barely palatable to begin with, and it's way soupier than the Campbell's cream of mushroom soup. Second, the recipe doesn't have you season or marinate the meat at all, so it was gross. And I had the butcher at the store cut up a 1-pound sirloin steak (which is PLENTY, by the way - not sure why it says 2 pounds) so I didn't have to, and she cut it with the veins of fat in it, so that made the meat inedible anyway. Normally when a recipe doesn't work out, I mess with it and try again, but no amount of doctoring will make this recipe edible to my family. And I'm never buying those Recipe Starter soups again. Yuck.

This was super easy, fast to prepare and a crowd pleaser.  I added a bit more garlic and used Campbell's Golden Mushroom soup(local store doesen't carry Progresso recipie starters) and added a can of portabella mushrooms.

I used round steak and put everything in the slow cooker for 8 hours.  I substituted a large can of low sodium mushroom soup for the mushroom cooking sauce and added a 1/4 cup of flour to thicken it. I found the sauce to be the perfect base for personal taste adjustments, so I added a tsp of black pepper and a tsp of Old Bay seasoning blend.  The sauce looked a bit "pale" so I added 1/2 tsp of Kitchen Bouquet browning sauce to give it a bit more colour.  I served it with egg noodles and it was a hit!  Will definitely be making this again.

Looking forward to trying this recipe, but we don't have Progresso products here, I wonder if a cream of mushroom soup would work as well?

As written, this recipe was a 2 1/2- it took a lot of doctoring.  I cut salt to 1/4 tsp and subbed  garlic salt, upped garlic to 4 cloves, added 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes, upped black pepper to 1/2 tsp, added 1 tsp parsley, doubled worcestershire, added 1 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1 1/2 tsp onion powder, 1 1/2 tsp mustard, and 1 crushed cube of beef bouillon.  After changes this is a 5 star recipe- I made it for dinner last night and my husband has already polished off all of the leftovers!
