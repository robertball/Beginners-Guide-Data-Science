I recently made this for a family gathering for breakfast. I've made this twice; here are my recommendations: definitely soak the french bread slices individually in the egg mixture (someone else commented on this) to ensure no dry pieces or overly soggy pieces. 2) depending on the french bread you buy, you may need an additional pan (double the recipe) 3) used aluminum foil for the first 30 minutes and then cooked for an additional ten minutes (watch oven) to brown up the toast. You may want to add a dash of cinnamon to it as well.

People went WILD for this recipe!   I used an entire loaf of Pepperidge Farm Cinnamon Swirl bread (no raisins), and substituted buttermilk for the cream.  I put it all in a Bundt pan for a pretty presentation.  I wasn't at the meal where it was served, so when I asked how it turned out the response was "even a skinny person went for seconds!"

I used sugar free syrup to cut the sugar and I cut the brown sugar by half. My husband gave it five stars!

I won Mother's Day breakfast with this thing and my wife declared it our new Christmas morning breakfast tradition, supplanting our long standing tradition of making German Pancakes. I cannot begin to praise this recipe enough. Absolutely delicious!

No need to soak overnight!  Absolutely delicious!  Used a leftover baguette & yum. Only soaked it about 20 minutes & poured the batter in with the bread & baked. Paired nicely with slices of cantaloupe.

This was excellent!  I took this to a family gathering and the raves never ended.  Older folks as well as the younger ones loved the dish.  I served syrup on the side, but it wasn't needed at all.  I made it ahead and then just reheated it for breakfast.  We all loved it.  A definite keeper!

I halved the recipe so each piece of bread could be on the bottom in my 9x12 pan.  Next time I'll cube the bread as the pieces of bread were soggy in the middle.

I adjusted the recipe slightly by using Challah bread which I cubed, and less brown sugar.  I added maple syrup instead of the brown sugar in the egg mixture.  It came out perfect for us.  I always recommend using Grade B maple syrup for baking for its deep and buttery flavor.

Henry Schumacher, you should slice the bread about as thick as Texas Toast.  If you are not familiar with that, then I'd say a little thicker than two slices of typical store bought bread.  

As for the recipe- it is an indulgent breakfast delicacy and it is worth every calorie.  Don't see the purpose of the sprinkle of powdered sugar unless it is to make it look more like traditional French toast, so I skipped that.

Family LOVED it! So easy to make. Like others, cooking time varies depending on the type of oven you have. It took 50 minutes for my oven to cook thoroughly. Recommend a deep dish as the sugar mixture at the bottom will ooze out and cause a mess in your oven.

I went strictly by the recipe, it had a nice flavor.  It did require substantially longer than 35 minutes to cook, 50 for me.  I will make it again

The only change I made was that I used Challah bread cubed, otherwise it was exactly  the same as the recipe.It was a huge hit for Christmas brunch. Definitely a keeper!

Made this almost exactly as the recipe states. Only thing I did different was I used 12 slices of french bread. My family loved it and have requested it again.  It’s super sweet, but my family has a sweet tooth, so be warned:)

I thought this recipe was great and I was missing some key ingredients. I only had 1/2 of the maple syrup and 2 % milk instead of 1/2-&1/2. I added 3 TBSP rum to the toast  and used challah bread instead of a baguette. I will add the right amount of maple syrup in next time and see if I like it better. Layered it up and baked for 40 minutes until brown. Delicious, foolproof recipe!

I must have done something wrong on this recipe.  The bottom was runny, and the brown sugar did not caramelize at all.  It was still grainy.  I think if I had left out the maple syrup it would have cartelized like in the photo.
