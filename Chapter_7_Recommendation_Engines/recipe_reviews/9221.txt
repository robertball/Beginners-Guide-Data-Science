My husband grew up eating Sweet Potato Casserole and when we got married he asked for it at Thanksgiving and I have never heard of it. So, I went looking and I found and tried several recipes and this recipe was the one that our family loved.

I found this casserole extremely sweet.  I doubled the recipe like it was suggested and hardly any was eaten at all.  I would cut the sugar in half and skip the sweetened condensed milk altogether if I was to make it again although I probably wouldn't make it again.

I made this last year for my first thanksgiving. This year everyone has demanded it again! I did not mash the potatoes however. I cubed them and left out the egg. I also added the topping right from the beginning and baked a little longer til the topping was well browned. Even all the kids loved it! Thankyou for a new Thanksgiving tradition!

This recipe is requested for me to serve at every family get together that my family has!  We all love it! It is so rich it is more like a dessert than a side dish! A friend of mine had this recipe but would never give it out! I am glad I found it on this website!

My husband isn't a big fan of sweet potatoes and will only eat it from Ruth Chris' restaurant. So when I saw this recipe I decided to try it because it seems very similar to the one at the restaurant.  My husband was extremely pleased.  It is very sweet but it comes out great. My grandmother suggested I boil the sweet potatoes first which cooked them and allowed the skin to peel off really easy.  Then I sliced them up into the mixer, no mashing required.

My mother ask me to make this for Thanksgiving dinner. I had never made it nor eaten it, so I got on here and found this recipe. It was a big hit! I never even tried it because I thought it would be terribly sweet, but now I am going to have to make it again just so I can eat some, because as I said it was a huge success.
