I really liked this.. the nutritional yeast gives it almost a cheesy flavor and covers an bitterness you might get from greens.  The only thing I would change is maybe a bit less broth.  I added more greens to try and make it a little thicker, but didn't have enough to make much of a difference

Yum! I put all sorts of veggies in this; potatoes, one carrot, some green peas, kale, spinach...mixed lentils, a little bit of black eyed peas. It's packed and it's super tasty. Greens+nutritional yeast combo makes it special.

I use half a bag of power greens from Costco. Otherwise I follow the recipe as written. His has become a staple in our home. The nutritional yeast adds the right amount of umami to this vegan soup.

This was excellent. I added carrots and celery and I didnâ€™t have collards so I only used kale and chard. I also did not good process it. Very much enjoyed by the whole family.

This recipe is excellent. I only used kale since I have so much in the garden. I like to have potatoes in kale soup, so added some. The flavor of this soup is really good.
