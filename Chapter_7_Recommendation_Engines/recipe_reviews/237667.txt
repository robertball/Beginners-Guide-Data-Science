We love this rub. We've used it many times and I've given jars of it as gifts.

Very flavorful.  For personal taste, I did omit the cinnamon.

I took the advice of another review and omitted cinnamon. The herb amounts were giant so I only used small amount. It needed more so I added it to a basic veloute. Now my family's favorite gravy. Just made it again tonight

These were really tasty.  I used fresh parsley in place of dried.

The herb rub was delicisous! I didn't have 1/4 cup dried marjoram but will add that next time. SO SO SO good and easy.

I made this rub exactly as stated.  While watching it cook I wondered if it would be too spicy; however, it was wonderfully flavorful.  My husband and I loved it the second time around as well.

I made a few substitutions, cut the ingredients, overall, it was really good. I think I'll try fresh herbs next time and add a pinch more salt. Just a pinch, definitely don't want too much more. Instead of rubbing, marinate in the fresh herbs, spices, and oil (olive or avocado). Then grill...I'm ready!

Great rub! Made this up yesterday afternoon, put the coated chops in a plastic bag for about 4 hours, then grilled them up--excellent flavor! Thanks for sharing!

We had a pork loin that we sliced into chops and seasoned with the rub, probably about 3/4t per chop, then let sit with the rub for about 30 minutes.  Pan fried in olive oil; took about 7 minutes per side for us.  GREAT flavor and juicy, tender pork.

I think this herb rub might be better with chicken. Pork requires a sweeter taste profile in my opinion. But I will certainly use the spice mix for other projects!
