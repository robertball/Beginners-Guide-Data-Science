This is great in a bind.  It's quick and less expensive than the canned variety.  I use it frequently and none of the recipes that I have used it in have suffered.

I ran out of sweetened condensed milk and needed something in a hurry, so I looked here.  After using this recipe I don't want to ever buy sweetened condensed milk again.  I'll just make it!  Just be careful because it gets really thick quick.

This is a fantastic recipe and so easy!  I didn't have any regular powdered milk, so I used the powdered vanilla coffee creamer I had in the cuboard and it turnes out delicious!  I used it for "Brown Family's Favorite Pumpkin Pie" from this site and the result was mouth watering to say the least!  Thank you so much!!

I tried this recipe tonight and I have to say it is awsome! I used a hand blender and it worked well, I think it made it nice and creamy. Thank you for sharing such a great recipe.

I have to say,this recipe save me when I ran out of the canned type and needed scm asap! I used a hand mixer and it turned out great! It had a nice texture and with this recipe,at least you know it does not contain any preservatives and doesn't have that canned taste,although it is a little similar,because it's been packaged in a can,it gives it a much artificial flavor.With this recipe,at least I know it's freshly made and no chemicals in it.

This is so easy and yummy!  I used this when I was out of canned variety and will use it again.  Have tried other recipes for this, but this one is so easy. Just put everything in the blender and it's finished in a flash.

this recipe worked well for the chocolate trifle.  I don't know how it would be in ice cream, though I'm going to try.  Before mixing it in the pudding it still tasted like powdered milk, but the dish didn't taste like powdered milk.  It's nice to have a recipe for this that I can use.

This recipe came out great. I was able to make it sugar free, because of my diabetes. I used it in a homemade coffee creamer.

Take the butter out and it's a fat free version.  I also cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup and it's still sweet.  Very good substitute and cheaper than the commercial stuff.  You get about 2 cups per recipe.

This was so easy and tastes so good! Amazing! I suggest you use a hand beater though, it was kinda hard for my regular blender. Would work fine in a high-speed, high-quality one though. Mine is cheap. :)
It gets really thick! Great recipe!

Will never buy the canned stuff again! I used dry whole milk, so I left out the butter. Also used half coconut sugar and half regular. I store it in a mason jar in the fridge. My favorite use is for making blended vanilla frappacinos ...blending with cold coffee, almond milk, vanilla whey protein powder, a splash of pure vanilla extract and several shakes of cinnamon. Thank you for sharing this recipe! :)

I used this to make sweetened condensed milk for a key lime pie.  I used goat's milk (because some members of my family have a difficult time digesting cow's milk).  It worked great and tasted just like the real thing.  I will definitely be making my sweetened condensed milk again.  Very easy.

I had to add a little extra water to get it to the right consistency, but other than that it was perfect. Tasted exactly like the canned variety.

I followed the recipe exactly and found mine wasn't thickening at all until cold.  It had a strong powdered milk scent before baking and unfortunately tasted powdered-milky after baked as well.  I used it for seven layer bars and would not do that again.  I won't make this again and am glad I didn't need these to serve these bars to anyone.  The canned SCM isn't as expensive as the wasted ingredients to make it and tossing your finished product out.

This turned out very well. I used it in a key lime pie, and it was perfect. I liked being able to control the sweetness, and ended up using a bit less sugar than the recipe called for.

This was a great recipe! I made it sugar free by substituting the sugar for 1/2c Truvia baking blend sugar and it turned out perfect. I will use this from now on instead of buying sweetened condensed milk.

This recipe is very convenient, but my milk powder didn't dissolve completely. The flavor of the candy I was making wasn't compromised, but the texture was off. Next time  I'm going to try warming it on the stove after it's mixed.

I will definitely be making this again. I made mine using Stevia making it sugar free and then used that to make my own coffee creamer. Worked great!!  Next time I might try subbing the butter for something lighter and see how that goes.

I made this with a hand mixer after the hot water, butter and milk made my blender explode the liquid all over my kitchen! But I like the recipe because I can sub stevia for the sugar for a diabetic recipe. I used about 1/2 cup of stevia so it also was not as sweet as the commercial condensed milk.

Mine turned out like thick  paste! I think the ratios  were off. 3  2/3 cups of dry ingredients, and only 3/4 cups of water. I ended up adding more hot water, an even then it was totally lumpy and sticky and I eventually ran it through a strainer!. Now to top it off, it tastes just like powdered milk, and it tastes  nasty in my tea. I think I will try  one of the ones made with coconut milk or half and half cream.

I had a similar recipe in my handbook when I cooked in tree planting camps, but I couldn't find my recipe tonight when I was looking for it. So I found a BUNCH, and this was the closest I could remember to the one I used to use. Glad I found it, because I really wanted to make some fudge sauce tonight for mug cakes! I added a tsp of vanilla, because I know my old recipe had that.

I made this recipe to use in a no-bake Key Lime Pie recipe.  I got to wondering how I could make it even MORE healthy and decided to try it with coconut oil instead of butter, and Truvia instead of sugar.  I did have to tweak the sweetness a little, but used liquid sucralose so I could count the drops.  This version was AWESOME!  The simplicity of this tasty recipe is astounding and I'll never buy a can of sweetened condensed milk again!  I'll be reviewing the no-bake pie filling next, and it was so good everyone ate it like pudding...it never made it to the crust.  No problem, it's simple enough to do again.
