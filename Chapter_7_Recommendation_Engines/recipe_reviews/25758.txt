Very tasty.  Can't go wrong with these basic ingredients and you can always adjust the seasonings to suit your taste.

A great soup that can be tweaked to your liking. The blanching of the bean sprouts is not necessary, just top the soup with the sprouts  for some crunchy goodness.  Add some Sriracha and you've got a winner.
