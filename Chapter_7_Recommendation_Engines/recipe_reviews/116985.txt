I brought this to a Little League picnic yesterday.  They were gone in less than 20 minutes.  The only change I made was adding about 2 tsp. dijon mustard and putting everything in a crockpot for 2 hrs. on high.  This is an easy recipe and absolutely delicious.

I guess if you like Sweet and Sour you will like this. I don't, so I don't. But, I took them to a party and got a lot of compliments and they were all eaten up. That made me increase from 2 to 3 stars. I made the sauce in a slowcooker, added the meatballs and left them on low overnight. That worked well.

Seriously yummy meatball recipe.  I made for a Halloween party (called them Mealy Meatballs in Blood Sauce), and everyone RAVED.  Will definitely make again for the Superbowl party.  The only change I made was to add some brown sugar and a bit more than a dash of garlic powder.  Thanks for sharing!!

I love the sauce used in this meatball recipe.  I think the sauce had the perfect mix of tang and a bit of a kick. I plan to make this for my BBQ ribs during the summer.

This is a keeper. Very delicious and easy to make. Made Christmas day for my family. I always do a buffet with lots of appetizer dishes. The next day my husband was asking for leftovers ~ sorry LOL! 

Made just as recipe states. Thank you for sharing.

These came out great! I made my own meatballs using beef and turkey. Made the sauce recipe as directed, heated it up, then tossed the meatballs and sauce in the crock-pot to keep warm while we munched on them. My Husband loved them.

I made these for a party, everyone loved them, many asked for the recipe! I used brown sugar rather than honey. Just mixed the sauce ingredients and poured over the meatballs in my crock pot, strirred, cooked on low for 4 hours , no need to cook it first  Easy and so good!

Wow - OK - I wish people would be more specific about flavors during their reviews - just saying "tastes great" doesnt get it - Like this recipe - tastes great, I guess if you LOVE ketchup.  The ketchup was very overpowering.  Thats really all I personally could taste (but I dont use ketchup on anything I eat so I try not to typically rate something based off of my tastes) but I made this for a pot luck lunch - no rave reviews - they werent even all finished - very disappointed based on the reviews given - I know my tastes arent the norm, Im very picky, but I expected more based on the reviews - Sorry.
EDIT:  Made this again - tried to cut back on the ketchup - the hubby likes this sauce alot but me and the boy think its basically fancy ketchup

I made these for a Halloween party and they were a huge hit. Everyone loved them. I was flattered when I saw one guy go back for 3rds as he walked by he said "these meatballs are awesome"! He didn't know that I made them...      I, personally, will add a touch more honey next time. That is just my taste.       I heated them in the crockpot for 3 hours on low before the party and they were kept on low for another 3 hours at the party and they seemed to get better as the night progressed.

Last minute decision, had frozen meatballs needed a sauce.  So, I searched All Recipes and found one.  I had all the ingredients on hand, no need to go shopping.  I brought appetizer meatballs to a family gathering, they were a HIT.  I got thumbs up from my grandaughter, who usually is very picky.  This recipe is a keeper.

These were just ok for me.  I followed the recipe exactly except I added some brown sugar.  There's no one flavor that really stands out.  They're just kind of tangy and sweet.

Made these yesterday for a biker Christmas party.  Followed recipe exactly but just doubled (ya know how men are) All I did was smile as big bikers were huddled around the crockpot raving about them.  One said they were better than the ole chili sauce/grape jelly recipe his wife made.

Made with no alterations from the recipe (a rarity for me), except for I halved it, and substituted crushed red pepper for the cayenne (because I didn't have any). Dee-licious! Thanks.

I had to substitute an 8oz can of tomato sauce because I didn't have enough ketchup. Tasted good, but a little too sweet, so I added about 1 Tbsp of soy sauce... also left out the water since I was making it in the crockpot. Nice change from traditional bottled barbecue sauce!

These meatballs were amazing. To make it quick, I threw everything in the slow cooker (cooked on high for about 4 hours), added about a tablespoon of barbeque sauce. Everyone loved them!

These meatballs are tasty. But here's why I gave them 3 stars.. First, the ketchup flavor is very strong. It needs to be tempered with more than vinegar & water. Some people prefer that flavor - and that's fine. If that's you - then this recipe will taste great! I ended up tweaking it quite a bit (added minced fresh onion, tbsp brown sugar, a dash or two more of cayenne, some chili sauce I had in the fridge, 2 tbsp bbq sauce).  It needed a kick - so I gave it some.. and it was pretty darn good.  :)  Second - I honestly believe the meatball recipe that uses grape jelly & chili sauce is really much better. No ketchup taste - and has a nice kick to it.. not to mention - could it get any easier?  Do an ingredient search with meatballs, chili sauce, grape jelly - and you'll find several recipes.

I made these meatballs for a party and they were really enjoyed.  I used Italian style small meatballs because I couldn't find plain and wasn't sure how they would be.  Success! What a great and easy recipe.  I put them in my crockpot so they stayed hot for the duration and only had a few left over.  The only change I made was that I added brown sugar for some of the honey as I didn't have enough.  I was asked to make them again this weekend for another party so they must be good.

Very yummy!  However, I think if I used a different type of meatball, they would have been better.  I used fresh (not frozen) Italian meatballs from the meat department.  The Italian herbs mixed with everything wasn't the best combination.  The fact that they were fresh was not a problem, though.  I baked them before putting them with the sauce.  My husband makes some nice onion meatballs with Lipton Onion Soup mix; I think that would have been much better.

I made this for a New Years party and it was a hit.  All of it was gone!  I dumped the meatballs in my crock pot while I mixed the sauce on the stove.  I changed the white vinegar to a 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar, and added about 2 tablespoons of brown sugar.  Once the sauce was all mixed, I poured it over the meatballs in the crock pot and left it on high for 30 minutes, then on low for an hour.  They were so, so delicious.  I will say, though, that I did a 2 pound bag of meatballs and it was gone fast with 6 adults.  I recommend making 4 pounds (2 bags) and altering the measurements accordingly for a larger group.  I added a photo to this recipe for how mine looked when done!

I made this tonight as an appetizer for a pot luck gathering.  It was very popular and got eaten really fast. 7 people asked me for the recipe.  The kids loved it (even my 2 picky eaters).  Ppl were dipping chips into the sauce after all the meatballs had been eaten!  I didn't have any honey so used brown sugar instead.  I defrosted the meatballs in the microwave then put everything in a crockpot on high for 1hr.  I'm going to make this again as an appetizer for xmas day. It was really tasty.

I wasn't crazy about this but my kids loved it so I gave it 4 stars. To me, it tasted like processed food but what can you expect if you use ready made meatballs. Maybe next time I will try making my own meatballs and cooking them in the sauce.

I made the sauce the night before on the stove. The only change I made was added a little brown sugar and a dash of liquid smoke. The next day I threw the meatballs in the slow cooker, poured the sauce and cooked on high for 4 hours. They were a big hit at the party and super easy to make!

Big hit for Christmas family gathering!  Not one single meatball left.  I only tweaked the recipe a little bit.  I added a little bit of brown sugar, a couple of dashes of onion powder, and a little more ketchup and garlic powder than recipe calls for.  Just basically add things to your preference.  I also simmered mine for 30 minutes then added thawed meatballs and simmered another 30 minutes.  Sauce is better if it's allowed to simmer a while IMO.  Great recipe.  Will definitely make again.

I prepared these as written and then put them in a foil packet on the grill.

These were a hit at my party with kids and adults.  Followed the recipe but doubled it and put all in the crock pot for about 6 hours.  I did not cook sauce on stove first so could add less water since doing it right in crock.
