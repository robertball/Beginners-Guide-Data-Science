This is how I usually make a ham and everyone loves it. My boyfriend will ask for me to make my ham and pineapples atleast once a month. I usually use a boneless ham as I get grossed out by bones in any kind of meat. I also will use canned pineapple in pineapple juice if we don't have fresh pineapple. The only other thing I do differently is I put the brown sugar on the ham first then cook it then make more glaze and add it about an hour before done then again about 30 mins. later. I kind of tripple glaze the ham!! Great recipe!!

This is my all time favorite. When the ham is done I use the juices and ham drippings with a bit of yellow mustard, flour and water to make "Ham Gravy" to pour over the meat and mash potatoes.

I made this for Easter for a large group. It was absolutely delicious and people could not stop talking about how it was the best ham they have ever had (many guests actually admitted not normally liking ham!) It was so moist and tender with great flavor and the real pineapple slices were a delightful treat.

Thanks so much to the reviewer who suggested the ham glaze. It was amazing! And it is great as a condiment on a sandwich with the leftovers. I just used the drippings and whisked in yellow mustard and flour. Yum!

I made this for Christmas dinner and it was a big hit! My stepdad is not a fan of pork or leftovers - but he snacked on the leftovers the next day. Thanks for the easy and delicious recipe!!

This was delicious and quite easy! I would wait to put the glaze on until about 30 minutes (if that) from the end time. Our got a little burned because of the glaze, but really was delicious...and I made it for the first time with guests.

Delicious ham!  I only had canned pineapple chunks, so that is what I used.  The baking time was right on for a 6 lb. ham.  I did make the glaze on the stovetop rather than the microwave.  I just put it on low heat and it did eventually thicken up.  The glaze added a lot of depth to the ham and the leftovers reheated nicely.  This was served with 'Easy Corn Pudding' from AR, and we had a terrific meal.

We use a canned ham and canned pineapple in heavy syrup. Mix 2 cans of pineapple syrup with an entire bag of C&h dark brown sugar, place pineapple slices stacked on top and on bottom of pan, pour sugar mix over top of pineapples making sure to evenly coat everything. We also serve the pineapple slices separate. I usually have to fix 2 of the large hams to feed my family of 8 and there's no leftovers.

Easy, delicious, and modifiable.  I added a dash of ground powdered mustard that added a little something and took it to the next level.  Very good recipe. Thanks for sharing!

This was simple and a great go-to for a quick glaze. I used a smoked, bone-in ham. I think the smokiness was a perfect complement to the sweetness of the glaze.  I used two cans of pineapple chunks, and I did not do the toothpick part.

This was the first time I made a ham and it turned out awesome.  I didn't use fresh pineapple, just canned and I only used half the brown sugar at my daughter's request.   Turned out delicious!

I didn't use the fresh pineapple and I used 1 can in natural juice and also added a 1/4 cup Jack Daniels bourbon.  I put on ham before cooking and in between spiral layers.  My oven was broke so cooked on BBQ in pan and foil top, it turned out good.  Didn't brown up like I would have liked.  I would make this again.

I didn't quite have enough brown sugar for a full cup so I used a little bit under a cup but it still turned out good the only reason why I could not give it a full five stars is because my husband said he liked the way the ham tasted before I put the glaze on.  
We will be making this again! Thank you so much for this easy recipe

Great, tender, sweetens ham and I made it even easier. I used canned pineapple chunks and additionally put some of the pineapple juice on it before putting it in the oven. This got rave reviews.
