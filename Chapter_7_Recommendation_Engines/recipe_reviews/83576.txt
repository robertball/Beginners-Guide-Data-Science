I thought this salad was exceptionally delicious and healthy. I recommend pressing the entire tofu block for at least 20 minutes before to remove excess water in the tofu (I place the tofu on a plate and put some weight on top -- like another plate with a bag of beans on top -- and then pour off the liquid once it builds up). I think the pressed tofu is able to capture the marinade better and just tastes nicer. Great recipe!

Loved it!  Colorful, crunchy, tasty.  Healthy too.  I added extra peanuts because I like them a lot, but in fact the recommended amount would have been better.  Might try a bit of cilantro or a dash of lime juice next time.
Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe obeys the 4 flavors in Thai food: sweet, salty, sour, hot.  Nice.  It also has great textures.  Many reviewers suggested pressing tofu before use.  I agree but went one step further.  Since the tofu is not to be cooked and there's a raw, beany taste to uncooked tofu, I microwaved the tofu on LOW for a few minutes until it was very hot throughout before pressing and draining.  I also subbed garlic powder for the crushed garlic b/c I'm not crazy about a strong raw garlic taste, and I put the shredded cabbage aside to be used as a bed under the marinated ingredients.  Really enjoyed the resulting almost no-cook summer dish.

What do you mean the "leftovers"...there were none! Absolutely amazed that this turned out so well as I usually shy away from using tofu...impressed at how easy and quick it was to prepare; for something so quick the outcome was incredible- stunning colours /a fresh and fruity taste(with a kick due to my peanuts!!).  I could not get sweet chili sauce so used a chinese plum sauce.  I substituted green beans for snowpeas and also added 3 colours of peppers (capsicums) for their sweet taste, great colours and crunchy texture.  Finally, instead of regular peanuts I used a "mexican botana" flavoured variety, which added an amazing kick of lime and chile (I suggest adding lime if you are using regular peanuts).  The best accolade was that my husband couldnt get enough of it and insists I make it again!

I really enjoy the flavours and texture of this dish, but find the ingredients a bit out of balance.  As written, I find it heavy on tofu, and a bit short on marinade and snow-peas. I'd recommend doubling the snow-peas, and (for me) halving the tofu. If you keep the tofu quantity as written, I'd recommend doing perhaps an extra 50% marinade - depends a bit on how finely you cube the tofu, and whether you'd like a little extra marinade to get anywhere near the veggies, or not.  Anyway, in principle, it's great!  I shall keep experimenting!

this was ok as written. i made it a second time and made these changes. first i used chicken instead of tofu, sugar peas instead of snap peas used 4 baby carrots as i had no other ones in the house and doubled the red cabbage. i cooked the chicken in the marinated sauce then stirred all together in a large bowl and served over angel hair pasta, also added soya sauce. yum

I'm not one for tofu usually, but this salad was really good, and even better the next day once you let all of the veggies absorb the dressing. Made a few changes: we added in a bit of sea salt and left the snow peas raw, which I think makes it even better. They're crunchier that way. The recipe can easily be doubled, and next time I think we'll take it on a picnic. Thanks for the submission!

This was delicious, and I will make it again.  Important to note, is that I pressed the tofu between a towel to get excess water off (for about 30 minutes)....  it helps the tofu absorb more flavor.  Also important, is that I doubled the sauce, because otherwise there simply is NOT enough sauce for the salad.  I didn't have peanuts, I used chopped cashews.  Next time, I might try to reduce the amount of sesame oil a little, for health reasons.  Overall, a yummy recipe that deserves 5 stars for taste.

REALLY, really delicious!! One thing I will change next time: double the liquid ingredients in the marinade. Otherwise, you've got a pretty dry salad there.

A colorful presentation! The crunchy texture adds to this light tasting salad. I love tofu (hot or cold), grew up eating tofu and so I knew I would like this salad. The first thing I do before anything is to place the firm tofu on layers of paper towels set on top of a plate, bowl or baking pan for up to one hour. This helps to get the excess water out from the tofu. This is the best way I know how to drain all the liquid from the tofu. I then clean the snow peas, blanched them in boiling water then cooled it off in ice water. I took a vegetable peeler and shaved the sides of one medium size carrot, then finely shredded a small red cabbage.  As for the dressing, I made a slight variation after tasting the dressing per the recipe submitter and that was to add a little smidgen of white sugar for sweetness. I did omit the sweet chili sauce, personal preference. I doubled the amount of dressing, mixed everything, set it aside. What is nice about this dressing is that you cut down the amount of ingredients if its needed. I then cut up the tofu, layered the veggies and sprinkled some roasted peanuts on top. I poured the dressing all over. yum! Love the crunch of snow peas, cabbage, and peanuts along with the sweetness of carrots. A healthy alternative  and very refreshing taste. Went great with hot rice and the "Sesame Seared Tuna" (found on this website) also a wonderful recipe.

WOW!  Talk about a lot of flavors.  Tofu isn't my favorite but wanted a recipe that was easy, healthy and of course tasted good.  This is it.  The only negative I noticed was leftovers didn't keep too well.  It was still good but looked like purple mush.

I was looking for ways to get more veggies and tofu into my diet, and this was pretty good.  I never knew I liked red cabbage.  Defintiely double the marinade.

I am usually not a lover of tofu, but this recipe highlighted it with flavour and texture making the finished product quite palatable. It is a wonderful recipe when you're looking for a salad to go with an asian themed dinner.

This was very good but I made a few changes.  I followed one user's suggestion to drain the tofu by pressing and then to cube and freeze overnight followed by thawing and pan frying the next day.  I had chili garlic sauce in my fridge so I used that instead of sweet chili sauce.  I also left the ginger (my Husband doesn't like it) and seasame oil (my daughter is alergic to sesame) out of the marinade.  I used olive oil instead of sesame oil.  I also tripled the marinade.  I couldn't find snow peas so I left them out.  I used a package of broccoli slaw instead of cabbage.  I added julienned carrot, yellow and orange bell peppers to the broccoli slaw.  I also left out the peanuts because my daughter is alergic to them.  With the changes it was fantastic.

This dish was very flavorful and refreshing.  I doubled the sauce as other suggested.  I ended up adding a lot of flavoring at the end as well (including rice wine vinegar and teriyaki sauce).  I also sauteed the tofu for a few minutes and let cool before combining.

This was easy, healthy, and delicious.  The kids even ate it.  This will now be a part of my regular rotation.

Note: I substituted Napa cabbage for the red cabbage because I had it on hand.  Still great!

Nice healthy recipe to get tofu in your diet, with tangy Asian flavours. Thanks for uploading. Changes I made: As suggested by others, the second time I made it, I tried chicken instead of tofu. Just bake an equal weight of chicken breast in the oven for 25 minutes, then shred into small pieces with your fingers. I also used Chinese cabbage (aka Chinese lea  Tofu Salad Your Rating: (more stars = better)f) since I had no red cabbage to hand. Finally, used more dressing than stated in the recipe, as others recommended. Delicious.

This was exactly the dish I was looking for.  I doubled the dressing portion and made sure the tofu was well drained.  The snow peas were only boiled for a minute, so they keep their crunch!  The leftovers stayed well too!

This was incredibly tasty!  I had a box of tofu in the cupboard for months and decided I MUST use it up so made this. I don't normally eat tofu but this salad was really tasty.  I didn't have red cabbage and I put a little extra sweet chili sauce in but it still seemed great.  The texture of the nuts added to it too.  I didn't cook the snow peas and the crunch was lovely.  I will be making this again!  Tofu Convert.

This was disappointing. I expected the salad to be flavorful but it wasn't.  The dressing from the tofu did not add enough flavor to the salad.  It was way too bland.  If I was rating the salad based solely on the way it looks/appeal, it would get a 5+ in my book.  Not a keeper

so...some will think it's not fair that I gave it 4 stars when I'm not technically rating the original recipe BUT if not for this recipe I would have never had what I had just a short half hour ago! AMAZING!!! I always read through the reviews, for what they're worth. Initially I was very turned off by the sweet chili sauce. It's so goopy! Not my fave. But then someone said leave it out and add some sugar. BRILLIANT!!! So I began by pressing the tofu. then I shredded half a head of cabbage and grated up one carrot and threw in a big handful of peanuts. Looked good already. I made up the marinade omitting the chili sauce and added sugar. Not so good but really what did I expect right? So I added a T of rice wine vinegar. Hmmm...then I added another, a squeeze of lemon and a total of 1 T sugar. OH WOW! I poured that over the cabbage, totally forgetting its original intent to marinate my tofu! so I just threw the chopped up tofu in, mixed it all together and yummed my way through half the bowl. I literally had to stop myself from eating the whole bowl!!! OH WOW!!! hence the 4 stars-because on my own I never would have come up with this...and believe me I will probably eat the other half tonight for dinner and I know I will have this at least once a week from now on! I LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!

yum! A few alterations: I used 1/2 a head of red cabbage, a full block of tofu, a small bag of frozen snow peas (I sauteed them before adding to salad), spicy pepper oil instead of sesame oil, and no ginger. I pressed the tofu as was suggested and also sauteed it in a portion of the marinate.  I doubled the marinate and mixed in over the cabbage and snow peas before adding the sauteed tofu.  This is a new favorite for sure!

I love this salad.  It is easy, delicious and nutritious.  It keeps well in the refrigerator.  I like to add a few sprigs of fresh cilantro, too. I do not really measure anything; just add together to taste.

Very good taste, but next time I would double the amount of marinade. I added extra chili sauce at the end because there was just not enough marinade. I will definitely make this again!

Loved this salad. I doubled everything (and a few more peanuts) and got about 6 servings. The dressing has a nice kick from the chili but not too hot. My vegetarian husband loved this. I did serve some brown rice on the side for him to carb-up on. Cold and crunchy for a hot summer evening.

Excellent.  Still thinking of it the following day.  Other than adding a TBSP lime juice, followed the recipe as submitted.  Can't wait to make it again.  Thank you for sharing Jean.

Finally a tofu recipe that both my husband and I can appreciate!  I will be making this often.  I did make a few changes: I replaced the peanuts for soy nuts and I tripled the dressing while cutting the garlic in half.  I also added more ginger than called for.

I loved the marinated tofu but I'm still unsure about the combination used for the salad itself.  It's not bad but it's not the best - I might try using Napa cabbage next time.

Sorry, the positive reviews spurred me on, but in the end tofu's texture let me down again.  No matter how hard I try, I just can't handle tofu. The salad looked pretty though, and the dressing was a nice flavour, so in the end it wasn't a complete loss.

I was thinking about giving this recipe a four, because it was quite good but not *the* best salad or tofu that I have ever had.  The bf, however, stepped in and said "Give it a five!  This was really good and tofu normally sucks!"  Hah.  :)   Thanks for a very nice recipe.

Made it for a party, and it seemed to be a hit.  I doubled the amount of dressing as recommended and increased the amount of vegetables.  Since I'm not too skilled at making Asian dishes, this encourages me to try more.

As written this just didn't work for us at all.  The flavor was promising but there wasn't close to enough liquid to dress 4 cups of veggies.

This was delicious! The only thing I di differently from the recipe is to squirt some lemon on at the table as the dressing, in  my opinion, needed some acid. I will definitely make this delicious, nutritious recipe again. Thanks!

We liked this. I think we should have used all the tofu as now there is this tiny bit leftover. I did not have peanuts so used slivered almonds.

Delicious!  I made this as others had recommended and doubled the marinade so that my veggies would be really covered.  As for the tofu, I pressed it with a plate and a bag of rice for 1 hour, then cut it into cubes and froze it overnight in a plastic bag.  I thawed it this morning by soaking it in a bowl of hot water and then pan seared it before marinating- a lot more work but totally made the salad!  I also did not cook my peas and julienned my carrots instead of shredding to give the salad more crunch.  Turned out awesome and I will absolutely make this again!

I don't like tofu. But it's good for you, so I keep trying to find ways to eat it that I will like. This didn't do it for me. Yes, it was marinated, but it still didn't cover up the tofu flavor. I liked all the veggies (I put mine in raw), it gave it a nice crunch and lots of color. But the tofu...well, it still tasted like tofu. The search continues.

Excellent quick make. I brought this to our family Christmas dinner (and another salad from this site) and it was a hit!

Quick, easy and extremely flavorful.

Yum!  I actually made the tofu and marinade and poured it over one of those ready-made stir fry veggie packs from Tesco...so easy this way!

I loved this recipe and it definitely came out well.  I had accidentally forgotten to get the snow peas at the grocery store, but substituted with regular peas and added some Gorgonzola beans to make up for the crunch as I love crunch.  I'm huge on flavor, so I did end up adding more soy sauce as a "dressing", but otherwise this recipe was excellent!!

I can't believe how good this was.  We liked the sauce so much I doubled it so the salad would have extra dressing.

I made two changes, one good one bad.  I used Chinese sweet and sour sauce instead of the "sweet chili sauce" because I didn't know what that was.  I liked that change.  I also used canned peas rather than fresh and that was my mistake.   They were a dull color and they were mushy.  Next time I will use fresh, uncooked peas with this recipe.

I substited crab for tofu but otherwise followed the recipe pretty closely - did mix up the veggies a bit, adding cucumber, green pepper, bean sprouts.  But isn't that the joy of salads?  The dressing is awesome - love it!

Really enjoyed this salad, and thought it was a good intro to tofu.  I would also recommend the 'fruited tofu curry salad'.  Definitely agree with increasing the marinade.
