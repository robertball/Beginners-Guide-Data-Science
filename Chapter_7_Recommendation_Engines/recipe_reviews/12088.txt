I've been looking for this type of cobbler recipe. Most of the recipes I've come across either the dough is too runny or it is made with dumplings but this recipe is the best one I've tried(and I've tried alot). I have used this recipe several times and it will be the only recipe that I wil use from now on. The only thing I added to improve the recipe is to sprinkle some cinnamon and nutmeg over the peaches and sugar on top. Other than that I would not change a thing! Awesome!!!!

I like this. I changed things by cutting the sugar in half with splenda, adding 1 tsp of vanilla to the batter, and covering frozen peaches with 1/2 cup water and a half cup of splenda. This was good warm w/ light vanilla ice cream. And it was easy! This was my second time making it, so I am sure I'll make it again.

Very easy and delicious and amazing.  It actually worked.  When I first read to put the dough mixture on the bottom I thought it was an error but I followed the easy instructions and it turned out perfectly.  I even used both canned and fresh fruit.  I only use juice or the liquid from the canned fruit.  I have made it with peaches and apples but am planning to try cherry soon.  I love the way the cobbler picks up the fruit flavor from the fruit and the juice/liquid.  The only recipe I will use.

This was an excellent recipe, but I had a few problems...I used fresh raspberries and apple juice for the 1 cup called for.  It seemed like there was too much juice and it was very "soupy".  The center did not bake like the edges.  But, overall, 
it was VERY good and there were no leftovers from my picky eaters!

This cobbler is sooooo good!!! Wish I could give it more stars!!!  So simple, yet so delicious....sure doesn't get any better than that! Next time, I'm doing Cherry! Only thing that I would suggest is to watch the last step carefully as mine was a bit on the sweet side.  Still a highly recommended recipe - Thanks for sharing!!

This cobbler was pretty good.  I made it with blackberries instead of peaches.  My topping didn't rise to the top as I expected.

Delicious and simple!  I added a teaspoon of cinnamon and half a teaspoon of nutmeg to the peaches and baked for the specified time in an eight inch square pan.  It served six people without any leftovers.  I think I might double it next time because everyone kept asking if there was any more!

This recipe is super easy to make.  The problem with this recipe is the wait for it to cool down so we could eat it.  I used frozen mixed berries and cranberry juice instead of the juice form canned fruit.  Also I used brown sugar (sparingly) over the top of the fruit.  OMG was it lick the bowl good!

This was a really good and easy recipe.  I did add some cinnamon as some other members suggested.  I had to bake it about 10 minutes longer than stated because my cobbler wasn't done throughout.  I baked it in a 9X5 loaf pan, what other size pans did people use??

None of the breading remained on the bottom, so next time I would just spread all of it on the top to skip a step. Overall it was a good recipe.

I've made a couple of different cobbler recipes so far, and this was pretty simple to make, and quite tasty. I made it pretty much as written, except since the canned peaches came "in heavy syrup", I opted to omit the second 1/2 cup sugar (as mentioned). Also it was funny that when I drained the peaches, the syrup came to exactly 1 cup of juice, which was what was needed. I wasn't sure what kind or size of baking dish to use, but an 8x8 glass dish worked great. I might not make this again, but it lasted me for four desserts, and it's certainly worth trying.

I made this dish for the 1st Annual Cobbler Bake off at church.  It was very eye pleasing and watched several eyeball it on the table as they walked by.  Needless to say, the 4 qt casserole dish was emptied quite quickly! (I doubled the recipe.) However, it didn't win any prizes. boo hoo! I'll make again, it was very easy and tasty. I also used frozen blackberries for the fruit.

This was a very tasty cobbler.  I used fresh blueberries and used water instead of fruit juice.  It did require slightly longer to cook than suggested, and was still a bit soupy.  Next time I would reduce the amount of water.  I would also suggest cutting back on the sugar.  I love my sweets, but I think reducing the sugar to 1/2 or 3/4 of a cup in total would be plenty.

I've made this a number of times using canned peaches, but have also tried it with apple pie filling + apple juice and blueberry pie filling + pineapple juice. Definitely sprinkle cinnamon on top before baking. Always comes out perfect and never lasts more than 1 day in my house! Just make sure you thoroughly fork-blend the dry ingredients before adding to the marg/sugar mix to evenly distribute the baking powder and avoid clumps in the batter. Thanks for sharing...

This was a super easy cobbler and it tasted delicious.  I used peaches and strawberries.  Next time I'll probably use a 9x13 pan (instead of the 8x8 that I used).  The middle was a little underdone while the edges were overdone.  So I'm thinking if I use a larger pan that should solve the problem.

This cobbler always turns out perfectly for me and it's very quick and easy to make. I recently tried it using frozen blackberries and it turned out great. Tastes even better if you sprinkle a little cinnamon/sugar mix on the top just after taking it out of the oven. Update: I recently made this using a bag of frozen blackberries and 2/3 c of pineapple juice. It was delicious. I'll probably keep making it that way from now on instead of the peaches. Yummy!

Wonderful & Easy!  I make this often.  I have used peaches, apples, berries, and cherries.  When I use fresh black raspberries, I cover with water & the sugar.  This recipe has not done me wrong!  Definately a keeper!!! Thanks!

This was great! I used canned peaches in light syrup and left out the 1/2 cup of sugar at the end and it was perfect (but we don't like things super sweet). I will definitely make this again!

This was VERY, VERY good.  I made it for my Bible Study, and they ate it all up.  I made a whipped topping to serve with it.  I also sprinkled about 1/2 tsp. of the Pampered Chef Cinnamon Plus into the crust.  When it came out of the oven, I sprinkled about a tsp. more sugar w/ some more Pampered Chef.  I will definitely make this again, and it's soooo easy!

Very easy and Very Tasty!  I like cinammon & allspice, so sprinkled a bit on the raw batter before adding the fruit, and then sprinkled a small amount of brown sugar on the top - the fruit in syrup I used would be sweet enough so I skipped the other 1/2 cup of sugar.  I think next time I may add a bit of vanilla to the batter, just to see what happens... but *as is* this is a great recipe!

I absolutely loved this recipe. I am now able to make a dessert almost every nite because it is so simple. I am going to try every fruit filling. I used peach pie filling with this and it was "the best"! I have sent this to both my mother and mother in law to try. Thanks again!

Good, but I was looking for something sweeter. Next time I will use the regular canned peaches not the lite.

I made this recipe with fresh peaches.  I put the 1/2 cup sugar on the peaches and set it aside for 30 minutes. Then I drained the juice off and used it in the recipe.  Very good with vanilla ice cream!  Leftovers heated in microwave the next day were even better!

As another reviewer has said, I have tried a lot of cobbler recipes. Used my mother’s for many years and tried the others. Then I found this one and I love it. It is the only one I use these days. Sorry mom! I usually use the exact recipe but have added a cinnamon/sugar blend on top jus for variation. Either way it comes out great every time.

I also added 1/2 tsp. Of cinnamon and instead of canned peaches I used 3.5 cups of fresh peaches and 1/2 cup of fresh blueberries with 2 tsp. Water along with the 1/2 cup of sugar that the recipe called for. Best served warm.

I love this recipe. I've made it twice already, and plan to make it many more times this summer! I love that it is such a simple recipe--I don't even have to get out my big mixer. I "softened" the butter in the microwave, so some of it was melted, but that didn't seem to be an issue. I also used fresh peaches and blueberries, so I used apple juice at the end. The first time I only used half a cup of juice because I was using a 1.75 qt bowl dish. It didn't seem to need the whole cup, but then there was only a little bit of the "sauce" on the bottom. The second time I used the full cup of juice, but I also placed the cobbler in a more oblong 2 qt dish, giving the recipe more space.  I definitely used more than 2 cups of fruit the second time--two peaches sliced more on the thick side and lots of blueberries--probably 3 handfuls. So delicious!!!!

I make this recipe with whatever fruit is in season. I never use any other recipe. I omit some of the sugar, and add whatever else I see fit, depending on the fruit I use.

Loved this. I'm a cobbler nut and try different variations on cobblers and this one worked! I don't like peaches so I used fresh  blackberries and raspberries. I then added  cinnamon and brown sugar with the white sugar (same quantity) as the berries were tart. No water added as the fresh berries are juicy. I know I'll make it again.

Very good and versatile.  I used fresh peaches and strawberries that had been prepared earlier in the day.  They were sliced and sprinkled with sugar which brought the juices out.  No other liquid was needed.

Where I come from, we call this a "Bramble". Whatever you call it, it's delicious! I reduced the amount of sugar and also added vanilla and spices as I read in other reviews. I used frozen fruit and poked it down into the crust a little,it worked perfectly~

phenomenal and SOOO easy to make! I added frozen blueberries and rasberries to the fruit (and combined all the ingredients in a single pan to make this a 1 pan, less mess recipe). I added nutmeg and cinnamon as well.

My family receipe is that you use 1 cup of bisquick 1 cup milk 1 cup of sugar (2 parts equal) 1 stick of butter and a can of pie fruit.   mix the milk bisquick and half the sugar. melt the butter in the baking dish pour the batter into the dish mix the remaining sugar and fruit then pour over the batter. bake at 350 for 30 to 35 mins or until golden brown. YUM!!!!  This is the easiest receipe I have ever found but the best yet too. simply but still southern.

I have made this several times over the years, with canned peaches, fresh blueberries, and a combination of sliced apples & pears, raisins, & walnuts in the fall.   Got creative last week and made it with a can of whole berry cranberry sauce...just stirred it up to make it spreadable.  Added water in place of juice, and about 1 tsp. each of nutmeg & cinnamon to the dough mix......absolutely FABULOUS!  I make this again and again....everyone loves it...especially warm with vanilla ice cream!

Very easy and delicious!  I made in a 2 1/2 quart casserole and only used 1/4 c. sugar on top.  Next time I will add a little cinnamon.  Great hot out of the oven with a little vanilla ice cream!

While this wasn't as good as some of the more complicated cobblers I've tried and was a little soupy, it was so easy and convenient, and did taste good. I think one of the problems was I went with the loaf pan as opposed to the casserole dish - next time I'll use a 7 by 11 brownie pan and about 1/2 cup juice, and I'm sure that'll help the soggy-ness.
Go ahead and try this simple, fruity comfort food - I was craving vanilla ice cream with this! Thanks for sharing.

This was a really quick and easy recipe to make.  It's tasty but it wasn't really like a cobbler because the crust turned out so thick.  I'd make it again because of its ease and also because it's neat that the fruit starts off on top but ends up on the bottom once it's finished baking.

This was wonderful with fresh peaches.  I did mix the sugar and sliced peaches together before adding to the batter. I also added a little bit of cinnamon.  My family loved it.  Thanks for a great treat.

This is a quick and tasty dessert that I make at least once a week.  I vary the fruit and it is always a sure-fire pleaser.
