Holy cow was this good!  Simply excellent and perfect just as written.  I'm lucky enough to have access to an outstanding Italian bakery in Milwaukee - their beautiful long rolls and this herb spread were made for each other!  One of the best new things I've tried in quite awhile!

Extremely delish!  I would definitely use fresh herbs as I'm sure something would be lost using dried.  They are easy to get even in the winter at your local grocery store and what you don't use you can just freeze by washing, patting dry then spreading on a cookie sheet then place in the feezer.  Once frozen store in a ziploc baggie or an airtight container and use whenever you need fresh herbs!

Amazing! This is so much better than those cheese-laden garlic bread recipes, and tastes so fresh. I used two cloves of garlic, but I'd probably use another one or two to get the garlic-y flavour we love. I'm surprised this recipe has so few reviews. Definite keeper!

Wow- this is really amazing!  It tastes very FRESH!  My first go-round, I put it on Parisian loaf, which is fairly hard bread.  The second go-round, I bought French Rolls (near the bread in the packaged-bread area of the deli in the supermarket.)  Those seemed to be a bigger hit because you were a little less focused on not breaking teeth, and more focused on intense flavors.    This is so easy, once mixed, herbs stay green and fresh for at least a week too.  Delicious.  I'm trying to think of more places I can make this stuff for. THANKS for the recipe, Jennie!

A great alternative to garlic bread; I thought it was extremely delicious even using dry ingredients.  Will definitely make again and again.

Omg this was soooooo good!  This is definitely the way I will be making garlic bread from now on.  I didn't have fresh garlic on hand (just ran out!) so I used garlic powder.  I also used all dried herbs and it was jujst as delicious.  Really great recipe!

I'm a fan of all the ingredients and really looked forward to this recipe.  However, I found this to be overpowered by the onions, and didn't care for the overall flavor of it.  It was definitely edible, just not one I'd try again.

One of my favorite ways to prepare french bread...absolutely delicious! Use fresh herbs if you can, the flavor is much better than when using dried herbs :)

The flavor was outstanding.  We like this herb butter on corn on the cob or we spread it on toasting bread right when it comes out of the toaster.  It is a must try.

Just finished making this. WOW really nice combination of flavours. Even tasty on crackers without cooking (assuming you like raw garlic) but it's not overpowering in anyway. Great 5 Stars, thanks for sharing Jennie!

I substituted Earth Balance butter for regular butter, to make it vegan friendly and instead of french bread, we spread it on 9 grain toasted bread. FANTASTIC!!

Yum! Great flavor. I used whole wheat French bread and it was delicious. Next time I will throw a little mozzarella or parmesan on top. Thank you! :)

I've made this twice now and both times it's been very good - a little different than your usual garlic bread.  The second time I made it I didn't have fresh basil, so I added a little basil pesto which worked well.  I might try adding some parmesan cheese next time.    I'll be making this one again!

This was really tasty, even tho I had to use dried herbs, as that's what I had.  I use unsalted butter, so this needed a touch of salt for me to bring out all the flavors.  Very good tho.  Used "Italian bread using a bread machine" recipe off this site, and highly recommend it.  Thanks for the recipe!
