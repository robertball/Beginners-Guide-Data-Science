I've been making ice water pie crust for many years and was pretty skeptical of using hot water.  Wow, was I wrong! This was so easy and came out of the oven tender and flaky.  I added a tablespoon of sugar with the dry ingredients because I was making a fruit pie.  I didn't chill the dough before I rolled it out.  You must use waxed paper below and above because the dough tends to stick.  Use the bottom wax paper to 'flip' the dough into your pie pan and then peel off the paper.  Voila!

Absolutely wonderful crust!  I just threw everything into my food processor and it turned out beautiful!  The crust is light, flaky and delicious.  This will be my #1 recipe for crust from now on!

I'm a pie crust snob so I was hesitant to make this crust, but I was in a hurry and didn't have time to make my usual "Art of French Cooking" pie crust.  I was swayed by the glowing reviews.  I am not at all disappointed.  I followed the recipe to a "t", but did not roll the dough between waxed paper.  I rolled it on a well floured counter.  This crust is easy to make, easy to rollout, and the results are a light flakey crust.  What more could you possibly ask for!  I still prefer the buttery flavor of a butter crust, but one reviewer said she made it with butter and it worked fine.  If it does I just may say goodbye to Julia!  Thanks for a GREAT recipe!

This crust tasted really good.  It's a nice flaky crust that doesn't turn out to tuff.  I tried to handle it very gently, so as not to overwork it.  Also, I used just a little bit less salt.  If you like a sweeter crust you may want to add a little sugar.  I didn't though because I like my crust to be more salty than sweet.  I'll keep using this recipe from now on.  Thanks.

I think I have finally found a pie crust dough that works!!  Finally!  it can truly be "easy as pie!"    I just wanted to do a test batch, so I made 1/4 of the recipe, wondering if it would even work, 'cause that ends up being only 2 Tbsps of hot water. I used Spectrum Naturals Organic Shortening and followed the recipe exactly.  After stirring until the dough came together, I dumped it out on a sheet of parchment paper, formed it into a flat 1/2 disk, covered with Saran Wrap, and popped into the 'fridge for MAYBE 2 or 3 min. After clearing off my counter, I pulled the dough packet out of the fridge, placed the whole shebang on the back side of a cookie sheet and using a smooth-sided water bottle (cuz I can't find my rolling pin), VERY easily rolled the whole thing out into an oblong, roughly 1/4" thick. I took the Saran Wrap off, sprinkled some sugar and cinnamon over the top of the dough, and put the whole thing into a pre-heated 450 degree oven for about 10 min. It came out tender and flaky and crisp - just like a pie dough should.  Good flavor too!   I was inspired to do more with this than just eat it :) - so I spread some left-over homemade cream cheese frosting over the crust while still warm, then evenly spooned on some warm spiced chunky applesauce I'd just made.  I cut this up into "chunks" (wow! was that crust tender and flaky to cut through!) and it makes an awesome flat apple tart! :D

this came out perfect...and I am the worst at pie crusts..just avoided making them after a few to many mistakes.  This was great..used for a pot pie...rolled between saran wrap (its all I had) and used cider vinegar (all I had), and it was still the best pie crust ..tender,flaky.  Oh I mixed it in a mixer for a few seconds..but when I added the hot water to the shortening, it didn't melt completely..next time I think I am gonna melt in microwave.  You won't be disappointed!

Living in a tropical and humid Singapore, I really could not imagine how I can successfully pull off the traditional " cold "pie crust method being a novice baker. I decided to choose this recipe out of the 2 "hot " pie crust  since it seem to have additional vinegar which might make it work- pure gut feeling. I love it! except a tad salty so i have to half it subsequantly for my apple pie filling from Rose Levy Beranbaum. I did faithfully refrigerate after every step- dough formation, rolling out, fill pie pan, cover with 2nd pie crust before popping into the oven at 425 for 15min and 375 for 35min

I guess this has been on the site for awhile but would like to recommend it to everyone who has not tried it. EASY, tender, a gem to roll. I always prided myself on my pie crusts, but this will now replace the one I have made for 45 years.

Quite easy. I am used to making ice water pie crusts, and I saw this one and thought let's give it a try. I used butter (out of lard), so i omitted the salt, I added a tsp of sugar because I was making apple pie and I like a sweeter crust for that. I used my food processor to "whip" the fat and wet ingredients, and then used my hands to mix in the flour. Refridgerated it, then it was easy to roll out.

I've always had trouble when it comes to making pie crust, but not with this one.  I follow the recipe just as it appears and it turns out wonderful and flakey everytime.  Making pies is  not a big deal for me anymore.

This turned out better than I expected. I've always used the ice water method of making pie crust. This worked very well and made a nice, flaky crust. My only complaint was that it was a bit hard to roll out (even after refrigerating) and I wasn't able to roll it as thin as I usually do.

I've always been terrified to make pie crust! Over mixing yields a tough and unappealing crust. And then there's the rolling! That's why I buy pre-made. Until now! This is the easiest prep! Results are tender and flaky! And the extra bonus of how beautifully it rolls out between the waxed paper sheets! Thank you for sharing!

This recipe turned out fantastically...tender and flaky! I've had nothing but trouble with cold pie crust recipes so I was excited to try this recipe.  
I did end up refrigerating the dough before handling it and I rolled it out between sheets of saran wrap.  
So easy and so tasty! This is now my go to recipe for pie crust.

Much to my amazement, this crust turned out perfectly.  I had never heard of using hot water before.  I mixed all the wet ingredients with the shortening in my food processor then added the dry, which I had whisked together and pulsed about 5 or 6 times, just until it came together.  The dough was too soft to roll out so I refrigerated it for about half an hour and then it worked just fine.  This is a keeper for sure.

This is my husband's favorite pie crust. I always had trouble rolling out the pie crusts. This last time, I added an extra 1/4th cup of water, and it was perfect. It was easy to roll out all 4 pie crusts. I froze one for later use and it was just as nice as the other three.

This is the most flaky pie crust ever!  I've been searching for this recipe because it's the same one my mother used to use, but she never wrote down.  I just remembered the ingredients, but not proportions.  The only difference is my mother used lard.

Yummy! I made this for a chicken pot pie and it was delicious. It was quick and easy to put together and came out perfectly flaky. I don't know if it made a difference, but I used heavy whipping cream instead of milk since I had some in the fridge that needed to be used up. I would cut down on the salt by at least 1/2 tsp next time. If you're making a fruit pie you might want to cut the salt by more than that or add a little sugar. I can't wait to try it with fresh orchard peaches.

Fantastic recipe!  I used only 1 tsp salt, as I wanted it for a sweet pie, and it came out beautifully!  Could have been done by a pro - which I definitely am not!!  I used it to make the sour cherry pie from this website, to take to a function at church, and had to force myself to take it.  I knew if I did not, though, I'd be eating it all myself!  Even my husband remarked that it should be wonderful for a steak pie or any savoury pie, and this I will definitely be trying as well!  Many thanks for this recipe!

Update: After making this recipe, I realized that this "Hot Water Pie Crust II" recipe makes 2 double-crust pies or 4 single-crust pies. The "Hot Water Pie Crust I" recipe makes one double-crust pie or 2 single-crust. I mistakenly doubled this recipe (for 2 pies) and was wondering why my crusts were so thick . . . Previously, I hated making pies due to the hard work and the poor results. However, this recipe is extremely easy. And it makes a tender and good-tasting crust--much better than I've ever gotten in the past with traditional recipes. Rolling it out between sheets of wax paper works perfectly. I've made six pies in the last two weeks, which is more pies than I've made in a decade, and it has been an enjoyable experience. The only con is that the recipe doesn't yield quite enough. I struggled to get it big/thin enough to create a nice rim for my crust.

I was very hesitant to try this crust because it uses hot water but I decided to take a chance because the reviews were so positive.  I did make it in my food processor. Processed the wet ingredients till creamy, dumped the dry ingredients on top and pulsed about 5 times. I then wrapped and put it in the fridge while I prepared the apple pie filling.  I was having a hard time rolling it and I ended up re-rolling it between plastic wrap.  It was very easy this way but I was sure I had ruined it by handling it too much.  I was shocked how tender and flaky it was when I had a slice later. The full recipe was enough for a ten inch deep dish and 1 regular single pie crust.
I don't think I will ever make a cold water pie crust again.

I've tried several pie crust recipes here and all have been good. But this one is really outstanding.  It is very flaky  as well as tasty. It also can handle a lot of abuse when making but still comes out perfect. I made it today for a Cherry/Blueberry pie from this site and it was super good.

I have never been able to make a flaky pie crust before but this recipe made my Chicken Pot Pies a huge success!  Everyone raved on how flaky and tasty the crust was. The hot water made the shortening creamy, then when you add the flour, it comes together quickly.  That kept me from overworking the dough.  Overworking the dough has always made my crusts heavy in the past.  Thank You, Thank You, Thank You.

Fantastic pie crust!!  I've been searching for years for the perfect recipe.  Thanks Ruth!  I put everything in the food processor and whipped it all together.  Dough rolled out easily and was a beautiful texture.  Flaky and tender after baking.  A keeper!

When I was little, my mom used to make cinnamon rolls with pie crust.  I lost her recipe, and today really wanted to make some.  Enter this recipe.
i am not a baker.  i threw all the ingredients in the food processor and didn't pay any attention to the  order of things.  Yep, I broke all the rules and still, the crust was perfect!
I didn't have any wax paper, but I did have parchment paper.  I used it on the countertop side with some extra flour, and used flour on my rolling pin.  NO refrigeration prior to rolling out.  
Rolled as thin as I could (which wasn't super thin), slathered with butter, cinnamon, and brown sugar. Cut into 1.5" slices, put in 9x9 glass dish, and baked for about 45 minutes.  
I made a quick glaze with butter, powdered sugar, vanilla, and heavy cream.  Poured over while it was hot, just out of the oven.  
I will never use another pie crust recipe.  So easy.  Like a "Pie crust for dummies" recipe.  And delicious!

OMG! It's two days before Thanksgiving and I am making three pies (pumpkin, mince and apple). The first recipe I tried, the crust would not hold together. I ended up making little pie crust treats by baking pieces of the crust. The rest was tossed.
The 2nd recipe used lard and cold water. It turned out OK. Then the 3rd crust, this one, was incredible. I found it on the internet tonight and thought I would try it. The idea of using hot water was different, but all the reviews were good. The crust came together quickly, rolled out well (between the was paper), and there was enough crust for bottom and top. I would rate this 10 stars if possible!

I have avoided pie making because of frustrating crusts. This dough was tough to roll out but the results are worth the extra work in the end. Set my fruit pie on bottom rack at 375 degrees F  for up to forty minutes, worked excellent. Will by my regular crust recipe for sure! Thanks

Light, flakey, easy to make. What could be better? I used Kroger's white whole wheat flour with no other substitutions. This technique is used in making fluffy frosting by whipping the oil and warm water until the liquid is incorporated into the fat. This guarantees even distribution of the fat and water, giving the crust a light flakey texture. Yum!

Wow. Beautiful and easy. I have a new favorite! The recipe makes enough for two double crust pies, so you could reduce if extra is not needed. 
I did sub 1/2 the shortening for butter and it tasted beautiful. I would try next time with all butter to see if the texture stands up.
I used wax paper for rolling out and was able to get a much smoother and thinner roll than with typical chilled dough recipes.

UPDATE: I've figured out why I could never get the crust to come together: there's TOO much flour.  Over the holidays, I baked a few pies (sweet and savory) and for some odd reason my crusts always turned out pliable, and I even used leaf-shaped cookie cutters for the top of an apple pie. I always add my flour by the 1/2 cup when I mix, instead of dumping the full amount from the start.  I only added ENOUGH flour for it to come together into a smooth ball, which was only 3 cups, not 4. With 1.5 cups of shortening/butter, that's a proper 1:2 ratio of fat to flour, so it won't ruin the texture of the crust. It will still be soft and flaky, and would probably also make a bomb cobbler topping too.

This has fast become a favorite crust recipe since it's so versatile.  It's great for both fruit and meat pies.

Oh, fyi, I make this with margarine sticks since shortening is hard to get a hold of where I'm living in Europe.  Still comes out very flaky!

This is the best pie crust I've ever made!  I usually shy away from making pie crusts because I was never able to do it well in the past.  The vinegar really adds that special "something" to the flavor of the crust.  Thank you!!!!

Made this for the pineapple mango pie on this site.  This I the only way I can make good pie crust, the cold water method doesn’t work for me.  It’s flaky and delicious and is my go-to pie crust recipe from now on.

I had difficulty rolling it out; it did not stay together. I was having that problem with another recipe,when I looked up this recipe, but had same difficulty. Could it have been the shortening I was using that I had the same problem with 2 different recipes? Anyone?

This made a terrific crust!  I substituted 1 cup of the shortening with butter to give it a buttery flavor and it came out great!  Rolling between wax paper is a must and makes it easy to flip it into a pie plate.

One of the reasons I haven't made pies in years is because when I moved six years ago I left all my recipes in my apartment two states away in error. After trying this much easier recipe than my old one I now make pies weekly. This crust is so easy and so good! Very flaky and light.

I was very surprised how great this turned out.  This is my new go-to recipe for pie crust.  I used butter instead of shortening, since that's what I had on hand.  It tasted like a buttery shortbread.  I rolled it out between pieces of wax paper and did not refrigerate, and it was fine.  When I got it on the pie pan, it tore just a little as I was adjusting it, but that was easily rectified.  I plan to use this recipe for pecan pie next!
