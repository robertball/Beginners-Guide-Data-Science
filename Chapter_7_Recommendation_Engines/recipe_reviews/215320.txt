I was looking for an idea of what to do with butternut squash so I tried this out.  I like that all of the ingredients are things that are normally in the kitchen.  The sauce was sweet and savory and cheesy and delicious.  Next time I think I will puree it when done so that it covers the pasta better.

I thought the taste was wonderful.  I did make a couple changes based on what I had though.  I didn't have milk (doh!), so I substituted light sour cream instead.  As the other reviewer suggested, I added mushrooms.  I used about 3/4 of a cup of fresh shitake and button mushrooms, but next time, I think I'll double the mushrooms.  I also added about 1/4 cup of blown sugar.  I thought the dish was a little bland, and the sugar allowed the flavors to blend wonderfully.  I think next time I will also use more apple and cut the pieces a little bigger.  I had cut then into 1/4 inch pieces, but next time I will do 1/2-3/4 inch pieces so you can taste the apple more.

Well, my husband liked it, so it's a keeper.

I made this vegan by using some almond milk in place of regular milk, using double the olive oil and omitting the butter, using vegetable broth in place of chicken broth, and shredded soy mozzarella in place of the italian cheeses. it still turned out delicious!!

Another way to prepare this is to use the frozen pureed butternut squash. It's in a box type of container that you microwave.  Make a rue with butter and flour and a little milk.  When thick add in butternut squash and parm cheese.  Loosen with more milk if needed. I then stir in grated nutmeg and a little chopped fresh or dried sage, salt, pepper.  Incorporate mixture with cooked pasta, I use shells, put into butterd dish, sprinkle with a mixture of panko, seasoned breadcrumbs, a little more parm, and melted butter. Sprinkle on to and bake 35 to 45 minutes or till bubbly and browned.  Yum!

I made this recipes (almost) as directed and was unhappy with the final look of the sauce.  The cheese did not melt into the sauce; it just kind of "glommed" onto the other vegetables.  It also did not thicken much.  This may have been due to the fact that I could only get a Mexican cheese blend and perhaps the Italian cheese blend would have melted appropriately.  It may also have been that the temperature was too hight   I don't know BUT.....I added a 1/4 brown sugar and puree'd the whole thing until it looked a bit like a very thick squash soup.  I served it over pasta with a sprinkling of fresh parsley and some parmesan cheese and my husband LOVED it!  He said it was one of the most orginal and tasty pasta dishes I have ever made.  He even asked for more sauce to put on his pasta half way through his serving.  I will try making this again with an Italian cheese blend as I would like a more chunky look for the sauce but it's great to know that the fall back position (if it does not work) will still be a big hit with my family.   Thanks for a winner!!

TO DIE FOR!  Rich, buttery, and a delicious mix of sweet and savoury.  I am in love (shhh, don't tell my husband...).  I followed this recipe almost to a T, the only changes I made were to use a slightly different blend of cheeses (parmesan, asiago, smoked provolone, and mozzarella, as this was the only Italian blend my grocery store had to offer), and also, once I had simmered the sauce to my desired consistency I found it a bit too chunky for my/my husband's liking, so I pureed it in the blender.  It came out so creamy and rich and wonderful,my husband and I both loved it and we will definitely be making this again.  SOON!  I think I will try it with heavy cream in place of the milk as well, just for a change, as that would make it even creamier.

Other than roasting my squash (cut lengthwise, drizzled with oil, made a tiny pool of oil in the cavity where I placed a clove of garlic and baked at 375 until squash was soft and cooked through), I followed the ingredients in this recipe exactly.  When I was done I sampled and it was pretty bland.  I added more salt and pepper to taste, more cheese and a hint of ground sage (not a big sage fan but it's quite tasty with butternut squash).  I thought the sweetness was enough but I think it also depends on what kind of apple you use.  I used a honeycrisp apple because they are awesome (sweet and tart) and I don't think I would have enjoyed this recipe as much if it were any sweeter. I also put the mixture in the food processor but left it a little chunky.  Even the hubby liked it and he's a fussy pain in the you-know-what to cook for.  Anyways, after those modifications I would give this recipe 5 stars.

This was great.  Sweet and savory.  I only had parmasan on hand so I used that and also had to add more liquid to get it thinned out for my noodles.  Next time I'd like to puree it.  Tastes great.

I made a few changes though... I used medium-ish sized butternut squash- didn't measure it (cut in half, scooped out seeds & strings, baked cut side up at 400F for 45 minutes then cut side down for another 15-10 minutes & it was ready), I chopped up the 1/3 cup of onion/whole apple/4 cloves of garlic in a food processor then sauteed in EVOO/butter. No stock so used 3/4 cup water + chicken bouillon cube, 1/2 cup soy milk, 1/3 cup 5% cooking cream then mashed the sauce to make more smooth (the sauce has texture unless you were to strain it before the addition of cheese) and then added a cheddar garlic-herb cheese blend. I forgot to mention how I seasoned the sauce... Dash each of onion salt/pepper/ginger/cinnamon, good pinch of nutmeg and about 2 TBsps. brown sugar. Savoury, but with a little sweetness. It's not perfect, so but definitely something you can tweak to your liking... Some reviewers mention adding mushrooms, I think that would add a nice meat-y taste to the sauce and will try that next time if i have any on hand.

Cheers to you, SPEARL, for creating one of only two ways my children will eat squash!  Thank you!  I did not have that kind of cheese on hand so I threw in a mismatch of what I had and it was great. (parm, goat, mozzarella, and creamy swiss) Blending was also key for me since it made it look a lot more like "mac and cheese".

This was such an awesome idea and really good recipe.  Live in S.Africa and Butternut is super cheap when bought in bulk so I needed some creative ideas on what to do with them.  I made a few changes do to lack of ingredients in this country and tweaked to our liking.  I added about half a cup of chopped mushrooms and 5 garlic cloves because it can never be to garlicky.  Used a whole small apple and since we do not have very much italian cheese in this country and what we do have is SUPER expensive.  So I used something that is called Tussers cheese here that is white and  Parmesan  that is in a shaker and it turned out awesome.  The reason I gave 4 stars is because my husband used to be a cook and he said it was a 4 star recipe.  Thanks for the idea.

Awesome. I would use more apple next time because I couldn't taste it as much as I was hoping for. Only change I made was to blend the sauce as a final step to make it completely smooth, but I'm sure it'd be great slightly chunky too. Thanks!! :)

I had to make this just to see what it tastes like.  The additions change the taste of the squash, so it's not exactly like just putting squash on pasta.  It has a little more spice to it.  Good and interesting variation.  Worth trying.

Despite following the directors, this turned out nothing like the picture.  The squash didn't really mash up into the sauce (and it never even tells you to mash) and the cheese didn't spread very well, so it was just clumped here and there throughout.  Overall, it's also not a very flavorful sauce, either.

Loved it! My changes: only had Parmesan on hand (and added a little extra), added fresh Chanterelle mushrooms to the sauté, and added a little cumin, thyme, oregano and parsley. Served over rotini pasta with crumbled bacon on top. Mmmm!

This was really, really good! I did change it a bit because my guy was worried it would be too sweet, so instead of the apple, I used a little less than 1 can of crushed tomatoes, and it was perfect. I also roasted the squash in the oven at 350 for about an hour instead of boiling it, and added some basil and oregano. It ended up being comparable to the fancy-schmancy gourmet butternut squash sauce I get in the store on occasion. This is awesome, and you should try it.

Made this tonight.  It was incredible.  A buttery sauce with a hint of garlic all to be delighted with this slight sweet taste with every bite of the pasta.  Used Rotini in order to get the most sauce and every pasta bite.

This was delicious!  I did make a few revisions though.  I could not get a hold of butternut squash, so I went with yellowneck squash.  So to keep the butternut squash "theme" I used 1/2 cup of butternut squash soup and 1/2 cup of chicken stock.  I also added mushrooms to the recipe as well.  All in all, it turned out great! Something I will definitely use in the future

So yummy!  I used about a half a cup to a cup of applesauce instead of an apple and I pureed the squash first before combining it with the other ingredients.  It came out so smooth with a perfect balance of flavors without being too rich.

This is one of the best recipes I have ever made!  I have never been a huge fan of butternut squash but wanted to give it another try, and I'm so glad I did. I took suggestions from others and made it vegan using olive oil for butter, coconut milk, and shredded soy cheese.  I also used the entire apple and didn't peel it first.  It was absolutely delicious.  I had planned on putting it over pasta, but it was so good that I just ate it plain.  I bought a two pound bag of diced butternut squash at Trader Joe's and used about half of it for this recipe.  I sure am glad I bought that big bag because I'm going to make another batch tomorrow!  YUM!

I thought this was delicious! I did use extra garlic and onion and quite a bit of salt and pepper to accommodate our tastes. I used an immersion blender at the end to smoothe the sauce out and served it over plain cheese ravioli and was very pleased with the result.

Very tasty and easy to make! I added a bit more apple and onion than recipe called for but it turned out yummy. I served the sauce on linguini and topped it with crumbled bacon. My daughters gave it a thumbs up!

First of all this sauce is so much prettier in bulk! I will take a picture next time as there will be a next time! After reading reviews I made some simple changes.  I mashed the squash before putting it in the sauce - I added a tad (maybe a 1/4 cup) of brown sugar, some sage and nutmeg and used most of the apple.  What I mean by bulk is that we served it over frozen spinach and cheese ravioli (well I did cook it LOL)so the presentation was very nice! Hubby was hesitant at 1st but went for seconds quite quickly!

Really bland. I added some curry powder which seemed to help it a bit. I made as directed except for the milk, I used Greek yogurt. Maybe more apple for sweetness will help.

This tasted good and I was excited about it but it just not fly as a main dish, perhaps a side. After a few bites it was just too much.

This was really good! Although I did make a few changes:  we were out of apples so I skipped that and added garbanzo beans for protein and a little texture.  Mashed the squash before putting it in skillet, and added a 1/2-ish tsp of cumin.  My 5-year old's comment: "this is really delicious Mom!"

Good sauce.... different and fun.  Not too difficult, and doesn't require crazy ingredients.  The sauce seemed a tiny bit bland, so I added quite a bit of salt.  Next time I'll try adding some brown sugar like others suggested.  I also put about 2/3 of the sauce in my Magic Bullet/Blender and then mixed back together with the rest (but that's personal preference, and because I knew my kids wouldn't want the chunks).  It was a bit thick, so I added more milk.  The husband liked it, but didn't seem to loooove it, so I'm giving it 4 stars.  :)

I am eager to try this recipe. A couple of weeks ago I had the butternut squash ravioli at Cactus Club Cafe and loved it....this sounds easier. I found an online recipe for the ravioli and it called for nutmeg, I think this would make a tasty addition to the sauce. I like the idea of adding a little brown sugar as well, I will try that. Thanks for all the suggestions!

So good! I made this as a sauce last week. I followed the directions, except I roasted the squash at 400 for 25 minutes instead of boiling it. I also added mushrooms and sage based on other reviews. This week, I turned into a soup by increasing some of the ingredients (2/3 of a 3 lb squash, 6 cups broth, 1 cup milk,  1.5 gala apples, leeks instead of onions, and 4 ounces shiitake mushrooms). So So good!

Yum! This got my kids to eat squash! I used apple cider instead of chicken stock which added a sweetness that went nicely with the squash. I added fresh sage as suggested by another reviewer.  I threw this all in the blender with every cheese I had (including a little bit of Cheese Wiz left in my fridge - so embarrassing! Also goat, mozzarella, and Parmesan). I also took the suggestion from the picture and added mixed frozen veggies. It was delicious!!

So, I kind of made up things as I went along, taking into consideration what I had/needed to use up and other people's comments. I had an entire squash (I ended up with 6 cups, so I have lots of sauce!), so I multiplied this recipe by 3. I read that a few people wanted more apple, so I chopped up 2 whole gala apples. I knew that I would be pureeing the sauce at the end (thanks to other comments), so I didn't worry about chopping everything small. I added one whole cucumber (quartered lengthwise then sliced) to the saute in the beginning. I had some spinach and a banana that needed using, so I divided the apple/garlic/onion/cuc mix into two pans. In one pan I added 3 cups of squash and a chopped ripe banana. In the other I added the other 3 cups of squash and a bunch of finely chopped fresh spinach. I didn't have any broth/etc, so I just added 1.5 cups of water to each pan, boiled and simmered. I decided to create a cheese sauce to add to the squash instead of just dumping in cheese (thanks to comments). In a third pan, I melted 1/4 cup butter, added 1/4 cup flour, then slowly added 1.5 cups milk, stirred until smooth. I added 1 cup grated colby and lots of parm. When that mix was good, I poured half into the banana pan and the rest into the spinach pan and pureed them both (separately) until smooth. Wow. I really enjoy both flavors! One is banana-y (which I like) and the other is more squash flavor, though it came out more watery than the other pan. Together they are Super!

It's like Mac and Cheese!  Or at least close enough for the kids.  I just throw it all into a pot, bring it to a boil, let it simmer until the squash is soft and whir it up with my immersion blender.

Really yummy.  I combined this recipe with another one I've used several times for butternut mac n' cheese.  That recipe calls for boiling the squash in milk, adding chicken broth, garlic, s&p, and several expensive cheeses which I can never quite bring myself to buy (with the exception of gruyere.  It's my guilty splurge).  So, for this one, I roasted a large butternut squash, which I diced, tossed with coconut oil, s&p, and minced garlic.  I then pureed with some chicken broth, almond milk (reg milk was sour), onion powder, and about three spoonfuls of applesauce (didn't want to use a partial apple).  I warmed this puree over the stove and added about a cup of shredded gruyere, a small bag of shredded parmesan, and just a handful of sharp cheddar.  Tossed it with a box of cooked whole wheat macaroni, dumped all back into the squash roasting pan (I used a lasagna dish) and topped with fresh homemade sourdough breadcrumbs.  YUM.  I never could quite find the perfect homemade mac n' cheese dish.  Fortunately, with the marriage of these two recipes, who knew that butternut squash was the secret key?

My family and I thought this was delicious!  First of all, I put it in the food processor to get the smooth texture that shows up in the picture.  I don't think it would have gotten there with just cooking it longer.  Also, I made it with almond milk because my son is allergic to cow's milk.  I made cheese ravioli and topped it with this sauce, toasted walnuts, and Parmesan cheese.  I served it with garlic bread and a salad.  All agreed, it was a delicious vegetarian meal!!!

A little sweet for my taste, but I should have seen that coming. Great texture and bold color. Cutting the apple and adding something more savory could make it more appealing to me.

This was very good.   I roasted the entire butternut squash in the oven at 425 for 90 minutes as cutting and peeling a squash is a pain.  Roasting it adds extra flavor and is very simple to scoop out the seeds and the flesh.  I pureed the squash and broth ( I did end up using 1.5 cups of broth but I never measured the squash).  I left the apples chunky in the sauce.  I used pizza blend cheese.  This was a great dish and I will make it again.

I didn't change anything to this recipe except for steaming the diced squash for 10 minutes. I read some people said it was lumpy so I put it in my  magic bullet to cream it out fast, then put it in the pan with the other ingredients.  If you think it's too thick then add some cream or more chicken stock.  I would even have this as a soup. Maybe add more apple, that was a nice flavor.

Thank you for this awesome recipe!  Followed it exactly. The only different thing that I did was add in a little cinnamon and ginger just for extra flavor. Great pasta sauce for people who cannot tolerate tomato sauce.

Flavor was good.  Garlic should go in shortly before stock, as mine was burning.  Next time I will skip the skillet and use a small pot so I can puree in the pot.  I added the 1/4 cup brown sugar.  Did not need as much cook time as written.

Very nice!  I made the recipe as written, except used almond milk because that's what we prefer.  I "mashed" the cooked squash with the back of a wooden spoon so the resulting sauce was rustic.  Next time I will try the immersion blender to puree.  The picture shows small pieces of carrots and peas.  I will try those in a future dish.  Served over handmade basil and garlic flavored shells that we bought at the Bethlehem (CT) Garlic Festival.  So tasty!

Gosh this was delicious. I cooked it down a tad more and added about double the cheeses and just had it as a side dish without being over pasta or rice.

I made a number of changes based on the reviews to add flavor, and with those changes I'd give it 5 stars!  I used 1/2 onion, 1/2 apple, 4 cloves garlic, rosemary, and a mixed Italian herb seasoning.  Roasted squash in oven first with olive oil & seasonings instead of steaming to add flavor.  Also blended with an immersion blender just before adding the cheese.  It's delicious!!!  Wish I made more!  Next time I think I'll add frozen peas at the end as well. 

FYI - 2.5 cups is almost 1 lb fresh butternut squash

Next time I will purée the sauce, it was chunky. I found it was a little bland, my fault for not putting in enough salt/pepper. I am looking forward to making this again.

Yum!  I followed the recipe exactly except added a bit of fresh sage at the end.  Very good.

Used the sauce like a Mac and cheese. Used applesauce , some apple cider, and mushrooms. Layered the cheese. Helpful to read other reviews.

Thank  you for this very enjoyable recipe.  My ultra-picky dinner guest  asked for seconds, and then asked for some more.  I didn't have the cheese that the recipe calls for so I substituted a nice cheddar and mozzarella which were flavourful and creamy.

I added chili and garlic seasoning as well as some mixed veggies (to make up for the lack of apple in my pantry)!

I used one acorn squash, baked it in the oven then let it cool slightly and scooped it into a bowl.  I then mashed it up and added it to the mixture already cooking.  I made the choice to add smoked chopped chipolte for heat then added 1T of brown sugar.  At the end I puréed it and it turned out awesome.   Had a great sweet heat that I will be making lots this fall.  Could easily add more broth and make it into a great soup too.

Excellent.  I used milk instead of chicken broth to make it creamer.  
Yum!

Overall I thought this recipe was pretty good.  I felt it was a smidge bland so I added some sour cream and crushed red pepper.  Just as other reviewers state - the cheese did not consistently met throughout & was a little lumpy.  I would make this dish again ;)  Thanks for sharing!

I would recommend not using it on macaroni (texture is disappointing if expecting it to be mac&cheese.) The onion and garlic really NEEDS to be fresh, for a good flavor. I didn't really like this, so I added a lot of bacon bits - then it was very good.

We really enjoyed this, but I made a lot of changes and would make more.  I added sauted mushrooms and spinach.  I pureed about half of the squash (which I'd steamed) and that gave it a great, creamy texture but with some good soft chunks of squash.  I also made a rioux and mixed the cheese in with it.  When I make it again, I'll put in a lot more apple (you couldn't really notice it at all) and probably some more garlic.

Had squash left over from my bisque so I doubled this recipe, substituted coconut milk, coconut oil, and fresh pressed garlic; respectively. I also omitted the cheese, added 1T rubbed sage and 1 1/2 tsp of turmeric. Pureed the whole thing after it was done cooking so it looked more saucy. Thanks for sharing.

Curry! I added some curry when I added the squash into the mixture and it was amazing. I also used almond milk instead of dairy milk and omitted the butter by substituting another TBSP of olive oil. I only had parmesan cheese and a tiny bit of chedder. I used vegetable bullion instead of chicken bullion. Served over rotini noodles, this was an excellent dish. Next time I might puree, but I did like the chunky texture after mashing a few of the cubes of squash. YUM! Will definitely make this again! (4 stars because I think it would have been rather bland without the curry)

Very simple and yummy recipe. And it was good even without onion and two of the cheeses that I did not have on hand. Can't wait to try it again with all the proper ingredients.

Like some of the others, I initially found this to lack some depth.  That could have been due to the specific broth I used which wasn't as rich as I would have liked. I was surprised that the sweetness of the apple did not come through. There was no mention of what kind of apple would be best for this.  I had a Fuji on hand, so that's what I used.  I'll try others next time. Because of the thin-flavored broth and the lack of sweetness from the apple, the garlic just ended up overpowering the sauce, so I'd probably cut the garlic in half. Despite all of this, I did enjoy the sauce. 

But I did have to make some modifications to appeal to my kids. I added a lot more cheese and blended the sauce. I also added a pinch of oregano at the end to give it a little more flavor.  Served with liberal amounts of Parmesan on top. My older child had seconds, and the second griped his way through it, but I was thrilled he ate as much of the veggies as he did (I also let him crumble corn chips over it - I didn't have bread crumbs or crackers...the things I do to appeal to a young palate). To the poster who asked why the recipe didn't look like the photo, the photos were taken by others who pureed their sauce, not the original poster.

I tried to veganize and de-glutenize this dish by substituting with Quinoa pasta, vegan buttery spread, vegetable stock, soy milk and nutritional yeast.  It was okay.  If anyone has further ideas on how to do this more successfully and with more flavor, please let me know.  I'm sure the original was great.
