I love earthy healthy recipes like this! Very simple, very good.

I made a "greek seasoning" mix of 2 parts each oregano and onion powder; 1 part each garlic powder, black pepper, and cornstarch; and 1/2 part each cinnamon and nutmeg (you can also add salt and beef bouillion granules). I used 2 tsps of that and around 1 tsp of salt, decreased water to 1 cup and increased tomato juice to 2 cups. I also used 1-1/2 cups of locally-grown shoepeg corn instead of canned, which gave it a nice sweet crispness.

I might try using something like Morningstar veggie crumbles next time to make this a vegetarian recipe.

This turned out much better than I expected. Because I was halving the recipe, I made the following adjustments: I used one can of dark kidney beans, a whole can of tomato with chilis (I didn't want four half-cans kicking around the fridge), and used regular green cabbage. I also added a dash of chili powder for some heat. Finally, I was glad that I had bought a large bottle of tomato juice because I found that I needed to add more during the one hour simmering process. It would have been way too dry otherwise. This is a really easy to prepare but tasty and comforting meal. Thanks, Kimberley!

I used 1 1/2 lbs.sirloin steak, cut into pieces and sauted with 1 chopped onion and 2 cloves garlic...then proceeded. Also added more seasoning, which is hard to find but definitely worth the effort and is essential to this recipe, in my opinion.  I'm a good and sophisticated cook and this is a very successful recipe!

This is so easy, you won't believe it.  Open the cans, brown the meat, and throw everything in the pot.  The recipe has a slight spicy bite, but not overwhelming--just right.  My wife thought it was excellent too.  The Greek spice is a fine, fine touch.  I will experiment with this spice in other dishes down the road.  Do note that the Greek spice version I found does have MSG in it though.  I'm eating healthy these days, so I used ground turkey.  This is a very good recipe--and completely fool proof (if I can make it, you can too).  Thanks.

I must say this recipe surprised me. It's wonderful! It's spicy (the Rotel tomatoes) yet sweet (the cabbage). I thought it would be somewhat similar to taco soup, but I like it better! Definitely a keeper! (Oh, I used Quorn instead of ground beef, lowering calories and cholesterol)

This is pretty tasty. This recipe makes a lot and we just froze what was left over and thaw for a quick meal.

I was really suprised with this recipe. There's really nothing to it. It was so easy to make and it tasted great! My whole family loved it! Even my father in law was impressed. But really, I will definitely make this again not only because of the taste but the ease of making it. It was also very inexpensive to make. My husband added sour cream and cheese to his and it makes a great taste as well. Definitely a must recipe!

I make this recipe excatly as it appears and everyone I have ever served it to has loved it.  You can't substitute the Greek seasoning with anything else, it is what makes this stew so great!

I did my cabbage and carrot in the food processor and did cut it back to about 12 oz (which was more than enough for us).  When I first mixed this up and  started simmering it, I really thought this was going to be a bust, void of any flavor.  Some flavor did develop after cooking, but I did use some beef broth in place of some of the water and added some garlic powder, salt and pepper to ramp up the flavor.  Super easy to make, and we thought it was OK.  Nice "make-ahead" meal for a lazy weekend.

Loved the addition of the slaw mix.   a great variation is I store up left over meats, pork,steak chicken, in the freezer and pull them out to make chilis and/or stew.   It worked very well with this recipe.

I loved the veggies in this soup. Didn't care for the Greek spices, will try Italian seasoning next time. I will freeze some for lunches next time. Thanks for sharing.

Just OK for us.  The only change I made was using ground venison instead of beef.  We both thought this needed more flavoring.  I added hot sauce, which helped.  From previous reviews I was expecting something wonderful...

Added a can of black beans and an onion and used a cut-up head of cabbage in place of mix.  Added a beef and a chicken bouillon cube.  Did not have Rotel or Italian style tomatoes, so used to cans petite diced.  Did not use the corn either and did not drain the beans.  Am glad for that, as there was almost not enough broth.  But, after all the changes of necessity or taste, we both thought it was very tasty.  Served with cornbread and lots of Tabasco!

I was unsure about this... it sounded odd w/the cabbage.  My husband can't stop talking about it, and the kids asked for seconds!  amazing.  THANK YOU.  This was super easy and I felt great serving it.

I made this for my family tonight and it was wonderful!  I used beef stock instead of water and that was the only thing I did different.  I made some corn bread to go along with it.  Fantastic meal! Easy, didn't take long and tasted pretty good :)

Couldn't be easier, so I will make this again.  I followed the instructions exactly, except that I used ground chicken instead of ground beef.  It was fine but not terribly flavorful.  Next time I will add more seasoning - I think it would benefit from crushed red pepper or hot sauce.

Very thick & tasty.  Added onion & garlic.  Couldn't find Greek-style seasoning at store so used Perfect Pinch Lemon Herb.  Used shredded cabbage and chopped carrots in place of coleslaw mix.  A little concerned about all the salt but we really enjoyed it.

I tried this recipe since I'd never thought to make a stew with cole slaw mix.  I liked the different textures of beans, beef and cabbage but as is the flavoring was bland for us. (I did have to sub tomato sauce for the tomato juice)I added additional spices to perk it up and my hubby really enjoyed it. I took another reviewer's advice and added cheese as a topping. I think it'll taste even better tomorrow.

A quick and easy delicious meal on a cold day. I served with a a pan of  Jiffy mix cornbread and was able to mix everything in 15 minutes, let it simmer for 45 minutes, and serve it to my husband and picky 18 year old son.  They're happily eating it again tonight for leftovers!**Definitely use the Greek seasoning...it makes the soup!!

I just finished making this, even 'though I wasn't sure about the cooked cabbage.  And, I couldn't find Greek spice, so used a pinch (each) of oregano and rosemary, plus a bit of minced onion and 1/4 tsp minced garlic.  I have no doubt that the "real thing" (Greek seasoning) would be better, but I really enjoyed my first cup.  Not too thick, but not runny, either, with a slight crunch from the slaw. This recipe is a keeper!

I have to say, I was skeptical when I read over the ingredients since most of it was canned. This one really knocked it out of the park. It was so easy and so tasty, not to mention hearty & healthy. The only change was that I substituted Jimmy Dean hot sausage instead of hamburger. It turned out perfect, just the right amount of spicy. I also had to make my own greek-style seasoning since I couldn't find it in the store. I used a recipe I found on allrecipes.com. I will totally make this again especially for company since it makes so much and is so easy. We took half with us camping and it was better re-heated a few days later! This is a good way to impress people.

This was an incredibly delicious stew....more like a soup tho to me but nevertheless, yummy!  I made up the greek seasoning with a recipe I found at this site.  It makes a lot so we'll eat it another night too and won't mind at all!  Lots of good flavor and so easy to make!

Really good!  Made almost exactly as written except didn't have Greek seasoning, so used sprinkles of black pepper, dried parsley, paprika, ground cinnamon, thyme and chili powder.  I also sauted onion, mushrooms and garlic with the ground beef.  This makes a lot.  Lots of leftovers, but even better flavor when reheated.  Will make this again.....very healthy and good!

I used some leftover roast from the night before instead of ground beef and it turned out good.  A nice stew recipe for the fall/winter.  Thanks for sharing.

Great for a healthy meal. The hamburger gives a lot of flavor. I couldn't find the greek seasoning, so I played around with the spices & it still came out good.

I'll add my 2 cents. For me, I added 1 3/4 cups beef stock instead of water.  Also a tsp. of Worcestershire and a tsp. of Au Jus to give a more hearty beefy flavor.  I made the original first and then readjusted to my tastes. Very good recipe.

This is  very easy to make and pretty tasty.  I didn't use Greek seasoning because I didn't have any on hand.  However I did use Italian seasoning and it taste great.   I also added chili powder and red pepper flakes for some kick.
Thank you for sharing.  I will be taking this to work for lunch.  Perfect for the cold weather.

I'll Just say it was good.  I wont make it again though.  I had a slight spice to it, but it wasn't anything to brag about.  Thanks Though
