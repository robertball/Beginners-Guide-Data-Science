After reading the many poor reviews I almost passed over this recipe.  However, I am glad I did not! An avid grapefruit eater I wanted to find a nice bread recipe that was not only easy to make but really captured the taste.  This recipe does!  I did change a couple things for my own taste (an extra egg, some grapefruit zest, replaced one cup of flour with .5 cup of sugar and .5 cup of brown sugar).. the result is a brightly flavoured favorite!

Just by looking at the measurements of this recipe, I knew it wouldn't work for me. I read through some of the reviews and edited it to work for me. The recipe on it's own should get three stars. With my adjustments, it's more than.

I used a half cup of softened butter and whipped it with the sugar, using half white and half brown until fluffy. I then added two eggs, instead of one, and threw in a little vanilla flavoring. I used the full amount of oats but I ground them down in my blender to make a smoother consistancy. I only needed one cup of flour, not three. I cut back the baking flour to two teaspoons. I alternated the grapefruit juice with the dry ingredients to keep the batter consistant and folded in a 1/2 c. of grapefruit sections I'd cut into thirds. I also added a 1/2 c. of cubed pears and a tsp. of pumpkin pie spice.

This turned out interesting. Very tasty.
This was useful for me as it used items that I had on hand and it will be great for a quick breakfast for the kids and I tomorrow. It's best with a little butter spread on.

Four stars with revisions (I don't think I would even try to make the original version.). I took clues from others and changed this recipe quite a bit. Used 2 cups of flour instead of 3, used 2 eggs instead of 1. Whipped 1/3 c. honey, 1/3 cup brown sugar and 1/3 cup white sugar with 1/2 cup butter instead of 1/4.  Added vanilla and cinnamon. Left out the walnuts (didn't have) and mixed chopped pecans with pure maple syrup and raw sugar and sprinkled on top. Baked in 9x13 glass pan instead of loaf. Brought it to work and the guys loved it. We have so many grapefruits here in Phoenix this time of year, I will definitely make it again (with my revisions).

I too was given some grapefruit that I need to use up. Will make again if blessed with more grapefruit someday. I'm giving this recipe a 5, although mine was actually a 4.5 in my husband's opinion. I altered the recipe after reading everyones reviews and falling short on some oats. I used 4 packets of instant oatmeal (3 w/ apples, 1 w/ cinnamon) and substituted bulgar wheat=1/2cup (hot water saturated, like tabouli). Because I like things sweet, tasted the batter before egg was added, in addition to the honey, I also added Sugar in the Raw to the recipe aproximately 1/4 cup, added a bit more juice to make the batter more liquidy as my batter was stiff (Probably due to my added bulgar wheat) so added maybe 1/4 cup more. I also sprinkled the top with almonds and Sugar in the Raw. My bread is very filling and wonderfully textured, and I love the crunch on top with the sugar and almonds. Yum.

I was given a ton of grapefruit and had no idea what to do with it. I do not really like it plain. I juiced them for this recipe (which I doubled) and it came out wonderfully. I was short on honey and flour, so I supped a little maple syrup and wheatgerm/cake flour, respectively.  The bread is not overly sweet but flavorful with just a hint of fruit underneath. The walnuts add nice crunch. I refrigerated the batter overnight, and the next morning it was pretty thick. I was worried that would affect the bread but it didn't seem to. The next time I make this I might add more cinnamon. It is excellent served with cream cheese, ricotta and jam.

I loved this recipe, but I altered it.  
I used 2 cups of whole wheat flour and 1 cup white flour.
I used orange juice instead of grapefruit juice, so it wasn't tart or bitter.  It was slightly sweet.
Instead of nuts I used raisins.  They added sweetness to the bread that made it more palatable to me.  It still wasn't overly sweet.
It was a little crumbly and heavy and the dough didn't pour, so much as was plopped into the pan.
It took me 1 hour and 15 minutes.

Okay being the health nut that I am!  I changed the recipe to Whole wheat flour and added FLax seed Meal.  I did not use nuts or honey but did use Applesauce.  I also used cranberry raisins.  I thought it was fantastic but a little dry.  I think leaving the honey out might have hurt the moisture issue.  I guess the way I made it was a 4.5, but the recipe itself is a 5!

Enjoy!

I thought this was awful. I re-read the recipe to make sure I followed it correctly and I did.  It came out heavy without much flavor. Threw out the whole thing.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I substituted the all purpose flour for wheat flour, and it did not seem to negatively affect the bread.  It was especially good with some whipped honey butter on top.  Very good, very easy.

One big problem with this is that it doesn't even remotely taste of grapefruit.  The zest of a whole grapefruit would definitely help.  It wouldn't help though with the fact that the bread is far too dense, and that the inside takes 20 minutes longer to cook than the outside, leaving the outside dry and a bit crunchy.  I will never ever make this recipe again.

Yummy.  I used soy flour and real butter and freshly squeezed grapefruit.  When I tasted the batter I worried that it was a little too tart so I also added about a quarter cup of turbinado (raw, unprocessed sugar).  I will make this again.

We made some edits for a sweeter and more recognizable grapefruit taste: 
1/2 cup honey, 2 eggs, 2 cups oats, and 1/2 cup butter. We also added 1/2 cup brown sugar and ~2 tablespoons of grapefruit zest. We used locally grown Ruby Red grapefruit.

We baked the bread in small loaf pans for about 30 minutes, and it turned out wonderfully.

I think that the concept is great but like everyone that has rated this, changes are necessary for any success. I will not make this again as written.

I followed the instructions to a T, and made sure all ingredients were fresh. Even the flour was fresh, and I squeezed the grapefruits myself. Ididn't enjoy this recipe. I couldn't taste the grapefruit. The loaf is certainly edible, as anything with oats and walnuts is okay, but without major modifications, this recipe is not one to make a second time. I do appreciate the person who put this on the internet for me to try, thank  you.

I followed the recipe as written, using grapefruit juice from our homegrown grapefruit. I did baste the top with juice a couple of times during the last 20 minutes of baking.
The bread is a bit dense, and dry near the edges, but the flavor is nice. I plan to have a piece as breakfast with some fresh fruit and yogurt.

The outside of this bread was so hard I had trouble biting through some parts of it.  The inside was too soft, and was only saved by a few minutes in the toaster oven.  The bitter aftertaste of the grapefruit ruined a pretty decent initial flavor.  I made a juice icing with powdered sugar, but even that couldn't save it.  It might have been better in muffin form as it would have been more evenly cooked.

Overall I was satisfied with this bread.  I found it to be moist and a good density.  I did not have enough grapefruit juice so I added some lemon and a little sugar to compensate.  I think some zest would go a long way to make this taste better while adding some zing to it, something it is lacking.  The top did start to get dark while the rest was still very moist, but in the end, it was good.  I will try it again with orange as well.

I used whole wheat flour instead of regular, and added a little extra honey. This bread is ok, but nothing special. Its has potential, but it definitely missing something... I just don't know what. It seems a bit dry and I'm sure a little applesauce would help. Might dry this one again, with a little experimentation.

I don't think I'd ever eaten, let alone baked, an oatmeal bread, so this was a pretty new experience for me.

I made the recipe exactly as written, and it came out pretty well. The bread is fairly dense, but still somewhat moist. It lasted me a whole week as a breakfast-time bread. I'm not a big fan of walnuts, or nuts in breads either, but with the way they baked into this bread, I could say that the walnuts were not bad. The honey flavor was somewhat prominent, and the grapefuit was pretty minimal, to my taste, although the grapefruit did leave an aftertaste as it usually does.

It's probably fairly good as these breads go, I guess. It's just not particularly to my tastes. I'll give it a 3-star rating based on how I personally liked it, but I'm guessing a 4-star rating is probably better for the recipe in general.

Very good.  I didn't have any honey, so used molasses instead.  Perhaps not as sweet tasting as honey, but really good.

Healthy, filling yet light bread- excellent for a nutritious breakfast on the run. I used the ruby red grapefruit juice for a sweeter flavor. Thanks for the creative spin to common ingredients!

Typical oatmeal bread.
