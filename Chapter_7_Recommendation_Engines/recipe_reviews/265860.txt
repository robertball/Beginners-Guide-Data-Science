This turned out delicious. I didn't make any changes to the recipe and used apricots as my stone fruit. It took one package (2 sheets) of puff pastry to make the crust, with some cutting and rearranging like Chef John shows in the video. I'll definitely make this again -- very simple and everyone seemed to enjoy it!

This was delicious. I used pluots also but used pie crust dough. Over cooked the crust a bit when precooking it so it was a little crispy. I also used hazelnut four and withheld the almond extract because I had some on hand and it still turned out great! Very simple and looks stunning.

I made this just as the recipe states. It was great and the family loved it!
