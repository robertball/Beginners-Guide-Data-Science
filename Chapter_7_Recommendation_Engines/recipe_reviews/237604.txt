Looked good on paper and no doubt will be good on the fork, too, but as it is baking I wanted to offer two friendly observations (not criticisms).  First, I doubled the scallops (I like scallops) so I needed my 3 Qt baking dish the 2.5 qt will probably suffice with one package of scallops (the small Bay variety).  Second, I cooked everything sequentially, so it took me about an hour to prepare (cooked scallops, cooked bacon in the oven (which took a lot longer than package directions even though I used two baking sheets so I could cook the whole pound at once) boiled pasta, etc.).  ?? ??

I used shrimp instead of scallops and added old bay. Delicious and easy!

Great taste, even has a good kick to it.  Not sure where it came from since no spicy ingredients were added, just a pleasant surprise.

Great recipe! My husband doesn't like seafood so I took out the scallops and it quickly became his favorite Mac N' Cheese dish! It's my favorite too!

Very good recipe.  I didn't have cheese soup so I made my own cheese sauce.  The bacon was a welcome taste.  I will definitely make this again.  I was wondering about adding some broccoli?  Maybe the next time.

Amazing dinner which was devoured quickly! I have substituted scallops with lump crabmeat which is also delicious.
