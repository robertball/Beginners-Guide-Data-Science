I really liked this salad!  I didn't soak the noodles at all--they soften up in the marinade enough and wanted it crunchy.  Used oriental ramen instead of chicken and since I like lots of dressing, added the mandrin juice to the mix.  

If you double this recipe, make sure you have a seriously huge bowl.  I made this for an office dinner and while I loved it, no one really said much, so.......4 stars.  As a leftover, the noodles and cashews get soft but it's still very good.  I'm planning on making this for Thanksgiving for my more sweet-toothed family.

And can anyone tell my why you must use white wine vinegar instead of plain 'ol white vinegar?  If anyone is interested, a single recipe of this salad cost about $7.00.

This is one of the best recipes I've made off this site.  I took it to a family reunion today & got many requests for the recipe & I come from a family of very good cooks!  I made a few changes--I left out the cashews and added 3 tablespoons of toasted sesame seeds, 1/2 cup of toasted sliced almonds and 1/4 cup of chopped cilantro.  I used the oriental flavor ramen mix which gave the dressing a delicious taste--similar to the dressing from a restaurant's Asian salad.  You definitely do not need to soak the ramen noodles first unless you plan to serve the salad immediately after making it.  I defintely plan to make this salad again for summer potlucks and as a main dish for my family with the addition of cooked chicken or shrimp.  Awesome recipe!!

Light and refreshing.  The oranges are a good addition.  I only made 1/2 the recipe because I wasn't sure I would like this, but it was great.  I like the ramen noodles on the crunchey side, so I only soaked them for 5 minutes.  Next time I might try not soaking them at all, and I will try it with the oriental flavor noodles.  The only thing keeping me back from straight 5 stars is the kid rating section...some kids might like this, but my kids, who are the world's most picky, won't even try it.  Their loss!

This recipe makes a great quantity.  I get asked for the recipe often.
I used one package of ramen noodles and added 1 cup bean sprouts, 1/2 cup chopped fresh snow peas, 2 tbsps. cilantro and 1 tsp. ginger. I substituted peanuts for cashews.

This is the absolute best salad ever. My husband had four helpings. We had some left overs, but not for long. This a real keeper. I used brown sugar substitute instead of sugar for the dressing.  I would not change another thing about this receipt. THE BEST!!  Can't wait to make it for company. Thank you for sharing.

Great recipe, I agree with other reviewers that you don't really need to boil the noodles as the oil mixture definitely softens them up pretty well while it sits in the fridge. But the first time out I did follow the recipe. While doing that I also felt with all the flavoring packets that came with the noodles, it made the mixture a bit too salty for my taste. So the second time around, I used 1/2 a packet. Next time, I might lessen the sugar and eliminate the sunflower seeds. Thanks Louise for sharing your delicious recipe!

I first had this salad at a "Food Day" at work.  It was heaven from the first bite.  I have since made it.  Adding fresh cilantro really gives it a wonder flavor.

Now one of my favorite recipes. Great for summer -- or for a taste of summer on a dreary winter day. Good fresh or a few days old (softened noodles are still delicious).

Hi!
I just made this for a big party social for a bunch of
college students. Everyone who had the salad loved it and
it was extremely simple to make. I did make some changes though...I think it needed more crunch (noodles overwhelmed 
it a bit) so I added a half a head of cabbage. I also didn't have white wine vinegar and used red vinegar instead. And I didn't have the sesame seeds so did without. Recipe still worked fine. Dressing was amazing.

I would actually say that the recipe makes more like 12-14 servings.

Great side dish!  Add cooked chicken and it then becomes a main meal.  I never have any leftovers with this one!

Sorry but we didn't enjoy this recipe.  I was missing the mandarin oranges, but I can't believe they'd make that much difference.  All three kids took one bite and said NO THANKS.

This is a wonderful salad.  Everytime I make it I am asked for the recipe.  I added boiled chicken breast which I slice and marinate in a little of the salad dressing. Wonderful salad to take to a potluck.  I usually make a double batch and come home with an empty bowl :)

I took this to a Halloween work potluck and was asked by several people for the recipe. I made a mistake in buying Ramen noodles without a seasoning pack. The seasoning was mixed with the noodles, so it washed out when I drained the noodles. I added chicken granules, but I'm sure it would have been better with the seasoning pack. I'll definitely make again. Thanks

This is GREAT!  I've made if several times during the summer.  It was a big hit at a potluck, too. I added about 2 tablespoons of fresh cilantro which really perks up the flavor.  Thanks for sharing, Louise.

This is delicious! I'm a little leary of what's in the seasoning packages, so I left them out of the dressing and substituted about a tablespoon of high quality soy sauce and a half teaspoon sesame oil.  I added some bean sprouts to the coleslaw as well. When I make this again, I may try it with romaine instead of coleslaw.

Awesome dressing as is made even better with a few alterations.  Used Oriental flavor ramen packet and only 1/4 brick of noodles.  Used rice wine vineger, about 4 tbsp in place of 1/3 c.  Used 2 tbsp white sugar in place of 1/2 c.  Squeezed in half a good sized juicy lime and plan on adding the zest next time around.  Grated in about 1 scant tsp of fresh ginger.  Made my own slaw mix with red cabbage, carrots, scallions, celery and cilantro.  Mounded marinated veg on top of a bed of crispy romaine and garnished with craisins and toasted sliced almonds.  Delicious!  Made a meal out of it with grilled sliced chicken breast and mexican rice it's what I had on hand).

great recipe...I recommend that you soak those ramen noodles because I did not and after 2 hours, some noodles were still crunchy. I used oriental ramen packets and I added in a bit of  roasted sesame oil for more flavor.  Yum!  I also threw in a handful of fresh cilantro. I reduced the sugar by half and added a bit of orange juice to the dressing.  Just devine!  Thanks Louise.

This a is family favorite.  Makes a lot.  Perfect when you don't want to use mayonnaise in hot weather.  It there's any left, it's wonderful the next day.  I made it exactly as listed, but I did soak my noodles and we like it that way.  There's plenty of crunch in the cole slaw mix and water chestnuts.

I made this for a party, found it lacking in flavor, added salt & pepper. That helped. Someone at the party said she makes it but does not soak the noodles. I will try that next time cause I love all the ing.

This was the first time I ever made a salad like this.  I followed the recipe exactly using toasted almonds instead of cashews, but I forgot to drain the mandarin oranges so there was about a half a can of juice in the recipe by mistake. I took this to a pot luck for a Karate Promotion for my son and I was nervous if anyone would like it. I was shocked. It was the first salad to go and people were going back for seconds. Thank you for your recipe it was a big hit for me since I wasnt sure what to make.

This was really good. Used almonds and sesame seeds rather than cashews and sunflower seeds. Used the oriental ramen, which was great. I made the night before and did not soak the noodles. I also crushed up the noodles first. Next time, I'll soak the noodles and I won't crush them - I think it will make for a prettier presentation. I also doubled the recipe, which I won't do again. I took this to a large picnic & there was still a ton left over. But I will definitely make this again!

Very different but very good.  I like the fact that you soak the noodles in water to soften them.  I've tried other recipes without soaking the noodles and I like this one better.  I used sliced almonds instead of cashews.

Although this salad has quite a few ingredients, it is easy to assemble.  I made it the night before with the exception of the cashews.  It was delicious and a welcome change from the normal variety of pasta and potato salads.  A definite keeper in my recipe collecion!!

This was a very different kind of recipe for me, but I was looking for cholesterol-free recipes so I gave it a try and was glad I did. I left out the oranges and most of sugar and it was still sweet but not too sweet. I loved it.

Great recipe!  Sometimes I won't even soften the top ramen noodles. I add them uncooked but broken up so they are crunchy. My kids love it this way even more. Sometimes I've added fresh minced garlic - 1 or 2 cloves to the vegetable oil to spice up the salad a bit more. Sometimes I add soy sauce with the rice vinegar and a tablespoon of peanut butter to make it more of a thai type salad. So easy to vary this recipe and it's always good!  You can even add chopped cooked leftover chicken and it makes a main dish.  During the winter I've added sliced red and green bell pepper to make it more holiday "ish".  Wow. I could go on and on. Try it! You'll like it!

This is soooo good.  As good as if not better than what the restaurants serve.  I used Rice Wine Vinegar, a zero calorie sugar, and 1/2 olive oil and 1/2 vegetable oil.  I added toasted sesame seeds when I was ready to eat it.

Delicious! I used oriental ramen noodles, which I did not soak. That allowed me to skip the cashews and still have plenty of "crunch" in the dish. It was the perfect potluck sidedish and so simple to make.

This was fantastic.  I only soaked the noodles for 5 minutes and left out the onions due to personal preferance.  I used oreintal flavored noodles as well.

This salad is really good.  Everyone in my family loves it!!!  I do use oriental ramen noodles and normally use pineapple instead of the mandarin oranges (just because I have those on hand more often).  I also don't soak the noodles at all, the time in the fridge before serving softens them just enough.  I have also added grilled chicken and pork to this and it is awesome.

Based on the previous reviews, I made a few alterations to this.  Basically, I made half the dressing for the full amount of salad.  It was just enough to coat the cabbage.  Everyone LOVED it!
I used 1 package of oriental flavored noodles, 1/4 cup veg oil, 1/4 cup sugar, and just under 1/4 cup of vinegar (rice wine and white wine mixed).

I added the dressing to the coleslaw, oranges, water chestnuts and scallions and refrigerated it for several hours.  Immediately before serving, I added the seeds, nuts and the crushed UNCOOKED noodles.  Delicious and crunchy!

Will certainly be making this again.

Absolutely fabulous. I used red cabbage and savoy cabbage instead of the packaged mix.  It turned out great.
Dinner party guests liked it so much they begged for the recipe.  Will definitely make this one again and again.

My husband was skeptical of this recipe when I made it, but now it's his favorite side dish!  It is quick and easy to make.  I only soak the noodles for about 5 minutes, and I used red wine vinegar instead of white wine vinegar.  Will definitely make over and over again!

I made a few adjustments.  I cut the oil in half and I only soaked the noodles for 5 minutes so they would be a little less soft than cooked Raman noodles.  I used apple cider vinegar because that is what I had on hand and I used olive oil to make it more health-friendly.  It was delicious! My kids loved it too!

This is my favorite coleslaw recipe now! I only had oriental flavored ramen noodles so I used it instead of the chicken and I also skipped soaking the noodles and left them crunchy. Very good!!

I didn't care for this and hubby just said it was ok. I made it for a BBQ and noone really ate it. One person was allergic to sunflower seeds so thank goodness I left those off, but still noone touched it. Very disappointed.

I have several versions of this recipe and this is my favoite.  Definitely a good idea to add dressing just before serving so the cashews don't get too soggy.  (However that certainly doesn't stop me from inhaling any leftovers!)  Made it once with almonds instead of cashews.  It was fine; but I think the cashews are the perfect complement (and I do love almonds in recipes).

I confess--after I finished this recipe, I taste-tasted beyond what is chef-like. I must have had twenty bites before I summoned the discipline to finally "say no" to another bite.  This is one of the best salads I've ever had.  It's perfect for a summer cookout.  No doubt, I will use this as a staple side dish when I'm looking for something wonderful and delicious.  Crunchy and sweet ... Asian like ... a recipe you won't soon forget.  I'm going to remember the liquid as a possible base for other side dishes, such as a bean salad.  Excellent, just excellent.

This was great. I used only half the ramen noodles, and that was plenty. Doubled the cashews for more crunch.

This is the best recipe I have found for Chinese Cole slaw.  I bring it to every party and BBQ & is always a hit.  I can practically eat the whole thing myself in several sittings.
Some people like chocolate...I love this vinegary cole slaw!!
You can change it up with using beef ramen instead of chicken.  I omit the water chestnuts & sometimes the mandarin oranges depending on if I want it sweetened up by the oranges.  Pour the dressing on just before serving so it won't get soggy.  You'll love it & if someone has never had a salad like this one, they'll ask you for the recipe!

Wonderful recipe Louise, thankyou so much.  I tested it out on company tonight.  I doubled the sauce and added some chow mein noodles, maybe 2 cups, also 1/2 cup of celery, and a shredded carrot, fresh sliced mushrooms,chopped brocolli, toasted almonds instead of the cashews and toasted sesame seeds, This recipe allows you to do add what you want, the oranges were so good in this.  Thanks again, I will be making this many more times.

this was fantastic !!! everytime i make it people rave about it - i dont soak the noodles because i like them crunchy, but i do mix the salad up and refrigerate it for 3-4 hours before serving - it is also good the next day, it any is left over, which is very rare. I dont use cashews, i use sliced almonds and sesame seeds and toast them for about 10 mins. in 325 degree oven before i add to the coleslaw. Last time i made it i added some plain, boiled shredded chicken and the oranges just before serving, there were no leftovers !!! everyone always raves about it and i am frequently asked to bring it to functions we go to. It really is a good, basic recipe - most definetely a keeper!!!! thank you Louise for sumitting it -

I take this to company potlucks and I have to double the recipe because everyone likes this one.  I don't mix the dressing in until I am ready to serve. I also don't put the nuts in until I am ready to serve because they tend to get soggy.  This is a very refreshing salad. One of my favorites.

This was soooo good!  My kids loved it and asked that I make it again soon.  I swapped toasted Almond slices for cashews, because that's what I had on hand.  Because of other's suggestions, I only soaked the noodles for 3 minutes to give them a "head start".  They were still firm, but pliable when added to the dish.  It turned out perfectly.

I used oriental flavored ramen instead of chicken, cut back on the amount of oil and left out the cashews. I also added some fresh snow peas. Loved it!

This is an excellent salad! You don't need to soak the noodles as long as it says...they get softer when they are added to the salad plus the dressing. The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly. The next time, I cut the seasoning package down a little to cut the sodium. It is worth trying!

My family loved this...had to write out the recipe three times before everyone left. I only soaked the noodles about 5 minutes as every said and they soaked up the dressing so it wasn't too wet or soggy and added the snow peas as others did. It was great!

Very easy and yummy.  I added cilantro and chopped snow peas per another reviewers suggestion.  I took the drained juice from the mandarins and added to the dressing mix in lieu of sugar.  I'm sure it was more liquidy this way but it wasn't bad and I didn't use ALL THAT sugar and made use of the mandarin syrup as well.

I loved this salad!  I don't think you need to use all of the dressing.  I used two bags of slaw and it was still too much dressing.  I used toasted sliced almonds and sesame seeds (toasted myself) in mine and it was a big hit.  They added a delicious flavor and crunch.

INCREDIBLY DELICIOUS.  I haven't even finished eating it and I had to login to rate it because this is the most delicious salad I've ever eaten.  I followed other people's suggestion to leave the noodles crunchy and used olive oil and Splenda to make it healthier.    UPDATE I make this all the time now because everyone loves it.  A few more helpful suggestions:  I add a handful of chopped cilantro and it adds a delicious flavor to it.  I've also sometimes added edamame for its wonderful source of low calorie protein.  Additionally, I now have substituted the cashews for dry roasted peanuts since they're less expensive and just as delicious.  I do think this salas is at its best while it's still very crunchy, so I usually don't add the dressing until I'm ready to serve it.

This is excellent.  As suggested I used oriental flavored noodles and did not have white wine vinegar so I used red wine vinegar.  It turned out great!!!!
I did not soak the noodles - I just broke them in small chunks and they turned out great.

I served this at a party and everyone loved it.  I agree with several other reviewers though that the serving size is way off.  I doubled the recipe and there was so much cole slaw.  The recipe is probably for about 12 people as is.  Everyone wanted the recipe though.  Thank you.

Very yummy! I didn't have the cashews so I used the toasted almonds. I also had a head of cabbage I wanted to use up so I shredded cabbage and carrots in the food processor instead of using the coleslaw mix. This recipe was great. We mill make this again for sure. Thank you!

this tastes so great and it is easy and can be very quick to make! One thing though it would be a good idea to make the dressing and keep it on the side and not to toss it with the salad because I did that and my leftovers were all soggy. So unless you want a soggy and sweet salad pour the dressing on as you go. Otherwise it really is one of the best salads I have ever tasted.

I was, initially, a bit leary of this salad.  When I had my husband read the recipe to see if it sounded delicious and appropriate for a caribbean themed summer party, he turned his nose up at it.  He doesn't like more than half of the ingredients.  Let me say, he had three helpings of this salad the day of the party.  As the word spread around the party that the salad was delicious, more and more people tried it and everyone loved it.  Such a wonderful flavor and so "summer friendly".

WOW! I love impressing friends with this one.  It's so easy and simple...I just hate disspelling the myth of difficulty by handing out the recipe.  This is one of my favorites, and it has become my signature salad over the summer.  People request the salad even if I am unable to attend the function...not sure how I feel about that.

I don't always have the cashews so I add peanuts instead.  My family loves it!

This is a great salad! I omitted the water chestnuts and added cilantro for personal preferences, but that's all I changed. The flavors are so great together! This is my new hot weather salad for lunch. One batch will last the week and it is SO filling! Thanks for the recipe!

It is always great, but I doubled the cabbage and halved the sugar.  There was still plenty of dressing and I love to have leftovers.

Really enjoyed this salad, I will be making it again; I did add a few extra's: bean sprouts, chopped bell pepper, chopped jalepeno (no seeds),snow peas and I used 1 chicken ramen noodle and 1 oriental ramen noodle.  I am looking forward to making it for a large crowd, I know it will be a hit.

Perfect side!  The textures were awesome with the crunchiness of the water chestnuts, nuts, and Ramen noodles.  The flavor was delightful with the treat of mandarin oranges.  I was afraid it was too much sugar, but it wasn't.  My family enjoys a lot of crunch, so I toasted almonds, cashews, and Ramen noodles in a skillet after marinating the slaw for a few hours.  (Keep a close eye on toasting, it will burn quickly) Just before serving, I mixed in the toasted mixture.  My pickiest eater even liked this salad.  For leftovers the next day, we thinly sliced last night's steak, melted some cheese, scooped on some of this salad, and rolled it all into a flour tortilla.  Yummy!

Made half the recipe following directions as stated.  Love to try new things, and this was a very different salad for lunch which was well received by all.    I served the sunflower seeds and cashews on the side for individual tastes.  Thank you for sharing, Louise.

This salad is the best asian type salad.  I have made many others in the past and didn't turn out as well as this one did.  The cashews and sunflower seeds make a nice combination with the dressing.  I didn't change a thing.  Took this to a forth of July picnic last week and there was none left.  Very tasty....thanks for the recipe!

Easy recipe.  Added chicken to it for a great summer meal and used broccoli slaw instead of coleslaw mix. I think in the future I will try cutting back on the oil.  My family enjoyed and have had good reviews at summer parties.

Loved it, but when I have had it before they didn't cook all of the noodles which gave it an extra crunch.  I would recommend that.

This is always a crowd pleaser!  It has become one of my go-to recipes and people always ask me to make it again. I normally leave out the water chesnuts and the oranges and the flavors are still great!

We really enjoyed this coleslaw.  I used a 2lb. bag of coleslaw, 2 oriental ramen noodle packages, 2 cans of mandarin oranges and kept the vinegar, sugar and oil measurements the same.  Also I added the ramen dry to the salad.  At first it seemed a little dry but it turned out delicious and it wasn't dripping with dressing, but just right.

I take the dry noodles and saute them in butter to keep them super crunchy and it is awesome.  Everyone always asks for the recipe.  I've added chicken/shrimp to make it more of a lunch or dinner entree, which is nice too.

Whenever I make this and take it somewhere someone has always asked for the recipe each time.  It is one of the best.  Also I have often bought a head of cabbage and made my own coleslaw, added grated carrots also.  Super!!! Just try it!  Another note-if you make a lot of this leave the nuts out put in bowls in front of salad with a spoon as left overs with mushie/soft nuts... not so great! Usually no left overs.

Fabulous salad.  This is the second time I have made it and both times everyone RAVED.  I used the Oriental flavored Ramen, which works perfectly.  I mixed the slaw with the dressing and put it in the frig for two hours.  Right before serving I mixed in everything else.  I did not soak the noodles.  The crunchiness is what makes it sooooo good!  I served it with sesame-crusted sashimi tuna.  Perfect combination.

Very good, light and refreshing!  I used the oriental noodles and it tasted great.  I don't think I'd soak them next time because I think I'd like the crunch factor, but it's still good.  Also, I used half the amount of Ramen noodles in order to cut down on fat & calories, and didn't miss the other package at all!

I left out the sugar because the fruit makes it sweet enough (white WINE vinegar is a must; don't use regular vinegar) and added cold, cooked chicken chunks for a substantial meal.  Very nice recipe.

I made a huge batch and I didn't add the oranges.  I found by adding less sugar and the oil (to taste) the salad stayed crunchy with the less dressing even a few days later.  Highly recommend.

Out of this world!! I couldn't believe how wonderfully this salad turned out. My boyfriend couldn't stop raving about it over dinner, and he continued to talk about it the next day! I omitted the sunflower seeds and cut the sugar down to 1/3 a cup. This salad is a must try!

I am known in my circle of friends to try new recipes on them when we have a gathering.  This salad was a definite hit!!  I made a few changes - such as using olive oil instead of veggie oil and I used a large can of mandarin oranges.  I only had sunflower seeds so I doubled them and left out the cashews and also did not soak the noodles.

I thought this recipe was fantastic! I made it for a church picnic and everyone loved it! Since it was hot outside it was refreshing to eat a sweet cold pasta salad!  I had multiple people asking me for the recipe including the minister of my church.  To anyone that makes this I suggest that you don't soak the noodles any longer than the 15 min.  I did and they were just a little too soft but that was my own fault.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it was a huge hit!!!

This is sooo fantastic. Loved the mandarin oranges and dressing mixed with the nuts. Such a great salad for summer. I brought it to a family bbq and it got rave reviews. 5 stars from all who had some.

this salad was fabulous! I served it for my "gourmet" book club - and they fought with each other to take home the leftovers! It's a perfect summer salad - and I added some diced chicken breast, and it became a complete meal. I will definitely be making this again.

4 stars only bc SOFT NOODLES?? No way! Toast the Ramen noodles and add to the salad dry at the end! Are you kidding me? It’s SO much better like that!

The salad turned out delicious I used one bag of coleslaw and one bag of broccoli slaw I also added some almonds. I used apple cider vinegar instead of white wine vinegar. I took it to a party and it was a huge hit

We have made this several times and it is a hot weather favorite.  The recipe should mention that you have to break the ramen noodles before you soak them or the salad ends of a tangled mess.  We usually add more cabbage and less noodles to make it a little healthier.  We also hold back on the sugar and use either sunflower seeds or cashews, but not both.  Solid recipe.

I make this at least twice a month, we LOVE it! I use the Trader Joes "Healthy 8 chopped veggie mix" and since my daughter has gluten sensitivities I toast sliced almonds and use them instead of the Ramen noodles (but I do use the seasoning packet from the Ramen packet). I only make half the amount of dressing and add it right before serving and then stir in the almonds last. Everything else I did the same.  This is a crunchy delicious salad.  It keeps best if you don't add the dressing and almonds until right before you serve it.

Loved this salad! I made it exactly as the recipe called for except for one thing. I bought a small shrimp cocktail the night before to let it thaw and added that shrimp to the salad. Excellent! Also, I used the Oriental flavoring ramen noodles. The dressing reminded me of the sesame dressing that Wendy's used to have with their Asian salad. I doubled the recipe and have enough left over for lunch the next day (minus the shrimp...lol).

Made today for Oriental night with Dinner Club. Got awesome raves,  friends took home leftovers. 
I only changed one thing, rice vinegar instead of white and left off nuts.
This goes in my recipe box! Thank you Louise.

I used Yakisoba noodles (same as ramen noodles but they were the only ones I had). and added a package of broccoli slaw for crunch.   Absolutely delish!  My family was very skeptical but everyone loved it.  I did NOT soak the noodles as I had about 4 hours before the party started and they softened perfectly.  Actually, the longer this salad sits the better it gets!!! A new go to for family parties.  (BTW..I omitted the cashews and used shaved almonds for crunch and they were great).

This was great. I toasted sliced almonds (did not use cashews) and noodles in oven and used apple cider vinegar instead of white wine vinegar (my preferrence).  Did not use mandarin oranges but will try that next time.  I only used 1/2 packet of chicken seasoning packet to cut down on sodium. This is a great quick easy side dish.

I love this salad. Just made a few changes- used shrimp flavor ramem, fresh chives, a touch of sesame oil and only cashews. I added the cashews and ramen just before serving so they stayed crunchy. Next time I'm going to try adding shrimp for a more substantial salad.

It's so good that we keep digging into it before it was fully marinated! I was looking for some kind of summer salad for my 15 year old son's birthday dinner and saw this recipe. He adores Ramen noodles so I thought that I would give it a try. Now I just have to keep him from sneaking anymore bites before the big dinner! I used white vinegar and stevia in place of sugar. It tastes wonderful and it has no funny after taste. I have a feeling that this will become a summer staple around my home. Next time I am going to try one pack withthe noodles wet and the other pack to use as dry noodles.

I love this salad!  I'm not a big fan of coleslaw, but this is so fresh and light tasting. It's delicious! I love that it is very quick and easy to make. We had it with BBQ chicken and mashed potatoes. My dad is diabetic so I used 1/3 cup Splenda instead of sugar. Also I didn't have sunflower seeds so I left those out but they would have made it even better! I mixed up the dressing and tossed with the bag of slaw about 2 hours before lunch, then added the ramen, oranges, chopped green onions, and cashews just before serving. Perfect texture!  The next day it was beginning to get a little soggy, but still yummy! Used leftovers to top grilled chicken sandwiches.

Delicious. Got lots of compliments on this salad when I made it for a cookout. Will definitely make again. I soaked the noodles for 5 min to separate, but next time will not soak at all for more 'crunch'.

My mother-in-law made this for a family dinner and it was DELISH!!!  She did not add the mandarin oranges or the cashews since she can't eat them, but everything else was added and it was GREAT!!  I had to beg for the recipe.  Everyone loved it.

This was really good- and fairly easy to put together. I used one chicken and one oriental ramen package, and soaked them for about 10 minutes. I also substituted slivered almonds for the sunflower seeds and cashews. I thought it was really great, my husband said he would eat it again, and my 5 year old wouldn't taste it more than once. I'll be adding some bite sized chicken to the leftovers to use as a lunch salad.

i made this for a party we were having and mother had asked me to bring to different dishes.  I went to the market to purchase the items for this salad, my local grocery store didn't have the white wine vinegar, so it some of the other similar recipes they used rice vingegar so that's what i used.  I was very disappointed with this salad especially because of all the good rating it got.  It just didn't even have a good flavor at all.  It was too vinergary.  does the white wine vinegar have a different taste that the rice vinegar.  If so how, sweeter, more bitter or what? Is cooking white wine the same as white wine vinegar?  Probally will not make again unless someone can answer my above questions and I can find the white wine vinegar.
