Yum! I didn't use any sugar, instead using 1/2 unsweetened applesauce plus the amount called for. I used Plain Greek yogurt since it's what I had on hand and I had to substitute chopped dried apricots for the raisins but I made no other changes. 
 The recipe is wonderfully moist and the dried fruit adds a nice bit of sweet.  This is a great no-sugar recipe to have on hand, thanks for posting it!
