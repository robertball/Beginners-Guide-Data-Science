Excellent cake. Would be best with a spiced cider. I added 1tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of ground cloves to the cake batter and 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp cloves to the glaze since my cider was plain.  
Heated the glaze before pouring half on the warm cake. After 10 min, I took the cake out of the pan and poured on the remaining glaze. (These were directions for a white wine cake I have made multiple times)

Very easy to put together and smells great, but I couldn't get it out of the pan! Was I supposed to let it cool before glazing it? I drizzled it while warm and let it sit 30 mins per directions, then inverted it to cool another 30 and couldn't get it out. When it finally released, half the top stayed in the pan. I pieced it back together and drizzled it with thicker glaze to hide the damage. Don't know that I'd make it again.

11.20.16 ~ A great cake that starts with a white cake mix.  I had a lot of apple cider on hand and decided to whip up this cake to share with my parents, in-laws, neighbors and co-workers.  Two people can't possibly eat an entire cake!  The results were a very good and moist cake.  I was worried after pouring the glaze on the cake if it would release from the greased/floured pan.  No problems, it flipped right out.  I did poke hole in the cake before pouring the glaze over it.  Delicious!  I would definitely make this one again.

The cake was moist and very tasty, but didn't taste much like cider. Maybe I needed to use a different kind of cider. I'll give it another try with a cider directly from one of our nearby cider mills and see if that makes a difference. Still very tasty and moist, but was looking for more of that cider taste to come through.

I just made this cake.   I used 1/2 cup of vegetable oil vs butter as another reviewer suggested.   I was disappointed because the whole top stuck to the pan and I made sure to grease it well based on other reviews.   I added cinnamon the mix too.  The flavor is good.  I am just not happy with the fact the top stuck and the actual cake looks horrible when it comes to presentation.    I doubt I will make this again :(
