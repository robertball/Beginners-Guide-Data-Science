This was really a great recipe for Brussels sprouts.  It's a great change from butter.  I did not have cashews, so I made it without the nuts.  I used frozen sprouts and steamed them for nine minutes.  I then cut them in half before adding to the sauce.  I love the balsamic in these.  I was afraid they'd be too sweet, but not at all.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Brussel Sprouts are in season...perfect time to try this! My hubby and I just recently have started eating them (and we are over 50!) and we tried another carmelized recipe from here and we are now hooked! So so good! These are a great variation of the other one. I changed it up regarding how I cook them and you might want to try this method as well! Steam the Brussels until tender but still crisp and set aside. Saute a sweet onion in the oil using the same skillet I steamed in on med-high to brown & carmelize the onions. Then add the sprouts and continue to saute adding the vinegar. When almost done & 'roasted looking' add the maple syrup, Dijon mustard & cashews if using them plus salt & pepper to taste!

My husband and I loved this recipe, even though we both do not care for brussel sprouts.  This recipe gets rid of most of the funky taste of the brussels sprouts.  My kids ate them too (2 and 4 years old), but had to coaxed to eat them.  This is an excellent recipe for those trying to find new ways to eat their veggies.  I did have to make a couple of alterations out of necessity.  I substituted toasted almonds for the cashews and had to substitute honey for half of the maple syrup.  While still good, I can't wait to try again with all the original ingredients.

If you don't care for brussels sprouts then take a pass on this. If you happen to really enjoy them then give this zingy recipe a try! I went a little heavy on the vinegar - we are vinegar freaks! Per usual, I omitted nuts. Delish!

This was not what I exptected. I love balamic but not on brussel sprouts. I used frozen sprouts and almonds. I couldnt make myself eat it. I felt it had a funky taste to it...if you like funky....make these.

Great brussels sprouts recipe.  I took one reviewer's suggestion and cooked the sprouts in the pan first with some olive oil and then added rest of the ingredients and some water so the sprouts wouldn't burn.  I added chopped almonds instead of cashews.  It tasted great!  Served with baked sweet potato on the side.

As a brussel sprout lover, I had a hard time eating these.  The maple syrup flavor overpowered the rest of the ingredients.

It's pretty good.  A bit too sweet for my taste, but would likely appeal to those who don't like sprouts.  But why you feedin' sprouts to them if they don't like `em?

Awful.  I followed this recipe exactly as written and I just didn't like the flavors.  The combination of balsamic and maple syrup didn't combine well on the sprouts.  I will not be making this recipe again.

Prepared as written, and entire non-brussels-sprouts-eating-family loved it. Perhaps not for "purists", but for a disparate group of picky eaters, very good.

My family (8 and 10 yr olds) loves brussels sprouts this way.  We have made it over and over again since this recipe was originally published in USA WEEKEND a few years ago.

Do not use frozen brussels sprouts for this recipe...it will be ruined.  This recipe is very nice, and compliments a holiday meal very well.

The vinegar is overpowering! I had to add a lot more mustard to even eat it. But I still didn't like it at all. I would never make this again.
