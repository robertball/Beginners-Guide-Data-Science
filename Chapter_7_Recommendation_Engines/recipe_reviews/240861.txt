I added apple sauce and I used coconut oil like another user suggested and they came out very pretty! I used walnuts instead of sunflower seeds. My favorite thing about this recipe is that it’s easy to make substitutions!

Tasteless and chewy. I’d suggest adding dates and double the agave nectar.

Good afternoon snack, without the guilt. Not really sweet, which is what I like. Will make again!
