I made this using the original recipe above and it was ok, but didn't think it was close to the seeduction bread at whole foods, so I experimented to get closer. The final product was nearly exactly like whole foods. The ingredients are the same, but I changed the measurements and made one substitution.  - 1 teaspoon of molasses NOT 2 tablespoons, the bread is way too dark with the original amount and made the crust a bit bitter. - Increase the honey to 4 tablespoons - Increase pumpkin, sunflower, and millet seeds to 4 tablespoons each - Increase the gluten to 2 tablespoons, this really firmed up the bread and made it less "cakey" - I also substituted the 3 tablespoons of malted barley flour with Bob's Red Mill 10 grain cereal.

This bread was AMAZING!  It tastes almost exactly like the Seeduction Bread at Whole Foods, just slightly denser.  I did, however, make a few changes to the recipe.  I used 2t. of yeast and no malted barley flour.  I needed a lot of more flour than the recipe asked for, so I used more whole wheat flour and the finished product was outstanding.  My clients absolutely loved it!

An absolutely stupendous bread previously available only at Whole Foods, I tried a trial loaf using the recommended ingredient measurement modifications and substitution recommended by "mhowell" above, and found the loaf to be an exact duplicate of the W.F. Seeduction. Having now made multiple loaves, I'm pleased at how much "bread" I'm saving in making this for my family. Thanks!

I love this bread. It is very hearty and has lots of grains...so if you don't like that sort of thing....you probably won't like this bread. I've never used barley flour, as just couldn't be bothered searching the city for it! However still turns out well. Often I use the recipe to make two small loaves, as we don't go through bread quickly, seems to still work fine. Obviously reduce cooking time when making two small loaves.

Update: re. malted barley flour, do not use Bob's Red Mill malted barley flour (found on Amazon). It will make your loaf gooey. We tried it several different times. Now we just stick with regular barley flour until we can try a new brand of malted. We also follow mhowell's advice by lowering the molasses, increasing the honey, and increasing the seeds. Overall, incredible recipe. Truly the best bread we've ever had, either homemade or store bought. We now make it all the time, in our bread machine. Our girls ask for it continually. It's more preferred in our family than even the homemade French or Italian breads--and there's nothing like it we can buy anywhere.   It's rich and nutty but also light and elastic, slightly sweet. We love it with honey butter or cinnamon butter or cream cheese. It's so filling, soothing, and satisfying, and we love that it's complete protein--excellent value for the cost. Also, it feels good in the tummy and will sooth a sour stomach, which we thought was amazing until we read that millet seed does just that (sooths the stomach). Great way to feel good in the morning and start the day. Thank you, thank you for this recipe. It's a staple.

My whole family loves this bread.  I did make a few changes when I made it as I didn't have things like wheat gluten or millet seeds and I omitted the honey and put in malt extract along with barley flour.  In the end, it turned out very moist and light, not quite as dense and sweet as the one from WF.

This recipe is wonderful! I followed the mhowell modifications except without the malted barley flour or wheat gluten. I also replaces the molasses with brown sugar instead. The bread came out a little denser and more moist than the WF version, and also a little less buttery. Still, delicious! My family had it with cream cheese, strawberry jam, orange marmalade, or even plain, and everyone was delighted. Love it!

This bread is incredible. So worth the time and effort, which is minimal considering the end product. It is so full of flavor I actually prefer to eat it with nothing on it.

I tried the original recipe and the modified recipe and I have to say that I like the original recipe best. My kids do, too.. We like the molasses flavor and the crust isn't bitter. I also like that there isn't an additional tablespoon of honey that the net total of the modified recipe has.  So, be sure to try the original recipe---you may prefer it.

I modified this slightly for a bread machine because I am lazy, and it is still our family's favourite bread recipe. Highly recommended!

Just made this recipe.  It is delicious.  I substituted Hard White Wheat Flour for the All Purpose Flour and used Hard Red Wheat Flour for the whole wheat flour.  I didn't have the malted barley flour..used barley flour instead.  Next time I will use the malted barley flour...just ordered from Amazon.  I think it will rise a little more with the malted barley flour. This is a keeper! Thanks.

I don't know anything about WF breads, but this recipe made a delicious loaf of bread. I used whatever  seeds I have available in my pantry ( sesame, sunflower, poppy and nigella seeds) I didn't have any malted barley flour or wheat gluten, so I omitted them. The issue with this  recipe for me was the recommended  baking time and temperature ! At 375, my loaf over browned in 20 minutes ! And that short baking time didn't allow the crust to crisp up at all ! I plan to make this recipe again and bake at a lower temperature, for a longer time.

My husband and I love this bread!  I made this based on what was in my pantry.  I substituted brown sugar for molasses and I left out the gluten, millet and barley flour because I didn't have them.  It turned out so good that we ate the entire loaf in 2 days!

I could not find any malted barley flour, so I just left it out.  I also had to adjust the recipe to about 2 C of flour because I made the dough in my breadmaker which has a little over a 2 C capacity.  Then I turned it out on a pizza stone to bake it.  The bread was delicious.  All the dinner guests loved it and wanted the last few pieces so nothing was left.  i would definitely make it again.
