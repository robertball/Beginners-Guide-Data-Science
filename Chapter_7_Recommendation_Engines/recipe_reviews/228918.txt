One of the best things about this recipe is no long marinade time.  I'd recommend that you mix your herbs with your oil and then pour into the chicken bag.  I found dumping the herbs into the bag already holding the oiled breasts resulted in the herbs mostly sticking to one piece. I then had to get my hands into the bag to spread it around to get even herb distribution, a mess that could have been avoided.  But in spite of this and most importantly, we liked this recipe.

Very good recipe and despite not having a grill I went ahead and did this recipe in a 350 oven for 30 mins. I mixed all the ingredients in a pie pan, coated the chicken breasts on both sides easily and then just left them in the pan to bake. Loved it!

This is a great tasting recipe. I don't have an outdoor grill, but I do have a flat grill. That's what I used and the chicken looked like I had grilled it outside. I would recommened mixing all of the spices, except the garlic; together first. Also, I crushed the maryrose seasoning. I did the oil and chicken in the bag, but found it difficult to mix the seasoning in the bag with the chicken. So, I poured it all into a bowl and mixed it by hand, along with the garlic.

College Guys, Take Note:

This recipe is simple, inexpensive, and delicious. So far I've made it for a couple different people, and always gotten positive reviews at the end of the night. Not to mention that I find the recipe delectable. I did, however, add a little more rosemary than the recipe calls for, but just because I really like rosemary. I don't mean to sound too coarse or vulgar, but guys, make this simple, delicious dish when you have company (dates); it impresses guests in all the right ways.

This was fast, simple, and even wowed my husband who is picky about herbs and spices especially with meat. He enjoyed this very much and I will definitely be fixing this again this summer.

Very good recipe! I'm a vegetarian for my entire life, but I wanted to cook chicken for my boyfriend, and this recipe was so so easy. I mixed the marinade in a bowl first though, also adding lemon juice from a fresh lemon, then just flipped the chicken over several times in that bowl to get an even coating. Also let it sit for about a half hour. Then I grilled the chicken breasts on an outdoor propane grill. He gave it five stars himself! If someone who has never cooked or eaten meat before can use this recipe and make great grilled chicken, anyone can!

This is a very good recipe!  I cooked mine on a George Foreman grill.  It was moist and tender.  Served this with homemade BBQ sauce (used the Bar-B-Que Sauce recipe from this site).  Didn't need to make any changes.  Good as is!

OMG, this was fantastic!!!  So tender and juicy.  The only thing I did differently was to bake it in the oven at 350 for about 25-30 min.  It was so tender and juicy.  I did have the problem of the herbs not distributing evenly.  I just added a touch more olive oil to help spread the herbs better.  Next time I might use fresh lemon juice instead of the extra oil.  Really delicious.

I made this for my husbands work picnic for a cook off and I won! Everyone LOVED it! My husband wants me to make it again too. I cut the chicken almost in half and then mixed all the ingredients together in a bowl and then poured it all over the chicken. (I only cooked 12 of them but I redid the amount to 24 pieces and it worked out great) Then we put it in the fridge over night uncovered to let it soak in. Then we didn't cook it the next day tell about 12pm. It was so juicy and good!!! I will be making it again!!!

I followed the recipe except I baked it at 400 for 30 minutes (too cold to grill).  The flavors were good and the chicken was moist.  I will probably add a bit more garlic next time.  Overall, a solid recipe to add to your mix.

Really easy to do since all the ingredients were already in my pantry.  Huge plus is that the chicken doesn't need to be marinated.  Grilled for 10 minutes total.  Turned out juicy and tasty!  Thanks for sharing!

Really good.  I'll be using this one again in the future.  I'd recommend adding all the ingredients except olive oil in 1.5x the amount.  It'll really help coat all the chicken well.

This chicken is AMAZING! I mixed the herbs with the oil before putting it into the bag (great tip) and grilled it on a George foreman. The strong peppery flavor is delicious and the chicken turns out so tender and juicy. Served with seasoned rice (another recipe) it is perfect! This is a quick and easy dish I am definitely making again.

So simple and no marinating time! Absolutely deliciously seasoned and moist chicken every time. I mix the oil and herbs in the bag first as a previous reviewer mentioned to more evenly coat the chicken. Enjoy!

Delicious!  I needed a recipe that didn't need a long marinating time - I found this and it was awesome!  The only changes I made were adding a splash of rice wine vinegar and doubling the garlic because we love it :). I seared it on a super hot grill and with about 5 minutes per side plus 5 minutes to rest, I had juicy, succulent chicken with picture perfect grill marks.  I am looking forward to making this again :)

Delicious!  Recommend with the penne mushroom pasta.  Also, take the other's advice:  mix your herbs with your oil and then mix with the chicken.  I didn't read the reviews the first time and quickly realized the error.

This is so good! My family wanted something different than just store bought marinades. I'm glad I found this one....it's a keeper for sure! I did like another reviewer suggested and combined all the herbs together with the oil first, then poured it over the chicken. It worked well, and came out tasting really good!!!

Loved this marinade, I added a 1/2 tsp. of dried basil, and a couple of dashes of red pepper flakes...it was amazing!  Next time I would like to try this with fresh seasonings!

Instead of grilling, I cut the chicken breasts into strips and sautéed them. After they were golden brown on one side, I turned them over, lowered the heat and covered the pan to let them simmer in their own juices. When the chicken was done I reduced the broth a bit with the lid off and then thickened it with some cornstarch dissolved in a little water. Everything came out moist and tasty!

This was a good, simple, and healthy chicken recipe.  It would be even better on the grill, but because of the weather I baked this in the oven at 375 for 35 minutes.  The chicken was moist and flavorful.

This was a tasty mixture. Next time I will grind the dry herbs or use fresh; too many large pieces of them on the chicken for our liking. The flavor was great, and I think leaving the chicken in the mixture for longer would have brought more flavor throughout.  Definitely yummy!

I’ve been making this recipe almost weekly for months and I really felt to write a 5 star review because my husband and I enjoy it so much. I just use the ingredients listed except the oil,  and I use thighs and put it in a greased baking dish and covered on 400* for an hour and it’s perfect every time. Really felt like I owed this recipe a good review since we make it so often. Thank you!

Pretty good recipe! Very easy to make and overall delicious! Chicken breasts were moist and tender. Made as written, except for a slight modification in the directions. I always put the herbs/seasoning in first and shake bag. Then, add oil and shake again, and rub to ensure seasonings are well distributed. I liked the flavors of this grilled chicken, especially sliced on top of a garden salad. I felt the flavor was a little too strong with Rosemary, and will reduce it slightly in the future. I think the addition of a little lemon juice would be wonderful for this chicken. Will be making this again! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I've been using this recipe for years, and it's absolutely amazing! I normally just make a large batch of the spice rub, (leaving the fresh garlic out). Just put chicken in a zip lock bag, add the fresh garlic, olive oil and spice rub, and allow to marinate for a few hours or overnight. I also add 1 tbsp of salt and crushed red peppers, (because I luv everything HOT). Great grilled chicken sandwiches... On the grill or baked. After trying this recipe, you'll never have to go to your local fast-food restaurant again!

Loved this! Tasty, easy and no marinating. Chicken was still juicy. I used fresh herbs instead. I'll definitely be making this again.

Excellent.  I made it according to the recipe with slightly more oil as my chicken breasts were huge.  Made extra for left overs for tomorrow.  My company gobbled it up, (especially the picky eater) and not a piece left. Great recipe with subtle, delicious flavour.

I made it but used all fresh herbs from my herb garden.  I added purple basil and tarragon.  I 'marinated' the chicken for about two hours before grilling.  With curried balsamic grilled cauliflower.....Take Me Outta Here, It was GREAT!!

The recipe seemed to be a smorgasbord of herbs with no real flavor goal in mind. For this reason, my husband and I found it to be only average.

Loved the herbs used, but next time I will cut my chicken breast into smaller pieces so all the meat is flavored. I had large chicken breasts and the inside didn't have the great herb flavor. Will maybe double the recipe, too

It was a beautiful Spring day here with a high temp in the low 80s, so we decided to grill.  I used this recipe for two large, skinless, bone-in chicken breasts.  I made the full amount of the olive oil/seasoning mixture, using fresh rosemary instead of dried.  I smeared it on both sides of the chicken in a shallow baking dish and refrigerated it until it was time to grill.  The oil made the grill flare up, so next time I’ll just coat the chicken lightly with oil and sprinkle on the seasonings.  Perhaps because I used bone-in chicken the outside became very crusty, too crusty, due to the longer cooking time.  Next time I will use boneless skinless chicken breasts, as directed.  The flavor of the herbs was very good, so this is worth trying again.

Made this in a pinch and couldn't believe how flavorful it was. Used a grill pan inside because I didn't feel like dealing with the outdoor grill and it was fantastic. I've made this a few times and now my sons ask for it, so obviously it's a hit! Easy and delicious!

Another reviewer said to mix the oil and spices before coating the chicken, and I will definitely do that next time, as most of the mixture ended up sticking to one piece. We had this with Mac n cheese and steamed broccoli, but my husband said this chicken would be better with a vinaigrette salad. I used a foreman grill, which worked out great.

Very moist, perfect flavor.  I baked this instead of grilled following other recommendations.  I served it with garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus sautéed in lemon zest.

Grilled Chicken & Herbs Haiku: "I liked this okay. Maybe better w/ fresh herbs. Still, I'm glad I tried!" I felt like each bite of my chicken resulted in pieces of dried herb getting stuck b/t my teeth. It smelled great while grilling, and I liked that it wasn't a dark soy-based marinade, but I felt like it could've benefited greatly from a punch of citrus, or cayenne, along w/ fresh herbs. I did enjoy eating it as part of my light salad lunch!

This recipe was delicious! I used the chicken for my lunch salads and on a pizza.  I would recommend putting all your spices/herbs/garlic in the zip lock baggie with the olive oil before putting your chicken in the bag.  By doing this you will distribute all the flavors more evenly!  I don't have a grill, but I make then instead on a griddle and it worked fine! recommend this recipe.

Made it as instructed in the recipe but was a little disappointed.  Needed something to make it moist.  I made a tomato, zucchini and onion casserole which we added on top of the chicken and improved it.

Loved this mix of herbs! Mixed herbs separately then topped chicken and cooked in pie pan on 350 for 30-35 min.

This was edible but not great.  I followed the recipe exactly as it was written- too much thyme I think. I won't make this again.

This recipe was awesome.  I agree with some of the others that it would be best to mix the herbs with the olive oil for a more even distribution.  We loved it.  Thank you

After awhile, I wonder if there's any "new" way to fix chicken that will be awesome.  We tried this one, and all Hubby and I could do was talk around mouthfulls of chicken, saying stuff like, "OMG..."  This was so good.  So fast.  No marinating for a couple hours (or overnight - which I rarely plan ahead that far).  We were drooling as the chicken was grilling because it smelled that amazing.  So either we are very easy people to please (possibly), or the recipe is really that great (it is).  You really MUST TRY THIS!  P.S. The nest is empty so with just the two of us, we used ye' ole' G-Foreman grill.  Not worth heating up the outside grill for the 2 of us.  Except that, knowing how good it is, I wish we'd done up several chickens, and saved extras.

How easy is this?  I cut the breasts in medallions, pounding them slightly so they would all be the same size thickness.  I find this a quick and easy method to grill chicken breasts.  Also, I always use the honey brine method by Chef John which adds flavor and keeps the chicken breasts from drying out during grilling.  This was a tasty, hassle free recipe.

Loved it, so did the family.  Very simple but full of flavor. We will be keeping this one to use over and over.
