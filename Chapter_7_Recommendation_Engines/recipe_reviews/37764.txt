This was a great way to add flavor to coffee. I drink my coffee black so it was too sugary for me and I will try it with just the cinnamon next time.

This is great!  I used cinnamon/hazelnut coffee that I blended myself at my local grocery store and the extra cinnamon enhanced the flavor.  Thanks Kraft.

Oooooooh, I really enjoyed this one.  It was such a nice change from the regular old cream &  sugar!  Make sure to stir the cinnamon into the coffee granules.  Thanks K-R-A-F-T!!

I used to be a big coffee drinker before the caffeine started making me totally crazy, so I haven't had "real coffee" in years. Decaf just doesn't taste the same, so I gave that up too. It was nice to find a simple recipe that would perk (no pun intended) my interest again for decaf. I eliminated the sugar step as I never used it anyway. Obviously, I'm not as "coffee savy" as most of the reviewers because I thought this was unique and really good. Topped with some fat free "Cool Whip" and a sprinkling of cinnamon, I felt as though I was having dessert.

This was okay, but don't know what all the noise is about.  I've been doctoring my coffee cup with these type of ingredients for years.  Other ideas:  you can buy hazelnut and other flavored syrups at the grocery store in the coffee section.  Also try: pumpkin pie or nutmeg spices, chocolate powder.  Sugar to taste.  Save yourself some $$ and do it yourself.

I've made this before using a slightly different method, and had never paid much attention to proportions...which sometimes resulted in the cinammon taste being SO strong, that the coffee was bitter.  Thanks for figuring out the proportions for me...it was perfect!

A unique late afternoon pick-me-up! A nice change of pace from the creamy drinks from starbucks, and something you can make at home inexpensively. I cut the sugar by 1T, then it was perfect. My husband the coffee purist, who only drinks Americanos, loved this one! Thanks Kraft.

This was ok, but why not just brew your coffee, add whatever sugar you want and add cinnamon and stir? It is really fun to add whipped cream on top and sprinkle additional cinnamon on top of that. I also like to garnish with a cinnamon stick.

Wow this was really good, just a tiny bit too sweet for me will decrease sugar by a smidge next time.

I used brown sugar and was amazed how good this was. The flavor is comparable to the coffeehouses at a fraction of the price! Give it a try you will not be disappointed. It's simply delicious.

I was a bit skeptical about this one.  I am what you'd call a coffee purist.  I like coffee and I love cinanamon, mixing them seemed at first, not a good idea, but boy, was I wrong!  This coffee is so tasty! I cut the ingredients down as I was just making it for myself and it still came out excellent! Now I have to go find a recipe for a dessert that would go with it!

Very Yummy! I recommend using the brown sugar though. Even DARK brown sugar is great! We added a little more sugar though, almost 1/3 cup packed brown sugar. After adding cream/milk it tasted close to our favorite coffee mix we purchase for ALOT more than what this costs to make! I would give it 6 stars if I could! Thank you KRAFT!!!

Great coffee for those cold, wet, depressingly yucky days (like today). I've had this coffee before but had forgotten about it until I stumbled across the recipe on here. I sweeten with sugar to my taste.

Just made this a.m.!  Very good dessert or weekend coffee.  I used brown sugar.  Next time, I will cut back on 1/4 brown sugar, a bit sweet for our taste, but delicious!  Very tasty with a little Bailey's added into the cup.  Thanks KRAFT.

We have a tradition here of making a pot of the specialty flavored coffees every Sunday morning.  One morning I brewed a pot of this instead and didn't tell my husband.  When he drank it he immediately said this was the best cinnamon coffee he'd had, and wanted to know which brand/coffeehouse it was.  Needless to say, we'll be making this one often!

What a good idea! Using one of those one-cup coffee makers, I used a heaping tbsp of coffee (a different brand, I'll admit), 1/8 tsp of cinnamon, a cup of cold water in the reservoir, and I sprinkled some free-flowing brown sugar at the bottom of the mug. I stirred in a bit of milk once it had brewed, and it was perfect! The cinnamon / coffee aroma is mouth-watering!

Hubs and I  prefer just a regular ol' cup of "joe" with cream,  but occasionally we'll treat ourselves to a specialty coffee when we're out.  I recently bought some coffee I wasn't crazy about so I thought it might be fun and interesting to try to make good use of it by disguising it with this recipe.  I brewed it with brown sugar and we both added cream.  It was pretty good!   Since I drink my coffee with no sugar it was a little sweet for me but fine for hubs, and we both enjoyed the hint of cinnamon. This won't replace our basic coffee but it sure will help rescue a pound of coffee I don't care for.  The aroma when it's brewing is wonderful too, something you won't achieve by just stirring in cinnamon and sugar  once it's brewed!

Absolutely love this recipe.  I took the advise of others and made it with the brown sugar.  Perfect for me, my husband added a bit more sugar to his.  This is a keeper....

Very nice way to start the morning.
