The only changes I made, is that I added a little bit more of everything because I had 2 pound skirt steak.  It was quite simply the best marinade I ever put on steak!..  I am going to try this weekend on some pork ribs.

instead of sesame oil I used a vegetable oil substitute, it turned out just fine. The grilling directions are a little "iffy." If you know your grill, just realize it's a thin cut and may need more attention in order to keep it relatively rare.

Wow! Thanks to Chef John I’ve grilled 2 skirt steaks now. This recipe is AMAZING! It has a teriyaki vibe to it but the hoisin adds great sweetness and funk. My wife said it was exquisite! Definitely will make this again.

Wonderful!  We used flank steak and marinated it for a few hours.  I'm looking forward to trying this again, maybe with chicken next time.  I'm not sure about the effort comments, we found it to be effortless and SO worth what little time was needed.

This is the second recipe I have made from Chef John (the other was his Italian meatballs) and the second winner! I used steak tips instead of skirt steak and added another tablespoon of Hoisin sauce. Other than that I follow his recipe to a T. Wonderful sweet flavor rivaling anything I have had in a restaurant. The leftovers were even better.

Big hit with my men. I used 3 lbs of skirt steak and had plenty of marinade. This will be a good go to recipe.

AH.MAY.ZING. I made the recipe, as stated, letting the steak marinate in a ziplock bag for about  4 hours.  Then, because  I don't have a grill (shame on me), I stuck it in the broiler and cooked it for 4 minutes on 1 side, flipped the pieces over, and then cooked for 3 minutes on the other side. It was easy and spectacular, plus my picky 12-year old son even told me I'd "outdone myself."  That's what I call a winner. 

Note: I served it with coconut ginger rice and a spinach salad.  Yummy!

Fantastic recipe, as is. The only changes I made were to double the amount because I had to lb of skirt steak and I put the steak and the marinade in a ziplock bag and refrigerated it for 5 hours. Will definitely be making again.

Only change I made was using a different oil. It's only because I hate the smell of sesame oil.  Great recipe!

I made the marinade exactly and let it marinade for about 6 hours. The flavor was wonderful! Skirt steak is definitely the way to go, it has some chew but really absorbs the flavor. I didn't have a grill (apartment life bans these) so I used my broiler. 6 min one side, 3 min the other. Came out medium and juicy! If using a broiler,I would recommend adding more of the marinade to the meat after flipping because the carmalization on it is AMAZING.

Made this tonight for supper  following the recipe completely except for marinating only 2 hours. The taste was delicious but the meat was TOUGH and very hard to chew even though it was fairly rare inside. If I try this again, I will marinate over night and/or get the meat from another supplier. j david

I feel like the marinade didn’t penetrate the meat as much as I would have liked it to. I love hoisin sauce but felt like something was missing in this recipe like fish sauce. My family didn’t care for it either.

Well, i was really looking forward to this marinade tasting delish, but i was soooo disappointed. I don't know if it was that all the flavors didn't mesh - because the ingredients are fantastic - but it tasted awful. I followed the recipe to a T with one small exception - i used chardonnay vinegar because i only had sherry wine (and the wine is not a sub for vinegar), but I can't imagine the chardonnay vinegar would've altered the flavor of the marinade that much because of how much hoisin it calls for. I'm a huge fan of Chef John's recipes but this marinade just didn't cut it for me and was a no go for my family as well.

This was quite tasty. First time I followed recipe exactly and everyone enjoyed it but we like a little more heat so second time around I omitted the brown sugar and added crushed red pepper flakes, about a tablespoon and a half cup of mango habanero wing sauce. That did the trick. Not hot enough to blister your mouth but a nice tang.

use less sesame oil - also has a sweet hoisin flavor  -  used ribeye and it might have made it a little tender

Absolutely the best marinade for this steak I have tried. Johns directions were precise during the grilling period. I did bring my temp probe just to make sure. Needles to say everyone went back for seconds which means no left overs for me

So skirt steak is not available here in Vancouver that I can find. The closest available substitute that I could find is flank. Same area of the cow, same marinade to tenderize procedure required.  I usually marinade flank steak for grilling to use in fajitas but thought I'd try this along side of Chef John's Classic Rice Pilaf which I love and some pan fried asparagus. I followed the recipe exactly! Marinaded overnight, did everything exactly the way the recipe instructs.  It was tough.  Tasty but tough.  Not sure why. Usually flank steak is nice and tender after marinading but this was just tough.  I'll probably try again. Perhaps this was just a bad cut.  Like I said, nice and tasty but hard to chew.
