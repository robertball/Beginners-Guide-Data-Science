Didn't change one thing with this recipe. I dressed it lightly and left it overnight in the fridge. Delicious

Had a craving for this tonight but couldn't find fresh corn so I used two cans of Del Monte whole kernel corn and it was still delicious.

I made this salad for the first time for a party and had 5 people tell me it was absolutely the best corn salad they've ever had.  I was out of mayo that day and substituted Ranch dressing for the mayo.  Other that that it was perfect the way the menu read.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  Will be a definite keeper.

Very good!  I used summer corn on the cob left over from a picnic.  Couldn't stop tasting it!  Will definitely make it again.

Cheese adds a little bit of dimension, delicious!!!  I also skipped the step where the corn was boiled with sugar and just used salted water.

I used frozen corn, which I didnâ€™t bother to thaw ahead of time. I forgot that it needed time to chill, so I only chilled it for about 4 hours. Long enough for the corn to thaw, and it still tasted great!
