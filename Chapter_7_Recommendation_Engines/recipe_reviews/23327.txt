I used chicken instead of turkey.  Tonight I'm going to make it with boneless, skinless breast.  The taste was FANTASTIC!

This recipe was quite good.  The whole family enjoyed it.  The tenderloins I had were far to thin to cut and insert the sugar mixture into, so I found a lazy way to prepare it.  Also, having no pirates in the house, we were out of rum -- so I used white wine.  I just cooked the tenderloins in the broth and strained the broth.  I then brought the broth to a boil and added the cornstarch.  I then blended the remaining ingredients and poured them in with the broth. I then returned sliced pieces of cooked tenderloin to the skillet and covered and cooked slowly until the sauce was nice and thick.

This was very tasty.  My one mistake was in using some frozen tenderloins rather than fresh--they end up being a bit dry.  I also would have liked a bit of spice in this to help cut the sweetness...I'll have to experiment with this.  My husband and I really enjoyed this, however, and were taken back a bit to our honeymoon in Jamaica.

This was just okay for me. I didn't think it was all that tasty - kind of bland.

It was ok...I think the cloves kinda overpowered the taste of the turkey.  It probably didn't help that I left it marinating for two days.  We may try it again.

This is tricky the first time a little dry, use more stock if you need to.  The end result is worth it, a good one to try.
