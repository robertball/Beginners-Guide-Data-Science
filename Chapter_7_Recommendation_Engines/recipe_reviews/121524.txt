What a refreshing change of pace!  These meatballs are tangy, sticky, and delicious.  Will definately make this recipe again.

I don't use this recipe to make meatballs, but to make meatloaf, hehe. I just follow the instructions, but instead of forming into meatballs I put it all in a pyrex dish & bake until done.  This is a family favorite around here!

Fantastic.  I put parchment paper on the bottom of the pan, and that really minimized the clean-up.  This recipe was delicious.

I have been making this recipe for years and before that my Mother made it for me when I was a little girl. It is and has always been one of my favorites. 

The only thing I do differently is add about a 1/4 cup of brown sugar to the sauce.  Also sometimes I will use ritz crackers instead of corn flakes but I think I like the corn flakes better.

***update****
to make these healthier use ground turkey instead of beef (can't tell the difference!!) and grapenuts or oatmeal instead of cornflakes!!

These are very delicious.  The meatballs themselves were very tasty and the sauce was so easy and fast.  I mixed 1 lb lean beef and 1 lb veal.  Came out perfectly as directed.  Thanks.

These were very good. I like the use of corn flakes. My husband who does not  eat meatballs tried one and said they were "edible"!

This is SO good!  No meatball recipe that I've tried has come close to being as good as my mom's, but these meatballs are very good.  Nice to have 2 options for meatballs since Mom's recipe includes 1 1/2 C parmesan cheese and would be a bit odd in a recipe with this kind of sauce.  Speaking of the sauce, it too is wonderful.  I've made basically the same recipe with grape jelly instead of cranberry sauce and we like the cranberry sauce based one better.  Tip: use a potato masher to mash up the cranberry sauce, things will go much faster that way!
