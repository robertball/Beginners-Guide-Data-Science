Exactly what I was looking for!  I was trying to recreate a chop salad I had at a local restaurant and this did the trick! I used it to top chopped romaine, chopped avacdo, chopped tomatoes, crumbled bacon and gorgonzola cheese. Makes a rich and elegant looking salad - would be great for company. Thanks!

Hubs grimaced when I told him the salad dressing had avocado in it.  I should have just kept my mouth shut because he would have never known the difference. But even knowing that the terrible avocado was in it, he still admitted he really liked it.  And then he remarked (ha!), “I like to try new things.” Of course he liked it, it was delicious! The avocado gives it richness and a beautiful hint of green color, but it does not contribute much flavor.  I followed the recipe but used fresh parsley and dill. This is simply a lovely, fresh dressing with a simple elegance.

I followed recipe exactly except I used dried buttermilk powder and Miracle Whip instead of mayo.  This is a really delicious recipe for vegetable dip.  I also added milk to thin it down for salad dressing.  Excellent recipe!

Good. I used lowfat mayo and light sour cream, plus one fresh garlic clove instead of the powder. Tasty and light. I'll bet the full-fat version is insanely delicious, but it's tasty light too.

Definitely a great recipe! I made this as a spread for a Turkey/Swiss sandwich tray. Got great reviews at a shower. I made it Saturday, and it tasted even better Sunday night. The flavors had more time to meld, I guess. I don't know how long the dip will stay good, but it's definitely something you can make the night before. It was more of a spread/dip consistency, as is. But I'm sure thinning it with buttermilk would make a fantastic dressing. It tasted so fresh, I might keep making this instead of buying bottles! I'm going to try the light version next time.

Delicious!  I omitted the dill since I was out but otherwise, made as directed.  The flavor was reminiscent of cucumber.  Will try adding a garlic clove next time since you can never have too much garlic!

This was a very good recipe.  Very much like a guacamole on steriods.  I used fresh garlic instead of powder and added chives instead of parsley.  I think dried parsley has very little flavor, if I had fresh I would've used it.

I didn't have buttermilk so substitued regular nonfat milk.  We liked this.  I'm sure it's better with the buttermilk.  I did add more onion powder, dill, and garlic powder than called for, and still thought something might be missing?  Could just be the buttermilk :)

We really liked this dressing!  I'll definitely be making it again.  We were fortunate to have home-grown Reed avocados from our friends' orchard on hand.  They are extra buttery-tasting and have a wonderful texture.  After blending the ingredients, I did thin it down just a bit for dressing.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This dressing was pretty good as is, but then I added some fresh cilantro and some lime, which put it over the top.

Also, I used buttermilk instead of sour cream (just because I had a lot of buttermilk that needed to be used up).

I was so excited to try this as I was making southwestern eggrolls and thought this would be perfect to go along with them. There was just something about it that I didn't like. I love avocados, but the taste just seemed to be so overpowering you couldn't taste anything else. There was no ranch taste at all so I ended up mixing in a packet of hidden valley buttermilk ranch and that helped it a lot, but it was just too thick and didn't have the taste I was looking for.

I made this exactly as stated, and it was awesome!  Great with dipped veggies, and the southwestern style egg rolls!  Will keep in my collection.  My husband, who despises avocado, even enjoyed it.

I love love love LOVE this recipe - not as a salad dressing, but more as a sauce/dip mix.  I added a pinch of cumin as we were having tacos that nite, and those tacos, made with Charley's Mexican Meat, and topped with this and pico de gallo were simply to DIE for.  Lovely subtle avocado taste that was the perfect contast to an otherwise spicy meal.   Great as a dip with veggies and tortilla chips - this is def a keeper.   Oh!  Just a quick note - the first time I made this, I was out of sour cream and used all mayo.  Let me tell you, after one taste, my daughter and I both looked at one another and said "deviled eggs".  We tried it as a filling for hard boiled eggs and they were devoured in a matter of minutes...great job and ty so much for recipe :)

Great dressing!  I used fresh parsley instead of dried and the flavor of this perfectly matched the chili lime chicken salad it was mixed with.

Delicious .... so good you'll be tempted to eat it out of the bowl with a spoon!  Tried it as specified (except subbed milk for buttermilk because I didn't have any) and thought it was fresh tasting and yummy; added lime juice and fresh cilantro as suggested in another review and liked it even better.  Yum!

de-lish!  as per other reviews, i served this over a salad of romaine lettuce, cherry tomatoes, avacado slices, bacon crumbles, and gorganzola cheese.  for a bit of protein, I also served Spicy Black Bean Cakes and topped them with this dressing.  It was awesome!!  I can wait to try this dressing on many other things.

This is a great dressing. I had to make a few substitutions, but the core of the recipe lends itself to variation. I didn't have buttermilk so I used a touch of coffee cream. I didn't have dill either, so I used 1.5 tbsp of dill pickle juice. This gave the dill flavour and added the zing the buttermilk would have brought. I also added a couple squeezes of lime juice. I put this on top of a wedge salad, and it was a nice alternative to blue cheese.

Absolutely delicious! Used as a dip for baby carrots and red bell peppers and it certainly made me want to eat my vegetables. Used half an avocado, and I will double the recipe next time and use a whole one. Thanks!

In my 3 year old's words - "yummie to my tummie, Mommie". :) 
I added a bit extra avocado because I LOVE it! I also added 1 garlic clove like the other reviews.

Four and a half stars, really. I made this a lowfat dip by using reduced fat mayonnaise/sour cream. I did make this dip early this morning as I made breakfast and tasted it before serving it with a vegetable platter--it's very good but for us, it needed quite a bit more of the spices called for. I loved the addition of avocado and though my kids didn't know what was in it, they liked the new ingredient to the ranch.

I'm giving this 4 stars only because I changed the recipe, feeling that it was too heavy on the mayo. I used about half the mayo called for, wine vinegar and minced fresh garlic and onion rather than powdered dry--it goes wonderfully with tuna and hard boiled eggs on a tossed salad-- lettuce, tomatoes, cukes, peppers, red onion, etc.  Thanks so much for this recipe--great for catching an avocado on its way out!

Great recipe. I would have given 5 stars but the vinegar was too much. I had to add more sour cream to get away from the vinegar taste. Other than that after a few tweaks, Great!

loved it....especially when using strawberries in the salad....I added cayenne pepper to give it a little kick, and used milk instead of buttermilk, as I didn't have any.....delicious

This is simple and easy to make and tastes wonderful!  I used homemade olive oil mayo, homemade buttermilk.  I will never buy bottled dressing again!  Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

I had to make a few adaptations due to food allergies.  I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream, omitted the butter milk and used cider vinegar.  Even with the changes, the result was delicious!  Thank you so much for this recipe!

Um, no thank you.... I really didn't enjoy this at all. My parents did, so I guess that's all that matters, right? Last night's Mexican-themed dinner included white chili, cornbread, a tossed salad and apple enchiladas for dessert. I wanted to serve a dressing that would complement my entree choices (NOTE: I had to thin this down with extra buttermilk to achieve a pourable consistency). All I can say is this tastes NOTHING at all like Chili's avocado ranch dip they serve with their Southwest egg rolls (not even close, IMHO). I like their version, but NOT this copycat one. Right after making this (earlier in the day to allow time to refrigerate / mingle flavors), I tasted it - and nothing! There was no initial taste (if that even makes sense???), followed by a VERY subtle (and I mean subtle) herby aftertaste. I hoped that a couple of hours chilling time would change my mind, but sadly, this made no difference. Maybe this will float your boat, but it certainly didn't mine. I sooo wish I would have gone with my gut and tried casa dressing instead (Denyse). Oh well. You can't win all the time.... Sorry!

Beautiful color and tasty salad dressing.  Subbed 2% milk for the buttermilk and added more than 1 tblsp to make a nice salad dressing consistency.  Only other thing I changed was to use cider vinegar instead of white.

This was pretty good, but I think would have been better with some fresh parsley and dill, and as others mentioned, fresh minced garlic.  I made as stated, but then added a little red wine vinegar.  I put everything through my food processor for a nice smooth dip/dressing.  Will make again, but with tweak to my liking a bit.

This is very tasty.  I made it with white balsamic vinegar and one garlic clove in lieu of the garlic powder.  Even as I wrote this, I changed it from a 4 to a 5 because I think it reminds me of tat2's No Guilt Ranch Dressing in that with thinning it could be used as a salad dressing.  I loved the taste.  I'll play around with it a while to make it fit whatever comes to mind.  In the meantime, I'll use it for dipping carrot sticks, pieces of red cabbage, celery, etc.

Yummy! I have a ton of ranch powder that I'm trying to use up, so I used 1.5 TBS of that rather than the individual seasonings, the vinegar and the buttermilk. I made this to serve with Buffalo Chicken Fajitas, but it's also very good to serve as a veggie dip.

I used fat free sour cream and low fat mayo and regular milk in this one. I also added about a teaspoon of sugar and a half jalapeno finly chopped. Really awesome and a little goes a long way. Even with extra milk it is a little more like a dip than a dressing so you could assumibly add more milk if it is too thick.

This was a good dressing. I did double the seasonings for better flavor. I used this dressing to make a ranchero chicken soft taco and poured the mix over my chicken and it worked well. Will make  this recipe again.

I didn't have any buttermilk so I just omitted. I also used fresh herbs from my garden instead of dried. It turned out amazing! My dad ate it as a dip for chips and just about anything else he could! I would probably thin it out a little more for a true salad dressing. But I will be making it again!

My firsy attempt at making avocado ranch and pretty happy with the results. I put a whole avocado in so probably double required but the texture and flavor still seemed good to me. I would orefer a bit more seasoning to really wow me which is why I didnt give five stars.

I did half an avocado and substituted basil for the herb that was called for. I also couldn't find my distilled white vinegar so I used my white wine vinegar. Great recipe tho, thank you.

This is our new favorite at home and my daughter always wants me to bring a salad with "the avocado dressing" when we have dinner at her house.  
I like to use chili Fritos for the "croutons" when we have this dressing.
Yummy!

Phenomenal,  I cannot stop eating this dressing!! I did not have buttermilk so I substituted regular milk for that and then followed the recipe exactly. I may add a tad bit more salt for my taste but otherwise this is exactly what I was looking for. I even used light mayonnaise and light  sour cream. Healthier than the store pre-made version and in my opinion just as tasty.

Love Love Love this recipe... I'm a huge Green Goddess fan, but can't always find it in stores. I've had avocado dressing from a bottle before. This  recipe surpasses all those In taste and of course homemade freshness. The only tweaks I made where 
(1 whole avocado = 1/2 cup)(1/2 tsp jar garlic)( 1/2 cup buttermilk),  but everything else required was right on. I may have eyeballed those ingredients instead of measuring. Thanks!!!

I didn't follow the original recipe, I used it more as a guide.. I used a whole avocado, 1/2 lime, balsamic instead of white vinegar, mayo, fresh garlic, fresh parsley, I didn't have buttermilk so I used a spoon of sour cream & a splash of cream. I also added cilantro.

I loved this fresh and creamy dressing.  I had some avocados that needed to be used up and came across this recipe. I had all the ingredients on hand to make this.  This was quick and easy to make and was delicious!

The dressing is so simple and delicious.  I just threw everything in the blender and have at it.  Because I love avocado so much, I may add more the next time, but it is great just as written.

Very fresh, creamy and delicious. I used organic, plain yogurt (pretty sour) instead of sour cream and instead of buttermilk I curdled some milk with lime, all the other ingredients were left as written and must say it turned out perfectly. I needed this for a Tex-Mex dish so I left the avocado a bit chunky and loved it so much I threw it on a salad too. It is versatile enough to be used for pretty much anything and adjusting the ingredients slightly will allow you to play with consistency without compromising flavour. Thank you Emily Kisling for your recipe.

I and hubby loved this.  Because I was using it on a southwestern salad, I opted for fresh organic cilantro instead of parsley, but other than that.... it was delicious! Hubby is picky and he was skeptical,  but nodded in approval.  Thanks for sharing!!

I was super excited for this, but it ended up being a let down. It had no flavor at all, and that was after it sat for nearly 24hrs.

I've been looking for an avocado ranch recipe for a while. I got hooked on the avocado ranch dressing at a national chain (the one with the big pepper on the roof), and I wanted to be able to make my own. This is about as close as it gets. I used fat free sour cream, nonfat buttermilk, and lowfat mayo. It is delicious! The recipe is great as it is, but I always like to tinker with things. I went a bit heavier on the avocado, and I also added some salt-free southwest chipotle seasoning to spice it up. It was amazing! This recipe is a keeper!

I used white wine vinegar and added extra.  Used fresh bill and basil instead of dried & parsley.  More salt, lots of fresh pepper and extra salt.  All of the spices I doubled or tripled

I love this when made with grated onion and minced garlic in place of the dry ingredients. To make the buttermilk required for the recipe, I add a few drops of lemon juice to the milk. I once tried adding lime juice, but I thought it gave it an odd flavor. I've also added fresh cilantro before... amazing. Great dip for chips, veggies. Would probably want to thin to use as a salad dressing.

I made this exactly how the recipe was written and I must say that I found it on the bland side. I added some ground white pepper and it was still a little bland. Next time that I make it I do believe that I will add some ground mustard, paprika, cumin, and possibly some Adobo as well. 

I will say this much though my 3yr old loved. It is because of that I am giving it four stars, because she is one picky eater.

As a salad dressing this was OK with suggested changes (fresh herbs and garlic). I used half the mayo called for, 3/4 C buttermilk to get it to a dressing consistency, and a full tablespoon of red wine vinegar for more tang.  It just seemed to be missing something.  Added lots of pepper too.

Great!!! Love it! My roommates like to eat vegetables, like baby carrots... so I made this dressing last night, oh, couldn't stop eating it! So good! Just a right amount of everything, but I omitted the onion powder since didnt have any, but still tastes great!

I did not have powdered garlic or powdered onion so I used a clove of chopped garlic and 3 chopped green onions. Didn't have parsley so I used cilantro instead. Came out very well with what I had in the house.

This is SO good! I just made it and haven't even had it on my salad yet. I used everything except for the dill, because I didn't have it. I added lemon juice and cut up cilantro. I'll definately be making this again.

Loved it!  Used low fat mayo and sour cream, and it turned out great.  I also used regular milk (well, Lactaid) instead of buttermilk to thin it out to facilitate better pouring.  I think maybe next time I will use a little more of each spice and add some salt and pepper, but I will definitely be making this again!
