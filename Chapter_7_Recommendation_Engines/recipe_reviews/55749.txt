AWESOME!  This cake was baked for me for my birthday, so I did not prepare it, but I can vouch that it tastes divine!  It is so rich and moist, and the orange liqueur adds a perfect flavor to the already sublime rich chocolate.  It does not require frosting of any kind, and my mother-in-law made up a batch of "espresso Cool Whip", which I tried but found to be completely unnecessary.  This cake is so wonderful, and I highly recommend it for any special occasion.  Thanks so much for sharing this invaluable recipe!
