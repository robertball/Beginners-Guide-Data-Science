I've made this recipe on the stove.  This is good, but I gave it a 4 star rating because the topping is a bit bland/gooey/pastey tasting.   The second time I made it, I doubled the sugar in the topping recipe, but it still tasted a little pastey after it simmered 2 minutes.  So, after I removed it from the heat,  I added 1/4 tsp. vanilla and it was much better tasting.  Instead of fresh mango I used the Dole frozen mango chunks.

Yes, this is exactly the recipe I was looking for.  The proportions are perfect (rice:sauce) and it tastes like it should.  Delicious.

I have made this twice. The first time I used sticky rice and cooked it on a splatter guard on top of pan of water about three inches from rice and placed a stainless steal bowl over the rice. I turned the rice once during cooking. It turned perfect. The second time some of the rice cooked and some didn't and after two hour I just chucked it and made long grain rice. It was ok but I didn't really like it after having the sticky rice. I am going to try the micro wave and if that doesn't work I am going to buy a steamer. 1/2 cup sugar in the coconut milk and it was more than sweet. The second time I used Agave' sugar and it wasn't as sweet. The flavor was there but need to add more next time. You can also use tapioca starch in place of corn starch which I did. I also used 1/2 cups rice and i/2 cups coconut milk. I live in Australia and there are no Mangos at this time of year so I used canned ones. I preferred them and it was a lot cheaper. ( I really miss the great food in the US) You really can use any kind of fruit you like. This is really one of the best recipes I have tried on the site and 8 of my friends who I served it to agreed.

So easy and so delicious!!  A trick for making the sticky rice: soak your rice over night and steam the next day. I use a colander and a large pot with a lid to steam the rice and it come out perfect!

Turned out really well and was actually much simpler than I expected. I would have liked it if there was slightly more of the coconut sauce, but perhaps I over cooked it and lost some. But it was a real treat overall!

Best with leftover COLD sticky rice added earlier (breaks down less when cooking and moistens up old, drying rice).  When we have a lot of leftover sticky rice at the temple we make this for breakfast. 
Not sure the cornstarch is necessary since sticky rice is very glutenous. To be authentic palm sugar should be used, and it cuts down on the sweetness some reviewers complained about. 
Thais usually use coconut cream since a lot of milk can be made from a little cream, then add some leftover cream to sweetened condensed milk and a little butter to make a drizzle to go over the final plate if you like it sweeter. Laos often substitute pineapple for mangoes where I live.  I have also made this will cinnamon.

Made this once already and it came out perfect.  It's a simple recipe that tastes like it came from a Thai restaurant.  I will be making it again tonight!

FABULOUS!  Didn't change anything (except I had to add more water 3x during rice cooking phase).  I've never made rice in the microwave...always in the rice cooker, so this was a fun recipe!  And YUMMY!!!  It was more than enough for 6 people.

Was great! I used flour in place of cornstarch ( only because I didnt have any) and it worked fine. Simple and yummy recipe.

This was good, but too sweet.  I would cut back on the sugar and make sure to get a good mango (it makes the world of difference.)  
Also, I about died when I saw the caloric & fat content in Coconut milk- I didn't realize how bad it is for you!  So this is definitely a once in a blue moon treat!

I was a little skeptical about doing the rice in the microwave, but this turned out great. I made it just as written, and my kids ate it up! I mistakenly purchased a huge bag of glutinous rice, so I will definitely be making this again!

Alright, though I would say A) follow the other suggestion in the reviews (doubling the sugar in the sauce and adding vanilla), B) don't add the salt unless you really need it, otherwise it tastes weird.

This has quickly become a family favorite. I love that the sauce is a bit salty to balance out the dish. When I can't find good mangoes I use fresh pineapple or strawberries, all delicious. Also I always add crushed peanuts on top for an added salty crunch.

This was perfect! My only tweak was adding a bit of vanilla to the rice mixture! So quick and easy!

Much yum. Squishy and tasty, and went well with mangos. Will make again, if Irma doesn’t destroy my rice, coconut, and mango farms.

I did not make any changes to the recipe and it came out great. My husband, who is very picky, said it was just like the one at our favorite Thai restaurant.

I made this for a friend and she loved it! It wasn't too sweet nor plain. The recipes says to cook it the rice in the microwave but I used the traditional bamboo and pot method to make the sticky rice. If you dice the mangoes, you'll need more than 2!!

Oh and to get that " pasty " taste out of the sauce I omitted the corn starch and used " WONDRA "by Gold Medal instead! Worked great. I also added an 1/8th teaspoon of coconutf flavoring to the sauce as well as the rice. It worked well also.
