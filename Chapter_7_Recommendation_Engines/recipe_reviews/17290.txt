This bread came out beautifully, but I gave the recipe only 4 stars because, like the other reviewers, I found that it needed quite a bit more flour in order to be manageable.  It was light, not dense, but that could be because I mixed it in my KitchenAid and then kneaded the bread by hand.  I let the loaves rise on a sheet of parchament paper on the wood paddle that came with my pizza stone.  Then I transfered paper and loaves to the stone, which made it extremely easy.  I baked it for the lesser time and gave it an additional 5 minutes just before serving and the bread was heavenly.  The aroma, texture and presentation was top-notch.  The recipe calls for preheating your oven just after the first knead, but I think there was an error in the directions.  You don't have to heat your oven until the second rising begins with your stone in the oven.  I'll make this again and again!

This bread is the closest to real Italian bread I've found.  After the egg, I dust flour over the tops of the loaves.  If you like a crunchy crust try spritzing a little water in your oven a few times throughout the baking process.

Excellent recipe!!

I have made 30-40 batches, using this recipe for Christmas gifts for neighbors and friends.

If you have a Kitchen-Aid or similar bread capable mixer, double the recipe, and you will need to add a little more flour.

The kids helped make snowflakes and Christmas trees. I now use this for my home made pizza crust.

A pizza stone and Pizza peel are essential.

This is a delicious bread.  On my first attempt it stuck to the cutting board.  It tasted good, but looked messed up.  The next time I put parchment paper under the loaves so they would move easily to the stone. That worked wonderfully.

Good basic Italian Bread recipe. Good texture and taste. I sprayed a bit of water in the oven, several times,as it was baking and gave it a nicer crust.  I reccomend trying this one.

This recipe was GREAT.  I did notice the dough was a little sticky while I was mixing it so I added another 1/4 cup flour and it turned out great.  I didn't have any problem with it sticking.  I'll have to make double the recipe next time.  It wasn't enough for my family of 7.  My five children all wanted seconds and thirds. Thanks for a Great and easy recipe.

What an easy and fabulous bread - it had a great crispy crust when I took it out of the oven, but it softened by the time it cooled - next time I'll spritz the water rather than just put water in the oven.  My family all raved over it and my son wanted it the next night for dinner!
Definitely worth making!!  Thanks!!!

The bread was delicious!  I put the ingredients in the night before, and set the timer to have it ready when I woke up.  Still bleary eyed, I separated the dough, let it rise, and put it into the oven.  Yet the bread came out perfect!

I thought this bread was great.  I was looking for a bread to make on a snowy afternoon and this looked fine.  I do not have a bread maker, but mixed one batch in my kitchenaid. The method I used: combine the flour, sugar, yeast and salt  in the mixer. Then combine the oil and warm water and add slowly while mixer is running. After the dough comes together (I needed to add an additional 1/2 cup of flour), let the dough hook knead it for 7 minutes.  I turned it out onto a board then but the texture was lovely and did not need more kneading. Preheated your oven to 200 then turn it off. Let the dough rise in an oiled bowl covered with plastic wrap in the oven for 40 minutes.  The dough was a little sticky to handle but using the parchment paper eliminated most of the handling.  I let it rise for the additional 40 minutes but in the future would let it rise longer - it wasn't that tall when done - but a lovely taste and texture.  The crust was perfect.  I will definitely make this again.

Bread Maachine - wet ingredients go in first, then add dry - I put yeast last - I use 2 T olive oil, 1 T honey - 3-3/4 c bread flour - 1-1/4 c warm water. After first rise (either in machine or by hand), follow the recipe.   Non-stick foil is the answer to just about all baking needs - I put the shaped dough on it and put it either on the pizza paddle or a cookie sheet and transfer the dough and foil onto the stone - after a few minutes I just pull the foil out from under the dough. Since it is not at all soiled I just keep using it. I no longer spritz with water - just add 10 more minutes to baking time and the crust comes out perfect and the inside is fluffly and so very good.  Try kneading in some olives sometimes - great.  Hope this helps.
I have not tried this recipe but sounds like mine so I will give it 4 stars - can't give 5 if I have not tried it.

I didn't use a bread maker.  I just put all those ingredients in a bowl and mixed then kneaded for about 5-8 minutes.  Then let it rise for almost an hour.  Then pushed down and made two loaves and let 'em rise for 30 minutes.  My family loved it.  Me too.

I only gave this a 4 star because it needs some tweeking.  The taste is a 5 star, getting the results is a 4 star.  I didn't use the egg wash because I don't like the eggie taste that it creates.  I spritzed with water 3 times during baking to produce a crispy crust.  You don't need a bread machine to do this recipe.  I added the water, yeast, oil, salt and sugar to a bowl and let it sit 10 min till frothy.  Then I added 2 cups of the flour 1 cup at a time and stirred in between till well encorporated.  I then transfered it to my kitchenaid with the dough hook attachment and mixed for 5 to 6 min on the 2nd setting, slowly adding the last cup of flour 1 - 2 tbsp at a time.  Once done the dough will be stuck on the hook and not the sides of the bowl.  If it's sticking to the bowl add a bit more flour (1 tbsp at a time) till its not sticking to the sides.  Overall the mixing time should be 10 min.  Transfer to an oiled bowl and let rest 1 hr or till doubled.  Then follow the rest of the recipe.  I also used parchment paper for the second rising so the bread is easily transfered to the stone without disturbing it.  Like I said, awesome taste, you just have to tweek and be careful.

This bread is baking as I write this review.  So far, I'm thinking not a good recipe.  I added 1/2 extra flour into the bread machine prior to starting cycle. It came out so sticky I had to need lots more flour into it to even handle the dough.  It seemed to rise fine but when I uncovered it and slit it w/the knife, it deflated.  I'll let you know once it's done baking how it came out. But I don't think it's going to be so good.  I'm going to stick w/the Artisan Bread in 6 minutes a day (i think that's what it's called.  No kneading and never failed me.  UPDATE:  It just came out of the oven. NO GOOD!!!.  I'm going back to the Artisan recipe mentioned above

This was awesome.  However, I filled it with broccoli, sauted red onions, parmasain regiano, and minced garlic.  layered it out and rolled like a jelly roll.  Made 2 loaves and they were both gone in one day.

This was the best bread I have ever made with a bread machine! However, I didn't know exactly how to make a loaf so I just did a log and tried to flatten it. But it was still wonderful. Any tips on how to form a loaf?

Great recipe, I kneaded this by hand and found it to be a bit sticky so I added little more flour as I went. Bread was delicious and everyone raved about its taste. Thanks for a great find.

I have made this recipe before---but I didn't remember putting in that much salt! Made 2 beautiful loaves, but they were really, really salty. Might suggest reducing the salt next time...otherwise a great recipe (:

This recipe was super easy.  I used parchment paper to rise & bake on as suggested.  Next time I am going to try and use loaf pans to bake in so that I can use them for sandwiches, these loaves were not tall enough to use.

My husband and I absolutely adore this bread. It is really great dipped in olive oil and herbs and it makes wonderful toast!

I am still working on getting the bread neatly onto the stone. Sometimes I do well, and sometimes the loaves end up oddly-shaped because after I slide the bread onto the stone, we have to use a spatula to shift them off the oven rack and back onto the stone. 

No matter the shape, it still tastes great!

This was delicious and beautiful....real "authentic" looking. The next time I make it I may add some seeds (flax, sesame, sunflower) and/or nuts. I like crunch. Thanks for this recipe.

I have been looking for a good bread recipe and i have found it.  I let it rise for almost two hours and then cooked them seperately, for my stone was not big enough. (my bread rose out not up)  I was concerned that they had not risen enough becasue they did not get higher, but they were perfect when they came out of the oven.

I tried this twice and love the flavor and crust. However when I went to place the loafs in the oven (both times) they  fell from the beautiful nice rise they were just the minute before I moved them. Can anyone tell me why and how to prevent this next time. I don't dare cut slices on top after they raise either as it was like deflating a balloon when I tried to cut a slit on top. Otherwise delicious !!!!! Thanks

I made this to take to a party, and it was gone before I had a few bites.  I put kosher salt on the top before baking.  Mine turned out a little flat, too, but was still very good.  Next time I will double the recipe.

This bread is yummy! I only used 1 cup of water with 3 cups bread flour and had no problem with sticky dough. Mixed in the stand mixer with the dough hook and let it knead the dough for 5 minutes. The egg wash added wonderful color and the crust is chewy just as it should be. I did let the bread rise on parchment paper after shaping and then put paper and all on the pizza stone to bake. We are adding this to our list of favorites!

After looking at a lot of the reviews and preparing the dough myself I had the same issue as many others, too liquid dough. The problem is the wording of the recipe, it looks like the egg is in the dough when it actually is for the final eggwash.  So read this carefully and it will come out fine. It would have been helpful if the writer had seperated the wash ingredients by listing them as such.

Excellent recipe, everyone took two or more pieces and asked for the recipe! You definitely need to use more corn meal than you think, just so the bread doesn't fall while transferring it to the stone.

Very nice, very easy.  for people complaining about stickiness . . .making dough is often dependent on the moisture level in the air, which is why sometimes it's too dry, sometimes too wet . . .you may have to add liquid or flour depending on the weather where you live.  it's been raining here for days, but weirdly enough my dough wasn't too wet or sticky.  i did, however, oil a bowl and let it rise for the third time in there bc bf wanted to go to Costco in the middle of me making this recipe.  so, that may have cut out some of the stickiness people are complaining about, although it wasn't that sticky when I took it out of the bread machine.  I almost forgot to bake it on the pizza stone . . I was just going along, doing what I always do and put the bread on the cookie sheet to rise.  Since I did that, I just pulled the bread off the cookie sheet with the silpat mat and put it on the stone that way.  Worked just fine.  Thanks for the recipe!

With no doubt, this was absolute perfection. Several attempts to bake my own bread have created some very unique door stops and boat anchors. I am very happy to say that this was so good that one entire loaf was gone in 20 minutes just between me and my wife. 
Thank you so much for this one.

This tasted pretty good, but the loaves were really flat.  Needs a lot more flour to be even slightly manageable after it comes out of the bread machine.  Too sticky to even form rolls. Had an odd odor, but tasted good.

I followed this recipe exactly, excepting the cornmeal.  I went ahead and put the formed dough onto parchment paper, let it rise, then put it all onto the preheated stone.  After the loaves had cooled, I made some bruschetta, it was fantastic.  This is such a great bread, it is soft, with a slightly crunchy crust.  It also has a very good flavor and an moist, dense texture.  I will definately be making this recipe again--and soon!

Good recipe.  I rigged an old wine box to be a loaf pan so the loaf does rise flat.  Worked great and made for a beautiful loaf of bread.

The bread had a bit of an odd aroma but I can get beyond it.

This is best bread recipe I have ever made. The only change I did, was not to put the egg wash on it, therefore it became vegan. I did spritz the loaves 3 times with water in the first 10 minutes of cooking time.  I may never buy store bread again. Thanks for sharing.....

Wow.. if I was going just by taste this would of been 5 stars.. but this was a horrible recipe to work with. I followed the recipe exactly and it was so sticky coming out of the bread machine that I needed my husband's help b/c it wouldn't come off my hands or let go of the bowl. I ended up kneaded it by hand and adding more flour to it and that helped but it was still alittle sticky but I didn't want to over flour it so I stopped. I guess by adding the extra flour and kneading it by hand it was all lumpy, I tried kneading it out but it still looked bumpy. I've made bread before so I know what I'm doing.. I just don't understand what went wrong with this recipe. But I decided to keep going and I put it on parchment paper and put a damp cloth over it to let it rise but 30 mins later it hadn't risen much and the damp cloth was sticking to the bread so I peeled off the cloth and sprinkled alittle flour on the top of the loaves to prevent sticking and put a dry cloth over them, than I stuck it in the oven at 175 and it finally started to rise but even than it didn't rise too much. The only thing that saved this bread was the taste. Oh and one tip... I made a mixture of 1/4 teas of each spice.. pepper, garlic powder and thyme and sprinkled that on the top of one of the loaves for flavor. That one tasted incredible! I will do that again but I'm sorry I won't be trying this recipe again!

I need help. I think this would have turned out great for me, except I don't have a bread machine. I put it in my mixer w/a dough hook and it was very runny. I added much more flour to try to get it in a dough ball but my results were tough flat bread. Any suggestions?

What an incredible flavor - almost identical to a recipe I tried last week but this one has a great flavor. The loaves came out soft. I have read that for that crispy crust water should be spritzed onto the crust three times during the first ten minutes of baking, but I couldn't find my water spray bottle so I didn't try it. Will next time, and this will be the recipe I use. Also, I don't have a baking stone yet so I used a preheated metal baking sheet.

Excellent!!If I could give this recipe more than five stars I would.This bread tastes just like Italian bread you would buy in a bakery in New York City.The crust is very crispy and thick.I made this recipe 3 times now.This past time I couldn`t use my bread machine.so I ended up doing it by hand.I had to add 1-1/2 cups more flour because it was very sticky.I thought it was going to come out too tough because of the extra flour,but it was excellent.You cant mess this recipe up!Also,don`t be discouraged to try this recipe if you don`t have a pizza stone.i don`t have one either and it`s fine!

Tasty! Husband made this while I worked in the yard.  It did not rise as much as he wanted it too (it was only about 35 degrees that day) but it was still tasty.  We will make this again.

I dough rose nicely but I too had difficulty transferring it to the stone without it deflating. As a result it was a little flatter than I would have liked but it still tasted great. Wonderful dipped in a good olive oil mixed with italian seasoning and garlic! Another reviewer suggested using parchment paper under the loaves while they are rising. I will try that next time. Thanks for the recipe Destiny.

This was so good!  I added an extra 1/4 cup of flour as some reviews suggested so the dough wasn't too sticky. I did have a little trouble getting the loaves onto the pizza stone, and the loaves were sort of flat, but oh were they good!  We all loved this bread.  It's best eaten the first day.

Followed all steps- made by hand. First rise went ok, as did the second rise- but moving them off the off the parchment sheet did not go well. Dropped and stayed flat on the pizza stone. Baked the loaves- very dense. Probably operator error- will not try again.
Will make croutons- it's all good.

I used this recipe for baking in my wood fired oven.  It was simple and easy to follow.  WFO gave it a nice crust all around.

I just loved the texture of this bread, a good example of Italian Bread.  The only disappointment was the crust.  I sprayed the crust 3 times during the first 7 minutes, for me usually results in a nice crusty crust.  This seemed perfect when it came out of the oven but soon went soft.  I used the sponge method, but nest time try the overnight to see if I get a better crust from that.  Enjoyed the texture just need to experiment a little to get exactly the bread I require.

Did exactly as written, but mine fell down twice. It was still good flavored! I put some rosemary, salt and pepper and it was more like foccacia.  I'm going to work on the rise again.

I started this in my bread machine, & added an extra cup of flour- but could have also eliminated the 1/3 cup of water instead. I didn't have olive oil, I used 2 tbl of butter, and added 1 tbl. of snipped fresh rosemary. This bread came out perfect- nice & tender on the inside. A beautifully golden & shiny crust from the egg wash.  My family raved about it! It was the first bread that I baked on my pizza stone, and won't be the last! Easy!

this recipe is essential and super easy! instead of a bread machine i simply mixed the dough with a wooden spoon and then kneeded it for about 8 minutes. then i let the dough rise as directed. instead of spraying the loaves with water as many people have said, i used the egg wash that was used before the bread was put in the oven. this had a better effect!

This is really good italian bread. I mixed my dough in my Kitchen-Aid mixer with dough hook. I let it rise in the bowl and then punched down and form into loaves on my stone. Makes 2 nice size loaves, that are light and have lots of holes for cheese and sauce to fill.

Mine turned out not so appealing to the eyes.  I am giving it a 5 star though because I know it is something I messed up.  The bread was excellent.   Will be making it again.  Thanks for sharing.

Super easy to make, taste was awesome.  My picky teenagers devoured one loaf in a matter of minutes.  I followed another reviewer’s advice and used parchment paper to let the dough rise and to move it to the stone. So much easier and it makes cleanup after spreading the egg on the crust a snap.  I made one variation by adding 2 tablespoons of rosemary flakes to the dough.

Thanks, Diane! One tip: DON'T leave it over night to rise. This was a mistake I made, and this will make the bread very flat. Thanks again for a great recipe! FOLLOWING

Make it today with the Kitchenaid mixer but other than that the exact ingredients.   Used a pizza paddle covered with some corn meal to raise the bread loafs and place on the pizza stone.   Both slide right on the stone.  Only issue was as they cooked they touched.  Sprinkled cornmeal on one and white flour on the other.  Cooked for 30 min.   One thing is to remove all air bubbles when you punch down and separate the dough.

As other reviewers have noted, the recipe as written makes a very wet, sticky dough.  I decided to add not more than 1/2 cup of flour just to see how this would come out....

I add the whole 1/2 cup of flour and still have an incredibly sticky dough.  It rose well both times and baked very nicely.  The crust was crispy -- thanks to those who mentioned spraying water in the oven a few or more times.

However, it was just very bland in the end.  I really wanted to like this as the crust baked just like I want it to and the inside was slightly dense -- it looked like grocery store made Italian bread.  But it just didn't have any flavor at all.  I won't make this again.

I used my bread machine and loved the result. I also didn't use the egg, just spritzed with water while baking. I have to be honest, my yeast packet had expired in 2013, so the bread probably didn't rise as well as expected, but the taste was awesome, the crust crispy, and the inside full of holes to soak up butter.  
Buying more yeast tomorrow, and will definitely make again.

Using the bread machine to do most of the work is awesome! A great bread recipe, and they turned out beautiful! I made as directed - but I always place the loaves on a piece of parchment paper that has been sprinkled with corn meal and then just transfer the parchment paper directly onto the stone. I've tried the cornmeal, slide-off method with pizza before, and it just never works for me - so parchment is my default method. Sprinkling the parchment with the cornmeal ensures the loaves won't stick to the parchment. This bread has a soft middle, and would be great for dipping in a olive oil / seasoning blend. This is not like the crusty artisan bread with large holes in the middle - but more like a slicing bread. My Italian husband approved, so that means this one is getting saved in my recipe box! Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Thank you for the recipe,  Diane and thank you to so many for their reviews. 
This bread was so quick. I don't have bread maker and still it turned out to be soooo  yummy. I had thrown all ingredients in one go, mixed it with both using had mixer with dough attachment and then folded together using hands. I made only one loaf ( Before baking, I had added olive oil with Italian seasoning and chilli flakes ). Preheated pizza stone  and I always use baking paper so that my there is no mess to clean later ??.   As per some reviewers I had put a tray with chilled water in lower shelf. 
Enjoyed with olive oil and balsamic vinegar along with a glass of wine. This is certainly a favourite one and I will make it again and again and again!

This is a nice bread, the loaf I made had a very short life. I did NOT use a bread machine because I had mixed and kneaded the dough before  seeing the the machine reference.  I did add an additional 1/4 cup of flour after reading some of the reviews,  the dough was a bit wet but not unduly so, and I also skipped the egg wash since I wasn't sure how it would work with the flour I dusted the loaf with. The crust was great, I misted it every 10 minutes, 3 times total. tTwexture and flavor were wonderful, I will definitely be making this again. If anyone cares, I kneaded the dough for about 75 strokes, and let it rise for 2 hrs before punching and forming the loaf. I did use my pizza stone, my loaf took a little over 30 minutes to bake. Well worth the effort, give this one a shot, you won't regret it!

Yummy!  I made this in a short afternoon.  Very fine grain.  I used my Bosch mixer and next time I'll double the batch.  So easy!  Yes, needs more flour.  Great texture.

My farmers liked it in the field with their ravioli supper tonight.

It's a good thing that I need this bread for dinner tonight, because otherwise I would eat the whole loaf right out of the oven!  The only thing I added was some Italian seasoning and garlic powder to the dough, then the last minute of baking, I brushed olive oil and Kosher salt on top.  One other reviewer said it tastes like the Macaroni Grill bread...closest I've gotten, anyway.  The dough was quite sticky coming out of the bread machine, so it was kind of a mess, but the loaves turned out great anyway.

This bread reminded me of the bread at Macaroni Grill. I made 2 small round loaves and 2 calzones. Note: I didn't proof my yeast which had an expiration date of 09/08 and was stored in the fridge since December. I had to leave the dough in the bread machine for an additional 30-45 minutes after the end of the dough cycle as it hadn't risen enough. Once I gave it more time it was fine. Thanks Destiny!

This was a great bread recipe, so easy!  I let it rise on the pizza stone and baked it a few minutes longer and it worked perfectly.  I used 1 cup of whole wheat flour because I ran out of regular...still great.  Used the leftovers the next night for french toast, fantastic!
