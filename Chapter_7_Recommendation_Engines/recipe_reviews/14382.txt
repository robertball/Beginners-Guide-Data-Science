I have made this before but I always soak my cucumbers and onions in salt water overnight until they are limp. The salt from the water doesn't add too much saltiness but I'd leave out the salt when mixing in the sour cream. Yes they must be very dry when mixing in the sour cream so draining them for a couple of hours after soaking is essential. The salad is very watery otherwise. I also have added a little dill when mixing in the sour cream. This seems like a lot of work but it's really not. Just some planning and a couple of minutes cutting and draining and then you let them sit in the refrigerator the rest of the time. Makes a very tasty elegant salad.

I wrote the last review of this recipe almost a year ago. I've been on a quest for the perfect cucumber salad for some years before that too. This is still a DELICIOUS salad and I've been making it a lot lately because cucumbers are cheap and abundant. It's a good way to use up a lot of cucumbers. A few slices on a tossed salad just doesn't use up enough. Right now serving for serving, an all cucumber salad is cheaper than lettuce too. You might be interested to know that the salt soaking I mentioned before also seems to cut down significantly on the burping.
I have since tried a scant amount of thyme instead of the dill. This is good. I've tried the paprika but I won't again. It doesn't add much to the flavor and it gives it a pinkish color I don't care for. I have however taken to mixing equal parts mayo and sour cream.

Simple and delicious! Sometimes the most basic ingredients combine to be some of the best tasting. I love cucumber salads and they make a nice light side dishes. Be sure to drain the liquid out of the cucumbers so you don't have a watery, "soggy" salad. I used reduced fat sour cream as fat free usually has an aftertaste that's a bit unpleasant. I let it chill for a couple of hours and it was very "cool" and very good. It reminds me of my Grandma Jean's cucumber salad - Thanks!

Without vinegar, I found this to be very bland. Once I added it in it turned out very well.

This is the same way my grandma made these too! We chilled the cukes until they were ice cold and crisp. I do not remember the drying process but know they were drained really good. We used reg. sour cream. We also added dill weed to this too for added flavor. It's really refreshing on summer days. Thanks Jill!

I loved this recipe because it's the quintessential taste of summer for me.  I use low fat sour cream and lots of white wine vinegar mixed in which gives it a good vinegary tang.  Lots of black pepper makes it really yummy.  I've been making a variation of this recipe since I was a little girl.

I enjoyed this recipe but I did add some fresh dill for a little extra flavor. The drying technique was very helpful. I will make this again.

We love this! I have been preparing/eating this for many years. This is the way my great-grandma, grandma and mom prepared cucumbers and sour cream. The simplicity is perfect. I do use regular sour cream and sweet onion. Thanks for sharing!

I really liked this salad, though next time I will lower the onion to cucumber ratio.  Guess I'm just not that much of an onion person.  I ended up adding some garlic salt and Mrs. Dash for extra flavor and it went over great with my family.  Thanks!

My grandma made this, too! She would sometimes add just a couple tsp. of white vinegar or fresh dill if she thought about it. It's good as is, especially fresh from your own garden.

I've made this recipe (sort of) since I was a kid! We didnt dry the cukes though, sliced em, salted em, tossed the onions in and let it marinate for a few hours in the fridge.  Drain and rinse em then stir in Miracle Whip and a few tablespoons of pickle juice (or vinegar I guess).  They end up creamy and tangy!! If you slice them really thin they get mushy, I like mine thicker so they've got a good bite to em!

I liked this very much.  I found it to be a welcome change from the usual vinegar flavor that so many use to cover the taste of cucumber. I did add a touch of dill.  I'll make this again.  Thanks

This is exactly how my mom used to make it except we would chop the onion instead of slicking it and make it "pretty" by dusting it with paprika before serving. It is cool, crunchy, and EASY to throw together. It is all about personal taste though and what you grew up with. Sometimes I just want something simple, and this does it for me :) Plus, it is a great memory of my mother!  But I saw someone write that they soak the cucumbers and onions in salt water overnight until they are limp.. WHY? Why would you want it limp? I like it crunchy!

A good base but lacking in flavor. I ended up adding garlic powder, celery salt and dill; then it was dee-lish!  You won't like this if you're looking for a zing or tangy flavor- that's another recipe completely. Thanks for submitting it and thanks to all the other reviewers for the helpful tips.

i have made many versions of this.... usually i put a tomato (diced) and use mayo....  my son loves this over white rice.  i always have one of these, (mayo or sour cream) salads on hand every week.  and the longer its sits the more juice comes out and just spoon it out of the rice.  its great!!!!

I make this salad but without the sour cream. I do like one reviewer suggested and soak in vinegar (apple cider), and after an hour or two drain out only a little of the liquid and add a tsp. of sugar, a pinch of dill, and very thin slices of red onion. My grandmother used to make a very lovely, simple salad of tomatoes for her buffet party dinners that reminds me of this. Just beautiful, ripe tomatoes (hers were home grown), sliced in 1/2" slices and staggered on an asparagus serving plate with two dollops of Hellman's (only that brand) mayonnaise on the side. Very simple but delicious and memorable.

I followed this recipe to a "T", but it was a huge disappointment.  The sour cream seemed to make this salad very "wet" and without much flavor.  I won't use it again.

So yummy! I found that some chopped tomatoes and celery were great additions to this dish. Just make sure you dry the cucumbers thoroughly or else you will have a watery salad.

This is a wonderful salad.  I use low-fat sour cream and I add dill (we're a 'dilly' family) I like to make it using the Englih Cucumbers.
For a beautiful presentation (whether you peel your cucumbers or not), firmly  run the tines of a fork lenghwise all the way down the cucumber.  Repeat until you've made your way all around the cucumber.  Then slice thinnly....all the slices will have such a pretty edge. This doesn't change the taste. It only takes a minute and looks like you really fussed.

The creator of this recipe stated it well when he/she said, the portions are ambigious use your eye.  Here is what we did and it turned out great!  Instead of 2 cups, I used 1 1/2 cups sour cream.  I added a tablespoon of vinegar and a pinch of sugar.  Plus, you can't forget the dill.  When making this recipe, you can't expect to follow it word for word.  You need to add a little and check.  Is it to your liking?  If so, stop.  If not, add more.  Like they said, that is how the best cooks do it.  Thanks for the recipe.

Similar to my mother's recipe. Not meant to be quick (not much work, but sets overnight).  My mother added just a tad of sugar and instead of drying the cukes, she squeezed the water out of them and let them soak in their own juices.  Then you drain most of that water off and mix w/ the cream and spices. My mother topped w/ paprika.

I loved how simple this was and didn't taste simple. I didn't use fatfree anything. If you don't use fatfree this is a pretty carb friendly dish.

I have been making my mom's version of this for years.  So cool and light for summer.  I mix in a little wine vinegar and some garlic powder to the sour cream.  Gets better the longer it sits.

My family uses celery seed to season this recipe, but I'd like to try the dill because that sounds good too.  We also squeeze the excess juice out of the cucumbers over the sink and then pat dry.

This was okay, but not necessarily what I was looking for.  It definitely needs something other than sour cream as a dressing.  I even (at the suggestions of others) added some dried dill weed and a splash of vinegar.  Not terrible, but I'm going to look for another recipe.

This recipe was good - i will make again. Like other users, I added chives and dill weed. I also used red onion, which added a lot of ZIP. Next time, I will try again with regular yellow onions.

This is a nice change from the mayo version but I still prefer the mayo to sour cream. I will make this again.

I grew up on this salad. We slice super thin (do this in the morning and let soak all day)and soak the cucs in a salt water, rinse lightly, drain for an hour or so then add sour cream..Dill and red onions if desired. So good alone but we love to put it over a baked potato..yummy! Can remove seeds and that way it doesn't get so watery. FYI..the reviews that say this is tasteless I believe has to do with the soaking in salt water..it is a must in my opinion...and the water should be pretty salty. I dump salt over them then add the water, stir, place a plate over top to make sure all are completely under water.

This IS the way my Grandma makes cukes!  I like to add a bit of dill and chive for extra flavor.  Also, a little bit of salt goes a long way in this recipe so be wary.

GREAT!!!! This recipe is wonderful I was looking for a cucumber salad recipe that did not require vinegar as I had non on hand, came across this one a WOW so simple and tasty. I did make some adjustments only due to personal liking, I added one and a half teaspoon of dried dill weed and two tablespoons of lemon juice. I did taste the sauce before I added the dill and lemon juice and it is still wonderful. As I mentioned just due to personal liking, did I make the additions.  * AS A TIP TO MAKE THE SALAD LOOK PRETTY, BEFORE SLICING THE CUKES SCRAPE THE CUCUMBERS DOWN ALL THE FRONTS LEAVING WAVY LINES... THEN SLICE!! *

I also add a little vinegar.  I like it as a topper for baked or boiled potatoes.
