This was very good. Made a few changes only because I did not have some of the ingredients on hand - apologies to the Chef! Used cooked fresh salmon I had leftover instead of the canned. Did not have the wheat germ, so I crushed up some Ritz crackers instead. Other than that, followed the recipe to the 't'. I served it with the Creamy Dill Dipping Sauce also on this site. Elegant and easy, thank you!

Mom and Dad asked me to cook dinner, and they wanted Salmon Patties. I found this recipe here, and tried it out instead.  

Next time I'm doubling the recipe, because I barely had enough to serve everyone kept swiping them off the plate as soon as they came out of the skillet!

I substituted wheat germ as the coating for "fry mix" Cracker Meal, and used extra virgin olive oil over a very low heat toasting them.  I'll definately be making this again!

This recipe was delicious.  I didn't use the wheat germ or the dill weed and it was still good.

I changed a few things, I added mayo (like a tablespoon, and a tablespoon of sour cream, and added minced onion and breadcrumbs) Instead of frying them I put them in cupcake pan and baked them like that and it was fabulous. I baked them on 350 degrees for 45 min. or until they get brown. I used all the other ingredience along with mine and don't forget the hot sauce if you like it hot! just a little. yummmmy

I had high hopes for this recipe but was somewhat disappointed.  This turned out rather bland.  I thought it needed some salt and pepper for seasoning, and I'm not usually one to add much salt in my cooking.  I was also hoping for more of the salmon taste, but thought the celery and onion over powered the salmon flavor.

Very Good! I had to make some changes according to what I had on hand. I used chopped vidalia onion and rolled the croquettes in bread crumbs instead of wheat germ. I added some furikaki (a japanese rice seasoning) which made it very tasty, and served with sticky rice and a green salad. Great recipe! We all loved it!

Oh my goodness!  Yum!  Super easy, versatile recipe!  My 8 yr old girl made it, with my supervision (and I chopped LOL) because she wanted to try salmon in a packet.  We also added a drained can of Albacore chunk tuna, since the one packet of salmon just didnt seem like it would make enough as a light lunch for my girl, son, and I.  It made 12-14 golf ball shapes of varying size, and she rolled them in crushed Ritz cracker-with-a-bit-of-cornmeal coating (appx 1/4 c cornmeal, 15 crackers) in lieu of wheat germ.  I didnt add dill, though I'm sure that would have been amazing - just didn't have any.  Instead, we threw in a couple shakes of Mrs Dash Zesty - like a Cajun seasoning.  I also just diced up one celery stick and picked off a long green onion from my window plant - so we probably used over a 1/4 cup for each.  Both kids (ages 8, 6) LOVED it.  They dipped in cold Ranch dressing.  My girl said, "These salmon crock-ettes change my mood!"  She still cant remember how to say "croquette" LOL  Definitely a keeper recipe!

I added Italian seasoned bread crumbs instead of wheat germ and added 1/4 C grated romano cheese. Then rolled in bread crumbs and fried in canola oil.

These were tasty and so easy! I added some old bay since one of the reviews mentioned that they were a bit bland. I used dried dill as well, about 1 tsp's worth. I felt like I could have added more since the dill flavor was still pretty subtle. Fresh would probably give it more of a kick.

These were great!  I tried to stay really close to the recipe, but did use red pepper instead of celery, added some salt and pepper, and used a mix of wheat germ and bread crumbs for my wheat-germ-aphobic husband!  Make sure to drain the salmon really well, as mine were a little watery, but I just squeezed them a lot while forming the balls to get rid of extra moisture.  My husband said these were a 5-star after spending all afternoon trying to figure out how to get out of eating them!  Very impressed, will make again, but definitely double or triple the recipe - this only made two each for me, my husband, and our daughter.  I served with coleslaw and corn on the cob.

I had some great Alaskan red salmon and fixed this by adding 1 tsp of Old Bay Seasoning, 2 T of lemon juice and 4 T of mayonaise instead of the egg.  I then rolled them in panko crumbs instead of wheat germ.  I had tried them as printed but like this variation with the mayonaise much better.  It stayed together better as well.

This is an easy, delicious way to get more fish in our diet. I like this recipe because it does not add unnecessary breading in the mixture. I used Panko crumbs, added some fresh lemon, finely chopped celery and red/yellow peppers (because I had some leftover). Thanks for the recipe!

These croquettes were a little bland.  I had omitted the dill because we don't care for it, but added 1/4 t. salt.  It still needs something to perk it up a bit.  I used bread crumbs to coat and had to add some additional bread crumbs to the mixture to get it to hold together as I formed it into patties.  The next time I think I will chill the mixture for an hour to let it "firm up".  I baked them for 30 minutes at 350, but suggest turning them after 15 minutes so they brown more evenly.

Very good recipe - substituted diced red pepper for celery. Used 1/2 wheat germ and 1/2 bread crumbs - flattened and sauteed in 2 tbsp olive oil. Crispy and yummy!

My mother's salmon croquettes (this is what she called them, never salmon patties or salmon cakes) were always plain and simple, but good. Onion, egg, flour, salt and pepper is all she added. She rolled them in flour. I wondered if there might be something a little different so I went to my favorite site. I found this wonderful recipe at allrecipes. I added a little more onions and celery than it called for. That's probably why they didn't hold together very well. I like the veggies, though, so next time I will add a little flour. I also will add a little salt and pepper. I was worried that the wheat germ would not be a good coating. I was wrong. I will try it in other recipes like fish and checken. Great recipe.

I love dill! So this recipe sounded amazing! My grandmother always made these growing up, and this is an interesting turn on her recipe. However, mine fell apart in the frying pan. Maybe use another egg?

This is the first recipe from allrecipes that I have made, and it turned out nicely.  I didn't use celery, substituted chives for the green onions, and used seasoned breadcrumbs instead of wheat germ.  I baked them at 350 for 15 minutes, and they taste delcious.  Very quick.  Very easy.  Very happy.

I used bread crumbs because I had no wheat germ, and I also had only fresh salmon.   I also added a small carrot that I peeled with a veg peeler then chopped even smaller, and a tiny dash of worchestershire.  They were fantastic.  Thank you so much!

AMAZING,this is soooooo easy, and delicious, great for just two,  I'm always looking for dinners for just two, and this receipe suits the small family, it was easy, fast, and ready in about 30min, changes I made were: added alittle bread crumbs to the mix, I rolled the croquettes in bread crumbs and ground flax, sauted in olive oil.  and I wish I had dill on hand, next time I will add it. This is a keeper.

We eat fish at least twice a week and I'm always looking for a way to repackage leftover salmon. These were good, but a little bland for my taste. I used low fat sour cream, light mayo, rolled in panko and baked (16 minutes @350) instead of frying. Will definitely make again, but maybe add some Dijon or red pepper flakes to give them a little kick. They work really well with the Creamy Dill Dipping Sauce from this site. Thanks for sharing...

I used panko crumbs as others suggested and it had a lovely crunch. I think it would be just as good (and much cheaper) with tuna instead. Definitely make a sauce!

I left out a few things. I did it old school and used what I had on hand. I used 1 egg, chopped red onion to taste, 1 TSP of blazin blends new orleans seafood and chicken seasoning (no salt or pepper was needed),about a TSP each of flour and cornmeal to hold it together for frying and then I rolled them in cornmeal and fried in olive oil until brown. I used seafood sauce and mustard separately to dip in on the side. I sometimes use hot sauce.  Thanks for the basics I had forgotten.

I used bread crumbs instead of wheat germ. I also used the salmon in a pouch, as opposed to canned and it was very fresh and tasty!

The taste was pretty good, but the problem was the consistency.  I couldn't form balls.  They kept falling apart, especially when I tried to roll them in the wheat germ.  I ended up sprinkling the wheat germ onto the mounds of the salmon mixture in the pan.  I'll probably try again, but add something more to get the mixture to stick together.

These are great! I don't like to review recipes if I don't make them exactly by the recipe but these were so delish I had to. The main difference was I didn't use any celery because I never had any. The other small changes I made are; 1/2 tsp of dry dill (I never had fresh I this was the perfect amount of dill flavor for us), I also added about 1 tsp of lime juice...I added this to make up for the 'fresh' flavor that the celery would have given it. I will definately use it again! 
Also, if you do not have wheat germ I suggest you buy some for these...besides the healthiness that it contributes, the flavor is amazing and I don't think anything else would be as good. It adds a wonderful toasted wheat and nutty type flavor...sooo good!
I served these with tarter sauce (a perfect compliment which I usually don't eat with salmon) and Seven Grains garlic quinoa and wild rice and zucchini. This turned out to be one of the best meals i've made in a long time so Thank You for this recipe!

First time ever making salmon patties, cakes, or croquettes and they were delicious. Made them pretty much as the recipe stated. I loved the dill and it definitely gave it some added flavor.

I used both fresh and canned salmon and added a 1/4 c. diced up capers in it. It turned out great and had plenty of flavor w/out the remoulade sauces.  
IT'S A KEEPER! THANKS!

These were very good and I've never been a fan of salmon before. I did substitute Old Bay seasoning for the garlic powder just cause I don't care much for strong garlic flavor and I used only egg whites and extra virgin olive oil to fry to make it more heart healthy.

My kids aren't fond of salmon patties, but if you roll into stick shapes you can call them fish sticks. I also have a fish shaped cookie cutter, which makes a fun shape for them.

I acutally had all of the ingrediants on hand; even the wheat germ.  I was a little leery of coating these in wheat germ since I didn't know how much of an impact they would have on the taste.  I used some roasted garlic fine herb bread crumbs instead.  However, I was still curious as to how the wheat germ would taste since I don't have a clue what made you decide to try it.  And to my surprise it was very tasty!  I also added some cayenne pepper to the mix for a little kick!  And I used grape seed oil.

They were very good. I thought the mixture was too wet at first and hard to hold together when rolling in the wheat germ, but they cooked fine.

These are wonderful. The recipe is very forgiving. I didn't have green onion or wheat germ, so I substituted minced onion and breadcrumbs. I made them into patties and fried in the olive oil.  They are even made better with the creamy dill dipping sauce from this site.

OK, but rather unexciting. I should have used a sauce to liven things up, I think. I did add some lemon zest to the mix, which I think generally improved overall flavor.

Deeeelish!  My husbandI is just home from surviving a heart attack  and we're looking for food that's fat free and low low calorie and sugar free  -- basically recipes that are healthy – heart healthy.  When I saw this recipe I couldn't wait to try it.   We just finished dinner !  My husband doesn't like salmon but he likes this. He cleaned his plate.   It was so scrumptious it was moist and tasty.  He wants to have it every week. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of doubling the recipe and baking it at 350° for 15 minutes. I am so grateful for this recipe it will be one of my "go to" meals from now own.

And I also sauted the celery and onions with salt and pepper.

These were really good!  I didn't have wheat germ, so I used crushed cracker crumbs.  Some croquettes I flattened more than others, and they turned out a tiny bit dry, whereas the thicker ones were perfect. The flavor was very good.

Most salmon patty recipes call for mixing all ingredients together at the same time. This is the first time I've made it that called for rolling the balls in the crumbs. I used Panko as that was all I had. Great idea. I am a texture person and if I don't like the texture I won't eat it.  Most times my patties seemed mushy.  This is much better. Thanks for giving me a new idea.

These turned out great! I made a few adjustments though. I used breadcrumbs instead of wheat germ ( I didn’t have any). I also added chopped onions and a squeeze of lemon juice to give them a little extra flavor. Thanks for the fast and easy recipe.

it was very good - not a 5 star since it was a canned salmon and it was not a complete meal so not STAR quality, but very good, my husband is fussy and he made it and enjoyed it and so did I - especially him cooking it!  Wonderful and enough for leftovers if you serve with a medium sized salad which we did

I'd forgotten that my Mom used to make salmon patties when we were growing up.  Recently, something reminded me of that and I checked out this recipe.  I made it exactly like the recipe with two additions:  about 2 Tablespoons of chopped onion and a little Adobo  seasoning.  Perfectly yummy!  I'll be making these again.

I didn't have some of the ingredients list such as fresh Dill and wheat germ, so I used dried Dill and some fresh parsley.  Instead of wheat germ, I used Ritz crackers.  I also added S&P.

Flavorful and easy to make, but did not hold together.  i had to add flour to get the ingredients to bind and I also had to flatten them into cakes.

My husband would not let me add the green onion or celery. I added salt and pepper. Instead of the wheat germ, I used crushed cornflakes. Next time I will remember to seriously squeeze out excess water from the salmon.

I love this recipe and so did my family... I made a small batch but wish I had more.  I had two 5oz packages of salmon,  I did not have green onions so I used regular vidalia, also no wheat germ so I substituted in Panko bread crumbs. Everything else I doubled up. My family was scraping the plate.

It's alright. I put panko in the food processor and used it in place of the wheat germ. I will have to tweak it a bit based on my family's pallet.

didnt have dill or wheat germ but good basic recipe! Used ritz crackers instead and as a seasoning I added a bit of lemon pepper. Some reason I also added a Tb of mayo (why not?) which made it a bit soupy to crumb in ritz but they held together better than I thought they would. Thanks

This recipe was great! I didn't have green onion, used finely chopped yellow, and I did a a little salt and pepper, but for having one can of salmon on hand and none of the usual ingredients that i usually use, this was awesome! 1 can serves two people. My husband LOVED it and I care more for what he thinks of what I cook.

Delicious!!  Doubled the recipe and ate over a bed of arugula with cucumber tomato salad as a side. Simple to make and quick.

Wow, this is so delish!
I used diced red onions instead of green onions. Didn't have dill so I used chopped fresh cilantro and a bit of dried oregano.
