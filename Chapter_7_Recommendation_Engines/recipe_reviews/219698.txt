For kelleyp, if you would have read the initial introduction by arbiesmith, you would know what to do with it.  Get out of the kitchen!!  This was good.

This sauce is a great complement to all summer vegetables, as well as chicken or beef. Great exactly as directed, it also lends itself easily to a multitude of slight substitutions. I omitted the Worcester sauce, instead adding fresh garlic & fresh mixed herbs, Dijon mustard and a splash of white wine. Instead of mashing by hand, I whipped it all together in my Ninja....adding just a drizzle of EVOO to emulsify. Delish! You can't go wrong either following the instructions verbatim, or playing with your personal favorite additions. A win!

This sauce would be good on just about anything, burgers, avocado, etc.

Delicious! Served with fresh green beans one day with company and grilled artichokes another. I used all the ingredients but a lot more of the seasonings, especially the horseradish and Worcestershire-probably tripled them. I didnâ€™t want it to taste like slightly seasoned mayo.
