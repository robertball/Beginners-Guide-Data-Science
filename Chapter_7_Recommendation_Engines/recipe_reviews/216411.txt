This is pretty good, but it's better with a few minor changes. First, season the fish with a little salt, pepper, onion powder, cumin, and garlic powder in addition to the chili powder. This brings out the fish flavor nicely. Remember it's a fish taco. You should taste the fish. 
 Next, the 1/4 cup of salsa that is mixed with the cabbage to make the slaw is enough. Adding extra salsa later will completely overpower the fish. 
  Also, not too much cheese. You only need a little bit, if any at all, too much will again overpower the fish flavor. 
  Only other thing I can add is to make sure the tortillas are hot. The total flavors just seemed to pop out better when they're really warm. 
  Lastly Don't use any cheap, flavorless, nasty fish like tilapia. For the love of life, use good fish. It makes a world of difference.

I have been making my fish tacos similar to this for years!  I do it a little different though.  First I make like a coleslaw with red & green cabbage, minced jalapeno, minced cilantro & shredded carrot, then I mix the salsa and sour cream in with a dash of lime juice.  I bake my fish and I sprinkle it with chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, a pinch of cayenne & salt, all to taste. Serve it with a little reduced-fat Mexican cheese blend and wrapped in a warmed corn tortilla.

Great, I did tweeck this a bit as I go with what I have available.
I used mango salsa, low carb tortillas, skipped the sour cream used halibut frozen fish filets and chopped them after I cooked them. no coleslaw mix or chili powder. They were great had them two nights in a row.

I would tweek this if I make again.  No need to use cabbage, lettuce will do.  Also, I baked the fish instead of frying it.

Every time I've had fish tacos in the past, it's always had a citrusy/fruity component. I didn't have anything on hand to make that work, but I did have the standard taco fillings around...so really, I was just glad to know that it was "acceptable" to eat fish tacos this way! I used mahi mahi and walleye (we preferred the meatier mahi over the flakier walleye). I also added a bit more seasoning (garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, S&P) and ended up having a scorching hot pan to blacken the mahi mahi; that was an unplanned addition of flavor! Other modifications: used shredded lettuce and flour tortillas. (If you haven't had uncooked tortillas that you just cook in a dry skillet for a few minutes...wow, they are SO good! They are available at CostCo by me. It says to not freeze, but I open the bags, separate each with wax paper, then freeze...for convenience. Works slick.)

For how quick, inexpensive, and easy these are, they are delicious! The only thing different I did was add thin-sliced red onion. The lime wedges say optional, but they are necessary! I also used really hot salsa, as we love spicy! This is going into the rotation.

Pretty good.  My husband and daughter (4) both loved it.  I used broccoli slaw instead of coleslaw and I added tomatoes too.

Kind of plain. Maybe better with spicier salsa.

This was good. I did a chicken version using the first reviewer's spice combo; I did it the second time using tilapia (which was VERY good).

Yum. I do think the cabbage mixture could easily be cut down because I had a quite a bit leftover. I seasoned the fish (I used tilapia) with cumin, garlic powder, sea salt, and fresh cracked black pepper along with the chili powder, so it was super flavorful. Only other change was to use olive oil. Super tasty; thank you! :)

I made this with tilapia and mahi mahi.  I couldn't task much difference.  Like others, I added some more spice to the fish (cumin and garlic).  This is definitely a recipe I will make again.

I have tried with with the suggestions of the reviews.   I used the new orleans cajun seasoning mix and cumin with the garlic and chili powder.   Delicious.  I think the 1/4 cup of salsa is perfect.   It will be a staple on our table.  Thanks
