This was wonderful!!  However, I thought I would try a ready graham cracker crust.  The crust burnt after baking just the rhubarb filling, so I quickly made a pie shell from scratch.  It was wonderful!!!  Just don't use the graham cracker pie shell.

Was very good, but I tried it with rhubarb that I had frozen and 3 cups of thawed rhubarb tends to be more than 3 cups of fresh rhubarb (cause the thawed rhubarb is more mushy and more fits in a cup) so there was too much rhubarb mixture and it overflowed the pie pan.  I had to scoop a third of it out so I could spread the cheesecake mixture on top.  Next time I'll use a deep dish pie crust if I use frozen rhubarb.  But, well worth the problems I had when making it!  It quickly became a family favorite!

I liked this recipe a lot!  The cheesecake topping is firm and a nice compliment to the tartness of rhubarb.  Try it when you are looking for something different to do with your rhubarb!   You won't be disappointed!

We really liked this pie. A nice twist to the classic rhubarb pie. I also made a crumb topping rhubarb pie at the same time. This rhubarb cheesecake pie is all gone. As i was eating the last piece, my 5 year old son said ...i thought that was for me.. so we split the last piece. We still have the crumb rhubarb pie in the fridge. I put the pie in the cool and it set much faster. Thanks for another great recipe.

It all came out perfect, including the crust. The cheesecake compliments the rhubarb nicely. I did reduce the sugar for the rhubarb to 1/2 cup and added vanilla extract to the cheesecake mixture. Great recipe; thanks for sharing!

this was good, I made it for a BBQ and got rave reviews, but it would be really really good if you made this pan style,with a thicker crust or crumble layer on the bottom and I think the rhubarb amount needs tweaking. Mine seemed a little corn starchy and I wish I'd added more rhubarb to the mixture. This is definitely the kind of recipe you can perfect to your own liking! Also, don't forget a vanilla whipped cream or ice cream for the side, it goes together perfectly.

Hmm...everything was fine until it was time to make the cheesecake part.  are you supposed to let the cream cheese get to room temperature or what?  and then, it almost overflowed.
ALSO.....  i didn't like baking the pie crust first, it got TOO brown for my taste.

other than that, tastes GREAT!!

Scrumptious taste. I had never eaten rhubarb before and therfore didn't have any expectations. I made my own crust and the only problem I had was that it definitely requires a deep pie crust. I had too much cheesecake batter and it ended up overflowing everywhere, but it was delicious!

I found that the rhubarb filling filled the crust more than half way so there wasn't enough "creaminess" - next time I will be sure to use only enough rhubarb for flavor and fill the rest with the cream topping

Was very disappointed.  The rhubarb was not sweet enough, and it is a great idea, but it just didn't taste that good.

What a great recipe.  To make it my own, I added whipped cream on top and then placed strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries on top.  Excellent with vanilla icecream.

This was good but different. I love the rhubarb mixture I could eat just that with a spoon, but I am not sure how I like it with cheesecake. I am glad I tried it but not sure I will make again. I dont think its nescesary to prebake the pie crust. If you are thinking about trying this recipe DO IT you will be glad you did.

I made two pies, this one and another from this site, "Rhubarb Crumble Pie." I liked the crumble pie better, but this one was very good as well. 

I cut down on the suguar, using 3/4 c with the rhubarb, and 1/4 c Splenda in the cheesecake. The rhubarb was a little on the tart side, but I didn't think the extra sugar was neccessary. It does help to have the cream cheese warmed up a bit. I put mine on top of the toaster oven while I melted butter for the other recipe. My crust did not get too brown, and I prebaked it for about 5 minutes.

This pie was pretty good.  It's not one of my favorites, though.  It's fairly easy, but kind of messy.

I combined this "pie" recipe with the Rhurbarb Cheesecake recipe on this site. Instead, I made a Graham cracker crust by combining a pkg of Graham crackers with one cube of butter. I put this in the bottom of the cheesecake pan and baked at 350 for 10 minutes. Then I added the pie filling from this recipe and topped it with the sour cream topping from the cheesecake recipe. YUM!

Awesome stuff people! Since I'm horrible at following directions, I made a few adjustments. Shortbread pie crust( 1 cup butter, 1/2 cup powdered sugar, 2cup flour. Pressed into pan and baked until browned about 12 min @ 350*).  I also substituted 1 cup of strawberries in. And finally I added a teaspoon of Almond extract to the cheesecake layer. I've made 3 of these and if you don't use a deep dish pie pan and use just a regular pan you can make 2, yes 2, pies off this recipe and they are still fantastic!

This was great!  I used a pre-made shortbread crust and I had to cover it when it was baking, it was getting too brown.  It was great though, I cook for my two single neighbor guys and they loved it.  Thanks.
