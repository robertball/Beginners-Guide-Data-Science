This is great! I usually make a large batch of my special pizza sauce and freeze it in containers. I ran out so I tried this one, and I like it just as well as my home made sauce that takes a long time just simmmering. Thanks!

This worked perfectly for being in the bind I was in. I had just offered to make my daughter some English muffin pizzas for a Saturday night snack when I remembered pizza sauce was on the grocery list because we were out. I had already locked into the offer and she was looking forward to it, so I came here for quick help. All I did was add a pinch of salt and garlic powder. It fit the bill. I will use this recipe again as it is convenient and more economical than store bought sauce.

I thought this was simple and easy. I didn't have everything so this is what I did. 1t of honey instead of sugar. Instead of Italian seasoning I used oregano, coriander and parsley. I also added minced garlic. So good we were even dipping veggies in it! I will make this again and again!

This was so easy to make.   Very easy on the stomach if you are one with those issues. Husband really liked the mildness of it. Made the day before so spices could marry.

wow, this was surprisingly good for how simple it is. I used a 28oz can of crushed tomatoes, then roughly tripled the rest of the ingredients. 
next time, I think I'll use a little less sugar. other than that, it was great!!

Ive made this twice so far. The first time I made it as written and it was delicious! I made it a second time but added fresh garlic and some pepper. YUM! Im happy to say I will not be buying the already made sauce anymore.

This recipe has most of the flavors my family likes! I doubled the recipe for more pizza, added 1 clove minced garlic, and maybe 2 teaspoons of Parmesan cheese to suit our tastes. Big hit, it's now my go-to recipe for fast pizza sauce!

This sauce turned out great! I added a little parmesan after that fact, but actually think I liked it better without. Why have I been buying pizza sauce for all these years when making your own is SO easy and tastes better?

This tasted great! It was super easy, and all we changed was not adding onion.

This is really easy and perfect for when you are in a time bind.   It isn't the very best sauce I have had but the kids liked it and there were certainly no complaints.  For ease alone, this is a keeper.
