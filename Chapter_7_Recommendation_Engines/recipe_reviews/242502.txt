The family wasn't too crazy over this recipe. I will admit that I made these indoors in a cast iron skillet so that could be the difference.

LOVED these!  Stick to the grilling time listed - the ones we grilled longer were still amazing but not as good as the ones that were only grilled 3 minutes each side.
