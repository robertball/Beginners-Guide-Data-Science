I cannot stand when someone adds sweet to Green tea. I have spent three years and Japan loving the fact I could drink real green tea without some berry, honey or some other sweetener added. If you do not add the honey it does not take away from the natural sweetness of the Matcha. It took me awhile to get used to how sweet Matcha is but I love it and to add honey would just take it beyond sweet. Try it first without the honey, trust me.. you will be pleasantly surprised!

I tried this and it was great! Matcha powder can be expensive but well worth it for recipes like this. I had the Matcha latte with some match chocolate cake and it was delicious.

I make this at least 3 times a week and to me it's better without the honey ! I'd say try it without the honey and see how you like it first !

i make this all the time, but i usually don't add water. if you have coconut syrup lying around try adding that instead of honey.

This was okay, the water:milk ratio is off and like another reviewer commented, it is very watery. Though it makes for a refreshing summer drink. But if you're looking more for an iced matcha green tea latte that you can find from a coffee shop, this isn't it. I probably wouldn't make this again.

I made the latte with green tea powder that didn't specify whether or not it was matcha. Would it have a different taste than matcha powder?
