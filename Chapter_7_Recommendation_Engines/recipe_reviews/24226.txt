Good base recipe, you can definitely make your own modifications.  I add about half a cup of dry red wine.  I also boil my water first and then add about four beef bullion cubes (instead of granules), get a broth going, and then stir in a few tablespoons of cold water whisked with a few tablespoons of cornstarch (instead of tapioca).  This mixture gives me a nice gravy base to start off with. In the meantime I brown my beef (tossed with flour, garlic and onion powders, salt, and pepper) in a large saucepan (pot).  Once it has browned I pour a little more red wine in the pot to loosen up the brown bits on the bottom (that's where the good flavor comes from), and then toss in my 'gravy' mixture and the canned tomatoes.  I actually drain about half the liquid out because I add more water later.  I then add all my vegetables...potatoes, celery, carrots, onions, peas...and then I add some addtional salt, garlic and onion powder, and some a few teaspoons of minced garlic (I looooove garlic) and just a pinch of sugar.  I then add just enough water to cover the food, stir it up, bring to a slow boil, and then reduce heat to a nice simmer.  I leave it on the stove for about an hour and then transfer to the oven for about another hour, or until the meat is tender.  It's important to have enough liquid to cover your entire dish or it will come out dry and your meat will not be very tender.

This is a great recipe!  However I did use some of the suggestions of the other reviewers.  Definitely use a few tablespoons of cornstarch with a few tablespoons of cold water instead of the tapioca.  I've used tapioca in the past (because that was what my mom used), but the stew gravy always seemed to have little geletin like dots in it--corn starch leaves it nice and creamy.  I dredged my meat in flour, garlic and onion powders, pepper, and salt by combining all ingredients in a plastic bag with the meat and shaking it.  Then I browned the meat in a cast iron pot, took out and set aside.   Added about 4 cups of water with 4 bullion cubes and brought to a boil.  Added can of diced tomatoes, garlic powder, 2 cloves of fresh minced garlic, a little salt, sugar, corn starch and cold water mixture, and made my gravy being sure to dredge up the bits and pieces left over from the meat in the bottom of the pan.   Then I returned the meat to the pot and added the vegetables (which I chopped up while the meat was browning).    After adding everything, I noticed that I needed more liquid to cover everything up.  I used about 1/2 box of beef broth (the kind that you can store in your fridge and use as needed instead of being stuck with 1/2 a can), but you should use just enough to cover up all your meat and veggies.  Then I put into the oven for 3 hours at 325 degrees, and it was just perfect yummy.

Wow! This stew had a wonderful flavor. It was a big hit with my family. I did make a couple of substitutions: flour instead of tapioca, and onion soup mix instead of chopped onion. It was delicious. I will definitely make this again. From now on, however, I will leave out the cubed bread. I didn't care for the texture of it when cooked. Otherwise, it was excellent.

This was the best beef stew I ever made.  I did tweak it a little bit. Since most stews are fairly bland, I started by first dredging the beef in flour mixed with salt, pepper, Italian seasoning, onion and garlic powders. I browned it in a cast iron dutch oven. I then took out the beef and added some beef bullion (mixed 1 1/2c. hot water w/3 beef bullion cubes) to loosen the baked on bits. I then added back the meat, 1 can beef broth,1 can tomatoes, the remaining bullion, 3 T. of corn starch with cold water, and all the veggies, omitted the celery (none on hand)and bread (forgot). I cooked in the oven, stirring occasionally, for 3 hours. 
My youngest son who hates onions ate 2 huge bowls. This is definetly a keeper!

A direct quote from my husband - "BEST STEW I HAVE EVER HAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"  No kidding.  I loved it too because the taste was fantastic and it was SO easy to make!  I did substitute 1/4C water mixed with 3T cornstarch because I didn't have any tapioca and it certainly did the trick.  This recipe will definitely be a staple meal with our winter comfort foods!

THis was an excellent stew!  I usually make my stew in the crock pot, so something from the oven was a nice change.

I lightly tossed the meat with garlic salt, onion powder and flour then browned it.  I substituted 3T of cornstartch in 1/4 cup of water for the tapioca, and I used a can of beef broth in place of the water and bullion because these were the things I had on hand.

This was the first time I ever "baked" stew and it was fantastic!!! I altered the recipe a little and this is what I did...
I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes with juice and then filled the can with water and added that too. I added 2 beef bouillon cubes (crushed) and 1 envelope of onion soup mix. Lastly, I added 1/2 cup of Ketchup.  I left out the celery and the bread and used "Wondra" in place of the tapioca.
Doing this left plenty of thick delicious gravy!!!  YUM!  Make with plenty of biscuits for dipping!

This is a very good beef stew recipe. I am now going to use this as my go to beef stew recipe from now on. Everyone loved this from husband to teenager to toddler. After reading other reviews I made a few modifications. First, I used 1 can of stewed tomatoes, 2 cloves of minced garlic, and instead of the water, I used approx. 2 cups of beef broth. I was surprised at how delicious this was, seemed pretty simple to taste so good! We had an unusually cold day here and this yummy beef stew was just the comfort food we needed!

All I can say is DELISH!!! I read all the reviews and used alot of the modifications.  I used beef broth instead of water, onion soup mix, and reduced the salt.  I floured the beef and then browned it, which thickened the sauce, therefore not needing the tapioca.  The entire family loved the stew and it was sooooo tender.  I will definately use this recipe for years to come.

This was a really good recipe.  Two of my kids (who never eat stew) surprised me by eating this stew and liking it.  I used tapioca flour and added the potatoes only for the last hour in the oven.  I also omitted the bread.During cooking, the taste seemed to lack something, so I put in 1 tsp. Montreal Steak Spice and 1 tsp. Worcestershire.  Definitely a keeper

I run a daycare in my home so I decided to make it for kids' lunch today. I only use the potatoes (tripled the amount), since not all like cooked celery and carrots. I did not have dice tomatoes so I just used a can of tomato paste. I browned the meat (put some flour on it first) in coconut oil, and baked all in pyrex glass pan with aluminum foil as a cover. After we came back from our morning walk, the kids commented on how nice the house smells! They each had a big portion and loved it, the meat was sooo tender. This recipe will become part of my daycare menu for sure!

I just made this tonight.  It was REALLY good and really filling.  I have to say that I had over 3lbs of meat so I had to use two corningware dishes.  However, I seasoned flour and browned the meat in batches before combining it with the veggies.  I deglazed the brown bits with beef stock.  I actually had to use a box of beef broth and two cans of diced tomatoes but I did use a lot of carrots, etc. to balance the amound of beef I used.    I baked everything for almost three hours.  After removing it from the oven I added the corn starch slurry and it thickened even more.    Very delicious!

I substitute the tapioca for 3 tbsp of flour and it is great.  Be sure to stir once in a while to help each piece of meat get coated.  You will love this recipe!

This stew is great. This was my first ever baked stew. I hesitated with this one because I always slow cooked my stews and I was afraid that the meat would not be tender. Boy was I wrong. This  was one of the best stews i have made and everything was tender. I did use starch, instead of the topcia. The gravy was smooth and the flavor was great. This meal is a keeper.

An excellent baked beef stew recipe!  The first time I prepared this dish exactly as written.  It was really very, very good!  After that, I did modify it slightly to suit my personal taste, making it a 5 star recipe!  But I don't believe you should give a review on a recipe that has been changed.  Therefore, the 4 stars is for THIS recipe!  Thanks for sharing it Diane!

Both my husband and I loved this recipe! I only had 1 lb. of meat which was just right for the 2 of us so I cut recipe in half. I did add a little garlic, worchestershire and dried rosemary to the sauce and dredged and browned the meat first. oh yes, I left out the bread. I can't have it and didn't seem like soggy bread was a good fit for us. Will definitely make again!

I made this during a recent snowstorm.  What a great warm comfort food meal.  I added in some corn and peas, but other than that I made it as listed.  It was really good with a loaf of crusty french bread.  We had enough for leftovers and it might have been even better the second time.

I really liked this, and it was pretty easy, but I wish I had NOT taken reviewers' suggetion to dredge the meat in flour first - I didn't like the consistency of the gravy with that addition. Next time I will brown the meat with spices (not as much black pepper next time) and just add a little more cornstarch to the gravy to thicken it - it didn't need as much water as I thought, either (I like a thicker oven stew).  But overall we were very pleased!

Baked 350 covered for about 3 hours.  I also added some left over mushrooms I had on hand.  As one reviewer suggested, make sure there is enough liquid.  I added a little more water and beef granules to cover. Turned out delicious with a lot of good flavor.

I loved this stew and would personally give it 5 stars, but my husband thought my other recipe is better, so I compromised with 4. I love being able to stick it in the oven and forget it, and somehow I like the texture of the meat better than my crock pot recipe. Like others, I like the corn starch substitution. Try this recipe and figure out what tweaking your family prefers - you won't regret it!

Just may be the best entree recipe I've pulled off this site. We've made it several times and it never disappoints. Great for these days with snow on the ground.

Just finished making this and boy does my house smell good. This is my first time making stew from scratch and this will be my go to recipe. The only change I made was I used flour instead of tapioca and beef stock instead of water. I also added a dash of red wine. Gotta go eat now :)

This beef stew is delicious, especially the second day after the flavors meld together.  I will definitely make it again!  I followed the recipe closely however I did make a few minor changes.  I sauteed the beef in a small amount of olive oil with freshly minced garlic which added additional subtle flavor.  Rather than use a tablespoon of beef bouillon granules, I used Better than Boullillon beef base that comes in a jar purchased from the supermarket.  It has a more concentrated flavor providing a more full bodied sauce with a touch of kick to it.  No celery on hand and I deliberately omitted the bread, neither of which were missed.

excellent! meat was very tender...although i didn't have tapioca. instead i seasoned the meat w/ salt and pepper, then rolled it in cornstarch and browned it. it won't get as thick as it would with tapicoa, but it makes a decent substitute.

I have made the stew several times and we love it every time! Everyone who tries it now makes it themselves. The only changes I make are that I use a good cut of beef, like boneless sirloin and I omit the bread. I use the tapioca and think it works fine.

This was wonderful. I added some extra spices like others suggested. I did use broth instead of water. The next time I make it.......I will make the cubes/cuts of meat smaller and addd more broth. Easy to make.......everyone loved it.

I loved this stew.  I added some garlic powder and used cornstarch instead of tapioca.  I added a can of beef broth to top off the veggies since I cut up a bit more than called for.  Topped with a few drops of soy sauce for color and flavor.  I also baked slowly (4 hrs.) at 325 degrees.  The beef melted in your mouth and the veggies were just right.  I will definitely repeat this stew.  Delicious!

My niece told me about this recipe.  She said it was the best beef stew she'd ever had.  I made it for a party I was having and it did not disappoint!  It was fantastic!  I baked it in my crockpot insert, then after baking it, I kept it warm for the party by using the crockpot!  I will not be making beef stew any other way again!

I only gave this four stars because the stew beef, I used cubed chuck, did not come out tender as I thought it would.  I think possibly I browned it too long.  The next time I make this, and I will certainly make it again, I will try putting the meat in the casserole in its "raw" state.  When I make my stovetop receipe, this is how I do it, and Inever have a problem with tenderness.  With that said, this stew is delicious, I may have just screwed the meat up a bit.  Thanks for the recipe.

I coated the beef meat in seasoned flour (cajun seasoning, garlic powder, old bay, onion powder, paprika, thyme, romemary, and a few other random seasonings).  I also used cornstarch because I didn't have any tapioca as well as using beef broth instead of granules and water.  we love garlic so I added garlic to the vegetables.  I forgot to add the bread but still delicious!!

Excellent. Hubby said it was the best beef stew that he could remember ever having. Made the following changes suggested by others: 1) used a can of beef broth in place of water and beef bouillion granules. 2) used a few tbsp of cornstarch in a few tbsp of water instead of the tapioca. 3) omitted the sugar. 4) added onion soup mix in place of the onion. 5) omitted the slice of bread. 6) added 1/4 cup of red wine. 7) did not brown the meat before adding.

We absolutely loved it!  I sprinkled lots of black pepper and garlic powder on my meat then dusted it with flour.  I browned it first, then added the veggies and covered with beef stock.  I simmered for about 90 minutes on medium low (my oven isn't working).  Everyone loved it!

I have made a lot of beef stew in my life, but none as good as this. I added a few herbs, and fresh leeks. it needed to cook to long for the liquid so I added a cup,of broth, but pretty much kept to the recipe. It's rich and full,of flavor. it's my recipe for stew from now on. Thanks

This recipe is the one that my Mom baked for us and the one I bake for my family, now 45 years later...grinding the instant tapioca into a very fine powder gives a much better texture to the stew, which is simply  good, homemade comfort food...round this off with biscuits and apple pie and I am home again!!

WOW!  I made this recipe because I was snowed in and thought I would try something new.  I invited the two widows that live in the apartments on either side of me for dinner and both RAVED about this.  They said its the best stew they ever had!  -- That being said I made a few minore changes.  I did flour and brown my meat in a dutch oven that I baked the stew in.  I also left the bread out (I forgot)  Still, this was an amazing stew.  Anyone who reads this should give it a try.  You wont be sorry!

Wow.  I cooked exactly as the recipe stated, even though I had to hunt through Krogers to find instant tapioca.   I was a bit skeptical about the sugar as an ingredient, but the taste and texture of the final product was wonderful.   Rave reviews from all diners -- they liked the unique qualities that come from baking.  I think the the carrots had a particularly good flavor, a sweetness that I haven't tasted in a beef stew before.   I'm sure the suggested  modifications all add interesting aspects to this recipe, but try it at least once just as it is presented.  It's great.

This is fabulous!  I used 2 cans of beef broth and 4 T. cornstarch instead of water, beef granules, and tapioca.  I also decreased the salt to 1 tsp. and omitted the bread. The flavor was wonderful! My husband loves it.

Loved it! Didn't have beef broth so I used a can of Campbells Onion Soup. Added it to the water, tomatoes, cornstarch and vegetables. Baked it in a cast iron pot for about 1hr 40 min. Beef was tender, sauce was delicious and just thick enough. I used carrots, potatoes, mushrooms and a yam. No onion because I used the onion soup. Will definitely make many times again.

Loved that it tasted fantastic without the 'browning the meat' step. I doubled the recipe with great success. Just added some dried rosemary and thyme and I'm definitely making this one again!

I took the advice of others & made a few changes. First I dredged my beef in a flour/salt/pepper mixture, then I browned it in a Dutch oven in 1/4 c. peanut oil. I set the meat aside, then added 1 c. water & 1 tbsp. beef base to the drippings in the Dutch oven & deglazed it. Then I added my onions, & cooked them down for ~15 minutes along w/ half a packet of Lipton's Onion Soup mix. Then I put in the rest of my ingredients: can of tomatoes, 5 golden potatoes, 4 stalks of celery, 3 cut up carrots, my beef bits, & a lot more water, plus cornstarch in COLD water once my 'soup' got hot. I'm not sure how much water--just keep adding it & making sure ALL your ingredients are sunk in the water throughout the cooking process! Things will cook down & you will be able to quit adding more water at some point, but don't be stingy with it. I did not use tapioca (though I would have if I had some) & I would never put bread in it. I added 2 cloves of garlic, minced, & would add more in the future; I also added a lot of black pepper & would add more of that, too, in the future. I thought this had a great flavor, reminiscent of my mom's, though I think in the future I will have to also add some tomato paste to make it even more like my mom's. If you find it too salty, the problem likely lies in the bouillon, beef broth, soup base, Lipton's mix, and V-8 you're using--all these things contribute a LOT of salt, so keep that in mind :)

Husband who's a stew snob LOVED this!  And my 1 year old ate 2 bowls! I did make a few changes based on other's reviews---dredged meat in flour mixed with garlic and onion powder before browning. used 3T cornstarch with 1/4 cup water instead of tapioca, used 2 cups beef stock and added 1/4 cup red wine instead of water and boullion-.  used 2 5.5 oz cans tomato juice instead of tomatoes, skipped the bread and added 2 garlic cloves.  Cooked 325 for 3 hours.

This was soooo good. Such great comfort food. I used corn starch as the thickening agent and cooked it at 325 for 3 hours. Used canned beef stock and a little extra water, as well as some minced garlic while i browned the beef. Such a great meal, with fresh 12 grain loaf.

Great & tasty meal! I was intrigued by the recipe to "bake" beef stew and using the ingredient - instant tapioca. My tweeking was to put stewing beef in ziplock bag and add flour & spices (rosemary, thyme, etc.) to the bag to coat beef stew before browning it. Used olive oil to brown meat along with some of the chopped onions and some crushed garlic (about 2 cloves). I used beef stock, this is what I had but would use the stock or beef broth instead of water. When mixing everything together I used about a tablespoon of Worchester Sauce and a little shy of 1/2 teaspoon of Kitchen Boquet (I use this when making brown gravy). I did not add the bread.  Other than that I followed the original recipe with fantastic results.

I used 3TB cornstarch and just dissoved it in the broth added another cup since it all looked dry (didn't have bullion). I added fresh sliced mushrooms and garlic. Let me tell you! It smelled incredible baking although it looked a bit suspicious at first. My husband is completely spoiled and always has a suggestion on how I could have made it better or just be a food critic. He ate 2/3 in one sitting. Left me a bowl. So satisfying and hearty. Delicious! You cannot go wrong here people. The beef was ever so tender. Needless to say I shined...for once.

Hey - this is the submitter.  :)

There shouldn't be any tapioca balls if you use INSTANT tapioca.  Check the box to be sure.  At least, it's never happened to me!  :)

Easy to make and very good.  However, I didn't use onions and put fresh sliced mushrooms in.  I also added an extra cup of water with boullion and it turned out great!

Followed the recipe exactly & turned out to be a weirdly sweet tasting stew :(  I don't think instant tapioca is a good blend for stew and the bread chunks ended up very soggy.

This is a great recipe. Try these modifications: Take 1/2 cup flour & add black pepper, steak seasoning, garlic powder. Mix with cubed steak & brown in a skillet. Remove from pan. Add to the pan the tomatoes,water,bouillon,sugar, & tapioca & bring to a boil.  I added more beef broth & then a can of cream of mushroom soup. Then mix with veggies & meat & bake.  It was great!!!

This was really, really wonderful. I used 1 1/2 Tbsp of cornstarch instead of tapioca, and used probably 3 1/2 cups of beef broth. Added lots of ground pepper & garlic powder to the beef when it was browning, and chopped up three cloves of garlic and threw those in there, too. The meat wasn't as tender as I like it to be but the flavor of this stew was awesome! Possibly the best tasting stew I have ever had.

after following the directions of the other members *leave out the bread an use cornstarch instead* this was perfect! i added a little extra garlic cuz i just love it and a bit of red cooking wine when browning the meat.  after an hour and a half in the stove the meat would fall apart if i stuck a fork in it! LOVE LOVE LOVE! 
ps 
DO NOT leave out the onion, it really gives it such a nice flavor!

I would give this 5 stars but I changed it up quite a bit so only 4.  I seasoned some flour with salt, pepper & garlic powder in a plastic gallon size bag.  I then tossed the stew meat in there and coated well.  I heated about 4 T. of oil in my large oven proof skillet and sauted the beef.  I removed the beef just when brown and added the carrots, celery, potatoes & onions and sauted in the drippings for 2-3 minutes, scraping the bottom of the skillet.  I then added the tomatoes and the stew meat back in.  I then added enough homemade beef broth to cover, put a lid on it and put in the 375 oven.  After about 1 1/2 hours I checked it and most of the liquid was gone so added more beef broth.  Baked another hour and it came out perfect.  The meat so tender, the potatoes & carrots held together nicely.  I will surely make this again this winter.

I loved this. I completely forgot to add the onion and it was still fantastic. Since I had it on hand, I used tapioca, and it was a great consistency. I did not add the cubed bread, because that didn't sound good to me. I would definitely make this again, it was full of flavor. I don't think this recipe needs as much reworking as some others have suggested, it's really good as is.

I think this is a great recipe!  I've done a little bit of tweaking to perfect it.  1) Instead of using the beef boullion, I get a container of beef broth.  After I put in all of the items in my cooking pan, I cover everything in beef broth.  I try to ensure that all the meat is fully covered in broth.  This way, the meat comes out tender.
2) Since I'm adding in so much broth, I usually add an additional tablespoon of tapioca so the broth thickens.
3) We like tomatoes.  I use about 1.5 cans of tomoates instead of 1.
4) Celery seems kind of sparse as the recipe is written.  I usually cut up a couple more stalks.

I left out the sugar and instead of water I used real beef stock that I'd made and put in the freezer earlier.
It had a robust full flavor.

This was great! I brown the meat with red wine. I also took the advice of a reviewer and made a broth with 4 bullion cubes and a cup of water and added some cold water whisked with cornstarch. It made a really yummy gravy and gave some good flavor.

Otherwise, I follow the recipe exactly. My husband asks for it at least once a month.

The flavor was really good, and even better on the next day.  However, next time I will cook it in the slow cooker.  The tip of some of the beef was dried out because there was not enough liquid to submerge them in, even though I used twice as much canned tomato and increased the water amount.  I also added extra sugar to counter the extra tomato.

This is wonderful! I used flour instead of tapioca. I also omitted the celery and onions because my husband won't eat them. I followed the advice of others and left out the bread. My husband and I both really enjoyed this recipe although we prefer to have more liquid. I may make some adjustments next time.

Tried this last night and LOVED IT!   I made a couple of changes:   left out the potatoes because I wanted to try the tapioca - enough starch - but liked what the tapioca did for the recipe.   Also left out the sugar and added 3 cloves of chopped fresh garlic.   Baked it in my cast iron dutch oven with the lid on and it was yummy!   Suzie, Oneonta, AL

I've made this many times with great results. I leave out the bread slices though. I also season my meat with pepper, garlic powder and salt when browning. Then I add a li'l more garlic and seasonings like thyme to the batch before baking. Delicious!

I loved how easy this was. I suppose I could have used a slow cooker but two hours is faster. I didn't have carrots or celery so I added a can of cream of celery soup. Fantastic idea! Didn't add the sugar, bread or tapioca. It just isn't necessary. Added my own spices to taste and did take the reviewer suggestion to add one teaspoon Worcestershire sauce. Will make again and again. delicious!

This is my favorite beef stew recipe.  The only thing I change is I substitute the water with a can of beef broth and I only cook it for 1 1/2 hours. I prefer this method over cooking in the crock pot. Thanks for the great dinner!

Delicious and easy! There was a lot of flavour in this dish.  I definitely would make it again, however I would change one thing.  I didn't like the chunks of bread in it.  They got really soggy and my guests were asking "What's that slimy stuff"  haha.  Other than that, it's a great dish.

this was very simple and had good flavors.What was nice is that you put it in the oven so you didnt have to mess with it. Although i did add more broth from the very start.

This was the greatest stew I have ever made==thanks to the recipe! We loved it at our house. It tasted so different baked in the oven and I never would have thought of it. I also tweaked it a bit: added 1 medium onion chopped, 6 oz of Portabella mushrooms, frozen string beans. I left out the tapioca, but found a McCormick Beef Stew packet and added that with more water. It was so good. My son came over and he helped my husband and I finish the entire thing!!

This is really good and very easy -- we've made it several times.  I follow the recipe exactly, except I add about three slices of chopped day-old bread (instead of one), which really helps to thicken the sauce without all of the hassel of adding cornstarch or flour.  We also occasionally add a handful of corn.

This recipe is easy to let cook on a Saturday. I probably will make it again. I used some extra spices - garlic, sage and rosemary.  That's only because I have them in my garden.  I did not have any bouillon so I just used the extra broth from cooking the meat and it worked well. Makes a nice home-cooked meal.

My mother used to make this stew which she called "French Beef Stew".  I lost her recipe and then found this one, which is her exact recipe.  I just made it for 50 people for a church dinner and got nothing but rave reviews.  I had several people comment that it was the best beef stew they've ever eaten.

This recipe is excellent.  I followed it exactly.  I did not have any 'small tapioca balls' that others have mentioned, I think because I pulled the stew out of the oven after an hour and stirred it up good, re-covered and baked for another hour. I served it with a good, hearty bread.

Excellent Stew Recipe. Easy and turned out perfect.  I used beef broth instead of the water and beef granules, threw in some minced garlic and used cornstarch instead of instant tapioca - no bread either.  WONDERFUL!

I used the quick cook tapioca and it worked fine - no lumps noted. I used a jar of my canned tomato juice in place of the canned tomatoes w/juice;and left over beef broth for the water. I also added fresh garlic to the beef when browning. It turned out very good, my whole family ate it including my two picky eaters. The only problem was it was a little too salty for my taste. Next time I will cut back on the salt.

I followed the recipe just as is... although with fresh tomatoes a plenty I cut up fresh tomatoes instead of using canned and added a cup of tomatoe juice for added flavor... umm... ummm... good!!
Just as a note my meat was frozen so I just threw it all in the oven at only 300 and let it cook 7 hrs as I projected... stiring once during that time & cutting meat off the soup bone.

Followed suggestions of others, used slow cooker, floured the beef instead of using tapioca or corn starch, doubled the vegetables. I was a little concerned that the veg were sitting two inches above the liquid line, so I also added a small tin of V8 Juice and 1/4 cup of red wine....left it for the day. After 8 hours on 'combined high/low' setting, we had a wonderful enjoyable meal, in a bowl, served with garlic bread...yummm.

I had already started to use my new slow cooker so I just followed the recipe except I used flour and beef base that I send away for.  It tasted like beef from expensive restaurants. I followed everything else exactly.  It was just what I was looking for. Yeh! Everyone loved it! Thank you, thank you thank you!!!

AWESOME! We just finished dinner and although my 15 year old son picked at his bowl, my husband and I, ate every last bite! He fixed his corn bread that no one can touch, and we really enjoyed the whole meal. The only things I did differently, was when I was frying my meat, I added some pepper, salt, garlic and onion powder to it. I also used 3 Tblsp. of corn starch instead of the tapioca and added one can of peas. I used 3 beef boulin cubes and instead of one cup of water, I added 3 cups. However, I completely forgot to add the slice of bread and would really like to know what it is added for because this was perfect! Thanks for the recipe!

Oh my God.  This is SO GOOD!!!!!  I've never made a beef stew before; this was my first.  I only used 1lb of cubed beef stew, 5 celery stalks, 4 potatoes, and 1 (28oz) can of plum tomatoes, diced.  I increased the amount of beef bouillon to 3 heaping tsps, 6 heaping tsps of flour, and some Italian seasoning.  I baked this for 1hr  45min (I couldn't wait!) and it was peeerfect! The sauce was pretty thick but good, nonetheless.  Will be making this again!

I was very skeptical as to how this would turn out but must say it is very tasty! I think I would cut down on the salt next time as it was a bit too salty for me and also agree with everyone else about the liquid. I added two extra cups of water. 
Also replaced tapioca with flour.

We didn't follow the recipe exactly. I added a little red wine after browning the beef. And when I went to the pantry for a can of tomatoes I could only find a can of tomatoes with green chilies. Turns out that added just the right amount of spicy.  So good even my picky three year old ate it all up.

Very delicious and easy to prepare. I thought this was a little too salty, but that could just be from the bouillon too. If I make this again I will cut the amount of salt. Other than that very delicious, and I served with freshly baked rolls. YUM!

I had 3 lbs of beef so adjusted the recipe accordingly and baked in a 9x13 roaster. No instant tapioca so stirred in cornstarch/water near the end, used Better than Boullion rather than granules. I don't think the sugar was necessary, I did need to add more water as the stew baked, more tomatoes would have been a good idea. I've never baked a stew before, it's great if you can't be bothered babysitting it on the stove, so thanks for this recipe Diane. I have since tried a few of my own versions, my favorite so far: sauteed the veg first, didn't brown the meat (to my surprise,I couldn't tell the difference), more tomatoes, combo of ale and water for the liquid, seasoned w/thyme, bay leaves, steak seasoning, uncovered the stew for the last half hour.

This is a great stew recipe. I took the advice of the other commenters and substituted beef broth for water and bouillon cubes, and three tbs of corn starch for tapioca. I also added a tbsp of garlic. And substituted frozen peas for celery. The doused it all with red wine and sprinkled with Worchestershire sauce. But it was awesome. Tender, with a lovely favour. It is not the traditional stew my mom used to make. But it will be made over and over again in this house.

Whole family loved this, even my picky ten year old; he practically inhaled it!  I took several modifications from previous reviews.  Left out the celery & carrots, used 4 palm sized potatoes.  Browned the stew beef in a dry non-stick fry pan after tossing with flour, onion powder and garlic powder in a ziplock. Removed beef from pan and placed in a greased 9x13 baking dish as directed.  Then took advice from a great review and dissolved a beef boullion cube in boiling water, added to the pan in order to loosen all of the bits from the pan and poured it over the beef.  Also, tomatoes add lovely color and taste, but I think next time I will use crushed tomatoes since 1 kid "thinks" he hates them.  Threw two slices of bread in there and instead of tapioca blended 3Tbs cornstarch and cold water.  Covered with foil, cooked 2 hours, or actually, after 1.5 hours, I turned the oven down to 275 and cooked an extra 2.5 hours (had to let the kids enjoy the blizzard!) Came out delicious.  Only problem....not enough leftovers!

We loved this beef stew, easy to make and takes no time at all.  I made it with chicken using chicken broth instead of beef.  My husband loved it too.

Made this in my cast iron dutch oven. Followed recipe with addition of tips from other reviewers. Used cornstarch instead of tapioca, used the red wine and a pckt. of onion soup mix. I also added 2 cans of diced petite tomatoes and minced garlic. 350 for 1 hour and 325 for 2 hours. It was soooo yummmy!!! Thanks for a good basic and the review tips.

added plain flour instead of tapioca, and dried herbs for seasoning. Wonderfully tender, lovely gravy. Good substitute for when you don't own a slow cooker.

Amazing - everyone took seconds!  I dredged the meat in flour as suggested and also used cornstarch instead of tapioca.  Instead of heating up the oven, I cooked it in the slow cooker on low for about 6 1/2 hours.  This was delicious and I will definitely make it again!

Made this for lunch today, I got up,chopped the veggies up,only changes were that I made,it called for 4 carrots only had two and half a bag of shredded and added on the liquid! it needed way more liquid than called for but you know what? I popped it in the oven at 7:30,I left for church about 10 until 10, left my mother in charge, she had to put it in the slow cooker and it finally got done, it was a good recipe for the most part but I'm thinking I'm going back to a basic, old fashioned recipe.

I always double the recipe and bake it in my biggest lasagna pan.  Family loves it. Great for winter. I add more carrots and cut the beef in bigger chunks.  It's my permanent beef stew recipe.

Awesome! We used tomatoes with green chilies to give the stew a subtle kick. Had to add quite a bit of liquid and cook time was more like 4 hours. Great recipe!

I must concur that this Baked  Beef Stew is the ABSOLUTE BEST by far!!! The only things I changed was the beef bouillon to beef broth & corn starch in place of the tapioca mix. This recipe is a winner for the entire family...Thanx

I would give this 10 stars if possible. This was good for a basic stew. Baked was something absolutely new to me. First off, when I make it again, and I will be making it again, I think I may leave out the cornstarch/water that I used instead of tapioca and add an extra can of Beef broth (used in place of beef granules) My fiance and I thought it was a bit too thick. I placed flour, salt, pepper, garlic salt, and tony's seasoning in a ziplock bag and shook it up with the meat before browing. The flour on the meat with do enough as far as thicking it out. Also I didnt use any celery (didnt have any) and added mushrooms and green beans. followed cooking directions to a T. Overall was wonderful!

The best beef stew!  I always had trouble with getting my stew to the right consistency.  It usually was too watery!  This was perfect! I coated my beef with flour then browned it on the stove.  I then added a can of beef broth to the pot and scraped up all the drippings.  I poured this into an oven bag and skipped the water, didn't add the sugar or the granules.  I did add the bread and it came out perfect!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Had I not made some changes to this recipe, I would have given it five stars because the flavor is outstanding.  If you are looking for the classic flavor and texture of beef stew, this is it.  Instead of using tapioca I used 3T cornstarch dissolved in a cup of beef broth.  I also used beef broth instead of water to kick up the flavor.  I've never used the slice of bread and haven't missed it.  Again--a delicious recipe--really hit the spot!

I agree with other reviews. I left out the bread, and used beef broth instead of the granules and chopped garlic.. My husband still stated that it needed more seasoning (because he likes things a little on the spicy side) Will make again.

This is what beef stew should taste like....wholesome, satisfying, and full of flavor. Only thing I added were 3  minced garlic cloves, substituted beef granules with a can of beef broth with a can of water, and added a couple Tbsps of tomatoe paste.

Delicious!  I added about a cup of fresh chopped green beans, omitted the tapioca and bread as suggested and used cornstarch instead...and added a little more water with an extra bullion cube.

I browned the beef with 1/4 cup of red wine and 2 cloves of chopped garlic.

Lastly, I added some fresh Thyme that I had and a teaspoon of Cumin.

I had a hard time fitting all ingredients into a 9x13" baking dish, but I made it work.

I cooked at 325 for 2 hours and 20 minutes instead of 375.

Delicious, will definitely make this again!

I really liked this stew. I didn't use any tapioca or cornstarch because I like mine a little soupier- it was splendid.  I cooked it for 1.5 hrs in a pot and then put it in a hollowed out pumpkin for 40 more minutes! I also added more veggies. yum-o.

This is delicious and as it was cooking, it made my house smell heavenly.  Per the advice of other reviewers, I too made some changes.  I substituted cornstarch for the tapioca and omitted the bread cause that just sounds gross.  I used two cups water instead of one cup and I also added 1/2 cup red wine.  I added 1 Tbl. minced garlic, 1 Tbl. dried parsley, and two bay leaves.

My family loves this beef stew.  I took it to Homecoming at my church last month and brought home an empty dish.  The only change I made was to mix in a little dried parsley.  I wasn't careful measuring the vegetables.  I added as much as I wanted so my stew did not have as much liquid as the picture.  That suited me perfectly because my family prefers it that way.  Will make often during the fall and winter months.

I made this last Friday when it rained, and it was sooo good!  I browned the beef in some flour and salt and pepper with some garlic powder, then put it in the slow cooker and added the veggies.  I didn't add the tapioca or bread, to thicken it I added corn starch at the end.  Instead of more beef broth to make the juice, I added 2 small cans of tomato juice.  It went great with crusty bread for dipping!  Will make again!!

From today on this will be "My Beef Stew Recipe"! It was delicious and so easy. I floured the stew beef and browned it so I omitted the tapioca and bread. Also the tomatoes didn't have much juice so I added a bit more water. The leftovers were even better. Thanks so much for this great stew recipe...

This stew is really good. In 37 years of marriage, I have never varied from my stew recipe. I'm glad I gave this one a try. I did dredge the meat in flour, garlic powder, paprika & a little salt & pepper. Then I added a little olive oil to the pan before browning the meat. Cornstarch in water was a good thickener. If you like some liquid in you stew, you may want to add more water or beef stock. Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing. My husband loved it, "Yummmm, now this is stew. It's exactly how I think stew should be! This is definitely a keeper. I think I'll have seconds". Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

I make a stew very simalar to this and I suggest that you use the granulated or quick tapioca. It thickens the stew without the tapioca balls.Therefore there is no need for the flour or the bread.
I also use a spicy vegetable juice in place of the tomatoes. This recipe also works well in a slow cooker and you can use meatballs in place of the beef for a change.

So easy and delicious. You put it in the oven and forget it. I omitted the onions (picky eaters). And it was still very flavorful. I also didn't brown the meat. After cutting up all that stuff I just wanted to put it in the oven :) It came out beautifully in 2 hours exactly. Make sure you cut the vegetables the right size for them to cook. The tapioca worked great no need to use cornstarch too. You could use bouillon cubes instead but you would have to boil the water, so that means extra prep time. I doubled the vegetables (as we are more veggie lovers than meat lovers) and the sauce/seasoning mix except for the salt and pepper. Again, it turned out great. Thanks for posting!!!!

Loved this recipe, I did change a few things. Firstly I doubled the recipe so we would have leftovers since I am a big fan of that. I did dip the meat in flour and brown lightly in olive oil. I used beef broth instead of water and I threw in a package of onion soup mix. I did not use any bread or tapioca. The flour I used on the meat helped thicken the gravy. This recipe is a keeper and will be making it throughout the winter, great comfort food. :)

OMG this was good.  I added two extra cups of water along with two extra beef bouillon granules.  (Made Amish White Bread from this site and wanted to dip in stew.)  I added peas but otherwise I kept the rest of the ingredients as written.  The taste was fantastic and the meat was very tender.  This is my favorite beef stew recipe from this site so far.  Thanks

Excellent recipe.  I added some Oregano and Cayanne Pepper for a little extra flavoring.  I could have used a little less red pepper because our child was not able to eat it from being too spicy.

I found the taste slightly sweet and the tomatoes were not much in taste evidence.  I liked the stew cold next day much more than hot first day.  The proportions of meat and vegetables were great.  This recipe makes 8 hearty servings or 12 regular servings, esp. if served with biscuits or some other.  At 375° covered, no peeking, for 2 hrs, everything is tender.  My meat was cubed round roast and I used a cubed hard crust bun for my bread (recipe didn’t specify bread type).  A sprinkle of Montreal steak sauce on a serving helps it somewhat.  Perhaps my expectations were too high because of all the 5 star reviews. Full disclosure:  used ground cherry and vine ripe tomato instead of canned (none on hand), used veg broth with "better than bouillon" instead of beef granules (again, none on hand).  Any modification will change a recipe somewhat but I doubt these small mod’s would make all the difference.  I won’t make again; I am usually not so exacting when making stew and I find using my dutch oven either on stove-top or in the oven easier to handle than the 9”x13” pan.

I will give this a 4 star because my stew didn't have extra liquid when finished cooking.  The taste was wonderful.  I will increase my can of tomato to 2 cans and double my liquid portion of this recipe and pray for more liquid.

ok, this is a tough one.  What I ended up with tasted GREAT, but I modified it so much it ended up being entirely different.  I like reading the modifications others post in their reviews so here is my contribution:  I also used cornstarch instead of tapioca and only a dash or two of sugar.  I used low-sodium beef broth in place of water and boullion.  I coated meat with flour salt and pepper mixture and pan seared first.  I did not add bread at all.  I also added much more salt and pepper and tomato paste in the end because it was a little on the bland side.  Oh and I put in a little minced garlic-you can NEVER go wrong with garlic in my opinion!

Bottom line: great recipe...but, I would omit the salt altogether because it's ungodly for my taste! Otherwise, we will definitely be enjoying this recipe for a long time...thanks!

This recipe is extremely easy to make.  Once you cut up the ingedients you just put it in the oven and two hours later, beef stew!  I used beef stock instead of water and corn starch instead of tapioca.  I also put in some red pepper flakes to give it a kick.    Really tasty, can't wait for the leftovers!

ok, so I had no business even making this dish, as I had no tomatoes, potatoes or tapioca..but I really wanted it anyway.  So I played with it a little.  I used cornstarch and cold water in place of tapioca (thanks to suggestions of others).  I used 3 tbsp sundried tomato paste (all I had) and 1 cup of red wine. I doubled the bread, used beef stock instead of bouillion & water (also doubled) saute'd the vegies, adding garlic, and lastly added  fresh thyme from my garden.   It was delicious. (even though I DID miss the potatoes)  So THANKS Diane for the inspiration and a great recipe.  Next time I'll have all the ingredients!  thanks again!

If I could rate this recipe with 10 stars I would!  It was awesome!  I've never baked a stew before but I think from now on, it's how I'm going to make it.  My husband who is a very good cook said he'd never tasted better. I usually don't rate recipes I make changes to as I usually make recipes as is if I'm going to rate or review them, as it's not fair to the person who submitted the recipe. But I didn't have all the stuff to make this so I had no choice.  With that said, here are the changes I had to make.  I added stewed tomatoes in place of diced.  Beef broth for the bullion/water and I sauted the onions with the beef and used some of the broth to deglaze the pan.  I didn't have any tapioca so I added corn starch along with some more beef broth at the end.  But I do think it's the overall process of baking this stew that makes it so good.  The meat was tender without being mushy....the carrots and potatoes were not mushy either.  THANK YOU Diane for this great recipe!!

Great recipe! I didn't have tapioca or cornstarch on hand, so I used a flour paste instead. I also kept the bread out, and added other vegetables - green bell pepper, whole mushrooms (quartered). It was absolutely delicious! Definitely a keeper!

Have to admit, I was a little skeptical of baking a stew. This was delicious! I added another can of tomatoes (drained). The tapioca did a great job of slightly thickening the stew. We loved this recipe and have made it many times!

My husband loved this recipe and almost ate all of it!  (I halved the recipe for our family.)  It did need more spice, I added hot sauce, but I will add something next time to give it some more flavor.

Good recipe but not outstanding.  I would suggest that for the sake of saving energy, the stew could be slow-cooked - much less energy is used that that used by the oven.  This is an important consideration for me as I try to save on electricity whenever I can.

Our meat came out so good! I hate adding water to things when you can add more flavor so I used beef broth instead. I might not use the sugar next time cause it was slightly too sweet. Still very good though.

Great Recipe, except need extra liquid.  I skipped the bread and the tapioca, added extra potatos.  A little be too salty to my taste.  Add some extra water might work better.  Still, it taste great.

WOW This is so so good and so easy. I made some substitutions for pantry contents. Used beef broth in place of boullion and parsnips in place of potatoes. This made the house smell wonderful. And everyone loved it. Thanks for a really great recipe that will be used often.

My family really liked this dish. We don’t like a lot of liquid  with our stews, too much like soup so this was nice since the baking process seems to reduce the liquid so there was a nice thick flavorful sauce. We like stronger flavors so I compared several recipes. I added the following to this one: 1 more bay leaf, 2 cloves crushed garlic, 1 tsp. paprika, 1 tsp. Worcestershire sauce, 2 cups of quartered red potatoes, 2 tsp. White sugar and another stalk of celery. I substituted 6 T of corn starch for the instant tapioca and a cup of seasoned croutons for the bread. We ate buttered French bread and a fresh green salad with it. Delicious meal on a cold night.

This is a delicious stew exactly as written. I've made it several times and play around with the veggies, but potatoes, carrots and celery is a great base to start. I also found it can be baked at 250 deg for 5 hours. the beef is tender and there is no need to brown the meat first. When cooking low and slow, veggies should be in large pieces. Either way, a winner in my family!

Husb loved it but I followed changes from others. I used the stove. Note to Self: Dredged beef stew pieces in plastic bag with 5 large Tbsp flour with 1 Tbsp each of garlic powder, onion powder, & pepper. 
Browned meat in pan, water to deglaze. 
In a bowl mixed up 8 oz diced tomatoes, 2 large Tbsp beef bullion, 2+ Tbsp cornstarch/cold water mixture, 2 Tbsp sugar,  and one packet of Lipton Onion Soup. 
Added 1 cup small carrots, ½ onion, 2 stalks celery & 5 small potatoes cut up. 
Transferred to large pot and kept on stove 2 hours.

Great easy recipe.  I used my own canned stewed tomatoes that had onions and peppers already in it.  The flavor was just right and it broke down completely.  I also through in a sweet potato which added to the stew consistency since it cooked down so I could mix it in.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is my 'go to' beef stew recipe for the family. It is easy to make and definitely easy to clean up.  I do make a couple of changes, though: i use 1 container of Knorr Homestyle Stock (gelatin consistency) instead of the beef bouillon, and 2 TBS of cornstarch rather than tapioca. Other than that, I follow the recipe to a "T".  The family loves it and normally there are no left-overs.

This is easily the best beef stew I ever made. Deee-licious. Like other reviewers, I used corn starch instead of tapioca and left out the bread. The only thing I'd change next time is cutting back the salt.

I substituted 3 TBS of Cornstarch for the Tapioca and dropped the sugar.   Added an extra can of diced tomatoes, half cup of red wine and browned the beef after dredging in seasoned flour.  Also placed the potatoes, carrots, onion and in dish first with meat on top and then poured the liquid mix all over the top. Wife said it was the best stew she ever ate. Also baked for 2 1/2 hours.   No knife needed, abso delicious

I was pleasantly surpirsed by the great flavor and ease of the dish.  I have referred to many of my co-workers.  
I did use the other reviewers suggestions for tapioca substitute and browning the meat with flour, garlic salt and onion powder as well as changing the oven temperature to 325 degrees for 2 1/2 hours.
Thanks, great dish I'll eat again!

This is an absolutely fabulous recipe. My entire family raved about it. I plan to cook this often. Because I work outside the home, I cooked this the night before and reheated the next day for 30 minutes at 375 degrees and it was outstanding.

This is my favorite stew recipe. I use beef broth instead of water - and sometimes omit the bread, but otherwise this is perfect! Thanks!

4 stars for taste 3 for texture. After about 1 1/2hrs the stew was so thick I could barely stir it. It had a "glue" like texture. I used beef broth instead of just water and had to use some of that to thin out before eating. Also the bread never blended in. We could see and feel slimy bread pieces. Maybe that can be eliminated next time. I could also see the little "balls" of the tapioca but couldn't really feel them while eating. I would probably make again because the flavor was nice but maybe try tweaking like other reviewers.

Fabulous!  I omit the tapioca and sub corn starch. I also skip the bread.  But it's wonderful, wonderful!

It was awesome - my bf loves it!  I added more veggies (broccoli, cauliflower), sliced mushrooms, teriyaki sauce/soy sauce, parsley. i also added more water. i also used fluor instead of tapioca.

I thought this was delicious.  I didn't use the tapioca, but I did add 2 extra beef bouillions and 2 extra cups of water - as recommended by others.  So easy and a great recipe if you forget to get the stew in the slow-cooker.
