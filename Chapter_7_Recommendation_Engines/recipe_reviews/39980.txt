I thought this recipe would be great since I LOVE mushrooms and Italian spices, but I really didn't care for the finished product.  The spices in the dressing completely took over and I didn't even taste the earthy mushroom flavor that I love. I felt like I wasted a wonderful batch of mushrooms on this since I couldn't really taste them. The flavor was pretty good, maybe as a side dish with an Italian supper, but not if you want to showcase the mushrooms.  This recipe would be great with some quartered red potatoes instead of the mushrooms.

Although I have not made this exact recipe, I make something like it myself. I gave this recipe 3 stars because I have also used the italian dressing and also find that it over powers. I use portabellas-fill them with crushed buttter garlic croutons, melted butter, diced red pepper, mozzarella and swiss, then bake or grill until done. Like I said-the italian dressing just takes over.

Sounds like a great recipe since i loove mushrooms, but after reading the comments im not sure i want to make it. Maybe use cream of shroom soup and make it more of a casserole.

A little too tangy for my taste w/the dressing. I think next time, I won't use very much. Otherwise, great flavor & good for a side dish.

I made this for our Ladies Bible Study Group . I used whole fresh mushrooms,  cut back on the amount of salad dressing, dipped the mushroom in melted garlic butter instead.  So much easier than stuffing individual mushrooms, and everyone loved it!  I will definitely make this again!

I quartered 2 kinds of mushrooms and marinated overnight in red wine then followed the rest of the recipe. Very tasty, my friends loved them, I had no leftovers!!
