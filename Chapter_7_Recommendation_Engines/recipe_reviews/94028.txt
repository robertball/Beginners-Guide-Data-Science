this is a fantastic salsa. i did change and add a few things. i cooked a 2lb recipe for 8. i have learned over the years a few things about cooked blender recipes. i put all the ingredients in a blender first and blended it all together. and then cooked the recipe for about 15 min. if you do it this way you do not have to add any water, it makes it's own juices, and comes out just right, not to thick and not to thin
 (trust me) i did add 2 poblano chile's insted of the other. and i added the juice of 1 lime(really makes a difference)i did add 2 chicken bouillion cubes while cooking, it came out the best fresh salsa that i have had in a long time

I took Judy's advice and added 1/4 c. of lime juice and Ann's advice about using vinegar instead of water so I could home can this.  I used 1 cup of vinegar and it was a little too thin but the flavor is incredible.  I'll use less vinegar next time or increase the rest of the ingredients so it will be a little thicker.  Really flavorful!  I'm going to make a pot of Terry's Texas Pinto Beans (on this site) to try it out.

I loved the taste, but I found the texture a bit watery for my taste.

 Instead of boiling I opted to roast the tomatillos, pepper, and garlic in the oven. Then I mixed everything together in the blender, substituting the juice of half a lime for water.

Roasting the tomatillos helped thicken the salsa a bit, and really brought out the flavor.

Great way to use the 5 pounds of tomatillos that a friend dropped off.  I subbed cilantro for oregano and added lime juice and a few cherry tomatoes.  Wanted to suit our family's tastes as well as use up some stuff in the house.  EDIT for FREEZING:  I froze 2 quart-sized containers of the salsa and thawed one out the other day.  The taste was so fresh.  We ate some as is and then mixed with some fresh (red) salsa I had made for a party.

This blew me away! Never had such good salsa verde and who would have thought it would come from my own kitchen, using tomatillos, peppers and oregano fresh from my own garden? I added a little more of the peppers (I used jalapeno) and a little less water, then simmered until it was not only tender, but the consistency I wanted. It was just a tad hot for me, as I included the seeds and membranes of the peppers, but after the first few bites my tongue and throat got used to it! I'm sure others would find it to have just the right heat.  Excellent! (And all gone...)

This was VERY good.  I made this as written except I added another serrano- we like ours a little spicier.  Once it was blended it ended up a little too watery for me.  We like to use our salsa as a dip for tortillas so I coursely chopped 1 cup of Red Onion and a 1/2 cup Cilantro to give it some weight.  I will make this again.  Without the modifications to suit our needs it was a 5- the flavor is AWESOME!

We love using our garden grown tomatillos in this recipe.  Great as a sauce to put over chicken!  It also freezes well.

WOW! This is the second time I've made this salsa verde and it deserves another review. Both times I followed Nina's suggestion of blending the ingredients before cooking, and it's genius. You don't need water when you blend it first because the tomatillos are so juicy on their own. I used a jalapeno instead of the serrano, and it was a HOT one! I used 1t of dried oregano, and 1t of dried cilantro since I only could get 1T fresh from my poor plant. Also, I only used 1t of salt and it was just perfect. Thanks for the awesome recipe -- it makes me a little less homesick for good Tex-Mex!

This was a great base but I did a few things different. First, I used slightly more than 1lb of tomatillos and I also added 2 opoblano peppers. I roasted those in the oven together for 30 minutes on 350 and just used some EVOO and S&P on them. Once the tomatillos becaome soft I took them out and put them in my food processor. I added 1/2 cups of water and the juice of 5 limes to that mixture. I also added a few tablespoons of white vinegar for balance. 1tsp of salt, 1tsp of cumin and 1 tsp of dry oregano. I used probably half of a medium sized red onion, about half of a bushel of cilantro, 3-4 cloves of fresh garlic and 2 serrano peppers. I then pulsed until my desired consistency and put in a saucepan. Brought the mixture to a boil and then put on low/simmer for 10 minutes to blend the flavors. Perfect! Heat had a bite at the end but went away quickly so I would say that is perfect! Do not add all of that water unless you want soup. The tomatillos are full of water.

I made this with home grown tomatoes and a little less water. Added the olive oil that was suggested in a review and this was perfect! Perfect heat, perfect taste.

This is my first review of any recipe. This was a great salsa. I read a lot of the reviews, and when trying to make something for the first time, I attempt to use the "orginal" which I did here. I would suggest altering the cooking process by boiling the tomatillos, onion, garlic and peppers FIRST; then when mxing in a blender add the seasoning. I also added the water "as needed" to create the consistancy of the salsa I wanted. If I had added all the water I had boiled with the tomatillos, it would have been too thin.

Easy but spicy! Most of the reviewers said to replace water with vinegar and squeeze 1-2 lime juice but i was afraid that it would be too tangy for my husbands taste so I just used 1 1/2 cup water and 1/2 cup vinegar. The results were pretty basic. I'm totally going to try the other way...forget about my husband lol. I'm more of a salsa verde fan anyways!

This is just what I was looking for! I agree with another reviewer, though, to blend the ingredients BEFORE cooking. I didn't need to add any water at all and it was delicious!

I love salsa verde!  I use 2 jalepenos and omit the cumin.  Instead of the salt, I add some adobo to taste.  As for the water, I use half a cup and the juice of 5 limes, which adds a wonderful tang.  I just take all the ingredients and whizz them in the food processor.  I then cook down the sauce with browned rib sections.  Yum!

Delish!  Made as written except blended ingredients before cooking which eliminates need for water. Also used 2 peppers due to our taste.

Pretty much amazing! I roasted the tomatillos first by putting them under the broiler for a few minutes, moving them around about every minute or so until they blackened in places. I then blended everything except the water. The serrano made it VERY spicy, even for a girl who puts hot sauce on everything. I added a little lime juice and 1/3 cup of chicken stock and it was great. I also let it simmer for a bit before using to reduce the consistency. No need to boil anything. This is my first time cooking with tomatillos, but I will def. be making this again soon.

My changes: I roasted the tomatillos and blended them with the peppers, onions and garlic. Didn't add water. In my opinion, boiling the onions mellows them too much. Plus I add the cilantro at the very end, instead of boiling the cilantro in the salsa.

Finding a 6-lb can of crushed tomatillos at a ridiculous price gave me the incentive to try this for canning. I changed the amounts more or less proportionately, used 4 medium seeded jalapenos instead of serrano, omitted the oregano, and used white vinegar instead of water (2 cups for the whole batch).  I substituted canning salt for the regular salt.  Though I was loathe to do it, I had to add sugar to balance the tartness, but it was fabulous.  I'd recommend waiting until you've blended the salsa before tweaking the seasonings. I didn't feel it needed the chicken broth, so I didn't add it. Even my son, who loves salsa, but hates "chunks" likes this.

I have made this salsa a couple times this summer and have been freezing some of it for the winter.  The only issue I had the first time I made it was that its really thin when you add all the water.  So I cut it down to two tablespoons of water and let the liquid from the tomatillos simmer out.  now its perfect

I just made a huge batch of this with fresh tomatillos out of my garden.  While I did throw in a bunch of other stuff that needed to get used (reg. tomatoes, grape tomatoes, jalapenos and poblanos) I didn't add any water and it came out to the perfect consistency and tasted great.  I also cooled it down and tossed in the cilantro right before I blended so it had a nice bright flavor.

I would not add any water until you cook your tomatillos down and see how thick or thin yours is.

I also found there was too much liquid and not enough fire. But quite good and next time I'll increase chiles and greatly reduce the water. As another reviewer suggested, I might cook down the tomatillos first, then add remaining ingredients while processing to better control the amount of liquid. UPDATE: I cooked the tomatillos in a small amount of water, then blended a few of them with the remaining ingredients (with much hotter chiles), added the rest of the tomatillos and pulsed just enough to blend. Excellent!!

Yum, yum, yum! I had some frozen tomatillo puree so I started with that and used less of the water since mine already seemed to have quite a bit. This was easy to play around with until I got the taste that we were looking for. Great stuff!

I broiled onions/tomatillos/jalopenos for 5 mins. Pureed in food processor w/ cilantro/garlic in batches blended up. Poured in large skillet boiled 15-20. Tasted it was not hot so add Kick I added an 1/2 open jar of Marinated Sweet Hot Piquante & Red Peppers diced and simmered for 10 mins more this was HOT now :O). It yielded for me 8 cups of salsa. I am freezing 1/2 will update when I thaw it out..

I am a freak over "green sauce" tomatillo verde. I love it. This is really good and very authentic tasting. I did add more onion and more cilantro. Cooked for 15 mins and then pureed in my food processor. I had mine with tortilla chips but it is also really good over tacos, enchiladas and carne asada. YUM!

BLAND! I tried to put more jalapenos in it because I usually don’t keep Serrano peppers on hand unless I buy them for something. Jalapenos are nasty in this… and without them it has no zing… I will be buying my Salsa Verde from now on.

Because I don't think you can ever have to much garlic and being a bit of a serrano fan, I upped the amount of both of those. I started late at night and realized I should just finish in the morning so I put everything in the sauce pan and waited til morning to cook it. In the morning before cooking, I thought it would be a bit juicy for me [I used 5 lbs of tomatillos from our garden and 10 cuos of water] so I took out about 3 cups of stock and saved it. After cooking it still looked a bit watery for my taste so I too out a few more cups of the broth and saved it.  The resulting salsa is delicious!  As a bonus, I took the stock and made a barley soup that was ambrosia. I am going to make it next time with the same amount of water called for in the recipe and take the same amount of stock out of it to try some different soups.

I did add more peppers than called for but we lot more heat (spice). I will add a little less water the next time to make it a little thicker. Good combo of ingreds for a nice flavor.  Thanks for the submission.

This might be the best green salsa I've ever had. I halved the recipe. . I put everything in the blender first as suggested. Substituted 1 jalapeño for the Serrano. Omitted the water. Then simmered for 15 minutes. Heaven!

I followed the advice of one of the other posters and added lime juice, but found this was still missing something.  I added tablespoon of a mild salsa spice which really brought the flavors more into what I was looking for.  I also omitted the water and blended the ingredients before boiling, it was a perfect consistency!

We used five medium cloves of garlic to give it some extra zip, which was a good idea.  We used about 1" of a 3" chile pepper (not sure of variety) and it was plenty hot, probably "hot" by grocery store standards, medium by TX standards.  I almost never cook w/ chiles, so I tasted it before I put it in.  Whew!  I'm glad I only used 1".

Really good, but this is WAY too watery!!!  It's more like an enchilada sauce than a salsa.  I should have looked up some of the reviews before making this.  Next time I will omit the water as many of the reviewers suggested.  Otherwise, great flavor and really easy to prepare.

Divine! I chopped everything very fine and put it in the saucepan without water as suggested by others. I didn't blend it afterwards and it was great. I had heard of tomatillos but never saw them until a visit to our local farmers market last week. I only got enough to make half this recipe and it went pretty quick. Also added the juice of half a lime. I ate it all with tortilla scoops with a dab of sour cream. Scrumptious recipe!

Very good.  The only place where it needs improvement is that the salsa is a little thin if made per the directions.  After blending I put it back on the stove on high for about 5 minutes and let the salsa boil down a little; stirring frequently.  Next time I'll just add less water; 1.5 cups would probably be about right.  I used this to make an enchilada casserole.

Very good starter recipe.  I used a pound and a half of tomatillos and added two roasted pablano peppers to this as well.  I used a jalapeno pepper from my garden instead of the serrano. And topped it off with the juice of 1/2 lime. Family loved it.

Delicious!  Served with Hint of Lime tortilla chips and it was even better.  Which means I will probably add just a little lime juice next time if I serve it with regular tortilla chips to give it more zing!

Great basic conception. I added another serrano, lime and a pablano. Awesome for enchilladas. Part of it was simmered in with the chicken, other half went on top. I let mine sit over night.

Delicious! I couldnt find any decent fresh tomatillos, so I had to use canned. (2 lrg cans, drained) I was afraid I would ruin the outcome, but it came out so good. I used vinegar as well, rather than water and added juice from 2 limes. So good! I also added the entire bunch of cilantro.  I'm going to use it for chicken enhiladas tonight and the rest as salsa and everything else that goes well with a little salsa.

Very good on chicken and pork.  I added more garlic, cilantro, and salt.  I also added 1 cube of chicken bouillon.

Taking the advice of others, I opted to combine all ingredients in the food processor first, then cook it over a low heat until salsa turned a lightly darker color.  I also added about a teaspoon of sugar to take the bite away from the slightly bitter tomatillos/ lime juice.  When I have additional time, I think I will try to roast/ blacken the tomatillos, serranos, and garlic in the oven first before processing.  Thanks Kimberly!

Yum!  I followed one reviewer's advice and put all of the ingredients in a blender before simmering for 15 minutes.  Way easier than trying to blend hot ingredients!  This is very tasty with corn tortilla chips.

I followed this recipe as stated except I only used about 3/4 c of water, and I did add some lime pepper.  It has a good heat to it, but it's missing something. I would've liked a thicker salsa.

Excellent. I'd give this 6 stars if I could. I blended up the ingredients in a blender first before simmering for 15 minutes on the stove. The only liquid that I added was about 1/8 cup of veggie broth to the blender to get it started blending well. I also added extra garlic, extra cilantro and omitted the oregano. Served with carne asada tacos, perfect!

Too much water, all the seasoning gets dumped in the sink. Steam the tomatillos, onion, garlic and peppers FIRST in a small amount of water; then when mixing in a blender add all  the seasoning, spalsh lime juice, splash evoo.

I roasted the tomatillos in the oven at 400 degrees with everything but the cumin and salt.  I added just enough water to cover the bottom of the dish. This is delicious, I could eat it with a spoon!  Now I hope the rest of my tomatillos are ready in the garden!

Best salsa ever! I made to top flank steak tacos, but ended up eating with chips. So good. I roasted the veggies instead of boiling, omitted the water, only added juice of a small lime before blending. All other quantities for ingredients are spot on. Fabulous salsa!

Made this with chicken broth instead of water and it was delicious. I would make sure to leave the pan uncovered when it is cooking as mine turned out a bit runny although it did thicken some overnight. Be careful not to over blend. I won't puree it next time to leave it a tiny bit chunky. Excellent flavor and will definitely make it again! Thanks

We really liked this! I didn't add any water. I quartered the tomatillos and threw them in the food processor with the onion, garlic, cilantro and a jalapeño. Then I put it in the pan, added the rest of the ingredients, brought it to a boil and then let it summer for 15 minutes. There was plenty of liquid!

I really enjoy the salsa but I made a couple changes to the recipe.

1) I boiled the tomatillos alone then removed them from the water with a slotted spoon to remove any excess water.

2) SarahLee's review mentioned it being watery so I didn't use any water in the blending process. I just added the boiled tomatillos and the rest of the ingredients in the blender and it game out with a nice not too watery not too thick consistency.

Next time I make it I am going to use 2 serrano peppers(maybe 3) since I like my salsa spicy.  I also might try adding some lime juice as suggested in other reviews.

I modified this recipe based on advice from reviewers and it was great! Here's what I did: roasted the tomatillos with half an onion and 2 jalapenos in a covered dutch oven for 1 hour. Drained. In a food processor put roasted ingredients, plus 1 tbs Mexican bullion, 2 tbs jarred minced garlic, a fistful of cilantro LEAVES (never chop the stems in), juice from one lime, and a wee pinch of cumin (my philosophy on cumin is if you can taste it you put too much in.) Then process- not too much! Chill before serving. I did not add salt or oregano since there is salt in the bullion (and oregano?)

I've made tomatillo sauce before but broiled the tomatillos in the oven. This way was MUCH faster! The ingredients compliment each other so nicely. I served it over roasted pork tenderloin. What was nice was I found another tomatillo in the fridge after the sauce had already been simmering and after a few minutes, it soon softened enough to blend after I added it. Great sauce!

This recipe is perfect! I made it with tomatillos and a "super chili" from my brother's garden. These were award winners at the CNE/state fair and I could eat this on everything. It couldn't have been easier.

We loved this salsa, I did use Chicken broth for this instead of water, I thought this might be a little thin if I blended it with the liquid, so I just scooped it all out and blended it without the liquid.

After all the great reviews, I must have done something wrong. VERY runny.  I used 2 pounds tomatillos and 4 cups water.  I would have preferred it to be much thicker.  I'm not sure how to use it so runny.  It is also a bit bitter.  My first time using tomatillos so maybe I didn't know how to judge the ripeness? EDITED:  In reviewing a few other recipes, I think I misunderstood that this is supposed to be runny.  I read that roasting the tomatillos first might make the sauce thicker or I can try adding less water if I don't want it to run all over the plate. I hope to experiment more with tomatillos. I guess I expected something else.

I first had tomatillo salsa verde a couple of years ago in New Mexico.  Since then, I've been looking for a decent replica.  This is not only as good as what I had, but is probably better.  If you can't find serrano chiles, or don't have them on hand, just throw in 2 tablespoons of canned green chiles.  And I've found that dried oregano works just as well as fresh.  Thanks so much, Kimberly!

I always follow a recipe exactly the first time. I doubled this recipe and 4 cups of water was entirely too much. Sauce is way too thin. I will try it again and add vinegar for part of the liquid. Good place to start, but needs some adjustments

This turned out great! I took the liberty of adding a couple chipotle peppers in addition to the serranos. It added a nice smoky flavor to the end. I also roasted the tomatillos instead of boiling them. I finished it off with juice from 1/2 a lime.

Followed suggestion of blending all ingredients before cooking 15 minutes therefore using only 1/2 C water.  This was my first time trying tomatillos and what a great recipe for a first time try!  Thank you so much for a great tasting salsa.

This recipe was okay but probably not worth the extra effort for me.  I think the overall taste was affected by less than fresh tomatillos.  I picked them up at a large local grocery store the same day but their selection looked a lil damaged and dry.  I was making this for chicken enchiladas and when the meal was all said and done I told myself I should have just used the jarred stuff.  But that's just my opinion.  I might try again in the future and see if that changes.

I made this salsa as a project in my Food Preparation course for my college. The head Chef said it was the best salsa verde he had ever had. I agree!

Followed advice of others and used lime juice and vinegar in place of water.  Also added more peppers because we wanted it really hot - WOW!  Amazing kick to it - everyone loves it!  I canned 7 pints and will need to do at least double of that next year - amazing served over chicken enchiladas!

Perfect! I switched the serrano chile peppers with Jalapenos due to availability and it was still yummy. Easy to make too....my 14 year old step-son made it!

Great recipe but like the other reviewers, I only used half of the water and added a splash of lime juice. I didn't have fresh oregano, but the dried work ok, just used a little extra and crushed it to bring out the flavor. Also I used a large jalepeno pepper which made it nice and hot, had a good bit to it. Tasty when put on top bean tostadas.

Pretty good and a lot milder than I had expected.  I added more fresh cilantro and two roasted anaheim chiles (minus seeds and skin) and it was exactly what I got in the restaurants in Dallas.  Perfect!

I used Nina's recipe and added about 4 left over green tomatoes from the garden.  I didn't have fresh herbs so used the same portion of dried and a heaping 1/2 tsp of cumin.  Delish!

With my alteration - I tried the recipe both ways... I liked it best when I substituted the can of green chilies for a small can of Salsa Verde - Gives it the most flavorful, tangy, a bit spicy, delicious taste!!!!! So easy to make - and healthy!! Love these!!!!!

I worried about this recipe all day, seeing it was my first time making it EVER. I shouldn't have worried, it was pretty self-explanatory. I think I tripled the cilantro, I didn't measure that part of the recipe. We really like cilantro. This was miles better than the jarred salsa verde. I don't think I could go back even if I wanted to. Don't be afraid, it's really simple. Next time, I think I'll increase the cumin and cut back on the water and use fresh lime juice.

This wasn't great for me. It's a good base recipe, but the cilantro flavor was way too strong for my tastes. It needs a little more heat and maybe more seasoning to give it some depth. I did follow the advice of other reviews and blend first, then cook with no added water. The consistency this way was nice. I will try this again, but with a few tweaks!

This was a great way to use my tomatillos from the CSA. This was so delish and tasted very authentic just like the salsa I get at the restaurants. I didn’t have fresh herbs, so I used dried and it still tasted great.

The recipe came out amazing! This was probably the fifth or sixth recipe I've tried, and this will now be a staple! I usually pick the hard recipes that require roasting the tomatillos and different kinds of peppers; I never imagined such a simple recipe could be so good! *Side note, I don't know if I used a serrano, I just picked a random pepper in our garden, lol. I also squeezed 1 lime and added tsp. of sugar. Oh, and used garlic salt instead of regular salt. Also, for convenience I used a hand blender in the pot I used to boil everything.   Thank you for such an easy, yet great recipe!!

Loved this! My very first Salsa Verde and this was excellent.  I used this to serve with Shrimp Tacos and still had enough left over to eat the next day with tortilla chips.  I used a jalapeno instead and also added some chicken seasoning and lime juice.  I blended all the ingredients first and then cooked.  Yummy!

Very good although I changed it a bit.  I didn't add any water because when the peppers cook they add moisture.  I added a teaspoon of ground coriander.  I also grilled the peppers and tomatillos before I blended them in the blender.  It added a nice smoky flavor.  Very authentico!

This recipe was really great. I'd never made tomatillo salsa before, but this was super easy. I only added 1 cup of water, and I think it was still a bit thin for my taste. Maybe only a 1/2 cup next time. I like a chunky salsa, so I just cooked it for a few minutes more and it was the perfect texture for me--no blending required! Thanks!

Flavor is good, but the water...Wow!  2 cups made my salsa so thin.  I had to add cornstarch to thicken a bit.  (Don't do that if you are planning to can the salsa.) I will try again and leave out most of the water.

One of my favorite salsas!!! Made it for a Mexican fiesta. I halved 5 green tomatoes, used two 1/2 inch slices of white onion, one de-seeded, de-veined Jalapeno chile, and about 4 cloves of garlic, put them on a baking sheet and broiled them for a few minutes.  Put everything into a blender along with a bunch (just what I could tear off comfortably from the larger bunch)of fresh cilantro and juice from approx. a quarter of a lime. Just pulsed it a few times, long enough to allow some small chunks to remain.  Was almost enough to fill a 26 oz. Prego Spaghetti sauce jar. If you want it spicier, do the serranos and leave the seeds. We had too many kids at the fiesta, so I didn't want it too hot.

This was pretty good but if you like heat you will have to add 2 or 3 jalapenos to get the heat. I also had to increase the salt by quite a bit and I added two pinches of sugar. The final result was good.

I reduced the amount of water and pureed it with an immersion blender. I also like to add frozen corn kernels. I use this as green enchilada sauce for shrimp & crab enchiladas.

Awesome! I boiled the tomitillo until tender (about 10 minutes), then drained them. I returned them to the pot and added the peppers (cherry and banana), onion and garlic and cooked another 10 minutes, stirring occasionally to break up the tomitillo. I then placed this in a blender, adding the juice of one lime, grated lime zest, fresh oregano, salt and curry (I didn’t have any cilantro on hand). This was sooo good we didn’t wait until it cooled. After placing in the refrigerator overnight, it jelled up and tastes even better cold.

Update: I make this all the time for get-togethers and people love it. I now refer to it as "my famous salsa verde". It will taste very spicy after it is first made, but mellows out overnight. I omitted the oregeno, the cumin, the water and used an extra pepper, extra cilantro, and added the juice of 1 lime. I also used reviewer Nina's technique of putting all the ingredients in the food processor first, then cooking for a few minutes. It's super easy to make and quite spicy. Plus, it tastes very similar to the salsa verde from my favorite taco cart. Yum!

So tasty. I had to use dried jalepenos (ground up in the food processor) due to the pepper salmonella scare,but it was still tasty.  So easy and good.  Mine was not watery once it sat for a bit.

This was easy and yummy.  Next time I will either add more tomatillos, less water, or both.  I like my salsa thicker than this turned out to be.

I needed to add in additional cumin and salt after blended to bring those flavors up a little. And a tbsp of vinegar never hurts to brighten up flavors.

While  this is very good, I think that cooking the onions, cilantro, etc. beforehand is not necessary.  I actually think adding them after the tomaillos are cooked enhances the flavor of the entire dish.

WOW this was good. Used this on enchilladas that i made from a receipe on this site and it was a HIT! My husband said this was the best salsa verde he has EVER had. I threw everything in a blender first and then cooked it. I started adding chicken broth instead of water while cooking until i felt it had the right taste and consistency probably around 1-1/4 cup.

Very good and easy, one more step that makes this even better is "seasoning" which is usually traditionally done with Mexican salsas, once the salsa is done according to the instructions, add a tablespoon of oil to a pan, heat up the oil and add the salsa and let simmer for 15-20 mins, it helps bring out the color and flavor.

After reading numerous reviews and speaking with a Mexican person who works in the produce section of my grocery store, I too put in the food processor first, then cooked it.  No need to add any water.  I also used only fresh herbs.  Delicious!

Great taste.  I had left over tomatillos in the freezer from last year so made up a batch with 7lbs of tomatillos and canned 8 pints.  I used a food processor to chop everything before cooking it.  This made it very easy and left the salsa a little chucky which I like.  I added lime juice and vinegar instead of the water.  I used maybe a cup of lime juice and 2 cups of vinegar (instead of the 14 cups of water the recipe would have called for).  Will definitely make this again.

I have made this salsa a couple of times. I added just enough water to boil the tomatoes. I sautéed the peppers and onions and blended them in with the cooked tomato. using the liquid as needed for the consistency you want. My man who is Mexican said it was really good ??so for that I give it 5 stars ??

Very tasty. 
Changes I made because I added some Himalayan pink salt which is so much saltier than other salts:
added two tiny eggplants
added 1.5 cups canned tomatoes
did not have any fresh oregano-used 1/4 tsp dried marjoram
I added 2 T. lime juice
Used some frozen jalapeno peppers from our garden instead of serrano.

This turned out delightful in flavor, texture and color.
I did not add any water and placed everything in my Cuisinart Food Processor and it turned out a super consistency.

It was really great. It tastes way better than enchilada sauce I usually buy at the store. So much healthier too. No sugar except a bit of natural sugars from the tomatillo (like 1 gram of sugar per ounce - about 2 tbs). It is a great recipe for my husband's diabetes. ITS NO JOKE- SUPER EASY!!!!!!!!

I took the suggestions of others.  Roasted the tomatillos on the grill until they were done, did not use any water,added the juice of one lime, and doubled the cilantro.  Placed everything in my food processor and the result was a very fresh and flavorful dip for my tortilla chips.

This recipe is great. We had tons of tomatillos from the garden and needed something to do with them. boy am i glad we made this! Instead of boiling the ingredients in a skillet though I cut them into big chunks and roasted them for about 30 min. at 400. it really brought out the flavor in the salsa. used 4 jalapeños instead of serrano cause thats what I had.  Also used just a little less water so mine was a little thicker, I could have used all the water and it would have been fine. Went great with the homemade enchiladas we made for dinner!

I agree, it was a little watery and I like a chunkier salsa.  So I also added lime brighten the taste.  Maybe the roasting would provide a chunkier texture.  Great taste.  Makes alot.

This is a good recipe, made great with the addition of a few TBSP of lime juice, to taste, added AFTER cooking. Before cooking, I pureed everything except the water, cilantro and lime. While cooking, I added just a little water to get it to the right consistency. After cooking, I pureed it again to incorporate the cilantro and lime. The cilantro tastes fresher added at the end. Also, I did try a batch replacing the water with vinegar, as recommended by other reviewers. I didn't care at all for this -- it overpowered the flavor of the tomatillos.

Yum!  I made no changes in the ingredients, but I did blend the tomatillos (came in our farm share), onions, garlic and pepper together and then cooked them with the spices and did not add water.  Wish I had more tomatillos!

I followed Nina L's advice and put all items in the blender and then in the pot, minus water, plus lime juice. I also added a little more garlic, as my family loves it! Delicious!!! Made for an enchilada recipe from Cooking Light.

I made this with a few minor changes. First I put it all in the blender, I chopped the tomatillo's in quarters first, added about 3 tablespoons of red onion in addition to the white, used 1 huge jalapeno that I seeded because serrano's are a little to hot for the hubby & I used 1 heaping tablespoon of dried oregano, the juice of half a lime all the rest of the ingredients and whirled it all in the blender until smooth. I put it all in a saucepan and brought it to a boil for 5 minute's, then simmered for 30 minutes. Wonderful!!! I also made a dip out of 3 tablespoons of the salsa and added 1 heaping tablespoon of pickled chopped japaleno's and 1/4 cup ranch dressing. Fantastic. Much like the creamy japaleno dip you get at Chuey's. Served along side the Chicken Enchilada's 11 tonight.

Never made anything like this before.  Turned out perfect.  Followed the recipe exactly and it was a big hit at the tailgate.  Nice alternative to regular salsa.

I feel like boiling the mixture with all the spices really tones them down. I like to boil/roast the tomatillos to soften them. Then blend all the spices together as well as add a squeezed lime and omit the water.

Excellent! We always enjoy salsa verde in authentic Mexican restaurants but didn't know if we could duplicate. This recipe is every bit as good as anything we've had at a restaurant.

Instead of 2 cups water, use 1 cup water, 1/4 cup vinegar and juice of one lime. Add 1/2 tsp. sugar, if needed. (i cut back on the salt a little, too)

I followed another review and chopped up everything in the blender first and then cooked it without adding any water.  Also added the cilantro and oregano after the salsa had cooked.  This was my first salsa verde and I thought it was great.  Not only did I think it was great, but my husband and nieces also liked it!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Just wanted to put it out there that changing the water to vinegar, or adding vinegar, is not necessarily a good means of converting this recipe to make it safe for canning. To safely can salsa, use a recipe meant for canning or follow pH guidelines for canning and buy your own pH meter. Otherwise, the pH might not be low enough to make it safe. Also, tomatillos are not tomatoes, so one cannot presume to convert a canning recipe for tomato salsa to one for tomatillo salsa just by substituting one fruit for the other. The pH might not be the same.

This is an excellent salsa, and really easy.  I also put my tomatillos, onions, peppers & garlic in the blender before cooking.  Then add to pan, season and cook it.  Have never added water to it, and comes out perfect every time.  I change types & quantities of peppers depending on who all will be eating it, but when it's just hubby & me, it's perfect as written.  Thanks for the recipe.  We have enjoyed this salsa many times. :)

Way too much water...I mixed mine with raw blended tomatillos and fresh cilantro.  Adding whipping cream was a wonderful addition.  Yummy on Halibut enchiladas!

Flavor? Fantastic!!! Way too watery, though - I saw that mentioned in reviews, but like to follow the recipe the first time out.  However, flavor is surely more important than consistency - we're going to make a chicken soup with this as (part of at least) a base.  With a dollop of sour cream or yogurt.....chips on the side......tequila if it's Saturday night.......whoa whoooeee!!! Think that'll be great, and then we'll submit the recipe.

Perfect! So yummy!!! Based on other reviews I did only 1 1/3 c water & the juice of 1 lime. I want to drink this stuff  :-) made it as a dip, but it will make the most amazing enchiladas I'm sure. ***update- used it it Spinach Enchiladas Verde by Nicegirl52 AMAZING!!! Highly recommend using the recipes together for a delicious dinner!***

I have been looking for a good tomatillo salsa recipe, and think I have it.  This is one of the best I have every had!  I took the suggestion of Nina L and just blended the ingrediants first, then cooked, didn't come out too watery at all.  I also added the boullion cubes she suggested, was great!

Phenomenal flavour!

I blended all ingredients together and then put in saucepan and simmered for 20 minutes. I did omit the water because we like thick salsa. I will be freezing this in serving size containers. 

Thanks!

Man, this is good. I followed the ingredients to the letter, but I would make it a little spicier next time, perhaps adding more serrano. 
Easy and perfect for the tailgate!

Great recipe!  That is high praise from me, because I generally don't care for salsa.  I did as others did: did not add water; added lime juice and a little vinegar; added a few red toms.  I used jalapenos, a red chili, and a cayenne. (I like it hot.) I roasted the tomatillos and peppers in the broiler before adding them to the sauce pan.  The roasted flavor was wonderful.  I would be easy on the vinegar, as it can overwhelm.

I made this and it so good! I took the advice of previous reviewers and used only 1/2 cup water and 1/2 cup lime juice.  Blend all ingredients together first then cooked them. So easy. I also added more cerrano chilli's to spice it up. Delish!

I made this exactly according to the recipe the first time and loved it.  The only changes I made later was to drop the water and add 1/4 cup lime juice after reading some of the other reviews.

This is delicious!  I cooked it as directed, except I blended the tomatillos before cooking and added a tablespoon or so of apple cider vinegar before cooking.  Served warm over veggie fajitas (I couldn't wait for it to cool!) and then put 2 jars into the freezer and kept half a jar to use later this week.  I will be making this again, for sure!

Warning: your kitchen will smell amazing, and everyone will be begging to know what's for dinner!

So simple and straightforward.  Used a hand blender and was thrilled with the results... err... well, I overdid the salt, so I adjusted the taste by adding a touch of sugar... and I guess in my rush to get dinner on before my exhausted husband fell asleep on me (he'd had a looonnngg day unexpectedly - and actually he did fall asleep instead of eating *sigh*), but I didn't know that, so I overdid the sugar next.... which tasted.... well, probably not authentic at all, and not what I aimed for, but it did taste pretty good....... With the sweetness, rather than adding any more salt, I simply put in a bit of lime and it was pretty neat.  FWIW, we really enjoyed this - with the above alterations.  I'd never worked with tomatillos before but this was a good first experience.  I look forward to trying this recipe again more in line with the actual intent......

This turned out to be a great great salsa. I thinned it out a little with some water so I could use it as enchilada sauce...
I also added jalapenos to make it a little spicy and I roasted all peppers on the stove top  first...

came out excellent! thank you!

Very good flavor. I only used 1 cup of water and it was still a little runny. Next time I will use just enough water to keep everything from burning in the pan.

This is a fantastic recipe.  I added fresh jalapeno pepper because I did not have seranno and a red chilli because I had it and is delicious!  I will definately be making this again and again.  Thank you for the recipe!

This was my first time ever making this at home and it turned out terrific!  And, Nina L., thank you for the recommendation of putting in the blender first and then cooking.  The consistency was perfect that way!  I foresee me making much more of this as we are starting to grow our own tomatillos.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Thank you for sharing this recipe! I used a seeded jalapeno instead of a serrano because that's what I had and it's very mild. I plan to make chicken enchiladas and chile verde with it so I wanted it mild, but if I made a batch just to eat with tortilla chips I would want more heat. I can't wait to try this in my chile verde (the Colorado Green Chili recipe from this site).

With all fresh/organic vegetables this recipe is amazing, with a restaurant-quality taste. I tried it with fewer tomatillos and one less cup of water, but the same amount of seasoning, onions, and garlic. I also added one fresh tomato and one jalapeno and it turned out perfectly. I can't wait to share this one at work. : )

This is absolutely fabulous Salsa Verde. I will never buy it again! I decided to make my own since store bought has way too much salt added. This is SO EASY!! to make, and poured it over my authentic Mexico City Chili Rellenos. The BEST ever!!

Wow! This was sensational!  I did as others have suggested and blended all the ingredients first, then simmered for 15 minutes.  Instead of a serrano chile, I added 2 fresh jalapenos, seeds and all.  Deliciously spicy and hot!

After reading all the rave reviews, I cooked this recipe and was very disappointed . The oregano is a problem, as is too much water and not enough garlic.

I made this for the first time after being inspired by our local Mexican restaurant one Sunday and loved it. I put the onion, garlic and jalepeno in a food processor and then sauted in pan. I took other advice and cored the tomatillos and threw them right in the food processor as well. Added them to the pan and then added the spices and a handful of cilantro. Simmered for about 1/2 hour and added juice of one lime. I will use a little less lime juice next time and to make it chunkier just cut the garlic, onions and jalepeno.

Great recipe!  It was very easy to prepare.  I added 2 serrano peppers for a little extra kick and flavor, but other than that-followed the recipe as written.  It turned out great.  Thanks for the recipe; it's a keeper!

This recipe was fantastic as it was easy and delicious! I agree with the earlier comment to add extra garlic and I used jalepenos and threw some of the seeds in for some kick (about 1 1/2 jalepenos worth). I had so many people ask for the recipe! We used it as dip for tortillas and the next day used the leftovers to mix in with some Orzo pasta and chicken... amazing!!!

I had to cater a Mexican BBQ for 60 people, and wanted to give them authentic salsas instead of the usual. This was one of them. Even people who thought it was guacamole, (yes, there were a few), and ones who never had it, loved it. Not as hot or spicy as you might expect. It is so fresh tasting with all the great things that go into it. I had jalapeno, so that was what I used. I had leftovers, and have been using it all week. Froze some in individual bags for future. Try it.

This recipe was absolutely yummy!  I poured it over enchiladas and I have to say that it added alot of flavor.  My husband really loved it!  Next time I won't add the water like some of the other reviewers suggested, and allow it to create it's own juices.  Won't go back to jarred salsa ever again!!

I modified this to make it into "salsamole". I used red onions, subbed some of the water with chicken broth, and added a diced Anaheim pepper to the simmering mix. Once it was liquefied in the blender, I added an avocado. It came out delicious!

I followed the advice of others and only added 1/2 cup of water, I added lime juice, another pepper.  But I wish I would have left the Cumin out.  I will make it again with out that and see if I like it better.  Thanks.

Wow! Fantastic salsa and so simple.  I used a tablespoon of canned jalapenos instead of the serrano and added 1/4 cup lime juice.  We mixed this with chopped grilled chicken for some killer verde enchiladas.  

We will be bottling this recipe next summer.

The only flaw I have found is that it doesn't seem to be all that spicy. I definitely know that Salsa Verde is just a medium on the spicy scale but for someone like me who thinks movie nacho cheese is pretty spicy, I was suprised that I could down this very easily. I followed the recipe exactly this time however next time I'm going to double the cumin and serrano pepper.

I really liked the taste of this recipe, but it was kind of watery for me.  This may be due to the fact I doubled the recipe.  I did note it thickens up a bit when it cools. Next time, I will reduce the water to 1/2 to 2/3 to see how it turns out.

Mmmm! This salsa is SO yummy! We like it hot in our house, so I actually put two serrano peppers instead of one. I also added one chicken bouillon cube, and the juice of 1/2 a lime, and a little extra garlic. DELISH! Perfect for my green chile enchilada casserole, and also perfect for dipping with tortilla chips. I will double the recipe next time!

This is so easy and yet delicious.  My first batch was a tad runny (especially for enchiladas) so I decreased the water to 1 3/4 cups.  Thanks for sharing--it's perfect!

I've made this salsa twice now. Ingredients should say seedless serrano chili pepper. After it's all done simmering I don't blend with any water because the tomatillos make enough juice to blend. I just use a big plastic spoon with holes to get everything out of the pot and place in blender. I let the salsa sit out and cool down before placing in the fridge. After an hour and around dinner time it's cool enough to eat. It's so good! My husband loves this recipe! Thank you for sharing!

This is the most consistently good and popular recipe I make.  I usually make it right before the party starts and serve it warm with chips- good every time!

I'm not use to eating Tomatillos and didn't like it but other people did enjoy the salsa.   I'll use the salsa as a marinated for meats.

I used 3 Serrano peppers and I roasted all vegetables prior to making the sauce. I also substituted fresh ground pink himalayan salt for table salt. It is Chicken Fajita night in house and this homemade salsa verde is gping to be a huge hit!

I add 1/2 cup of sugar and use less water so that it's thicker. I use an immersion blender after it's cooked about 30 minutes. I use this as a relish.

Took some of the commenting advice and blended all the ingredients first without the water. It makes enough of its own, I added a touch of white vinegar too and cooked it all aster blending. Delicious! Will definitely make again; however, I will roast the tomatillos first as I know it will have even more flavor.

Only changed the recipe a little bit. Used some chicken broth to cook down the tomatillos, onions, garlic and peppers. Then threw an entire bunch of cilantro in the mix, followed by a lot of fresh oregano. Simmer then put in the blue Nader. Used it as the sauce for Pork Verde. It turned out amazing!

Good basic verde recipe that easily lends itself to modification. My suggestion... don’t add the water! I put all the ingredients (coarse chopped) NO WATER in a food processor and blend together and pour into a sauce pan to heat. Fresh oregano, cilantro and garlic is a must. I add lime juice after the cooking process. Absolutely delicious on chicken enchiladas with cojita cheese!!

I blended all the ingredients before boiling/simmering on the stove top.  I added the juice from a lime, used two serrano chile peppers instead of one, and I didn't add oregano.   I didn't add the water until after blending, and I used one cup instead of two.  I will definitely make this again.  Next time I might add the oregano; I simply didn't have fresh oregano on hand.   It was flavorful with a subtle kick.

I made this to use some tomatillos from our garden and I only had 4 so I halved the recipe. I followed the advice of other reviewers and used lime juice, skipped the water, and blended everything in a food processor first. This is so delicious I decided to grow more tomatillos next year! Thanks!

I read others reviews and this is how I rolled; I put the tomatillos and one jalapeno in the food processor and processed until smooth. I then added this to the pan and added juice of one lime,  1tsp cumin, 2 teaspoons chicken bullion, 1 tsp of dried Mexican oregano, 1tsp of white vinegar and cooked on low for 20 min. I let it cool and added a tbs of fresh finely chopped cilantro. From here on this will be my go to tomatillo salsa

Taste was great but way too watery. Have to Use a mesh strainer to drain out the extra liquid or it would’ve been soup.

Use 1/4 to 1/2 cup less water because your adding 5-8 roasted jalapenos and 2-3 roasted pasilla peppers. Adding peppers creates more liquid.

I made this following the directions and it came out quite thin and a little bland (but spicy!). Added a little vinegar and lime juice and some more garlic and boiled off some of the liquid. Would definitely add water as needed next time rather than adding it all up front.

Great recipe to tweak to your personal tastes. I used half a Serrano and it was too spicy for my mild tastes. Half the salt was good for me. Simmered everything in half chicken stock and half water.

Easy to make and delicious - even our girlie loved it! Simple salsa that you can up the heat factor by adding and extra pepper if you want - but our family enjoyed it as per the recipe. Will make again.

Everyone liked it.  I did pay attention to the helpful hints and therefore deviated by 1) blending before cooking to reduce water, 2) replaced water with chicken broth - no vegans here, 3) added a touch of cumin.  Overall, this is a good recipe.  Look forward to adding some simmered chunky onions and mild peppers to the mixture and using it to smother burritos!

I made this tonight. I didn't have full amount of tomatillos so reduced water some and added a tomato that needed using. I put in about 1/4 cup lime juice and extra onion. And used 2 habaneros. It was a bit watery so I added some chia seeds to each bottle while they were still cooling. My friend, who loves habanero anything, just texted me to say it is really good. (I just finished it before she left my house and it was still warm.) I moved to Mexico from US a year ago and developing my pallet for hotter peppers. I do like the flavor and will continue to make this with some of the modifications suggested by others.

I made a half batch just in case we didn't like it. I've had some really good green salsa at restaurants but, never made any myself. I've also never used tomatillos before either.  Other than halfing the most of the ingredients, I used two Serrano peppers instead of one. My wife and I both like it. I've added it to chicken, fish, and steak. Next time we have fajitas, this is definitely going on them.

This is a great recipe. We like our salsa with body, so I sometimes double the garlic and add half raw just before mixing it all up. I’ve also roasted peppers and added them at the end. You can lemon it up too. Great as a dip or a cooking sauce for chicken, beef or pork. A classic!

If you make this salsa using NINA L.'s review (the first one where she tells you how to blend it), you would be making a HUGE mistake if you didn't double the recipe!  This is perfection!  I bought some jalapenos that I needed to use up and found this recipe, but they didn't have any zip at all, so I added a serrano pepper.  This wasn't at all spicy, but the flavor is yummy.  I made some enchiladas and used this.  I think that tomorrow I'll make some eggs for breakfast and use up the last of the salsa.  Thanks for this recipe!  My husband thanks you, too!

LOVE IT!! Feels like I am at my fave mexican restaurant. Personal note, when it says to blend in batches. DO IT!! I filled my blender 1/2 way and that was too full. Salsa everywhere! Lesson learned. Will be making this again and again!

I took the advice of "Nina L." and blended the ingredients (with the exclusion of the cilantro and oregano) together first...shortening the cooking time by a lot and reached the perfect consistency without having to guess.   I cooked the mixture almost dry.  I took more advice from "Judy" and added 1/2 c. of fresh lime juice at the end with the cilantro and oregano.  All the modifications were to suit my family's likes....the recipe is great just as is.  Thanks Kimberly Binning!   I never try a recipe with out consulting the reviews.   FANTASTIC modifications ladies!

I don’t like spicy so I picked the seeds out of the hot peppers. I took the suggestion of blending everything before cooking.  I didn’t add ANY water and I thought it was perfect consistency.  I did go shy on the salt but countered with a little chicken Better Than Bouillon. I wish I had lime on hand.

I made this using tomatillos from my garden- I blended the tomatillos, garlic, onion and peppers in my blender. Added no water, but added about 1/3 C. lime juice (had 3 1/2 lb tomatillos so adjusted the recipe accordingly) and a splash of vinegar. Brought to a boil and simmered for 15 minutes. This is really good! It made 1/2 of a dutch oven pot. I hope to harvest a lot more tomatillos and can some of this in pints- yummy!

As I was making this salsa it smelled amazing! I used half of the water mentioned in the recipe and jalapeño pepper (seeded & deveined) instead. It was a tad bit spicy but overall good. A little watery even with using half of the water recommended. I would recommend simmering it to the desired consistency and adding some lime juice for added flavor. Otherwise a good salsa verde.

WOW!  What a great salsa!  Holy Moly...  I have actually never made salsa before.  I got a ton of tomatillos from a produce co-op that I participate in so decided to try it.  Usually I will go through all the reviews to see what others have tried & this time was no different.  I washed & quartered all the tomatillos (about 3ish lbs) then added them directly to the saucepan.  Then I rough chopped a whole white onion, 2 large garlic cloves, 2 jalapeños (seeds & membranes & all), a handful of fresh cilantro & oregano.  Then I added 2 heaping teaspoons of cumin & a tablespoon of my favorite Tastefully Simple season salt.  Brought the whole pot to a boil, then simmered until everything was soft & reduced.  Emersion blendered the entire batch & VOILA!  What an amazing salsa - the whole family agreed!  No water or vinegar needed.  Will definitely be making this again.  Thank you!!

Roasted the tomatillos and onions slightly before cooking them with much less water along with the chili, and drained and cooled the mix before adding the spices and half a bunch of cilantro (no oregano) and blending them with the juice and zest of half a lime; that way it's not all overcooked watery mush.

Result was a lovely fresh tasting (and looking) salsa that wasn't watery or soupy. 

The draining gave more control over the consistency and texture of the salsa, depending on preference. Kept the drained liquid and added it to a homemade tomato sauce.

Needs lime juice. Roast veggies & garlic in oven for more flavor. Otherwise easy to make and good flavor. I used three jalapeños as I already had some leftover from something else.

I recently made this recipe, following it mostly. The resulting taste was excellent, but the consistency was very watery (also noted by other reviewers). So this turned out to be a great Mexican sauce for a dinner, but not a great sals.

Here are the changes I made: I did not have the serrano chili, but I did have dried New Mexico chilis, so I reconstituted one of those in a half cup hot water. I then substituted that 1/2 cup of chili flavored water for a 1/2 cup of the plain water called for in the ingredients.  Lastly, I used dried oregano rather than fresh because that's what I had on hand.

Like I said, it's great flavor, but watery so it makes a sauce, not a salsa. To make a salsa, I'd reduce the water to 1/2 cup to start, only adding more water as it cooks if it appears too thick.

Good recipe, but I added a few things to my own taste. If you don't like the wateryness of this recipe, try adding a couple avocados and cutting the 2 cups of water. Tomatillos are naturally watery anyways.

I increased this recipe by 8 times to can it. I only used half of the water it called for and still had to boil down the mixture to get the right consistency.  The taste was great! Maybe a little less salt next time. This would be good as a spicy chicken enchilada sauce.

I have used this recipe twice.  Both times turned out too watery (second time I cut the water amount) and I had to boil out some of the water to get to desired texture.  Otherwise good taste.

Made it a little different so it's difficult to accurately rate but what I took from this recipe was the cooking. I do not typically cook my salsas.  The cooking helped the tomatillos have a  more depth - full flavour.   I only cooked my ingredients more gently for about 5 minutes.  I then added some more fresh cilantro.  I used 4 jalapenos because I wanted more heat and three garlic cloves.  Also I only used 1 and 1/4 cups water.  2 cups seemed like a lot but maybe it cooks off if you are going with the longer simmer per the instructions.  I added some pinches of  dehydrated red bell peppers minced onion after I removed from the heat.  I like to add some red color to my green salsa for pizazz plus it helps absorb a little liquid.  It came out great and I plan to use the cook method for this type of tomatillo salsa from now on.  It is worth the wait if you refrigerate before serving .  Thanks for the recipe.  Will make again closer to instructions.  :)

I roasted jalapeños, onions, garlic and tomatillos.  Then took advice of other reviewers and threw all ingredients into food processor.  Instead of water I used lime juice because I love it!!  Once in the sauce pan to cook, I did find I needed to add a bit of water as it was way too thick.  But otherwise, an hour into it being completed it is delicious.  Easy to make although any salsa will likely have a decent amount of steps.  Very nummy

Decided to do the canning option and substituted vinegar for the water...and all I can taste is the vinegar!  I'll make again using the regular recipe, but unless the canned version improves with age, I'm not impressed.

I followed the recipe except for a couple exceptions. I roasted all the vegetables instead of putting them a saucepan. I made 2 batches. In one batch, I added some fresh garden tomatoes to the veggies when I roasted them. I didn't have any cilantro but would certainly add some next time. It was still very good.

I doubled the recipe but still only used one cup of water. It was still quite watery but I believe that is how traditional salsa verde is served.

Flavor is great, but I agree with a previous reviewer to blend first then boil and omit the water. I made it by the recipe first and it was way too watery. I will freeze this and  use for porch Chile  verde in the crockpot. Second batch blending fist and omitting water was perfect for salsa

Unfortunately, I didn't read the reviews before I started this. WAY too much water called for. I had 6 pounds of tomatillos and now I'm having to cook it all down to get to the right consistency. This will take hours since I added 11 cups. This should say 1/4 cup at the most. The tomatillos add enough. I think the flavor will be fine once all the extra water is gone. One star for faulty recipe, 4 stars for flavor.

Excellent! Used roasted garlic with fresh tomatillos. They were small and quite tart, so I added about half a teaspoon of sugar just to cut the sharpness and let the heat of the serrano shine through. Blended in the saucepan with a hand blender. Next time will start with 1 1/2 c water as it was quite soupy.

I followed this recipe exactly as described today to accompany my husband's homemade quesadillas and we LOVED it. It was bright, fresh, tangy and so incredibly easy to make.  We love Mexican food and having this in my culinary arsenal at home is exciting.  

I can see how some of the changes suggested by other reviewers would be really good, but by itself this is an excellent salsa.  I can also see making a big batch and either freezing or canning it as others have suggested.  

Thank you for this recipe!  I'll definitely be making it again and again.

The key to thick salsa is to grind it all up FIRST then cook for 15 minutes as another reader mentioned.  I also use 1/2 a Haberneo pepper (we live in Texas and like HOT)  and its got a GREAT kick, loved it.  Going to try canning it next time .  Thank you for the great recipe, its easy and tastes really good.

My husband made this Easy sauce (since I was working) and it came out so tasty! He did reduce the amount of water  to just one cup of water since it was becoming "soupy". He may put a little less water next time so it is a little thicker. BUT HEY YOUR PREFERENCE :) also we added an extra serrano pepper!

I made two batches. One with only 1/2 serrano pepper and the other with 1 and 1/2 peppers. I needed it to be a little sweeter so I use 1 cup of Guava Puree and 1/2 cup water. Used this as a cover sauce for some home made Venezuelan style Empanadas. For normal Mexican Salsa Verde not so sweet.

This was simple and delicious!!! I do agree with other reviews a bit watery but I will use this as a sauce over things so perfect for this!! It came out a bit spicer then I thought it would so next time I will add the Serrano pepper when I blend it.  great in the freezer I put it in a ice cube tray to make " single " servings of this so its easier to thaw just enough for a quick bite.. Freeze it solid then transfer to a storage freezer bag. Thanks for the recipe!

I make it a little thicker and spicier than the original recipe.  I boil the tomatillos, then drain the water before putting them in the food processor.  I added two diced serrano peppers and two diced jalapeño peppers to give it a little more spice.  Then I simmer all the ingredients together for 15 minutes.

Everyone that has tasted this has raved on this salsa verde. My son went through a jar in a weekend dipping tortilla  chips in it but we love it for anything grilled or most chicken dishes. 

We took many of the comments and suggestions by going 50-50 on vinegar water, roasting the tomatillos and adding chicken bouillon.  Nice and tart!

I used two of the previous suggestions: added some lime juice and put it through the food processor before I cooked it.  I loved the taste and the way it came out.  No other recipe I have tried compares to this one.

Very good recipe. I had to double, maybe triple the serranos to get enough heat in it, but everything else balanced out quite nicely. It was a bit watery for my taste as well, so I just let it cook down for 20 minutes or so after blending.

This was really good, but as other reviewers commented it was really watery.  I think next time I will simmer the tomatillos in water until soft then drain, then blend and then simmer everything again without additional water.

Fantastic! I had a hankering for salsa verde and this hit the spot! I served it with chicken tacos. It was delicious with tortilla chips too.  My only change was I had to use dried oregano because my grocery store didn't have fresh. The salsa is runny which is okay with me - our local taqueria's  is runny too.  So, if runny doesn't work for you, you might want to check out other's reviews to see how you can change that. I, personally, wouldn't change a thing. Thank you, Kimberly, for this fabulous recipe - it's a keeper! :)

The flavor was amazingly good, but I will use less water next time. It was runny. Since I didnt have them, I just used 2 small jalapeños instead of the Serrano pepper.

Added only half the water and it was still too watery for me.   Used a small jalapeño instead of Serrano; whole until added to blender.

The Good: Best Salsa verde I've ever had! I followed the recipe to the T, except I used a habanero pepper instead of a serrano, and added a bit more salt.

The Bad: WAY too much water! I probably used over a pound of tomatillos, and waited and waited for the water to boil off. I left them on the stove for about a half hour until I took them off before the tomatillos lost their flavor. I drained the water into a seperate bowl before I processed them. Next time, I'm only using 1 cup of water.

I really liked this recipe. Used 2/3s of 1 jalepeno instead of serranos. Will try serranos next time.  Also blended it all before cooking it.

The flavor was really good, but I only used half the liquid, and still thought it was runny, and maybe a little washed out...I took advice of another poster and processed the ingredients in a food processor first, then simmered...also added vinegar to can (I know, I know it's not an approved canning recipe, yadda yadda)...used fresh herbs and garlic.  Would make again.

Delicious -  We did as others had suggested and blended it first, and we loved it straight out of the blender so much we didn't even cook it. We did not add the water, and the consistency was perfect. Yum!! We are going to grow more tomatillos next year :-)

Easy to make and so tasty. You can seriously make this in just a few minutes. Good on so many foods. Chicken enchiladas, or eggs. However my favorite is Chilie verde... Saute some pork and onion slices then pour on this green sauce and simmer, serve with flour tortillas. Just that simple and it tastes like you've been slaving in the kitchen for hours.

Added 1C tequila while cooking, and increased fresh cilantro to about a cup or so  (rough handful).  Also added fresh lime including pulp.  Great recipe!

I hadn't read the comments til I was already cooking. Used 2 jalapeños instead and a splash of white vinager.  I loved it, great additive to fajita night. Not too spicy in any way, so it's a yummy sauce for rice and everything else.

I made this in trailer so was missing a few things.  I had no oregano so subbed Italian seasoning. I put everthing in blender first. I added lime juice in place of water.  We enjoyed it on chicken burritos.  I will makes as written from home. We will be enjoying this often

I made this as directed, except I didn't have any cilantro. It's good, but I think I'll keep looking for a go-to salsa verde recipe. The oregano and cumin flavors are a little distracting to me. One nice thing this recipe taught me though: one serrano with its seeds is the right amount of spice for me!

I lay the tomatillos (8), a whole onion cut in half, garlic cloves and jalapeño on baking sheet, drizzle with olive oil and bake at 375 until its all tender, about 15-20 minutes.  Then blend it up and add herbs to taste (cilantro, cumin, oregano, S&P).  Great recipe!

The added-water requirment probably depends on how juicy your tomatillos are, but I just roasted mine with the onions and a bit of olive oil (450 deg, 40 mins), until the tomatillos had burst, and then blended them along with all the other ingredients. Fantastic salsa!!

This is a good base recipe but needs some work. It didn't taste like the one at Moes. I might try the roasted garlic recipe on this site. Also, I made the mistake of adding all the liquid to the blender and I ended up with green water. Had to boil it down for an hour to get some of the liquid off.

The flavor was very good and it was easy yo make but waaaay to watery for my taste. The tortillas soaked up the liquid and came out mushy. But they tasted good! I'll use another recipe next time I make enchiladas verde

I made the salsa twice, one using two cups of vinager as sugested by others and one with one cup of vinager. I used everything it called for and maybe a little more of each item. Good but to 2 cups vinagre was to much. I had to add two cups water to help out. Not to bad in yhe end.  
The second time I used all but cilantro, used a green bell pepper and only one cup of vinager. This time on yhe second batch, I boiled the tomatill until smooth and soft creating it's in liqued. Added all ingredients,  Then added the vin ager  and then boiled it some more. Finally blend it. It came out thicker and tasted much  better.  I can 8 quarts of salsa today. Yum.  
I think this salsa once blended is better as a sauce more then for chips. If you hand mix /blend it would be perfect for chips... 

2.5 lbs husker
1 onion
3 to 5 whole garlic
1 bell peper
1/2 tsp cumin
2 serrano peppers
1 cup vinager
Salt to taste.....

I always saute my peppers last due to the steam it produced while cooking at hot temp. Yummmmm

Excellent Salsa Verde. I blended the tomatillos, onions garlic and pepper in food processor before cooking for about 15 min.  Added cilantro, oregano, cumin and salt to the cooking mix. That was it! Awesome taste!

A great recipe!  I simplified the recipe by blending all ingredients in a blender BEFORE cooking and adding only 1/2 c water.  I left the recipe almost the same (besides using  less water), except I added a lot more cilantro just because I like it.  After you puree the ingredients,  pour into a saucepan, bring to a boil and then simmer 10 to 12 minutes.  Yum!  I made chicken verde enchiladas with the leftover salsa and they were delicious!

Love this. So easy to do. I also used a blender first and just used vinegar to help move things along in the blender. I also upped the cumin, onion and garlic just because I like my salsa pretty kicked up.

I added lime juice, a dash of orange juice, and since my friend forgot her grocery list when she went into town (we live in the woods) I used basil instead of oregano. This salsa was amazing. I like that it has room to adjust to what the chef has. Best enchiladas I have made yet. Thanks so much!

I had 5 pounds of tomatillos from the garden so I tripled the recipe and this recipe worked great for canning.I did not even have to cook it because they cook in the jars in the pressure canner. Just grind all raw ingredients up together and pour in your jars. Added juice from one lime and 2 TBSP. of red wine vinegar (remember I TRIPLED the original recipe so cut this amount back if you are just making a single amount) and was able to omit the salt. Process 10 minutes at 5 pounds of pressure.

I added a small bunch of cilantro because i love it and jalapeño (I like things spicy) and added 1/2 cup vinegar and 1/2 tsp of sugar to balance the vinegar.

Before serving, I add some chopped cilantro, chopped vidalia onion and a little more fresh seeded, de-veined  jalapeño and it absolutely amazingly fresh.

Love this recipe! Thanks!

I had no cilantro, so I substituted about 10 fresh basil leaves.  I did not add the water because my tomatillos were quite ripe and we like thicker salsa.   Turned out great!   Tastes like a garden.

Great salsa verde! I only had canned tomatillos...next time I will use fresh. Used "not chicken" broth instead of water, but used only about 1 1/4 cups. Very easy to make, especially with an immersion blender. I LOVE my immersion blender! Thank you for the recipe!

I made this just because I needed this as an ingredient in my Chile Verde II recipe on this site. WOW!!! Lots of flavor, worth the work. I used two Serrano Chile's for the heat. I didn't boil it. I charred everything then pureed. Yum

I just made this and I always tweak things a little bit so I added pasilla pepper little bit of jalapeno. I also use chicken bouillon and it gives it even more flavor. I also put in more cumin and garlic and cilantro then it called for turned out great. :-)

Awesome! Thank you Kimberly for sharing. I did follow some other suggestions and roasted the tomatillos, peppers and garlic. Also used lime juice and added no water, but your recipe brought me to this! I made a double batch for a party last weekend and there was nothing left! Everyone loved it. Lots of compliments. You can really taste the "freshness" of the ingredients. I am making another batch now for another party this weekend. Smells wonderful! Thanks again!

I made a few adjustments for what was available to me in my fridge. I used 4 Anaheim peppers,3 jalapeños, and 1 bunch of green onions and ½ cup chicken broth. For the oregano, I used Mexican oregano (I grilled the Anaheim peppers until black all over, then placed in a zip lock for 15 minutes, peeled and rinsed.) I boiled the tomatillos and jalapenos for 7 or 8 minutes drained and set aside.  I only used the chicken broth to blend the cilantro, garlic, and green onions. Then added the rest of the ingredients. I would not recommend adding any more liquid. The tomatillos have plenty of natural juice. I rate super yummy and will use this for my chicken and pork tamale’s.

Brava! This is authentic salsa Mexicana.  The ranch hands are getting it as part of their lunch con jalapeno.  This is a critical crowd, six Hispanic hard working people who know how Mexican food should taste.  Great recipe as is, just make plenty, especially if you also serve guacamole or add mashed avocado to salsa. FYI winter is the time for cilantro in south Texas, so either dry your own or use corriander (cilantro)seed.  As to limes, cut them and place them on table as people want different amounts of tartness. Buen provecho!

I used 12 medium tomatillos, 2 small jalapeno's, 1 large pasilla pepper, half an onion, 1-2 T cilantro, salt to taste and juice from half a lime. Roasted the tomas, peppers and onion. The roasted tomas were bursting with juice so i poured that in as well. I put all of the roasted stuff in a ziplock bag and pulled and seeded the peppers until everything went into the blender. The salt, lime and cilantro were the last to go in. This was by far my the easiest and tastiest recipe! Last time i made it, i used way too much lime juice and it was so overpowering, this time the half a lime juice seemed to be just the right amount.

This is a good starter recipe. It had an OK flavor except no heat. I used 2 serrano peppers and couldn't taste them (maybe they were duds?). Felt it needed a little citric acid so I added a tsp. of lemon juice which really brightened up the herb flavors. Also way too runny. I drained them before putting them the blender (my husband loved the consistency). I will try this again but with habanero's, lime juice, and 1/2 the water.

I made a batch a while back and loved it. I was concerned that there was too much cumin in the recipe, but it's the cumin that adds complexity and depth to the flavor. Great recipe - I doubt I will ever be able to go back to store-bought salsa verde!

Great recipe and easy to make. Much better than any store bought kind. I added just a little chicken broth when I use with chicken recipes. Will have to try adding the lime juice and cilantro.

I usually start with 4 to 5 pounds of tomatillos.  After removing the husk and washing, we roast one large sweet onion, one to two heads of garlic, peppers, and tomatillos on the gas grill.  Great flavor just grind after everything is cooked after pealing or squeezing the garlic, and peeling the onion.  Be careful sometimes the tomatillos will shoot juice while on the grill.  A very small amount of unsweetened rice vinegar or Cajun Power Garlic Juice(Vinegar and Garlic Juice)  This weekend made with freshly roasted Hatch Chilies from New Mexico.  Peel, seed and grind.  Fantastic flavor!

Great recipe. I personally LOVE salsa verde! I did change a couple of things. I substituted the 2 cups of water for 1/2 cup of water and a 1/2 white distilled vinegar and 1 whole jalapeno pepper instead of the serrano. I also blended ALL the ingredients 1st then simmered it in a pot for about 15 minutes. Turns out perfect. Tart, tangy, and just hot enough. Eat it right away or can it for later. Thanks for a fantastic recipe!

I used fresh cilantro instead of cumin and snagged some fresh oregano from the garden. Also, a squeeze of lime. About 1 Tbs, I guess. No water. Great, fresh flavor! And so easy, YUM!

I read the reviews and mixed it up.  Roasted the peppers and pepper.  Then boiled it with a fraction of the water, then blended with other ingredients.  Added some lime juice and a little bit of sugar.

!Que Rico!  This is a wonderful recipe!  My husband brought home a big bag of tomatillos from the store and I tried this ...and we ended up eating it out of bowls like soup!  I wouldn't change a thing (well, ok, we like it spicy and I added an extra serrano)  AND I looked it up and 1/2 cup has only 18 calories...yes, you read that right!

Yum! I blended before cooking and, like other reviewers suggested, used vinegar and less water -- Will try without the vinegar next time. It is a bit sour, but still very, very good!

My husband loves the salsa verde served at one of our local hole in the wall taco joints so I decided to make this recipe.  He LOVED it.  It was exactly like what we get at the taco restaurant and maybe even a bit better.  I will certainly make it again.

I grew tomatillos in my garden for the first time this year AND my husband LOVES salsa....so this was a big hit. I didn't use as much of the hot pepper as it calls for, as you can always add more, but can't take it out once it's in! We eat it all up each time I make it.

Roast the tomatillos and Serrano peppers instead of boiling. Then toss all as above in the blender.

I'm giving a 5 but next time, I may cut back on the water just a bit, I'd like it a little thicker.  I believe it all has to do with the size of the tomatillos, maybe mine were small.  Even my daughter loved the taste.  I will say I did cheat just a little in that I used a big jalapeno instead of a serrano.  I was afraid of the heat and this was perfect.

I doubled the garlic and halved the water.  I made this with 3 other salsa recipes for canning, and this one turned out the best.  With my edits to quantities it's a 5 star recipe.  This is mildly spiced salsa.

Simple.  I had a few revisions though.  I had used dried oregano instead of fresh.. I blended everything in a food processor first before boiling.  2 cups of water is way too much.  I used 1 cup and thought that was too much, I ended up draining more than half the water out after boiling/simmering ...because I don't like runny saucy.  Will make this again.

As one reviewer suggested, I chopped the tomatillos and ran them through a food processor before cooking which made the salsa super easy to make. I also added about 1 T lime juice before cooking. Took this to a party and it got rave reviews as well as lots of oohs and aahs that it was homemade! Thanks Kimberly Binning for sharing.

This worked great for what I was making it for... I too blended everything then put in a sauce pan and cooked it.. I was using as a condiment for grilled honey lime sandwiches from the food network site and it made the sandwich great.. I just cooked it until it was not runny..

This was so easy and delicious!  Will be making this frequently.  I thought the recipe was great as is. We ate it over chicken tostadas and also with chips....and then my husband with just a spoon! I am looking forward to trying some of the suggestions from other reviewers.  Thanks for posting!

FANTASTIC! I added half a boullion cube to the water and instead of the serrano I roasted Hatch chili peppers. After peeling and seeding the peppers I added about 8 of them to the pot, simmered it on low , uncoverd for about 45 minutes. The consistency was not watery and the taste was amazing. Low calorie too!!! Enjoy!

I made a few changes to the recipe. I KNOW, it isn't the exact way, therefore, it's really not the recipe as some reviewers have said. But anyhoo, that being said, I threw in a couple of pieces of chopped green bell pepper into the blender, AND did not use any of the water I boiled the tomatillos & jalapeños in. Perfect consistency & not too watery as others said. I seeded one jalapeño & left the other as is. It was spiced perfectly (to my family's taste anyway). I also added the juice from one small lime (Key lime). We loved it! Just like the salsa verde they use/serve at authentic Mexican restaurants. Awesome!! :)

Love the simplicity of this recipe. The only thing that I do different is add a jalapeno or two. I also let it cook for about an hour because I like it a little thicker.  This is a keeper.

WONDERFUL !! Best I have ever made. I did take the advice of Nina L (under most helpful reviews ) by switching the cook then blend to her vice-versa method, I was able to eliminate almost all the water. This is my go-to recipe for company and every time I decide to cook Mexican ! Thanks for sharing Kimberly !

I tweaked this recipe a bit because I had lots of green tomatoes left over after the harvest.  I added about 6 small tomatoes to the tomatillos and two jalapeno peppers and the finished product was just as delicious as the original recipe (except a little spicier).  Had a lot of salsa so I canned what we didn't use immediately.

I have to admit that I used this recipe as a stepping stone.. I'm sure it is delicious as written but I couldn't buy fresh oregano and I wanted fire roasted tomatillos so I ran with it.  
After roasting the tomatillos I used an immersion blender to puree them, put them into a large sauce pan & set aside.
I then placed an entire bunch of cilantro, half of a sweet onion, a seeded jalapeño, 1/2 teaspoon garlic pepper, 1 heaping teaspoon of minced garlic and a 1/4 cup of water into the immersion blender cup & whirred until smooth then added it to the saucepan.
To the saucepan I added a heaping tablespoon of chicken base, 1 heaping teaspoon of dried oregano  and a tablespoon of cumin. Brought the mixture to a boil, reduced to a simmer for 5 minutes & Yummmmmmm!

Really good and simple.  I blended the tomatillos up in the magic bullet with onion ahead of time so idiot need to add water. It also had a jalapeño from the yard and used that without a lot of the ribs and seeds but it still had great heat.  Go ahead and buy those tomatillos!

I just used this for a basic recipe and didn't pay close attention to measurements and left a few spices out and it still came out nicely.

I could just eat it with a spoon! While I did cook the tomatillos in the said amount of water, I drained a little off before I used my immersion blender to mix it. I did add some vinegar, about 2 TBS, and I added jc of 1 lime at the end, because I love that acidity. Man, with some warmed-up tortilla chips, just stay away from me and my bowl! Thank you for sharing!

Fabulous recipe and so easy! The cumin and oregano give it a nice added bit of flavor. I like to add just a little bit of sugar to balance out the acid and tangy taste of the tomatillos and also omitted the water since the cooked tomatillos provide enough of their own juice. Other than that, this is by far the best green salsa recipe I've found.

Way too watery for us.  Perhaps it was just our tomatillos but I would suggest starting with just 1/4 cup of water and then adding a little as needed until you get the consistency you want.  Great flavor as is but even better with a little lime basil and lime juice.

Delicious! Very easy and yummy. I used my immersion blender to smooth it out. If it's too watery, you need to simmer it longer- that's all there is to it! Try scrambling some into your eggs- it's a real treat!

Love this salsa~~but do not use 2 cups of water!!  It makes Verde Soup.  The liquid I do use is a little chicken broth, I think I might try another chef's review.  Putting it all in the blender prior to the sauce pan, using less liquid.  I used an immersion blender right in the pan and it worked wonderfully!  Thanks for posting!  This is delicious on just about anything!

Oh my, this is what salsa verde is to be! I did what other have sugessted and rosted my tomatillos along with the peppers and onions. didnt have garlic so used garlic salt a little later instead of salt. Blended all together then simmered down used some lemon juice, and a teaspoon of viniger so didnt need any water, has a really good flavor and texture. will make again hopefully with fresh garlic.

best advice: blend first, then it'll have perfect consistency.

This was by far the very best enchilada sauce I've ever had. Like some of the other people I choose to omit the water and purée everything first, cook it and then purée it again.

This stuff is amazing!! The only thing I did differently was that after I blended the tomatillo salsa, I poured it back in the sauce pan and let it cook down a little because it was a bit watery due to the fact that I could only find about 4/5th's of a pound of tomatillos. I kept all the other quantities the same. Amazing!

My kids were literally eating this salsa by the spoonful!  It's that good!

I used a hefty handful of cilantro, because I didn't want it to go to waste and I subbed a jalepeno for the serrano, because it's what I had on hand.  I also didn't add all the cooking liquid to the blender - the results were fabulous.  I will definitely add this to our keeper list!

Really nice flavor - mine was a little thin so I had to reboil for a bit after puree step but it all came out fine. I did not have serrano chile so I substituted a jalapeno and the heat was a bit less than I expected - more warm than hot but very nice. Thanks for a great recipe!

Awesome recipe!  I used extra cilantro, regular jalapenos, only 1 cup of water, and about 1 tspn of vinegar.  It could be a little less watery...next time I will try making it without water since the tomatoes have a good amount of water content.  Yummy warm or cold!  :)

I served this at a Memorial Day cookout and it was a HUGE hit.  I did find that using 2 cups of water meant I needed a longer cook-down time to get a more sauce-like consistency, so next time I'll only use 1.5 cups.  I used two jalapenos rather than a serrano.  Also, I would recommend using an immersion blender if you have one - it breaks up the tomatillos more evenly.

I wish I would have remembered Nina L's review before I made a double batch of this. It was way too watery prior to blending so I took out 2 cups of water before proceeding. It was still very watery after blending with the remaining 2 cups of water. I boiled it down to salvage it. Flavor is ok but I'm sure it would have been better.

I was a little disappointed with this.  I am a lover of salsa, but this was basic and ok.  Maybe roasting the ingredients would have brought more flavors out.

Yummy!  I, too, did what Nina L suggested and blended all, adding chicken stock and blending all ingredients then cooking for 15 mins. SOOOOOO Yummy! I hated Mexican food but now trying authentic stuff, I am getting used to it!
