I've just realized the fatal flaw in this recipe.  For some reason allrecipes.com listed the ingredient as '1 tablespoon' of egg.  It should be 1 egg!

I thought these were very good.  I probably had about 1.5 lbs. of ground lamb and cut the garam masala back by half as I feared my 11 year old wouldn't eat it.  I got a recipe for garam masala off the internet:  1/2 tsp. cumin, 1/2 tsp. paprika, 1/4 tsp. cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. cayene powder, 1/8 tsp. ground cloves.  Everyone liked it and I will use the suggested amount next time.

I cooked this for my dad, my grandma, and me.  I used 98% lean ground beef.  I cooked them on a grill after the coals had sat for 25/30 minutes.  I ended up cooking them probably 10 minutes on each side (which might be normal, I don't know).  They did drip some onto the coals, but not too much.  I didn't have garlic or ginger paste so I substituted plain ground ginger and garlic, though I reduced the amount of ginger by almost half.  I also didn't have dry cilantro, so I used ground coriander.  Everyone liked it, though there wasn't enough (I wasn't filled after 1 and my dad had 2, which is normal).  Everyone was pleased, though they didn't rave.  I'll definitely take with recipe with me to college.

I love lamb burgers. May I suggest a light coat of olive oil on both sides of the burger before grilling. Adds that extra flavor.

I had ground turkey that I wanted to make burgers with, but just not run-of-the-mill, so I wondered about using garam masala, and up popped this recipe during my search.  Low and behold, it works GREAT with ground turkey!  Use 1 egg...not just the tablespoon it calls for.  I also added some bread crumbs, as turkey has a WAY different consistency than lamb and it needed it.  Also added a bit of salt.  Thanks for such a great recipe!

These were great!  I used 1/2 an egg, and that was plenty--it wasn't too moist or dry.  I used 1/2 tsp ground ginger, 2 cloves minced garlic, and 1 1/2 tsp garam masala.  We were out of cilantro, but I didn't really miss it.  It made three burgers.  They were flavorful but not spicy, which my two-year-old appreciated.  Will definitely make again!

I followed the recipe exact except I took everyones advice and did one whole egg.  I think it was too much egg.  It was very wet, and hard to form into a patty.  I was worried it would fall apart on the grill and fall into it.  I formed patties the best I could and put them inbetween wax paper.  I put them in the freezer for a couple hours so I had a better chance they wouldn't fall apart.  This worked.  I wouldn't say this was the best burgers ever.  It was good, but different.  I thought it was sweet, but had a good burger texture.  I would much rather prefer a swiss and mushroom burger or a bacon cheddar burger over this.  It was worth trying, but I wouldn't be adding it to my family dinner routine.  It was good don't get me wrong, just not my style.

This is a really good use of ground lamb and spices that you may not eat regularly. I used this meat combination with rice and tomato sauce in a stuffed pepper application and it was delicious, I may play with the cheese choices (I only had swiss, and it wasn't what I was looking for)

I will always use this recipe in future. I made it exactly, but my dried cilantro was not very new.  I did have fresh cilantro on hand, so used the leaves as the "lettuce".  I also put slices of feta cheese on top to melt while they were still hot.  BIG hit.  

Also think that fresh grated ginger and fresh pressed garlic would enhance the recipe.  thank you!
