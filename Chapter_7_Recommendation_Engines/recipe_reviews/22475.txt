This is the only recipe I use.  Used it for 30 years, Mom used it before that!  That marshmallow stuff is just chocolate candy - this is real fudge.  Hints to newcomers: Only stir until it comes to a rolling boil.  Make sure you do the "soft ball" test with cold water - change the water each time.  Drop butter and vanilla in, do not stir until pot is lukewarm to touch.  The grainy texture some talked about comes from either stirring butter in too soon or not beating enough. I make it thin because my family likes the "crusty" outside. Just use a larger pan to pour it out in. If you stop boiling too soon, you will get the chewy candy one lady writes about. If you cook too long, it will harden in the pot before you can get it beaten and poured. (I have saved this and used it as an ice-cream sprinkle - mmmm!) Don't make it in a rush - and I don't have as good results if the weather is rainy. Once I even took some that hardened too quickly, let it melt slowly in a double boiler and re-poured. Came out okay, but didn't have that pretty sheen.

This recipe truly does bring me back! My mother would make this for us kids....when we were  good that is!  I know that some people have a difficult time getting it to set, but it is really not that hard if you do 2 things.  Firstly, do the soft ball test by dropping a half teaspoon of the the mixture into cold water.  If you can form a ball in the water with your fingers its time to remove the fudge mixture from the heat and add the butter and vanilla. Just drop it in.  Do not stir until the mixture drops to 110 degrees Fahrenheit.  I hope those of you who maybe tried this recipe and failed the first time will give it a go again.  It really does produce some of the best tasting fudge out there!

Oh So Yummy!  Wasn't hard and doesn't take a pro to make this.  Just follow the directions and you'll be fine.  Mello 57 who rated this low said hers didn't come out..well she stirred and stirred.  I strongly suggest she reread the directions...especially the part where it says DO NOT STIR!!!!!!!!  Good luck to the rest of you.

GREAT RECIPE!!!!!!!!!!!! This fudge is excellent!
It came out perfect the first time I made it. I'll be sure to make this many times, everyone loved it. After the fudge cooled, I made a mint cream topping and it tasted even better.
Well good luck and I hope you like this recipe as much as I do!

I had never made fudge before and it seemed very scary, but it turned out excellent! It was very easy and didn't take long at all. I didn't even buy the candy thermometer. I just used the cold water technique. Don't let this recipe scare you. I am no chef and loved it and so did my crash test dummies!!

Old family favorite that never lasts long. For those of you who can't get it to set..you must follow the directions to a "T". I always use a candy thermometer, and make sure when you remove it from the heat to cool before beating it to quickly wash your thermometer off, then put it back in the candy.

This is a practice makes perfect recipe, but well worth the effort.

Melt in your mouth fudge!!!  I would not recommend a begining fudge maker try this recipe for a crowd until they make it a few times.  It is sensitive but if you follow the directions exactly it produces the BEST fudge I have ever had the pleasure of eating!

This is the recipe that was once printed on the Hershey cocoa tin. It is the best tasting chocolate fudge I have had.  I also prefer the texture of this to those ubiquitous, ultra_creamy recipes that some prefer.  I once made a mistake
with this recipe and ended up with something similar in texture to a very hard chewy caramel. The unique taste was still there so I cut it up and wrapped the individual pieces in wax paper. It was a hit.  I wish I knew how to reproduce it.

This is the first time I have ever had this type of fudge turn out great! This is the real stuff, and would recommend that only experienced cooks make this. The marshmallow stuff just does not compare. Directions have to be followed to a T.

A Note to Melo 57...perhaps your thermometer is not accurate. Give it one more try but with the soft ball/cold water method. It is really great fudge.) 

I love this recepie! My mother taught me to make this fudge when I was a little girl. We always added a huge heaping table spoon of peanutbutter stirred in with the butter at the end. Yummm! I have read a few of the reviews from folks who were not successful with this fudge. You need to understand that it is VERY moisture sensative until it is finished. A droplet of water or even a humid or rainy day may cause it to come out gritty and not harden. (as kids, we would always eat it anyway. just with a spoon.)It simply is not a rainy day project. Also, a little corn syrup will make it easier.

I have tried this recipe twice and both times ended up with fudge resembling a sandy hockey puck.  Initially, it boils high almost to the top of the pot then drops as it reaches 234F.  No problems with stirring in the butter or transferring to a pan.  Am I boiling to hard, it takes forever to reach 234F?  I was hoping to make this as a favor for our wedding.  O, well - maybe third time is a charm.

This gets 5 starts because it turned out great, even after I messed up.  I started out with a 3 qt pot, which turned out to be way too small once the boiling started.  After pulling the pot off the fire several times to avoid boil-over, I ended up pouring it all into a 6 qt (the only other size I had) and reheating it to the boiling stage.  My thermometer never went past 215F but I stopped cooking at the soft ball stage and it turned out fine.  

  I had no idea what the fudge's "gloss" was supposed to look like, but I just beat for a couple of minutes once it seemed lukewarm (I'd ditched the thermometer by then) and poured it out.  It looked awfully runny, but it set up beautifully and tastes fantastic - it's got a slightly sandy texture that just melts on the tongue.  I'm definitely a fudge convert!

This was my first atempt at making fudge, I too, had a mother who would made this old fashion kind about 3 times until it turned out right, I remember alot of fudge syrup in the freezer ;) anyways it turned out WONDERFUL. I read all the reviews and the tips were such help. I am guilty of making it with skim milk and toll house cocoa though :I lol, but I must say it turned out just fine, Listen to other people when they say DO NOT STIR!!! 
I had my temp. turned to about medium low the whole time, just so it was a rolling boil, not to hight and not to low, I also didn't use a thermo but the Ice cold water worked great. and check it here and there, it only took maybe 30 mins at the most so do make sure you check it. it did take a while for it to cool down but that wasn't a problem. Also it was a very humid rainy day and it still set just fine. practice does make perfect.

when they say RICH they mean RICH :)

What a disaster!!! Stirring & stirring, waiting & waiting for it to come to a boil. Then waiting & waiting for it to reach 234. Then more & more waiting for it to come back down to 110. Once it did, I could barely get a spoon through it to try to incorporate the butter. Poured it in the pan anyway & by morning it was rock hard. I worked on this from 9:30pm until 11:30pm. I followed directions to a "T". (using a candy thermometer.) I was looking for a fudge recipe using cocoa instead of choc chips & not using marshmallow. THIS AIN"T IT!!!  NEW ADDITION Feb. 9, 2010 I tried this again & finally had success. Here's what I did: I used a 4 qt. stainless steel pan & buttered it- bottom & sides. I mixed the sugar, salt, & cocoa in a bowl with a whisk, then added milk & mixed well. Then I poured this into the pan. Brought to a boil at 6 1/2, then reduced heat to a 5. (it still kept boiling) It should be a medium boil. Set your timer for 15 min. After that, stick a digital thermometer in the mixture & wait till it gets to 234. (just hold it) (mine took an additional 2 1/2 min) Put pan on a rack, add butter & vanilla, & only let cool until butter melts! Beat w/ mixer & pour in pan. Changes from "hot fudge" to setting up! Don't forget to butter your square pan. I used a mixer since it is so hard to stir. Whatever you do, DON'T let it cool longer than 10 minutes! Forget about the 110 degrees. Whole process took about 45 min. Hope this helps! (Oh, & Josie honey- you DO stir. See step 2)

As far as I'm concerned, this is the best fudge recipe.  My mother always used this recipe when she made fudge for us kids.  It's very rich and chocolaty, not like all those marshmallowy types.  It can be a little tricky, but it's well worth the effort.  Like my mother, I've always relied on the cold water test just in case the thermometer is off.  The proper temperature is crucial to the success of this fudge.

Why oh why does fudge hate me so!  I found this to be extremely hard and grainy.  I do not reccomend it, stick to old fashioned style fudge.  This wasted a lot of ingredients.  The taste however was ok, but I was too embarassed to get anyone else's but my little sister's opinion.

I believe this is a hit or miss recipe and I always miss.  I could not have followed the directions more closely.  It is always gritty and if it does set (which it did not) it is hard as a rock.  The flavor is fantastic!  Too bad it is a very difficult recipe to get right.

My Mom made this recipe for years, then passed it on down to me...You do need to follow directions exactly as written for it to turn out right.  This is an "Old Fashioned" type of fudge, not a creamy smooth type, but I love it just the way it turns out.  The most time consuming part is waiting for it to boil to the correct stage, and this takes around 40 -50 mins or so, and, I have made it in humid weather and it has turned out just fine, in fact I never recall that being an issue at all...This fudge is well worth the effort if you have the time to make it!

This is one of those recipes that must be followed to the "T".  It is the most delicious fudge ever once you get it right, but is so difficult to get it precise if you aren't used to doing it.  Once you get it right, though, it's a worth the effort "A+" rating treat!

I wish this could have a better than 5 star rating, just for the taste and texture. It takes a little more time to make but it beats the smooth creamy fudges for the wonderful rich chocolate taste. It has a gritty texture like brown sugar, my favorite! Compare it to the texture of a See's Candy Butterscotch square.

Unfortunately, I didn't heed others' warning about this recipe being moisture sensitive (I cooked it on a VERY humid day)... and I don't think I let it boil long enough (no candy thermometer on hand) because the fudge didn't set.  BUT even with my screw ups it still tasted absolutely wonderful!!!  I used it for hot fudge sundaes.  YUM!!!  And I even ate it by itself in a bowl... which DH thought was gross ;). Next time I make this, I'll make sure to do it on a not-so-humid day and to have a thermometer on hand!

My husband insisted I make this fudge as his mother used to make it. So I gave it a whirl today, but read the reviews first. Feast or famine. Decided to hedge my bet and added some shaved wax - about 1/4 cup when I added the butter and let it sit. Then after I stirred it with the wooden spoon for a while, I added some chopped pecans. It firmed up beautifully and it was a super huge hit. And yes - it'a a pain and takes forever to get to 234 (about 30 minutes at medium high heat) but worth the effort. Bon Appetite!

Great recipe.  I made it as written and it worked perfectly for me.  I wasn't really sure when the fudge had begun to "lose some of its gloss" -- I beat it for about 5 minutes and was afraid that was too much (it was all gooey and caramel-y at that stage), but it set just fine.  I'd recommend trying some of the variations -- pecans or maybe raspberry jam -- to spice things up a bit.

Oh, and one question: I had a little trouble with air bubbles in the fudge after I beat it and spread in the pan.  Anyone have tips to avoid this?

I didn't like this recipe at all.  If you are expecting traditional fudge, this is not it.  It's more like almond bark.  It's not fluffy and sweet.

This is the best fudge you will ever eat!!! My dad makes it for us every year.  You have to follow the directions exactly but once you get it right you will have the hang of it. My dad does his in the microwave in a very large, deep crock bowl.  He sets the timer for 20 minutes to cook.  After that he follows the original directions for adding butter.  His is perfect every time.  I would not recommend this for inexperienced cooks but it works great for him.  Try this recipe, if it doesnt come out right the first time, it is worth trying again. The taste is wonderful!

My dad always made this when I was a kid.  I recently tried to make it myself.  I didn't use a big enough pan so it boiled over and made a huge mess.  I am looking forward to trying it again.  I just remember how much I loved this fudge.  It will be worth the time and effort it takes to get it right.

AKA: Granma Mary Lou's Fudge. My mom made this fudge as did her mother and who knows how long it goes back. in the family I remember trying a different homemade soft gooey fudge for the first time and being dissapointed they cooked it wrong BUT come to find out the fudge I grew up on was not the common fudge but this hershey chocolatey grainy fudge that I will always believe is real fudge for myself. I loved it when my granma or mom even overcooked this fudge because it crumbled into a thousand peices but still tasted great and my mom always cooled it too early which means we got spoonfuls of chocolate fudge glop. Anyways here's my tips for this fudge...looks like overall everyone's tips! Tips: 1. When it says DON’T STIR: 4 REALS DON’T STIR (until pot is lukewarm).          2. USE ONLY HERSHEYS COCOA          3. DON’T MAKE IT ON A RAINY OR HUMID DAY           4. SKIM MILK CAN'T BE USED          5. FOLLOW DIRECTIONS TO A "T".           6. IF U MESS IT UP,WHAT’S THE WORST CASE SCENARIO YOU                GET TO LICK UP THE LEFTOVERS IN A BOWL WITH A SPOON. Yumm!

My mother made this recipe for years and it almost always worked for her. She never used a candy thermometer. SKIM MILK CAN'T BE USED. I e-mailed Hershey's and they told me they recommend 2%. Mama used whole milk; there was no such thing as skim milk then. I've had a lot of trouble with this recipe (yet years ago I used to make it perfect every time) but I think my problem is I don't cook it long enough. It looks like it's the soft ball stage, but yet it doesn't set. Today, I recooked it, and it worked great! This is the BEST fudge!

This is the only fudge that I will eat or make; this is the recipe that my mother always used.  This is a more textured fudge, not a creamy fudge. So, if you like creamy fudges this isn't for you.  This is a delicate fudge and the recipe should be followed precisely.  If the weather is right then your fudge will be perfect.

I add peanut to taste to the recipe.  The majority of the people who eat my fudge love it. It is an awesome recipe.

Made this recipe it did not set. I live in florida but the humidity would not have had that big of an effect on how it set. I do have to say it makes a great fudge sauce for ice cream. At first I thought there may have been a misprint in the recipe and went to the original source. The recipe is ver-batim. I previously worked in a candy shop where I made fudge and other candies all the time. But the recipies were kept secret; only the owner knew the measurements. I mixed and cooked the ingredients. We used to make around 100 pounds at a time. I am searching for a smaller version of what we made and this recipe looked simular. However it made a gooey mess.(but tasted good)
I would recomend this as a topping for ice cream if you follow the recipe. However it is not an "old fashion fudge".

After the mixed reviews, I had to take the challenge and give it a try.  This turned out great.  I was a bit disappointed with the quantity, but the taste is exactly what I was looking for...old fashioned fudge! My thermometer never passed 215, so I relied on the cold water test and glad I did. Took about 15-20 minutes after rolling boil. Try it...you'll love it!!

Just like my grandmother used to make it. I got chocolate on my keyboard. Your kids will always remember fondly this chocolate treat. I know I did. Thanks grandma. (it is a must to have a candy thermometer)

Five stars for taste, of course, but only four because this recipe is so finicky.

If you look up some food science fudge pages you'll find that it is the chemistry of fudge that makes it rather tricky. 

Tips: Put the lid on briefly, to let the steam wash down and remaining sugar crystals. Not too long, or you'll boil it over! Also don't let any remaining intact sugar crystals from high up on your stirring spoon get into your finished product, or you may have the whole recipe turn grainy on you. Sugar "wants" to be sugar. Stirring fudge before cooling, is another way to make it start the chain reaction back to sugar.

You can also remelt the whole batch, if it turns back to sugar.

It's a tricky recipe, but just delicious, and worth the effort to me.

I never thought I could make fudge after watching my mom's weekly efforts turn to a soft-caramel-candy or rock-hard-candy sweet mess. I made fudge the first time with this recipe and there is one trick that worked for me...a digital thermometer. I picked one up for about $12 at Lechter's Housewares and use it religiously for everything from checking bread to roasting meat. Even me, with failed-fudge-making genes, got this to come out great!!! Good Luck!

This was my first venture with making fudge, and I had a lot of fun. I followed the directions to a "T", and my only problem was that it seemed to be more a gummy consistency on the outer edges, and harder in the middle. Maybe I didn't stir it long enough. Anyway, I brought it to a Christmas party, and everyone LOVED it! It's very rich, though, and one or two pieces is more than enough! :)

This is the recipe that I remember my mom making and love it.  So does my nieces and nephews when I make it.  If you are afraid of a little work don't try it.  And yes, you can't make it on a humid day.  This is the traditional cocoa fudge that was made before marshmellows were invented-I think using marshmellows are cheating.  Trust me kids love this as well as the adults!!

This recipe was absolutely delicious. I came upon it when I was searching for a recipe of fudge for Christmas presents. If you dont like fudge you might want to rethink that and try this recipe!!
