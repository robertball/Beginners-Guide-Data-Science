I had to cut back on the baking time, and only had almond extract (not vanilla) on hand, but otherwise followed the recipe. The family loved it. I will definitely make this again.

I combined ideas from the recipe on the inside of the chocolat bar with that of this one.   I made the truffle with the cream,  but increased the amounts so it made 8 cakes.  The egg amounts were different,  too.  I used the eggs as directed on the chocolate box.  They turned out great!  Both recipes are from Ghirardelli.

The cake and Flavors were absolutely delicious! The "Lava" didnt flow as much as expecting. But more so baked right into the cake, but the ooey gooey was delicious! overall great flavors! just not as much lava as hoping. maybe bigger balls of the inside would help.
