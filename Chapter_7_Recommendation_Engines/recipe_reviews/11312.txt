This is an awesome cookie recipe!  I admit I prefer it with my changes, but the basic recipe is really good.  I read other reviews that it was a "skimpy" recipe, so I doubled it and made it with THREE eggs, added slightly less than 1/2 teaspoon of salt and used salted butter.  The oatmeal I used was "Quick" and I also added one cup of dried cranberries to the doubled recipe.  You could also use 1 cup chopped dried cherries instead.  I used a medium size ice cream scoop to transfer the dough to the cookie sheet (I use a Silpat mat instead of a greased cookie sheet).  The cookie baked perfectly at exactly 12 minutes...It was wonderfully soft in the middle and just slightly crispy on the outside edges.  It had nice height to it, didn't spread out much and was a huge hit with everyone who tried it!

I have gotten fabulous rave reviews on these cookies.  The dough always seems a little dry, but just press it all together, throw them on the sheet, and they come out just terrific.  I have made them about 6 times since I printed off this recipe 18 months ago.  I am always asked for the recipe.  If at high altitude, use a tad bit more leavening, and bake 1-2 minutes longer.  I have also halved the dough after adding the nuts but before the chocolate, and made half with white choc, and half with semi sweet.

It's a shame that the rating system only goes up to five stars, because these cookies seem to deserve more! I listened to the other reviewers and used 2 eggs rather than one and added 1/4 cup of flour. The dough was still dry and stiff, but when the cookies were finished baking, they were moist and perfect. These are sure to become a tradition in my house!

these cookies are fanastic.the nicest macadamia nut cookie that I have ever eaten.I made the crunchy type n they were wonderful.
but there is one point to take note.use only chopped-up white choc n not white choc chips.
I reduced sugar to 1/4 white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar.And remember to chop macadamia nut into quarters if not you will have a hard time shaping your cookies.the dough is kinda dry so you have to shape them using ypur hands n pressing them slightly or your cookie will be like a ball. 
I like this recipe 'cos it is not too sweet n it uses really little butter[healthier choice]

I made this recipe for a cookie exchange and they turned out great. The time they're cooked is important, the less time I cooked them the more moist and chewy they were. Great recipe, Thanks!

I was searching for something a bit different, but not too difficult for a cookie exchange at work. These are great! Now a family favorite, and added to holiday baking! I made a couple changes others may want to try. I added one more egg and a little more flour; also instead of 1 c. white chips, I used 1/2c. each white and semi-sweet choc., and about 1/4 c. butterscotch. Everyone loved them!

Yummy!  These were tasty!  I made one change and used 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp almond extract.  Very tasty.  The dough is crumbly, but will stick together.  I used rounded teaspoonfuls and only got 40 cookies instead of the written yield (48).

Loved these cookies.  Since macadamia nuts are so spendy, I subbed chopped walnuts.  Not exact same results but close.  Very good and we ate these up.  Will be making these again!

My dough was too dry and crumbly to drop by teaspoonfuls.  I tried to squeeze into balls but didn't really work either.  I resorted to pressing the batter into a 9 x 13 pan instead and baking about 25 minutes.  The flavor was great nonetheless.  I may try adding the butter the prior reviewer did next time.

I didn't care for these.  I used chocolate chips instead of white chocolate so maybe that was it, the flavor just tasted off to me and they were not very sweet.  I have to say the texture was nice, I followed the recipe exact with the exception of the chips and I used butter flavored Crisco instead of butter, and they were large and a nice height, not flat.  Don't know that I would make these again, if I did I would add more brown sugar and try the white chocolate chunks.

These were the best cookies I have made in years! I doubled the recipe, used 3 eggs, substituted half of the flour for whole wheat flour, decreased the sugar to 3/4c. each, and substituted the butter with equal canola oil. Took out of the over right when edges were golden and let them sit a couple minutes. Very moist and chewy!

Followed the recipe exactly except used walnuts instead of macadamias. They are AMAZING and took hardly any time at all. Will be making them again and again :)

Excellent!  Like the previous reviewer, I doubled the recipe and added dried cranberries along with the white chocolate chips and macadamia nuts.  The dough gets very thick at the end when you're adding the oats, nuts, etc., so folding those in with your hands may be easier than trying to use a spoon.

The most important thing here is to NOT overbake!  My first batch came very dry and hard after 12 minutes with just so-so flavor.  After experimenting, I found 9 minutes was perfect.  When the edges are golden brown, and maybe a little on the top, they're done.

These cookies were a hit.  I took someone's advice and added another egg, a dash of salt and 1/8c. of flour.  I don't think I needed the extra flour and I wish I had added a little more salt.  I will definitely make these again.

Used semisweet chocolate instead of white - very good!! I have no idea how you would get 48 cookies out of the recipe - I got about 20 - much bigger than teaspoonfuls, mind you :-)

These cookies were good.  I added milk chocolate chips as well as the white chocolate chips.  However, one more egg is definitely needed and I believe a dash of salt needs to be added as well.  I doubled the batch and it was hard to work with because the dough was stiff, but once the cookies were baked they were very good.

I used some suggestions in the other reviews, doubling the recipe but not the chocolate or macadamia nuts. I also added one cup of craisins. Since some folks said they were dry, I added two teaspoons of water as well as I have another oatmeal cookie recipe that calls for that. These were scrumptious! thanks!

Based on other reviews I used 2 eggs instead of 1, plus I added another 1/4 cup of flour - with good result. 
However the dough needed salt. 
I had assumed that the macademia nuts used were to be unsalted. Wondering why this receipe left out so important an ingredient.

This is one of our favorite cookies.   You have to try it!  If you are not a fan of oatmeal, add less of it & add more flour.

I made this recipe because I brought macadamia nuts home from a recent trip to Hawaii.  I'm sorry that I wasted the precious nuts in this cookie.  I followed the recipe exactly.  The batter didn't hold together - it was just a crumbly mess.  I had to "mold" each cookie in my hands.  Next time I'll search for another way to use the macadamia nuts.

I added an egg and a little bit of flour and used white chocolate chips. I used a medium sized ice cream scoop to drop the batter onto the cookie sheets, this helped to produce round cookies, these really don't spread much. I baked them for 12 minutes and they turned out nice and soft inside. I loved the taste! I will definitely be making this again. Oh and I used salted whole macadamia nuts that I chopped into various sizes, but didn't leave any whole- this worked really well. I got exactly 22 cookies.

LOVE these! So easy to make.  Yeah, they are a little dry when you are folding in the good stuff but, once they bake the texture is just right.  I added dried cherries.  Flip out!! These cookies are the real deal!!

Sorry, I followed this recipe exactly. Turned out to be a very dry cookie. I am a veteran cookie baker, and I was disapointed. Sorry. The flavor wasnt bad, but I diddnt care for the texture.

These are very good cookies!!  I've had a cold for about a week now, and I could still taste these cookies regardless of the stuffy nose!  I used white chocolate chips instead of white chocolate chunks(what I had on hand).  I used 2 cups instead of 1, and that might not have been a good idea.  I did get some crumbly cookies out of this, but I think it was my fault for doubling up on the chocolate.  Also, didn't have madadamias on hand, so used chopped walnuts.  Very very yummy and will be made again and again.

These cookies had a nice flavor, but I didn't have much luck with the texture.  I baked them as directed and they came out great from the oven, however the next day they were so hard I couldn't bite them!  I'll try them again because the flavor was so good.

These cookies aren't quick but this is probably the most delicious cookie recipe I have ever made. They are so tender, they literally melt in your mouth. Everyone at work loved them. A co-worker asked if he could buy a batch from me. My son doesn't like oatmeal, but they were a hit with all the adults.

It passed the most rigid inspection from the cookie inspector (my husband). The consistency is perfect; slightly crunchy with a chewy center. I included cranberries and followed "Albertacf" suggestion of doubling the recipe, using 3 eggs and slightly less than 1/2 tsp of salt. At first the batter was decently moist, but I had to stop in the middle of baking to make dinner and I noticed when I came back to it about an hour later it was noticeably drier. Still like a lot of others stated, I just compressed the ball of dough and it stayed together. It truly is a great tasting cookie.  The recipe is definitely a keeper.

I doubled  the recipe but used white chocolate chips, otherwise followed the recipe precisely.
Like other reviews, the cookies turned out dry and, honestly, pretty flavorless. Maybe increasing butter, adding an egg or using all brown sugar might improve them. Sorry, this is a no repeater for me.

Not that crispy.  The oatmeal ruined the texture for me.  I'll try other recipies without oatmeal next time.

This recipe is just perfect the way  is written, else why would it still be online?  I have had to stop reading recipe reviews because it seems like some people want another cookie altogether!

very dry.  I too had to mold the cookies in my hand and even that didn't hold them together.  Mixture was too crumbly.  I doubled recipe as I always do with cookies. If I try again it will be with less oats.  Flavor was outstanding

I've tried this recipe as written and I've made changes to it and it's great every time! It's a really hearty cookie and the guys in the house always love them.  They are adaptable to change easily too, so can make substitutes easily if you want. 
1)I almost always add an extra egg. 
2)I like to use semi sweet chips instead of white chocolate, and I double the chips. Don't double the white chocolate, it will  make them too sweet.
3)I've tried to make it healthier with whole wheat flour and agave in place of the white sugar. This makes the texture different, but still an awesome cookie.

First I would like to thank the reviewer who wrote that she successfully replaced the butter with oil.  That worked great.   The cookies turned out wonderfully and looked so beautiful, but I am giving the recipe four stars because of how labor-intensive it was working with the crumbly dough and the fact that cutting down on the ridiculous amount of white chocolate chips would've help make it so much easier to work with the dough and would have allowed the taste of those expensive and delicious macademia nuts to come through.  I love chocolate.  Cutting down on the amount used in a recipe does not come easy to me, but here it overloaded the dough so it could not hold together and completely overtook the nuts so that I could barely taste them.

To sum it up:  1) Feel free to use oil instead of butter and, more importantly, 2) cut down on the white chocolate so that the dough will be enough to hold the chips and nuts without so much wasted effort.
