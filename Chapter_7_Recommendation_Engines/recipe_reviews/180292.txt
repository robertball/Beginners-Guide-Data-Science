THESE WERE EXCELLENT!!!!!  My husband, who is not even a chocolate fan, devoured these.  I prepared the boxed cake per the directions, but instead of 1/2 cup oil, i did 1 tablespoon and added 1/2 cup applesauce (SO MOIST!).  I also added about a 1/2 cup strong coffee to my cake mix batter to enhance the chocolate flavor, or kahlua would be good i bet as well. Then when the cupcakes were finished, i made my own whipped cream and sprinkled tiny semi-sweet choc chips on top along with the cherry pie filling.  Seriously, BETTER than bakery cupcakes!  To die for when they are COLD and have settled in the fridge over night.  Watch people's faces when they try these! I am also going to try a spice cake mix with the cream cheese filling and apple pie filling drizzled with caramel sauce!  YUMMM!

Oh-so-yummy and impressive looking!  I agree it's important to get your proportions right on these.  I found that 1 1/2 tablespoons cake batter, followed by 1 1/2 teaspoons each of the cream cheese mix and cherry pie filling gave me the best size cupcakes.  I got rave reviews on these - thank you!

These were great! I used the low fat choc. cake mix recipe and nofat cream cheese and whip topping and no sugar cherry pie filling. You couldn't tell these were low sugar and fat! They were wonderful and a huge hit!

Followed the direction to the T; one suggestion though, let it sit in the refrigerator overnight after baking- the coldness makes the cupcakes even more moist than it already is...was a great hit at the office holiday party...

I have made these twice and had good reviews at work and home. I followed most of the recipe but instead of using the the cool whip for icing I used premade cream cheese icing which i found stored nicely overnight. I also used an ice cream scoop to put the cake filling into the cupcake holders - worked like a charm. I filled it 3/4 of the way so the filling wasn't to far on the bottom to make it soft and wasn't to close to the top to make it pop off when you are trying to unwrap it to eat.  Thanks for the recipe, it sure has became one of my favorites

These are so yummy!  I found that putting 2 TBS of cake batter in initially is too much, I had some major overflow on the first batch.  I cut back a little and ended up with perfect cupcakes.  I didn't top with the coolwhip and cherries until they were ready to be eaten just to keep the whipped cream from getting that crusty stiffness.  These are so tasty and a nice change from a regular old fashioned cupcake.

These are absolutely delicious (and i dont even like cherries!) they are definitely better cold the next day, so try to make these ahead. here's what i did to get the perfect cupcake: *use devils food cake mix and add 1/4C strong coffee * spoon 1.5T of batter into the bottoms *spoon in 0.5T cream cheese mixture and spread it out into a flat circle with your fingers as best as possible *spoon in 1-2 cherries making sure they are directly on top of the creamcheese *cover with 1T or so of cake mix ... by taking these measures, i ended up with cupcakes exactly like in the picture, and they weren't too messy to eat. i had a 21oz can of cherry pie filling and it was more than enough to fill and have enough to put on top of 27 cupcakes. i used store-bought whipped white frosting (didnt have time to make my own, but i want to try with 'sturdy whipped cream frosting' from this site next time) i topped w/ 1 cherry and some mini choc. chips... PERFECTION!

I thought these were great!! They are a bit timely to make but it is soooo worth it. I think you have to just be smart about your batter to cream cheese to cherry ratio in the cupcake so it doesn't overflow... I didn't have any overflow and mine ended up making about 30 cupcakes.  I used a large cookie scoop to transfer the cake batter and it worked really well without making a giant mess. Also I made a cool whip/cream cheese mixture and used it for both the inside and for on top. I agree with the reviewer that said you probably need 2 cans of pie filling because I basically ran out towards the end... Oh & I used the low-fat cake recipes & reduced fat cream cheese & cool whip- you would never know!! Will definitely make again!!

I hate to be negative, but I really didn't like this recipe.  I found that the cream cheese flavor was too complicated and distracted from the usual cherry/chocolate/whip cream joy of a traditional blackforest cake.  Also, my cream cheese/cherry filling sank to the bottom of my cupcakes and became a sloppy mess at the bottom.  I also didn't like the frosting...it was dense and had an overpowering cream cheese flavor.  I actually like (love?) cream cheese, but I felt that it didn't work well with the other flavors in this recipe.

These are the best cupcakes you will ever taste! I made these with Duncan Hines Super Moist Devil's Food Cake Mix.  I put 2 tablespoons of cake batter in each cupcake followed by about 1 tablespoon of the cream cheese mixture and 1 tablespoon of the cherry pie filling (about 3 cherries per cupcake). I  then topped each cupcake with 1 tablespoon of the batter and had just enough to do this.  I used the Sturdy Whipped Cream Frosting from this site to top each cupcake.  It is the absolute perfect frosting for these cupcakes since it is not too sweet. Everyone raved about these cupcakes!  So moist and so delicious.

I had originally rated this a 4*, but have been having so much fun trying different combinations, I simply had to upgrade to a 5*.  Most recent was a lemon cake, with lemon pie filling - probably one of our favorites, now.  Definately let these chill as they're so much better once they've had a chance to sit.  We've done white cake with blueberry, chocolate with the cherry, lemon with lemon pie, and I think next will be spice with apple pie.  Experiment and enjoy!

Made these for bible study one evening.  I think I would buy 2 cans of cherry pie filling, just so that I had enough to put inside & on top of the cupcakes next time.  I felt like the cake was a little dry, but that might have been because I used German Chocolate cake mix.  I would make these again.

These are yummy, but a bit tricky to make correctly. It's difficult to get the right ratio of cake batter, cream cheese mixture, and cherries without making the cupcakes too large. These were a bit messy to eat, but I would definitely make them again. They are tasty!

these were very good and i'm not even a chocolate cake fan!  I agree that proportions are key here.  I did 1 1/2 TBS batter, ~1 TBS filling and 3 cherries for the bottoms and then put the remaining batter evenly on top.   I made my own cake batter and did half of these with a red velvet batter and half with the dark chocolate cake from this site. I ended up having extra batter for both but that might be due to my batter proportions.  For the frosting i made a cream cheese frosting and used the syrup from the filling (I used all the cherries).  they are a little time consuming but i think well worth it!

great idea for stuffed cupcakes!  these are deceptively easy to make, and look really great when you're done.  i very much enjoyed the cream cheese filling, which was a different twist on black forest, but a nice touch.  the reviewer whose proportions were 2T batter, 1T cream cheese, and 1T cherry pie filling was spot on.  this made full cupcakes that weren't overflowing, didn't leak, and had enough filling to be super tasty.  great recipe!

These are delicious, and a huge hit everywhere I take them.   I use a cream cheese icing instead of Cool Whip to give it a more "Black Forest Cheesecake" feel.  Wonderful!

These were delicious! I used a can of choclate frosting on top, due to that was what in the cupboard and no time to make frosting. Next time I will fill muffin cups 2/3 full and put the filling ingredients on top and let them bake without adding second layer of cake mix. The cake mix bakes up around the filling and I think that will help solve the runny bottom issue. If any filling is showing on top it can just be covered with frosting!

Followed the directions exactly.  Very easy recipe.    I used Betty Crocker Devil's Food cake mix. 
 When I checked to see if these were finished,  the bottom (through the cupcake liner) seemed still runny.  Not the case.  The cupcakes were cooked through and the cherry filling was warm giving it the gooey feel.  Next time I will definitely use 2 cans of cherry filling because there wasn't much left over to add to the finished cupcakes.  This is a keeper for my family.

I am a beginner at baking and was shocked that these cupcakes actually turned out perfectly! After reading other reviews I was worried that the filling would burst out while baking or that the bottoms would fall out when unwrapped. I followed the recipe exactly except I topped my cupcakes with maraschino cherries instead of the leftover pie filling.

Absolutely delicious.  Gave 4 instead of 5 stars because if the recipe is followed, the cupcakes are too big for a normal cupcake tin.

These were really easy and the result was pretty impressive.  I even thought I had goofed when my muffin cups seemed too full but everything baked up nicely and nothing oozed out.  I topped mine with some leftover fudge icing I had from making a cake earlier in the week and my kids loved them.

I followed the recipe exactly and these were amazing!  I highly recommend them!  Make sure they are cool before eating them though because the filling takes a long time to cool down and it is very easy to scald your mouth on these.

DELICIOUS!!!! I made these for a Stella and Dot party; of course we had to sample them before hand... then, I was worried that I wouldn't be able to get any out of the house! The cupcakes were a huge hit and are a new favorite of ours!! =)

I loved these, although i use a regular cream cheese frosting or chocolate frosting..i also made these with lemon cupcakes and lemon pie filling instead. then i mix a 8oz of cool whip w/a tub of lemon icing and frost them. everyone loves it..sometimes i then top with yellow sugar sprinkles. it gets rave reviews everytime i make it as cupcakes or cake

AMAZING!!! i couldnt stop eating them and some of my taste testers ate them shortly after they were baked so the filling was still warm. i didnt make 24 cupcakes, i made 18 really big ones, i used german chocolate cake and prepared it like the normal directions stated. also instead of the cool whiop topping i used milk chocolate frosting. they were a hit . they were extremely moist and and i actually ate them with a fork. they  were easy to make, although a bit time consuming but def. worth it. the only problem i had was the pie filling that i had gotten had a few cherry pits = /

OH MY GOODNESS!! These are soooo good!!  I mixed the cake as stated on the box. (I didn't use a low fat version) I put one tablespoon of mix on the bottom, spoonful of cream cheese mix, about two cherries worth, and then another tablespoon of cake mix on top. I baked them for 21 mins. and they turned out perfect.   I don't care for whipped cream, so I used chocolate and vanilla frosting on mine. The ones with chocolate frosting are to die for!!! I will make these over and over again!!

Yummy! The reviews are correct in stating that it is hard to get the proportions right - mine turned out really large. My kids LOVED the cherry suprise in the middle. I agree with another revewier that they are even better cold the next day. I also couldn't taste the cream cheese very much, next time I think I may even omit it completely, or substitute it for another kind of filling. Will definitely make these again!

Very yummy and pretty easy to make. I loved the tip from a fellow reviewer to use 1/2 cup of apple sauce and only 1 tbsp. of oil in the cake batter instead of 1/2 cup of oil. Came out moist and delicious. I will do that every time now. Doesn't influence the taste and love the reduced cals. This cupcake was a big hit. Everyone loved the surprise on the inside. Thanks a lot!!!

These cupcakes are the best cupcakes...EVER!  I've made them a few times now.  My husband said that he thinks it's the best cupcake he's ever had!  Everyone always LOVES them.  Now...for the tips:  I've used canned cherry pie filling (putting 3 inside each, then topping with 3) buy 2 cans of the pie filling if you go this route.  I'm about to make them again though, and I'm using Cracker Barrel's cherry cobbler filling instead.  It tastes SO much better than canned store brands.  Also, I read the reviews of others before making them and found that using 2 tbsp of batter for the bottom, then the cream cheese layer per the recipe and then 3 cherries, then topping with batter works perfectly.  Also, for the cream cheese filling, I found that doubling the sugar made it taste a little better, otherwise it just tastes like straight up cream cheese.  Oh, and I use store bought cream cheese frosting for the top...NOT Cool Whip and NOT Duncan Hines brand (it's too runny), Betty Crocker is actually my favorite, so far.  Oh, and the best cake mix is Duncan Hines Devil's Food chocolate cake mix (substituting apple sauce for the oil).  Anyway, these are SO worth the time and effort!

These are pretty darn good. I'm not a 'Big' fan of cherry pie filling and I used the cream cheese and put 1 maraschino cherry in each..almost gave it a coridal feel. Topped with homemade whipped cream.

I made these for a bake sale and was initially a bit worried, I couldn't find cherry pie filling (Aussie supermarkets don't have it as far as I'm aware) so I used a jar of morello cherries instead and just plonked four in per cupcake. Still unbelievably amazing!! I think these will be a hit!

Wonderful recipe. I love it as is. I put the toppings on just before I serve them. At times I don't put the whip topping on just because it may be too sweet other then that it is a delicious choice.

While these had great taste and interesting texture, I found that they didn't hold up very well. I'd error on the side of making them smaller so they are easier to eat.

I hate to be the only one saying this, but I didn't feel these cupcakes were worth the effort. You have to make sure you get the portions of the different layers correct otherwise when you take the cupcakes out of the pan, they just fall apart. The cream cheese center really didn't taste like anything. The only saving grace was the whipped cream cheese frosting that I used. Wouldn't make this again. Not worth the effort.

These had a great flavor..might suggest using the biggest cupcake pan you can find...just didn't seem like I could fit everything it called for...as well much better if you use cool whip and not whip cream...otherwise very good.

These were tasty muffins. I followed the recipe but be sure to spray your muffin pans well or use the liners as indicated also make sure you add enough batter before the cherries or your cherries and cream cheese will leak out the bottom.

These are YUMMY.... I used big cupcake wrappers. 2 tablesppons of batter on the bottom, used a cookie scoop for the cream cheese and a tsp of the cherries, then topped with 2 more tablespoons of batter. I frosted them with "Rick's Special Buttercream" frosting. (IF you haven't made that yet, look it up on here! The perfect frosting!!) The only thing that went wrong with my cupcakes is that the cherries sank to the bottom of the batter while cooking so when you took the wrapper off, you had kind of a mess. Ok though, since I made mine bigger, it was ok to eat it on a plate with a fork. Will so make these again!

Wonderful taste! The only reason I give it 4 stars vs 5 is that in order to get enough cherry filling in the middle the cake on the bottom comes out way too thin. Also, I am thinking the cream cheese layer in the middle was incorporated to prevent the cherry filling from ending up completely on the bottom, kind of like a barrier so the cherries don't break through the bottom? Because the flavor of the cream cheese is not there at all, it is totally lost in the chocolate and cherry flavors. Otherwise this is a very tasty cupcake. It can be messy eating though! ;)

People seemed to really these. I combined the cream cheese filling with the cherries. I also used a cream cheese butter cream frosting instead and added some of the pie sauce to add some color to it.

These are the most deliciousness cupcakes ever.  A little time consuming but very inexpensive and everybody will love them.  Perfect for a party or an event you have to bake for.  The only change I made was to put 1/4 cup of sugar in the cream cheese mix.  It took the strong cream cheese taste down and made it just more of a cream.

These came out ok, not very sweet, and I really couldn't taste the cream cheese filling. My cupcakes looked just like the first picture, I put 1& 1/2 TBS cake mix and a large tsp of each filling. Next time I may try to add more of the cream cheese filling, but a tsp of the cherries (about two cherries) seemed to be more then enough. A nice recipe, and kids will like the cherry surprise.

Was a big hit when I made this for friends. Pretty easy to do and tasted great. I do recommend that you have napkins available though. The filling can surprise people.

I tried to make mini-cupcakes.   The "cheesecake" mixture didn't taste like cheesecake. I added some sugar and it hardly tasted better.  And the cupcakes just tastes like box mix chocolate cake.   They fell apart when I attempted to take them out. NEVER MAKE THIS RECIPE IN A MINI-CUPCAKE PAN.

These wonderful cupcakes and hoho-filled vanilla cupcakes were made for a baby shower. People raved about them--not so much about my go-to favorite hoho cupcakes. They were picture perfect. I followed other reviews--1 tbl cake batter, 1 tsp cream cheese mix, 1 tsp cherries, ending with 1 tbl cake batter. Because I needed to travel, I couldn't use whipped cream. I used buttercream icing shaped in a ring. Then a cherry with a little bit of cherry 'sauce' tucked into the ring--super cute! The recipe made 24 perfect cupcakes.
Thanks!!

Instead of cupcakes, I made this as a filled Bundt cake. I did decrease the temperature by 25* and extended the baking time by 12 minutes. It came out perfectly.  I would make it again.  Not too sweet with just a dollop of whipped cream!

The only change I made was to use frosting instead of whipped topping.  Personal preference.  Great cupcakes. Worth the extra steps.

At the end of a day, it still tasted like a cake mix.  I might use the idea, but it will be with a homemade cake.

What a fun recipe! I made jumbo cupcakes. The cups were fairly full and I got 14 out of the batter. I will make this again. Simple elegance. 
Note: I baked them for 24 minutes and they came out perfect.

I made these for my family and they loved them! I only made two changes. I changed the frosting only because I forgot the whipped cream. I made a rum cream cheese frosting and I added a 1/2 cup of dark roast coffee to the batter (which I read was awesome from another review).

I made these for my birthday and they were divine. Made everything as per the recipe except I used just plain whipped cream for the icing with the left over cherry sauce on top. So good.

I made these for valentine's day for our family, wanted a treat, but not the sugar.  OMG.. they are great. I followed the suggestion of making the light cake version, but also used a jar of pitted sour cherries thickened with tapioca and sweetened with splendia instead of the pie filling.  We didnt even bother putting any kind of cool whip on the top, as they were fantastic just as they were.
