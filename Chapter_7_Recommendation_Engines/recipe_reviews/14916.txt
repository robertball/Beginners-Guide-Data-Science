We've used a similar recipe in our family during the holidays for years.  Substituting some red peppers will add more color.  As mentioned, about 1 tsp seasoning salt is a must.  If you don't want to use nuts, but still want additional texture, try adding 1/2 to 1 cup grated cheddar cheese.

I have made this cheeseball twice.  It always gets great reviews by those who eat it.  I recommend NOT draining the heck out of the pineapple though.  It loses a lot of flavor that way.  It is a little wet/runny right after you make it, but after sitting in the fridge for a few hours or overnight it's just fine.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe if not done right, becomes a dip instead of a ball.  Drain the pineapple really well and also used CRUSHED pineapple like it calls for.  I accidentally got pineapple chunks, thought it would be ok, so I whipped with a mixer the cream cheese and pineapple together and it came out too wet, and then I just decided to use it as a dip, but adding all the ingredients, even the crushed pecans and people still loved it!

I have a very similar recipe that always gets rave reviews. With mine, you leave out the celery, use red instead of green bell pepper, and 2 or 3 chopped green onions instead of minced onion plus a tsp. or so of season salt. One way to make it thicker is to grind an additional cup of pecans (I use my blender) and stir that into the cheese ball before shaping.

This is the best cheeseball ever!  I always add a splash of Worstershire to give it a subtle sweet and salty flavor.  It's definitely addicting!

I really enjoyed this recipe. I did make one mistake which i believe was not draining the pineapple thoroughly. The mixture was very creamy. I could not form it into a ball until i stuck it in the refigerator for 4 hours. It never really set up they way it should have so i put it on a platter and formed it into a rectangle. I then covered it with the pecans. I'm anxious to make this again. I will drain the pineapple with a strainer:) For sure a keeper even if it never sets up right for me. The taste is wonderful:)

Wonderful cheeseball, was a hit at the pot luck. Definately let it sit for a while to allow the flavors to blend.

I got this recipe from my grandmother over 30 years ago, and I still make it.  Have tried many cheese balls over the years and this is still my favorite!  But what's with the picture?  It does not look like it's rolled in chopped pecans... Okay, new picture is better!  This is also very good on celery for the gluten-free folks!

Disappointing.  Flavor was bland, took me more like 25 to 35 minutes to prepare rather than 5  and I cut the recipe in half but the size ball I ended up with was much larger than a "tennis ball".

I add diced crisp bacon and it turns out so good.  I have been making this for Christmas for the last couple years and everyone loves it!  Some can't figure out what is in it and are suprised when I tell them that it is pineapple.

Delish!  Everyone who tried it loved it.  Too soft to make into a ball, but I just served it as a dip.

To my suprise this was pretty yummy. Even my husband enjoyed it and asked me to make another. However, I used 1/3 less fat cream chees and had a hard time forming it into a ball even with a little salt added. I did allow everything to drain including the veggie so maybe the less fat cream cheese was the problem just FYI for anyone else making this :) Will make again.

Had my doubts at first, but went with positive reviews, and so glad I did! This was a huge hit, and I only put it in a bowl, and let everyone scoop it out with crackers.

Yummy with a few small changes! Added more green pepper and more onion than called for. Also added 1/2 t. Worcestershire sauce and 1/2 cup pecans to the mixture. You may need to have a few more nuts on hand to roll the balls in as 1 cup didn't cover both balls.

This is a good Cheese ball recipe, but mine turned more into a dip.  I used a smaller can of crushed pineapple, I drained it, but added some of the juice to make it creamier.  I also used green onions in it instead of the minced onions.  I also added some salt and let it sit overnight and it turned out really well.  Will make this again!

Recipe makes two balls. Drain pineapple very well. Add a dash of seasoned salt. Use green onion instead of regular onion. Use red bell pepper instead of green bell pepper.

I have used this recipe for years but for Christmas I double the recipe and shape it into a Christmas tree (after the ball has been refrigerated). I add red and green chopped peppers and/or maraschino cherries to the 'branches'. I also get rave reviews !!!

This was so easy to make and everyone loved it and several people asked for the recipe. I think it was just fine as is written - I did add a bit of seasoning salt and just a pinch of cayenne to see what that would do. This is definitely a keeper!

This is similar to a family recipe of mine that I think has more flavor.  Try 2 8oz cream cheese, 1/4 cup finely chopped bell pepper, 8 1/2 oz crushed pineapple, 2 T. finely chopped green onion, 1 tsp seasoned salt, and chopped pecans.  (Drain pineapple & bell pepper really well).  Makes 2 balls.  Roll in rest of pecans.

Good cheese ball base. After tasting it made as directed I felt it really needed some tweaking so I did add some chopped ham, shredded cheddar cheese and seasoned salt. I used green onion in place of onion. The pineapple is a bit over powering, so I think next time I will cut the amount back a little. Great base though! Could add many other combination of ingredient add ins to this base to make a variety of wonderful cheese balls.

Easy to make and very yummy. My grandma used to make this for me at Christmas time. She died and no one had the recipe. I finally found it! THANK YOU!

Really make sure to drain the pineapple or it is very liquidy. Mine turned into a dip...not a ball. Still quite tasty though.

Everyone loves this..... make it for all the holidays.  I do use Red pepper instead of the green and do not use the celery..  I also put in about a 1/2 cup sharp cheese.

This has been our regular cheese ball for years.  It's kind of sweet and really yummy.  We use a little seasoned salt in it for flavor.  Do NOT try it with low fat cream cheese, unless you want it more like a dip.  It's too sticky and runny to form into a ball.  The full fat stuff works best.  Whole or sliced almonds on the outside are great, too.

We really liked this recipe.  I made sure to drain the pineapple very well as everyone suggested.  I also took it a step further and pat-dried the celery and green pepper with paper towels to soak up the extra juice.  I did the same with the pineapple after draining it as well.  Also, I wasn't going to use the second ball right away, so I waited to roll it in the nuts until I was closer to serving it.  This helped the nuts not go so soft.  Delicious recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

Been making a variation of this for years. Should be made in advance to blend flavors. Seasoned salt (1 tsp. min)must be added for flavor.  I add 1/3 cup walnuts to cream cheese mixture and use remaining walnuts to roll. I usually put crushed pineapple in a strainer and squeeze the liquid out before adding to cream cheese. I also do not add celery but use 1 cup chopped green pepper. Great spread.

I read a lot of the reviews before I made this and decided to follow the recipe as originally given.  However, I was disappointed in the flavor.  Finally it dawned on me that I bought the crushed pineapple packed in water instead of heavy syrup.  Important thing to look for next time....make sure it's crushed pineapple in heavy syrup.  So, I added about 2/3 cup of sugar to it and it was wonderful.

Very good.  Be sure to let it sit in the fridge a good while so that the flavors blend.  Following others' suggestions I added a dash of seasoning salt and a touch of worchestershire sauce.  It came out sweet and zesty!

We liked this recipe, but did add just a little garlic powder.  This is very good served with Wheat Thins or Triscuits.  I think next time I will half this recipe...we didn't need two cheese balls!  I did drain the pineapple well in a strainer, then on paper towel.  It turned out good, not soupy.

It needs a little more flavor.  Maybe some seasoning along with the veggies and pineapple would help.  Not worth the trouble for me. I don't have a food processor, therefore it took a long time for me to mince all the veggies.

I just made this and cannot wait to eat it after it has refrigerated overnight.  I am serving this for a Luau party and shaped it into a pineapple shape (laying on it's side). When I'm ready to serve, I'll add the pecans and cut the top of a pineapple off and put it onto the "top" of the cheeseball.

My Mom has been making this cheese ball for as long as I can remember and its always been a favorite of mine. Take the advise of the other readers though, this cheese ball really needs to be chilled for a time before eating it so that the flavors can blend...otherwise you will end up with a very bland recipe. Also, you must drain the pinapple fully or else it will be wet and gooey. Great Recipe.

Ummmmy!!!It turned out PERFECT. I drained the pineapples about for a half hour.  Then I squeezed the rest of the juice out through a paper towel(cheses cloth would have worked better but I did not have any). If the paper towel rips, just get more.  The ball was easy to form and was a big hit at my party.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is totally addictive. I added 1/2 tsp seasoned salt and a dash of low sodium soy sauce. We like to eat it w/ the new flip crackers (pretzel on one side and ritz on the other) WOW, is all there is to say!!!!!!! I do wanna say that you need to chop your pepper and celery really fine and the dry it w/ a paper towel. I also squeezed the heck out of the pineapple and also dabbed it w/ a paper towel. I was able to make balls....but barely!  It is now my favorite cheese ball recipe. mmmm

This is a GREAT recipe!  I, however, didn't drain my pineapple the first time I made it, and it turned out to be a REALLY big hit as a dip!  I just threw the chopped pecans in and mixed it all up!  Really YUMMY as a dip!!!

I have made this same cheese ball for years and always get rave reviews. It is also very adaptable. I left out the celery a few times and the peppers a few time when serving to those that don't care for them. It was still just as good. The 1/2-1 tsp. of salt is definitely a must. Make the day before if possible.

My recipe is also very similar.  More chopped onions (green) and no celery and use 2 cup plus 2 tsp drained juice with 8oz cr. cheese.  Same amt. of bell pepper.  Like the rolled in pecan and will try that along with some mince celery for crunch next time.  Definately better next day +.  Family sceptical about pineapple, peppers, and onions together but found it was addictive.  Best on Sociables or Ritz crax.  Can't wait to try new additions.

I have a similar recipe to this, but couldn't locate it this year...too many recipes:) So, I went searching, and came upon this recipe. I added 1 1/2t seasoned salt, 1/2 c shredded cheddar cheese and a dash of garlic powder. I also cut dried beef into small squares, and placed on the outside of the cheese ball(my recipe called for this). Makes an attractive cheese ball and oh so tasty!

Love this cheeseball!  I followed the directions exactly.  I think that you have to let the flavors meld overnight for best results--it might taste kind of bland if you don't.  Different and delish!

I had this at a party and loved it, but it did not turn out well for me.  I had not read the reviews before making it - so I would definetly add some salt, seasoning to kick it up a little.

I didn't bother making this into a ball. Just put it into a little dish & put the pecans on top. I skipped the celery. thought it needed something and added a little seasoning salt. Served it with Wheat Thins. Perfect! Thanks!

It was very tasty and easy to make.  We had it for Thanksgiving and there were no leftovers.  I don't have the patience to mold the ball, so I just served it as a spread with Ritz crackers.  My kids love it for snack!

This cheese ball is a must try!  BUT...make sure you add the 1 teaspoon of seasoning salt as Lynn suggests in her review.  That makes the big difference in the bland taste that some of the other reviewers commented on!  I love this recipe and have had it for years!!!

I added chopped pecans like another reviewer suggested to the cheese mixture to try to firm it up a little.  I formed the ball by lining a small bowl with plastic wrap, then putting the cheese mixture into the bowl.  I covered it and refrigerated it for a few hours.  Then, just pull the wrap off the top, invert the bowl, pull the rest of the wrap off, then press the chopped nuts in.  It was a lot softer than what I'm used to, but it kept it's shape okay and tasted great!

I gave this a 4 because in no way did mine come out as a ball - it did come out as a delicious cheese spread though! I used red bell pepper which added a little color and green onion. I also didn't completely drain the pineapple but without some juice there wasn't much pineapple flavor. This was a huge hit Thanksgiving day (I made it the night before) and an even bigger one the day after when it had sat for longer - my hubby and father-in-law devoured it! Give it a try, you'll really like it!

Always a hit, but I've noticed that when I share the recipe that the person doesn't seem to get enough of the moisture out of the pineapple, so it comes out a little thin. Still darned good, though!

Guests thought the pineapple was crab - lol, since we're vegetarians. Per other reviewers, I added grated sharp cheddar for texture and flavor, and minced jalapeno to give it a kick. Red bell pepper instead of green made it pretty. Had this at our Oscar Party and named it Cheesy Balls for Mickey Rourke in the Wrestler. Half the recipe made two rather large balls. :)

It was a little bland so I added a some spices. Another good idea we had was to use those flavored tricuits like the olive oil and garlic.

I used non fat cream cheese and the ball was indeed very soft but excellent for spreading.  I put the nuts on saran wrap and molded the nuts around the ball and refridgerated it.  I am from Canada but made this in the US.  The cream cheese in Canada is must thicker and I am sure that the recipe would have turned out a bit more solid there.  Got rave revies on the flavour and as it was it spread very well.

This was different, but good. I followed advice from other reviewers and made these changes. I added 1tsp of seasoning salt, 2 minced green onions (white part only), a dash or two of worsteshire(sp?) and drained my pineapple extremely well. I wanted something different and got it but even though recieved pretty well by everyone, I'm not sure I'd make it again.

This cheese ball is great and easy to make.  I added a little seasoned salt and Chili powder to give it a little more flavor.  Also, you have to drain the pinapple really well or else the cheese ball turns out soggy.  This is a great addition to a little get together.

I made a few minor changes to this recipe, I used walnuts instead of pecans and added 1 tsp season salt. It was really good, I brought some to work and my coworkers all liked it and my husband asked when i was going to make it again. Great recipe! Thanks!

however, usually turns into a dip rather than a ball because it's hard to drain all liquid from canned pineapple

Omg this is so good! Beware as it is addictive! lol I tasted it after I mixed it all together and was not impressed. I added a tsp of season salt and a few hours later after the flavors' married together it was awesome!! Good thing it makes 2, we ate 1 before even going to the dinner we were taking the other one to the next day! Also it's so much better the next day!

So yummy! I loved the flavoring, even though it seems a little odd. I added more minced onion the second time I made it. It also makes a LOT. I would definitely make a 1/2 batch next time.

This a great recipe.  It will be a big hit at any party.  My recipe is slightly different then this one. I put 3 cups shreaded cheese in the cheese ball.

I made the cheese ball recipe twice, the first time I thought it was good but needed a little more seasoning so I added seasoned salt the second time, it turned out great.

Was so happy to see this cheese ball recipe.  I made this exact cheese ball over 30 years ago (received from co-worker) several times, then misplaced recipe.  Will be making it over the holidays.  Thanks so much!

This is close to the recipe my mom used to make when I was growing up (I don't think she used celery).  I love it.  Husband not a big fan of crushed pineapple but I think after he tastes it on buttery crackers he'll enjoy!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This was pretty good but needs a little zip. Maybe I will try a little worcestershire or horseradish next time. It did form into a ball and looked great. The celery added a nice crunch. Hy hubby and daughter didn't care for it.

I would have rated this recipe a 5 star but found it a tad runny even though i put the crushed pineapple in a strainer.All who tried it at the potluck Appy hour loved it.Next time might add some kind of seasoning and mabe drain longer.Definitly try and store it in the fridge overnight makes a big difference in taste and moulding.

This is a terrific recipe -- one I've been making for years.  Mix the pecans in, and shape it like a snowman (lay flat on platter, and don't chill too long or the pecans get soggy) for a great winter party appetizer.  Use black olives for decorations.

It tasted WONDERFUL, but I would drain the pineapple a lot more next time.  I had to put it in the freezer to "chill" for an hour to make it into a ball.  Half the recipe also, the "tennis balls" were more like softballs!

Soooo good. Sweet but not too sweet. The recipe makes two good sized cheeseballs, and it wasn't hard. Make sure you strain the pineapple very well and be aware that the mess is going to be a bit wet when you roll it, but it firmed up very well for me in the fridge. Everyone really loved them and we have made them a couple of times. I don't change anything, it's perfect right as it is.

Was trying to match a co-worker's cheese ball. Added chopped carrot, 1 1/2 teaspoon Lawry's salt, a splash of Worcestershire, and only 1/2 cup celery. Added 3/4 the pineapple. Trick is to mash all the juice out and you can maintain the firmer ball shape. Next time will add all 20 oz. of pineapple.

Easy, quick, and a hit. Added 1/4 tsp salt, and 1/4 tsp garlic/onion powder, as well as extra chopped pecans to the mix itself. Drained pineapple with a regular colander, and had no problem with the consistency. I did let it set overnight in the fridge before rolling it, and coated with the nuts just prior to serving so they weren't soggy.

Came out a bit soft, as other reviewers have said.  Also, this recipe made 2 HUGE cheese balls.  I would half it in the future.  I added curry powder to mine and it was DELICIOUS.

Made this for Christmas Eve for the first time. My local grocery store ran out of green onions so I made it with vidalia onions. I also added the pecans to the mix because it was a little to soft for a ball. It was a big hit with my family. I will make it again. Thanks for the recipe

Followed the recipe exactly. The result was very bland. I softened the balls and remixed with seasoned salt and a pinch of garlic powder. It improved the taste immensely. Will make again but with the changes.

I've made this several times and it's one of my favorites.  It is a very flexible recipe.  For example, I used red bell pepper because it's what I had on hand.  The only thing I added was some season-all so it wasn't overly sweet.  My husband doesn't like it to sweet.  If you wanted, you could even add a little fresh jalapeno and it would still be fantastic.

Made this for pool party in Mexico.  I used canned pineapple and fresh. Next time will try just fresh. Added red pepper and three green onions plus seasoning salt recipe on this website.  I thought way too much onion but everyone loved it.   Added ground walnuts to dip and then sprinkled rest on top.  Did not make into ball, will try next time.  Made the night before for flavours to meld.

I made this as an appetizer for a New Year's Eve party, and it was very well received. 

Like other reviewers, I also experienced a looser textured mixture. However, I let it chill overnight before attempting to mold it.  The consistency improved greatly.

My strategy for molding the mixture was to divide it into portions and wrap each portion in plastic wrap.  Using the plastic wrap as a protective barrier, I then molded the mixture into balls and then coated them with toasted pecans.  

It was less messy than had I used my hands directly and achieved the desired presentation.

I have made this multiple times and always get requests for the recipe. We like things spicy around here so I always add a couple of tablespoons of minced pickled jalapeños without the seeds, as well as a couple of pinches of seasoned salt. I also find that using the white parts of green onions gives a less overpowering flavor than a traditional white onion. Mincing the celery and bell pepper gives for a more consistent flavor throughout. Definitely drain the pineapple well but save a little of the juice so that when you taste it you can add a little of it back if you think it lacks pineapple flavor. The mixture is pretty wet and sticky so I let it refrigerate for about 30 minutes before shaping it. Lastly, if you have the time to toast the pecan pieces before coating the cheeseball it will take the flavor over the top.

I love this cheese ball, the recipe I've used for years used the tablespoon of seasoned salt. I think this is an important ingredient. Also, didn't add celery, but I suppose it might add a little more "crunch". I would tell my co-workers not to bring me a birthday cake---just make me this cheese ball and put a candle on it! I drained the pineapple thoroughly, even put it between layers of paper towels and squeezed out the liquid. Otherwise I ended up with a cheese "flat".

Subbed 1/2 cup red bell pepper for celery. Added 1 tsp. seasoning salt. Left some juice in the crushed pineapple. Mixed, then let set overnight. Right before serving, added 1 small package sliced almonds. We couldn't get enough of this!! It doesn't form a ball because of the pineapple juice, so you eat it as a dip, but the bowl was licked clean! Delicious!! I'm making it again today!
