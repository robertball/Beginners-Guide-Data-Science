I thought this turned out very good.  I didn't use the cloves because I was out.     I did add about one tbs. of plum sauce.

We made this with the full amount of glaze for a 4 lb. Ham. We also studded the ham with whole cloves before baking. It was delicious with the cloves adding a wonderful complement to the sweetness of the glaze.

I made this glaze with a small pinch of ground clove. It was perfect, everyone ate, even my picky little one.

I've made this twice - no cloves.  Very good, not too sweet.

Yes, I would make it again.  I just mixed the apricot  and honey mustard together and smeared it on a slow cooked ham and put it under the broiler for 5 min.  Easy.
