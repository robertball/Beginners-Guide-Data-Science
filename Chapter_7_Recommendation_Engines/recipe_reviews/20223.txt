I was pleasantly surprised at the raspberry scent from this...it was predominant even over the vinegar odor. I used this in a raspberry chicken recipe (it worked very well) & can't wait to make my own raspberry vinaigrette, Not sure if I shouldn't have added a bit of sugar w/ the raspberry....only time will tell. By the way, be sure & pick a container that allows for easy removal of the raspberries. I put mine in the decorative container I planned on storing the vinegar in & because of the small spout, I had a hard time removing the raspberries (which is essential to keep mold from growing).  Next time I will make it in a mason jar, allow to set for 2 weeks, remove the raspberries & then pour the vinegar into a more decorative container.

My grocer discontinued carrying raspberry vinegar so I looked forward to great results with this recipe. Regretfully this recipe only captures the fragrance of raspberry vinegar. It lacks the full bodied flavor I grew accustomed to. The flavor is so light that it's nonexistent. 
Next time I'll try using red wine vinegar.
