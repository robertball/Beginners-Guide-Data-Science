Great and easy recipe. I would definitely make it again. I added garlic powder in addition to the suggested seasoning to the chicken in the beginning and roasted slices of garlic before adding the broth and some baby spinach  2 minutes after adding the mushrooms to make the sauce.

I used boneless/skinless chicken breasts. Because I don't own an oven-ready skillet, I modified recipe instructions to prepare this dish via stovetop method---and it still turned out fantastic.  I browned my chicken using the bacon fat grease before discarding all but a tablespoon of it, which lent a smoky flavor to the sauce, complimenting the mushrooms and fresh green onions.  Next time, I will be looking at thickening this marvelous sauce .  My way of making this dish may have removed the Keto diet benefits--but it sure was a tasty dish my family loved.

While the name says Keto, you would never have guessed how amazing this recipe was in the end.  Completely devoured by everyone in my house.

used some of the bacon grease when frying the chicken (before it went in the oven)as some others suggested.  Also added garlic powder to the seasoning mixture as suggested by others.  Whole family enjoyed and I'll be making it again.

Absolutely love this recipe. Super easy to make. I do think original recipe forgot to mention when to cook the whites of the green onions. I'm assuming when you throw the mushrooms in that would be a good time to put the whites in.

Delicious!  My chicken thighs were boneless and appeared to cook through while browsing them in the bacon grease, so instead of baking them and then adding the sauce afterwards, I set them aside while I made the sauce; then put the sauce on and baked the whole thing.  Delicious!  Will definitely make again.  Served with spaghetti squash and a salad, excellent dinner!

This was a winner, will make again whether on or off keto diet.  I did add a bit more garlic and used boneless, skinless thighs and half and half cream.  Delicious

This recipe was delicious! I added a serrano pepper and some minced garlic before I put in the chicken broth. Just long enough until they were fragrant. I also used boneless skinless chicken thighs. I just cooked them in the skillet without putting in the oven. Definitely making this again.

I followed this exactly and everything turned great! I think the sauce was a little thin but after turning up the heat a little it came together.  A delicious dish and we will  make it again. The picture on the page looks like what your going to have.

I used 1 big vidalia onion
1 box of mushrooms
6-7 allspice
After I did as the recipe directs, I added the fried onions and mushrooms in the cast iron skillet with the chicken, covered it, baked it for another 30 min, and added cream and milk for another 10 min in the oven.

The flavor was great! I tripled the sauce to top mashed potatoes also. Next time I'll use some cornstarch to thicken the sauce to more of  a gravy consistency.

I told my daughter I wanted THIS recipe prepared for my birthday dinner.  She tripled the recipe and it was devoured.  The sauce is incredible.  It was beautiful when served too.  I think she added a little garlic to the recipe but other than that she stayed with the recipe instructions.  If you want leftovers, you better make extra, because everyone goes back for seconds of this. Thank you France C for posting this gem.

Fabulous recipe - I made it stove top with boneless skinless chicken thighs which were falling apart and melt in your mouth.  I added fresh garlic (but I do that to most recipes).  Enjoy!

This was something I will be making again, but I'll be adding either a mild cheese (mozzarella or provolone) or Xanthan Gum to thicken the sauce.

I made the recipe exactly as written.   It can't help but being good, right... I mean, bacon and cream....?  But I would liked for the sauce to have been thicker. As it was, the sauce was too thin to stick to the chicken at all.  It also would have been a better dish if it had some sort of herbal undertone, like adding a pinch of tarragon with the mushrooms

Pretty good as is. The only thing I did differently was make more sauce and add more mushrooms.  Served with zoodles  on the side. Def a keeper!

This was a very tasty way to prepare chicken thighs.  Like many keto recipes, it is quite filling and satisfying, but the flavors in this were a nice change from what seems like the same list of dinner ingredients, just cooked in different ways.  Thank you for the great recipe.

I made this for my husband who is on the Keto diet. I made it according to the recipe, except I used chicken breasts instead of thighs (just because that's what I had) and added slices of cheddar over the chicken once it was finished in the oven, while I was cooking the mushrooms. My husband said it was amazing, and that it was a good thing to add the cheese. I will be making it again!

Easy and tasty even without the bacon. I also substituted the heavy cream for sour cream as that’s what I had - tasted delicious. Will make again.

Who knew chicken thighs were SO delicious?!
This recipe rocked. Took a bit longer than I expected though with so many “stages”. Served it with spinach and salad.

This was really good, very easy and a hit with everyone. I made it on the stove since I didn't want to heat up the house. Summer in Paradise can be Hell. Next day I added more sauce and put rice in it and again, very tasty. Thanks

I am hard to please, but this recipe is a winner! Only addition I made was to add a minced garlic clove with the mushrooms. Since I only had light cream, I used it and it was fine. 
Great flavor, tender chicken and easy to make.

My family loved it. Our daughter never tried mushrooms but she love it on this chicken. Everyone said it was the best chicken they have ever tasted. LOL 

Just an fyi, I used regular chicken broth and it was still delicious. Looked exactly the picture, next time I will post a pic. This is definitely a meal that will be on heavy rotation in our home

I baked the bacon at 400 degrees for 15 minutes—maybe a bit longer because I used thick bacon. I always save some bacon grease in the freezer, so I just started frying the thighs while the bacon was in the oven. I  also added some fresh baby spinach and fresh mushrooms. Could have been a little thicker. But it was pretty good.
