A little weird. I love parmesan cheese, so I thought i would love this, but they're like parmesan donut holes. A little too greasy and just weird. Sorry....

Make sure you fold the cheese in. If you stir it in, it will be very dense.

These were very easy to make and quite tasty! They did seem a little salty to me, but I guess that's to be expected. All in all, these were fun and good! Thanks for sharing. :)
