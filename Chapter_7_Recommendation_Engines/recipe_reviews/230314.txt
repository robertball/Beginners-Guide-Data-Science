Tasty! My husband and I both LOVE the carrot in it. I made in the food processor and used green onion instead of regular onion. The green onion I added after the food processor. Had leftovers next day with tortilla chips. Yum!

i minced shallots and celery and added mayo and just a tiny bit of blue cheese along with other ingredients. . Next time put in a lot more blue cheese or mix in blue cheese dressing. That would make it super yummy!

EASY - Needed more Mayonnaise.  Make sure you chop all your items for better spreading.  I put a touch of mustard in ours and it added much more taste.

this is a recipe I grew up with without the carrots and add mustard. There never seemed to be enough.

Very nice, lite (low cal mayo) and refreshing way to use leftover roast beef.  I had less than a cup and adjusted the recipe accordingly.
