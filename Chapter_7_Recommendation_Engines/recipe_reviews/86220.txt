I tried several other recipes, and this one is the best and easiest! Normally I try a recipe, then tweak it to what it needs or doesn't, but this one needed no changes. The only thing I do different is use fresh lemon juice and put a bit more horseradish, which is purely because of the unavailability of bottled concentrate and my own taste for horseradish. Kudos to Craig!

Excellent cocktail sauce - I would have never thought to put A1 in this, but suprisingly it was very good.

I have made this cocktail sauce several times and it is absolutly delicious.  Not only do we use it for seafood, but my children love to dip fresh vegitables in it.  Once you've had this sauce, you'll never use any other cocktail sauce again.

Awesome!  It wasn't until 20 minutes before dinner, I grabbed the bottle of cocktail sauce out of the fridge and saw there was only a couple of tablespoons in the bottle.  I jumped online, saw this recipe, saw that I had all of the ingredients (although my bottled lemon juice was expired!).  I mixed it all up anyway.  Wasn't sure what constitutes Hot Pepper Sauce, so I used Crystal Hot Sauce.  It was so good, I didn't want to mix it with the store bought stuff.  I recalculated the recipe for 2 servings which made about 1/2 of a standard bottle.

Wow!  This was so great.  I made it to go with boiled shrimp, and my guests stood around eating in plain on crackers!  Only change I made was to add two chipotle peppers (soaked in water to soften, stem/seeds removed and finely chopped.)  This recipe rocks!!  Thanks, Craig!!

I'm not one of these people who changes absolutely everything and then gives a rating based on my concoction rather than the original recipe.  This cocktail sauce is GREAT just as written!  Lots of things depend on personal taste and cocktail sauce is one of them so I made a couple of changes to suit MY taste but as I said, it's definitely five stars as written).  I couldn't find a 36 oz bottle of ketchup, 32 was as close as I could come so I used that, but didn't make any adjustments to the recipe.  After tasting it I decided it needed a little more horseradish for my taste so I added an extra tablespoon.  I used A-1 steak sauce and Lea & Perrins Worcestershire sauce and Louisiana Hot Sauce (15 drops per the recipe, which gives it a pretty good kick along with the extra horseradish I added.  Play with the hot sauce until you reach the temperature you like.  Thanks, Craig for a great cocktail sauce recipe.

I made this as directed (except for scaling the recipe to 6 servings) and, while good, it didn't taste any different than anything you'd get out of a bottle.  It just didn't 'Wow' me. I prepared it and tasted it, then allowed it to sit in the 'fridge for the flavors to meld.  After re-tasting I added more horseradish and a wee bit of pepper.  It was better, but still not as great as I expected.

Tried this as is only cut down to two servings because I just had a small amount of shrimp left over after making a shrimp and pasta salad. It is perfect! I've always done just a quick ketchup and horseradish cocktail sauce, but adding the Worcestershire, steak sauce, lemon juice, and hot pepper sauce makes all the difference in the world. Some horseradish is hotter than others, so a little more or less to your liking would be entirely appropriate. Thank you, CDSN99, for sharing!

I made this for our yearly progressive party and it was a hit. Everyone wanted the recipe.  I'd probably add a little more heat my next batch.  I did make it 2 days in advance to allow the flavors to meld. I'll be making this again!

This is sooooo good! I will never buy cocktail sauce again. I was in a pinch with you-peel-ems and no cocktail sauce. Looked this up on All-
Recipes and voila! Tastes fresher and better than any bottled sauce.

Being from Annapolis we eat a lot of cocktail sauce and tarter sauce with our seafood.  What I love about this is you can add alittle more of one inngredient to your liking.  I followed the recipe as is except I did not have any steak sauce.  Still fabulous.  I cut the recipe in half and my husband loved it too with our breaded shrimp. It's a keeper in my recipe box. thx

VERY GOOD!!  This is a great cocktail sauce that’s a snap to make.  I scaled this down and probably made about 1/3 of the recipe and had plenty for a gathering of 12 people on Thanksgiving Day.  This is as good, if not better, than what you might buy in a jar.  And I really like the fact that I can make what I need and not have yet another partially used condiment bottle taking up room in my fridge.

This is great, a standard cocktail sauce is lemon juice ketchup and horseradish - it works, but its just not *WOW*.  this on the other hand has the right proportions and additions that give it that *WOW* factor. my only difference... a bit of celery and a TINY bit at that. My Sis likes to add a bit of apple cider vinegar.. go figure :) I guess in the end it's all about what you like and I LOVE this :)

Delicious!  Super easy to make!  Perfect topping with raw oysters and crackers.  Plenty left over to save :)
Many great compliments from guests as well.  I will definitely make this my go-to cocktail sauce.  Thanks Craig!

I did a side by side taste comparison with this and store bought cocktail sauce and they tasted nothing alike. I doubled the amount of horseradish and hot pepper sauce, but it still wasn't quite right. Not sure I would make this again.

I've never made cocktail sauce before so I have nothing to compare it to. But my husband like it very much, w a bit more horseradish, and a touch of brown sugar.

Made this to serve with shrimp for a Christmas party. Ran out of shrimp before the sauce was gone. One guy actually got a spoon and ate the sauce out of the bowl.  A really easy and tasty recipe.  Would give it more stars if I could.

I really liked this cocktail sauce. I minced up some extra shrimp and put it in the sauce, just to kick up the shrimp notch and it was really good!!

I made this in a pinch, had to sub cider vinegar for lemon, soy for steak sauce and this was perfect! My sis-in-law & I tasted it, said, "it tastes like cocktail sauce" and that was that. Absolutely perfect taste and took a whole two minutes to make (including getting the stuff outta the pantry). Loving it! Thanks for making me look good :)

Very disappointing.  It tasted like ketchup.  This recipe might be worth trying again with fresh horseradish and tomatoes.

This is the best cocktail sauce EVER! I have bought many different brands and none of them were ever good. I used a 32oz. bottle of ketchup, I used more horseradish and hot sauce than the recipe called for to give it more of a kick, I also used lemon juice not from concentrate so I halved the amount. It does make a lot of sauce, but I just put it back in the bottle to have on hand for next time!

It is better than store bought! But I like mine hotter. I buy homemade horseradish in my Town--and it's VERY hot. I found I still had to add a couple extra tablespoons. I made haddock fish frys and put the sauce on them...delicious!

This one saved me in a pinch when guests were practically on the doorstep!  I quartered the recipe and it worked great.  I added a bit more hot pepper sauce than called for, but that is probably individual taste.  A keeper!

The others are right...this is the best cocktail sauce I have ever had! I cut the recipe in half & I don't use lemon concentrate so I used a sample packet of TrueLemon.

EXCELLENT!   I can't stand the store bought coctail sauce in a jar.  I tried this one to serve with shrimp for our Christmas Shrimp Coctails and it was wonderful.  I loved the idea of just putting it back into the ketchup bottle, even though there was a little excess.  I did add a little more horseradish because I like it to have a little more kick...otherwise just perfect and a keeper in my recipe book.  Thanks!

I was frustrated buying cocktail sauce from the store, spending $4-$6 a bottle and being disappointed with what was inside.  I decided to try this sauce and was very pleased.  This was exactly what I was looking for - great taste, a little 'zip' and the same flavor I get in the restaurants.  Great recipe, I won't be searching for another, I've found the right one.  BTW, I had to make no adjustments to this recipe, it's great as is.  It does make a large batch, you may want to scale it down if you don't use it all the time.

Really good stuff! I used the juice of a real lemon, but other than that, this is a wonderful sauce. Thanks so much!

I just mixed this up to go with our shrimp for dinner and it's wonderful!  I adjusted the recipe to 4 servings and didn't have lemon juice but had a lime so used lime juice.  Also added a little extra horseradish to suit our taste.  This is a great cocktail sauce!  Won't be buying the prepared stuff again!

This is the most perfect cocktail sauce ever!  I love it.  I added way more horseradish than the recipe calls for (I love it spicy), but I didn't change anything else.  I'll never buy bottled cocktail sauce again.  The perfect combination of ingredients.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I never buy cocktail sauce anymore. My husband raves about this.  Since there are only two of us I scale it down and I have to admit that I eyeball my measurements so they are approximate to this recipe.  I omit the salt but everything else is pretty much the same. Thank you Craig!

Very good!   It was just what I was looking for!  I'm not ever going to pay for bottled cocktail sauce again, now that I know I have a good recipe to rely on.  And it's easy to make only the amount needed.  No expiring commercial bottle taking up real estate in my refrigerator.

This is great. I got everything at the grocery to make cream cheese/shrimp dip except cocktail sauce! I made a smaller batch for what I needed, but used all the ingredients in the recipe then printed it for the future. Thanks so much!

Good nice combination of sweet and tangy.  I use Heinz Chili sauce instead of catsup.  I also use real lemon, white pepper and more shakes of the hot sauce to taste

Tasty, easy to make. It makes way way more than the serving size suggested though; it might be best to simply cut the recipe in half.

Really good! I cut down the recipe to just make what we needed for now, and winged it on the amounts (just adding everything to taste) since we don't use cocktail sauce all that often. I didn't have any horseradish so I used some Deli style mustard (one that is spicy and has horseradish in it - Boar's Head). I also added some celery salt to taste and used a healthy squirt of Sriracha for the hot sauce. Tastes great - just enough spice and kick and all the flavors are just right!

I halved the recipe because it makes a LOT--WAY too much for the 2 LBs of shrimp we had. I used 3 drops of Dave's Insanity hot sauce and some extra horseradish. I added the A1 at the end because I was hesitant of the flavor outcome. DH thought it needed less, but I thought it added the perfect flavor combo. USE THIS COCKTAIL SAUCE!!!

This was really great, but I did change one thing based on another recipe that I read.  I did half Chili sauce and half ketchup and it is SOOO good!  It adds a little bit of sweetness and is just perfect!  I too increased the horseradish and tabasco.

Pretty good - i made 1/9th of the recipe (4 oz of ketchup, which is what i had) - over-measuring generously on horseradish, hot sauce, etc - very good, but not as tasty as our favorite (Crosse & Blackwell Zesty Shrimp Sauce) - i think it's probably a matter of onion, so will try adding onion powder next time.

Made this for my husband and son with shrimp cocktail.  They both liked it.  It was easy to make.

The best cocktail sauce I've tasted - not too sweet or too spicy.    This will be my standard.

Insanely good. I doubled the horseradish because we like ours spicy, and it's better than anything in a jar.

You don't NEED to buy it at the store anymore!  Those small jars purchased at store never last long...this is the way to go and it will keep in the fridge!

I tried all the store versions, and this was better than any of them! It's so easy & you know it's fresh. It is the prefect blend of spices.

This was wonderful. I perpared it for my Husbands Friday lunch, for fish day. I made a  change of 1(one)sliced stalk of celery for half the bell pepper. I did not have fresh cilantro so I used 1 tablespoon of dried cilantro. We loved this and it is a keeper.

Had to double the recipe because the hot sauce was just to hot for us.  Still very good now that we know that.  Thanks for the recipe.
