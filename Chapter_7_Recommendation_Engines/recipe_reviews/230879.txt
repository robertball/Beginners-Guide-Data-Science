I added garlic and ginger.  The avocado and peaches tone down the heat of the jalapeno. This is a great summer salad!

Quick, easy. My husband wondered why we hadn't had this before and said this was a salad he would like to have often!

I really was looking forward to loving this dish but unfortunately no one at our dinner get together enjoyed it.  I think this dish has a lot of potential, in fact everything went really well right up until the avocado was added.  All of the flavors work very well together until the avocado changes the texture of the salad and then it's just not good at all.  I think the previous reviewer's garlic suggestion is a good one.  In the future I would definitely leave out the avocado- with a few changes this would be great over chicken, with chips, or even spooned over the top of sliced avocado.  As is, it unfortunately wasn't good.

Made it twice already. Left out the jalapeno peppers and had to substitute dried cilantro for fresh. Served over a bed of spring mix greens. Tortilla chips also paired well with this. My three-year-old enjoyed it, too.
