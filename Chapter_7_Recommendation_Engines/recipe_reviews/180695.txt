First time jelly maker,here. The results were fantastic. This is a great recipe. I used fresh strawberries and fresh jalapeno peppers. Word of advice **Use disposable latex gloves when handling peppers** I learned the hard way. I removed the veins and half of the seeds from the peppers. The jam was mild. I plan on making a "spicier" batch and will use a habanero pepper along with the jalapenos. Thank you for the recipe! Amanda Mobile, AL

I used a combination of strawberries and raspberries, cut sugar to 6 c and used all the seeds from the jalapeno's and it turned out awesome!

This is a fun jan to make. Very simple and looks really pretty! It is sweet and sassy! It does not have near the heat that jalapeno jelly has so if you are looking for a tamed down version of a hot pepper spread,this would be it. It is wonderful on bagels and cream cheese. I made a quick fruit dip stirring this in with cream cheese and a couple of tablespoons of cream. Thanks for sharing this recipe

This jam is very sweet and very hot! Just the way we like it, and it sets up beautifully! I think we may have to eat it with cream cheese to tone down the heat! I made it hot as written by using one seeded anaheim pepper and 3 seeded jalapenos and 3 with the seeds. (They all still totalled one cup when finely chopped). If you like it mild, remove all the seeds and just use jalapenos. Great recipe if all you have is frozen berries, use the unsweetened ones and make sure you measure the four cups AFTER you mash them. Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe!

Disappointed that this didn't gel like it should have, but I don't think it's the recipe's fault.  Recipe calls for a 2-oz pkg of powdered fruit pectin, but I now see that Sure-Jell reduced the size to 1.75 oz, just like so many other companies are doing.  They try not to increase price much, but they just reduce the size which can totally screw up recipes.  The flavor on this jam is great.  So your options are to use the 1.75 oz pkg and try to adjust the quantity of the other ingredients or open another pkg (at cost of $1.70) for the additional 1/4 oz and probably just pitch the rest of the opened pkg.  3.31.11 update:  this firmed up overnight, so I'm upgrading the review to 5 stars...it's now perfect!

i tried this recipe and it came out watery and it seperated, o cal my aunt who has been mamking strawberry preserves since her mother was doing it to find out what went wrong, although the recepi is good, here was went wrong: the only thing that needs to be boiled is the pectin and water, stir sugar,crushed berries,jalpenos, and lemon juice and let sit for 10 min..bring pectin and water to boil and keep stirring for 1 min. AND USE 2 PACKAGES OF PECTIN. pour into strawberry mixture and keep stiring for at least 3 min. pour into containers and let sit ar room temp for 24 hrs.

This is AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!  I have a favorite jam that I make every year for gifts, but I'm going to have to make a huge batch of this instead this year!  My husband and I have a really hard time not completely tearing through an entire jar (I put it in 1/4 pint jars) in one sitting.  :D  YUM!

Excellent flavor!  Reminiscent of chutney, but much more simple.  I did wind up using at least a cup less sugar, but I'm sure it depends on your strawberries so I would just make sure to add sugar to taste instead of dumping it all in.

This strawberry jalapeño jam is absolutely fabulous !
I made one batch following recipe as written. And it was delicious every jar was gone within a week ( had guests all week ) . I made another batch but this time I  used the seeds and membranes of two of the jalapeños to give it a but of heat ...  It was just enough to give it a little 
zip of heat , but not so hot that it over piers the taste of the berries , I did add the pepper seeds and membranes a little at a time as the jam was cooking,  and  spooned tiny bits of jam on a n iced cold plate to taste test and added more seeds until it tasted just right . This is one of the easiest and virtually full proof recipes . 
Be carefull with the amounts of pectin in the boxes.  They've reduced the amounts in the boxes  so if your used to the standard two oz box, good luck finding  it.
Most boxes now are 1.1  or 1.5 oz, depending on the brand . I bought the ball pectin in a jar since it's more economical, and for this jam I started with three tablespoons then gradually added a fourth to get the consistency I wanted, per the freezer plate test. A good tip to know is that the amount of juice  / liquid your fruit yields  after you crush them, effects more or less  how much tweaking you need to do with pectin . Just my experience . 
Anyway, this jam recipe is excellent and make a few batches. It will go !

We live in Colorado where people have a pretty high tolerance for hot peppers, so to make it have a little more bite, I put 2 serrano peppers, 1 anahiem pepper, & 2 jalapeno peppers in my Magic Bullet blender--all with seeds.  I added that pepper mash to crushed strawberries to make an extra cup (5 total) of fruit.  Then I deseeded 1 more jalapeno,diced it up--for color--and added it to the fruit. I did up half of my jars just like that. I liked it, but my husband thought it could stand to be even hotter, so I added a 4oz can of Ortega fire roasted diced green chilies HOT to the rest of the jam in the pot and stirred them in.  I did up the rest of my jars with the HOT jam (being sure to take note which jars were the HOT so I could label them correctly the next day). I had a little jam that didn't fit in the jars, so we had it hot over vanilla icecream--YUMMY! Sweet and spicy! I'm looking forward to giving this great jam as gifts for the holidays! Thanks for sharing!

I just finished making the final batch of Jalapeno Strawberry Jam (we grew our own strawberries!) and I had great success with this recipe! My hubby was so anxious to try some and when he did he loved it! I would recommend this recipe, I know for sure it is going in my recipe box. It is a keeper!

This was my first experience with making jam and it turned out beautifully. Unfortunately my jalapenos molded before I got around to making this so I omitted them. My husband and I freaked at the amount of sugar it called for so we stopped at 4 cups. I was afraid it wouldn't gel but not so - It's perfect. Next time I can't wait to make it spicy :)

Was very good. Seeded only half of the peppers but may keep all the seeds the next time. There's more strawberry flavor than jalapeno.

Just finishing making a batch and lids are sealed.  This is so good.  You keep eating it even though it at times taste a little warm the sweetest of the strawberries balances the flavors.  Can not wait until next year when the berries come in and the peppers are fresh.  Thanks again for a great recipe.

Talk about a party in your mouth! Its so tasty with the wonderful strawberry and a touch of heat. Its a big hit with everyone that taste it. Only problem is the more people that taste it the more people that want it. As a result we have been making it quite often this fall. And I must say were getting good at it. Thanks for sharing.

Yummy! You can certainly adjust the heat by seeding or not the peppers. I love to serve it with cream cheese and wheat thins. My Dh puts it on toast. Thank you!

mmm good. I like heat, so instead of cleaning the peppers, I processed them seeds and all. there is a nice afterburn, but I think next time I might throw in a habanero pepper.  I served this over a wheel of warm brie, and it was gone in seconds...

I made this great strawberry jam recipe yesterday.  It came out fantastic for a sweet, strawberry jam...however, I am a novice jam maker and wasn't sure on the peppers so apparently I went too light.  I would prefer to kick it up a notch and will make it again using something much hotter...serve it with cream cheese and crackers.

very simple to make. I used 2 quarts of strawberries and the recipe made 10 - 1/2 pint jars. Wasn't too spice. I like to pour over a block of cream cheese with some crackers.

I changed this only by not using pectin, I just kept it boiling for ten minutes until I was ready...I used the freezer plate method!   Splendid recipe and results...can't wait to share it with family and friends!

This is delicious!  For those of you who are having trouble with it setting up, please don't reduce sugar or change amounts of fruit.  Usually, jam recipes cannot be doubled, either.

This was perfect... I've had Jalapeno Jam before but never with strawberrys... It was awesome... My family serves it by pouring over a square block of cream cheese and spreading on crackers. I never made jam before and didn't relize how easy it was... Recipe is perfect as is. Not to spicy that the kid can't eat... But enough spice to know you are eating jalapeno... I made enough to hand out to everyone for Christmas.. Thanks

I gave 4 stars because the original recipe wasn't hot enough for me or my family. I used this as the basis for my jam though. The second time around I chose jalapeño peppers that looked like they would be hotter(and they were) and chopped the tops off and pureed the rest, seeds and all. To get hotter peppers find ones that have what looks like stretch marks on them.(milder peppers are smooth and lighter colored) I cut the sugar in this recipe in half to allow some of the heat from the peppers to stick around. (The sugar tones them down a lot) The last change I made was that I used the Ball pectin that comes in a jar to measure out by tbsp. I like to use low to no sugar added pectin in my jams because I always add a lot less sugar than recipes generally call for. I use almost a tbsp for each cup of strawberries. This time around it came out just like I was hoping for. I think my sister and my aunt will love it!
Oh, also I puree my strawberries instead of just mashing them. Which is also why I add more pectin to help it set better.

This was so easy and very yummy. I followed the recipe exactly and I didn't have any problems with it setting up. My sure jell box was 1.75 ounces, so I hesitated, but still used it, and didn't change a thing, and it worked perfectly still. It isn't too spicy, nor is it mild. I made it to serve at a baby shower over cream cheese and with wheat thins and it was a huge hit!

Wow! This jam is fantastic!!!!! I made one batch and took it to a dinner party as a hostess gift, and we wound up eating it over cream cheese as an appetizer. It got such rave reviews, I had to make a double batch this morning (18 jars) so I'll have it for gifts. It also wowed my new choir director when I gave it as a welcome gift. He knows my name, but he thinks of me as "the jam lady". THANK YOU!

I made this jam when the strawberries were in season. It's awesome! So good, I made 4 batches to give as gifts this Christmas. 

I did make a few changes. I didn't used fresh jalapenos. For some reason, I thought using the jalapenos I pickled last year was the same thing. When I realized my mistake, I added some dried jalapenos that I ran through my food processor. I figured the pickled peppers might not have enough heat, and adding the dried peppers would add it back. When everything was coming up to boil on the stove, I used my immersion blender to get rid of most of the lumps. I don't care for large chunks of fruit in my jam. 

I don't know how the "original" tastes, but my changes turned out OMG good!. The jam is sweet, with a slight hint of the peppers. The heat is a very subtle, slow heat. The color is beautiful, with very small pieces of pepper throughout. 

This is one recipe that I will make again!!!

Very, very good! My batch gave me 9 jars from the recipe so you may want to plan to have an extra jar, lid & ring ready just in case. The strawberries I used were sweet, so I only ended up using 6 cups sugar and I was hoping this wouldn't result in a set failure; it did not (whew!). Even with less sugar, it resulted in a "mild" pepper jam. I can't wait to give a jar to my brother; he will love this!

I wanted to make a small batch of this recipe to test it first...after reading the other reviews, I modified mine a bit to compensate for oversweetness. I used 2C. crushed strawberries, 3 jalapenos (1 1/2 seeded) and 2 1/2C. sugar. I also used 1 oz. liquid pectin instead of powder, and added a pinch of salt. So far, from my tasting the pot, it is very yummy! It's got a little kick to it, but with a nice balance. Somehow, I managed to get 6 widemouth half pints out of this "small" batch. LOL I'm also wondering if I might have used a bit much pectin. The residue in the pot (which has been sitting 20 mins) has hardened. Hmmm....anyhow, this recipe is wonderful and makes a great base to start with. Next I plan on making some with agave nectar instead of sugar for a lower calorie version! :))

This stuff is great.  My grandma has always made it, but I wanted some without having to bother her.  It was SO easy.  For a first time canner, this is a great recipe to try.  I didn't have any trouble with the process and now I feel like I can can anything.  :)  The only changes I made was to use more strawberries (approx 6 cups) and fewer jalapeños (approx 1/2 cup).  It was so easy and delicious.  It's wonderful as a dip for animal crackers.  Try it.  You'll love it!

I've tried out several recipes for jalapeno jellies but THIS recipe is what I've been searching for!  I wasn't sure if I was supposed to take the seeds and membranes out of the peppers but decided to scoop out most of it with my little Pampered Chef Cook's Corer which works awesome for cleaning out peppers. Oh, and no I don't sell PP! :)  Back to this jam...it's looks, smells and tastes wonderful with just a little bite. I used mucho nacho jalapenos from my garden.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is really good.  I made a batch less than a week ago and it is gone.  Just a note, but one major brand of pectin is 2 oz and the other is less.  No problem with setting with the 2 oz package : )

followed the recipe to a "T".  It set up BEAUTIFULLY after 24 hours!!  When I saw SEVEN cups of sugar I bulked but I didn't mess with the formulation since the sugar no only helps it to set up but it also acts as a preservative and I didn't want to risk doing something that could make someone sick later on.  Canning has to be fairly precise  and I am NO master so i stick to the recipes :D  Even with all that sugar it was not TOO sweet at all, it was very balanced.  I seeded and de-membraned all the peppers so there was jalapeno flavor but NO heat.  next time I will keep them in because I was looking forward to some heat. I only left them out so the kids could eat it..   all in all, good jam and will make again but didn't knock my socks off like some of the other reviewers

Hey there! This was the first jam I have ever made.. and now I have made it twice. I made it for christmas, and then was asked about a week later to make another batch because my friends loved it so much! The longest thing really, is sterilizing the jars. The jam itself takes little time. It was not as thick as I imagined it would be, but it is very pleasing on crackers with goat or cream cheese. Sweet and spicy with a bit of after burn! 
Things I did: I doubled my batch. I used pectin powder (as opposed to liquid). I used about 5 jalapenos. I used frozen strawberries.
Things I wish I DIDN'T DO: Oh god. I cut the jalapenos without gloves. My hands were burning like I stuck them on the hot stove for HOURS after. Please wear gloves when you cut your jalapenos, even if this has not happened to you before (because its not happened to me but it depends on the jalapenos). If you do get jalapeno burn, you are going to have to put your hands under the hottest water you can stand, and then wash well with dish soap. Just wear the gloves!

Absolutely fantastic. I upped the jalepeno after a taste test in the pot. I reduced the recipe to make just 1 jar, but after tasting I know I should have made dozens for christmas gifts.

Wonderful jelly!  So easy and good.  I only put 6 cups of sugar in this, added some jalapeno seeds and it's mildly spicy/sweet.  You can always make this hotter if you prefer.  So proud of my jelly!  Thanks for this recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly..  using fresh berries, and canned minced jalapenos as an option in the recipe.  I used powdered pectin..  a 2 ounce box, and half of another 2 ounce box that had expired.   I looked up using out of date pectin, and found that outdated pectin will not hurt you.  I used my outdated pectin because when I went to buy pectin at the store..  the amount in a box is now 1.75 ounces..  and the cost has almost doubled.  One box of 1.75 ounce pectin costs almost $6.00 here!  The recipe worked out perfectly!

Love, love, love this jam.  I have made several batches of it for the past two years, and always run out.  I've made no changes to the recipe, and used fresh strawberries and fresh jalapenos.  Cannot recommend this enough!

Made this today and it is delicious.  I only used 5 cups of sugar and that was plently.  It certainly has a kick to it.  Can't wait to serve it over some cream cheese on 4th of July.  It has not set up as much as I would like, so next time (and there will certainly be a next time) I will use 2 boxes of pectin.  I highly recommend this recipe.

WOW!  This strawberry jam rocks! I gave a jar to some friends and several family members. Our grown children are asking me to make more as soon as possible.  I made it 2 weeks ago and it is all gone!

A very easy to make, berry delicious jelly!  I cleaned out the seeds/membranes, and there is just a hint of heat to this jelly.  Definitely leave in some seeds or, if you want some real heat, I'd suggest adding a habanero or maybe two!  The strawberry mixed with the jalapeno gives a sweet tangy flavor, you know it isn't plain old strawberry, and someone who doesn't know what's in it might just sit and wonder what the secret ingredient is that produces such a delightful taste.  Tried it with cream cheese and it was perfect.  Easy for the first time jelly maker - delicious enough to think it was made by a pro! Made 8 - 8oz. jars for me!  Thanks a bunch for this great recipe!

EXCEPTIONALLY good!  Fresh jalapenos from my garden (about 1 cup) and about 2 cups crushed fresh strawberries, the rest halved as per recipe, but used 1 pack liquid pectin.  4-5 pint jam jars.  WONDERFUL zing with no hiding of the strawberry.  BOO YAH!

Darling husband brought home a bag of homegrown jalapeno peppers from work - God Bless people who shared their homegrown goods!  I had a bunch of strawberries in the refrigerator that were past their prime so this recipe was perfect!  I didn't quite have 4 cups of crushed strawberries so I added two pulverized peaches.  I guesstimated the amount of peppers.  I ended up with 10 half pints of jam and just a little left over to test.  This stuff is awesome on crackers with cream cheese.  Thanks!

I made this jam for my church's annual strawberry festival and it was a sell-out.  Before deciding to add this flavor to our line-up, I did a taste testing with church members one morning after worship.  It was a HIT!  In fact, church members bought my whole supply even before the festival so I had to make more just days before the festival!  Will definitely make it again and again!

Pretty good flavor. I only used half the jalapenos and took out all of the seeds. It's still spicy enough for my taste. Not sure I'll make it again, since plain strawberry jam is just better.

This jam is very good and easy to make, but it needs more of a kick. I added more jalapenos and a few habaneros and it gave it the sweet/hot flavor I was looking for!

This was so easy to make and I got ton of compliments on the taste. Only change I made was instead of using all jalapeño I used a variety of jalapeño and some roasted green chilies that I had just bought at the local farmers market.

Like others posting here, this was my first time making jam/jelly. What a great result! This is a very pretty jam, great for giving, and tastes great as well. My husband and daughter don't like anything spicy, so they were reluctant to try it, but as reported, there's just a great strawberry-jalapeno flavor without the bite. We ate it with cream cheese and crackers, but I think it would be fantastic over vanilla ice cream as well.

This jam is awesome!  I used 2 cans of Chi-Chi's sliced jalapenos and cut them up really small.  The jam is spicey but not overpowering.  I also used a little extra pectin and 2 bags of frozen whole strawberries. Perfect!!!

Nevermind just holidays, this jam is so easy to make and the flavor so extraordinary, its our year round, go to jam.  We use it to top omelettes, in PB&J sandwhiches, on cream cheese, even as a side with roast.

I made a hot version of this by reversing the amounts of strawberries and peppers. I used Carribean Red Peppers and I love how it turned out. Hot that hurts in a good way!

I made the first batch as written except I added half a green bell pepper, turned out great.  The second batch I wanted a bit spicier, so I did half strawberries, and half raspberries.  I added half a green bell pepper and one habanero pepper.  Turned out delicious!

I put the strawberries and jalapeno peppers into the blender and chopped them that way, it did away with the use of gloves, and it made the jam more the consistancy of jam, without the chunks. I also left the seeds and ribs in the peppers quite a tasty treat.

Tasty! But it didn't set for me properly and is more like a sauce than a jam.  However, I don't have a lot of experience in canning and reduced the sugar...I'll chalk it up to experience and try again next summer.

Absolutely delicious. This was my first attempt at canning and it came out great. We love the sweet hot flavor with cheddar cheese on a cracker.

Loved this! Wonderful sweet heat combination. It's great over cream cheese with crusty bread and crackers for an appetizer with a nice glass of white wine or for breakfast with toast or bagels. I seeded a few of the peppers but other than that kept everything else the same.

Made this for Christmas gifts, packaged in small decorative mason jars decorated with bows. The jars were a hit, so was the Jam, just the right amount of kick too it. Will do again this year.

Fabulous flavor!  I used two habaneros and the balance in jalapenos to make about 1 1/4 cups of diced peppers.  The heat is just right for us.  Mine hasn't set up completely after almost 24 hours (and it may not), but I think this is more operator error since it is only my second batch of jam ever :)  Thanks for a delicious recipe!!!

Excellent flavor!  I did add a second package of pectin b/c it looked like it wasn't going to set up.  But I don't think that I needed to do that.

Excellent! My picky daughter came home from college and LOVED this jelly on a bagel with cream cheese. I may try 1 1/2 cup of jalapenos next time for a little more kick, but it was delicious just as it was!

I usually just make the Jalapeno jam w/cider vinegar... this was a great twist!!!  I too used the seeds for an extra kick, and only 6 cups of sugar.  Thanks for sharing!  These will be great Christmas gifts!  So pretty too.

Fantastic!!!!!! I added in a few serrano peppers (witout seeds) to add to the kick, used lemon and lime juice, (NO SUGAR or SUGAR SUBSTITUTE ) just a little extra pectin as I am on a diet and it is fantastic. My friends loved it and didn't know it had no sugar in it other than what's naturally in the strawberries . $$ Tip: Buy Hoosier Hill 2 lb pectin bags off Amazon for all your jam needs and you won't waste your money at the grocery store. It's like 15 dollars for 2 lbs! Just use 1/4 more pectin than called for if you don't use sugar and want it more firm.

Very good . I blended all the ingredients to a liquid mix where the seeds were still visible . I only used 4 cups of sugar . After dumping 4 cups in 7 seemed to be way to much . It turned out great . Sweet & good with a hot after bite . Jam seamed to set up fast , but Shur jell usually does the job . I used the 1.75 oz bag .

Great Recipe! FYI - I used the new packaged 1.75 oz. of pectin and it had no significant change to the jelly/jam consistency. I love that you can control the heat by the seeds. Made this with strawberries, but I bet raspberries would be great too!

I made this jam today and it turned out wonderful. I have only tasted a little of it warm before canning, but it was delicious and I can't wait to cook with it. I did add a tiny bit of butter to my second batch to help with the "foam" that can come with jams and jellies, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I will absolutely make this again!

The flavor was great.  The jam, however, crystallized, I'm not sure why. I used fresh strawberries and the recommended amount of pectin.  It was like the foam on the top just got more in the jars.  I have been canning for about 40 years and have never had this happen.  I'm still eating it, but I won't be able to give it away....any suggestions as to what to do differently next time?

Great recipe! Made a double batch, some fresh some frozen strawberries. Added 1/3 of the seeds and reduced the sugar to about 10 cups so it was spicier. It is best/ healthiest to taste test along the sugar adding process so you can add the least amount of sugar to suit your taste buds. I usually get less sugar than the recipe calls for. I also used ball no/ low sugar pectin and I used 6 tablespoons for a double batch and it worked perfectly!

This is EXCELLENT!! To crush the strawberries, I put them in the food processor.  While making it, I realized I did not have pectin so I added one envelope of gelatin instead.  It was a little too runny but very close. I tasted it and added a little more jalapenos because it wasn't spicy enough for us (personal choice). I also made the jam and put it in the freezer instead of canning.  It was great on cream cheese and crackers and I also cooked some down in a pot with some vinegar and brushed it on cooked boneless skinless chicken breasts wrapped in bacon.  Delicious!

I just made this recipe and I used 1 and 1/2 packages of pectin. It has been 3 hours and it is still runny, I hope that I thickens over night.  I also used fresh finely grated ginger.  I did not measure I just added to taste you only need about a tablespoon full.  It is amazing!!!!
One question::: If this recipe does not set over night can I empty jars and add more pectin and recan???  I hate to waste it

Since I've made this recipe before with excellent results, I still have to rate it a 5 star.  But...this time it turned out runny and never set up.  I noticed the recipe calls for a 2oz envelope of pectin.  The Sure-Jell I have is now 1.75oz.  Since I only made a half recipe---I weighed out 1 ounce.  It will make a good syrup over waffles or pancakes.  I will try again this weekend and not cut the recipe in half.

Awesome recipe. I have successfully made five batches. For something different, I added some rhubarb to the last one I made. It was our favorite. This jam is great on toast with cream cheese.

If you like a mild heat, then this recipe as written would be for you.  We used 3 C berries and 2 C peppers, which made this so much better.  It was still sweet, but the heat was perfect.  Easy, tasty, and made everyone happy.

FIRST TIME CANNER here! I had a sample of some jam a while ago that 5 years later for had a craving for during this pregnancy! Go figure. So I looked up sweet and hot recipes on the internet and went from there. Came across this one and HAD to give it a try. I used 12 small jars to can this in and had enough left over to snack on! I ended up using 3 ounces of Pectin and it still didn't gel that much. Overall I think I need to experiment more with that stuff to get it to be the right consistency. THIS STUFF IS AMAZING. Strawberily sweet with just the perfect kick of Jalepeno. I've been eating it on Ritz crackers and it is heaven. My family actually purchased half the jars off of me for $4 a piece. I reduce the cost of everything (even the bulk bag of sugar) and it came down to about 1.91 a jar to make. It would be a lot less if I included the sugar I actually used. But I just doubled that and rounded up and no one flinched at the price so I might make a couple more of these and start selling! SO GOOD.

I just made this jam ummmm good. One thing everyone should know please. "PLease respect these little darling Jalapenos. The first batch I made I was sneezing. cuffing. and my hands started burning. The second batch I learned my lesson. Do use rubber gloves, do cut and seed the peppers submerged in a pot of water of cold water and do keep your hands away from your face. But that aside it's all worth it.

Made exactly as stated and it tastes wonderful.  Unfortunately, I must have done something wrong since I have strawberry jalapeno "sauce" rather than jam -- mine didn't set -- but when it tastes this good, who cares?  :)

This was my first experience with making jam. This was interesting and good, and I served it with crackers and cream cheese.  However my friends mother used to make the most amazing strawberry jelly/jam in the world.  I don't know if the quality of the jelly has something to do with the berries themselves, or the sugar, or pectin, but I am still searching for something as sweet and thick as her jelly/jam.  Her strawberries seemed to be more in tact that mine were in this recipe.

Delicious! I like spice and so I I used the whole peppers with seeds. Was worried a bit as I tasted before canning and it was a little hot but once completed it settled and blended well. Favorite so far!

Delicious!! First time canner here--the only thing I made before this was a jalapeno jelly, and though this jalapeno strawberry jam actually took more jalapenos than that recipe did, this was nevertheless much milder. The strawberries must neutralize the heat to some degree. Couple of things I learned: firstly, I grew my jalapenos and recommend you try as well. They are THE easiest thing in my tiny garden to grow, and yield DOZENS of jalapenos. If you do this, not only do you have a large cheap supply of them, but a wider variation of heat choices. Green jalapenos, if left on the plant long enough, develop striations (they look like stretch marks), and are an indication of greater heat. If left on the plant even longer, they turn red. Red are sweeter than green, but even HOTTER still. Many people add veins and seeds to add heat, but with red and/or striations, consider their own heat before adding veins or seeds. That said, since strawberries seem to largely neutralize heat, adding veins and seeds might be in order for this particular recipe if you want more heat, even IF you are using red jalapenos.  Second item I learned was that refrigerating seems to help with setting. Nowhere in my reading did I read this advice, but this batch yielded 10 jars instead of the prescribed 8, so I jarred the final two without putting them in the water bath, for immediate eating. They set WAY faster than the water bath jars, and when I then took some of the water bath jars and refrigerated, t

We made this last night. It was late. The recipe is amazing. We did add one habanero, too! After the jam was canned, we were scraping the bowl with a spatula...and trying not to fight over it! Yes, it is that good! Thank you for sharing this great recipe!

Made it exactly as described except I left out the seeds (it didn’t say to add them). Jam is very good but no heat without the seeds. Will make a second batch with Jalapeno  seeds included.

Delicious! I made this with the low sugar Sure Jell (1.75 oz), so I cut the sugar back to 4 cups, and it is a great consistency. I used all the seeds from the jalapenos and it isn't too spicy at all, just has a nice zip to it.

Wow wonderful!
I shorted the sugar the strawberries were beautiful and didn't have 1 cup of fresh peppers. It was plenty hot.  It was a spicy growing season in my garden. 
We put it on smoked pork butt as a dipping sauce and plan to dip our oven baked chicken in it tonight. I would make again!
I had equal to 10 - 8 oz containers. I also put the strawberries and peppers together in my food processor bowl of my blender to chop/mash.

The strawberry jalapeño jelly is delicious and my friends really liked it. I have never used powdered pectin and the liquid pectin has not been jellying well so I used two packs of liquid pectin which worked. I was short on strawberries so I added enough chopped red bell pepper to meet the measurement of berries. I will make it again. Thanks for the recipe.

I used 6 cups of sugar instead of 7 cups because I had very fresh ripe strawberries. Since powdered pectin comes in 1.75 oz. packages I added about 1.5 TBLS of pectin from another box. I think it was a little too much.

I made it as directed, first time making jam. And as other reviews noted, I’ll try to add more heat next time. But for those who like things mild but like the jalapeño flavor this is perfect! Yum!!

I thawed the strawberries then blended them and it turned out absolutely amazing!! super yummy. I also add another cup of jalapenos for more spice. It's pretty mild with only one cup.

Totally delicious!  Would not change a thing.  I gave some away as gifts and within days people were asking for more.  I would definitely follow the advice of one of the other reviewers who recommended using gloves for the jalapeño cutting - I did not follow this advice the first time and regretted it!

This jam is sooooooo good it's ridiculous. I make it every year at Christmas because my family asks for it as gifts. I also make it for the annual craft fair at my job and it's always the best seller of all my jams. The only thing I change is I only use 5 cups of sugar and I find it to be plenty sweet enough. I've never had anyone tell me that think it needs to be sweeter, so to me 5 cups of sugar makes it perfect!:)

I made no changes to this wonderful recipe but will add more jalepeno next time I make it for just a tiny bit more of a kick.  I love this, I only had two jars left when the county fair entries were due yesterday!  (almost forgot, Amanda's review mentioned using latex gloves when handling the peppers - I didn't and for about an hour shortly after handling and cutting them, my hands felt like I stuck them in boiling water - so DO use gloves !)

My favorite jam. The only thing I did different was to decrease the sugar to 5 1/2 cups. I am not a fan of real sweet foods. My jalapeños seemed pretty hot, so I did remove the seed from a few of them.

This is my go to for strawberry pepper jelly. The texture is perfect and works well over cream cheese or heated for a glaze. It is a milder jelly. More jalapeno and seeds give it more kick. I get requests for this one as birthday and holiday gifts!

My mom loved it! I used jarred jalapenos, because I didn't have fresh. As such, they included seeds and ribs. The jam turned out spicy enough that my sister and I will not be eating it straight. That's okay, though, it wasn't for us! I suspect it will be good on bagels with cream cheese, though.

Very easy to make, even for someone who's never made jam before. I reduced the portions to only 16 servings, and it scaled very well. I'll be making this again.

Delicious recipe! Didn't even to get to have a taste from the first jar as my friends and family ate it all! Only thing I'd change for next time is to add more jalapeño seeds- I took them almost all out so it was fairly mild. I'd like to try it again and make it spicier! Sweet and sassy!

I've made this several times,everyone loves the flavor. Even the ones who claim they don't like hot,are so surprised- once they taste the combination of sweet and hot they love it.
I don't change a thing - I 've done both fresh and jarred jalapeno - sometimes even add a splash of jalapeno juice .  Comes out perfect each time.

I have made this recipe several times now and it is amazing!!  I have tried it substituting raspberries and also blackberries for the strawberries.  I always use MCP Pectin and mine have always set up fine.  Lately I have been using the whole jalepeno (just cut off the top and bottom). It gives it just the right amount of kick - for me!

I loved the simplicity of the recipe. It works great and I made a few changes to it and still worked great. I swapped the jalapeños for Carolina Reaper peppers and I went with liquid pectin instead of powder. I used one 3 oz. sleeve of liquid. My new fav.

This was my first time ever attempting to make jelly. I chose this recipe to help use up my bumper crop of Jalapenos and this certainly made a dent in them. I used about 13 Jalapenos, though since I like things really spicy I will use more next time (and maybe add a Habanero). The best thing about this recipe is that you get the delicious flavor of the Jalapeno without too much heat, so this would be a great addition to the boring cheese and cracker party appetizer. I've already tried it with brie on top of a bagel chips and that was delicious. The jelly was so good, the cheese isn't actually necessary. Just put some on a cracker by itself, it's so good! The only troubles I found with this recipe is trying to figure out how many tablespoons of pectin to use, since I purchased a jar instead of a packet. I used 8 tablespoons and the jelly came out really firm. Next time I could probably do with a little less, but I think I got it almost right. A great recipe that allows individuals to play around with the heat to suit their personal tastes.

I have made jams and jellies many times before but I was anxious to try something new and found this recipe. I am so glad I tried this recipe. It is awesome. I spread the jam over a block of cream cheese and dig into it with crackers. A big hit with my teen son. I wish I could cut back the amount of sugar though. The pectin and the amount of sugar have to be exact or the jam will be runny. I am sure I will find a similar recipe that requires a lower amount of sugar someday. Thanks for the recipe.

I did not use a water bath to process the jars.  Instead I filled the jars and inverted them for 5 minutes, then I turned them upright.  All the jars sealed beautifully.  I make another kind of strawberry jam this way and this method works like a charm.

The flavor was good but not sure I will make this again. It never gelled properly. I think more pectin may be needed. I think I will use a basic strawberry jam recipe and add peppers.

Great recipe.  First time making any jam and this was a good one.  I did not include any seeds so the Jalapeno taste was perfect and mild.  I also used fresh squeezed lemon juice.  Flavor turned out yummy.  Consistency was just right.

I used 6 jalepeno and just threw them whole in the little chopper first. Also I used lime juice instead of lemon. My jelly is spicy, sweet, tangy and absolutely perfect! I love, love, love this recipe.

First time jelly maker here. It was so easy to do. I only made half the recipe so I could try it to see if I liked it.  I tried it out with jalapeño poppers and it was delicious. Can't wait to try it with other things and excited to make more. I did substitute 1 cup of strawberries with 1 cup of raspberries. I added extra jalapeños for a little more heat. Both the peppers and berries were fresh.

Time consuming but all canning is. Smelled wonderful while cooking. I made it just like the recipe and yielded 10 half-pints or jelly jars. This is my first time making jelly. I can't wait to try it. I'm going to give out as Christmas time.

Delicious! Family hovered around it. I grow my own tomatoes and needed to use them and was really glad I found this recipe. I was timid at first having never made anything like this but it was easy. It did take 1 1/2 hours to reduce though but totally worth it. Christmas is around the corner and would be great as a gift alone or in a gift basket. Can't wait!! Thank You for reading, Lisa

Excellent!  I made 2 versions; 1 without seeds and 1 with.  Neither were extremely hot however, the batch with the seeds did have some heat and is great served over pork tenderloin, chops or ham.

I just made a batch of this jam and it taste wonderful. My box of pectin was only 1.7, not 2 oz, but didn't realize until home from the market. I didn't have lemons on hand so used lime juice instead, and though the recipe didn't instruct as to if they deseeded the peppers, or not, I chose to take half out and use half. I grew the berries and peppers myself so were super fresh. I think I'll try to make a batch using some frozen cranberries next!

I hardly ever rate recipes on here, but I couldn't pass this up. I've been searching for jalapeno strawberry jam for almost 3 years after finding it in NC while on vacation with my husband. I have yet to find any around where I live. This is EXACTLY what I've been wanting and is so freaking amazing!!! I will never buy jam from the store again. This is perfection! Btw, this was my first time ever making jam, and it turned out perfectly. Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe!

I've made this twice and it has set nicely both times.  The first batch I followed the recipe as written and although it is delicious.. I wanted a bit more heat.  The sweetness of the strawberries overpowers any heat the jalapenos have even with keeping the seeds.  The second batch I used a little more jalapeno and it still wasn't quite hot enough.  I think I may throw one or two habanero peppers in the next batch (finally a use for those hot peppers!)  This is a very good recipe and I like that I can substitute other peppers or mix peppers in order to get the exact taste I desire and still have a pretty jam that sets up well.  Great for gifts too!

This will be the second year that I have made this recipe exactly as detailed.  I did double it this year so that I would have enough to give as gifts.  I used about 3/4 of the seeds.  Even my father who hates hotly spiced food will eat this.

my first time making jam and I made a few mistakes (added sugar at same time as rest of ingredients to cook, didnt cook long enough, and forgot to bubble the jars). First try it didnt set, so after 24 hours I re-processed but added too much pectin and it turned out gummy. It was still delicious however and I will definitely make this again.

Delicious!
I find you can adjust the sugar to 6 cups if you prefer a little less sweet.
I would recommend more Jalapeño's or adding 1 Habanero pepper for extra spice!

This is very good jam.  Jalapenos have all different levels of heat and mine were hot.  I only seeded one and the jam is pretty hot but we like it that way.  Thanks for sharing.  I will definitely make this again.

First time jam maker... It was so easy, just sweet enough with a mild pepper after taste. I plan on putting this together with scone mix for a cute Xmas gift for friends. Highly recommend this recipe.

Loved it!  Made recipe with frozen strawberries (measured 4 cups thawed and mashed) and due to the store not having any fresh jalapeños, I used jarred.   Also, per others suggestion, I reduced the sugar to 6 cups.  I tasted before I  jarring and decided I wanted a bit more heat (the jarred peppers are so much milder), so I added a little cayenne powder.  I got 7 half pint jars (prob would have gotten more, but I kept tasting!)

Really, really good!  Can't wait to try it with cream cheese and crackers. I will definitely give this as gifts. I used frozen berries and fresh jalapenos and it was not too hot even for kids. Great side for omelets! As for the fruit pectin, I used one box (1.75oz) plus 1 Tbsp of a second box and the consistency is just right for the jam.

We love it over cream cheese with some tortilla chips.  We suggest cranking the heat up a little bit more.

This is a GREAT recipe!!  I made many of them and gave out as Christmas gifts!  It's a great touch to grilled pork or chicken.  I even have a friend that ate it with crab.  I took it to a party and serve it over a block of cream cheese with Wheat Thins.  SUPER YUMMY!!!

LOVE THIS!! This was my first attempt at canning  and this was exactly what I wanted to make. Everyone who has tried it has loved it as well. Sounds strange but try this on a bagel toasted with cream cheese. Delicious!

I made this tonight, I yielded more than the recipe said, and after I veined and seeded jalapenos I put them in the food processor.  Everything set up well and taste great.  Easiest recipe ever.  Thanks

Nope.  Not a recipe for me.  Sorry.  I've never had strawberries and jalapenos together, but now that I have, I will never do it again.  I was reluctant to add one entire cup of jalapenos, but one rater said follow the recipe exactly, so I did.  To me, the jam tastes like jalapenos.  I used fresh jalapenos, and the jam definitely has a bite to it (which isn't objectionable and adds an aura of excitement).  But I don't like the taste.  I did not add the seeds.  The jam did set up nicely without pectin (which is probably due to the 7 cups of white sugar.)  But the flavor is way too much jalapeno.  I like jam sweet and not green tasting.  Jalapenos taste green to me.  Unless you really like the flavor of jalapenos, I would recommend you add about 1/4 of the jalapenos and make a half recipe the first time to see if you like jalapenos in jam.  I ended up with two extra 1/2 pints of jam without pints (counted wrong), so when I got the jars boiled, I had two half pints left to put in jars.  With that, I decided to try to salvage the jam, so I added about 1 cup of blackberry jam I'd made to the 2-3 cups of this jam.  I'm intrigued by this combination, and the little bit that I had was tastier, eliminated a bit of the "green" taste and gave a bite to the jam.  If I were to do this again, I would add blackberries--half strawberries and half blackberries to start, and add 1/4 to 1/2 of the jalapenos.  Hubby still didn't like it w/blackberries added--"tastes like the peppers."
