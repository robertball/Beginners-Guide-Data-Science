WOW! These are the best crackers bar none! They have a very cheesy flavor, the ground toasted pecans along with the cayenne kick the flavor up a notch.Because of the stiffness of the mix, I prepare a half batch at a time, otherwise it kills your hands and arms trying to knead the mix. My friends love the little cheese crackers and buy them by the truckloads. I had them over for a little cocktail do, and surprised them with these crackers. They raved about these so much that I finally had to take them into the kitchen and make up some logs to send home with them.I put 1/2t of garlic powder and I used Extra Sharp Premium Label Tillamook Cheddar cheese. I ground my pecans so the dough wouldn't pull apart when cutting. I cut them 1/8th inch thick and baked them for 15 minutes for a crispy crunchy texture. I did a batch 1/4 in and baked for 12 minutes. When they cooled they crushed in your mouth rather than exploding with crispiness.You decide what texture you want then cut and bake accordingly.I can't say enough wonderful things about these crackers. I might be inclined to leave out the extra salt because the Cheddar is very salty and the cayenne adds to the feeling of saltiness. These are great! Thanks so much for sharing!

Very cheesy and they melt in your mouth.  I didn't use cayenne as I tried it in another recipie and it was too hot.  I just used a dash of garlic powder and these came out great.  I only made a 1/2 recipie and ended up with 8 logs so it is a lot.  I would quarter the recipie next time.

These were good.  Had the consistency of a cookie.  Very crumbly.  I think it would be difficult to dip these or spread something on them as they would break up very easily.  By the way, if you make a half recipe you can put these in the food processor and it makes very easy work of this recipe.  Wouldn't try it with a full recipe (okay I did) but my big cuisinart couldn't take it.

these are amazing, I've made them countless times now, with cheddar and pecans as well as blue cheese and walnuts and they always go over amazingly. the dough also freezes extremely well... my only piece of advice is to use a pastry cutter when blending everything together. Well done!

I was looking for a non-sweet holiday treat to include in my gift box with cookies and these little crackers were just the thing.  I followed the recipe exactly, only adding a dash of garlic powder like others had suggested.  If you have a dough hook on your blender, I recommend using it - then you don't have to knead at all.  Also, make sure you use a SHARP cheddar. I think this recipe is great, and I will try this again with other cheeses and nuts (I'm thinking asiago with pine nuts and blue cheese with walnuts.).  Yum!

I made these today and they were a total flop with my family.  They were BLAND.  Did I do something wrong?  I'm anxious to see what others say.  They were very easy to make, although my wrists will probably be sore tomorrow from all the kneading :-).  I'd like to know what I can do to spice these up.

Over the years I have used a similar recipe using McLaren's Cheddar cheese; it is the one that comes in a round red container with a black cover..a very sharp cheddar cheese that add so very much more flavour to this style of wafer recipe...give it a try..it is really great.

I actually think that the original recipe calls for a little too much butter. When I bake these, I actually can taste the butter in them, and I do not think that is good.

These are a delicious riff on regular cheese wafers.  The addition of the pecans makes them a little sweeter, which is nice.

It is VERY important to use the best quality cheddar that you can find.  Buy the block and grate it yourself.  Trust me-- you will realize the difference.

i love this recipe. i work at a restaurant and i get request for cheese straws often but these are so much better. i added 1/4 tsp garlic and 1/4 tsp dried mustard. i also divided the recipe in half since it made so much at once. i used salted butter so i did not add the salt that was called for. i am sure i will use this recipe often.

I tried this recipe as written and it was awesome - for a cheese straw-   with the name "wafer",  I expected more of a cracker texture.     My son loves them.

This recipe should be a HALF pound of butter and one pound of cheese. You can find this recipe on other web sites and they all say half pound (2 sticks).

While these are moderately tasty, they hardly qualify as "low carb" (which is where I found the recipe... my roommate begged me to make them after reading the recipe, but really? 4.2 grams of carbs PER cookie when the recipe makes dozens and dozens? No one is going to eat just 1, and 2-3 could spell the end of ketosis for someone with low tolerance.

These are most delicious!  I made them last year and came looking for the recipe again this year.  I did freeze some logs and they were still great in February for a party then.  Make small logs so you can just pop one wafer in your mouth, as they are very tender and may create many crumbs if too big and one has to bite them, also if small logs you will have many many lovely wafers.  Do warn folks, as they will think they are cookies and you wouldn't want to surprise them too much.  Yes, they do taste like butter, but I do not find any problem with that.

Made these precisely to recipe, and they do come out quite bland.  Nothing really jumps out at you but I will say, despite their short comings, for some reason they are addicting.  I probably wouldn't make these again but I do enjoy the batch I have made.

Addictive! I did scale it to 27 servings, and still have leftovers from my party. I used a fairly good quality cheddar that I finely grated. For the pecans, I used the basic recipe off this site (melted butter and salt on the pecans in the oven for a bit), then pulsed them a few times in the food processor. Easier than I expected, I think I want to try this without the pecans so my allergic boyfriend can try them.

Very tasty snack! and addictive. once you make one you'll continue making them. as one of the other reviewers suggested i used only half of the ingredients and mixed the dough in a food processor. this eased the prep but the result is more crumbly like cracker. this is ok. for more textured effect, would stick to the original recipe or add the cheese at the end after blending the rest of the ingredients in the food processor, and knead the dough by hand.

I didn't like these at all.  I followed the recipe to a T.   The dough was so buttery I could hardly work with it.  Then after they were baked, they just crumbled in my hands when I tried to eat one. They totally just fell apart. The taste was way too buttery.

Fabulous! I'm so glad I halved the recipe as it makes a lot! This had a mild taste so if you like more zing, add a bit more pepper. Those that rated this poor... use quality unsalted butter and quality cheese. You too will then fall in love with this recipe.

I was looking for this type of wafer for a last minute snack.  Had all the ingredients and it came together easily and quickly.  Didn't have 3 hours for them to sit in refrigerator so I stuck them in the freezer for 1 hour.  Came out perfect. I also halved the recipe and added 1/4 tsp dried mustard and 1/4 tsp. garlic like another reviewer.  Will definitely make these again!

I've made these so many times that I can   make them without even looking at the recipe.  So easy, wonderful flavor and the crispness all make these the best wafers ever.  I give them as gifts  and have requests for them all the time.  The only change I've made has been to cut the cayenne pepper quite a bit.
