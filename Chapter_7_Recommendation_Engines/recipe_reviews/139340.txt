Great recipe.  I say this because this is pretty much the same way I make them.
I have grown up in MD and it kills me when people say they have a recipe for a "true MD crab cake" and it has bread, green peppers.... blah blah blah.
No... that is NOT Maryland!
Best things to remember to anyone reading this... Use FRESH, LUMP, MARYLAND BLUE CRAB, STEAMED.  If you don't have access to freshly steamed, then buy the FRESH BLUE CRAB in the plastic containers.  NOT PASTURIZED in the can!  Use only a SMALL amt of bread crumbs and NEVER... I mean NEVER press and "smoosh" together to make a "patty".  FOLD crab LIGHTLY AND GENTLY to combine with other ingredients then form into an "airy", "half-sphere" type form.  And "baking" is a must.  Forget FRY!  Also, Definitely chill in the refrigerator AT LEAST 1/2 hour prior to trying to bake them.  It REALLY makes a difference when it comes to holding together.  I do use REAL EGG.  Also... never make a FLAT crab cake.  They should be large, rounded and fluffy!  Keeping this in mind... This recipe won't give you 12 cakes!
Though using certain ingredients such as real butter and real mayonnaise may make them "less healthy"... it DOES make a difference in the taste.  Oh... and NEVER use real mustard.... it has to be the powdered mustard!
Good luck and enjoy!

These Crab Cakes were very good and very easy to make! I did have to make a few changes only out of necessity.  I didnâ€™t have any baking powder so I omitted it.  I also did not have mustard powder so I just used regular mustard.  Even with the changes it was absolutely delicious!

I made these last night and followed the recipe to a T and the flavor was perfect, however they were a little dry and I think the cook time may be too long because they were a little tough on the underside.  Maybe just 7-10 min on each side would be sufficient.  Next time I may use more mayo??? I did like them though and will try to make them again in the future with some small alterations.

Finally a recipe for Maryland Crab Cakes made like we do it in most homes in Maryland.  Most important things in a real Maryland Crab Cake - no filler - Old Bay and just jumbo lump crabmeat (being careful not to break it up when mixing).  Has just the right amount of seasoning to add to the taste of the crab and not over whelm it. Thanks for setting the record straight.

Very good crab cakes.  I liked that they were baked.. felt healthier than frying them.  I put them on a cookie sheet with foil, and sprayed some butter flavored cooking spray on it and put them on top.  I didn't add enough egg because they were falling apart a lot.. I only added one egg (cause I didn't have any egg substitute).  So next time I'll use another half of an egg or a second egg.  I also used mustard instead of mustard powder because I didn't have that.  Next time I will also try other reviewer's suggestions on refrigerating the cakes for a half hour before baking them to help them hold their shape.  I also baked them for 10 minutes on each side.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were fantastic!  I was looking for just this type of recipe to bake instead of fry.  The only thing I did differently was to chill the cakes for a couple of hours before baking.  Soooo good!

I wanted to give 5 stars but my mixture was too watery.  Other than that it was delicious.  My fiance is from the Chesapeake Bay area in Virginia and he said this was equal to, if not better than, what he remembers from that area.  To solve the liquid issue I will make sure the crabmeat is completed drained and I will use 1/2 cup of egg substitute.  Thank you for your recipe and for helping my fiance have a wonderful Valentine's Day.

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars because this is the first recipe for crab cakes I've found that is baked. Who doesn't love the flavor of a pan fried cake? But the calories and fat make it a meal that I just can't feel good about making for dinner.  This is a great compromise.  The crabcakes are tasty (you can spice them up if you like) and I felt as if I wasn't compromising for a lo-fat dinner.  I made a simple buttermilk dill sauce which the kids loved on top, so overall this was a winner.   Here are the revisions I made and the dill sauce recipe... I split the egg between two regular eggs and 1/4 cup egg beaters.  You really do need a binding agent.  I doubled the bread crumbs just so that it would stay together better. I chilled the mixture in a bowl and then used an ice cream scoop to put on the baking sheet.  I think the time in the fridge helps the breadcrumbs expand and the whole mixture thicken enough to stay together. Also, watch the time, it could easily get dried out.  I probably did 12 minutes one side and mabe 8 the other side. That's all the change I made.  They were good but I might add some more spices next time.  As for the buttermilk Dill sauce: 1 cup mayonnaise  1/4 cup buttermilk  1 tsp. dried dill  1.5 tsp. dried parsley leaves  2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice  1 garlic clove, minced,  add some lemon zest if you have it  I'll add this to my recipe box and anytime crab meat is on sale it will be on my table!

These were fantastic!  I have tried crabcakes before and had almost given up on trying to cook them.  I followed the recipe ingredients exactly with the exception of adding 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper. As for cooking, I baked them only until the outside of them was semi-solid (about five minutes). After that I sauteed them in olive oil over medium heat on the stovetop for about two minutes (or less) each side. I  realize this way of cooking takes away from the "baked" in the name of this recipe.

Thank you SO MUCH for this recipe!  Although I love crab cakes, this was the first time I actually tried to make them for myself.  When I was searching for a recipe, one thing I knew that I definitely did NOT want to end up with were "doughy" crab cakes, which I really hate.  So, that is why this recipe caught my attention, in addition to baking vs. frying.  With the exception of some VERY helpful tips posted by "LynsieC" on 7/19/2007, I followed the recipe as it was written; and not only did they come out PERFECT, I have to admit that they are probably the best I have ever had (outside of the Maryland harbor when visiting family, of course!)  The exceptions that I made were (based on Lynsie's tips):  (1) I did use real egg (I used 2); (2) I did make them larger, and more round and fluffy (hence, much less than 12 crab cakes, as she noted, which was actually perfect, because they were for "dinner"); and I did refrigerate them for 1/2 hour before baking.  I was also very careful to "fold" the crab gently when combining it with the other ingredients, so that the crab meat would not break up (as suggested).  Additionally, the larger crab cakes will require that you increase your cooking time a bit; so you should keep that in mind.  They were DELISH!  And I am SO excited to FINALLY have a crab cake recipe that I can call my "own"!  :-)

Perfect, perfect, perfect!

These were so delicious, even my four year old loved them. They were not too spicy; I used a convection oven and they came out perfectly moist and firm.
Thank you so much for this great recipe!

AWESOME!! Finally a Crab Cake recipe that does not hide the crab. Everyone loved it!Expensive, but well worth it. I followed the recipe for the most part, except I used 2 eggs, 1-tsp. Old Bay, 1-1/2 lb. Wild Lump Crab Meat (in the container from Whole Foods) I also, like some reveiwers, used a ice cream scoop to form the cakes. I baked it for 20 mins. I forgot to put it in the refrigerator for the 20 + mins. as suggested by other reviewers, but thank goodness they kept its form and did not break apart, however I will refrigerate next time around. It was moist inside and a nice golden crust outside. For those who experience this recipe to be to salty, use only 1 tsp Old Bay, you may even get away with not adding the Old Bay, Crab Meat has it's own natural salt. This is a must for entertaining guests and on special occassions. It's a five star restaurant recipe. It cost me 45.00 to make 12 crab cakes. Thank you for sharing it.

Wow, this is a great recipe!   I'm not originally from Maryland, but have lived here for 28 years and have developed a keen appreciation for a good crab cake.  These are really, really good.   I followed the recipe exactly using Panko break crumbs, and I wouldn't change a thing...except for the implied size and "turning them over" aspect of the instructions.    I made them large and dome-shaped, and did not flip them.   I got five reasonably-sized cakes from this recipe, and my native Maryland guest LOVED them!

I too am from the Chesapeake Bay area and your recipe was similar to G&M's crabcakes.  I put a twist on it.  All you need do is mix 3 T Hellman's Mayonnaise with 1 to 2 T finely minced green or red pepper, 1/4 t dry mustard, 2 1/4 t French's mustard, 2 t Old Bay or to your liking, a dash of worcestshire and one beaten egg or 1/4 c of cholesterol-free egg product.  Pour mixture over large lump crab meat and gently fold til incorporated.  Place rack 2nd step down from broiling element, heat oven to broil and place crab cakes (5) on pan brushed with olive oil.  Broil 10 minutes and Viola`, best crab cake you ever had.  Took 1st place in a crab cake cookoff last year.  The 1 T of red pepper which added color made all the difference in the world.  Try it.

I'm a lifelong Marylander, and my husband and I love crab dishes so much that our wedding theme was "Love, Honor & Old Bay" (with engraved crab mallets as favors). So I was really happy to finally find a crabcake recipe on the site that tastes just like the best local restaurant crabcakes. This one does! I did use two whole eggs (instead of the egg substitute) and more Old Bay (at least 1 T, and more sprinkled on top) than the recipe calls for. Also -- for real MD crabcake style, try broiling them (about 10 minutes each side, depending on thickness) instead of baking them. But in general, this recipe was spot on, and I will be making it all summer with fresh local blue crab. Thanks!

Excellent Recipe! DH came home with Lump Claw Meat due to the cost ($21.00/pd vs 11.99/lb) and these still tasted fantastic. Used 2 eggs in place of the egg substitute and also lightly breaded with Panko before baking. Topped with a quick Lemon Aioli. I will reduce the Old Bay a little next time due to the salt but there were no complaints and many compliments. Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe. I only gave it four stars because I altered the recipe just a bit. I used real eggs instead of a "substitute" (figured if I'm using mayo and butter why not use real eggs). They came out really well. I took some other reviewers advice and refrigerated them for about 1 1/2 hours. Thank you T. Kent!!!

I am from Bowie Maryland and this crab cake recipe is extraordinary, except only use approximately 1/2 teaspoon Old Bay Seasoning or crab seasoning.  Otherwise, your crab cakes will be too salty!  Good luck.

Ok I have lived in MD for over 15 years now and have always used the Old Bay recipe or the recipe on the container of crab.  This recipe is AWESOME and totally blows those recipes away.  Not so much filler and just enough seasoning.  This tastes just like the crab cakes at certain restuarants that are famous for their crab cakes (and costs so much less and I know what's in them!!).   I am to a point now where I just don't even bother ordering crab cakes outside of MD - they just aren't the same!!  If you are looking for real Maryland crab cakes, look no further (and splurge for the jumbo lump crab - definitely worth it)!

This is a wonderful recipe!! I, too, am from the Eastern Shore of Maryland and I am trying to eat better so I searched for a baked recipe -- this recipe is great and it is almost just like the one I grew up with.  I had two small changes -- 1.  I used Saltines instead of bread crumbs --  just because my grandmother used these and it is easier to use saltines :). 2. I used a whole egg instead of egg substitute -- just because I don't have any egg substitute.  

I think the flavor of the crab meat comes out better when baked than fried -- and it's a whole lot better for you when it is baked.  This is my new recipe for crab cakes.

There were hands down the best I have had and made...I've tried other recipes and they were much too wet and or much too salty with a pungent mustard taste. The only thing I did because I wasn't ready to use them right away was placed them in the refrigerator for 30 minutes for them to firm up.

This were so tasty for being baked!  I used imitation crab and will not remove stars for that, however, they are probably even better with real crab.  The consistency of imitation crab made clumping a little more difficult- but they did hold together.  I put mix in the fridge for a few hours before cooking and that may have helped.

Very easy and very tasty!  I omitted the mustard and I used two real eggs with a 1/4 cup of half and half to simulate the egg beaters.  In a word... delicious!  Thanks for a great recipe; will definately make again and again!

Excellent!!!!!!!!!! I did not change a thing other than putting in the frig for several hours and did not flip during baking. Absolutely delicious crab cakes! Hate when people review the recipe, but basically change everything. Please just review the recipe as is with MINOR alterations, otherwise donâ€™t bother reviewing.

I have never rated a recipe before.  Nor have I made crab cakes until tonight.  Awesome!!! My husband took his first bite, then said "do you remember those crab cakes we had up on Chincoteague 100 years ago? Those were my favorite crab cakes... until tonight".  From my husband - this is HUGE!  ;)  I used Jumbo Lump Crab and 2 fresh eggs from the hen house (no stinkin' egg substitutes in this house!) ;) and added a very small amount of finely diced red pepper just for color. I used Panko bread crumbs and had to add a bit more due to the amount of moisture - but only a very small amount.  Chilled the crab in the fridge for an hour and then used an ice cream scoop to form loose balls/lumps.  I elected to broil the cakes on the second shelf down from the heating element; five minutes then turned the cookie sheet around and broiled for another two minutes.  LOVE THESE CRAB CAKES!!

I wanted so bad to think that this recipe was  going to be "the" crab cake recipe but it fell short.  The flavor was so-so and the cake itself was dry.

Thanks for this recipe.  I made the recipe once w/o the Old Bay and it was OK. But thanks to 'LynsieC' for her review about the 'Maryland" style crab cake because this made me realize that is not what I want.  But I came back and used this recipe as a guide and made changes-so if you're still interested keep reading:  omitted breadcrumbs because I eat towards a no-lo carb (diet) and higher quality fat.  Added 3 tbsp coconut flour.  Didn't have Old Bay so I searched for the ingredients list and used every spice in my cupboard that I had.  Of the Old Bay list I didn't have cardamom or ground bay leaf and omitted celery salt and flakes because I sauted celery, onion and green pepper to add to recipe. Added dash of thyme. (All 3 veggies amounted to approx a cup) While sauteeing I added 2 bay leafs and removed before incorporating into meat.  I went with two eggs. 
I tried the muffin pan method and tho not disasterous, I will not try again because they stuck a bit.  I made 8 thick cakes with a pound of canned pasteurized crab.  I salted 'by eye'.  My crab cakes were amazing with the right amount of heat and I will never change this recipe.  I tried the Aioli suggested and tho too mayonazy it went well w the cakes.  I will be looking for a diff. recipe on that sauce.
As with many recipes -if you're not a regular cook-don't expect great results.  People who cook a lot have methods and techniques you almost can't put on paper.  Here for example-my Old Bay substitute.

This would have been a five star review, however, this was my first time working with lump crab meat, and I had no idea you had to drain it and pick through it for shells. Therefore, they were a little wet. Overall though, the flavor was great. I only baked them 20 minutes total and didn't turn them since they weren't holding together. Also, I used 2 beaten whole eggs instead of egg substitute.

Delicious - I followed the recipe except used Best life spread and whole eggs (3 for 3/4 cups)  Make sure you spray the cookie sheet good of they will stick.  My husband hates crab cakes because they often have too much filler - This was a winner with him!  This recipe only made 7 cakes if they are a good size (more of mounds than flat patties)

After trying crab cakes, for the first time in my life in 2008, at G & M Restaurant in Linthicum Heights, MD, nothing else I've tried has come close. I guess that's what happens when you try the very best version of something first! This recipe comes closer to that genuine Maryland flavor than anything I have found. I have made these a handful of times, inculding a version for crabcake slider sandwiches for a party, and they always turn out good. The key is to precisely measure ingredients, make sure your oven is set correctly, and chill in the freezer while the oven preheats. I usually do a bake/broil combo on these, and I form mine into loosely packed baseball sized ball, and DONT flatten or turn while cooking.
I just spent the better part of an hour trying to find this recipe again, because I lost the printed copy I had, and stupidly didn't save it on here! Thanks for the great recipe!( Oh, and it will make a difference if you use margarine instead of real butter.)

Okay.  The best part of this recipe is baking the crab cakes -- I've had crab crumb cakes when I've used recipes that fry.  However, not sure I am sold on this recipe, part of the reason maybe that I ended up using seasoned bread crumbs [I would not do that again, way too many (competing) spices when you factor in the recipe's spices too.]  But, there are many people here who've enjoyed this recipe, so try it.  The other change I made was cutting the cooking time, I did about 9 minutes per side.  I would may even go 7 minutes per side.    To your health . . .

This is delicious! Even though I had to substitute quite a bit because I need to go shopping, it was still yummy! Here is what I did just in case someone else wants to try replacing some things! 
Had no baking powder- left it out!
Had no parsley- left it out!
Had no butter (yeah I know!)- put in a bit of light cream and cream cheese
Had no worcestershire- put in a splash of soy sauce and about 1/8 cup of French dressing
Put in two eggs instead of egg substitute as others suggested
I lightly rolled the cakes in a few more crumbs just to give the outside a nice crisp

Everyone loved this, even the little ones! Will definitely put this in my "crab" rotation! Tum!

I almost ruined this by not paying attention to the directions and mixed the bread crumbs in with the eggs and other liquids - I had soupy crab cakes :) Not to worry, we rolled them in more breadcrumbs and they fried up just fine :) I used two beaten eggs, which was only about half a cup, and served with garlic aioli. I used a half cup measuring cup to make the cakes and got exactly 8.

Good recipe, nice flavor, and easy to prepare. I used past. crabmeat because fresh was not available. Will try with fresh next time. This is definitely better than the recipe on the side of the Old Bay can. Also the Old Bay Crab Cake Mix does not hold a candle to this one.

OMG!! Is there something wrong with me? These were not good....WAY too much egg product, spice, salt (from somewhere) and they were like little blobs!!  $15.00 worth of crab wasted!! If anyone else thought these were terrible please let me know! Maybe I did something wrong, but I don't think so...I followed the recipe (except I halved the seafood spice)!

The recipe is excellent.   I baked the crab cakes for 10 minutes and then broiled for six.  Be sure the melted butter is completely cooled before adding to egg product or you will have pieces of cooked egg in the mixture.  I will use less "Old Bay" next time though, as they were a tad too spicy for me.

Absolutely Wonderful! After moving away from the Eastern Shore, I was craving crab cakes and did not wat to pay to have them shipped and not be fresh. I used this recipe and followed everything but for the egg I cracked the egg and put everything in but the yolk. I can't wait to make these again on Valentine's Day. Definately make the time to refridgerate prior to baking. And if you have any leftovers, they are even better the next day. I did not get 12 cakes as I made mine more of a jumbo crab cake. Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe!

I'm a maryland girl, so I'm a tough judge of MD crab cakes.  That said, this was okay with some tweaking.  1) I used Panko crumbs  2) did not use butter 3) used 2 eggs instead of the substitute.  I added a little old style mustard in addition to the mustard powder.  They tasted okay but need something that I can't yet put my finger on.  The mix was also a little too moist (another reason why I needed extra crumbs) so I will be sure to drain the crab meat a little before adding it to the mix.

This was my first attempt at making crab cakes, and they turned out just great.  I made them this morning, and put them in the refrigerator for a few hours, which made forming them much easier.  The recipe made 10 cakes.  i followed the recipe completely, I was careful not to over bake them after turning them over, so they turned out moist, golden brown and delicious.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

These are absolutely excellent.  I've made these 4 times already and they get great reviews.  So easy to make.  I use 2 eggs instead of egg substitute.  Also I cut the old bay down to 1 tsp to reduce the saltiness.  I followed another user's recommendation and put the crab cakes in the refrigerator for 20 minutes before baking - and it really made a difference.  Love love love this recipe.

I have made thousands of crab cakes, fish cakes, shrimp and so on. This is a solid recipe. If it's to dry as one person mentioned, add more mayo or put a pat of butter on top of each one. I personally don't pay attention to the fat police or the egg police, Use real eggs. This recipe will work for many protein ingredients, salmon, mackerel, shrimp, crab, lobster, and many more. :-) PS. for a little more festive color sprinkle the top with a little paprika.

Well this became an instant favorite with my husband. All her tips seemed to be what made them come out so delicious, chill, don't form into flat cakes, keep loose and light. The flavor was just wonderful, Thank You for sharing this recipe !!!! P.S. I wouldn't change a single thing about this recipe, you'll destroy it !!!!

I love this recipe! It is very similar to the one on the 40 year old box of Old Bay seasoning I brought with me when we moved to Washington State over 40 years ago. The newer bxes have a completely different recipe and ingredients. I have kept the box because when we first moved here, Old Bay had never been heard of out here, so my husband would buy me a can every time he went back to Baltimore. People were aghast that I would use Dungeness crab to make crab cakes[something else they had never heard of], but the minute they bit into them them kept their comments to themselves except to say "Oh, my gosh! I never tasted anything so good!" etc. Thank you I had made some today and I think the addition of butter might have helped the "lump" crab meat I used! Oh crab cakes are now sold every where out here at premium prices!

Easy and delicious. I made it a little lower in fat by using an eggless vegan mayonaise and replaced the butter with olive oil.  I also rolled them in panko before baking. These were very light, crispy and delicious.

4 1/2 stars I've lived in Southern Maryland for a year and never knew real crab cakes were baked, not fried. The only change I made was fresh bread crumbs, not dried. Other Maryland recipes called for broken up bread. The amount of Old Bay made this a tad salty. I might adjust that next time. The one downer for this recipe is that the house stank for 24 hours. Thanks for the recipe...this is a keeper.
July 8, 2015 I have found an answer to not stinking up the house! I used a grill pan with holes and "baked" it outside. I made sure the grill was around 375 and kept the lid closed between flipping. Yum.

You really should add saltines. You can crush crackers vey fine and they will act as a binder. I don't feel it's necessary to use lump. I like to use special or bust up the lump. You really need something to hold it together and the thing with crackers you won't know they are there. You could easily add things like celery or spinach or onions. We would take two pound of crab meat. Add two eggs, one pack of saltines, two ounces of mustard, two ounces of mayonnaise, one ounce Worchestershire, mix together. Make patties one inch thick brown 5 minutes on each side. We would make crab balls and if you have hot grease you can cook crab balls in five minutes.

I was excited to try this recipe after seeing keywords: "Baked", "lived by the Chesapeake Bay", then "egg whites", and "almost no filler". Made these for dinner tonight, following your footnotes (no need to tweak on my own) with egg whites, olive oil mayo and omitting the butter. I make at home a sodium-free Old Bay, leaving salt preference to the individual at the table. Mine came to under 45 calories each. My husband had no idea these were healthy until I described the difference in this and other recipes, including pan-frying. Other than the naturally high cholesterol in crab, my doctor would be really happy about this recipe. Thank you T Kent!

Awesome!! Swapped the green onions with diced yellow because they were on hand. I also used sriracha sauce for the hot and added some chopped red bell pepper for extra flavor and color! Cannot wait to make this one again!

These were delicious! I did use 1 whole egg instead of the egg substitute. Did not effect the dish. Next time I think I will cook them closer to 10 min on each side so they will turn out more moist.

Very, very yummy and easy to make. I only said 4 stars because I like mine a little less spicy, but I know most people like their old bay :)

Although I was born and raised in MD and still live in the Baltimore area, this recipe was my first attempt at making crab cakes on my own. After reading a few reviews, I chilled the mixture for about 2 hours, then shaped into baseball-sized cakes and baked for 15-20 minutes at 350 degrees F. I omitted the baking powder just because I didn't have any. They came out moist with just the right amount of crispness on the outside! My husband rarely comments on a meal, and after his first couple bites he stated "these are pretty good!". To get a comment like that from him, makes a recipe at least 4 stars in my book!

So, I wasn't a great fan of these.  I thought they were too dry and didn't have a lot of flavor.  With that being said... I do have to admit that this is the first time I have ever made crab cakes and I have only had crab cakes at really great restaurants for the last few years while living in Virginia.  I used canned crab meat and maybe that was the problem.  I also used whole eggs, I think it was 3 that made 3/4 cup.  Those were the only things I changed so I'm not sure if that was what made the difference or not.  Just not a fan..

Yummo!! I have never made a crab cake before and this was delicious, eventhough it was a little salty. The only changes I  made were Miracle Whip for the mayo, King crab for the lump crab and omitted the butter. Oh, I did have to add some extra breadcrumbs because it was a little wet, but not very much. I scaled it down to just make 2, so I didn't make my family the guinea pigs! Excellent recipe and will definitely make this again!! I forgot to say I took the advice of others and only cooked them for about 10 mins on each side!

So I know that many will be outraged to read that I did indeed make these with imitation crab. But the resulting product was super tasty. I took about a pound of the fake stuff and chopped it until it was fine, then followed the recipe accordingly. If anyone else is planning to use imitation, just remember that the cook time will be much less. About 15 min for the whole thing is what you need, and there's no need to flip the cakes half way.

I did not care for this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and it was so salty! I hate that I wasted a pound of jumbo lump crab meat on this recipe, esspecially when I cooked dinner for my husband for valentines day.  I think adding the Worcestershire was the worst idea ever.

I made this and as instructed by another reviewer, I dropped them from a tablespoon, making them quite loosely held together.  They turned out perfect. I baked them 10 minutes each side.  Thanks for the recipe and tips!

Wow!!!  I have never made my own crab cakes from scratch and I must say that these are incredible.  I did use 3 eggs instead of egg substitute.  I also chilled them for about 1 1/2 hours before baking.  These are a new and easy favorite.  Thank you for this delicious recipe!

Taste was good, but I prefer the cakes crispier.  Had a bit too much egg for our taste, and we do prefer the saltines to the breadcrumbs--or even better, coated with panko.  Thank you for the recipe, though.  It was fun to try.

I got jumbo lump crabmeat at a really good price, so I wanted to try this out.  I thought it was great, but I can't give my review much credibility because I was using the crabmeat out of the can, not fresh Maryland crab.  We live close to MD so I have had good crabcakes, and I liked that this one had little filler, and mostly crab.  I also did not have mustard powder so I had to use dijon - so I wouldnt call my creation a "true MD crabcake"  however, they were still reallly yummy.  Served with both cocktail and tartar sauce.

Exceptional crabcakes!  I have lived in Maryland my whole life and was looking for a crabcake recipe that was as good as what I have grown up eating.  I made them for my family for New Year's Eve treat.  This is definitely an authentic MD crabcake.  There are other MD crabcake recipes on here that don't even come close!  I didn't change much...I used fresh parsley istead of dried because I always do and I used real egg rather that substitute.  I used 3 large eggs for a double recipe.  I also made my cakes larger, yielding 10 good sized cakes from a double recipe.  Other than that I didn't and wouldn't change a thing, just the right amount of spice and flavor.  The jumbo lump crab meat is very expensive, but well worth it for a special occasion, these were worth every penny.  You would pay $15-20 for a crabcake this good here in MD.  Like I said, exceptional!

The only thing I found necessary was to increase the bread crumbs and that may well be because I used dried crumbs rather than fresh.  But I'd been looking for a baked crab cake recipe and this one is outstanding.  Husband loved them and I will be making them from now on.  Many thanks for sharing this recipe--a total winner!

This was the first time I ever made crab cakes and they went over so well that I will never try another recipe. One tip though, if you like nice sized crab cakes, you will not get 12 unless you double the recipe... but if you want to make 12 miniature teaser crab cakes and have your friends and family begging for more then keep it the way it is! :)

This is a very good crab cake recipe.  Don't leave out the Old Bay if you want a Maryland crab cake!  Tip to those who are novice crab cake makers -- don't try to form the crab cake like a meatball or a patty.  I start with a scoop of crab cake mixture, put on the greased baking sheet, and then lightly pat/form a thicker cake (note the thickness in the picture with this recipe).  Some cooks recommend to chill your crab cake mixture a few minutes before shaping.

These were very good.  I made the recipe just as it said and refrigerated the mix for at least an hour before making them into patties.  I used a measuring cup to scoop them into 4 large crab cakes.  It took longer to bake and it did make them hard to turn over for the remaining baking time (meaning they wanted to fall apart), but I didn't want to press them together too much.  Thank you for the recipe!

One of the best crab cake recipes I've made. I substituted with 2 real eggs. I also wanted to make something with leftover mahi mahi and substiuding the fish for carb was awesome. Would highly recommend using with any sweet white fish foe a new spin on leftovers. Will plan to make with crab as well.

This recipe was wonderful and my entire family loved it.  We try to eat low carb & fat and I made a few minor changes...used whole wheat breadcrumbs, low fat mayonnaise and organic egg whites.   The recipe was a little moist even with me cutting the egg whites to 1/2 cup but they came kept their form and weren't loose at all after baking.   We will definitely be making these again.

This recipe was delicious.  The texture of the crab cakes was just right, and they were golden brown on both sides.   I used a freshly homemade Old Bay seasoning recipe, and it did overpower the crab flavor a little bit.  I would recommend cutting it down to 1 teaspoon if using homemade Old Bay.  I also used one egg instead of the egg substitute.  I sprayed the pan and the tops of the cakes with olive oil before cooking, and once again after turning.

For those who have trouble finding Old Bay, look in the fresh seafood section of your grocery store.  It is often found there instead of in the spice aisle.  All of the markets near me carry Old Bay.  `

Just barely acceptable; too much egg made this a bit rubbery and egg-like; the flavors were just OK.  I didn't see this in the recipe, but the flavor was very much improved when served with lemon wedges.

I live in the Mid Atlantic area and allot of people boast about their crab cake recipes.  I will say this one you can say is pretty darn good.  I use this as my base recipe when I make crab cakes.  I get about 5, 4 inch round, 1 inch think cakes from one pound of lump crab meat.  The are very rich but so good.  thanks for the recipe.

Well, I have been looking for a baked crab cake recipe for some time and have found this. Thank you, T. I grew up on the bay (Fort Monroe) and still wake up on cool mornings here in Carolina and dream of the salty yet sweet breeze that became part of me so long ago.  Good luck with feeding the twins - my daughter now 34 was just sharing with me news of her first "professional" job.  May your and your sweetie's raising but as delightful as ours!

GREAT...the only thing I changed was to use Ritz cracker crumbs instead of bread crumbs.

I'm originally from Maryland and now live in Ohio and this recipe got rave reviews.  Thanks so much for sharing!

I'll start out by saying that I have never had a genuine Maryland Crabcake so keep that in mind but these turned out awesome. I didn't use breadcrumbs, I used saltines, and I used an 8oz jar of lump and another of claw meat and one egg instead of the substitute but other than that I stuck to the recipe. My husband and I were so pleasantly surprised that we ended up eating all of them between the two of us. Thank you so much for a really easy and great tasting recipe.

Not enough Old Bay.  These were a little bland.  I grew up in Kent Island, too, and these are not as delicious as others claim!

Yep-that's it-that's the one-the real deal -I live on the Eastern Shore of Maryland and we all tend to do the never ending search for the perfect Maryland Crab Cake-well-here it is.  The only changes I made were to use finely crushed Ritz crackers(LOW SALT)instead of the bread crumbs-I found the Ritz crackers do not absorb as much liquid as the breadcrumbs so the crabcakes are not dry and to use real eggs -Definately a keeper -love the end results.  Had 25 Eastern Shore Folks over and they were raving about them-Thanks for ending this search for me.

I have never made Crab Cakes before, but my fiance wanted it. I took a chance and made it and he said it was the best he has ever had, even better than ones at restaurants. It was easy to make and I will definitely make it again.

My only complaint is that the old bay made it a little too "salty" for my taste. I will definitely make these again (with half the amt of old bay)! Delicious and definitley authentic Maryland Crab Cakes!

This recipe was easy and good! A little salty, next time I will use low sodium Worchestshire and unsalted butter, to reduce the salt. I think this crab cake combined with a nice sauce would be amazing!

Was a hit. I cut down the bay season a bit. At first I thought they would be too wet to turn but put in for an extra min and carefully turned them. Will make these again ;)

I live in Baltimore and believe me, we *know* our crab cakes. This recipe was great! I prefer the baked to fried, personally, though I'll eat either. My DH, who is much more picky, loved these as well. I subbed in FF Mayo and margarine to lessen some of the fat and make it a little more friendly to my current diet, but other than that the recipe was perfect.

This is a very good recipe.  I recently began a fat reduced eating program because my cholesterol was registering a  little high.  I started looking for healthier non meat recipes and found this one.   I really  liked it because the crab cakes are baked and not very much fat.  I didn't change a thing...very tasty.

The flavor is really good.  Like another reviewer, I used 1 real egg because I didn't have an egg substitute.  I skipped the chilling step that others suggested, and mine still held up pretty well. Also, like another reviewer mentioned, this only made 6 regular sized crab cakes.  I think if I had shaped mine into smaller and flatter cakes I could've gotten 12.  With my convection oven it took a little bit longer to look cooked (15-20 min).  I also broiled the tops a little.  But, overall, very yummy and beats the recipe on the side of the Old Bay can!

Delicious!  In the interest of honesty, I followed recipe almost to the letter, however, due to ingredients I had on hand, I did replace the bread crumbs with the exact same measure of panko crumbs and replaced the egg substitute with one whole egg.  These are fabulous!!!

Simply perfect, wonderful flavor - the only thing I would do different next time is not to cook longer than 20 minutes total (10 on each side) to keep them moist. It's nice to find a great tasting BAKED crab cake recipe. Excellent recipe, I'm so glad you shared this!

Great taste even with frozen shredded crab meat (In the middle of Germany there is no chance of fresh crab meat, it is frozen or canned. I had to go to an Asian store to find any crab meat at all... even the fish market did not have it!).  I will make these again. Thank you to everyone for all your helpful comments that made my crab cakes so successful!  I did make a lot of changes, hence the 4 stars instead of 5. I added spring onions like it recommends in the My Crab Cake recipe, used fresh parsley and mustard instead of dry, used Ritz crackers in the mix instead of bread crumbs, coated the crab cakes with bread crumbs after forming into patties, refrigerated patties for 1 hour before cooking, fried them in a pan with olive oil until brown on each side then put the entire pan in the oven at 350Â°F (170Â°C) for 10 minutes afterwards (my crab cakes were very moist due to the frozen crab retaining so much water and the normal mustard I used, so 10 minutes may be too long for your mixture).

Made these for a family party, I needed a double batch, so I decided to make one batch with fresh lump crab meat and 1 batch with the can crab meat, no one could taste the differeance between the 2 batchs, they both turned out excellant. I replaced 2 eggs for the substitute and they came out perfect

These were OK but I have to be honest I didnt love them. I dont know why..I think they were a little bland. I browned them in a pan a bit before baking (the mixture was very wet) and I just wasnt thrilled. I will try them again another time to see if they taste different in another batch. I think they just needed something like celery or red pepper, something crunchy..I added a little lemon juice and made a tartar sauce for the side

Just made the healthy version with egg whites and no butter. I'll give four stars for the taste of it outright, and one extra star for getting close enough to a more sinful version. Only change I'd make is using a little less Old Bay - a teaspoon is probably plenty so it doesn't overpower it.

Made these for a few friends and they were a hit.  I followed the recipe as it is written.  I may add cayenne for a little flair next time.

4 stars, not because it wasn't great - it was - five stars is for perfect - A little too salty - I'd cut back on the Old Bay a tad and maybe the mustard. I loved that it was oven baked .  Thanks for the recipe I'd make it again small changes! Edit:
I made this again and I did cut back both the Old Bay and the mustard seasoning by 1/2. Refrigerated for 2 1/2 hours after lightly dusting with flour and cooked on the grill using indirect heat - this is my go to crab cake recipe for now on! Thank you soo much for this recipe!

This recipe was awesome! The only modification I made was to add about two teaspoons of garlic powder to the dry mix. This recipe was absolutely all crab and less filler. Just be careful not to overcook.

I loved it. And yes, this tastes like an authentic "Maryland" crab cake (no onions or peppers, just lump crab meat).   I only wish it were a little more moist.

I mostly followed the recipe, but would say it worked out quite nicely.  I started with 5 fresh rock crabs I caught myself at Berkeley Pier.  After boiling and cleaning the crabs my crab meat was pretty moist to start with.  I used fresh dill and fresh parsley instead of dried added some finely diced red onion, and I used a combo of parmesian cheese and bread crumbs.  I used way more than 1/4 cup, closer to 3/4 cup since the crab meat was so moist in order to get the right texture.  They turned out great, I will be crabbing all summer and will tweak it some as I continue to make this again and again.

Very very good. It seems a bit more healthy than a lot of recipes out there; you can tell it's not as heavy compared to what you might get at a restaurant.

10+ Stars! I'm so excited to find a recipe that is not fried! I will be more likely to make crab cakes at home now that I know that I can do it without using oil. I will add another 2 Tb. of bread crumbs next time (I used Panko) add some lemon juice and maybe cut down on the old bay a little since it seemed to overwhelm the crab flavor a little bit. My hubby also sauteed 1/4 cup of onion with minced garlic in a skillet to add to the mix and I'll definitely do this again next time! Also took other reviewers advice to chill for 30 - 45 minutes before baking. This made four giant patties, but next time it will be 5 or 6 patties so it cooks in the time allotted. We broiled it the last 5 minutes so the cakes would have crispy tops. Yummy!!

These turned out perfect. I used an ice cream scoop to portion these out and baked them on parchment paper. They browned perfect and held their shape. After scooping this out, I flattened with my hand so they were flattened equal. I used crab cake sauce on this site with the salsa in it for the sauce which was a nice compliment. This will be my regular crab cake recipe. I did use 3 eggs instead of the egg substitute also and it was the right consistency and baked them 12 minutes, then turned them and baked another 12 minutes. Perfect!

I follwed this recipe as written.  What I loved about these crab cakes is they were not fried and there was not a lot of filler so you really got the crab taste, the reason I am not giving it 5 stars is that we felt it was way to salty.  I will keep this has my crab cake receipe, but next time I will cut the old bay to 1 tsp, and add either 1/2 tsp to a 1 tsp of  cheyenne just for the kick that the old bay gave it.

Too Salty!!!
I reduced the amount for Old Bay Seasoning but it was still too salty for me. (I love spicy food though...)  
Also It was too dry after baking. 
Pan frying will be better method for this recipe.   
My guest said they loved it but I was not satisfied

These were great!   I absolutely LOVE that they are baked, not fried, and even though fried are pretty darn good you don't feel like you're missing out with this recipe and it's so much healthier.  And I know this is blasphemy to  anyone from the Chesapeake Bay area, but I did use imitation crab...if it's this good with imitation, you can bet I will try it with real crab next time!  I added a dash of tabasco, and this recipe made 6 large crab cakes (about the size of a burger).  Served over a salad with my own Garlic-Dijon Aoli.   Thanks for sharing your wonderful recipe!

5 star rest. quality!! Do not have to use expensive crab meat either!!!! I used (for 1/2 batch) 1 8 oz can Phillips crab (yes it is pasteurized) claw meat. They were B1G1F at Weis. I used 2 T panko bread crumbs, 1/2 t baking and mustard powder, 2 T fresh minced parsley, dash pepper, 1 t Old Bay, 1/2 T mayo, 1T butter, 1/2 t worsh sauce, 1 egg, fold gently together (combine bread crumbs mixture first, then egg and fold with crab. I made 2 large crab cakes, sit in fridge for 3 hours, sprayed both sides with non stick spray, baked 375 15 minutes each side, yummy...served with nice T bone steak, steamed brocc and brown rice A+++

great recipe. by far the best i have tried on this site but does not exceed the restaurants quality i have had. The trick is to use alll real ingredients (crab, mayo, butter, etc)I also added green onoins and little lemon juice. Always use a spatula to mix to avoid break ups. Do not be tempted to add more old bay seasoning like i was i cant stand bland food and added a little extra and was a little salty. I also used one large egg. I also broiled mine in the oven for about 10mins each side came out perfect.

Wonderful recipe.  This is the first time I have made crab cakes and this was great!!  One tip for mixing, use a spatula. It will reduce the breaking up of the crab.  I also used fresh parsley, which is always better than dried.  And, I agree with others, that you should not skimp on the quality of ingredients for this type of recipe.

A very good Maryland recipe!  Tastes like those I ate growing up on Maryland's Eastern Shore. I think using all soft butter and no mayo would be fine.  The use of baking soda was new to me and I may fry them next time, but they were still very good.
The key is both little filler and mild seasonings.  Strong seasonings (such as bell pepper) can cover up the mild, sweet flavor of good Blue Crab.

Expensive disaster!  May be my fault, as I made substitutions.  I used real mustard like another reviewer suggested, and I used 12 oz of canned crab instead of 16 oz. because the full amount of fresh crab would have been about $18!  I also used real eggs instead of substitute.  I measured an egg and found it to be 1/4 cup so I used three.  The cakes themselves looked fine and cooked fine, but they tasted like scrambled eggs with a hint of crab.  They were only edible when dunked in malt vinegar.  I'm sure this recipe would be good if you know what the heck you're doing.

I am so glad I finally decided to try this recipe! I followed the recipe for the most part except for a few modifications I got from reading reviews. I used 2 eggs instead of the egg product and I used less Old Bay. I also found the mix to be a bit moist so added more breadcrumbs and I also dipped both sides in breadcrumbs to give the cakes a crispy exterior. I refrigerated the crab cakes for 30 minutes before baking. The recipe says to make 12 cakes but I wanted mine a little bigger so I made 8 and baked a few minutes longer per side. They were delicious! And as a weight watchers points follower,they were only 2 points per cake!!!! thanks for an amazing recipe!!!

I am a Maryland girl too--and I know and LOVE crab cakes!  This recipe is great and just like the recipes from growing up outside of Baltimore.  I definitely used Phillips lump crab meat--it's the only way!  Breading was light and toasty and just enough to hold the meat together. I did omit the butter and then added a bit more Old Bay on top.  Love! Thanks LynsieC!

Loved this recipe!!!  Only made 1 slight change.  I didn't have any egg substitute on hand so I used 1-3/4 of beaten eggs.  I had to cook a little longer since I made 6 larger sized crab cakes instead of 12 smaller ones.  Will definitely be making these again!!!

My family liked the taste. I did alter ingredients and experienced problems with the cakes sticking to the pan when they came out of the oven. I will do this recipe again because it has a good taste.

This recipe was very easy to make. I did have to makes some minor spice substitutions but even with them they turned out great! I will make these again & try to use all your spices the next time. May even make them for Christmas Eve appetizers. Thank you this is the best recipe that I have tried for crab cakes.

FAR too watery to make a lump!  I wonder about the "3/4 cup egg product".... was she perhaps using POWDERED or dried eggs?  I got "Crab Soup" and would up making a "Crab Casserole" in a piecrust.   It was.....  unusual, but I'll be switched I throw out a pound of lump crab!

I followed the review #23 because it seemed more like a Maryland crab cake. I did not bake, but broiled. The first 5minutes I broiled on high then lower broiler during the last 5 minutes. Absolutely delicious!

It's a pretty good crab cake recipe. I'm near Baltimore & love a crab & kind of know a crab cake. Could've used alot more Old Bay in my opinion.

I made these for my boyfriend and his brother for dinner and they LOVED them! Due to the fact that these are baked, they stayed together perfectly, and there was just enough filler as to not take away from the crab taste. The only adjustment that I made after reading the other reviews was cooking these for 10 minutes on each side, and they were done perfectly. I would think that the cook time on here might make them a bit too crispy.

4 Stars because there was not a lot of filler and the crab flavor really came out.  Removed one Star because it was a little bland.  Needed more Old Bay or Salt or something that I can't put my finger on.  Definetly needs to be kept in refrigerator for at least 1 hour to help hold cake together while cooking.  Don't cook too long as it will dry out.  I will absolutely make again with a few tweaks.  It's a keeper.

I followed the recipe exactly and these were as close to the real deal as I've eaten in Maryland.  To get the real taste of a Maryland crab cake, the best lump crabmeat should be used. They were easy to make and a treat to eat.

Very good recipe!  So easy!  I tried to put them on tinfoil to have an easier cleanup, but they stuck, so I just greased a pan well and put them there after I flipped them.  Other than that, followed the recipe exactly and they were great!

Followed the recipe to the letter, a little too moist.I am originally from Maryland, these crab cakes are just like the ones I had growing up. The baking powder helped to keep them light and fluffy. Even my very picky sister loved these. Thanks for the recipe.

these were absolutely wonderful, I used egg whites instead of full egg product. The batter was a little runny, but who cares...the taste was phenomenal! Oh, I also cut down the cooking time to about 20 mins total....Wonderful job and thanks for posting the recipe

I made these last night. Purchased the Maryland Jumbo Blue Lump Crabmeat (expensive but soooo worth it). Followed the recipe pretty much exactly except I used 2T mayo and 2 jumbo eggs mixed with light cream (about 2T) rather than Egg Beaters. Refrigerated the cakes (8) for about 1 1/2 hours, then popped in oven. They were good but kinda bland..as if something was missing. Not sure what exactly they needed but they were delicious anyway. Prepared a remoulade for them and served with a salad and an excellent Sauvignon Blanc. Will definitely make these again but will add maybe some onion powder, celery and a touch more of Old Bay to spice 'em up some more. Thanks for the recipe!

Generally, my husband is not a crab cakes person, but he loved these.  The amount of fill and meat was just right so that we could still taste the meat.  I didn't have any specific seafood seasonings, so used Nature's Seasons - but only 1 tsp so it wouldn't have too much salt in it.  We will definitely make these again.

the flavor was good, but we found it to be dry.  I would suggest using a little less breadcrumbs.  Even though the mixture looks really wet.  And only bake it for 10 min on each side.

The were great and disappeared off the plate at my family Christmas.  Everyone raved and I couldn't believe how easy they were!  I used two real eggs and another egg white instead of the cholesterol free egg product.  This recipe is a keeper.  I will make for dinner again soon.

This was good.  Made it for dinner tonight.  Made 1/2 the recipe.  They were moist and I baked them on convection so they browned up nicely.  Next time, I may flash saute them and them finish in the oven.

Oh I also used Ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs.

I certainly did not get twelve from this recipe. They were good but a little to spicy for my taste.  If I make again would probably cut the old bay seasoning in half.

We did not like these at all. The flavoring was off.  May prefer crab cakes with diced onions and peppers, and a little "fat" for frying never hurts anything.  Unimpressed.

Really great recipe!  My only recommendation is to lessen the amount of seafood seasoning by half!  I used Maryland seafood seasoning and it was too salty based on the amount the recipe called for!  Otherwise this was great and very easy to follow!

I rarely follow a recipe to the letter but I did with this one.  Iâ€™m not from Maryland but Iâ€™m from Tangier Island, VA (where all of Marylandâ€™s crabs come from) and I know a good crab cake and am always looking to try a new recipe.  This one has great flavor and highlights the crab.  I would probably add a little more Mayo if I make it again though as it was a little dry for my personal preference.

Have made many times and is excellent.  The only thing I do differently is for the last 1-2 minutes, smear a little butter over the top of each cake and run under the broiler.  Browns and slightly crisps without losing any moisture.

This was the best recipe for Maryland-style crab cake I've ever come across!  I cut the recipe in half for my husband and myself.  For the "egg product", I just used 1 large egg (so use 2 if you're doing the full recipe).  Otherwise I made it exactly as-written.  It made 4 good sized cakes.  I can't wait to make these again! YUM!

The recipe flavor and texture is excellent.  I live in MD on the Chesapeake Bay and eating crab cakes is taken very seriously. :) The 4 stars is for the cooking instructions.  For 5 stars: use 2 eggs instead of egg product, I used panko bread crumbs, shape into half mounds as if scooping from an ice cream scoop. Bake for 15 minutes to an internal temperature of 155 degrees.  Do not flip.  These will be moist crab cakes.  The color is lightly golden.  MD crab cakes on the Chesapeake are never flipped. We had these as crab benedicts with hollandaise and the meal was delicious.

I live in Arizona and had a few challenges to make this recipe. I lived for many years in the tidewater area of Va. so loved crab cakes. 
Decided to try your recipe. Used crab meat from legs of Alaskan King crab as a substitute because I had these in my freezer and wanted to use while still good. 
The taste was not the same, I only had less than a lb. so tried to adjust recipe accordingly. Did not turn out very good. Was edible but too much seasoning. My bad hopefully not your recipe. Will not try again until I can get lump crab.

Easy to make and nice flavor.  But too much liquid.  It was more like a crab omelette than crab cake.  I will make this again but with less liquid and add some chives.

Excellent flavor.  Made a homemade tartar sauce to go with.  Used Panko bread crumbs and increased the amount to 1/2 cup and it worked perfectly.  They were done in 20 minutes, fork-tender and all-crab.  I will definitely make this again.

These were the best. Instead of baking, I pan fried in a little olive oil for about 4 mins per side.  I also used a real egg and gluten-free bread crumbs, and added sliced green onions. LOVED them.

This recipe was the best crab cakes I've made and much easier to prepare. I made a few changes, I used 2 eggs, omitted the baking powder, used cracker crumbs instead of bread crumbs, fresh parsley and added 1/2 tsp cayenne. I measured 1/2 c portions which made them uniform.

I am very picky about crab cakes and this is the best recipe I have ever found and it is so easy. I wont ever fry my crab cakes again.  I made this for Christmas for my family exactly as written, but based on many reviews that said they had a hard time with the cakes falling apart, I added more egg. I also used half regular bread crumbs and half panko and coated the cakes with extra panko. I did not refrigerate them before baking as many have suggested. They baked up crispy and golden brown on the outside and moist on the inside. They did not fall apart. The flavor was perfect...the old bay seasoning is a must and you must use good fresh lump crabmeat....never canned. My family loved them and I will definitely be making this again.

The flavor was very good, however, it was a bit watery and ran.  Reading other reviews about chilling it first may make a difference.  I will definitely try again and chill them.

This crab cake recipe is the real deal and LynsieC had some great advice.  My changes were very minor - used Panko breadcrumbs (because that's what I  had) and used two whole eggs.  I also baked at 375Â° for 10 minutes and broiled for 6 minutes- no flipping necessary. (I made three gigantic softball size cakes.) And I am a Maryland girl through and through.  Delicious!!

I just added 1 more tsp of old bay which equaled 1 TBSP TOTAL, and 1 extra TBSP of mayo. I mixed spices, egg and butter together in one bowl and mixed 3/4 pds crab and 2 tsp bread crumbs in another bowl to make sure It was evenly mixed before I added the crab mixture. I'm gluten intolerant so before adding bread crumbs to crab, I took out a 1/4 pd of meat and added 2 tsp oatmeal and 1/4 of  spice,egg and butter mixture to my crab for me. My house baby like bread. Bake 10 min each side.

Excellent recipe. I modified it a little...and it was great. I used 1/2 cup of butter crackers (pulsed) with 1/4 cup panko bread crumbs instead. I also used fresh Italian parsley chopped and added 1 tablespoon of minced onion. I had no mustard powder, so I used 1/2 tsp spicy brown mustard. I use 2 real eggs.  I rolled the crab cakes in some panko breadcrumbs before baking. And as another reviewer suggested I them baked it in a muffin pan. I like a crab cake that does not crumbled and these modifications did the trick. I served it with a Lime and garlic Aoili...wonderful. My family devoured it.

I made these last night for my husband's birthday, along with the black bean salsa and cucumber salad (both on this site) and fresh tomatoes. Awesome dinner - everyone loved it! I live on the Chesapeake Bay too and have made other crab cake recipes, but this one is far superior! I am going to make them again tonight - they were that good! Did not change or add a thing to the original recipe!

Made a few changes. Increased bread crumbs to 2/3 cup. Used one egg instead of 3/4 egg product. Removed butter and added about 1/2 T of olive oil. Squeezed some lemon juice in it. Made four large crab cakes instead of small ones. And, baked for 20 minutes. So good and not too bready!

I followed the recipe closely, just adding a frozen cube of fresh dill.  When I formed the cakes, it seemed very wet, but after chilling for 1+ hour, it looked better.  After baking 10 mins, I turned them and a lot of them broke apart but aside from being broken, they were delicious!  Hubby and daughter both gave them 5 stars!  I would make the same again next time!  Very simple and elegant!  Served with a mushroom couscous.

I prepared these this evening. They were light, succulent, nicely browned, and bland - with one exception. The recipe calls for much too much Old Bay. It's very salty and overpowering.

Very good recipe. I use meatloaf approach - open hand and fingers spread to gently combine ingredients. Keeps crab intact and blends nicely. Also used real egg, 1-2 tsp additional mayo and baked for only 10-11 mins each side.
Agree with previous post, this recipe will get you approx 5- 6 cakes - not 12. Delicious. A keeper.

Baked on one side 15 mins.....then flash fried in butter for about 1 min per side.   Just follow the recipe and it comes out amazing.  The best I have ever eaten.

Wonderful recipe!  I used 3 eggs instead of egg substitute, and they were perfect.  I also baked them in a muffin pan and they were perfectly browned and held together nicely.  Have already been asked to bring them to Thanksgiving dinner!

My family has made me make this several times. For once I stuck with a recipe exactly.  I did make them balls instead of cakes to use as a side dish/appetizer.  And half I made gluten free with gluten free bread crumbs for my mom.  I think one time I used crushed ritz crackers as the bread for the other half.  And one time used 1-2 eggs not egg beater product.  We live in Maryland and these and completely authentic and delicious.  My brother is especially picky and really loved them.

This recipe is outstanding. I did not change a thing, and they turned out as good as any I have had in an Eastern Shore restaurant. As a Marylander now living in PA, I really appreciate a good crab cake that is not filling with filler or mushed. Perfect!

Really, really good! We cut the crab with some imitation both to save money and to get rid a bit of the fishy taste, worked well. Other than that made as is and followed suggestion to refrigerate.

Not bad, but a little bland.  I appreciated the baking vs. pan-frying that most crab cakes come with... they were definitely less greasy. Followed the recipe exactly.

Now that's a crab cake! I grew up near the Chesapeake bay myself in Virginia, and I must say this is the best crab cake recipe I've tried on here. I took the advice of another review and added 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper; it gave it that extra "kick" that my family loves. Thanks for sharing!

These were good and easy to make. I followed the recipe as written other then I used three eggs instead of the egg substitute. My youngest loved these but hubby thought they were a bit dry. He also thought they could use more flavor. I enjoyed them but agreed that they could use more flavor. I made these up and let them sit for an hour before baking. I loved that they were baked and not fried.

This was very easy to make and delicious, and they didn't break or fall apart.  I would suggest adding a little more of everything.  I also added a few drops of tabasco in the mixture.

Absolutely the best crab cakes I ever had. They were delicious. The only change I made was that I cut the receipe in half and used 1 whole egg in place of substitute. Perfect texture, flavor etc. Can't wait to make them again.

I made according to directions, and it was good, but was too runny and tasted eggy.  Next time I'll try using 2 eggs instead of 3/4 c egg substitute and a little more bread crumbs.

Very good recipe.  Very easy to make and with the Old Bay, it adds a nice kick to the flavor.  I substituted an egg for the egg product and the mayo I used was Hellman's Canola Mayo.

My family loved them, I thought they were a bit too spicy but good. I would  cut the Old Bay by half myself. Also it would be great if served with cocktail sauce.

This was very easy and delicious. I loved it and made a mustard sauce to go with it. YUM!
