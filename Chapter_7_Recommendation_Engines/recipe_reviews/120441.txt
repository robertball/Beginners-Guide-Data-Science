Wonderful and moist bread! This is an absolute keeper. Because I don't keep potato flakes on hand, I microwaved a couple small potatoes and mashed them (approximately 1/2 cup). Once they cooled, I added them to the dry ingredients at the same time I added the water/oil mix. Fantastic recipe!!

Excellent sandwich bread. Mild in taste, good texture, not too dense, moist. I may try brown sugar next time for the taste but wonderful recipe as written.  Thanks for sharing!

I really like this bread, even despite my mistakes.  I halved the recipe to make only one loaf and somehow ended up putting in 2 1/2 eggs instead of 1 1/2 (I used egg beaters).  Not sure how I managed that one.  I realized it soon after but then there was no help for it other than to add some more flour.  In trying to figure out that mistake, I compounded it by forgetting the wheat germ, which is why I chose this recipe in the first place.  :o(  Even with all that, it turned out flavorful and a nice light wheat bread.  Thanks for the recipe!

Made dinner rolls and one large loaf with this recipe.  Delicious!  My kids scarfed down the rolls.

turned out great!   I made a few alterations; I used flax meal instead of wheat germ, honey instead of sugar, omitted the milk powder and used 2c. milk warmed instead of water, 2 1/2 c. all-purpose flour, and 1/2 c. rolled oats
