Be sure and strain out the spices and cinnamon stick before serving!  I forgot to include this in the directions.

I made this for our company Christmas party.  I started it on the stove and then put it in my crockpot to keep it warm.  I put the cloves and allspice in a tea infuser so I wouldn't have to strain them out.  This is also wonderful cold.  
I saved the cooked cranberries I strained out and added 1/3 cup sugar, 1/4 cup orange juice and pureed it in my blender.  It made a wonderful cranberry sauce.  You could add pectin or unflavored gelatin to make it thicker.

This was delicious!  I made it just for me and my little son, not a special occasion.  So now it's in my fridge and it has been hard to only have one big mug a night!  Actually I am sitting at work now with a snow storm on the way, wishing I had a thermos of the tea!  YUM!  Thank you for sharing!

I just brewed a batch of this wonderful tea.  I made the recipe as is - with absolutely no changes - and it is wonderful!  I can't believe how flavorful and good it is.  This is definitely a keeper.

I recommend making this a few days ahead, & let it sit in the fridge. It's easy to reheat when you want a mug. i didn't even strain it first, left all the cranberries & spices floating in the mix. the flavors meld wonderfully! a winter holiday treat!

I made this a couple years ago for my Ladies Bible Study group. They absolutely loved it, and is now requested at every special occassion! I made as recipe says... sometimes adding a little less sugar, but otherwise no changes! Wonderful!

A wonderful change from mulled apple cider! I basically followed the recipe exactly, except added an extra cinnamon stick. Fresh squeezed orange juice is a big plus. Don't forget to stain off the spices at the end before serving.

this was good, but a lot of work and fuss for the end result.  I don't know if I will make it again, but thanks for the recipe.

I am expected to make this every winter! One of my brother's found this for me, as I love cranberries. Funny that I have to fight for some! I double the recipe. I also use one of those spice bags for the cloves, cinnamon, and allspice. That way it's easy to get them out.

Served this today to my bunco group. It was well received but I think next time I will cut back on the sugar. It was a tad too sweet for our taste but still very good.
