It’s a bit chilly here in Central Florida so I thought it was time (actually it was the wife’s idea) to make this wonderful soup once again.   We had a small ham bone in the freezer that we picked up from the Honeybaked Ham store a while back, just for such an occasion, and it all came out great. We had the neighbors over yesterday for dinner and it was a big hit.

This is amazing soup, full of flavor and easy to make. I did not have the potato flakes so added garlic and frozen mashed potatoes from Trader Joe's. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly .

My wife and I are recently retired and share cooking responsibilities. She cooks more elaborate meals while I prefer more simple one-pan meals. This recipe caught my attention for a simple ham and bean soup - and is what I call a "label recipe" - i.e., a manufacturers recipe to promote and sell a product. There's several of these I've made and enjoyed over the years; Swanson's chicken stock has a wonderful and simple chicken noodle soup recipe, Campbell's Cream of Mushroom soup makes a tasty chicken and rice, etc. I'd never heard of Idahoan Roasted Garlic flavored mashed potatoes, but was easy enough to find at the grocery store for under a buck.

The recipe was followed save for 2 substitutions; chicken stock was used instead of vegetable stock, mostly because I hate vegetable stock and it's not easy to find - which I take to mean everyone else hates it too. The other substitution was fresh parsley - we grow our own and dry it for winter use. So to reconstitute the dried parsley, I added it to the stock before adding the potato mixture.

We really enjoyed the soup, together with some City Sour Sourdough bread (made in Portland, OR). There was no need for extra salt with the potato mixture. All it needed was a little pepper.

In the end, my wife who is a former foods teacher said what she always says when I come up with a winner "I'd let you make that for me again". 

To which I replied "I'd let you wash the dishes" - which always provokes her to laugh that laugh that says "d

this is hard to rate. I chose it for a base and it truly was a good one. I'm sure it would be good as is however I like to customize. I used extra beans, mashed them and used for thickener. I added a bay leaf, minced garlic, and diced potato. It was great for us.  thanks for helping me get started!

After reading the reviews, I was suprised at how bad this soup actually was.  The texture, thickness and especially the taste was terrible.

I substituted a half pound of cubed ham for the ham bone and added an extra can of beans. Overall, good flavor but a bit too salty for my tastes. Next time I'd only use one 32 oz. container of broth (the biggest source of salt) and add more broth to taste.

Would make again!

Very good.  Easy to make.  I was craving this and didn't want to let the soup simmer for the 1 hour but I did and it was the perfect time to let the meat really just fall off the bone. Did not need any salt due to the ham.  One of the best ham and bean soups I've ever had. Thanks

This was very good.  Husband didn't want beans and I didn't want carrots so corn came in to make up the difference.  I also used just regular instant potatoes and it was still yummy.

This soup is delicious!  I prefer bean soup without the tomato sauce that some recipes call for, and this is perfect.  I did add a few spices, just a little bit of each - crushed bay leaves, dried oregano and dried basil.  If you like a true bean soup without the vegetable soup overtones you'll love this one!

This was excellent!  The only change I made was to use actual left over mashed potatoes instead of instant and added a couple cloves of garlic.  I will definitely be making this again.  What a great use of a ham bone!

When I made this, my only ingredient substitution was to use 4 ounces of dehydrated potatoes (flakes) and about a teaspoon of garlic powder in place of the 4 ounce package of "Roasted Garlic Flavored Mashed Potatoes, dry."

Everyone in the family enjoyed it.

Used ham broth I had on hand. Only had 1 can of cannellini beans, but with the added mashed potatoes, it was plenty thick enough. Pretty darn good.

I soaked Great Northern beans overnight and cooked them in water with pork neck bones and small packet of ham base. Followed the rest of your recipe as written except transferred my beans to your broth and added1.5 cups of my bean cooking water. Next time I’ll use a ham bone. The end result is incredible, a slight sweet taste. I didn’t add any seasoning and omitted the parsley.

Too much powdered potatoes for me, texture and flavor-wise. Can definitely modify. Mods: diced Canadian bacon, mashed potatoes, etc.

Other than mashing my own Idaho potatoes and adding a lot more beans, I followed the recipe. 5 stars! The ham and bone was from a leftover Easter Honeybaked ham.  Perfect!
