Delicious!  This has become a holiday favorite!  I add 1/2 cup sugar to add a bit of sweetness - there are never any leftovers.

My family loves this type of side dish. I did modify it, as we do not like canned corn. I used 2 10oz bags of frozen corn then doubled the sour cream to replace the cans of whole kernel/creamed corn. I also added 1/2 of small sweet onion diced. Loved it and so did the whole family...a keeper!

My family loves this. Also good with can diced jalapinos or chilis mixed in. For the ones that say it turns out to wet or moist. Don't omit anything!! The trick is to bake it for 10 to 15 minutes take it out and stir it. Then return it to the oven and finish baking.

Thank goodness they had a copier at the party I took this dish to and I thought to take the recipe.  EVERYONE wanted it.  I did double the recipe and added jalapeno peppers,YUM!  However in a 4-qt casserole it took 1 hr. 45 min. to cook.  Should have used a 9 x 14 dish

I made this recipe as stated. It was too greasy and too wet. Even though I extended the baking time to a good 90 min. it was still too moist. It had a good flavor though. I would make this again with the following changes: definitely drain the whole kernel corn, use only 1/2 cup sour cream, and most of all, use only 1/4 cup butter.

I made this in a 9x13 pan and it still took about the same baking time as the directions said to use for a casserole. The bread came out very moist, but not too sweet. Slice yoursefl up some of this, top with butter, a squeeze of lime and a dash of chili powder and it's just delish!

I thought this was pretty good, but it got "thumbs down" from my husband and kids.  Nothing wrong with the recipe, it turned out fine.  They just didn't like it.

Made this for Christmas for extended family gathering.  This was the first dish gone.  You could hear people commenting on how good it was.  You could hear "Mmmm's".  Even my picky father pronounced that it was good.

This is a yum Nicole. I added some melted butter and cut back on the sour cream. Not overly sweet and really delicious. Thanks!

I get rave reviews every time I make this dish - people are shocked how easy it is.  This is a holiday dish keeper and my family now asks me to make it.  I feel like I'm cheating because they think it is too good to be so simple.  I like this one better because of less butter and total ease!  Thanks for such an easy, tasty side dish!!!

I was in a rush to make something for Thanksgiving and found this recipe.  It has the sweetness of creamed corn and the consistency of corn bread or corn soufle BUT only better!

I made this recipe for many years and have enjoyed it- it's easy, & never fail.   I have stopped making it because the corn muffin mix has trans fats in it.  I try VERY hard not to eat any trans fats since learning how terrible they are for my body.

This is one of the best recipes I have found..  It is quick and easy.  The only problem with it is that I don;t have baking dishes large enough to have leftovers.  My kids will scrape the dish they love it so much.

Great recipe. My husbands eyes really lit up when he first tasted it.  He and I was very pleased with the results adn with the easiness to prepare it.  My year old son came back for 4 teaspoons. Thats a PLUS!

Used 2 eggs and reduced butter to 1/3 cup.  We enjoyed it and will make it again.  Very easy to make.

I also made this in my smaller crockpot during the holidays and it came out great.  Started it about 3 hours before turkey was done.

I tried this for the first time for Thanksgiving and we loved it.  I did bake it for about 1/2 hour longer.  
Will definitely make it again.

There wasn't a person in the house who didn't go back for seconds for this one.  I added in a half cup of cheddar cheese on a whim.  I didn't taste the cheese, but since the house devoured this like crazy, I'll keep using the cheese.

This is a favorite at our house.  I add 2 chopped jalapeños (seeds removed to reduce the heat a little bit) and a tablespoon of honey.

Delicious!  I catered a wedding rehearsal dinner for 35 people and I got rave reviews!  I even made it at home for my very picky husband and he loved it!  This side dish has now made it into our dinner rotation.

LOVED it! I cooked it for about 1 hr and 20 minutes, I think i had the oven rack a little too low. It is delicious!

I have three VERY picky eaters and 2 out of 3 ate this and liked it. It definitely gets a thumbs up in our house!
