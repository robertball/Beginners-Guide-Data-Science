This recipe is excellent for how quick and easy it is.  It certainly isn't gourmet but for a weeknight meal it's great, especially when it's cold out or you're just craving comfort food.  I've made it ahead of time, mixing everything but the biscuits together and refrigerating overnight, then baking with the biscuits when I get home from work to speed it up even more, and it was still just as good.

Family liked this very much! Slight variation, I used the mix to stuff Pillsbury Crescents. Used two crescents for each so it was a rectangle instead of a triangle. Placed mix on one side of crescent, then folded the other end over, crimped all sides to make a pocket. Baked per instructions on crescents, had to turn them over after 10 minutes so both sides would bake.

I have  a HUGE family and they all love this casserole!  The only changes I make are to add a few dashes of garlic powder, onion powder, and paprika; and while I am assembling the base of the casserole, I bake my pre-cut-into-fourths biscuit pieces for about five minutes. Then, the last 5-8 minutes of baking, I push the pieces into the casserole and the whole thing comes out perfect and tastes fantastic!

This was okay, but I find that the recipe on the back of the Cream of Potato can is better and MUCH easier!  Too bad they changed the recipe just for this website!  Cambells shouldn't name the recipes the exact same thing.

This was delicious! Chicken and biscuits from other recipes but they were missing some flavor. This one was great. I ended up using a little bit more biscuits (bought 2 packages, used enough to cover my baking dish and the baked any extras according to the directions on the can). The only bad thing I found was that it did turn out a litle watery. Next time, I plan on using only  1kind of soup. If people are doubling this recipe, I'd suggest not doubling the soups.

I followed the recipe to the tee just to see what I could add later. It was delicious and my husband could not get enough of it. I added brocoli, Cauliflower & Carrots as the veggies. I would add some garlic next time.

I changed it a bit. I used cream of chicken with herbs and cream of celery soups. I also added some chopped up potatoes and used frozen peas and carrots for the vegetables. I did take the advice of others and cooked the biscuits for 5 minutes before adding them to the chicken mixture.

I love this recipe! I make the chicken by cutting up chicken breasts, seasoning with garlic salt and onion powder, placing on foil lined baking sheet, covering with foil and placing in oven @ 375 for 35 mins (or until juices run clear). 
Instead of cream of celery, I use one can of cream of chicken & mushroom. I also use just the tiniest pinch of thyme and add pepper and garlic salt to taste. I usually forgo the veggies (shame on me). 
I agree with other reviewers that you should either cook the biscuits a little beforehand or turn them over halfway through to avoid soggy bottom biscuits on this casserole. Although, turning the biscuits over after 15 mins and continuing to bake the casserole doesnâ€™t really hurt anything.

The only changes I made was, I didn't put in the cream of celery soup and I added an extra can of cream of pototo. And also added flower to the soup to make it thicker. But over all it ended up being very delicious!!!!! I always make this and it's a fan favorite at my house.

So easy and quick to make. We added shredded cheese to the top of the mixture before baking for the first 15 minutes. Will definitely make again!

I have been looking for great meals that our whole family can eat (including a 1yr old) and this was perfect! Baby loved it and husband said it was his favorite thing I've made lately. (And it's super easy to make!)

I am surprised this recipe has received so many good reviews.  I was not at all impressed.  It's so bland!  I added seasoning salt and it still was tasteless.  It's a good start, but needs more.  I'd keep looking if you're wanting a good yummy chicken and biscuit recipe.

I did not want to risk 'soggy bottom biscuits', so I baked them for about 6 minutes, then placed them atop the chicken mixture. It was delicious...everyone went back for seconds!

I really enjoy this recipe as just a vegetable dish.  No decayed flesh, simply vegetables, and it is quite delicious.  I do use rice milk in place of milk as I do not use animal milk (meant for their babies), and it cooks just fine within the recipe.  Whatever is in the soups blends well with it.  My dad loves this recipe.  So, easy and tasty, thanks.

Good comfort food!  It's kind of like a pot pie without the pie crust and using biscuits instead.  I used green beans and corn as my veggies and I like the fact that I'll definitely be able to just use whatever I have on hand for this quick and easy meal.  It's a keeper!

Very nice!!  We've made this a number of times. I've made it with chicken, turkey, ham, leftover steak, ground beef, and even sliced hot dogs in a pinch. Extremely versatile. Love love love it.

THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!!!!!!! I haven't made this recipe for a long time and I couldn't find it! The flavor in this is delicious. I always found the biscuits to be an interesting twist but one of these days I want to try this with a pie crust. Thanks again for posting this recipe!

Tasty and easy to make!  The only changes I made were to add just a half cup of milk, 5-6 cups of cooked veggies, granulated garlic, dried onions, and twice the pepper and thyme as stated.  I also added around 3/4 cup chopped ham that I had defrosted since I ran out of shredded chicken.  My kids wanted seconds, and it fed five people with one leftover lunch.  Yum!!

my family loves this recipe. I use cream of chicken soup instead of cream of potato and it has more flavor. I also cook the chicken in chicken broth with a little garlic and onion powder. I prefer to make my own buttermilk biscuits separate and then spoon the chiken/soup mixture over the biscuits !!! yummmy

I used 2 small frozen green beans/peas/carrots; put them in the microwave as directed on package.
Could not find 7 oz buttermilk biscuits; therefore, used 16 oz can.

Great little weeknight meal.  I only made a couple slight alterations:

1lb diced chicken breast (didn't measure the volume of it) browned in pan with 1 diced onion and 2 Tbsp EVOO. 
4c frozen veggies (peas, carrots, corn, beans, lima beans)
1 tsp salt, 1 tsp pepper, and 1 tsp Thyme.

And next time I'll get a longer tube of biscuits.  This recipe doesn't have enough biscuit as written.   Get enough biscuits so you can cover the dish with a 1/2" thick layer max of biscuit dough.

I boiled chicken with carrots, celery, onion and frozen peas.  I used cream of chicken and cream of potato soup and added onion and garlic powders, and 1/2 tsp parsley.     Cooked the biscuits on aluminum foil for 6 minutes, then took them out of the pan on the aluminum foil. Cooked the chicken/vegetable/soup mixture for 15 min, then added the biscuits top side down, and cooked for 15 minutes more.  Love it!

I thought this was delicious for a quick meal for busy families that adds a comfort feel after a long day. Itâ€™s very versatile. You can add different veggies or even leave the chicken out. Add hamburger and cream of mushroom soup instead of the chicken mix!  I love sprinkling the biscuits with Parmesan Cheese before baking. We love garlic so I add that. Thanks for a keeper!

I think the only thing I changed was adding cream of chicken instead of potato. Delicious and hearty! Husband approves and simple to make!

It was good after I added some seasonings.  Also the biscuits were still doughy, I had to flip them over and bake a little longer.

I made this as directed, except to do a few things that different reviewers suggested. I baked the rolls for 6 mins first before adding to casserole (for crispy bottoms), added Lawreys garlic salt & shredded Colby jack cheese. My family loved it, and wants me to make it again!

Love this recipe! I ended up using fresh chicken, seasoned it with poultry seasoning, cumin and some pepper. Then I cooked it on the stove in olive oil, shredded it and added it to the soup mixture. The seasoning gave it an awesome flavor! This recipe is definitely one I'll be making again:)

I didn't have celery soup so I used a can of creamed potatoes and cream of chicken.  Used a can of chicken,  1 can of corn, 1 can of green beans, cooked carrots,  garlic,  parsley,  Mexican cheese,  leftover turkey gravy, salt, pepper, and crispy onions. Topped off with cheese, crispy onions, and leftover biscuits.

I'm not sure why people thought this was watery.  I used exactly what the recipe said.  I used a combination of mixed vegetables and broccoli.  I did add 2 diced potatoes and added a little onion powder and a little dried sage. I used a little less than 1c of milk but added about 1/4c of white wine. It was a great weeknight dish.

I thought this was a tasty recipe.  I made the dish the night before to save on time and added the biscuits before baking.  I used fresh veggies and added garlic salt and paprika to the chicken breasts as I was concerned the recipe may lack in flavor without spices.  I didnâ€™t use thyme as I didnâ€™t have any on hand.  Will definitely make again.

My family loved this meal!  The only problem, we cooked it with the biscuits on top as per recipe instructions.  Bad idea!  They did not cook throughly and I ended up taking them off the top and baking them separately. Great dinner though!

This was very easy and very good. We don't do casserole type meals very often but this was very flavorful. I added a 1/2c sour cream and 1/2c sharp cheddar cheese to the soup mix, cooked everything on the stove top, then transfered to an 8x8 pan put uncooked biscuits on top and cooked for 15min. Saved a little time this way.

I am amazed how good and easy this recipe is! I made this one week after I had my second baby and my family was so impressed that I could make something so yummy right after giving birth. It's that simple!
