With cream cheese in it, how can you go wrong?  I really loved this dip, although I added sour cream instead of the yogurt and I cut the recipe in half, which still made plenty.  I've been looking for a different Spinach Dip and now I've found it.  I just hope there's enough left for our New Years Day party.

We loved this dip! I just steamed fresh spinach, softened the cream cheese into it, added the rest, mixed, then chilled. YuM!

Great recipe! I made it for my boyfriend's superbowl party and they loved it. To my surprise, everyone at work loved it too! The cream cheese is the key.

I think that too much spinach is used in this dip. Everything was perfect but many said it was too spinachy, next time I will use less because I was also looking for a more creamy white spinach dip.

I did not care for it, but everyone else liked it.  Too bland, and it LOOKED gross.

I thought the flavor was great.  Next time I'd use frozen chopped spinach instead of canned - I think the texture and color would be much better.

It made a ton, which I thought was great? Too spinachy?  Bland. \
