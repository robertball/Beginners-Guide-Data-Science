These were delicious! I thought they might have too much seasoning but it ended out tasting perfect for my familyâ€™s taste (we like a lot of seasoning). I had a little bit of trouble keeping some of them together but I probably should have worked in smaller batches (I cooked all at the same time). I served mine with egg noodles and brown gravy.

Good recipe although maybe a little dry due to the one cup of bread crumbs. Next time I'll probably add a little less. Otherwise made about 20 meatballs that went a long way.
