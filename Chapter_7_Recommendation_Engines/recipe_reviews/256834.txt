This is one awesome Buddha Bowl! I actually didn't know what to expect with it, but loved everything about it! So many favorite parts -- the quinoa was delicious and perfectly cooked. The chicken is so flavorful. LOVE the sweet potato and onion...oh my goodness, so wonderful. And the sauce -- perfect. I liked it best when I didn't mix the lime juice in. DELICIOUS and 5 star.

This Buddha bowl is wonderful! I made it exactly as written except I didn't have an avocado but the flavors balance perfectly together. I made sure to use fresh lime juice because the concentrate can get overpowering in a dish like this. If you're looking to try making your first Buddha bowl this one is super simple and delicious!

I liked this recipe. It was easy and took us less than an hour. I added sriracha to the sauce to give it a more balanced flavor. This bowl would really be good with any sauce you'd like.

This was lovely. I followed the recipe, minus lime juice as recommended by another reviewer, and adults and kids alike were pleased with the results. My 13yo son said he loved everything about it. If I were to change anything, it would be to make a little extra sauce, otherwise it was wonderful!

Just made this tonight for dinner for my large family and EVERYONE loved it! One son even proclaimed "it was so pretty Mom I should have taken a picture of it before I ate it!" Simply delicious and intriguing blend of flavors. I didn't have fresh spinach so substituted romaine and sliced baby cucumbers with excellent results. Great healthy week-night dinner that is a pleasure to serve. I'll surely add this to my fave recipes!

Prepped quinoa and sweet potatoes the night before and I cubed the chicken breast prior to cooking so the process would be faster. Recipe was fantastic and filling. Will make again!

This was excellent! I was a little skeptical with the sweet potatoes and chicken but I was blown away how well all of these flavors worked together and brought about a flavorful and healthy meal. Not only will we make this again but I will be on the search for more clean recipes like this one.

So so good. My whole family loves this. We’ve made it several times now and have tried it as-is and all sorts of variations (sub blanched kale or cooked arugula for spinach, or add some extra veggies like roasted cauliflower or broccoli).  We always double or triple the sauce because we all love it and like to have extra for the fridge.  Don’t skip the toasted sesame seeds!

I use this dressing over a variety of vegetables and grains to make different Buddha Bowls.  Adding tahini is also great and makes a thick and creamy sauce.

Family loved it! Used yams and wild rice instead of sweet potato and quinoa. The dressing tasted better the next day so I'll prepare it the day before.

Delicious! I cut up chicken thighs (my preference) and cooked it with the ginger and garlic. Thought it was missing something so I added a little soy sauce. Used yellow onions and added asparagus. My family loved it. So easy but it looks and tastes impressive. I also put the peanut dressing in a food processor.

I liked it BUT...next time I would use less lime juice and more honey. A bit tart for us. I also would forget the chicken and do vegetarian. The chicken did not add anything and more veggies would have been tastier.

This was really good! Very easy to make. I absolutely love anything that contains roasted veggies and the peanut sauce was something new but I enjoyed it. Word of caution: do not use as much lime juice for the sauce in order to avoid it tasting acidic.

I loved this recipe as is.  The dressing  gives it such a deep rich flavor.  I love the dressing flavor on the sweet potato too. I doubled the dressing recipe to use for later, but ended up using it all!   Next time I want to use just a little more peanut butter and only a little less lime juice. I want to add brown rice to the quinoa.  I will also chop the spinach so it blends in better with each bite

This was pretty delicious but I do have to agree with the other reviewers that there is too much lime for the sauce. I squeezed one fresh lime and it was still excessive. I had to tweak the sauce a little bit to counter the sourness and also added sriracha and chilli garlic paste for a bit of a kick. The sauce was just okay after still sour but once it was mixed in with everything else you couldn t even tell. Will be making again but with less lime juice!

Made it exactly as written and it was fantastic!! Done in less than an hour and makes great leftovers. Will make again but will maybe cook my sweet potatoes/onions on 400 for 30 minutes instead. Thanks for a great recipe!

This had a fantastic flavor! Made as directed but I scaled it down some to suit our appetites. I also added 1tsp. chili paste to the sauce. No other changes and it was a huge hit! Everyone raved about it and everyone was full. A total win and going into my regular rotation. Thanks for the great recipe! ETA: The carb count on this seemed wrong so I put it into fitday and it comes up as 63g total carbs with 13g fiber for a net of 50g just in case anyone is counting them. I have actually scaled down the quinoa cutting it in half as we were a little overwhelmed by how filling it is. This lowers the carb count to 40ish. Still delicious! Still have it in our rotation and love it!

I made no substitutions and this was so delicious. The peanut sauce is to die for. The whole thing is time consuming but fun if you like to cook. My family said this meal was just as good as in a nice restaurant.

Pretty good. This recipe makes a lot though--I reduced the amount of quinoa and had enough for 5 decent sized portions. Instead of meat I used tempeh. As a preference used more cilantro and avocado. Thanks for a good recipe!

WOW, this was good!! My family of 4 all loved it. The flavours went together better than you would expect; this is definitely a case of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts. I doubled the recipe in case anyone wanted seconds, but it wasn't necessary as it made enough as is. I served this with fried eggs on top as we love fried eggs to top things off.  The only thing I had trouble with was the chicken... none of the garlic or ginger stayed on the chicken like it did in the video; it stayed in an oily glob in the bottom of the pan, so next time I'm going to try using garlic and ginger powder to season the chicken instead. (not sure if it will be quite as good flavour-wise, but I will update my review after I try it). I'll definitely make this again!

This was delicious- love the sauce! I omitted the chicken and used vegetable broth to make it vegan. I sauteed the spinach with the ginger and garlic for 1 minute to wilt it. The only change I would make next time is to use 2 sweet potatoes because I'd like a higher ratio of them.

Great recipe and will keep it in my repertoire as everyone loved it the ingredients are an amazing fresh combination and it could be changed up if someone wanted to do it but was missing something on the list- though I would highly recommend not skipping the most flavorful things that combine and create wonderful flavors. Using udon noodles or brown rice would be interesting substitute if there was no quinoa in the pantry.

Super easy and quick to make.   I looked over the recipe and found that I had all the ingredients in the house (except one or two, but I was able to easily substitute those), so I made it.  I had this made, and was eating, in about an hour.

This was VERY GOOD and filling!  Normally, something like this I would have eaten two servings, but one filled me up perfectly.

This recipe is definitely going into my saved recipes book!

Love this! It doesn’t seem like there’s enough sauce, but maybe that’s why it’s so good, not overpowering. I’m trying it tonight with store bought peanut sauce just to cut down on the work, so we will see if it’s as good...

This was delicious!!! I tasted the sauce by itself and was a little grossed out but WOW it totally pulls together when all ingredients are combined. It has a perfect blend of sweet (potato, peanut butter), sour (lime), and savory (everything else). Will definitely make this again.

I followed the recipe exactly.

This was absolutely delicious!! Although I definitely seasoned the chicken before pan frying it. Aside from that it was perfect as is.

Kids weren’t impressed, but what do they know. Both hubby and I loved it. Cooked quinoa in instant pot for 2 min with NR (total time after rinsing was 25 min. Cooked tofu in convection toaster oven (after marinating and tossing in corn starch also 25 min. Made the veggies and sauce exactly to your specs. Amazing. Definitely planning to do this as a shared meal with others.

So so good! I used frozen diced chicken breasts and boil-in-bag red quinoa to speed things up a bit. The sauce is amazing even with low-sodium soy sauce and low-fat peanut butter.

This is such a healthy meal! I made it as it was written except I left out the cilantro and sesame seeds. I thought it was very good and will be making it again! I had some left over and mixed the dressing in with the other ingredients. It was even better after all the ingredients had time to meld!

I will definitely make this again and again! It s quite possibly one of my favorite meals. The flavors are incredible. And that dressing is to die for! It also helps to know that it s pretty healthy.

This turned out fantastic! The quinoa was double what we needed to feed my husband and I so next time I will halve the suggested amount. I also cooked the sweet potato and onions for 25 minutes in the oven. Instead of mixing the sweet potatoes and onions together to bake I left them in separate piles. This allowed each person to add as much onion as they wanted. I added sliced cucumber to my Buddha bowl and my husband added chopped up peanuts on his. We plan to add this to our monthly menu!

I served three adults, and the servings were too large. I had quite a bit of quinoa leftover. Made the recipe as written except I used lettuce from the garden in place of the spinach. And to keep my house cool, I did the sweet potatoes and onions on the grill. I will make this again!  I think it would easily serve four.

I loved this recipe! I don't often write reviews but this is worth it. I left off the cilantro and the sesame seeds but kept everything else true to the recipe. I will probably season the chicken a bit next time I make it.

Very good. I doubled the sauce and made a few tweaks by adding some crushed red pepper shelled edamame and red and yellow peppers to the mix.

OMG Delicious - followed recipe except cut back on the lime juice as others suggested. Peanut sauce was mouth watering and I used it all on 3 bowls not 4. Forgot to layer the spinach but no biggie just put it on top. First time having Quinoa and it was awesome. Took longer to cook the potatoes so the onions off on there own burned. For me I will caramelize the onions instead of putting them with the potato. Thank You for this delightful recipe.

Made this tonight for the family and everyone loved it! Made as written with the exception of the red onion, simply because we don’t like onions. Definitely a keeper!
