I actually woke up this morning determined to have this for breakfast (I'm pregnant, so it's ok, lol)! I had everything on hand except for the ciabatta rolls, so I just used sliced Italian bread, and that seemed to work out wonderfully. I just eye-balled everything to my taste. I have to say that this really DID taste like a jalapeno popper...SO GOOD! I can't wait to make this for my husband, I know he will LOVE it too. Thanks for sharing this fun, creative and delicious sandwich, that I will be making often~YUM! :)

Excellent sandwich!  I think, to make it an unqualified 5 star recipe, the next time I will add a crisply cooked and crumbled slice of bacon.

Yum!  This was delicious.  I realized I didn't have sour cream so added a little mayo instead.  I used Italian bread-I think this sandwich would be good on any bread of your liking.  Served with a salad for a very tasty dinner.  Thanks for sharing-this is a great recipe!

OMG how much better could it get?!?!? I needed a quick dinner after work and threw these together in under 15 min. Used pepper-jack cheese in place of colby. Served with Spicy tomato soup (tomato soup with hot sauce added). Thanks so much for this recipe:)

Delicious! I added some slices of rotisserie chicken from grocer (they make a honey jalepeño flavor that matched perfectly), and this was a filling meal! Yummm

We really enjoyed this sandwich.  I made it on sourdough bread and added a little more of the jack cheese.  I don't think i cared for the sour cream in the spread, so made another sandwich the next day and used mayo instead.  We both agreed that we liked that sandwich better.  Play with it, we even thought it might be good with slices of chicken in it.  Thanks for the recipe!

Tastes just like a popper--maybe even better! I use spicy chilli tortilla chips and cheddar-jack cheese and a high quality wheat bread and they turn out  perfectly!! Makes a great dip or cheese ball also. I use regular cream cheese instead of the soft when making a cheese ball & mix in the shredded cheddar-jack, roll in a ball & chill & right before serving, roll in crushed tortilla chips. It is great! I might try adding some bacon to the sandwich or spread next time, I am sure that would be good also, but these are delicious made exactly as the recipe states.

Yummy!  Made on sourdough bread and was so good. Hubby liked it too. From now on I will make with fat free cream cheese and low fat cheeses to see if just as good.

Yummy!  I loved the added chips which actually helped this taste more like a jalapeno topper for the crunch.  Very tasty!

This was delicious! I have to say that I mixed everything together, cream cheese, sour cream, shredded cheese, crushed chips in a bowl to make it easier to assemble for the family. I then let them add the amt of jalapenos they wanted before cooking. I used plain white bread. They were a hit!

Wow these are so tasty! I tried to use healthy ingredients when able, such as red. fat sour cream, neufchatel cheese, 45-calorie-a-slice wheat bread... and wow it was still really really good. Otherwise I used normal tortillas, and shredded cheddar because I had it, plus sprays of butter spray instead of buttering the outside of bread. Going to have to make another one asap... :)

I needed to make a quick lunch meal for my sister, brother-in-law, and myself. Found this recipe. Though I don't usually cook and this is my first time trying to follow a recipe, but it actually turned out pretty good. It was tasty, quick and easy! Though the picture looked like they used regular sliced bread. I tried this grilled cheese with Ciabatta bread and it was good. Loved it. Will try to make it again next time.

I tweak this all over the place - what's new ;) I made the filling with 8 oz cream cheese, a drained 4 oz can of diced jalapenos [not pickled], ~1 cup grated mozzarella, ~1/2 cup grated cheddar jack, and ~1/4 cup bacon bits. I used squaw bread [remind me not to use dark bread for grilled cheese! hard to tell when it's browned - when it starts out brown!], and served it with strawberry jelly. Num num! Though I need to cut the jalapenos back by about 1/2 next time {= Mom liked this - but I picked some of the jalapenos off hers before grilling - so her face did not melt off (=

Came out great! Very close to a jalapeño popper! I used sliced dill bread for more complexity and added some cilantro to the cream cheese filling. I'll double the amount of jalapeño next time since I like little more bite. This would probably be amazing just as a cream cheese spread on a bagel!

10 Stars!!!!  I'll never look at a regular 'ole grilled cheese sandwich the same.  This was very, very good.  I used crushed fritos instead of tortillas, just because that is what I had.  The sandwich has some kick, but it's not bad.  I also used regular wheat bread and it was just fine.  I highly recommend this recipe.  My husband had three sandwiches for dinner!  He said it would be perfect for a dinner watching football this fall.  Mmm Mmm.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe, BrandyE.

Added chopped smoked chicken, bacon and  extra sharp cheddar. No chips or sour cream. Used garlic butter instead of plain to grill.  Yum on steroids!

Definitely not your mom's grilled cheese sandwich. This is fast, easy, and very delicious. Loved it! I used plain white sandwich bread. I used a slice of pepperjack and some shredded cheddar instead of colby-jack. This is a great idea for using those broken chips in the bottom of the sack too! A sandwich and chips all in one. Thanks BrandyE!

Yummmy!  Made just as the recipe states but added more jalapeno peppers because we like things spicy.  The tortilla strips just add crunch to make it taste like an actual popper.  Easy, quick and good!

I must admit, I wasn't really totally looking forward to this sandwich.  It intrigued me, but at the same time I HATE cream cheese, so I wasn't sure what to expect.  What I should have expected is an amazingly close to tasting just like jalepeno poppers w/out the deep fried oozing mess sandwich!  I followed the recipe, though I did sub white Italian sandwich bread for ciabatta roll.  I gave Mr. LTH a bite and even he thought it was great and he's Mr. Sissypants when it comes to heat (I used diced canned jalaps and the heat level was just right).  THANK YOU for a new sandwich staple in my world, BrandE!

Instead of shreddded, I used a slice of pepper jack cheese. I added a vggie patty on each sandwich. This was delicious!

Amazing!  I used French bread.  I think next time I will just combine all of the ingredients together in hopes that it will be less of a mess.  It was quite difficult to maneuver the sandwich without the cheese falling out everywhere.  But this sandwich is divine!!

If you like spicy, you'll never make regular grilled cheese again. These are quick, tasty, and surprisingly filling. I love spicy foods, so I usually double the amount of jalapeno slices. Yum!

These definatly tasted like poppers.  They were definatly spicey and good.  Although, for grilled cheese sandwhiches, I don't know that I would go to this much trouble to make them again.  BUT...they were very good.

Simple, yet sooo good! If you like jalapeno poppers, you will love this. I like to dip my poppers in ranch, so I substitute ranch dressing for the sour cream, but it is good as is. Easiest meal (that actually tastes super good) ever.

Very good sandwich if you like jalepeno poppers. I used fresh chopped jalepenos instead of pickled ones. It was a yummy and easy meal for me and my husband!

I skipped the tortilla chips because we didn't have any. This sandwich is in my top 3 sandwiches ever. It tastes so close to the real Jalapeno Poppers, but I prefer this sandwich over the real ones!!! It was so easy to make. I will be making this often. Thanks!

Very Good...I used Sourdough bread and nacho cheese chips since I was out of tortilla and it did taste very close to an actual jalapeño popper.

Sooo yummy! This really did reamind us of a jalapeno popper.  I used some chopped jalapenos out of a jar, and that made the cream cheese soft enough that I omitted the sour cream (also used reduced fat cream cheese which is already softer).  Maybe because of this, the crushed tortilla chips weren't crunchy.  Next time I will just omit them because the sandwich was already incredible!

One of the best grilled cheese sandwiches I've had in a long time.  Usually I stick w/american cheese and tomato w/buttered bread.  This was a a fantastic idea! I did have to make a few changes b/c of what I had in my fridge.  I used fresh jalapeno peppers, I left the sour cream out and just used cream cheese, and I used american cheese rather than colby-monterey jack.  This really is delicious.  Thanks for the recipe, I know I'll be making this often!

This sandwich is awesome.  I didn't have sour cream, so I softened the cream cheese a bit in the microwave and went ahead with the recipe anyway.  It was a total hit.  Works with diced, fresh jalapenos, too.

This sandwich is awesome! I did use sourdough and I only had Monterey jack instead of colby jack but it was a huge hit! I will be making this again very soon! What a great spin on a traditional grilled cheese. The only thing I was told was it actually needed a few more peppers. 
Thank you for sharing. :)

Amazing!!! Seriously. SO GOOD!! The directions can be a little confusing on this part, so let me clarify something. The "top" piece of bread you will cut a little. That will go inside of bun down, like normal, on top of the sandwich. But the bottom piece will be inside down as well. So butter the "inside" of the bread, aka the "doughy" side and place that side on the grill.

This makes a really good quick lunch. I use sharp Vermont white cheddar if I have it on hand, which I think is perfect in this. I also use (lots of) extra jalapeños and sometimes leave the chips out. It's a nice change of pace and very flavorful and easy to make. I have also tried this with leftover focaccia. The biggest problem I had with the ciabatta was cutting through the tough bottom crust without squeezing all the insides out! Seems like such a simple sandwich, one that I didn't think I'd repeat, but the flavor has stuck with me and I find myself craving it. My boyfriend also likes it. Thanks.

pretty creative!!  I made this as a last minute dinner, so i used italian bread i had on hand & mayo instead of sour cream since its what i had.  It did taste just like a jalapeno pepper, i just wasn't crazy about the tortilla chips in the middle, will leave them out next time....but will be a next time!  easy & different!

I used fresh jalapenos when I made these, really a great sandwich.  If you want to use fresh jalapenos, I suggest heating them in the pan first to soften them up.

My hubby said if he owned a restaurant, this would be on the menu!  I didn't use the tortilla chips and it was still awesome!!

Deliciousss. Seriously though. I was a little wary of the ciabatta rolls, and though my fiance had a few complaints, I thought it went well. Also I added cubed chicken because we are mostly carnivorous and that came out really great too. The cream cheese/sour cream combo was an excellent taste for these.

Umm.. Wow :D A true home run here. A couple of suggestions would be to use a combination of fresh jalapenos and jarred ones. I found the jar kind didn't have enough spice so I had to add some cayenne pepper. Also, don't skimp on the bread! I have made this twice now. Once with ciabatta bread and then with whole wheat. While it still tasted delish on the whole wheat I think artisan bread is the best way to go on this. Both time I made it with colby and I don't think you can go wrong! Absolutely superb!

Pretty good. I used mozzarella (all I had on hand) and it was still good. I bet cheddar would be awesome. For the bread I used English Muffin Loaves from this site.

These were great!  I skipped the sour cream (did not have any on hand) and just heated the cream cheese a little to make it easier to spread.  I also used sliced sourdough bread instead of ciabatta so I wouldn't have to prepare the bread.  The chips were soggy by the time I got to my second half so I might skip them next time - but they were good while crunchy!  Overall loved the recipe and will make it again.

I love this sandwich, but next time I would use thinner bread. I used sourdough, and it was a bit too thick. I was unable to melt the cheese enough to my liking.

It was super filling and delicious. The ciabatta bread is thick so use it cause the filling is thick. Only thing I’d change is less cream cheese and more Colby Monterey Jack cheese.

Really felt that you needed a grill press to make these.  The pan just didn't do it justice because with the thick ciabatta bread it didn't properly melt the insides. I switched chopped red peppers for the jalapenos.

Really great idea, but mine were a disaster! The filling didn't melt fast enough to 'seal' the sandwich together, and they wouldn't flip, and then the one side of the bread burned....just a big mess all around. We sort of cobbled something together out of the components, and that tasted good, but as written I was struggling!

My girlfriend and I made this two times, the first time we made it by the recipe, and the second time we added in some tomatos and green bell peppers. It was about one tomato, diced and one bell pepper. Also, if you just make the mix for the sandwich, it makes a great chip dip.

Total winner. I used sourdough bread and cheddar (what I had on hand) and it turned out really well. Husband loved it! Made a regular grilled cheese for the toddler and the jalapeño version for the grown ups. Great meal. Served with tomato soup. Dipping the sandwiches in the soup was quite tasty, too. Adding to the rotation!

My boyfriend and I have decided to find "the best grilled cheese" this summer, and this is a definite contender! We used Doritos instead of plain tortilla chips (he used the spicy nacho, I used the original nacho), and we made a fantastic buttermilk ranch dipping sauce to go along with the sandwich. 
If you're making this for more than 2 moderately hungry people, I would definitely double the recipe. Also, if you can only find a loaf of ciabatta bread (as opposed to rolls), just slice it in half horizontally and make rolls that way. The bread definitely makes the sandwich!

This seriously rocked my socks.  I can't wait until grilled cheese day!

It was pretty tasty but the ciabatta was way too crispy and crunchy and made eating the sandwich overall difficult to eat. The flavors were good but the mouth scars not so great

We loved the flavor of this sandwich, but the texture of the crushed tortilla chips got very soft while cooking.  The next time, I would make the sandwich and when it is done, open the sandwich and add the chips so that they would stay crunchy.  We tried two different grill cheeses tonight and split them.  Also had grilled Romaine, 'Greek Grilled Cheese' and 'Rob's Screaming Stuffed Jalapeño Poppers' from AR.

This is a very tasty sandwich.  If the bread is crispy enough it tastes just like a fried jalapeño popper.

I made this as directed and it was a hit at our house!  Definitely use the ciabatta bread.  Next time I would probably watch getting the cream cheese too warm... I nuked it to get it soft.

I wasn't sure what the crushed tortilla chips would add, but it gave it a nice crunch. I also highly recommend to smear some raspberry fruit spread on each bite or on top. This sandwich compares to the one at a very popular sandwich restaurant called melt grill.

Awesome recipe. I used round bolillo rolls (the kind used in Mexican tortas). To make this a little healthier, I used Greek yogurt in place of sour cream and low fat cream cheese (Neufchâtel). For the chips I subbed fat free crushed pretzels. Tasted just like a popper and my husband loved it. I did add twice as many jalapeños because we are jalapeño lovers.

One of the ladies posted in the Buzz that she was making this for dinner.  So, I rushed home at lunch time and made this for my lunch. All I can say is HEAVENLY!

We loved these! Left out the chips and added some fresh garden jalapenos (in addition to the pickled ones). My daughter is already asking me to make this again!

This was pretty good. I think the chips were unnecessary. They tasted kind of strange in it. Otherwise pretty delicious. Still could use a little more of a kick or something. I saw someone mention bacon. That could be good.
