Wonderful. I added some other veggies to this recipe and gave each veggie it's own layer for some colorful fun and deliberate taste differentiation. Guests enjoyed it very much. My only reccomendation is to let the veggies, especially the zucchini, drain a little after cooking them before adding them to the layers. If not they become TOO juicy and create a landslide on your plate when you try to serve the lasagna.

This recipe turned out to be fantastic. It was easy to prepare and tasted delicious. The noodles come out perfectly cooked, neither hard nor too soft, and the flavors are great. I followed the recipe exactly except that I substituted Barilla green & black olive pasta sauce for the Ragu sauce that was recommended in the recipe. My boyfriend and I both loved this, and we will definitely make it again!

Was very good as basic model. I changed a couple things to make it healthier: whole wheat pasta, low-fat cottage cheese (only one container), no mozzarella, egg-whites and a lot more veggies (broccoli, cauliflower, hot peppers, and spices...) The result is actually very tasty!

I had to make something for dinner that was good and quick, we had a contractor friend at our house doing some long awaited work so I wanted to make something good and hearty.  This recipe took some time to assemble (sauteeing and chopping), but turned out great.  I used zuchinni, squash and red onion, but you could use any veggies you like.  The consistency was perfect - not too saucy or dry.

Awesome recipe.  This was very easy and turned out perfect.  Next time I think I will add one more zucchini, one squash, and one more red pepper to plump up the veggie content.

I love this recipe!! I would give it five stars, but my family preferred the version I sometimes make with soy meat.  Personally, I like this best of all the lasagna recipes I've tried.

This lasagna is great! I have made it twice now and both times it came out fabulous. My husband said it was the best thing I have ever made! I added a lb. of mild sausage too with the red pepper, and zucchini mixture-phenomenal!! I also used my own sauce just out of preference but you can used canned too.

I must admit I did not use Ragu sauce, but it was delicious just the same.  I cut the recipe in half for just 2 people.  It was very yummy and my husband loved it too!

I got some frowns from my meat-loving man when I told him this was for dinner... but after the first bite he was thanking me.  I used different/more veggies, but other than that stuck to the recipe. I will make this again.

This was really good! I used fat free cottage cheese instead of ricotta because it is so much cheaper. I also used broccoli instead of red bell pepper.  This was my first successful experience making lasagna.  It all comes together very easily when you can use uncooked noodles.

This was the best veggie lasagna I have made.  I did make a few changes.  I used half ricotta cheese and half cottage cheese.  I also added some fresh spinach and garlic to the vegetable mixture.  It was so delicious and even the leftovers were great!! This is definitely a keeper.

I set my lasagna up a little differently.  I wanted make it a little healthier, so I used whole wheat pasta.  I also only used one container of part skim ricotta, and mixed up some defrosted frozen spinach squeezed dry to the cheese mixture to bulk it up.  The "bottom" layer was all the cheese mixture, and the "top" layer was all the sauteed veggies.  I made it ahead to reheat for a weeknight meal.

I'm eating leftovers and it's amazing!! I did half a recipe and only used 3 noodles in the bottom 2 layers, added spinach and substituted cottage cheese for the ricotta. Also works to put together the night before. Got great reviews from my guests and all the single guys took home leftovers!!

I cooked this wonderful recipe on Christmas Day for guest.  I omitted the zucchini since my husband abhors it and added in garlic.  IT WAS INCREDIBLE!!!  We ate the leftovers for two days and were sad to see them go! And we are not usually a fan of leftovers!  I would give it 10 stars if I could.

I was skeptical about the uncooked lasagna, but I tried it out anyways. It was wonderful! Noodles were cooked perfectly. I used one bottle of generic pasta sauce and a colby/cheddar cheese mixture, but those were the only changes. Otherwise, followed recipe exactly!

This is easy to modify by adding ground beef, zucchini, and onions.  I used Mom's pasta sauce from Costco and it was delicious!

I gave this 4 stars because it didn't come out completely right. Not sure if it was my fault or the zucchini (water vegetable?)  It was watery!! I followed the recipe exactly so I'm not sure what happened.  Overall it tasted delicious! I refrigerated the leftovers and that hardened the lasagna a little bit, but it seems like the Ricotta maybe caused too much water during cooking? Not sure.  I'll try this recipe again just to give it a second chance and because I like the idea of meatless lasagna.  Hopefully it will turn out better next time!

I didn't have a great experience with this recipe but I think I might have used inferior ingedients. I think it was the generic brand ricotta cheese that wasn't good.

This was my first attempt to make anything vegetarian and it was a great success!  I didn't even miss the meat!!  I did add an extra zucchini, used a red onion, and added mushrooms and a package of fresh spinach, all of which I drained after sauteing (sp?) to keep the lasagna from being too runny.  Also, I didn't need all of the cheese mixture as I was running out of room in the pan.  Super easy and everyone at my dinner party requested the recipe, even the meat-lovers!

At our last family gathering they all loved it and those who were not veggitarian were surprised to know that it was not missing any meat The recipe is very easy to follow but I did have a difficult moment  to evenly spread the ricotta cheese on the noodles.

I followed this receipe almost exactly, only I halved the recipe for six servings.  I did use a little more olive oil (about a tablespoon total) for sauteeing the veggies.  I used an 8 X11 casserole pan (2 noodles per layer and they fit well, once cooked)  Everything worked out perfectly.  I will definitely make this again.

I made and served this for company.  While it was ok, it wasn't as good as I'd hoped.  I've made no-bake veggie lasagnes before, but this one wasn't something special.

I've made this a few times now and it's a pretty good recipe.   One star missing for the sauce - sorry Ragu.   I make my own and that makes this a 5 star recipe.

This has become a staple.  We always put it together and let it sit overnight and then bake it the next night.  It seems to hold its form better and the tast is better.

This was great. My husband (who is a huge meat eater) preferred this lasagna to the one I make with meat! I didn't use the onions and added spinach to the ricotta mix. Next time I will add a bit more veggies.

I normally don't like meat lasagna, so I wanted to make something different.  I made this for dinner, and once word got out I was cooking, a bunch of friends came over for an impromptu dinner party.  They all raved about this dish, and I thought it was delicious!  I will definitely be making this again!  For veggies though, I used red and yellow bell pepper and onions.  Turned out great.
