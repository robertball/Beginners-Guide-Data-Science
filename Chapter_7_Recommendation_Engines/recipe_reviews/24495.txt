Some friends gave me a puchbowl fountain for Christmas. So I decided to christen it with this punch on New Year's Eve. This was refreshing and a very pretty colour. My guests enjoyed it. Many Thanks.

I served this at our last dinner party and it was a super hit to the extent that I only shipped it from my husband's glass who was not willing to share much...It was gone with in first hour of the party and was even loved by people who usually don't like alcoholic beverage unless its really good. I usually do not write reviews but I had to search for this recipe again because for this weekend party, guest have mentioned that they have heard good things about our punch.....humun...

I loved the title of this recipe and have wanted to make it for some time.  It was a lovely Mother's day drink.

I made this for a Halloween party and everyone said it was delicious. I will say, however, it isn't the most attractive color, especially with the floating strawberries BUT that's not really important, it tasted really good.

I served this at my wedding and my guest loved it. It was easy and inexpensive way to quench their thirst. Its also a pretty color. I served it in a punch fountain.
