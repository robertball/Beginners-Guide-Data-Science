This was not a good mix of ingredients...  it was very heavy, and if you are not careful it becomes greasy. only thing I changed was last min hubby ate my M&Ms so i used pieces of a Hersey's bar.

This turned out like chewing gum consistency and the m&m's would stick to the marshmallow mixture. Too bad, it sounded like it would be good, but it was not.

Marshmallows and peanut butter doesn't melt.  It hardens and is hard to eat.  I put on graham crackers, but the mixture ended up chewy in the end (tastes good, but not the texture I expected and wasn't all that particularly easy to make, as it is hard to stir).
