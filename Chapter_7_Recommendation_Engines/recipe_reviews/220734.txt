I made these more burger size. Added curry and pepper for flavour. Consistency was good. The held together perfectly. I didn’t use the wheat germ. I’d make them again!

These were not very good. They fell apart and were very bland.

I honestly thought this needed more flavor but loved the dipping sauce.  My little dog who currently has cancer and has a hard time eating ate 1 and a 1/2 so over all a win!

I really wanted to like these because my youngest son and I like falafel but they need some help in the flavor department. The sour cream and salsa  dip did help make them taste better, without itchy were pretty bleh. I did make these into tiny patties instead of leaving as balls.
