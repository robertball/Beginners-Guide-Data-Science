I grew up with this stuff - it's a dish that's like second nature to most Italians.  It's not really all that hot and it really shouldn't be - that's not supposed to be the point.  This recipe is wonderful and right on as is, however, mixing in some fresh chopped parsley at the last adds freshness and color.  But certainly add the garlic, oil and crushed red pepper to suit your own tastebuds, as Im sure the submitter would agree.  Tonight, just for something a little different,  I made this in the style of Cacio e Pepe - add some of the reserved pasta cooking water to the cooked spaghetti, then mix in some grated Parmesan or Romano cheese - what you want to achieve is a creamy sauce. If it is too watery, add more cheese - if too dry, add more of that beautiful, starchy pasta cooking water.  Just another delicious way to eat basic pasta...

Also known as Spaghetti e Aglio Olio e Peperoncini, this is one of my favorite pasta dishes! I recommend substituting a fresh, thinly-sliced red peperoncini (chili pepper) for the crushed red pepper; adding a few tablespoons of fresh, finely-chopped flat-leaf parsley (also known as Italian parsley); using a good, flavorful brand of olive oil; and using the best Parmigiano-Reggiano you can afford. Add the chili slices for the last minute or so to the hot garlic and oil, and add the chopped parsley when tossing the oil and pasta together. 

--In the past I have had the opportunity to sample this dish made with dry ingredients. However, preparing this dish with fresh ingredients makes it a stand-alone meal. All you need is a glass of Pinot Grigio and your favorite fresh bread. Mangiare bene!

Wonderful side dish!  I used 1/2 lb. of pasta and kept everything else the same.  I added 1 Tbsp. of butter, 2 Tbsp. of finely chopped flat leaf parsley and a little salt.  It doesn't get much better than this....

It was awesome.  I, of course, added more of the spices, some pepper, and some butter.  Loved it.  Add the butter, it makes it so much better.

This has quickly become a household favorite!  We like to add chopped tomato into the oil right before serving, and we serve it with grilled chicken.

My husband is Italian and grew up eating this.  This is one of his favorite dishes.  It makes a perfect side dish.  I made with grilled shrimp and asparaus.  I used FRESH grated parm cheese, do not use the stuff in the green bottle.  I cut the pasta in half and used angle hair.. very good!

What a fantastic little pasta dish!  So easy and so tasty.  It took no time at all and the Hubster and I both enjoyed the result.  I let it simmer for about 20-25 minutes to really let the red pepper release it's heat and the garlic to become a little more fragrant.  On low heat, you shouldn't have any problems with the garlic burning.  Be sure to use a very good extra virgin olive oil with a flavor that you love, as the olive oil is your main element in this simple and delicious pasta.  The garlic and red pepper simply add another level of yummy and the taste was perfect!  Thank you for sharing this treat!  :)

The basics of this dish are very good, however it came out kind of bland to me:  I used minced garlic because I had it on hand, and sauteed it in the olive oil with the red pepper and poured it over my pasta.  I'll admit I didn't have spaghetti so I used an elbow noodle, and cooked way too much so I doubled the sauce - and I could taste it but it was, again, bland.  So I added a can of cooked chicken, plenty of parmesan, and quite a bit of lemon juice (after a favorite lemon pepper pasta dish).  Delicious!  And easy - just enough heat with the recommended amount of red pepper!

Boring.  I served this with tortellini and peas, and it was still boring.  It's a good recipe when you're too lazy to make a trip to the grocery store, but that's about it.

This dish is very good & easy to make. I used to make this dish with sauteed sliced banana peppers from my garden,instead of the red pepper flakes, but this is easier. We like spicy food so I only used 1/2 lb. pasta. This did need a very light sprinkle of salt.          G.M.S. Amity, Pa.

This is my boyfriend's favorite recipe.  It's so easy, he even makes it himself!  After making it, we put it in the oven for 15-20 minutes to make the cheese bubbly.  Yum!

I love this recipe.  I had it in Miami on vacation and couldn't get enough of it.  I will eat it with some bread for a meal.  My husband doesn't finding it filling enough, so I will make it when he is working late and not home for dinner.

As written, I think there is too much pasta, so I cut the amount in half and used the same amount of sauce.  I also used half butter and oil, upped the red pepper to make it 'hot' (for those who avoid spicy foods, this isn't that spicy.  I don't care for too much heat and I enjoyed it even after adding more).  I also added some parsley.  This made a great side dish, thanks.

The parmesan overpowered the crushed red paper and it just became dry and bland.  I think the measurements are off.  This might work with less spaghetti, but as is it doesn't.

Talk about memories! I first had this dish about 50 years ago as a young airman. I was stationed at Wheelus Air Force Base with the Armed Forces Radio in Tripoli, Libya. Our old station manager, Tom De Castro, would fix tons of the stuff every Friday evening and we'd spend the evening listening to sports events coming in via shortwave. For a couple of bucks he could feed  the radio staff and the news department! And there was always that fantastic wine we'd smuggle in from Italy. Cal

Yummy!  I made this with wheat pasta because that is all we had on hand and it was still delicious.  The only change I made was to add a couple more garlic cloves than it called for (about 5, I think).  Quick and delicious.

My  mom gave me this recipe and we adults love it at my house. As is, is fantastic. If you want to make a meal out of it, we take frozen cooked shrimp, thaw and peel tail off, then throw in with the garlic and oil about 5 minutes before we mix in the noodles. We like to experiment with different spices to make it new and exciting every time.

This was a nice change - I certainly enjoyed and will make again.  I had left over egg noodles and was STARVING (grin).  Whipped this up in like 5 minutes, tossing the cold noodles into the pan under very hot heat.  Noodles got nice and crunchy (yum) - the heat from the red pepper was fantastic when served with a nice cold salad.  I thoroughly ejjoyed.

Very yummy. I used ground red pepper and I should have put more in than I did. I upped the amount of butter just a little and ultimately only used a 1/2 lb of spaghetti. I enjoy extra sauce. I also added an extra clove of garlic (minced) as well because I love it. I salted it too and added in some parsley as others suggested.

Love it!  I couldn't stop myself from eating 2 servings and I'm looking forward to leftovers. The only thing I did differently was to add some extra garlic, and I served the oil mixture on the side so everyone could use as much or as little as they wanted.  As others recommended I let the oil, garlic, and pepper simmer for 20+ minutes.  Fantastic!

This is so good and simple, I can't believe that I didn't think of it earlier.  The best part of this recipe is that I always have all of the ingredients in my pantry, so if I don't feel like grocery shopping this will be my go to recipe.  It tastes best with parmesan reggiano, but still tastes really good with cheap kraft parmesan cheese.

I can't even say how many times I've made and eaten this pasta...it's sooo good! I pretty much just eye-ball everything to taste, and sometimes add a little salt if I think it needs it. This is tasty as a main course with a nice salad and garlic bread or as a side to pretty much anything! It's also a great go-to recipe if you are short on time or cash. Definately one to have in the recipe file! Thanks for sharing. :)

This is a great base to start with.  I like to add ground pepper and a little bit of butter.  Also, if you want to try a meat with it, chopped Chorizo goes great with this dish and gives it an extra kick.

I made a few changes, but loved this recipe! I used the suggestion of another reviewer and substited penne in place of spaghetti. I used 1/8 cup olive oil & 1/8 cup Smart Balance spread, just to add a bit of buttery flavor, but keep it healthy. Then at the last minute, I realized I had a package of fresh mushrooms that I needed to use, so I sauteed the mushrooms & tossed them in with the pasta. Yummmmmmm!!!!

This was the "Italian can't eat meat on Friday dish or the "Basic Italian everything in the house dish" I make it all the time, order it out in Italian restuarants that I know I am sitting at an Italian table.  My Italian friends laugh and say this is the "poor mans dish"  poor or not it is a wonderful dish.  Make it with Penne, broccoli and holds all the flavors better than spaghetti.  This is my favorite Italian dish.  Basic..

I've been making a version of this for quite some time.  To notch it up a degree or two I add toasted pine nuts, sun dried tomatoes, onion, capers and sometimes quartered artichoke hearts to the olive oil mix.  It's the best quick fix meal!

I have used this recipe for years..the only thing I do differently is saute a few fillets of anchovy in the olive oil.  It doesn't add a fishy taste..just a slight addition of salt..I also serve it with a tomato stuffed with a simple crab salad of mayo, crushed black olives, onion and the tomato meat that I scooped out..helps even out the palate.

This was very easy and very tasty. I cut the recipe in half and still had rather a lot for two people. I could barely taste the red pepper, and I am pretty sensitive to spicy foods. I also had to leave off the parmesan, discovering at the last minute that I was out. Still a great recipe, thanks for sharing!

I added a couple handfuls of frozen broccoli & shrimp to the pasta as it cooked. Also added 1 tsp dried basil to the oil. A very quick & easy dish to make at the last minute.

This is my absolute favourite food of all. I add salt & pepper and some fresh grated nutmeg to the pan with the oil, garlic and chilies to heat up jusst as I'm about to drain off my pasta. I toss it in and let the flavours mingle and then after I plate it I top it with an abundance of fresh grated parmesean. There is no other way to do it. Dried parm is nowhere near the same as fresh. If you want to make it into an alfredo just melt in some butter and then some cream and heat through. Fresh parsley is wonderful and try adding capers and chopped olives and shrimp etc. This is a dish you can be creative with.

Holy cow this was much hotter than anticipated! And I should have anticipated it given the name of the recipe!  This was such a pleasant surprise, and I will certainly make it often.  Made as written except I used angel hair pasta as that was what I had on hand.

SO GOOD.  I typically halve or quarter this recipe, and it's still great.  I also like to keep a cup of the starchy cooking water and stir a little bit of that in to loosen the mixture, especially helpful as the cheese starts to melt.  I also add a little more salt and lots of fresh cracked black pepper, and it's perfect!

This came out as a very tasty side dish. I used an herb-infused olive oil and kind of wished I had used butter instead, but that would really have made this into a totally different recipe (as butter would tone down the heat from the crushed red pepper). I served this underneath AR's "Chicken and Herbs" by Judy Sargent with a side salad & this was a nice dinner. Thanks for the recipe!

I am giving this 4 stars as I thought it was just ok. I made it exactly as stated except I added half a bag of frozen diced veggies to the pasta as it was boiling. I also found it to be both oily yet dry. I will try it again and try to figure out some way to make it a bit more saucy.

This is a basic recipe---coming from a Italian family my mom made it with other added ingredients-- For this much oil try adding 2 cans of anchovies with the garlic and cook until the anchovies get pasty--added Italian flavored bredcrumbs till the oil gets sopped up but not to dry--- Never have tried the red pepper with this--cheese can be sprinkled on top if you like-- My brother-in-law--who is not Italian loves thsi--and many years ago--my mom made for his Navy buddies--who were definately not Italian--went nuts over this---

This is a very good basic recipe, thank you Kathleen. Anyone with a little experiance will be able to add or alter to please their own family tastes. I added more garlic, onoins, mushrooms, and cajun seasoning and we made this into a one dish meal. We loved it.

This is a regular dish at my house, but with a few additions to make it a balanced meal. When the pasta is almost done, I throw a bag of frozen broccoli and about 2 cups of thawed frozen pre-cooked shrimp with the tails removed. Drain, toss it all with the oil mixture and top with parm. Delicious and impressive enough for company... If they don't mind it hot!hot!hot!

These weren't bad... I used ground cayenne pepper, since I didn't have flakes, and I don't think I added enough. The leftovers weren't as good as the noodles were the first time around. Either way, it was a nice change.

Was excited by the good reviews-but a bit disappointed-was OK and nothing I'll probably make again. Not enough sauce to cover pasta well and did not have much taste.

I thought this was good, but I think it needed a can of diced tomatoes. Perhaps I just felt like I needed more of a "sauce." I also doubled the amount of olive oil and red pepper cos it didn't seem like enough for the amount of noodles. Overall though, this was a good quick meal.

This is my all-time favorite recipe from this site!  Simple to prepare and great flavor.  Love the kick, just too good to put down!  Have even added a little feta sometimes.

This is like the aglio e olio I get at my favorite italian restaurant (Cant remember how to spell that now, but thats close enough)  I really like this a lot.  After making this many many times I can say without a doubt that you need to watch the heat, nothing worse than burnt garlic and let it simmer awhile so the flavor of the garlic comes out.  And fresh ground Parmesan is awesome!

So easy. So good. My 5 year old asks for this at least once a week. You can add more or less spice to suit your tastes. I've also added a little onion or whatever here and there. So many add in possibilities.

This has become a staple when I'm short on time and ingredients! It's DELICIOUS just how it is, and I've also made some varieties: Toss in a chopped tomato just after the garlic; add a chicken breast or shrimp; or if you really need meat and don't feel like cooking any, slice up a piece of deli ham and put some slivers on top of each serving. I've made it with all different kinds of pasta, tri-color rotini is my favorite so far because it looks nice and really picks up the sauce. Yum yum my husband and I love this!!

Really good stuff. For so few ingredients it turned out really great. I crushed my garlic and threw it in with the EVOO (that way I could pick it out later). I wanted a bit of a crunch so I crushed up some croutons and mixed them in. Delicious!

To spice it up, I used 4 garlic cloves, with 1 tsp Oregano, 1 tsp basil and 2 tsps crushed red pepper in olive oil. Instead of using spagetti, I used fusilli. After adding the pasta to the olive oil mixture I added Maggi hot n sour chilli sauce as otherwise the pasta was dry and added about 1 1/2 tsps of salt.

This was fantastic! I used a heaping measure of the crushed red pepper and more garlic than called for since we love garlic. Everyone loved this side dish. (Hubby is wanting to make this again adding some shrimp scampi on top). I could have eaten this just as it is for a meal. Thanks!!!

yum yum yum yum yum! I added about 2 Tbsp butter, some oregano, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp pepper, and about 1 extra tsp of crushed red pepper to the garlic, EVOO mix. Also threw some Italian bread crumbs onto the pasta. The parmesan is key. This was SO good! I'm going to try it with the marinated grilled shrimp from this site, which is also amazingly good!

This recipe wasn't what I was expecting. It was very bland. I had to add salt and pepper to it for it to be seasoned. Once the salt and pepper was added, it was still just okay. I served it with chicken breast I pan seared with lemon pepper seasoning and garlic bread. Overall it was edible, but I don't think I'll make it again. It wasn't a very memorable recipe.

Love this! I make it w/ diced garlic, butter, salt, pepper, crushed red pepper. Then over the pasta I sprinkle bread crumbs before pouring the hot oil. It adds a little crunch to the pasta. Serve w/ salad and maybe garlic bread, yumm! I'm addicted right now!

This was a good basic recipe, but I added more ingredients to suit my taste. I added some tomatoes, red peppers, green peppers, left over grilled jerk chicken, and some cajun seasoning. I also used whole grain pasta. It was delicious this way. I'm afraid it would be a bit bland if I would have followed the recipe.

This was a spicy flavorless pasta.  If you add additional ingredients it can be good but then it's not the recipe.  I think I'll keep looking for a pasta dish that's good as is.

Add a little lemon juice, a few leaves of chopped basil and you've got one heck of a meal. I also added grilled chicken to the meal by chopping it into bite size pieces and mixing it in with the spaghetti. For an even lighter fare, try Rozini brand noodles for an extra fiber kick

This was so-o-o good! Hubby said give it a 4 star....I say 5 star.  Only problem I found was that the Hot! Hot! Hot! really wasn't so Hot!  Next time this Texas gal will add more Crushed Red Pepper!  I did add butter like another reviewer stated.  I just couldn't stop eating it!  Thanks, Kathleen for a great recipe!  Will make this simple recipe over and over again.

Im giving this recipe four stars because it required a lot of change to suit my tastes.  So here is what I did, and I love it! 1/4 cup of olive oil, 5 or 6 large cloves of garlic, 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes, salt and fresh ground black pepper. I mixed it all together and baked in the oven until the cloves were soft and browning.  Then I poured it all into my Magic Bullet blender and pureed it. From the blender into the frying pan, where I used the mix to sautee half a white onion and then some chicken breast.  Once the chicken was cooked, I added a large can of diced tomatoes.  Heated it through and let it simmer while the water boiled and the pasta cooked.  The longer it simmers the better it will taste.  After the pasta was cooked I threw it into the pan with the sauce and mixed it all up.  Let it sit for a bit and then serve with fresh parmesan on top! Soooo good!!!

Great simple recipe.  Tastes just like a dish that Spaghetti Warehouse serves!  However, I didn't really taste the red pepper, so if you're a fan, I would recommend adding more.  I added a can of well drained Italian diced tomatoes at the end and heated them through, which added a nice little extra.  Great recipe! Thanks for sharing.

Easy! Quick! Flavorful!  Oh so much better than boring spaghetti sauce!
Will be a staple menu item from now on.

This recipe is so quick, easy, and best of all, versatile, since it easily goes from a sidedish to a maindish with the addition of whatever suits your taste.  When our older son moved out, he requested a copy of this recipe to take with him.  Thanks!

This is one recipe I always use with spaghetti, fettuccini, and angel hair pasta. It tastes great with alfredo, meat or just about any sauce. If eating alone, I usually substitute the parmesan cheese for a tad bit of ranch or ceasar dressing. Yum!

This recipe is a winner as written or enhanced. I like to slice an Italian sausage or kielbasa and brown in garlic & oil but chicken, shrimp, whatever you prefer is suitable. I generally don't measure anything now just add to taste. I also followed another posters recommendation to add breadcrumbs, which I had never thought of. I just use whatever I have, put it in a zip lock bag & crunch with the back of a spoon & sprinkle over the top. I love the crunch.

Like others said, it’s a little bland on its own.  However, it makes a great base. I added a touch of butter, mushrooms, white wine, diced yellow onion and Tony Chachere’s seasoning and chicken. Yum!

Hubby and I tried it and loved it!  The only changes we made were we used whole wheat linguine pasta and minced garlic (what we had on hand).  Definitely recommend!

Do add some minced fresh flat-leaf ("Italian") parsley, off the heat, when tossing the oil with the spaghetti. (And add ground black pepper at the table.) But, frankly, as an entrée, this recipe will likely leave the inveterate meat-eaters at your table unsatisfied. They may only enjoy it as a side dish. It's a wonderful meal for carboholics, though!

I made it - it's all good.
Subsequently I added capers, Kalamata olives and a wee rosemary.
Next time I'll garnish with some torn Basil.... : > ))

I made this with roasted garlic and parsley linguine as a side. I took the advise of other reviewers and added 1tbls of butter. Other than that I followed the recipe. The whole family thought it was awesome. Subtle flavor from each ingredient and not at all greasy like some oil based pastas. Extremely quick and easy. Would highly recommended and will definitely make again.

Love this. I only reduced the amount of oil because I just prefer less, and I added a tablespoon of butter for more flavor.

I know "hot" is in the title, X3, but this was HOT.  I end to to love hot, while Mr. LTH is a bit of a heat sissy.  I knew, first bite, he wouldn't be able to stomach this.  Despite the heat, I just wasn't feeling the other flavors, either, surprisingly.   I prefer Chef John's broccoli pasta recipe (plus some crushed red) for a pasta side.  Thanks for the recipe!

It needs some color if I'm going to serve it to guests.  I used some oil from a jar of sun dried tomatoes I had and sprinkled with parsley.  The flavor is simple, but good.

This was an excellent easy recipe.  I am trying to cook low cholesterol meals and this one is a keeper.  I did make a couple adjustments to the recipe.  I decided to use 1 bag of "no yolk" egg noodles and I doubled the sauce, added a little more garlic and red pepper.  I also added about 1 lb of shrimp to the sauce while it was heating and poured it over the entire batch of egg noodles.  It turned out perfect with the right amount of sauce for 12 oz bag of noodles.  I used parmesan cheese on the top and it was perfect!  Loved it :)

This is a good and quick side dish. I will start making this more often. I made a whole box of linguine noodles for a separate dish and ended up only needing half of the box. So, this was a good way to use up the rest of the noodles.

Easy & Quick! I used butter instead of olive oil as suggested, but next time I will cut the amount in 1/2. It was way too "greasy" for my pallet. Other than that- it was a fantastic quick side dish to our fish! :)

So easy and very tasty. The only addition I made was to add some shrimp to the garlic and oil mixture. Cooked shrimp until pink (about 2 minutes) then added to the noodles.

I had really high hopes for this one but it wasn't all the great.  I thought it was pretty good when I add some more parm and garlic salt.  I don't like salt much but this one needed it!

I made this exactly as per the recipe, I thought it was great, would have given it 4.5 if I could, although my husband gave it only a 3 (said the flavour was ok but just wasn't crazy about it overall).  I found it perfectly coated and just the right spicy for me.  Would be great with a grilled cajun chicken breast or something.  Will definetely make this again (when hubby is not home for dinner).  Thanks for the great recipe : )

I loved it.  I have, in the past had variations of this recipe but I like this one.  Growing up in an Italian family my mom made it with anchovies in the oil with the garlic and pepper.  A bit too strong for me.  Loved your recipe, good job!!  :) (if you do choose to do it with the anchovies they do dissolve and make it more spicy and yummy, I just personally dont like that)

A great, fast recipe that can be made with stuff I usually keep on hand, and a welcome change from tomato sauce or alfredo sauce.  I added a little more red pepper though, because I like it spicy.  Perfect, thanks!

This is so fast to to make, and tastes GREAT!  I made it over the weekend, for my boyfriend and his mother.  It was such a hit, she asked to take the leftovers home!  I was proud.  You'll love this dish.

We were a little disappointed in the lack of flavor.  Mine seemed a bit bland.  I will try again though and add a few more spices.

At our house, we call this "Valentines Day Pasta" because I made this for my love on valentines day circa 2005.  This meal is so GOOD and SO easy that it is Valentines Day at least once a month at my house.    I make this with whole wheat pasta, a hearty side of veggies, and grilled chicken chopped into bite size peices.

This is a very light, great tasting pasta dish! I have made this multiple times and I just love it.  My husband, however, likes something a little more filling, oh well!  I continue to make this for me!

This recipe was very good with some diced tomatoes and green peppers. I also added a little more olive oil. One thing I would not recomend is adding more than a pinch more ground chilies(ground red peppers) unless your a major fan of hot food. Overall though this is an excellent base recipe That I will be using again!

I probably shouldn't rate this yet (and it might go down as the dumbest review!) but I burnt the garlic and I didn't have fresh parmesan - only canned. I guess I'm wanting to say to watch the garlic or maybe put it in a couple minutes before you're ready to serve it because it's hard to simmer garlic without burning it. Or maybe that's some lost art that I haven't perfected! Will try it again because it sounds like it would taste really good!

Very quick and delicious.  I made it for a light lunch and was pleased with the results.  I did add another small clove of garlic, was pretty generous with the red pepper, and used farfalle pasta instead of spaghetti...great for those don't want to cook days!

As I ate this dish the flavor changed from being subtle to being bolder and spicier with each bite. This dish is delicious.  This recipe is very easy to make and quick, I had all of the ingredients in my house (I used rotini rather that spagetti and it was great)  Not sure if kids would like it, it might be too spicy.
