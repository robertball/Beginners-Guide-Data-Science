We liked these! I opted to make my own egg less cookie dough b/c the tube at the store said not to eat it raw, and I didn't want to chance giving that to the kids. My only advice is to be careful when sandwiching the dough in between the two pretzels, b/c the pretzels are pretty fragile and break easily. Other than that, they were fun to make and tasty! Thanks for sharing. :)

Finally, a recipe that gives me permission to eat cookie dough! I love the salty sweet flavor of this little delight. Instead of using chocolate chips, I dipped these cookie dough pretzel crisps in Wilton's Candy Melts only because I prefer the taste of the candy melts over chocolate chips. A fun little dessert thats really easy to put together.

We actually liked these more than I thought we would.   I  used the "break and bake " cookie dough,  smooshing it a bit to fit the pretzels.  I plan on trying different cookie dough flavors and different flavors of chips (butterscotch,  peanut butter ).  Thanks for the recipe, Snack Factory!

Salty, sweet, soft & crispy all at the same time! Definitely let your cookie dough soften a good bit before trying to put these together.
