This was so easy and tasty!  My daughter loved it! I did use minced garlic (we love it!) about 2 tablespoons, and I used 2 tablespoons of worsterchire sauce too!  Omitted the mushrooms- not our taste!  I also used a Prego Traditional spaghetti sauce.  I would have used tomato sauce if I had it, just used what I had!  The ingredients all came together and made a VERY tasty meal!

Very good and simple to make. My 3 yr old loved it and so did my husband. I used rainbow rotini since we had it on hand and went ahead and mixed the sauce with the noodles before serving it. I also sprinkled some salad seasoning and tossed it before serving. Everyone loved it! Thanks so much!

Perfect for our snowy night, thanks!  I didn't have mushrooms and the 'gunk' was too thick without the juice so I added some water.  I'm not sure which my kids liked more, the meal or the name!

I made this last night and my husband just loved it. We are also big fans of garlic so of course I had to use more. When I added the tomato paste and also added 6 ozs of warm water to it, to make it thinner.I served it over egg noodles. With a infant at home, this is a quick and easy recipe and doesnt take that much time. Thanks for the recipe...

Too Funny! LMAO! I had to work over-time (12 hours) and came home not knowing what to make for supper.  So I looked into my "certain" file on AL and made this.  When I was asked what's for supper, I told them. Everyone thought that was funny.  This turned out very good, even though I was "brain-fried" from being at work for 12 hours.

We thought this one was very good! Easy weeknight meal. We thought the meat mixture was very similar to sloppy joes, and it worked well on the pasta. Some parmesan cheese on top might be a nice touch.

Excellent recipe. A very basic and easy way to fix a good meal. I used leftover fresh mushrooms instead of canned and added a small amount of water. Husband loved it.

My husband is a picky eater & loved this. I did leave the mushrooms out though & added a little more water so it wasn't so thick. I will definitely make it again - very quick & easy.

Quick, easy & the kind of comfort food we love! I omitted the mushrooms as I didn't have any on hand & I doubled the recipe. The sauce turned out thick, so I'll add liquid next time I make it. So good & it's a keeper!!

Quick & easy! We don't care for mushrooms, so I skipped those & added some water and a little oregano. Very tasty!
