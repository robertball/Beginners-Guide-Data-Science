I Made this pie and it looked like a picture when it came out of the oven. After it cooled I decided to try a piece as I had made 3 of them and 1 was going to my brothers for Thanksgiving. Something is very wrong with this Recipe. The sugar content is way way too high. I may try it again but will use less than half of what it calls for in sugar.I think GrandMa didn't like her Daughter inlaw and tried to put the Grand Kids into a sugar rush.

This is a recipe I got from a friend of the family years ago.  I had lost it and was glad to find it here.  My recipe had two small differences.  I didn't see that they changed the taste THAT much, I just don't like a lot of eggs.  The two differences are: is I use 4 eggs, instead of 5, and I mix two tablespoons of flour with the sugar.  This is a great easy recipe.  Thanks for posting.

Incredible!  I changed a few things to my own liking, but overall the same (if that makes sense).  I pre-baked my pie crusts.  (brush frozen pie crust with butter, prick crust to prevent bubble, bake as directed on pkg) I also reduced sugar to 1 1/2 cups, increased vanilla to 1/2 tablespoon, instead of using a whole pkg of coconut, I placed a couple handfuls into the bottom of the baked pie crust, then poured the filling over the top.  I baked it for 20 min @ 400, then reduced heat to 350 and baked the remaining time.  Perfection!

Everyone loves this pie.  I get requests for it all the time.  The only thing I do different is instead of buttermilk, I use 3/4 milk with 1 tablespoon lemon juice (real please).  Let it sit for at least 5 minutes, then mix in.  Wonderful!

i had to bake this 15-20 minutes more because i was waiting for the "golden" color. i used fresh coconut meat and did not shred nor cut them at all.  perhaps that was the cause of the extra baking time. anyway, the cake was delicious... especially when chilled... but the "custard" looked a little too much like scrambled eggs. it didn't taste like it, but i couldn't get past the look. sorry, grandma; i'll look for another simple recipe.

After years of making these I lost the piece of paper with the recipe on it. This is the only way to make these. I see a lot of recipes that call for flour in the mixture and I shudder to think what that would do to the custardy texture. My husband could not stop eating them.

I was going to make these pies for a church bake sale. I followed the directions to the letter, yet the filling turned out to be greasy lumps of coconut! I ended up throwing them away. What did I do wrong?

This was a very dielicious pie! Flaky on top- and not overly sweet. I threw in a few chopped pecans that I had left over (about 1/2 cup) and it turned out great!

AMAZING!  I made the recipe as it states, except I made a homemade crust from graham crackers and macadamia nuts.  It was a HIT!

This was delicious!!! I took it to a Easter party we had at my families house and everyone loved it!  My Grandma even told someone she didn't think I made it...she thought I had bought it from someone!  This will be a recipe I continue to make for years to come! Thanks!

Veerrry good. Makes two nummy pies in no time at all. My younger brother loves coconut pie, and he could barely wait for these to cool before eating some. The smell while they were baking was wonderful. We did agree that they could be a little creamier though. All in all, a very good recipe. Will defenetly bake these again. They would be wonderful for potlucks, as it is a fast way to make two wonderful pies.

These pies are amazing!  We all loved how the coconut that rises to the top is so chewy.  We did not thing it was too sweet, in fact that was one of the things we liked about it.  Just coconut goodness.

My pie never did set up.  Very runny and I cooked an extra 30 minutes.  Top was a beautiful golden brown but I have no idea what happened as I followed the recipe to the letter.  Also, I do think it has too much butter and sugar.
