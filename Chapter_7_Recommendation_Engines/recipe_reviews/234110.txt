DELICIOUS! I had some ricotta cheese to use up, and stumbled upon this little gem. Though I've never made homemade ravioli, I thought I'd make these and freeze them for another time, but, of course, I had to boil a few to taste and they were excellent! After cooking the sausage and allowing it to cool, I chopped it fine and mixed it with the other ingredients, also adding a bit of garlic powder and parm. cheese. Also, after seeing how much filling was there, I decided to double the dough recipe and that worked out great (I actually think I could've tripled it, as there was still some filling leftover), but I will know for next time. Remember to allow the dough to 'rest'...I let it set, covered, for about an hour, and that made the dough so soft and pliable. I rolled the dough out using a pasta machine, which made this super quick. Though mine did not look like the photo on the recipe, these were awesome and I can't wait to eat the rest. I think they will be great w/ an alfredo sauce~YUM!!!!! These are a keeper...Thanks for sharing. :)
