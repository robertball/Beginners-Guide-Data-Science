Made these for the first time for the 4th of July. They are amazing. I put them in the freezer after the peanut butter layer, until the peanut butter was hard enough to apply the frosting.  I micro waved the frosting so it spread easily. They thawed quickly and were a gigantic hit. I will make these again.

I have now made these twice, and both times were amazing!  Both times, I have followed the recipe exactly (except that the first time I used wheat flour instead of all-purpose, and it did not make any difference).  I only have 2 notes to add: first, I have found that the pb only needs 30 seconds in microwave to soften enough to spread, and second that I recommend sifting the coco and the powdered sugar that goes into the frosting.  It makes little lumps, which isnt bad with the powdered sugar, but not that nice to have a bitter taste of coco!  These ones are definitely worth the time and effort, and I will make them many times more!

Delicious! My family was upset that I only made one batch. I will be making more of these soon!

I probably shouldn't review this because I simply baked a box of D.H. brownie mix and used the PB and chocolate marshmallow icing per this recipe.  The result was very good but if I do this again I will make only half the choc. marshamallow.

They are really good, just a little too sweet. I would suggest less icing on top. (And a flat pan to cook in otherwise the batter will pool in one end lol)

Chocolate topping was flavorless and a clumpy tapioca consistency; it was disgusting. I pitched it and I took the brownies and I made a different topping from a different recipe since I hadnâ€™t put it all together yet.

I followed the directions as written and the brownies came out perfect but the frosting was way too much and it just pooled on the top. It didn't set even after I let it sit in he fridge for more than 30 min or even after I put it in the freezer for another 20 min. I love peanut butter and chocolate together but I thought that the recipe was too see with too much peanut butter. If I ever do this recipe again , I'll make sure to make a thin layer of pb (maybe half of what it calls for) and the frosting too. I'll make half of what the frosting calls for too or just look up another chocolate frosting recipe to replace this frosting. The only part I liked about this recipe was the brownie part they came out nice. I topped it with Reese pieces to make it look nice but it came out looking sad since it was kinda watery. :(

I made the bottom layer as the recipe stated.  I mixed the peanut butter with graham cracker crumbs both for texture and how can you have chocolate and marshmallow without graham?  I used a sleeve of crackers and about 1 1/3 c peanut butter.  About a half recipe of icing except 7 marshmallows.  The verdict?  Yummy:).  We will make them again.
