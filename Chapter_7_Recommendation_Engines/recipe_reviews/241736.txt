Great recipe! Followed the directions the first time around and is an overall great recipe. The second time around I didn’t brown the beef. I just threw it in the crockpot uncooked and let the crockpot do the cooking. I just cooked it a little longer and was just as good. Third time around the hubby and I didn’t have the kids so I chopped up a few jalapeños for some extra heat and it was great!

Very good chili, easy to make. The only thing I would cut back on would be the brown sugar. It gives a very faint sweet taste, which I personally do not care for. Next time perhaps I will either skip it, or cut it down to 1/8 cup.  Overall it is a tasty recipe!

I'm not even a fan of chili but this was amazing. Didn't put any BBQ sauce though.

I was looking for a super simple chili recipe and this was it. I can’t cook but even I could prepare this! I used 2 pounds ground beef, added onion & green pepper and bloomed the salt free chili spice packet into the beef after browned. Then added tomato paste to mix to allow flavor to develop. Added a dash of smoked paprika before putting in a slow cooker liner bag and adding rest of ingredients. Added extra 30 minutes high cooking time to compensate for liner bag. Turned out surprisingly well. Topped with sour cream, cheddar cheese & chopped green onion.

Made this yesterday and it was wonderful! I put it in the crock pot and left it on low until hubby got home. Cooked for about 8 hours and it was more that ready. I will use this recipe for our office pot luck. Thanks for the recipe!

I almost followed the recipe exactly. I had a bit more onion than what recipe calls for. I also cut brown sugar in half because another reviewer thought 1/4 cup was too much. I used 3 different types of Bush’s chili beans, red, kidney and black. Chili came out great. My kids loved it. We had it with cheese and tortilla chips. Great leftovers for the week!

I have made this before exactly as the recipe calls for it was simple and easy with great flavor. But this time I used left over turkey from Thanksgiving and used 3 different kinds of beans, the modified recipe was excellent.

I followed the recipe exactly until I got to the part that called for 3 cans of chili beans.  I thought this was way too many beans, so I left  that 3rd can out.    In my personal opinion, this recipe tastes like Hormel from a can with sugar in it.    I agree that  it is too sweet with a 1/4 cup of brown sugar also.
I will not make it again.

I added some extra ground beef to this recipe but followed everything else exactly. I thought this chili was delicious! I had plenty of leftovers for later meals. I would definitely make this again!

I made this exactly as written.  After three hours in the slow cooker on high, the onions were still crunchy so I kept cooking it.  After four hours, the onions were still crunchy, and I had diced them fairly small.  If you brown your ground beef before assembling in the slow cooker, then I recommend that you also cook the onions with the beef.  If, as others suggested, you just put the ground beef in the slow cooker, then note that you will have to cook this longer than 4 hours on high for the onions to soften.  I tend to agree with other reviewers that you could cut back on the brown sugar as this chili is a bit sweet, but not so sweet that it is unpleasant.  Overall, we liked this recipe.

The title pretty much says it all.   This is the easiest chilli I've ever made and as it turns out, one of the tastiest.   Other than browning the ground beef you just open the containers and dump it in the crockpot, stir to mix and set on high for 3 hours.   It comes out thick, and mildly spicy.   I didn't add the brown sugar or the barbecue sauce and don't regret it a bit.

Amazing!  I used 1/8 cup of BBQ sauce.   Used the Aldi's family pack of ground turkey (I think it is 2-2.5 lbs).  Used a can of diced tomatoes and 1 small can of green chilies instead of Rotel.

It was really good. Very basic, a good starter chili. I didn't use the chili seasoning packet it called for so I just added cumin, chili powder, and cayenne little by little to taste. Super simple to fix and forget so you can come home to a comforting hot meal on a cold night!

I have made this easy and delicious recipe twice now. My sweetheart is a little bit of a chili snob and makes his own yummy chili but he loved this. The only thing I had to do was add chili powder. And a little bit of Texas Pete. Perfect! Thank you.

I used ground turkey instead of beef. My family looooved it! They like putting this over top of some white rice.

This is my second time making it for a family of 4. Having 3 teens, I doubled the recipe and used two crockpots. The first pot is empty the first meal so they get left overs for the next day. My son has it for breakfast. Great recipe! I use brown sugar BBQ sauce in mine.

Really good with a mild heat. I used .75 lbs bison and 1.25 beef. Also, I used a Carolina style BBQ and it worked out really well.
