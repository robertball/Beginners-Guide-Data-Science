I steamed the cauliflower in the microwave it the bowl I prepared it in. I also cut the recipe in half and microwaved the whole thing. It turned out very good.

Was yummy but I think I would like it better without the bacon! Bacon seemed to be the main flavor (which my husband liked!) and was a little overpowering in my opinion. Maybe I added too much(don’t measure everything-lol). Wish the fiber content would have been listed in the nutrition facts so we could figure our total carbs. Added fresh basil which gave it a nice flavor. Will definitely make again. EASY!!

Everybody loved it. My only suggestion would be to double the recipe because there was none left.

This was excellent. A little greasy from the mayo but still excellent. Leftovers held up nicely as well which is always a plus when you are cooking for two.
