Hubby loved these and requested they go in the keeper file.  The recipe definately calls for too much wine though.  I seasoned the scallops with some garlic salt and pepper and added some Parmesan cheese to the topping mixture.  Thanks for the recipe!

I loved this recipe.  It was fast and delicious.  The only change I made was adding chopped fresh basil as a sub for the parsley (I had a bumper crop of basil this year).  I served this with rice and roasted broccoli.

I would increase the pecans, decrease the wine and broil for the last 1-2 minutes. Easy and good though!

I enjoyed the recipe very much.  I didn't have everything on hand so changed it a bit.  Instead of crackers I used 1/2 panko crumbs and 1/2 italian bread crumbs.  I did not have lemon juice so I sprinkled lemon pepper.  I put some maple syrup in with the melted better for touch of sweet.  Very good receipe to play around with.

Great and simple recipe for a busy work night!  These turned out great and pretty good for you.  I used wheat crackers instead.  I would cut down on the amount of wine used as I had to poor some out of the baking pan.  Tasted great!

This was a great dish, however I used several substitutions due to not having some of the ingredients the recipe called for.  I first changed the servings to 2.  I didn't have white wine, so instead I used diluted apple cider vinegar (50 vin/50 h2o).  I used half pecans/half hazelnuts, half wheat thin crumbs/half plain bread crumbs.  I also mixed in 1 TS of honey with the melted butter before drizzling it on top.  The topping turned out to be sweet, but it was not overpowering. Sweet is not something I usually think of when it comes to seafood, but this was mmMM delicious!

Recipe is very good and easily adaptable to other ingredients. For example other types of nuts rather than pecans and any type of crackes. I used triskets, but watch the salt as they are salty. I also marinated the scallaps for 30 minutes in a combination of juice and seasonings that we like.

They were great but I did put them under the broiler for a few minutes after baking.

I truly enjoy scallops but I didn't love this recipe.  I used Ritz crackers - I didn't have any pecans so I substituted walnuts which I don't think was a good idea.  I also added parmesan cheese to the topping as one reviewer suggested.  
When I took it out of the oven and tasted it, it was very bland.  I added alot of granulated garlic and about a tablespoon of butter which helped.  
It was just ok...wish I could have left 5 stars.

Although I like all the ingredients I thought it tasted bland, and I'm usually one who likes it a little more on the simple side.

Very good! Easy. Substituted Panko bread crumbs and omitted wine. Next time I will use crackers for more depth of flavor. I recommend this recipe in its  original form ??

Since imitation scallops (similar to imitation crab) are now available I wanted serve them for my church fish fry. I used my deer hunt buddies as a focus trial group. The modifications:
1. The imitation scallops are the size of bay scallops so a serving size was ten.
2. I used disposable aluminum tart pans (pot pie size) for portion control.
3. I used Pinot Grigio wine.
4. Instead of cracker crumbs I used Italian bread crumbs and mixed them with the pecans and butter before topping the scallops.
5. I increased the baking time to 14 minutes but left the temperature at 400.
The verdict was that they were a big winner. They are half the cost of real scallops but we could not tell much difference in taste. I'm looking forward to trying them in a cafeteria setting this Lent at our fish fry.

Just made this recipe, and first of all, I have to say that I made it with haddock.  I also used fresh basil instead of parsley.  It was absolutely wonderful.  I did have to pour off about half the liquid before I baked it because it was swimming in liquid. But it was so easy, so quick, and so delicious.

These tasted pretty good but there was too much wine and it made the topping a little mushy.  Next time I'll use half the amount of wine!  Also, it turned a weird/unattractive grey color after baking...
