This is a five star recipe for ingredients and taste, 4-stars for method. This was my second time to make meringues, having failed my first time. I researched to find that the egg whites should be cold to separate, then allowed to sit a minute. I added 1/8 tsp cream of tartar to the unbeaten eggs. The rest of the method is right on and the cookies came out perfectly. I did reduce the sugar by half for health reasons-and frankly, for us, they didn't need more sugar.  I left them for almost 10 hours (overnight) and they were perfect. Thank you for the recipe.
