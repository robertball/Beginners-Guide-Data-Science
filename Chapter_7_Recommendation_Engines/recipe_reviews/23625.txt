I loved this recipe!! I will add salt next time, maybe a little less garlic, as others have recommended. This is very, very rich though. I can't wait to bring it to the next party as an appetizer! (I will put it in one large sourdough loaf and use bread and crackers to dip)mmmmmmm!

OUTRAGEOUS! I used half the parmigiano (I ran out) and it was fantastic.  Very Rich, better for an appetizer, too much for a main dish. The next day I took the leftover chicken/spinach stuffing, added a cup of heavy cream and served over pasta.  It was fantastic, again.

I really liked this rich recipe.  It was very filling- could only eat one!!  i did think it was way heavy on the garlic.  will try to scale that down next time if i make again.

Another great recipe from Rebecca! Since I was doing this for a group, I hollowed out a loaf of sourdough french bread and stuffed it. Because of the comments about garlic, I used 1T of Mrs. Dash Garlic/Herb Blend and finely chopped broccoli rather than the spinach. One half cup of diced green onion, and it was perfect! Several folks wanted the recipe. Thanks again, Rebecca.

This recipe is really good.  I used colby jack (I hate pepperjack).  Actually, the bread i used was really hard, so wrapping these up in saran wrap and then microwaving it made it really soft and actually more flavorful than after baking.  Highly recommended!

great recipe!  I didn't make them in buns, instead I used 1/2c. asagio, 1/2c. mozzarella and 1c. bleu cheese.  Added hot sauce like others suggested and since I'm a huge garlic fan I kept the amount the same (actually 7 because an extra clove fell off the bulb).  Baked it in a dish and served it with pieces from a bread boule.  Delish!

I just made one to see if I would like it - maybe I did something wrong in the scaling but I found it too heavy on the garlic and the parmesan. The other flavours were lovely, and I do like garlic but I couldn't get the taste out of my mouth all night. I only used 1/2 clove for 1 sandwich.

Very rich, but good.  I did add a little minced onion and some Italian seasoning, and just a pinch of red pepper flake since I used plain Jack cheese.  Will make these again and keep playing with spices.

I'm only giving this 4 stars because hubby didn't comment on it. He ate it but he'll eat anything I put in front of him. I made it almost to a tee. About half the garlic as others said and it was plenty as hubbie isn’t a huge garlic fan anyway. I used soft hoagie rolls and they crisped up nicely in the foil. Even baking them for 30 minutes the cheese mixture was only warm, not hot and gooey like I was expecting. In fact I love all the ingredients in this especially the cheese, cheese and more cheese but it just didn’t have much pizazz. I cooked the cubed chicken unsalted in the microwave. The chicken cheese mixture seems quite dry and a real workout on the wrist to mix but once the cheeses are somwhat melted it is not dry tasting.  I only made 2 buns so I have chicken cheese mixture leftover. I’m going to “kick it up a notch” as they say by salting it and maybe adding a little Frank’s red hot sauce.  In the South here they always add “pepper sauce” to any type of greens. This is the vinegary juice from a jar of hot or mild peppers  (banana peppers for example) depending on your taste. Since the frozen spinach tasted a little too—how can I put this—green and fresh , not completely cooked to a green stringy mush like canned-- I may add a few chopped pepper rings and a little “pepper sauce”.  It might be good to mike this mixture to almost melting before putting it in the buns too. I probably won’t make this again but it was good for a try it once meal.

This recipe was sooo good.  The whole family loved it.  I used portugese hard rolls instead because I couldn't find the sourdough rolls.  It came out great.  I'm definitely going to make this again.  Also I think this would be a great appetizer for a dinner party.

Really good and very filling…. I cut the cream cheese amount in half but added a bit more shredded cheese.  Great way to get spinach into your family dinner…next time I would add mushrooms just because I know the family likes them…. Thanks to Rebecca for a great idea.

This is pretty tasty. I made a bunch of these guys to take with me for lunch. They're super filling! I skipped the frozen spinach because I'm personally not a fan.

This recipe was pretty good.  I used sourdough bowls.  I halved the cream cheese due to others who said it was too rich.  I added more pepper jack than called for.  When sauteeing the chicken, I cooked the garlic as well, since others said it was too garlicky.  This made it less garlicky than putting it in raw.  The bread came out awesome.  I thought the filling was good.  It was rich, but not too rich.  There was still plenty of moisture with only 1/2 the cream cheese.  My husband thought it was still way too rich.  He suggested cutting back on all the cheeses and adding more spinach.  It was a lot of food, and we were both unable to finish our portions.  All in all, I think we'll keep playing around with it to customize it to our likes, but it's a good start.

This came out really great. I was stuck on what to make for dinner, and everyone at the table agreed that this recipe was a keeper!! Wrapping the stuffed buns in foil kept everything nice and moist. I cut back the garlic a little, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly...

This is a good recipe to make with a kid - my little sister had fun mixing everything together and scooping out the buns.  I would suggest decreasing the garlic - we all like it and it was still overpowering.  Also, I used canned, diced chicken to speed things up some and it still tasted good (although I'm sure fresh would be better).

I thought this recipe was just okay. I followed the recipe and used several of the modifications that were mentioned in the other reviews, hoping to have a better outcome. It was very difficult to find the large sourdough rolls. I had to use bread bowls which were too big. I would agree with others that this would make a better appetizer. I don't think I would make it again because it's pretty time consuming considering the results.

I couldn't find 6 buns, so I bought 3 large bread boules (there was only one sour dough boule, and the other two were marble). There are 3 of us, and as this was so filling we made 2 meals out of it. We thought it this was very tasty (including our 13 year old) and a twist on usual dinner entres. Will definately make again.

This was so good! I used kaiser rolls and it worked well. I fried my chicken and only 2 cloves of garlic in some olive oil. Then added the cheeses. I had added 3 slices of pepper jack since I didn't have any shredded. I also added mushrooms and a bit of black pepper and a dash of salt. When I tasted it, I thought it was lacking in flavor so I added a can of chopped jalepino's and that did the trick. Yum!!! I can't figure out why some said it was dry, maybe they didn't hollow out the bread enough because I had so much creamy filling. It was fabulous! I will be making these again!!

There was smething missing in this recipe, I'm just not sure what it was. Mybe it was just a little too cheesy. I also thought it might be ood to make only the cheese & chicken filling and serve it with a plate of dipping crackers or bagel chips. My boyfriend, however, loved the dish just as it was and said "don;t change a thing about it."

Hmm...the filling was good.  The bread turned out quite crispy and the filling was somewhat dry.  I have other ideas for this recipe, but it will definitely not be for the way it was written.

I made these for during a football game.  Everyone enjoyed them and they reheat well in the oven.  I used short sourdough rolls instead of long rolls and low-fat cream cheese.  No one noticed the difference.

I have made these twice now, and we thought they were very tasty.  I did make a few changes (left out the cream cheese, substituted brocolli for the spinach, added a can of cream of mushroom soup and used cheddar cheese instead of pepper jack, stuffed it all into hollowed out sub buns).  They come out of the oven warm and gooey and taste delicious.  Will be a regular recipe for us!

this was a little rich for me, the taste was great, hubby ate them up, but he thought the mixture would make better enchiladas than filling in a sandwhich so next time i'll try that- also it was similiar to the spinach dip recipes on this site, only not a dip but stuffed in a roll- will use the recipes again but i will try to add some sour cream and make enchiladas out of them--

I pre-made the chicken mix before going camping, stuffed it in the buns when we got there, wrapped it and threw it on the grill. It turned out great! Everyone there had to have the recipe. This is a keeper.

What a great easy-to-make dish!  Perfect to bring over for a small potluck or a work lunch, and just heat in the oven with no mess.  I substituted the chopped chicken for spicy chicken sausage bits, browned ahead of time -- a nice Italian flavor.  Fresh basil gives it kick.  For a lower calorie version, use lowfat cream cheese, reduced fat cheese, half the amount of Parmesan, and some seasoned rice and/or softened vegetables.  Tastes just as good!

Love the filling. I had some chicken that needed a job so I diced it, seasoned with s&p and cooked it up in some olive oil. Then I added a large garlic clove - minced and a 10 oz bag of fresh spinach (definitely go with the fresh - it's quick and easy and tastes so much better than that frozen stuff) and cooked until the spinach was wilted. I put that in a bowl with the cheeses and it was yum - kind of tasted like spinach artichoke dip! I could only find the 'soup bowl' sour dough rounds, so I stuffed 2 of those with the filling and then baked. I had to bake at 400 degrees for 40 mins as they were big. My husband and I split one and it filled us both up! It was definitely tasty but a little awkward to eat. Thanks for sharing!

Loved the ingredients, very tasty.  However, mine turned out very dry..would have liked to have it a little creamier.

These were so good. I did cut back on the garlic just a bit, using 4 cloves instead of six. Pulsing everything in the food processor made for a really quick and delicious meal.

I was unsure about all of the cream cheese as I was mixing it in- but I went ahead and put it all in anyway.... 

Way overpowering. Everyone in the family liked it but we all agree to either nix the cream cheese next time (there is enough of the other cheeses to hold it together with plenty of cheesy goodness to go around) or just add about 1/4 of the block.  Overall I think it's a great recipe; we will make it again without cream cheese.

I've made this recipe probably half a dozen times over the last few years and it's great. The only thing I do different is use regular kaiser rolls from the bakery instead of sourdough.
