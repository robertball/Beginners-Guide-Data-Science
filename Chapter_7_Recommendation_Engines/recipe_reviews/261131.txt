Chocolate Gravy is a staple in the South. I introduced it to my grandchildren tonight. They thought it sounded terrible, so I explained that it's kind of like eating warm chocolate pudding. They wanted it over pound cake, but it's traditionally served over biscuits. This recipe is very good!

We had chocolate gravy at my mother-in-law’s house  and at home for all birthdays and holidays!!  One holiday we didn’t have the right ingredients, so we went online and found your recipe.  My kids LOVED and now we use cocoa rather than Nestle’s Quik.  Thanks for bringing true about her gravy into our home.

It was pretty good. I think I just needed a different cocoa powder.
