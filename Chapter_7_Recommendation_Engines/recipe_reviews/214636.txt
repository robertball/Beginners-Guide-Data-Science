Great seasoning, I put it on haddock with fresh lemon juice and grilled it in aluminum foil!!  Wonderful addition to my "homemade seasonings". FYI if you like this one try cajun spice mix listed on this site!! Enjoy

This is very good seasoning. There is too much of something, can't quite figure out which spice it was. But great taste with fish. I pan fried it with Pam and lemon juice. I tried it with grilled chicken too mixed with a little bit of olive oil. It was great.

As written it's definitely 4 stars. To make it 5 stars, I cut the salt and rosemary in half and added 1 teaspoon lemon zest, 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes and 1/4 teaspoon paprika. It gives it a kick and a hints similar to that of Old Bay seasoning. A real keeper!

This was great. I used it with a bit of oil on my salmon. Very easy, flavorful fish. I did use less Rosemary (not a huge fan of it) and sea salt since we have to eat low sodium. I only have celery flakes so I used those. It was great & I'll be using it in lots of recipes. Thanks!

I love this! I was looking for a simple tasty alternative to my husbands (over-used) blackening seasoning. I found this to be delicate and refreshing. I used this on DH catch of the day, Redfish and seatrout

This seasoning is the best.  I've used it on Perch, Cod and Tilapia.  My husband, who is NOT a fish eater, sampled my baked fish (seasoned and then coated in Panko Bread Crumbs) last night and  liked it!!    Highly recommended.

This is also great to bag up and take camping! Use on freshly caught fish & use olive oil or your own Marinade as a mixture, or use as a dry rub. It is wonderful.

Very tasty! It really matters on the meat as well but my dish was yummy. I usually use Mr Binghams seasoning on all my fish dishes and never had a bad dish. I wanted to try something different and it kinda tasted the same as i put mr binghams and olive oil.

These are excellent spices for fish!  Try it once and then you can adjust to your families taste.  
I like to use some of our spices from the garden for a change every once in a while.  :)

Made this as directed and put on Salmon that we BBQ'd. Loved that there is no MSG in this seasoning as many of the fish seasonings contain this bad ingredient. Next time I will add some lime juice/jest and a tiny amount of brown sugar to the mix before adding it to the fish.

Mixed this up tonight to put on some salmon - Oops - did not have the sage or marjoram, so I doubled the rosemary- garlic blend I had and added some dry mustard.  Excellent!!  Smells just like the stuff in bottles that sells for $4-6 each!!  Will use again for sure!!! Thanks!!!

We have been increasing fish in our diet after years of avoiding it.  This is one of the easier ways we have found and great tasting.  We added olive oil and baked st 425 go 20 minutes.....yum.

Was really good and my husband loved it! Even my kids ate it. I didn't have quite all the seasonings (Rosemary, celery salt, or oregano), but went by the recipe on the ones I had and it was perfect. I did use lemon pepper instead of black, and added a tiny bit of crushed red pepper and paprika.  I will definitely use this over and over again.  Thank you!

Note: I dipped the fish in a egg/milk mixture, and than coated in plain breadcrumbs with some of the seasoning mixed into it, then fried it in margarine. DELICIOUS!

I used this spice mix with a little olive oil on whiting fillets. Baked in oven on 350 degree heat. Delicious! Easy and so healthy too. Thanks for a great seasoning recipe.

I am trying to add more fish to my diet and this fish seasoning is very good. Cooked it on mahi mahi in the oven and added a little butter and lemon. It was really good! I will keep this in my pantry to use on more fish dishes.

I love to cook with herbs-so good for you. I made this with just a pinch of rosemary (I find the flavor too strong), half the salt, and a few pinches of dill. THEN, I added the sauce from the "Sauced Fish" recipe on this website (just use less lemon.) Baked till flaky and it was delicious! Had a nice herb flavor with just the right amount of zip from the sauce. Try it!

The best! I made up some of this, stored it in sealed container, sprinkle over fish (usually tilapia), and put it on the George Foreman grill.  The kids love it1. I thought I had lost the recipe (until I found that I had smartly saved it in my recipe box) and the kids were upset.  They said, "Mom, you HAVE to get more of this!"
