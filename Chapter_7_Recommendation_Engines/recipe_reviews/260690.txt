Delicious! My family said it was a little too lemony, but I liked it. I used cooked shrimp and it worked well. Capers gave it great flavor!

I liked it but needed to kick the flavor up a notch. I added some white wine, clam juice , garlic powder , scallops and a lot of garlic. I wanted it to be more like a seafood linguini. I will definitely make this again.  This would be great with clams and mussels too!!

I diced the zucchini and used Gluten Free spaghetti instead and it was excellent!!!
