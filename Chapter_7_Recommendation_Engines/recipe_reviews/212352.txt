Took this to work today for the staff. They RAVED about it - beautiful presentation, great taste! Used whole almonds and fresh basil and parsley from the garden. If using a food processor, no need to chop garlic or sliver almonds in advance. Quick, easy, a definite keeper! Will surely make it again. Great for give away!
