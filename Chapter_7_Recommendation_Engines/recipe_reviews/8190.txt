This cake is absolutely delicious! It smelled so good in the oven that as soon as it came out I had to have a piece. Highly recommended if you have company coming over last minute. No need to frost, it's perfect just the way it is!

This cake is not a cake it is more like corn bread.  Although it is good, it is definitely not a cake in the traditional sense of the word.  If you want something dense with a lot of walnuts that is a little on the dry side, then you've found it right here...sorry.

I'm so glad I finally found this cake recipe -- we used to make it years ago, but it was lost during a move!  It's absolutely wonderful!  Enjoy!

This cake was a favorite of actress Irene Dunne, who was from KY. It is a favorite of my youth. This recipe is nearly identical to my Mother's. It is a superb cake, with a light crumb. The walnuts make it special, esp with a caramel icing. Good Luck!

I didn't have enough walnuts so I substituted chopped macadamia nuts instead.  Wow!

Not a sweet cake, but very nice.  I made it for my husband's birthday.  We liked it, the kids did not.  Definitely a "grown up" cake.

Edible, but not good.  As a cake, it was like calling cornbread cake.  It was not sweet enough.  It would be better called a coffee cake, but then there are better cofee cake recipes out there.

I've never been big on sweets but, I was having company...made this recipe with half butter/half shortening, whipped up some cream cheese frosting (with half amount of sugar) and topped the whole thing with more crushed walnuts.  DELICIOUS!!! I have never had an entire cake disappear after dinner.  And now my family keeps asking when I'm making another?!?!

For walnut lovers. I liked this, because I love walnuts! But I can see why it isn't to everyone's liking. It is dense though not dry; the flavour isn't really complicated...it just tastes like a plain cake with nuts. But if you want a pleasant, somewhat humble cake to dress up with a rich frosting--or as an accompaniment to coffee, like me--go for it. Also, the recipe doesn't call for it but I toasted the nuts first. Yum. I made mine into muffins.

this recipe is exactly the same as my grandmothers,except that the amount of sugar should read one and two thirds sugar. 1 2/3 is our it reads in her original recipe.. it is a great cake with a coconut/nut/ broiled icing
