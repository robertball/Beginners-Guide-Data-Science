This has been one of my family's favorite meals for years.  I make it with a turkey breast, and after it's done I shred all the meat off the bones and place it in a bowl with all of the juice.  We serve it over rice (long grain & wild rice, usually).  The next day I usually skip the rice and heat up a bowl of the juicy turkey meat all by itself.  The flavor is terrific.

Easy, delicious, & relatively healthy.. total winner!  Followed the recipe with no substitutions.  Only change was I had crock pot on high for the 1st hour, then turned to low for the rest of the time.  Very tender with a nice, not overpowering flavor (just right). Served with mashed potatoes & roasted carrots.  Everyone (including 2 teens) was happy. Will make this many more times, thanks for the recipe!

I use a turkey breast with the bone which flavors the gravy beautifully.  Skipped the onion mix (to avoid all the sodium) and seasoned the breast with sea salt, black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, sage and thyme.  Put one chopped onion and one chopped celery stalk around the breast with the cranberry sauce and juice and you're good to go.  We LOVE turkey cooked in the crock pot!

Fantastic recipe!  So easy and so great. Maybe those who don't like it just have different tastes, but there's no problem with the recipe.  Only advice: if you have a large slow cooker, double the sauce, just to make sure the breast is well covered.  But we loved this dish and will keep coming back to it!

I substituted chicken breasts for the turkey since that is what I had on hand. It turned out great...served it with stuffing on the side.

I was hesitant about using the onion soup mix and was right - I thought it overpowered the cranberry and OJ and gave it an odd taste (not to mention the processed, unnatural ingredients in the soup mix).  I tossed the juice and now have to salvage the turkey somehow.  Gave the recipe two stars for the idea of using the slow cooker.

This was terrific - we will certainly do this again, perhaps doing two 3 lb boneless at once.  This would also be terrific with chicken.  Only thing we added was the packet of turkey gravy that came with the boneless turkey and some flour to thicken.  This made the gravy less sweet - which was good.

I used frozen chicken breasts instead of turkey (cooked it about 12 hours on low) and served with mashed potatoes.  It was soooo incredibly good!  Will most definitely be adding this one to the "do again" file!!

I put a split turkey breast in the slow-cooker, added 1 cup of cranberries and 1/4 cup orange juice, then put it on LOW for around 6 hours.  I drained the liquid, mashed the cranberries, added a can of cream of chicken soup and half a can of water to make an amazing gravy.  It ws very tasty and the color was added another dimension.  Couple that with turkey dressing, peas and mashed potatoes, it was an easy mid-week dinner.  The hard work already done by my slow-cooker; the greatest invention since I don't know what.  Lastly, I agree with some of the other folks in terms of the dry onion soup mix.  Not a good addition.

Love this but not so much onion.  I rubbed the jellied cranberry sauce into the turkey breast and sprinkled the onion soup on top - about half the package. I just used water in the bottom of the crock pot -no orange juice. Delicious and easy!  My turkey breast was bigger and not boneless. Cooked an hour on high before switching to low. Next time will try pouring the orange juice over the breast in the pot before rubbing in the cranberry sauce.

Very good, and very moist.  While eating it, I kept hearing "This is something I would like to have again".  It was so easy that I don't mind making it again!

The turkey was moist, but the onion soup, cranberry sauce and OJ combination made for an odd taste.

Just made this tonight for the first time. WOW, it is delicious! Served with mashed potatoes and asparagus. Felt like an "upscale" meal with very little effort. The turkey was sweeter than I expected, for some reason, but balanced with vegetables and potatoes, it all worked together. 

Definitely will make again! Thanks!

Interesting flavor. Wasn't too salty or sweet, just different. It wasn't BAD, but (to be honest) if it wasn't for the mashed potatoes I served it with it probably wouldn't have been that great.

I thought this recipe was wonderful as is, but I may take the advice of one reviewer and double the sauce recipe to get the turkey fully covered while cooking. Either way it was great.

In brief:  Meat good, sauce too sweet.  Recipe not specific enough about ingredients.  More salt needed or more acid needed.  Only average when made as directed.  I found this dish too sweet.  I used the OceanSpray whole berry cranberry sauce, which is jellied.  Maybe that is the wrong one to use, but the recipe isn't specific about that.  Since one cook found the dish too sour, I wonder if a combination of jellied and regular cranberry sauce would work?  I made it on the bone and also did high for one hour, followed by six hours on low.  Meat fell off the bone.  It needed a lot of salt and was just too sweet for us.  I was disappointed, but might try it again with the addition of perhaps fresh lemon juice?  Something needs to cut the sweetness.

I applied this recipe last year to a 20 pound Thanksgiving turkey cooked in a slow roaster, and kids and grown-ups - everybody loved it!  This year I'm planning to use the same recipe.  The sauce made the turkey so moist, flavorful, & sweeter than some, which was complimentary to all the savory Thanksgiving sides.  Cook the turkey breast-side-down so that the juices moisten the breast.  It's so nice to prep this slow-roast this turkey the night before and not have the hurry on Thanksgiving day.

Use anything BUT Ocean Spray brand cranberries!!  That brand is always too sour for my taste.  In Texas, we have a great store brand at HEB; I used some plain jelled and some with berries, and I tossed in a few extra frozen berries I had in the freezer from the previous Thanksgiving.  What a delicious holiday memory.

Excellent using another reviewer's suggestion.  Did not use the onion soup mix, but added salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and poultry seasoning.  Also added a chopped onion and stalk of celery.  Very moist!

This is an excellent idea. However I didn't have the time to do a Turkey Breast. Instead I used boneless skinless chicken and cut it up into bite sized pieces. I forgot to spray the crockpot with Pam so I added a little extra orange juice and a splash of olive oil just in case. I used whole berry cranberry sauce and instead of mashing it I just mixed it up a bit so it wasn't still in the shape of the can. I put it all in the crock pot on high while we went to Church. When we got home 4 hours later it was re ady. I turned it down to low and let it simmer while I made some Jasmine rice. I dished the chicken/cranberry sauce mixture over the rice. Even finicky mother liked it. We are both having it for lunch tomorrow. Will be making again. Thanks so much for posting

This was very good and so easy.  The flavors are not everwhelming at all and the turkey stayed moist by using the slowcooker.

This turkey was so easy to make, I used a boneless breast, and it was delicious! I only gave it 4 stars because it doesn't look all that pretty when it is served but if you brown it on all 4 sides before you cook it, it may look much prettier!  It was so moist and yummy, cranberries and turkey go soo good together I will definetly be making this again and again!

Mine cooked VERY fast which meant it was over done by dinner time. 2 - 3 hrs. is all it needed in my pot, on low. It was pretty good, not great.

Turkey came out so moist & juicy. Flavor was so good. Next time I'd put the cranberries in towars the end or may just add some more since they came out all soggy and not tasting like cranberries anymore. I just wanted that crisp cranberry tartness. Still a good dish though.

Taste wasn't bad, but I missed the crispy skin. I even put it in a 400* oven while I made the sauce. The sauce was way too sweet and I didn't even use the oj and did add the turkey gravy pkt.

The flavors of this recipe caught my eye, so decided to tweak and make it healthier.  I made my own onion spice mix, as the box kinds are just too high in sodium, and there is always that processed taste.  I then made Alton Brown's cranberry/ orange sauce, which I make often and it is absolutely delicious, so as not to have the high fructose syrup in the canned cranberries.  I also used fresh squeezed orange juice.  We used it to make hot turkey sandwiches, and it was very good.

I totally enjoyed this dish and so did my family.  I love using my slow cooker and this recipe is a keeper!  After I removed the turkey from the slow cooker, I strained the cooking juices and served the juice along side the meat.  I also used a bone-in turkey breast because it was on sale.  If using a bone-in, make sure to put the meaty breast side down in the slow cooker so that meat doesn't dry out.

This was very easy and tasty!  I left out the orange juice (personal taste) and used a bone-in turkey breast.  It was done after 4 hours on high.  The leftovers make great sandwiches :)

I don't know what went wrong, I've done hundreds of recipes off this website and this is my very first fail. It was too sour with the cranberry and orange juice. All I can say is I will never EVER do this recipe again!!

I had a 7 lb full Jenny-o  turkey breast with bone in and it was too big for the slo-cooker. I used a long piece of foil, sprayed it with cooking spray, used it loosely around the breast and put the sauce on and around the turkey. Leave a small opening on each end and fold loosely over the top. It baked in the oven in 3.5 hours at 325 degrees. I made the sauce with 2 cans of whole berry cranberry sauce, a 1.4 ounce package of Knorr’s French onion soup mix, 1 cup of orange juice. The sodium was less than using 2 of the 1 ounce packages of soup mix of other brands. It was just right for the larger breast. The taste was phenomenal! It was very moist and the onion didn’t overpower the flavor of the turkey. This is so easy and so good! Everyone loved it at Sunday Dinner!

Loved this and so did the family. I rubbed the outside with lemon pepper olive oil and seasoned the herbs de Provence and lemon pepper seasoning before adding the sauce and it was amazing! Will definitely make again.

This was so easy and so delicious- it was unbelieveable. Apparently other awesome cooks on AllRecipes knew about this awesome combination. It was a revelation to me. My hubby and I almost ate the entire turkey breast it was THAT delicious. We paired it with mashed sweet potatoes. Also, I advise not being in the kitchen while this is cooking-- you won't be able to stand yourself all day long. Thank you! Also tip: I wasn't sure to use cranberry jelly or whole cranberry sauce- I used the jelly but I don't know it matters.

It was ok.  It wasn't as flavorful as i thought.  Tastes much better than it smells!  OMG!  It smelled awful! I used boneless skinless turkey thighs, added dried cranberries as well.  Probably won't make it again.

it was pretty good but I think I let it go too long in the cooker. Got a little overdone on the edges (my fault).

This recipe got high marks from my husband. At first it looked as if it would be stringy but it was nothing like that. There was flavor in every bite and it was moist and tender. I actually used home made cranberry sauce the first time, which I highly recommend.

It was good.  I made it exactly as instructed with one slightly different ingredient - I used a bonelesss wild turkey breast instead of your typical store bought turkey.  It was slightly dry and didn't quite "pull apart."  After 6 hours I broke it apart in hopes it would absorb more juices, and it did.  The sauce is good, but if I were to try this again I might add a cup of water.

This was outstanding. So great in fact, that I will be making this turkey for thanksgiving. I added some dried cranberries as well. Some people say that the taste is odd, but I don't think so. It does have sweet and savory undertones, but my family and I enjoyed it. It even makes a wonderful gravy.

THIS WAS EXCELLANT - THE GRAVY WAS WONDERFUL & I MADE MASHED POTATOES ALONG WITH IT. I ADDED SOME CHOPPED CARROTS ON THE TOP. THE ONLY THING IS I COOKED IT ON HIGH FOR 4 HRS & THEN TURNED TO LOW. COOKED FOR 2 HRS MORE & THE TURKEY FEEL RIGHT OFF THE BONE. I WOULD PROBABLY NOT COOK THAT LONG NEXT TIME SO I COULD SLICE IT BETTER.  PS I LOVE THE NEW FORMAT & THE BOWL W/ SPOON!

Superb; so easy to make and easy to make my own!  I love the leftovers so I use a large breast and double the cranberry/juice- make sure the juice has lots of pulp for body.  I add chunks of onion, celery and I have made it with onion soup mix and with my own seasonings - both are great!

This was a very simple and easy to follow recipe. This was good, very flavorful.  I used half of the soup mix (in the past I’ve used the whole packet and it has been very salty, although not for this recipe). It was very soupy. So when I make this again I will use only ½ cup of juice and ½ the soup mix. But it was still very good.

I prefer this recipe with the garlic and herb dried soup mix, but overall an excellent recipe.

The whole family raved about it even the picky 3 yr old. I think I'll add more cranberry sauce next time.

I have been making this for years and everyone loves it.  I sometimes substitute the OJ for pineapple juice for a slightly different flavor and I use the Knorr onion soup mix because the dried onions are better.  You can't over cook this one because we shred it up!

Followed the recipe but didn't have enough time to make it in the crock pot. I made it in a deep round casserole with a cover, cooked it in the oven on 325 degrees until done. Drained the liquid from the dish and thickened it with a tablespoon of flour. My husband isn't a big fan of turkey but loved it.

I cooked this recipe without changing it and it was super delicious and easy. I served it with mashed potatoes and veggies for dinner and then got to use the left-over turkey for some of the most delicious sandwiches ever. A definite winer.
