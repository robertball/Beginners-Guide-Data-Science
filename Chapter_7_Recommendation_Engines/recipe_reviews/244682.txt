So these are really, really good. Add more peanut butter if that's your thing after tasting the mixture (I did, no problems with that). Really tasty! I used candied cherries from last Christmas for the red & green. Wish I'd gotten a picture, but no time for that before they had to be out the door and on their way to a meeting! Thanks for the recipe. P.S. I used parchment paper (and Pam spray on that too) bc no matter what you do to tinfoil it will sometimes stick. It's not trustworthy with sticky baked goods IMO!

So easy and delicious!!  I left out the coconut because my family doesn't like it.  They were a hit!!  Love that the pan didn't get dirty and the bars didn't stick!

Seen this recipe and looks so yummy and I know my 4 grandson's will love them.  Just one question.  Did you use regular m&ms or the mini ones in the baking Isle.  Can't wait to try these!!

I really liked the coconut in this, but I think it would taste better with real butter. It is very rich, so grab a glass of milk!
