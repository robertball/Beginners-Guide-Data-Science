I am giving this delicious soup 5 stars even though I changed it somewhat.  Used chicken stock instead of beef as I don't use beef.  Did not have enough barley so used half barley and half brown rice, which worked just fine. I used 1 T. of coriander and 1/2 cup of rice wine vinegar, thinking I could add more of each if needed but was so good I stopped at that amount.  Great soup, thanks!

This was delicious, all I changed (only b/c of lack of ingredients) was that I added 3 hot Italian Sausages because I only had 10 oz of Turkey and I added 2 1/4 C + 1/4 white vinegar as I didn't have any Chinese Rice Wine.  My 4 year old thought it was delicious as well!

Yuck. I'm sad that I used so many ingredients. I could only eat a half a bowl. I think it could've been a good soup if the rice wine had been left out.

I followed the recipe except I used Japanese rice wine instead of Chinese.  I'm sure it makes for a different flavor but we did like the soup.  I was worried with all the leek and onion that it would be too strong but surprisingly it wasn't.  My husband said the coriander was strong and I thought the sake was strong.  We might make this one again, it was fun trying something unique.

it wasn't too bad......way too much rice wine vinegar.  I put a fourth of the suggested amount and still tasted way too strong.

For such simple ingredients, this was very flavorful. I omitted the turkey and used veg broth, and I halved the broth, rice wine (I used sake), and coriander. Nice and hearty!

Substituted good sake for the Chinese rice wine, and used 1 c sake and 1/2 c rice wine vinegar, and ground pork instead of ground turkey. OMG it is SO GOOD. Housemate loved it too.

Super easy recipe. I used sausage instead of ground turkey and it came out rich and delicious. I didn't have the rice wine and I don't think the dish missed it. This is just a basic arrangement of classic flavors.
