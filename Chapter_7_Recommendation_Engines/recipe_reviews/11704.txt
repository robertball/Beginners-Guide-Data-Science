This recipe is about right. The only things that should be noted is that, after tomatoes are added, they should cook for more than 10 minutes. You need about 20 minutes of simmering or the sauce won't be cooked. Remember also to add salt and pepper to taste before finishing.

I recently had this dish at a local pasta restraunt and wanted to duplicate it.  Based on my dinner and previous reviews, I made some changes and it turned out great! While sauting the onions and garlic, I added 1/2 chopped green bell pepper and after adding the diced tomatoes, I added apprx 1 tsp dried basil, 1 tsp dried oregano and 1/2 tsp garlic powder.  I also sprinkled dry parsley over all when the meal was served.  In the future, I may try adding some Italian sausage (but to do this, I may have to add an additional can of tomatoes to cover the pasta adequately). The bacon gives this dish a subtle smokey flavor and what's great is that you can adjust the heat by adding more red pepper flakes. Thanks Elizabeth...for great dining at home!

This recipe is really good, a perfect example of something being greater than the sum of its parts. I've since found out it has been around since Roman times, now I know why! I have made this dish dozens of times and have experimented with it a bit, the only change that I felt was an improvement was to double the red pepper flakes. I've also tried adding more bacon and it does not make it better in my opinion. The beauty of this recipe is it's simplicity and the delicate balance of flavors.

Thank you, thank you, thank you! I finally made a good sauce.  As always I tweaked this a little per other reviewers.  I used 7 slices of bacon (my lucky #), used red onion and let it get slightly brown, added 1 tsp. dried oregeno & 1/2 tsp. dried basil when adding garlic (which I doubled) and red pepper flakes.  I used 1 can tomato sauce & I can diced tomatoes w/roasted garlic (Contadina is my fav brand).  I let it cook for 20-30 minutes & stirred in fresh basil. FABULOUS.  My boyfriend even said he liked it better than Francesco Rinaldi (which was our fav).

This is a great pasta sauce!  I sweat the onions and garlic in a little olive oil first, then add smoked bacon.  When the bacon is cooked, I add 1/2 C dry white wine and let it reduce.  Then I add the tomatoes and herbs/spices, and let it simmer to blend all the flavors together.  Yum!

Delicioso! Definitely a five-star meal! I used pancetta (Italian bacon, found in your deli counter) in place of bacon and added hot Italian turkey sausage. I grew up on pasta and red sauce. We had it so much I grew sick of it. I was a little leary of all the tomatoes but I am trying to eat healthier so I gave it a go. My grandfather never made red sauce like this! Very good.

This recipe is excellent.  It is a simple dish, yet wonderfully rich with flavor.  It's not often that I follow a recipe to the letter -- I am always changing a little something here or there.  But I followed this one almost to the T (I did use diced tomatoes instead of the called for) and it was perfect!  I will definitely be making this again and again!

Wow!  This is an awesome recipe.  My husband travels quite a bit and has eaten at a lot of nice restaurants.  He LOVED this.  He told me it was restaurant quality.  It is going under our "favorites" file. I've made it with turkey bacon and wheat pasta and gotten the same great results

Didn't have bacon, used a small amount of smoked hickory salt.  Really enjoyed the kick in this dish.

Excellent dish.  Served this as the "primo or first course" of a traditional Italian dinner with pancetta vs bacon as that's what I had and it needed to be used.  It was simply delicious and our dinner guests loved it.  Followed it with Porchetta (Italian roast) and Asparagus Parmesan also from AR.  Many bottles of a good red wine completed a wonderful meal.  Thank you Christine L for expanding my repertoire.

I froze tomato sauce from my daughters birthday party last month, so I used that as my base. The bacon and pepper flakes gave the sauce a wonderful flavor which I used with my stuffed shells for our dinner tonight. I'll definitely use this delicious and spicey recipe the next time I make mussels along with some good Italian bread to sop up the sauce! Very good Christine!!

This recipe was so much more than I expected!  The flavors really explode in your mouth as-is.  I added a little more bacon, garlic and onions, but that is my habit.  Do not overcook the pasta as it loses its flavor and texture.  Really cheap, too.

I have made this dish twice now, and everyone always loves it........though I have made some additions.  The last time I made this it was fo rmy Mom on Mothers day and added more bacon, more garlic, and after cooking the onions and garlic, but before adding the tomatoes, I add some chopped yellow and orange bell pepper, asparagas and cut heirloom tomatoes.  Saute them for a moment, then add the canned tomatoes.  Then add some oregano, and just before finishing I throw in some shredded chicken.  It never lasts long when it hits the table. Top notch dish!

Delicious & easy.  The bacon adds a nice depth to the flavor.  I also tossed in some shrimp when the sauce was simmering.  Mmmm.

I scaled this recipe down for 2 servings.  Sometimes this causes some difficulty with some dishes.  I am happy to say it wasn't the case this time. This recipe is very straight forward and very tasty.  It will make an interesting possibility for Italian night!  Great side dish.  Thanks Liz L.

Absolutely delicious and easy - my 2 favorite words when trying a new recipe.  Normally the first time I try a new recipe, I always make it as written so that I can rate the recipe on the "actual" recipe (I think that's the way it should be done), then if I think that the recipe could use a little bit of this or a little bit of that to make it better, then I'll make it a 2nd time making changes.  But I've gotta say, this recipe is great as is.  Everybody loved it.  The only thing I'd change would be to add a pinch of Italian Seasoning, a dash of salt & pepper and maybe oregano - but trust me, this recipe is just fine without any changes.

I thought this recipe was fantastic! I used 8 pieces of turkey bacon and two hot sausage links. I also stewed the tomatoes for 20 minutes instead of 10. I have never made anything so easy and so delicious. My husband ended up making it cause I was not feeling good and he did a fantastic job with this recipe, he claims he is an Italian chef now! LOL

Great dish! This traditional Italian dish is usually made with bucatini pasta and panchetta (Italian bacon). Crushed tomatoes is a good alternative to stewed and fresh, grated cheese really brings flavors out. Simmer for an hour or two if possible. :-)

It takes longer than 5 min to cook the bacon. Make sure all the fat is crispy before you add the sauce or the browning seems to disappear and it returns to a white soft mushy fat (I don't like that)

Even after your bacon is crispy it will soften in the tomato suace! Yummy dish

I really enjoyed this meal! It is very simple and easy to make with ingredients I always have on hand. I will admit that I substituted pancetta for bacon, I figured that would be more in the spirit of the meal. The dish had a lot of flavor, much came from the pancetta.

I think the pasta could have used more sauce, and I ended up having to add more.  Nice and tasty though.  Will use again!

This recipe was good but lost the bacon flavor after cooking with the tomatoes. I will try it again by making some adjustments. Thanks for the recipe!

This was very simple...I thought too simple to be that great, but i had all the ingredients and so I tried it...it was SO GOOD!! My husband said he had to stop himself from licking the bowl school the next day :) I did add some salt and pepper and used fresh parsley instead of basil (that's all I had) and it turned out awesome!

Didn't expect It to taste that good! After I fried the bacon I took it out and out it back at the end and simmer for a minute or so so that there is a little crunchy things! I followed the recipe exactly and it is good by itself, but a little more bacon would make it better I guess. The little red pepper is good enough for me.

I make this often.  It is one of my go-to meals.  I usually sub dried basil, because then it is a recipe I can count on having all of the ingredients.  Sometimes I use crushed tomatoes for a thicker sauce.

This is such an easy and delicious recipe to make. Its a very simple recipe, but the flavors go together nicely.  I sauteed about 1/2 cup extra onions than the recipe calls for.  The bacon is awesome in this! Great recipe for a poor college student.

Amazing.  Here are my revisions - I think these revisions made this meal go from good to fantastic.  I used diced pancetta instead of bacon.  I used diced fresh cherry tomatoes instead of the canned tomatoes.  I used two cloves of garlic.  Then, I simply used this mixture to top angel hair noodles.  So good.  I think I'll make this again this week!

I tried this tonight and it was a hit! All I changed was to add more bacon (I love bacon) and the taste was nice and smokey. Very very tasty and the fastest and easiest pasta and sauce I have ever made. Even my husband was surprised how fast I had dinner on the table. 15 mins tops!

I didn't like this sauce at all.  Maybe it was the pancetta, but it felt like it left a strange film in my mouth.  I didn't find the flavor all that great either.  I suggest adding some cream if you try this...I won't make it again however.

Amazing! I used one can stewed tomatoes with basil and oregano, one can diced tomatoes with garlic, one small can regular tomato sauce and one small can tomato sauce with basil, oregano and garlic. I tripled the rest of the recipe, and it was great!

Flavorful and different!  I used one canned stewed tomatoes with celery, green pepper, and onion and one can diced tomatoes with basil, oregano, and garlic.  This let me skip the fresh basil.  I added a little dried parsley.  Also added a little more onion.  A nice change of pace!

It's a flavorful spaghetti sauce, light and tasty.  Although if you want more of a sauce,  you have to work a bit with breaking up the tomatoes.

Next time, I'll use more bacon, and 1 can of tomato sauce, and 1 can of stewed tomatoes for a smoother sauce.

This was yummy. We used it as a side dish. I will make it again. I used a little more bacon than called for and added a teaspoon of parsley and oregano but those were the only changes I made.

So, I saw this and knew I had to make it. Then I realized I didn't have onions...or even dehydrated onions GRRR. Then I had an "aha" moment. I substituted the onion and canned tomatoes with Aylmers Accents diced tomatoes with onion/celery/green peppers. Delicious! Thanks for the inspiration!!

Pretty dang good. Next time I would like to add more bacon and maybe some shrimp. But it was a simple recipe that turned out surprisingly flavorful. We didn't add any salt or pepper either.

Made this on Sat. but halved the amount of pasta , and used one can of stewed tomatoes .  Kept every thing else as written .  The flavor of the bacon and onion disappeared , and we thought it was too sweet ,maybe from the stewed tomatoes .  Will try again , doubling the bacon and onion . Will try with either whole tomatoes or diced instead of the stewed .

I am completely puzzled as to why this recipe is rated so high. The bacon doesn't really go with the tomato sauce. I followed the recipe completely and all I tasted was bacon with a can of tomatoes on some pasta. Nothing spectacular.

I only gave this four stars because it tasted okay but it was not exceptional. It needs more flavor. I added chicken and double the garlic plus some other seasonings I had on hand and it was still kind of bland. Maybe too many noodles and not enough sauce.

This was good, quick, easy, and inexpensive. I added fresh cracked pepper and more garlic. If I make this again I would use quite a bit more basil and maybe a squeeze of lemon or lemon pepper. I served with garlic bread for a nice quick lunch.

My husband and I enjoyed this dish. It's fast and simple with a nice flavor and the red pepper flakes gave it a good kick. As others suggested, I cooked the sauce for a bit longer and it was just right. Next time I will add more bacon and maybe a touch more garlic and basil.

Amatriciana should have an onion to tomato ratio of about 3 to 1; this recipe has too much tomato and not enough onion.  Also, basil isn't normally used but a sprinkle of nutmeg is.  This recipe is fine but is too much like 'regular' tomato sauce to be a true amatriciana.  Also you will get better flavor if you leave all the bacon grease in to cook the onions with (you will need it if you have the proper proportion of onions anyway).  I prefer using fresh to canned tomatoes but that's a personal preference.

I love this recipe!!!  I actually don't like much meat in my meals, but this was the perfect amount.  It added a great flavor to the pasta.  I added just a touch of red wine and let it simmer with the tomatoes for about 15 minutes and it was excellent.  Make sure it is a wine with a flavor that you actually enjoy :)

The simple flavors of this dish really stand out with great ingredients.  I loved it with just a couple tweaks.  I splurged a little on ingredients and used pancetta instead of bacon slices and pecorino romano instead of parmesan.  I also added about 1/2 a cup of grated romano to the sauce and allowed it to melt in right before tossing in the pasta.  Also for the first time, I went to an italian deli to get imported tomatoes.  I never really thought there would be a big difference in flavor, but I was wrong.  If you can get them, I highly recommend it.

This was so easy and very delicious. I only made a half batch and it turned out perfect. I didn't make any substitutions.

The Amatriciana is one of the fastest and easiest recipes that can be done, and one of my favourites, but I must correct: there shouldn't be any garlic, only onion :) I can also be made without tomato and it's called Gricia. I know it's almost impossible to find, but if you can use the pork cheek instead of the bacon (guanciale)

This is a great change from the normal spaghetti sauce.  My family eats it often.  I use two cans of diced tomatoes (always in my pantry) that have been thrown through the food processor.  Just under 1/4 tsp. of pepper flakes is great for my kids.  I always add a bit of salt to taste.

Great dinner.  I made it slightly different by using 1.5 cans of tomato sauce and then 1/2 a can of stewed tomatoes because my family isn't fond of large tomato pieces.  I used a bit more bacon, but the recipe is a major hit.

Fantastic, I crave this dish on a monthly basis.  Very flavorful from the bacon, but not too heavy.  It's fast and easy, and I always seem to have the ingredients in my cupboard so it's a quick and easy go-to dish.

This is a classic italian pasta recipe, one of my favourites. I should tell you that the orginal italian recipe calls for "guanciale" instead of bacon (i found it can translate to "jawls"). I don't use the garlic as I don't like it very much, I use fresh tomatoes in it and later add some tomato sauce to finish. Salt and pepper to taste are missing from this recipe. When the pasta is cooked I always add some butter to it and mix throughly before stirring in the sauce, it gives more flavour and lets the sauce stick more to the pasta.

This was very good. I used diced tomatos, red onion and fresh garlic. I also added red pepper. I didn't have any fresh herbs so I used basil and oregino. I sprinkled pasil on top at the end. I also added a 1/4 a cup of white wine to give it a little more flavor. I had some canned mushrooms leftover from another meal and through those in at the end. Very good.

This was simple and delicious; with ingredients that most have in the pantry. We enjoyed as is, but I think I'll add fresh mushrooms next time when the onions are added. Thanks for sharing!

Very good...quick, and easy.  But not to be used as an entree.  There wasn't much bacon versus tomatoes and linguini. But overall...a good recipe.

Very tasty!  I added more bacon, more garlic and some dried basil.  I served it with garlic bread and Spinach Salad with Pepper Jelly Dressing (from this site).  It fed 6 people with enough leftovers for another meal! Next time I'll use a little more red pepper.

OK, so my husband moaned all throughout dinner exclaiming the deliciousness of this dish. I doubled the crushed red pepper (thanks Conari!) and upped the garlic to 1 TBSP. I'll be honest though, and I'll probably never say this about anything again, but that might have been too much garlic. Perhaps just 2 tsp next time. Still, it had a really rich flavor, and wasn't overpowered by the tomatoes as I feared it would be when I saw two whole cans go into the skillet.

For a twist try Ricotta Salata instead of Parmigiano-Reggiano. It is salty with a noticeable tang that stands up well to the amatriciana. Look for Ricotta Salata at a specialty (Italian) store. Some Whole Food Markets carry it.

This is a good weeknight meal: quick, satisfying and not a lot of fuss. I like using canned tomatoes instead of pasta sauce from a jar; the taste is fresher and there aren't a lot of mystery ingredients.

This one's going into the regular rotation. Everyone was unanimous in a 5-star rating. The only changes I made to this recipe were to add diced tomatoes instead of the stewed tomatoes, and to add half a can of tomato sauce. I served it with garlic bread to sop up the juice. Yum. Thanks Christine.

great recipe. Very tasty, just like eating out!
I didn't include the pepper, and instead used red capsicum and mushrooms... but still tastes great, especially with tortellini.

Really good basis to start an Amatriciana sauce from - needed some creamed tomatoes for a smoother sauce and some nice chilli for a bit of zing, but apart from that was superb

The Amatriciana is pork cheek not bacon sauteed in olive oil. The original recipe doesn't have onion, but it could be used, tomatoes and Roman pecorino not parmigiano and no garlic . Hot chili as much as you can take. For the pasta, it's usually bucatini.

This is husbands favorite dish from childhood. I tweaked it of course. Added more bacon. Sauteed the onions with 1/2 cup white wine until reduced. Added a clove of garlic. Oh and used diced tomatoes since I cannot stand stewed. Make sure you cook the mixture a minimum of 20 minutes (I did more about 30).

I did find this to be lacking in the spices department.  Definitely will  adjust the spices next time.

Very good, nice fresh flavors, simple to make. Paired with a salad and Italian bread and oil. I accidentally bought only one can of crushes tomatoes but I happened to have a can of Italian seasoned tomatoes in the pantry so I mixed them together and it tasted great!

Very easy to make, husband and I loved it but the kids didn't like the red pepper flakes -- thought it was too spicy. I would definitely make it again though.

I would make it again but...no rush.* Update* After a night in the fridge...wow, reheated and it was so flavorful! So, total change of mind on this recipe. I just make a day ahead and let sit overnight for full flavor.

We love this. It is one of those rare meals that everyone in my family actually likes. I do follow the recipe as stated. One piece of advice when using canned sauces is to add a little sugar to remove the bitter/acidic flavor. I also added just a touch of salt. The bacon is the key to making this sauce super yummy. This is definitely going into our rotation.

While this was a good dish, I felt it needed more punch.  Next time, I'll add a lot more bacon or do as another reviewer suggested, use pancetta instead.  I'll also add more basil and more red pepper flakes.  The dish didn't need any salt.  I served the dish with Naan, which went well with it, and breaded chicken strips, which I had prepared ahead of time.  One good thing about this dish is that leftovers reheat really well.

I've handed this recipe off to several people. This is a go to recipe for a larger gathering or when you want something different and want to impress. Simple, easy to make and really wows the crowd as the unexpected. Don't be shy with the bacon or the grease. Ditch the linguini and for thin spaghetti instead. I tried to over kill the bacon and the grease. Couldn't do either. The Basil is a must on this.

This recipe is such a great start to an amazing meal! I of course tailor it to our taste: 
-add kalamata olives and white wine to the onions when they are cooking
-use san marzano crushed tomatoes instead of stewed and cook for 20 mins
-double the bacon  
-add shrimp right at the end! 

It is one of our go-to meals, it seems like a fancy dish when really it's incredibly easy to prepare! Also, we have used lobster in place of the shrimp and was just as good!

I followed the recipe as is, except I didn't exactly measure anything. I may have allegedly put in more garlic and crushed red pepper, but that is only because I didn't use a measuring spoon. I thought the amount of bacon was sufficient to get that awesome flavor in there, so no need to increase the bacon as some other reviews have. All together this recipe will most definitely be repeated in our house.

Loved it! It was easy to make! I used turkey bacon which made the dish healthier. I then added a drop of oil so that the turkey would cook better. I also took the advice to leave the tomatoes cooking longer.

I made it exactly like the recipe, and it seemed very bland. The tomatoes seemed to overpower the other flavors, makeing the dish taste like just pasta and stewed tomatoes. Not a keeper for me!

I added 1 teaspoon of oregano and about a 1/4 teaspoon of salt and this was perfect. It's a great alternative to boring spaghetti.

My daughter picked this recipe out and we all loved it! I added extra garlic, thyme, oregano, basil and bacon.  The bacon went unnoticed, but so DELICIOUS anyway!  I also cooked Italian sausage and continued to cook it in the sauce until I was ready to serve.  An easy recipe to keep on the stove until all the family can gather.  Enjoy!!!

This has been one of my favorite recipes since before I knew what it was.  I'll save the long story for someone who may care but suffice it to say one of my culinary staples.  Like many of the other reviewers, I have taken "poetic licence" with this recipe and recommend to those with a little adventure to add a cup or so of "sea-food medley".  A mix that's now available in your frozen food section of cooked shrimp, squid, cuttlefish, oysters and clams.

This was AWESOME!!!  I made it on Sunday and stuck it in the freezer for DH and family to eat since I had to work late tonight. It seemed to develop more flavor from sitting for a couple of days. Really really simple and has a great taste. I probably added more red pepper flakes but just because we like things a bit spicy. I will totally make this one again since its sooo easy and tasty. Def recommend this one for someone who is looking for something easy or something to throw in the freezer for a later meal like I did. All DH had to do was boil pasta (even he can't mess that up) and reheat some breadsticks.

This was a great and easy recipe.  I am always searching for an easy noodle dish and this passed the test.  I did add a little extra red pepper because my hubby really likes it spicy.  He asked me to make this one again soon.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is my husband's #1 favorite meal.  I use pancetta or prosciutto instead of bacon for a MUCH better flavor.  It definitely needs some salt and pepper, but that's easily done on the table.  I use diced tomatoes instead of stewed tomatoes and I use angel hair pasta instead of linguini.

This was great. I come from and Italian family who is very traditional and they all loved this recipe. I used regular spaghetti and cooked the bacon until it was done (not crispy), but those were the only changes I made. One of my favorites for sure!

My family loved this. So simple, easy will be going into our rotation. Don't worry about over-cooking the bacon. I've found it best when bacon was almost burnt.

Absolutely delicious...only (tiny) change I made was using 6 slices of bacon instead of four.  Fantastic!

I made this last night and it turned out wonderful. I made it for a very good friend of mine, and I knew she didn't really like spicy foods... so I cut back a little on the red pepper flakes. She mentioned how it opened her sinuses, and asked what was in it. She loved it however, and asked me to save any leftovers for later. It's very easy to make, with fresh flavorful ingredients. I used fresh Italian parsley instead of the basil, because that's what I had on hand.

I tried this a couple of times and loved it.  Last night, I had some red wine while cooking.  I added a good splash (about 1/4 to 1/2 cup) of wine to cooked chopped bacon and onion and let simmer for 10 minutes till it reduced then added the tomatoes.  Oh my god, perfection!

This is a wonderful dish.  I added 1 tbsp crushed garlic and oregano.  I also added green and red peppers and 1/2 cup broccoli florets.  I had a mixture of green and white onions.   The recipe is wonderful and adding your  personal favorites depends on taste.  It is a definite five star and will be one of our regular meals.

This was so good!  I did simplfy it a little bit by using a package of real bacon bits instead of frying my own.  I just dumped the package in the skillet with some oil, onion and garlic and let it cook for a minute or two.  I used 2 cans of petite diced tomatoes as neither my hubby or I like big chunks of them.  This is so easy and will definitely be one of my go to dishes when I don't feel like cooking much.

Simple to make. I had most of the ingredience at home. I made it for someone who doesnt really like tomatoes or tomatoe sauce....and they relly liked this dish. I loved it & enjoyed making it. Perfect for a weekday day dinner. I had no need to change any of the indrediance but i did add some turkey sausage to make it a bit more filling. Other than that this is a recepie to keep as a quick go to when your in a hurry or just want to impress someone with a quick yet fancy pasta dish.

Really a nice quick, fresh sauce.  I used thick sliced bacon, chopped small, and liked how it retained it's flavor.  If tomatoes don't cook down in time, use a potato masher to break them up.  Wife and teenagers all voted it a keeper.

My husband and I both loved this pasta dish!  I made a few changes to the recipe: I doubled the bacon, chopped one onion, and I used 2 cans of tomato sauce instead of 2 cans of stewed tomatoes.  I left the sauce simmering longer than stated while I was waiting for the pasta to cook and it blended the flavors well.  I will definitely be making this again and will use whole wheat pasta next time.

I thought this was pretty good.  I followed the recipe, except that I used a whole pound of bacon and I let it simmer for about 25 minutes after adding all the ingredients.  My husband, however, was very disappointed that there was not much bacon flavor.  After smelling the bacon cooking, he was really looking forward to a great dinner, but the bacon flavor just wasn't there.  Next time I will simmer the tomatoes, but I will add the crispy bacon at the last minute.  Overall, it was a welcome change from our normal jar of sauce off the shelf.

I love bacon, love pasta, thought the two together would just be great.  My husband did a pretty good job doing justice to the meal, although my three kids wouldn't touch the sauce, so they just got plain pasta.  I personally am not a huge fan of stewed tomatoes, and since they didn't break down in the sauce for me even a little, if I was to ever make this again I would just use fresh tomoatoes and cut them to size for my own preference.  The bacon in the sauce was a nice touch, but I would have to just change a lot of differnt things to make this again for my family.

I  rated This a 4 for now. I made this the other night. I made some changes, I added alot more bacon. Also added chicken, spinach, mushrooms, kalamata olives, and capers. I also used bowtie pasta and topped with blue cheese. Came out great. It is a good starter recipe just have an imagination and it will come out great. Will make again and try it with other veggies.

This was decent, the red pepper gave it a nice kick. I used a bit more than the recipe called for, but the amount of spice was perfect for me. I used regular spaghetti noodles instead of linguine. Not sure if I'll make this again, but it was a nice change from ordinary pasta. Thanks.

I really liked this! The bacon does add an awesome smoky flavour and the texture is different in a good way. Instead of using whole tomatoes, I used ground tomatoes so it was more of a runny sauce. It's nice how you can control the heat of the dish by adding a desired amount of pepper as well.

This was just OK.  I added more bacon than the recipe called for and then didn't find the flavor of it in the dish.  Just tasted like pasta with a bit spicy tomato sauce.  
On the other hand, my husband loved it!

Really light, but kinda of dry.  Great taste and a good amount of spice!

The flavors in this meal didn't taste like they were supposed to go together.  I probably won't make this again.

I halved the recipe but still used the full amount of bacon. It was too spicy for me, of course, but Husband really enjoyed it. Thanks, Christine!

I made this for the grands & I for lunch today...it didn't take much longer to make this then it would to make PB&J sandwiches for everyone. I cut the recipe in half, used real bacon bits instead of frying bacon so I used EVOO instead of bacon grease to fry my onions. I deglazed the pan after cooking the onions & garlic w/ some pinot grigio & I used diced italian tomatoes instead of whole stewed.  I also added quite a bit more bacon bits & garlic than called for. This isn't the right dish for someone who insists on saucy pasta. It was a bit dry so I took a tip from Giada & added some of my pasta water (just about half a cup). Don't skimp on the basil...it adds a great flavor. I topped it w/ both parmesan & romano...we all really liked it...thanks!

This wasnt bad, I just thought it needed a bit more. It is a good base recipe, I'll just be sure to do a bit of tweaking the next time I make it.

This was yummy! I like to kick it up a bit and added some more red pepper and also added a bit of cream to the tomatoes just to thicken it a bit. A quick yummy pasta dish. Thank you!!!!

This is a great recipe, good for entertaining.  We use 1/2 pound of Italian bacon, "Pancetta", and  cook for three hours to get the full flavor of the pepper flakes.  Pecorino, the hard, salty goat cheese, is our favorite topping to complement the spiciness of the sauce.  If you have the time to go to a "specialty" grocery store, these ingredients add uniqueness.

Great recipe! My son and I were looking through the magazine to pick out something to make for dinner. He decided on this one so we went to the store, got all the ingredients and made the recipe together. It was fun and it turned out great! Super easy for a 7 year old to be able to help and follow along. I served mine over zoodles and my boys are it over linguine.

No changes, made as written. I thought this would taste bacon-y but none of the ingredients stood out and the overall taste was fantastic. 

Not having the pasta in my area, I used bocatini.

Very good! I doubled the bacon and onion and also added salt which I did not think I would need because of the bacon.  After cooking the bacon, I  removed it from the pan and sautéed some sliced mushrooms .

Great recipe. And it's so quick and easy. I followed the recipe except I used diced tomatoes instead of stewed. And dried basil instead of fresh. I also didn't use the entire lb of pasta. Maybe just 3/4 lb. This will be the next thing I bring to the work potluck!!

I’d never had this before, but I’m glad I tried it! Lots of great flavors, and the stewed tomatoes are pretty easy to eat around if you’re like me and don’t like tomatoes.

I think this is a really great recipe on it's own. However, I added some shrimp to it! I washed the shrimp, dried them, tossed them in pepper, garlic powder and a small amount of onion powder and then sauteed them in olive oil, set aside and added at the very end. Absolutely fantastic recipe! I think next time, I will add about 3 more pieces of bacon to counter the spice!

I was originally set to prepare the Olive Garden recipe for Tripolini Amatriciana, and upon seeing this, I decided to do a hybrid approach. 

Basically, I followed this version except I used leaner parts of the bacon, I went for one 14oz can of stewed and one  8oz can of tomato sauce (plus a few fresh tomatoes from the garden, peeled and seeded). 

I used tripolini pasta, and at the end, I reserved 1/2 c of the pasta water, drained the pasta and then returned it to the pot with the reserved water, the sauce mixture, 1/4c of grated Parmesan, 2tbs of grated Romano, and the fresh basil. I also added a little fresh ground pepper to taste. 

I guess I really did change a few things. But it was delicious, and my wife went back for seconds— a rare thing at my table.

This was very tasty, and yet very simple I halved the recipe for the sauce and only cooked 4 oz of  pasta f the two of us and there weren’t much left of it. I think I would have to double the original amounts called for to have enough sauce for 16 oz of pasta. I will make this recipe again.

Before I brown the onions and after I add the bacon.
You can use the fresh tomatoes, it's better than cans of tomatoes.

Excellent!  Easy and pretty quick!  I added an extra slice of bacon for a little more flavor.  Also added just a splash of red wine.  I didn't have stewed tomatoes so I used canned diced, with most of the liquid strained off. Delish!

This was a great recipe. Totally easy and delicious! I put a little spin on it and added fresh parsley in addition to fresh basil and a pinch of sugar. Also, I used three types of onions for a really great flavor- red onion, white, and a little bit of shallot. Me and my fiancée loved it!! Next time, I’m going to try it with a little addition of red wine and maybe use bucatini. Thanks to whoever posted this :)

This was definitely a traditional Italian dish. But it was a little bland for my tastes even after doubling the garlic, the red pepper flakes, and adding ample Parmesan. Next time I'll add even more garlic, make sure I have basil (I was forced to use parsley-but used a LOT!), and probably add a little more bacon. Still, the family ate it happily and we had plenty of leftovers.  It's s good base recipe if you adjust it to your tastes!

The recipe was overall really good, but there was too much pasta, and little sauce. I would recommend cooking half a pound instead of a full box, and mixing in the parmesan with the sauce. If would also recommend more bacon, and more spices.

Very good - fresh ingredients (garlic & basil) are key. I agree with other reviewers - more time to simmer the sauce results in better flavor.

Husband who has a taste for good quality food, (AKA: picky husband), liked it and approved it for the "make again" list.  I'm excited to have the leftovers tomorrow.  Was scared it would turn out like spaghetti, but it didn't and was yummy.

It was OK but needed more spice for our taste.  If I make it again I would double the basil & red pepper flakes & maybe add oregano.

I LOVE pasta, was in the mood for a quick recipe and this one popped up first. This is the second time I made it, this time with whole wheat spaghetti, added more red pepper flakes, fresh garlic and a handful of fresh spinach (which wilted down nicely) right before I served it.  I added the cooked pasta to the sauce and let it rest a while before serving. Is awesome as written and my hubby LOVE it too. Definitely a 5* dish I highly recommend.

Very good. 
Really pops because the bacon counteracts the sweetness of the sauce.  Meanwhile, the fresh basil gives it a memorable zing.

I made this for the first time tonight and since I've never eaten Amatriciana, I didn't know what to expect. This was delicious! Even my 8 year old daughter who dislikes tomatoes and bacon, loved this! Definitely a new favorite! Thanks for a great recipe!

The only thing I did is use the Oscar Mayer fully cooked bacon and while you dont get as much bacon fat you get enough. I also added a bit more red pepper flakes and since I didn't think it would be saucy enough I added a bit of the pasta water , Next time I will surely add the white wine like someone else did. Maybe next time I will use more tomatoes. But we absolutely loved it! Will def make again!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  It required only a few ingredients, making it simple to make and something practical.  The only changes I made was to add more bacon and some salt.   I also cooked the tomato sauce for about 30 minutes, added a little water to prevent it from drying and that worked great for me.  It was delicious and I will definitely make it again.

Ok.
Easy to make but either too little bacon or too much tomato.
Tastes almost like a plain tomato sauce

I will definitely make this again.  Very tasty.
 I didn't have some of the items so I made substitutions such as veggie bacon bits rather than bacon, fresh parsley rather than basil and fresh tomatoes with canned tomato sauce because I didn't have canned stewed tomatoes.  Delicious!  Thank you!

Terrific recipe - easy, flavorful, and easily "adjusted" to fit personal preferences.  For example, we increased bacon to six strips, doubled the red pepper (like it spicy), and - because it's what we had in the pantry - used herb diced tomatoes instead of stewed. As some reviewers suggested, we let it simmer for 20-25 minutes instead of 10.  Crusty bread and a nice salad finished it as a perfect weeknight meal.

Stewed tomatoes too sweet for my taste; so, used diced Italian tomatoes and fried two small Italian peppers (diced) with the onions.  excellent!  Also used thin linguine.

The flavors were pretty boring. I ended up adding more seasoning to make it pop more, but it was okay.

An easy pasta dish that I quickly prepared for my family. It is different than the tomato sauce recipes I usually make.  My husband and I liked the bacon and the simple sauce.

Pretty good. Added a lot more bacon, used stewed diced tomatoes, and a dash of white wine. Simmered for about an hour and a half.

This recipe is to die for.  I had some leftover for lunch today from last night, and it is best fresh.  Still enjoyed it the day after, but still hot out of the skillet is definitely the best way to eat this dish.  The only things I did differently than the recipe is that I cooked the tomatoes for about 35 minutes to cook them down a bit and I did add about double the red pepper flakes.  Printed and keeping this one! 
Actually, this pasta is great cold!!

I made this for the first time last night and made a few modifications.  Instead of stewed tomatoes I used four roma tomatoes.  I cut them up ahead of time and put salt and pepper on them with a little bit of olive oil.  Placed that in the refrigerator to try and draw out some of the juice.  I also used about ten strips of bacon instead of four.  Great base recipe, my family really enjoyed it!

I made this per the recipe and we thought it was very good. Next time I will try some of the suggestions from other reviewers. We went to Rome last year and love making Roman dishes. This will be a staple in my dinner rotation.

Excellent and light pasta dish. No heavy meat sauce on this one. I've also made it using thick sliced peppered bacon and we really loved it. Have to leave the red pepper flakes out or my 93 year old mom won't eat it but my son adds them to his portion. I can eat it either way.

I made the recipe as written except I used less pasta.  This is not a saucy pasta, but it had great flavor.  I really enjoyed this pasta and will make it again.

I was very disappointed in the taste and the reason is there is sugar in the stewed tomatoes I bought (I didn't realize at the time). I don't care for sweet tomato sauces. My 4 year old will eat almost anything - especially if it has noodles or bacon in it- but she said she didn't like it! (Spaghetti is her favorite food too). I'd kind to try another time with diced tomatoes to make it more savory. Maybe this is how it is supposed to taste, but it didn't seem authentic to me! Just be warned if you don't like sweet sauce to check the ingredients on your canned tomatoes!

I used back bacon for calorie savings instead, added mushrooms & chicken for protein. This was delicious! Even my picky teen commented "mom, that was good!" . will be on the books for another round again!!

Amazing. Maybe it's because I have been going without bacon in my sauce my whole life. I also added some spinach when I added my tomatoes. Always good to add greens where you can. Delish!

Love this recipe! Simple and delicious. I sautéed some baby spinach along with the onions to add a little green. Next time I think I will add a bit more bacon or possibly some chicken.

I added red wine, mushrooms, a small can of tomato paste and used 10 slices of bacon. I also simmered it for an hour and this made it much tastier and richer. The original recipe is too bland.

Good recipe! Use bucatini rather than fettuccine if you can get it, and pancetta (or guanciale if you want to get really fancy) instead of bacon. That said, I made it with bacon and the flavor is still great. I also recommend browning the bacon rather than cooking it "until crisp."

Ok, but could have used more "sauce" for this amount of pasta. If I make again, I will increase the red pepper flakes and add another can of tomatoes.

My husband asked me to make more a day later! I added sweet sausage(another review recommended and it was a good idea). I tried this with stewed tomatoes and diced. You really need to go stewed. I also added the 1/4t oregano, 1/4t basil, and 1/4t garlic powdered recommended.(to taste really). This was also more runny then my family likes so I thickened it with cornstarch. This was super simple and very good! If you need something that goes together quick you have to try this.

Very Good, not what I thought it would taste like, it was actually much better.
We did sub Pad Thai noodles for pasta and cut the salt all we could. Dice tomatoes instead of stewed, just like them more.
Great dish, family really liked it.

This was excellent! I was hesitant to put a meatless meal in front of my hubby, but he said it was the best sauce he has ever had! Easy, quick & delicious. I suppose you could add ground beef or sausage to it if you wanted, but it is a winner all by itself!

What a simple, yet wonderful recipe! I added a little extra bacon and didn't have fresh basil (so I used dried, and it was fine). Don't skip the parmesan cheese--it's the best part and ties it all together. Yummy!

Simple. Delicious. I used pancetta and, because I hate buying fresh herbs, only to throw away most of what I bought, dried basil. The recipe made 5 generous servings, with a small side veggie. I served it with a nice glass of Nero D'Avola and was in heaven.

I really enjoy these types of dishes that are simple and delicious, blending basic very tasty ingredients together. I used 6 slices of Costco's Kirkland Bacon (tends to have bigger slices and more smoky flavor), 1 whole small onion (about one cup chopped), 2 garlic cloves, and doubled the red pepper flakes to 1/2 tsp, which added very subtle but pleasant spice. If it wasn't for my 3 1/2 yo daughter's low heat tolerance, I would've gone with 3/4 to 1 tsp. I also used more like 1/4 cup of chopped basil.

I dumped in about a teaspoon of salt before I let the sauce simmer on low for over an hour while I was busy doing other things. A little more evaporated away than desired so right after dumping the linguine into the boiling water, I added a couple glugs of white wine to the sauce to increase the volume.

It was very good and well-received by my wife and daughter. It will definitely become part of the rotation.

Delicious.  Followed the recipe as written (used Italian style stewed tomatoes) and it is perfect!

I made this for my fiance tonight and added extra red pepper flakes, he loved it!  If you don't like it too spicy, just stick to the recipe amount or less, very quick and easy.  i used diced tomatoes instead of stewed because I had some at home.

Oh gosh, I have been making this recipe for years and love it! It is so simple and so delicious. I use angel hair pasta in place of the linguine (just personal preference - I like the lighter texture and taste) and omit the pepper flakes. As for the tomatoes, sometimes I use stewed, sometimes diced and sometimes I will even use fresh tomatoes I cut up myself. Yum!!

This recipe is amazing! The only change I made was to substitute onion powder for fresh onion because my fresh onion makes my finacee sick. The bacon adds a wonderful smokiness.

I want to try this recipe but my husband doesn't like chunks of tomato in his food. Does anyone think if I puree the tomatoes it would change the flavor? I don't think it should.

I don't usually write a review...this recipe is perfect the way it is...(Old old old original recipes call for pancetta...which most groceries carry...it is what I used...but bacon is just as delicious.) What I don't understand is the addition of dried (!!) herbs to this sauce. It is a beautiful smokey fresh tasting tomato sauce that is quick and easy and authentic. It is not supposed to taste like American Prego or Ragu or anything from Olive Garden with dried herbs...MAYBE with the exception of a bit of fresh parsley added towards the end. Try it like it is...if you have ever been to Italy you will recognize this as the real deal.

Used 3 very thick slices of bacon; peppered to taste, (despite what one reviewer advised in adding salt, I felt the bacon provided plenty of that!); since I didn't have any fresh basil or parsley, used dried of both, to taste; added a splash of white wine to the skillet after the onions and garlic had cooked. This was a delicious pasta dish and a great alternative to my usual marinara sauce. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was pretty awesome.  The only change I made was to add some chicken.  I got some extra lean boneless skinless chicken breasts, seasoned them with garlic powder, cubed it, and cooked it in some olive oil.  I added it at the end when I combined the sauce with the pasta.  This recipe was spot on, though.

I didn't change any ingredients for this recipe, only the quantities. I diced a whole pound of bacon and cooked it first. Once done I removed it from the pan and drained on a paper towel. I left whatever drippings were left in the pan and sauteed the onion and garlic in it until the onion was soft and translucent. I then added two 28oz (or whatever the large cans are) of stewed tomatoes. I left the sauce on medium heat and started the water for the pasta at this point. I left the sauce go the total time it took the water to boil and the pasta to cook, approx. 20 minutes. Once pasta was done and drained I added the bacon back to the sauce as well as dried basil and parsley (didn't have fresh). I then used a potato masher to break up the tomato and combine the ingredients. I added the pasta to the sauce and about 1/4 parmesan and let it simmer on low for about 5 minutes. It definitely made plenty of food but heated up great for leftovers.

I made this twice in a row. It was very delicious. Added double the bacon, and triple the red pepper flakes as well as some Italian spices (Rosemary, Oregano, etc.) to give it a bit more kick.

I've never had this before, but it sounded interesting and my DH likes just about anything with bacon. I resisted added a bunch more veggies and opted to just serve them on the side. I was glad I did. The flavors worked so well together. I did add 1/4 jar of roasted red peppers simply because I needed to use them up and I had thrown out all but 1 teaspoon of the bacon before reading that I should use the grease to sautee the onions. I cooked the bacon in the microwave and then diced the slices, added it to a skillet and continued from there. Thanks for the great recipe. Definitely a keeper.

New favorite pasta! Used a whole onion and five pieces of thick Costco applewood smoked bacon. That added a nice sweetness. So good, cheap and easy!

My husband and I recently went to Carrabba's for dinner one night and we both had a dish with pasta amatriciana in it. My husband really liked it, so he asked me to make it one night for dinner. I found this recipe and decided to try it. I didn't have stewed tomatoes, so I used diced tomatoes and replaced the bacon with bacon bits since I didn't have any bacon and simmered it for a while since I had to wait for my husband to get home from work. I tasted the sauce before tossing it with the pasta and tasted the "kick" from the crushed red pepper, but when the sauce was added, I no longer tasted that kick. I felt the pasta just sucked up the sauce, so I'm thinking of cutting down the amount of pasta to 12 ounces next time to see if that helps. I noticed the picture shown in the recipe has the sauce on top of the pasta, but it's suppose to be mixed in with it. That's one thing my husband liked about the dish at Carrabba's. Since my husband gave this a two thumbs up, I will be making this again, just reducing the amount of pasta or possibly using a thinner pasta.

I am a self-professed hater of bacon, but my husband loves it, so I had some leftover bacon in the fridge and needed something to do with it. I'm so glad I found this recipe! Even though I don't normally like bacon, this recipe is amazing! Like most of the other reviewers, I hardly changed anything. Since my bacon was a day old, I ended up cooking the onion/garlic in olive oil and then crumbling the bacon into the pan after the onion/garlic was cooked. I also used Italian seasoned stewed tomatoes and 1 tsp. dried parsley in place of the fresh basil. The only thing I would suggest is adding salt to the sauce before adding the noodles. It makes a huge difference in this recipe. And make sure you serve it with plenty of parmesan on top! The bacon adds a wonderful smoky flavor to the sauce, and I am totally adding this to my recipe collection.

Followed recipe and method exactly but cut the tomatoes in half to make it for 3 servings instead of 6.
Next time- would add more bacon and more red pepper flakes. Tasty!

Tasty, but the recipe produced way too much pasta for the sauce. It was also pretty spicy.

What I did differently than the recipe: used an entire pack of bacon, left out the red pepper flakes, and added a red pepper.  This is a family favorite.

This is one of my favorite weeknight recipes. Quick, easy and good! I sometimes add broiled shrimp (brushed with olive oil and sprinkled with Italian seasoning) or grilled chicken to the mix.

A perfect classic Italian dish.  I did end up using a red onion, because it is what I had on hand.  I would highly recommend this delicious pasta dish. Pair it with a nice crusty bread and you have a fast and easy anytime meal.

Nothing special, IMHO. I worked from home today, but didn't feel like going to the grocery store 5 minutes down the road to get the few items I needed to make chimichangas because of the terrible weather (it's snowing like CRAZY here in Chicago!!!). I had all the ingredients on hand to make Amatriciana (and was able to clean my pantry to boot!), so I decided to give this a try. My only change (based on what I had on hand) was to sub diced tomatoes for stewed. I must say, this is the simplest, easiest recipe - ever (and very economical too!). Served with crusty French bread (to sop up the sauce) and homemade wine coolers (EJRIPPY), this was certainly authentic, just not to my liking. I think I will stick with Cajun Pasta Fresca (Nicole) when I am craving a fresh tomato sauce. Thanks anyways. :-)

Absolutely delicious! I used diced tomatoes with italian seasoning instead of stewed tomatoes though - so no breaking up was necessary and had extra flavor.

This was a nice change up to regular spaghetti and marinara. It was a little bland so next I might try using fresh basil instead of dried and definately needs more bacon, but otherwise if was very easy to make and everyone enjoyed it.

I have never liked spaghetti or really any pasta, but I love this dish!  I use whole-wheat pasta.  I love the smoky flavor from the bacon with the spicy red peppers - so good I could eat it every week!

This came out pretty good. I used 6 slices of bacon, a large can of diced tomatoes, a small can of tomato sauce,  dried basil and just a dash of the pepper. I'll make it again with the same adjustments.

This recipe is FANTASTIC. I made this for my family and there weren't any leftovers at the end of the meal. It's flavorful, but the bacon-y goodness doesn't really shine through. Next time, I might try adding more bacon. A really great and easy meal; not to mention cheap.

Very good! Everyone I have made this for loved it, and the best thing is that it is so simple to make.  I did simmer the sauce for a little longer to help it condense a little more, other than that it was good!  I also used whole wheat pasta to make it a little healthier.I will definitely be making this on a regular basis!

I try a lot of new recipes and this is one of the best!  I recommend 8 slices of bacon, instead of 2 cans of stewed tomatoes use 1 can of diced and 1 can of tomato sauce and also use double the amount of red pepper flakes.  AWESOME!

My wife wanted this for dinner and came back with diced instead of crushed tomatoes, but in the end, it doesn't matter.  This was easy to do, tremendously tasty, and very cook-friendly.  I like the proportions.  To the person that suggested more bacon: if you want bacon, just eat bacon.  Don't overpower the tomatoes!

I had such high hopes for this recipe. The kids are on a pasta kick right now. The sauce turned out too much bite and after trying to correct the "way in left field taste" I tossed it down the sink and opened a jar of sauce.

This recipe was very good, and a very nice change from the usual pasta.  I made it exactly as the recipe called for and it turned out perfectly.  It definitely has a more subtle flavor, so some people may want to spice it up however they see fit.  Next time, I may try adding some sun-dried tomatoes.

My wife and I both enjoyed this very much. I followed the recipe but did omit the bacon. I had expected to lose some of the flavor but was surprised to find it very good. I will be making this again. With a light salad and Italian bread this made a hearty meal that's sure to please.

Very good and easy to make (my husband actually put together dinner!) Definitely is an official favorite and will be used in the future. :)

This was wonderful.  I did use one can crushed tomatoes and one can stewed since my husband doesnt like chunky sauce to much.  I also used way more bacon.  4 slices just didnt seem like enough.  I will be making this again many more times.  Super easy and Super YUMMY!

very good flavor. Don't chop the bacon into too small of pieces or they get lost in the sauce!

This was absolutely fab! I cut the portions down to "three servings" and I was in love with it. At first I was iffy because of how watery it looked. One thing that I did change is instead of frying bacon and using bacon grease, I simply browned some real bacon bits, and used 2 tbs of olive oil as a substitution. And instead of the recommended parmesan cheese I used close to half a cup. It made the sauce more solid and gave it a wonderful taste.  Over all.. great and easy!!!

This recipe is just plain delicious.  The flavors are really simple, but amazing.  I did add a little extra bacon to please my meat eating husband.  I don't think it made a flavor difference.  The recipe was really easy to follow and would probably be a great recipe to impress dinner guests.

I added a little extra bacon and did a second vegetarian version using fake bacon (Morningstar Farms), Since the vegetarian version did not accumulate the bacon drippings, I added olive oil to make up for it.  They both turned out great!  Careful though if you plan to add extra red pepper flakes...ours tended to be a little too hot, probably would've been better to stick to recipe recommendations on this part, you can always add more later.

This was a tasty recipe, but in my opinion it was a lot of work for something that doesn't taste a whole lot different from canned sauce. Next time I may add more bacon and spices so its a bit different. Still good though.

I thought this was wonderful! I halved it as I was only cooking for 2 tonight and used canned diced tomatoes as I didn't have stewed tomatoes in my pantry. Will be making it again soon I'm sure and will try it with stewed tomatoes this time!

Delicious! I added a little bit of cooked chicken breast, and simmered the sauce for 15-20 minutes. Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written. I thought it had a really nice and interesting combination of flavors.

This was a huge hit with my hard to please husband and five year old son. The bacon flavor permeated everything deliciously. I probably took five years off my heart, but I cooked the bacon in some olive oil and then did not drain it at all. I think that helped with intensifying the bacon flavor.

I love this recipe, so simple and easy.  Definitely cook the tomatoes more to break them up, and then simmer longer.  The sauce is thin, so to thicken it up I let it simmer for awhile.  Love it!

I didn't have stewed tomatoes, so i made them from scratch, just boiled the tomatoes enough to peel the skins, then let them boil until they were soft, added sugar and salt to the water.  those tomatoes really MADE that dish!!!!  Definitely gonna do this again!

Very good, I gave it 3 stars because this recipe would be very bland if made as is, though. I just made a few changes.  I added twice as much bacon as the recipe called for, added 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp basil and 1 tsp oregono and I used tomato puree instead of stewed tomatoes (I hate chunky tomato sauce).

I made this dish for my fiance last night, added parmesan and a few basil leaves for garnish and he said he thought it was better than a lot of pastas he ate in restaurants.

This was delicious, the basil was perfect and just enough chilli to give it a kick but not to burn forever.

I will definately make this again.

I have made this twice and it is awesome!  It worked better for me with linguine than with bow tie pasta.  When doubling the bacon, I used 4 slices of regular bacon and 4 slices of pepper bacon to add a little more kick.  Definately a keeper!

This is an all-around great recipe---it's quick & easy, it's healthy & it's versatile.  I followed other reviewers suggestions and added extra bacon, garlic & red pepper flakes.  It was a little too spicy.  Next time I will use the amount of red pepper called for.  I also used diced tomatoes.  I will use this recipe alot---thanks.

I liked this recipe.  I made a few changes.  I used angel hair because that is what we had.  I also marinated 2 chicken breasts and then sliced it thinly.  I cooked the bacon and added onions and chicken until chicken was browned and then followed the recipe the rest of the way until the basil.  I could not get fresh basil, so I bought the Basil that is in the produce section that is pureed.  I added about 2 tsp. of that at the end and it all turned out good.

This is great!  Did follow some of the other reviewers' suggestions: simmered the sauce for closer to 20 minutes, and added sliced fresh mushrooms and spinach, but only because I felt guilty about the bacon... :) We served it over frozen cheese tortellini, because it cooks up really fast, but we'll try it over linguine sometime soon.  Thanks Christine!!

Super easy and delicious!  I used 8 strips of bacon and only a pinch of red pepper.  A new family favorite!

Really easy and delicious. I boosted the bacon, garlic and basil measures a bit and served tossed with Bucatini

This was an excellent dish! My family really enjoyed it. The only change I made was to use more bacon. I even called a friend and told her to stop by on the way home and taste it because it was so good! She went home with the recipe and a sample for her husband, and she made it! Thanks for sharing!

Very tasty and easy. I am on a constant quest for carb loading recipes for my 2 hockey playing sons, so new twists on pasta sauces help a lot.  I took the advice of another reviewer and increased bacon. I went with 1 can each crushed/diced tomatoes. Next time I will do both crushed and serve fresh chopped tomatoes on the side. I also sauteed garlic and fresh mushrooms in EVOO and served on the side.  I'll make this again - oh yeah, whole wheat pasta ALWAYS!

This recipe was very tasty. I love how the bacon gave it a special smokey taste. The only thing i did differently was not use the red flakes b/c i don't like things too spicey but the rest was great!

This was a great recipe and very flavorful. The only thing I did different was replace the pasta with whole wheat pasta.  The whole wheat pasta seemed to absorb the flavor, too.  Who knew?

Excellent recipe! My husband and even my two year old loved it!! I did add some shrimp to it, but it would have been just as good without.

Easy. Tasty. A nice sweet sauce. I don't know if it's the best thing I've ever eaten but I do know that I will make it again. A nice change from regular pasta.
