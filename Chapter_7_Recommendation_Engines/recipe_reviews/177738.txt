I almost didn't try this recipe because of the 3 Star rating, but so-o-o-o glad I talked myself into it anyway.  I didn't have the fresh thyme or tomato paste on hand so I substituted with dried thyme and a small can of tomato sauce.  I added a little red wine (just for good measure!)and some parsnips I wanted to use up.  All I can say is....."YUM"!!!
