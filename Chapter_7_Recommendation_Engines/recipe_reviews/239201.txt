I make this every other week - love it.  I add Italian sausage (hot or sweet) to make it a heartier meal.  I also cook the asparagus in 1/2 olive oil and 1/2 chili sesame oil - I like it a little more spicy.

The only change that I made  was I added sliced Kielbasa. Chicken would've also worked out well. A definite keeper.

It was quick and easy using what I had on hand. I switch the multi-colored cherry tomatoes for can stewed tomatoes and fresh asparagus for canned. I also dint have pine nuts. I reserve the 5 stars for the recipe with out thee substitutes. But, this was delicious

Awesome recipe! I used garlic olive oil, no coconut oil. I used red bell pepper instead of tomato. I added sliced kalmata olives and zucchini. The pine nuts and fresh basil are the most important ingredients! This is one of the few satisfying vegan meals out there.

My teen daughters enjoyed this low carb alternative to pasta.  I added mushrooms with the asparagus.  Also put some additional seasoning on the veggies before adding the squash which I would tweak next time.  I think the canned tomatoes could be a good addition.  I used PAM olive oil spray on the spaghetti squash before baking faced down and it came out just perfectly.

This was delicious!  We had it as a side dish, and the squash was really big, so I only used about 2/3 of it.  I used garlic salt and pepper when I cooked the asparagus.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Turned out well. I subbed roasted red peppers for the tomatoes and added roasted turkey for protein. Turned out tasty; I’ll definitely make this again.

Good stuff first. This recipe got my wife to like spaghetti squash. I'd never had it before and liked it right away. We were both surprised that the basil was the only flavor modifier called for; not even salt and pepper.

Sure enough, while we liked the additional tastes of grape tomatoes and asparagus, we wanted more zip, so we added the fairly peppery sauce I'd made for some slow cooked pork chops the night before.

I asked my wife how she'd modify it if she were making it in future. She suggested (1) a light cheese sauce; or (2), some sautéed onions and garlic.

Since I envision making it again, I'll probably take suggestion (2).

Great start, but I added broccoli, green and red peppers, Spanish onions, and marinated grilled chicken and it was absolutely delicious!  Felt like a hearty, but healthy meal.

Very quick and easy to make.  It's a light meal but fills you up.  I'm just happy the kids like it.  We have made this recipe several times and enjoy it each time.

Nice non-spicy, almost sweet side dish!!  I usually add a lot of spices to veggies but opted to follow this one to the tee and it paid off. You could easily add a little salt if you wish without spoiling its delicate taste. The only substitution I made was to use coconut oil to cook my spaghetti squash. It tastes better for a dish like this. I would use olive oil if I was making it spicy or Italian.  I may use half a squash next time because it made a LOT!  Sure hoping it stays well in the fridge tonight :).

I made this exactly as the recipe says... I felt it had no flavor, other than the oils you use during cooking.  After reading the other reviews, I think I will add some chicken and more seasonings or sauce to all that is left over and see if it isn't more enjoyable.

It turned out bad for me. I had to use a lot of salt. I think cooking the veggies in the coconut oil was what I liked least. It may be good for a different style of cuisine but not Italian flavored. Just my opinion.

Definitely a hit!  All I did differently was use 2 squashes instead of one and added some lemon juice, but other than that followed to the tee and we enjoyed every bite.  plenty of left over using 2 squashes so I recommend that if you aren't doing it already!

We enjoyed it but I added my homemade sauce to it. It was plain without it and I love sauce.

I did not change anything but I served it with gluten free Italian style chicken sausage. My family loved it.
