Wow! I was surprised at how good these are! Some tips: I used an 11x17" jelly pan. Line the bottom & sides with foil & lightly spray the foil with non-stick spray. Generally, sticking is not a problem but I did have a problem with the foil stuck in the toffee where I had a seam in the foil. (I probably should have folded the two pieces of foil together instead of just overlapping them.) DO NOT use a pan with no sides. You don't want this stuff boiling all over in your oven. Feel free to cover the entire bottom with saltines. (If you use only the 4oz package, they will spread throughout the whole pan anyway as they boil in the oven.) Also, before you start timing the 3 minute boil, make sure it's truly boiling. Start timing once you see bubbling foam all around the edges. When you pour the boiled sugar mixture, don't worry about getting every section of the salines covered. Once you put it in the oven, it boils like crazy so the entire cracker gets covered. Finally, I think the milk chocolate chips would have been better than semi-sweet. (I love Swiss Colony toffee!) This is almost as good except I get to take credit for it!

Pretty good!! Here's my suggestions:  Bring to a boil on medium high and then allow to boil for the full 3 minutes without stirring.  Space the crackers so they have some gaps between them.  When the chocolate is put on, spread it with a spatula as if you were frosting each, then place in the oven for another minute to melt more, then add nuts.  Let the cookies sit for about 20 minutes at room temperature and then break apart (they will not be set up all the way) into the individual crackers.  Trim the edges with a knife and save the crumbs for ice cream or next time.  Finally, let them chill for awhile in the freezer before storing.  This way they come out looking nice enough to present--but they taste great no matter how you do it.

Very good! I used the saltines with the unsalted tops (not unsalted saltines, just no salt on the tops). You probably need a little salt to give the flavor contrast. Crisp, buttery, toffee-y (not a word) flavor. The chocolate and pecans put it over the top. To the cooks that had gooey results, you may not have boiled the mixture long enough, or, baked it long enough for that matter. Also, DO NOT STIR when it's boiling. I really think you do need to use DARK brown sugar for that true toffee taste. Piece-o-cake recipe, makes a lot for a little $$$, and people will be surprised when you tell them (if you do ;-) that you made it with saltines. Be sure to line a cookie pan with sides (jelly roll pan) with foil, and spray with a non-stick (I used butter flavor) spray prior to laying the saltines down. Easy clean up, and great for gift giving. You could also use almonds for that true toffee experience. I toated the pecans lightly beforehand. A treat to satisfy that simultaneous cookie/candy craving (read: Twix bar). Thanks, Tracy!

I needed to take cookies to a COOKIE EXCHANGE that we were having with our office staff today.  I saw these cookies, the reviews were great and they seemed novel and very fun to try.  Well, to make a long story short, I made them WITHOUT the saltines.  FIRST, I mixed 5 cups of miscellaneous ingredients -- Cherrios, Rice Chex, Pretzels, Raisins, Mixed Nuts, and Coconut spread out in a shallow layer on my cookie sheet.  Then I proceeded exactly the way the rest of the recipe said.  They were absolutely fantastic and everyone gobbled them down.  A little salty and a little sweet.  This would be a perfect basic recipe to use up all the bits and pieces of ingredients that you have in the cupboard.  Tastes different each time!  So all in all this recipe is a keeper.  It is yummy and versatile at the same time.

This has just been the hugest hit in our family.  My daughter stole it from me, and now her husbands family is crazy over it.  We played around a bit too.. we did two batches of the carmel sauce - made a layer of saltines, poured it over, sprinkled toffee chips, layered another saltine, poured the rest of the carmel, baked it 5 minutes, then sprinkled ghhiradelli's semi-sweets and cashews.  When the chocolate was warmed, started in one corner and swiped back and forth in zigzags.  It made the most beautiful presentation.  At our get-together with friends, my two batches were the only empty dish at the buffet. ;)  *Just wanted to add that we used Reynolds Release foil, worked a charm.  Awesome Tracy, thank you so much for this recipe!

DO NOT STIR THE BUTTER AND BROWN SUGAR WHILE IT BOILS!!!!!!  I have never made toffee before and I didn't know this.  It really should say this in the recipe because they don't turn out like toffee skor bars...more like carmel.  They are chewy.  I was so disappointed that after I read reviews and realized not to stir the butter and brown sugar (I stirred it a lot, afraid it would burn) I decided to make another half batch just to make sure that was the problem.  I also baked them for 7-8 minutes compared with my 4-5 on the first batch.  THEY ARE INCREDIBLE, AS LONG AS YOU DON'T STIR!!!!  I wish I had known.  These taste like Skor candy bars.  I sprinkled just a tiny bit of finely crushed pecans on top and they are delish!

These were excellent!!  No joke.  My son and his friend thought they were from See's.  I used light brown sugar and no nuts.  I used an entire sleeve of saltine crackers; I lined the baking pan with half the crackers and crushed the remainder in my hands and sprinkled them over the whole crackers.  I did this because of some of the reviews I had read about these being a little greasy.  The additional thickness of the crackers soaked up the butter perfectly.  Next time I will probably crush all the crackers, so they are easier to cut into a variety of shapes.  I will absolutely make these again and again.  They were AWESOME!!

So easy and addictive!  I used a 9x13" non-stick pan and used only 3/4 cup light brown sugar and 3/4 cup butter.  I tried 1/2 cup each, but it didn't create enough of the toffee layer.  After spreading the chocolate chips I let it harden at room temperature.  It takes about 2 hours and then I use a metal spatula to cut the bars.  I tried putting them in the fridge the first time I made them, but when I started cutting them, the chocolate layer separated from the toffee layer.   Then when I'm done cutting them, then I put them in the fridge.  Thanks for the recipe!

These are awesome!  I originally got the recipe from a friend who called it "Cracker Candy."  Definitely line the pan with aluminum foil first - it makes it SO much easier to get out!  I'm not a big fan of nuts, so I put multicolored sprinkles on the melted chocolate instead.  It makes a very pretty presentation!  One thing I've learned it to make sure not to use too many crackers or the toffee won't be thick enough and won't soak through - one sleeve of crackers is perfect.  When done right, it's extremely hard to tell that the base is Saltines.  I think I have to make these again soon.  Yummy!

I am begged to make these every year! Kids, neighbors, coworkers etc. I have read the reviews and have picked up some helpful tips. Here are my 2 cents.I use Heath Bar chips (instead of pecans) on mine and it takes it to another level. I make about 10 pans of this every Holiday.

!. Must have non stick foil wrap. YES NON STICK KIND.

2. Use your timers!

3. Don't touch the butter and brown sugar mixture once it starts boiling. Boil for three minutes.

4. I use heath bar chips (located in baking aisle)Once the mixture comes out of the oven I sprinkle them over the bubbling mixture and then put back into the oven for 2 mins. 

5. Then I take it out and sprinkle the semi sweet chocolate chips on it aprox. 1 cup. Let it sit on there for two minutes or so and when soft I spread it around. I used to put the chocolate chips on then put back into the oven and for some reason it makes them hard to spread. Just let the heat of mixture soften them.

6. Buy a silicone spatula. It does make a difference

7. Let it sit out for at least 30 mins before putting in fridge. This lets it absorb into the cracker.

I've made these 3 times. Twice during Christmas and once again yesterday. My 1st 2 attempts were absolutely delicious. My 3rd, not so much! So after comparing what I did differently between attempts,I have this to share:
1) You MUST use real butter. Do not try to sub margarine. It won't work! Use the full 2 sticks.
2) Use a CHEAP store brand saltine cracker. The more expensive Keebler & Nabisco brands end up looking & tasting like a cracker smeared with toffee & chocolate. The cheaper ones absorb the toffee & result in a light & crispy product.
3) The pecans are a must!
4) Make sure you boil the mixture for the required 3 minutes. Otherwise the toffee won't harden properly. If you do it correctly, the finished candy will pull easily away from the foil all in one hard piece. It looks like a giant candy bar.

Delicious!  IF you follow these rules:
1. Line cookie sheet (with sides!) with foil and spray with Pam
2. DO NOT stir the butter and brown sugar!  Every fibre of my being wanted to stir, especially at the beginning, but don't do it.  It takes care of itself.  Just put it on med-high, wait until the sides start to boil, then start your 3 min timer.
3. Watch the cracker/toffee mixture in the oven very carefully!  My first batch only went 5 1/2 mins but it was enough to burn it beyond repair.  Toffee is very touchy and all ovens differ so don't put the timer on for 6 mins and walk away...I learned the hard way!
Other than that, it is an amazing recipe that people really go crazy for.  I live in the Yukon so I just put it outside for an hour and it was ready to crack into bark-like pieces.  Yum..thank you for the recipe! :)

DELICIOUS!!  This was the first to go on my Christmas cookie trays.  Easy to make.  A must to line pan with foil and I put my in the fridge for about 2-3 hours.  Breaks apart easier.  THE BEST!

I gave these 5 stars because they are so quick and simple to make, inexpensive, and everyone loves them!  I whip out several batches of these for co-workers, teachers, bus driver, etc.  Some tips: always line your jelly roll pan with foil AND spray with non-stick spray. You can use graham crackers or saltines; my family prefers graham crackers.  Be sure to watch your time closely so they don't burn.  After you put on the chocolate chips, return the pan to the oven for about one minute then it's easy to spread the melted chips with a spatula.  I don't usually add the nuts as they are pretty expensive and I am always making multiple batches.  I usually just sprinkle them with red and green sugar if I have it. I always let these cool in the garage-- freezer or fridge is not necessary unless you're in a hurry.  Then before they are completely cool, use your pizza cutter to cut them. These makes a for a nice presentation (as they are in squares) and easy removal from the tray.

Wow, this was absolutely wonderful!!  I used my silpat liner and had no problems getting the toffee to release.  I also used walnuts rather than pecans because thats what I had on hand.  I cooled them in the fridge and after breaking apart, stored them tightly covered there as well.  I couldn't stop eating them!!  My kids were disappointed when we were out...good thing that they are so easy to make!

I must have done something very wrong.  I was so disappointed with the way these turned out after reading all the five star reviews.  It tasted and looked just like a saltine cracker with chocolate and nuts on top.  If they are done right, are you supposed to recognize the cracker on the bottom?  Mine looked like a saltine cracker with all its little holes and ridgey edges.  What did I do wrong?  I don't think I'll waste the butter, chocolate and especially the nuts on these again.

Hold on to your pantyhose ... this recipe is about to get kicked up a notch!!!!

It's already fantastic, BUT ... instead of nuts, sprinkle on some really crispy, chopped bacon.  NOT bacon bits.  I used low sodium Oscar Mayer bacon that I microwaved until it was really crispy.

I'm not kidding.  This stuff is great just like the recipe tells you to make it.  But skip the nuts and use milk chocolate chips and add bacon.

You won't be sorry!

This so good but it can be tricky to make. I think the most important thing is to let the butter and sugar boil for a full 3 minutes and DON'T stir it. I made the mistake of stirring the mixture and it ended up extremely sticky and gooey- it could of pulled a tooth out!

Taste great!  We were all surprised!  I followed the other reviewers tips: Line pan with foil (no spray and it still worked great), cool completely (I didn't use the fridge/freezer, it just sat on my counter for about 5 hours since i had some zoolights to see), cut with a pizza cutter (this worked great and made nice size pieces), and finally my favorite, use the leftover crumbs for ice cream topping...yummy!

I did not care for this recipe.  Picked out this recipe last night because I had lost my original and didn't think there would be any difference.  Idk if it was the boiling for 3 min or the oven at 400 but it was wayyy too dark and burnt tasting.  The proper recipe is bring to a boil and then into the oven at 350 degrees.

Would of been wonderful if I was able to eat it. As suggested by a previous reviewer, I used parchment paper on a baking sheet rather than foil. An absolute mistake. Was unable to salvage any of it, as the paper stuck to everything. Very disappointed. Will try this again, but with foil.

Super easy and yummy - just grease your cookie sheet and after baking refrigerate for 1 hour then just twist like an ice cube tray to release :)

Okay, big warning (not the recipes fault, but my understocked grocery store's) : Do NOT use salted butter for the toffee or else you'll be accosted by the salty taste! But again, not the recipes fault. Otherwise this was DELICIOUS. You'd never know these were saltines! The second time I made these I used unsalted butter and it was FANTASTIC. Also, I like toffee more than I like chocolate (I know, I'm bizarre), so I doubled the toffee recipe and followed another reviewers advice and poured half the toffee over a layer, then put a second layer of crackers on top, and put the next layer of toffee. Mmmmm. You literally couldn't tell these were saltines! A friend of mine suggests using matzo instead of saltines because that's how he makes his :)

OMG, this is THE BEST!!! Although it's super simple, the timing of it is actually rather precarious... Glad I read a few reviews cause instructions are rather vague for a recipe where one minute off can totally ruin the whole thing. One sleeve of crackers is just the right amount. Definately start a timer for EXACTLY 3 mins from the time it STARTS to fully boil and DO NOT STIR WHILE BOILING (ok to stir a little bit before boiling begins to mix up sugar & melted butter). Also, once in the oven, I'd say 4-5 mins cause I did nearly 6 and my edges were burned. I wanted to use milk chocolate chips, but in a ding-dong moment accidentally bought 62% cacao chunks. Mixed 1-1/4C with about 3/4C milk chips I already had and it came out super good... Really, any chocolate will do, depending on your preference. The chocolate melted and spread very easily and right after that I put the whole pan in the frige and broke it all up about an hour later (it was set after 30mins). I didn't have any problem getting it off the cookie sheet (with all that butter in there!)- most of it acutally came up in one solid piece which I broke up into about 1/2 cracker sized pieces, put in a gallon ziploc and stored in the frige. These are pretty rich, and that's coming from someone with a major sweet tooth... I might sprinkle a little sea salt on top of a few next time... I love salty/sweet... :)

These were a big hit at our house this year. One thing I would do differently though is I would somehow line the pan because it stuck to the pan really bad

These are great, especially for Christmas gifts.  Definitely a must to use a cookie pan with sides, cover it with foil and spray with cooking spray so that removal and clean-up is a snap.  I use a pan that allows about 45-50 crackers and completely pave the pan with crackers.  4 ounces of crackers seems a bit too few for the amount of toffee and chocolate.  Never had the need to return pan to oven to melt the chocolate for spreading and I found that FINELY chopped pecans pressed gently into the chocolate helps keep most of the nuts from falling off when cooled.  Don't worry about trying to break them up according to the crackers - I actually prefer the random sized pieces since it's more like a bark than a cookie.  Thanks so much for a great, fun recipe!

Thanks for great tips from reviewers.  Used parchment, one sleeve of saltines fills 15x10 sheet, place crackers salt down, don't stir when boiling, use dark brown sugar, bake at 350 for 7-8 mins, watch it doesn't burn, let set at room temp then cut with pizza cutter then fridgerate. I prefer milk chocolate.

GREAT AND EASY!  I did use the tips of other reviewers by using greased disposable pans. To those with a candy thermometer, the sugar mixture should be at the "soft-ball stage" or 230 degrees. Make sure you start timing the three minutes at a full rolling boil, not before. :)  Other than than, perfection!  :)

I have made this recipe multiple times and everyone loves it! Many of my friends call it "Crack Candy" instead of Cracker Candy because it is that addicting. The few tips I have learned are that like others have stated...it is crucial to spray the foil before baking. Make sure you count the 3 minute boiling time from the moment you have a good boil going or use a candy thermometer get it to about 270-290 degrees (soft crack) and once you spread the toffee on the crackers and put it in the oven it will reach hard crack stage for sure. We keep it in the fridge once it has cooled completely and has been broken into peices. I find that if you refrigerate or freeze before it is cooled completely the toffee tends to be a little softer/stickier instead of hard and crunchy. I guess it all comes down to preference. Either way...I have never heard any complaints when making this yummy dessert. It's easy and very very good. Enjoy!

Biggest  hit treat I have made in 40+ years.  There are so many possibilities with variations.  Different nuts, or add fruits as soon as they come out of the oven.
Best trick is to use parchment paper, NOT FOIL, and you don't need the cooking spray.  The cooking spray makes it greasy but the parchment paper also absorbs the excess butter making the treat greasless. 
Ingredients you can add are dried fruits, coconut, sprinkles, every nut possible, sea salt, etc..
And I have even tried it with different kinds of crackers....graham, other snack crackers of all kinds.  But the saltine is always the best....and I do use the salted....
I love this recipe.....enjoy!

I didn't read the reviews and I ended up with saltine toffee crumbles instead of cookies because of the toffee sticking to the pan.  However they are still very tasty and can double as ice cream or yogurt toppers for the occasional sweet fix!  I will try again and I will line my pan with either wax or tin foil with non-stick cooking spray.  Regardless of my mistake I still give it 4 stars!

This is my second Christmas making this recipe. Very good and quite easy to make. They do taste very much like a Heath bar, don't let the saltines fool you. A few tips I have learned. First, I line my cookie sheet with parchment paper. This makes it much easier to remove. Second, I put mine in the freezer for an hour or so once I'm done and they have cooled a bit on the counter. I have found this makes it very easy to remove them and you can break them into "cookie" size pieces quite easily! Also, I tried it last year with the dark brown sugar as it calls for, but this year I used light brown sugar. It turns out either way, but I think the dark has a more "toffee" taste to it when finished. Overall, highly recommend this one!

If you love toffee, you will love these!  I wouldn't call them a cookie, much more like a candy.  I used a large jelly roll pan and used 1 1/2 sleeves of crackers.  I lined my pan with my silpat liner and they came out beautifully.  Don't expect these to "break" along the shapes of the crackers.  They break into various shapes, but still look very nice.  I think I will use more crackers (2 sleeves) next time because I prefer the taste of the few that aren't overwhelmed by the toffee mixture.  They were very easy to make and a huge hit at my BBQ!  Definitely one to make again and again and again and again :-)

I use unbleached parchment paper that is too big for the pan.  I like it with dark chocolate - fair trade of course!  Try all different nuts and combinations of nuts/fruit.  Pistachio & Pine, Walnut & Dried Cherry, etc...  

After you spread the melted chocolate chips and put on the nuts put the whole thing in the freezer.  Then start getting ready for the next batch and after a few minutes the toffee will have cooled and you can lift it up by the the parchment paper and leave it in the fridge and pull out the pan to make the next batch!  It sets really quickly and you can put batch after batch on top of each other.

I leave mine in the freezer overnight and then break it up the next day - I just use my hands.  Since it's so cold it just breaks into nice pieces.  Then put into a container and keep in the freezer until you are ready to give/serve.

I make A LOT of batches of these every year.  I give it as a gift, bring it potlucks and have extra for those "emergency" situations.

These are delicious!  Everyone I have made them for loved them!  The second time I made them it was for work and a co-worker hates pecans, so I put toasted almonds on and they were great!  But don't overcook the sugar mixture.  It will harden up a little too much.  And make sure you put them on parchment paper or foil before pouring the sugar mixture over.  And for sure, put them on a cookie sheet with sides! The first time I made them they boiled over all over the stove.  Lesson learned.  Also, it helps if you put the bars back in the oven for a minute after you sprinkle on the chocolate chips.  They spread easier.  Yummy!

These were awesome! We used cinnamon flavored graham crackers, milk chocolate chips, and walnuts. I cooled and keep them in the freezer or they get gooey. I did have the same problem others had with sticking. Next time I will follow suggestions of others to use foil, don't stir while boiling, and keep oven long enough. I will definately make again.

These are great! 4 oz of saltine crackers is 1 sleeve; 1 cup of butter is 2 sticks; 2 cups of chocolate chips is the whole regular size bag.  Hope this helps because I misunderstood some of the directions but made a save by making a double batch.  Also, make sure these bake in the center of the oven....my one cookie sheet was too close to the oven wall and burned about a 1/4" in.  Put in refrigerator 2 hrs to chill/harden very well.  Will be a regular cookie I will make for bake sales and holidays!!!  Oh....almost forgot....I topped my chocolate/nuts with tiny sprinkling of Sea Salt which complimented the cookies very well.

Excellent. I used a 9x13 glass pan (lined with foil and  nonstick spray), and about a sleeve and a half of the cheapest saltine crackers at the store. Not greasy at all, and delicious. Instructions were very easy to follow, and I didn't change a thing. Thanks!

YUM!  Giving all of my husband's co-workers a bag full of goodies and I was looking for different things I could put in.  I recently had some of these and they were delish, so I thought I'd try them.  Very good.  Just a couple tips from other reviewers: 1) Line a rimmed cookie sheet with foil and very lightly spray with cooking spray for easier removal of toffee.  2) Start the 3 minute timing of the boiling once it's pretty much a hard boil and DO NOT STIR the caramel while boiling.  3) Either dark or light brown sugar will work, but dark gives a richer toffee flavor.  4) Toasting the pecans first enriches their flavor.  5) Either salted or unsalted butter also works; I used unsalted this time because it's what I had and just added 1/2t. salt to caramel boil.  I also used dark chocolate, because it's what I had.  I think this would be good with any chocolate.

It's a classic.  Use parchment paper.  sprinkle crushed saltines on top to help absorb excess grease.  Nut lovers:  increase the nuts and put on before pouring toffee (I love pecans and almonds).  They toast magnificently.  Afterward, just sprinkle chocolate of choice on top til spreadable.  Sharlene and I call these labor cookies because when we give them to friends who have reached their due date, ba-da-bing - they go into labor!

This is definitly a "better than s*x cookie"!! Easy to make, but I recommend "pressing" the nuts into the warm chocolate (I used Milk) before cooling. I didn't do this the first time and most of my nuts fell off when I broke apart the cookies.

You can't get easier or better than these! We used milk chocolate chips...we think they taste better. Also, it's best to line your pan with foil then lightly butter or spray the foil. You'll have no problems with them sticking. Absolutely wonderful!!!

I didn't have brown sugar so I used 1/2 honey and 1/2 white sugar, it still worked great! (I also used milk chocolate chips.) This is also good with chopped peanuts on top.

I hate to be the party pooper here, but -- I wish there was a negative stars rating!  I can't BELIEVE all the good reviews on these.They taste like sugary saltine crackers with chocolate smeared on them.  I can't believe anyone would even THINK about giving these as gifts, when you turn them over you can see the saltines!

These were so easy to make, and I had TONS of people ask me for the recipe.  

Tips:  Make sure when you make these that you LINE your pan with foil, to make them easier to remove and break up.  Also, I used a little more than 4 oz. of crackers.  I used a jelly roll pan and I lined the entire bottom of it.  I used about 6 oz. (1 and 1/2 "tube" packages of crackers)  Hope it turns out well for you!  Thanks for the recipe Tracy!!

My whole family loves this recipe. I love it because it's easy, ships well, and is a great addition to holiday plates.
Only caution- be really careful taking the pan out of the oven. Keep the pan level or it will spill all over. DON'T let kids do that part!

I made these as holiday gifts for my coworkers.  One of them said "these are more addicting than crack".  She's right.  They are so yummy and oh so good.  I used an 11x17 cookie sheet with sides and lined it with non stick aluminum foil.  This was super easy.  One important tip: mix the butter and brown sugar together until combined over low heat - then bring it up to a boil and DO NOT STIR IT!!  No matter how badly you want to.  Let it boil for 3 minutes and pour it over the crackers.  Perfection!

Very disappointed!  Perhaps I made this incorrectly (packed the sugar too tightly?), but if that is the case, this is definitely not a fool proof recipe as many reviewers made it sound like it was.  The toffee came out terribly.  I really wanted to be able to give this as gifts as it sounded delicious and easy, but unfortunately, I am going to have to continue looking for another recipe to replace this one.

My mom has a recipe like this one, and we've made it every year - it's sooooo good!  What we do is fill the pan with saltines, and the edges that don't get a full saltine, we break saltines in half to fill in the border.  When we sprinkle on the chips, we just cover with foil for about 5 minutes, instead of sticking it back in the oven, and the chips are nice and melted and spreadable.  We also sprinkle on some of the sundae topping nuts instead of walnuts.  AND we line the pan with foil and then grease it so they come out super easy.  When they are broken into abstract shapes and wrapped or put in a jar, they make a great holiday hostess gift or gift in general.  YUM!!!!

One word best describes this recipe: YUM!!! I made it with my 7-year-old and we loved it!! Not only was it a cinch to make, but it was fun and it tasted great!! The changes I made: I used MILK-chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet and I used walnuts instead of pecans. Delicious!! My family and I preferred the milk chocolate over the semi-sweet... very good! Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent and super easy to make! I did exactly what the directions specified--I didnt touch it once it started boiling and it turned out great. I used semi-sweet chocolate on the top and instead of pecans, I used sliced almonds. My husband says it tastes exactly like Almond Roca--which we both love. I plan on making this more often; it is so easy and cheap to make. A keeper!

This is my first attempt at making toffee, and it was incredibly easy and delicious! You wouldn't even know it was made out of saltines! I used 1 sleeve of saltine crackers which barely covered the bottom of my rimmed cookie sheet. This is very easy to make and I found no need for foil, these released perfectly and when sprinkled with pecans were heaven. Thanks so much for the wonderful recipe!

Very good! I just made a few alternations, and they turned out nicely. I made them for my mother with food allergies, so I used gluten-free corn chips instead of saltines and all natural brown sugar and chocolate. They were a little overly sweet but still nice once they were refrigerated for a while.

If you're a chocolate/toffee fan, you will love these!  I like my toffee to be more crunchy, so I boil for 8-10 minutes (start timing when it comes to a full rolling boil) instead of 5 before putting it in the oven (once it comes to a full rolling boil, do not stir it).  Once in the oven, I wait until it starts to bubble before timing it for 3-5 minutes.  I also like mine with a mixture of peanut butter and milk choclate chips...so yummy!  It tastes like a peanut butter Skor bar.

these were a favorite for the holiday season. definitely take other reviewers advice and line the cookie sheet with foil and spray with cooking spray. watch the time on these as they do not forgive the slightest bit of over cooking.

Wow...these are incredible...I followed other's instructions and lined the baking sheet with foil.  I was originally worried because the butter and dark brown sugar smelled weird while it was cooking but I just went with it.  I didn't stir it while it was cooking.  It turned out great so don't be weary of the funny smell.  I lined the baking sheet with 1 sleeve of crackers and then crushed about 1/3 of another package to make sure it didn't come out greasy.  I don't know if that was necessary but it didn't mess up the recipe..that for sure.  I used mini semisweet morsels because they melt faster and placed it back in the oven to melt the chips.  I pressed the pecans down into the chocolate to make sure they stuck.  I tried cutting it after it was already cooled and that didn't work.  Breaking it worked fine (and I had fun eating the crumbs!).  I was wondering how to store them so I put half in the fridge in tupperware and the other half out on the counter.  Both were fine, the counter version seemed softer and stuck in the teeth easier...ANYWAY...this recipe is amazing and easy and cheap...it doesn't get any better than that!

YUMMM!!!! This is a great recipe! Turned out perfect. The only thing I did was double the boiling time to ensure that the toffee wasn't gooey when it set up.  I used milk chocolate chunks instead of semi sweet chips.  Tastes like a Heath Bar but better!!  Easy, cheap (considering how much one batch makes!) and delicious :)  I keep the crumbs in the freezer to use as an Ice Cream topper!!

Just by complete mistate, I only added 1/2 cup of butter and it turned out absolutely fantastic.  I only realised my mistate when I was sharing the recipe with my Mum.  I don't know what 1 cup of butter would be like, but why mess with perfect?  I think 1/2 cup of butter is all you need.  Thanks so much for the recipe Tracy.  I only made it because it sounded so strange.  Well done!!!!

These cookies are fantastic!!  I made them at Christmas in tins and for a recent reunion, and everyone raved and demanded the recipe.  Very easy to make and so addicting to eat!  I used finely ground pecans which made for a nice presentation.  Even my husband, who is a chef, gave them a major thumbs-up!

I love this recipe!!  Made it 3 or 4 times.  I put in the frig for approximately 2 or 3 hours to cool.   When I place them on a plate to serve at room temp, the choc gets soft and melts.   What am I doing wrong?   Softening doesn't seem to be a big problem because it is such a hit.  But, I would like to know how to stop the choc softening at room temp so I can give as Christmas cookie exchange.   Your suggestions please - - - - -

I made these the other night for a work function, there were none left! I used my nonstick baking sheet, unlined, with no sticking issues (Sabatier is the best if you can find them!). It was 95 degrees out, my AC was on and still 80 in the house. I did whisk the brown sugar/butter because I started to smell burnt sugar- I used dark brown sugar. I baked at 400 for only 5 minutes, and the sugar layer spread out quite nicely, reaching the edges I could not when it started to cool. I used a whole regular bag of Special Dark chips, waited for 5 minutes, and spread with no problem. I put the whole pan in the fridge to cool, and then used my meat cleaver to cut them. I left them out at work, and when they warmed up to room temp, they were not overly gooey, just right. These have a whole cup of sugar in them, so I don't understand the complaints of being too sweet- of course they will be sweet! The dark chocolate/sweet brown sugar/salted tops Saltines complemented each other quite nicely; I did not use nuts, as we have food allergies. Overall, I would make these again, they were a huge hit! Word to the wise, the brown sugar/butter is WICKED HOT, be careful! Thank you for the recipe!

This recipe is great.  I've been making it for years and no one ever believes me when I tell them that the base is saltines!  One thing that I like to do that's different, because I'm not a big pecan person, is put M&M's and broken pretzel twists on the top.  It gives it the extra-crunch as well as extra chocolate flavor.  This a great recipe for all ages!

I really like this recipe.  My mom makes this with 1/2 cup white sugar instead of the brown - but I think the brown is better since it gives it more of a toffee flavor.  Great recipe and a big hit.

This was a quick and delicious treat.  It went over well at a holiday tea at work.  Not sure if it was necessary, but I used foil and sprayed it.

Wow. First of all, I lined my baking sheet (with sides) with non stick aluminum foil, and VERY lightly sprayed it with Pam. I actually then took a napkin and wiped a lot of it off, I didn't want the crackers to soak it up. I then used 1 and 1/2 cups brown sugar and 1 and 1/2 stick of butter. I used real, unsalted butter since the crackers I used were regular saltines. The brown sugar and butter started to boil and I timed it for three minutes and kept stirring. Once done, I poured it over my layer of saltines very carefully. It made plenty, and by the time they were in the oven for 5 minutes, the crackers were floating on a fine layer of sauce, ensuring that the bottoms of the crackers will not be exposed. I also used a little more chocolate chips than suggested. Maybe 2 and 1/2 cups. I poured them over and popped it back in the oven for about 30 seconds and the chips spread like a dream. Stuck in the fridge overnight and broke it up the next day. Beautiful and tastes fantastic! What an easy and cheap recipe!

Taste fabulous!  Like many others, it was a challenge to lift the cookies from the tin foil.  I'll definitely use the quick release foil suggestion from others.  Here's a tip - use a pizza cutter to break into 'cleaner' squares before removing from baking sheet.  Enjoy!

What a waste of money!Pecans are to expensive to waste on this recipe.Everything set up fine but the only taste was the bitterness/flavor of the semi-sweet chocolate.May be better using milk chocolate.

These cookies are so yummy and always a hit.  I use a disposable 13x9 cookie sheet and it doesn't need any spraying.  The cookies pop off with no problem and the cookie sheet can be used again.  Definitely a hit in my house!

At first, it wasn't quite as good as I was expecting with all the 5 star ratings, but it does nicely in a pinch if you need a quick fix. I'll probably experiment with it to make it thicker. The thickness of a single saltine cracker isn't anything to get all excited over. Maybe a thicker cracker would make them perfect. My husband took a taste, made a face and said, "This is really salty." They are alot better after sitting in the fridge at least over night. I made them 2 days ago. I just had one and thought, "OK these are better now!"

These cookies were really easy to make and tasted great.  The recipe left out one very important step.  Grease the pan!  We broke a spatula trying to get these out of our cookie sheet.

I'm just going to have to keep trying with this recipe. The first time I tried, I didn't use foil and I ruined my jelly roll pan, despite liberally spraying with cooking spray. I knew it was ruined anyway, because I stirred the caramel the entire time, and I'm not sure what was wrong with my chocolate chips, but they looked almost grainy as I spread them. I used Nestle Milk Chocolate. 

This time, I used a glass pan, but it looked awful coming out of the oven... Soggy? I put the melted chocolate on it anyway, and I can see a layer of grease forming along the sides of the glass... I'll wait to see how it sets up, but I suspect I will try again with a regular jelly roll pan and release foil. I'm determined to make this work!

I came across these at a Farmers/Craft market a few years ago and the kids and I loved them.  I knew I had to find the recipe.  And here it is.  Soooo good! And easy to decorate a bit depending on the occasion.....add candy corn or orange/black sprinkles for Halloween, crushed candy canes for Christmas.....really any little decoration for any occasion if you so choose.  In my opinion though, you don't need to change or add anything! Delicious!

I made this last night and took it into the office today.  It was a HIT!  No one could believe it was made with saltine crackers.  So easy.  I made sure to have a good rolling boil and then boiled for 3 minutes.  The baking it was the perfect ending.  I used 1 cup of mini chocolate chips and 1 cup of Heath Bar bits and about 1 cup of toasted pecans.  Next time I'd put the pecans on right when it comes out and then sprinkle on the chips.  A lot of the topping came off but it was still delicious.  Thank you for this great recipe.

I used this as my inspiration except used white sugar to get a lighter more buttery flavor rather than the deeper butterscotch flavor from the brown sugar (I've used the brown sugar in the past and it's great, too)  I added a couple tsps of corn syrup to the mixture as well to "seed" the mixture for proper crystalization.  Following the timing instructions in this particular recipe, it worked perfectly.   I like not having to deal with the candy thermometer if I don't have to in small batch candy recipes.  The color was enough to clue me in this recipe.

Love, love, love that this recipe is so simple, easy, and quick to prepare. I'm going to try it without the crackers, though, as I think it sort of detracted from the taste rather than adding to it. But it was still good and I will make this again.

Amazing!  I didn't use foil and they came out just fine.  I put them in the fridge and after they were cold they came out just fine.  I didn't even butter the pan!  If you eat them cold they are crunchy and if you let them get to room temp they are soft.  I like them both ways. :)

Love love love this recipe! Easy to make and usually the hit of a party. Have made this several times and have mixed it up with other nuts like almond and walnuts - still turns out fantastic. Took other readers' advice on letting the sugar boil without stirring. After breaking, I place the pieces in a container and freeze them before serving.

These are amazing!  I made these before using saltines, but this time used Townhouse crackers and found that my family actually prefers the Townhouse crackers.  Totally addictive!

This is fantastic.  I tried it for the Christmas holiday and everyone loved it. I ended up making a second batch to get us through the New Year, and then made another batch for my Bunco group.  So many people asked for the recipe and I sent this link right to them.  A lot of folks were pleased at the fact that the toffee wasn't hard to chew.

Absolutely delicious. Instead of pecans, try marshmallow and pretzels with milk and white chocolate. Place the marshmallow on top of the cracker toffee layer and let the marshmallows melt a bit in the oven before topping with chocolate. Toasted slivered almonds and broken candy cane pieces are also great toppers. Try this, it is amazing!!

Love these! I cover my pan with crackers even if it means I have to break some into smaller pieces to make them all fit. I do not use foil on the pan, have never had a problem with cleaning the pan later or any other problems. The key to the pecans not falling off is to chop them really small, plus it's prettier if you do this too. I always let mine cool by putting them in the fridge for a little bit, then they come right out of the pan and they're easy to break apart. Very easy recipe that seems like it should be difficult to make!

So let me start off by saying this is not an accurate review, as I have made changes and did not follow the original recipe.  Here's what I did.  Instead of the 4 oz saltines, I used 9 oz potato chips and smooshed them down so they were relatively flat on the bottom of the pan, but not to the point that they were crumbs.  Because I used more than double the amount of saltines/chips that it called for, I made more of the toffee...I only made 1 1/2 times more instead of doubling it like I should have, but honestly I think I should have just left it at the original amount of toffee with the extra chips...I mean, it was GREAT, but for my taste the toffee just overpowered a lil too much and made it too rich.  A bit more potato chip flavor and less toffee would have made it EXCELLENT!  All that being said, you MUST try it with potato chips instead of saltines!  I have had the saltine version before, and don't get me wrong, it's awesome, but the chips are just an unexpected twist that people just never expected...and you still get the sweet/salty combo and a nice crunch...needless to say it was fun seeing people try to figure out what was in them, and was begged for the recipe by the end of the night.

Tried at a party in spring & could not stop eating! I searched the web for recipe & planned to give to family and neighbors for holidays. First batch used margarine - did not come out well and threw out. Woops! 2nd batch used butter. Still not as tasty as I remembered. I did something wrong...maybe should have used milk choc instead of semi sweet? As reviewers said, I did wait 3 min without stirring after the boil, let it cool slightly before pouring over saltines (the 1st time I did not wait and soaked thru saltines like water- did not seem right??), baked few minutes after bubbling in oven.  Choc was hard to spread! Sprinkled crushed walnuts and sprinkles on top. After all the work, I did give to family in tins at each place setting, but was not fond of it myself! 2 stars b/c I followed the recipe and can't figure out what went wrong!

I used the individual Saltines instead of the sheet and it was so easy because there was no need to cut them. They came out in perfect squares.

I made this EXACTLY as written but it didn't work. The toffee never set up and the chocolate chips didn't melt. I put it back into the oven hoping to get the chips melted but after 7 or 8 minutes I gave up hope. I figured I would let it sit for a bit and give them a taste anyway. Not so good. It was overpoweringly sweet and the toffee was still gooey. The crackers were still somewhat crisp so that helped. 
Probably will not try this again.

This is a great recipe, and is delicious, but the cooking time in the oven is not long enough. It turns out chewy. I cook it for 10 minutes so it turns out crunchy like toffee.

I just had to try this recipe because of the saltine crackers. I guess it peeked my curiousity and I was amazingly suprised at how they turned out. One of my co-workers loves toffee and she couldn't stop eating them. I found though, that they tasted better days after they were made. Will definitly add these to my Christmas baking list. Thansk!

These are excellent.  If anyone is interested, the Passover version, made with matza, is even better!  Just substitute matza for the saltines and break them into small pieces after they have cooled.
I have also tried the recipe with graham crackers and it is not nearly as good.
I've also used several kinds of nuts at one time and it was good.

these were great - and easy!  i think i will be making these every christmas!  i lined my baking sheet with foil & did not have any problems with sticking.  i also scored it before breaking into pieces, that seemed to help break into more "even" pieces. thanks for the recipe!   next year i might try using graham crackers.  =)

These are soooo good, I have made them about 4 times since I found this recipe and each time they have turned out awesome. Only hints I have are if you don't have cooking spray on hand, just butter the tin foil, it works just as well and also to cut them use a pizza cutter it works wonders. These are so easy to make and you can use any time of chips on them, but I prefer milk chocolate.

Very good! I served it at a party today and got rave reviews.  I did use light butter.  Here is the lowdown on that decision...  As far as taste it was still amazing!  It was a bit wetter on the bottom than it would have been if I had used real butter.  If you plan on keeping it for awhile or giving it out in tins, light butter is not an option.  If you are making it to serve within a day, just cut parchment paper neatly, or use doilies in between layers on your platter and you will be ok.  You must also keep them in the fridge.  The taste is still great and it cuts the fat tremendously.  Also, for anyone who celebrates Passover, this is going to be Matzah Toffee Crisps for me!  I know it will blow everyone away!  I have a similar recipe for that but this is easier and I am sure will be better.

After making this recipe I realized I couldn't get it out of the pan! Unless you use a non-stick pan, or line the pan with foil, the cookies are stuck. They aren't pretty when you try to pry them out either. I would also suggest using more crackers so it's more crunchy and not so chewy.

***Update 10/31/10: USE BUTTER (not margarine). This will make it a 5 star recipe!! 
Line a 10x15x1 baking sheet with foil, lightly spray with cooking spray. Line with saltines and bend the foil up on the end where there is a little space left. Pour on toffe mixture and make sure you bake it long enough to avoid chewiness. Make sure they coll completely before you break them into pieces.

Fabulously easy!  For those with nut allergies - sprinke rice krispies on the top for a sweet crunch.

We call these "Crackies" at our house.   One of the things that is most satisfying about this recipes is the ingredient amounts.  1 cup of butter is 2 sticks, 4oz of crackers is 1 sleeve, 2 cups of chocolate chips is almost exactly 1 bag.  I love that I can make this and not have leftover ingredients in my cupboard for ages. (I'm looking at you capers!)

This is the second year that this has become my 'go-to' recipe, and it got rave reviews, once again.  It is SO easy, and I work for a Catholic school where the Fathers heard that I make these in droves and asked me to PLEASE make some for them!  Any one that has any problems with it...3 minutes of boiling, start to finish, is THE key, and instead of nuts I use Heath Brickle Bits.  Going to try this again using Special Dark chocolate...Thank you, so much, for a WONDERFUL recipe!

All I can say is BEWARE! Consider yourself warned that this recipe is HIGHLY ADDICTIVE!! I've written very few reviews in the past, but let me tell you this recipe FORCED ME to write a review! Yeah, it was THAT good! I made this per the other reviewers, used an 11x17 pan lined w/foil and sprayed with non stick coconut oil spray. I did not stir the butter/brown sugar mixture, baked it for 6 mins, then I let it cool for nearly two hours on the counter top then placed it in the refrigerator for about 15 mins. For cutting - as one reviewer recommended, using a pizza cutter cut them perfectly! I used rice crackers and wanted to try it out with these as a test @ home before I made it for a gathering (we eat gluten free). THEY CAME OUT PERFECT! I would caution NOT to make these just for yourself as you may end up eating the whole pan all by yourself (just like I almost did)!! Love love loved it!!!

These were great! I ended up making a whole bunch of them to give out as gifts. I ended up putting them in a tin with some homemade fudge as well (recipe also in here on Allrecipes). This definitely will be a go to for gifts for the holidays! Yum!

Follow the directions and it works every time. MUST STIR the entire time while boiling the butter and sugar. After it comes to a boil, turn down stove and use a light boil for the 3 minutes. I use a jelly roll pan and line with parchment paper. When cooled I put in freezer for at least an hour. Try with the mini pretzles. It is even better. I don't use the nuts.

I have made these many many times over the last few years and they are SOOO good. My advice(I'm sure this has been said already!) make sure you use real butter! Margarine just won't work right, I found that out the hard way. Don't count your three minutes until it STARTS boiling. Don't use too big of a pan! I have a set of three cookie sheets and the middle one is the best by experience. Don't leave them in the oven too long!! I have scorched them and though they were still yummy, they had a distinct burnt flavor. There CAN be too much chocolate so stick with the two cups, don't be tempted to add too many. Ok, I think that's it, enjoy!

As my mom usually makes a version of these for holidays, I absolutely LOVE this type of cookie/candy/whatevertheheck category this addicting sweet falls under.  As I had some time this afternoon, I embarked upon the task of recreating it myself, holidays-be-damned!

So. I used the cheap, store-brand saltines (Stoppies, in my case, perfectly fine sub, and tasty in soup as well), semi-sweet chips, dark brown sugar, salted butter, and a disposable cookie sheet, sprayed with some, again, store-brand version of Pam.  Save some money where you can. :)

I followed the directions here and the tips.  Most people said DO NOT STIR your butter/brown sugar deliciousness while it is bubbling about on the stove.  I did take that to heart (even if I did want to stir!) and let it go, then poured it over my lovingly laid out crackers, then, yep, to the oven.

Where, said delicious concoction overflowed my flimsy baking sheet and set off my smoke alarm.  Small annoyance.  Plinked the battery out of the smoke alarm.  Shook my fist at the stove.  Gah.

Anyhow, all ended well.  From oven, chips, spread, threw a few nuts about, fridge.

Chewy, delicious goodness.  My end product had a bit more "chew" to it than my Mom's does (hers is brittle), so I may not have cooked the toffee enough.

I don't care though, its darn good!! Gonna share with my co-workers tomorrow.  Everyone needs a pick-up on a Monday.  :)

I also used a jelly roll pan, at least that is what my mother calls it, 11x17 or 18 I think. And boiling the Brown sugar and Butter in the microwave makes it much easier and less chance to burn. Doesn't take long at all.

I hate when people change a recipe and then review it based on their changes, so I'll admit that 1/4 of the "butter" I used was earth balance sticks because that was all I had on hand. My cookies stayed a little gooey. I was expecting a hard toffee. Not sure if this is how the recipe works out or if the earth balance messed it up. Overall it was good, but not good enough to make it into the Christmas cookie list this year.

Although I timed everything exactly as directed so that I didn't cook longer than required, the cookies tasted a tiny bit burned to me. Maybe 30 seconds less would have prevented that. My husband loved them.

These are excellent !  I used ground almonds on top of the chocolate and a light sprinkle of sea salt.  Followed the recipe, but did use white sugar instead of brown.  I had no problems - everything came together perfectly.  I'll be making these again !

These are a favorite in our house and super easy to make. You can leave the top alone, after the chocolate is melted or you can sprinkle with chopped nuts or heath bars....make sure the chocolate is still warm when you put the toppings on so it will stick.

This is so totally bad for you but it taste so good it doesn't even matter! I used unsalted saltines, light brown sugar instead of dark brown, and omitted the pecans because I didn't have any. Also the chocolate chips didn't melt all the way on their own so I popped them back into the oven after I sprinkled the chocolate on. The toffee kind of taste like caramel and it is so so good! Perfect for the holidays.

This is now on my list of things I have to make at Christmas. I was a little worried when it came out of the oven. I was sure I was going to have to throw the whole thing out. It really didn't look like it would come out of the pan. I left it alone and when it cooled down, it popped right now. Thanks for the easy recipe.

I made this for my Son to take to his office.  Asked how they liked it, he said they kept coming back for more.  I'm making it again for his office and for the family to have on Christmas Eve.  I used parchment paper and it worked great.  Thank you , I'll be making this for a lot of occasions.

Amazing! I have been making these for years and tried several variations. My favorite is chopped salted mixed nuts and raisins. Everyone loves them! I have also used white sugar instead of brown and even reduced it to 3/4 and didn't notice a difference. These are a staple every holiday season!

Absolutely delicious and crazy easy!  After reading many reviews, I did use no-stick aluminum foil on a sided cookie sheet and had no trouble releasing these.  Left them on the counter for about 5 hours before breaking into pieces.  The butter/sugar mixture was not stirred during the boiling process and turned out perfectly!  It just soaks into the crackers while baking......wonderfully crispy and yummy.  You won't be sorry you tried this treat!!!

This recipe was great! Super easy to make and I have gotten so many compliments on it. I would recommend for the holiday season, putting candy cane bits on top. It is very festive and tastes delish!

Simply amazing!  I used Ghiradelli milk chocolate chips and it was outstanding.  Definitely put them in the fridge before breaking into pieces.  Also, I sprinkled Christmas candies on top and they turned out beautiful.

They came out really tasty but a little gritty so I added a little bit of heavy whipping cream to the toffee mixture. and cooked a litter longer on the stove and in the oven because the first time the toffee was a little gritty. I linned my pan with foil, no problems there.  I also added a little sprinkle of sea salt, for the sweet salty contrast everyone likes. I wonder if these would work on kettle cooked potato chips?Had to put in the freezer because after an hour the chocolate was still soft. I will be bringing these to a christmas brunch/ cookie exchange, I think they will be a hit.

These tasted great! I tried it this way and then I tried it w/Milk Chocolate chips and Almonds. I like the Milk Chocolate better. The semi-sweet chips gave it a burnt marshmallow flavor. Which is good but not the flavor I was going for on these..lol! I've made these twice in one week already!!  Holidays are coming up and I plan on making them again. They're cheap, quick and easy to make!

This is an amazing recipe.....one that you wouldn't expect to be so delicious.  When I make it I top
it with chocolate chips, peanut butter chips, chopped
skor bars, chopped pecans.  Sometimes I add white
chocolate chips as well.  When you take the crackers out of the oven, they are extremely hot, so I always have every topping in individual dishes ready to sprinkle on, that way I don't need to 
spread the toppings........it looks better to see each individual topping........and believe me, it is still
absolutely amazing!!!  I break them up and package in tins and give to friends as one of the other people wrote.  They are ALWAYS happily
accepted........thanks for this great recipe!
Also, I use regular sugar with the butter instead of brown sugar, and my family and friends like it
better.  Try it!

This turned out to be a quick solution before attending a dinner at the home of a couple with 2 young children. As I hadn't the entire ingredient list, I used white sugar, 2 dark chocolate bars and crushed roast almonds as substitutes. The hostess used the toffee candy as garnish to vanilla ice cream. Fantastic! Thanks for sharing.

We make this recipe all the time and keep in the freezer for play dates.  We substitute matzo for the saltines, especially when the super market offers 5 lbs. free certain times a year.

These are so addicting.  I actually boiled the butter and sugar in the microwave forgetting it was a 3 minute boil (without recipe in hand),  immediately took it out poured the mixture over the crackers and put in the oven.   these came out delicious!   Next time, I will boil for 3 minutes and see if it makes a difference.

Made these on Saturday to bring to work on Wednesday. They didn't make it!! They were sooo good - my only complaint was that the toffee was more like a caramel. Although I think that may have been my fault - I started the 3 minute timer just as I started to see bubbles. I will DEFINITELY be making this again, only I will not start timing until the full butter/sugar mixture is at a FULL rolling boil.

These are like CRACK. So dangerously easy and very, very good. Make at your own risk... I add some vanilla to the butter/sugar mixture- other variations I have used include substituting white sugar, adding some peppermint extract and using WHITE chocolate chips... oh the humanity! :)

They were wonderful.  The kids and the rest of the family just ate them up!  They are already asking me to make them again!  The only change I made is we used sliced almonds instead as none of us like pecans!  They were YUMMY!

Fantastic taste...we were so amazed it tasted like toffee using saltine crackers but could not get it out of the pan:( It was so hard. We will make this again but thoroughly coat the bottom of the pan to make sure it comes out, thanks for sharing!

Addictively delicious!  Chewy caramel, slightly crunchy, sweet, salty--Yummy! For variety, I did three strips of various nuts; almond, cashew, pecans.  So easy, I will be making these again soon!

These were SO easy to make and tasted SO delicious!  I used  a bit less of the pecans as my family doesn't really care for nuts.  I will definitely be making another batch for our Christmas Eve party.  Thank you!

I had passed up this recipe so many times...thinking it to be more of a "juvenile" recipe.  I made it today and of all the six desserts I made for Christmas..this is GONE already!!  Now I have to make more - WTH?  Thank you so much for a easy delicious cookie that everyone loves.

So good.  I bake mine for 10 minutes and then take out and spread on the chocolate.  Left off the nuts and instead made one version topped with toffee chips and one version topped with sea salt.

Delicious!  Followed recipe exactly, except lined my cookie sheet with foil (& sprayed it.)  Next time I will press the pecans into the melted chocolate.  A lot of them fell off when I broke it up b/c they didn't stick into the chocolate.

I jokingly call this "White Trash Candy Mash" as the saltines generally give people pause.  By changing the name, the expectations are lowered and everyone LOVES this!  Easy to decorate for various seasons or holidays.  Drizzle white chocolate over top to "class it up" a bit.  My suggestions (I think they should be mandatory):  1. Use a jelly roll pan!  2. Line the jelly roll pan with parchment!  It will save you heartache.

YUM! These were so easy and different! I love the salty/sweet flavors together. I used Ritz crackers because that is what I have, and I like them a lot more than Saltines. They were tasty!

These are great!  I followed the recipe exactly.  I followed the suggestion of boiling it for 3 minutes, not stirring.  The carmel burnt a little.  Poured over the crakers baked as recommended and then added the chocolate chips after letting cool for a few minutes I spread the chocolate which was very easy to do and added chopped walnuts that is all I had on hand.  I will make again.

I've made this twice, I thought the first time I did something wrong - so I tried again. Both times the cookies were difficult and messy to cut, a little too sweet, and had a slightly burned taste. I don't know if it's me or the recipe, but I won't try a third time.

The taste is definitely great- sweet and salty combined well.  My changes to the recipe for the second time(which came out better)is to first add a bottom layer of finely crushed almonds, THEN the crackers then follow the recipe, in a 9x13 instead. Also, I boiled the toffee for 5 minutes instead of 3 so it would crack more like toffee (not be so chewy).  Other than that- it was awesome!

These are the best! They never last long in my house and my mom makes them all the time! Super easy to make. Sometimes we sub the saltines for non-sugar/cinnamon graham crackers, and also use finely chopped almonds instead of pecans. JUST BEWARE- the bubbling hot cracker/butter/sugar mixture is dangerous coming out of the oven, be careful!

This recipe is so simple to make.  The most important part is to make sure that you boil the butter and brown sugar the full 3 minutes.

We call this recipe "bark" at my house too.  It was given to me by my sister-in-law after I munched on it during a holiday dinner.  Since then I have made it over and over, given as gifts for teachers and for my husband's co-workers.  Just a little tidbit- it is so easy to change up.  Use white chocolate and crushed peppermint candies for Christmas.  Dark chocolate and walnuts, milk chocolate with caramel, the possibilties are limitless!

Oh Tracy, Tracy, Tracy...I'm not a huge sweet eater, but this recipe is so darn delicous and totally addicting! I've had this in my recipe box for such a long time and finally decided to make this for our weekend get-a-way. If I don't stop munching, I won't have anthing left to take away with us. My only teeny tiny complaint was that I felt there was too much butter. I ended up adding more brown sugar to soak some of it up. No problem tho because they came out great. Like others, I lined my cookie sheet with foil and sprayed it with a light coating of cooking oil. I then placed the cookie sheet in the fridge to harden and the pieces broke beautifully. My hubby is going to love this because this is more like candy than a cookie. Thanks so,so much Tracy!!

I was a little leary at the sound of saltines in a toffee cookie recipe, but the ratings were so high I just had to try it.  These were so easy to make and absolutely delicious!  I made them for a Christmas Eve gathering, and had to make another batch for Christmas day.  Everyone raved about them, and there wasn't a morsel left over.   I did find it easier to break them up when the chocolate was hard, so I put it in fridge for awhile first.  They were great, simple, and something I will be making again for certain!!!

This is an easy and delicious treat!  I used regular brown sugar and no nuts.. I also sprayed foil and curled up the edges (so nothing would spill over) before I put the crackers on it.  I also just put the pan back in the oven for a minute once I poured the chocolate chips over it, so then you can spread it right away.  Really good!  :)

I don't think I have ever given 5 stars on any AllRecipe....until now. These are amazing!!! They are simple (don't even bother stirring!), quick, cheap and easy to customize. The taste is Heath Bar Gourmet. I am putting them in cello bags for teacher gifts....if I can keep them out of my evil clutches first!!

This recipe is great.  My first batch turned out great.  For the second I substituted margarine for the butter and the toffee was really soft and kind of wet. But using the butter, it all turned out so great!  A very yummy, easy treat!!

My whole family ADORES these cookies...  I always have to make two or three batches!  I use a cup and a half of the chocolate chips, otherwise I find the chocolate taste overwhelmes the toffee, which is what we like best.  And I ALWAYS line the pan with parchment paper first...  it makes cleanup relatively easy rather than the evil nightmare that it could be.

I almost coudn't believe it..crackers? So I just had to try. This was really great, everyone liked it, the only thing I would advise is to watch it carefully when its baking in the oven..the toffee burnt on the bottom half of mine. But the unburnt side - amazing..

Got high praise for this recipe. Like many others suggested, I lined my baking sheets with parchment. Many said tasted like a Heath bar, but softer.

Did not like this recipe!! Followed the directions perfectly but the cookies burnt in oven. 5 minutes is too long and also found that there was not enough of toffee mixture to cover the crackers. I agree with other reviewers that it just looked like crackers with goop smothered on top. Will not make again!!!

This was sooooooo good.  No one could tell it was a saltine cracker.  I did have problems removing them from the aluminum foil covered pan, but next time I'm definetly spraying the foil.  I'm making these for my cookie exchange, hopefully they'll be a huge hit.

I thought that these were aweful! They tasted like melted butter and  were just too greasy. When serving, they just looked like a craker with melted choclate on it. I would not make these again. Def. not worth all of the calories. Yuck!

OOOhhh, mama !!  This is a keeper.  Amazingly easy, and even better tasting. I salted and toasted the pecan pieces first, the salty-toffee-chocolate thing.....yummy. As other reviewers said, be sure and cover your baking sheet with foil - clean up couldn't be easier.  The only problem I had ??  It said 35 servings.  We only had 3 !!  :o)  Could be my math, though.....LOL

These are fabulous!  They're easy to make, and an inexpensive holiday candy to make and give.  I love the combination of salty with sweet!  I did not have a problem with them being too salty, and I did refrigerate mine before breaking as other suggested.  YUM!

First, thanks to those who said to use a foil-lined pan.  This made cleanup easy.  My 2 year old daughter, who prefers chips to candy, could not get enough.  I made this yesterday and this morning when she woke up, she wanted "more candy".  This is also a great substitute for those toffee cravings and you don't want to spend $10/lb. at the candy store.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Gosh we love these. So simple. The recipe as-is is perfect and a classic. The deal is you HAVE TO BOIL the sugar WITHOUT STIRRING for THREE MINUTES. But in order to not burn it, you can start off at a simmer and do NOT set to a higher burner temp (I put the butter in the pot on low, walk away while it melts, add the sugar when I am ready).  Because this is sugar + fat, the melting/boiling temp is much lower (on my electric range a full boil was at medium/5 setting). If you don’t boil it unstirred for 3 min, the sugar and fat will not incorporate, and you will wind up with a runny, not-candy-like mess of crackers. 
I have even made these when I was out of something- like whoops, don’t have chocolate chips, so I “made” chips with the universal substitute of 3:3:1 cocoa/sugar/butter and melted that on top. I am not a fan of nuts so I almost never use them, I am not a huge fan of toffee flavored things so I cut the brown sugar with half white sometimes. Add kosher or sea salt if you like the salted chocolate thing. Use whatever kind of chocolate or flavored chips or any combination thereto- caramel, maple, peanut butter, pumpkins, white or dark chocolate, whatever. There is SO much fat in this recipe you can use a greased pan but sticking isn’t much of a problem. LEt cool completely, then I break up and freeze so my kids don’t find it or else it’s gone.

Terrible! It's hit or miss.  Twice I've made it, even with foil.  The crackers stick to the foil and pan.  The chocolate layer separates from the crackers, making it obvious it's saltine crackers.  The "caramel layer" is gooey and bends and is unbreakable.  

I had to throw the whole thing away.  A waste of two blocks of butter!

The only reason I have it up here as a favorite is to remind me not to make it again.

There are many recipes floating around for this treat, and this is the best one I have found. For the negative reviewers who say they didn't like it, I'm guessing either you didn't make it right or you didn't wait until it was completely cool before tasting. A few tips to address the former: Your oven must be completely preheated to a full 400 degrees. Line the pan with parchment. You must bring the mixture to a full boil, and boil for three full minutes WITHOUT STIRRING. Yes, it's THAT IMPORTANT! Otherwise you will get a grainy or gooey consistency. If your chips didn't melt, you went way wrong somewhere. I have found that laying a piece of foil over the pan melts them quicker, but unless you live in an igloo the chips will melt if you follow the directions. The only changes I make to adjust this recipe to my liking are minor: I use light brown sugar instead of dark (less rich); increase the brown sugar by 1/4 cup (less greasiness); stir in 1/2 teaspoon vanilla after removing from heat; and I use 1+1/2 cups choc chips as I like the chocolate layer slightly thinner. You can substitute matzoh or graham crackers for the saltines. (I find graham crackers too sweet.) As for the tasting, unless you're a chocolate freak, resist the urge to taste before this is completely cool - all you will taste is overly sweet, overly rich chocolate. If you give it the proper time, the toffee sets up and when you bite into a piece you get the perfect complement of sweet, salty, crispy, buttery an

Ugh. This was a disaster. A friend made them and I ate a ton of them so I was going to make them this year for gifts for friends and family. I don't really know how I could have messed this up so bad but I apparently did. The chocolate just didn't melt. I used nestle till house so it's not like it was weird chocolate. I even put the pan back in the oven and it just wouldn't melt. Disaster and quite a waste of ingredients.

Hands down my most requested Christmas cookie recipe.  You can use Ritz crackers and milk or white chocolate and different nuts to mix it up.  Do make sure to boil 3 minutes after it reaches boiling...and use Reynolds Non-stick foil to line the jelly roll sheet.

EASY Everyone loves them. Follow instructions, boil hard without stirring, use full sleeve of saltines, and line the bar pan. Can't go wrong. They disappear fast but it is a sugar high. UPDATE: line your pan with HEAVY-DUTY tin foil. It is much easier to get off. I lifted the foil out after it had cooled and then creased with a large knife and broke apart.

These cookies are absolutely delicious!  I made this exactly as is, and they turned out great!  I just made sure to keep stirring the sugar mixture because I was nervous about it burning.  I wasn't sure what the cookies would be like with the saltines, but give them a try.  They are super easy and unique for parties as well.  The salt, crunch, toffee, and chocolate is very yummy and addicting!

What a great tasting recipe that's so easy to make. I did read the reviews and lined my jelly roll pan with foil and used cooking spray. One sleeve of saltines worked fine, any more and your toffee will be too thin. Toasted the pecans, used a 400 degree oven for 6 mins and when I boiled the dark brown sugar and butter I used a Thermapen® to check the temp at soft crack stage 270 - 290 degrees in order to take the guess work out of the boiling time. I will probably use milk chocolate chips next time.

Followed the recipe to a T. Crackers and caramel and chocolate is completely stuck to my cookie pan. I put it in the deep freezer for 15 minutes desperate to freeze this batch and then break it off frozen. NO GO. This is totally stuck to my favorite pan. It tastes great! But line your pan somehow, seriously!!! Or you'll end up like me, disappointed and now with a ruined pan. :(

I've been making these for over 20 years now - I was given the recipe by a co-worker and they are now a tradition in our family! SO easy, SO good! I like them with almonds on top but any nut can be good. Line your pan with foil or parchment (they WILL stick to a non lined pan) Make sure your oven is preheated and cook for EXACTLY 3 minutes (I've had the sugar/butter combo 'break' when I've gotten too busy multi-tasking and let it go too long)  Glad to see this one posted! Thanks - now i can get rid of the 20 year old butter stained index card I have had this written on and won't have to worry about losing it!  Merry Christmas everyone!

These are easy and everyone loves them. If it comes out grainy, the sugar didn't cook long enough or too long. I use the 'ball' test, where you have a glass if ice water next to the pan and drop small amounts of the caramel into the glass while cooking. When the caramel forms a ball immediately it's done.

I wish I had read the reviews prior to making these. I stirred the butter/sugar mixture and apparently I shouldn't have. Would be great if the directions stated DO NOT STIR. Otherwise I know these will turn out great. What happened to mine: the butter remained separate from the sugar, they never combined. So after the 3 minutes, and I poured the mixture over the crackers, first came the butter then the sugar in a gloppy mess. The butter was all pooled up around the crackers. I still went ahead and finished the recipe, and it tastes just ok. The crackers are so greasy from the butter. But I will make it again, and next time resist the urge to stir!

I made two batches of this recipe, one using salted butter and another using unsalted. I preferred the salted butter one a lot more, it gave it more flavor. When you're making this, be sure not to get the toffee burn in the oven (burnt toffee is nasty). I think it would help if you spread the toffee out as much as you can before putting it in the oven, so the sides won't burn! :)

I haven't had this treat in about 4 yrs.  I decided to cut the butter to 1/2 cup (1 stick) and substitute 4 T. of light corn syrup. I was able to still completely cover all the crackers. I baked mine at 350 for 5 minutes - just until they were bubbly on top. They were as fabulous as I remembered them!!  I set my pan outside (since it was 27 degrees) for them to harden.  I was a bit concerned the bottom might not harden properly but they came out great!  If you are wanting to cut some of the fat and not compromise flavor use the corn syrup. (I gave it 4 stars because of my changes)

GLUTEN-FREE VERSION... I followed this recipe exactly...  had to come up with a gluten-free treat I could make within 15 minutes of leaving the house!  ...took time to read only one review.  I had a box of gluten-free crispbread mfg by Schar (a crispy saltine-type of cracker.) Walked away from the pan to quickly get ready while butter/dark brown sugar was boiling for 3 minutes - never thinking to stir! Returned to the stove - hoped I hadn't ruined it... but after reading reviews later, found that was the correct way!  I did use foil - just to keep things neater, so that worked out great!  Baked at 400 for 5 minutes. Used Ghiradelli semi-sweet chocolate chips - put back in oven for a minute, as recommended, then spread with spatula. Used walnuts chopped finely in food processor, then toasted in toaster oven to bring out nutty flavor.  Hurried and put hot baked "toffee cookies" still in jelly-roll pan (which I use as a cookie sheet) in a box and back of truck to cool in winter weather while we drove to granddaughter Lily's dance recital. When the recital was over, we all met at the back of our truck, broke up the "toffee cookies" and dug in.  No one could believe they were made with crackers - or that they were gluten free!  Absolutely delicious!  Thanks for all the hints!

I do this recipe every year! My family loves it! Use a cookie sheet and cover it with parchment paper then put down the saltines. I never have a problem with sticking or messes.

We have been making this recipe in our family for years (We've called them Heath Bar Cookies). I've never boiled it for three minutes, I just bring it to a full rolling boil, then remove. We also use an entire 12oz bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips.  I have been adding one tablespoon of oil when melting chips in the microwave, using 30 second intervals.  My mother has recently started skipping the oil and just sprinkling the chips onto the cookie and throwing it back into the oven for a minute or so to soften the chips so she can easily spread.  

We've never used nuts before and we ALWAYS cooled and stored these cookies in the freezer.  Love, love, love these cookies!

I first found this in a the Savannah cookbook. It was  called Tut's Toffee.  I line the cookie sheet with foil  to make the removal easier.  It was the hit of the holiday season. I do volunteer work so when I ask businesses for help, i take along a bag of this toffee.  Works all the time.

Simple recipe, perfect for a chocolate lover. I wasn't too thrilled with the chocolate on the toffee/crackers. I preferred the cracker mixture without the overpowering taste of the chocolate.

Love this recipe! Very easy to make, very inexpensive too. It's great if you want to add something extra to the cookie tray for Christmas without spending a lot of money. I used dark brown sugar, but I think light brown sugar is okay too, it depends on how much you like molasses. Everyone loved this and I plan to make it every year!

We thought this was pretty good but I think I would make more of the toffee next time.  I needed a little more than a ream of crackers to cover the bottom of the pan and the toffee didn't cover to the edges.  Someone said it would spread the the edges and I think it did a little but but not enough.  I liked the taste but not that I could totally tell that it was toffee on top of saltines!  Next time, I would crush the crackers or not use them at all.  I think I would also prefer milk chocolate to semi-sweet.  With a few changes, I think it could really be something I'd make again.

SO good!  I've found that the chocolate chips tend to melt a tiny bit (and leave fingerprints!) while breaking unless you freeze the batch for a few minutes, so I used CandiQuik chocolate candy coating on top instead of chocolate chips and things went much better.  Always use milk chocolate!  It makes such a difference.  I also found it imperative to line the jelly roll pan with aluminum foil (non-stick worked really well) before laying down the saltines so the toffee doesn't stick to the pan.  Lastly, I used unsalted saltines and instead of topping with nuts, I topped with sea salt.  These are delish.

As delicious and easy as others have said. HINT: instead of using lots of little saltines, I use large sheets of SALTED matzo cracker - easier to pour the caramel and spread chocolate chips over w/ less waste and mess!

Yummy! I made these for a cookie exchange because I needed something easy. These couldn't be easier. I followed other reviewers recommendations on using milk chocolate chips. It's key to let the butter & brown sugar to boil for at least three minutes (start timing after it's all fully boiling) and don't stir it! I also thought maybe there was a typo in the recipe and that the choc. chips needed to go back in the oven for a few minutes to fully melt, but they did indeed melt just fine after sitting on the hot toffee for 5-6 minutes and spread nicely. I used the non-stick foil...highly recommend! I also put the pan in the fridge to cool and that worked well before I cut them.

I've made this a few times exactly as posted, sometimes it comes out perfect, others the "toffee" part never hardens and I end up throwing them in the trash. When they do work I get tons of compliments and requests for the recipe though.

Very simple to make, but be sure to mix the sugar mixture while cooking, even though notes say otherwise. I burned mine. Still, everyone ate it.  :)

I like to make these with club crackers instead of saltine crackers and I add alittle vanilla in the butter/sugar before I pour on the crackers.

Really, really delicious and addicting recipe!  I can't cook worth a darn and this came out perfect.  I did follow what others have noted and did NOT stir the butter/sugar mixture during the "boiling" period.  I was worried that they would come out chewy but they came out perfectly.  I could eat a whole pan of these in a day.

These were liked by everyone! I did things a little different. I used two 'Terry's Chocolate Orange' and sliced & chopped almonds instead of the semi-sweet chips and pecans. I also decided to make the cookie thicker by using two sleeves of saltines (or soda crackers, as they're commonly called here. the salted tops only kind.). I chose to melt the chocolate on the stove-top with a little half & half to make it more smooth and evenly cover the crackers. I layered as such: crackers, toffee mixture, crackers, melted chocolate and chopped almonds. I baked it all together like that for about the same times as the original recipe states. I will be making these often!

These are awesome, but make sure you have everything lined up and ready to go - I was cooking the sugar/butter mixture and then had to scream for the fiance to help lay out the crackers.  My bad :) Used crushed candy canes instead of pecans for Christmas and it was awesome.  Bagged a few chunks with some Cinnamon Roasted Almonds and Frosted Pecans (from this site) and gave them to people I liked and people I want to like me :) Huge hit!

This recipe is very good! Be careful, however, that you do not boil your sugar and butter mixture for too long. I did this the first time and ended up with a big, smoky mess! The next time, i kept it on medium heat, and boiled it for only about 2 minutes, and it turned out great! Also, i lined my cookie sheet with parchment paper before putting the crackers on, it was great because it made for an easy clean up, and i didn't ruin my pan when i cut the cookies (using a cookie cutter). I would also tell you to make sure that you allow these cookies to cool for a very long time before you cut/break them into pieces, because the chocolate takes a long time to cool. I used bittersweet chocolate (60% cocoa), but left out the nuts, and it was delicious! Thanks Tracy for this wonderful, easy recipe!

One of the best recipes EVER, BUT....you MUST MAKE SURE your cookie sheet has 4 sides. Mine had 3, so I bent up the foil on the 4th side. Only 4 minutes in the oven, the bent up foil fell flat and all the toffee was flowing off the cookie sheet onto the bottom of my oven. FIRE! Got a really nice visit from the fire department. Everything is ok, but my house smells from the smoke that filled it. Live 'n learn!!

Very rich! Don't stir the butter/sugar mixture after it begins to boil. I have tried a few different varieties of chocolate, and the semi-sweet definitely works and tastes the best. Once it's dry, and has a beautiful shiny surface which the other chocolates won't produce.

Awesome! I did cover the cookie sheet with foil, rubbed with a little butter.  I also used chopped toasted almonds instead of pecans.  Delish! My only complaint (and it doesn't have to do with the recipe) is that they get melty and sticky- and stick together- but I'm in a humid warm environment- so just keep in mind if you are in the same environment keep it in the fridge!  Oh, and this toffee pulled my brother in law's filling out of his tooth!  Despite all this it's definitely a 5 star recipe, and one I can remember too!

I don't think I boiled this long enough, the toffee turned out very chewy but it was still good. The crackers are kind of odd but they work.

Used light brown sugar instead of dark. Used milk chocolate (about a cup more than was required).  Left off nuts due to a nut allergy in my house.  Delish.  Delish. Delish.  I snuck a taste while warm and whoa...amazing!

These are amazing.  I've made them twice this holiday season, and they've been delicious each time.  My husband is picky, and he can't get enough of them.      Based on the reviews, I don't stir the butter and brown sugar after they start boiling.  I do stir to mix while the butter is melting.  The toffee has been crisp and flaky each time.  I do use dark brown sugar.  The first time I made them, I lined my pan with foil and then greased it.  The second time I made them, I just lined with foil.  No extra oil.  They did not stick to the foil at all.  The foil was nice, however, because when it was time to cut the cookies, I just lifted the foil off the pan onto my cutting board, and then cut the cookies with a knife.  Easy, easy, easy!  This is definitely a 5 star recipe!

OK... I have been playing with this recipe...  Like others mentioned, my toffee was a bit soft and granular.  Also, while I loved the taste, the color wasn't right.  I switched from white sugar to dark brown sugar.  I also combine the butter and sugar well and then let it boil for 3-4 minutes without stirring.  I didn't know that the no stirring part is important for toffee, but apparently it is.  Anyway, with these minor changes, my "cookies" came out amazing!

My family absolutely loves these saltine toffee cookies...I have made a few batches already to keep up with the demand! :)  The best part is, it's SOOO easy to make.  The hard part for me is breaking it all up...I like them in bite size pieces, so it's a little more difficult.  But other than that, this is a fantastic recipe!  I topped my first batch with multicolored nonpareil sprinkles, and the next few with pistachios and walnuts.

Love this recipe!  I have made it for several potluck events and it's always a hit. I'm a dude that doesn't cook/bake all that much but these are easy for anyone to make.  You can even customize them by adding in a bit of white chocolate with the semi-sweep, or by using different kinds of nuts or sprinkles instead of the pecans.  The original recipes is great as it is though.   BTW, I've renamed them "Crack Bars" because they are soooo addictive. People can't keep their crackhead hands off them!

Very easy to make. Tastes a lot like almond roca, except better. I toasted the chopped pecans.

These are so good, I have made them with saltine crackers and Breton's -I broke the Bretons in half to fit round crackers along the edge of pan. Either way they are a quick cheat for candy.

I think it was my fault, not the recipe's, but I just couldn't seem to get these to come out right.  The toffee never got really hard and was just chewy...when I took a bite, the stuff wouldn't ever really chew up or go away, just kind of stuck to my teeth forever.  Is this normal?  Anyone want to tell me what I did wrong?  Would love to try them if I could figure out how to do it correctly!  It can't be the recipe's fault when it's had so many great reviews!

This is amazing! I top with half milk chocolate chips and half semi-sweet to get the perfect combination for my chocolate craving. I chop up pecans into small pieces and gently press them into the chocolate. I put my pan into the freezer to speed things up, that way I don't have to wait as long to eat them. I am addicted to these:)

Many of the reviews for this recipe say not to undercook the toffee but please don't overcook it either. I ruined my first batch by doing so. Time the three minutes carefully, beginning just as it starts to bubble around the edges. Once i got these right they were delicious. The chocolate spreads easily and they can be topped with anything. I topped mine with crushed toffee bits. Love the combination of sweet and salty(keep a toothbrush and dental floss nearby though as they stick to the teeth)! Oh, and if you use parchment paper in your pan, they lift out easily. They cut easily using a serrated knife dipped in hot water. Will make again.

We love these 'cookies', although it tastes more like candy.  It is so quick and simple to make.  I use packed, light brown sugar instead of dark.  It is very important that you make sure you start timing the three minutes at a FULL boil, not a simmer!  They will keep for days in an airtight container.

I got these as a gift a year ago and found the recipe here tried it at home my girls love it. I like it with milk chocolate bits.  One word to the wise use real butter some of the spreads don't work with it and the just get sticky and never set up.  Any way this is the easiest cookie recipe and one that goes fast.

Why would you EVER go to the trouble of making real toffee???  This is the best and it is unbelievable how easy it is to make.  I put mine in the fridge to harden up and it tastes just perfect.  I also used parchment paper and it didn't stick one bit.  SO GOOD!  I wish I could give it 10 stars!

These cookies are always a hit at parties and never fail to surprise when people see how easy they are to make.  I recommend using a darker chocolate and crushed peppermint for a nice holiday treat as well!!

I made this recipe with toasted slice almonds and milk chocolate chips and it was delicious!  This recipe was easy to make.  I put them in individually wrapped cellophane bags for Xmas gifts. Much easier than baking cookies!

My mom and I have made this recipe for years!! I have to say its my favorite cookie/candy. 

You can also use milk chocolate and its just as good.  Light brown sugar works too, but dark is better.  

You do not want this to burn so be careful

Also.. the recipe isn't really clear about the chocolate.  After removing the buttery crackers from the oven you can let it sit for a few minutes to cool, but don't let it get room temp. While its still hot just drop the chocolate chips on the crackers and let them melt.  Then spred the chocolate around and add pecans.  

No one will ever guess that there are crackers in there!!  Trust me.  These taste like you worked for hours!! :)  Our little secret

This is excellent! I used one sleeve off brand saltine crackers(Wal-Mart). Used a large cookie sheet, lined with foil and sprayed lightly with Pam organic cooking spray. I stirred the butter and sugar until it came to a complete rapid boil, then left it alone to boil and set the timer for three minutes. Also, baked in the oven for three minutes. After everything was done I let them cool off in the fridge. My hubby can't keep his hands off them! I will be making these for the holidays. Thanks so much!!!

OUTSTANDING!  Who would ever think, in a million years, that these are made with Saltine crackers??  And that they're so easy!  They literally take about 15 minutes from start to finish.  They were a hit..everyone polished them off at the party I brought them to.  My mind is spinning with ideas for different topping combinations...white chocolate and toasted coconut with slivered almonds will be next!

Totally awesome as written!!  The secret is to stir constantly UNTIL the mixture boils, then LEAVE IT ALONE FOR 3 MINUTES, then pour immediately over crackers. I lined the pan w parchment paper--no problems !  I use almond slivers chopped small.  Also have sprinkled red sugar sprinkles over the toffee, after the nuts--especially at holiday time, makes for a nice festive presentation.  Thanks for the recipe !!

I have made this close to 10 times and I'm finally reviewing it.  We have a group of friends/kids that get together and one of us always makes this dessert.  It is fondly known as "CRACK" because it is so addictive, lol.  It is a cross between a cookie and a candy and it is just great!  I like it because you can just take a small piece to satisfy a sweet tooth or keep munching.  I only make it with light brown sugar and I have used both almonds and pecans as the nuts.  Both are great.  Ialso line the  cookie sheet with Reynolds Wrap no stick foil.

Easy and good.  I wanted to make something for my hubby to take to work.  I had the crackers so this was perfect.  I like how easy they came together.  I used some slivered almonds that I toasted and milk chocolate chips.  I am sure I will make them again. Thanks Sue for the recommendation!  And thanks Tracey for the recipe.

YUM!!!!! These were sooo easy and they tasted AMAZING! I had a toffee cookie from a gift basket and I HAD to try to recreate it... I only had graham crackers, white sugar and walnuts, so I substituted those for the saltines, brown sugar and pecans. It worked out fine; I actually think the graham crackers worked better than the saltines would have. Next time I will try making these without the chocolate because the toffee itself is yum on it's own!

DEFINITELY use milk chocolate instead of semisweet and also use toasted pecans. *NOTE: To toast pecans, preheat oven to 300 degrees. Spread pecans evenly on a baking sheet and bake 10 to 15 minutes, stirring often, until pecans are fragrant and lightly browned. EXCELLENT with these changes!

Loved this! And Sooo Easy! We made these in a pinch this year as we ran out of time to really do the whole Christmas cookie thing. I did not use the nuts and I used dark chocolate. It was amazing!! My sister used milk chocolate but I personally think the dark plays down the super sweetness of the toffee better. Great either way!

I really LOVE this recipe but I do have a couple comments.  I have made it several times and most of the time it is so yummy.  However, today I made it and when I put it in the oven for the 5 minutes it burned beyond saving.  I was very disappointed as it was the last of my butter!  The last time I made it, it was a humid day and it came out chewy instead of crunchy.  But it was still good.  Every other time, it came out perfect. I made these for Christmas and after I spread the chocolate I decorated them with chopped up white chocolate pretzels, chopped pistacios and red and green mini M & M's.  They were delicious.  I prefer less chocolate chips than this recipe calls for.  I think too much chocolate takes away from they toffee taste.  GREAT recipe!

Excellent! Lots of compliments and recipe requests.  The only thing I added was a couple of teaspoons of vanilla after the syrup was done cooking on the stove.  I made it both ways and like the extra vanilla.

Just ok according to my family.  Maybe too much chocolate not enough toffee.  I did follow the recipe exactly.

My aunt used to make this every year for the holidays and I was determined to find the recipe so I could start making it myself. This stuff is AMAZING - perfect combination of salty/sweet and smooth/crispy.  Word of caution though - don't try to use light butter in the recipe - it's too watery and causes the toffee to be gooey and the crackers soggy. Just have to splurge and go full fat for this one - but it's worth it! Also, try doing one pan with nuts and the other with sprinkles - makes a fun treat for the kids. :)

I was skeptical when I first read the ingredients in this recipe. However, curiosity got the best of me and I made them anyway.  They are absolutely delicious. The saltiness of the crackers contrasts nicely with the sweetness of the toffee and chocolate.

WOW!!!! Fast, easy and best of all CHEAP.  Ok so I am easy to please.  These are fantastic.  I did as other reviewers stated and lined the pan with foil and they came out perfect.  I also reduced the butter to 3/4C.  These are wondreful.

OH MY GOSH! This is goooooooood! Who would have thought to use saltines?!! I just made a batch, and it is now cooling. I had to taste it first (of course), and now I have only made it harder on myself to wait while it cools!! Make sure to grease your pan really well so the mixture doesn't stick!!

This is most interesting recipe.  So simple and so cheap!  The kids helped assemble and were in agony until the cookies/candy was ready to eat!  The only change for the next batch....use milk chocolate instead of semi-sweet.

I have been making this recipe for years but I always line the pan with foil.  When the cookies cool, just peel the foil off and crack cookies into pieces. I just started using the new release foil.  I usually have to make the recipe several times at the holidays because they are a family favorite.  Store in a moisture proof container, can get soft and sticky in humid weather.

This is fantastic.  Can't believe saltines are used in this recipe-- how fun! :)  My hubby likes this a lot, but he says he'd prefer it to be made with milk chocolate instead of the semi-sweet chocolate I used.

The only reason I am not giving this 5 stars is because I felt the recipe  lacked some information.  The first batch, I cooked it in my convection oven for the full 6 minutes.  It tasted burnt.  Even though it tasted slightly burnt, it was still gone within a day. I decided I had to try it again.  The second batch, I didn't cook the sauce hot enough on the stove and it crystalized, had to throw it away.  Third time, I got it right!  A candy thermometer is great to have, cook it to hard crack stage, it took longer than 3 minutes.  I only cooked it for 3 to 4 minutes in my convection oven and it turned out great.  Use parchment paper if you have it, it's no fuss, no mess!  I used walnuts and it tasted wonderful.  Also used toasted slivered almonds on the first batch, that was good too.  Put it in the refridgerator for an hour or so and it's ready to eat.  Otherwise, 5 stars!  Will be a holiday staple, thanks for the recipe!

Tried this today for the first time and definately make this again and again!  I lined my cookie sheet with buttered foil as another had suggested and it sure made cleanup a snap!  Tastes so good that you won't believe it is that easy and quick to prepare.   I topped with finely ground pecans and it turned out beautifully!  Thanks for posting one of my new favorites.

MMMMMMMMM. This is sooooooooo good! I even goofed and put the chocolate on BEFORE I put it in the oven. Still turned out wonderful. I used club crackers instead of saltines as that is how I have had the cracker toffee in the past.  Thanks for sharing!

These are phenomenal! Will definitely be a holiday staple.  So simple to put together.  I couldn’t keep my husband away from them.  Also easy to edit to your taste…my father-in-law is allergic to chocolate, omitted the chocolate in one batch and they still came out tasting great.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This was so simple and sinfully delicious. After sprinkling the pecans on, I put the tray in freezer to harden chocolate quicker.  It tastes totally gormet, and couldn't have been easier with ingredients that were already available in my pantry. These will be made again and put in tins to give away for others to enjoy.

These are sinfully delicious, easy and cheap.......does it get any better than that?  I used what I had on hand........low sodium saltines, light brown sugar instead of dark, and miniature chocolate chips.  Took other's advice and lined cookie sheet with foil and sprayed it with non-stick spray.  Perfect.........virtually no cleanup!  And so quick to make! Husband came in from shoveling snow to a delicious treat he wasn't expecting!  Thanks for the post - I think I will make a bunch of these over the holidays!

A surprisingly tastey treat for such a simple recipe. I used parchment paper and had no problem with sticking.  I'm taking them to a cookie exchange party and I am sure that I will be asked for the recipe.

This was so incredibly easy and took no time at all to make.  I made a tin of them and my husband took them to work.  They were gone in 5 minutes.  Will definitely make some more before Christmas!!!  I used foil and non-stick spray and had no problems.

Terrific easy recipe.  I changed the pecans to Hazlenuts & used light brown sugar instead of dark. Came out great.  One should use tin foil & spray the foil, boil for entire 3 minutes without stirring & bake for 6 minutes.  If you do this it will come out crunchy.  My only question is how should I store these?  So good, I will be serving these little treats to my family & friends on Christmas Eve.

This is a great recipe, I did it a little different per some other suggestions: used LIGHT brown sugar & 1/2 the butter and sugar amount called for.  I found that if you put the cookies in long rows and make sure there is at least 1/2 inch apace between the other rows, they are easier to break (lengthwise) and then you could break them smaller after that.  Also, after you bring the sugar to a boil, do not stir it until done.  I also suggest spreading the toffee mix as you go over the crackers because as soon as it cools, it is very difficult to spread.  YUMMY!!!

I tasted these at a party recently and they were delicious. The person who took them to the party would not give me the recipe but did however tell me that they were made with saltine crackers. HA HA to her!!! I just knew that I would find the recipe on here. I made them as soon as I came home. EXCELLENT!!!!!

I hate to be negative especially since there are so many great reviews on this recipe, but the candy/cookie just is not all that great,IMO.  Perhaps I did not do something right with the recipe.  I'm not sure as I usually agree with the reviews of recipes with a 4 or 5 star rating.  Big disappointment--I frankly would be embarassed to give this as a gift.  Sorry!  I'm givng it a 2 star because it is easy but that is about the only good thing about this recipe.

This was an easy recipe and is very tasty, if you don't mind chiseling it off the cookie sheet! I had misgivings about putting the saltines on the cookie sheet without a layer of parchment paper, but figured with all the great review and lack of instruction to do so, I would follow the directions.  I am now staring at a mess of crumbs as I attempt to pry the gooey mess off my cookie sheet.  The chocolate also seperates from the bottom saltine cracker layer while trying to 'break into pieces'.  Not sure about this one - I'll give it another go, but I'm definately going to layer my cookie sheet with parchment on the next go round!  I am disappointed and miffed at the loss of ingredients to my garbage can.

Oh wow. I had a craving for sweets, and this hit the bill! Yum. I only used 3/4 c. of butter since others were saying it was too greasy, and I didn't miss it one bit. I also omitted the pecans. It reminded me of peanut brittle, only tastier and easier on the teeth! I can't wait to take this to the next get-together.

Ooooh, yummy!  This just became my favorite dessert of all time.  Gave some to my Dad to try (he doesn't like sweets) and he loved it.  Next time I'll use foil on the bottom as others have suggested.  What a wonderful recipe!  I have also used Nestle's Swirled chocolate and caramel morsels combined with semi-sweet.

This was awesome!! It was soooo easy and fast! I tasted this last year when my mom made it and another time a friend made it. I thought it was great then and definitley great now! I used walnuts unstead of pecans too. Could definitely use any nut with this.

Un-frickin-believable!!  Made these this past weekend and can't stop eating them. I bought a batch to work and I had at least 15 people ask me for the recipe. 

The pan we used for the saltines was kinda large so the toffee ended up underneath and wrapped around each cracker and the crackers kinda separated after the baking. Spreading chocolate on top fused the disparate crackers together nicely though. 

Thanks for sharing this!

It was such an easy and yummy recipe! The only setback was by the time the crackers cooled down, they were stuck to the cookie sheet and most of the crakcers cracked while I was scraping them off. Next time I will use a silpat.

This was an EXCELLENT holiday treat!  They flew out of the house and off the trays at work faster than anything.  It takes just like a heath bar with a crunchy center.  One thing though - I would definitely reduce the baking time by a minute or two.  Mine starting to singe around the edges.

My wife went crazy over these! They're easy to make and a VERY sweet treat. I thought it was wierd using saltines as a base, but this is the farthest from a cracker you can get. It is a bit messy. I, too, suggest putting it in the fridge for a while to get hard before you break it up. Their chewey, but addictive.

This is a very, very sweet and rich treat. It is extremely quick and easy to make. Lining the pan with foil and spraying it well with Pam prevented any sticking or messy clean-up. Initially, I thought it looked too messy and gooey. I threw it into the fridge (on the pan) and chilled it for an hour before breaking it apart, this worked very well. I plan to store it in the fridge to prevent it from getting too soft. It's a little sweet, even for our kids, but fun to make.

A great simple recipe.  I used peanuts as I just wanted it for a cheap treat for the family while I was busy making chrismas goodies.  Next time I would chop the peanuts and put them on the sauce before putting it in the oven, then putting the chocolate chips on as usual.  Nuts kept falling off the other way.  Don't let the saltines put you off, you'd never know.

My mom always made these growing up except we stick them right in the refrigerator to cool down, than break them apart and stick back in the fridge to keep. Much better that way! I used light brown sugar. Will try with dark brown next time.

I've made this several times with recipes that use the light brown sugar.  I decided to give this one a try and must say that I like the toffee flavor better with this dark brown sugar.  I opted to try it using Ritz crackers this time for the butteriness of them, and must say that I prefer them with the Ritz.  Used slivered almonds on top with some heath bar chips.  This is hard to stay out of.  This will be my go-to due to the use of dark brown sugar.  Thanks so much

I have been making this Recipe? for three years now. The first year it turned out out of this world. Omg it was sooo good. The next year I decided to make as a teachers gift and couple batches for us. However it wasn’t working for me. I have no idea why it didn’t turn out the same as the first year. The toffee was sandy and not hard at all. I decided to make it this year again because I really do like it but got the same results as last year. I need help to figure out what am I doing wrong. The video shows stirring through out the sugar butter combining but I read the reviews and stopped stirring as soon as it started to boil. Boiled it for 3 minutes and baked at 400 F for five. What am I doing wrong?

This is my go to holiday gifting special. My friends start asking about it as soon as December rolls in.
Made a few tweaks along the years. I use the small cookie sheet (9*13) for the best settling in my oven and even layers.  I only use DARK brown sugar. Fleur de sel (sparingly) or crushed pistachios & cranberries on top.

be very precise of the sugar to butter; or mixture will separate, esp with  too much butter so did heaping cups of sugar (half white and brown).
stir but when it boils, let it go up to 300'- use candy thermometer (could take good 10 min). used 2 bags of choco chips (like it choco-y) and pressed down the the nuts.
if nut allergy, top w/crushed candy cane or sprinkles instead. in winter, put outside in cold to set quickly.

The first time I made this recipe, my toffee burned from the high oven heat, and were almost a total loss. I managed to save a few and the taste was enough that I gave it another try. Keeping my oven no higher than 350 degrees and carefully watching them cook, they came out perfectly and are sinfully addictive! I will actually use less chocolate next time, because the toffee part is almost drowned out by the chocolate, and I really like the buttery toffee flavor, yum. Great recipe, thank you!

I used Nestle Milk Chocolate chips and they wouldn't melt--even after putting the pan back in the oven multiple times. (I have a different toffee recipe that's lots more work--but is excellent. It uses 6 Hershey chocolate bars which melt on C0NTACT with the hot toffee base, and are smooth, not grainy. Perhaps using chocolate bars -which melt easier -would have saved this recipe.) I ended up throwing the whole batch into the trash. What a waste.

The chocolate chips did not melt on their own. I would recommend melting chocolate and then pour and spread .

Very very good. 
Changes I made...
 Half dark and half light brown sugar. (It's what I had on hand)          
Milk chocolate and white chocolate morsels sprinkled across the top instead of covering it. I didn't want it to look like a layer, but more like a topping. 
I used chopped pecans.
As it cooled I tasted it and thought it needed a kick, so I sprinkled coarse Kosher salt on top. Oh my stars!!!  It was fantastic then!  Do a taste test on one cracker. Too much salt will kill the flavour and, well, there's no point in not enough.  
Seriously, try the Kosher salt!!!

A friend made these at at tailgate and once I ate them, I was hooked.  Simple and wonderful.  I cook my pecans for 10 minutes at 200 degrees before I sprinkle them on the cookies.  Also, I made them ahead for Christmas and stored them in tupperware.  They were as crisp as freshly baked, a month later.

while this recipe came out awesome, reading the bad reviews was even more fun. if you change more than one ingredient or don't do a step and it turns out bad, its not the posted recipe, its your lack of ability to follow directions. these were very easy to make and turned out great.

I have made these the past two Christmases and they are so good.  My mom used to make toffee when I was a kid but it always seemed like such a lot of work.  These taste just as good without all the extra work and hassle.

I often use skor toffee bits instead of nuts as I have many friends who are allergic to nuts.  My friends love it so much it has the nickname of crack because it is so addictive!  :)

I've been making these for years and have learned a few things. #1. Use heavy duty aluminum foil. The thin foil is difficult to peel off.  #2. The crackers float while in the oven.  Have a pointy knife or fork ready to slide these back into place before adding the chocolate chips.  #3. If you want to cut these into squares or bars, you need to cut them within 10 minutes of taking them from the oven.  I have a Chinese cleaver I use, but a chef's knife will also work.  #4. I use a bag of milk chocolate chips.  I prefer the milder taste of milk chocolate to go with the slightly burnt taste of the sugar.

This recipes is super easy to make! I went along with previous suggestions and used milk chocolate chips and waited 20 minutes for them to cool a bit. I also put the saltine crackers on a pan that has edges and covered it with parchment paper. I suggest using a pizza cutter and gently rolling in between the cookies while the toffee was cool but still a bit chewy so you can move the pizza cutter and make straight lines. Along the edges where the cutter couldn't reach, I then took a butter knife and gently jabbed through. They haven't cooled completely yet but I already tried one and they are so good! I can tell these will be quite addicting and probably won't last long in my house!

LOVE this and so does my family.  My husband even asked me to make it for the neighbors.  You do need to make sure you do what the recipe says and boil for 3 minutes - and that's a full rolling boil for those 3 minutes.  Otherwise you'll get chewy toffee.  Also - it's imperative you line your dish with foil and then spray that with non-stick cooking spray or you'll have a hard time getting them out.  Lastly, I like the Keebler buttery club crackers for this rather than saltines.

Fantastic and such an easy holiday gift to prepare.  Around the holidays it is nice to give a home-made gift and this one couldn't be easier. I did take the suggestion of another reviewer and used n 11x17 jelly roll pan and increased the number of saltines to cover the pan (the rest of the ingredients remained the same).  I also used parchment paper (didn't have to spray it).  I used a metal spatula to spread the chocolate. I tried using a plastic flexible one and it wasn't spreading easily--the metal one made it much easier.

Short of hacking off slices from a packaged cookie log, this is one of the easiest sweets I've made.  The crackers were making me question this all the way through, but it shouldn't have.  I used foil to keep cleanup to a minimum, and with all the butter, nothing stuck.  Make sure to start the timer for butter/sugar after it's actually boiling.  Pour over crackers immediately.  You don't have to be too perfect spreading over crackers, because it will spread out in the oven.  Sprinkle chocolate chips right after you take out of oven.  Wait the 5 minutes.  It will look like they aren't melting, but will spread right out if you wait.  Sprinkle the nuts.  After cooling about 20 minutes, I did put it in the freezer for about 10 more minutes to help harden the chocolate.  Not too long in the freezer, or the chocolate might separate from the toffee.  Cut or break, and enjoy.  Trust me, you WILL enjoy!

Delicious!  But make sure you stick with the semi-sweet chocolate chips as the milk chocolate chips don't melt as quickly and aren't NEARLY as spreadable as the semi-sweet.

This is good, but it took more than 4 hours to cool. I had to stick it in the fridge overnight to cool completely. So make ahead. I didn't. It's a very sticky mix, so be mindful. Good luck!

Easy to make...a crowd pleaser. Excellent for holiday basket treats.  However, cool thoroughly.  I put in fridge for a full 24 hours.  Also, eat right out of fridge.  At room temperature, the chocolate softens and can be an issue for those with filings or dentures.

Fabulous and so easy to make. I made mine in a square pan that was a little bigger than an 8x8, it was a pan that fits in my toaster oven. This amount of butter and brown sugar will not cover a 13x9 pan so you need to use a smaller pan. It tastes like the best toffee and you can't even tell it's made with the saltine crackers. Be sure to boil the butter,brown sugar mixture for the stated 3 minutes or it will be grainy. I put foil down on the pan first and then after it had cooled completely in the fridge, I just peeled the foil off the bottom and broke the toffee into pieces. Great for Christmas gift giving. Thank you Tracy, so good.

This was easy to make and not as messy as I thought it would be. I used light brown sugar instead of dark and dusted lightly with a few coconut flakes. The recipe was still a hit!!

Very quick and easy. Make sure you give the boiling part the max. time allowed. I was surprised my crackers floated. All in all a good time to cool and everyone was enjoying.

Super Easy to make!!!! I made this in about 10 minutes. I used Heath's Toffee bits because I didn't have any nuts around. When it was set, it tasted amazing. The toffee bits bring out the toffee favor of the butter/sugar mixture. I had to keep my friends, sister, & nephews away from the cookie sheet as they were cooling off.  This is a must try and bake for novice baker like me. Now it's going to become a family quick cookie recipe when something sweet is called for.  Thanks!!!

These were soooo yummy.  After reading other reviews, I decided to make half with saltines and half with graham crackers.  Both were good but the graham cracker version had a bit of an edge, so I'll make it that way from now on.  A very pleasant surprise to an odd sounding recipe.

I tried this for Christmas and used butterscotch chips and chopped walnuts for the topping. Everyone went nuts over it. I also tried it the other day and used cinnamon chips. My next experiment will be peanut butter chips. Thanks so much for a great recipe......nunnysue....

Parchment paper or wax paper works great so the sticky toffee bits don't get stuck! Love this recipe. Easy and versatile  you can change it up with layers and add different toppings.

On Sunday’s Buzz, this recipe was mentioned as one of the surprise recipes they tried this year.   I have to agree.  They were way too easy and way too yummy.   My family loved them.

If I could give it 10 stars I would.  This is fantastic and so easy, which is my kind of recipe.  I sprinkled coconut before putting in the oven,  that's the only change I made.  This will be my go to recipe foe EVERY holiday, potluck, or any reason I can think of.  Thanks Tracy!

I love how easy and affordable these tasty treats are! Gave them as a Christmas present so I used holiday color semi-sweet chips which have red and green mixed in with the chocolate. Made them even more attractive and festive. I come from a family of foodies and all of them (including me!) never thought of saltines for a dessert. Thank you for the recipe!

This is the exact recipe I have used for years with rave reviews. I use light brown sugar rather than dark but I have tried the dark and I really couldn't tell the difference. Just a tip to the novice bakers be careful and not overcook these because the sugar will burn quickly so watch over them to ensure a perfect batch. These are great for gift giving and ship well.

Great, fast recipe.  However, I didn't have enough semisweet chips, so I used Ghirardelli milk chocolate chips for half the amount.  These chips are much larger than regular chocolate chips, and they don't melt or even soften after 15 extra minutes in the oven.

These are amazing!!!  Right when the toffee starts to boil on the stove (this means bubbles are starting to form around the edge) boil it exactly 3 minutes and do not stir (I started the timer for 3 minutes when it came to a rolling boil and it burned).  I then baked it for exactly 5 minutes.  I also found Almonds to be the best because of it's texture (they were more crunchy...the pecans got a little lost).  I also used dark brown sugar, not light.  I won a bake off contest with these and I had people asking me left and right for the recipe.  You must make this!

Excellent toffee recipe!  Easy to make and especially if you are doing LOTS of them.  We featured this on our Christmas buffet table and could not keep up with the guest's demand!  Fortunately it is easy to make and very good.  Be sure to 'cook' that step just before sprinkling the chocolate chips!  Very important.

We make these every year and call them "Christmas Crack" :) We make 3 batches, using Ghirardelli chips for each: dark, milk, and white chocolate. You absolutely HAVE to use dark brown sugar for a deep, rich, toffee flavor. We don't do the baking in the oven for 5 mins before adding the chocolate chips - I think that probably makes them a bit crunchy - we like them a bit chewy.

Love this recipe! So easy to make. When we have last minute plans to go to a friends house, I make this and everyone raves about it. Thought for Christmas I'd crunch up some candy canes and substitute those for the nuts.

Delicious! I have made something similar to this in the past, but never with DARK brown sugar...it really gave this a nice depth of flavor. This will look beautiful packaged in Christmas tins to give for small gifts. I will be making many more batches~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I learned the hard way. Do not use butter that has been frozen. You will end up with a gritty mess.  Also I heeded one reviewers advise to not stir it ever even when you first put in pan. Resist the temptation and it will t work out beautifully. It's so easy and so good!

I followed the recipe exactly and they came out perfectly.  However, I used aluminum foil on the pan the second time and it was much easier to remove them from the pan.

These are very good.  The only change that I will make next time is that I will use milk chocolate chips.  I will also use only 1 1/2 cups of chips, 2 cups covers up the toffee taste.

To keep things simple: way too greasy, way too sweet. Though easy to make, not worth my time. I was looking for some new Christmas cookies to make in the future, but this one was far from making the cut.

These are flippin' FANTASTIC and sooo easy to make!!  I added them to my Christmas cookie distribution this year and got rave reviews from everyone!!  I made mine in a bigger pan (based on others reviews) and found that it left a sloppy mess with not enought "goo" to cover the crackers.  Next time, I'll stick with 9x13 pan. Otherwise - this recipe was awesome!!

Sometimes I have had something weird happen with this recipe- we still eat it! However, I am curious why the butter and the sugar sometimes get separated and grainy.
I melted the butter from frozen- wondering if this might be why....

I've made this before, but couldn't find the recipe I usually use. I found this one and it looked about the same. To my dismay, it wasn't. The cook times (both in the pan and in the oven) are too long, which burns the sugar. As a result, the toffee is very, VERY bitter. Also, 2 cups of chocolate chips is not enough. It creates a super thin layer of chocolate once you spread it out, and a thicker layer is better. With these modifications in mind, it would probably work out to be just fine, but as is it isn't a great recipe.

SOOOO good! I would recommend lining the cookie sheet with foil and then spraying with cooking spray to help lift off the toffee easier.  Also, put the toffee in the fridge for a couple hours to help set it.

These cookies were given to me as a Christmas present by one of my fifth grade students last year.  I loved them and asked for the recipe.  I was given the same recipe that appears here.  They are yummy and a hit with everyone. Quick and easy to prepare.

I have a toffee recipe about the same as this without the saltines.  I could not taste the saltines in this, it crunches the same...  With or without saltines, it's a delicious toffee recipe.

I thought I would give white sugar a try (instead of brown) but found it just wasn't caramel-y enough & too sugary, toffee-y...  So I turfed it & started again with brown - much, much better!  I roasted some almonds and used them on top.  A great recipe.
You only need a little piece to get your sweet fix!

This is a really good, and easy recipe, however I had some problems with the chocolate setting up properly, the cookies stuck together, and it was kind of a mess, so the next time I made them, I used semi-sweet BAKERS chocolate, not only did it taste better, but it set up beautifully...

This was the easiest recipe ever! I didn't have 2 cups of chocolate chips so I used one cup chocolate chips and one cup butterscotch chip....amazing! I was worried that the sugar and butter mixture didn't fully cover the crackers, but once baked it carmelized well over the crackers. Will be making this recipe again soon!

A wonderful recipe.  Easy to make.  Just be sure that the toffee mixture boils for the full amount of time, and then bake it in the oven for the full amount of time.  In fact, I boil and bake it for an extra minute each, so that the finished cookies are very crispy.

I made these for my husband to take to work for a holiday treat and everyone loved them.  I did line my pan with foil, used milk chocolate chips instead of semisweet and golden brown sugar instead of the dark brown as this is what I had on hand.  I'll definitely make these again.

Definitely do use a baking tray with edges, and line it with foil or parchment for easy removal of the cookies. One whole plastic packet of saltines in a box is 4 oz, and I use a whole one plus a few extra to fill the entire tray. Generally I half all the ingredients except for the saltines, so the cookies are a little less rich. This is a plus for me, but the recipe probably tastes just as delicious made as stated. I prefer walnuts to pecans. This recipe is incredibly easy to make -- I have boiled the sugar/butter mixture in the microwave in 30 second bursts and it works just as well.

I followed the directions exactly - and it's fabulous! The saltines truly compliment the sweet of the toffee and chocolate. I was only going to make it for Christmas gifts, but it's so good, we needed another pan just for us. Guess that diet will have to wait....

I just sampled my first batch of these and wow are these yummy.  I am bringing them to a cookie exchange party today and hope that everyone enjoys them.  I followed the recipe and used a timer to ensure everything was done as stated - and I think they turned out delicious.  The only thing that I tried, based on others feedback is that I crushed all crackers and it seemed to work great.  I think I may bring them to my next family get together too.

Taking these to a cookie exchange, so I had to make 10 dozen.  Totally easy, and if I had owned more cookie sheets, I would have been done in less than an hour.  As it is, I have to do 2 rounds.  Still, even my picky husband and 3 year old love these!  I did substitue milk chocolate chips for the semi-sweet, since there were so many kids with these.  I also left off the nuts.  Perfect and easy!

Really easy. Used another reviewer's suggestion to line 11x17" rimmed sheet with foil, sprayed with nonstick spray.  That worked out great, no sticking.  Tasted better with milk chocolate chips than semi-sweet, even tho I am a dark chocolate fan.  Also tried with extra choc chips (additional half bag) but it was better with the 2 cups listed in the recipe.

I just made this for the first time today.  I think this is a really easy recipe. The tips regarding lining the cookie sheet with foil and not stirring after the toffee stars to boil are key.   I actually think I like it better without the chocolate added and that is the reason for the lack of the 5th star.

I made these exactly per the recipe.  The next time I make them, I will use less chocolate.  I'm a purist and even though I love chocolate, I felt there was too much chocolate and it took away from tasting the toffee.

So easy and so incredibly good! I didn't use foil, just put the (already cooled) pan in the freezer for awhile and the toffee popped right out of the pan. Please do yourself a favor and try this, you'll be impressed!

Amazingly delicious and super easy! I put a sheet of foil in a baking sheet and the toffee can out very easily and clean up was a cinch.

I made these over the weekend and read the reviews afterwards.  Apparently I did everything wrong according to the reviews but they still turned out great!!  I subbed maragarine for the butter, used LIGHT brown sugar and walnuts instread of pecans. And I stirred the butter and sugar while it was boiling!  LOL. Maybe I got lucky, but the end result was fantastic and they were gobbled up quickly.  Mine were a tad sticky but I tossed them in ground almonds and that took care of it. I will try them again with real butter and dark brown sugar and see if there is a difference.

These taste even more yummy if you use graham crackers instead of saltine crackers.  We call it Tiger Bark!

delicious and simple - however I made the mistake of popping the cookies back in the oven to melt the chocolate and the chocolate started to separate and get a little weird looking - it didn't melt smoothly - i think it might be called seizing (?) - anyway, tasted good but didn't look so hot. Won't do that again. Update - Some reviews say not to stir the mixture while it boils - I'm always afraid it will burn or boil over - we don't mind the chewy caramel texture, in fact I think we prefer it that way...

Almond Rocha is what these remind me of!  The crackers throw you off when you hear about it, it's kind of weird to use saltine's for the base...but my friend introduced me to this treat and you can't just eat one piece!  Very addictive!!!  EXCELLENT!!! Very fast for a quick treat to take to a party! Everyone is SHOCKED that saltines are used as it really does taste like Almond Rocha!!

Super easy and will completely replace your toffee recipe.  Every time I make these I have to hide a couple so I make sure I get to enjoy them like everyone else.

I love this recipe. It is so inexpensive and addictive! The only problem I have is that in the few times I've made this, about half the time everything comes out great, easy to remove from my stoneware bar pan, and the other half of the time it seems a bit burnt and very hard to chisel out of the pan. Today I didn't stir the butter/sugar mixture as it boiled as the recipe says to do, and I got the almost burnt, stuck on version. Last week I did stir the butter/sugar, and everything came out great. Not sure if this is the reason for the difference in results, or if something is wrong with my oven. This won't stop me from making these and trying to figure it out!

These are delicious, simple, and would be great to make with your kiddos! I found that leaving out the nuts was preferred by both my husband and I, but liked the idea of sprinkling sprinkles over them from another reviewer. I added more chocolate the second time around to balance out the rich toffee flavor.  Tips: make sure you line the jelly roll pan or edged cookie sheet with foil as the sweet mixture sticks to even non-stick surfaces. If you like a crispier, saltier cracker base don't drown the crackers with the boiled mixture, just use less. And last but not least, if you make a hot mess of breaking it into pieces like I did, the crumbled pieces make one heck of a great ice cream topping or are fun to put in (or use as the crust) chocolate cream pies!

This is a great recipe. I liked it the second time better. Instead of laying out the crackers I crushed a little then stirred them into the toffee and poured the mixture out on the cookie sheet. That way the crackers could soak in the toffee more. Topped with pecans and Heath bits.

I thought these were really good and easy to make.  They sort of taste like almond roca. Lining the pan with aluminum foil and then spraying it with cooking spray is an excellent idea.  I put mine in the freezer to cool and then cut them with a knife.  They don't cut evenly but the edges are sharper and don't have a torn look about them. Even the crumbs left over in the pan are delicious!

This is the easiest Christmas baking recipe you'll find!  So simple, yet so delicious!  I too prefer to use milk chocolate chips, and instead of pecans (due to nut allergies in my family), I top with crushed pretzels--the sweet and salty contrast is awesome!!!  Thanks for sharing! :)

Increased by 25% because of the size of my baking pan - worked perfectly.....but if you are going to skimp?  Skimp on the chocolate as that is the part that takes the longest to "set."

Soooo addictive. When you get a crumb without chocolate on it, the flavour of the soda cracker seems to show through A BIT, but as long as everything is thoroughly smothered in chocolate they're AMAZING. I experimented with different toppings (coconut, chopped almond, cocoa crisped rice, white chocolate...) with limitless success. I'm definitely making these again at Christmas.

These cookies are DELICIOUS!  They taste just like a Heath bar and are incredibly easy to make.  I would definitely line a jelly roll pan with foil first.  I let them cool on the stove top and then froze them before breaking them into pieces.

I've had this recipe at a potluck for work and never knew how to make it. It's so easy and with things I already have! It tasted like a heath bar. I made it twice, the first time I baked it for five minutes and it came out too chewy. The second time I baked it for six minutes and it came out perfect. I added pecans in the toffee mixture before pouring over the crackers. I added more pecans on top of the chocolate. It was like eating a candy bar. I'm definetly giving these away for the holidays.

Sooooooo Good and easy.  The best part is I always have the ingredients in the pantry and takes no time to make when you have that sweet tooth.  You can switch this up with graham crackers and use marshmallows on top for a s'more taste!  Enjoy!

I made half with semi-sweet chocolate and pecans and half with white chocolate and pecans. Both were delicious, but the white chocolate side was even better! I highly recommend!

I love this recipe because it's easy, it's virtually foolproof, and it's impressive.  My exchange student daughter and her two friends sampled my first fresh batch and they couldn't believe how good they were!  I reduced the brown sugar to 3/4 cup and chopped up toasted almonds.  When the cookies were done, I put them in the refrigerator for about 20 minutes and it helped the toffee and chocolate topping to harden.  I used parchment paper to line the cookie sheet and it was easy clean up and no sticking.  Use a pizza cutter or pastry cutter instead of breaking them into pieces for a nicer presentation.  I will make these again and again!

This was so easy, it became the major component of my home-made Christmas gifts! I sprinkled with red and green jimmies for a festive look before it completely cooled. Everyone loved it. Thank you!

this recipe is poorly written, but using a few helpful tips from reviewers i managed to make this delicious, can't-stop-eating-it treat.  i used graham crackers (1/2 box) instead of saltines & it gave it a better flavor. the butter/brown sugar spread pretty thin, but was manageable.  next time i would make a couple adjustments: use a smaller pan (maybe 9x13) & try using less butter. MMMMMM!!!

Ok, I think if you just cook the sugar and butter until it stays together it might have been better. One batch was good, the other was full of sugar on the bottom. Must use real Saltines, not Kroger brand. I have used this recipe various times with various results. Don't know why it isn't the same all the time.

I also use graham crackers instead of saltines, but have always gotten rave reviews from friends whenever I make this. This is so easy, and pretty much foolproof. Thank you!

This is an easy cookie to make a large quantity of without sacrificing quality. The cookies come out wonderful and they are really delicious - perfect balance of salty/sweet/crunchy/chocolatel-y. I have a nut allergy so I substituted the nuts with crushed candy cane bits - just a little for color. The little bit of mint was a nice addition.

It's awesome!! I do make a few alterations..... -I line cookie sheet with foil and spray with Pam -I use enough crackers to cover the cookie sheet that has sides -butter and sugar i do 1 1/2 cups each -chocolate chips i do half milk chocolate and half semisweet -after turning off oven and sprinkling on chips i pop baking in oven for almost a min to melt chips quickly -and i toast almond slices before sprinkling them on  Tip: when cooled cut in to four parts then on cutting board pizza cutter works great to cut into small pieces  I've been told it's as addictive as crack.  Enjoy :-)

Fabulous!  So easy and very tasty!  I covered my cookie sheet with foil and found that one sleeve of crackers covered the whole thing.  Definitely follow the tips to let the butter & sugar boil for 3 minutes after it comes to a rolling boil.  And, do not stir during that time.  I used milk chocolate chips since that's what I had on hand.  And, instead of nuts I sprinkled some colored sugar crystals on for the holidays!  Threw the whole pan in the fridge for close to an hour and they were set up perfectly.  The foil lifted right out of the pan and peeled right off the back of the cookies.  Great recipe!

I tried this last night and not sure what I did wrong, but they are extra chewy today.  I boiled for just over 3 minutes.  Even baked 2 minutes longer than stated because I had to run out of the room and didn't hear the timer. I sprayed my pan with butter flavor spray before placing the crackers. Let it sit 20 minutes then stuck in the freezer 20 minutes to set up so when it came out of the freezer it just gave it a little twist and they popped right off like an ice cube tray.  No foil or parchment needed. They broke apart pretty easy and it was crisp at first, but now are mega sticky and chewy. Gave it a 5 because it had to have been something I did to make them chewy. Taste great sprinkled with a little sea salt that has been mixed with just a teeny bit of cayenne pepper.

This is sooooo good!! It's amazing such an easy thing to make would taste so good.  The only thing I shouldn't have done was, using wax paper....  It stuck to the crackers.  Well, learn from a mistake.

Works every time, as written. I've started using a silpat mat, and nothing sticks to it, unlike parchment or wax paper. Sometimes I crush preztels and sprinkle them on after baking before the chocolate chips. Works with matzoh and unsalted saltines too. Also works with graham crackers if you need an extra pound of sugar in your diet.

Very good. Following other reviews' advice, I lined by pan with foil and sprayed with cooking spray.  I didn't stir while the toffee was cooking, either.  The taste wasn't as sophisticated as I had expected, as I could still taste the saltines (even though I used those with no-salt tops as someone else suggested).  But I'm sure they will still be devoured, as is anything chocolate around here.

Super easy to make. I used light brown sugar and it came out perfect with a beautiful caramel color. Also the aluminun foil sprayed with PAM makes it easy to break up as well as clean up. Took them to a brunch and the women raved about them. Will make again. Next time I will try with 1 1/2 cups of chocolate.

Many other people liked these, but I wasn't a fan.  Light brown sugar may give a better taste.  And I had a hard time getting the chocolate to spread, even after putting the tray back in the oven for a few minutes.  Probably will not make again.

I made these wrong the first time I tried them and never tried them again.  Too bad for me b/c these are wonderful if boiled for exactly 3 mins after a rolling boil starts.  I also put these immediately into the fridge after spreading the choc. chips. and dusting with pecan pieces.  I let sit in fridge for 2-3 hours before breaking smoothly into pieces.  These also lift right out of the pan with no residue left behind. Really easy recipe!

With chopped almonds, it tasted similar to Almond Roca.  Although the flavor was good, it was a bit too sweet for me. Also, the texture did not get as hard as I had hoped. It was firm, but not brittle-like. It could have been my mistake, though. After reading reviews, I learned that I should NOT have stirred the butter/sugar mixture during the boiling phase (I stirred it constantly). Maybe this is why the toffee did not set up as hard -- quite a bit of butter separated and soaked into the crackers, softening that layer. After cooling, the bottom had a layer of re-solidified oil. 4 stars for flavor, 2 stars for texture = 3 stars overall. I can understand why so many people loved this, but it is just not my personal preference. If you have a serious sweet tooth and craving that toffee flavor, this recipe delivers. Just make sure to read the reviews for helpful tips.

Great! I have an extra large cookie sheet so I doubled the recipe. It didn't quite reach the egdes with the toffee so that was my only complaint. Other than that it was good! I stuck it in the snow for half an hour and then cut it into pieces. : )

I made them to package up as gifts but we ate half of them already. I didn't have dark brown sugar so I added 1 Tbs molasses as a previous reviewer suggested and that worked fine.  I topped some with toasted chopped hazelnuts but I think I prefer them w/o. The times and temps specified in the recipe worked perfectly for me. The only issue I had - I used a large cookie sheet without sides lined with parchment.  I think the cookie sheet is probably a bit warped b/c I had some runoff into the bottom of my oven. Next time I'll use a sheet with sides.  Next time will be today.

WOW!!  These are amazing!  If you like Heath toffee candy bars you will love these!  I used milk chocolate chips, and just let it cool overnight.  I used a pizza cutter to help break the pieces apart in the morning.  This will definitely become a traditional item in our family for the holidays!

I have made these numerous times- always with great success. Today I drizzled almond bark over for contrast- pretty! Plus learned how to add 1 T of Molasses to my light brown sugar to make it dark brown sugar. One of my favorites. Also, the ingredients are always on hand.

wow! i also made a batch with roasted-blanched-slivered almonds on top and no chocolate and it turned out great. just press the nuts a little into the toffee before it hardens. i'm bringing it to all my christmas/hanukkah parties this year. 

growing up, we used to make "matzoh-roca" (almond roca using passover matzoh instead of saltines) but this is perfect; the salt adds a perfect ballance to the sweet toffee but unlike pretzels, they are are delicate and flakey.

Wow these are great!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I only baked it in the oven for about 3 minutes, longer and it probably would of burned. A little messy to make, but well worth it! I didn't spray or line my cookie sheet, but didn't really have a problem "popping" the cookies off.  I cut strips with a pizza cutter, then just lifted each strip with a spatula, and broke those into pieces. I used store brand crackers which absorbed the toffee nicely. Can't wait to try different flavor variations!

These were really good.  I used milk chocolate chips and they didn't melt very well. I even put them back into the oven for quite awhile.  Next time I'll use semi-sweet chocolate or melt the chocolate and pour over the cookies.  I will also use real butter next time.  They were very tasty even if they didn't look very pretty.

I have simply died and gone to heaven. I like them cold...keep 'em refrigerated and watch 'em disappear! Mine didn't have time to get stale..lol. I made one batch w/ chocolate chips topped with pecans; the other just plain pb chips, no topping. Both went FAST. Use Reynolds wrap no stick easy release foil. OMG what a wonderful product! The hardest part was boiling the sugar. I started the 3 minutes at hard boil (big bubbles) and it turned out perfect. Also, don't bake them longer than 3 minutes (TY other poster!) or they just might burn :( This is a KEEPER!

I must warn yall though, that you have to be somewhat of an artist when you do this recipe.  If you don't boil the butter and sugar long enough, then the caramel is too soft, and doesn't taste good.  If you boil too long, then it burns and you have to throw the whole thing out.  The boiling time actually depends on the size of the pan or pot you use.  With a larger pan, the caramel cooks faster, as more surface area is exposed to the heat.  But if you manage to get it right, then the toffee is excellent.  I boil my caramel for 5 mins.  You just have to work it out yourself.  Blessings--aeworu

I'm only giving this recipe a 4 as I don't think it's quite right.  Use a LARGE cookie sheet and a whole stack of saltines.  I followed the recipe exactly but the baking time is definitely off.  First of all, time the 3 minutes once the boiling has started.  It will look kind of like jelly - weird!  After it is poured on the crackers, only bake for 3-4 minutes and check!  Mine was burnt after 5.  This is hard to know as it is the bottom that is burnt.  Pour the chocolate chips on top and spread with a cake decorator knife after about 2 minutes.  I will try this again but not bake as long.

I made this recipie 3 years ago because it looked easy and it is, however I never expected to get such an amazing response.  I have brought it to work one Christmas and I get special requests every year since to make sure I don't forget them.  I brought these to a church pot luck and literally had people seek me out to find out the recipie.  For such an easy cookie it packs an amazing flavor and texture that people truly can't forget.  Thank you so much for the wonderful cookie recipie.  My family and friends will enjoy them for years to come!

Super easy and delicious holiday treat!!  The only thing I did differently was I lined the pan with foil and sprayed it with Pam before putting the crackers down.  Other than that I followed the recipe and they turned out SO good!

I have made this with the saltines and no chocolate on top and with ritz crackers and no chocolate. The ritz are really good and so are the saltines with  no chocolate just the toffee. I have also made it with ritz crackers and white chocolate chips. This was awesome.  Great recipe.  A five star at the least. It should be rated higher.

I agree with KIMBACUB, these should be named "CRACK" they are so addictive!  Bet you can't eat just one!  Everyone loved'em at our pot luck and I will be making them over and over again.  Thanks for a great simple recipe.

10 Stars!!! We couldn't believe how tasty and simple these were. 5 ingredients and one of them those nasty little saltines that sit in the back of my cupboard for months! Great use for them. I made this exactly as written except the cooling part. It was close to 90 degrees in my house and I knew they'd never cool in time to eat so I threw it in the freezer for about 45 minutes. Came right off the foil (sprayed with cooking spray) and they  cracked nicely. Didn't even have a problem with the chocolate coming off like some did after they put theirs in the 'fridge. These will go in the permanent file.

This is a wonderful, simple dessert for the holiday season. I added some red and green sprinkles on top of the chocolate (post-oven) to give it a bit of Christmas flair. It was an instant hit in my dorm!

This will knock your socks off!  I make them every Christmas.  Be sure to line your pan rimmed baking sheet with foil or you will be sorry.  The foil lifts out and peels off the back making it so much easier to get out of the pan neatly.  I've topped with both pecans or walnuts and both are very good.

My boyfriend's mom has made these as a Christmas cookie staple for years and everyone loves them.  They are easy and cheap so everyone wins!  This time around, I used a whole cookie sheet full of crackers (about 1 1/3 sleeves) and the toffee covered but it's not as thick as I'd like.  I think next time I'll up the butter and sugar each by 1/4 cup.  I also didn't need to return the pan to the oven for the chips to melt.

These are quite different, but yummy. The only thing that my 3 yr old daughter and I get frustarted with is that they stick in your teeth, but then again what good things don't?? This is a great one for your child to bring into their classroom. Fun to make too. Thanks for sharing. This is now a holiday favorite.

This is great to do w/kids. We also use graham crackers, top w/nuts and pour sugar/butter over. They make great gifts.

These are seriously delicious. I followed the recipe, but used white chocolate chips instead of regular. Boiled the brown sugar/butter for exactly three minutes, as stated in the recipe, they turned out perfect. Thanks so much for this recipe!

OMG!!! These are soooo good!  Quick and easy!  I did use the foil to line the pan, and sprayed first with butter flavored cooking spray, they released just fine.  It did seem like I had too much butter/sugar mix for the amount of crackers, as there was a fair amount of butter kind of floating around the edges that didn't harden, even after refrigerating for an hour.  Maybe that was my fault that I did not use enough crackers.  Next time (and there will most definately be a next time)  I will just cut the butter/sugar mix down to 3/4 c. as the crackers completely filled my largest pan.  A super, tasty, easy, treat!!  Thanks for the recipe!!!!!

Delicious! I made a half with nuts, and the other without. The side without nuts did not taste good. 
But the ones with nuts was so good, I had some for breakfast. :c)

Thank you SO much!

Warning: If using parchment paper USE A JELLY ROLL PAN!!!! We didn't and after 6 minutes in the oven, the crackers slid off the edges onto the bottom of the stove. Major smokey mess! But still delicious ;o)

VERY EASY TO MAKE BUT TOO SWEET FOR ME.  I THOUGHT THEY WERE HARD TO GET OUT OF THE PAN.  I USED A 9 X 13 CAKE PAN, SHOULD HAVE USED A COOKIE SHEET! I ALSO SPRINKLED THEM WITH TOFFEE BITS INSTEAD OF NUTS.  MY FAMILY DIDN'T LIKE THEM (NOT CHOCOLATE LOVERS) BUT THE OFFICE LOVED THEM!

How delicious!!! They were a big success!! I read a few of the reviews on the recipe and did take the advice of two writers, one, to switch graham crackers for saltines, and two, to press the nuts down on the chocolate while the chocolate was still melted. I couldn't keep anyone's fingers out of the candy jar. People were sneaking extra pieces to take home with them. Fanastic Recipe. Thank you so much. I already have it on a recipe card for the next family get together.

Who would of thought that crackers could be made into such a rich sinful morsel! You must line the pan 1st!! This really is more like a candy i think. It is wonderful whatever you want to call it. I made two batches 1 with semi sweet chocolate and the 2nd with butterscotch chips. I can't decide which i like better. I also want to try it with the chocolate peanut butter swirl chips next time.

Excellent!  The first thing to go on my holiday cookie tray.  These are insanely quick and easy to make too.  I always put them in the refrigerator for about an hour before breaking them into pieces.  These are also great with graham crackers instead of saltines.

These came out great!  I made sure to freeze them before scoring w/a pizza cutter, as someone else had suggested.  I had to return them a couple of times (I was wrapping them individually in wax paper and placing in a tin to take back home to NY with me for the family) as I was braking them, as the toffee and chocolate got warm and gooey.  These taste very decadent!!

These little treats are absolutely delicious!  To me they taste exactly like a Skor candy bar!  Not only do they taste great but they are inexpensive and simple enough for the kids to pitch in.  Excellant, I will definately be making these again!

I chopped up mixed nuts and sprinkled on top.  Great gift when wrapped in a pretty bag and tied with CHRISTmas ribbon!:)

This recipe is so good, and very easy to make!  I made it with milk chocolate chips (that's what I had on hand), and it was great!  I plan on making other ones with different chips & nuts (like white choc. and macadamia nuts.)  I would definitely recommend using parchment paper, as it made the squares very easy to handle, and there was practically no mess.  Also, be sure to use a baking pan/sheet with sides.  I learned the hard way that the toffee spreads a little when baking, so I almost had it go over the sides!  I would also recommend putting the pan in the freezer after you have baked it (and it has cooled to the touch)--it makes the toffee easier to handle, and it cools a lot quicker.  Great recipe!!!

These are delicious!  Very easy, the hardest thing was waiting for them to cool so we could break them apart and eat them.  Next time I will use a little less chocolate, I think, but that is just personal preference, I like to taste the toffee a bit more.  I love it!  I will be including them in my Christmas baking!

OMG - These are WONDERFUL.  I used the no-stick foil and spray shortening to line pan.  NOTHING stuck to the pan.  These are awesome, easy to make, short prep time and so very inexpensive.  Will now be a holiday regular.

I have made this recipe the past three Christmases and everyone always asks for the recipe.  I love how easy this is, and I love the rich buttery taste.  I would consider these more of a candy than a cookie though.  They break perfectly into squares when cooled and make a fabulous food gift.  I always make one batch with Ghiardelli milk chocolate chips and another with white chips.  I always use Reynolds Release nonstick foil, no problems at all with sticking.  I have never topped with nuts, though I am sure they would be just as good.

These were excellent.  The mixture of sweet toffee with the salty crackers was so good!  I have made a similar recipe in the past and these were so much better tasting and actually stayed together.  I'd recommend using a really good dark chocolate (I like Ghiradelli double chocolate chips).  Because I'm allergic to pecans, I used toasted hazelnuts.  These were gone FAST!

Tracy saved my sanity! I had a case of 1000 saltine crackers that I did not know what I was going to do with! I tried the recipe lastnight and loved it! Everyone that walks within 50 feet of my house will be getting a tin of these this Christmas!
Has anyone tried them with white chocolate and crushed peppermint on top like the peppermint bark candy?

This was totally great and waaaaaaaay simple. There is no way by the end that anyone would guess that you used saltines. The crunch that the saltines provide with the chewiness of the toffee makes the ultimate crowd pleaser. I only regret that i didn't make a double batch because i only got to eat one before they disappeared at thanksgiving!! The foil and cooking spray are a must and make the clean-up just as easy as making it!

this is an easy, delicious recipe. I  used about 3/4 of a sleeve of saltines because I had a small pan, which I lined with no stick aluminum foil.

I use club crackers for this recipe and put the nuts in the butter and sugar after boiling the two.  Then pour on the club crackers and bake....then i drizzle on melted chocolate after they cool.  they are delicious.

These turned out alright, the pan I used wasnt the best so most of the carmelly stuff sank to the middle so when it was ready to break it was mushy there, gooey is probably a better word. Very Rich! but tasty, my kids love them, hubby wanted them to be firmer, but thought they were alright. If you use foil you MUST use cooking spray, I forgot too and had a rough time peeling it off the bottom before breaking it up. Besides the problems with the foil & pan it was a very simple tasty recipe.

Second attempt at reviewing since first one does not appear to have worked. This is a very good cookie recipe and I found it very easy to make. I did line my cookie sheet with foil and sprayed the foil with Pam, and I had no problem with sticking. I plan to make some for Christmas gift tins also.

this recipe is one of my all-time favorite, easiest-to-bake cookies. i usually dont use nuts and opt for milk chocolate rather than semi-sweet. but these are dangerous to have around the house..id eat a whole tray if left to my own devices..

This recipe has great potential but lacks some key information.  Due to fluctuations in humidity, etc., boiling the sugar mix for 3 minutes may not be sufficient.  I expected the toffee part to be more brittle in consistency.  What I ended up was very soft, somewhat chewy, cookies/candy.  I think there might the recipe might turn out better if a temperature guide for the sugar mix were given.  Also, another bit of missing info was how these should be stored and how long they may be kept.

This recipe was delicious.  Bravo!  The only thing that I had a problem with was the crackers staying in perfect alignmen after I took it out of the oven, but that doesn't affect the taste, now does it?

What I love most about this is how versitile it is.  Try white chips with crushed peppermint, or crushed oreo's or how about milk chocolate chips with tosted coconut I usually make several different pans.

This was super easy.  I used stale crackers, light brown sugar, and three different chips (the leftovers from three bags) and the result was wonderful!  I stuck it in the fridge after 1/2 hour to speed up the cool down.  Excellent recipe, Thanks!

I was dubious about the idea of saltines and toffee, but am I ever glad that I gave this recipe a try!!!  It's fantastic!  I took some over to my friend's house and she keeps asking me to bring it back.  A word of caution - this is NOT a recipe for those opposed to super sweet treats.

I've tried this recipe last Christmas with 4 other cookie recipes and this was the easiest and quickest to make and also was the biggest hit!  Forget the rest, I’m just gonna stick with this recipe only for this year.  My family and I love the taste of toffee a bit bitter, so I always make sure the butter and sugar become dark enough.  Thank you for sharing this amazing recipe.

This is a wonderful recipe and is requested every year since I started making them 3 years ago. I use many variations...cashews, almonds, white chocolate, etc. for variety and since oven temperatures vary, the cookies need to be checked often to be sure that they do not burn. I can't wait to begin making them in a couple of weeks for the holidays. Enjoy!!!!

I make these all the time.  I use unsalted butter and unsalted saltines.  I line the cookie sheet with foil.  When the come out of the fridge, I just turn them over the the foil peels right off!  NO messy cleanup!

This was super easy and absolutely YUMMY!!  I used a jelly roll pan instead of a cookie sheet.  (BTW -- 4 ounces of saltines is approximately a sleeve of saltines that will line a jelly roll pan.)  A similar recipe I've used is with graham crackers and not using the chocolate!  The chocolate definitely is MUCH better!  :-D  I also did as my graham cracker recipe called for and used 1 stick of butter and 1 stick of margarine.  Regardless......this one totally rocks!!  Thanks, Tracy!!

SO yummy & easy to make!  The perfect sweet/salty/crunchy combo. I used the Reynolds non stick foil and it's as if they made that stuff just for this recipe.  Not a problem at all with sticking and after refrigeration, the cookies broke apart nicely.  Oh, and if the crackers don't fit perfectly on the the pan, just improvise and use more or less or break some in half to get a full sheet of crackers!  Everyone enjoyed them and with some Christmas sprinkles on top, they looked so festive.  I'm going to keep these ingredients on hand for a quick dessert to take to parties.  I made a few trays and had to use milk chocolate, semi sweet and even the dark chocolate chips and I thought they were all delicious and so did everyone else!

Good last minute recipe.  My husband finds it tastes like a Skor chocolate bar. Didn't have Pam, so lightly buttered foil, left it over night to cool & was very easy to come out.

This is a great recipe, one I have cooked for years.  It always gets rave reviews and gets gobbled up at family/office gatherings.  As other reviewers noted, it is best to cover your cookie sheet with heavy foil and spray well with Pam.  Also, don't use too large of a cookie sheet, there will not be enough brown sugar/butter mixture to cover the crackers.  If done correctly, most people won't know it is made with saltines. They are amazed when you tell them the main ingredient is saltine crackers!!

These are so great- i made them just as instructed except i used low sodium crackers and lined the cookie sheet with sprayed alum. foil- WOW that made it so easy - and i can see that without that they would be extrememly messy- i let them sit over night and the results were great- my hubby said they are a snack that we should always have around the house- they would also be great with any kind of nuts although i used pecans YUMMY---*****

Well even though I made a few mistakes, they still turned out pretty yummy.  First of all my cookie sheet was too big.  The crackers did not touch on the sheet to the mixture went between them.  Second I used a chocolate chunk instead of chocolate chip.  I think the melting point is higher for the chunks, because I could not get them to melt, I even put it back into oven at 350 for 5 minutes, long story short use a "normal size cookies sheet and chocolate chips.  Next time I 'll get it right.

i can't believe how good these are! I recently made 10 batches of these for a bake sale. They were completely gone in under an hour. I first made these this past Christmas for a get together and everyone just loved them. Even my kids ate them, and they hate nuts!  I have used not only pecans, but walnuts, almonds and peanuts. All are equally good. Thanks for a great treat!

YUM!  And sooo easy!  This was gone the same day I made it.  I lined the tray with foil to make clean up easy, too.

I could taste what was trying to be achieved here but personally thought it was a little overkill.  The butter and sugar could easily be cut in half and instead of pouring over the saltines, it would be better to dip the saltines and then place on foil.  Then maybe just melt the chocolate and spread.  My main problem was when I poured the sugar and butter, it formed a thick layer under the saltines, which never properly set even overnight.  Maybe I did something wrong though.  These are tasty and do taste similar to a Heath bar.

Let me put it this way.  I made a plate and left for a few hours, and when I came back, there was one only one square left.  Needless to say, it was a hit.

These cookies are great!!  They are so easy to make and everyone loves them.  Make sure you spray PAM on the aluminum foil before placing the crackers on it.

Ooooh My, Tracy! How wonderful! These are soooo easy and sooo delicious. Kind of addictive, too. I volunteered to take four 5 year olds until their mom's get home from work tomorrow. Can I do it? Well, with the help of easy recipes like this one, I figure we'll have a "Let's bake cookies" kind of an afternoon. I'm busy rounding up recipes like this one that will be sooo easy and sooo good. Thanks for sharing Tracy.

These are so great and easy.  My modifications:  Lined a jelly roll pan with aluminum foil and brushed the foil with Wilton Cake Release.  I used Keebler Club crackers (they fit perfectly on a jelly roll pan) and MILK chocolate chips.  Refrigerated the bars after cooling for a little while--scored them with a pizza cutter, and later broke them when they were totally cold.  It was easy and they came off the foil, no problem!  AWESOME!

These are so simple to make my 9 year old could do it. And delicious! I am making tons of them for christmas. I used un-salted butter since the recipe didn't specify since the crackers are so salty.

Wow!  This is unbelievably easy and so delicious.  I added these to my Christmas cookie packages.  There's no sticky mess if you line the pan with foil and then spray with nonstick spray. I then stuck them in the fridge before breaking!  Taste like a candy bar!

UNBELIEVABLE! Tastes like almond rocha... even though I used pecans. I used the pecan cookie pieces which are ground fairly fine. I was worried that it might stick because I didn't grease the cookie sheet, but I had no trouble. I put them in the freezer for about 30-40 minutes to cool. Then I used a pizza cutter along the sides of the cookie sheet and then used it to cut up the pieces. Some broke, but then it looked more like toffee candy.  I couldn't bear to see all those crumbs go to waste when I cut them up, so I mixed the crumbs into vanilla ice cream. Delicious!

I made this for the kids, but the adults gave it a Big WOW!  The salt in the saltines gives this a really nice flavor.  Wish I could find a thicker saltine tho'!  If you're like me and haven't mastered cutting cookies neatly, keep in mind these can be quite messy.  Overall - excellent toffee flavor, and fun texture. A must Try!

I'm so glad to finally find this recipe! I made these in seventh grade home ec class and they were wonderful. I have found, like another reviewer, that they do get really sugary the next day. A great cookie though and much easier than making butter toffee.

These were very easy and tasty and were well received.  The only problem I had was that they got very soft and sugary the next day.  I am wondering if that's usual and if they're just something best eaten the same day or if I'd done something wrong.  But, that didn't affect my rating here, I just thought I'd mention it in case it happens to anyone else.

These are very easy to make, and no one can guess that there are saltines in them.  I find the toffee part to be a little too sweet for my taste, although it tastes very good.  Any suggestions for how to make it less overwhelmingly sweet?

This was absolutely the best!  I made it for a Christmas party and everyone raved.  I used foil on my cookie sheet and sprayed it with Baker's Joy.  I used an extra 1/2 cup of white chocolate chips, and no nuts.  Can't wait to make these again!

This is THE best & easiest recipe. I don't normally cook, so I was pleased with how easy it was. Don't forget to line the pan w/foil.

Very good and easy to make.  My husband loved them, and he doesn't like nuts.  A little hard to break into pieces without the chocolate falling off the top. Going to make another batch this weekend.

My gosh, this is GREAT! and easy, easy, easy.
Tastes like toffee with Texas sheet cake frosting.
Just remember to line your pan with foil AND 
grease the pan (I used a spray and it worked fine)
I hope these freeze well so my husband and I won't
eat all of it-it's very addictive.

It was DELICIOUS! Was a little tuff cleaning the pan after, it was probably just my pan, old and grumpy! But I never would have thought you could throw this stuff together to come out with a toffee type candy cookie. I loved it and will make again!

This is my first time making this,  overall its very simple and it turned out well.

note:  
***minimalize / dont stir the butter and sugar once they start boiling, it prevents them from merging properly and youll get puddles of butter.
*** line the tray with aluminum

This was great!!!
I added a 1/4 recipe more to fill the jelly roll pan more evenly. Added pecan on half of the recipe for the pecan lovers. This made a great Christmas treat for the family.

Heed the warnings in other peoples reviews about timing... I burned the first batch after getting distracted by television and let it cook a minute or two too long. It only burned around the edges where the toffee was thinner, hence the reason I made a little bit more to even it out. The last thing you want is that bitter burned sugar taste ruining this desert.

This is a great recipe. My only change is to double to toffee ingredients if you use a large cookie tray. I have to make this and then hide it so it lasts more than one day.

Someone made us a version of this and my husband loved it so much I searched for a recipe and found this. It’s fantastic! I will say, I cut the amount of chocolate. Even my chocoholic husband agreed, the called for amount messed with the yummy ratio of salty cracker to toffee. Cut the amount of chocolate chips by 1/2 cup to 1 cup and it’s a winner!!! Also, followed the advice of another review and used a pan with sides, covered with foil, and you MUST spray with cooking spray. Trust me, I forgot on the first batch-what a mess! Thanks for the great recipe! Happy hubby. :)

Made this once before and it was great. This time the toffee mixture was not spreadable but pourable. I used parchment on my pan and half the mixture ended up under the parchment. Considered scraping it and not wasting the chocolate chips but onward I go. I think I will end up with the following layers once it is cooled: toffee, parchment, saltines, toffee, chocolate, nuts, salvaged toffee that had run off the sides. It's a new 7-layer treat w/ extra fiber ;) Sigh.

I didn't boil for the whole 3 minutes because it started boiling over around 2.5.  I used milk chocolate chips.  I toasted almond slices and used that to top my candy.  Delicious!

Great and easy recipe...I think there is too much chocolate in this one...halve the chips and grind them fine before if you want for better coverage.  I also will use any cracker or thin cookie for variety...also different nuts...want to try Brazil nuts.  I might roast the nuts too for better flavour.  Try chips from someone other than Hersheys for a change of pace...I find I taste more "Hersheys" than chocolate with theirs.  Giradelli or anyone, even generic can get you away from that "same old" taste.  Warning....HIGHLY ADDICTIVE!  Will not last!

Absolutely amazing! I,ve made over 10 times... everyone raves about them. Very simple and quick to make. I make with milk chocolate chips and really crush the walnuts.

Quick, easy, and delicious. Definitely use foil to line your pan. I didn’t have problems with it sticking to the foil. I chilled in the fridge for about 20 minutes after spreading the chocolate, and then put in the freezer until completely cooled. This made it easier to break into pieces.

ohhhh...how I wanted to like these. I must have done something wrong, but these did not turn out how I thought.  I will try again, since so many people seem to like them.

These were a hit at my Super Bowl party.  Very addicting! However, they were very messy to eat.  The nuts would crumble off after a bite.  Next time I might try omitting them completely or stick em under the chocolate.

This stuff is amazing!!  I made it exactly as written with the addition of a pinch of salt in the butter/sugar mixture for more of a salted caramel taste.  Also I used walnuts because I didn’t have pecans. Will definitely make this over and over. It reminds me of the pecan brittle from Ethel M’s chocolates in Vegas,  which we used to get every year when we lived there and which costs about 30 dollars for a small box.

Only giving 2 starts because I think you forgot finishing and storage.  I've made versions of this  for years.  This year I did 1/2 a sheet with the chocolate and pecans and the other half with a mixture of butterscotch/semi sweet chocolate chips.  (Use half bag of butterscotch.)  You should add finishing and storage:  Place in freezer for 15 minutes to harden.  Store in airtight container for 1 week or in refrigerator for 2.

Really good! Easy. Fast. Boiled butter and sugar mixture as directed in stainless steel sauce pan, did not stir once combined and full boil was in progress. It did not scorch or stick. After pouring over crackers just put pot in sink and soaked. Easy clean up minutes later.  Such an easy and delicious treat. Will be making again soon.

These are VERY good!  I followed some advice in other reviews and I'm glad I did: one, use nonstick foil; and two, don't stir the butter+sugar mixture while boiling.  These are easy to make and taste terrific, I'll certainly make them again!

I have made this several times already. My family is crazy about them. My favorite way to make them is with salt and cayenne pepper on the top and with(bare) toasted coconut chips instead if nuts. They're fantastic.

The only thing that id did wrong was not greasing up my pan or using parchment paper. This made it difficult to get out of the pan. Other than that I had lots of compliments. It was a bit too chocolaty for me - next time I'll add some butterscotch chips.

I make this just the way the recipe says. After it cools, I take the whole thing out of the pan, and put it back into the pan upside down, then I sprinkle chocolate chips ( the same kind that is on the other side, or different, for a different taste) put it in the oven just long enough to soften them, the spread all over, top with nuts, etc.,if you like., let set up, then cut or break up. Doing this, makes both sides have a covering of chocolate on your "toffee" and you do not see any part of the crackers.

This was super easy and yummy. I did not put pecans on top due to a nut allergy. Instead we put holiday sprinkles on it. We also put the whole tray in the freezer to help harden before breaking apart into pieces. It will take a long time to cool off without some help.

Very yummy! I don't know if I needed more sugar or butter, but I needed just a little bit more of the topping to spread to all the crackers. I used regular chocolate chips rather than semisweet and I probably would have been good with less than 2 cups. I also sprinkled some toffee bits on top rather than nuts.

Update-I made this a second time and I think the problem I had with not enough of the toffee spread was that it boiled longer and came out harder/thicker. The second time I made it, it came out thinner and I thought I had solved my issue( I had re-read a bunch of reviews and didn't stir while boiling and timed it for 3 mins)...but that created another issue. The toffee spread leaked down under all the crackers. It was still good, but it wasn't as good because you lost the salt from the crackers.

So easy to make and kinda hard to resist. I did not prep my cookie sheet at all and threw the pan in the fridge for a final good chill after cooled. Popped right off of the pan. Broken pieces look more authentic than keeping as perfect square cracker shapes. Love them and plan to fatten up my coworkers on Monday!

Definitely remember NOT to stir while boiling. The toffee mixture should come to a full rolling boil, and should be foaming up around the edges before you start the 3-minute timer. You're going to think it's burning, but it's not. Resist the temptation to stir! DO NOT ALTER the butter & brown sugar - it will change the consistency of your toffee and it won't set up right. I do wish I had used milk chocolate chips instead of semisweet. The toffee was just a bit too rich with the semisweet chocolate, which is the only reason why I gave 4 stars instead of 5.

Made some changes for gluten-free diets. Two different varieties, one with gluten-free pretzels and one with gluten-free Schars table crackers. Used Snyders GF pretzels, put a whole bag in a plastic bag and used a rolling pin until they were all broken up, small pieces but not fine particles.  Line pan with tinfoil and grease. Spread a single layer of the pretzel pieces. Sprayed lightly with Pam and sprinkled a small amount of sea salt. This is necessary because a lot of the salt falls off during the rolling process. Cook sugar and butter as directed and pour over pretzels. Because the pieces are small and rounded, it will be difficult to spread the toffee. I mixed it all together and then re-spread out in the pan. Finished the recipe as directed. 

Version two with Schars GF table crackers, followed recipe exactly, except lightly sprayed the crackers with Pam and sprinkled small amount of sea salt before pouring on toffee. The sea salt is necessary because the crackers are not topped with salt. One of the reasons this is so good is the toffee/salt combo.

Brought both versions to a BBQ and they were devoured.

Very good. There is no need to waste aluminum foil - the butter provides plenty of grease for the pan, and you can loosen them while they're still warm if you're worried about sticking.

I've made this MANY times, each time add different toppings.  Quick / easy / unique for Church bake sale (free samples help).  Do not stir when sugar/butter boiling, use parafin paper in pan under saltines to easily pull out/cut when settled, top with nuts, dried fruit, coconut, gold/red/green sparkles for holiday or school event.  I cut up before completely firm in order to get perfect (small) size, otherwise it breaks where it wants to when fully hardened.  Take extra pieces, use to top ice cream.  I put in freezer to have on hand - freezes great.  The only time it came out bad was when I used OLD chocolate (should have known).

People love these, this version looks very good. They say it tastes just like a candy bar. Now with roasted pecan pieces, I expect a stronger reaction. I ran out of chocolate chips so used caramel chips instead.
If you used a candy thermometer you could be closer to caramel or toffee as you choose.

These are really easy to make, but I am not sure what I did wrong - the sugar and butter mixture was grainy.  Did I boil too long?  Not long enough?  I thought I timed it for 3 minutes like the recipe says.  Anyway, they still tasted good.

A friend gave me a dish of this “toffee crunch,” as she called it, along with the recipe one Christmas, and I’ve been making it for many years just as written.  It is super fast and easy. I top mine with nuts or seasonal sprinkles depending on the holiday, and package in decorative cello bags to share with family and friends. Be warned...this is delicious especially if you love a combination of salty and sweet, and may become addictive!! lol

This is a fabulous little treat. I never would have put this combination together, but I’m sure glad someone else did! Personal preference - I skipped the pecans. 

I froze the leftovers and they lasted a long time! I may still have some in there.

This stuff is amazing!! I’ve made it 4 years in a row as part of my Christmas treats for friends, family and employees! I love that there are minimal ingredients! And its pretty easy! The last 2 years the toffee part has not turned out properly... It came out pretty gooey. It was still good, but difficult to deal with and very messy. But I was determined to keep trying to perfect, because the first year it was PERFECT!! I tried not stirring, and stirring, and baking it longer, and boiling it longer.... well the issues was margarine! DO NOT USE MARGARINE!! Clearly the recipe says butter, but 99% of the time i use margarine instead. I’m so glad I figured out the issue, and just followed the recipe! The only change I made was not stirring it at all during the 3 minutes, after it came to a steady boil! I’m not sure if it matters, but now that its perfect, I

Fast , easy, so delicious!  I topped it with crushed mixed nuts. I also made another batch without nuts & topped it with crushed peppermint candy. I used a larger cookie sheet & added about 1/2 package more of crackers  & there was enough to spread around.

Delicious and easy. My teen son made this with minimal pointers. He will be taking it to his school holiday party. I guess I will have to make more for the family. We did add a sprinkle of course sea salt with the nuts.

Y’all I am so mad at this recipe! I tried it two different times, the first time I brought it to a boil on medium high heat, boiled 3 minuets and resisted stirring...it burnt. It burnt so badly that the house smoked up & I had to set up a makeshift ventilator with my daughters floor fan. The second time I stirred occasionally and it looked like it separated a bit. I boiled 3 minuets and it never really thickened like I’d expected. I went ahead and used the sauce, let it cool and tried a bite. Apparently it was on the brink of burning too as it had that slightly scorched taste. So 4 sticks of butter later and burning eyes and I still don’t have anything to show for it.

Excellent recipe!  I've made this  several times and it comes out perfect every time.  I use unsalted butter and light brown sugar.  I've made it with semi sweet and also milk chocolate chips, sometimes with nuts, sometimes without.  DO NOT stir  the butter and brown sugar mix while it's boiling for 3 mins or the sugar will not fully dissolve.  You really can customize this to your own liking, definitely worth trying!

Brought this to a bake sale and when we sold out, someone came to buy some and was disappointed that we had none.  She indicated that these are addictive.  I'm making it for this year's bake sale!

I will definitely make this again. I used only 3/4 c. each butter and brown sugar--heated on medium and turned down a little after it started to boil to avoid burning--1/2 c. dark chocolate chips (which I sprinkled on before putting in the oven to melt), and 1/4 c. chopped almonds. Delicious.

First time making this type of cookie. I used macadamia nuts instead of pecans, walnuts, or almonds. I didn't really know if I was suppose to stir the toffee when it was boiling, so it came out cloudy. However, it was still tasty. I'll definitely make this again.

Love these though I usually only use half the chocolate chips and toffee bits instead of nuts.  Thinking they'd be really good with caramel bits and some sea salt too.

Loved this! Per other reviewers, I did not stir the butter and sugar mixture once it started boiling, and made sure that I didn't start timing it until it was at a full boil. I used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet because that's what I had.

I was so scared to try this because not only do the saltines sound weird, but I have not had good luck with toffee.. But they turned out awesome! The only change I made was used almonds instead of walnuts. They were so easy, and everyone couldn't believe I made them, they thought they looked too perfect to be homemade. Will definitely be making these again!

I've made this several times with success, and it really is great when comments are noted.  Made it yesterday, without having reviewed the advice of others, and it was a semi-disaster.  I wish the originator, Tracy, would modify the directions to say DO NOT STIR THE TOFFEE while it's boiling! Makes a huge difference in the outcome. But otherwise the recipe is great. Thanks.

The taste was great but my saltines were not crisp, they ended up a little soggy.  I'm not quite sure what to do to insure this doesn't happen next time.  Maybe cook it longer?

I thought these were to die for.  Followed the recipe to a T. Used foil in my cookie sheet and sprayed with non stick spray. In removing the foil there were a few bits that stuck so watch for that and be sure to remove. I adored them, my husband not much of a fan. He thought they would be better with graham crackers instead of saltines. My kids and grandkids thought they were awesome.

This is easy to make and very delicious. Suggestion: put parchment paper or aluminum foil in the pan first to make it easier to remove from the pan and cut.

This was great. I had my doubts when I first poured the toffee on the crackers but it turned out okAalso I used ungreased parchment paper and it came up very easy. Next time I'm trying it with Earthbalence rather than butter. I have lots of friends who are vegan and I think this will translate to vegan easily .

It's simple and quick. I personally love real toffee so this does compare in my book. If you want something salty and sweet it's pretty decent. One note is I would add more chocolate than it calls for.

Oh. My. Gosh. I couldn't be happier with how this turned out. The flavor is out of this world! Followed advice of boiling a solid 3 minutes without stirring, and using foiled sprayed with Pam. I live in Denver and you never know how the altitude is going to mess with a recipe. HA! Taking this first batch to Christmas Eve dinner at the in-laws tomorrow night. Will probably make another batch in the morning using crushed candy canes on top. I've always wanted to try this recipe, and I'm so glad I did. It's even easier than it looks. Thanks!

My husband asked me to make another batch for Christmas.  I took this originally to a Christmas party, and it was the very first treat to be eaten very quickly.  It is an easy recipe and works every time I've made it.

Tasted great, subbed the crackers with pretzels be very careful with the sugar, mine burned in the oven. I was able to salvage some parts of the batch. I lined a pan with foil and sprayed it with cooking oil. One major problem I had was the butter was still separated from the sugar once it came out the oven. I guess I didn't mix it well enough in the pot, will try again and see how it turns out.

These are absolutely fantastic and so easy to make.  To the person who said they must've done something wrong, that it tasted like a cracker must have left out an essential ingredient. Perhaps the brown sugar? My family is raving over these, and I plan on giving them out as gifts. I will be making this cookie ever holiday season.

I realized I was out of crackers while the syrup was boiling, so I used pretzels. Wow. They disappeared  quickly but I really struggle with getting a nice spread of chocolate. It always breaks or won't spread.

At my house it's called christmas crack. I use milk chocolate chips. We have tried many combinations. I've made it with ritz, saltines, club, and graham crackers. My family loves toffee bits, m&m's, almonds, pecans, butter finger bits, and just plain. It never lasts long!!!

THIS STUFF IF SO EASY AND DELISH-
however]per another recipe blog i didn't use pecans - i added 6 tablespoons melted creamy PB between the toffee and chocolate layers. topped with christmas colored spinklies and mini m&ms and peanut butter m&ms chopped in the food processor (dont do m&ms in the food processor they are not pretty) otherwise it tasted great!
and next time i would add a lil more PB to give it just a tad more PB flavor and maybe use reeses pieces over m&ms or add chopped peanuts. i recommend this cookie/candy, its different than your average cookie and no one would ever guess the base is saltine crackers!.. i wonder how a ritz would taste?

Holy smokes are these delicious!! My first batch I forgot to spray the foil and was nervous, but the foil came off without much problem. The second batch I put a small amount of olive oil on the foil and it was perfect. Everything in me wanted to stir the toffee during the 3 minute boil but I resisted. Unlike others reviews, mine were a tiny bit "chewy" so I was able to use a pizza cutter to cut them into even squares. So so so DELICIOUS!

I have made these before and the family LOVED it! This time I made two batches and both times the chocolate would not melt. The first batch had a combination of semi-sweet regular chips and mini-chips. The second batch was with mini-chips only. Any thoughts? Thanks! :)

Next time I will either spray the pan or spray the foil because it stuck to the foil I used.  It was very rich, but delicious!  I added some flaked coconut on top.  YUM!

Super easy, versital, and good. 
The only thing to add is wrapping the pan in aluminum foil makes it much easier to break and take out of the pan.

I make this every year for my family at Christmas and it is always requested when I ask them what they want me to bake that year. In my house its referred to as "cracker crack". I haven't added any nuts to the top before since one of my kids doesn't like nuts but I may make two batches one with nuts and one without. Love this recipe!

These are so easy and so good! A few really important notes.  LINE YOU PAN WITH  GREASED  TIN FOIL AND NO NOT STIR THE BROWN SUGAR AND BUTTER. I made 2 batches I used Christmas M&Ms instead of nuts on one and Coconut on the other. I also used ritz crackers rather than saltine!

I liked this recipe.  I used milk chocolate chips.  Next time I'd use semisweet I thought it was too sweet with the milk chocolate.  Just my preference.   I also felt that it was too buttery.  Next time I'd do as another reviewer said and I'd crumble more crackers over the first row to soak up some of the sauce.

Awesome!  Everyone loves it.  To the comments about noticing the soda cracker, I don't think you should recognize any cracker in it at all, when I poured the Sugar/Butter in, the crackers floated up slightly, so there is a thin layer of toffee on bottom.

The taste is like a Skor bar.  It is important to have the sugar and butter basically boil for several minutes as the instructions state.  Fro the failed reviews, I have to assume this was not done properly, as it's the only step that could go wrong.

Thanks!

I try to do every recipe once, as it's written but for this one, I only had light (not dark) brown sugar in the pantry. I read thru the Most Helpful and tried to incorporate. For the butter/sugar mix, I kept it a little above medium because I didn't want it to burn. My oil thermometer only reached 200-225 degrees. I did let it boil/bubble the last few minutes. 

I lined a 11"x17" with foil and spread out the saltines. I could only go 5 wide, with some spaces in between. I can't remember how many crackers long (maybe 9 rows). I tried to pour the butter/sugar concoction onto each cracker but I got concerned when many crackers had dry spots. After the oven for 5-6 mins, I had a tray of soaking crackers. After sprinkling chips everywhere, spreading the chocolate was an exercise in futility. Crackers moved on top of other crackers. I threw it back in the warm oven to get some more melt on the chips. Either way (semi-melted or melted) spreading chocolate wasn't easy until the toffee mix started holding the crackers to the foil, like glue.

Takeaways you may consider (some suggested by others):
- I'm going to try a pan that snuggly fits crackers flat, without much space between.
- I now understand the idea of letting the pan cool before applying chocolate. My hope is that this sets up the toffee ON top of the crackers. Maybe the chocolate chips can be melted in a double boiler and spread easily over the cooler crackers.

Excellent! I tried a small batch, scaling it down to 18 servings and then reducing it even further with a little less than 1 stick of butter, and a little less brown sugar. This worked for the saltines that I placed in a foil-lined and sprayed with cooking spray 8x8 pan. I used about 1/4 sleeve of saltines and just filled in the sides with pieces. I used milk chocolate pieces and walnuts. Since it wasn't hardening as quickly as I wanted to (anxious to try!), I placed some in the fridge to harden quicker and it worked great. Now that I know the small batch came out great, I would not hesitate to make a large batch, with the holidays in mind.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Family loves these.  I'm not much for the chocolate, (I know).  I made a batch with the same cooked mixture and added lots of cinnamon.  Put pecans on top.  No chocolate.   A great  Christmas treat.

I have made this with both saltines and graham crackers. Delicious both ways! I have also added a teaspoon of vanilla just before pouring it over the crackers. Light or dark brown sugar works as well. I use whatever nuts I have on hand, cashews are particularly good!

I did make a few changes...I used light brown sugar...it was all I had and instead of saltines which I found I couldn't get here in Israel during Passover I decided to use Matza...they turned out great....

When you pour the toffee on don't walk to far from the oven as soon as it is done it starts to burn.

I made this per the directions and it was good. It is very, very sweet. I was looking for an easy dessert to bring to a lunch and this was easy to make with ingredients readily available in my cupboard. I would like to try to add some candied ginger on top next time to at some more contrasting flavor.

Unfortunately, this was a fail for me! As I poured the sugar mixture on top of the crackers, they started floating.  I thought they'd cook after but they didn't.  Messy too.  I used Skor bits instead of nuts.

Oh my gosh! It's a keeper! Didn't change a thing. I love the semi sweet chocolate with it. Never even thought about stirring the brown sugar mixture.love the salty sweet taste. Put it in the fridge to cool and then broke up the pieces and I am keeping it in the fridge in Tupperware. I used foil on the cookie sheet. I had to fold up the edges because my cookie sheet is flat. This is really good. Makes a lot.

These are great!  I took a double batch to my office and it was gone in less than a day!  I used parchment paper to line a jelly roll pan and they came out perfectly.  I agree....don't stir the sugar and butter while it is cooking and MAKE SURE it actually boils for the full three minutes.

SO YUMMY!!  This was so easy to make, definitely will become a staple in our house. Couldn't even tell it was saltine crackers. Used almonds in lieu of pecans,  family preference. Thanks for a great and easy recipe!!

Excellent snack, great if you want that sweet and salty taste.  I couldn't find a pan that was 11x17 so I used a pan that was 10x24 and it worked quite well.  Winner winner!

Super easy, inexpensive and delicious! Rich in flavor so a little bit goes a long way.  Cover pan in foil then spray with non-stick spray.  Place Saltines on pan salt-side down.  Do not stir the butter/sugar mix while it boils for three minutes. I baked at 375 for 5 minutes.  Good topped with nuts (pecans, walnuts, almonds, etc), craisins, pretzels, ... be adventurous!  After it cooled, I placed in refrigerator before cutting (being in Florida, it's too warm in the house for the chocolate to set up quickly).  I bet this would be terrific as a topping on ice cream too!

These are unreal... so delicious! And super easy to make. I deducted a star because I had to go to the comments in order to learn NOT to stir the toffee mixture while it boils! Kinda important info to leave out... the recipe also doesn't specify if the butter should be salted or unsalted. I used salted, figuring more salt would help counteract the sugar. I considered making with graham crackers, but so glad I stuck to saltines. I can't imagine how grossly sweet they would have been otherwise! Stick with saltines and they will be perfect!

AWESOME hard to keep around!!!
I few things.. 
1st time I used Dark Brown sugar.. (Amazing) toffee was a little soft (yummy)
2nd time I used Light Brown sugar (Amazing) toffee was hard and crunchy (yummy)
guess it's up to you... I liked both!
Also... I've never put the nuts on top I imagine it's wonderful but we have too many people with allergies and just so you know... the nuts are not needed for this to be YUMMY!!!!

I made this just as is and it turned out great and very tasty. I did put it in the freezer for about 45 minutes at the end to have it set faster. I will be taking this in to work for a holiday treat and will definitely be making this again.

I've made this recipe - or one like it - for many years, and it's always a hit. However, I had never used saltines - my old recipe called for graham crackers. The saltines version seems to have a lighter crisp, and I love the touch of salt!! I had a box of wheat saltines in my pantry, so I used that, and it was equally as good. I loved another reviewer's idea of using cereal. I'm going to try that next. Love the variety of suggestions!

I won't give it five stars simply because the recipe doesn't say what sized pan to use, or that can t be a very shallow pan, and not to cook on high! Also, if you buy " chopped" pecans, make sure you chop them smaller before you sprinkle them on the chocolate.
I' m sure it' s a good recipe if the sugar isn' t burned.

I made three batches of these cookies. The first batch was not good (completely my fault). The second batch was really good and the third batch was just so-so. I decided to read the reviews and make adjustments. DO NOT STIR the brown sugar and butter while it's boiling! I made a batch with almonds on top and one with Toffee bits...giving them to co-workers for the Holidays.

I had made these a couple of times. Sometimes they come out amazing and sometimes not. I am not sure why? The first time they were perfect and the next time I made them the toffee had crystalized (gritty). I have made the again with the same unpredictable results. I don't know if the oven was too hot or it something to do with humidity. If someone would have a suggestion I would love the advise. When the toffee comes out right it is really good would make a great dish for a party or gift but for me its a  shoot 50/50 . but as one other review said it is quite costly when it is not coming out right.  I would recommend trying it.

This is not only a very easy recipe that includes ingredients that you probably already have in the pantry.  This is also a great dessert to make at the last minute (if your forgot about making something).  I definitely recommend covering your cookie sheet (jelly pan) with foil and spray.  It will make cleanup a snap.  After I spread the chocolate and put on some nuts, I pat the nuts lightly so that it sticks and I put the pan in the refrigerator or freezer for 15 mins or so to cool so I can break it up.  I usually do this but more so if it's a last minute dessert or gift.  Everyone will freak out over how great it tastes and you'll freak out  over how easy it is to make.

The next time I make these I will put parchment paper down first. They all stuck to the bottom. They taste okay, but won't be sharing with friends.

These are great! 
My first batch turned out gross. They were gooey, the butter/sugar mixture didn't spread out enough to cover the crackers, and they didn't harden. Like some of the negative reviews said, it looked and tasted like a cracker with some candy and chocolate on it. (The cracker was still white and totally visible  on the bottom)

 After reading the reviews , I realized the problem- I had stirred the sugar and butter while it was boiling. I tried again,  this time only stirring the mixture until the butter was melted and it began to boil. I then let it sit for the three minutes without touching it. (I was nervous about this, as my gas burners are hot and burn EVERYTHING if it's not stirred constantly. I did turn the heat down lower than suggested, to right at medium). It worked great. The toffee spread out and covered the crackers pretty easily when I poured, and then while baking it bubbled and covered the rest. 

I took off one star because the recipe didn't note that you shouldn't stir the mixture while it boils. 

Here are the very minor changes I made: 
after the 6 minutes, I turned the oven off, took the pan out, sprinkled the chips on, and then placed it back in the oven for a minute. Then took it out and spread the chocolate easily. I sprinkled with Christmas sprinkles, as I didn't want nuts. 

I baked this on a cookie sheet lined with foil (and sprayed). I made sure the foil made a "wall" around the edges so the liquid wouldn't boil over.

Love this easy recipe! Very simple and crazy addictive.  I added crushed peppermint candy canes to one half and crushed Heath bar to the other and red and green sprinkles since these are for a holiday party.  It is extremely customizable for toppings. Have fun!

Made it for a cookie exchange and it was SUPER S SIMPLE! I also sprinkled with sea salt to give it some pop and tone down the sweetness. HIGHLY RECOMMEND TRYING IT!!! I did a quad batch... And I am trying not to eat both pans before the party! Lol. I did use commercial baking sheets, which moved things along. Now I'm just waiting for my chocolate to set.  Yay!

This has been a huge hit every time I make it. People are amazed to learn that it is made with Saltines. This year I have added it to my list of baking for our church food baskets.

I used Graham crackers instead of saltines. I used m.choc. chips and toasted almonds. I've used coconut, pretzels butterscotch chips, potato chips. Use what your family likes. It's fun to experiment. Graham crackers, marshmallows, choc. chips, you have a smores. Try  junior mints, just have fun.??

I am now a PRO at making this, it is so easy that it is, well, CRAZY easy. One suggestion I have is to use an old cookie sheet, one that is well seasoned and NOT non-stick.  Don't use foil!  Just make sure that you let cool enough on the counter to promptly refrigerate, covered with wax or parchment paper for at least a day.  Then they are a breeze to score and snap right out of the pan.  These freeze very well when separated by layers of parchment paper and put in plastic container.  OH!  and DO stir the butter/sugar mixture just until it begins to bubble, then let it go for 3 minutes, as exactly as possible.

We've made this for nearly 40 years...kind of sorry our little secret recipe is getting noticed.  It has been a must at Christmas time.  My family wouldn't have it any other way.
A few failed batches from time to time (but even those get gobbled up)  Certainly a recipe worth repeating.

Delicious!!! So addicting I could eat the entire batch! I make these all the time but I use graham crackers instead of saltines. I store them in the refrigerator for up to 3 weeks lined with wax paper. A must try.

This turned out awesome.  I used Premium saltines with unsalted tops.  I stirred the butter and the brown sugar.  I put the crackers right in the pan, no liner, no grease.  I let it cool for a half hour on the stove top then put it in the refrigerator for an hour.  I used a butter knife and broke it out of the pan in chunks like brittle.  A little dish soap and hot water and it cleaned right up.....afterall it is mostly butter and sugar.  Divine!

Made as directed. Put in fridge to cool quicker. Living in Texas, being August, I will store in fridge to eliminate softening chocolate. These are delicious! Thank you for sharing.

YUM! Made per recipe, don't stir mixture til right before pouring, I used 1 3/4 c semi sweet and 1/4 chocolate chip toffee cuz I had it. Remove from pan (use foil and spray) quickly or it will harden on it and difficult to remove.

We call this Crack!  One piece and you are addicted! :-)
I prefer club crackers, more butter taste! We also switch up the toppings, using semi sweet, or dark chocolate, white chocolate, or even butterscotch chips...really anything that will melt and can be spread will work!  Also any nut or coconut, or toffee crushed will work.  The possibilities are endless!  Made for candy bar at wedding,  using colored coconut and white chocolate and sprinkles to match wedding colors!  I may need an intervention! :-) BE SURE TO USE COOKIE PAN WITH SIDES, OR YOU WILL HAVE TO REPLACE THE OVEN! Lol!

We call these "Christmas Crack" because I make them every Christmas, and they are HIGHLY addictive. I've done variations with different blends of chocolates, nuts, even crushed peppermint--all of them are good! No need to tweak this recipe, if you follow the timing as written, you will get a good result.

I didn't have nuts or chocolate chips, but I wanted to use up some chocolate 'almond bark' - they were great! I lined my pan with foil (next time I will spray with oil since they were hard to release from foil). I think that has to do with amount of time I boiled the sugar and butter - I'll try another batch and report back.  I simply spread the chocolate on top and sprinkled lightly with kosher salt.  Took them to work - staff loved them, called them "CRACK"-ers since they are so addictive.  This is SO easy.

Excellent.  Smaller batch with 9x13 and 3/4 cup of brown sugar and butter is great advice. Toasted then chopped raw almonds.  Pretty darn tasty.

ive made this recipe several times but this time I used foil which I sprayed with Pam to make it easier to remove from the pan.  Instead of chocolate I used Reese's peanut butter chips, since I'm addicted to peanut butter I'm sure this will be my favorite.

I've made this before but not sure what happened this time. Had oven at 400 degrees & in for 6 minutes but the bottoms burned. Not sure if it was the dark pan I used or just shouldn't have been in for 6 min.? Next time around I'm using different pan & only keeping in for 4-5 minutes.

These were just ok, according to my "raters".  They are pretty easy to make, but you must be spot on with your cook time in order to achieve the proper end result.  My mixture started hardening before I could even get it spread on the entire sheet of crackers.  Thank you for sharing this recipe, Tracy!

I made these without the nuts and everyone was asking for more! Highly addictive :) Light brown sugar works just as well. Easy clean up too when you line the pan with foiland spray with non stick baking spray.

Toffee to cracker ratio was way off (too much toffee).  I ended up using 1 1/2 sleeves of crackers (4 oz = 1 sleeve), and still should have used more.  I will try 1 stick of butter and 1/2 cup brown sugar with 1 1/2 sleeves of crackers next time.  Flavor was good, recipe was very easy to make, it just needs some adjusting.

Really good base recipe. For me and my family, they were TOO sweet and dense. The cracker crunch did come through as much as I had hoped it would. The flavor is REALLY good but they are too heavy of a dessert as is. If I did make this again, I would half the brown sugar topping because as it is, in my opinion, it is too much. Easy recipe and few ingredients make it a desirable recipe.

Salty, sweet and chocolate.  Always a great combo. I will use less butter and brown sugar next time.  One suggests 3/4 each.  They are soft on the bottom but still good. Or next use bigger pan and open another sleeve of crackers. I had a 9x13 cookie sheet.  And crushed the extra crackers up on top.

I followed the recipe exactly being sure to let the dark brown sugar and butter boil untouched once mixed. I waited the 3 min, poured over crackers, popped into preheated oven for 6 min and finished up with choc chips and chopped pecans. WOW these were great! And addictive so beware lol.

FABULOUS AND OH SO EASY? I now use gram cracker instead of saltines as I prefer the taste. I also use light brown sugar as the recipe I first say had this listed. Be sure to bowl the butter and sugar until thick. I only bake 3-4 minutes or until the whole thing is bubbling. I love to add chopped pecans (pushing them into the chocolate slightly) This makes a great little gift as they store well. (holiday idea)  D lish!

I think this recipe can work, but it needs instructional revisions. As other reviewers have mentioned, you do need to let the sugar-butter mixture boil for at *least* three minutes to totally dissolve the sugar and combine the ingredients. Otherwise, your end result will be crystallized and chewy. Using greased aluminum foil is also really important. Finally, I found it crucial to completely line whatever pan you're using with the crackers. I tried to do a rectangular shape of crackers that was smaller than my actual pan; as a result, when I poured the hot toffee, it just shifted all of the crackers all over the place and looked terrible. I scrapped my batch, but I see it working well with a smaller pan completely lined with crackers, and with a well-cooked sugar mixture.

Unbelievably good.. Who would have thought it with a saltine crust?  Definitely use a jelly roll pan with sides as the butter/sugar sauce continues to bubble in the oven. I used foil to line the pan but will use parchment next time as the foil tore slightly as they were removed.  Great for holiday gifts.

I've made this recipe twice now. My sister made this years ago and I had forgotten it existed. Glad I came across the recipe. I topped it with some toffee chips along with the nuts in the final step for extra crunch and toffee. I'm leaving some for the mailman in the morning for Christmas!

Very Very Good!! A little too much chocolate for me, but other than that, wonderful. I've also tried this recipe using graham crackers and just then pecan. Also WONDERFUL!!!!

REDICULOUS! AND SO MUCH FUN! Teen daughter calls this "CRACK-ers" it is sooo addictive!
When I saw this I had to try it- I love toffee and am now terrified for my bikini now that I know how delicious and simple this toffee treat is to make! I made 2 batches on (2) 11x15 jelly roll pans allowing for more crackers(left no spaces) but didn't increase the other ingredients so the toffee layer may not have been as thick as if I had used a smaller sheet/fewer crackers- but plenty plenty to coat everything nicely. I made one batch with a good dark chocolate and one with regular ol nestle semi sweet chocolate chips- the dark chocolate was by far my favorite. Wont use the semi sweet again- as it was a bit too "waxy" in the finished product and I didn't love the flavor nearly as much. Think it would be really fab with milk chocolate too.  Make sure you put into a HOT oven to keep the sugar cooking to a golden toffee-you don't want the sugar to cool. After cooling thoroughly - I covered both sheet pans and put in the fridge overnight. Just finished breaking/chopping it all up- very easy when cold. If you're making this for gifts I recommend doing this when no one is around or you have nothing left!! (sill pat on sheet made it super easy to lift off AND to collect and store all the broken bits for ice cream later). I just finished putting into gift boxes- I have to get this out of the house ASAP or it will never make it! :-) I'm happy to have found this silly delicious recipe- thank you!

This stuff should come with a warning label! It is highly addictive and incredibly delicious! It looks like you worked on it for hours but it's very easy to make. My husband can't keep his hand out of the jar where it's being stored! This is a keeper.

Wow! I couldn't imagine saltine crackers making something that tastes this good! The bonus is that it is an inexpensive food gift you can give for the holidays. (I think I would prefer milk chocolate chips on this)

Super easy and super delicious!  I followed all of the suggestions from the other reviewers ... bring the butter/brown sugar to a boil and then allow to boil for 3 minutes without stirring, line the pan with foil (I used non-stick foil) and lightly spray with cooking spray, and put the pan back in the oven to melt the chocolate.  The hardest part was resisting the temptation to stir the toffee mix!!  I let the pan cool down for over an hour and then placed the pan in the refrigerator.  Cutting the bars into uneven pieces was easy and clean up was a snap.

I am bringing this cookie to work for a cookie exchange tomorrow ... I am sure they will be a hit with my co-workers!  Next time I will try the crushed candy cane topping!

I have to review this recipe again!  I wish I could give it 20 stars!!  I made this last night for a luncheon at work today.  I made 2 batches of it.  This treat was the ONLY one that was completely GONE by the end of the luncheon!!  People were asking me left and right for the recipe.  Be prepared if you take this somewhere.....bring several copies of the recipe with you!!  Thank you for this incredibly tasty treat!!  UPDATE:  It's now almost 2 years since I submitted my last review. I am asked ALL the time to bring this deliciousness to any luncheon/potluck I go to.  I am making it again tonight because it was requested for a work luncheon tomorrow.  Thanks again for this incredible recipe.

Ridiculously easy and pretty fast. I didn't line my cookie sheet as so many others have suggested -- I'm not sure why (maybe all the butter?), but I didn't have any problems with sticking. I did let them cool at room temperature for maybe an hour or so, and then put it in the fridge for a while -- made it much easier to break up and remove from the pan. I kind of smashed it with the back of a wooden spoon to make a crack, and then just broke into random pieces with my fingers. Gobbled up by all!

I just made these as I had ingredients on hand. Taste wonderful...I did not line the pan with foil and will do so next time. Also my chocolate chips did not melt...oven not hot enough or I did not leave in long enough. Think I panic when I saw the spill over in the oven. Thought I melt chocolate in double boiler and pour over then allow to cool. The brown sugar and butter is a memory of the Sees suckers we use to get in Cal. yum O! Easy and will do again.

I made the recipe as directed but did use more chocolate and nuts than what was recommended.
Used a non-stick pan and hadn't any problem with sticking whatsoever as I didn't line the pan or spray it with anything.
Turned out great, but if I did have one small issue, it was that some of the cracker/toffee separated from the chocolate when cutting.  Not enough to cause a problem, but would have preferred it not.
I did cool it entirely at room temp and did not put it in the refrigerator to cool.  It was completely cooled when I cut the pieces.
I loved it and my friends will be getting some to sample.

I did try this recipe and like every recipe, you have to make it once to learn what you did right or wrong.  I made these a second time using graham crackers instead of saltines and make just a little more of the butter and brown sugar mixture and those two additions really made it into a five star recipe.  I love the ease of this recipe - it is a brilliant concept and this recipe is a keeper.

I knew about this recipe from a friend, and looked it up on all recipes to find the ingredients. This is a really easy cookie to make, and it is always a 100% hit!
I don't know who came up with the idea of cooking them at 400°, I tried this recipe (thank you for the ingredients) but I found that cooking them in my oven at 400° burned them to a crisp. That batch was toast.
The second batch I made with this identical recipe but cooking them at 350° came out perfect. Perhaps it's my pans, perhaps not.
As an little joyous addition, I placed about 12 candy canes into a heavy duty Ziploc bag and crushed them up, and instead of nuts I sprinkled the candy dust on top! They were wonderful as a little Christmas treat that I took to a party, and they were a hit! 
One of my all-time favorite recipes!

Has anybody from high altitudes made these with success? I followed the recipe exactly with timing the boil and everything and still the toffee was grainy leading me to believe this needs to be adjusted for high altitudes (I am over 6500 feet).

The directions should say to line the pan with parchment paper, waxed paper or foil or to grease the pan - something.  I didn't read the reviews until now as I had had them before made by a friend of a friend so I went on blind faith.  Needless to say the entire pan, pan and all, went into the trash.  Common sense should have told me to line the pan because of the caramel.  Guess I'm not thinking too clearly yet as I just had surgery a few days ago.  Maybe I'll try them again when I'm in a clearer state of mind because I know they're good, therefore I'll give them the 5 stars.  Next time I'll try lining the pan with parchment paper.

The key is to line the jelly roll pan with foil. After the last step of adding the nuts (push them down into the warm chocolate a bit) put the pan in the freezer for a few hours. Lift the whole sheet out of the pan. The foil will easily peel off and start breaking into chunks. I use a large knife to chop it up.I have been making this treat for 25 years and was so surprised to see the recipe show up here. It is fast and easy and always the most popular sweet at the party.

This recipe is similar to one given me by a friend. She uses Graham Wafers instead of Saltines.  I prefer Graham Wafers/Crackers - excellent option!

Easy & Delish! Used baking sheet covered with foil & my Silpat pad, clean up easy. Did make a few changes. Have a similar recipe using matzo. The saltines I had were in smaller pkgs, wasn't sure how much 4oz were so I just covered the entire sheet with them,  added 1t. vanilla & pinch of sea salt once off stove, only needed 1 lg cup chips, after they melted & spread, sprinkled roasted walnut pcs & sea salt over the top. If you like sweet & salty this is amazing. This is going to be part of my Holiday Gifts.

This was yummy. I do recommend putting it in the fridge to cool down or freezer for a quick cool down. I lined my pan with the foil- parchment paper. And it came off nice and easy.

Tasted great the only thing I suggest if you decide to double layer, make sure you also add a bit of chocolate between the layers as the sugar and butter combo doesn't stick the crackers together and everything just flakes apart. It would have been just fine with one layer I thought it would make it a bit more of a "dessert bar" but one layer is enough. Very tasty none the less =)

Let me be fair.  I've tried this recipe before word for word and the squares came out just right and very tasty.  The original recipe gets a 5.  Now my tweaked recipe to make this a dairy allergy friendly dessert totally backfired.  You absolutely have to use real butter for this to work.  So for adaptability...the recipe sunk.  Not all recipes can be changed. :(

Recipe is great, but use caution AND use a deep dish sheet pan!! The mixture bubbled over and creat one hot mess!
Otherwise, awesome.

I used unsalted crackers and unsalted butter.  I think it definitely needed some salt.  I also did not add the chopped nuts but will next time.  This is excellent.

I've seen this recipe on TV cooking shows over the years and never would make it because it just didn't make sense that this would be good. I mean saltine crackers, for real? Well I finally made it last night and I loved it, my husband loved it and my daughter loves it. It's delicious.  I did add a half tsp salt and vanilla to it and topped it with chopped salted toffee pecans that I made{I love that whole salty/sweet contrast} and wow!

AMAZING!!! I've made it twice in two days (to give as gifts not eat all up!). I used milk chocolate chips and both milk and white chocolate the following time. I left the nuts out but will try it with nuts soon.

Absolutely wonderful recipe!  Although be careful not to burn (I did first time).  I stirred frequently to prevent the sugar and butter from burning and it turned out great the 2nd time.  Thank you!

Only the crackers around the edges crisped up.  Crackers in the middle stayed soft. Prefer a toffee recipe withou crackers.

Really liked them. They did get a little too crispy around the edges where they were thinner. But the rest of them was wonderful.

I gave this recipe to my boyfriend to make due to my never ending to do list for Christmas. I was worried they wouldn't come out very pretty but to my surprise I came home and they looked perfect!! THEN once cooled, I flipped them over and saw an ooey gooey mess!!!!! I can only assume it was the fact that we used reduced fat margarine and didn't know ahead of time to not stir while boiling. I think we'll have to give it another shot. **** UPDATE*** Made again with real butter and did not stir and what a difference!! Turned out perfect. The toffee did soften the next day but I kind of like it better that way.

Awesome!  The dark brown sugar definitely makes this taste like real toffee from a candy shop.  It actually fits better in a 10 x 15" jelly roll pan.  If you line it with foil, you can bend up the ends of the foil if the saltines don't fit exactly.

I followed everything in Donna's review and additionally did not stir during the 3 minute boil and it turned out well.  I think milk chocolate chips would have elevated this to 5 stars.

This is AMAZING! I've never reviewed a recipe before (and I've been using this site regularly since 2003), but I had to comment on this one. I just made this in a marathon Christmas baking day...we've made 8 different cookies/candies today, but this is the recipe that keeps my husband and I stealing bites. We're going to have to make another batch for the neighbors--this one is ours. It was so easy--doesn't take more than 15 minutes--and the result is heavenly. Used light brown sugar instead of dark, since it's what we had on hand, and skipped the nuts--topped with extra crushed saltines instead. Fantastic recipe! This will absolutely find its way into our holiday rotation. Thanks for sharing it!

My wife and I never bake, and for good reason: we're terrible at it. I needed to come up with something to give out to my co-workers for the holidays, though, and I didn't want to spend a ton of money. This recipe caught my eye because it seemed idiot-proof enough even for me. And it was! We couldn't believe how good these were, they were a hit with my colleagues, and we're planning on making a batch to bring with us when we visit our parents over the holidays.

Great yummy addictive treat. I used Graham crackers because I didn't have saltines on hand. Worked awesome! A bit thicker of a crunch but that same awesome taste. I used a 9x13 pan lined with foil and filled bottom with Graham cracker. Then followed the rest of the recipe as stated. Original recipe is great. Also follow the advice of others and let cool at room temperature for a few hours so the chocolate binds to the cracker completely.

I love this recipe, I have always known it as crackle, but this is the same thing. I have also substituted the saltines with graham crackers, they work really well also.

I thought this was a really tasty recipe.  I made it exactly as instructed.  The only thing I would do differently is bake it one minute less.  I like how it has the nice toffee flavor, but it's lighter and crispier then traditional toffee.

YUMMMM!! These are fantastic! They're best the same day they're made, but can keep for a few days if sealed in an airtight container. That wasn't too much of a problem for us, though - we couldn't stop eating them!

So easy! I've had these before but this was my first time making them.  I covered my baking sheet (63 crackers) and the other ingredients were perfect to cover all the crackers.  The hardest part is waiting for them to cool (oh, by the way, they taste pretty good warm, too!)  Great way to use up slightly stale crackers, as they work quite well in this.  Thanks Tracy!

These are fantastic.  So easy to make and everyone begs me to bring them to parties.  Make sure you use real butter (not reduced fat). I used the reduced fat once and the carmel didn't solidify like it does with real butter.

Delicious.  5 stars for a recipe to do with kids.  The toffee part is delicious.  Made two pans one was great the other one got a little dark on the bottoms.  Not sure what happened.  *TIP* Use a pizza cutter to cut a wide strip and then break with your hands for pieces.  They look great.  Used Reynolds release and they slid right off.  Topped with chopped toasted almonds.

I made these with a tray of graham crackers too. Very good that way, with a bit more carmelly flavor than with saltines. I also used milk chocolate chips because that's what we prefer, and slivered almonds. A lovely variation.

Made this a few times and everyone loves this!  I sprayed the tinfoil before lining with saltines.  I also melted the chocolate and then spread it on the saltines and also put in the oven for a few minutes.

This was so easy and they turned out amazing. Everyone raved about them. The only thing that I was unsure about what was temp to boil the butter/sugar at. I ended up boiling it at med-high. I mixed the butter and sugar constantly as it heated up and then once it started boiling I stopped stirring all together and timed it for three minutes, then poured it on the crackers. While the pan was baking I pre-melted a milk chocolate dairymilk bar and some semisweet chocolate chips together. When the crackers came out of the oven, I waited 5 minutes and then poured the melted chocolate over the top and popped in in the fridge for a couple hours. It set perfectly and was delicious. I used parchment paper with no additional greasing and had no problems with sticking. We store it in airtight containers in the fridge. So easy and SO good. You won't believe it!

This stuff is phenomenal!  If you like toffee this is the recipe for you.  The crackers may seem odd but you don't taste the cracker at all, it's just a vessel to keep everything together nice and neat.  I'm ALWAYS asked to make this around the holidays. I make some batches without nuts and some with a sprinkling of chopped and toasted pecans.

I am giving this 5 stars for Taste but would give it 4 stars for Directions.  After I made this I saw people saying to NOT STIR during the 3 minute boil.  I wish I had known!  The result was soft toffee.  I did use foil in my baking pan for easy removal and clean up.  Thanks for the tips reviewers!! I'll make these again for sure!

There is nothing about these that doesn't satisfy.  I've also done several of the reviewers' recommendations.  This last batch, I cracked up some Dove Milk Chocolate and used that along with the chips.  YUM!

Just okay for me.  I wish I would of used Milk Chocolate instead of semi-sweet.  But even then, I just don't think this would of done it for me.  My husband managed to eat a little more of it, but also said it was just ok.

these are to die for. i did not use chocolate chips but used butterscotch and won't change that, it was perfect. I did not use foil and it was fine b/c it produced toffee on the back of each cracker as well. i call this CRACK b/c i can't stop eating it. it was a hit at a xmas party i brought it to.

These were super easy to make but way too sweet for my liking.  I'm not a fan of semisweet chocolate so next time I will use milk chocolate.

Very different but good. I didn't use the foil but sprayed my pan with Pam. I also used light brown sugar since that's all I had on hand. Also lightly dusted the top with sea salt as another reviewer mentioned. Next time I will top with crushed pretzels!

I really wish I would have read the reviews before making this - I was worried about the butter and brown sugar burning so I stirred it constantly for the eintire 3 minutes using a wisk and the "toffee" turned out like caramel. Still has a good flavor and I will most likely try it again without stirring, but I wasted my time and ingredients on this round - argh!

Tastes like a Skor chocolate bar! Delicious combination of caramel,chocolate and the saltiness of the crackers. I took the advise of others and sprayed the foil lined pan with cooking spray.

Really good! Have a similar recipe that differs slightly. Good tip is to put some aluminum foil down on the baking sheet before the crackers. Easy clean up.

A friend of mine raved about these so I had to try them myself.  They are delicious - a Heath bar cookie!  Easy, inexpensive, quick and irresistible.  I followed the recipe exactly and had no problems at all.  I did pop them in the fridge to help with the cooling process.  Everyone who has tasted them loves them.

This recipe was awsome!  I tried it the way it was written and it was great.  The second time I did it I let the sugar mixture cook until it was in its hard stage and it came out like brittle.  I love it. You and your family will enjoy it and the ease in which it is made!

my guests loved this, i thought it was ok.  i soaked all the crackers and had more sauce so i just poured it all on and i dont think that was the right decision.  the crackers on the edge where there was extra sauce wouldnt break apart and got thrown.  some crackers were chewy too.  i didnt near enough chocolate chips i realized as i was making them, so i had to add the white chocolate chips and they were still very good.  i think next time i will use more crackers, less sauce, and half chocolate chips and half white chocolate chips.

Very good, very easy even for someone like me who is afraid to boil sticky stuff on the stove.  Tip:  Use parchment paper instead of foil and it is no problem getting anything off the pan.  Parchment paper is the best for baking--find next to the foil in the grocery aisle.

I needed a sweet treat to take to a gathering and didn't have much time to make anything.  This was the solution since it doesn't take long and is made with things that are usually around.  I did have some problems breaking it apart and wound up with a lot of useless little pieces, but what I could use tasted great.  You should probably press the nuts into the chocolate too, because a lot of mine came off as I was breaking it apart.

Awesome.  I've made these 15-20 times by now.  I just made two batches back to back and b/c butter is so high, I tried someone's suggestion to cut the toffee recipe back to 3/4 c. each of butter and sugar.  The result was still a huge hit.  These was just enough toffee to cover one sleeve of saltines.  I'll make that change from now on.

This recipe was simple, took no time at all, and turns out a very tasty candy. I did use a butter blend (with Omega-3 oils), light brown sugar, dark chocolate (has antioxidants), and toasted almonds(also good for you), and it turned out great. But that just shows the flexibility of this recipe. I also took the advice of others to cover pan with foil, then spray. This recipe is a definite keeper.

This is the best. I used milk chocolate chips and chopped almonds. It smelled so good baking. I did use a regular cookie sheet with sides, and I lined it with foil and sprayed that w/ cooking spray. 
These tastes so good and so simple to make.

These were really good and easy to make. I put them in the fridge so they would harden up faster and they were crunchy at first, but then they softened up a bit. A little messy and greasy but still good.

Easy peasy!! And, delicious!! I make this at Christmas for gifts... always goes over great! And, people have a hard time believing it all starts with saltines! :-)  I often sprinkle the top with sliced almonds.

Really, really nice.  I couldn't imagine using a cup of butter for that many saltines so I used 1C brown sugar and 1/2C butter.  Don't do that!  It seemed like there wasn't enough liquid to cover both sides of the crackers (assuming that it somehow seeps down through when you pour it on) so next time, I will definitely use the full cup.  My boyfriend says that it tastes like almond roca - which I've read in other reviews.  I think it tastes great - and it was so simple!

I made this for part of my Christmas cookie tray and it was a huge hit.  The only substitution I made was to used some crushed sliced almonds instead of the pecans.  My sister-in-law and I liked we so much that we had to make a second batch before she left to take home with her.  I was so simple and the taste is terrific!!  I will be making this frequently.

This is an excellent recipe.  I've been making it for years, only I leave off the nuts.  It was a big hit with my co-workers when I took some holiday treats in to work.

These are wonderful! The brown sugar/butter combo seeps through the holes in the saltines and forms a perfect toffee bottom. The saltiness of the saltines makes these extra yummy. I used toasted almonds.

Awesome! Everyone loves these. I never add the nuts - don't need them. Have used a variety of chips but a word to the wise: you may want to avoid white chocolate chips.  They taste good but don't melt properly and you end up with little white bits on top.

Oh boy is this sinful! We call it "Christmas Crack" around here. Cause one you start eating it, you can't stop. Definitely a holiday favorite! I leave the nuts out because I don't really like them, but doesn't make much difference...it's still GOOD STUFF!

Yum!  Ok, well used 1 cup of chopped pecans and 1/2 cup of semi-sweet chips.  I would have used 2 cups milk chocolate chips but I didn't have any just the semi-sweet.  Anyway, delicious! and very easy!

Holy Cow... Delicious!!  It tastes exactly like Almond Roca.  I'm in love.  A little hint.. if you're not thinking, like I wasn't... You'll want to put these in a jelly roll when baking.  Using a cookie sheet allows the toffee to boil over the edge and you get to clean your oven!  

YUM YUM!!!

This recipe was great! Totally affordable and really easy - not to mention absolutely delicious.

I am experimenting with different recipes to be included in 3 sweets that we'll give away as gifts this year. And this is definitely a winner.

I had to add an extra 1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of sugar though, because the mixture wasn't enough to cover all my saltines. Oh, and I crushed the saltines to make it less obvious. 

My fiance has started crumbling the toffee over the french vanilla ice cream we have left over from T-day pumpkin pie too and it's working out a little to well!

Thanks for the recipe!

I had high hopes for this recipe...but when my batch came out of the oven, I was very disappointed. My wax paper stuck to it so badly I was only able to get a small piece off to sample the taste. It was very yummy, but I couldn't get the waxed paper off! I greased it too, and I don't know what I did wrong. I will try again with foil as suggested.

Excellent!  I didn't have a jelly roll pan so I used a 9x13 pan and modified as follows: 26 saltines (two broken in half to fill gaps), 1.5 sticks of butter (12 T), 3/4 C light brown sugar (didn't have dark), 1/2 C chocolate chips, and ground almonds on top (24 whole almonds total).  I took this to work and everyone loved it.  Thank you so much!

These cookies are amazing!  I absolutely LOVE toffee, and have never thought about making it myself until I came across this recipe.  I'm glad I read several reviews before making it though.  I lined a jelly roll pan with foil (2 pieces folded together) and sprayed it with non-stick cooking spray and spread the crackers all across the pan.  I let the caramel boil for 3 full minutes (Thanks to the other reviewers who specified when to start the timer!)  I baked them for 5 minutes and sprinkled the choc. chips on top pretty quickly after they came out of the oven.  The chocolate spread really nicely and they are absolutely delicious!  They haven't even cooled completely yet, but I just couldn't resist pulling off a couple of the corners and eating them.  Yum!  A keeper for sure:)

These are always a hugely addictive hit. I use multigrain or whole wheat crackers rather than saltines to make them a little healthier and give them a slightly different taste. I've also tried variations where I mix white chocolate or peanut butter chips with the semisweet chocolate. The white chocolate look lovely--just make sure you you don't spread them too much or they'll just turn out light brown instead of marbleized.

butterscotch chips or white chocolate chips
instead.  They taste yummy!!!

Very very good!!! These went like hot cakes at a bake sale at my job.  Used the Reynolds Release foil.  Cut with a pizza cutter.  Other suggested using unsalted saltines.  I however think the salt on the saltines made these wonderful. ENJOY!

Wonderful! I lined a pan with foil and then sprayed it liberally with Pam.. I had no problems with the foil sticking. These are sooo yummy.. I used Ghirardelli bittersweet chocolate chips since the toffee is so sweet and it's perfect! Thanks for the recipe!! :)

Very tasty, but the toffee part came out a bit grainy.  I think I will cook it longer next time

These cookies were good, but not as good as I had anticipated. Like another reviewer said, they were better cold and after putting them in the fridge, I had no problem breaking them apart. I sprayed the foil with butter flavored nonstick spray, and had no problem with stickage either. I would make these again because I typically have all the ingredients, which makes it handy if you have a sweet tooth. Oh, also someone mentioned that they had a twix flavor. That's mostly why I made them, since I'm a huge twix fan. Unfortunately, I didn't think they tasted much like Twix at all.

These are excellent and easy!  The saltines sort of balance out the 'too sweet' taste of typical toffee.  The saltines do tend to go stale, so best to store in fridge and eat within a week.

I think it would be better with 1 and a half cups of chocolate chips so the chocolate isn't too overwhelming. When I tried to break them, some of them kind of shattered into crumbs. When I kept it outside the chocolate started to melt and get all gooey but when I put in the fridge they all stuck together and were impossible to separate. The only way I can think of storing them maybe would be to keep them on a cookie sheet in the fridge, spread out from one another. It's SIGNIFICANTLY tastier cold. Additionally, it's not a good idea AT ALL to  line the cookie sheet with baking foil/wax paper. I made that mistake and it was a nightmare to get all the paper off the toffee. Since I was giving the toffee away, I was terrified somebody would get a piece of paper in their toffee. Overall, probably won't make it again, especially with that much butter and that much hassle, but it is good.

i had a real problem with the toffee cookies sticking to the foil. i took other reviewer's suggestions into consideration and lined my rimmed cookie sheets with buttered foil (didn't have any cooking spray on hand)... bad decision!
over all, taste-wise, it was yum. i would, however, cut down the amount of chocolate chips to just 1 3/4 cups.

never the less, it was fun to make and is a great comfort food (or u could call it an artery-clogger too :S). Thanks for the recipe.

My new step-mom taught me this one.  It's a hit everytime one of us makes it.  People don't believe that it's made using Saltines until they look at the bottom of the cookie!  The first time I made it, I cooked it a minute too long though.  It burned around all the edges.  Be careful with the cook time!

This is my favorite variation!  It's haunting, you will want to eat the whole batch.  I use walnuts instead of pecans because I prefer them.  Also, make sure you use the dark brown sugar, it does make a difference in the flavor!

These were tasty and really easy.  Not very pretty, but the taste compensates!  I think toasting the pecans would make them all the better, so I'll try that next time.

These are fantastic to take to the office or for holiday treats, and are super-easy to make.  They taste a lot like a Skor candy bar with a light crunchy center, very yummy!

Made these for Christmas - so easy and a huge hit.  Careful though - they are addicting!  I used Reynolds release foil and it worked out great. Hardly nothing to clean up.  A friend actually made these for me earlier in the year and I couldn't get enough of them.  Definitely best when refrigerated.

this is an easy recipe that my family has made for the last few years.  Its a nice give away at the holiday season.  The one tip I have is to use disposable aluminum cookie sheets.  Once the toffee crackers has cooled in the fridge, its so easy to break out of the aluminum sheets, and they can be reused a few times.  I get mine at the dollar store!

Ooooooh my goodness these are SO GOOD!!  I used light brown sugar and didn't have any pecans.  Also sprinkled some Christmasy red and green striped white chocolate chips on top after spreading the melted semi-sweet chips.  A definite new family tradition in our house!

The nuts did not stick to the chocolate well, ended up falling off when breaking up the cookies.  The flavor was good, but the overall texture of the product was a bit odd.

YUM! I just made these for a cookie exchange and they are sooo good! I didn't change a thing! I used the reynolds easy release foil and it worked great! I've made it 3 times so far and will probably make it 2 more times before this year is out for gifts!

These were wonderful!  It has got to be delicious if I'm going to overeat on a particular sweet treat! I used parchment paper to line the pan, and lightly buttered it. There was no sticking whatsoever with this, and the treats cut very easily. In addition, I used unsalted butter, since saltines have a lot of salt (hence the name). I didn't have dark brown sugar on hand, so regular worked just fine. I made certain that the mixture came to a complete boil, and boiled for probably four minutes. Watch them in the oven and check after four minutes, just to be safe. I had no nuts, but they were still fabulous! My son liked them so much that he requested I make them for his school Christmas program, and that I make them for a church event coming up.

Simple and delicious! The chocolate was still warm and gooey but I couldn't resist sampling one anyway--wow! These are very easy to make, inexpensive and absolutely delicious. I added just a splash of vanilla to the butter/sugar mixture to give it a little extra flavor. Next time I might try using Reynolds Releas foil or spraying the foil with a non-stick spray because they seem to like to stick, but other than that, I'm not changing a thing. Thanks for sharing such a delicious recipe!

What a yummy treat! I've made a very similar recipe before, and it sort of worked.... This time, I have no complaints! I was out of saltines, so I used graham wafers. I really liked the taste of the grahams with the toffee. To make sure I cooked the toffee long enough, I cooked it for between 3½ and 4 minutes before pouring. I also baked it for 7 minutes just to be sure. I covered half the pan with chocolate (no nuts) and left half without... I think I preferred the non-chocolate version! Thanks for sharing, Tracy!

i give it 4 stars because i know it tastes yummy, but i have made 3 batches now and non have gotten hard. so i threw them away. I cant get down the boiling part i know that makes or breaks it. So  far i have times it for 3 minutes when it starts boiling just barely, then  the second time i started timing when it boiled a lot more and the third i timed it when the bubbles were large but not rapid and i timed 5 minutes instead.... i think i am going to quit and let someone else try it out.

I thought these were very unique, but I don't think my family liked them! They were polite but I caught 'the look' (as in 'what did she made now??'). I loved the ease of making these! I didn't spread the chocolate chips but left them whole.

These are really good.  VERY RICH! I notice, that the middle section of my toffee is a little "grainy".  I am sure that is something I did, and nothing at all to do with the recipe, and I followed the time EXACTLY.  BUT we are all eating them anyway, they are yummy!  I did use milk chocolate chips, Will definately make these again.

This was SO simple and quick to make! They are probably the best cookies I've ever had!! I added pecans to some, but those cookies weren't as popular as the others without the nuts.

This recipe was very simple and tasted so good.  I used dark choc chips and splenda brown suger. I also sprayed the crackers with butter flavored cooking spray, what a great suggestion.  You'll want to try these ASAP!

I would definitely use parchment paper for this recipe.  I have made these a couple of times and they cut better when I put them in the fridge for hour before cutting. The last time I made them I used them for my christmas cookie give-a-way at work and recieved so many compliments. I also thought these were so easy to make. Thanks for the posting!

OMG these are awesome!! Absolutely addictive! These didn't stand a chance at our house. I've already stocked up on butter and brown sugar so I can make a bunch of these to send with my kids this weekend on school band trips. Once again I will be the most popular mom!

Very Easy and Tastes Great...English toffee still is better but this recipe is so much easier. It really only took me ten minutes to make and then a few more to wait to cool down to enjoy!

OK, these are seriously too good to have around the house!  I ate half the pan the first night (not good!)!  I was looking for something fast and easy and this is it.  I think they taste better if they are kept refrigerated.  They get a little too soft and gooey at room temperature.

This is a long time favorite of mine.it. Like a recent reviewer suggested, this Christmas decided to make a change and I used Ghirardelli’s Bittersweet Morsels. This might be too much for some, but we love really dark chocolate so to us this was perfect with the super sweet toffee. Oh and many times I've made this with light brown sugar when I didn't have dark - sometimes adding a teaspoon of molasses and other times not. It is good both ways.

I have made this recipe a number of times.  One switch I have done is to replace the nuts with toffee bits on half for my family members who don't care for nuts.  Either way its delicious.  Be sure and put a layer of wax paper on the bottom of the pan to ease with cleanup.

WOW! These were absolutely fantastic! The only thing I changed, was using cashews, instead of pecans. Everyone raved about these, and multiple people have requested the recipe. I love how easy this is as well! This one is definately a keeper!

I made three batches of this during the holidays and each turned out terrific!  I lined my pan with foil and sprayed with cooking spray before spreading the saltines.  The seam where the foil overlaps can get stuck in the toffee, so make sure you fold the two edges over/under a bit instead of just overlapping.  This was a huge hit with my family, my husband's family and at work!  For my last batch, I used bittersweet (62% cocoa) chocolate chips because a friend is lactose intolerant, and these are also very good with the dark chocolate!  I will make this recipe often!

These came out really good and they were so easy to make!  A little too sweet for my taste, but hubby liked them. The only problem I had was the toffee burned a little around the edges - I only baked for 5 minutes, so I'm not sure what I did wrong.  Thanks for the recipe!

I love this toffee!  I am NOT a candy maker.  I'm too afraid of it.  But a friend made this for us last year and I just had to try it.  It was SO easy!  I literally had everything in my pantry.  I like to use mini-chocolate chips as they melt faster and are easier to spread.

Mine burnt around the edges....is that normal? Any ideas? I followed the recipe exactly, and left them in the oven for 5 min. 90% of it was unharmed..and still tastes great. I'm already planning on making them again to send back home. Hopefully that batch won't have the burnt taste on the end pieces. ;)

these hit the spot, they are sweet but really good. I used reg brown sugar and 3/4 cup of butter, I took someones advise about poping them back into the oven to get the chips soft enough to spread. Very good!

Wow, what a great cookie. I have made these many times and everyone just loves them. I do not use the pecans because not everyone likes the nuts. No matter what dessert I make, I always give my neighbor a sample and ask for his opinion, his response is, "it's still not better than bark" (that's what we call this recipe).

These were really easy to make and taste great. I melted a little white chocolate and drizzled that over the chocolate coating and they looked really nice in this years Christmas cookie tins.

Very, very sweet cookie, but really tasty!  Used club crakcers because that's all I had on hand and they turned out to have a nice salty/sweet flavor.  Super easy to make.

Definately a keeper!  Have modified it and great results when using 1 stick butter/ 1 stick margarine if short on butter. Parchment paper is now my favorite liner, excellent results and no mess!  I make a pan full and use only 1/2 chocolate drops- the other half I use grated almond bark.  I top it with nuts like crushed almond/ pecan/ or walnut.  *Left-over crumbs in the storage container are stored in a bag -frozen and reused for the next batch of cookies!!!

This was yummy and so easy! My kids and I had fun making these. I have never heard of crackers used in candy before but figured all these reviewers can't be wrong! I made a few batches, some with semi sweet chocolate chips and some with milk chocolate chips, I diddnt have dark brown sugar and used golden brown sugar and they came out great. Thanks for a keeper.

This was a great Christmas cookie.  These are so easy I couldn't believe it.  My husband and I made them together and he was a little skeptical but they turned out great and everyone likes them.    Fast, easy and tasty - what could be better?  A keeper.

This has turned out great two times.  I tried it the first time with 1.5 cups Special Dark chocolate chips (topped it w/ pecans).  The second time, used 2 cups semi-sweet chips (topped w/pecans).  IF I had to choose, the semi-sweet choc. chip ones tasted the best.  After cooling, I put the pan in the freezer for a couple of hours before breaking it into pieces.   Worked out great!

Been making thie for a couple of years now.
However, I don't even use the brown sugar and only bake at 375.  I melt the chocolate in the same pot and spread over the crackers.
For a topping I use Heath Pieces.  They are sold right by the chocolate chips.
The Heath really makes them much better than the nuts.

Very easy to make and very hard to mess up.  I made one batch with milk chocolate and pecan.  Another with dark chocolate and almonds.  Please toast your nuts before topping your toffee, it is soooo..GOOD!!

Thanks for the recipe :o)

These cookies come out delicious and this is a VERY easy recipe.  I followed the advice others had given about lining the pan with foil and I rubbed a little butter-flavored Crisco onto the foil.  The cookies did not stick and they were fantastic.  If you like toffee you will love this one!!!

What a great recipe!  I was not sure how I would like this made with the saltines but they were awesome and gave a very nice consistancy to the end result.  My husband was especially happy I made these.  I also used the no stick foil but a wee bit of non stick spray would have made it even easier to remove this treat.  I ended up putting these on a shelf outside the back door since the weather was -10 C degrees today and they were ready to cut in less than 30 minutes.  This recipe has been added to my Christmas favorites and will become a tradtion in our house.  Thanks Tracy!

Very easy to make and quite delicious.  Using the chocolate and pecans really makes this outstanding.  We couldn't stop eating it! Mmm...

I didn't know what to expect from these but they were excellent!  The saltines make a nice, flaky "crust."  Easy, inexpensive and the kids love them!  I lined a pan with foil then sprayed the foil with non-stick cooking spray as I read others had issues with sticking...and I also didn't have any dark brown sugar, so I just used light brown sugar and it was fine.

I made this recipe today and it is delicious! My family loves it. I tried it out today to take to an event at my children's school tomorrow. It's sure to be a big hit! I followed the recipe exactly--although I sprayed aluminum foil with Pam spray and the toffee lifted right out of the pan and clean-up was easy! Will make this recipe for the holidays.

I am the hero whenever I bring this.  It's a christmas cookie request, bake sale and church meeting fave.  I line the cookie sheet with foil though and cool overnight in the freezer.  Try not to eat all them yourself!

This dessert is really good! I give it 5 stars because I know if I'd followed the recipe exactly, it would be been better. I used half butter and half margarine, and it just wasn't the right texture, it was flaky and gritty instead of caramely. I will certainly make it again, and follow the recipe exactly.

Nice toffee flavor. I used 1/2 cup of regular butter and 1/2 cup unsalted butter. I used parchment paper for a quick clean up. Used only 1/2 the brown sugar.

I made these last Christmas and they were loved by everyone!  Will make them again this year...a double batch!   I also used tin foil and sprayed it with cooking spray.  The toffee came right off the tin foil with ease.

I made these for the first time 8 years ago.  Since then, right after Thanksgiving, friends and family start asking me if I am making my "crisps" (as they are known).  When I go to a cookie exchange they demand them!  I have never made something so popular.  THEY ARE DELICIOUS.  Sometimes they are tricky--you really have to follow the recipe.

The taste was great. They were a tad bit greasy but not bad. The thing that disappointed me is that these just aren't that "pretty" and while they are fine for family, I didn't put them on my cookie trays to give away due to their appearance. Oh, and these are horrible for your blood sugar reading, but we didn't make them for health reasons! ;-)

Ok, when my husband raves about a cookie, saying its the best I've ever made, I have to give it 5 stars!  This recipe as mentioned in earlier reviews is easy and fast.  Thank you for a great recipe, and making me look like a "hero"!

This was a great recipe.  Easy to make and everyone loved it.  I used parchment paper to line a jelly roll pan and it was quite easy to remove and break apart all cookies.  Without lining the pan, it could be difficult to remove.

I followed the recipe except that I didn't put the nuts on the top, as my husband and kids don't like them.  And maybe with that  extra salt from the nuts would've made them taste better.  As I and my family found them to be too sweet!

I also stuck them in the fridge to cool down quicker after they were already out for close to an hour and then cut...but I did notice that the chocolate layer was coming apart fromt he cracker...not sure if it was because I stuck them in the fridge or if others had this problem?  Just wanted to give a heads up!

But, I did really like how super easy these were to make!!!

I substituted graham crackers for saltine crackers. I also used the easy release reynolds wrap instead of greasing the pan. It was so easy I make it in my dorm room!

I guess I was expecting too much of this recipe-- it was just toffee with a crackery element to it. It took all night for the chocolate to harden, and even though I _love_ chocolate I would decrease the chocolate chips to ~ 1 1/2 cups. Maybe a toffee-lover would appreciate this easy toffee recipe, but I think I'll not waste the calories and ingredients on making this recipe again.

It was an easy and very inexpensive dessert to make.  Very sweet and salty.  I loved it!!!
The only problem I had was I put it in a casserole dish and sprayed it with oil before hand and it stuck to the pan anyway.
I would recommend this to anyone.
Thanks for a great and very sweet treat!!

wonderfully simple and everyone loves them.
it had a little too much chocolate for our taste.
But, we are not big chocolate fans.
Everyone else loved them!

YUMMY!  Wow, I made these to send to my boyfriend for Valentine's Day and he is going to LOVE them.  These are delicious for people who love cruncy, chocolately, crispy treats with good texture.
