This is another version of Manhattan clam chowder but very easy and tasty. I added 1/2 teaspoon of Old Bay seasoning in mine. I always add Old Bay for a little spice to my seafood recipes. I love clam chowder and love the Old England clam chowder but I am trying to eat healthier and this fits the ticket for my clam chowder fix. I used turkey bacon in mine but only for cutting calories and healthier for me. If you are not cutting calories, the regular bacon is great also. It is just a preference.  This is such a nice easy recipe to throw together and come home to a house filled with aroma of clam chowder. Add a little french bread to compliment and dunk with and it is a great meal.

Am I missing something here? I made this exactly as it is in the recipe; however, it was like a stew with no liquid?? Shouldn't there be some milk, soup, half and half, or something for the liquid??

This recipe is WONDERFUL.  Only changes I made were to suit me.  I used a medium rutabaga inplace of the potatoes; I added a bottle of clam juice, fresh thyme and I added the clams after the soup was done so that they wouldn't be chewy.  None of the changes actually had to be done.  I believe this soup is excellent as it is.  Thanks!

I agree with Stefanyh!  The receipe needs more liquid to be a "chowder"!  I added two cups of stock to the mix.

This was actually pretty good. I was put off by the tomatoes and carrots in the recipe as I've never made clam chowder that way, but it was really tasty...I used fresh thyme from my garden. Thanks for submitting this recipe.

The picture is deceptive.  You think you are going to make New England clam chowder (the creamy, buttery kind as shown in the picture)  when in actuality, this was Manhattan clam chowder (almost like a vegetable soup).  I agree that it needs more stock, but it's very tasty.  Just let folks know what kind of chowder this is in the title of the recipe, change the picture, and the problem should be solved.

It is a delicious chowder but they should get a new picture of it.

It shows a picture of creamy New England clam chowder, but the chowder that results from the recipe given is clearly a Manhatten-style chowder.

This was amazing. I added two russet potatoes chopped up into small cubes and I did not use the tomatoes. I let it cook on low for 7 hours to allow the potatoes to get nice and soft. Add some Monterrey Jack cheese for some delicious burritos or put it on some rice and youâ€™re good to go! I will be putting this into rotation!!!

I think that 3 stalks of celery is WAY too much celery.  Next time, I plan to use only 1 stalk, or maybe even cut the amount of celery down to 3 ribs.
