Love this recipe!!! My wife is from Belarus and I would keep asking her to make Borscht, she never has time lol. Finally I took matters into my own hands and made it my self thanks for the great recipe. The only thing I changed was I didn't leave on for 2 hours only 45 mins and it was good. Taste to tell I always say,its the best part of cooking.

This was the first time that I have ever made Borscht, and this recipe was easy to prep/cook and was very good. I couldn't get my hands on any lamb, so I used beef instead. I will definitely make it again.

This soup was good and easy.  My staple borscht starts w/sauted cabbage, onion, scredded carrots and bacon which is added to broth with both cubed and mashed potatoes along with beets which is excellent, but more time consuming.  Don't think I'll make this one again and will stick to my own recipe.

I love beet soup and I thought that the lamb gave this soup a wonderful dimension. I also added a few extra ingredients: carrots, garlic and fennel seeds (added with the lamb/onions) as well as a handful of barley, a couple of diced potatoes and 2 tablespoons of honey. Yum-tastic! Thanks Helga!

Amazing borscht.  Made my mom mad a little bit that I one upped hers with this recipe.  I substitute stew beef for the lamb, just because lamb is next to impossible to find near me, and it is still to die for.  Freezes very well.

Excellent!! I had to use beef chuck because I could not find lamb in my area. Also added a diced turnip and 1/2 cup chopped celery along with the other vegetables and reduced the beef broth to two and 1/2 quarts. I also used canned tomatoes ( 16 oz can).
Will make this again. It taste even better the second day after the flavors mingle.

This had a great flavor to it but I would add less broth next time. It was a little thin for my taste. I used 1 can of diced tomatoes and 1 1/2 tsp dried dill cooked into the stew because I didn't have any fresh to add after. My first time making borscht with fresh beets.

awesome dish...I made changes, but only because I didn't have the ingredients. used olive oil, and beef stew meat. also didn't use bay leaf or dill. Still was great.

I've made this recipe at least half a dozen times and every time it's been delicious.  I sometimes use beef instead of lamb depending what I have on hand.  It's a bit messy  and labour-intensive but the end result is worth it.

This is a perfect recipe!  I admit I didn't use the lamb because my husband hates it, but other than that I followed the recipe, and this is hands down the best borscht I have ever eaten.  The spices and seasonings are perfect.  I doubled this in order to feed all of us (2 adults, 8 kids), and ended up with  only a couple quarts left over.

I used stewing beef instead of lamb, but otherwise followed the recipe to a T.

I had some left over raw lamb bones intending to make some kind of soup.  This recipe delivered beautifully.  The flavour was rated highly by myself and my brother who has spent time in Russia.  I will definitely be making this again.

I made this recipe exactly how it was written except added 4qt stock. Excellent! I didn't know beet greens would bring it all together so nicely and add beautiful contrast to the deep rich purple color.

Put a nice helping of sour cream cos the flavor explodes and a generous sprig of fresh dill to make it pop!

This recipe will impress most, presentation is gorgeous!
