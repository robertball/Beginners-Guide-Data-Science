This was so good! I actually made a gluten free version. I used gluten free noodles, and served it with gluten free French bread! The only thing I would do differently next time is cut the hot sauce by half. While, delicious, this would have been way to spicy for my child. Can always add more after!
I didn't have jerk seasoning so I made my own.  That may have also significantly changed the level of spicy I ended up with! 
For the sauce, After cooking and draining the noodles, I put the cream cheese, sour cream, and other sauce ingredients into the hot pan to melt. THEN added it into the meat/veggies. Making sure the sauce was smooth and keeping the form of the pretty veggies! 
Thank you for a great recipe! I'll be making it again!

This was tasty! I did not use the bean sprouts b/c the store did not have any fresh, so I just topped it with a little green onion (which was yummy!). The only thing that I will say, for me anyways, is that next time I will not add the carrot, as I'm not a big fan and it didn't do anything for me. I do think other veggies could be added with success, like maybe spinach or zucchini. Also, taste and salt accordingly. I had to add more than called for. This would also be great subbing sausage for the ground beef, though the ground beef was fine. All around this was good and I would make it again! Thanks for sharing. :)

This is a great, quick and easy meal to make on busy weeknights. Just the right amount of ground beef, veggies, and sauce.

Excellent pasta recipe! I wasn't too sure about the ground beef with a cream sauce but it was yummy. Next time I might flavor my beef differently, or mix in some chorizo.

I did not use the fresh parsley, nor did I add the bean sprouts, but otherwise made the recipe as written. The taste of the jerk seasoning really came through nicely. Though we enjoyed this dish, my only disappointment was with just how thick the sauce came out. I will make this again, but will maybe add a little cream or milk to liquefy the sauce the next time.
