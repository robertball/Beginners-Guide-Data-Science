I used fresh mushroom doubles up on the garlic and used a yellow onion instead of red (all I had on hand). Very good! Will be making again!

Definitely keeping this used 4 oz container of fresh baby portobello mushrooms sliced doubled up on rest of ingredients. Served room temp over a salad! Delicious

Just a Q: Why does the picture have button mushrooms and calls for sliced and also calls for diced red onion and they look sliced?

The saut√©d mushroom were a gigantic hit. They came out delicious. I used the same recipie substituting cubed eggplant making it the same way. Both dishes came out fantastic. Everybody loved them both. I rate your recipie 5 Stars.

These were OK not great not bad; at least for our taste buds. We like ours a bit more garlic / savory so will stick with what I do normally. But I do like to always try new things so thank you for sharing. That is what this site is all about!!:)

I hate mushrooms.  I never eat them and did not eat these. ;) However, my husband and sons love them and my husband requested sauteed mushrooms and onions to go with his steak for his birthday. So I gave this a try- followed the recipe as written (used yellow onion because that is what I had) and they LOVED it. It was a hit with all 3! Thankfully I doubled the recipe and it was GONE!
