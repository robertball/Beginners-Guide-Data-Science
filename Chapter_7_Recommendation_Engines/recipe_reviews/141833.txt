Yummo! It's a very authentic-tasting Thai curry chicken. Warning: the green curry paste varies A LOT by brand. I used Maesri brand: VERY hot (and we love hot foods). I only used 1.5 tbsp which was plenty. Also, the coconut milk should be a full-fat (not low fat) and also varies quite a bit by brand. I prefer the Chaokoh brand which is nice & thick. Both of these brands should be available at any decent Asian market. A couple of changes I made: 1. used boneless chicken thighs (not as dry as breast meat), 2. reduced sugar to 1 tsp. I also added carrots, onions, and peas (gotta sneak those vegies ;) This one's a keeper.

This turns out well except you have to completely leave out the soy sauce if you expect a greenish curry versus a brown curry.  The soy affects both the flavor and the color in a very negative way.  Leave out the soy and it turns out very well and is sooooo easy to make.

Alert! I made a veggie version with lots of additions: Just like my fave Thai restaurant! I made a veggie version of this recipe by following it after heating the green curry paste. I used 5 ounces of tofu rubbed with a tiny bit of sesame oil and the teaspoon of ginger the recipe called for. I also added fresh basil, sweet peas, mini-corn, and bamboo strips. I served it over brown basmati rice capped with chopped peanuts, green onion, and cilantro. I will definitely make this again!

Save your time to measure curry paste and coconut milk, use 1 can (4 oz) of Maesri green curry paste and 1 can (14 fl oz) of coconut milk for cooking will have a good result. If coconut milk is too strong for you, reduce the amount or add some chicken stock.

All you need is to stir-fry your favorite vegetables in sequence depending on the cooking time. In my case, onions and carrots first, followed by fried tofu curds. Then I add some curry paste and coconut milk before adding tomatoes, green beans, and broccoli stems. Add the remaining of curry paste and coconut milk and let the sauce simmer until green beans are cooked to your liking. At the end, add zucchinis and broccoli florets a few minutes before you put the lid on and turn the heat off. 

Meat is almost unnecessary in this dish. If you like chicken, cut it in thin slices and marinate in some cooking oil and green curry paste. To ensure that chicken is tender and cooked thoroughly, stir-fry chicken as soon as vegetables are done. In a separated pan that is big enough for all ingredients, add some oil before adding chicken. Constantly stir chicken until only some pinkness shows. Add steamy-hot cooked vegetables in and mix all ingredients well.

Vegetables recommended for green curry: asparagus, bamboo shoot, bean sprout, broccoli, butternut squash, carrot, green bean, eggplant, mushroom, onion, snow pea, sweet pepper, tofu, tomato, zucchini, and etc.

Credit to the Chef - this is an execellent receipe.  The weights, measures and cooking times are all bang on so really no need to improvise!  I've cooked this a few times now and suggest for more bang for buck you add 1 fresh lemon grass stalk (reveal the white stalk center and crush with the flat of a knife)instead of sugar and cut back the coconut milk to 400ml adding 75ml of chicken stock as well.  Use boneless chicken thighs instead of breast.  All this really intensifies the flavours!!

This was easy for a beginner like me and it came out tasty. However, it did not have enough kick in it, so I would add more curry paste next time. Also, I agree with another reviewer that it was too sweet, so next time I will put in less sugar (I used white sugar). I served this with white rice.

Very tasty! I served it at a book club party and it got great reviews. I doubled the green curry paste as others have suggested (it may depend on the brand you use, so be careful) and I also used cane sugar for a more "natural" flavour. I used less sugar the second time around as I prefer dishes like these slightly less sweet in order to bring out the other flavours. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was my first attempt at making Thai green curry, and this recipe was a good base.  I think it heavily depends on the curry paste you have, b/c they vary significantly by flavor and heat.  My green curry paste was not very hot, but was flavorful, so even though I increased the amount of curry paste, the dish was missing heat for me.  Next time I'll add Thai chili peppers with this particular curry paste.  I added lemongrass (cut into large pieces so you can easily remove them before eating), Thai basil (totally essential!!), carrots, and red pepper.  I also tried making coconut rice by putting coconut milk into the rice cooker.  It was mildly fragrant with coconut, so I might tweak with that more.  With the added ingredients I think the curry had a lot more dimension, texture, and flavor, but needed more spicy/heat boost to compare to the Thai curries I had in Thailand!  Will add more curry paste and chili pepper next time... or try a different brand of curry paste.

I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could!  We have two really good Thai restaurants in our area and this recipe tops any of their green curry dishes.  I followed the recipe exactly, used Jasmine rice, it was absolutely perfect. My husband RAVED about it, we brought leftovers for lunch the next day.  I think this sauce would also be very good on fish, like tilapia or another mild white fish, maybe even salmon.  This was just perfect!

This is a great recipe which can be made with ingredients you can find in the Asian aisle of your supermarket. My personal tips: 1. ADD BASIL! Tastes awesome with fresh basil added; more like my favorite restaurant version. 2. Use 1 TB sugar, 2 was too sweet. 3. Add veggies, not just protein, for a full meal. 4. Mae Ploy is the best curry paste brand if you can find it.

I would not use 'white sugar,' instead I'd use raw cane sugar or palm sugar.

Very, very good. One reviewer noted it was too brown because of the soy.  I agree.  You don't need to soak the chicken in soy sauce or add additional soy sauce to the recipe.  Most recipes  have you gently simmering the cubed chicken in the sauce.  It's what lends to the delicate, tender flavor and texture of the chicken.  Instead of adding soy, add 1 tbls. of lime juice.  You'll end up with a succulent, lightly colored soup.

I was able to use fake chicken (made by Quorn) in place of real chicken to make this dish vegetarian! It tasted great!

there's no denying that this is very tasty...but it is not Thai.  I think next time i will double the fish sauce and add a hearty amount of fresh lime juice along with the cilantro at the end, and maybe cut down on the coconut milk a bit.

When I try a new recipe I like to make it as is. Did not particularly like the chicken dredged in flour and felt it wasn't necessary to do so as it made the curry too thick. We have our green curry dishes with fried naan to soak up all the great sauce..this was just too thick and had that 'flour taste' to it. Also felt that there was no need to add the soy sauce at the end..fish sauce is salty enough and the dark soy ruins the colour of the dish.

Soooo good, and so easy to prepare. Excellent for a meal where you want to impress! I used THAI KITCHEN brand curry paste, and used almost the entire small jar, probably at least 3 TBS. I cut sugar down to 1 TBS instead of 2, added bamboo shoots and a few frozen peas. BF loved this meal! (Although i DID screw up the rice.)haha
Definitely a keeper. Yum.

Yum- the sauce is to die for!  I ended up using a few leftovers to round out my dish- added peas, corn and added 6 oz cooked spaghetti that I chopped up and added to the skillet.  Pretty darn good!

Splendid! I used lite coconut milk, no flour/soy sauce, just sauteed the chicken after a spray with olive oil, and I added a container of steam fresh Asian veggies. YUM!!

I was so excited to make this recipe after reading all the good reviews.  Sorry, but it just didn't appeal to me.  It didn't have that balance of sweet, sour, salty and spicy that Thai food is known for.  It was too salty, and not sweet enough.  I had to rescue it by adding a half can of cream of coconut and some cilantro.  Won't be making this again.

Yum Yum Yum! This recipe is just what I've been looking for. Even though I doubled the recipe, there's not much left for lunch tomorrow! The only adjustments I made was using chicken thighs for the tenderness and added a bag of frozen peas.

We absolutely loved this green curry chicken (our first green curry!), but did find it to be a little too sweet and not spicy enough. The latter is probably related to our curry paste - we just don't have options around here, so we take what we can get. 

In the future, we'll cut the sugar entirely (I'd cut it some already for my diabetic husband - we think the coconut milk is plenty sweet enough! Delicious!) and season with black pepper and cayenne to give it the kick the paste is missing. 

We also, on the advice of a friend, added veggies to this recipe, which was a GREAT choice. I just threw in eggplant, snow peas in the pod, and red bell pepper when I did the green onions. Really added a variety, and they went WONDERFULLY. Served over Jasmine Rice.

This was my very first attempt at green coconut curry. I was very disappointed. The flour gave the sauce too much of a gravy consistency and the soy competed with the delicate flavour of the coconut.

The best meal I've ever had on this website so far; I made it with seafood though; a combination of Scallops, Shrimps and Calamari. My husband was complaining why I didn't make more of it! I fully recommend.

This was good but I had to make some changes.  I had to double the coconut milk (one can of light and one regular) and omitted the soy sauce.  I used tofu instead of chicken and added eggplant, green beans, carrots and yellow pepper.  Very good...I'll be making this again.

Tried this recipe last night and was pleasantly surprised by how well it turned out! We added a bit more of the curry paste (used Thai Kitchen which worked just fine) added red bell pepper, and some red chili flakes for heat. The result was not too hot, or saucey. Served it over rice with cilantro.

This was excellent.  I stuck to recipe but added just a tad more ginger.  The ginger adds so much as well as the fish sauce.  In order to have great results with this dish you HAVE to make sure to use good, authentic and quality ingredients.  It was gone so fast!  Just  a little spicy but if you are used to green curry you already knew that.  Superb.  Thanks Laus.

This recipe is easy and delicious. After reading reviews about the soy sauce turning the curry brown, I decided to leave it out. It can always be added as a condiment. I also used well trimmed boneless skinless chicken thighs and didn't bother breading them. I cut up the chicken and cooked it in a bit of olive oil and then removed it and continued on with the recipe, as written. With the exception of the sugar, which I did not add (I didn't miss it and can't imagine that it enhances the dish that much). 

Incidentally, I learned a trick for storing and using fresh ginger. Store it in the freezer (I've had my current piece a few months-no need to containerized). When you need it, take it out and grate it frozen, no peeling necessary. It grates perfectly.

This is my junk! I make it just as directed except I add 1/4-1/3 cup of peas at the end and a little chilli powder to the sauce while cooking. I think next time I'll try it with thighs and breasts. Also, if you can find unrefined sugar (brown sugar that's not THE brown sugar) it's much better and not as sweet as using white sugar. I guess if anything, I would reduce the amount of chicken by a few grams.

I only had 1 can of coconut milk on hand, but the flavor was incredible with the rest of the ingredients in their original ratio.  This dish will require the full fat version of the coconut milk.  In many recipes, like coconut chicken soup, you can get away with the half fat version, but not in this one.  Served with Jasmine rice, it was like a visit to an upscale Thai restaurant!  10 stars!

I don't include flour or soy sauce when making these curries. I like the lighter taste you get that way. I doubled the green curry. This dish is super easy to make and great if you don't have a lot of time.

This was great. I did not use the soy sauce and added 1/2 the amount of sugar. I would add some salt to make up for lack of salty soy sauce.

This recipe was pretty easy and full of flavor, thanks to the curry.  I omitted the green onion and the soy sauce, and I added cubed eggplant and mushrooms.  Delish!  I only rated it 4 stars due to the appearance of the chicken with the flour on it (gummy).  I guess it helps to thicken the curry eventually, but my chicken did not brown in 5 minutes, even on a mid-high heat.  It still came out good though.

This recipe came out delicious! I made some of the modifications the other users recommended: I doubled the green curry paste and I added peas, bamboo shoots, onion, fresh basil and green pepper to the recipe. I also reduced the amount of sugar and  served it over rice noodles.   The flavor wasnt as strong as I was hoping for, but it may be the curry paste I was using.

I really enjoy this dish. I made it about five times and I have spruced it up a bit with veggies and heat.  I double the curry paste, lots of veggies, bamboo shoots, lemon grass, and slice in several hot peppers and dried Thai chilis.   I add the veggies with about ten minutes to simmer so they don't overcook.  I've never used the soy sauce or sugar and the I made it with and without the flour.  Didn't find adding the flour added to the taste.  It just made more dishes for cleanup. Overall, this dish is excellent as is but is also a great base for your own customization.

This recipe is great!  I added some veggies (carrots and kale).  Based on one review recommending not using soy sauce, I planned on omitting it.  In the first step, I salted the chicken instead.  However, at the end, the sauce was still missing something, so I ended up adding about 1 tsp of soy sauce anyway.  Even after that, it seemed to still be missing something, so I ended up adding a couple of squeezes (~2 wedges) of some fresh lime juice and it worked like a charm.  I've tried several green curry dishes in the past and this is by far the best one I've tried.

This was delicious - as good as the great Thai restaurant nearby!! I've made this twice using Thai Kitchen brand green curry paste. The first time, the flavor was a bit bland. The second time, I used 3 tablespoon and the flavor was perfect. I also added crushed peanuts and crushed red pepper flakes for a bit more kick. Served over pad thai rice noodles. It's a new favorite for my family.

This recipe is magnificent. I LOVE Thai food, especially green curry chicken! Favorite dish of all time. I love spicy as well but left out anything spicy due to the preference of the rest of the family. Jasmine rice is a must! at least basmati....something fragrant. I made my own curry paste. I also lacked the ginger root and subbed a bit of ground ginger instead. I plan to invest in a little ginger root for my next cook up of this recipe (yes, a staple in our home from now on) Ginger root lasts up to a month in the fridge. Or!!! you can mince, process, shred, and freeze. If you love Thai....this recipe is the &^%*. For lack of a more enthusiastic word ;)

Fantastic. Have made this with regular and light coconut milk. Only difference I noticed was that the light one made the sauce to be a bit thinner, still tasted great though.

Very yummy!  I didn't add the soy sauce to the sauce as someone else recommended but I did add some bamboo shoots since I was trying to capture the taste of another dish we love.

First attempt at making curry or any thai food for that matter. I followed the recipe exactly, added carrots, leeks, and red bell pepper for some veggies and color to the plate. The taste was amazing, sweet yet still kicks with the curry paste. moving to a smaller city i missed the ethnic food choices and this reminded me of delicious authentic thai curry. amazing!

I also did a veggie version of this recipe, with tofu instead of chicken and then used a bag of frozen Asian style veggies and rice. Really, you can use whatever veggies or meat alternatives you want. I sauteed the tofu in a little olive and sesame oils, as well as some worchestershire sauce (only because I was down to my last TBSP of soy sauce). I put a little worchestershire sauce and veggie broth in with the frozen veggies and rice too. Once my tofu was nicely browned I removed it from the pan and used the same pan for the actual green curry sauce. I believe the only thing I omitted from the sauce was the fish sauce (and I used a lite soy sauce). After the veggies and rice were done cooking I put the tofu, veggies, rice, and sauce all together and served it like that. It was delicious!! Both my husband and I liked it very much (my husband said it was one of his favorite dishes now and that he will be requesting it a lot). I will definitely make sure to have enough soy sauce next time. I also may use different veggies - mushrooms would be good, as would baby corns, neither of which the frozen pkg had in it. I would also use more rice. Anyway, all of that can be tweaked to your preference. The sauce did turn out brownish, but who cares, it was so good and very easy too!!

I recently had bought groceries and was preparing to cook a recipe similar to this that can be found on the label of the  Thai Kitchen brand green curry paste and coconut milk.  I tried to lighten up the recipe with the light coconut milk instead of the richer version, added probably 3 Tbsp of curry paste, ground black and red pepper for seasoning, and also added about 3 cups of frozen stir fry veggies.  I served it over brown rice instead of the starchier white or jasmine for some extra nutrition.  The dish was absolutely delish!  Next time I will probably add at least half of the full fat coconut milk for added thickness, otherwise was great!

Wow!  This was fantastic!  I'm so glad that I can now satisfy my love of curry at home!  I made some minor tweaks to the recipe, none of which I think had a huge impact on the flavor.  I didn't coat the chicken with flour and soy sauce, just sauteed it plain in some oil.  I used regular soy sauce (since that's what I had on hand and really didn't want to buy another new ingredient).  I also added peas, carrots and bamboo shoots to the curry while it simmered for some token veggies.  Will make over and over.  Thanks!

I had high hopes after reading other reviews but this was nothing like my favorite Thai restaurant in Asheville.  I made exactly as the recipe stated as others said it was perfect.  I used full fat coconut milk and my only rationale for my dislike with so many favorable comments is as one reviewer stated different Thai curry paste vary in heat and flavor and my health food store only offered "Taste of Thai" brand and a different brand might be better?

I used light soy sauce, added red green and yellow peppers, onions, fresh basil, and used ginger/garlic paste. Only used one tbs of sugar. Served it on jasmine rice and it came out wonderfully. Next time I think I will add pineapple. I'll let you know how it turns out!

Excellent recipe and tastes wonderful, but this dish needs more heat!!! This recipe works well with red curry paste too but either way, double the amount. I used extra virgin coconut oil and boneless thighs - they taste better and are cheaper than breasts. Added baby corn and served it with jasmine rice and potstickers for an appetizer. This one will be added to the rotation, thanks!

Wow.  What a wonderful recipe!  I make the following modifications:  -Chili paste as needed to achieve the spice you want (this will depend on the curry paste you use).  I usually add 2T of chili paste. -2 bay leaves -Optionally omit the t of soy in your sauce: it can take away from the flavor if you're accustomed to traditional green curry -Flour as needed  Thanks for sharing!

This was my second time to make this.  My girlfriend and I love it, and everyone else who has tried it has loved it too.  I pretty much follow the recipe directly.  However, I thought the sauce was a little thick for my taste the first time I made it, so this time I boiled about half a cup of water with 1 tbspn of sugar and a teaspoon of chicken bouillon.  I then added it with the coconut milk, fish sauce, and soy sauce.    You can really go a lot of ways when adding stuff to this also.  I par boiled about 2 small sweet potatoes cut into 1/2 inch pieces, and I added 2 zucchini about half way in to browning the chicken, also cut into 1/2 pieces.  I then added them when adding the chicken back into the curry and they tendered up while simmering.    It was awesome!!!!!!!!

This was delicious!  Not quite hot enough for us with the 2T of curry, so I'll add more next time.

If you don't like a sweet curry, halve or quarter the sugar in this - It comes out quite sugary. Added some beans for color, and am confident you could add any amount of vegetables (beans, carrots, bamboo shoot, pumpkin) and it would only add to the flavor of this curry. The sauce was fragrant and thick - very well received by the family!

Great recipe!  A few tweaks bring even more vibrant flavor. First: veggies, to make this a one-dish meal.  I used 1 red and and 1 green bell pepper, sliced super thin, added halfway through simmer time.  Sliced zucchini should go nicely in this dish as well, and sliced mushrooms.  Next time I will also add thinly sliced onion.  I would love to find some asian eggplant to add also. Second, add some lime juice.  1-2 fresh limes, or 3-6 Tbs lime juice.  Start with the lower amount and taste.  Put in the amount you like best. Increase the fish sauce to 2 Tbsp or more - again, taste.  Finally, an absolute MUST for any Thai curry is basil (I omitted the cilantro).  Add whole leaves, or do a rough chop on the leaves and add 5-10 minutes before serving. Save a few whole leaves to use as garnish when serving.  Omit the soy sauce, as others suggest.  The flavor is not quite right for this dish, and the salt it would add can be added by increasing the fish sauce as I suggest above.   I used only 1 tsp of sugar, and 1 inch of ginger, peeled and grated.  I will try more ginger the next time.  Ginger root stores well in the freezer, in a plastic bag, and peels and grates beautifully when frozen.  Bon appetit!

Thanks so much for a great thai green curry recipe! I also love to put in eggplant, cauliflower, and bamboo shoots, stir frying them a bit with the chicken. Obviously this recipe will depend on what type of green curry paste you get, but I've found the most popular brands at Chinese supermarkets all do the trick. Quite often I prefer my curry with a bit more kick/spiciness so I add some fresh red peppers.

Excellent!  We ate this dish over brown rice.  I used white sugar and it came out great.  Very spicy though, so beware if you don't like spicy food.  I'm a huge peanut fan, so I might add some chopped peanuts next time.

Darn close to our favorite restaurant.  Good base recipe.  I omitted the flour, soy sauce, and cilantro. Added an extra 2/3 tbsp curry, red bell peppers, bamboo shoots and sweet basil.  For some heat I added a quartered jalapeño pepper while it simmered, I wish it would've been hotter may have to try a spicier pepper next time.

Used NangFah (it was the one that seemed most out of stock...so I assumed folks preferred this brand; it was SUPAH SPICY! DELICIOUS). I followed the first reviewer and took out the SoySauce and still felt it was TASTY. I also followed another reviewers to sneak in vegetables (eggplants, basil, and lemongrass-I think the eggplants made it a little watery, but I thickened it up with some flour/ cornstarch). Turned out so GREAT! Will definitely be cooking this again. Bit hit with my boo. :)

This was a nice curry dish, but could have been a little hotter for our tastes.  I used red curry as that is what I had, and added chopped peeled eggplant and chopped red pepper when I added the onion and garlic.  I did not use ginger, as I don't care for it.  I would absolutely fix this again!

I loved this.  Made according to recipe with exception of cutting sugar to 1t.  I used Thai Kitchen green curry paste, and it isn't spicy at all.  I would have preferred a brand with more kick.  Also, I used the Chaokoh coconut milk.  It was delicious, but almost a little too rich.  I might use half light coco milk next time.  Regardless, a 5 star recipe.  Just thinking out loud so I know what to fiddle with next time I make it.  There will definitely be a next time.

This was great! I've never soaked the chicken in soy sauce. I did dredge it in flour once, but I find that we like it pretty well when I leave those steps out. I like to double or triple the curry paste and add lots of vegetables. Some favorite additions are chopped zucchini, peas, and bamboo shoots. I would cut down on the sugar just a bit, as I find it to be on the sweet edge.

Make sure you follow the first step and coat all the chicken and cook it up right it makes a huge difference in the flavor, this also cooks out most of the soy sauce that others believe changes the color. I switched from white sugar to brown sugar as other curry recipes call for and it wasn't too sweet. I doubled the recipe also adding yellow squash, string beans and red bell peppers this adds color, flavor and veggies to the dish.

Great recipe. I've made authentic Thai recipes for quite a few years now, but this was by far the best i've tried. I used pure cane sugar instead of white sugar and used rape seed oil instead of normal cooking oil. My wife loved it. Add sweet thai basil leaves at the end.. you could be in Thailand!!!

Best curry I have ever made!  I used 2 chicken breasts, 4 oz. jar of green curry paste (1 TBS was added at the end), 4 cloves garlic, 2 cans coconut milk, then I added veggies before adding the chicken back in--carrot, red pepper, water chestnuts, bamboo shoots, and mushrooms.  Delicious!

This was the best Thai dish I have eaten! I didn't have soy sauce on hand and it was perfect without. I also added a few shreds of Thai basil to finish and served with rice, amazing!. I agree with other reviews that it doesn't really need the sugar but it can help cut the heat if needed. This has a nice medium heat to it. Next time I want to try and add a kaffir lime leaf to the sauce while simmering. Thank you for sharing your great recipe!!

This was an excellent curry recipe! My husband and I prefer more spice, so I added about a teaspoon more curry paste, added about a 1/4 teaspoon of curry powder to the flour, and added cayenne pepper to the overall mixture at the end to simmer. I only added about 1/2 a tablespoon of sugar as we wanted something more savory than sweet. I used a 13.66 oz can of coconut milk, which was plenty and kept me from buying an additional can for only a couple of ounces. I did toss the chicken in soy sauce, but I left the soy sauce out for the second addition. The end result was delicious! My husband has had authentic curry in Thailand and said this was spot on. Thanks!!

I always tweak this a bit: 
-I add a bit more ginger, to taste.
-**More veggies- depending on what I have including: squash (which needs to cook the longest), broccoli, carrots, onion, red bell pepper, mushrooms, etc. 
-More curry paste, to taste. 
-**1 can coconut milk to taste. 
-**About 1/2 cup chopped up basil, added before serving to each bowl individually.
-LESS fish sauce (about 1 teaspoon). Less soy sauce (about 1/4TB). 

I serve over coconut or cilantro jasmine rice.

I really enjoyed this dish.   It may have been the brand of green curry paste that I used (Mae Ploy), but the dish was just a tad spicy.  But overall, I would definitely repeat this recipe.  And I love how simple it was.  Thanks!

I found this to be a little bland, and not as creamy as what you get in restaurants. My husband cooked the leftovers the next night with some cream and a serrano chili, which improved it, but there was still something missing. It's a good place to start.

Very good and authentic tasting.  I like veggies, so started by stir frying about 2 cups of veggies in a T. oil for 3 min.  I added a little crushed hot peppers, too.  Then I proceeded with recipe and added veges back last 5 minutes.  I used basil instead of cilantro and served with jasmine rice.

a wonderful dish! i used oyster sauce because i did not have fish sauce and it worked fine. i was a little worried at first when i tasted the sauce 5 minutes into simmering because it was too coconuty for my taste i added some basil to brighten the flavor and turmeric which brightened up the color and simmered for 30 mins instead of 20 adding water when the mixture became too thick. this doctoring made a perfect green curry!

The taste was great, not too spicy, but I have little kids so it was fine.  There was a ton of sauce so I doubled the chicken.  I also followed other reviews and added peas as well as boneless skinless thighs (used both breasts and thighs).  The thighs were definately better.

Awesome!  We loved it, we did end up using red curry paste because I couldn't find green, but can't wait to try it with green.

Quite good. I used peanut oil for the oil (always do in Oriental dishes) and because I don't have access to dark soy or fish sauce I subbed regular soy. I also had a lot of "gravy" left over so maybe next time I will add more chicken to get more servings. Definitely a keeper.

Far too salty as written!!  I should have known better and tasted it before I added the 2nd TB of soy sauce.  I had to do some doctoring to make it edible.

As written, the recipe is quite tasty and satisfying, but as other reviewers have pointed out, the heat and flavor of the curry paste varies a lot by brand. I used "Taste of Thai" because it is available in my local supermarket, but that brand is hot without a lot of herbal flavor. To compensate, I added 2 Tbsp each of chopped fresh mint and cilantro in the last 5 minutes of simmering. I also added 1 cup each green peas, diced carrots, and diced onions. I too substituted an equal weight of skinless boneless chicken thighs for the chicken breast. They're more moist and flavorful. Serve it with jasmine rice, but consider adding a simple salad of chopped cucumbers tossed with palm vinegar (or rice wine vinegar), cilantro, fish sauce and a little sugar. The bright flavors complement the curry nicely.

Could be made more authentic with the addition of a chopped green chilli (which turns up the heat), 2 chopped stems of lemongrass, a couple of thai basil leaves, a squeeze of fresh lime and some straw mushrooms.

I guess I am in the minority on this one.  Both my hubby and I agree it was not a good curry by any stretch.  Very little curry taste.  The fish and  soy sauces were too strong as well. Quite mild for a curry, no zip like we prefer.  Won't be making it again.

This makes very authentic tasting Thai food!  I have made it numerous times now and everyone just loves it.  The only thing I changed was adding only 1 TBSP of white sugar like many suggested.  I throw frozen peas in and it is an awesome curry.  If you let this sit for a little it actually thickens up nicely and is great for leftovers the next day (that is if you have any!)

This recipe is wonderful.  I do think the curry paste must vary considerably in hotness, as the first time I made this, I used 2 T. of paste and it was so hot that I was the only one in my family that could eat (and we eat lots of spicy foods).  Next time, I cut the amount of paste to 1 T. and it was perfect, very spicy but not burn-your-mouth-off hot.  I will be making this regularly.

I added vegetables (red and yellow peppers, asparagus, carrot, bamboo shoots) and used thin pork slices and 6 prawns instead of 1 pound of chicken. 
I did add a handful of Thai Basil at the end just because I have heaps on hand.
I am personally not a big fan of Thai curries, but I think this is the best one I've ever tasted and my partner thinks it deserves a 5 even though it's not the best he's ever had.

This is an amazing dish! It is by far one of the best recipes that I have tried from this site. I followed it to the letter and a chopped red and green pepper for nutrition and color. Everyone at the dinner table just gobbled this up. I cant say enough about this recipe!

I had tried to make Thai green curry chicken before, because it's my favorite dish at my favorite restaurant.  I had been unsuccessful, until this recipe.  This tasted almost exactly like the one in the restaurant!  I did add some red bell pepper  and some bamboo shoots as well.  I'm going to make it again in a few days for my friend who also loves Thai food.

I have recently lost 24 lbs. since Feb. 2nd so this is how I converted the recipe to lower fat and more nutrition.
I cooked my organic chicken in organic chicken broth on low till done with ginger, green onions and garlic in the chicken broth. Because of that I did not use the flour or oil. I used lite coconut milk instead of regular. I boiled down the chicken broth solution, cocnut milk  to 1/2 its original which intensifies flavor and added curry paste and other ingredients. I used brown rice. Instead of white sugar I used raw and less of it or omitted it all together.I cooked the rice in the organic chicken broth instaed of water.

I'm definitely going to make this again.  I followed the recipe exactly; the chicken turned out really juicy and the flavor was great.  For a little color I added about 1 cup of frozen peas and carrots.  My boyfriend and I both agreed it was a little on the spicy side so the next time I make it, I'll probably half the amount of curry.

Good! Definitely better if you add extra veggies. I added mushrooms and some bell peppers. Next time I also wouldn't add the second portion of soy sauce. I'd also recommend adding squeezed limes at the end!

i made this a couple times. eventually i realized the key to success is to buy the curry paste from the Asian market. at the grocery store you get a small bottle of much blander paste for $8 and at the asian market you get a big tub of more flavorful paste for about $4. It's frustrating how different the results are depending on what paste you buy.

I made this recipe using Tofu instead of chicken, I prepped the tofu exactly as stated for the chicken, and it was absolutely delicious! I also tossed in some fresh chopped veggies.  You could always add some broth to lighten up the sauce.

This is super yummy and will stay in the rotation. I use chopped Thai Basil instead of cilantro and add sliced bell pepper and carrots to add veggie nutrition. I use 1 can light coconut milk together with 1/3 cup chicken broth. The specified 2 Tbsp of Mae Ploy yellow curry paste gives just the right amount of heat (not mild, but not too spicy). Following recommendations in many of the other reviews, I omit the soy sauce in the sauce part, and use just a dash of sugar. We all like this dish, even my 10 year old. Best over Jasmine rice with stir fried bok choy.

Love this basic recipe for green curry.  Don't let the picture fool you because it doesn't look appealing.  I add whatever I have handy, broccoli, carrots, bamboo shoots, mushrooms, asparagus and it is always great!

Easy to make and very good. You can add vegetables or whatever you want. I like mine a little spicier than the amount of paste called for so I tripled it but other than that I followed the recipe pretty close. I didn't have chicken breast so I used thighs but it was chicken. I liked it and would make it again and again. Of course I am a sucker for green curry.
When you read bad reviews of this and other recipes remember they are not chiseled in granite. They are starting points and give you a good idea of proportions of the ingredients. Don't be so ready to say bad things. This is a good place to start and on it's own it is pretty darn good the way it it written.

Loved it, with these changes. First, I didn't use soy sauce.  It'll mess up the color. If you need a little more saltiness, you might try kosher salt. Second, I used whole coconut milk, none of that low fat, thin stuff. Third, the coconut milk is sweet enough, no sugar for me. Fourth, chicken thighs work. Last, I added peas, julienned carrots, and at the very end, thinly cut squash. Yum.

A little bland for us and it felt like something was missing. Perhaps a good bunch of Thai basil incorporated into the sauce at the last minute. We like the Thai curries but this just wasn't for us. I still enjoyed trying the recipe. thanks Laus.

This was fantastic! I have tried MANY Thai recipes - this one delivers. After reading all reviews - I substituted Kikkoman soy sauce to saute the chicken(it is lighter and does not "stain" sauces), and omitted second amount.  I also used at least DOUBLE the green curry paste and substituted agave syrup for sugar.  To bring this recipe to perfection I added a healthy squeeze of lime juice during cooking and served with lime wedges when plated.  Thanks for submitting - one of my new "basics".

Great base recipe.  I added half a sliced red onion, 1 sliced up Japanese eggplant, one jalapeño (it was what I had lying around) and juice of one lime.  My husband and I both loved it.  This is a keeper!

pretty good. i used boneless thighs, because that's what i had on hand, and light coconut milk for the same reason. i added lots of veggies, which i suspect watered down the curry flavor, so next time i will add more, but i think the curry flavor would have been just right without the veggies.

AMAZING!!! It tasted just like the green curry we get at our local Thai restaurants.  We left out the soy sauce because we really try to avoid MSG, and we left out the fish sauce.  I also forgot to get fresh ginger, so I used 1/4 tsp of ground ginger since I had that laying around the house.  We also added a can of bamboo shoots (drained) and some fresh basil.  YUM!!!

I had a smaller can of coconut milk (13.5 oz).  I added a bell pepper, but I should have added two.  I think the green curry paste that I added lacked spice, so I had to add cayenne.  I used the Thai brand.  I think some chicken broth and some lemongrass would do a lot for the flavor.  I don't cook a lot of Thai food, so I think this is a good recipe to begin with.

Yep, excellent!  I too added veggies, peas, carrots, onion, and celery, which I boiled in chicken stock before adding.  I like other reviewers used 4 oz of curry paste and 1 can of coconut milk.  I used Thai Kitchen brand curry paste.  Garnished with cilantro, peanuts, coconut, and green onion.  Very, very good!!!

Fantastic recipe! I added double the Mae Ploy green curry paste, fried the 1-inch pieces of chicken breast in 2 Tbs peanut oil then added a chopped zuchini, matchstick carrots, a sliced white onion, and a chopped red pepper. I added a tsp of sugar instead of what the recipe called for and used Braggs' liquid aminos in place of soy sauce for a lower sodium meal. I simmered it 10 minutes, removed it from heat and I added grape tomatoes and three diced birds eye chilis I had soaked in boiling water for ten minutes. Then I let it all sit for about 10 minutes while the jasmine rice finished cooking. I served it over jasmine rice and added chopped green onions, torn basil leaves and cilantro as garnish. My picky son loved it and my husband raved that it was restaurant quality green curry. We will definitely make again. Thanks Laus for posting!

Good flavor but I would want a bit more heat. There is no heat to this dish. I also added veggies and cashews to give it more textures. Celery, Carrots, Spinach.

Easy, simple recipe which yielded excellent results. I made this for 20 volunteers in Phnom Penh, Cambodia (where my wife and I live) and it was as good as I can find throughout SE Asia. The chicken was incredibly tender...soy sauce/flour mixture is a great idea. I added Chinese eggplants (miniature), bird chills (for color) and three fiery Thai child for extra zing and it was amazing. Also great for leftovers.

This was delicious!  I didn't have green curry paste, so I used green curry powder instead but it seemed to work out well.  I also added in about a 1/2 a chopped jalapeno for a little heat.  Delicious!

This dish was just ok. Flavor was kind of bland and the smell of curry sets in your carpet and furniture for days. Recommend boiling a pot of vinegar and cracking a window while cooking this.

This is a very yummy and simple recipe that my picky boyfriend actually enjoyed!  I used Thai noodles instead of the traditional rice.  I will def be making this again probably very soon. I too, cut down on the sugar by about a third and it turned out perfectly.  I also incorporated fish sauce into the mix to add a bit more of a sally flavor and to counter the 'too sweet' that this dish was having problems with.

VERY good. Only mine didn't come out green. Once I added the soy sauce it turned brown. I did only use 1.5 table spoons of curry paste though. My kids are not fans of spicy food. Next time I will make it for just me and my husband with the full 2tbls I hope that will change the color.

Second time I've made this. First time I used chicken this time I used tilapia. Great dish! Easy to make. Used light coconut milk and omitted the cilantro (did not have any) Husband not usually a fan of Thai food however loved it. Added fresh green beans and broccoli while simmering. Will make again.

way way too sweet. Leave out the sugar and soy sauce. I used just veggies (Eggplant, red pepper, green beans and bamboo shoots)...worked great but lacked in level of heat. Needed some chili flakes or hot sauce to give it even the slightest bite. Great dish overall just needs a few adjustments!

Excellent! I made it the first time and hubby was very happy and asked me to make it again second time. We were out of chicken so I made it with pork. Still just as good as if it was chicken. No left over. Kids love it over jasmine rice. Hubby even bought some to share with his family!

The all important ingredient is the curry paste, buy cheap paste like I did ( Thai Kitchen) and you wind up with a bland, not spicy meal. That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed this. I added green beans, cauliflower, and carrots and used chicken thighs like other suggested. I also only used 1 tbs of soy sauce at the beginning with the chicken and only used 1 tsp sugar ( I agree with others that it doesn't need it). Next time I might use 1/2 cup or more of broth to even out the coconut flavor.

This recipe is screaming for HEAT!  Wow.  Come on, it's Thai food.  We tripled the paste and it was still bland.  Added red peppers and broc which made it very colorful but had to pull out the crushed red pepper to give it some kick!  Will make again but with more HEAT.

This is a great recipe and pretty easy except for a bunch of chopping. Here are my two alterations: I use extra firm tofu instead of chicken (which makes it even simpler and quicker) and I cut down on the curry paste. My kids find it too spicy with 2 Tbsp (I, however, find it perfect with 2 Tbsp, but that's life!).

Very good and tasted a lot like our favorite Thai restaurant!  A little salty so will cut back on the soy sauce next time.

This recipe was very good for the first time making a Thai curry. Instead of using store-bought curry paste, we homemade ours (very fresh and flavorful). Next time I will add bamboo, basil, sliced onions and may reduce the coconut milk a bit and add water or milk.

I would give this 4 1/2 stars, if I could. I cut back the sugar a bit and substituted chopped yellow onion for the green onion and it turned out great. I also added one potato, one sweet potato, zucchini and shredded carrots. You could add pretty much anything and it would be great. Thanks for the recipe!

This was very, very, very good... and scratched the itch I'd been having for Thai food.... plus it was a "comfort" kind of thing as it has been cold and wet here lately.  I followed the directions almost to a T... the only changes being that I found out mid-recipe that I didn't have the fish sauce it called for (note: check to make sure that you lay eyes upon all the ingredients before you get started)... so I googled substitutes... and the first one was 2 parts soy sauce to one part lime juice.  I went with that, though looking later, there are other options.    I also used splenda as a sub for the sugar, which worked out well also.  I did add in an assortment of green & red peppers, and baby portobella mushrooms along with the green onions as I had these sitting in the fridge and looked near death and needed to use them up... not because I was trying to spice things up... I just didn't want to dirty anther pan... and this is the way to use leftovers nicely vs tossing them out (we are on a tight budget)...  The flavor of the sauce was absolutely perfect... even though I goofed and had to figure out the sub for the fish sauce.  I will definitely be making this again... the chicken was moist... the veggies were tender (I will add my extras later next time to keep them a little more firm) and we sopped up the sauce with jasmine rice.  Absolutely perfect for our home!  Thank you for sharing!

There ought to be a LAW against such a scrumptious dish!  It was just delightful.  So full of flavor.  I have NEVER done curry but this was divine..  The only thing I didn't have was the fish sauce.  It was so full of flavor.  I made it with basmati rice and steamed broccoli.  Definitely a winner.

Quite good- the green curry I used is by the label called "Maesri" and I used about 1 1/2 tbls as opposed to two- it is quite "hot". I used one can of coconut milk, reduced the sugar to 1 tbls and added a chopped green pepper. Yes- I altered the recipe- but had I followed it exactly- I know it would have been too sweet- that's the reason for a 4 star- but it's all personal taste. I served it with Thai sticky rice and steamed broccoli--Easy and quick to make.

Very nice green curry.  I added some chopped onion, sliced zucchini, sliced red bell pepper and coarsely sliced fresh basil (at the very end) to make it more like the restaurant style green curries.  I'm planning on trying this again with different meats.

So good!  Made it for a friend, she insisted I make it again for her and her husband (who loves spicy food).  It was made for me (the 1st time I had it) by a friend, who used potatoes in the recipe.  I think it's fantastic either way!  I must insist on Jasmine rice in this recipe...IT IS SO GOOD!  I've never used the sugar in the recipe, but I do use everything else, including fish oil.  I could go on and on, but please, please, please try it for yourself, you won't regret it.  Thanks to the person who submitted this.  It has allowed me to impress both friends and co-workers over and over again.  Next time I do intend to double the sauce and cook it in a wok.

Love this dish. I took the advice of others and used boneless/skinless chicken thighs instead of breasts. I also used only one can of coconut milk + the balance in chicken broth to make the 2 cups. Reduced the sugar(used palm instead of white) a little, and added a pinch of coarse salt.  I also added cubed/peeled chinese eggplant and sliced carrots with the coconut milk.  And stirred in torn pieces of chinese basil at the end.

My husband and I love Thai food. I was very pleased to find this recipe. As other reviewers have suggested, I use brown sugar instead of white sugar. I omit fish sauce as I just can't get over the smell and add some bamboo shoots. 
I make this at least 3 times a month. Sometimes I use red curry. This is a very easy dish to make.

I love curries, and I have made many.  This one is the best I have ever made.  I made two minor changes.  First, I could not find fish sauce in my little town, so I just subbed extra soy sauce.  Second, I added a sliced red bell pepper for color and taste.  The chicken soaked in soy sauce and then coated in flour and stir fried was so tender and juicy.  The curry was perfect... not too hot and not too mild.  This will be on my regular rotation!

Excellent recipe!!!  I followed it to the T.  The only thing I did was tone down the spice for my kids by adding a bit of cream which made it even much creamier.

Pretty tasty. I was worried when I first started cooking this - the sauce was really thin - but it thickened nicely as it cooked, and had great flavor. I'll make it again.

Very good! We used seitan stir-fry strips instead of chicken, for a vegetarian substitute. Still too much heat after halfing the green curry paste, but green curry is traditionally a spicy dish!

With a few tweaks, this turned out a solid 5 star meal. I upped the seasonings until it was how we like them. I added some lime juice and a stem of lemongrass; also used galangal instead of ginger. Very very good. Thanks, Iaus!

So in love with this, I always add at least three times the green curry, brings in the spice and makes my house smell wonderful. Last time i made it the people next door came over to find out what i was making. Never had that happen before.

The green curry paste that you select can either make or break this dish.  Go to your Asian store and pick up some authentic green curry paste...don't substitute the stuff you buy at the local grocery market.  It'll make a huge difference!

I used green curry paste and had to add a bunch extra to get the flavors perfect. Also added frozen bell peppers and peas. Served over jasmine brown rice. It was a big hit!

Sensational!  I loved how the chicken was coated before cooking it.  I'll be doing that to the chicken in my other curries now too.  My husband loved it just as much as I did.  I used 1 can of lowfat coconut milk and it worked perfectly.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  I'll be making this again very soon.  Thanks.

This was so good. I dont have much experience with curries, and I didnt have quite the ingredients called for (all I had was curry seasoning powder - salt free) so I wasnt sure how it would work. It was wonderful. I just kept adding the powdered spice until it was just right. Not sure if it ended up being "yellow" curry though. It looked yellow to me. Very good, easy recipe. Will definately use again and again.

This recipe was easy and delicious. Cilantro was the perfect garnish. I added eggplant and zucchini cooked in olive oil.  Yum!

I make it with yellow curry paste instead of green and find it just as good.

I love that this recipe actually mentions heating the curry paste to allow flavors/aromas to release.  Too many recipes are about being simplistic and fast/ way less ingredients.  Their are plenty of those recipes but getting it right and perfecting a dish is my aim.  Great recipe and you can add on how you like.

This was a fantastic, easy recipe! I will make this again and again. I took a shortcut and used rotisserie chicken with cornstarch instead of flour, and added chopped yellow and red peppers, snowpeas, lemongrass, mushrooms and and about 3 times the green curry paste (I like it spicy) and it was amazing! it really tasted like restaurant quality. Thanks for this recipe!

I loved this so much!! I added bamboo shoots and poured mine over jasmine rice boiled in coconut milk. So fabulous! Next time, I will add more green curry paste as I didn’t think there was quite enough curry flavor. Thanks for such a wonderful recipe!

I made it for my big family so threw in a few veggies to stretch it & it turned out amazing. I double each ingredient& left out the ginger & added the following:
* one red bell pepper
*one can of sliced bamboo
*half a bag of frozen peas & carrots
* 2 chinese egg plants (sliced)

& i fried some chicken egg rolls to go with
Honestly once you choose your meat & add curry paste you can add any veggies you want & itll still taste awesome.

This was absolutely delicious. Changes I made - used one tbsp of green curry, one full fat can of coconut milk and maybe 3/4 cup or so water. It was very spicy for my teenagers (might have been my strong green curry paste from an Asian market) so I tempered it with about a cup of whole goat milk yogurt. Used about a half tbsp honey in place of the sugar. Squeezed a little lemon juice in at the end. My chicken pieces didn’t much get coated in the (gluten free) flour after the soy sauce (i ran out of the flour) but still turned out amazingly tender and moist. I used a small celeriac root, baby Bella mushrooms, a bit of the chopped stems of rainbow chard, and a zucchini for the veggies. Didn’t have fish sauce so I just used the soy sauce. Without adding any additional salt this curry had the most complex delicious flavors that my whole family raved about. Can’t wait to make it again, maybe next time with shrimp, bell peppers, mushrooms and use cauliflower rice as the base (I’m low carbing). Thanks!

I made this exactly as directed except I subbed tofu for the chicken. My girls thought it could have used more heat but I liked it a as is. I was confused by one comment saying this was too hot and to decrease the curry. I found little to no heat at all. Very subtle flavors and easy to make. I will definitely make this again.

I’d use a little less soy sauce or a low sodium option next time as it was a tad salty, but overall I loved it.

We have followed this exact recipe for years.  It’s never let us down. From time to time we will throw some sliced green zucchini in there as well, which is yummy. But the person who posted this recipe really nailed the measurement of the ingredients so that the flavors are perfectly balanced.  I’ve never messed with that combination!  Try it, you’ll love it!!

I made it exactly as the recipe so I could give an honest review.  Wasn't bad but I've had better.  Was too sweet, would not add as much sugar next time, and maybe one tablespoon of brown sugar would have given it more depth in flavor. .  Needed some lime juice and zest to add a freshness.  The chicken was tender and moist.  I think it would be good with some veggies too, like onions, carrots, maybe mushrooms.

Delicious, but I added cayenne pepper and red pepper flakes to give it more of a kick.

After 38 years of marriage my husband said “This is the best meal you’ve ever made!”  Tonight we are trying a chicken thigh with curry and pineapple.  Wow. We love Thai food and this was a HIT!

It sounds fantastic, but my daughter has a coconut allergy, what would be a good substitute that wouldn't alter the flavors too much?

Didn't have fish sauce, but it was still great. I also used fresh basil leaves instead of cilantro, as my fave place does.

So good! I added extra veggies, sweet potato, red bell pepper, baby bok choy and a hand full of spinach. Family loved it! Only complaint, I didn't make enough. Served over jasmine rice.  Again,  so, so good!

Restaurant quality flavour!  
I used brown sugar instead of white (as I've seen brown sugar in many other curry recipes), and added two bell peppers cut in strips at the simmering step for some added veggie substance.
Will definitely make again!

My husband and I loved this recipe (served over white rice)! So yummy. I added 1 chopped green pepper & 1 yellow crookneck squash to it shortly after adding the green onions, etc. I also excluded the tablespoon of soy sauce the recipe calls for once the coconut milk is added. We will definitely make this again soon, with the veggies, too. :)

Perfectly yummy recipe but I do a few additions. I added a chopped onion and cilantro and instead of the coconut milk I use coconut cream powder mixed with low salt chicken broth, two small zucchini and a couple reconstituted dried shitake mushrooms. I like it with more of the sauce. I use the Mae Ploy brand of curry paste and use more because I like it HOT. Serve over Jasmine rice. Mmmm!

Rating it 5 stars for the base recipe and helpful comments.   I left out the soy sauce and flour entirely, added fish sauce and sugar to taste.  Doubled the sauce (coconut milk and green curry paste) due to the amount of chicken and veggies put in - wanted to have enough extra for the jasmine rice.  Had to use thai chili pepper as the only green curry paste available was favorable but didn't have heat.  Now that I've made this once and got the hang of it I'll definitely do it again.

Amazing! Might Ben my most successful All Recipes find. Just like our favorite Thai place. If you skip the soy sauce like I did, add a bit of salt. Can’t wait to make it again! I used peanut oil which added nice additional later. Yum!!!

I had leftover Green Curry Paste, so I found this recipe and decided to try it. I think the heat may have been a bit too high when I added the paste as the oil started splattering pretty bad, but it was quickly absorbed by the paste. I served it with rice and it was very tasty! Definitely something I will keep in the book.

Very good. I followed all directions. However, I doubled the curry amount Bc I wanted to taste more curry. I Added red and green bell peppers, and baby corn. Next time I would also add water chestnuts for more crunch. I wouldn't use so much sugar, or possibly just not use any Bc I hate having to add sugar to meals that aren't a dessert. And maybe less soy sauce Bc the green curry was salty enough, and less salt is better for health. This feed 7 people with modest portions. And a few of my friends were able to have a small second portion.

Made this for 8 people and it was  almost all eaten, which is amazing because there were 2 picky eaters. It was spicy: I used a Thai green curry paste that was pretty spicy. I accidentally put too much fish sauce in so it was a little too salty, but not so much that it ruined the taste. Too much coconut milk in the doubled recipe and I think I might add a little corn starch next time.  I added green peppers and those who like them ate theM all.  Definitely make again.

This was delicious!  My two year old devoured it as well! Such depth and complexity of flavors. Although I think the cilantro was a distraction rather than a compliment. 
 It took me an hour and a half to make- mostly because of that first step of cubing and browning the chicken. You could save time by having your butcher cube it or do it yourself ahead of time.

Loved this recipe (with some alterations). After reading the reviews, I used only one cup of coconut milk and half of the amount of fish sauce.  My mother and I enjoyed it very much, but it was more sweet than spicy and I will add an extra tablespoon of green curry paste next time.

I took the advice of several other posts and omitted the soy sauce and cut down he sugar to 1 T. Outstanding recipe! Everyone loved it. I'll look for hotter green curry paste in future, as mine didn't deliver.

Delicious!!! Took advise from other reviewers and made a few changes.  Left out the flour and soy sauce altogether.  Seasoned chicken with ginger, garlic and black pepper and sautéed.  Chopped half an onion and sautéed with the garlic, fresh ginger and green onions.  Added the entire small jar of green curry, cooked that for a couple of minutes then added back the chicken.  Added 3 julienned large carrots along with 2 cans of coconut milk, 1Tbsp of sugar and fish sauce and cooked for 15 minutes. Sliced a small package of baby Bella mushrooms and cooked for another 5 minutes until tender. Garnished with cilantro and served with Jasmine Rice... Entire family loved it

I am by no means a good cook and this was my first attempt at making a curry.  However, this is a relatively simple recipe that turned out incredibly bland.  This might be attributed to the brand of curry paste I used, which I found to have very poor reviews after the fact (Thai Kitchen). However, I also found the fish sauce to be overpowering as well.

I liked the concept but felt it could use some extras.  I included carrots, yellow pepper, thin sliced fresh mushroom (4), thin sliced red onion (1/2 medium) and 1 can bamboo shoots into the mix.  It had more visual and taste appeal.

Soy sauce and fish sauce together would make it a bit salty so beware if your concerned with sodium..I didnt use soy sauce in mine..The picture shown does not even match the recipe..It shows orange and red peppers which is what I added to mine along with a small can of bamboo shoots.. I also added Thai Basil leaves and Kiffer Lime leaves that a real Thai restaurant would use in this dish..You can find the Kiffer Lime leaves and Thai basil leaves at a good international food store to make this way more authentic..  I put a pinch of brown sugar in it  too..My green curry paste came in a small jar from Walmart and I added a little more than half the jar for the right amount of heat..If you cant find that then add a small pinch of cayenne

My household loves this curry dish! The only reason I didn't give this recipe 5 stars is because I've made a few changes. My changes are as follows; I added an extra Tbsp of curry paste and ginger, 2 diced red Thai chilies and 2x 400ml cans of Coconut milk instead of 2 cups. I cut the sugar down to just  2 tsp
I added 1 1/2 cups chopped broccoli and 1 cup of chopped carrots to the mixture just after adding the coconut milk.

It was ok.  I didn't care for the addition of fish sauce and soy sauce at the end.  It ruined the flavor and was too salty.

Increased the curry paste to 3 Tbsp and reduced sugar to 1Tbsp.  At last 5 to 7 minutes of cooking I added snow peas and red peppers sliced thinly and a jalapeno with a few seeds.  I also used chicken tenders cut into 1 inch pieces. The results were melt in your mouth chicken with just enough kick in the sauce. I have made this several times, always with great results.

My mom loved it, I found it to be somewhat bland. Would try a different brand of green curry paste next time. We added a bunch of veggies to ours, I added extra curry paste for that reason and still not as flavorful as I like.

This was quick and easy and a great dish to use up some fading veggies from your fridge.  I followed the recipe but used coconut palm sugar instead of white. I also made my own coconut milk rather than using canned. I added bamboo shoots, some mushrooms, yellow squash, celery and peas with the chicken.

I made it and we absolutely loved it. I did make a number of changes because there were a number of ingredients that I didn't have.  I used Patak Mild Red Curry Paste.  For both the dark soy sauce and the fish sauce I substituted a mixture of 3 tablespoons of ordinary soy sauce and 1 tablespoon of Teriyaki sauce,  I omitted the sugar.  Otherwise I followed the directions exactly.  My family told me not to dare make any changes to what I did as they thought it could not possibly be better.
I also tried making it using an equivalent weight of salmon cubes.  It was very good but very different.  The family liked it but preferred the version with chicken.  However, I plan to make both again.

The only things I omitted were the sugar (for health reasons) and the last bit of soy sauce (because I wanted to keep the green color).  The flavor was awesome.  I used "Thai Kitchen" brand curry, and it wasn't spicy at all which we like.  I also used lite coconut milk to keep the fat content down and added bite sized pieces of eggplant and string beans to increase the veggie quotient, and it was perfect...didn't miss out on the creaminess from the full fat coconut milk.  Thanks for sharing!

Made this with chicken breasts, added bell peppers, frozen veggies and basil. Halved the sugar like others suggested. I didn't add flour and just added a little soy sauce. Oh and I used Roland green curry which wasn't spicy so I added Thai chili paste for some spice. Overall I liked it and will make it again!

Super-easy; as is usually the case, the most time-consuming aspect was the pre-assembly chopping (garlic, chicken, etc.).

I used boneless chicken thighs because I think white meat is pointless. I went a little easy on the green curry paste for fear that it would be too spicy. That was my only mistake; mine wasn't even remotely spicy. But I just saw that one of the reviewers noted that the *brand* of curry paste you use makes a difference, so I'm not sure what advice to give on that front. (I was limited to exactly *one* option at my local grocery store.)

I'm thinking of using the same sauce for a fish-based dish.

Super easy dinner to make and definitely not too spicy.  If anything I would kick up the spice level with shiracha or hot pepper flakes.  I used a rotisserie chicken and saved a ton of time!  Great dish over brown rice

It turned out really great! It was perfect my family. I'm a sophomore in high school and was able to put this together so I'd say it was pretty easy. I added carrots at the end of the cooking process for something extra and they came out great.

Amazing recipe.  I usually like curry being a bit more flavorful and spicy but this is soothing and warm - great change. 


DIRECTIONS TO MAKE IT VEGITARIAN-VEGAN-GLUTEN FREE--  I used twice as much stor bought green curry paste and ginger as it called for, pinch more sugar and extra coconut milk, added zuchini, a red bell peper, and bamboo shoots.  We did this vegitarian and gluten free.. so corn starch instead of flour, tofu instead of chicken, amd tamari soy sauce.. use a deep fryer for the tofu if you have it or if not just peanut oil in a pan.  for the fish sauce substitute we used generous kelp powder (can get @ whole foods), and vegitable stock mixed in a shot glass but you could simmer to reduce.   We served with jasmin rice with a lottle sugar and salt. (which go together better than you think)

great recipe though, enjoy!

DELICIOUS.  We are foodies and found this recipe.  The basic ingredients to make this dish were exactly what we were looking for.  

We used Maesri brand Thai Green Curry Paste but did not find that it was too hot (we love spicy foods).  We always cook for an army, so we doubled the recipe (using only chicken thighs).  We added 3-4x the amount of curry paste (very generous amount) as it calls for, as well as had reduced the sugar.  We added other veggies as well:  cubed Japanese eggplant (sweated and partially steamed in the microwave... and added into pot towards the end), julienned Thai Basil, and bamboo shoots.  We also steamed fresh broccoli in the microwave for 3 minutes and added it to our plates and poured the Thai Green Chicken Curry right over it (we like to add broccoli this way so it stays crisp).

Great meal!  For a meal that cost a family of 5 about $25 in groceries that will feed us two nights, it was FANTASTIC!  Way cheaper than what our Thai restaurants charge us for a portion 1/4 the size!

It was GREAT!  I would scale back on the fish oil next time. Oh, and I added some red bell pepper to mine and it enhanced the flavor that much more.

Won't make it again. It's fast and easy, but the flavor was not dynamic and it became strangely greasy. I did like how the chicken was cooked and will use that technique of flour and soy sauce again in future stir fries.

I left out the soy sauce, per other reviews, and used part broth and part coconut milk - to save calories.  Pretty good.  I marinate my chicken for such dishes in yogurt, so it was quite tender and flavorful with the curry sauce.  I used a Green Thai sauce.

It was good, I did cut out the dark soy but I wish that I would've cut out the fish sauce as well. Something about the fish sauce made it taste off to me, which ended up with me making quite a few adjustments to cut back on the taste.

Great for beginners! I added a pepper bell, zucchini and green beans, also grated chilli to give it a bit more heat, tasted great! My boyfriend loved it, even took it to work the next day! Fab recipe will make it again!

I'm a little confused by the recipe. Other than the onions it calls for no veggies yet the picture shows peppers. Most curries I have had do include recipes. It would be great to know the right quantity to add. Any suggestions?

Yikes - really  yummy.  I had leftover pork tenderloin so I used that and served it on a bed of shredded cabbage.  My husband had rice noodles under his but since I am a bit on the pudgy side (wink wink) I opted for the cabbage and it turned out to be the best because it seemed that I undercooked the rice noodles and he had plenty to chew on!!!

A sweet, flavorful dish, with just a touch of spiciness, yet quite mild. Used Thai Kitchen brand of green curry. It tastes much better without the soy sauce and fish oil, everything else as is. No need to coat the chicken with flour. Although if you don't have cilantro or chives, it still tastes great.

I did modify this a bit, by adding quartered gold potatoes (which I parboiled, then simmered along with the curry sauce), plus some sliced bell pepper (stir fried at the beginning, then added right before removing the curry from the heat).

All of that said--the flavor of this curry is very good. As another commenter mentioned, it does seem like you spent more time building the layers of flavor than you actually did (which is always a plus!).

I served mine over steamed jasmine rice. The one issue I have with the recipe is that it's somewhat "heavy"...as in, rich. In future, I think I'll experiment with a 3-to-1 ratio of coconut milk and chicken broth, just to lighten up the curry sauce a bit.

Very yummy. Authenticity and spice level varies greatly depending upon what kind of green curry you use. I prefer to get my curry paste at an Asian market whenever possible.

Yummy!!! I added peas & carrots and as others suggested lemon grass and juice of 1 lime. Cut out 1 Tbl of soy sauce. Served over rice. It was delicious! Even my dog couldn't get enough! Will definitely be making this many more times.

This recipe is wonderful!!  Also, when I don't have the time I personally love the thai green curry paste from rawspicebar- they make it fresh right before delivering and is truly the most authentic paste I've found- even better than making myself and far less time consuming for those harried days!

First Thai curry dish I've made that tastes like real Thai!  I added tofu and bell pepper while cooking chicken. Slicing fresh tomato wedges to top along with the cilantro was the finishing touch.

This was a big hit with the family.  It wasn't spicy at all but that may be attributed to the green curry paste I used as mentioned by others.  It was beige more than green so I may omit the soy sauce at the end.  I used ginger powder as I didn't have fresh ginger available and it seemed fine.  Pretty easy overall and quite tasty.  This recipe was saved to my recipe box per the request of my family.

First time making this. I added broccoli I and carrots, doubled curry paste, added additional hot curry powder (it wasn't hot enough) as well as thai chili peppers and it was really delicious! The curry paste I used must not be very spicy so I'll be looking for a different brand.

It was brown not green.  There was way too much salt.  The chicken never got tender. There is NO spice at all. I didn't taste ANYTHING like curry.

It just wasn't spicy or flavorful enough for our taste, which could be the fault of the prepared green curry paste.  Next time, I'll make my own green curry paste, to ensure that it's nice and spicy.  But all in all, a delicious dish.

This was very easy, but really lacked the kick you expect from Thai food.  I will use a different curry paste next time, cut the sugar by at least half (possibly more), and add some bamboo, carrots and zucchini, and will likely use thighs instead of breasts  (or possibly use both, but slice the breast MUCH thinner).  Otherwise, this was very tasty and I will definitely make again.

I really enjoyed this recipe! I made a few changes, mainly due to what I had available: I used leek and red onion instead of green onion, I omitted the fish sauce, I used cane sugar instead of white, and I used red curry paste instead of green. I would probably follow other suggestions and reduce the sugar next time (perhaps using 1 tbsp). I served this with boiled potatoes.

I would add more curry and I used red curry paste instead of green because that was what was in my fridge already. I also cut back the sugar to 1.5 tbsp and it was great! The boys loved it so  we will be making this again.

This recipe was both easy and delicious, and earns five stars from me because everyone in my family enjoyed it--including my six year old daughter who hates everything I put in front of her that isn't a french fry. The sauce was really creamy and flavorful, though as other reviewers have said the dark soy sauce makes it more of a brown curry than a green one. By the way, there is a difference between dark soy sauce and the stuff you buy in a supermarket--dark soy sauce is sweeter and thicker and can usually only be found in Asian markets. I think this would be a very different curry if you substituted regular soy sauce. 

I used just one can of coconut milk to make it simple, and my own homemade green curry paste that I had in my freezer. I also added a splash of lemon. You could dress this up by adding sugar snap peas or bamboo shoots (I added sugar snap peas) or even make it vegetarian by using chickpeas instead of chicken. Delicious! I favorited this one in my recipe software.

This was very good.  I hate fish sauce so I left that out and it was still good.  I followed the directions as described for the rest.  Goes well with Jasmine rice or any other rice!

This was excellent.  So easy and soooooo tasty.  It's not very often my husband will give 5 stars but he did with this one.  My only change was leaving out the onions because my husband doesn't like them.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly as written.

The sauce here makes an excellent base -- and you can use whatever ingredients you want! I used tofu, Japanese eggplant (smaller, skinnier, more flavorful than regular eggplant), red pepper, broccoli, and carrots. Husband said it was one of the best dishes I'd ever made. You may have to add more green curry paste (I did), depending on the intensity of the brand you're using. Also added a dash cayenne for extra kick. Sounds like I totally changed the recipe, but I followed the sauce part exactly and it was just like in the restaurants.

I tried this recipe for the first time and fell in love - I have been looking for a simple, delicious Thai curry recipe for ages and this fits the bill. I added red and yellow peppers to the recipe, and have also tried it out with tofu and it has not failed. As it uses the pre made curry paste it can easily be adapted to use the yellow or red pastes if you like a little fire

My whole family loves this recipe including our 2 and 4 year old. Made some adjustments though as it needs veggies.  Also made with bone-on Chicken thighs (did not dice) and they were delicious!  Added Matchstick Carrots, Mushrooms and 1/2 bag of defrosted Frozen Broccoli.  Omitted Fish Sauce as we didn't have any and it was still delicious!  This is definitely going in our cooking binder.

Very good! I will definitely make this one again. It wasn't nearly as hot as i anticipated, though. I think I will  try a different brand of green curry than i used next time(thai Kitchens) as an other person suggested.

a little too thick for me, I thinned with chicken broth; would use lite coconut milk next time ;
using 1 Tbsp of curry was just right for my kids

I added onion and peppers to make full meal - will definitely make again;

no soy sauce in sauce
consider adding basil

This is a great recipe but I made a couple of changes. Like other users I only added one tablespoon of sugar. I also added fresh lemongrass and fresh basil. There's already some lemongrass in green curry paste but adding some fresh really amps up the authenticity and flavor.

love this.  I used red curry, pressed garlic liberally.  I also used asparagus and broccoli.  Sugar was perfect.  I might use more coconut milk next time, and more curry for heat.  Even my kids liked this dish!

My husband and I make this a lot, its our favorite after the pineapple curry. We use turkey breast dredged in cornstarch instead of chicken, just for a change of protein. Yummy!

I added bamboo strips, and didn't include fish sauce (since I couldn't find it at store). Still it was really good and impressive. Comparable to the taste of the same dish from a thai restaurant.  for the green curry paste part, I added more than the recommended amount, but still it was not as spicy as I expected.

Really really good! Added in a green bell pepper to increase the vegetable content, I reduced the curry paste to 1.5 tbsp, substituted light coconut milk, and it was delicious. Thanks for a great recipe.

This recipe is def a keeper. I love Thai food and it taste just like if you were to order it at a restaurant. My husband even told me that it taste better than a restaurant. I added pan fried tofu instead of the chicken and it was still delicious. You can add whatever veggies that you want. I added bell pepper, mushrooms, bamboo shoots, and baby corn. I read the reviews beforehand and didn't add the the extra tbsp of soy. This is def going into the weekly dinner rotation.

Fantastic.  I've made this with both chicken and fish.  Vary the amount of curry sauce to control the spice level.

Delicious!  I added bamboo shoots, green bell pepper, baby corn, onion and water chestnuts.  The amount of curry paste depends on what kind you use, but I used a paste made by Lobo (which I found in an asian market) and 2 Tbsp. was very spicy.  And we like spicy food.  I also cut the sugar back to 1 Tbsp. and used low sodium soy sauce.

I loved this recipe!!! Very flavoful!! I added a little extra soy as the salt needed adjusting to me. That could be my fault as well for using low-sodium soy sauce... LOL! Other than that, perfect!

Quite tasty, but, not hot enough for our liking.  Next time I think I'll double the curry paste.  I also substituted fresh basil for the cilantro and added some sugar peas.  Will definitely make it again.

I followed the recipe (mostly); added some asparagus and strips of red pepper when adding the garlic, ginger and scallions, and used 1 T raw sugar as opposed to 2T of white.  We LOVED this recipe.  I served this with Thai red rice mixed with a little brown rice.

I made this with a few changes - added more vegetables, used tofu instead of chicken, etc.The green curry paste I used was not spicy, so I added the entire 2 Tbsps -  it gave it a great kick!  I did follow some of the reviewers advice and used 1/2 the amount of sugar and less soy sauce. I served it over fragrant jasmine rice. The end result was DELICIOUS!

Tastes just like the Thai restaurant I love.  The only exception is this recipe doesn't include eggplant.  I also prefer my Thai food a bit more spicy.

I LOVE this recipe. You can use breast or thighs. Be generous with your curry paste, ginger and garlic. I add a chopped yellow onion. Cut back a bit on the fish sauce...you definitely should use it because it gives the curry a very round and authentic complexity...but you don't want to actually TASTE fish sauce in the meal. Don't skip the cilantro....the dish begs for it. I also have added a can of bamboo shoots... Try this dish. You'll be glad you did!

wow this tasted almost exactly like what I hoped!  Usually I don't have very good results with recipes here but this was pretty simple and turned out really tasty.  Serve with rice and veggies maybe to balance it out a bit, it's very filling on its own

This was a great recipe.  It tasted almost exactly like the curry I had last week from a Thai restaurant.  I used Thai Kitchen green curry (half the small bottle), used brown sugar to taste, and left out the fish sauce.  Some of the other posters complained about not having a green color, but I have made this twice and have some suggestions.  The first time I made it, the color was brown and looked more like an Indian curry instead of thai, even though it tasted great.  The second time I made it I 1) cooked the chicken in a separate pan, 2) sauted the garlic, onion and ginger first, then added curry paste, stirring for just a few seconds, 3) added the chicken, stirred a couple of times, finally 4) added the coconut milk, soy sauce and sugar.  I let it simmer while the rice cooked and it turned out perfect.  Next time I will add vegetables to make it a bit more of a meal.

So yummy, better then on Koh San Road! I add zuchini, brocolli and mushrooms. I also add a stalk of lemon grass while it's cooking,  and a squeeze of lime, and sprinkle of fresh cilantro before serving.

This recipe is restaurant quality!  I have made some thai dishes before that don't really taste like what you can get eating out, but this was fantastic! I added bell peppers, and would maybe add some thai chilies for spice  (my green curry paste is not hot) I also add Avacado at the end.. it's wonderful with green curry! Easy to make, and delicious! Enjoy!!

Very good, even without fish sauce and with a bit too much ginger (wow!).  If you make it a bit too hot (like I did) so jasmine rice and naan really help to calm the heat...oh so good...naan...mmmm.  The whole reason I made this was for an excuse to use naan and jasmine rice to sop up some tasty sauce, and it was worth it!!

Outstanding, Made this a couple of times,added asparagus, mange tout & baby corn. Did not add as much green curry paste, as my husband does not like it too hot. Nevertheless. I would highly recommend this recipe.

Very good recipe.  My husband and I would not roll the chicken in soy sauce first, made a bit too strong of a soy flavor.  The chicken browned is a wonderful idea.  We chopped a bell pepper and a yellow onion and it was a great addition to an already great recipe.  We will be serving this to guests very soon.

This was very good. I really like it. First time I made it, wasn't spicy enough. This time I made it, I doubled the curry paste. MUCH better. Oh, and I left out the soy sauce. Didn't use any. The kids even liked it better with double the curry paste. Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe is sooo good! I've made it several times already, and just found it a little while ago. I did alter the amount of coconut milk, because I only had one can, and I think it tastes great with that amount. It has a good consistency too. I haven't tried it with fish sauce yet, ( though I might later ) I just always forget to buy it, and I think it tastes great w/o it.   Also,  my husband isn't a big rice fan, and I like trying to lower carbs anywhere I can, so I serve it with some stir fried shredded cabbage. Wonderful! Oh, one more thing. I tried making this with low fat/cal coconut milk, and didn't notice any difference in the flavor, and I'm pretty sure it was about half the calories:)

I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could!!! It is fantastic as is! The only thing I would mention is that the first time I made it I used low fat coconut milk (it turned out great) but the second time I made it I used regular coconut milk and it was so much richer. However, for calorie counters, the low fat coconut milk works just fine. I would actually recommend doubling the recipe as I made it for three people and there were NO leftovers!!

Excellent! I've tried to make Thai curries many times, and this is the first time I thought it was truly an authentic tasting meal. I followed the recipe almost exactly, only swapping out chicken thighs for the breast meat, and using 1 TBS of brown sugar instead of the 2 TBS of white sugar. At the end of the cooking time (and after I tasted how good it was!) I did add some peas and some sliced bamboo shoots to make it more of a complete meal, but it would have been good without. I also served it over brown jasmine rice to add a bit more fiber to the meal. I'll definitely be making this again, thanks!

Excellent recipe! I had everything but the green onion and fish oil on hand so instead I used onion, red bell pepper and celery. I used maybe 1 tbls of the curry and it ended up being too much. I recently found out maple syrup can help cut spice so I used some and also added a bit more soy sauce and it ended up perfect. My husband actually said it was as good as any of the curry dishes at our fave Thai restaurant, which says a lot cuz that restaurant is amazing!

fan-flipping-tastic...well worth the prep work and time it took.  we quadrupled the recipe and it still turned out great with lots left over to freeze up.  we've used the frozen portions and they were just as good.  we added some veggies, zucchini and long green beans as this is how we are used to it.  this recipe is definitely a keeper.

I always have bad luck when attempting curry chicken, but THANKS TO YOU, I finally found a winning recipe!!  This was actually more flavorful than at my favorite Thai restaurant!  I used three tablespoons of Thai Kitchen Green Curry Paste, and in turn made a heavenly dish! THANK YOU, THANK YOU!

I was afraid of making curry for the first time but everything turned out perfect. Only used 1 tbsp of curry because I dont like spicy things. While the garlic and curry were simmering I threw in some chopped carrots and sweet onion. I wanted a thicker sauce so in the end I added a little bit of corn starch. I had to make extra rice because I refused to throw away the leftovers.

I made this last night for supper and it was wonderful.  I marinated the chicken soy sauce for a while then cooked it very slowly in the microwave as I was going out. 
Took a very little time to put all the other ingredients together before adding the chicken back in.  Did not feel it needed the sugar.  Did add baby corn and sliced water chestnuts for some texture.
This one is a keeper, thank you.

Pretty awesome!  I will make this again but I didn't think it was necessary to coat the chicken in the flour and soy.

I used Thai Kitchen Green Curry Paste and the heat was definately lacking.

(Update: I make this all the time and is one of the top recipes I have found on this site!)

This was absolutely fantastic!!  The sauce was so addictive.  I increased the curry to 3 Tablespoons, but it really is a matter of taste.  Served with jasmine rice and stir fried peppers.

Great recipe....
As previously discussed the amount of curry paste should be adjusted due to personal taste and brand used. I added one additional teaspoonful. I also decreased the fish sauce slightly.
I also added the following ingredients: 
1/2 c peas
1/2 c string beans
1/2 c chick peas
1/4 c pine nuts (added at the end to give a little crunch).

For me this was just ok. The flavor was alright, but a little mild.  Thge consistency, however, was WAY too thick. I don't think we'll be having this again any time soon.

Served this for company and everyone loved it.  I accidentally used fish sauce instead of soy before dredging in flour and it tasted fine!  Will def make again.

A very tasty curry dish, although it requires more curry than called for to really bring out the flavor.

This recipe has a nice flavor, but I used Thai Kitchen brand green curry paste and it was not anywhere near "spicy" even though I added two-three times the amount of paste called for in the recipe.  Next time I am going to try to find Mae Ploy brand which I hope will have real flavor.  I think possibly with the right curry paste this recipe could be five stars.

I loved this recipe.  Make sure you have all your ingredients ready to use because timing can be tricky but very easy overall.  I also added bamboo shoots, baby corn and water chestnuts.  Oh man.  I'm drooling again.

Really good, didnt have green onions, so used a regular one, plus added a sliced red pepper and some mushrooms I had on hand.  May use slightly less curry paste next time (I didnt measure carefully - verrry hot!)  All in all, a keeper.  Dont forget the white rice!

Amazing curry dish!!  Definitely restaurant quality.  We took the advice of several people and served this with jasmine rice and increased the amount of green curry paste (to about 1 1/2 tbs).  This made it about the same level as a medium spicy dish at most Thai places...perfect for me, but a bit too much for young kids and people who like things more mild.  We also added zucchini, squash, and a little bit of red bell pepper.

I just made this recipe for dinner and I must say - it was AWESOME! My hubby and I love asian food and we are really picky but this recipe was so authentic - better than the asian restaurants. I was worried about it being too sweet so I added only 1 tbsp. of sugar and I added green pepper just to add a veggie. I poured it over basmati rice and it was so good!!! Next time we'll add chick peas, tofu and maybe some cashews. Thank you for the recipe! If you love asian food - MAKE THIS RECIPE!!!

I tried this recipe out for the first time with my boyfriend and we loved it.  I had brought back some thai green curry paste from thailand and wasn't sure exactly what to do with it, but this dish was perfect.

Mmmm... We LOVED this! I don't like things to be too spicy (as I know that some Thai foods are spicier than I can handle) and this was perfect. I even added more of the green curry paste than the recipe called for and it was so good! My kids even liked it! Great recipe!

I added a couple of shallots and two serranos (I know they're not thai, but I like things very hot. Asian markets might have thai peppers.) I also reduced the sugar to about 1 tbsp and served it over brown rice. It turned out really well.

This was wonderful! The only reason that I gave it 4 stars was because this was my first attempt at making any kind of Curry. It was sooo simple and really delicious. I did add some veggies (chopped broccoli, water chestnuts and red peppers) for some extra flavor and color. 
Excellent!
