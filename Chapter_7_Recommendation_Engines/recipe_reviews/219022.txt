I love baking with buttermilk because always produces a tender muffin.   I am sure that this recipe calls for too much flour.   I find that 2 cups is ample and this way do not have to add more liquid.   Also suggest using an ex. large egg.   Hope this helps

I made these blueberry muffins by folding two cups of fresh blueberries into the batter when I added the dry ingredients. I sprinkled a little sugar over each muffin before baking. Very good. I'll try these again with chopped Granny Smith apples and apple pie spice.

Just a comment for everybody on the stiffness - it is a pretty stiff batter, but one thing that might help is that I weigh my flour - 303 grams is about 2 1/4 cups for me, but your flour may be heavier/more packed! Try weighing out 303 grams and see if that helps. :) Thanks!

The first time I made this recipe it turned out dry. The second time I made it I changed the quanity and omitted a few ingred. Here's what I did the second time around; I let the butter soften instead of melting, omitted the baking powder but did use 1 tsp baking soda, used 2/3 cup of buttermilk, 1 1/2 cup of all purpose flour, 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp of nutmeg and instead of whisking I used my kitchen aid. I creamed the butter and sugar together, added the egg and vanilla extract and beat til smooth. I did not sift the dry ingredients. I alternated  the buttermilk with the dry ingredients. Sprayed baking Pam into the muffin pans. I filled each 2/3 full and topped with Jan's Crumb Topping or Streusel. Baked at 350 degrees for 15 minutes. They came out moist and very tastey!

Great basic recipe. I reduced the flour to 2 cups per another reviewer. >>> 03/02/12 APPLE MUFFINS: Added 1 cup peeled/chopped apple, 1/2 cup raisins & 1/2 tsp cinnamon. Very, very good. Next time I'll up the cinnamon to 3/4 tsp. >>> 03/06/12 DATE NUT MUFFINS: Replaced white sugar w/brown, reduced nutmeg to 1/4 tsp. Added 1 cup chopped dates (which I soaked in 3 Tb hot water), 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 cup walnuts & 1/2 cup raisins. Perfect!

This really is exactly what the recipe title states:  a basic muffin.  It's light, moist, and the perfect base for embellishing however you'd like.  I added chopped apples and some cinnamon to the batter and then before baking, sprinkled the tops with a cinnamon-sugar mixture.  As instructed, I filled the muffin batter almost to the top and ended up with ten nice-sized  muffins.  Good recipe.

I followed the directions exactly, then added 1 tsp cinnamon, chopped apples, and some raisins. The flavor is good, but, as another reviewer noted, the batter is VERY stiff. I added about 1/4 C more buttermilk. Still very stiff, and possibly now over-mixed. Only baked about 17 minutes, and they were still dry. I'll try again, but I'll adjust the flour.

Knew it would be raining by morning and wanted to start DH's day with a bit of sunshine.  So, now these are my sunshine muffins! Please know that the dough is VERY stiff and if I had not added about another 1/4 cup of buttermilk, the blueberries I added would have been destroyed if they had not been frozen.  These muffins have a delightful flavor.  DH took 3 to work for AM coffee break and just called to tell me to save this recipe.  Done!  I'm making some to go in DD's freezer and using the suggested chopped apples and cinnamon.  BIG hit!  BIG, thank you!!!

I had buttermilk to use and actually found this recipe by a beautiful picture that lutzflcat posted on 31, Dec.  The muffin is nice and moist and held it's shape nicely.  I also had huge blackberries to use, so I added those to this recipe.  My regular size muffin tins must be smaller than other regular size tins as I got 18 muffins from this recipe.  Nice base for a muffin and as the submitter suggests, very easy to add your own "add-ins".

This is a great base! I prefer using whole wheat flour so I used 2 cups. And I  switched out the white sugar for cane sugar. 1 tsp of cinnamon. 1 cup of blueberries and 1/2 a cup of chopped pecans. They turned out moist and delicious! Cant wait to try with other fruit! Thanks DCKatie!

Given some reviewers' remarks that these were dry, floury and/or had a chemical aftertaste, I experimented with some modifications to this recipe that I believe they would be as happy with as I was.  I reduced the flour from 2-1/4 cups by a quarter cup, to 2 cups.  This took care of the too dry and floury problem as did increasing the butter from 1/4 to 1/3 cup.  More important, as for the chemical aftertaste,  the unnecessary and excessive amounts of baking powder and baking soda explained why.  I reduced both by half. One half tsp. of baking soda and 1 tsp. baking powder eliminated any potential for an unpleasant aftertaste and the muffins still rose very nicely with that significantly reduced amount.  I added a good cup of blueberries and eliminated the nutmeg.  Mine needed a few minutes more than the 18 minutes indicated in the recipe.  I (as well as Hubs and a breakfast guest this morning) was very pleased with the results.  These were pretty to look at, making them very inviting.  They rose well with nicely rounded tops and had absolutely no chemical aftertaste.  The reduced amount of flour and the extra bit of butter ensured these would be moist.  Buttery good and chock full of plump blueberries (I used frozen), this is easily a 5-star recipe with the above-mentioned modifications. As is, however, a chemical aftertaste from too much leavener would not be "ok" (a 3-star rating) - hence, my rating of two stars.

These were moist and delicious.  I found the batter way too stiff until I added the fruit but after that it looked more like muffin batter and less like cookie dough.  I would recommend watching the time as I left them in for only 16 minutes and they were still a little overdone.  I added almond extract and cherry preserves and topped with sliced almonds.

This is a solid, basic recipe that lends itself beautifully to creativity.  I added 1/2 cup of Craisins, 1/2 cup white chocolate chips and 2 tsp dried orange rind.  I especially like the fact the muffin isn't too sweet so depending on what you add this could be a good option for breakfast.  Thanks, DCKatie

A very good basic muffin recipe. The only change I did was to cut the flour down to 2 cups (as suggested by others).  After mixing batter, I divided it in half, adding mini chocolate chips to first half & on tops of muffins. . .AND then to the other half, I added 1/2 cup peeled/chopped Granny Smith apple and cinnamon/sugar sprinkled on top.  Used paper liners, and they did not stick at all.  A very nice, light-textured muffin (I got 12 regular size).  Next time, I may add some cinnamon to the batter.  A keeper recipe.

So good! I will use this recipe forever. I was looking for a recipe that I could use my leftover whey from making my own yogurt with and this worked perfect since you can use whey as a substitute for buttermilk. :-) The first time I made these, I used whole wheat flour and put blueberries in. Had to bake a few min longer, but turned out so good! Second time, I'm using regular flour and blackberries and substituted cinnamon for the nutmeg. I'm sure they will be just as delicious! Great basic recipe that's easy to adjust to your own taste!

DCKatie is correct in Saying this is a good basic muffin that can be adapted.  I used lemon extract in place of the vanilla and added 1 tablespoon of lemon zest.  To the final batter added one cup of frozen blueberries, I added a little chopped nuts to the muffin tops before popping in the oven.  These cooked to perfection with beautiful high peaks.  Thank you for sharing I will certainly be baking these again.

The batter was very stiff. I added 1/3c more buttermilk to make a more normal muffin batter then added 1C of blueberries and baked at 375deg. for 18 minutes but had to add on 4 more minute. Next time I will bake at 400deg which is a more normal baking temp. for muffins. Final product was good at best.

Awesome, light, moist muffins.  Mixed 1C diced pears into sifted flour, with a dash of cinnamon (yes, flour before adding the liquids) and substituted honey for the sugar.  Taste GREAT.

I really enjoyed these!  Had some buttermilk to use up and didn't want to do pancakes again and found this!  Threw in some frozen mixed berries from the freezer to use up and skipped the nutmeg (didn't think it would go).  Yummy!  Thanks for sharing!

If you find that any recipe is sticking to your paper liners you can lightly spray them with pan release spray and they'll peel right off.

The texture of these muffins is great, but the flavor is not quite there.  If I were going to make them another time, I would cut back a bit on the nutmeg and add more salt.  We did blueberry with lemon zest and chocolate chips with walnut.  The blueberry were better than the chocolate chip.  I have the large muffin tins and these made six nicely formed muffins.

I don't agree with other reviewers that there is too much flour.  This makes a very thick batter, but the muffins bake up moist with a large crumb and slightly coarse texture.  Less flour would make them more like a cupcake - also good, but not how a muffin should be.

My family loves this recipe! So far I've tried apple cinnamon, blueberry, spinach & feta, double chocolate, and (my son's favorite) banana chocolate chip. The simplicity makes it perfect for experimenting.

I made these and used whole wheat pastry flour instead of all purpose.  Perhaps that's why they came out strange.  Not sure.  They made beautiful muffins but the flavor left me wanting... Something. For me they were just okay.

I tinkered slightly. Used only 2 cups of flour. Accidentally added 1 cup of sugar instead of 1/2 cup. Added 1/2 teaspoon cardamon to the cinnamon. I used 1 cup of golden raisins and 1 cup of chopped pecans. Once baked, I brushed on leftover buttermilk glaze from the "Cafeteria Lady Cake" that can be found in "From Our Grandmothers' Kitchens" (America's Test Kitchen). The resulting muffins were incredible! Because of the bulk of my add-in's I ended up with 16 muffins.

I followed the directions exactly and once my dry ingredients were mixed together, i removed 1/2 cup into another bowl to avoid too dry a batter. I then mixed in my wet ingredients and scooped that into my muffin cups. 
Feeling like the muffins could use a little something extra and not having any blueberries in the house, plus not wanting to waste the remaining 1/2 c. of dry ingredients, i dedided to use it in a streusel topping. I added 1/4 c. butter, 2 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg, 1/2 c. chopped walnuts, 1 TB brown sugar, and crumbled it all together and topped the muffins with this. They were moist and my husband loved them.

Made these twice at Christmas time. First time followed recipe as written with the following add-ons: 1 chopped apple and about 1/2 cup each of cranberries and chopped walnuts. Delicious. Second time followed the recipe with the same add-ons as before but omitted sugar and gave some to a diabetic couple at church. Came out kind of biscuit-like but still quite good, especially with honey butter. Recipe can be tweaked so many ways...it's a winner!

Great recipe. Easy to follow instructions. I followed recipe, I didn't add any extra ingredients. Just don't over mix batter. I got twelve muffins which were moist. Yum.

I love the simplicity and versatility of the recipe. I added strawberries at the request of my two-year-old. The batter is very thick, but it baked wonderfully. We really like how they are subtly sweet with the hint of nutmeg. This recipe made 18 standard-sized muffins - I filled the papers pretty full. I baked them Saturday evening and as of Monday morning only two are left!!

I didn't read the reviews so I followed it exactly, subbing choc chips. The batter was thick but really good flavour. I will add more buttermilk next time but this is a great muffin base recipe.

I really like these muffins. They were super easy to make, and I like that they are so versatile. I only used 2 cups of flour as suggested in another submitter, and am glad I did. I also used 1 teaspoon of cinnamon in place of the nutmeg (I didn't have any), and substituted half the white sugar with brown sugar. In half of the batter, I added some chopped up craisins. In the other half, I add some mini chocolate chips and a healthy squirt of honey. After spooning the batter into a muffin tin, I sprinkled the craisin muffins with a little bit of sugar (also suggested by another submitter). When they came out of the oven, they were perfect! Thank you so much for submitting this recipe; these are now my go- to muffins! :)

Great muffins!  I added blueberries, white chocolate chips and a little lemon extract.  I didn't use the nutmeg - I don't care for it.  I forgot to set the timer so I ended up cooking them a lot longer than I normally would have - but it ended up being a good thing!  The tops were nice and crunchy!

Overall a great recipe, however, I don't care for the nutmeg as a base for other ingredients.  Once I omit the nutmeg it's a great foundation for any type of muffin I can dream up.

My husband doesn't like berries, so I exchanged the blueberries for walnuts. I replaced the white sugar with brown. Super yummy, but a little dry. I'd cut a little flour next time.

I used this recipe to make extra-large muffins. I added frozen blueberries and baked them for about 27 minutes at 375 degrees. They were very good. However, I should have read the reviews first because the dough was so dry that I had trouble incorporating all of the flour.  Next time, I'll reduce the flour to 2 cups and increase the buttermilk by 1/8 - 1/4  cup.

Reduced flour to 2 cups per others suggestions. Also,  added grated lemon zest.  Added coarse sugar on top would have been a nice touch, but forgot.  These were the best out of 3 recipes for blueberry muffins I have tried.

I loved that it wasn't very sweet, but the dough was so thick it was hard to pan into the muffin cups....I probably will not make again - the taste was very good though.

I made these just as written and found them just ok. I don’t usually add nutmeg to a blueberry muffin and maybe that was one of the reasons the taste just wasn’t the best to me. Some say they turned out dry, but I didn’t have that problem. I also don’t usually like the addition of baking soda when there is already baking powder used. But I think you should always make a recipe as written to express an opinion of it. I will try this one again but with a few changes, then, of course, it will not be the same recipe, will it?  I wish people would stop rating a recipe when they actually never made it.

This recipe is great. I'll probably make it again. I'd like people to know that the one cup of apples in it (cook's note) could not be identified by family members. I'd recommend putting more in. Also, if you put spices in (like cinnamon) put them in the dry 
ingredients bowl before it's too late to add it.

Simple recipe. I had cranberries and eggnog on hand which I substituted for buttermilk and blueberries. I sprinkled white sugar on top, just a little to compliment the tartness of the berries. Yum!

This was an okay basic recipe.  I had to add several things to this to get the moist flavorful muffin I was going for.  As it  is written, the recipe was dry (too much flour or not enough liquid) I added sour cream, ditched the butter for oil, and added vanilla bean paste instead of plain vanilla.  I also added fruit juices to get a pop of flavor and subbed out some of the flour for cocoa ( this with the sour cream makes a knock your socks off double chocolate muffin)   Just be aware that this one needs some work to make it impressive.
I added 1/4 cup sour cream, subbed out the butter for oil, added an extra tsp of what ever extract you are using and extra cinnamon, nutmeg, or pumpkin pie spice is nice.

These were very dry - and I did follow the suggestion of a few other reviewers by reducing the flour to 2 cups and I added another 1/4 cup of buttermilk. They were still quite dry and bland.

I've made this recipe twice and love the basic recipe.  The first time I added blueberries that I dusted with flour and cinnamon.  The second time, I subbed 1/4 cup dark cocoa powder for 1/4 cup flour and added 1 cup of chocolate chips to make some rich chocolatey chocolate chocolate chip muffins. I did leave out the nutmeg for the chocolate chip muffins.
Both times, I subbed a scant 1/4 cup whole wheat flour  for part of the white flour.    I also added a half cup of applesauce based on reviews about decreasing the flour.  I think the muffins would have been fine without the added moisture from the applesauce.

I guess I should have read the reviews first. The "batter" turned out more like a dough than a batter. Only difference I made to the recipe was that I added an extra half a teaspoon  vanilla. OK recipe but won't be making again

I didn't have buttermilk so I substituted 1/2cp milk and 1/2cp of sourcream. I used strawberries and put about a teaspoon of lemon juice on them just to bring out the flavor. Otherwise I did everything else to the letter. Yummy! They came out great! This is a quick and easy recipe that you can add any fruit to. Will definitely use this one again!!

Yikes. These did not work for me. The batter was so dry I just had to add 1/4 cup more of buttermilk. In my opinion there is just too much flour in this recipe. I usually read many reviews before trying a recipe and I didn't this time. Wish I did. I added blueberries to mine but the flavour of the "biscuit muffin" just isn't there. I understand what everyone means by the muffin sticking to the paper. Only half the actual muffin comes out whole. I won't be making these again. Sorry DCKatie.

I also used 2 cups of flour only and added 1 cup of dark choc chips. The recipe yielded 12 muffins and 18 mini muffins. Also found that the muffin stuck to the paper, will definitely use spray and cook next time. All in all a great recipe that's definitely a keeper!

Beautiful muffins, and they taste great. They do come apart pretty badly when you try to separate them from the muffin liner papers. I would try using a greased muffin tin next time.
