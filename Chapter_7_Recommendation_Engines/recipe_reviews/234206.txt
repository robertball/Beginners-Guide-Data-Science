These are great - I've made them before and they're always a hit.  The only thing I would change in the recipe is the 1/2 cup of butter.  It says half should be used to grease the pan...that's quite a lot.

I used 1/4 cup to melt into the marshmallows then pressed out the squares onto parchment so I didn't use the other butter called for.  Turned out perfect.  I also always just add a generous pinch of salt to take a little of the sweetness and I let the butter brown just slightly to give them a hint of a caramel flavor.  Delicious!

Family loved it.
I used only Fruit Loops.  That's all I had on hand... Was a hit !
