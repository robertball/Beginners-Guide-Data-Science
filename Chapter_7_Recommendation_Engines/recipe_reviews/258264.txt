1 hour 15 minutes is waaaaaaay too long to bake this cake. I got nervous and pulled the plug at 1 hour and it was rock hard and completely inedible.

1h15 was too long for the bake.  Mine was done after 45min, and even then was a little overbaked.  Nice, light recipe. Next time, Iâ€™d add some citrus and replace the vanilla.  A lovely light cake.

Good results.I would make it again. I made a small change by using berry sugar instead of regular sugar
