It was decent but it was way too much spice packed into it. Every bite was strange and it was just slapping me in the face. I think it could've been saltier with some more salt and pepper and maybe half of each dose of spices. Also I would add 3x more beef bouillon as well. Not too big a fan of this

I made it with lemon tilapia and it turned out great! My 9 year old son LOVES cinnamon so we were looking for something new to try and this caught his eye. He gives it his stamp of approval too.

Not bad.  Nothing to write home about. I followed the recipe very closely.

I had to add a little more beef bouillon to ours to get the flavors we were looking for but enjoyed the flavor of cinnamon in this dish - I think I'd make some naan or something like that to serve it with next time. The lemon really helped brighten the dish up!
