If you love artichokes and spinach, this is a soul and craving satisifying dish!  Add some cheese, preferably italian, to the bechamel sauce.  It will make it even more cheezy.  I used monzarella and provolone - grated of course!

This is so good, but I would never have leftover srtichoke spinach at our house :)  I did this as directed and used Chef John's White sauce. Simple to follow. Rich & delicious! Definitely company worthy too! Thanks for sharing Chef John!

This is a wonderful dish - even with substitutions. Great way to get family to have some veggies. I have made this several times, as written and with variations depending on what I have available. Not having the dip, I made some with artichoke hearts and frozen broccoli, cream cheese, and ricotta. Doubled the recipe and used jar Alfredo sauce on half and red sauce on the other half. Son-in law even got up to raid the refrigerator and finished off the few remaining shells.

I made this and my husband and I LOVED it!!!!!!.  I made 1/2 the recipe with jarred alfredo sauce, and the other half with a tomato & basil, and it was fabulous.  Although my husband & I prefer the alfredo sauce over the red. Will definitely make again.  This is a winner if you have guests coming over for dinner and you are looking to impress.

Friends stopped by and got to taste these shells. 4 out of 5 wanted 3rds. Used cheese suggested in recipe and it was worth it. Perfect balance of flavors. Used the basic beschemel recipe from AR and it was just right for this recipe. I din't know I could eat so many shells! So good.

Wait. What? Spinach and artichoke dip as a main dish? Yes please, and pass me some more. -- I made this with Chef John's dip recipe as well as his white sauce recipe. It was excellent with no changes.

My artichoke dip that I used was not a good match for this.  It had too much crunch and was sweet so be careful what you pick!  I tried it again with my own recipe and it was better.

Whole family loved it. Very rich! I made chef Johns white sauce.
