These were tasty!  After watching the video, I decided to use a silicone baking mat to make these, but only had one, and was making two pans of potatoes.  On the other pan, I used a sheet of parchment, and lo and behold, the potatoes on the parchment paper turned out much crispier and tastier.  I wouldn't go buy a silicone mat just for this recipe - try the parchment!

These are like sophisticated steak fries.  Delicious and so easy.  A nice departure from baked potatoes, and a perfect side to grilled meats.  I placed the cut wedges in a ziplock bag to toss with the olive oil and seasoning.  Since I don't have one of those fancy baking mats, I used Reynolds Non-stick foil to line a cookie sheet.  Also, I didn't see a need to turn these midway through the bake time.  I simply let the wedges stand on their own, skin side down.  They crisped up perfectly.  You know they're close to done when you hear them start to sizzle in the oven.  Keep an eye on them so they don't burn.  When I pulled them out, I gave them a little pinch of extra salt.  I suggest going very easy on the pepper, if at all.  Personally, I think it takes away from the heavenly aroma of the herbs de Provence.  Thanks Chef John!  You brought another winner to my recipe box.

These potatoes are heavenly!!! I found the herbs Dr Provence in a packet for a chicken/potatoes mix because I couldn't find them by themselves. They turned out awesome!!! The aroma while they were baking and the smell of the house afterwards was so good. I made them for a party so I used 10 potatoes and people could not stop talking about how tasty they were...or stop eating them ;) The combination of the "herbs" with the salt, pepper, and paprika were absolutely the best combination I've ever tasted on a potato. Thank you tons for this gloriously simple and wonderful recipe!!!! :)

We love wedge potatoes and have them often. I experiment using different seasonings. I make my own herbs de Provence because I find that some commercial brands get a little heavy handed with the fennel which comes across a bit to strong with the licorice taste. We have these quite often with burgers instead of fries, or with pork chops. I cut mine into 8 wedges instead of 6 because they come out more crispy. They are also good when you add Parmesan cheese to the mix.

These are delicious! We love trying different seasonings with potato wedges, but this was our first time using herbes de Provence. These went great with our chicken wings for dinner tonight. Thanks Chef John!

I was looking for a recipe for potato wedges to go with my pulled pork and this looked like it would fit the bill. I didn't have Herbs de Provence so I went on this site to make my own. This is a really good recipe for wedges but I did have to make a couple of changes. I made a large recipe so used about 8 fist sized potatoes and then doubled the herbs although you could put on as much as you like personally. For this amount of wedges I used about 1 tsp of paprika and about 1 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp of pepper. I did have to cook them for 1 hour at the recommended temperature so not sure of they would be done in the time in the recipe if you made the small amount. We like our potatoes quite cooked so I will always cook them for 1 hour. Definitely use parchment paper. This made them crispy and didn't stick to my pan. Thanks for this recipe I will be using this again.

We make these potato wedges at least twice a month. They are the best potato wedges I have ever had, by far! John, keep up the excellent work. We use your recipes frequently during our weekly cooking. You're a fantastic chef. My friend who was also a chef loves the way the food tastes as well. Congrats John.

I tried this except with white diamond potatoes instead that i let sit in a white vinegar dilution over night for about 12 hours and they turned out great! They got a little better of a crunch on the outside vs. when i used russets.

I  increased potatoes to 4 large to serve 4 big appetites.
Added Italian dried spice , some salt-free seasoning and melted  appx. 1/2 cup of butter to baste over the potatoes.
GREAT RECEIPE!  My fussy grandson loved it.

This is similar to a Rachael Ray recipe but different. No, you don’t need parchment or silicone mat. Place wedges skin side down on a raised wire rack over a cookie sheet lined with foil; no need to turn over. You can blend any number of spices and create many variations. I almost never follow a recipe and always read comments for ideas. Let your nose and tongue be the force that guides.

These turned out great! Full of flavor, and easy to make. I didn't have the herbs de Provence, so used Trader Joe's Seasoning Salt, along with the paprika, and pepper. Yum.

I made 3 times this week! We love french fries but not the cleanup (or the fat). These are so good that I'd choose them over fries anyday. I mixed up a quart jar of the breading just to save time on prep because I know I'll be making them often. Thanks1

Found this by accident this morning and decided to try it for dinner.  Both my husband and I loved it!  I did use parchment paper rather than buying a silicone baking mat.  They turned out perfectly using it!  Will definitely be making it again!

These turned out great! I soaked the wedges in water for about 15 minutes then made sure to dry them off well to  help the oil stick. I added a bit of salt after cooking and didn't really time anything, just cooked til crispy outside and tender through. My new favorite quick potato recipe and it'll be any easy one to experiment with different spices for different flavors.

These turned out great! Missing herbes de provence so I substituted 1 teaspoon Marjoram, 1 teaspoon thyme, and 1 teaspoon rosemary.  I am usually terrible at making oven fries and I was so pleased these turned out beautiful. (Oh, I used parchment paper as recommended by another reviewer).

Like another reviewer I dried these in a dish towel and then lightly dusted with AP flour. Then added them to a bowl with italian seasonings (what I had on hand), salt and olive oil and mixed by hand. Baked on parchment paper per directions. Excellent!

Loved it! Used non stick foil and it worked just fine! Used French onion soup mix to flavor the potatoes! If you like a deep onion flavor it’s great!

Served these to the neighborhood game night and they were the first food to disappear.  The recipe is super easy.  We didn't have Herbs d'Provence, so we used Mural of Flavor (thanks Penzy's!) which has spices, lemon peel, onion, orange peel and more.  

Heart healthy, low fat, gluten free, dairy free, nut free, vegan... It works for most every person's dietary restrictions.

I’ve made these a few times and I finally have it figured out. The problem has been that the cut sides of the potatoes are damp and the oil and seasoning doesn’t like to stick, especially when I used a ziploc bag to toss them. The next few times I used a bowl and tried to dry the potatoes and it was marginally better. This time I really dried the potatoes on a kitchen towel and then tossed them lightly with some flour in a bowl. Then I combined the oil and seasonings, poured it in and mixed them with my hands. Much better! The flour held the oil and seasonings so much better. When they baked a great crust formed. They were delicious! 4 stars as written but 5 stars using the flour.

I don't have a silicone baking liner so I used parchment and it worked out fine. These were good, but I felt they lacked something and needed a little oomph. Maybe red pepper flakes?
It was my first time trying Herbs de Provence blend, and I did enjoy the flavor. I just prefer more of a kick.

Fantastic. The video helped me realize how important it is to cut the wedges all the same size. Now I'm trying to find a silicone baking mat too.

Except for going a little lighter on the pepper (had the grinder handy on the table) followed all the instructions. No need for changing things around. The Herbes de Provence did a top notch job of seasoning. I can't imagine a need to use different spices for different meals. Instead of looking to substitute other seasoning for H de P I would think that using that perfect blend instead of the "usual" American, Italian, Greek etc. would bring tears to the eyes of anyone with live tastebuds. ?? Thanks C.J!

We have been making these for years.  I have used something as simple as salt and pepper to purchased seasonings.  I used some "Slap ur Momma" on it and really liked the spice that was added to it.  They are an easy and filling dish to make.

Good basic recipe I have made a number of times changing up the combination of spices depending on what meat or other side dishes with which it might be paired and how those might be spiced or flavoured. Simple, quick and loved by all...especially the kids!

Pretty good.  We didn't use a silicone mat, just aluminum foil.  Make sure you spray first so they don't stick to it.

Made these last night with grilled burgers. 
Easy to make. Didn't have silicone pan but lined cookie sheet with foil. Told my 7 year old to try one cause she will not eat potatoes unless they are French fries. She loved them and asked for more. My husband and I loved them too. Healthier and different change than just French fries. Will definitely make this again.

Delicious! I love the crispy texture of the potatoes and it's super easy to make. Instead of the herbs de provence, we used fresh rosemary since that's what we had on hand, and it was such a nice flavor. Also, the video was helpful and entertaining  - the mixing in the bowl vs. drizzling is indeed a great idea. This is a nice alternative to mashed potatoes which is what we'd always make with our roasts. This recipe is now in our regular rotation! Thank you!

The potatoes were a great hit. Delicious and crispy. I used new potatoes instead,and quartered them.
