Very good and easy. I made it for me because my husband doesn't like garbanzo beans... or so he says. Funny because he ate as much of this as I did!

Very nice addition to a tossed salad. Or can be just a side dish. Easy to make.

I made it exactly as written except my can of garbanzo beans was a little smaller. It turned out great! I had the leftovers for lunch - yum!
