I think every Italian family makes this dish, with slight variations of course, within their own family traditions. While this is a fairly standard way of making sausage and peppers, my family uses olive oil rather than butter, uses little or no herbs (fresh basil is always nice here), red wine rather than white, and some crushed or diced canned tomatoes, or marinara sauce.  Great on Italian rolls or over a sturdy pasta. This is always a treat!

I have to thank you for a sensational recipe. This is one of those recipes where if you follow the directions and the ingredient list,  it's perfect.  I've found on this website, that the simplest recipes many times prove to be the best.  I'm not an italian, but  is this a great recipe!!!  
 Very important that you find good italian sausage. Find a good italian deli if you're lucky enough to have one nearby. I used mild sausage with the fennel seed inside--a key seasoning in good italian sausage.  One other thing though, I cooked everything in a dutch oven on the stovetop, and under low heat I left it on the stove for about 45 minutes, and found that the extra time further reduced and caramelized the onions and  the redpeppers, which makes this dish even better.  I served it with a side of pasta with my favorite Barilla pasta sauce.  It doesn't get any better than this recipe.  Thanks for sharing one of your favorite family recipes and spreading the love.

Fabulous! I use beer instead of wine, olive oil instead of butter, and  a yellow pepper instead of green. I serve this in rolls and it's a family favorite.

Very good. I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and added a can of crushed tomatoes (14.5 oz).

Here is the sum of deviations. First, while the sausage is cooking in the skillet, I put the crushed tomatoes in a dutch oven on low. Then when I sliced up the sausage, I added it to the dutch oven.

I then did the onions and the garlic, using olive oil instead of butter. Instead of wine, I used an equal amount of beer. At the step where the peppers and onions are tender, I emptied the skillet into the dutch oven, and let everything simmer on low for 1 hour. 

The last change was that the sauce was a bit loose, so a tablespoon of cornstarch mixed with a tablespoon of water, then added in with everything else. 15 minutes later, done.

Awesome recipe! My Mom showed me how to make sausage and peppers years ago and while I'm not even Italian I definitely LOVE the food! This is pretty much how my Mom taught me except I don't add the basil or oregano. I aslo fry the veggies in olive oil vs. butter. This is great as a side for angel hair pasta with fresh marinara sauce and Italian bread!

I've made this at least half a dozen times since I discovered it. I always stick to the mild italian sausage because the results are lovely. I vary the colours of the peppers, depending what's on sale, but always use more than is asked for. It's a very simple recipe, tasty and satisfying.

I cut the sausage (used half spicy, half sweet) prior to cooking.  (If you cut it slightly frozen, it is much easier to cut without it falling apart, so either don't defrost all the way, or stick into the freezer to slightly freeze)  Made these into sandwiches on sub buns and it was excellant!  Even more excellant with provolone cheese and creamy italian dressing!

Yummy! :-) Added some black pepper, sea salt (just a lil), and some extra garlic. I also threw in some fresh sliced mushrooms and roma tomatoes.  I did not add the tomatoes until just after I threw the sausage back in the pan. Also added a little olive oil in with the white wine. Made a very nice saucy dish, served this over penne pasta and with some crusty galic bread. A nice change from spaghetti!

I used a bag of frozen yellow, red, green pepper and onion mix.  I added 1 cup of low sodium vegetable broth.  I cooked in the crockpot on low for 2 hours.  Sliced into 1/2" pieces and used in the Pasta Sausage with Italian Sausage recipe from this site and have used this with the Spanish Rice II recipe.  This is one of our favorite meals with with rice, pasta or on rolls with sauce and shredded cheese! YUM!

Excellent.  We ate this as sandwiches on french bread with marinated cherry tomatoes also from this site and a glass of white wine.  My son commented that is was like something you would get from a deli.  Update to original review:  I make this all the time but I now I always add a can of crushed tomatoes too.  They add flavor and body to the sauce.  We love this recipe.

Excellent - brought this to a team meet dinner and it was a hit, esp with the adults!  I deviated only slightly from the recipe - I placed a large can of diced tomatoes (seasoned with oregano, basil and garlic)in the slow cooker (on low).    I browned 16 sausage links (8 hot/8 sweet) as I cut up one very large spanish onion, 1 green pepper, 1 red pepper & 1 yellow pepper.  When the sausage was done I sliced them into chunks and put them in the slow cooker.  I added a wee bit of garlic into the pan (after wiping out the sausage fat)and sauteed the garlic & onions, then I added the peppers and a few minutes after that added 1/3 cup of red wine.    After most of the wine was cooked into the peppers, I added them to the crockpot and cooked on low for 2 hours.   The dish smelled AMAZING and at the dinner later I received rave reviews - I can't wait to make again!

We loved this.  Perfect amount of seasonings, I didn't change a thing, other than cooking a bit longer and I did use left over sausages that was cooked on a gas grill - I just sliced it up and added it when I added the wine.  Served it next to penna simmered in a red sauce.

I saw this on the Allrecipes homepage and just had to try it!  Good thing, because this was a really tasty meal!  I served it over rice and used hot Italian sausage because it was all I had.  I also subbed oil for the butter.  I boiled the sausages while I chopped the onions to get rid of some of the grease and then cut the sausages up after having boiled them to fry in the pan.  I was so impressed with how this turned out.  Thanks for the recipe!

I tripled this recipe for a large birthday party I was having.  I made everything the night before and after cooling, put the large skillet into the fridge.  Two hours before my party, I took the skillet out, heated it on the stove until warm, and then put in the crockpot on high until ready to eat (about an hour and a half.)I used 4oz sasuage links and kept them whole so people could make sandwhiches out of it.  Put it on a fresh French baguette (so good on this type of bread...the baquette really stands up to the sauce.)  This was a huge hit!  People went back for 2nds and 3rds....my brother in-law made me pack up the 2 leftover sasuages for him to take home.  This is a great recipe to make the day before and put in the crockpot so you can enjoy the party.  Bravo!

I have always made this, except without garlic, and wow, as a garlic lover, can't believe I missed that one in my recipe!  Only thing I kept the same as I do with mine, is 1/2 butter and 1/2 olive oil.  This was so good!

Quick, easy and delicious! I add a can of tomato paste cause my italian man like a da sauce. It really is a nice addition and not as thick as you think tomato paste would make it.

I converted the cooking time for a slow cooker, to be able to return home to a cooked meal.  I only had sweet sausage so I added red pepper flakes, to taste. Served on any Italian, hoagie, or hard roll, this is wonderful, and can be topped with mozzarella cheese and broiled until cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.

Not sure if my last rating went through, so Ill try again.  Great Recipe. Very Tasty. My husband and I are doing a low carb diet so changed it slightly. Used sweet turkey sausage, added a can of diced tomatoes w/ italian seasoning, salt and pepper. did not use the red onion.  Also added a pinch of hot pepper spice. VERY YUMMY.

This makes fabulous sandwiches.  I remove the casings from the sausages and roll them into meatballs.  Once I have cooked the sausage and veggies I split Italian sub buns and put them under broiler on low with some mozzarella. It makes a great meatball sandwich! I suppose you could top the sandwich with some tomato sauce, if that's your thing. But it's great without too.

Delicious. We loved it. Followed the author's advice and used half sweet and half hot Italian Sausage and it was excellent. I also used a mix of green, red, orange and yellow bell peppers (pers pref) and vidalia in place of the yellow onion. We all loved the addition of the basil and oregano and thought the amount of these herbs was perfect.  My son put his on Italian Bread and my daughter and I ate it as is. Excellent dinner. Thanks for sharing!

I've made this many times and it's always a winner.  The only change I make is at the very end when I add a can of seasoned diced tomatoes, undrained.  As soon as everything is hot, I serve over spagetti, or penne, or bow tie pasta.  Super!!!

I needed a quick side dish and had very little in the house, so made this without the sausage.  Used olive oil instead of butter and fresh basil instead of dried.  It was quite good, I'll definitely make it again with the sausage next time.

Good recipe. I cheated and used packaged sausage that was already cooked and red wine instead of white and it turned out great. Also, I found that if I let it simmer for longer than 15 mins, around 25 mins or so, on a low heat setting the onions and peppers really soaked up the wine and were not at all crunchy, they almost melt in your mouth.

This was such an easy meal. I browned 3 links of Hot Italian sausage and 3 links of Sweet Italian sausage in a pan with some olive oil then removed and sliced them into pieces. I added 3 cloves of fresh minced garlic and one Vidalia onion to the pan and sautéed them. I added the peppers to the pan and about a half a bottle of Sam Adams White Ale to the mix. I added the sausage and 3 torn leaves of fresh basil to the pan and let that simmer for 15 minutes until it all reduced. 
I was really nervous when I added the onions and garlic since the aroma was so potent that I had to open all the windows to let in some fresh air. After I added the peppers, beer and sausage and covered it, the smell dissipated and turned the dish into a wonderfully sweet yet spicy dish. 
I served it on torpedo rolls with American cheese (all I had) and French fries on the side. This will be added into my regular rotation. Thanks GiGi9801!!!!

The only change I made was to follow the recommendation of others and use beer in place of the wine and extra virgin olive oil in place of butter. Yummy!

Hey Gigi, you made my gang very happy tonight with this slightly different way of cooking sausage and peppers. I normally just do the same old boring marinara sauce thing. I used a bit more sausage and by the way "Cherokee", thanks for the clever idea of taking the casing off the sausage and rolling into balls! I used evoo to saute the onions and four different colored peppers. After sauteeing I added much more wine than called for, then placed my cast iron skillet (covered) into the oven to finish cooking. I never would have thought of using wine and even considered that beer might be an interesting alternative. The wine reduced beautifully leaving a very nice sauce. A couple of minutes before removing from the oven I sprinkled some shredded mozarella over the dish and served on sub rolls. Will definitely be making this again. Thanks so much Gigi!

I don't like wasting time on rating recipes with so many other ratings. However, I felt I needed to rate this one. A keeper. I did make some changes, added a large can of diced tomatoes and used fresh herbs. I doubled the recipe. I used a very large skillet pan and the onions looked like a ridiculous amount but yes, it's the right amount. They cook down quickly. I did not add the garlic until way later, after the peppers. (I have a tendency to burn garlic). And I used red wine instead of white, olive oil instead of butter. It was very good. Thanks GIGI.

This was great! I had chicken sausage in the freezer, a sweet onion in the fridge and a garden full of bell peppers.  This went together FAST once the veggies were sliced so I'm not having to heat up the kitchen, and the flavor is great.  Serving it with marinated cherry tomatoes from our garden.  Excellent summer supper!

This was a pretty quick and easy meal to make, I used red wine instead of white (already had a bottle open). I thought the onion-to-pepper ratio was a bit off, I will use more pepper next time, but I don't eat meat, so I asked my boyfriend for the rating based on taste- 5 stars!!  :) thanks!

This recipe has been sitting in my recipe box for quite a while, and I'm so glad I finally made it.  This is great!  I made this exactly as directed except that I left out the red onion (didn't have any) and just used the yellow.  I will be making this again.

Smelled AWESOME, tasted okay. It seemed like it was missing something. I think it would be really good on pizza or mixed with some scrambled eggs for a breakfast burrito, though.

This recipe is awesome. It would be great in italian rolls for a hoagie. We had it over pasta and rice, it made a lot of liquid cause I doubled the amount of wine (I didn't think 1/4 cup was going to be enough - but I guess it was) so there was a lot of juice, but I poured most of it off into the rice water so the rice absorbed the flavor too. It was delicious and so easy, kept hubby going back for more.

Italian Sausage, Peppers & Onions Haiku: "Heavenly delish. Colorful and so tasty. A bit slippery." I'm glad that I didn't use the butter b/c there was enough grease leftover from the sausage (plus a wee squirt of Pam) to saute the peppers and onions. (Incidentally, I added some yellow peppers too.) Funny thing about this recipe - I do the exact same thing, for the most part, that I dub "Southern Stir-fry" where the Italian sausage is swapped for smoked sausage (or sometimes Andouille), and the Italian seasonings are swapped for Cajun, so I knew going into preparing this, that I would be very happy w/ the end result. It's tasty eaten as is, or served over pasta, mashed potatoes, or rice. Buon appetito!

This is by FAR, the best sausage and pepper recipe ever!  I only had yellow and red peppers, with the red onions this dish looked beautiful.  I served with extra parm cheese over penne.  Mmmm. My BF had thirds. Thank you, Gigi.

Wanted to try my new grill pan - this recipe worked great!  The veggies came out so sweet.  I used olive oil instead of butter. Added a little red pepper flake and some salt to taste.  We had this on some toasted sourdough rolls, with a salad and some garlic buttered pasta on the side - YUM!

I buy the best sausage, I prefer hot. I used wine instead of white, a half cup. A quality olive oil - extra virgin - not butter. Oregano is good. I leave the sausage whole and couple with a good Italian hard crust bread/roll or slice to serve over pasta.

I had to improvise a bit with this one.  I used hot Italian sausage, sweet onion, no red onion, the garlic, an assortment of red, green, yellow and orange bell peppers, fresh basil and no oregano.  I cooked my sausage in olive oil until it was cooked through and removed it from the pan.  Then I sauteed the peppers and onions until crisp tender.  I added the wine along with the butter, creating a little butter/wine sauce.  Added the fresh basil and returned the sausage to the pan just long enough to reheat it.  My sauce was thin and there wasn’t a lot of it, but there was enough to moisten everything, including the spaghetti I served with it.  We both really enjoyed this.  I’ve done similar recipes using a marinara sauce, but this was a nice change.  I’d do it this way again!  Thank you!

We really enjoyed this.  My husband only wanted to rate it 4 stars, but my daughter and I overruled, and five stars it is.  I didn't have any red onion, so I just used 2 yellow onions.  I also used fresh basil (no oregano), due to personal preference.  Red wine instead of white, as it's what I had on hand.  I'm sure these minor changes didn't really make that much of a difference from the original recipe.  We ate all of the sausage, and have enough of the peppers and onions left over, that I plan to puree tomorrow and toss with some pasta!  I like it when I can stretch one recipe into two meals!

Sooo good. My husband comes from a large Italian family and said that this really made him feel close to home. He couldn't stop raving and ate till he hurt himself. The only thing I did different was use beer instead of wine. This'll be a permanent fixture in my home.

Delicious!! I cut the recipe in half since I only had half the sausage. I used spicy sausage and added hot pepper flakes for a little extra spice. Otherwise I followed the recipe. My hubby orders something similar at a local Italian restraunt and it comes with a marinara. I think  maybe next time I will use pasta or rice with it to make it a complete meal. Excited to try different variation next time. Very tasty! This is a keeper, Thanks!

This was really lovely. It seems almost too simple, but when it's all done and the peppers are soft, it's real comfort food. Very satisfying. I had only green peppers and yellow onions. I followed everything else as instructed.

I think this recipe really depends upon the kind of sausage you use. I used a spicy Italian sausage that I got from a local farmers market. I should have browned it more in the first step because when I added it back into the peppers it wasn't nearly done. As a result, the peppers were overcooked so that I could get the sausage done. But it was still tasty! I also used beer as another suggested and I used fresh herbs since I had them on hand.

I liked this.  It's pretty much as it reads - sausage ... peppers ... onions.  Good, but kinda boring.  I had to add more wine since it reduced so quickly.  Used turkey sausage.  No wows, but good.

This dish was so easy to make and quick too!  The sweet Italian sausage was a nice change from beef and chicken.  I took the advise from other reviews and added a can of crushed tomatoes with basil, added sliced fresh mushrooms and served over penne pasta.  My family and I loved it.  My 2 sons went for seconds!

I was very disappointed with this recipe. It was just didn't do anything for my husband and I. Very little flavor; just a bunch of peppers and links of sausage thrown together in a pan.

Wow, enough to satisfy Tony Soprano!
Simple recipe and tastes great.  I added extra veggies and served with penne pasta lightly coated in spaghetti sauce and sprinkled with parmesean cheese.

This is an excellent recipe, I used something similar to it but after trying Gigi's I will never use mine again.  I think the 1/2 sweet 1/2 hot  sausage she suggests makes the difference.  I serve it like this or sometimes over mostacelli or rigatoni.  You can't go wrong with this recipe, one of the best ever printed here.

This is a wonderful recipe - such flavor.  Thanks.  My small changes were:
1 lb hot sausage, 1 lb sweet; 1 whole red onion, sliced; 6 cloves garlic-minced; 8 oz fresh sliced mushrooms; 1 T fresh basil rather than dried;  1/2 C white wine (Pinot Grigio, which was was what I had on hand.  I will be making this often.  Again thank you.

I was looking for something to feed 40 actors. It had to be fast but delicious, so I did a 'rehearsal'on our family (didn't make 40 servings, of course). I cut the sausages in thirds. It was a unanimous thumbs up. This us a real keepr.

Wonderful, easy recipe.  I did have to add a light sprinkle of salt - 1/4 tsp at most.  And I sliced the sausages before cooking but other than that followed the instructions.  Served with rice for an excellent meal.  
May add marinara sauce next just to experiment as per another reviewer. Thanks for the recipe.

This was very good and fairly easy to make.  I boiled my sausage first, cut it up into slices then threw it in the pan to brown with 1 onion, a red pepper and a yellow pepper.  I didn't use a red onion or a green pepper simply because I didn't have them on hand.  I added the seasoning, white wine and a little chicken broth to let it simmer for a few minutes while I boiled elbow macaroni and served the sausage and peppers over the macaroni.  Very delicious.  Just realized I forgot the garlic!  It was delicious without.  Will certainly add it next time!

I didn't make too many changes to this recipe. After I browned the sweet Italian sausages and removed them, I had a lot of sausage drippings in the pan. I just tossed the butter in with the drippings and continued with the rest of the recipe. I had doubled the ingredients because I have a large family. The only real modification I made was that I used about 1 1/2 cups of white cooking wine (3/4 cup if not doubling the recipe). It was a hit! Will be making this one again.

This is a great recipe GIGI.  My children will not eat Italian sausage so I use garlic sausage. I leave out the garlic in the recipe since the meat has it.  I add fennel seed, half a can of no-salt tomatoes, double the onions, peppers, and basil.  Don't use wine since I never have it.  I serve this with cheese and potatoe perogies.  My 5,6,and 7 year olds love this.

One of my favorite recipes that almost everyone I've made it for enjoys.   I prefer to leave the sausages whole and frequently sub a flavored olive oil (though these do get pricey) for the garlic,  The results are always excellent though.   Whether I use sweet sausage, spicy sausge, or something else entirely (I've cooked with chorizo sausage before!) this is a pretty good recipe to get you started on making a delicious, and very classic, dish.

Quadrupled the recipe to make two large trays of this for a party last weekend.... it was the first dish to go and the most talked about!  Several people asked for the recipe.  The only thing I did differently (and did this only because I was making such a large quantity) was that I browned the sausage in the oven on baking sheets instead of in a pan.  Added a little oil at the end to make up for the lack of grease I would have gotten from browning in the pan.  Fantastic... don't think I'll ever use another recipe!

EXCELLENT! Made as additional meat option when we had a pig roast. Every one who was fortunate enough to get some thought these were the best Italian sausages ever! I followed a few other reviewers suggestions and used Moscato wine, canned petite diced tomatoes and both red and green bell peppers seeded and sliced. I used vidallia onion instead of combo of yellow and red. I also added a few shakes red pepper flakes. I browned the sausages on stove in skillet and then put in crock along with rest of ingredients. I topped with a few pats of real butter and cooked on low for 5 to 6 hours. Absolutely fabulous!

I didn't think I would like this as much as I did but it was a hit for me and my husband. I used bacon grease instead of butter, 2 bags of Kroger brand frozen sliced 3 pepper mix (red, green, yellow) with onions, 1 smallish fresh red onion sliced, 3 drained 4 oz. cans of sliced mushrooms, and the rest of the ingredients as listed. I used spicy Italian sausage that I cooked on my indoor electric grill first and then sliced and added to the sauteed vegetables. The sausage was dry, but I don't know if that was because of the brand of sausage, the grilling, or if the cooking twice was the issue (grilled then skillet). I used a fresh sausage from the butcher at Sprouts that may have just been too lean. I'll use my favorite Italian sausage next time and see if I get a better result. Otherwise, the taste was sweet and spicy and very flavorful. The wine is such a nice touch. My husband who usually avoids green peppers went back for thirds. We will definitely be making this again. Thanks!

This is a GREAT recipe. It is easy to make and almost impossible to mess up! I use orange and red peppers and mild and hot sausage. Look no further if you are trying to find a recipe for sausage, peppers and onions. I follow the recipe exactly....probably use a few more peppers and onion......I do the Atkins diet and my husband doesn't. This is one meal that we completely agree on....I make pasta or Italian bread for him to go with the dish and we both love it!*****

This is one of our staples on the weekly menu! Love it. The secret is mixing the sweet and hot sausages. I add a can of crused tomatoes and serve it over rice. It doesn't get any better for easy, quick and totally satisfying.

I kind of went my own direction with this. Instead of links I got a piece/coil of Sicilian seasoned sausage -- about a pound in weight (like the kind you can get in the grocery store). I baked it in the oven in a pie plate with about half an inch of water for about 45 minutes at 385 until no longer pink in the middle. Meanwhile, I sauteed about half a red & green pepper and slices of sweet onion in some olive oil until blackened and soft. When the sausage was done I cut it into bun-length pieces and put on fresh bakery wheat sub/rolls. I poured some jarred marinara sauce on them, sprinkled with dried oregano & basil, and topped with shredded mozzarella cheese. Baked in the oven at 450 on a cookie sheet  until cheese was melted. Topped with pepper/onion mixture. This was a great supper to break up the usual rotation and was pretty easy to throw together as well.

Great recipe!  Added mushrooms and tomatoes to the simmer, and used hot Italian sausage rather than sweet (added a nice bite).  The tomatoes added body that I think, otherwise, would have been absent from the dish.  Ate it on top of foccacia bread, with a side of caesar salad.. satisfyingly filling without being too heavy

Very Good!  Once I browned the sausage I simmered it in a can of diced tomatoes with basil and garlic until everything else was ready.  Served with the tomato sauce on fresh rolls.

At first I thought I didn't need a recipe for sausage and peppers...but I decided to try this one anyway.  Boy am I glad I did!  The white wine and seasonings provided a great flavor.  I actually followed this one exact - didn't add or take away a thing.  It came out delicious!  Will definitely be making this again!

Very tasty! I make sausage, peppers and onions quite often, but never with the addition of white wine. We loved the subtle extra flavor from that. I do add a bit of olive oil along with the butter and I didn't slice the links because we were using this for sandwiches. I served these on hoagie rolls with a little marinara sauce and  grated parmesan cheese. Delicious sandwich, we each ate two! Thanks for sharing, I would definitely make this again :)

This was fantastic! I served this as one of the dishes for my son's b-day party & everyone raved about it. The only thing I changed was I used olive oil instead of butter. I also doubled the wine & added chicken broth since I doubled the recipe. I also added a 1/2 can of crushed tomatoes to give it the reddish color & a little sauce flavor. JUST PERFECT!

What a nice little quick meal!  I had a package of hot italian sausage to use up, and freezing wind and snow meant no grilling.  I found everthing I needed for this in my fridge and pantry.  I added a little more wine, and about a 1/2 cup chicken broth to this, and did add a 6 oz can of tomato paste, which made a lovely gravy.  I simmered about 1/2 hour total after adding back the sausage slices.  Thanks for a great submission.  We enjoyed this.

Like many others, I served this on a toasted roll with provolone.  I used a white wine reduction and instead of adding more wine when it seemed a little dry, I added in a little marinara.. I have seen a few recipes for sausage, peppers, and onions that call for tomato paste or marinara and I think its a nice addition.  I also seasoned the peppers and onions with salt and pepper.  This recipe is GREAT though, I'll be making it again.

Crowd Pleaser!  I seared the sausage on the grill instead of skillet, then sauted the veggies and spices, and threw in roaster, 350 degrees x 40min.
Was served in buffet line- many asked for recipe.  I also used beer instead of white wine. (Alcohol breaks the sausage casing down so tender.) Even the little kids loved it!

This was so easy and really good. We didn't have the white wine on hand and I added sliced mushrooms and some thyme and oragano. Served it up with some penne. Excellant and filling. I will make again this time with the wine.

This was absolutely delicious!  The only thing I didn't have was the basil.  I followed everything else to the T (except I used "hot" italian sausage, not sweet).  But it was a delicious dish, smelled great while cooking, and was fast and easy!  Couldn't have been more pleased!

I make this recipe a lot (double the amount) and the next day I add pasta sauce to it and put it on white rice.  This way I get two meals out of it.  Everyone likes it.

My mom used to make Italian sausages with peppers and onions and I loved it growing up. This recipe is very good and I follow it exactly except I leave the sausages whole for sandwiches and for over pasta I slice them and add a can of tomatoes. Very good, thank you.

This is the exact recipe I have used over the years.  An old famous sub shop owner gave it to me about 20 years ago (he used sausages or steak pieces).  Only difference is we add a half +/- tablespoon olive oil with a tablespoon of the butter so it doesn't burn, salt and pepper, and a teaspoon of sugar to taste which sweetened up the onions and peppers more so than without (I personally sprinkle a tiny bit of Sweet and Low or Stevia or Agave whatever I have on hand). It's personal preference I think.  I love this loaded up on a Fantini roll.  Better than at the fairs!

I made this delicious, quick and simple recipe...we loved it. I didn't put in the butter, just little water to keep it simmering. I also added a can of tomatoes and mushrooms. I added already cooked rigatoni noodles from another meal...Added them to make this an all around great one serving meal.

Fabo!  Replaced wine with cooking sherry and it was awesome.  Toasted hoagie sandwiches with Dijon mustard tonight and over pasta later in the week.  Low fat and healthy too.   A keeper for sure.

This is one of our favorites  will be serving over penne pasta tonight, but it always seem that we don't have enough pepper and onions so I made a boat load, I doubled the recipe. The great thing is that it is low on calories and it is always a treat for breakfast as well. it goes well with scrambled eggs.  Thanks, Happy Cooking!

Really yummy!  The smell of this cooking was intoxicating and we all couldn't wait to eat it.  I sliced up the sausage (used Italian chicken sausage) to put in hot dog buns added the peppers and onions (which I used green and yellow) then topped with some gruyere cheese and threw it in the oven for the cheese to melt.  Served with a side of marinara for dipping.  VERY good dinner.  Thanks so much!

I enjoyed this recipe and hadn't made anything like it before.  I didn't have green bell pepper, red onion, or the wine (I used water) so I couldn't use them.  I did have everything else.  I rated this a 5 because I think it deserves a 5, but my version I would rate a 4.  I think the green bell and wine (or even chix stock) would have given it the over the top edge in flavor.  But I was not disappointed. I will be sure next time I have all ingredients on hand!  Thanks for sharing!!

This was great.  Made with spicy italian sausage and subbed chicken broth for white wine.  Added black pepper, red pepper flakes, and a small amount of salt.  Great by itself, served mixed with cavatappi and shredded mozzarella the next day and it was even better!

I've made sausage & peppers before, but never added wine or garlic - much better!  I used cubanelle (frying) peppers, and only had sweet onions, and it was still delicious.  We had this as sandwiches.

The wine tops this lovely dish off. I used a mix of sweet and spicy Ital. Sausages which I sliced up (per instructions) and added to the peppers and onions before serving. It is thick enough to be served alone as a 'stir-fry' or on hoagies in the traditional manner. Fresh Parmesan Cheese sprinkled lightly across the top gives it just a dash of that extra some people crave.

This was delicious!! My husband even loved it (and he never wants to try anything new)! I did do a little tweaking though. I used 1/2 sweet and 1/2 hot italian sausage. Also, when sausage is almost done browning, I added 2 chicken breasts cut into pieces and cooked through and pulled the sausage and chicken out when sausage was ready for slicing. I added zucchini in with the peppers and doubled the garlic and the wine then after the peppers and onions got soft I added 2 regular sized cans of diced tomatoes with garlic, basil, and oregano. While cooking, I microwaved a baking potato for 5 minutes til almost done then peeled it and chopped into decent sized pieces and mixed in during the last 5 minutes of cooking. Can eat alone or on top of penne or angel hair pasta. Was AMAZING! My husband requests I make this again and my mom wants the recipe already too! Enjoy!

I do the veggies as following the recipe then add marinara and the sausage to the mix.  Serve on hogi style buns with provolone or mozzarella cheese.

My husband loved this recipe.  I followed it exactly.  In place of fresh veggies, to save time and money, i used a medley of frozen peppers (of all colors) and onions.  This is definitely a remake for me.

This is definitely a staple for dinner with my Italian family.  We usually throw in some cubed potatoes as well.  I also like to use hot sausage, but I tend to favor spicy food anyway.

This was really good!!!  The only small changes is made was I used olive oil instead of butter, added a small pinch of fennel seed and a small pinch of red pepper flakes.  We served this over spaghetti and it was great!!!  I did slice the sausage into rounds before browning too.

Outstanding!  Only changes I made were to use olive oil instead of butter and used 1 link of Itallian Hot sausage and 1 link of Italian Mild (as suggested by GIGI9801).  I will make this again.

If you use sweet & hot Italian sausage, I learned to cut one of them in half. Then you know which one is sweet & which is hot. No guessing. Helps when you have a good number of people for the meal and different tastes are present. Be a good host!

This was quick, easy, and delicious! Made it according to directions and wouldn't change a thing. This recipe is going into my "make regularly" recipes folder because my husband thought it was amazing. Leftovers were served on a roll with melted cheese as sausage parmesan.

This was wonderful! I did make it slightly different by adding white wine vinegar - instead of white wine - and about a tbs of sugar which gave it a great zip! I also made it in my iron skillet and allowed it to caramelize a bit. At the last minute, I decided to layer it into a casserole dish with a basic tomato basil sauce, whole wheat spaghetti noodles, and havarti cheese; baked it at 350 for 30 minutes; melted more cheese on top for another 5 and it was AMAZING!!

This is really good.  Better than any recipe I've ever tried with Italian sausage.  The peppers and onions had to much flavor.  Next time I will add more.

An excellent recipe.  I always add julienned sun dried tomatoes to the recipe.  I like some tomato flavor I don't want to overwhelm the dish with runny tomato sauce.  Great dish.

Delicious! Diced up tomatoes from my garden, fresh basil cut in strips, 1 tsp olive oil, splash of white wine, red pepper flakes & black pepper, simmered for 5 minutes.  Served with pasta and hot crusty bread!  Definitely a keeper! My husband went back for seconds and I shall be enjoying this again for lunch today!  Thank you for a great recipe!

This is my husband's favorite dinner. It's a very simple dinner that turns out wonderful every time. I use a butter/olive oil combo instead of just butter (butter for browning onion/garlic and then add a some oil shortly before adding the peppers). I use double the amount of peppers and substitute Italian seasoning for the two spices in the ingredient list. We usually use this as filling for hoagies.

This recipe was very simple and was good.  I used hot Italian sausage instead of sweet sausage because we prefer the spicy sausage. I served it on toasted Italian sub rolls with melted provolone.  I would definitely make these again, but, I think I will let the onions and peppers carmelize more before adding the white wine.

This recipe was tasty as well as beautiful! I made this for the Christmas Eve buffet table and the bright colors stood out! My guests raved about this and my hubby has had me make it three times since! Love it! Using a food processor helped to make prep work easier.

I used hot sausage and added red pepper flakes for spice.  Subbed olive oil for butter and red wine for white.  I also added a can of tomatoes.  I increased the garlic because I always increase the amount of garlic.  Very tasty.

I made this for a party of 72. It was the highlight of the meal! I used Del Russo sweet italian sausage and marsala wine. Having that many sausages to cook, I baked them in the oven the day before the party at 350 for about 1 hour, turning them over several times until they were nicely browned. I drained the grease and added it to the butter to saute the onions and peppers. I also added a little salt and pepper along with the basil, oregeno and thyme too. I added a large can of tomato sauce and tomato paste with the wine and put them in a large baking dish. The next day I put the pan in the oven at 350 and baked the whole dish for 2 1/2 hours. Served them on buns along with some mozerella cheese. Delicious and very tender.

Very good recipe! I threw in some shallots & fresh mushrooms I had on hand and served it Italian quesadilla-style on tortillas left over from taco night at my house. Put tortillas on cookie sheet, topped them with sliced provolone then heated them under the broiler just until cheese melted. Then topped them with the sausage & peppers and folded tortillas in half! Wonderfully filling sandwich type way of serving dish and the boys in my house seemed very pleased with the results!

This was really good.  Like another reviewer suggested I used beer instead of white wine.  I also only used 1 yellow onion and there was more than enough.  This definitely is not enough for 6 people, 1 sausage link per person is not enough!  If you're cooking for 6 I would double the recipe.

This recipe is delicious!  I didn't have any red onion so I just omitted that and subbed some dark beer for the white wine. I wanted to serve it on top of pasta so I also threw in a can of diced tomatoes.  Yummy!  I would have taken a picture but it was gone before I could!  ***UPDATE***  We love this and continue to make it, snapped the pic just before it was devoured- by me!

YUMMY!!! This is a fabulous recipe!! Very easy to make - and no alterations needed!  I used beer instead of wine - and it was just as good!!  Try it with Italian Turkey Sausage as a healthier alternative.  I served this with whole wheat angel hair pasta and Paul Newman's Sockaroni Pasta Sauce!  Thank you for such an amazing recipe that I will use again!!

YUM but lose the butter and try olive oil for an authentic Italian dish.  Also use a winking owl chardonnay and save some moolah at the same time.  O solo mio!

Delicious flavor. I used mild Italian sausage but added a little bit of cayenne. Served over penne pasta, topped with shredded Parmesan.

MMM! This was so good. I served mine over penne and added a can of tomatoes. Everyone loved it. My only complaint is that it is a day later and my house  smells like sausage and peppers still.

Oh so good! I used half sweet italian sausage and half hot. I melted provolone cheese on sub rolls under the broiler and served the sausage, peppers & onions on top. My husband kept making those "Mmmm good" sounds as he ate! Make sure to drain the juices off from the wine; I just used a strainer. Otherwise the subs would have been way too soggy. Overall, this is a great recipe! Thanks for sharing.

This is fantastic and easy! I made this when my full-Italian mother-in-law came to visit and she loved it. A true test! We had it with polenta and escarole one night and the next day we put the sausage left-overs in hoagie rolls, topped with provolone and broiled them. Delicious! I used sherry instead of the wine because that's what I had on hand. I also used half sweet Italian and half hot Italian sausages. I have also made this with chicken sausage (used vermouth instead of the white wine) and it was equally good (maybe better because it's less guilt-inducing!) Thanks for a great recipe.

I made some of the changes mentioned by other reviewers. Here's the rundown since I made a big quantity: for 24 6" links I used 1 red, 1 yellow and 1 orange pepper. Used 2 yellow onions, 1 red onion, 2 tsp minced garlic, 2 tsp dried basil, 1 cup Corona beer. Didn't have oregano. Substituted olive oil for butter. Browned sausage, didn't slice up. Then sauteed the other ingredients, added sausage and beer and simmered for 30 minutes. Refrigerated, microwaved next day to heat up and then put in crock pot to stay warm for neighborhood picnic. Served on buns. Got lots of compliments. Made a batch of sweet and hot and both disappeared. It's both delicious and colorful.
Thanks for the recipe, gigi9801!

This was amazing. It was one of those dishes that you knew was going to be awesome as you were making it. I only had red wine on hand (as always!) and it worked out just fine. I also threw in some julienned zucchini to use it up and it was great. I served this on crusty rolls. Yum. The leftovers are calling my name......

Wonderful!  I've made sausage, peppers, and onions before, but the addition of white wine made a world of difference.  Like other reviewers, I added mushrooms (about 4 oz) and lots of pepper.  Also, I've found it to be a time-saver to chop up the sausage before cooking it; it doesn't make much of a flavor difference.

Made this for a party of 12. I doubled the recipe as it was a huge hit! I did half hot sausage and half sweet! I added an extra onion and a little more garlic. Will definitely make this again- was a huge crowd pleaser! Thank you :)

So flavorful and delicious.  I don't even want to add the marinara sauce for the pasta.  I admit I DID use red wine instead of white, but that was the only change I made and was based on personal preference.  Can't wait for the husband to come home and taste this.  **NOTE**Made this tonight with white wine and most of a small jar of sun-dried tomato pesto.  Just as great, but a little different than the earlier times.  GREAT RECIPE!

This was my first time making sausage and peppers, and I liked this quite a bit! I used olive oil instead of butter and an orange pepper instead of a green one.  It was slightly bland; so I added salt, pepper, and garlic powder. I would make this recipe again!

This was a solid recipe. I followed it almost exactly to the T-- with the exception being that I used spicy italian sausage rather than sweet & I sprinkled with parmesan when serving.  It was very simple, but very tasty! We served over plain semolina pasta.  My husband wasn't thrilled when he saw me cooking it, but was quick to comment that it was actually really yummy and a very pleasant surprise. This is a fabulous, nutritious, easy weekday meal.

I tried this recipe but made a few changes to it. First, I used yellow and red pepper since I don't like green. I also didn't use the red onion. I did not add the basil or oregano but kept the garlic. After cooking the pepper and onion, I followed the suggestion of someone else's comment and had it on Italian rolls with Italian dressing and Provolone cheese. It was so good and I will be making it again!!!!

Everyone in my home loved this, even my finicky kids!!  Very easy to put together, quickly got it to the table, and it tasted great!  

4 1/2 stars total--I subtracted 1/2 a star because I would have preferred not to have tasted the wine in the sauce.  The next time I made it, I only used half of the wine called for in the recipe and added 1/2 cup diced tomatoes....sooo good!  

Thank you very much for the great recipe!!

Absolutely perfect exactly as the recipe calls. Easy to make, and even my husband who is not a sausage fan, said, and I quote, "This is so good, I could eat it every night!"  Win!

I've made this numerous times, and I love it! This time, I halved the recipe using spicy Italian chicken sausages, olive oil, red wine, and just a few sprinkles of Italian seasoning and red pepper flakes. I just topped with a slice of Provolone cheese and microwaved seconds, only to melt (no roll or pasta = no carbs). Add a glass of red wine, and I'm a happy camper! :)  Thanks for the delicious recipe GIGI! It's even better than at the ballpark! UPDATE 11/18/14: I made this with the Thin 'n Trim brand of chicken sausages, and it was not good. The dish was very dry, almost no liquid (which is nice over a roll) and the sausages were considerably smaller than regular chicken sausages. The small amount of extra fat in regular chicken sausages really makes a better, tastier dish.

This recipe was really good! I made it following the recipe exactly, and it was great. My whole family really loved it, which doesn't happen all that much with my five year old and almost two year old. In fact, my two year old ate two helpings of this, which doesn't happen often with him. I will definitely be making this again. Thanks for the recipe!

This was yummy. After reading several reviews and worrying a bit that it was going to be too dry, I added half a can of petite diced garlic/olive oil seasoned tomatoes. It was good, but I think it actually would have been fine leaving the tomatoes out. I'd at least use plain tomatoes next time if I add tomatoes again as the seasoned ones made it a little too flavoured over all. Very simple and tasty though, I would definitely make again.

This is by far the best Italian sausage recipe I've ever had.  I'm constantly asked for a copy of the recipe. I follow the recipe pretty much exactly as stated except I double the ingredients and instead of putting it back in the pan, I place it in a casserole dish and bake it in the oven. I try to find a sweet Italian sausage and have used Johnsonville's.  Has turned out perfect every time.  Great recipe!

I thought this was good. I was kind of hoping for crisper vegetables, though, for some reason. I was also thinking it was going to be like the Italian type sausages at the fair for some reason, but it is more of a skillet dish with sausage and softened vegetables. I don't like a lot of dried herbs, so I cut those way back to taste. I also used chicken sausage to cut back on cholesterol. I added some garlic salt and a little black pepper at the end, that was really needed. I will probably serve it over rice.

YUM! Hubby wanted sausage sandwiches tonight, but not the usual ones that I make w/ the tomato sauce, so I thought I'd give this recipe a try. I used all vidalia onions and red and yellow peppers b/c that's what I had on hand. Also, I opted not to add all of the basil and oregano (personal preference), maybe just a pinch of each, along w/ some salt and pepper. The wine gave this a nice flavor. Oh, and I used hot Italian sausage. This was a nice change and one that I would make again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I made this recipe for the first time last night, never having made sausage and peppers before. The recipe came out great, The only thing I changed was not adding white wine, otherwise, followed the recipe exactly. My husband and i loved it. We had it on grinder rolls, and with a salad and corn on the cob, it was the perfect meal, easy too. I'll be making this again.

Made recipe almost exactly as written.  Omitted the butter and basil and used 1/2 cup wine instead of 1/4 cup for deglazing.  Delicious new recipe.  I can easily see making this a couple times a month.  Snapped a photo (#35) which really shows what great caramelization is possible with this dish.

Needed more sauce.  I used about 1/2 cup white wine and  1/2 cup of chicken stock. Simmered and served with a crusty bread. Delish!

Followed the recipe to a "T" and made it with venison italian sausage. YUMMY!  This went into a pasta bake that night.  The next couple of days we had sandwiches with them topped with melted mozzarella and provolone!

I love this recipe.  After making it several times, I did make one change that I thought made it even better.  Instead of the wine, I added homemade chicken stock  instead and it gave this recipe an extra punch of flavor.

Extremely easy to make! My husband loved it!!! He said the two things he always says when he likes a new dish... "add this to the rotation" and "you should make this for my mom."  I used pinot grigio for the wine and it turned out just fine.  I would recommend adding a little salt and some red pepper flakes if you like more spice.  I would also suggest moving the casings on the italian sausage before cooking.

Not a terribly experienced cook, so I follow recipes!  This one was really good and very easy. Added just a bit more wine and it made a really good sauce. Served over rice one time and over farfalle pasta another. Kids loved it. (used mild sausage). Will definitely make again

Tried cooking as is, but thought was a bit bland, so I added marinara to the mix which improved taste & texture.  Also, I made mine vegetarian using Tofurkey Italian Sausage, but made with regular Italian sausage for hubby & kiddo.  Kiddo liked both.  I prefer it without pasta, but rest of family wanted pasta.  Used fresh basil instead of dried, added cracked red pepper at the table, hubby & kiddo added parmesan cheese.  Overall, everyone liked it.  Very versatile dish that I enjoy because I can make it vegetarian for me!  Would likely make it again.

I used Italian frying peppers from my CSA and added cherry tomatoes because I'm putting them in just about everything at this time of year when they are still so prolific in the garden.  I thought it might have been too dry and a bit bland without them.  Perhaps I will take other reviewers' advice and add canned tomatoes if I make it out of tomato season.

I made this receipe using what I had on hand: 2 med. yellow onions, 2 green peppers, 5 sausages, fresh herbs and red wine.  The outcome was excellent!  I'll use this recipe over and over!  Could add another pepper.

This was delicious.  I used 1/2 jar of marinara and angel hair pasta.  My family would have preferred I use the whole jar.  My neighbor tasted it, since she was over while i was cooking and decided to make it herself a few days later.  Great Recipe!

This recipe was really delicious. Very sweet and juicy.I wasn't sure what kind of white wine to use, so I used Moscato white wine which is quite sweet. It turned out DELICIOUS! My wife loved it, I'm using this recipe again. It's my signature dish now for when we watch our Laker games! Go Lakers!

I make this Hungarian-style, by adding chopped tomatoes & paprika instead of basil & oregano.  Instead of butter, I chop a couple strips of bacon & remove excess fat then add the vegetables (that includes a diced, hot pepper because I love heat) in the pan & saute.  Either version is delicious.

Delicious, quick recipe for parties or last minute bring along dish to gatherings.  I did add 14oz can of diced Tomatoes and sprinkled a little bit of red pepper flakes.  After browning sausage in skillet, I mix all the ingredients into an oven pan and baked for 35 to 40 minutes.  Great with rice and pasta or Italian bread !

Loove it.  I don't drink white wine and don't like to waste it either.  I buy a 4 pack of the 187's and keep them around for cooking.  I used one small bottle for it.  yuuummm.  This recipe works great w/ chicken sausage, too.

This recipe was excellent. My mother was Italian and she used to make this all the time. When she passed away in 2006 I had no idea how to make it. This recipe taste just the dish she made and brought back great memories! Thank you for sharing.

I am giving this a 5 because of the ease of the recipe.  I did alter the recipe just a little by adding a jar of marinara sauce to the peppers and let the sausages simmer in that.  I am sure that it would have been just as good without, but the marinara made it extra special.  I will definitely make this again, as my husband was extremely happy with the dish and I also thought it quite good.  This is kind of surprising to me, as I tend not to like anything with cooked peppers in it.  The picture is spot on to how mine looked prior to adding the marinara, as well!  Thanks for the recipe.

Very tasty and very easy to make.  I did use olive oil instead of butter but other than that I followed the recipe.

Very good.  I used Hillshire Farms Smoked Sausage instead of Italian, omitted the garlic, and used chicken broth instead of the wine.  I didn't have a red onion on hand, so I used an additional half of a yellow onion instead.  It tasted great!  I did have to add more broth after simmering so that I would have enough sauce to serve it over rice.  I used less than a half can of broth; the next time I make it, I will probably put more broth in at the end so that I have more liquid to serve over rice.

YUM YUM YUM!  I used three kinds of onions - Spanish, yellow and red.  Also added a 1/2 can of diced tomatoes, a little extra garlic and about 1/2 cup of jarred pasta sauce since I like a little tomato.  I let it simmer for about an hour or longer and it was delicious! Leftovers were awesome too!

My boyfriend has always talked about his mom's sausage and peppers.  He said this recipe was different from hers, but just as good.  (We won't tell her that, though!)  Very, very good, and simple.

Delicious!  I grew up eating sausage and peppers and yet,  have never made this dish.  I followed the instructions, but used chicken sausage instead of regular sausage.  I also used chicken broth in place of the wine, solely because I did not have the wine.  I added a pint of grape tomatoes and let them burst in the sausage mixture.  I also added some salt, black pepper, and hot red pepper.  Great recipe!

I have made this recipe 3 times over the last 2 months and it has been a hit.  Instead of butter, I use olive oil. For a party, I browned the sausages in the pan and moved to a baking dish including some of the grease from the sausage.  Sauteed the peppers and onions in another pan and poured over the sausages.  I covered the dish with foil and baked it for about 45-50 minutes next to the stuffed shells I made.  It worked out perfect, allowing me to converse with everyone when they arrived instead of cooking the whole time.

Excellent. I grilled the sausage first then added them to the pan without slicing them. We served in hoagie rolls with all the veggies over top. These were the perfect sausage sandwich.

I made this both the "traditional" way of browning the sausage and as more of a pasta sauce with crumbled sausage.  When I made the "sauce" I added diced roma tomatoes.  Both ways are excellent.

Makes an aromatic and attractive dish, especially served heating in an electic skillet at an office Fall/Harvest-themed potluck. I used white merlot for the wine, and red, yellow, green and orange peppers. Don't worry if the centers of your sausage are slightly pink when cutting, because they cook through in the last simmering stage.

Thanks you so much!  I make this alot & have passed on the recipe!  The only changes I make are 1 whole red chopped onion, instead of half...1 orange bell pepper instead of green & 1/2 cup of Sunset Rose wine.  I have always heard to use a wine you would drink & that's the kind I like!  Awesome recipe!!!

UPDATE: Made sub sandwiches with the left-overs last week. These made AWESOME sandwiches for a quick weekday lunch!!! Absolutely perfect (and I am REALLY picky about left-overs). Thanks again for sharing this WONDERFUL recipe! Pretty good. Made this tonight for my bf and I. He approved of me making it again (a BIG plus since we never agree on food)! I subbed hot Italian sausage (the REAL authentic stuff from my local Italian market), red/yellow peppers (no green here) and a white onion for the yellow (didn't realize that I didn't have a yellow onion on hand - will have to try with one next time...), but otherwise followed the directions to a T. Used 4 GENEROUS sized garlic cloves too. I had an issue with browning my sausage though.... I thought that "browning sausage" meant just that (literally) and that it would finish cooking through in the final step. In retrospect, I see that I should have fully cooked the sausage to begin with. I ended up having to remove the sausages from the bell pepper/onion mixture to sautee it separately (since they still weren't cooked through after simmering for 15 minutes). I have leftovers (lucky me!), so I am taking some to work tomorrow. Going to make a sub sandwich topped with some warmed spaghetti sauce and melted mozzarella cheese. I can't wait to sample the result! Thanks for sharing : )

I loved this recipe, but I too made a few alterations.  I used olive oil instead of butter, cut out the dried herbs and used fresh basil only, red instead of white wine and added 1 small can of tomato sauce with the sausage pieces.  It came out fabulous.

I didn't feel like cooking tonight but I didn't want to "eat out of an envelope" either. This is a perfect dinner when you want something quick, easy, and a little different from the norm. We got the spicy sausage and it was delicious. Made this exactly as written and it was perfect. We had them on brat buns and served w/ a mixed green salad from a bag w/balsamic vinaigrette for an easy throw together meal.

tasted great over penne with a few whole canned tomatoes and their juice mixed in with the wine. Don't be afraid to use only spicy italian sausages; it wasn't too overpowering at all.

Excellent recipe! I used beer instead also, made lots of sauce. Next time I would cut the peppers and onions a little bigger as they kinda melted in to the sauce, but many loved it this way because they like the flavor instead of the texture of peppers and onions. Made for 30 people, the flipped over it. Next day reheated and pured sausage and mixture over white rice, loved, loved loved it!

Terrific recipe!  I changed just a couple of things.  I used beer instead of wine and olive oil instead of butter as previous poster had done.  I also used a mixture of hot (not sweet) pork and turkey sausage.  Came out great!  I also drizzled a little extra olive oil on towards the end to thicken the sauce more.  The family loved it so much I'm making more tonight!

Very good, simple recipe and exactly what I was looking for!  I used hot turkey sausage (which tastes JUST like reg. sausage), olive oil instead of butter, and red & yellow peppers.  After the white wine evaporated, I added 3 cups of homemade marinara sauce and served it over rigatoni.  Everyone had seconds, and I finished it today for lunch! Delicious!!

Excellent recipe, long on flavor and super simple. I subbed beer for the wine and served over brown rice. Considered cooking in the oven or crockpot, but I was not willing to give up that extra kick of flavor the sausage browning step imparts to the dish.

WOW! First, my husband is from New York and he LOVED this! The taste is amazing although I followed his direction (just a tad). I added bell peppers (no red) and used beer with both sweet and hot Italian sausage. He wants to eat this everyday! It was a little too spicy for the little one, so if you have kids, use the sweet sausage. This was unbelievable! I did add a about 1/2 cup of beer as the veggies were simmering instead of the 1/4 cup. It worked beautifully! I highly recommend this recipe and adjust it to suit your tastes - I really don't think you could go wrong no matter what peppers you use and no matter whether or not you use beer or wine. Beer was our preference and the taste was really, really good. I would not serve this over rice as some have, but rather stuff it in good sandwich rolls....delicious.

I registered on this site for the sole purpose of favorably reviewing this recipe. As a previous reviewer said, most Italian-Americans likely have a family recipe for this dish. Unfortunately, my attempts to recreate it have been undermined. My main issue was cooking the sausage enough without burning it, while still having some of the charm of a char, so to speak. This recipe takes care of that with the inclusion of the wine and the low-heat simmering. Even if the sausage is a tiny bit pink (as mine was) after frying, it finishes perfectly in the wine. The combination of flavors was spot-on; this is a great recipe to use as a foundation, then adjust as you prefer. My house still smells like these fragrant ingredients and this recipe will be my "new" "Old World" dish from now on.

Make this recipe tonight, you won't be disappointed. I added extra virgin olive oil to cook the garlic. The key ingredient is the wine, it really brought out the flavors. I served the dish on Italian bread.
I'm ready to set up my sausage & peppers booth at the Feast of San Gennaro.

Fantastic!  Definately one of my favorites.  For a less fat meal, try turkey italian sausage and wheat pasta.  Same idea but better for you!

Great Recipe. Made it as one of several buffet items for a recent party. Only has Marsala cooking wine on hand so used that and only half the wine called for and it was great. I might throw the peppers in a little later next time as I prefer them a little firmer.

I was skeptical at first (especially because my husband is so picky) but it got such rave reviews I had to try it. DELICIOUS!!!  I will continue to make this time and again!  It has such a great flavor to it. I'll probably throw in a few hot sausages with the sweet next time to seee how that tastes.

This recipe was so yummy!! It's a nice, basic recipe and the great thing is that it's versatile as well.  It's easy to make different variations.  I used two different flavors of chicken sausage, added more onions both white and red, scallions, yellow and red peppers, quartered mushrooms, a bay leaf, salt, pepper and a pinch of red pepper flakes.  I cooked it in beer and the liquid that was created was very flavorful!  It would have been nice to have some potatoes to serve it over, or maybe next time I'll try throwing a few potatoes in and cooking them right along with it.  Everyone loved it!

I use olive oil instead of butter and I omit the white wine.  But, this recipe is great.  It's good to eat on a plate, on a hoagie roll, on a pizza crust with some sauce and cheese, etc.  I love this recipe because it is simple and versatile.

This was a great, simple recipe.  I used beer instead of wine ('cause I like beer better) and put the mixture on hoagie rolls and toasted them under the broiler.  Next time I'll put some provolone cheese on top.

This recipe is terrific. Will make lots of times. I too substituted beer for the wine, also think this recipe cries out for mushrooms so I added those. Next time I will throw in a handful of capers and a few sliced olives with pimentoes. Great recipe. Husband loved it.

This was a tasty recipe and very quick and easy!  The used sweet Italian turkey sausage and used a red and yellow bell pepper and it turned out great!!  It was a slightly healthier version.  I served it on sub rolls and melted provolone cheese on top of it in the broiler before serving.

This was excellent!!  I followed other reviewers ideas on beer instead of wine, I used fresh basil and oregano, and served it with provalone on hoagie rolls.  My fam raved.  My 9 and 10 year olds even said it was good.  We'll be eating this over and over.  It was easy too.

This was sooooo good.  Made these changes:  used hot turkey sausage instead of pork, used sherry instead of white wine.  This was easy and quick.  We put it in a french roll with provolone cheese on it and put it under the broiler for a minute.  My husband said it might be the best sandwich he ever tasted, in fact he said that he could eat these sandwiches every day...that is saying a lot considering he never gives recipes above a 4 star.

This recipe is really good...even better if you use fresh basil and oregano. I grated a little Parmesan cheese on top when serving.

Really, Really enjoyed this recipe.  Not having sweet Italian sausages on hand I used the hot and it was delicious.  I think the peppers took some of the heat out of them because they were not very hot.  Will definitley make it again.  Tks.

This was very good but i added a can of stewed diced tomatoes.  I wanted more juice because i wanted to serve over pasta. I maybe even could have added a few mor stewed tomatoes.

nice flavour.  I did add about 1/2 a can of diced tomatoes to make it more like a sauce.  I put it on some penne pasta and it was very good.  The wine gives it a nice flavour that makes it different from regular sauce.  I would make it again.

Very good and basic. I used chicken sausage and  added some quartered baby red potatoes which I microwaved for a few minutes instead before adding them in.  Made a complete meal. I used white cooking wine instead of white wine. Also used olive oil instead of butter

I made this recipe for dinner tonight. I substituted Italian seasoning for the basil and oregano and olive oil for the butter, otherwise I followed the directions as written. My husband said it was the best Italian sausage he'd ever eaten. I served it sausage rolls with roasted asparagus and roasted potatoes. Tomorrow night I plan to serve the leftover sausage and peppers with a good marinara sauce and zucchini noodles. I will definitely be serving this again.

I made this close to the exact recipe, with the exception that I used some olive oil along with the butter and instead of fresh garlic, I used dried.  The olive oil was an oversight, call it an assumption, that I began the saute with and then realized the recipe called only for butter.  Oh well, no harm done.  Used PInot Gricio for the wine.  Delicious.  I think this is an easy and forgiving recipe.

I didn't have fresh garlic so I used powdered. I took the advice of another comment and used beer and olive oil instead of wine and butter. It was served on Wilfred mushroom fettuccine. This will be a new comfort food for me!

I make something similar to this which my family and I like better.  Without writing out the entire recipe simple remove half of the sausage and in its place add two chicken breasts cut up into small bite size pieces also consider adding in large can of crushed tomatoes and a cup of dry white wine or dry vermouth.  In the finial minute or two of cooking add the juice of 1/2 of a lemon to brighten the flavors.  One last trick is always say the rinds of your Pecorino and Parmigiana cheese and when cooking a dish like this toss them in while the dish is simmering and then fish them out and discard them before plating they add great flavor.

This recipe makes a lot of food.  Now, I am not complaining!  It is amazing how all of those onions and peppers cook down.  I used 3 sweet and 3 mild sausages.  Next  time I will do 2 sweet, 2 mild, and 2 hot.  Maybe a teaspoon of tomato paste wouldn't hurt, but this dish was quite tasty as is.  Kudos to the submitter.

Excellent. Very flavorful. There was enough liquid that I could serve it over pasta without the pasta being dry. Hubs was salivating with the aroma of garlic throughout the house. I followed recipe as written but I did use half sweet and half hot sausage. I've been cooking sausages peppers and onions for years but usually used with a red sauce. This recipe made it's own sauce thereby allowing all the flavors to come through in the dish.

I had some fresh thyme handy so added a teaspoon chopped in addition to the basil and oregano.   You could probably swap any or all of these for your favoite herbs de provence blend.  I substituted 1/2 cup of a lager type beer  for white wine.   Again, it's just what I had on hand.  I think browning first then final cooking the sausage at the end with the lid on really makes a difference hear.  The juice you get in the pan is absolutely delicious and there's plenty of it since you didn't start out with fully cooked, and much drier,  sausage.

It was a hit at our recent family gathering!  I mixed 1/2 sweet and 1/2 hot Italian sausage and baked at 350 for 1 hour, drained most of the liquid and added the rest of the ingredients plus 1/4 cup white wine.  It was wonderful!  Thanks for sharing.

I used regular size sausage, need to find smaller bite size.  But over all, we liked it.

Very good recipe for Italian sausage and peppers. One of my favorites. I served this on pasta. I usually add tomatoes to mine but either way its great. Serve with some crusty bread and a salad, and its a happy kinda dinner day :)

Awesome recipe the whole family loved. Very simple and quick to make, but you would never know by the taste.  Full of flavor from a few simple ingredients. This will be made many times in the future. Since some reviewers suggested adding a marinara sauce or tomatoes, I decided to make a sauce as an option since I didn't know how this was going to taste. I tried it with and without  the sauce. Much much better without.  The flavor of this dish  was perfect  and needed no help!

This is my first review after 3yrs of being here. This is THE BEST! I followed it exactly and it was sooo good. 2nd time I followed a suggestion and added one can of diced tomatoes and one fire roasted. Let it all cook for 45min and served over pasta. I may never make spaghetti sauce again!

I left the sausages whole and served them on hot dog rolls.  this recipe is simple but delicious.  I will have it often.  The onions and peppers are great over rice.

This was excellent. The only change I made was that I put my sausage links in a baking pan drizzled with just about 1 tablespoon of olive oil, shaking the pan to coat all sides of the sausages. I baked them at 350 for about 30 minutes and prepared everything else in the skillet while the sausages cooked. When all done, I placed the entire sausage link on a club roll and covered with the peppers & onions. It reminded me of my childhood when I would go to Italian feasts in Little Italy in NYC.

Fantastic! I like to rate the recipe based on the original directions and this was absolutely great as written. I did take 2 cans of stewed Mexican recipe tomatoes and threw them in a blender and made a spaghetti to go with it and I think the flavor from the stewed tomatoes put this even more over-the-top!

First time I made this, I listened to too many other raters.  I used olive oil and red wine.  It was very good.  This time I used the butter and white wine.  Butter works better.  It combines with the wine to make a great smooth sauce.  The only changes I made was after I tried and loved it.  I wanted to have more veggies, so I sliced up a couple thin zucchinis and some sun  dried tomatoes.  OMG!  Even my dad said it was very good.  He never says anything is good.  Usually it's, "it's okay".  Oh, I made one other change.  I used fresh basil and no oregano.

Make it all the time...the only thing I change is the number of sausages...I use 8, only because that's how they're packaged in my market.  Don't chintz on the onions either...2 good sized onions, one red ,one yellow.  I love this recipe as does my wife.  Good for 4 nice meals.

I made just a couple changes for my taste and one for cooking. I used red, orange, and yellow bell. I don't like green.  Then to offset all that sweet,  I used hot Italian sausage. Then I used 3/4 cup wine and simmered longer,  so the peppers we cooked more. Add wine to your own glass as needed.

Made it exactly as written except I baked the sausage.  On my portion I added hot crushed red pepper.  Can't live without it.  I was afraid it was going to be bland, but my husband went back for seconds saying "this is good stuff".   I have made similar in the past, but not with the spices and wine.  I served it over pasta.  Tomorrow I am going to buy rolls for the minimal leftovers.  Thanks for sharing this.

Love this! Made it with almost 5lbs sweet sausage that I browned in oil first in cast iron casserole dish. Took off fire and added peppers and onions. Threw in minced garlic, red wine, 28oz can of crushed tomatoes and some basil and oregano. Threw it in oven at 350 with lid on for few hours stirring occasionally. Made it day in advance and reheated next day at 350 for about 30 mins and then kept warm at low temp 130 until ready to serve. Served with crusty Italian bread. Rave reviews!

This is a true Italian favorite!  The only change I made was to sauté the sausages in EVOO instead of butter (for flavor), and I used a little bit less of the dried herbs because they're strong, and I didn't want them to overpower everything.   This was delicious!  Next time I'll slice the sausages, cook them, and mix them in w/the sautéed peppers & onions - in order to make 'subs' (grinders).  I'll top off the mixture on the bottom of the bun with a combination of shredded mozzarella & parmesan cheese, and some of my homemade marinara sauce.... then put the top of the bun over that and toast it in the oven for a couple of minutes.  Nevertheless, the 'original' recipe was fantastic, so it wasn't my intention to take-away from it.

This was good.  I made a couple changes:  Sausage was precooked so added it later. Used olive oil instead of butter, sauted onions and 12 cloves of garlic first, then added bell peppers, mushrooms zucchini, rounded tsp oregano, rounded tsp basil, a shake of hot peppers, parsley-added in the cooked sausage.  Served over brown rice rigatoni with shaved parm-great!

We really enjoyed this recipe! I used a smoked sausage, which in its own right was wonderful but I look forward to using a good Italian sausage next time.
I had fresh basil and oregano growing in the yard so I added that instead of dried and it added a wonderful flavor.
Thanks for the great recipe!

Made this and loved it.  I live alone so I cut the recipe in half and froze the leftovers.  I also cheated and started with Johnsonville brand pre-grilled Italian sausage.  The sausage comes in Mild Italian Links and Sliced Italian Sausage.  Simplifies the whole process and makes sure that the sausage is fully cooked,

This is hubbys favorite quick meal. Mine is a little different as all Italians learn from their families way of making dishes. I use olive oil in the pan instead of butter, I cut up sweet sausage before adding to pan and start it browning then throw in everything else and add sliced potatoes, also we dont add the wine as the juice from the sausage and oil adds enough flavor. I leave the top on for 20 minutes to get everything cooking then take it off once potatoes are almost cooked to let them crisp up a bit. Served with a big slice of italian bread this is a hearty meal for us.

Gigi, this was amazing! I needed a bigger batch, so I tweaked it a little. Used five 5-in. links of sweet Italian sausage and one pkg of Butterball turkey sausage. Browned sausages whole, then sliced them and thoroughly cooked pieces. Removed them from skillet. Carmelized a huge sweet onion with garlic and butter. Added 14 oz can of unseasoned petite diced tomatoes and 1/2 cup red wine. Then added sliced peppers (green, red, yellow). Added sausage back in. Cooked about 15 min. Towards end, sauce was still thin, so as another reviewer suggested, I thickened by adding 1 Tbl cornstarch mixed in 1 Tbl water. By thoroughly cooking the sausage first, I didn't have to risk overcooking the peppers and retained their snap. Served with bowtie pasta. Satisfied six hungry adults. Thanks Gigi!

This is a good recipe over spaghetti because after cooking the onions and peppers for 15 minutes with the sausage, the vegetables became too mushy.  The wine gave it a different taste which was ok.   I added a jar of spaghetti sauce with the spaghetti.  It was a nice change.

Delicious! My husband can't stop saying how good lunch was. We made a few substitutions as we didn't have white wine or fresh basil. Marsala for the white wine and marjoram for basil. And half butter half olive oil. And we did ours all on the grill with a cast iron skillet. Amazing!

Looking to use an orange bell pepper and a red one that were in the fridge I found this recipe. Delicious. Love it.  No wine except sherry so I used that and I didn't have a purple onion. I had three sausage links that were about 3 or 4 oz. each.  Because someone else suggested it I added 8 oz. of tomato sauce.  Served it on rotini pasta. With only half the amount of sausage and served on pasta this made 4 servings.

I've never done this but I'm writing a review based on modifications I made. I'm making this for supper tonight. Once I had the peppers, onions and garlic sautéed in olive oil and softened, I kept tasting it and agreed with others. It lacked flavor. First I added 1/4 C. beer, because that sounded good. Nothing. I then added a healthy splash of white wine. Cooked down quickly and still tasted bland. So then I sprinkled on some red wine vinegar, about 2 T. That, along with some smoked sea salt, did the trick for flavor. I also felt the veggies could have cooked for less time as we too, prefer a crisp/tender texture.I don't believe in reviewing recipes that you don't make as written but I really felt I had to add my little two cents on this recipe.

Made this again but multiplied all ingredients by 4 for a party and it was a huge hit with my Italian family!

This was excellent! My hubby said it tasted like a pizza on a bun! Per the suggestions of other viewers, I added a can of diced tomatoes with the peppers and onions, i cooked it long enough so a lot of the water reduced.  Then I added the wine and sausage! I think the recipe would be just as good without the tomatoes!! We served it on hoagies with pepper jack cheese. I think it'd be very good on noodles as well! Either way we'll find out because we will make this again!

Wow! So good!Everyone raved about this dish at the family Christmas dinner. Using half butter and half olive oil, I put the onions on way before the peppers and garlic to get them carmelized then used chicken broth in place of the wine and added about a 1/4 cup marinara sauce and a sprinkle of red pepper flakes before the last simmer. Served with baked Ziti or on a roll. It was awesome!

This is one of our favorites because you can adjust the onions and peppers to your liking.  We swap out the types of peppers every time we make this & it is always yummy!  We like to use hot turkey sausage to save some fat calories.  Its awesome - - promise.

I was looking for a sausage dish that didn't use some form of tomato in it; not that I don't love it that way, I just wanted something different.  We always have sausage in tomato sauce over pasta, it was a staple of our kitchen.  This has since become our favorite way of preparing after I made a couple of changes; first, I used spicy sausage as we do love the kick.  I doubled the amount of white wine (and I've used red as well, still love it) and I used olive oil instead of butter.  I have served it over rice, in buns and our favorite- over egg noodles.  Very delicious; thank you for sharing.

Olive oil is a great replacement for the butter! A great American twist that my family and I love is to serve the sausage on a bun with a side of baked beans! Always a favorite for family cookouts!

Was really good!! I put mines on a roll as a sandwich and with my extra picky 3 sons had theirs on spaghetti noodles but they ate it all which is surprising because they are the PICKIEST children I have ever seen! Lol. Changed nothing except I bought my onions and peppers precut from the supermarket to save time!

I followed the recipe to a T except I used all spicy sausage.  So good and I am so glad to have found an easy recipe that I will use again and again.  I spooned the mixture on to hollowed out hoagie rolls and it was delish!  Family loved it!

Followed the recipe to the letter and we LOVED it. I was a little worried because I accidentally opened a pretty sweet bottle of wine, but the sweetness was actually a very welcome addition to the spiciness of the peppers (I used hot instead of sweet). I served it with garlic mashed potatoes, which was a nice alternative to pasta. My husband had three helpings! Will definitely be making again.

I make sausage & peppers a tad different but, I  wanted to try this & I really like it! I did not have red onion or green pepper. I used 2 red peppers instead everything else I kept the same! We ate it over Parmesan white rice because I didn't have rolls. Delicious!

Very good recipe. I also use both hot and mild or sweet sausage combos. I remove the skin from the sausage before I cook it. Natural casing get a bit tough. The sausage hangs together nicely and you end up with nifty bite sized pieces that are surprise packages.Also,a bit of Olive oil doesn't hurt.

This is a fantastic dish! I made this tonight and my husband said it was better than some Italian restaurants he' s been too. I followed the receipt almost exactly with the exception of adding a can of diced tomatoes to create a bit of a sauce. I served over angel hair pasta. I will definetly make this again.

Great starter recipe! I didnt have fresh vegetables and ended up using frozen, carrots, onions, sweet peppers, and celery.  Last night i added beer ate it on hoagie rolls with musturd, LOVED IT ! Today for lunch i added marinara sauce and loved it even more ! On a hoagie roll, it was like eating a meatball sandwich. I could eat this either way! Hope you enjoy this .

Pretty much kept to the recipe and I'm glad I did. It was very flavorful.  I didn't have a green pepper so I used an orange one to go with my red one.  At the end I did add some salt and pepper and a little garlic powder.  Yummy.  Tonight we just had it with some garlic cheese toast (no pasta) but I think I'll make some mashed potatoes to go with it next time.

I have made this recipe several times now. Seriously really good! I do add a can of diced italian tomatoes, a couple of large cloves of garlic, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper for some more flavor. I have tried white wine, red, wine, and most recently a couple of splashes of red wine vinegar. The vinegar version is my favorite!

Got rave reviews. I'll add one more bell pepper next time. By the way, I used turkey sausage. I used some butter for flavor, but when more oil was needed I added grapeseed. Extra light olive oil would also work great.

Delicious! I used spicy italian sausage instead of mild and olive oil instead of butter.  I also added a bit more white wine to create more of a sauce.  It turned out fantastic.  I will be making this again!

Very tasty. I made them for a congregation lunch and everyone loved them. I substituted olive oil for the butter, used some black pepper, and a little garlic salt for seasoning to. They were a hit with my family as well :)

I took the advice of naples34102 and used red wine, fresh basil and added marinara sauce. For the wine, I halved the recipe but must have poured in at least half a cup so that I have enough sauce over my penne.

At my daughter and son-in-law's awaiting the birth of twin girls - their 3rd and 4th surprise. Cooking for my son-in-law is a challenge - he eats very little green.  I'm hoping the smell of this alone will capture his  attention as he comes thru the door after work. 
If this tastes 1/3 as fantastic as it smells, how wonderful. Will post results - other than tasting as I'm cooking - which is WOW.
Don't know how or what I'd do without ALLRECIPES. Thank you GIGI9801 for an easy, healthful, tasty meal. A super HIT We all love this. It will get served often.

Great recipe.  Only made two minor changes.  I used spicy italian turkey sausage and added some fresh italian parsley.   By browning the sausage first and deglazing the pan with the butter, the sauce came out really rich and flavorful.

This wasn't quite as awesome as I'd been hoping for, but it was still very nice. I made it exactly as written, though my sausages were a little smaller than 4 oz. each. (There was still plenty of sausage in proportion to the other ingredients, though.) The wine I used was a Pinot Grigio, and I wound up cooking everything for about 20 minutes. This is a very colorful dish too. I was a tiny bit baffled about having this as an entree; I wondered if it should be on a bed of spaghetti, or with a side of risotto, or what - It seemed a little incomplete as is. Despite those minor quibbles, this is well worth making again, perhaps with some hot sausage as suggested.

I loved this and so did my Italian hubby.  Since I was out of wine (sad day) I used Italian dressing and a small can of tomatoe sauce. This is a meal that is definitely company worthy.

I wanted make it more saucy, and more flavor. Before carmelizing the onion, I added some pepper flakes for heat, and when done sautéing the veggies, I had several vine perfectly ripped tomatoes (that I boiled and peel the skin then diced) so I added for sauciness. Because I didn't have sweet sausage, I added brown sugar for sweetness, all done in Dutch oven, and let it simmer for an hour. I tripled the wine and like other viewers said, I used olive oil over butter. This was hot and sweet with ton of flavor!!!!!! Of course I served it with garlic pasta and the boys literally licked the plate!!!! Awesome!! Another jewel recipe to my folder!!! Thank you!! (^__^)v

I think I liked this slightly better than the same thing but baked with potatoes in it as well. DH preferred the other. Whatever. It tastes the same either way, I just like the noodles better plus this one is faster since there's no waiting around on potatoes to cook in the oven! Thanks for sharing.

This is the best way to cook Italian sausage with peppers. We like to eat them on hoagies topped with marina sauce or with penne or rotini pasta. Thank you so much!

Making this for years, Old family recipe, but we cut the sausage when it's frozen and bake in the oven at 400, a little rosemary salt and pep and some water. Add the juice and sausage to a pot and cook all together.

This smelled sooo good while cooking, the neighbors were coming over to ask what was for dinner! We ate ours on rolls. I threw the leftovers in spaghetti sauce the next night! Loved it!

It was a bit bland when I cooked the recipe as it was written. I added a can of diced tomatoes (like others) and added 2 tbs of Balsamic Vinegar. My teen sons loved it.

My husband loved this recipe.  It seems fairly true to being authentic and each flavor is distinguishable in the dish.  I am not a huge fan of sweet sausage, but he is and gave it 5 stars, so I'm rating it accordingly.

I made this twice in the last two weeks for 30-40 people each time.  Fantastic reviews.  I only use sausage from Sam's Club (Esposito's brand).  Several people commented they thought it had been catered.  This is the only recipe I'll use and I have passed it on to several people.

Delicious! Didn't have white wine, so just skipped that step and it was still great! We served it over rice and it was awesome!

Sooooo GOOD! Changes: I used hot sausage because we like spicy and omitted the red onion but added mushrooms because my mother used to sometimes add mushrooms to her sausage, peppers and onions. Added a 15 oz can of tomato sauce, kosher salt and and freshly cracked pepper to taste and used just a splash of wine. We served this over rotini. We will make this again!  Oh, wanted to add that sometimes the peppers take forever to saute, so after slicing I put them in a bowl, put in one teaspoon of water, cover and microwave for 1-2 minutes. That seems to soften them up and helps quicken the cooking time, although I do cook the peppers, onions and mushrooms until they are carmelized for increased flavor.

I made this today with sweet chicken sausage. I didn't have any white wine so I used a little beer instead. I also used olive oil instead of butter and I used an Italian seasonings grinder mill for the spice. Delish! Looks like we are having sausage, peppers, onions and scrambled eggs with cheese on a roll for breakfast tomorrow too! Thanks for sharing!

My Italian grandmother made this recipe and not the type with sauce (gravy).  I looked up the recipe to make sure I remembered it correctly, and did, for the most part.  The wine was a new variant for me.  Tried it and liked it.

This recipe is great!  I made a few changes..like alot of people I used olive oil instead of butter.  I used 1/2 cup of red wine and I also added 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes and a 15 oz can of stewed tomatoes.  My husband and I loved it!

This was super tasty, and a different take on sausage & peppers than I have had in the past.  I did modify the recipe slightly.  I used italian peppers and yellow onions, added some fresh rosemary and basil with the garlic.  Started with olive oil vs. butter and I used Chicken Sausage with basil and sundried tomatoes.  I grilled the sausages and then added them at the last 5 minutes of cooking.  Served it on a hoagie roll and it was absolutely delicious and somewhat healthy!  Will definitely make this again.

I give this 4 stars because I made some significant changes to lower the calorie/fat count. I used Jennie-O Hot Turkey Italian Sausage, substituted country crock lite for the high fat butter. With these small changes the calorie count was 191/serving and 7 grams of fat. Very good though. I served over brown rice and will definitely make again.

This was fabulous! I wanted to make something more similar to a casserole, so I chopped up the sausages before I cooked them, put it all in an oven-safe dish, mixed in some spaghetti sauce and cooked pasta, and covered it with twisted, store-bought bread sticks (kind of like a pie crust on top). I will definitely make this again. Thanks for the recipe! :o)

I made this dish as stated with the exception of adding a yellow pepper and not using the red onion.  Really enjoyed the flavor the wine gave to this dish.  Will definitely make again.

OK... I cooked this up last week and it was really outstanding even for a beginner such as myself. I made it again tonight and it was even more spectacular! Both times I added some fresh diced tomatoes in the last stage and boiled some pasta to toss in. This second time I used the 'spicy' Italian sausage and I would pat myself on the back but after eating as much as I did, I can't reach. My wife thinks I'm a chef. Ha! Seriously, this is a really, really nice recipe. Thanks for sharing it GiGi.

I made this with a broc. rabe and provolone sausage I picked up at the Italian Market but I cant wait to make it with a mix of hot and sweet to give it some heat. I put the mix on hoagie rolls to eat as a sandwich, but I want to try it over pasta next time.

I followed it exactly as written and found it to be an OK recipe.  Nothing that had me saying, "wow!", but not bad either.  In the future I'd like to increase the quantity of wine and try switching the white wine for red, and also the addition of crushed tomatoes.  I feel those changes will make this recipe out of this world!

This is a great start but I added to it.  I throw in some potato (just cut up) and use olive oil instead of butter. I also changed the way I cook this, I throw everything into pans & roast it in the oven (Much less cleanup!).  When it's all done, I cut up the sausage and mix it all up - YUM!!  Have some really good bread on hand & a nice salad!

I've been looking for an authentic and delicious recipe for Italian sausage with peppers and onions for some time, and have finally found it here.  Everything about this recipe is superb, although for a true taste of Italy, I added 1/2 a jar of marinara sauce.  I left the sausages whole, which will double the cooking time.  We left the house after dinner, and when we came back an hour later, it smelled like an Italian restaurant or a pizzeria, and when I heated up leftovers at work the next day, my coworkers literally stopped in their tracks and commented on how delicious it smelled.  You know you've got a winner when people compliment the smell of your cooking without even tasting it.  This one's a 5-star keeper.

This recipe was the best I've found...but I did a variation using red, orange and yellow peppers and no wine.  It's the ONLY sausage and peppers I've ever liked!  It's got the sweetness of the peppers and I served it in long rolls; fair style.   SO EASY, I love it.

I love this recipe!  I add a can of diced tomatoes as per other suggestions and it's amazing!  I make it all the time, over pasta or on crusty rolls as sandwiches.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Wonderful, just wonderful.  Only addition I made was to put some garlic butter spread on our hoagie rolls.  Our family just can't get enough garlic.

Excellent sausage and peppers.  Bf doesn't like wine so I left that out and instead used water and beef bullion.  I also added a can of diced tomatoes with liquid, and just simmered everything together.  I didn't add butter or oil bc I added the liquid before I put in the veggies.  Didn't cut up the sausage since I wanted to serve as sandwiches on hot dog buns.  Very delicious and flavorful.  Bf had 3 sausages--two with the peppers and cheese on a bun and one plain.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for a sick friend, and it was the perfect freeze-now-eat-later meal. I left the sausages whole, since that's how we like them. I never thought of cooking the ingredients with wine before, but I will from now on!

Delicious.   I added a yellow bell pepper (because I bought a 3 pack), a 28 oz can of drained crushed tomatos, and a little bit extra white wine to deglaze the pan.   I served with toasted pita halves, and the kids couldn't get enough.

Not that this recipe needs one more great review, but this was delicious!  The only changes I made was to use chicken stock rather than white wine and to use EVOO rather than butter.  Served with garlic mashed potatoes. EDIT:  I make this all the time now.  It is in our standard rotation.  My hubby loves it.  I use a full red onion as well as a yellow one.  So easy and so delicious.  Thanks for the recipe!

Loved it! I simmered the whole concoction all day long and it was wonderful. The first time I made it I cut the sausages and used it as a side dish which every one seemed to really enjoy. The second time I made it I kept the sausages whole and bought some hard rolls. Sausage sandwiches with the pepper mixture on top, oooohhhh just thinking about it makes me really hungry.

Delicious and easy with many possibilities. I cooked it following the recipe but did not slice, we served them with buns. Maybe next time i would add a can of crushed tomatoes like other viewers suggested. Can be served with noodles, rice or just along mashed potatoes. We used hillshire farms sweet and hot sausage. Yummy.

I have used a similar recipe for years.  I use both hot and sweet sausages, and do them on the grill.  I take a piece of tinfoil and roll the edges up and do the peppers on the grill also, then right at the end I add the sausages after they have been browned.   Yummy!  Every body has has some loved it.

As soon as the onions and peppers are caramelized, I add a little balsamic vinegar and reduce.  Then a touch of tomato sauce and let everything simmer for about 20 minutes.

This was a great sandwich.  I cut the sausage into 2-3" pieces.  I should have sliced them thinner.  It was easy to make and had a great taste.

Very good!  I added 1/2 pkg of tofu (cubed), and, since tofu takes on the flavor of what it's cooked with, it really added to the tastiness of the dish.  We served this over rice, kind of like an asian stirfry.  No leftovers!

Wow--I'm giving this recipe five stars and I don't even love sausage and peppers! Was skeptical about half way through cooking, the onions and peppers weren't softening and cooking as fast as I expected and I wasn't sure what to expect for a turnout. After about an hour or so of simmering on low heat this was ready for consumption and boy did we consume!! I loosely tripled the recipe, used sweet and hot sausage, otherwise followed to a T. This can be a real crowd pleaser for sausage and peppers lovers crowds. Enjoy!

This was SO easy and SO good.  I calculated for 15 servings.  Used sweet, mild and hot Italian sausage, semi-froze the links then sliced them before browning them, olive oil instead of butter and white wine.  Also had some pasta sauce cooked since I was having a party and I put a couple ladles full of sauce in there.  MAAAAN!  It was AWESOME and everyone was RAVING about it.

This was my first time ever cooking this dish and this recipe was great.  It was easy to make and the taste was magnificent.  I served it over penne and there were no leftovers.  I will make this a regular family meal.

I haven't had sausage and peppers this good since an Italian Street Fair in New York years ago!  The recipe is easy and perfect.  We've made it a few times already, we always serve on a hoagie roll.

Great dish. I did not have white wine, so, I used red wine. Also, we do not eat pork,therefore, we used turkey sausage. Served over rotelle pasta and I intend to pack sandwiches for my spouse tomorrow.

I make this a lot during the summer, stuffed in hoagie rolls and topped with
either pepperjack or provolone. Very good with spicy fries. Never fails to disappear quickly off my table!

This is a keeper. I used chicken Italian sausage because that's what my store had on hand. I don't think it would have been any better with regular Italian sausage. I will definitely make this again.

Only change I made was to use chicken broth instead of wine and olive oil in place of the butter.

Really good!  I made this with turkey sausage, red and yellow peppers, and a little extra onion.  Bagged and put in freezer for reuse - is great with prepared tomato sauce over pasta or just on a sub roll.

Great basic recipe.  I fiddled with the ingredients a little (spiced it up) and it still came out yummy.  I used chicken broth instead of the white wine and, although I found it a little greasy, my fiance wants to have it again soon.  Thanks for posting it!

This was excellent.  I browned the sausage a little bit more after sliced.  I also used whiskey (Crown Royal) instead of wine since I was out, maybe not a whole 1/4 cup, but it was still really good.  Didn't taste like whiskey.  Great dish!

Very simple to prepare, making this a tasty  option for a weeknight meal.  I served in big rolls, sprinkled the top with a generous potion of shredded mozzarella cheese, and put in the broiler for a minute or two.

This was the bomb!  I cut the sausage lengthwise so you had the choice of eating it either in a roll or just on your plate.  It was delicious!  I would highly recommend and I will serve it to guests at our next Nascar race get together!  Yummy!!

This is an even easier and less messy recipe when made in the oven.  Omit the white wine.  Cut the sausage in 1-2" chunks and mix with other ingredients.  Bake  in a 9x13" pan for 30 minutes at 350 then add 1 bottle of a lager beer,stir  and bake an additional 30 minutes.  Serve on good hoagie rolls such as Amaroso.

This recipe was a nice surprise.
I cut the sausage when it was half frozen
(much easier to handle)
1/2 cup of Beer.  
A pinch of red pepper flakes.
Served on top of simple white rice (all I had on hand).
I honestly didn't think it would be all that great, but it really was VERY TASTY!!!!
Defintely will make again.

I have made this several times and as suggested use beer instead of wine and slice the sausage while still slightly frozen.It is good with just green peppers also.This is a quick & easy recipe,thanks to all the different reviews, it is easy to substitute ingredients, if necessary. Good over rice or pasta.

Excellent Recipe. Made it for a large party and it was a HUGE hit. I served it in a crock pot as an hors d'oeuvre. I cut the links into 4 pieces. I also used Sherry and Marsala wines. I oven cooked the sasuage instead of frying. Wonderful.
Thank You.

This recipe is divine!! I don't even like bell peppers and I would eat this every day if I could! I used a yellow pepper instead of green just because that's my preference. I put the mixture on a hamburger bun and it was DELICIOUS!! I am definitely making this again and putting this in my permanent recipe box!

So simple, I just use one type onion, whatever is in the fridge.  If I don't have wine, I'll use balsamic vinegar.  Olive oil instead of butter also works.

This was great! I'm not much of a sausage person but wanted to try something different. This was quick and easy to prepare which is always a plus with my busy schedule. Thanks for the recipe and keep them coming!!!

This was fabulous.  I have not had this dish in years.  I used beer instead of wine.  I used 6 cloves of garlic and 2 each Green, yellow and red peppers, added garlic and onion powder.  I also used 2 lbs of the Italian sausage.  I served this over 1 lb of egg noodles seasoned with butter, garlic pepper and a dash of olive oil.  Thanks for the recipe, the family loved it.

This was very good and very easy to make.  I didn't have any wine or beer so I used chicken broth and it worked well.  I served on brotchen rolls but I think next time I will use french bread instead.  I also topped the sandwiches with heated marinara sauce and that really tasted good with this.

Great starter recipe. I double the whole  recipe. Sausage part hot and sweet. Then added a marinara sauce you can do that to taste. Came out excellent.

My husband devoured 5 of these in a 20 hour time span... I substitued the beer for the wine and served on toasted buns with red sauce.  I am making them again tonight at his request, and am serving them at my daughter's 5th birthday party!!  Not exactly kid food, but my husband will be a very happy man!

We love this recipe. I usually stick to the recipe but add some suted mushrooms to it then put at on a great hoagie type roll and top it with some provolone cheese. Put that in your broiler and melt the cheese over the sausage, peppers and mushrooms, then just go ahead and kiss yourself because you will love it!

This was a great recipe. I am not a fan of sausage but the peppers and onions really toned down the taste and the flavors blended together perfectly. This recipe is a keeper.

Easy to make, however, I prefer to slice the sausage when it is slightly frozen as that makes it easier to slice and besides you don't run the risk of burning your fingers.  I have made a few times when I am running late for dinner, my son loves it.

My husband and I thought this was very good, but the kids turned their noses up.  I also added a half tsp. on ground anjo chili for a little extra punch.  I will definitely make this again, but so that it's not so soggy next time I will saute the veggies and sausage separately and remove from the pan, then deglaze with the wine and cook it down by half before adding everything back in at the end to heat through.  I think a tsp. each of thyme and marjoram would be a nice touch too.

This was so good!  I substituted beer for the wine (didn't want to open the bottle for 1/4 cup).  I served it over pasta with a can of diced tomatoes  and parmesan.  Next time will try it on a roll with provolone.

A definite hit at my house. We did as one reviewer suggested and topped with provolone cheese. We broiled buns, topped with sausage mixture and cheese, broiled some more. Delicious!

Love this recipe!!
I used the beer instead of wine like another person had suggested and added a chopped tomato as well. It was a winner!! My husband adored it and so did my 2 year old son. Next time I think I'll add an extra red pepper as it was very meaty.

Simple to make, delicious to eat. I love recipes with a few ingredients that cook up quickly and taste as good as this. I cut back a bit on the amounts since there are only two of us and used hot and sweet Italian sausage. Thanks for a really good, quick meal!

Best recipe for italian sausage.  I didn't have a red pepper or a red onion, so only used green pepper and onions and banana pepper.  Used sherry as someone has suggester.  It was a fanstastic dinner, served with hash brown.

Good but not outstanding. I wish it had been saucier - perhaps some spagetti sauce or even canned/fresh diced tomatoes. The leftovers were good on a roll, broiled, with some Provolone cheese. Thanks.

I used hot turkey sausage, only because that's what I had on hand, and it turned out pretty good.  Easy to make, and nice flavor.  Will do leftovers on a nice roll with provelone cheese.

This was an excellent recipe. I've been looking for one like this for a while now. The wine gave it so much flavor. My husband likes spicy sausage, but was very happy with the sweet sausage this time. After cooking, I placed it on some rolls and  added provolone cheese, melted them in the broiler, and YUM! Delicious sandwiches! Thanks so much!!

Hi: This is a very good recipe. I added things that we liked such as instead of wine I used chicken broth. I also added a 14oz can of crushed tomatoes. Then I put over egg noodles. It was great. Thank you.

This was very good.  I used hot italian sausage instead.  I used the olive oil, beer and mushrooms as others suggested.  Served it on a hoagie with melted provolone.  My husband loved it.

This was ok.  My husband made this, so it's always a win if I don't have to cook!  He only used red pepper, but otherwise followed the recipe.  I'm not sure about the wine.  I usually let my sausage coins continue to brown and saute.  By adding the white wine, the coins didn't brown (just the outside was browned from the first step).  We ate this on sub rolls with provolone cheese.  My husband did say that the leftovers he had today for lunch had gotten even better.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was excellent!  I follwed the recommendations of Bassi G - beer instead of wine, olive oil instead of butter, and a yellow pepper instead of green.  I also used turkey sausage.  We put everything on hogies with provolone cheese and melted under the broiler.  They were fantastic!

I am a vegetarian so I used the Boca smoked sausages.  I omitted the white wine and followed the recipe.  It was delicious. The next time I'll try the Boca Italian sausages which have a little kick to them.  It also looks good on the table too!

We loved it!  It was delicious!  My husband thought it was very good.  I served it with a nice salad and garlic bread.  I may try it next time browning the sausage in the broiler.  This would cut some of the calories, as well.  Very good!  Will serve again and will try on company and on the grill.

I just made this last week.  It was delicious.  I blanched the sausage in the microwave with some water for ~5 minutes, then cut it up and browned it in some oil.  I added fresh basil at the end.

Delicious.  I use turkey itaian sausage and add about 3/4 cup chicken broth to give it a little more sauce.  Great over white rice.

Good recipe.  We ate some peppers and onions out of the skillet an hour after our meal was finished and the flavors seemed like they combined more.

This was a little bland. It may have been my fault - I was so worried about making sure the sausage was thoroughly cooked that I cooked it for a while, maybe more than the 15 minutes, after adding it back to the onions and peppers. But either way I think 15-20 minutes of cooking onions and peppers is too long because they will just turn to mush instead of being crisp-tender. I think the recipe has potential, and I"ll try it again not cooking the onions and peppers too long (being sure the sausage is fully cooked before adding it will help). I made rice with this, and it went along okay.

I used fresh basil and fresh oregano instead of the dried basil and oregano.  I also used HOT sausages instead of sweet ones.  While it was cooking, it smelled amazing and it tasted great.  Will make again.

NOT ALL ITALIAN IS PASTA! The first time I made this I made the same mistakes most people make.  This dish is Italian so it  should be cooked in olive oil- not butter.  It's Italian so must have tomatoes or tomato sauce.  Italian- so must be served over pasta.  It turned out to be just more of the same old thing.  Then I went to a local restuarant owned by actual Italians and ate a dish called sausage and peppers in brown butter sauce.  They served it over crusty brown roasted potatoes.  It was so good I thought I would die!  So I tried ths again as written only I used sweet red wine instead of white because that is what I had. Cooked slowly the butter and wine made a nice brown butter sauce.  I served it over potatoes cut into  about one inch cubes, coated in olive oi, garlic and italian spices, and roasted until brown and crusty. Also served  a small  salad and garlic bread.  The meal turned out very much like the meal the restaurant serves.  My husband loved it!

This was a last minute selection last night, and although I didn't have any fresh Garlic Cloves on hand, I used Garlic Salt as a substitute, and the recipe was delicious.  

Also, I used spicy hot Italian Sausage, so in order to cut down on the hot spicy part for those who don't like hot and spicy, I served the dish over white rice to absorb some of the spicy hot flavor.

Great recipe I followed exactly... except for adding a little more white wine (Biltmore Estate Reisling) during the simmering step.  Even my husband loved it!

I substituted basil infused olive oil for the butter and skipped the red onion and only used yellow onions. It was a huge hit with my husband and his football buddies.

Great Classic recipe. My boyfriend requested sausage and peppers for dinner. First bite he said “When I was thinking about what I wanted for dinner this is exactly the taste I was imagining.”
Recipe Modifications: Italian sausage premixed with scallion & Red Pepper, Pasta sprinkle for Basil, oregano, and thyme, only yellow onion (I thought both onions would be too much for a two person meal), and I added canned diced tomato’s (drained because I was afraid of having too much liquid). One of the reviews said tomato made it more full/bodied and they were absolutely right. Very good addition!

Wish I had found this recipe sooner. The entire family loved it. Not one negative comment. It made a lot so next day I added angel hair pasta to it to extend the serving portions and served with toasted cheese sandwiches. Great economical/on a budget meal.  Will save even more next summer when the garden produces the fresh veggies. Will make this often.

I made this the night before and just reheated the next day. It really was delicious. I’ve cooked and eaten sausage and peppers using other recipes  before but this was one of the best! I will definitely make this again but with hot Italian sausage. Also got rave reviews from my brother and husband.

I didn't have white wine so used red wine vinegar and fresh lemon juice. I'm sure this changed the flavor a bit but it turned out great.

I did make this recipe. I do believe that the quality of your sausages is key.
I purchased my batch from BJs that were in a box of 12 sweet links. First time I bought them as opposed from my local food store, they were delicous, no leftovers. Will make again, was prepared as directed . Thank you , it is a keeper.

Used a Pinot as the white wine. Don't know if it made a difference, but this dish was really good and the rest of the Pinot wasn't too shabby either.

I am on a keto diet.  Instead of wine I used sugar free cran-blackberry juice and added more than the recipe called for.  It was so good!   The whole family, including my picky eater, loved it.

I added a poblano pepper for a little heat and because I didn’t have white wine I used beef stock. I put this over white rice and it was delicious.

Only real changes I made is I used fresh Basil and Oregano (thanks Aerogarden!) and I didn't have white wine so I used red and it was great.  Then I tossed some bowtie pasta and a bit of pasta water into it to finish cooking and it was amazing.

I’ve never rated anything.. I have to rate this..it was awesome. I made it for my little ones 5th birthday..My only change was olive oil instead of butter and I cooked it in a large skillet on low for about 2 hours. I added the peppers in the last half hour bc I was afraid of them turning to mush cooking so long. I really think how long it cooked really melted all those flavors together... it was delicious, everyone loved it.

I just made it...very good! It was too much for one skillet, though, so I had to move half to another pan. I didn't have red onion or garlic, so I just used the yellow onion, and garlic powder. It reminds me of the sausage and peppers I used to have back in New York in college!! I might try that slow cooker version suggested by the other reviewer. That sounds good, and a bit easier.

Doubled the recipe. I like to bake my sausage in the oven, Used both hot and sweet sausage, Used the olive oil instead of butter..  My onions and garlic went into the grease leftover by the sausage.  When onion is done, I remove it and replace with sliced peppers.  I did ad a can of chopped tomato's, basil and oregano ,  Combined everything in a crockpot, threw in some red pepper flakes and kept warm till dinnertime,  it was a big hit.

I made this exactly as written minus a yellow onion because mine had gone bad.  I used cooking white wine as I wasn't sure if the recipe meant that or actual wine.  In any case it worked fine.  The meal turned out very flavorful and I ate more vegetables than I normally do because of it.  This will be my new go to way of making sausage.

Tasted  fine, but need to add more vegetables.  Once everything cooked  the  volume of meat  dwarfed the volume of vegetables.

This was great!!  Very good base recipe.  I took another commentator's suggestion and added a can of crushed tomatoes, left out the herbs as I really didn't think we needed them with the seasoning in the sausage, and I used a bag of frozen pre-cut peppers and onions.  I cooked it in a cast iron dutch oven on the stove for about 30 minutes.  Served it with Parmesan cheese, Italian loaf bread, over rigatoni pasta and my family devoured it!!

I've made this recipe multiple times exactly as written (I won't review it if I made changes, it's no longer the same recipe in my opinion).  I love it! Simple to make and I love the leftovers for lunch the next day. Thanks for sharing it!

Really good. Easy to make. The only thing I did differently is to use 4 cloves of garlic, but I always double or triple the amount of garlic in a recipe (can’t help it).

It is a great base to adapt as needed. I used  italian turkey sausage, turkey broth instead of wine and olive oil instead of butter.  I used a bag of frozen pepper and onion blend. Simple, quick and delicious.

Simple and easy weeknight dinner.  Sausage & peppers was new to my husband. Served with a little pasta and mushroom marinara on the side. He had seconds so I think I can put this in the rotation. Sure is easy. Can’t beat good old-fashioned Italian food, and this recipe is a snap. Thanks!!

So so good! We had a selection of 4 sweet/2 hot sausages which was the perfect amount of spice. Unfortunately we had no white wine in the house and substituted a little juice from pappadelle peppers - we added about 1/3 cup of these, chopped for sweet and spicy zing.

I added some diced tomatoes, Italian seasonings, and brown sugar. Top with provolone/parmesan cheese. Can be put on hoagies, rice, or noodles. You can also make it in the crockpot. After browning sausage/veggies just throw everything in the crockpot on low for 5 hours.

Very tasty and easy - added fresh broccoli shortly after sauteing the onion and garlic and before adding the peppers. Spooned it over cauliflower-rice which completed "the look."

A great base recipe. There’s nothing fancy about sausages and peppers. It’s an old world staple. The flavor comes from the simple vegetables and the sausage meat. As others have mentioned, you can add more seasonings and other veggies for a different twist. This is an easy and quick supper to have on a weeknight.

I use red, yellow, and orange peppers in the dish for added color and the sweet taste of the peppers. Also prefer the hot Italian sausage links. I serve it with homemade spaghetti sauce/pasta.

I forgot the receipe called for the sausage to be cooked whole and sliced it prior to cooking.  We LOVED the recipe anyway. This qualifies  as a change  and I don't think a recipe should be given a 5 if you make modifications. I'm  giving it a 5 anyway!

My first attempt at making this dish, took  A LOT longer to prepare & cook, than posted.  I had difficulty with all of the potatoes getting browned, even using a large cast iron pan.  It was flavorful, but a little too oily, for my tastes.  Not sure if I will make it again or not.

Good on a crusty bun.  Didn’t care for it as a accompaniment to pasta with homemade tomato sauce.   The latter is best combined.  Made recipe twice as directed.

Very quick and tasty. Only change I would make is double the amt of veggies OR half the amt of sausage. The veggies loose their bulk but the sausage doesn't. Used part for a sandwich on a  1/2 baquette and the rest over linquine. Both delicious!

Such a delicious and easy dish! Italian sausage was on sale at Sprouts so I wanted to try. I used olive oil instead of butter and sake as the white wine. Added a can of diced tomatoes. Served over macaroni. I love that it's such a fast meal to whip together.

This is my go-to recipe for sausage and peppers. Don’t skip the wine. That is what makes it. I also use EVOO instead of butter.  I serve this with pasta and Rao’s marinara. So good!

Pretty much followed your recipe, but used Classico basil pesto sauce, instead of dry basil.I also threw in a ring of polish kielbasa, in case my wife didn't like the Italian sausage.

We added a few more things to make more of a sauce, and then we poured it over roasted spaghetti squash! It was delicious and everyone enjoyed it! Plus- I always have this stuff in my cupboard, so I will TOTALLY be making this again!!

I've been searching for a GOOD recipe for sausage, onions and peppers for a long time.  I've had the best -- from Italian friends to the boardwalks in New Jersey.  This is just about the best I've had in a long time.  I know it's the best I've ever made.  I'll be using this recipe from now on.

My boyfriend is vegetarian, and I am trying to eat less meat myself  so we used Tofurkey brand italian sausage and used an italian seasoning blend on the peppers and onions just to give it a little something extra but he loved it !!!! I loved the recipe. We eat a lot so we made a bigger portion and used a little more oil but sooooo good!!!

This was delicioso...although I didn't use green bells, I just used the package of organic mini bells (red, orange, yellow) that I had. I also made skillet potatoes and spooned the sausage bell pepper mixture on top, Soooo goooood! Super easy to make and the even my picky eater liked it.

Good. Used red wine and added mushrooms and a small can of tomato sauce. Put over pasta with fresh basil. Next time I may skip the tomato sauce and put over cheesy grits.

I have made many recipes from AllRecipes over several years.  In that time I have never left a review, but this recipe deserves a review.  I think this is in my top 3 all-time favorites. I served over rigatoni and my husband instantly said, this would be good on Hoagie rolls!  Becuase I served over rigatoni and I didn't have any pasta sauce I did as others have suggested and added a can of crushed tomatoes. I also almost doubled the recipe (10 sausages) so I used 5 sweet Italian sausages and 5 mild Italian sausages. Took some for lunch the next day, and this recipe might be the poster child for "even better the next day"!  I can't wait to make this again soon and serve on Hoagie rolls.  Thanks for sharing this amazing recipe!

This is a very good dish,I used olive oil rather then butter. I also added 2 red peppers and a orange pepper.Used fresh basil and oregano.( I use fresh when I have it).used chicken broth in place of the wine. I like the flavour the red peppers give this dish.Will make it again. Thank you for the recipe.

I followed other’s tips and used hot Italian sausage instead of the sweet, and beer instead of wine. I used 2 onions & 1 each yellow & red bell pepper. I served it on a hot dog bun which was fabulous!

Delicious. the only thing I changed with this recipe is I left out the red onion (upsets my stomach) and before eating I sprinkled some parmesan cheese on top. it was really good, we will definitely make it again. next time I am going to add extra wine and see how it is.

I'm very embarrased to say that I used this on expensive organic specialty sausages that I let get freezer burned.  I give it 5 stars bc it nearly made them eatable.  The vegatable and seasoning recipe is spot on.  We essentially had a fabulous vegatable hoagie.  I'll make this again soon, but with fresh sausages!  Only changes:  had to add a bit of olive oil to sear sausages and popped a bit more white wine in that called for.  Gave it even a sweeter background.  Yum!

I love this - back when I lived in New York, this was called simply "sausage and peppers" -- I guess the onions were assumed.  Great recipe.  I use Jennie-O turkey sausage (sweet Italian style), and they come 5 links to a package.  That cuts down the fat compared to ordinary pork sausage, so I consider the recipe 3 servings and get more veggies and protein per serving.  If you use turkey sausage, I recommend you spray your pan with cooking spray or warm up some oil before adding your sausage links to the pan -- when I put them directly in the pan like the video here shows, they stuck to the pan.

This was very tasty. On a whim, I added. Bit of fennel seed and a bit of celery seed. Served this as is for a fantastic low carb dinner.

I absolutely love this recipe! As suggested, I used 1/2 hot and 1/2 sweet and it was perfect. The only thing I added was cracked pepper and a small amount of salt. Also, I'm a little heavy handed with the basil and oregano and it worked well.

I used a small amount of garlic powder instead of the garlic cloves (I didn't have any) and I think I prefer to taste the more subtle flavors that resulted.  The garlic would have been the predominant flavor with four cloves. Otherwise, it is a simple to make and very flavorful dish.

I love sausage, peppers & onions.  This recipe is easy, quick and very flavorful!!  You could add canned crushed tomatoes.  We like to eat this on a hogie bun so I did not in order to make it easier to eat.

I did not make any changes to the recipe. I just added a regular homemade marinara sauce as an option on the side for everyone to use, if they wanted to. My children thoroughly enjoyed it and I will be making it again.

Loved this will use more wine next time and add heavy cream. I used red pepper flakes which gave it a little zing.

I make this often, but I slice the fried sausage and then add pasta sauce and serve over cooked rice.  Everyone loves it.

We only used one onion because for some reason our grocery store was low on everything! We put the sausage and vegies on toasted hoagies, and topped with a slice of provolone. These were quick and easy. Will make again since such a an easy weeknight dinner. Next time might try with a little marinara.

I used a 16 oz package of Italian sausage links bc that's what I had,  red & yellow bell peppers, red wine, a jar of organic spaghetti sauce, & plenty of garlic.  This all went over a cooked half pound of organic linguine.  Twas yummy. BTW I did not use the butter, just canola oil.

It was something different to try,  I've never had it and neither has my husband. I gave it 3 starts because it was just ok in my opinion and my husband didn't like it . It's worth trying though and was easy to make.

It would have been great except I really didn't like the flavor of the Italian sausage I bought. Not the fault of the recipe at ALL!!  I'll be making it again with a GOOD sausage!!

This was pretty great. The only change I made was to add some sliced baby bella mushrooms because I had some that needed to get used up, and they were great in there, so I'd do that again.

This was really good. Sausage was tender and good flavors. I did use only 1/2 tsp. each of the basil & oregano and added a bit of freshly ground pepper.  We like to eat ours on a bun, so I did not slice the sausage. I will make again.

I have made this recipe on many occasions and  the only thing I change is the method of cooking, I use the oven and the sausages are nice and crisp when I remove them, similar to using the barbecue. Very good recipe.

I needed to cook the sausages a little longer after adding them back with the vegetables. Next time I will cook them more thoroughly in the beginning so as to not lose too much of the sauce, otherwise excellent flavor, put them over gluten free penne pastas and had one happy husband!

Excellent and quick.  Used already cooked andouille sausage (it's what I had), about 2 T tomato paste, chicken broth (no open wine) and evoo.  Served on a hoagie bun that was toasted so it would hold up better.  Perfect on a realllly hot night 'cause minimal heat was expended.  Delish!
Made it again:  used fresh tomatoes because I had them - NOT a good idea.  Skins = yuk.

Love it. Followed recipe plus some extra peppers, a dash of extra wine and a few chilli flakes  would have been fine without it but I mixed it with some pasta for a quick dinner - my spouse and I had 2 bowls each

Simple and delicious! My husband doesn't exactly love to cook so I love that I can tell him this is what we're having and he can throw it together and give me a night off.  We add potatoes to ours and usually skip the wine because I don't keep much white in the house. The whole family loves this dish.

This recipe was so simple and yet so incredibly delicious. There are two people in my family known for making the "best" s&p until I made this last week and blew them both away (words of a family member, though I do agree.) The only changes I made were using 1/2 each of red, green, orange & yellow bell peppers because I don't particularly like green much and I enjoy the flavor when the 4 are mixed. And I didn't use dried basil & oregano I used fresh because I just prefer to always use fresh when I cook. And my onion of choice for this recipe was a Vidalia. Loved how this came out, I am making it again tonight for my love ??

I had to use a merlot for the wine, and that actually gave it a nice, deep flavor and smell that was really nice.  I also used a smoked bratwurst and olive oil.  The olive oil really worked well with the merlot, in my opinion.  Next time I plan to add a little more sausage to get it more filling.  Overall, I really liked this recipe, and it is going to stay in my cooking list.

Awesome simple recipe... I didn't have any white wine in the house so I used 1/4 cup of chicken broth with a tablespoon of white vinegar to deglaze the pan. I also added mushroom to the onion mixture. Then added tomatoe sauce and put these delicious Sausage -n- Peppers  on Italian rolls, Yummy!

This recipe is delicious. I added 20 oz. of chopped tomatoes  to the sauce. I left 2 of the sausages  whole to be served with hoagie rolls, and cut up the rest of the sausages to be served with Penne. It's just my hubby and I so we had two different meals from one recipe.

Wow, this was so good! I used hot sausages and served them on rolls for lunch then served the leftovers on their own for another meal. Both ways were very good. Hubby really enjoyed this too and he's not really a sausage fan. Yum!

Excellent, drained sausage grease before cooking veggies. Used beer instead of wine. Moist and flavorfull! Used olive oil AND butter to equal 2 T.

GOOD EASY. Good for a change. I used white wine , and a little pasta sauce over pasta for a little added extra. I would cook 
peppers less next time and let them cook with meat at end., also no need to cut meat, I don't mind them whole.
Served with a few mushy peas.

I used red wine instead of white, used olive oil instead of butter and added a bit of salt and red pepper flakes (I like food with a bit of kick).  I also added some crushed tomatoes but not so much as to make it soupy.  This was my first time making sausage and peppers and it came out great.  Very easy to make and flavorful.  Will definitely make it again.

I made this for my husband because he LOVES sausages with onions but I really liked it too.  I used 4 spicy Italian sausage and it was plenty!  I cooked rotini pasta and served the dish over them.   I stirred the leftover pasta into the leftover sausage dish and my husband had it for lunch a couple of days later.  He said it was even better because the pasta had really soaked up the flavors.  Next time I'm adding the pasta to the dish right from the start.  It will be even better.

I have made several variations of Peppers, sausage and onions over the years and keep coming back to this one.  I like the flavor the white wine gives and also I like the not heavy marinara take on this dish.  I never seem to have the right fresh herbs for dishes, but I always have dried oregano and basil.  This one is a winner for us.

Loved this recipe.  Super simple and delish. As written it's 4 1/2 stars. I did make a few slight changes which made it a 5 star: used olive oil and butter, doubled the wine, used only red abd yellow peppers, added some chopped tomatoes and chopped  steamed kale, added some salt / pepper and red pepper flakes  to taste. Served with pasta and Parmesan cheese. Excellent!

Fantastic! Just made this for the first time and it may be one of my best finds on this site. I did make 2 subs: I mixed sweet and hot Italian sausage 50/50; and I used a light beer instead of white wine (I was in a pinch when I discovered I didn't have any white wine at the last minute).

I make this recipe all the time but i leave out the oregano as i dont like it that much.  Also most of the time  I just use regular onions and no red onions.   Thanks for the recipe.

sliced up sausage before pan frying.  I then fried up 2 green peppers, lots of onions and two large garden tomatoes .  Combined meat and pepper mixutre along with fresh garlic and red wine and  a large heaping tablespoon of tomato paste. Simmered 5 more minutes to let wine reduce.  Excellent!  Served on top of  a wheat spaghetti and finished with fresh grated parm, rolls and  salad.  Great Dinnner

I added about 3/4 cup mushrooms,  and two cored and diced jalapenos and served over rotini.  Yum!
I think next time I'll add tomato sauce.

I have made this several times and it is always a big hit.  I do add a can of diced tomatoes and I use red wine instead of white as that was what I had on hand the first time.  Great taste.  I serve with spaghetti noodles.

Great basic recipe! Added a can of diced tomatoes and a few other spices, and first night had it on rice, the next night on toasted sausage buns. We all loved it.

Excellent.. I made it like the review stated as much as I could. I had most of the ingredients on hand but used orange pepper instead of green, omitted the red onion, and used water for wine. it still was great.  I cooked up some penne and a small side of marinara. I built mine with all  3 items but others in my family had the peppers alone and a side of penne and marinara.  Everyone loved it - even the one whip doesn't like Italian food!

Once the slicing is done,  this goes together very quickly.  I added small chunks of potato and it makes a great meal. Sometimes I use ground sausage.

I added some hot peppers, used apple juice and a little vinegar in place of the white wine.  It was outstanding.  Another winner found on allrecipes and added to my favorites.

Simple, easy, and yummy. Used spicy turkey italian sausage and all three color peppers. It isn't an overpowering amount of seasoning being added so the flavor of the sausage really is the star. Keep that in mind when selecting which to use. Came together pretty quickly and you can't beat only one dirty pan afterwards!

I cut the sausage up before browning, as a cooking preference. Then I used a sweet onion instead of the yellow onion, then lots of peppers (yellow, orange, and red) and added mushrooms (because, yeah, they're good). I simmered it all with a can of diced tomatoes for some extra sauce. I served it with quinoa and brown rice - my kids raved!

I made this dish and served it on hoagie buns, my kids and I loved it. The onions and peppers blended well and it was like eating a PhilIe sandwich. This will be a regular in our rotation at our home.

I didn't cut up the sausage, just cooked it well with a few tbsp of water in a pot before starting the recipe. Otherwise followed the recipe exactly - had never cooked sausage before and not much of a cook. It turned out beautifully! My husband was so pleased!!!

This is delish. The only substitution I make is the sausage. I brown a smoked sausage that's sliced up because I don't like Italian sausage. It's perfect every other way.

I have made this twice, first time exactly as posted and it was a hit  over  white rice.  Second time, I  added diced  tomatoes and simmered an hour, served with cut ziti pasta.  Again a big hit!  It is an easy recipe and very delicious.  Thank you!  This goes in dinner rotation.

I've had a go to sausage recipe similar to this so I'm not sure why I wanted to try this but I'm so glad I did!! my husband even asked me why haven't you made it this way before? don't make it the other way again! My only difference is that I had precooked polish sausage and it worked just fine!

I added potatoes chopped up, and also added celery chopped! Then cooked it all together at the end with lid on, but had to also add about a cup of water, while cooking it. Cooked it longer, because of adding the potatoes, it takes longer for them to get done!.. but it was really good!.. my boyfriend said it was delicious!!!

Tthis turned out great. I found 6 sausages in the freezer, 3 hot, 3 mild and this was the perfect recipe for them. I did braise the sausage first with lid on and small amount of water in pan, then brown. So moist and tender! Flavor was perfect as directed.

This was fantastic. I made a few small changes. I used hot Johnsonville italian sausages. It wasn't too spicy, but just spicy enough to give it an amazing flavor. I also used half the jar of pasta sauce, instead of the whole jar. I felt a whole jar would have drowned the pasta and some of the flavor of the sausage and peppers as well. I also highly recommend adding the spaghetti to the pan of sausage and peppers, mixing, and cooking together for about a minute. It allows the flavors to bind together perfectly.  I will definitely make this again.

Turned out fantastic. And EXTREMELY easy. Only thing I would change is to use hot sausage... I'm a mother of a 8 month old and I'm still in shock how easy this was to make managing him and cooking.

And I did make changes. They were ones where I didn't have what was asked for in the Recipe.   I just can't afford wine, so used water instead, and used a can of Stewed Tomatoes, and of course I thought I had garlic,, I am never without that.. But I was.. So I was hoping the Stewed tomatoes would work .. And of course I did have the wrong sausages.. but I think it turned out so Good.. Instead of those large bell peppers, I had a bag of baby peppers I had to use,, or toss and so  I had the best tasting Meal I have ever had,, This will be put on my Weekly or even the Monthly Menu.  Yes I did change it a bit,, but I can say I think it tasted as if  a true Italian made it...

Had some red, yellow and orange peppers in the fridge that I needed to use up and a package of Sweet Italian Sausage so I decided to give this a try.  It turned out to be a BIG hit with my family.   I also added fresh mushrooms and garlic and sauted everything in the wine.  I did use more wine than the recipe called for--  as I just kept adding more until the veggies were soft.  I served this over rice that had been flavored with chicken bouillon and it made a quick, easy and flavorful meal. We will definitely be having this again!

I make a recipe similar to this - using 10 sweet Italian brats.  Brown, then put the brats in the crockpot along with the peppers and onions.  Add a 2 c. of Italian salad dressing.  Cook on low 4-5 hours.  Serve on a bun with provolone cheese topped with pepper & onion mixture - YUM!

I used only one pan..cooked the sausage (removed to be sliced) added onions , green peppers, red peppers and orange peppers.  Added the sliced sausage with a cup of Marsala cooking wine.  Finished with fresh tomato and parsley.  
Quite tasty served with rotelle pasta.

I  made meatballs with the sausage meat (used hot Italian sausages) and used red wine because that's what I had on hand.  I also added one chopped up tomato. Served over penne pasta. It was very tasty. I would make this again.

This was an excellent base recipe for using what I had on hand. I only had a pound of ground hot Italian sausage and used chicken broth instead of white wine. I also added a few small chopped tomatoes towards the end of the simmer and a few heaping tablespoons of red marinara sauce out of the jar to add a little extra sauciness. I only made those changes because I wanted this to be more of a ragu than a traditional sausage and peppers dish-  not because the recipe was off. I served it with baked parmesan risotto and it was PERFECT.

I have a 14x9x3 inch casserole dish and it barely fit in there with no room to stir in the broth.
The recipe is good, but cooking everything separately takes an unnecessary amount of time - the vegetables and the potatoes could be cooked at the same time and I'm not really sure that the extra step of baking for 20 minutes is really necessary.  The same effect could be achieved by lowering the heat to low on your saute pan and covering it for 5-10 minutes.

I make this all the time. It's so easy and quick. I originally got this recipe from a 90 year old Italian grandma. The only difference is in her recipe she uses 1 can of tomato juice or V8 (my personal preference and simmered down) instead of the wine. The pieces can be cut small and used as an appetizer, served alone or over pasta or served in a toasted roll with a sprinkle of Pecorino Romano, Parmesan or  Mozzerela  cheese. It's great reheated.

Very quick and easy - I made it to recipe requirements for the first time and loved it. Leftovers are equally delicious. 

Now, I make it with a variety of sausages and I'll add in zucchini and squash, if I have it.

I substatuted worshestershire sauce and a little water  for the wine, because I was out of White Wine... haha. But it still came out fantastic!! For Stars!!!  Also I didn't actually use cloves of garlic. Or whole bell peppers. Mine came pre-chopped. And despite the changes, still fantastic!

This was really flippin' good!  Great flavor, yummy sauce, just a slam dunk.  A made a couple of very small tweaks which is why I gave it a 4 vs 5.  I used olive oil instead of butter.  Also, had 2 pans going.  One was my dutch oven where I started sauteeing the veggies, and the other was  my skillet for the sausage.  When the sausage was done, halved them and added to the dutch oven, cooked for another 1/2 hour or so.  As suggested on the recipe I mixed hot and sweet sausage in.  Other than that kept the recipe as is, served over fresh sub rolls.

I made the recipe EXACTLY as directed (I just added some yellow peppers). Absolutely decadent & delicious! My husband puts it in my top 3 best all time meals I've made for him! 
I put the sausage, peppers, garlic & onions mix on top homemade pasta/maranara! I used a cheap dry $10 "pinot grigio" white cooking wine & the meal was  still outstanding!!! (Cause we don't drink wine/ Otherwise I would've used a very nice pinot grigo to drink with our meal).
So DELICIOUS!!!!!!

PLEASE MAKE THIS DISH EXACTLY AS DIRECTED FOR THE BEST SP&O MEAL!  (Except add yellow peppers if you desire more variety & color).

This is a great recipe and I have been making this for quite awhile and the only thing I add to my recipe is a can of  crushed tomatoes  (14.5 oz.) as another reviewer has done.  To me, this is one of the top go to )recipes that everyone loves (or at least everyone who eats at my house loves) and quite easy to fix.

This was fantastic! The only thing I omitted was the wine...because I don't share my wine.  I subbed it for water. Still, it was light and just delicious! In fact, it is on the menu for tomorrow. Thank you!

Very tasty.  I recommend browning the sausage on medium-high heat.  It took too long to brown on medium heat.

Recipe is delicious as is but I like to change it a bit depending on what I have on hand. I used 1/2 cup red wine (instead of white) and added chopped fresh mushrooms and a handful of sun dried tomatoes in place of some of the peppers. Delicious!

Very quick and delicious meal. I made quite a bit of changes with the seasoning. I used Italian seasoning, black and cayenne pepper, Mortons season salt, garlic and onion powder, and paprika. I also used Vendange Chardonnay, sliced my spicy chicken sausage and cooked it over rice.

I really,really enjoyed this! I served stand alone with a side of vermicelli and marinara sauce. The only change I made was that I just added a little chicken broth, never have wine around.

The best part of this recipe is that you can customize it to your paticular tastes. I used a beef smoked sausage because Italian sausage upsets my stomach. Served it rolled up in a tortilla!  Came out awesome!

Had this tonight  with saffron rice and it was just delicious.  I did not have any white wine, so I used red instead.  Next time I will increase the veggies also.  They added a lot to the flavor.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

This is my take on this  dish.  I use mild Italian sausage and brown that first leaving  whole also I added little bit of water to steam it.  Then used red ,yellow, and orange bell peppers cut into strips and  sliced onion.  Mix together equal tablespoon of olive oil, lemon juice.  I normally start off with 2 olive oil to 1 lemon juice if need more juice add another spoon.  Then salt and pepper to taste.  Pour this over the peppers and onion mixture cover and marinate 20-30 mins.  Sautee a couple of mins. then add the sausage and cover .  Cook until the peppers are soft or till your taste.

Even non-Italians make it. I raised my boys on it and now they make it for their kids. Funny thing is I thought up this recipe on my own. I guess many minds think alike.  I use mild or hot italian sausage depending on who I'm serving, olive oil and add stewed tomatoes with no added spices, and no wine.  I serve it over mashed potatoes.

It's a keeper AND even better the next day!! Skipped the butter, I used 3 lbs of Italian Sausage so I doubled the recipe (ie onions, peppers, wine), added fennel seeds for spice.  Baked it as instructed. Transferred sausages into slow cooker, added to this 2-jars Trader Joe's roasted garlic spaghetti sauce,  crushed tomatoes & tomato paste. Continued to "caramelize" onions & peppers in oven (added olive oil) another 20 min.  Combined onions and peppers, cooked low for 1-hr. Turned off. Next day, heated and served this with linguini. Sliced mushrooms would be a nice addition with this (sauteed in butter, yum!).....Thank you for the recipe idea!

This dish was simple and exceptional. It was easy to make and  the prep time was low. I used a pinot grigio, and then finished it off with the meal.  The only deviations made from the ingredients listed is that I used Hot Italian sausages instead of the sweet Italian sausage. I'm not a big fan of the sweet sausages. And I used red and yellow bell peppers instead of red and green, simply because it's what I had in my fridge.  I served it over angel hair pasta - sprinkled with just a bit of salt and pepper. I didn't want the pasta to distract from the taste of the sausage mixture, which was exceptional.  In my opinion, it did not need anything more. The combination of the sausage mixture with the pasta was an instant hit with my family. 

For reviewers who thought it was bland, the issue may be with the type of sausage and wine they used. All sausages and wines are NOT created equal. My family did not find this dish boring or tasteless. In fact, there was enough for leftovers for lunch the next day and my husband text me, singing the praise of how good it was. I started with a great sausage, Colosimo (local to Utah), and a good wine - which added deliciously to the flavor.  This recipe is a keeper.

Fantastic recipe. Way better than I expected. It is easy to make and doesn't require too many ingredients. I would definitely recommend, though people who are picky about onions and peppers might be reluctant to eat. Otherwise, great recipe.

So good! I will definitely make this again! Took advice from reviews and added one can of diced tomatoes(not drained). I used sweet sausage, but added a dash of red pepper flakes for spice.! I also simmered it for maybe 45 minutes and added a cornstarch slurry to thicken. Served over Parmesan orzo from this site.

GREAT RECIPE!!!  I didn't have white wine so I substituted with some chicken broth and a little Apple cider.  Came out awesome.  Even my 5 year old are it.

We both thought this was a little lackluster.  It didn't taste bad, but not "oooh, this is yummy!" either.  I had no desire to have seconds or to make it again.

We both thought it needed a little kick or maybe some kind of sauce to hold it all together.

If I make it again, I'll try it with spicy sausages.  We're just not fans of The Bland.

I felt the sauce was not very flavorful.  The basil and oregano seemed heavy and didn't result in a good flavor.  Won't make again.

I'm giving this 5 stars cause I KNOW it would have been amazing as written and it was also amazing with my adjustments to our families tastes.  Great base recipe to build upon, but also perfect as is.  I used sweet italian sausage and the frozen green/red/yellow bell pepper w/onion blend.  I added a can of mushrooms and used balsamic vinaigrette in place of the white wine (don't care for wine).  I believe the balsamic gave it a similar sweetness the wine would have.  Served this over linguine and it was SCRUMPTIOUS!  Oh we SO loved this!  Yum, yum, yum!  Will absolutely be making it again!  Thank you for a lovely recipe!

Great recipe.  it's been a standard in our family for years now.  Its wonderful in fall/winter... and perfect for football parties.  Thanks so much for posting it!   We use only hot Italian sausage, as my family likes it spicy.

I have never added added tomatoes (though that sounds yummy).   Everyone LOVES this recipe as is, so I have never made any real alterations to it.  No need to mess with success!   :)

This was.easy and came out great.  my BF who is a very critical eater said "well, add this to your reportoir of things you can cook!"   The ONLY things I did different was left out the red onion because I forgot to buy it, and added a little red pepper flakes because I could only get sweet sausage and i wanted hot so I improvised...  Definitely use extra wine as your cooking to keep it moist so it doesn't burn.

I did make changes by placing the sausages, peppers and onions in the oven covered with foil for the first half hour at 400 degrees. Removed the foil and browned the sausages under the broiler for a minute or so. Nice, crisp browned sausage and tender veggies. I always place a little water along with the peppers and onions in the bottom of the baking dish, makes veggies tender.

I used red wine since that's what I had on hand. And added garlic salt and creole seasoning. My husband and kids loved it. I sauted the sliced sausage and peppers and onions all together.

Fantastic recipe! I'm sure it's wonderful as-is. However, I made the following changes, and it was the best sausage and peppers I've ever had. I grilled the sausage and the peppers. At the same time, I sautéed the onions in butter and olive oil, garlic and white wine. I added salt/pepper. Then I added the peppers to the onions, and added marinara sauce. Mixed it up over low heat, and served it in a toasted hoagie roll. I'm sure fresh herbs would be great, but it didn't even need it. SO GOOD!

Great beginning to a wholesome meal. I used olive oil , rather than butter and used a variety of fresh peppers from our garden along with a big sweet onion. After cooking the sausage and combining with the cooked peppers, I added a can of diced tomatoes,fresh sweet basil and a BIG splash of red wine and served over a small portion of angel hair pasta. Thank you for Sharing.

Excellent! In my opinion you can't go wrong when Italian sausage is in any recipe. However, I was stunned into silence as I shoveled this dish into my mouth. I followed the recipe with but used minor changes based on reading the reviews. I used red wine, a cornstarch slurry & a pinch of salt & cracked black pepper. Awesome. Thank you Gigi for sharing this too easy, too delicious recipe.

It was okay.  I used olive oil and cut up the sauasages before cooking them(I used smoked sausage). I used orange, red, and yellow peppers with sweet onion.  Next time I make it, I'll try the italian sauage but the recipe was good.

I made this with beef sausage and loved it. It took less than 30 minutes to make, including prep, and pleased even the 8 year old king of the picky eaters. I used red wine instead of white because that's what I had open. I also used fresh herbs because I happened to have them. Other than that, I made it as written and it was fantastic. This is going in the rotation.

Just okay- it is hard to get the veggies exactly right when cooking the way suggested.  I would look elsewhere for a recipe that takes that into account, but this one is adequate if you don't want to shop around.

First I want to make it known I am NOT a fan of sausage. At. All. I made it for my husband because he asked for it and wasn't planning on eating any myself. Took one taste.... 2 plates later I'm full! This is GOOD. I made it with more onions and peppers than stated here and it worked out perfectly. I will definitely be making this again... Many times!

We use balsamic vinegar (about 1/3-1/2 cup), no additional spices, and stir it half way through the cooking time.  Love it!!!

We really enjoyed this over penne pasta with Parmesan cheese. I used a nice sherry instead of white wine because I wanted to use it up, and since I had to cook the veggies longer than expected, I ended up adding a little more sherry than is called for.  Next time I'll add mushrooms.

Excellent! Used half hot, half sweet sausage, added a can of diced tomatoes, used a large red onion and left out the yellow onion. Also used red wine in place of white and served it over whole wheat penne. Delicious!

We wanted a non-tomato sauce for sausage and peppers. This is the one! The white wine along with the seasonings was so tasty.  I did use half mild and half hot sausage as one reviewer suggested. This dish is colorful, full of taste and easy to do. I browned the sausage while chopping the vegetables. We took this to a wine tasting and it disappeared.

I really like this recipie. I made a few changes. I use olive oil instead of butter. I used about 1/3 cup of wine, red pepper flakes, a pinch of salt, used multi colored peppers, and I used marinara sauce. It was delicious!!

This is one of those recipes that can be modified to your taste - I think almost everyone has their own version.  I use half sweet and half hot Italian sausage and top it off with my version of Chef John's pasta sauce.  Yummy every time!

Love this recipe. However, if you can the sausages taste even better if you grill them (rather than brown them).  Thanks for posting!

This recipe actually turned out great!  The only thing I thought it lacked was a little marinara sauce. Other than that, it was great!

this was great! I had a package of italian sausage defrosted and couldn't think of what to do with it, so glad i stumbled upon this recipe.  tossed it with some pasta with a little olive oil and the pasta water to keep it loose.  Family loved it, even my husband who doesn't like sausage, he ate around it and gobbled up the peppers that i don't care for.  My sons inhaled it and are asking me to make it again.  I did slice the sausage after browning and then finished cooking it with peppers and onions before tossing with thin spaghetti.  tomato sauce would have been good too with it too but i was too lazy to make sauce. it was very flavorful just as the recipe is written.  this will go into my weekly rotation as it was quick and very easy to make, got it on the table in 30-45 minutes top, including boiling water for the pasta.

I followed the recipe as is and enjoyed the flavour very much. I only gave it a 4 because I guess I'm not a big fan of sausage. Next time I will use steak instead of sausage. And add some fresh mushrooms. Thanks for the recipe.

I had never made sausage and peppers before and, I have to tell you, this turned out to be an excellent recipe!  Really good and easy.   Not too greasy.  I used a hodgepodge of peppers that I grew in my garden-- some spicy, some not.  It was colorful and not too spicy (I had some hot ones in there.)  Easy to make...I'll definitely reuse this recipe.  I did add more wine while it was simmering to keep it from burning.

This was delicious!  Followed other reviewers suggestions and used olive oil instead of butter and added a can of crushed tomatoes.  Allowed it to simmer on low for an hour or so after everything was cooked and tossed with penne... Loved it!  Will make again and again!

I've tried this twice exactly as followed. This time I added crushed red peppers to it so the sweet would balance out the spicy.  I added it the same time as I did The basil the oregano and the white wine. And then I added a little tiny bit of spaghetti sauce the Ragu kind and it made it a lot better to go with my angel hair noodles and since I added spaghetti sauce, just a little bit!! I've then added a tiny bit more white cooking wine. Then I made my own garlic bread using fresh hoagie bread. I split it in half put a lot of butter on it put garlic salt on top and a bunch of parmesan cheese with parsley I then baked it in the oven at 350° and then after the bottom was kind of golden brown, I then broiled the top so the top would be golden brown as well!  But I love this recipe, I just put my own twist to it with the sauce and crushed peppers. I love it soooooo much. Thank God I found this recipe because the other ones are not so yummy. sorry I also put a little bit of sugar in my pan. And salt and sugar to my angel hair while boiling then drain and sprayed with olive oil and put some butter in it. Sounds very bad for your arteries but makes for good yummy in your tummy!

This is a great recipe with some small modifications: I start off with the sauce as directed, but add whatever wine I happen to have.  When the peppers and onions are soft I add some marinara sauce, cover the pot, and turn it down to a very slow simmer.  At this point I grill the sausages.  When they are browned, I put them in with the sauce, cook for a few more minutes and voila.

I added tomatoes because I only has one type of onion. Also added oregano instead of basil. Turned out great. Made rice and Mac and cheese to go with it.

Using what was on hand, I made a few substitutions.
1) I sliced polish sausage and added after cooking the veggies.
2) Replaced wine with 1 cup beef broth thickened with 1 tsp cornstarch.
3) I served over rice.
Quick, easy and lots of flavor.

I liked it. I ate it on it's own, with the onions and peppers instead of noodles for calories sake. Did add some Mizithra Cheese to it after the fact. Delightful with that.

I loved this recipe! I used Chicken Sausage (with broccoli rabe and garlic in it) because I don't eat pork. I used red peppers because that's all I had. I used Chardonnay for my white wine...and i only added a little fresh ground black pepper and some garlic pepper salt while it all cooked together. I almost added some diced tomatoes like others had suggested...but i decided to try that next time and keep as close to the original recipe as possible. It was delicious! I loved it and will be adding this to my rotation. I told my fiance I was keeping the recipe and I received a high five! He didn't want to stop eating to say "keep it!"  haha  I served it over a chicken flavored rice pilaf. I can't wait to eat the leftovers tonight!  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

This recipe was great and made plenty. I have grown to love Italian food since moving east and this just completely hit the spot. What's even better is that I got compliments on it from just the smell. My neighbors told me that they could smell it and wanted to come over to my house for dinner. :) Soooooo good! Thank you so much for sharing the recipe!!!

I HAD a recipe for sausage and peppers.  It wasn't the best, but it was like those comfortable shoes that just don't do the job anymore but you can't get rid of them.  Well, those shoes and that recipe are gone and in its place is this culinary treasure.  I haven't had better anywhere.  The only thing I did in addition to the recipe was to throw in a token amount of marinara halfway through the final 15 minute stage, maybe a quarter to half a cup.  Other than that, I followed this recipe to a T and even did the sweet/hot sausage mix.  Excellent.  Can't wait for the next social event.  This one is going to knock their socks off.  Thank you for sharing.  This one is going into our family cookbook.

For those that find 15 minutes is too long to cook the peppers and onions, try cutting your slices a little thicker; pencil thin cuts are too small.  Or simply cook it for a shorter time.  As long as your sausages are fully cooked before you add them you are safe.

Followed the recipe and it wasn't bad, but no my favorite.  We like to put our sausage on rolls with the peppers and this really wasn't good for that would have been better on pasta maybe.

This was amazing! I did not use wine though. I used red, green, orange and yellow bell peppers along with ground cumin, salt&pepper, crushed red peppers and tomato sauce. I would suggest just using half of the yellow onion also.

Very yummy! After browning the sausage and veggies, I put everything into a Dutch Oven and simmered on the stove for most of the day.  Only thing I changed was to add salt and pepper.

Made this yesterday upon the recommendation of KZASA on this site. It was really really really good.  I used half sweet and half hot sausage, and some Pinot Grigio left from a previous celebration. I doubled all the ingredients, and it's ALL GONE!  This one is truly a keeper. Thanks to the creator and the recommender!!

My mom used to make this when I was kid, so when I ran across this recipe I just had to try it.  It was everything I expected and more.  Don't change a thing.  I served mine on "stripped" (took out some of the excess breading inside the roll to  make room for more filling) Portuguese rolls and we enjoyed every bite!

This was better than I expected.  I've made Italian sausage with grilled onions and peppers before, but the wine, garlic, oregano and basil really kicked it up a notch.  I did use olive oil instead of butter, but otherwise stayed true to the recipe.

This recipe was amazing. Just made this last night and the whole family loved it. I usually do a variation of this on the grill using tin foil.

Easy.  I browned the sausages, sliced it, then finished cooking the sausages.

I doubled the recipe and had to use Pinot Noir.  I was apprehensive on the substitution but it was delicious.  This is absolutely the best sausage and  peppers I've ever made.

I make this recipe exactly (except I use sweet and spicy sausages) and it always turns out perfect! For other recipes, I might cut everything in half since it's just me and my bf, but this recipe is just as good if not better  leftover, so sometimes I double it! You can eat this either by itself or atop some fresh Italian or Semolina bread. YUM!!

I have to say this was fantastic.  I did have to change it up since I didn't have rolls and wine.  I added 2 chopped tomatoes, and  2 cans of mushrooms.  I added 26 oz of chicken stock and salt and pepper to taste.  I then thickened it with sme cornstarch and served over rice.  It was so delicious.  I can't wait to buy some rolls and try it the way it was meant to be served.  Loved it.

I made a few changes to use what I had on hand and make it even easier for me.  I had 1 pound of spicy italian sausage I removed the casings and crumbled it up and fried it in the pan.  I did not add any butter or oil.  I added 1/2 of a red onion and 3 cloves of garlic, red and orange bell peppers and italian seasoning and cut up some tomatoes from the garden and let it cook.  Then I added the 1/4 cup of white wine and let it cook a while longer.  I thought the recipe had called for tomatos but I guess I got that from reading some of the reviews.  It was just a little watery so I mixed up a small amout of corn starch in a little water then put it in to thicken it up.  I served it over wheat elbow macaroni and sprinkled parmesan on top.  Everyone loved it :)

This was a good recipe but I think the final results would be determined by the sausage you use.  I'm thinking the sausage I used wasn't good enough because it was the store brand.  Ill be making this again with specialty sausage next time.

Fantastic. I've never made sausage and peppers before and have only seen them around cooked in a tomato sauce. I was a little leery but made the recipe as directed and we loved it, as much if not more than the sauced version. We made sure to use a wine we like to drink and the cooking liquid was divine, I may have sipped some off the plate when I was done. This will be a repeat recipe for us, thanks so much for sharing!

I make this dish all the time with a few changes recommended by others. I use olive oil and no butter and I use red wine instead of white.  I serve with either tubular pasta or with italian bread. Yummy.

This recipe is well loved among my friends and family. It's an absolute hit and everyone requests it for gatherings. Even my Aunt who grew up by a Jersey Shore Boardwalk - which we all know is notorious for their sausage & peppers - says this is the best she's ever had. The only difference I do is use both sweet and hot Italian sausage and substitute beer for the wine. Otherwise I follow everything else to the "T". Mmmm - this recipe will not let you down.

Best sausage & peppers ever! Thanks for sharing this recipe. I made it as a side dish and since there were only 2 adults eating this, I took 3 sausage links out of the casing instead of using 6 links and used sweet turkey sausage instead. I also omitted the red onion and substituted the white wine with chicken broth.  The butter and chix broth really brought out the sweetness in the peppers.

Definitely a keeper!  My husband and three kids loved it!!!  I added a can of crushed tomatoes to the cooked onions and peppers, added a little sugar and  simmered it for a bit before I added the sausage back in.  Also, I didn't have white wine, so I added apple juice.  Delicious!

Absolutely delicious! I used a fresh, pork farmer's sausage that I HAD to buy after sampling at the farmer's market. Also, I didn't have white wine on hand so I subbed in chicken stock. Even my picky 3 yr old loved it... After she picked off the peppers and onions ;)

This was great, but I had to make a few adjustments because of my ingredients. I had 5 2oz. sweet italian chicken sausages and followed the recipe for 4 servings (although I used 1/2 red onion instead of the recommended 1). I also used frozen peppers, which made everything a bit soggy. So I had to drain the pan, add an extra half tablespoon butter and a splash of wine. Delish on Italian rolls.

Great flavor!  I didn't have all the ingredients but used most.  I only had yellow onions and jarred roasted red peppers which I added late since they're already tender.  No dried basil either and this was still fantastic!

I found I needed more wine than called for.  Overall a good basic dish.  I did not at tomatoes or sauce as other suggested as I was looking for something without a tomato base.   I did add about 1/4tsp. of dried chili peppers. Next time I would add more as I like some kick.  Used fresh basil as I had some in the garden and I cut up the sausages and served all over mashed potatoes

I made this last night and combined it with Nanny's Spaghetti Sauce submitted by MELHARVEY.  I used a combination of sweet and hot Italian sausage.   It was delicious and very easy. Everyone loved it including the grandkids.

This was really good.  It is the simplest of recipes and can be altered as desired (more onion/pepper, whatever you like).  I don't think I had white wine and used either red wine or chicken broth - it came out great either way!

I doubled the recipe and used 6 sweet and 6 hot italian sausages. Used one extra large sweet onion in place of the yellow and red and added a little hot sauce. This was fantastic! A huge hit on it's own or served with crusty italian bread!

I made this as a vegetarian dish using soy protein "italian style" sausage links, & I was a bit nervous how it would translate. But, it turned out great!! My non-vegetarian boyfriend enjoyed it as well. I'd never had sausage before but wanted to try it after I saw the veggie links at the store & this recipe has by far the best ratings I've seen! I did add fresh diced tomatoes, red wine instead of white, & EVOO instead of butter. Thank you! Very Delicious (even as a veggie dish)!

Really excellent. Once browned I cut the sausage into 2inch long pieces and when it was all finished served the whole thing on buttered & toasted hoagie rolls so we could eat as sandwiches.  The cooking juices made the bread delicious.

This was a great sausage peppers and onion recipe. I took the casing off the sausage the recipe didn't say to but I think you are supposed to. Next time I will use maybe one more green pepper, I used a yellow pepper because that's what I had on hand. I used chicken broth instead of white wine only because I don't drink wine and didn't want to buy some just for this recipe. I did simmer longer than 15 minutes for the sausage to be all the way done it was more like 30 minutes. Served over pasta hot hot hot also from this recipe.. very good dinner. Thank you

A great standard dish my boyfriend's family makes all the time! Except instead of butter they use oil. No herbs and no wine. It's very simple...bbq italian sausage, add sliced onion, peppers and crushed tomatoes. Bake for about an hour. It's great by itself or on a hot french roll!

I am a terrible cook (much better baker) and suddenly found myself with impromptu company. This recipe turned out great! Instead of sweet sausage I used hot and spicy sausage and red wine. I couldn't be happier - my guests cleared their plates!

This was a great recipe. I served it with bowtie pasta and garlic bread. I added a can of crushed tomatoes and also I sprinkled a couple of pinches of sugar in right after I added the tomatoes. It really cuts the slight bitterness tomatoes have. It was delish!!!

Simple and tasty. The sausage took a bit longer to cook than the recipe implies. Served with brown rice. I'll add a few more peppers/onions next time though.

Absolutely one of my favorite dishes.  I omitted the green bell pepper (didn't have one) and went with yellow, orange, and red bells instead.  Also just used red onion and added two roughly chopped Roma tomatoes.  Didn't add oregano or basil or any other seasonings.  I added about 1/2 cup of good red wine and let it all reduce after everything was added. "Italian Bread Using a Bread Machine" from this site accompanied the meal well  - this bread works perfectly to catch all the yummy juices.

We've been trying to find something different to do with Italian turkey sausage besides add it to spaghetti.  This was an EXCELLENT alternative.  My boyfriend loves it.

Great recipe! I did not use the herbs because I did not have any fresh ones and was not sure how old my dried ones were. I believe the flavors from the sausage added to the mix perfectly. My little guy is a picky meat eater but loved the sausage. I am defiantly putting this into the rotation! Thanks for sharing!

I usually make sausage and peppers with a tomato sauce, which I enjoy over pasta.  This was a really nice change - especially if you like to eat it on italian rolls.  We enjoyed it a lot.  I think I did 4x the recipe though so I could freeze it for later.  If you are going through the trouble of making it, why not make more?

This was really good and easy.  I browned my sausage and veggies then threw everything into the crockpot along with a can of tomatoes and left over spaghetti sauce.  Everything else remained the same.  I served this in bowls with fresh baguettes I made that day.

This is a pretty good recipe, both in terms of simplicity and taste. We had it with a Riesling, which worked well. We also tried it with spicy Italian sausage and a (red) Zinfandel, which was also good. Personally, I would like it better if it were a little spicier.

Great recipe!  I used turkey sausage, all colors of peppers, two different kinds of onions, and lots of red peppers flakes.  We could not stop eating this.  I guess I will have no leftovers for tomorrow.  I guess I will just have to make it again!  Thanks!

Good recipe.  Very simple, but flavorful.  I served this with eggplant parmesan and uctually used red wine instead of white because of that.  Will definitely make again.

We loved this!  I added cabbage, sliced apples, walnuts and a bit of brown sugar.  I also used chicken sausage.  We served it over fettuccine.  Very good, simple recipe.

I thought this recipe was OK, but my husband loved it and said it needs to get into the rotation of recipes we use!! So I guess I'll be making it again sometime, but I'm going to try and make it less greasy.

This is a very good & easy recipe. You can change it to your tastes by adding or subtracting ingredients, very versatile. I added a can of chopped tomatoes this time & it made a good recipe even better. I may experiment even more next time. Thanks for the great recipe!

I followed the recipes but found the taste to be sort of bland. I did use mild sausage because of my little ones. Not sure if the hot sausage would have made a huge difference.

I have made these several times and they are delicious. A friend dropped by one night after dinner and stood over the plate and kept picking and picking until she ate at least a whole sausage and several pieces of peppers. 
I decided that I personally prefer a combo of butter and EVOO to saute' and Thyme instead of Oregano.

This was awesome!  Got rave reviews at a recent bbq.  This was the first time I ever made sausage and peppers and I was a bit nervous trying out a new recipe but the risk paid off big.  It came out just perfect.  I used 1/2 sweet and 1/2 spicy sausage because we like the heat.  Thank you for the recipe!

I'm pretty new to cooking and this was excellent. Used light lager beer instead of wine and olive oil instead of butter like others suggested. I like grilling so I grilled the sausage first and later returned it to the pan to simmer with the peppers and onions. Will definitely be making this again!

Yum! Very good. Sliced sausage before browning & used olive oil instead of butter. Can serve so many different ways- on a roll, over pasta, with potatoes or rice, the possibilities are endless. Thanks.

This recipe was fantastic!  I used chicken basil sausage (from Sprout's) and substituted olive oil for half the butter, but everything else was the same.  My husband and I both loved it.  It was very easy and I'll definitely be making this again.

This wasn't as tasty as I hoped it would be (perhaps I should have used spicy sausage).  I sprinkled some balsamic vinegar on while eating, and that gave it a bit more flavor.

I skipped green pepper but used red and yellow instead.  I followed other suggestions and used beer in place of wine.  I like extra sauce to dip my bread in so I used more beer (wine) than listed in the recipe.  It was so easy and very tasty.

Very tasty. I'm on a low carb diet and this hit the spot! Be careful not to overcook the peppers, ours were a little mushy. Beer instead of wine works well, but don't add any more than the recipe calls for, dish will be runny.

Oh My Flippin' Heck! This is super good! I added some canned tomatoes, some red pepper flakes - mixed in some penne pasta.  Yowsers!  This is one of those meals that you eat more than you should, once you're full, just because it's so darn yummy!

Easy, versatile and yummy - what more can you ask for in a recipe.  I served this at Christmas and it was so wonderful.  I actually chopped everything up the night before and just threw I all together on christmas day - kept in a warm oven it is a great dish for large groups.  Next time I will serve over some bow tie pasta.

I have made this recipe many times now and it always turns out great.  Since everyone in my family is a garlic lover, I always add a little more.  I also usually use 1/2 spicy sausage and half mild to add an extra zip.  Great recipe!

I used olive oil instead of the butter.  I also used half hot and half sweet sausage.  Even though I like garlic, my Italian wife does not like it, so I kept it out.  It was very good and flavorful.
Thanks

Substituted 1/2 of the butter for some olive oil, and served over white jasmine rice.  It was satisfying, delicious and easy.

I've tried this recipe a few times and really like it, especially on rolls. We like it with spicy turkey sausage, but I'm sure it would be equally tasty with the sweet variety. The one time I used non-turkey sausage it ended up being kind of "gristly," but that could be because the store brand sausage I bought wasn't of the greatest quality. So, I think good sausage is key.

Totally awesome. The only change I made was to lightly coat the pasta with marinara before putting the sausage, peppers, and onions on top. This would be a great sandwich as well.

This was excellent! I used everything listed but I added roasted garlic and  onion flavored diced tomatoes and served as a sandwich on a toasted bun with mozzarella cheese and for hubby pepper jack cheese. Served with roasted potatoes. YUMMY. This is a keeper.

Good flavor but it turned out pretty greasy.  Maybe it was the sausage I used?!?!  I will make again but use less butter (more wine?).  Thanks for the recipe....

This was a very good dish and I will try it again.  Have though about using hot Italian sausage and a good quality beer for the liquid...just for a different taste.

My husband could not get enough of this. Even my kids enjoyed it.  It is perfect with a side of pasta!

This recipe was not bad, except my husband is not a big fan of sausages.  It would probably be good to feed other people, though :)

We really enjoyed this. Flavors were great. Next time I'll add more onions and perhaps substitute oil for butter.

Personally I'm not crazy for italian sausage, but this was a good change from cooking them on the grill for sausage dogs.

This was delicious, just what I was craving.  I used olive oil instead of butter, and next time I'd add more onion, just because I like a lot of vegetables.  But it was very good.

Nice, simple recipe. I liked it, but my husband found it bland (even though I used hot Italian sausage). I would make it again, with some spice added.

I made this for dinner last night.  Prepared it as a sandwich on a hoagie roll and then broiled with provolone cheese, as suggested by others.  Delicious.  Used some of the leftovers in an omelette this morning.  Double Delicious!  We'll be having this again and again.

I made this dish with all hot sausage and sherry and served it over angel hair pasta.  This was honestly the first time in four years that I made a dish both my Italian loving boyfriend and fried food loving me actually enjoyed!  This dish was great!!

Superb!  I had always only had the sausage in whole links - the slices were so delicious and soaked up all the ingredients so well.  Thanks for the recipe!

A little bland, just needed something more. Maybe half sweet half spicy sausage would have done it.

Excellent recipe. I made this for mother's day, and it was a real success. I added mushrooms, which fit nicely with the rest of it.

The only thing that kept this recipe from being five-star is that it didn't mention salt & pepper, which are essential. I added sliced mushrooms and because of their moisture was able to omit the wine. It's a keeper.
