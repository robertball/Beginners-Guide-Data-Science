I submitted this recipe and think the cornbread is very important. If I use Jiffy, I make 2 packages of it. If I make my cornbread from scratch, I mix together 2 c. self-rising cornmeal, 1/4 cup oil, 1 1/4 cups milk, and 1 egg. I then bake the cornbread in a black skillet at 450 degrees until it is browned. Also, when I put this recipe together, I just stir everything together rather than layer it.

Very  good!  Next time, I will reduce the onion to a cup.  For more of a main dish, double the chicken.  Would also be delicious with turkey.  Looking forward to making it again.

Didn't like this, we would not like this even as a side dish. Granddaughter who eats everything didn't even like this and it should have been perfect for her.  Used the Jiffy corn bread mix as suggested for he corn bread as well.  NOT for us.

Made this recipe for our family reunion and it turned out great and everyone really liked it!!! I will make this again. I followed the recipe all but the extra water, I used the two cans of soup and one can of broth and it turned out great, my crock pot was on high instead of low
 for four hours but I don't think my crock pot  cooks as hot as some do.

Flavor is great.  This was more of a side dish even though I had typed in main dish on search.  I think it can easily be transformed by changing the ratios a little.  Next time I will cut cornbread down by a third.  I will also add more vegtables.  I added small abount of carrots, mushrooms and zuchinni. Next time I will increase each to at least a cup.  I used Sweet Cornbread Cake from this site.  Instead of canned soup, I used cream soup base from this site.

Very good and enjoyable.  It seems quite salty though with both cans of soup and added salt.  It also seemed a bit too watery.  We will do it again with only one soup and no added salt.  It also has tons of butter in it.  We'll try to cut it in half.  With the butter in our cornmeal recipe and the amount stated above there was 1 and 1/2 sticks of butter in the recipe....

I’ve made this more times than I can count. It’s delicious and is loved by family and guests. I use (2) Jiffy cornbread mixes & a rotisserie chicken. I don’t layer it, but rather combine all ingredients and spread evenly in my 6 quart oval slow cooker. My Southern roots demand a lot from a cornbread dressing and this recipe doesn’t disappoint.

Good flavor, strange consistency, poor appearance and a lot of work for how it came out. I used chopped carrots instead of celery, decreased the butter a bit and let the chicken cook over the five hours in the crockpot. I also used Famous Dave corn muffins which may have been too sweet. I don't think I'll make it again. It was nice to try something different though.
