Delightful salad with a nice lemon flavor that is not too overpowering.  I made the recipe as written, but the next time I make it I would use only 1/2 cup salad dressing.  I also used thinly sliced water chestnuts because I didn't have almonds.  Otherwise, I thought it was a very nice, summery recipe.  I used a rotisserie chicken, and frozen snow peas, served it on a fresh tomato for my husband and he loved it.  I ate mine on toasted 9 grain bread.  Great flavor.

We really liked this.  I did use half the salad dressing and used lite sour cream, so I am hoping it didn't have 33g of fat.  It was great on a really hot summer day.  I served it on garden greens with a little oil and vinegar dressing.

Very nice recipe - I made it as directed and would also reduce the Miracle Whip by 1/2, but otherwise really great!

This was very good and easy too. I used canned chicken but have also used a pre-cooked rotisserie chicken from the supermarket too.  Both work. Instead of Miracle Whip (which I hate) I used 1/2 low-calorie mayonnaise and 1/2 low-fat sour cream and upped the lemon, and it turned out delish!!  Serving it on a tomato, as suggested by another reviewer, was a great idea and I've done that every time I make this.  Good stuff.

Very good ... halved the recipe based on how much leftover grilled chicken breast i had on hand; substituted Vidalia onion for the red onion, mayo for the Miracle Whip, fresh parsley instead of dried, tarragon rather than basil (realised at the last minute i had no basil on hand!), & 1 single serving bag of Bird's Eye Steam Fresh peas instead of fresh snow peas (just poured frozen peas into salad) ... husband says to make it again :)

I halfed the amount of Miracle Whip and I thought the onions were overwhelming so I really didn't like it but the next day it tasted much better after sitting in the fridge for a day the strong onion taste was gone and the snow peas and almonds give it a crunchy fresh texture.

This is pretty good, and I have to say that putting shredded lettuce into the chicken salad mix is something new to me!I used 3 very large chicken breasts and diced half of a green pepper in place of the onion since my family does not care for onions. I will make again, only I will increase the amount of lemon pepper because it was not quite strong enough for us. But overall it was a nice change of pace on this hot day....but....if you want a chicken salad recipe that will totally knock your socks off try Fruity Curry Chicken Salad from this website!

Really fresh tasting for a spring lunch.  I did make a few changes, though.  It sounded like a lot of onion and my young son doesn't like it raw, so I omitted it.  I used regular frozen green peas instead of snow peas.  I also left out the lettuce and just served it with lettuce leaves on sandwiches.

Very good.  I took it to a ladies luncheon and several ask for the recipe. I will make it again.

This was really good! I used romaine lettuce and water chestnuts insead of almonds to keep it lower calorie and lower fat. Since I used big pieces of romaine instead of shredded lettuce one cup of miracle whip was what I needed, in this case 1/2 a cup wouldn't have been enough. I did marinate my frozen chicken breasts in lemmon pepper marinade all night and I used more lemmon pepper than the recipe called for. But it made for a very yummy sandwich!

Excellent - best I've ever tasted, not too lemony and almonds really topped it off.  Used frozen peas in lieu of snow peas, Mayo instead of Miracle whip, fresh basil instead of dried. WOW

Onions were too strong.  Also the snap peas gave it an odd texture.  This one needs too much tweaking to mess with.

This is listed as a gluten free main course, and I would just like to say that Miracle Whip is not gluten free. Sub regular mayo if you would like this to be gluten free. *CORRECTION!* The last time I bought Miracle Whip, all the ingredients listed were gluten free! I think they changed their recipe!

I marinated, then poached my chicken breast in Italian dressing.  That really gave it some flavor!  This is a very good, quick recipe.  Thanks for sharing Sara.

I was dying for lemon chicken salad and this hit the spot!  I might cut back on the lemon a bit next time, as I prefer a more subtle lemon flavor.

I'll admit, I am new to making chicken salad....but I liked all of the ingredients and thought I would give it try. I was completely overwhelmed by the amount of onions in the dish. I think half of the amount indicated at the most. Just a thought.

Missing salt. Herbs are a little over-powering. Just average chicken salad.

I didn't have lemon pepper (I used black pepper), snow peas, almonds or lettuce. I shredded the chicken. It was delicious! I think the almonds and lemon pepper would have been great..not sure about the other two ingredients...but it was  unique and quite tasty the way I made it!
