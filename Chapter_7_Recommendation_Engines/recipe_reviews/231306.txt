I would not steam the veggies and wontons separately.  Poach them in the broth and the broth will have a more complex flavor.  Overall - this is a nice fresh meal.

I have made wonton soup many times but this will be my go to recipe from now on!  Fantastic with all the veggies in it!  I swapped ground chicken for pork (my daughter doesn't eat pork) and added a dash of sesame oil to the broth.  The key, IMHO, is leaving the meat to sit in the fridge and let the flavours marry.  The filling was super tasty.  I also cooked the veggies in the broth and only until they were warmed through.  We like them crunchy!  We all loved this!  Thanks!

No subsitutions. This is an amazing recipe. I was intimidated at first as someone who hasn't cooked Asian food very often, but this turned out fantastic! The dumplings had a savory, complex flavor, and I don't think I'll need to order this at a restaurant ever again!

This is the first time I've made wonton soup and I'm happy to say this recipe was great! The wontons tasted just like they came from any good restaurant.

This was great.  I would take Baking Nana's tip to not steam anything, just poach it in the pot for best flavor.

I made this soup today and it turned out fantastic, my picky 3 year old ate it up so quickly. I used chicken and beef broth mixed and added a tsp of sesame oil in the broth. Yum!

Made it, love it, will make it many times more. Don't cheat on the steaming because that's what makes it so good. Keeps the flavours in the veggies! So tasty and freezes well (without the chicken broth) in bowl size portions.  Just microwave, fresh chicken broth over it and your good to go??

Wontons were delicious! I didn't cook them separately though. I cooked the wontons in the stock, to which I added star anise and a bit of soy sauce. Then a few minutes before they were ready, I added the veggies. Fabulous!

What better thing to do than cook with your kids - and this recipe was perfect from start to finish. We prepared and tasted and the only thing we changed was added another Tbsp. of Soy Sauce as the Sesame Oil was overpowering. With 9,9,11, and 13 year old girls it was a fantastic Cultural adventure. I must say the only thing I was apprehensive about ... was the low amount of reviews. It'll be my best secret!!

I loved the wontons. They had great flavor. However, next time Iâ€™ll probably opt for a different broth.

Very good, but a couple comments  I do recommend following directions and steam vegetables separately but for absolute minimum time to keep crisp. And I must assume recipe meant 3 heads of BABY bok choy which is what I used. 3 heads of regular bok choy is a lot.  My personal flavor preference I added a teaspoon each of fish sauce and sesame oil to the broth.

Love this recipe! I must be a lazy cook because I just add everything together and simmer until done. I freeze the won tons and it takes about 10 min. to thaw out in the hot broth, then I cook for an extra 10 min. just to make sure the meat is fully cooked. Oh yes, and I usually just buy the frozen vegetables like cauliflower/broccoli mix, etc. to add to the chicken broth. Wonderful recipe!

I swapped out the sugar snap peas for Chinese broccoli and added cut up thinly sliced boneless chicken breasts (lightly salted). I also dropped the wontons and vegetables directly into the broth instead of steaming them. My kids, even my picky son, loved this recipe. He even went back for seconds!

I made this with leftover wontons from an Easter appetizer, used shopped shrimp in place of the pork and otherwise followed the recipe.  I thought this was bland but our two teenagers and my husband loved it!  I did like the addition of all the veggies in the broth and cooked my wontons in the broth rather than steaming.
