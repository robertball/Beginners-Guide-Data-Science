I am rating this recipe based on the technique only.  Butterflying a whole chicken is the key to an evenly roasted bird.  I butterflied according to these directions, and it came out perfect.  I grilled the chicken skin side up, on indirect heat for an hour at 300 degrees.  I am watching calories so I slipped some sliced garlic under the skin, sprinkled with some lemon pepper and lime juice and threw it on the hot grill.  Don't be intimidated by the butterflying technique.  It will change the way you grill chicken!!

Fantastic recipe! I was a little worried but this chicken came off the grill cooked perfectly. Removing the backbone was a bit of work for me as I had never done it before but the end result was well worth the extra effort. The meat had GREAT flavor was super moist and the skin was really crispy and delicious. Thank you I'll use this method again.:)

I'll give the concept 5 starts - butterflying the chicken for grilling is easy and surpurb!  The concept of adding herbs etc under the skin is excellent.  I liked the taste of the onions, garlic and herbs - but i'm still debating the sour cream.  don't get me wrong, i LOVE sour cream, but this way i'm just not sure....i may try some other spread i "invent" and cook with this method.  The flavor was excellent....just wasn't wild about the way the sour cream "clumped" under the skin.

Only okay. I was not impressed with the sour cream mixture...it was just too bland. The directions for removing the back bone were great and easy as I had not done this before. Would cook this way again but only with a different seasoning mixture.

5 stars for the concept. We don't like the dill weed and sour cream... so we spice it differently. And it takes about an hour and a half to do a 5 lb chicken. Then we have leftovers. Yum!

This is my new favorite way to grill chicken! I did not use the marinade -- I did not have the ingredients on hand. I cut the bird per the directions and then rubbed lemon pepper between the skin and the flesh. I was positive it would not cook properly -- but it was AMAZING! When I served it to my husband he asked "When did we get a rotisserie?" The methodology behind the cooking is what makes this bird awesome!

What a wonderful way to grill chicken! I couldn't believe that I've been cooking all of these years and never figured this out before. Butterflying the chicken is a brilliant idea. Chicken gets cooked through evenly without charring the meat. I've used this several times already with different marinades and barbeque sauces including this one. Thanks for posting!

I've done this a few times now and I've always been happy with the results. I've altered the recipe a few times like using straight Old Bay but the cooking always comes out perfect. Don't worry about getting the backbone out completely...the goal is to get the chicken flat.

The butterfly technique worked well the chicken was very tender but I felt it lacked flavor. Next time I would add a bit of lemon or lime or garlic something with a kick.

Like a few of the other comments the butterfly technique worked great! I did the majority of it in the oven and transferred it out to the grill to finish and used my own bbq sauce so I have not tried that part of the recipe. I have never butterflied a chicken before but with these directions it worked well. Thanks!!!

WOW amazing & moist! Was a bit nervous about butterflying the chicken but "YouTubed" a video and it was so easy. Did my own rub on an 8 lb chicken and grilled for 2 hours at about 350 degrees. Outstanding!! Served with garlic mashed potatoes corn and rolls. So Easy!!

AMAZING! I give this a perfect 5 star rating for the method alone! Never will I agonize over the timing of separate chicken pieces. This really is so easy and the bird cooks evenly and delicious. My 3lb bird was juicy and delish in about an hour. Tastes like rotisserie! I did add lemon zest and lemon juice and additional spices to the mixture but this method will lend itself to any seasoning! Thanks so very much for the recipe!

Note: it takes @1 hour 30 minutes to grill a 5 lb chicken using indirect heat @ 300 F temp. of the grill. ALWAYS BRINE the chicken overnight with your favorite brine recipe! DO NOT USE DILL... Instead I used fresh thyme & fresh Rosemary chopped fine 6 garlic cloves minced salt & pepper smoked paprika mixed with the sour cream. I bought my chicken precut in half back bone removed breast meat still together not sliced through.

I tried this as posted! My grill is a vertical Beer Keg smoker with a water pot over the heat scource. I laid the chicken down on the grill on each side for 6 minutes which sealed in the juices. Then I filled the water pot with apple juice and let the chicken cook for 2 hours untouched. WOW!!! Thanks for posting!

My wife and I had this last night and we both thought is was wonderful. My wife suggested more dill but that is her preference. Only problem I had was that I forgot to get garlic but substituted with a teaspoon of garlic powder. It still was great. This one is a keeper.

Perfect in every way. Never eaten a better chicken dish. I used 2 chicken quarters instead of a whole chicken. It's a little less trouble and we prefer dark meat.

I have been grilling chicken this way for several years. Based on the technique I definitely give it a Five. I usually put fresh rosemary and minced garlic under the skin prior to grilling also lightly brushing the bird with olive oil before grilling. I do flip it skin side down about 5 minutes to finish to crisp the skin a bit. The chicken cooks much more evenly and in about half the time. Great technique!

Perfect with no changes! On a gas grill try to keep the temp to about 350 F. We grilled a 5-pound chicken and it needed only 40 minutes. Let rest a few minutes after cooking.

The chicken was really moist! I used tofutti "sour cream" instead of regular and shallots instead of red onions but otherwise stuck to the recipe pretty closely. Next time I'll add more salt to the sour cream mixture great recipe!

Placing the herb paste under the skin was easy enough for the breasts and thighs but needed to make small incisions in the leg and wing skin to get the paste under the skin. Marinated for 6 hours. Great taste and the breasts and thighs were very juicy and flavorful. I'd definitely make this again.

I'm rating it primarily on the method. I don't like sour cream and my husband is not a fan of highly seasoned food so I changed it up a bit. After butterflying the chicken I let it soak in a brine solution (recipe found here) for 4-5 hours before grilling. Then I brushed olive oil over the skin and seasoned with kosher salt and fresh ground pepper. I use a grill tray covered with foil and it takes about and hour for a 3-4 pound bird. Keep an eye on the grill temp between 400-450 is perfect. This is the only way I will make a whole chicken from now on.

This recipe is amazingly delicious! It's become my family's most requested and I make it at least once a week maybe more. I vary the spices to change it up a little and often substitute the sour cream for butter. I add powdered garlic and onion instead of fresh for convenience. We can't believe how moist and tender the chicken is. I've cooked it on the grill and in the oven depending on the weather. It's a sure winner.

butterflying the chicken was easy and I would certainly do that again - but that sour cream in there was just gross. I will work on this recipe to make it to my liking.

Delicious. By the way the technique of removing the backbone from fowl and splaying it or "butterflying" it is simply referred to as "spatchcocking." Try it with your next Thanksgiving turkey. You'll never go back:) Good eats to all. Fred

Added jalapeno jelly to the Lite sour cream. Otherwise too bland. The butterflying technique took about five minutes. I will always do this in the future!

OMG. The best ever. Not only is this a good way to cut up a chicken for the grill but an awesome seasoning. I out Portuguese chicken spice in the outside. Raised up my grill rack so it would cook slow. Checked to make sure it was 180 and it was incredible when we broke into it. Happy 4th of July indeed.

I had leg quarters x 4 so I didn't have to butterfly the chicken I did cut away the backbone and did not separate I baked the chicken in a electric smoker then placed it under the broiler to crisp up the skin it was moist and very tasty. Served with smashed red little potato and fresh whole green beans tossed with olive oil and Parmesan cheese will Make it again
