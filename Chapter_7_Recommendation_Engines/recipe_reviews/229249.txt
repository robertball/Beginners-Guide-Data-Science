Gotta tell you, my husband made this recipe on the weekend when his son and girlfriend came over - it was DELICIOUS !!!  We just had it again tonight and I had to rate this now while I still have the flavours running rhrough my mouth ...  The only change we  made was using Diced flavoured tomatoes (Aylmer Accents roasted red pepper)  other than that - he stuck to the recipe.  We had it over a small amount of brown rice. It didn't make 15 servings for us, more like 12 but for the calorie content that's still good.

Great one-pot meal, especially for a big family.  Other than using only one pound of ground turkey, I made this recipe as written.  It is very tasty, as well as healthy.  While it would be easy to add different ingredients for variations, this is a simple go-to meal as is.

Love the sweet hot flavor and all the various beans! I didn't have molasses, so I used honey and brown sugar. I also added garlic since I use that in everything. :) very tasty!

I made it yesterday and served over whole wheat medium shells. Didnt add molasses and i used some lima beans too. My family loved it and so did i since it was my first time making chili. They couldnt even tell if it was turkey or beef. Yumm!!
