Excellent soup!
I roasted the squash, added apple cider and pumpkin, plenty of carrots and heavy cream. It was incredible!  Sent some to my brother in law who was ill. My family went crazy for this. For days they text me on how much they loved it. It is addictive you can't stop eating it. By far, this is one of my favorite dishes from this site.

Easy and delicious.  Since I am vegetarian, I substituted veggie broth for the chicken broth.  The soup was a real hit on a cold winter day.

I'm at least an 80/20 Paleo eater and this was a super treat even in the summer.  I followed the recipe closely and it was easy to make and delicious to eat. Of course, no sour cream for me, but I can't say I missed it.

Tasty, thick soup.  More like a bisque.  Next time I will try the optional white wine.  Maybe sherry?  It was just fine without it.  Could save time by buying pre-chopped veggies.

I added some peppers, zuchini, and summer squash with the onions. It was delicious!
