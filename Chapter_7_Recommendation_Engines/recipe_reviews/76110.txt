I wrote this recipe. I don't know why, but the editors changed some things in it that would make it not turn out as good. I don't cook the chicken ahead, I add it raw. Since it is in bite size pieces, it is cooked perfectly when the garlic and onions are done. I put in the juice from the tomatoes and you have more liquid for your rice. (If you have homegrown tomatoes, you can use those too)I don't oil the casserole dish, I just drizzle the top with olive oil. You cook it for about 30 minutes, then you add the cheese on top and cook an additional 10 minutes to melt the cheese. If you have a clay dish, that is what they use to cook it in, in Turkey. Hope you like it, we love it!

I was stationed in Turkey (Incirlik AB, near Adana) for 2 and half years and ate Tava all the time.  This recipe is really close to the real thing.  The only thing I plan on changing next time I make it is use twice as much garlic and half as much onions (red onions is what they used in Adana).

I'm glad I read Carrie's review before following what the editors did to her recipe. I couldn't understand why you would need to cook the chicken cubes in a skillet and then bake them for another half-hour. That's just crazy.

There was a Turkish Resturant on LSA Diamondback in Iraq.  Everytime we would return from a bad mission the turks(great guys) would give us good tea and make Tava for us.  Excellent recipe and thank you for adding it to the list!!! I have good memories of that place, those guys and that dish!!

try to add all fresh vegetables it tastes much better and i know most of you dont have Salca ( pepper paste) use roasted red pepper.

i find that canned diced tomatoes doesn't exacly give you the real turkish taste.
anyways this is my 2 cents.

This was quite tasty & easy to make. I used a 9 X 13 baking dish. It might have been a bit big, but did the job. Next time I'm going to season the chicken with a little paprkia & cook the onion & garlic a bit to mellow the raw flavor. My wife said it was one of the more memorable dishes from this website that we've made lately.

I made this last night with the recommendations of the author (uncooked chicken, didn't drain the canned tomatoes), and it was WONDERFUL!  I will definitely make this again. I didn't have as much mozzarella on hand as the recipe called for and it was still plenty (could use 8 oz easily). The chicken was perfectly cooked and moist and the sauce was divine. Had last-minute dinner guest and he loved it as well. A+++ Thanks for this great recipe that will go into my top shelf rotation

I had wondered what was missing from my tava recipe, and the red pepper paste was it. Thanks, Carrie, for the wonderful recipe. It tastes exactly like I remember it from Incirlik.

Oh so good! Awesome! I followed Carries recipe instead of the edited one. It was fantastic! Dont forget the salt though, because I tried to leave it out and it was too bland. Next time I might add a little bit of italian sausage! YUM!!!

This is absolutely delicious and one of my favorite recipes. I've made it several times now. It's perfect the way it is, but in the future I might experiment with Feta cheese or Turkish beyaz peynir (white cheese) and maybe Kalamata olives.

Tasted fantastic. I also love that the ingredients were staples tht I'll always have, so that I can always make it! Didnt add as much cheese as the recipe called for, and I dont know how much that affects the taste.

We add peeled shrimp and peppers and make it in individual clay dishes like we received when we ordered the Tava in Turkey. This makes it easy to customize the dish to each persons palette.

This is very easy, healthy, and reheats well. I cooked the chicken in olive oil and red pepper paste. It gives it a little more flavor. I also added some crushed red peppers or the Turkish version (not sure of the name). I've eaten it as a soup, over rice, and even over noodles. Very versatile dish! Thanks for posting this recipe.

This is a perfect replica of what is served in Turkey outside of the base!!!  I do add more garlic and I use chunks of it instead of minced.

This was an excellent recipe!  I used all fresh veggies for the recipe and it came out beautifully!  The flavor was terrific. Also, I served it over brown rice, and the nuttier flavor of the brown rice complimented the dish perfectly!

I love this recipe!  I was stationed at Incirlick in the late 90's and we at this dish every chance we had.  The only difference I do is cook everything up in a fry pan, then put it in the traditional dishes and cook it in the oven just long enough to have the cheese melt.  My friends who have never been to Turkey really love it....

I was reading too fast and I missed the part about pureeing some of the ingredients. But it was still good. I ended up with a sick baby so I had to make it in the slow cooker and add in the cheese at the end. But it was delicious. I didn’t mean to rough up the original recipe so bad. Will try again the original way from author of this recipe.

Esta fue una receta excepcional. Gracias. He tenido este plato en Adana, Inskedrun y Estambul. Esto está muy cerca de lo que he tenido allí. Lo serví con arroz. A mi hijo y a su prometido (que es de Turquía) también les encantó.

This is a great recipe and easy to modify slightly. I used two cloves of garlic and sautéed them with the onion to get rid of a raw taste. Added the chicken for just a bit to give it a nice sear on the outside. Then threw in some smoked paprika for a little zing. Served with a nice long grain rice. Hubby gave it a thumbs up so we will definitely be doing this one again!

Excellent recipe, super close to the original! I used fresh veggies, sauteed them before adding to casserole,  with chicken I followed author's recommendations...and I added cumin powder and smoked paprika powder, my Turkish    friend says it is a must. Thank you for sharing Carrie!

My husband spent 24 months in Turkey.  This was his favorite dish while he was there.  He said that this was the closest recipe that sounded right.  The whole family loves it (and it is hard to get picky teenagers to like anything).

As per the originator of the recipe, I cut the chicken into cubes and placed them in the casserole with the rest of the ingredients - raw. Oven at 350F, I cooked it for 35 min + 10 min to melt the cheese. Chicken was still raw when served. Had to 'nuke' the plates in the microwave. Either add another 15 min or saute in a skillet (like the editor said).  I found the dish to lack in flavour (I thought the roasted red bell pepper would really added flavour). Would have given a 3* - my girlfriend liked it better - therefore the 4*. Great for low calories!

Great starter base for Tava. I feel it needs a bit more flavor added. I am going to work on variations. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly as Carrie's comment revised it, and no one in my family liked it! It was too bland, it needed more spices. My kids thought it was boring, and my husband agreed. Snooze City!

I reviewed this recipe 9 yrs ago and it’s still in our recipe rotation.  I have added one little change in that I use the canned “fire-roasted” tomatoes and they add yet another layer of flavor. I still use a fraction of the amount of cheese called for and it’s still delicious

Followed Carrie’s recommendations and cubed the chicken, (though I did double the garlic), tossed it into the casserole “raw” with the rest of the ingredients...perfect!  Family wondered why so heldi

Followed the directions as stated by the woman who wrote the recipe (Carrie H). Took it to a foodie dinner and it was a huge hit!

While I know it is hard to find, Salca is a must for this recipe and if you can serve it with an unleavened flat break, warm to dip in it, its even better. Salca gives it the color and flavor. Salca is basically red peppers (seeds removed) in a paste form with olive oil, salt and sugar. You only need 1 Tbsp. The tomatoes should be peeled and seeds removed.

Good base but needs more flavor; I added spices (paprika, oregano) and some green olives.

Wasn't impressed, wasn't depressed.  I thought it missed the mark for Tava though.

This was pretty good, it was a little on the bland side but we like really spicy food.  We ended up adding extra pepper but we will make it again.  We also used canned chicken which made this really quick and easy to make.

Since I had never had Turkish food previously, I decided to be fair to the recipe by awarding four stars.  All I can state is that while I did not know what to expect, I thought it would be spicier.  It was rather bland.  The ingredients did go well together, but I think if I make it again, I will add a little paprika, and possibly some cayenne pepper to give it a little more kick.

I too was stationed at the "Lik" and enjoyed this dish as often as possible.  I made the dish per the original posters instructions as the edited version could make for some tough chicken.  Changes I made from memory 1. Sliced up about 7 garlic cloves. 2. Seasoned chicken 1st (sea salt and pepper, something's missing though) 3. Used mild Rotel tomatoes mixed with fire roasted tomatoes 4. Added a chopped up spicy green pepper like the ones they roasted in the alley.  This smelled and tasted great.  Thnx original poster for both the recipe submission and clarification.  Im still perfecting it and post any updates.

Instead of using the peppers called for.  Go to a middle east store if you have one nearby and ask for salcha.  It is spelt different but the name sounds like i spelt it.  you can get tomato or pepper salcha and it can be spicy too.  be careful when selecting. this will help your recipe be better than before. Try it with cubed lamb meat next time.
