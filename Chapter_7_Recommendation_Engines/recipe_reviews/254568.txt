Make your dressing first and let it set in the fridge while your making the rest of your dish, that little extra time melding together makes a difference. Real mayo and sour cream mixed together has a better flavor combo and be sure your potatoes have completely cooled before mixing or you will have smashed baked potato salad. It's a yummy recipe. Oh, and forget the bacon bits, fry your own bacon... so much better!

So easy to make and the Miracle Whip® adds a distinctive flavor to it that will have you coming back for more.

Delicious! I think next time I'll add chives. I will never eat plain old potato salad again

I don't like Miracle Whip but I loved it in this salad. This is now going to be the only potato salad I make.

This was very good. I used light version of sour cream & mayo as that’s all I ever purchase. My adult son happened to be here for dinner and said “don’t throw that recipe out mom, it’s a keeper.”   We agreed that it did taste just like a loaded baked potato.  Definitely will make again and again!!

This was terrific.  I added seasoning to the water when boiling the potatoes.  I also added red onion and more seasoning when it was completed.

Delicious, my new fave recipe!  Used Avocado Mayo, and Greek (Plain) Yogurt (instead of sour cream).

Yikes!  This is crazy good.   Super rich and flavorful.   Will make this for holiday cookouts from now on.   I used mayonnaise instead of Miracle Whip (I’ve never been a fan of it) and it was absolutely delicious!

The only change I made was to replace miracle whip for real mayo, and bacon bits for real bacon, yummy

Quick and easy to make, mighty tasty, we have made it twice. Once by the recipe and once we added chopped bread and butter pickles. Both ways were awesome! Will keep making this. Yummo!
