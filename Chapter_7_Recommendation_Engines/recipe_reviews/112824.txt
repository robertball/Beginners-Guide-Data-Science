Absolutely excellent recipe.  My entire family enjoyed it.  I didn't use the wings or thighs as suggested, but instead sliced up boneless chicken breasts and made it into nuggets.  Very tasty :-)

I helped my sister make this chicken recipe for a New Year's Eve party snack. It was delicious! A lot of fun to make! I tried a variation with honey to make it sweeter, turned out great! Love you sis!!

Although I didn't merinade the chicken for as long as I should have, the chicken came out wonderfully! The color was so nice and the outside crispy. For me, 10 minutes made them perfect! I do recommend this recipe!

Although this recipe gave the chicken a nice little asian taste and a beautiful crispy crust, it seemed like it was missing something.  I wish the recipe included a teriyaki sauce or something to dip in.  Next time, I may try cut up pieces of chicken breast and make my own teriyaki dipping sauce.

Thanks for sharing the recipe!  I love the way the corn starch and mochiko make such a lovely crust!

I am a huge wing fan and I've got to say these rank right up at the top. I did not have the redclay sea salt but did have some smoked sea salt and used that. This is definately in my recipe box for good.

Absolutely awesome chicken, lived in Hawaii(Kauai) for a year, sold a some local restaurants, live in Guam now not sold, had to duplicate.  You can play with this recipe. Add minced peppers for hot(sweet) wings, more pressed garlic, minced nuts(your favorite works well), sesame seeds, tastes best with peanut oil. Oil temp is best at 375. Goodluck!

I was skeptical about the recipe because the raw chicken was sitting in a goopy mess overnight. But it fried up beautifully with a great exterior. I made the recipe exactly but it needed a little bit more sweetness. I would try a reader's suggestion of adding honey next time.

This came out wonderfully and is very good with rice. I only marinated for 4 hours.
