EXCELLENT!  Very easy and tasty!  For those of you who claimed that the filling was too "mooshy", try baking the potatoes in the oven and not boiling them.  Baking them intensifies the flavor of the potatoes.

I made his recipe for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it.  He is VERY picky when it comes to sweet potato pie (usually only liking his mother's) but he is in love with this one.  I made one slight change.  I substituted the evaporated milk for eggnog.  The eggnog gave it and entirely different twist that was absolutely wonderful.  I also let it bake about 10 minutes longer so the center firms up.  This recipe is now my standard.

This splendidly spicy, buttery rendition of the Old South Favorite is more historically authentic by using brown sugar and remembering to add GINGER to the spices.  Very early American, old fashioned and perfectly delicious.  Can also be doubled for two pies.

Recipe is good, but mine is better.  Add a half teaspoon of lemon extract and vanilla extract; instead of all evaporated milk, add half evaporated milk and half sweet condensed milk.
Will not need to use so much sugar.

Prepare in pie crust and freeze until ready to cook.  Prepare and keep in the freezer to have year round.

Oh my Gosh! This is the best sweet potato pie I have ever had. I usually spend $8 on one from a bakery and now my family and I love this one. I can't believe how good this is and in such a short time! I used canned yams and half&half because I did not have milk. I also made my own crust(French Pastry Pie Crust on this site, also a winner) and used a spingform pan. My sweet potato recipe search is over! You gotta try this you will love it!

I followed the recipe and I didn't really like that much. I found it tasted to much like pumpkin pie. Not quite what I was looking for. The filling was a little chunky and I had to cook it longer then what was recomended and it still came out too mooshy. A good recipe if your looking for something like a pumpkin pie with a little twist though.

I have made this sweet potato pie 4 times.  Followed the recipe, made no alterations or substitutions and the pies were great.  Am no longer making pumpkin pie as this is so much better.

This pie tastes great but it's too airy and fell apart even when cold. There is also way too much butter. I made a note to reduce the butter by half next time and to not beat the whites separately.  The baking time was a bit short.. needed 15 minutes more baking, but I guess that depends on the type of pie plate you are using.

Very good recipe...nice texture and flavor.  I would recommend that the sugar be reduced.  The amount in the recipe made the pie much too sweet.  I will be making this one for Thanksgiving Day dinner instead of my usual pumpkin. 
(later) I did make this pie for T-Day dinner.  No one could tell the difference between this and pumpkin.

I also had to leave my pie in the oven for an extra twenty minutes because it still looked pretty jiggly in the middle. The extra time allowed the top to get a nice golden brown crust on it, and when cooled, it caramelized.

It's a tasty pie, and it looks great. If there's anyone who doesn't like the texture of pumpkin but does like the flavor, this would be a great substitute. Everyone at Thanksgiving liked it, but it didn't stand out because we also had pumpkin pie. It would definitely be perfect for when it's the only spiced pie.

My boys absolutely LOVED this pie and so did I. Made this recipe with a few of the recommended adjustments. I baked the potatoes instead of boiling them. We prefer a dense sweet potato pie so I did not separate the eggs. I eliminated the additional white sugar and made my own crust using another fabulous recipe on this site. 

The pie came out more dense, yet still very light. Served with a dollop of whipped topping. Perfect!

We smoke this pie in our smoker, at about 275, until the center sets. It is AWESOME! When smoked, it tastes like toasted marshmallows on the top of the pie. Wouldn't change a thing!

This pie recipe is sooo yummy!!! I baked my sweet potatoes for about an hour in a 350 degree oven instead of boiling them. The flavor was enhanced tremendously by this simple change. I also reduced the amount of white sugar to about 1/8 cup (2 Tbs) because I felt that the baked sweet potatoes tasted so naturally sweet. It received rave reviews from both mine and my boyfriend's family!

so far, I have not liked this, i am willing to admit it may have been me, so I am going to try again. The one good this I discovered though is that if you top with marshmallows in the last 5 mins, it really yummy.

This pie was so good and I don't even care for sweet potatoe pie like that! While growing up my mom always made this pie during the holiday season. My daughter and husband who are not fans of any type of sweets loved this. I did double everything and added a couple of things which are things my mom has always used in her pies. Brushed the edges of pie crusts with egg whites and baked for about 5-7 mins before pouring pie mix. I used 1/2 cup of sweetened condensed milk and 1/2 cup of evap. milk, 1/2 cup white sugar and 1 1/4 cup brown sugar b/c of the amount of cinnamon used (1 tbsp) AND b/c this pie is not sweet potatoe pie unless its sweet, lol. Added 1 tbsp vanilla flavor and 1 tsp all spice. One thing about sweet potatoe pie is that you have to make it according to your taste. So what may work for some may not work for others. I read a lot of the reviews before making my pies and thanks to those who provided the great tips. So good luck and enjoy!

The pie came out beautifully.  I have made Sweet Potato pie from a can before but never from scratch. This one definitely looks and from the compliments I received tastes better. I did bake my sweet potatoes wrapped in foil for about an hour before cooling for pie recipe. As most other reviewers this helps to get more of the sweet potato flavor. I ended up only needing two and a half large sweet potatoes to meet the two cup requirements. I will be using this recipe from now on, Thanks.

This was my first attempt at sweet potato pie, and I have to say, we weren't disappointed!  The only changes I made were I added 1 tsp vanilla and 2 tbs dark rum.

Very good pie. I will make this again. I did not use the butter by accident and it still was such a great pie. I also added in vanilla extract. Next time I will use less sugar. It is very sweet. I roasted instead of boiling the potatoes. I also had to cook this for 20 minutes longer than the directions stated.

I replaced the ginger with a fourth as much of ground cloves because ginger = pumpkin pie to me (1/4 teaspoon for two pies, would be 1/8th for one) and halved the sugar.  1 cup of sugar total, 1/2 brown and 1/2 white

Doing this allowed me to replace my tried and true, modified and tested over the years, sweet potato pie recipe (lost in a move). Everyone loved it!

Note:  Folding in the egg whites makes for a fluffier/higher pie which I learned a few years into making these for the holidays. So it's worth the trouble.

My only complaint is how long it took to set.  Needed 15 extra minutes of baking total.  Picture perfect when done.

As I love sweet potatoes I was initially just looking for any recipes featuring them when I stumbled upon this pie recipe. What attracted me first to it, was the line about the brother who loved this pie so much he learned to make it. It reminded me so much of my brother who is hardly interested in cooking, only in eating the end product... ;-) 
So I was very interested the effect the pie would have on my brother when I made it for my family.
Well, they all loved it although they had never tried anything like it, as sweet potatoes are not traditionally used in my country, especially not in cakes/pies. I was asked so many times to make it again and again and had to give out the recipe lots of times.
Well, the end of the story: It's now my brother's favourite cake/pie and he actually learned to make it (although he still needs a little bit of help - he's getting there).

Tanks for a wonderful recipe that has worked every time!
(Well, once I added a little bit too much nutmeg for my taste, but nobody seemed to notice...)

Note: As a pastry I made Jamie Oliver's Sweet Shortcrust Pastry from his book The Naked Chef. I think it works really well with the filling.

Excellent Recipe.   After readng all the reviews about how airy this pie was I did not fold in the egg whites but just beat them in with the yolks.  My husband likes crunchy toppings, so after I filled the pie shell I sprinkled butter cake mix on top and scattered some chopped pecans.  I sprayed parkay buttery spray on top (no fat or calories) then I baked it in the oven.  My husband loved it.  I also used a half cut of parkay buttery spray instead of the butter to make it healthy.  Thanks for a GREAT recipe

This pie was incredible. What made it over-the-top for me was roasting the sweet potatoes until they were well carmelized and mushy.

Thanks for this great recipe!

This was my first time making this type of pie. Very easy and a nice base for you to experiment with. I did omit the white sugar. It was sweet enough using only brown sugar. If you don't separate the eggs, it will have the consistency more like pumpkin pie. I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla, juice of half a lemon and the zest. I only had pumpkin pie spice, so I used a teaspoon instead of separate spices. Also, I usually bake my crust first until golden brown before filling and baking.

This recipe is great.  I've used this recipe for about 7 years now and this Thanksgiving I pulled it out again to whip one up.  I only had dark brown sugar this time and to my surprise, it made it so much more delicious than any others I have ever made.  As much as I enjoy this pie recipe as-is, I will be using dark brown sugar from now on!  Thanks for sharing.

This pie was VERY sweet. I doubled it, baked both and put one cooked pie in the freezer, tightly wrapped after cooling. The one we ate warm was spicy and delicious with whipped cream --the one that we defrosted and served cold a week later was even better! I've never frozen a pie before so this was one successful experiment :) I will cut back on the sugar a smidge next time, though, or save this recipe for a "holiday-pie".

Great pie! Only thing is there's a little too much sugar in it. I'm a sweet lover and this was a little much for me. Great balance of the rest of the spices and the fluffiness was great. Next time I will cut the white sugar in half.

This pie was very easy to make but needed an extra 15 minutes in the oven. I realize the difference between a gas and electric oven. Mine is now electric.

This is absolutely the best sweet potato pie I ever had! My husband usually makes our pies and he's pretty good at it, but this time I thought I'd give it a try and it was a great success! He loves it and so do I.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe...I'll definately use it again.

Oh My Gosh!  This was the best sweet potato pie I have ever ever had.  My son, my husband and I were very happy with it.  Serve it warm with cool whip on top.  Out of this world.  I actually used a can of yams and a pilsbury pie crust.  It was quick and delicious.  Thank you for this recipe.  It is a keeper.

This is the best sweet potato pie I have ever had!  I've gone thru many recipes but this one is by far the best. One small tip: this pie is even better on the next day, so making it ahead of time is a great idea. I took it to a Thanksgiving get together and everyone was raving about it. Since doubled the recipe I had plenty leftover at home which did not last too long because we just ate it up too fast - Yeah, go with this one, it is without a doubt a WINNER!

this will be my go to recipe for sweet potato pie.  The only thing i changed was to reduce the brown sugar by 1/2.  Everyone loved the pie, i gave pies out as gifts to my family and each one called to rave about how they ate the entire pie by themselves.  :-)

Excellent.  I did add the lemon juice and vanilla that another recipe suggested.  I also baked the sweet potatoes in the oven instead of boiling for better flavor.  Will make again.

This is an excellent pie.  Very sweet, but that's the nature of sweet potatoes!  Don't cut corners and add the eggs all at once as this ruins the fluffy texture.  I will definitely make this pie again.

The recipe turned out great.....tasting better than my pumpkin pie recipe. I did modify the recipe just a bit....incorporating the eggs all at once instead of beting the egg whites separate (serious time saver) and using sweetened condensed milk instead of the evaporated milk AND sugar. I doubled the recipe tto make two pies and they both came out perfectly fine.  I would recommend baking tthe sweet potatoes in the oven for two hours and using a food processor to make the potatoes smooth for a better texture. This recipe even allows for a slight mishap of forgetting to turn the oven temperature down.  THANKS FOR THE GREAT RECIPE!!!!

Really great.  Not your traditional custard pie, light and airy. (if you leave it in the fridge overnight is more dense) Huge hit a my party. Piled high with real whipped cream. Didn't change a thing.  I might bake potatoes next time. Have used twice and now will be my standard Sweet potato Pie.  Good Job

This recipe is wonderful! My husband doesn't like pumpkin pie, so i thought i'd try this instead and he LOVED it! I followed some of the suggestions of others and didn't separate the eggs and i didn't add the white sugar. I had to cook the pie for an extra 16 minutes (my oven cooks a little cool).  I baked the sweetpotatoes and mashed them with the butter (which would have made a lovely side dish all on its own) then added the rest of the ingredients.  This is SOOOO good!

WOW. LOVED IT. Small change. I did not add the white sugar, it was plenty sweet w/out it. And I decreased the ginger/nutmeg by a pinch, because I didn't want my  pie to taste like a pumpkin pie.

This is the first time I've made a sweet potato pie. I wanted to see how I'd do on my own without asking my Mom how to do it. It's very, very good. But my Mom's pie still tops it. I was actually trying to make 2 pies, but came up a bit short on mashed potatoes. And although I didn't increase the ingredients to accomodate the extra potatoes, it still tastes great (not too sweet). It's so good I'm going to make it for Thanksgiving this year.

This is a delicious pie as it was my first sweet potato pie I've ever made. However it does require a longer time in the oven which is why I gave it fours stars. Also it is very important to FOLD in the pie mixture with the whites/sugar. It makes it fluffy. I Let mine cool and placed it in the fridge to set and served it with whip cream. It has such a nice taste as I am not fond of pumpkin pie. Also, I did use canned sweet potatoes.

Absolutely Awesome!!! I make this pie for as a dinner in itself, since sweet potatoes are so good for us! Instead of using the condensed milk I use plain yogurt and it works perfect. Also, the leftovers are delicious as breakfast.

WOW!  I was so impressed with this recipe.  Being in Canada we hear about Sweet Potato Pie, but you really don't meet anyone who knows how to make it .. or has even had it for that matter.  So I figured if I was going to get a chance to taste it I was just gunna have to make it.  This was the one I decided upon.  I reduced the Nutmeg, and Ginger by half, because I generally don't like those ingredients in recipes, but after I've made it that way I may try it full strength.  I was so so impressed though.  SUCH a good pie.  It was a total hit at my house.  I could have sat down by myself and ate the whole thing.  lol  Of course I wouldn't .. but I could have.  SO SO good.  Simular to pumpkin pie, but better.  Thanks so much for posting it!

I ate a slice of this pie about out of the oven, and really loved it... However, I became kinda bored eating it at room temperature, and put it in the refrigerator: delicious.
A bit too light, "airy", at room temperature, but definitely wonderful right out of the oven or refrigerated.

This pie tasted better than my grandmother's!  I used fresh sweet potatoes that I baked instead of boiled and I think it added to the flavor of the pie.  This pie is on permanent rotation!!

I am from the south and I have to say that this pie is better than my mother's.It is so good and worth the effort to make it. I think that the egg whites are what makes this pie so much lighter than other pies.

Great.  This is a new thanksgiving staple.  It is amazing what the egg whites do to this pie.  It is like eating a candies sweet potato and the texture is gooey and kind of crispy.

This is a very good recipe.  I've made it several times and have made a few discoveries: 1) bake your sweet potatoes - don't boil them.  This makes for a more concentrated flavor. 2) puree them in the food processor - don't just mash them (my family doesn't like the fibrous texture when they're just mashed). 3) reduce the amount of sugar - I used 3/4 cup this last time.  4) Grate your own whole nutmegs, and use fresh ginger rather than the powdered stuff for a spicier kick.

Made  this pie 2010 Thanksgiving!!  It was a big hit.  The only thing I added was 1/2 teas of Vanilla flavoring.  The second batch the potatoes were completly cooled (I microwaved them)  and the Batter was a little lumpy.  I recommend mixing while the potatoes are still a little warm.  I did have to bake the pie almost 20 minutes longer.  This will be my standard recipe!

Delicious sweet potato pie! Very southern. Only requires around 2-2 1/2 large potatoes. Let cook thoroughly. Place aluminum foil loosely over pie to avoid over-browning.

Wow, super yummy, never had sweet potato pie before, I wanted to try something different and found this recipe and just loved it, it would have been even better if I would have got one more piece but the family finished it off the first day!!!

I tried many of the sweet potato pie recipes from this site and from shared family recipes. None can hold a candle to this pie. Sweet Potato Pie II is so rich and creamy, it matches to perfect flavor with the perfect texture... and let's face it, texture is very important for this type of pie.

Flavor was good, but I like a more traditional texture. This was too mushy. I had to cook it about 30 min. longer than recipe said for it to set. I used a 9" deep dish pie shell and it filled up to the top. Guess that was why it took so long to cook. Don't plan on making it again.

I'd never made a sweet potato pie before. I used this recipe & it turned out PERFECT. It tasted better than some of the vets' pies in my family :~) I also used N.Nero's (see comment below) flaky pie crust recipe.    I would definitely recommend this recipe!

This pie was wonderful. It was my first attempt at sweet potato pie and it was easy and turned out perfect. I made it with 3 large sweet potatos, but kept all the other ingredients the same. It made enough for 2 pies and they were delish! Thank you. This ones going in the recipe box for sure.

Maybe I did something wrong, because this recipe has gotten such great reviews, but I really didn't like this sweet potato pie. I followed some reviewer's suggestions and did not separate the whites, but after baking I didn't like the consistency. Too similar to just mashed sweet potato for me. I used boiled sweet potatos which I mashed by hand, next time I try a sweet potato pie recipe I think that I'll blend them instead of mashing. The pie was also way too sweet, it's cloying makes it hard to eat very many bites.

My husband loves sweet potato pie so I've been on a misson for the best recipe, this is it! I reduced the ginger and nutmeg a little but increased the amount of cinnamon(I love cinnamon). I also used about half the amount of white sugar. I agree with other reviews, you will have to add about 15 minutes to the cook time....This is a winner, I've made it many times and I will make it many more!

This is a really good tasting recipe.  However my husband and I weren't too thrilled with the consistency.  Next time I think I will follow the advice of other reviews and skip beating the eggs.  Thanks for a great recipe.

All is can say is WOW!  This pie was amazing!  I made it for Thanksgiving and everyone raved about it!  We liked it so much that we made another one the following day since the first one was devoured completely!  I will never make pumpkin pie again as this pie is so much better. :)

I liked this recipe, it was very good. I didn't make it into a pie though, I doubled the recipe, spooned it into a casserole dish, put a layer of pecans over it, then marshmellows and it turned out awesome.

I'm not sure what I did wrong, but I ended up with enough for a pie and a half, but I'm sure it was my error somehow.  At any rate, I had lots of mashed sweet potatoes left over, so what I did was fill up one pie crust with the regular pie filling, then poured the rest into the 2nd pie crust and it only filled up halfway. I added more of the mashed sweet potatoes and mixed them in, to fill up the 2nd pie crust.  I did have to bake them about 10 minutes longer than stated, but that could just be my oven.  Anyway, I really liked both pies, but I actually liked the pie with the extra sweet potatoes in it better!  I think that in the future, I will add another cup/cup and a half of sweet potatoes to the recipe and bake 2 pies with a thicker filling.  I also cheated and used pumpkin pie spice, rather than individual amounts of cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger.  Either way, both pies were very tasty and I will be making this every holiday season.

I made this instead of pumpkin pie on a lark.  It is fantastic.  I think it might be my new favorite recipe.  I used Trader Joe's pie crust and it was so easy.  Great recipe!!

I prepared this recipe to make a pie for Thanksgiving 2005.  The recipe was easy and quick.  The pie was great.  I will use this recipe from now on.  I used can sweet potatoes instead of peeling fresh potatoes.  It was still great.  Thank you Cathy for sharing your recipe.

i'm not from the south, but my husband is and he requested sweet potato pie for thanksgiving. i had never even had sweet potato pie before. he gave me a high five when he tasted it. i cook all the time, and this is the first time that i have ever gotten a high five! fantastic. i would recommend a deep dish crust though, i had too much filling for a regular crust.

This was a very easy recipe and my husband liked it alot. I think next time I will put foil around the edge of the pie and bake it a little while first. I like a brown flakey crust.

Wow, this recipes is so good! I consider myself a pretty good cook, but not so much of a baker, but this recipe was very easy. Even though it said masher potatoes, i did'nt know if I should just mash them or puree them, I used a hand mixer so there were a few little lumps of sweet potatoes in it but I think it gave it a more homemade taste to it, very very good, my friends and family loved it, this will be on our thanksgiving table!

I made this pie for Thanksgiving. My husband's family came over and luckily I made two of them or they would have left me with an empty pie plate. I put in some fresh grated ginger and left out the white sugar because I thought the brown sugar was enough. It was my first sweet potato pie and it was a hit.

cooked this the night before thanksgiving and gave my dad a sample piece. he rated it "the best sweet potato pie he ever tasted." that is really saying something because he has been eating it since he was a kid. i used the Mrs. Smith deep dish pie crust and light brown sugar. totally fab.

Even better with some fresh whipped cream! Foolproof. I make it at least 2 times a year, up to 8, with no problems. And it tastes delicious.

The only change I made was to add vanilla and lemon flavoring, as one other reviewer suggested. It's so delicious, my picky husband asked me to make it again, after he devoured the first one!

I used canned sweet potatoes and doubled the recipe to make two pies. I added two tablespoons of lemon juice to the mixture. I cooked it at 400 degrees for 15 minutes and reduced to 350 for 30 minutes and it was not done. I had to add an additional 10 minutes of cooking time.  The pie was okay, but the butter was too much and the pie tasted bland.  I wouldn't make this recipe again.

Great recipe. I used a tbsp of flour for a firmer texture.  The filling is excellent baked inside the mini Graham cracker cups.

This was delicious!  Now to get to the supermarket to get the unbaked pie crust.  I have alot of sweet potatoes that need to be put to use.  Will also bake this for my daughter when I go to visit her next weekend (she's on medical leave).  I will use this recipe again and again.....

I tweaked this recipe from the start. Instead of using 1/2 Teaspoon of Ginger, Nutmeg and Cinnamon, I used 1/4 Teaspoon of Allspice, Nutmeg and Cinnamon. I also used 1/4 Teaspoon Vanilla Extract and 1/4 Cup (Pulp Free) Orange Juice.

I then baked the pie 15 minutes at 400 instead of 10 and 35 minutes at 350 instead of 30.

I made this pie, but I with a few changes. I added lemon juice, a little all spice and cloves. I also did 3/4 cup of white sugar and 1/2 of brown sugar. I boiled my potatoes in stead if baking them. This was first time making a pie,and it was really good.

I had never made pie until this pie. I used pillbury pie crust instead of making my own as a short cut. But this came out amazing and I will now be using it for every holiday. You will love this recipe.

this recipe is awesome!! my family, friends, and in-laws have loved it!! i follow it to the T!!  i have made it several times to take to a friends home, my in-laws, and my own, and everyone loved it and have not had any left. my mother-in-law even went and bought me some more sweet potatos to make more! i use the real sweet potatos i peel them, boil them until tender, then mash mash, wait for them to cool, then follow the rest of the recipe. i usually boil enough to make 2-3 pies at a time. i have one in the freezer now. hope it still tastes good when thawed. thank you for this recipe!!

This recipe was excellent and just what I was looking for....no changes necessary!  I did have to allow for additional cooking time, but they have been due to the fact that I doubled the recipe and was cooking two pies at once.

This is only the second sweet potato pie recipe I've tried, but it was 10x better than the first! The spices were fabulous, to which I added allspice and vanilla, used salt substitute, and decreased the brown sugar by 1/4 cup. I doubled the recipe, but used three jumbo yams, so I ended up w/ THREE pies! Yes, I said THREE! Still not sure exactly how many pies the original recipe actually yields. I baked the yams & pie longer at a lower temp, just watching to make sure the crust didn't burn, which worked fine. Took one to work for 'hump' day & that became the happiest hump day ever! One co-worker said she doesn't like sweets too sweet and this pie was perfect! Another likes his sweets sweet, but still loved it, so I think I might stick to less brown sugar, since sweet sweets lovers can adjust much more easily to less sweet than the opposite. Can't wait to use this one for next family gathering! Thanks for a winner!!!

This was an excellent recipe, especially since I had all ingredient on hand for once!   I like a spicier pie so I doubled the spices and then I sprinkled a large amount of brown sugar all over the top of the pie - it gave it a delicious crispy crust on top and looks nice too.    I would definitely recommend creaming the butter and brown sugar before adding the other ingredients in step one, or else the butter even if soft, doesn't mix very well once you have all that liquid in there.  That may be a no brainer but it wasn't in the directions.

Excellent pie!!!! This is the fourth time I've made this pie and it's incredible every time!  My family prefers this over pumpkin pie!  However, I double the cinnamon and add extra ginger and nutmeg. I also use about 3/4 cup of brown sugar instead of a full cup.  BEST SWEET POTATO PIE EVER!

My fiance said that he didn't like sweet potato pie, and I told him that he could at least try it.  After about an hour of, "I don't like sweet potatoes." crying in my ear he tried it and ate half the pie already.  Next time I'm cutting out some of the sugar. Other then that, yum-o.

Very tasty - great warm! I did have to cook it longer as the middle seemed to stay very soft. It is a sweet dish since cooked sweet potatoes are naturally sweet so I would maybe cut down the white sugar a tad next time. Otherwise, I wouldn't make any changes. Delicious!

Yum!  I substituted 3/4 c condensed milk for the evap milk & sugar.  I also used fresh ground ginger, nutmeg & cinnamon.  Fluffy & delicious.  Even my 6-year old son liked it!

this recipe is awesome. i added a 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla extract.  and of course, i baked the potatoes.  so good, this was so good, my fiancee was totally impressed, and she is spoiled by her momma's sweet potato pie.  i even made it for thanksgiving and is was a success.  i've made this four times already, each time its a little unique, but always awesome.

This is a very nice recipe.  The texture was a surprise, it was a bit fluffy.  I was expecting a creamier filling, which I prefere.  It was a wonderful tasting pie, but not your traditional pie texture.

I absolutely loved this.  The only thing I would change is to maybe add some vanilla and definitely use a homemade crust.  I used "Easy to Remember Pie Crust" off this site w/ butter instead of crisco.

This is THE best sweet potato pie recipe. I went through a few before I found this one, and this is the best by far. I use only 1/4 cup butter, cooked fresh yams, and I give the cooked yams a good beatin' before adding other ingredients to get it really smooth. Also, like other reviewers, I cook it until set, which is a little longer than the directions specify. I actually like it a little brown and slightly cracked on top. Everyone loves this pie, and I'm asked to make it alot.  In fact, I'm making two tonight to bring to a bbq tomorrow.  You have to try this one!

I have made this recipe twice and I love it!  I did have to cook it longer but that could be my oven.  I don't think I changed anything from the original.  I ate the whole thing myself practically.

Hands down the best sweet potato pie I have tasted. It is easy and I had no problems, it turned out perfect. Everyone who tasted it says it is the best and my daughter stated she will no longer eat pumpkin pie, this is soo much better. =)

This pie was a little too sweet for my taste, but my friends loved it!  It took a lot longer to bake than stated in the recipe, and slighty carmelized and cracked on top, but it tasted just fine.

I love sweet potato pie, and this one was great. I'm used to ones with fewer spices, as this one tasted more like pumpkin pie with all the spices in it than sweet potato pie. But it was yummy nonetheless.

WOW!! I have never made sweetpotatoe pie before...this was WONDERFUL.  I made this for thanksgiving and my husband actually asked me "Are you sure we have to share that?"  I topped it with whipped cream (submitted by Paula on this site) and it was about the best pie I have ever had.  The family just raved over it.  No one believed I made it, they all thought it was store bought.  I did add a little extra spices (I love cinnamon and also thru in a little powdered vanilla). Will definately make this again!!! Thanks so much Cathy!

Fantastic! I made this for my boyfriend who had trepidations about trying sweet potatoe pie. He adored it and begged me to make it again! He said it wasn't overly sweet and went great with the turkey dinner I fixed for Easter. It was fun and easy to put together, which was ideal since I'm not much for baking.

Absolutely amazing! Loved it! I doubled the ingredients to make two pies but I ended up with enough filling for three. Added some vanilla (can't break that habit) and it was great. Also, I don't have a food processor but the ingredients mixed just fine with a spoon or a whisk. Thanks for the recipe Cathy!

This has become a regular for the holidays. I’ve followed the recipe and have had great results. I do bake the sweet potatoes skin on and reserve any juice/syrup they produce for the pie mix. After skinning the potatoes I mash (and string if needed) and measure. For variations I’ve topped with nuts and butter/flour crumble mix. Thanks for such a great recipe! (Note:a tip from my Mom always select small tube shaped sweet potatoes to avoid stringiness or mealy consistency).

This pie was fabulous!!  I've tried several sweet potato pies, and they're usually too loose and don't set up well. This one tasted great and the body was firm -- like a pie should be!  This will be my go-to sweet potato pie recipe from now on!

Definitely my favorite sweet potato pie recipe ever! I make it with just a couple of modifications. If you're from the Deep South, you don't need to separate the eggs. It's even tastier when it's dense - instead of fluffy. You can also use 1/2 cup light brown sugar and 3/4 cup white sugar, instead of 1cp brown sugar to 1/4cp white sugar. As well, I squeeze in a half of real lemon (strained) to contrast the sweet taste. I also add alumuminum around the pie edges, before cooking, because I cook the pie for about 1.25 hours - to make sure it's cooked well and the color is burnt orange. Your pie should not look like it's golden. Next time, I'm gonna try it with half and half instead of evaporated milk. Regardless, this recipe will be your go to favorite.

The sugar killed it. It was just too sweet. Most of the pie went in the trash, no one could handle more then a tiny sliver of it because it was so sweet. Even the kids could not take the sugar.

I prepared this recipe as posted and i must say that this made the best sweet potato pie that I've ever had. This will be my fourth year going with this recipe. The recipe is awesome, but  the frothy egg whites are what takes this to a whole new level with the texture. Thanks for sharing and I would definitely recommend this to anyone.

I rarely bake pies.  When I found this recipe and tried it, it made me look like I knew what I was doing. I have used this recipe twice and the results are wonderful. I do agree roasting the sweet potatoes is the best way to go. Thank you for sharing!

This is my recipe and just wanted to make a note if your pies are coming out too mushy then your not whipping egg whites long enough then will have to cook longer..They need to be whipped to a white fluffy cream and they can make a peak....just fold in the rest of mixture don't stir...thank you for all the reviews.

with so many variations of sweet potato pie recipes out there,I'm trying to find a recipe for the perfect pie,that is dense and heavy in the  bite that's not lite,too wet and custard-like. I love a pie that tastes wonderful when it's served cold.

I, like GG, make mine the exact same way with the Lemon and Vanilla extracts! Nonetheless, this one was still really delicious and the evaporated milk adds a timeless richness that reminds me of my grandmothers!

My son made this for Thanksgiving and the wonderful aroma woke me up that morning.  It is one of the best pie's I have ever had.   Absolutely love the brown sugar!  The only thing I would do next time is scale back the sugar a little  as it was a bit on the sweet side for me.  It's not quite so sweet eating it room temp or cooler.  It is decadent while it is warm.  you don't even need a crust, it makes an incredible custard.  It was made with Alan' Pie Crust another winner, recipe on All Recipes also.

Kudo's to the Chef!!!

This came out perfect and delicious!!! I made it a little simpler and here's what I did: I microwaved the sweet potatoes for both ease and so that they wouldn't be watery. Since I wasn't at home and didn't have a mixer, I didn't bother with separating the eggs (none of the other recipes call for this). I used 1 1/8 cups of brown sugar and eliminated the white sugar. Finally, I used 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp of allspice. We loved it so much, I'm making it again the very next day!!!

Pretty good! I don't care much for pumpkin pie but I've always loved sweet potato pie. I modified this recipe ever so slightly but still had a great result. I don't bother to separate the eggs. I just put everything together in the bowl and stir it up until smooth, which can be done by hand. I used whole milk, not evaporated and I baked at 350 degrees for about 55 minutes. I happened to have some pecans around so I decorated the top in a circular pattern just before putting the pie in the oven. YUM!

Just made this pie last night and it was wonderful!  Very light and fluffy and mmmmm good!
Only thing I did different is reduce the brown sugar to 1/2cup, and upped the spices from a 1/2 tsp to a full tsp. I also added allspice which gave it a wonderful flavor. I added 15 min to the baking time and it was perfect.  Don't boil the potatoes, bake them. Boiling takes away from the flavor and will make your batter more mushy than firm.

This was not my first sweet potato pie but it was definitely the best! I made six pies for Christmas and my guest and I loved it. The texture was smooth and the taste was perfect. I followed the exact recipe, I didn't add any additional ingredients. This recipe will definitely be added to my Homemade Recipe Book.

This receipe was ok but I had to add flour to the mix to make more thicker.  I also added some almond flavor and that gave it a different flavor. This made it very flavorful.

This was the best sweet potato recipe I've tried and it tasted absolutely marvelous. The only drawback is that it molded quickly but that was my fault for not storing it in the refrigerator. I know better now.

I've never seen a pie disappear so fast! It was so easy to make - I even used a toaster oven to cook it, worked perfectly

I made this for the family and they loved it. I did change the amount of surgar to less.  I scooped the brown sugar rather than packed it.  Some of the family likes real sweet and didnt care for it but those who watch their sugar intake but want a little taste of sweet really liked it. Thanks.
I made this again without the sugar for a friend who cant have it in place I used 4 Tblspn of Blue Aguve instead and no crust.  It turned out great

This was a great recipe except that I played around with it just a bit to make it have a bit more flavor and texture. Added a touch more of the cinnamon, nutmeg,ginger and also added a little vanilla for taste. I also make the mix a little bit thicker by adding just a touch more of the potatoes and making the egg whites and white sugar like a meringue consistency. I have made this every year for thanksgiving and always get great remarks about the pie. The family always ask that I make it in advance.

Yummy!  I'm no sweet potato pie expert, but my husband and I enjoyed eating our dessert and getting our veggies at the same time.  Mmmmm.  I added homemade whipped cream for some extra yum.  I used a 7" pie pan - perfect for 2 - and this recipe halved still made enough for two 7" pies.  I think that if you're using a 9" pie pan you may want to half the recipe because it makes a LOT of filling!

Easy recipe to make.  And very yummy!  Make sure you have a deep dish pie plate this recipe will fill it.  I didn't have a deep dish pie plate and the pie ran over during cooking.

This pie is fabulous!!!!!    I took the advice from a few of the ratings and reduced the amount of white sugar by half. Also added 1/2tsp of vanilla. Could probably have skipped the white sugar all together because pie was a little too sweet for my taste BUT STILL excellent!!!!

This pie was amazing!  Perfect texture, amazing spice levels and the flavor!  Oh, I will be using this recipe frequently!    I baked and then peeled my sweet potatoes.  Followed the recipe, folded in the egg whites, and baked!  Easy to make!  My family was skeptical, because of the way it looks, but they all agreed it was amazing!

I'm sorry, but this recipe was just awful.  I made it exactly as called for.  It had an odd texture (not at all like other commonly textured sweet potato or pumpkin pies).  I definitely would not make this again.

Great. This is the first time I've actually made a pie!!! It turned out perfect and we loved it! I cooked it about 55 min and for a topping i took 1/3 cup evaporated milk, lots confectioners sugar(didn't measure), vanilla extract, and cinnamon powder and mixed on medium. Great recipe. I also have made my sweet potato cassreole. i love finding great recipes like this on the internet!! Thanks

Great! I substituted half and half for the evaporated milk and used half the brown sugar, and it was plenty sweet. Next time will use even less sugar.

I loved this recipe. The only problem I had was the oven was a little hot for the pie crust, so it burnt. other than that it is great! Next time I make it, I will be sure to reduce the heat a little so i don't come out with burnt pie.

This was my first sweet potato pie attempt and it came out great. I did add allspice and excluded the ginger. Everything else remained the same. I did not find it to be too sweet at all, just right for me!

I loved this recipe.  It made a nice full pie that was tasty and pretty easy.  I plan on baking this for Thanksgiving.  It reminded me of a very flavorful pumpkin pie.

Wonderful! I made this pie for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit with Cool Whip while it was still warm (in fact I had to make two pies because my dog decided that he loved the sweet potato pie too!)

So good!  I accidentally forgot to add the butter-- although it was much more airy than traditional pumpkin or sweet potato pie, it was still DELICIOUS! I think I might 'forget' to add the butter the next time I make it to cut back on the fat :)

I've heard so much "hoopla" about Sweet Potato pie, mainly on American television, I decided to try it out at my Canadian Thanksgiving dinner.  Everyone loved it!  It's even better than our traditional pumkin!  And easy as...pie!

I liked this pie alot. However, I'm not sure what I did wrong, but it didn't set up in the middle as well as I would have liked. I ended up serving it with a spoon because even after doubling the baking time, it was still very runny. The flavor was awesome, though!

I've never had or made a sweet potato pie before, but after eating this we'll never go back to pumkin. After reading reviews, I didn't use any white sugar for the egg whites. Next time I make this I'm going to try 1/8c white sugar & reduce the brown sugar to 2/3 - 3/4c.

I'm new to cooking and forgot to separate the eggs & cooked it at 400 degrees for the whole cycle. It still turned out delicious. I'll try it again the right way and it should be even better.

Very good recipe! Folding the beaten egg whites into the batter really makes ten filling fluffy and light! I took some of the sugar out and it’s still pretty sweet. Next time, I’d also use a bit less nutmeg and more cinnamon - just my taste.

I haven't tasted the pie yet but I just took it out of the oven and I'm worried it isn't going to set right. I've baked pumpkin pies in a bakery before and when we took them out of the oven they were very jiggly in the middle, but still looked exactly the same as when I put them in the oven. This pie puffed up so much and it's starting to settle pretty well and the size has gone down but I'm not sure if its all the way set even though the top is golden brown and even cooked to the point of cracking...I'm making it for a friend so I just hope it doesn't turn out like an unedible soup. I did taste some of the batter before I baked it and to me it was a good amount of sweetness--not too much. Definitely add some vanilla though.

I love this pie.  I'm not a fan of pumpkin pie, so made this instead, and my entire family loved it.  It's a staple now, I make it every Thanksgiving!  I don't change a thing, as it's perfect as is.  I usually do leave it in the oven an extra 15 minutes or so, so it's a bit firmer when I take it out.  Such a great recipe!

This recipe is fantastic! I follow the recipe to the T except I use a pinch of allspice instead of nutmeg and don’t bake the pie crust for 10 minutes before cooking. Some say allspice should only be used in pumpkin pie but my family hasn’t complained! My advice is to definitely bake the potatoes to get them nice and soft and make sure your mixing blades are clean when you beat the egg whites. This pie is one of my best sellers at bake sales!

I didn't make any changes and it was absolutely wonderful!!
The filling was perfect , I boiled the sweet potatoes as I
always do. It didn't need lemon or any other substitute.
If anyone thinks their recipe is better, then stick with yours and I will certainly use this one again and again!
Thank You!

I made this pie yesterday
 first time for me making pies. it came out perfect, needless to say, there was no time to take a picture. however, I made one adjustment, I skipped the white sugar, since I thought that was just too much sugar for that size pie. to me it had just the right amount of sweetness. I will definitely make it again

Delicious as is. Next time use 3/4c brown sugar and 1/2 stick of  butter (2oz). Fills 2 pie crusts.

I followed the recipe except the sweet potato I bought weighed 1.50 pounds, not sure how that measured up in cups. I used the entire potato and the recipe was amazing! Will be making this again next week!

I altered it by reducing the brown sugar, butter, nutmeg and ginger by half. Kept the rest of the recipe the same. Used my blender to mix.  Didn't bother creating egg white peaks, just put all in there at once.  The filling was quite sweet and rich without the extra sugar and butter.  Since I wanted it to taste more like sweet potato and less like pumpkin, I limited the ginger and nutmeg,   I haven't actually tasted the pies yet, but the filling was delicious.

We have been making this for a few years now (my sister actually makes it) and its great!  Comes out perfect!  I would say baking the potatoes is better as boiling anything gives more water and less flavor. But its up to ones own desires.

This pie is good but, a bit too sweet for my taste.  I think that one packed cup of brown sugar is too much!!! Next time I will use white sugar  and vanilla extract instead.

I've been making this pie since I started cooking for Thanksgiving, so about 8 years! Its amazing, there's so much spice and flavor, the whipped yolks are like a secret ingredient. Makes the pie so yummy. I highly recommend it, when I make it everyone raves about it and asks for the recipe, but I never tell em! Im too selfish to share this one :)

I tried this for aThanksgiving meal.  It's perfect for a novice like me.  I'm not much of a cook, especially desserts.  I'll definitely make this again.   Thanks for sharing.

I've made this pie twice.  It even won a pie bake-off.  I madea praline sauce to put on it.  I had to cook it for an hour.

This is my go to recipe for sweet potato pie. Since finding it almost 10 years ago on the site, I have made it almost every Thanksgiving and Christmas. I think folding the egg whites in is what makes it taste lighter than some other recipes I've tried. I am not a Southerner by birth but this pie has helped me fit right in with my thoroughly Southern family.

LET IT REST!
Haven't eaten it yet, but our final result is rather burnt because I tried to cook it until firm. After cooking nearly an hour, we took it out, it was still liquid but then it firmed as it cooled. It looks good now, but all the little marshmellows we put on top are charcol fused on the bottom of my oven.

I have a friend who hates cake and a few years ago requested a sweet potato pie for his birthday instead. I am almost certain this was the recipe I used and it was very good. Turned out a bit lighter than the pie I have made for years (thanks to the egg whites). He said it was the best sweet potato pie he had ever eaten.

Started making this recipe and found out I didn't have brown sugar so I used white and added some molasses. Forgot the 1/4 cup white sugar mixed in with egg whites so dusted the pie after baking with confection sugar.  Everyone who tasted it told me it was AWSOME! Can't wait to try it the way it was written! Fantastic!

I have never baked a sweet potato pie in my life. I found this recipe while searching for a good Christmas dessert. It was really easy to make and not time consuming at all. I was VERY surprised when my husband went back to kitchen for a second slice. I will be making this again!!

This is the lightest, most flavorful sweet potato pie recipe I have tried yet.  Not being from the south, I had never made sweet potato pie, but my in-laws (thoroughly southern) were totally amazed at this Yankee's pie!

This is very good! The only thing I'd change is to not use ginger. I've eaten sweet potato pie since I've been a kid and my grandmother never used ginger. I used a hand blender to make the sweet potatoes more smooth. Thanks for the recipe!

very good, every person at the Halloween party enjoyed it  much more then three other pies, A matter of fact, mine was finished and gone while other pies were less then half gone.  I was told that it was better than the nice pumpkin pie that every one loves,  but more taste and better.

This was nice and easy.  I made it for the first time this Thanksgiving.  I ended up using yams instead of sweet potatoes, but I don't think that made a big deal.  I also ran out of brown sugar, so I used demera, but I don't think it was a big deal either.  Also, I was freestyle with the spices-- I just added unitl I felt they were enough.  I included allspice in the mix too.  I received compliments, so I'm pleased.

I made this for Thanksgiving, and followed some of the suggestions others posted here. I added a 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract, and cut the sugar to just 1/2 cup brown sugar, and left out the white sugar. I thought it was plenty sweet, but my sister said a little more sugar would have been better. So it really depends on how sweet you like your pies. I don't think sweet potatoes need much sugar. Also, the filling texture was a little too stiff, so next time I will try just adding whole eggs, and not beating the whites. But overall great recipe and I would make it again!

Delicious! A touch too sweet for my tastes, but I admittedly eat less sugar than the average person, so I won't complain. Otherwise a fabulous recipe!

so i was ready to love this pie, i made it for dessert with the excellent french pastry recipe from this site, & baked the kumera as suggested by others, but though i like the idea, the flavour was too dense & overpowering for my random, spice & all things potato lovin family. next time i will just boil the kumera before mashing & add less spices to chill it out & let the flavours have room to move..icecream was a good buffer..

I made this at thanksgiving 2007 and there was not a piece left, plus my husbands uncle is wanting my to come for a visit so I can make him another one. I added more cinamon and nutmeg to mine and less sugar, used brown splenda also.

This was a good recipe.  I neglected to measure my potatoes, so my pie had trouble setting, but everyone still loved it.

This turned out okay. The taste was good but the texture was different than I am use to it wasn't "fluffy" and it was very dark, more brown than orange. So it didn't look like a sweet potatoe pie. Maybe it was the brown sugar.

This was wonderful.  The only thing I did differently was add a little vanilla extract.  I made pumpkin and sweet potatoe pies for Thanksgiving and this was the favorite.

I have been making this recipe since November 2001.  I first made it for Thanksgiving because I promised my best friend's husband that I would give it a try (he is animalistic when it comes to his love of sweet potato pie).  He said "Don't ever lose that recipe--it is the best I have ever had."  Since then I have had to make him one every year to take home with him.  He usually finishes it in two to three days.  I think the beaten egg whites are the real trick--makes it so light instead of thick and heavy like some recipes.  Thank you so much for sharing your recipe with us.

sooooo yummy!  i had never made a sweet potato pie before and decided to make one for Thanksgiving this year.  i chose this recipe because it seemed simple and got great reviews.  it is so good!  and relatively easy to make.  YUM!

it does take quite a bit longer to bake than the recipe says though.  i took mine out of the oven too soon and it cracked down the middle.  it was still yummy though!

Got to chime in with everyone else - one of the best sweet potato pies I've ever had!  I think it is the meringue whipped into the pumpkin that makes the difference.  Gives it a custard texture.  Yummy!

This recipe is fantastic and easy to make.  I had only made one other sweet potato pie before, and this recipe was superb! The texture and flavor was wonderful.
