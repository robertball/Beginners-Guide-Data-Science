Made this with our first lettuce from the garden.  It was not a head of red leaf, but instead a mixture of red and green leaf lettuce.  It was better than we both were anticipating.  You do have to be careful when adding the buttermilk as it wants to curdle. I did add a little Wondra® as a thickening agent rather than the flour at the end.
