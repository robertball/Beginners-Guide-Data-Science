One batch of these cookies and my husband was hovering in the kitchen eating them before I could get them off the cookie sheet!!

A couple of tips about the dough -- let it warm up a little more and it should not be so crumbly.  When you cream together the sugar, butter and egg yolk, it has to be creamy or it will be crumbly (as with any recipe).

If it is still too crumbly, put a small bowl of milk out while you roll, dip your fingers in the milk and roll the balls.  That will moisten it a bit.

KUDOS on this recipe -- I'm off to make a few hundred more -- while my husband is at work!!

My grandmother made a cookie just like this when I was a child only she rolled them in chopped walnuts, so I did the same. After reading about other people's trouble with the dough, I was apprehensive. But, if you really cream the butter and sugar and egg until it becomes light and you add the flour mixture slowly, maybe 13 cup at a time waiting until it is integrated, the dough comes out much smoother and easier to work with. Thanks for the memories.

We loved these cookies! I had to make a second batch the very next day. The rich buttery flavor is addictive and they just disappeared off the plate. To solve the crumble factor mentioned before, I found that chilling the dough for 2 hours was too long and if you just chill it until it forms a ball without sticking to your hand they are very, very easy to make and roll in the almonds. The almonds should be chopped fairly finely. I used a blender and finished them off by hand. Really quick to put together when the dough isn't too cold. To fill the thumbprint, stir your jam and put into a small baggie. Cut a corner of the baggie off and use as a pastry bag. The cookies are filled in no time!    I'm definitely adding this recipe to my Christmas Cookie list.

Good cookies and look very pretty. I suggest you read reviewers' comments in the past carefully before trying out this recipe, especially the tips about how to manage this rather crumbly dough (creaming the dough until fluffy, and if necessary, dip your fingers in milk while shaping). I had quite a hard time shaping the dough because it was quite dry, but the dryness is necessary for the light texture of this cookie. Also, make individual cookie size as small as possible and round (do not flatten it) before baking, because they loosen flat a bit while baking. I will make them again for this Thanksgiving.

The origional Austrian recipe states to roll the cookies into beaten egg whites before rolling in the nuts. I substituted  almond extract for the vanilla and also used raspberry jam. The dough like others, was very dry and crumbly even after whipping the butter well. add 1 TBS milk at a time until you get the right consistancy. (I added 2 TBS of milk) and that did the trick. Dough was not sticky and easy to work with. these cookies are meant to be about "bite sized".

My family has made the same recipe for years with a couple of minor changes. Beat the unused egg white slightly then use to dip the balls of dough prior to rolling in the chopped nuts. This keeps the nuts stuck to the cookie. Press a slight indentation into the top then bake half way before adding the jam and returning to the oven. This keeps the jam a brighter red color but dries the jam just enough for cookies not to stick to each other when storing.

These cookies were the biggest hit at a house concert. They went like hot cakes! You gotta make 'em, but place cookie dough in refrigerator for 5-10 minutes before placing in oven as they will spread out and make a mess. I used parchment paper for easy cleanup, too. As others have suggested, I used the bottle cap to my vanilla to make the impressions, not my thumb. I accidentally overloaded the thumbprint area, but finally got the hang of how much jam to use. Also, I used two different jams, but the raspberry ones went first. Nothing was left and I only got one cookie!! Next time, I'm making a double batch and keeping some for myself.

One of my favorite cookie recipes. I didn't have any trouble with the dough, but like another reviewer suggested, I did beat my butter and sugar until light and fluffy. I also decided to add lemon juice and the zest to the dough which gave the cookie a wonderful light lemony flavor. Thank you!

I found the dough to be very hard but that was excellent for rolling into the chopped almonds as well as for it keeping its shape when baking. I really like these cookies (as did about 20 others) and they will be a part of our christmas baking for years to come!

Good recipe and very pretty when the almonds are on the outside. I did a mix of jam, chocolate, and without filling at all. The chocolate was the least favorite, but still gone by the end of the night.
I did not have a problem with the dough but did moisten my hands before working with it.

Good recipe, this was my 1st time making these type of cookies. I am a professional cook, but I am not a terrific baker. Luckily, these are foolproof with very fer ingredients. I made homemade jam a week ago so I used it & it was delish! I slightly under-baked them on purpose, and I did add more jam while they were cooling. I also made a batch in mini muffin pans as an experiment. Came out well too, just use more jam and let them cool completely before removing.

The recipe says it makes 3 dozen, but I only got 15 out of it. the cookies were decent. I like mine a little cakier so I put in the whole egg instead of just the yolk the second time I made them. The amout of butter in them was kind of disgusting to me. I think next time I'll just try a sugar cookie recipe and put the jam in the middle.

I was so excited to find this recipe.  I lost my family's original recipe when we were moving.  It is perfect and the cookies taste just like the recipe we used to have.  The only complaint I have is, they were all gone in a few days!  Thank you Carol, you saved our Christmas!

The dough is crumbly to work with, but once it warms up in your hands it is fine.  I am also crazy for jam cookies and this was my first time to bake them.  They did take longer than 20 min. to bake in my oven.  They look and taste great!

A good traditional cookie.  I made a batch with just egg yolk and one with the whole egg.  Didn't see any difference.  I also added a teaspoon of almond extract along with the vanilla.  A much better flavour I thought.   I had trouble getting the nuts to stick on the so I dipped the dough in egg white and milk first.

These get a 5 for taste. They're...not exactly difficult to make, but time-consuming. The dough doesn't want to form into balls--it's a shortbread dough, of course it doesn't want to form into balls! It took me an hour to form the dough into balls, poke a teeny tiny hole in it, carefully coax a tiny bit of orange marmalade into that hole, then arrange almonds on the thing. (I didn't roll mine in almonds--I bought the wrong kind of almonds. However, with that said, the reviewer who suggested rolling each ball in whipped egg white is probably spot on--that would help them hold together better and give it a lovely sparkle when it bakes up.) I might make them again, or then again, I might just go back to my usual shortbread jam sandwich cookies. It's a toss-up! Thanks for the recipe, they really are tasty--just a lot of work when compared to other methods of achieving the same thing.

Love this recipe!  I've made it several times and it's always a hit!  Sometimes I add almond extract instead of vanilla extract which gives it some extra almond kick.

This was a very tasty recipe. As usual I improvised a little. I found the dough was getting very heavy very fast so I used a tad less flour. To make up for it, I added the finely chopped nuts INTO the dough instead of rolling them on the outside. They got a little flatter than the ones in the picture but they were light, crispy and sinfully buttery. This is definitely going in my little book of favorite recipes.

though the end product is delicious, there's something wrong with the dough.  it was too dry and difficult to handle.  i suspect this is because there is not much liquid in the dough.  maybe i'll try these again and add 1/2 cup milk next time.

What did I do wrong???  The dough was grainy, like pie crust before you add the water.  Obviously no one else had this trouble.  Never got to try the cookies...

So simple! Shortbread like cookies. I didn't have any difficulties blending the flour with butter -had to be persistent until it became smooth. Refrigerating for one hour is long enough I believe. Substituted almond extract and reduced sugar cherry jam.

These cookies were awesome, only problems is that the dough is very crumbly and hard to work with, but worth the trouble, I am saving this as a family cookie recipe, they were the first batch to go out of all the Christmas cookies.

Very easy cookie. I added a dash of vanilla; which came out good.  Next time will try almond extract, or rum etc.. Give it plenty of space they spread.  Also I only got about 18 cookies out of 1 batch. I use a small scoup and split each in half. Save your egg whites if you think your dough is too dry, and add a little.  But it is a dry dough.  Make sure you really add your flour slowly. This would be a fun cookie to make with kids or elders in a group setting.

Mine were in the oven for 40+ minutes and some were still slightly underbaked. They tasted alright, but probably won't make them again.

Ok, first of all, should the butter be cold or room temperature? I used room temperature and the cookie dough wasn't crumbly at all or even difficult to manage. BUT I did find that it didn't make anywhere near 3 dozen cookies. I ended up with 18 or so small cookies, about .5" in diameter balls. Tastes ok, but not quite what I was looking for tonight. Might make again.

This recipe is awesome!  We've been testing recipes all week to surprise my mother with her favorite.  One of them ended us with one giant cookie!  Our first batch was rather large.  My advice would be to keep the cookie size to a minumum when inserting in the oven.  Great recipe!  Thank you so much!  I can't wait to see her face when she tries them!

I was happy to find this recipe.  They taste great.  I only gave it 4 stars because the dough is difficult to work.  Thanks to all who gave tips on this.  The milk works well.  I made these with a Texas twist by using local pecans and Texas Red Plum Jam.  About 15 years ago I made these and the jam caught fire in the oven.  We've called them cookies flambe ever since and they are a great family tradition.  Couldn't get to my recipe this year, and I like this one better.

A "bit" of milk on the fingers? I feel that I would have more luck makine pie crust out of this recipe than cookies. Granted, I have not tasted them yet, but they would have to be the best tasting cookies ever to be worth the trouble of trying to get the dough to form balls instead of crumbling away.

What appeared to look like a very easy recipe, was a little more challenging than anticipated. The dough was very dry and crumbly when following the recipe...I ended up adding a couple of extra tablespoons of butter to get it to hold together.  Also...I had trouble rolling the balls in the almonds and getting the nuts to stick.  They're baking in the oven now...so I haven't taste-tested them...but they look adorable!  I had to keep them in the oven longer than 20 mins also....more like 25 mins...but..it could be my oven :)

I was very excited to see this recipe since it is so festive and a diversion from chocolate. I  followed the recipe and ended up with a very stiff dough. I  almost just threw it out, since I  figured I must have done something wrong. I  let it warm up, had to paint each cookie disc in milk, dip it in ground nuts, and used strawberry rhubarb fruit spread for the dollop. I  give it four stars, but a basic thumbprint cookie is much easier to prepare.

Made exactly as directed, i had to look up specific directions on creaming butter and sugar. I used room temperature butter that i had left on counter for a few hours and i used a hand mixer on low speed for about 6 minutes -the butter/ sugar was fluffy. I used a small cookie scoop and cut each scoop in half. I then rolled cookie balls in egg white and then almonds and i used the end of a wooden spoon to make depressions. The only place i differed with recipe was to use a blueberry ginger jam that we bought on vacation. They came out fabulous! Made 56 cookies.

I really liked this cookie, it was good!  I did have trouble with the dough, it was very crumbly.  I should've read the previous reviews about whipping the sugar and butter mixture.  I also used the egg white as glue for the chopped almonds.  I only baked for 15 minutes, let cool and they were perfect.  Nice, golden,  and a little, crumbly.  I will make it again next time with a these modifications!

It's a cold and wintery night here, decided to make a new cookie. HOLY MOLY this recipe is delicious!!! It's so similar to those Knorr's shortbread jam filled cookies. The only adjustments I made, from reading reviews, I whipped and I mean WHIPPED UP the eggs butter and vanilla before slowly adding flour and also only chilled for 1 hour. They are moist and kept their shape very well. I baked them at 300 degrees for 15 mins. When I pulled them out they barely looked done, however, once cooled they are perfect! I also used homemade strawberry rhubarb jam, yum!

I've made this recipe for over 2 decades and it's the most inconsistent I have.  I always roll the dough into 24 balls before refrigerating, else it's identical.  Some years they come out as perfect little toasty almond bird nests, other years they splay out and the jam spills.  Just can't figure out what it'd take to perfect these.
Tasty, but unreliable for use in cookie swap.

Great recipe! I beat the wet ingredients for a good while and added the flour slowly, as suggested by previous reviewers, so the batter wasn't hard to roll. I used plum jam both times. I just veganized the recipe the first time with Earth Balance and a flax egg, and rolled them in sesame seeds instead of nuts. BUT THE SECOND TIME I made a few extra variations. I used 1 cup of whole wheat baking flour, and 1/2 cup of cacao powder (not cocoa, search cacao). I used almond extract instead of vanilla, and I rolled them in coconut flakes. I made half with plum jam and then other half is nutella whipped with coconut milk. Also, I dropped them by the tablespoon, and they held their shape, didn't spread much at all. This recipe is a winner, even withstanding my inevitable "this-is-what-I-got" substitutions. Everyone enjoy!

I have to agree with others that these cookies crumble apart upon baking.  I had no problem rolling them(although it was very labor intensive), so I thought they would turn out.  That did not happen.  They cracked and split upon baking and jam seeped out all over the cookie sheet and made a mess. Too bad, I was looking forward to these coming out :(

These cookies are absolutely delicious. However, I doubled the recipe thinking it would make 72 cookies and I ended up with 36. Perhaps I didn't make them small enough but any smaller and it wouldn't have been possible to do a thumbprint for the jam. Also, the amount of almonds it called for is way too much. I found I used a third of the amount of almonds as they dont stick to the dough as much as you might think. Finally, the amount of jam the recipe called for is too much as well. You can only put a little dabble of jam in each cookie. They are a bit of work to roll individually, but in the end they are very yummy and festive looking. I will certainly make these over and over!!!

This recipe disappointed me, I found the dough to be very dry and crumbly and didn't work well into balls. It is really to bad, could have been an excellent batch of cookies!

This recipe is great!!! The dough was a bit crumbly, but as other reviewers suggested, a bit of milk on the fingers when rolling does the trick!  Thankyou for a quick and easy thumbprint recipe!
