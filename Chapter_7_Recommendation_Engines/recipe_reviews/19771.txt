I love this recipe for Tofu Hummus and use it as my standard hummus base recipe; although I have to admit that as is it’s not quite right as is.  It has a bit too much lemon juice, it’s a bit sharp from the garlic (if you use fresh), and I find it needs salt and spices.  And as a traditionalist, I leave out the peanut butter and use tahini instead.  However, it’s a super starting point!  For classic hummus I add cumin, paprika, a pinch of salt and a bit of cayenne pepper.  My favorite is roast garlic hummus- double (or triple!) the amount of garlic and roast it carefully under the broiler first.  Also good adding green or black olives, roasted red peppers, or tabasco and crunch red onion.  Give this recipe a chance, just be prepared to add your own finishing touches to taste.

Tofu does give this hummus extra body and creaminess. I don't bother to tell people about the tofu and they never know. This recipe is extremely bland as is and everyone is right, there is way too much lemon. I used 2 cloves garlic, 2 tablespoons each of lemon juice, olive oil and tahini. I also added 1/4 teaspoon cumin, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a pinch of cayenne. Right before serving, I stir in a healthy amount of chopped cilantro. As is the recipe is about 2 stars, with changes, it bumps it up to a four.

I cut down the lemon juice and added sesame oil and cumin as suggested by others, and it turned out fabulous. I think I'll keep making this recipe but tweak it around a bit more.

I am sorry, this was terrible!  I am a big hummus fan, but this was not what I expected.  It was spicy (too much lemon juice), and needed something else (maybe salt).  I am giving it two stars because the texture was nice (thanks to the silken tofu).  I will use tofu in all of my hummus recipes now.

What I liked best about this recipe was the idea of replacing tahini with silken tofu.  I think if you ask 50 different cooks, you'll get 50 different variations on hummus, so I used the chickpea/tofu base and added my lemon juice, garlic, olive oil, paprika, cayenne and cumin to taste.  Not such a fan of the peanut butter but everything else was great!  I think I'll use tofu instead of tahini in my hummus from now on... thanks for the recipe & the great idea!

No, No, No, I'm sorry but this is just all wrong. I love hummus, but without the garbanzo beans and tahini, it just isn't hummus.

This recipe was very good. It could have used a little less peanut butter. I substitued regular peanut butter for lowfat. Also, if you let this sit for one day in the fridge it tastes better.

The tofu makes this hummus creamier than usual, but I think you may want to doll it up a bit with more spice--some cumin perhaps.

Definitely worth eating.  Serve with plain or toasted pita, makes a great appetizer or even a light main dish.  I like it better with crunchy peanut butter; gives it a little more texture

This was absolutely awful... I am sorry.  I tried this the other day, and it was the first time I had ever eaten tofu. My husband will eat anything so he ate it, but not the leftovers.  If anything, my husband found the whole experience extremely funny.

I was tempted to listen to all the "bad" reviews and change around all kinds of things, but then I decided to give it a go (almost) as it is, and it was FANTASTIC! The only changes I made was to add salt and pepper, use only 1 tablespoon of oil and add 30g sesame seeds because of their nutritional value.

Great recipe! I did not find there to be too much lemon juice or garlic, although the garlic did stand out a bit so if you are not a garlic lover like me you could probably use a little less. The lemon was perfect.

I really prefer the taste of tahini (traditional) over the peanut butter, but the addition of the tofu did give it a really silky texture.  The recipe calls for too much lemon, however, and unless you are looking specifically for a very lemony hummus, you might want to cut back on it.  I did this recipe as a part of the Western Region's Faceless Frenzy July 2012.
