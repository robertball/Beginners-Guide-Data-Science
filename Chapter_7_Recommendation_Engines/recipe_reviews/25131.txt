This sugar cookie is what the description claims it is. It is soft, puffs up, and has cake-like texture. I am giving it a five because I have tried over six different recipes in attempt to find one that would produce a puffy cookie similiar to the big thick sugar cookies commonly sold at grocercy store bakeries. While this cookie is a little lighter than the bakery cookie, it is very close. Also, the dough rolled out fine (it sat 2 hours in the freezer and I used plenty of flour to roll it out). After cutting out my cookies, I placed them in the freezer for an additional 7 minutes. They held their shape beautifully and had optimal height. Note: I did decrease the sour cream from 2 cups to 1 2/3 cups.

I've been looking for years for a recipe that comes close to one that my best friend's mom had when we were kids....and I finally found one!  These cookies are great!  Not for those who want a crisp hard cookie.  These are soft and fluffy.  Yes, the dough was a bit sticky, but I just made sure I had enough extra flour when rolling them out.  I also used only 1 2/3 c sour cream.  I made them a little thick, so that the kids could decorate them a little easier, and had to bake them a minute or two longer.  This will be a treasured treat in our family!

This recipe is GREAT! I made it for my son's 2nd birthday party as favors (Elmo cookies) and I can't even tell you how many people have gotten the recipe from me for these cookies.  They are incredible!  I agree with the other review that they are like those delicious bakery cookies.  I can't get enough of them!

FINALLY! This was exactly what I was looking for... puffy thick, but melt in your mouth soft.  Great flavor.  I used 1 2/3 C Sour Cream and cooked for 11 min.  I chilled dough for 1 1/5 hrs prior to rolling.  I also chilled cut outs for 7 minutes prior to cooking.  Roll out thick, use good amount of flour to roll. THANKS!

Very good cookies. I did add 2t. nutmeg and 1t. lemon juice to the dough to add flavor. I thought that the dough was easy to work with and I had no trouble  handling the dough with my hands. Everyone that had a cookie loved them. I frosted the cookies with buttercream and added sprinkles on top. They were a hit! Thanks.

I've been using this recipe for the past four years or so, with NOTHING but rave reviews! :) For those who are concerned with how the dough handles, simply refridgerating it elevates a lot of the stickiness when you first begin to handle it.   The flavor of the dough is perfect for me since I frost them. Which is what these cookies seem to be intended for; however, if you arnt a frosing person adding nutmeg cinnamon and lemon add great flavor also.

Wow - very soft and they stay that way!  These didn't last long in my house and I know it will be a recipe asked for often.  I teamed this cookie up with the Almond Butter Frosting - wow - delicious!

A mildly sweet cookie that is a twist between a biscuit and a pancake for texture and taste. (For this reason beware of overcooking. Best removed from oven when the bottoms are the faintest shade of golden. A little over 11 min worked for me.) 
I halved this recipe using the specified amount of sour cream, two eggs and the addition of a little nutmeg to avoid the blandness others commented on.
Rolled the dough out after standing in the refrigerator with some difficulty and a lot of flour--I found that after freezing it was far easier to work with and cut out nicely. 
By themselves they're an okay cookie, but a nice coat of icing makes all the difference in the world-delightful!

This is one of my favorite cookie recipes.  The cookies are always a big hit! The dough can be quite sticky and difficult to work with, but I have found that two clicks of a cookie press will make a good sized cookie in different shapes.  After two clicks, the dough needs to be pressed down a bit, because they puff during cooking. The last time that I made them, the baked cookies were sticking to the pan, so a little non-stick spray helped solve the problem. 

The only modification that I have made to the recipe is adding an extra cup of flour. This works everytime! :)

In a word: BLAND.  I will not use this recipe again. They are not horrid or inedible, and are definitely very cakey.  They puffed up a lot.  I read previous reviews - unfortunately after mixing the dough , but it did add fresh grated nutmeg to the multitude of flour (at least 1.5 cups) needed to incorporate during roll-out hoping to add some flavor.   Icing helped a bit, but this is still not the dense, chewy, flavorful sugar cookie I am looking for.  The search continues.

Fabulous cookie. Light and fluffy and not too sweet. I changed the servings to 24 and added about 3/4 of a cup of raisins. No need to ice with the raisns. They add just the right amont of sweetness.

I thought this recipe was just OK, I added a little cinnamon for flavor because others said it was a tad bland. It was not the best sugar cookie I have tasted and my kids each ate one and did not ask for another. Even as the cookies sat on the counter for a couple of days the kids did not ask for one. The dough was VERY STICKY even after chilling it overnight. I had to add an extra cup of flour just to be able to handle it, and used plenty more while rolling it out. They do have a cake like texture and they do puff up, the thicker the cookie the more it puffed. Like I said this recipe was ok but I will probably not use it again. I am on the search for one I like better.

Definately a cake like texture. Also very fragrant but needed icing. The dough was extremely soft and gooey. Needed lots of flour to try rolling them out. Not a recipe I would make again.

Has a nice light flavor and is fluffy, but is difficult to work with without using a lot of flour.  This was after being refrigerated for 24 hours.  Next time I will add additional flour when I make the recipe.  Does not break easily when decorated with icing.  Good lunch box cookie.

I just made these cookies, they taste good but were REALLY sticky, even after the chilling in the freezer. I ended up rolling it into a log and cutting them as icebox cookies. They were a little bland so if I make them next time I would add lemon as previously suggested. The one thing I did different was to mix icing sugar in with my flour when I rolled them out. This really helps cut through the flour taste. My boys enjoyed decorating them.

I lost an original recipe for this cookis and was glad to have found it again!!!!  I did add about another cup of flour to the recipe as this seems to make rolling a lot less messy as you do not have to add so much to the surface.  Will use this over and over!!!!!!  Thanks

It's true that these cookies are very soft, but they have no flavor at all.  Use a good frosting on them because it is the frosting that has to supply all the flavor.  I was able to cut out simple shapes (such as an ice cream cone), but the dough was too soft and gooey to use with narrow cookie cutters (like a cactus shape).  One good thing is that because the dough is so moist, you can keep working with the dough scraps again and again.  The cookies made with the scraps won't look perfect, of course, but they will still be soft.  However, I will be sticking with my regular sugar cookie recipe that actually makes tasty cookies.  If you want a puffy, super soft sugar cookie, this is the recipe for you.  If you want flavor, look elsewhere.

This dough is way too sticky! I tried adding extra flour but it doesn't work. I took the advice of others and used less sour cream but no matter what I did it's unworkable. It stuck to my counter. I chilled it over night.  Made no difference. This was a nightmare mess getting off my counter. I wouldn't recommend this recipe!

The cookies tasted fine when they were baked, but the dough was so sticky I had to wash my hands a million times. I let the dough chill in the freezer for 2.5 hours and tried it, very sticky, then put it in the fridge over night and still so darn sticky. Making Christmas cookies should be fun not this frustrating.

This cookie does have a fluffy texture, but is very bland. My little brothers loved it with a buttercream frosting.

The dough has too much baking powder, leaving both an unpleasant aftertaste and very puffy cookie.  It is also much too sticky to actually roll out, which doesn't matter since they puff too much to keep any shape.  The texture is gummy.  I don't recommend them.

Not a cut-out cookie!  Flavorful dough that was entirely too soft to roll, even after all day in the fridge.

This is absolutely the type of cookie I was looking for. Only change I made was adding a tad more flour and using 1/2 tsp almond extract and a 1/2 tsp vanilla extract.  

When I first put the dough together I really thought it was going to go wrong because it's a very sticky, loose dough. But when I make a recipe for the first time I try not to make major changes but I did feel it needed a tad more flour so I added another 2tbsp flour. Instead of refrigerating, I put the dough in the freezer for about 2 hours.  I was more than surprised that it came out the perfect texture and was very easy to roll out too. So please do not make the mistake of adding an extraordinary amount of extra flour.  This is probably why some are saying this is very biscuit-like.

After rolling and cutting, they baked up perfectly, rising just enough to make them cakey.  It's very hard to tell by looking that it is done baking so just set the timer for 10 minutes and trust it.  They will not look browned but that doesn't mean they aren't done.  As long at the tops are dry looking and look slightly "puffy" then they are done.

These are rather plain on their own so frosting is almost necessary.  I used a butter cream (3tbp butter, 1 tsp vanilla, ~3 tbsp milk, and powdered sugar to bind)  I whipped my frosting longer than I normally would because I wanted to create an airy frosting. In the end they were yummy and perfect!

On their own this is

Really like the recipe, and have used it a few times. A few things to note with my best batch, I did add a bit more flour and also used BUTTER FLAVORED shortening. Made a huge difference in the flavor. I could eat these without frosting all day.
