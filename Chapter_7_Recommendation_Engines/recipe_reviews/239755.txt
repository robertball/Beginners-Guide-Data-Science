I really like the flavor of this "bread".  The texture is pretty good.  It's moist and tender, with a surprising depth of flavor.  I added 1/3 cup each of dried cranberries and chopped walnuts, and I like the added punch.  Thanks for the idea!

I made this for The Paleo family members for Sunday Brunch.  I doubled and followed the recipe to the "T" with the only exception being I added walnuts and dried cranberries.  My bread was completely cooked at 55 minutes.  FYI for any other non Paleo person - The consistency of the dough/batter was significantly different then any recipe I have ever made.  It resembled something between a batter and a dough and honestly doubted that it would even cook up.  But it did and was a HUGE hit for all those Paleo - they commented on how deliciously moist the bread was - my husband and I thought it was quite dry but edible.   Can you tell we are not Paleo?

I followed the recipe exactly except for making muffins instead of a loaf - delicious! For muffins, use muffin liners and fill your muffin cups almost all the way as these rise very minimally. Also only bake for about half the time as for loaf or less (30 min). Very moist and flavorful. Perfect level of sweetness. The texture is not like normal quick breads made with grains, it's more moist and grainy (for lack of a better word haha). As long as that is ok with you (aka you're not trying to pass them off as regular muffins), the taste and presentation are great! My husband gave two thumbs up! Definitely will make again!

I think there is too much liquid as the pumpkin bread did not cook all the way through.  I baked it longer and still didn't work - soggy in the middle!  YUK!  I like the flavor but may add more coconut flour to absorb some of the liquid. Will try again!

After reading the reviews of the pumpkin bread having too much moisture, I have a fix I learned a long time ago from America's Test Kitchen.  It works! Line a sheet pan with 3 layers of paper towels.  With a spatula spread the canned pumpkin over the paper towels and top with 3 more layers of paper towels.  You will be amazed at the moisture that is released. AND the pumpkin does not stick to paper towels.
I also used an extra egg (5). In lieu of Pumpkin Pie Spice: 1-1/2 tsp ground ginger, 3 tsp Vietnamese cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp ground cloves, 1/4 tsp allspice.  I also added 1/2 cup chopped pecans and 2T honey.  Enjoy!

Followed the recipe exactly except for using brown rice syrup instead of maple syrup to keep the sugar (fructose) level low. Also made muffins instead of the loaf. Incredibly moist, delicious, and nutritious! Best Paleo (muffins) I've ever made! I added some chopped pecans for some extra protein. What a fabulous recipe! Thank you!

Very good, moist and cake like!  The pumpkin flavor was slight, not overwhelming.  I served it with whipped coconut cream and a sprinkling of chopped walnuts over the top.  Hubby loved it!  This will go into the rotation for sure!  Thanks so much for sharing!

This is my first paleo recipe to try.  It is very different in texture being more dense than I'm used to.  I cooked it for 55 minutes and it was perfect.  I served it warm for breakfast with fresh fruit. 

Now I've made this 2 more times with pecans sprinkled on top (I don't put any INside the bread) and I lined my baking dish with parchment paper.   I love the delicate flavor and light sweetness of this recipe.  I've decided that slicing the loaf down the middle first is the way to go because thicker slices in the cross direction don't fall apart like the thin slices done on my first loaf. Thanks for this delightful recipe.

This is one of my "go to" recipes in the fall when I'm craving everything pumpkin and want to eat healthy. I followed it exactly, except I had medium-large farm fresh eggs so I used 5, and it turned out perfect! Moist center with a crunchy crust and very flavorful.

Amazing, I am in love! I will be remaking and tweaking this recipe again and again. I added additional spices, as I love the nutmeg/clove/cinnamon to come across strongly. I also added espresso chocolate chips (clearly Iâ€™m not following the paleo diet! I just love almond flour) to make this a pumpkin latte loaf! Someone else mentioned in their comment that when working with coconut flour it is important to let it sit a bit to absorb some of the liquid, and I do believe this was the trick to this not being too moist. Between first incorporating the wet & dry ingredients and putting the loaf in the oven was a span of about 10 minutes. Even in my oven that regularly requires extra time to thoroughly cook everything, the toothpick came out dry after 60 minutes.

It was salty for my taste. Definitely a moist bread like everyone's been saying, but not moist like it was falling apart. I don't know if it was suppose to be salty, but I felt it was. Next time I will forgo adding salt and see if that changes it. I also added some chopped pecans to the top. It was a good addition. They did crisp a little in the oven, but they didn't taste charcoaled, so all is well. I'm definitely going to be making this again.

Good tasting option for a wheat free pumpkin bread.  I followed recipe exactly like it is written.  Turned out fine and baked 65minutes.

I also had an issue with it being so moist, it seemed like it would never be done! I was careful to melt the coconut oil because 5 T of solidified oil is about 6 T melted!!! I made that mistake in another recipe and it ruined it! Instead of the maple syrup, I used a tablespoon of powdered stevia and some honey, but I didn't measure it. It was probably 1/8-1/4 of a cup. I didn't add ANY liquid to make up for it, and was still so moist I had to keep baking it and baking it. It tasted great, though! My daughter loved it, and she normally won't eat gluten free baked goods that I make.

This was my first attempt at making Paleo bread. Once I got used to the different texture I found I loved the taste.  I am trying to build a collection of good gluten'free recipes and am excited to add this one to the "will definitely make again" list. It was moist with just the right amount of sweetness for me. I will also be trying more  Paleo recipes. Thank you for a successful first venture into that way of cooking. I made the recipe as is.

In an attempt to make this bread similar to the pumpkin bread I grew up on, I added 3/4 c. each of raisins and walnuts.  I made muffins and I am very pleased with them. Next time though, I will use 1 cup each of raisins and walnuts, and another teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice and make a loaf instead of muffins.   My daughter complained that they are not sweet enough so I may add some stevia next time.  Thanks for this great recipe!

I made this exactly except that I made this into banana bread by replacing pumpkin with 2 ripe, mashed bananas. The bread came out dense enough yet moist and delicious! I added a bunch of raisins and nuts as well. My fiancee raved about it as well, telling me that he's happy that it is not too sweet like most other breads of this nature. Next time I will try the canned pumpkin version!

Made these as Muffins with a couple of changes. I used Lakanto Golden Blend as sweetener as I can't have any sugar. Added 4 Oz applesauce to make up for the liquid, but will skip next time as they are too moist even after baking 50 minutes. I sprinkled rolled oats and chopped walnuts on top for texture. Taste was good and they look great. For person who followed recipe and they were too moist, one tip I have found working with coconut flour is that you really need to let it sit for a few minutes so that the coconut flour can absorb the liquid. Thanks for the recipe!

Only issue was that it was still slightly moist after 65 minutes. I will either do muffins next time or slice it and toast it right before serving.

Made it and loved it. The only change I made was that I added 70% dark chocolate chunks to the recipe....it is amazing!

I made this recipe into muffins instead of bread. Delicious, moist and I will make it again. I used a half cup chopped walnuts also.

This was pretty good, but it could have been a bit sweeter for my taste. I made a few changes due to my husband's coconut allergy; I used all almond flour and butter instead of coconut oil. Everything else was the same and I cooked it for 65 minutes. Next time ill add some stevia for more sweetness, but otherwise its pretty good and moist.

So I didn't have the correct flour, I used Tiger nut flour. I only had about a teaspoon of vanilla left in the cupboard. I added pecans.  Baked the muffins for about 20 mins. Oh, and I forgot the salt. They were great! My first time baking paleo "dessert".
I would do again and have all the ingredients on hand!

My daughter always calls me out for using nuts of any kind, or coconut (she says she hates both). She loved this bread, and everyone agreed it doesn't taste paleo. I did swap out agave syrup instead of maple syrup, but no other swaps-- super moist and delicious!

I forgot the coconut oil so I was worried about the final result, but it was delicious and a perfect consistency!  Light and fluffy...I'll be skipping the fat in this recipe from now on.  I made muffins instead of a loaf. I'm definitely going to try adding some maple extract next time, too.

Made a gluten free, almost paleo version with bananas instead of pumpkin and butter instead of coconut oil, 1/2 cup of tapioca flour because I came up short with the almond flour.  Made into cupcakes and sprayed the liners with oil as previous almond coconut cupcakes stick to the liners.. oh, and I used maple sugar 1/2 cup in place of syrup.. the bananas were very sweet and made up for using less sugar....  delish!  I am sure that the true recipe would be amazing as well and will make it for my sister in law who is paleo.  Let these cool off all the way and they will not be wet in the middle.. don't even cut one in half or the moisture escapes and it is not the same.  Cooked for aprox 30 minutes.

I really liked it. You have to get used to the consistency of coconut flour.  It is healthier and better for you. I may add walnuts next time. All is all very good.

I liked this bread, but don't expect this to be sweet. I loved the texture and crumb. My kids ate it with apple butter and/or cream cheese. Very nice and works for Gluten free people too.

This turned out very good. I reduced the pumpkin pie spice by 1 tsp. I baked it in a cast iron bread pan and the bottom started to burn a little but it did get done in the middle. I should have taken it out 5 minutes earlier. I will be making this again and it works great for the Paleo diet.
