As written this recipe is good. I thought it needed some kick. I made it in individual dishes and made some with jalape√±os and added some fresh onion. I left the original version for the kids seeing that it wasn't spicy. I added some onion and lime to the meat when cooked too.

Very simple recipe! I like the fact that it had meat in it. Many other recipes have beans and/or no meat I added sliced black olives to the top as well as some fresh tomatoes in addition to the salsa. Made it for New Years eve- it was a hit with both family and friends!

I made this for our Super Bowl party. It disappeared very quickly. I can t eat beans so it was nice to find a recipe like this without beans. The fresh lettuce made it nice and fresh. I made it with low-fat everything so it wasn t even bad for anyone. It s absolutely modifiable but it is fine as is. Thanks!

I really like this recipe! I used Pico Delgado instead of salsa but felt like it needed more cheese. Next time I'll get a bigger bag of cheese.
