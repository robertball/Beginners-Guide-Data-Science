These cookies are filled with so many different ingredients it's hard to tell what kind of cookie it is - but it doesn't really matter because they're just so good!  I used all vanilla and omitted that water, added 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon, used raisins instead of cranberries for half the batch (along with the walnuts) and for the other half I mixed in 1/2 c. of peanut butter and some chopped peanuts.  After they came out of the oven and cooled I drizzed all of them with melted chocolate.

WOW!!! I was so impressed with these cookies - I can't wait to make them again.  I did use pecans instead of walnuts, as that is what I had in the pantry.  Since my kids and husband don't care for dried cranberries, I made 1/2 batch without for them, then added them into the last 1/2 for me.  The ones without the cranberries were good (they are now gone thanks to my kids and husband), but the ones with the cranberries were outrageous.  Some of the best cookes I have had.  The flavors of the toffee, nuts, cranberries, chocolate work so well, and every bite has a different flavor in it.  Thanks so much for an awesome and different cookie recipe!

YUM! I couldn't stop eating these cookies. The toffee bits gave them a wonderful buttery flavor. I wouldn't have mixed chocolate chips with cranberries with toffee chips, but what a great combination. I will definitely make these again and again.

These are delicious cookies. I made them into balls about the size of walnuts before baking and didn't flatten them. I baked about 12 minutes and they came out perfectly moist and chewy with a thin crispy crust. Everyone loved them. I particularly liked that they didn't make dozens and dozens, as I find it tedious to bake batch after batch. Thanks!

Fabulous! The only problem was that the toffee bits melted and when they cooled they stick to the pan. To prevent this I put the toffee bits on top and they were just as good, if not better.

LOVED these.  I had a bunch of trail mix to use up so instead of the cranberries, walnuts, toffee and chocolate chips I put about a cup of trail mix (choc chips, nuts, cranberries and cherries) into the food processor to make them smaller (for my kids who don't like "chunks".  Then I added about a cup more of chocolate chips and about 1/2 cup chunky peanut butter.  They were awesome.  I loved the texture, chewy and delicious.  Take care not to bake them too much so they lose the chewy quality.  These are in my favorite pile now.  Yum.

These are super yummy!  However, I think that there's so much 'stuff' in them, that there doesn't seem to be enough dough.  Therefore, they always turn out very thin and crispy.  Maybe it's just me.  In any case, they're delicious!!!

These cookies are scrumptious and easy to make!  I wish I would have doubled the batch.  My chocoholic husband even liked them with the cranberries.  However, I put in only half the amount of the chocolate chips, cranberries, and toffee that the recipe called for.  I think they would have been way too sweet if I had put in the full amount.

Super good cookies...  I subbed margarine for the shortening and pecans for the walnuts.  They almost taste like a granola bar.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this as directed, but cut down a little on the add-ins (about 3/4 cup choc chips, 1/4 cup of a dried cherry berry blend, and not quite 1/2 cup of pecans instead of walnuts since that's what I had on hand and a little less than 1/2 cup toffee bits). I made a little less than 2 dozen cookies, shaping them into large walnut sized round balls before baking. They are chewy and crispy and very good! I would use the same amount of add-ins if I made these again - it was a good amount in my opinion, since we don't usually like a whole bunch of "extras" in our cookies, but the combinations of textures and flavors works great!

These cookies were awesome.  I had plenty to leave at home, and take some to work.  Everyone was satisfied and had a ton of people ask me for the recipe....for which I gave them the website :)

The cookies were pretty good.  I used bacon drippings since I did not have shortening and that was great.  I like the crandberries in it.

very good cookie, came out nice and chewy. i put cranberries and pecans in instead of all the other stuff. i can imagine any combination of fruits and nuts would be delicious. I made these again with cranberries, walnuts, and crystalized ginger. Also they are simple to make vegan!

Good flavor but came out very crispy. I only cooked 8 minutes but cookies were hard. I skipped the cranberries(kids would not like), but recipe has potential. May try again-thanks.

Yummy!  The semi-sweet chips and tart cranberries set off the sweetness of the dough nicely.  I made without the toffee because I didn't have any.  Still came out great and actually I think the toffee might make them too sweet.  Easy recipe didn't require any other tweaks.  If you like oatmeal type cookies, this is a fun and very tasty variety worth trying.
