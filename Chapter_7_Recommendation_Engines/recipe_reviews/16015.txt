A very good friend whose judgment I trust talked me into making these. I didn't tell her that I turned my nose up at the recipe when I read it. I didn't even like making these, and  looked forward even less to eating them. Imagine my taste buds' surprise to find they liked these!  Good flavor arises from the caramelization of the onions and brussels sprouts, the little bit of sugar is just enough to eliminate the bitterness brussels sprouts can have, and the roasted, salted pistachios I used were the perfect complement, both in taste and appearance. This just proves what moms like to say, that you should try something before you say you don't like it!

I like the idea behind this recipe, however adding the vinegar with the onions prevents carmelization.  Next time I'll carmelize the onions in butter and THEN add the vinegar.

We thought this was pretty good but the whole Brussels sprout did not have a lot of flavor.  I will make this again cutting the Brussels sprouts in half to absorb more flavors and add some garlic.

Wonderful and tasty.  I used 2 pounds of frozen baby brussels sprouts rather than the 4 pounds called for.  I also minced the onion and added 4 cloves of minced garlic.  I steamed the sprouts until soft and then let them sit a while before serving to absorb the flavors.  Got rave reviews.  Thank you.

these were fabulous... I used regular onions and cut the recipe down to about a third of the size (it was just me and my boyfriend eating). The only thing I would change the next time I make this is to break up the leaves, or even just cut the brussel sprouts in half. The middle did get a bit tender, but with not that much flavor. Opening the sprouts up will allow some of the delicious flavor to get to the center.

Extremely tasty, with no bitterness.  I use toasted pecans rather than pistachios, to remind me of a similar recipe I enjoyed at Stephen Pyles' Star Canyon restaurant in Dallas.

By far the best I've ever tasted, let alone prepared myself. I used maui sweet onion and pecans instead, because I didn't have red onion or pistachios. My husband even liked this recipe, and he usually hates brussel sprouts. Deeeelicious!

This was a little bit of work to prepare, but it tasted so great that it was worth it. We had it for Thanksgiving and it was by far the most commented on.

Eating them now! Sink full of dishes, stack of presents waiting to be wrapped, dining alone.... But I have brussels sprouts. Didn't take much time at all, and I didn't use any nuts but I'll try it with nuts next time. Cut the recipe way down for just me. So great! I actually like brussels sprouts and this recipe takes away any bitterness and leaves rich goodness. I cut them in half before blanching, which always adds flavor. I think the only time I use them whole is in a soup or stew. I also blanche instead of steam since it uses less hardware and takes some fuss out. Let the onions sautee in the butter a bit before adding the vinegar for better caramelization.

One word...YUMMMMMMM.  I don't like brussel sprouts cooked the traditional way - steamed with butter.  This recipe is so incredibly flavorful and my husband wants to know when I'll make it again.  This one's going in the cookbook to save!  :)  Thanks!

I love Brussels but didnt want the extra fat from butter. I thinly sliced the sprouts and added the pistachio nuts tossing in evoo lightly, seasoned with salt and pepper to taste.  Caramelized in oven on 425 until golden brown. Simple and less fat, the nuts really added a great flavor to this vegetable.

Served with Fooproof Rib roast and Cheesy Potatoes II (both recipes here) and it was the perfect side dish.  My family likes brussel sprouts, and really loved this version.  Only change was to use balsamic vinegar,  1/2 butter and 1/2 olive oi.  Used the olive oil because I like the flavor of olive oil with the onions and balsamic vinegar.

OH MY GOODNESS - these are amazing!!!  I started caramelizing the onions in butter with a little salt while steaming the sprouts, then threw the sprouts in as soon as they were done.  Took quite a bit longer to caramelize them but glad I waited to add vinegar & sugar because they were incredible like this!!!

Cliff notes: Too sweet, omit the sugar! This recipe was OK, I think with a few tweaks it could be way better.  

Here is my one disclaimer: I like Brussels Sprouts! I think that if you don't like them (or think you don't like them), this could be the right recipe for you; if you love them, it's not so great.

I made this recipe almost precisely as directed. I really enjoyed sweating down/partially caramelizing the onions with the butter and red wine vinegar and they added a great flavor to the dish! As other reviewers mentioned, not a lot of flavor was added to the actual Brussels, but I did chop them in half as other reviewers suggested (and as I usually do with Brussels) because it does help get more flavor into them. 

The element that I felt was unnecessary was the sugar. Brussels are naturally quite sweet once cooked down, and when I added the sugar, it was just way to sweet for my taste. Next time I might try with little to no sugar! 

Otherwise, a great base recipe that highlights the Brussels and adds some excellent complementary flavors with the red onions, red wine vinegar, and salty nuts!

very good, a different way to eat brussels sprouts.  i probably didn't steam the spouts long enough, so next time I will just a tad longer.  followed the recipe other than that and will make it again for sure!

I've made a variation of this recipe before. To improve it I created a pistachio dust by grinding the pistachios in a small coffee grinder. Additionally, I discarded the outer, course leaves of the sprouts and quartered them.  I applied the dust toward the end of the sauteeing process.  The dust, along with smaller size of the cut sprounts boosted the flavor wonderfully.

Excellent recipe.  I too subbed Balsamic for Red Wine--because that's all I had on hand--and I love Balsamic. I was going to leave out the pistachios because I was having trouble finding them; however, I finally found some overpriced ones, bought them anyway--and was glad that I did--gave it a great bit of extra texture.  One of my guests said he didn't like brussel sprouts, but thought these were great; I lost count of how many helpings he had.  This is an excellent holiday side dish.  Thanks

As BS's are one of my faves (and not of many others), I am always looking for new recipes to 'fool' them into thinking they may not be that bad. I really loved the flavor of the caramelized onions,  brussel sprouts, and vinegar together.  I thought it needed a little something extra, so I also added my other favorite thing (parm cheese).  Salty, sweet, and still (almost) healthy.  Three's a charm.

I was really skeptical about steaming my brussel sprouts since they are not my favorite vegetable and a good saute helps.  I was wrong.  These are awesome!  I didn't measure my pistachios but I feel quite sure that I added more than called for.  Do NOT leave them out.  They made the dish come together.  Both of my young children ate these without a single complaint and they are also hubby approved.  Oh, I also scaled the recipe back to two servings and it fed my family of four with plenty of leftovers so don't pay attention to the serving sizes posted.

I am eating these right now as I type and I have NEVER made fresh Brussells before and I picked these up @ Trader Joes they looked so good! Decided to use this recipe and I am very pleased! I scaled back the portion size and I think I could have added more onion (I think I simply did not add enough) and I added more vinegar. Really tasty and will make again. I made sure to really carmelize the sprouts so they looked like they were 'roasted' with a nice browned color. I did cut them in half after steaming before browning them so when they were carmelizing the flavors would soak into the open leaves of the veggie. Great!!

This is DELICIOUS! The directions are perfectly written. The only thing I did differently was to steam the sprouts in the microwave for 5 minutes, same results.  Best Brussels sprouts recipe I've ever tried!  Highly recommended.

This is a decent recipe for brussels sprouts - the sugar and vinegar really do serve to remove the bitterness, as other reviewers mentioned.  I substituted olive oil for butter and balsamic vinegar (double the amount suggested) for red wine vinegar.  Didn't have any pistachios on hand, but I added some garlic and green onion to give it an additional kick.  I sliced my sprouts in half and would shorten the amount of steaming time to 5 mins to retain more firmness.  I also squirted some lemon juice over the finished product, which added more brightness to the dish.

This was good, although I would suggest only using the smaller sprouts, when they are at their sweetest. I used a mixture of large and small and the carmelizing didnt get rid of the bitterness of the larger sprouts. Everyone liked this though, and I woudl probably make it again.

I am not a brussel sprouts fan, but because my son and husband love them, I am always looking for ways to make them that we can all enjoy.  This one was superb.  I followed one other reviewers advice and added the vinegar after all the veggies had carmelized, but other than that didn't change a thing. I had trouble keeping the boys out of the pan before I could even get them on the table.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Needs a little extra sauce in my opinion.  Delicious even though I didn't have pistachio's on hand.

Yum! Now this is the way to eat Brussels sprouts! I made the dish just as the recipe suggested and it turned out beautifully. So beautifully that I even made it again the next day. If you are serving Brussels sprouts for people you aren't sure will like the vegetable, this is a great dish to entice them.

I haven't reviewed this yet??? So far in life, this is my favorite way to prepare Brussels. I first made it for a party- HUGE hit. Then I made for Christmas with the family- another HUGE hit. My father was so skeptical! He thought he hated Brussels but this recipe will change anyone's mind. They're just so decadent. I could eat this dish all day long. I could go on and on about how much I love it, but I don't want to keep you.  If you made it this far down the review list, you're just wasting time that could be spent on cooking this awesome dish. So for fourth. Get cookin. Get eatin.

If you slice them for more flavor and use balsamic vinegar as suggested you get weird purply-brown veggies.  Not appealing.  Didn't like the recipe enough to go back and make it as originally listed so I can't give a rating but I can't post without one.

This is a great recipe, we will definetley make these again and again.  I did follow the adivce of another reviewer and not add the vinegar while carmelizing.  After I caramelized the sprouts and onions I added the vinegar and sugar to deglaze.

This was a great find.  It was a treat.  I had harvested a lot of sprouts this year and was trying to find somethign a little different.  I made it for a family get together and they all loved it.  I let the onions get a little more golden to the point of being crispt and added a clove of garlic toword the end to give it a great glarlic taste.

This is genuinely one of my favorite brussel sprouts recipes.  Everytime I am able to pick up a stalk of brussel sprouts, I will inevitably dedicate half the stalk to this recipe.  However, in my version of it, I skip the pistachios entirely and add about a tablespoon of Caldo de Pollo (Chicken Soup stock) powder for seasoning as I saute the brussel sprouts.  It gives the dish an added depth of flavor and pairs with the red wine vinegar quite well.

Great flavor in this dish. I cut the sprouts in half before steaming and I add the vinegar later as other reviews note it interferes with the caramelization process. I also cut the recipe in half to use as a side dish for a dinner of seven...

Everyone loved it. I had a tough time with the caramelization.  I cooked it on a low temp forever but it never seemed to actually caramelize.

These are pretty good, but it turns out 4 pounds is a LOT of Brussels sprouts!  Granted there were only 2 of us eating them, but we hardly made a dent.  I would say definitely more than 8 servings unless you're planning on this being the main/only dish!  I would make them again but only half the recipe.

I did like recipe and there were 2 thumbs up all around the table.  Not the usual reaction to brussel sprouts in my home.
Next time I make this I will use a yellow, not a red onion.  I will also try using balsamic, not red wine vinegar.
Like other reviewers, after steaming I cut the sprouts in half.

WOW!!!  I have never liked these little cabbages, but I tried this recipe and could have eaten the whole skillet!  I made them while my family was gone thinking the smell would fill the house, but that never happened.  I didn't have the red wine vinegar on hand so I subbed balsamic vinegar instead and couldn't find any pistachios in the house, but they were yummy even without them!  Don't fear these little cabbages anymore!  They will become a staple for me from now on.  It was hard for me to save some for my husband to try...he is completely against even tasting them.  I will post again and let you know how he liked them.

I liked this recipe! It tastes better than it smells though - I brought it to a potluck and the whole car had this odd smell, took us a minute to figure out what it was!  Honestly, I really liked it but the bowl wasn't exactly scraped clean at the family party, which I think is just because people just don't trust brussel sprouts!!

I've never wanted to cook brussel sprouts since they stink so bad...but cooking them this way makes a world of difference! They are very scrumptious and should be tried by everyone especially those who do not like brussel sprouts! These are not your grandma's boiled cabbages :)

Yum! These were delicious. I cut the recipe in half, used sweet yellow onion and no pistachios since I had none, and it turned out wonderfully. Sadly the rest of my family are not Brussels sprouts fans because I could eat these all the time.

Best brussel sprouts I ever had!  I also made it with the balsamic chicken on allrecipes. These sprouts taste more like red cabbage than just brussel sprouts! I did not add the nuts and less butter.

I was delighted to find such a good and easy recipe for brussel sprouts.  They are very healthy.  The nuts and carmelized onions worked perfectly together.  I waited to add the vinager until the end because I thought the onions would carmelize better.  I also took off the inside core of the sprout to get rid of the bitter taste.  The leaves tend to stay nice and sweet that way.

forget the turkey....THIS was the hit of Thanksgiving this year - no leftovers and everyone asked for the recipe!  I've never liked brussel sprouts, but I looooooved these.  I followed the recipe exactly, but next time I will try to cut the amount of butter and see if it turns out as good...

Yuuuummmmy! Brussel Sprouts aren't usually anyone's favourite but these are to die for. Add a dollup of sour cream when serving and you'll think of brussel sprouts in a new light.

DEEEEE-licious!  I sauteed some bacon and reserved 2Tbs of the drippings (and cut the butter back).  I also cut the sprouts in half before steaming and sauteeing and the flaver permeated all the way through.  Seriously good!

Delish!  The first time I made these I made them with the pistachios, the last three times I used toasted pine nuts, and like them equally as well.  This is the best way to eat brussels sprouts, takes the bitterness off and makes them interesting.

made these last night and they were terrific!!! changes were few; used olive oil/butter combo, balsamic instead of red wine vinegar, and pecans (that i toasted) instead of pistachios.  also, i used splenda brown sugar as that was the only sugar i had on hand. i also cut the sprouts in half.  these were so, so, sooo good. and super easy. can't wait to make them again.

As far as I'm concerned, this is THE only way to make brussels sprouts!  I didn't quite cook the sprouts long enough the first time I made them, so they didn't carmelize and absorb the flavor as well.  The second time I added a little bit of water to the pan after I carmelized the onions and added the brussel sprouts and let it all steam a bit together.  (And I had steam cooked the sprouts separately for longer before that.)  That time it was perfect because it sucked up the flavor.  I love the mixing of the slightly sweet and tangy sauce with the bitterness of the sprouts.  Delicious.

I love this recipe! I make the full fat version for holidays but when I am craving brussel sprouts and want something healthy, I omitt the butter and carmelize the onions in a covered pan and omitt the pistachios. It's really the onions, sugar and vinegar that give the sprouts all the flavor. I also cut in them in half so they absorb more.

I went with another review and used balsamic vinegar. Followed the recipe exactly besides that and these are AMAZING!! I've never liked brussel sprouts and I now crave these!! They are amazing!!  Be sure to cut the brussel sprouts in half once they are cooked - they are much better that way.

I've always hated brussel sprouts. This recipe sounded interesting however, and I'm now a convert! I made this as written, except I cut them in half after steaming them, and didn't add vinegar until after the brussels sprouts browned a bit. I added the pistachios to brown at the same time. I let everything rest (and soak up the sauce) while getting the rest of dinner ready.  DH said he could've skipped the main course and feasted on these. (Note to self: next time try using 1/2 evoo/1/2 butter and substituting balsamic for red wine vinegar.)  Fabulous!

I loved it but my husband couldn't get over brussels sprouts.  Used roasted pecans and really carmelized the onions.  The butter is a bit much so its not as healthy as you would think.

i couldnt find pistachios so used sliced almonds instead. this was just terrific! i planted brussels sprouts on a whim and they grew like crazy ... i had never cooked them b4 so this was a lifesaver. made for a dinner party and even the children liked them, although i admit to using more brown sugar than called for!

This brussel sprout recipe is to die for. The changes I made were to substitute maple syrup for the sugar and frozen pearl onions for the red onions. Also, I used toasted walnuts. I made this for Christmas and my daughter-in-law said it was like what you'd get served at a 5 star restaurant.

I've made this recipe twice now. The first time, I omitted the onions and substituted toasted almond slivers for the pistachios. The second time, I left in the onions but omitted the nuts and steamed the sprouts in the microwave instead of on the stovetop. Both times this dish has been FANTASTIC! This has quickly become my favorite way to serve Brussels sprouts.

Thanksgiving-worthy for sure. I made a few changes. As others suggested i cut the sprouts in half and I didn't add the vinegar until I'd sautéed the onions (added some garlic too) for at least 10 minutes. I subbed Vidalia onions as that's what I had. Also, I used about half the sugar. When the sprouts were steamed, I threw them in the pan with the sauce until carmelized. The pistachios were awesome. Thanks for the recipe

The first time I made it exactly as written except used pine nuts instead of pistachios.  It was awesome!  Then someone said they make their Brussel Sprouts with B-A-C-O-N!!!  I decided this would be a great addition!  So the 2nd time I fried 6 strips of bacon (don't get it too done) in the pan first, removed the bacon and cut into small pieces to add back in later.  Put the onions directly into the bacon grease that was in the pan.  Add extra butter or olive oil if necessary.  I then get the onions very close to carmelizing (which takes a while---probably 10 minutes) then add the Brussel Sprouts that have been steamed and cut into pieces the size of a large marble--large ones are quartered and smaller ones are halved.  Add the sugar and cook and stir every minute or so for about 5-7 minutes then add the nuts---the next few times I made it I used walnuts, but use whatever nuts you like.  They will toast in the pan.  You need to leave the heat turned to medium or just a tad over medium...too low and it won't carmelize and too high and it will burn.  Keep cooking until the Brussel Sprouts start to have some black on the loose leaves and the cut halves are turning brown.  This also takes a while --- 10-15 minutes for me.  Then put the cut up bacon back into the pan.  Stir occasionally for about 5 more minutes.  Drizzle with balsamic vinegar and salt and pepper to taste.  (Red wine vinegar is just fine too, but balsamic is a tad better.)  Be sure to cook LONG enough to get the ca

I thought these were okay. I had high hopes. I used others recommendation and did not add vinegar to onions, only after added sprouts. I found the brussels sprouts never really caramelized. Taste was decent, nothing special.

Never had brussel sprouts before and tried this recipe not bad. I didn't have red wine vinegar though  and use apple cider vinegar was kind of sweet and seemed to be missing something, probably goes well with steak.

I am rather amazed by this recipe.  I love Brussels sprouts, and I assumed I would enjoy this dish, but I was totally blown away by how flavorful these little heads of awesomeness were!  I have had Brussels sprouts prepared 6 ways from Sunday, and I daresay this is my new favorite.  And, I mean, there isn't even any bacon in these!!!  My daughter put a couple on her plate and bit into one on her way to sit down- she immediately did a U-turn and loaded up her plate with more.  I followed the recipe exactly, but halved it to serve 4...I think they would still be all gone had I made the full recipe.  Yum!  Thanks GODGIFU!  I can't wait to make this again!

Fantastic! I messed up a few things but it was really good. Like other reviewers said, don't add the vinegar right away, it will mess up the onions and they won't caramelize. Anyway, I had 1 lb of brussels sprouts, I only have earth balance spread because I don't buy dairy butter, and I only had apple cider vinegar. I didn't use much vinegar, as I was unsure about the substitution. I also maybe steamed the sprouts longer than I was supposed to. They were very tender. That's fine, I like them that way anyway. They were sweet and flavorful. What a win!

I couldn't get the brussels to caramelize even though I only put a bit of vinegar in. I will try this again and throw in all the vinegar right at the end. The flavours were good and the guests all took seconds :-)

Way to make brussels sprouts taste good! I tried to cut down the butter a bit, and it can be a bit vinegar-y in small batches if not careful. Overall great recipe though!

I really enjoyed this; the colors of the carmelized sprouts and the red onions are very eye-appealling.
My technique differed in these ways: 1) I first cut the sprouts in half. 2) I nuked the sprouts for a few minutes instead of steaming. 3) I cooked just the onions in the butter and when they started to brown, then I threw in the vinegar.
Otherwise I followed the recipe.

this wasn't for me.  I loved the pistacios and the carmelized onions and should have kept it at that instead of adding the vinegar.  Not a popular dish at my large family dinner.  Nothing wrong with the recipe, just not my taste.

These were delicious.  It got a thumbs up from my husband which is not easy when it comes to Brussels sprouts!
I followed other's advice and caramelized the onions before adding the red wine and I cut the sprouts in half before steaming.

The only other change I made was I substituted brown sugar for white.

Great base recipe!  I altered it by using sweet onions instead of red onions, balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar, and brown sugar instead of white sugar.  As the other reviews suggested, be sure to chop off the stems and instead of coursely chopping the sprouts, I just halved them all.  I don't have a steamer, so I just added two tablespoons of water in a pot with the sprouts set at just a little below medium to steam them (with the lid on until they were slightly tender), before sautéing them.  These alterations worked out great for me!  Will definitely make them again!

This was my first brussel sprout recipe and it was great. Added this to my Christmas Eve dinner served with beef tenderloin and roasted red potatoes. I steamed the brussel sprouts in advance to save time.

Very good recipe.  3 out of 4 family members ate them well.  (4 yr old was not swayed by the pistachios.)  This was Hubby's first time eating brussel sprouts and he had seconds.

SOOO GOOOD!!!!! I love brussels sprouts and this is my favorite way to eat them. We never have pistachios, and have used pecans, walnuts, cashews and peanuts as a subsitute...all have tasted great. Try this recipe -- you won't regret it!

Easy and tasty.  I took the suggestion of browning the onions before adding the vinegar.  I also used toasted pine nuts in place of the pistachios, as that's what I had on hand.

I cut the larger brussel sprouts in half to ensure even cooking. It also gave them more flavor. This is so yummy!!!  I can now say that I am a fan of brussels sprouts thanks to this recipe.

This is a great recipe for brussel sprouts. I cut the sprouts in half prior to adding to the onions and also added a bit more vinegar and sugar right before serving to suit our tastes. I will definitely be making this again and again!

This recipe is fantastic and definitely a keeper!  I love Brussels sprouts and usually just steam them and toss in butter, salt and pepper.  But my husband has never been crazy about them, so I decided to try something new to see if I could change his mind about Brussels sprouts.  And this was a big hit!  Even my toddler loved them.  I followed the recipe exactly, except that I used regular butter instead of unsalted, and I forgot to buy pecans, so I just left them out.  It is perfect as written.  Next time I'll try it with the pecans.

Haven't had brussel sprouts since I was a child, and the taste was not bad, but still bitter.  Not sure if I did everything right, but the pistachios didn't add anything.  They didn't adhere to the sprouts and they didn't seem to fit the recipe.  The carmelizing is an excellent way to make less bitter, but I still tasted the bitterness in the brussel sprouts.

I did some of the changes listed.  Used splenda brown sugar and olive oil instead of butter.  I also added the vinegar last.  It was very tasty.

These were good, but needed a bit more flavour.  I think I'll still hunt for another Brussels sprouts recipe.

This was my first time making brussels sprouts, and I may never make them any other way.  Instead of steaming I blanched them for a couple minutes first.  I also substituted balsamic vinegar, which helped bring out their nutty taste, and omitted the pistachios and still they were so good!  They went great with oven fried chicken and garlic mashed potatoes!

This is a great and creative way to make brussel sprouts. They were awesome and everyone at our dinner thought so, too! Definitely a great way to prepare this vegetable.

I followed this exactly but didn't use pistachios because I didn't have any.  I thought they were pretty good especially since I have never had brussel sprouts, however, I made them for a dinner and nobody commented on them--my husband liked them, so that's all that really matters.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very good recipe - I scaled it way down for only 8 (yes, only 8) whole sprouts.  Used a pat of butter, a dash of vinegar, 1/3 sweet yellow onion, a tsp of sugar, and 15 or 20 pistachios.  

As others have mentioned, I may slice the sprouts in half first before steaming so that they absorb the flavors while caramelizing.

No bitterness, nice texture, and still plenty sprout flavor - the good part of sprout flavor.

I followed this exactly as written (except halving the recipe). It really was quite good- no bitterness at all! If I made it again, I'd cut the sprouts in half after steaming/ before carmelizing, so more of the surface would be that delicious carmelized flavor.

If I could give this recipe 20 stars, I would.  AND, I don't like Brussels Sprouts!!  My husband made these one day, and I have asked him to make them at least 10 times since then.  I just love them!  He did change a few things, used Balsamic Vinegar rather than Red Wine (I don't keep Red Wine Vinegar in the house), and he doesn't like nuts in his food, so he left out the pistachios. But these are like CANDY!!  Great Recipe!

I had a bag of brussel sprouts that I needed to use up in my fridge, so I gave this recipe a try. I didn't have red onions, so I used yellow and I didn't have pistachios, so I used walnuts. I added the walnuts when the sprouts were nearly done so they were browned a bit too. I also used extra virgin olive oil with a bit of Earth Balance (vegan butter). I'm sure this would be divine with dairy butter, but I was eating it for lunch and wanted to keep it healthy and light. Despite all these substitutions I thought this dish was yummy and like some other reviewer mentioned it tastes like something you'd find at a restaurant. I do recommend cutting the sprouts in half. I found they absorbed the flavors better this way. I only cut the larger ones in half, but I think I will cut them all in half next time.

Delicious and different. I made for Thanksgiving last year and will make again this year. I made them the night before (added pistachios when served) and that helped the flavors blend.

I got my brussels sprout hater to say these were better than expected.  As someone who likes them, it didn't do too much for me.  The preparation does seem to mellow the taste somewhat, but don't be fooled into thinking that you are going to get brussels sprouts lovers from this dish.

I went ahead and gave this 5 stars, even though the version I served was 4.  Of course I am guilty here of not following the recipe as written and used balsamic vinegar instead of the red wine vinegar.  I also think I carmelized it a bit too much (if you know what I mean) still, the family gave it a thumbs up!

Excellent recipe!  Easy, delicious, and beautiful - persuades even the most skeptical of sprouts.  Don't overcook the sprouts - keep them bright green.  Will try to decrease the amount of butter - maybe replace at least partly with olive oil.

My husband and I loved this recipe!! As a child/teenager I hardly ever ate veggies and thought I hated Brussels sprouts. This recipe changed my mind! I didn't have pistachios on hand but it turned out awesome anyway. I can't believe my husband will be ASKING me to make Brussels sprouts now! He said this is a KEEPER!

My family liked it and I thought it was a nice change from the normal brussel sprouts in butter. I will steam the sprouts a little longer next time since I like them soft.  I'll make it again.

This was a good recipe for Brussels sprouts, and made a good side for the pistachio crusted rack of lamb recipe from this site.

These were good, but I found they needed less sugar and less vinegar than recommended.  I prefer a different flavor than the tangy vinegar, but they were definitely worth trying!

Loved it! I used a bit more vinegar than the recipe called for because I like it tangy. Took it to a potluck and had many compliments.

These Brussel Sprouts turned out really good, I had to cut back on the amount of onion because it isn’t good for my hubby and his acid reflex. Other than that they were great!

The recipe doesn't bother telling you to chop the bigger sprouts, even though the cover picture clearly shows some halved sprouts. I also think the onions would've caramelized better if I had waited until later to throw in the vinegar instead of at the beginning of the caramelization process like the recipe directs. Same with the sprouts. Other than that, this recipe was very tasty. For anyone wondering when their sprouts are done caramelizing... I would say that a nice brown color is key. If you have people who like soft, mushy sprouts, caramelize them more. Otherwise, they are done when the outside is brown. I'm also giving four stars because I actually love brussels sprouts, but don't think that this recipe makes them shine as much as some other recipes I've tried. Roasted sprouts are still my preference.

Per suggestions from others, I cut the the brussels sprouts in half or smaller so they could absorb more flavor.  I also added ~3 cloves of minced garlic (~1/2 tbsp).  However, there wasn't much flavor.  I tried to enhance with garlic powder, salt and pepper, but they were still just OK. Won't make again.

Made it for Thanksgiving last year and got rave reviews so I'm making it again this year. I'm working smarter this year and buying small sprouts that don't require being halved. I'm also using my microwave vegetable steamer.  Looking forward to enjoying this delicious dish in a few days!

The reason I only gave it 4 stars is because the 4 pounds of Brussel sprouts compared to butter and onions, seemed sooo outlandish, I didn't want to chance it.  But, I scaled it down to 1/2 pound size for 2 people and it was excellent flavor.

Fantastic.  Watch the steaming time-- mine were a little too cooked at 8 mins.  Should have done 6 & would have been perfect-- but it's still our favorite sprout recipe.  And EASY!

They didn't exactly "caramelize" as I'd expected but they were still good. The pistachios definitely make the dish.

This was a surprising dish, we really loved it!  In fact, one of my sisters threatened to eat it all if the third sister didn't arrive soon!  I had only white onions on hand, so I used those.  I also cut down the amount of onion.  I used pecans in place of the pistachios because that's what was in the house.  It's a pretty versatile dish.

A delicious way to have brussel sprouts! I used the large container they sell at BJ's and cut them in half before steaming for about 12 min. Then followed the recipe exactly. They were a hit with the whole family, even those who had never liked brussel sprouts.

Delicious!  Don't add vinegar until adding brussel sprouts.  I used 12 sprouts - use at least 20 next time.

Loved it, usually I find brussel sprouts a bit bitter, but this was good, the kids liked it too.  Used ingredients I would usually have in the house, and was quite quick.  I decreased the recipe by 1/4 and used a bag of frozen brussel sprouts, and it was plenty for four.

This recipe was a hit at my family thanksgiving dinner. I cut the brussel sprouts in half and it was delicious. I used a little less vinegar than what was called for but the general flavours were fantastic.

Bf liked these, although he commented that they weren't that caramelized.  I was a bit worried they'd get mushy if I sauteed them too long, which is why they weren't that caramelized, but he still liked them anyway.  I left out the onions (bf doesn't like them) and used bacon and garlic instead.  I also cut the vinegar in half since he's not a big fan.  This was a hit with those modifications for bf's taste.  Thanks for the recipe!

DELICOUS!!!!!  Forgot to add the pistachios, but without they are amazing.  So happy I found this recipe. I had  Brussel Sprouts for the first time from a deli and this recipe matches the taste I was looking for. I even like to eat them cold. Thanks.

I made this dish for two holiday parties, and it was a hit at both. I adjusted the serving size to 2-3 pounds of brussel sprouts. I trimmed the ends and cut the brussel sprouts in half before steaming. Great recipe; thanks!

This was the first time I've made brussels sprouts and I really liked them thanks to the flavors in this recipe.  I didn't have pistachios on hand, and it was great without -- though I'm looking forward to adding them in next time.  Thanks!

I seriously LOVE this. Like someone had said before I carmelized the onions in the butter first than added the wine vinegar. I will make this over and over again. I didn't think I would ever scout out Brussel sprouts in the grocery store but now I definatly will!

these were wonderful!!! I used another one suggestion and used toasted pine nuts.  I cut sprouts in half and steamed then carmelized with butter. added the vinegar and sugar at the end. I cant say enough about this wonderful recipe.

I made this recipe for my boyfriend and I...both of us like Brussels Sprouts so I figured it would be a safe bet.  We both LOVED it!!!  The caramelizing really helped to mellow out the Brussels sprouts natural bitterness.  The only change I made was to use 1/2 of the butter in the recipe, and I added 1 clove of garlic.  Be sure to take your time caramelizing the onions and keep the heat low...I think I let them cook 15-20 minutes before I was happy with them.  Both my boyfriend and I think this is DEFINITELY a keeper!!

Very good.  I didn't have any pistachios so I just chopped some walnuts and added those.  Very tasty.  I'll probably have this again.

Carmelized....not quite.  Good...yes very.  This was a good change from regular brussells sprouts.  The recipe calls for a deep pot to cook it in, however, I will try out my wok next time I make it.

Used fresh picked brussel sprouts from the garden. Husband really liked the pistachios and onions which is odd because he's not a big nut mixed with food kind of fan. Served with pork chops, brown sugar carrots, and "Cream Corn Like No Other."

Excellent! Made with walnuts and still great.  The brussel sprouts didn't carmelize so next time, I'll try it by adding the vinegar at the end like other reviewers have suggested.

I didn't have enough red onion so I used white as well. I also toasted the pistachios before sprinkling them on top. My husband and I liked this side dish very much. We're also both onion lovers and thought they were fantastic! I'd add even more next time.

I sliced my sprouts in half and steamed them for longer than suggested as I enjoy them a bit more tender. Loved the idea of the nuts, however, all I had was walnuts which I toasted first. We love our brussel sprouts and thought this dish was wonderful! Thank you!

I will definitely try these again, after reading all the reviews for extra tips. I will cut them in half before adding to the onions. Someone said that vinegar interrupts the carmelization, which cleared up why mine didn't carmelize. All in all, a good flavor.... I just need to tweak it a bit. Thanks!

Perfect.  I made this on Thanksgiving, and there was hardly and left by the time it made it to the table.  I am remaking tomorrow, but using a little less butter (not for taste, but for health). I would suggest using a little bit less, because it is a little on the greasy side.

Made this a second time, if I was to do this again I would cut the brussels sprouts up to absorb more flavor.  //11/28/2008 I love brussels sprouts

I haven't had brussels sprouts since I was a kid and my mom served mushy, frozen sprouts (well, she cooked them...they weren't frozen when I ate them!) Like any kid, I hated them.
The other day, I passed a bin of fresh sprouts in my grocery store for a price I couldn't pass up in this economy. I was nervous, but I think they just became one of my favorite vegetables! I understeamed them a little, probably steaming them for only 6 or 7 minutes. That left the inside a little crisp. Also, I saved the calories on the pistachios. I used shallots instead of onions, and those got crispy enough for a contrast in texture. I ate the leftovers for lunch today, and they were just as good reheated in the microwave as they were out of the pan. I don't think you need as much butter as this recipe calls for, though. I used a bit less and it was perfect.
Great recipe!

Not crazy about Brussels Sprouts but my girlfriend likes them. Made no change to the recipe and they were about as good as Brussel Sprouts could be. Tasty, mix with onions was very nice. Loved it!

I was skeptical about the onions because I dislike onions. But the caramelized onions really add a sweet flavor, which makes this dish yummy. (I used vidalia onions.)

Took some time and effort, but real good. Serious tip: If you use frozen sprouts, only use 2 lbs. We had way too many and it also diluted the flavor. I was picking through mounds of sprout looking for the "goodies".

This was pretty good and a nice way to sneak some brussels sprouts on everyone.  I think I didn't cook everything long enough because the sweetness was very uneven - sweet in some spots, but still a bit bitter in others.  We also used pecans instead of pistachios, because that's what we had.

Have enjoyed this recipe several times. Two variations others may enjoy: Don't use the vinegar twice - just add the first 3 T to the onions - the tartness of the onions then balances nicely with the Brussels sprouts and nuts. Have also added steamed bell peppers and carrots to the sprouts and found that these three vegetables work nicely together.

Fantastic recipe!!!
i made this with dinner tonight. i used a 16oz bag of frozen brussel sprouts instead since it was on hand, and adjusted the measurements. 
did not have pistachios, i used chopped slivered almonds instead.
awesome! i like brussel sprouts and their nutritional value, but always have had a hard time finding nice ways to prepare them. thanks a bunch for the recipe, even my two year old loved this dish! it's going straight into my box!

The grocer was out of fresh brussel sprouts so I used frozen and this dish still came out so delicious. I substituted brown sugar instead of white and really caramelized the red onions so they were unbelievably sweet. Everyone raved about how great the sprouts were! This is definitely a keeper!

Very tasty! I used 2 lbs of fresh baby brussel sprouts cut in half, 1/2 stick of unsalted butter, 1 red onion and didnt have any red wine vinegar so I used rice wine vinegar. I usually am not a big brussel sprouts fan, but these are really really tasty and I loved them!

this is my new favorite snack!  I use balsamic vinegar since that's what I have around and cut the brussels sprouts in half so they get more carmelization.  red onions if I have them, otherwise white or yellow taste just as good.  and I have never even added the pistachios, they're so good without!

Two words - yum my. Nuts would have been a nice addition, but are not necessary. I was making only for myself, so I had to eyeball the measurements, and used brown sugar instead. Came out great.

Me and my boyfriend (who like brussels anyways) absolutely loved this recipe.  I don't want them any other way.  So robust and full of flavor.  I did take others advice and halved the sprouts.  WONDERFUL.

These were a hit at Thanksgiving dinner (well, as much of a hit as Brussel Sprouts can be!).  I followed the recipe with the exception on halving the sprouts.  The only draw back was that it was not the prettiest dish on the table.  (I think next time I might use frozen sprouts - it was sort of a pain to peel off the outer layers to clean)

The onions were great, but my brussel sprouts didn't pick up much flavor when I mixed them in, maybe I didn't cook them long enough.
