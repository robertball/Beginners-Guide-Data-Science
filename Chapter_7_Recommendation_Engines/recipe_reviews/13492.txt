Very good, however I sauteed pearl onions and the mushrooms in olive oil.  I also reduced the amount of wine to an 1/8 cup which I then reduced in the same pan as the onions and mushrooms.  I added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and 1 tsp of cinnamon.  A pinch of salt to enhance the sweetness.    It's a nice side or topping.  If you don't care for the sweetness of white, then use red.  This recipe is definitely for sophisticated taste buds.

We were not very fond of these, perhaps a little too sweet for us even though we reduced the amount of nutmeg to half. Will not be making these again, the leftover mushrooms when drained from the sauce did make good compost though.

This dish was pretty awful.  I made it on Thanksgiving Day, figuring it seemed very simple to do yet it sounds delicious.   - it never made it to the table!

I was curious. I tried. The submitter said to adjust seasonings to taste, so I made a judgement call. I'm sorry, but a tablespoon of nutmeg would have been ridiculously too much. I sprinkled a pinch over the mushrooms. First off, I did saute the mushrooms in a bit of olive oil & butter, then I used a California Chardonnay to deglaze the pan. With my modifications to the recipe, I would give this recipe 4 stars, as written, I would have given this recipe 1 star, so I split the difference.

Thank goodness we had other vegetable sides for Thanksgiving dinner.  Waaaay too much nutmeg would have been better.  We are pretty adventurous when it comes to trying new recipes, but this was too much even for us.  I was thankful that I had already established my mother-in-law cooking credentials.

I agree with what others said - this was a pretty awful-tasting recipe.
I didn't throw it out, since I hate to waste food, but it was an ordeal to finish it.
It's surprising how three good-tasting ingredients combine to make something that tastes so bad.
I was thinking that maybe the choice of wine (I used a California chardonnay) made a difference, but I doubt it. Even The Woman I Love, who says she LOVES nutmeg, didn't even want to hear any more about this recipe once I mentioned it. Sorry, I did not like this at all.

I liked the recipe a lot, I've just had better mushroom dishes. I think it would be a lot better if the mushrooms had been marinated in the wine. Not a bad side dish to throw in to the mix of thanksgiving dinner. Fast and pleasing to the eye

It was delicious. No changes. I think it would be a great dish for Thanksgiving.    I also appreciate the fact that this was very low fat.

This was just ok for us. I agree with the others that said the smell was pretty harsh. I halved the recipe and just sprinkled a little nutmeg. They weren't inedible, but I most likely wouldn't make them again.
