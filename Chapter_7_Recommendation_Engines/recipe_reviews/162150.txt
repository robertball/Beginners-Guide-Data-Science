Wonderful cookies.  After reading other reviews I made them large since they were so soft and didn't spread.  I froze them and pulled them out a couple at a time to thaw for a nice snack for about 3 weeks and they were just as good.  The icing makes it.

My Mom used to make these all the time when I was growing up.  They were great.  I made some the other day and they were still good.  I don't remember my Mom adding coconut though.  They don't spread very much and are soft and tasty.

Very yummy. I did slight modifications though, added 1.5 T of cinnamon, plus about a teaspoon of coconut extract to the cookie batter. I followed the directions for the frosting but then found it not quite the desired consistency so I did add an additional 2 tablespoons of orange juice. They were very soft and cake like, and the frosting added just the extra sweetness they need to be delish.

I always hesitate to rate recipes that I've altered... but I also want to help others by noting changes I made and results. Since coconut is the new miracle food, I used 1/4 C coconut flour (the fiber in it is supposed to be especially good for your digestive system) + 1.75 C gluten-free flour. I used 1/2 C butter and 1/2 C coconut oil (since coconut oil is supposed to be really good for your brain cells and I need all the help I can get). I boiled three medium carrots, figuring they'd easily make 1 C once mashed -- they only made 3/4 C, so I was a little short on the carrots. Finally, I reduced the coconut to 1/4 C because I was afraid that with the changes I'd made, the coconut flavor would be overwhelming if I didn't. The cookies were really good; light and cakey. Hubby loves them and told me he wants me to make them again.
