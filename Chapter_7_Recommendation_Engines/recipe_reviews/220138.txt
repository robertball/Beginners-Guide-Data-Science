This pie is FABULOUS! I made my own crust. You only need 2 cups of the sliced berries for it to be perfect! Thank You for sharing!

I have been making this for YEARS and it is always wonderful.  You can substitute the strawberries for peaches or raspberries or blackberries or blueberries or a mixture of any of these and change to the appropriate gelatin depending on what is in season.  You can even use canned fruit (think mandarin oranges or pineapple).  If you need it sugar free for a diabetic, splenda works very well, as does sugar free gelatin, but be careful measuring it because there is less of it (takes about half a package for one pie).  I have even made it once with chopped cranberries sweetened with splenda in place of the berries and a bit of grated orange peel in the cheesecake part for a Thanksgiving or Christmas dessert...  Splenda can make it sugar free quite well!  It's very versatile and no one ever believes it is so easy to make.  Use a graham cracker crust if you MUST, but a real deep dish pie crust is best!  YUMMY!!!

Made tonight and served to our neighbors.  I made exactly as stated, no revisions.  Everyone loved it, my neighbors wife wanted the recipe.  Said it tasted like a cheesecake that you baked for hours.  I said no just 30 minutes!   Very easy. Will definitely make again!

I haven't tasted it yet, but all the parts individually taste fantastic! I am concerned though, as there is *so much* of the cream cheese mixture that the pie crust without any berries is already full! I will barely get one thin layer of berry slices on top, and then I am worried that the glaze mixture will run off the edges! This must be for a very deep pie crust, not a pre-made frozen Tenderflake.

This turned out so delicious!  My boyfriend was raving about how good it was.  The only change I made was that I used a graham cracker crust instead of a regular pie crust.  Cheesecake always needs a graham cracker crust!  I was unsure about how the strawberry glaze was going to be but it was fine!  I will make this again, and soon!  One important discovery, now that I have made this several times.  I couldn't figure out why the cheesecake filling was coming out lumpy.  I figured out that you have to beat the softened cream cheese (I softened it on low in the microwave) and the sugar together FIRST before you add the lemon juice and the eggs.  Otherwise you get lumpy bits of cream cheese  in your filling, instead of it being a nice, smooth, creamy filling.

I made this recipe for our family's Canada Day BBQ. I used a pre-made Pillsbury fresh pie crust in a 9 inch deep dish glass pyrex pie plate. I whipped the cream cheese with only 1/4 cup of sugar, and added 1/2 tsp of vanilla to the batter. I cut my strawberries in quarters and mixed in the glaze then spread the strawberry mixture over the chilled baked pie. It was very good and we all really enjoyed it. Will make again.

This is really good, easy, and I will definitely make it again.  It was a little too sweet for my taste and I will be cutting back on the sugar used in the topping next time.

I didnâ€™t make the topping, I used a different recipe for that. However, the cheesecake was fantastic!!! I will definitely use this recipe again for any cheesecake filling.

Made this but used juice instead of water to cornstarch for an extra layer of flavor. Also use this with peach and peach jello. Most of time use sugar free jello. This is a great hot weather dessert enjoyed by all!

This was good... not great. It just made us want cheesecake. The filling amount didn't seem off as other reviewers suggested. A deep dish pie pan is required. I was not a fan of the strawberry glaze. I was just disappointed by the outcome. It seemed like it would be so good, but fell flat.

All and all, the pies were a success. I say pies because this recipe is evidently intended for two deep dish 9" pre-made pie shells. As another expressed, I felt there was an over abundance of cream cheese filling for one pie, so I instead made two. And I'm glad I did because they were great!

This pie is amazing! I used fat free cream cheese and didn't use as much strawberries as this recipe called for. Also, instead of letting the jello mixture cool a bit I poured it over the strawberries hot so it softened the strawberries a bit. It turned out wonderful! This is a definite keeper for our family recipes! Thanks for sharing!

I made this cheesecake for Valentine's Day because strawberry cheesecake is my boyfriend's favorite dessert.  It was not a hit...in fact he didnt even finish his piece....  The one thing positive I can say about this cheesecake is it looked scrumptous!  The cheesecake itself had a weird texture and was bland...it just wasn't creamy enough.  We definitely prefer graham cracker crusts and the Jell-o on top was a little too much...everyonce and a while you'd get some that was all jello and no strawberry and it wasn't pleasant.    All in all a Valentine's Day flop!
