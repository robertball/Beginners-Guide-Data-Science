Love this recipe, got it from a friend last year, with these differences (1) use milk instead of mayonnaise; (2) add 1 tsp. garlic powder; (3) add 1/2 - 1 tsp. curry powder (husband & I like more, daughter less, so I use no more than 1/2 tsp.); (4) bake 20 mins., sprinkle lightly with dry bread crumbs, bake 10 mins. more. I use 98% fatfree soups and skim milk. Good with noodles or rice.

This is an awesome recipe with modifications.  For those that said it lacked flavor, add 1/2 teaspoon curry and an extra teaspoon of lemon juice.  I also use more chicken, only 1/2 cup shredded cheddar which is cooked with the rest of the sauce ingredients until cheese is melted, then poured over cooked chicken, and steamed broccoli (make sure to pat with paper towels), and sprinkled with a bread crumb mixture of 2 tbsp. melted butter and 1/2 c. bread crumbs.  WONDERFUL!  This is excellent with Uncle Ben's Long Grain and Wild Rice mix - originaly recipe, served on the side.

Wow...this dish caused the biggest reaction I have ever had about dinner from my husband! He loved it. I thought it was great too...Definately a keeper. I did use 2 cans of cream of chicken instead of the cream of mushroom...no mushroom lovers in our house...thanks for a great and easy recipe!! p.s. have made this many times since, now I just use fresh broccoli, not frozen. Cooks fine, so no need to precook.

Oh my gosh! This was outstanding! I used uncooked chicken. Used large frozen broccoli flowers. Chopped up my raw chicken breast and put on top. I added about 1/4 cup cheese to soup mixture and added pepper to taste. Baked about 35-40 minutes,then topped with the cheese and baked 10 minutes more. Chicken was so tender. Served over rice. This was so fast to prepare and delish! My family went crazy over this. Thanks so much Shannon!!

I absolutely love this recipe, I have basicly used this recipe years. I use a topping of mozzerella and add herbed breadcrumbs and butter for a golden topping, and my niece and nephew love it!

This was delicious, but a bit on the salty side even though I used reduced sodium soups. I think this would be outstanding if you were to place the broccoli and chicken on a bed of wild rice, then pour the soup mixture and cheese over it. I know that Chicken Divan does not have rice in it, but the rice would add a nice nutty texture and flavor, while absorbing some of the excess salt. Thanks Shannon.

Mediocre at best. Canned soup in the sauce gives this an artificial taste. I'll do the the work and make the "old fashioned" recipe, which is delicious.

Excellent flavor.  You need to serve over rice or noodles to soak up some of the liquid.  I added a little curry for a different flavor.

This recipe was a HUGE hit with some alterations as per the other reviews.  I used milk instead of mayo, and 2 cans of cream of chicken instead of 1 chicken and 1 mushroom.  I put 1 3/4 cups of cheese in the soup mixture, along with more milk to aid the consistency.  I omitted the lemon juice entirely and used 1/2 tsp. garlic powder, 1/2 tsp. curry powder, and 1/2 tsp. minced onion.  I then sprinkled more cheese on top and baked.  It took about an hour to bake.  About halfway through,  I sprinkled melted butter and bread crumbs lightly on top.  During the last 10 minutes I raised the heat to 400, which browned the top nicely.  It was great over a side of broccoli cheese flavored rice!

Delicious stove top version: 
Squirt of olive oil in heavy skillet with lid.
Add leftover rotisserie chicken chunks and leftover broccoli florets. Consult recipe for amount.
Mix low-sodium soups, lemon juice, small amt mayo together and add to skillet. Stir.
Put the lid on and allow to heat slowly.
Sprinkle shredded cheddar on top. Top with lid.
As soon as the cheese melts, it's ready to eat.
Very quick, delicious.

I changed a few things, I used 2 cans of the cream of chicken soup (my husband doesn't care for cream of mushroom), I shredded the chicken breast instead of chopped, added 1/4 cup milk ,divided the cheese and added a layer on top of the chicken,  a touch of garlic powder, crushed croutons drizzled with butter as a topping and served it on top of egg noodles. I turned out great!! Very easy to make and both my husband and 4 yr old loved it. I will definitely be making this again, next time I think I'll try it with a touch of curry powder, it sounds yummy!

I have been making this dish for probably 20 years.  Little kids who don't like broccoli, we usually make half with broccoli and half with frozen peas (if you use clear glass dish you can see which end is which).  Also, if you add small cubes of bread (1/4" square) on top of the cheese, there is no grease buildup, the bread soaks it up and then cooks crispy and is a great addition.

This recipe was good, however I did add and change a few things.  For one, I mixed all the ingredients together in a large mixing bowl - there was no layering.  Secondly, I used two cans of cream of chicken soup. Third, I sauteed one finely chopped onion and a whole container of fresh mushrooms (sliced) in 2 tablespoons butter, and added that to the bowl.  Fourth, I added a generous sprinkle of pepper and as per others' suggestions, I added 1 tsp. curry powder, 1 tsp. garlic powder, and increased the lemon juice.  Fifth, instead of mayo I used heavy cream.  Sixth, I used shredded mont. jack and increased the amount.  Seventh I added parmesan cheese to the mixture.  Also as per other reviews, I baked for 30 min., sprinkled with bread crumbs and then baked another 10.  I served it all over white rice.  Very good!!

The next time you have leftover chicken, try it! A little side note, try the cond cream of mushroom soup with the garlic.

Okay....this didn't look very appealing when it was all in the pan, but it was very good! What's better....the WHOLE family liked it! Rather than cooking the chicken first, I cubed it raw, and cooked the whole dish for about 20 minutes longer. I didn't add the cheese until about 30 minutes before I thought it would be done. Since I wanted to serve it with rice, I also thinned the sauce with a little milk, so it would soak right in. Yum!

Exceptional recipe! I lightened it up by using 98% FF mushroom & chicken soups, 1/3 c. cheese, 2TBSP Light Miracle Whip, and 4 pks of broccoli! Also, I added fresh chopped mushrooms and julienned carrots for more bulk. My family loved it! This tastes especially great over whole wheat rotini pasta or brown rice!

This recipe was fantastic.  We changed it slightly by crushing one sleeve of Ritz crackers, mixing with some melted butter and sprinkling this over the top of the casserole half way through the cooking.  Also, we used fresh broccoli instead of frozen.

Chicken Divan was a staple recipe in my house growing up. However, ours included rice and french fried onions, both of which are key ingredients to complete the meal. Also, we omitted the mayonnaise for a healthier option and it is delicious.

I prepared this for 164 people, with help from the women's guild at my church, for a fund raiser lunch after worship last April.  It was a giant hit.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  We're making it again this week for another fundraiser and people can't wait to sign up.

I thought this was great, easy and the kids liked it. Next time I'll serve it with noodles or rice. Actually, either one could be added in before baking.

I made this with leftover chicken, and it really wasn't a bad "casserole" dish!  Served over pasta (I like it better over rice), and will keep it in my box for an EASY leftover solution.

A friend of mine made this version of chicken divan years ago and I absolutely loved it. I'm so happy to have found it again. The mayo makes it nice and creamy and the lemon adds a delicious touch!

This is a fanstastic recipe, especially around the holidays, as it puts that leftover turkey to good use!!  Very quick and easy and more importantly delicious!! I added a tsp of curry to the soup/mayo mixture and 1/2 c. of breadcrumbs to the top w/ the cheese and this was perfect!! My husband and his roomate raved and went back for thirds!

This was really good.  I halved the receipe, so I just used cream of mushroom soup (healthy choice stuff) and because I was short on time I used a 12 oz can of chicken breast.  I only used about 2T of lowfat Mayo and a 3 cheese blend I had.  This receipe is real easy to adapt to ingredients you have on hand. My husband really liked it so I will be making often.  Thanks.

This recipe is terrific!  I served this last night and everyone enjoyed it, even my picky children.  My 4 year old, who hates anything saucy, especially creamy sauces, gobbled it up saying how much he liked this sauce, and my 22 mo. old, who refuses to eat any kind of vegetable, was packing away the broccoli.  The only thing I changed was I used 1 lb. fresh steamed broccoli.  I even used the 98% fat free soups and it was still delicious.  This is going to be a regular at our house.  Thanks, Shannon!!!

Yum! This is my husbands favorite dish of all time. And I have to say it's one of mine too! Very easy to prepare and packs a lot of flavor. I've made changes over the couple years I've been making this, some suggestions from other reviewers helped. I use an extra chicken breast and I season them with salt and pepper after cubing them and then brown them in olive oil before layering into the casserole. I use fresh broccoli and add 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 tsp onion powder, 1/4 tsp paprika, 1/2 tsp curry powder, 1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper, and 1 1/2 tsp dijon mustard all to the sauce. I serve this with wild rice and we have it almost every week. It is awesome. Very savory and even better the next day for lunches. Thank you so much!

This was really good, I think I needed more sauce (I added two more chicken breast) but I just used fresh raw broccoli and raw chicken as well, put it all in the pan, mixed it up and baked for about an hour.  Turned out great, added extra crimini mushrooms and garlic to the soup mix, didn't have any curry so used some paprikia.  Turned out great

Very good. Especially w/minor taste changes. I put cheese and breadcrumbs on 1/2 of casserole and leave 1/2 w/out. That way I can have the 'slimmer' version while my husband doesn't care about calories...

A pretty good "home cooking" recipe...well, with some modifications because so many reviewers said it was a touch bland.  I used one can of cream of broccoli soup in place of the cream of mushroom soup, used 1/4 cup mayo and 1/4 cup sour cream, added lots of minced garlic and curry powder, and topped with bread crumbs.  Served this over herb mashed potatoes for a simply devine home cooking casserole.  I love when my husband goes back for seconds, and he did with this recipe.

I thought that this recipe was an odd choice as an entree as written. It seemed really soupy and awkward as a main course.I definately recommend putting it over rice or egg noodles, and if so, keep the chicken in bigger pieces so it seem like a dinner and not a lunch.  I also added a splash of sherry.  That being said, I thought that it had a great taste and strangely enough, put it over mashed potatoes and thought that it was perfect comfort food.  I was sad when the leftovers were gone.

I made this for a potluck supper. It was a big hit. I used 1 lb. frozen broccoli spears and  2 cans of cream of chicken soup and thinned with 1/2 cup of milk. Used less cheese and covered with seasoned bread crumbs. I had about 1 cups of sauce left over and froze it for later use.

This is one of our favorite recipes.  But mine is modified somewhat.  First, I steam the broccoli (do not overcook) and place it in the bottom of the baking dish.  Second, I brown the chicken cubes (salt and pepper to taste).  Cover the broccoli with the chicken.  My cream mixture consists of one can of Cream of Chicken soup, 1/2 can of water, 1/2 cup of mayo, 1 teaspoon of lemon juice, and most importantly, curry powder to taste (I use a lot!).  The curry adds a ton to the flavor.  Top with bread crumbs.  Bake at 325 for about 40 minutes.  Uncover toward the end so the bread crumbs brown.

SO good!  I browned the chicken (4 boneless breasts)in butter with paprika & a sprinkle of garlic & onion powder. Cut back mayo to 1/4c and added 1/3c milk.  Used fresh broccoli. Topped with bread crumbs & grated romano cheese & browned. Served over linguine. Thanks for a great recipe.  We had company & everyone loved this recipe.

My mom gave me this recipe a couple of years ago and it is one of my favorites. It is best with fresh broccoli (steamed crisp/tender), but frozen is certainly much easier when you are pressed for time. I add about 3/4 teaspoon of curry powder to the soup mixture for added flavor. It is also good topped with mozzarella cheese and served over spaghetti with a sprinkling of Parmesan cheese.

Absolutely delicious! I tasted before adding the salt and it was a good thing, because I had salt in my chicken broth, and it was enough. Worth every minute cooking! A company-grade meal.

First off, let me say..."My name is Melissa, and I'm a slow-cookeraholic". Sooooo. I cubed uncooked chicken, raw fresh broccoli with everything but the mayo and put it in my crockpot on low for 6 hours. Once that was finished, I stirred in 1/2c of cashew milk (so much better than mayo and less calories too but still has an EXTREMELY creamy texture) and served with brown rice. IT WAS A MAJOR HIT!!

I've been making this casserole for 30 years. At the end of the baking time I used to top it off with fresh bread crumbs and pats of butter and turn on the broiler for a few minutes. My family loved it that way, but it's far from healthy!

I halved the recipe, so I used the combo can of Cream of Chicken & Mushroom.  It was delicious, but I did add about 3/4 tsp of curry and topped it with crushed potato chips.  Oh and to make things easier, I mixed it all together in the casserole dish!  It's a keeper!

This dish was a definite hit at the Senior's rec center where I cook.  I used condensed milk instead of mayo and sprinkled some crispy french onions with the cheese.  I used sharp cheddar for more flavor.  I will be making this for them again!

This was quick and easy, and a crowd pleaser.  Just don't be an idiot like I was and put fresh uncooked broccoli in it.  You should probably steam it first ;).  The second time I made it it was very tasty.

Using some dark meat, mixed with the chicken breasts makes it even better.   I mix the cheddar cheese with everything else, and add a small amount of curry powder.   I top mine with "store-bought" bread crumbs.   Delicious - A family favorite!

I give this 5 stars for the ease of preparation and because this is made with ingredients my family always has on hand. I served it over white rice. I like to make the recipe as written the first time and so I didn't make any changes.  I did however saute the chicken in some olive oil and sprinkled it with salt, pepper, and garlic salt.  Next time I will add curry like other reviewers suggested and I will also use fresh broccoli instead of frozen.  My four year old thought that the broccoli was "mushy" and I agree.  My husband says this is a winner and so I guess it will be added into the rotation :-)

When I make something for the first time I always ask myself if the dish is worthy of being served to guests.  If it isn't, then I likely won't make the dish again.  This one did not make the cut.  I followed the recipe exactly and found the dish to be bland and it tasted artificial.  The only plus on this recipe was that it was fast.

This was really easy and really good.  The reason for only four stars is because it was just a tad bland.  Next time I will try half mayo and half sour cream as another reviewer suggests.  Otherwise VERY good.  I did add a Ritz cracker/butter upper crust also.  UPDATED--  forget the mayo and just use sour cream and it is PERFECT!

Without the addidtion of 1/2 c sour cream, 1 t. lemon juice, and 1 t curry, and the 1/2 c of cheese to the sauce, I feel this would have been bland as other reviewers have suggested.  With these modificationas (I would even do more lemon juice), it is 5 stars!

Great recipe! I used double the chicken, 1 cup of mayo, the juice of an entire lemon, and 2 tsp curry. Mixed some bread crumbs with a little butter and sprinkled over the cheese. Served with rice and salad, everyone loved it. We'll be making this many more times!

Broccoli made moisture in bottom of pan, soup mix did not melt down through ingredients.  Perhaps an instruction to mix soup mixture with chicken and broccoli would correct both of those problems.

I haven't actually made this recipe. I got one almost exactly like it off another website except it used only the chicken soup not the mushroom. One suggestion that the recipe i used that I think would make this even better.. cook a box of chicken stuffing by the directions.. then juss put it over top of everything and bake regularly. It makes it SOOOOOO good!

Fast, pretty easy and filling but did need a bit of curry or something to liven it up some.  I'll make it again, mostly because it's so healthy and so fast!

Very good! I scaled the recipe to serve four so to avoid two cans of opened soup I just used cream of chicken.

I opted to add 1 tsp of curry powder to this recipe per the recommendation of fellow reviewers.  I did not enjoy the flavor of the curry powder in this recipe at all.  Using both cream of mushroom and cream of chicken soups, the flavor of the broccoli was completely lost.  I would recommend using cream of broccoli in place of one of these soups.  I would also recommend that you partially precook this frozen broccoli before baking.  I have had other recipes for Chicken Divan that I have enjoyed much more than this one.

I have used this recipe for years... i found it in a cookbook that my mother had back in the early 70's.  My family loved it then and  now that they are all grown they still ask for it when the come home for a visit... I use it for church potluck dinners and  I alway get asked for the recipe...  the only change I have made is I always mix the cheese in with the  soup mayo  mixture...  Definitely one my all time favorites...

I'm not very fond of casseroles, but my husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.  I like that it was served over rice.  I was a little nervous to add the recommended 1 tsp of curry to the soup mixture, but the flavor was very good and complimented the recipe quite well.  Adding bread crumbs made the topping crunchy and very yummy.  I did add fresh lemon juice to the soup mixture and I pan fried the chicken after marinating in olive oil, lemon juice and lemon pepper. Next time I dont think will chop the fresh broccoli as small since we couldn't really tell there was broccoli in the dish.  I used cream cheese in place of the mayo, but in the future I will just add 1/2 cup milk to thin the sauce a bit and lower the fat calories.  I used fat free cream of mushroom soup and the regular version cream of chicken with herbs.

I wanted a larger portion and based on the reviews that it was soupy - used 6 chick breasts to 1 and 1/2 cans of cream of chicken, 1 cup mayo, 1 and 1/2 cups of shredded cheddar.  Also used fresh broccoli (chopped small).  Frozen broccoli tends to add water to your recipes.  Topped with bread crumbs and baked for 45 in 350.  Delicioius

No Question this recipe gets FIVE STARS! I have a family of seven, so I had to double to recipe, I added some extra lemon juice and splash of mustard just to add to the flavor a bit. Serve this with rice and a salad, and you have a brand new family favorite. Thank you so much for this recipe!

One of our favorite comfort foods!  I liked this recipe better than my grandma's that I've been making for years.  I use broccoli florets, add a bit of extra chicken (makes a HUGE difference if it's good, flavorful chicken), and full-fat soups/mayo ... makes a big difference how yummy (versus bland) the casserole will be.  Oh, I also put another extra 1/2 - 1c cheese on top (husband's preference). The lemon juice is a must ~ can't skip that step!

So quick and easy. A GREAT dish to make when you have leftover chicken! As a busy mother of 2 children, I don't always have alot of time to "prepare" dinner. BINGO on this recipe! Plus the kids love it with all the cheese on top! A definate keeper!

though i usually hate to use canned "cream of" soups, this recipe is easy & quick & tastes great.  i add sour cream instead of mayo & use fresh raw broccoli instead of frozen.  i also top with some breadcrumbs as well as the cheddar.  don't forget the lemon juice - it makes a huge difference!  this works well for making the day before & storing in the fridge 'til you're ready to cook.

My husband and I love this and eat it all the time.  I add about 1 t. curry powder to the sauce and use fresh broccoli.  Really easy and healthy for a weeknight dinner too. (That is, healthy if you cut back on the cheese & use light versions of the cream soups & mayo.)

This recipe is excellent!  I used fat-free cream soups and fat-free mayo, to make this a very healthy, low point meal!  Don't use fat-free cheese though, as it doesn't melt well into the meal.  The whole family loves when I make this dinner!

I made this differently than stated. Used only 1 can cr. chix soup, all lemon juice, 1/2amount of mayo, little milk to thin, 2 breast halfs, uncooked fresh broccoli.
Served over brown rice, kids loved it, even fussy hubby said had "great flavor, really good" If that isn't a great testimony nothing is.

This is an old family favorite. I also add a bit of curry powder, about 1/2 teaspoon as my husband is not wild about curry. It does give it a different flavor. Great use of leftover turkey!

This was really good, especially the sauce.  Since my BF doesn't like mushrooms, I used two cans cream of chicken and served over rice.  The next day for lunch, we stuffed baked potatoes with the leftovers.  We both actually preferred it that way.

Ok - for us, this one was a split decision.  Hubby liked it, me and the kids not so much.  Way too heavy on the mayo - I'd use less when/if I made it again.  Not a bad recipe it was ok, just better things to do with chicken and broccoli in my opinion.

Yummy. I added some salt, pepper and a little curry powder to give it a touch more flavor. And I used Cream of Celery soup instead of C of Mushroom. Delicious. Thank you!

Made this last night and it was very good!  I took someone else's suggestion of a bit more lemon juice and a bit of curry powder which was a great touch.  I did not bother to cook the chicken first and it was completely done.  I baked it covered and then I sprinkled some seasoned bread crumbs on and let them brown a bit uncovered.  Well worth making again!

This is a great recipe my Aunt taught me (My Great Grandmother taught her). The only difference is, my family puts 1 teaspoon of curry powder into the "mix" and spreads bread crumbs over the cheese for extra flavor. Others should try it as well. 

And don't forget, have those chicken breasts cooked and cut into pieces before moving on to the directions :)

This was delish! I did change it up just a little bit.  instead of the cream of mushroom, i used the new Philly cooking creme, and mixed it w/ Mild Diced chiles, which gave it an awesome rich flavor and just a little more zing. Also boiled my chicken for 20 mins ahead of time in the morning.  YUM!

I had to fry my chicken breasts first.  I used coconut oil (this brand does NOT taste like coconut) I seasoned with garlic/paprika/rosemary.  I left skin on and once cooled, I pulled from bone and sliced on the bias.  I put the broc. in that same pan with all the chicken goodies on the bottom.  I dont know how much but enough to cover my pan which is pretty good size.  I then put the chicken slices on next (3 breasts).  I only used the cream of chicken but I did chop up some fresh mushrooms.  Then I mixed soup with Miracle Whip w/pepper & Olive Oil.  I added my cheese to this mixture as well.  I think I may have added some milk also, but can't remember for sure.  It was very very good.

This is a great receipe, I have used a similar one for years... the only difference is I add about 1-2 tsp curry, and serve it over rice. 
My family loves it and I hardly ever have much leftovers!!

I really liked this but the kids didn't care for all the broccoli (I added extra). Overall a very yummy dish that I served over rice. I did wish that it was a little bit "saucier" to better go over the rice, so I'll probably tinker with it some next time. Overall great recipe.

I liked this fast, easy meal. Perfect for a busy week. Served it over white rice.  Added 2 tsp of lemon juice on accident instead of one, I think I like it that way. Used light mayo and one can of the soups was a reduced sodium soup, turned out great.

this was a great base recipe. i used raw chicken as opposed to cooked. i also used 2 cans cream of chx, 1 can of cream of mushroom, 1/2 fresh squeezed lemon, and a teaspoon of garlic powder and pepper in the sauce. i also mixed a cup of breadcrumbs in a tablespoon of butter and sprinkled on top broiling for about 30 sec. DELISH.

Excellent. I modified this recipe to make it stove-top (due to lack of time) omitted the cheese and added curry powder. FABULOUS! 

Boil the chicken in a bit of curry water, when the chicken is just about done, add the broccoli and cook till tender. Take out the chicken, drain the broccoli. In the same skillet add the soups, and mayo, stir well and heat thoroughly. Then add the shredded chicken and broccoli. Next add the curry powder to taste - serve over rice. HUBBY LOVED IT!

Really tasty!  I have used a very similar recipe for years only mine just used cream of chicken soup (no cr. of mushroom) and also has 2-3 tsp. tarragon added.  I also added 2 Tbs. lemon juice.  In mine you place frozen broccoli spears on the bottom, then top with cooked chicken breast halves, then the sauce over the top of that and cover with shredded cheddar and bake.  Great flavors however you put it together!

I love this dish. It is flavorful and filling....and best of all it is versatile! I always top my chicken divan with cheddar cheese and crushed cheddar crackers (such as Cheez-its). Also, I use a variety of cream soups, depending on what I have on hand. Cream of mushroom or chicken or celery work best though. I also sometimes substitute sour cream for the mayonnaise. The sour cream gives it a slightly different taste...as does eliminating the lemon juice or curry. Overall a wonderful casserole that I have enjoyed for years.

I made some changes, I used 1 can of cream of mushroom soup and 1can of cheddar broccoli, substituted milk instead of the mayo and doubled the lemon juice. I topped with breadcrumbs and served over egg noodles! Delicous! Will add seasonings next time and mushrooms. Very quick and easy!

This is a very easy recipe when you need something fast to make for dinner.  I added a little bit of milk to the sauce to thin it out.  I also served it with rice.

Really easy to put together, and my daughter loved it. The last time I made chicken divan, she said she would have liked more sauce, so I made the full amount of sauce, half the broccoli and the full amount of chicken in a 9 inch square pan, and she thought that was great. Thanks!

My family loves this and I like that it is healthy and economical.  I have made it three times and always use *fresh* broccoli - works well. The last time I made it I eliminated the can of chicken soup and liked it a little better.

This is very good and I have made this before, but this was my first attempt to make a home made cream soup base.  We liked it even more than the canned soup, but for convenience I would use cans if I could tolerate MSG.  I used parmesan cheese, about a cup, and sprinkled some more on top.   Some people make this with bread crumbs on top, but I like to add some croutons to the bottom of the dish.  Delicious with a little bit of curry powder mixed in and more on top.  We served it over white rice

Needs extra seasoning on the chicken and seasoned breadcrumbs on top to combat lack of flavor.  However, a good way to disguise broccoli.

This is a family favorite! I use fresh par-boiled broccoli, 2 cans cream of chicken soup & 1 cup of sour cream insead of the mayo.  I also top it with buttered breadcrumbs or cornflake crumbs. Great way to use leftover chicken or turkey!

Left out the cheese, and added a lot of seasoning.  Lemon juice was good, used more of that.  Also seasoned chicken with poultry seasoning and oregano, broccoli with salt and pepper.  Served with mashed potatoes....mmmmmmmmmm.  The recipe says use two bags of broccoli...definitely use two full bags!

We tried this recipe last night and it was FANTASTIC! I cut the recipe in half and added some chopped red pepper and minced garlic to the pan I cooked the chicken in for a few minutes. I also used cream to thin the soup, topped with the shredded cheese and added bread crumbs on top of everything. I will definitely be making this again.

Not a bad recipe for a quick, easy meal.  Because I read lots of reviews saying that it lacked flavor, I cooked the chicken with Season All and then added a little more salt and pepper to the soup mixture.  Also, I added more cheese than it called for because my husband and teenager like "cheesy". (I used sharp cheddar which helped with the flavor too.)  They both seemed to like it--went for seconds.  My three year old ate it too.

I love it! I use 1 can Cheddar cheese soup, and 1 can chicken-mushroom soup, with 1-2 cups of milk. I throw the chicken chunks in raw over the broccoli, add some seasonings, and sprinkle Cheddar cheese in at the last 20 minutes of cooking.

This was SO easy and very good.  Made only minor adjustments to suit our tastes. 

I used left over plain grilled chicken, but I marinated in lemon juice a few hours before putting this together.

I mixed some extra parmasan into the cheese to make a full 2 cups of cheese (Mainly to clean out my fridge).

I used the Mushroom Soup with roasted garlic.  

Next time I will thaw and drain the broccoli to get rid of excess water.  I did not do this because I thought the extra moisture would be good.  It was a little too much.

First of all, I scaled this to serve four.  I used one can of cream of celery, which I thought gave a more "grown up" taste to the meal.  I felt the chicken cream would've made it too "chickeny".  I did have cream of mushroom, but I just wanted to try it w/ the celery soup. I will in the future make this dish w/ the mushroom soup, and the following time, w/ cream of broccoli.  I did add  a bit extra milk.  I wanted the sauce to be creamier, which was awesome.  I added about 3-4x extra lemon and I was really wowed at how it made all the flavors really pop in this meal!  I had tons of sauce(b/c of the milk) which was fine because I served this w/ egg noodles, extra wide.  You could def smell the broccili, but pretty much couldn't taste it, which is exactly what I needed for my veggie averse gang.  I used chopped frozen broccoli, which I think helped too.  If using frozen broc, drain and blot the heck out of it.  I can only imagine how this recipe could be ruined by too much moisture in the broccili.  Very versatile and very delish!  Thank you!

This was AWESOME!!!!  Followed other reviewers suggestions and did not cook the broccoli or chicken first just added approx. 25 minutes to oven time.  I used 1 can of cream of mushroom & 1 can of cream of broccoli soup and 1/2 c. milk.  No mayo, no lemon juice and added garlic powder & curry powder (this is the deal breaker, you must add curry powder).  Fiance enjoyed it so much he wants to make it again tomorrow night.  Thanks to the original poster and to those with their thoughtful additions.  Excellent dish.  Easy prep.  Perfect mid week meal.

Wow!  This is yummy.  I substituted the mayo with milk and I added a little garlic powder.  This works well with mixed frozen veggies too.  Super simple to put together and the whole family really enjoyed this.

Pretty good and easy. I used fresh broccoli and did not steam it prior to cooking which was a mistake. Make sure to steam the broccoli first. I used the lowfat versions of the soups with lowfat cheese and you can't even tell the difference.

I like a lot more chicken for a much heartier meal. I only use 1 package of broccoli (spears - not chopped, and lightly thawed), and 8 chicken breasts (whole, not cut up and I don't cook my chicken), a full cup of fat free mayo, healthy request and 98% fat free cream soups (or will make my own cream soup which is much cheaper and healthier) 2 full cups of cheese, no lemon juice and top it with crushed cornflakes. I also bake it at 325 for 1 hr 20 minutes. It makes a yummy meal, and I usually only serve it with carrot and celery sticks to complete it.

Lightened this up a bit.  Used low-fat soups and mayo.  Added 1/2 teaspoon curry and topped with 2% cheese.  Next time I'd use the stuffing mix my grandmother's recipe calls for and leave off the cheese.  I used Mann's ready to use broccoli that you steam in the bag and cooked it at the lowest setting.  Even so, This took a long time to cook.  Still good though.

I love chicken divan and this recipe was not only quick and easy, but tasted great as well.  Ok, technically if you’re trying (like I am) to eat healthier and lose some weight, this might not be your first choice.  But come on, once in a while you’ve just got to have some comfort food!

This recipe was really easy/fun to make. It turned out really good..the only thing I would do differently would be to mix the cheese with the broccoli instead of just puiing it on top. I will make this dish again.

This is getting four stars for being just what it is supposed to be, quick and easy.  We were going out to dinner, but just got too tired.  I threw this together in no time and we were all happy.  I did add a bit of curry and some lemon juice to the soup mixture, and used low fat mayonnaise.

We thought this was pretty good.  Easy.  Something good to have with leftover chicken or turkey.  I usually have all the soups and stuff in my house at any given time, so it works well for a last minute kind of meal.

A forgotten favorite I've just made again. I had a bunch of fresh broccoli so I steamed that and used instead of frozen. I had just one can of soup (cream of chicken) which seemed to be plenty of sauce. I lightened it up a bit by using sour cream instead of mayonnaise. I also remember my old recipe calling for 1/2 teaspoon of curry powder in the sauce (the American interpretation of curry powder, not the authentic kind). You can add a small can of sliced mushrooms to the sauce too. Very tasty and the leftovers are good too.

My whole family LOVED this recipe.  I did change/add a couple of things:  I substituted Cream of Brocolli Soup for the Cream of Mushroom and added about 1/2tsp. curry powder for extra flavor!  LOVED IT!!  Will definately make it again and again!

Pretty good. after reading the reviews, I added less mayo and less soup (3/4 cans) and sprinkled with garlic powder and curry powder. I don't know how often I will make it but I am sure I will make it again.

This was fantastic.  I tripled the lemon juice and loved the tanginess it brought to the dish, really zipped up and brought out the broccoli.  And the second time I doubled the amount of cheese!  Awesome, and extremely easy to make.

This is one of my all-time favorites. I have never put lemon juice in it, but it is great without it. I use whatever "Cream Of" soup I have on hand.(And thin it with a little milk) My favorite cheese to use is the marbled cheddar/jack. I have used fresh and frozen broccoli with good results. I always steam or boil the broccoli before adding to the chicken. Also I have used left over roasted chicken and also boiled or browned the chicken in a pan before assembling. The other thing I often add is a carton of fresh mushrooms that I saute in a little butter. This dish can be modified in so many ways. I have never had a bad batch. I have given this recipe out numerous times.

I made this twice as it seemed like it had possibilities as a good standard casserole dish.  The 2nd time, I substituted milk for the mayonnaise as my husband had thought it was too heavy the 1st time.  I microwaved some fresh broccoli crowns for a couple minutes before chopping them & adding them to the dish as the 1st time they were too al dente (when I'd added them uncooked).  I also added chopped celery & sliced mushrooms to the dish, some garlic powder, & also added crushed Ritz whole wheat cracker crumbs & slivered almonds to the topping.  It was OK but I don't think I'll be adding it to my regular recipes as I felt it still needed some pizazz.

My hubby likes this. We poach the chicken in chicken broth & then slice thinly. I also make it a complete dinner by putting cooked rice (great use for leftovers) in the bottom of the pan, top with brocilli (have also used french cut green beans or asparagus), then turkey or chicken, then saucey topping making sure to spread to the edges. I usually top with bread crumbs & a little less cheese.

This recipe was ok, instead of Lemon Juice, I added white wine, which you couldn't detect so I may add more.  Anyhow, I also didn't think the two breasts was enough when I went to assemble the casserole, so I used canned chicken, even though I never recommend canned meat products.  It was ok, except for it had a strange taste from the canned chicken, kind of like tuna.  I served this dish with garlic mashed potatoes, overall had I used normal chicken I probably would've really liked this dish.

My husband and I really liked this dish...I halved the recipe, and since it seemed it might be a bit bland as submitted, used one can of cream of chicken dijon soup, added some garlic powder and a small can of sliced mushrooms, drained....any leftovers also reheat well in the microwave.

I used the salt free versions of the soups so I added a few sprinkles of salt.  I used fresh broccoli because I needed to use up what I had.  I cooked up some farfalle pasta to serve it with.  Everything turned out great and my husband absolutely loved it.  Will be making it again.  Thanks for such a great recipe!

Although "made from scratch" always wins, this is a great, easy, quick recipe for a delicious meal- with plenty of leftovers in my house... (Yum! It seems to get better overnight...)
I do make these changes, however;
We like a LOT of sauce, so...
 I use 3 to 4 cans of Chicken Soup, (no mushroom), and adjust the amount of mayo. 
I also use about 3/4 of a cup of sour cream.
I personally add about 2 tablespoons of curry,  we love it... I would start out using a teaspoon to start...
I use chopped broccoli, and mix a third of the sauce with it, for the bottom of the pan.
I use crushed crackers, (Ritz and Club are delish, but any savory cracker will do) cheese, and a little Ghee on top.
It turns out to be a crowd pleaser every time. It's truly one of my personal favorites... Something about the curry... Yuuuummm!

I have a recipe similar to this one. I use cream of celery soup instead of cream of chicken & use shredded cheddar jack cheese & toss a box of herb garlic or cheese croutons in 2 tbls of melted butter for the topping. Omit the lemon juice & use 1 cup mayo mixed with soups. Can add extra mushrooms as an option.

My mother has made this for years. I absolutely LOVE this dish. When I make it, I do not use cream of mushroom soup, I just use cream of chicken soup. I also prefer to use fresh broccoli instead of the frozen.

I've made this prob 15 times now and I use milk instead of mayo but other than that the recipe is perfect. I usually add noodles or rice and it has been a hit everytime!

My suggestion is to add 1 T. Curry powder, add 2x the chicken Add 1 can cream of celery. Change mushroom soup to cream of chicken and herb..It is STILL EASY, BUT ADDS SOMUCH MMORE FLAVOR...

So good! I have a larger family so I use 3 1/2 to 4 chicken breast halves, 2 cream of chicken & 1 cream of mushroom soup, 3/4c mayo and 3 teaspoons of lemon juice I also use a little less broccoli & never measure the cheese so I am sure I add more then what is called for. Top with bread crumbs mixed in melted butter. I recently started adding a little bit of sour cream to it which makes it even better. I cook rice in the chicken broth from boiling the chicken breast and while I am making the plates I put some rice and top it with some of the Chicken Divan.

This is a great recipe I've been doing this for years. I like to add a good amount of Curry and I add about a 1/2 cup of Sour Cream because I love it so much. My man raves about this dish he tells me I'm a better cook than his Mother!

Love this recipe as is and with a few changes.  I use 2 lbs. broccoli fresh, chopped and place in a large bowl.  I add about 2 cups dry egg noodles after cooking per instructions I set colander over broccoli in bowl dump noodles over broccoli using boling water to just par cook the broccoli. Drain broccoli and mix with noodles. Top with 1 can cheesy broccoli soup and one can cream of chicken mixed with the mayo and lemon juice. Sprinkle just a little shredded cheese over the top.  Adding the noodles make it a full meal.  I add the chicken per original recipe.

I love this recipe. I made it for dinner tonight. I had to adjust based on what I have available. I used half mayo, half sour cream on this one. I also used whole wheat bread crumbs as topping with cheddar cheese. 
I only used one bag (12oz) of broccoli and it was just perfect. I served it with angel hair pasta. Everybody loved it. Thanks for sharing.

I have made this several times for friends and family who needed an easy dinner - it has always been a pleaser. I make it gluten -free for my family with organic  GF mushroom soup and GF croutons - it's delicious!  I also add scoopable chicken bouillon for flavor. I usually serve rice on the side, but with enough croutons baked in, you don't really need the rice. Just a salad and you have a satisfying meal. My kids(8 and 5) love it!

Giving it four stars because of the changes that I made. I added cooked penne pasta to the bottom, and since I like to "lowfat" everything, I used 98% fat free cream of mushroom and cream of celery soup. I left out the cheddar cheese, added 1/2 tsp dried oregano, 1 tsp garlic powder, and and extra tsp of lemon juice. 25 minutes into baking, I sprinkled with a mix of lightly buttered Italian breadcrumbs and shredded parmesean cheese. Made this for dinner last night and it was a hit! Even those in my family who hate broccoli and mayonnaise couldn't even tell it was there.

My family loved this dish and asked me to make it again. Although I enjoyed it, I felt it was a bit bland for my taste and the juices not thick enough.  Next time, I will add garlic and dash while cooking the chicken and add more in the dish itself.  I will also thicken a homemade white chicken sauce before mixing the liquids together. I will also add more cheese.

Have made this recipe for years.  My family LOVES it. Only variations are to add 1 tbsp lemon juice, and 1 tsp curry powder.  Also I add cooled rice to the bottom of the casserole to make it a one-dish meal.  Yum!

This was quick, easy, and tasty.  I needed something to prepare ahead, so I put the casserole together the night before, using canned chicken breast.  I also halved the recipe.  It was a good quick meal the next night.  I found it was better served over chicken-flavored rice mix.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is similar to a recipe I got years ago. I no longer add  broccoli  to the casserole but serve it steamed on the side. I use crm of chicken and crm of broccoli soups,  increase mayo to 1 cup, and I add 1 cup of sour cream . I increase the sharp cheddar to 1 cup.  I also add 1 tsp of dill - that with the lemon juice and sour cream adds an extra tang that I like. I sprinkle the top with bread crumbs and serve it over rice. I let it set out and cool down a bit before serving. You can adjust the lemon juice and dill to your liking, usually it's the lemon juice I add for the right tang. I also think the sauce mixture could make a nice veggie dip.

I have been looking for a chicken divan recipe like this and I finally found it! This was delicious!! I did make a few changes though, I followed the advice of some of the other reviews and added a 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder and a 1/2 teaspoon of curry. I did add pepper after it was done and served it over rice. Thanks for this recipe!

Extremely delicious! Much better than I even thought. I lightly seasoned the chicken with garlic powder when cooking, and added 1 tsp to the mixture- I also mixed the cheese in with the sauce like others suggested. Didn't have mayo, so used just a bit of 2% milk instead. Also added a dash of pepper and paprika. I didn't use quite as much cheese though, cause I was using a package of frozen broccoli and cheese already. Nearly doubled the sauce recipe so there'd be enough to spread over bowtie noodles, and sprinkled crushed Ritz crackers on top during the last 10 minutes of cooking. Incredible recipe! Works so well with pasta- my boyfriend and I were so amazed. He was surprised at how good the broccoli tasted (he's not a vegetable guy), and he complimented the sauce several times. Yay! This will be a regular item on our menu now. Yum!

WONDERFUL. My family finished off the whole dish. As per other reviewers suggestions, I topped it off with french fried onions as well and the result was fantastic!

EXCELLENT. I added freshly ground black pepper, and 1/2 tsp curry powder per other reviews. I also topped with french fried onions and served with wild rice.

I made this last night from a very similar recipe that had a few additions that, after eating it, I can't imagine it without (meaning - it would be bland).

Suggestions: add 1 Tbs lemon juice, 1 tsp curry powder, and breadcrumbs mixed with the cheese for the topping.

A very filling casserole, although I think I blanched the broccoli too long because it was mushier than I had expected it to be.

This was okay, but rather bland tasting for my taste buds as is.  My husband felt the same.  I was able to jazz it up a bit by adding black pepper, but I'm not sure if I will make this again.

This was so yummy.  I didn't have broccoli, but we have tons of fresh asparagas and it worked so well.  I substituted cheddar cheese soup for the cream of chicken soup and used milk instead of mayo.  I added a tablespoon of dijon mustard.  I never like casserole type things, but this was super delish!!!!

This was really delicious!  Based on other reviews, I added 1/2 tsp curry and 1 tsp garlic powder and used milk instead of the mayo.  I baked baked for 20 min, sprinkled with Italian breadcrumbs and baked for 10 mins longer.  It was super! Thanks!

Okay base recipe, at best. Needs a lot of work. Using cooked chicken leads to dried results - use raw &cook a little longer. Needs spices - even if it's just salt and pepper. I'd suggest using garlic &onions, as well. Used the juice of a whole lemon, which helped some. Topped with Italian bread crumbs in the last 15-20minutes of baking.

I cut 6 chicken tenders into bite-size pieces. I followed the advice of others and didn't pre-cook my chicken. Instead I baked it in the oven for 1 hour. This is by far one of the best chicken recipes I have ever had. It is very creamy and the broccoli just melts in your mouth. I added a little extra cheese because I love cheese! I used mild Cheddar this time but next time I am going to try it with extra sharp Cheddar. I would give it more than 5 stars if I could!

I found the dish to be a little soggy... But this recipe is a keeper with a couple of modifications. I took other reviewers' advice and added half a teaspoon curry powder, which, I thought, gave it a great flavor. I also used half the amount of broccoli and added half a cup of cauliflower, and we actually liked cauliflower better in this dish. So, next time I'll use only cauliflower with no broccoli, and definitely will not forget curry powder. Other than that, I'll keep it in the recipe box! Thanks for the idea!

Pretty darn yummy. I really like this recipe, it's easy. I tend to add fresh mushrooms(cut in big fat slices), and Campbells Wild Mushroom Soup. I also add a clove of garlic in with the chicken when I'm cooking it up. That makes a difference to me.. if you like garlic. I also added a tad of cayenne pepper to spark it up a bit. 
Yummy! Freezes well too. A family fave.

Very easy to make. But I doubled the lemon juice and added a heaping 1/2 tsp of curry. I mixed in some cheese in addition to putting it on top. And for a change, I also added some finely chopped onions and red peppers to the soup mix, before pouring over the broccoli.

This was really good.  Cut the recipe in half so only used one can of cream of celery (all I had) and 1/4 cup sour cream (no mayo either LOL)  Mixed some shreddded cheddar with the broccoli.  Sprinkled chicken with S&P and onion powder b4 cooking.  Served over shell pasta.  The lemon gives it a nice little zing.  Could have used a bit more sauce though.  I'll definitely make this one again.  Thanks :0)

I used 1 can of cream of mushroom and no cream of chicken. I used a 250g bag of fozen broccoli and cauliflower with cheese sauce. I also added crushed saltines, oregano and garlic salt on the top. I made this with fettucine noodles. MMmmmm.

I'm giving it 5 stars because I'm a picky eater and LOVED this, but I did make some modifications. I used one can of the cream of chicken and one can of Campbell's Southwest Pepper Jack Soup. I, also, went with the 1/4 c. mayo & 1/4 c. sour cream. Along with the cheddar cheese I sparingly sprinkled some bread crumbs on top. It was AWESOME!

Everyone loved it. The only thing I did was add 1/4 Cup mayo and 1/4 cup sour cream and shred the chicken. Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

YUM, YUM, YUM!
This is almost exactly the same as my grandmother's recipe. Just add about a teaspoon of curry and it is PERFECT!

I'm giving this a 4, because although I loved it, my husband only thought it was okay. I used lower fat soups and mayo, and added fresh sliced mushrooms. Next time I would maybe add onions also.

Loved this! Made a few changes..I used fresh steamed broccoli, sauteed mushrooms, and added buttered bread crumbs on top. Yummy! Hubby loved this dish...it was delicious!

This is one of my all time favorite recipes.  It's so easy to make and very delicious.  My boyfriend isn't a big fan of broccoli but he eats it up with this recipe and always has seconds (and sometimes thirds).  To save time I've used canned chicken and forgot the lemon juice one time too but both times it was still fantastic.  It's definitely best with a little extra chicken and to add more flavor, I like to use a rotisserie chicken.  I'm making it again tonight!

I really didn't care for this, but I gave it two stars because my family ate it, even though they asked me not to make it again.  The mayonnaise imparted a very "greasy" taste which masked the flavor of everything else in the dish. I've seen some users suggest using sour cream instead of mayo, which seems like it might help some, but I'm probably not going to make this again.

I made a few modifications, but it turned out fabulous.  I used cream of celery and cream of chicken soup for the cream soups.  I used fresh broccoli (that I steamed 1/2 way done before cooking the dish) instead of frozen broccoli and I added a pint of homemade chicken stock to make it a little soupy.  When it was all cooked, I added cooked egg noodles to it and turned it into a casserole.  I was having a bible study group over and they loved it.

An easy recipe that is popular with diners.  It's a little too "processed" for my preference, so I won't serve it often, but it tastes good.

Except for using fresh broccoli, I followed the recipe. Ended up with a layer of water in the bottom of the baking dish and it was pretty bland tasting. I guess I am not a fan of 'soup can' dinners. Thanks Shannon, it sure sounded good!!

This was easy, tasty and great. I did not have cream of chicken, so used 2 cans of cream of mushroom instead, and light old cheddar cheese and fresh broccoli. It was fantastic! Will undoubtably make again. Thanks for sharing!

This was quick and tasty.  Excellent when you need something hearty and tasty but don't have a long time to make something.  i.e., when guests are coming for dinner.  Who doesn't like broccoli, cheese, and chicken?

We really enjoy this recipe!  It is quick, easy, a great way to use leftover chicken and it can be altered using other flavors of soup.  I use reduced fat mayo and it still tastes great.

Easy to prepare, and tasty enough that my husband took two helpings.  I liked it too, but I think I will use less of the soup next time.  I cut recipe in half using one can soup, but it was still too much sauce (I thought.)  I will probably make it again.... Thx for the recipe, Shannon.

Very good and very easy!  I used twice the amount of chicken this recipe called for.  I also used cream of chicken with herbs instead of plain cream of chicken soup.  I put some plain bread crumbs on the top of this dish and then sprinkled with garlic powder.  This was a hit!

This was OK.  I will try it again using 2% milk instead of mayonnaise, mix the cheese, (sharp), in with the soup mixture, add some seasonings, add a lot more chicken, and then top with a little extra cheese for presentation.

This was really good but I just used what I had on hand which was fresh cauliflower and sharp cheddar cheese.  I also added about 1/4 cup of milk to thin the sauce and had only a can of regular cream of mushroom soup and one of roasted garlic cream of mushroom.  Excellent...it's a keeper!

This was pretty good. I cooked my chicken on the indoor grill, used a mix of frozen broccoli and cauliflower,used cream of broccoli instead of chicken,left out the mayo and used a dash of milk instead. I also stirred in some fresh garlic. Very quick and easy. Served with mashed potatoes and was pretty good as leftovers. A once in a while meal.

This turned out better than I thought it would. I added an extra chicken breast and generously seasoned them with garlic and poultry seasoning before I baked them. As for the sauce, I used half of the mayo (used light mayo) and substituted the rest with milk. I also added pepper and sage to the sauce. Took the suggestion to lightly sprinkle the top with seasoned bread crumbs, cheddar cheese and parmesan. Served with a green salad...very tasty, EASY meal!

Great quick & easy recipe, but too salty even for me. (I usually salt everything!) I don't think I used enough chicken, so mine came out really saucy. Might try the reduced sodium soups next time.

This was definitely quick and easy!  My husband took seconds and thirds :)  I thought it was pretty tasty, but not really a standout.  I might add milk to the sauce next time, it was pretty thick this first time.  Overall very good, though!

This was really quick and simple--just the way I like my recipes.  Served over brown rice with a big green side-salad. Even the mother-in-law liked it and I seldom please her--lol! Will definitely put this one into rotation!

Sorry, but this recipe just didn't do it for me.  Where was the nutmeg, sherry, whipping cream that makes this such a memorable meal.

My family loved this, including my 3 kids!! We will make this again, for sure! I used fresh broccoli, 2 cans of cream of chicken soup (didn't have mushroom), 2 tsp of lemon juice and 1/2 tsp curry powder (suggested by others) and 1/4 tsp pepper. I also added 1 small onion, diced, and topped with breadcrumbs (suggested by others). I agree with another reviewer that there was no need to cook the chicken ahead. I just diced it and laid it on top of the broccoli. I cooked it 45 min. Because my chicken was only partially thawed, I covered it with tinfoil for the first 25 min and then uncovered for 20 min. Delicious!! The curry powder and onions added an excellent flavour.

My mother in law used to make this all the time and I started making it too from time to time. One day I stumbled across a lil tip by accident. I didn’t have any Mayo in the house but the closest thing I had was ranch dressing so I used that and wow! It gave the dish a surprisingly tasty little extra zing. It’s the only way I make it now. Give it a try!

I added white wine and a little whole milk to make it saucier. Served over rice buffet style at a pot luck dinner get together and it was good I doubled the recipe.

I made this recipe as stated, no alterations or substitutions. The broccoli is overpowering, no seasonings were added, the chicken was a bland addition and added nothing except for it was chicken.  My rating is based on the recipe AS WRITTEN.

I made this a second time with additions, I seasoned the chicken, I used buttered crumbled ritz crackers, I used cream of celery and minimized the amount of broccoli. SALT was the simplest fix on the original recipe.  I used curry to season the chicken with some garlic salt before cooking it. I checked around online there are a ton of variations but if you are going to rate the recipe please rate it as is written.  Then you can give all the details on fixing it after.

I have had to adjust for my son and grandson who have celiac disease.  The gluten free cream of chicken and mushroom soups are much thinner than regular condensed soups.  I add about 1 tsp of corn starch and omit the milk.  I also add 1/2 to 1 tsp of curry.  Melt butter and stir in gluten free bread crumbs until crumbly to sprinkle on top.  I also recommend shredding your own cheddar cheese rather than the pre shredded as it melts much better.  This is a family favorite!

I made changes only due to what I had on hand-instead of frozen broccoli, I used frozen spinach, used a smoky cheddar cheese, added 1/2 tsp curry, and then put canned fried onions on top for last 10 minutes-my husbands new favorite recipe

One small addition makes this a kids favorite dinner. Add gold fish to the very top for a crunchy texture. My 7 & 9 year old's eat it up & ask for it again & again. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this same recipe twice in one week - my husband was thrilled over it!  However, the second making, I substituted Velveeta cheese instead of the cheddar cheese.  We can't decide which we like best!!!  This is such a quick and easy recipe and I took a shortcut and de-boned a cooked rotisserie chicken bought at the grocery store - yum!!!

Will make again. Should try it with a bit less frozen broccoli maybe bring it up to room temp? Or just plan on cooking way longer. Cooked 55 minutes and good.

I wasn't crazy about this.  I didn't like the strong taste of cream of chicken soup. I eliminated the cream of mushroom soup and used cheddar cheese soup.  If I make it again will definitely use less cream of chicken soup.

I tried this last night and it was divine! I followed the recipe exactly and I seasoned the chicken cutlets as i cooked them before placing them over broccoli. I made some grands honey butter biscuits and opened them and put the chicken divan over to eat and it was amazing. Next time I make this I will probably serve with white rice. This literally took 10 minutes to prep and the casserole dish was completely empty; no leftovers. Two thumbs up

No one in my family would eat this.  I didn't even like it and I like about everything.  I gave it 2 stars because it was edible but that's about as far as I will go.  It was bland and nothing about it tasted good.  All of the good flavor of all of the component ingredients was somehow wiped out by the others.  This one will be promptly deleted.

The overall recipe was easy and turned out very good... I just forgot how much I dislike broccoli! I am going to make it again but I'm going to switch the broccoli for cauliflower next time... then it will be perfect for our family!

Very tasty and easy recipe.  I grilled the chicken and seasoned them with garlic, paprika, and cumin. I also followed the other users' suggestions and added chili powder.  I will most definitely make this again!

I loved it especially with the curry and I accidentally used a lime but it was great 
I honestly didn't think combining those sauces and lime that it would taste so great

I have done this for about 40 years, my mom's recipe.  However, hers called for curry powder which is a taste preference - we love it!  Also, instead of cream of mushroom and/or chicken, I use brocolli cheddar cheese soup (there is a recipe on the can for chicken divan).  Mom also used Miracle Whip.......

Love this recipe, friends ask for it over and over. I added corn flakes (6 cups) covered in 1 stick of melted butter on top to add some crunchiness. Yum!

Too much of a mayo taste for me -- or maybe it was in my head. My hubby said he liked it, but I probably won't make again.

cooked the chicken the night before in the crockpot with italian dressing.  A few minutes before it was done I mixed melted butter and italian bread crumbs and put them on the top and let it brown.  Served over noodles.  Good!

We thought this was a good quick and easy meal served over rice. I did add some additional seasonings though, black pepper and some garlic topped this dish off just right.

Kept the recipe pretty much the same--added curry powder as suggested, extra lemon juice as well.  I used one can of cream of chicken soup with herbs along with a can of regular.  Also made a buttered bread crumb topping by mixing bread crumbs in garlic butter and topped the cheese topping with it.  Good reviews from my husband!

OMG this is my grandmother's recipe from 1980 that I had lost...however, she used cream of mushroom soup instead. I added a full star to the overall rating with these extras that make it tastier. Add: 1.) 1T curry powder 2.) fresh bread crumbs on top and then the cheese...the curry adds the extra flavor to make this one of your all-time favorites, too. Bon Apetit'

This is the recipe I have been searching for.  Years ago an aunt of mine made this and I just loved it!  I do have one question.  Has anyone frozen this and how did that work?  Should it be undercooked a little and what about freezing the cheese?  As you can tell I am not a very experienced cook.

Our family absolutely loves chicken divan, we have it on birthdays usually...The cahnges we make to it, like a few have said are to add curry, and top with bread crumbs. We also use a purchased roasted chicken and just shred it, for a bit easier/faster preparation! Mix the broccoli and chicken,pour sauce on top, top with cheese and breadcrumbs, and bake! YUM! Will be having it in less than an hour tonight!

This was really a great quick dish.  For me - it was just a little too creamy (compared to the broccoli and chicken ratio).  Next time, I may try to cut down on that part and the cheese...but otherwise, really good for a quick meal to get both veggies and poultry in!

This was very good, and very easy.  Hubby absolutely loved it.  All I had was a 16oz. bag of california style mixed veggies (broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots), and it was still great.  I served it over chicken flavored ricc-a-roni.  I'm making it again tonight, and can't wait!

This was pretty good but like many of the reviews said, it would have been better if I'd have added some bread crumbs to the top.  It was to creamy without.  I used fresh broccoli and was worried that I hadn't precooked them but they turned out great!!  I will use this again adding bread crumbs next time!!

Really yummy and great for leftovers too!! I followed some of the suggestions and added my own as well...ie. I used low sodium soup, added shredded cheese to the soup mixture, topped with breadcrumbs/butter, and used the 1t curry powder.  It was great over brown rice or plain...Hubby and I loved it! Next time I will try adding baby carrots to the broccoli and topping with a ritz cracker/butter topping!!!

I had all the ingredients on hand, so I went with it.  I added Hungarian paprika to the chicken since some said the recipe was missing something.  To cut back on fat, I omitted the cheese and used reduced fat cream soup.  I didn't like the mayo, so I'll omit that next time.  It was much easier to just mix everything together instead of layering.  I was in the mood for something creamy, and this satisfied that craving.  I had this over some rice too.

Allrecipes picked dinner for me tonight based on an ingredient search so this is what we had.  I used 2 cans of cream of chicken, 1 lb chicken and probably only a cup of cheese.  I seasoned it with salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and a little curry powder.  We served it over brown rice.  My 10 month old son LOVED it...he finished an entire bowl!  My husband and I thought it was OK.  We give it 4 stars because it was easy to make and it can be made completely with things we always have in the fridge or pantry.

Good in a pinch.  I usually don't care for condensed soup recipes, but I was running out of time and needed something quick and easy.  I didn't have cream of mushroom so I used a can of cream of broccoli with the cream of chicken.  It turned out pretty good and the kids loved it!

This is a very good recipe if you want broccoli and soup in it.  I made mine without the broccoli, replace it with celery and onions, added potato chips on the top and serve a vegetable on the side.

Quick and easy, plus I had most of the ingredients on hand.  I used 2 cans of cream of chicken instead of a mixture but it was very good - the chicken was moist and the flavor was good.  Great weeknight meal - we'll be making this again!

Wasn't crazy about this one.  It tasted like everything else you can make with cream of 'anything' soup.  Also was very bland for me.

This really suprised me.  It was very simple, and very good.  I used fresh brocolli, milk instead of mayo, and just a few sprinkles of bread crumbs over the top.  Thanks!

This is a good base from which to start--I thought it needed a little more flavor punch, but that may have been because I used all low-sodium products.

I was looking for a good chicken divan recipe.  This one is very good but not quite what I was looking for.  I thought it should have more sauce to it and found the sauce in this recipe to be too thick.  But it was very quick and easy and even the leftover went quickly!

I made a few changes. I boiled fresh broccoli with 1/2 a chopped onion. I also grilled the chicken on my stove with a grill pan and seasoned it with garlic salt seasoning and pepper. The flavor was good but I think next time I will reduce the soups to 1/2 can each and maybe add some chopped garlic as well. Just needed a bit more kick.

This was really good but it needs something more so it is not too dry.  I don't know if it is adding more milk or adding some chicken broth.  I will make it again to see. Having said that, I loved it, my husband and 1 year old had 2nds so it was good just needed something else.  I followed the recipe but used milk instead of Mayo, added garlic powder and curry powder as suggested, just need to figure out the dryness...

Quick, Easy, AND Delicious! Used light mayo and only 1 12 oz bag of fresh broccoli, which is all I had on hand but seemed to be enough.  Highly recommend!

I thought this recipe dried out the chicken too much and didn't have enough flavor. It's very simple to do though.

This is a nice, easy recipe that my whole family enjoys.  We eat it almost once a week just because it is so simply and so delicious.  I usually scale down the broccoli to 1 1/2 bags and use 2 cans of cream of chicken soup but otherwise make it as recommended.  Thanks!!

This was pretty tasty. I did not have frozen broccoli on hand so I used fresh instead...frozen would have worked better. I added 1tsp of curry and 1tsp of tastefully simple garlic garlic.  Very tasty...could of used a bit more chiken for the sauce.  I also added some bread crumbs at the very end.

This tasted AMAZING! Changes per other recommendations: I used milk instead of mayonnaise, added 1/2 tsp of curry powder, 1 extra tsp of lemon juice, and a little bit more cheese. Finally, I baked it for 20 minutes, then covered it with dry bread crumbs, and baked for 10 more minutes.

I followed the recipe exactly except I also added 1 tsp of curry powder and sprinkled plain bread crumbs on top during the last 15 minutes of baking.  I would recommend using only 1/2 tsp as although I LOVE curry, this is a very American dish and having so much curry flavor seemed out of place.  I would give this 5 stars except I feel that a casserole should be good for leftovers, but I wasn't too keen on the way the broccoli turned out the next day.

My family loved this recipe, I didn't use as much broccoli and only used 1 can of soup, also added garlic powder to chicken while it cooked. I think the lemon is the special ingredient. Great way to get kids to eat broccoli. We ate it over brown rice. Thanks for a great recipe, will make again.

This was really good, better than I expected, even good leftover.  I put my broccoli in the pan straight from the freezer and didn't have any problem at all with the sauce being thin/watery as others have stated.  I added to the sauce 1/2 t garlic powder and 1 C of the cheese  and sprinkled French Fried Onions on top of the broccoli.  15 minutes before it was done baking I topped it with the remaining cheese and more of the French Fried Onions.  Although I served rice on the side just in case I preferred it with out.

I was disappointed in the lack of flavor this recipe had. I chose it for its simplicity but should I make it again, would tweak the seasoning.

Wow!  I wasn't sure if this would be good when putting it together so easily...but we loved it.  I didn't alter the recipe at all and we served it over white rice.  It was a big hit and we'll put this on our list of regular quick meals.  Thanks!

My husband loved this dish and I thought it was just okay.  I followed the original recipe except I omitted lemon juice (I didn't have any but maybe I would have liked it better if I had added it) and then  added a tsp of garlic powder per other reviewers.  If I make it again I will add curry powder as well.  I served mine with roasted potatoes which turned out really well because it made it a cheesy potato, chicken, broccoli, and cheese casserole.  Again husband loved it and he's picky I am not sure what was missing from it for me.

Dish was tasty but prep time was longer than listed. Allowing for cooking and chopping chicken added quite a bit more time to recipe. Will try again though.

YUM! I LOVE this recipe. Cheesy yummy goodness. I did add 1/4 tsp curry and some garlic powder for our tastes and it came out amazing! We served it over egg noodles, but would be awesome with rice too. Thanks for this awesome recipe! My two year old even had a bite or two of broccoli!

I was looking for quick and easy, and I found it. The recipe I'm rating kind of stinks (sorry to say, but it's way bland), but with all the other reviews and their suggestions for improvement, the Chicken Divan I made turned out fantastic.

This is so good. Whole family could not stop eating this! I used fresh broccoli that I lightly steamed, and it was perfect. This will definitely be made again and again at my house!

I am looking for simple recipes these days to cut down cooking time. My son really enjoyed this dish. I cooked a pot of white rice and garnished the Chicken Divan on top. I did have to add more seasoning to taste.

so far this is the best thing I've made from this site. It was ridiculously easy (and I'm really not much of a cook so that helps). My boyfriend pretty much downed the whole thing in one sitting. I made this exactly as the recipe called for and I thought it had plenty of flavor. I was worried it might be overly mushroom-y but it wasn't at all. Next time I might try fresh broccoli. I'll definitely be making this again and again.

Great recipe...make it at least once per week. My modification is using Durkee's French Fried Onions on top instead of breadcrumbs. Simply top with the onions and bake.

Thanks for sharing your recipe.  It was really enjoyed.

I changed this to make it like my mother's recipe that I've had since I was a kid.  The changes are very similar to those others have made:  substituted a can of cream of chicken soup for the can of mushroom soup, added a 1/2 tsp curry powder, and used 1 cup of mayo (instead of 1/2).  I wasn't sure about the amount of chicken described in the recipe, but basically I bought 1.7lbs of boneless chicken breasts and it was perfect.  Husband and kids (5 and 9y) all absolutely loved it.

A co-worker used to have us over for lunch and served this and we all loved it. After reading all the reviews I also added teaspoon curry powder and used fresh broccoli cut into small pieces, stems and all. I coated chicken breasts with Montreal Chicken Rub and fried them in olive oil. I added two small chili peppers cut up and 1 orange pepper. My husband ate one chicken breast by itself and I cut the rest into small pieces. I also added breadcrumbs to the top and drizzled with melted butter. It produced a most heavenly crust. Some of my guests added fried onion bits to their serving. Only one complaint from a guest who thought the chili pepper was too hot but I love the extra kick. Definitely a keeper. This was my first recipe using the ingredient search tool and I love it.

this was so easy.  I used 2 cans of cream of chicken and added garlic salt & onion powder as suggested.  I also skipped the mayo and used milk.  i didn't measure the lemon I just squeezed an entire lemon into the bowl.  I used canned fried onions on top instead of bread crumbs.  It was delicious.  next time I'll add some red pepper to give it some extra kick.  My husband loved it.

This recipe was really quick and easy to make.  I made a few changes b/c of not having everything on hand that the recipe called for.  First, I only had a half a bag of frozen chopped broccoli left so I added frozen peas to make up for the missing broccoli component.  I didn't have any crm of chicken on hand so I used one can of crm of celery and one can of crm mushroom.  I think it  would have tasted even better with the crm of chicken though.  I also added some chopped garlic to the 'sauce'.  I used 4 bonless chicken breasts browned in oil seasoned with lemon pepper and cubed them and added them to the baking dish ( they were still raw in the middle, but I hate when chicken gets overcooked during baking).  This was a good, comforting chicken dish, but I do prefer my mother's chicken Divan.. i guess its one of those things where Mom always seems to make it better ;)  But all in all, it turned out well and tasted pretty good.  It would taste really good over rice!  I'll probably make this again b/c it was really easy and my husband said that he liked it.

Needed something to make with what I had on hand - this was a great find. I followed one of the other reviewer's substitutions, by using cream cheese instead of the mayo. I didn't have any lemon juice, but had some lemon seaoning that seemed to work just fine.

A great easy recipe, I gave it only four stars only because it seemed a little bland without the curry I add.  Now (with the curry) it's a family favorite.

I didn't like the Broccoli, but the chicken was ok, I thought the sauce was a little over the top in the fat department. I probably won't make it again, unless I can find a less fattening alternative...

My husbands favorite.  I add French Fried Onions in the last 10 minutes of baking...nice touch.  Also, I use Velveeta.  Melts better.

For easy preparation, it gets 5 stars.  But prepared as is, it's a good dinner... kids like it, husband likes it, it just doesn't WOW us.  However, I used Steamfresh broccoli (that steams itself in the bag from the freezer section) this time - and I feel like with that addition, it goes to 4 stars.  Just toss it in frozen, the end product is just fresher and more flavorful.

This was good, it was easy, it needed some seasoning though.  I will make it again, but it was pretty average.

I was looking for a chicken recipe that I could put together with the things I had left in my pantry.  I tried this and we loved it!!  I had a salad on the side and it was plenty - although you could always put it over pasta or rice and it would be good.  Will definitely make again and again!

Family loved it! My children are picky eaters but devoured it.  My three year old didn't even complain about the broccoli...now that's wonderful.  Quick and easy recipe the kids helped me prepared it.  I will definitely make it again.  I served it atop a bed of rice.  Delicious!

Very good but a bit bland.  Needs more kick to it.  I suggest using pepper jack soup as was suggested before(i couldn't find this soup at my local supermarket) or season the chicken beforehand.  This might have been because I used low sodium soups, I'll use regular next time, sautee the chicken in garlic and add some spices to the sauce.  Good otherwise though, even my picky sister liked it.

I think this is a great shortcut for Chicken Divan. I give it four stars as is, but five with some modifications: Use two cans of cream of broccoli condensed soup in place of the other two soups, and replace the mayonnaise with half a cup of milk. 
I also bake at 425 for 20 minutes if I'm in a rush.

I've never made regular Chicken Divan - so, I can't compare - but it wasn't quite what I was expecting.  It was edible - but I don't think it will make into my rotation.

The first thing we tasted was the mayo (not big mayo fans). After we got over that, it was ok.  My hubby is alergic to sour cream, so maybe we'll try half the mayo and some milk next time. Other than that, it was decent.

I made this for company and everyone seemed to like it. I found it a little too creamy though. Next time I might use less than one can each of the soups, or less mayo, or add chicken broth...something.

I didn't have any broccoli, so I substituted peas instead.  I saw from the other reviews that some thought it was too saucy so I used a 24 oz. bag of frozen peas.  Well, it was too much!  I made rice to go with it and there wasn't enough sauce to complement it.  I will definitely make this again, but use less veggies and maybe thin the sauce with milk like others' suggested.

Fantastic!! I made a few changes though, I didn't have any cream of mushroom soup so I just used cream of chicken. I added a little curry powder and garlic to the sauce. I also covered with grated cheddar cheese and parmasan cheese. I served it over plain rice and added ceaser croutons. Very nice, will use again and again :)

The flavor was good but it was too runny.  I followed directions too. I think it would have been better is I had of drained the frozen broccoli.

This is a nice comfort food for dinner. Brings back memories of Mama's broccoli casserole she made on the holidays. I recommend giving the recipe a try. It doesn't look like much in the dish, but the result will surprise you. I substituted milk for the mayonnaise and gave the dish a quick stir halfway through cooking time (you'll have to if you use frozen or it won't thaw.) It still turned out nicely. Thanks Shannon.

I don't know how this recipe was as written because I added curry, mushrooms and rice as suggested by other reviews.  I left out the mayo and added milk instead as also suggested.  I liked it just fine.  A full meal with the additions.

Made this for dinner tonight and my family enjoyed it very much!!! I followed the recipe exactly except adding mushrooms. The only changes I will make next time is adding garlic.  I think I will try this with shrimp as well maybe just using mushroom soup.  Thanks for the great recipe !!

This was pretty good. We made it without the mayo and it was still very creamy.  More broccoli and more chicken would make it better.
