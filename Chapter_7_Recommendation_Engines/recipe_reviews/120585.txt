This is so simple and quick and it uses 3 zucchini at a clip! Come August or September, that matters to me when I'm looking for zucchini recipes! The first time I made it, I found that it was very liquidy and required a lot more cooking time (25+minutes). I did use a very large shredder which sliced it thin and made each shredded piece about a1/2 inch wide.  Having more surface area may have caused more liquid to escape from it.  The second time, I added salt to it and put it in a colander to drain.  That made all the difference.  The cooking time on the recipe worked perfectly.  This is a very mild flavored dish that is almost quiche like in nature and flavor.  It was wonderful to have for lunches and when I gave my colleagues each a taste, they both wanted the recipe.  Other than using the shredder, I didn't change a thing; that just always seems unfair when people rate a recipe, but change the ingredients!

Very good and very easy!  A nice way to use zucchini.  At first I thought it hadn't baked long enough, but as it cooled a little it set up just right.

This is an easy and tasty recipe to use up zucchini. I grated the zucchini because it is faster. I microwaved the onion and oil for 4 min so the onion would soften. I used fresh basil, oregano and thyme. My husband really liked it! I will make again.

Love this recipe. Have been making for years.  3 Zucchini is approximately 4 cups.  Needs to be baked longer 45 min. to an hour till golden brown.  I have made using mini muffin pans, grated zucchini and baked for about 45 minutes.  Makes about 48 mini muffins.  Great for appetizers.

I needed something quick in the way of a vegetable dish for church and this recipe caught my eye.  It was fantastic and it was gone in no time.  Many of the people asked for the recipe.  It's easy to make and travels well.

I've made these for myself, but had never made them for church potlucks.  So, I made it for a church potluck.  Wow!  Did they ever go over well.  My pan was clean!  Now, I'm going to try it for Thanksgiving using egg substitute since I will have two heart patients at my house for dinner.

the batter was good; I was looking for something lighter than fried zucchini sticks and this is certainly so, even if it doesn't resemble zucchini sticks...I cut the zucchini lenghtwise and it was well all the same. All in all, I'll probably do it again.

I've had this recipe on hand for years, it's very good!  My recipe calls for garlic though.  For those who like garlic, add 4 to 6 cloves, minced.  I also use 1-2 tbsp fresh chopped basil instead of 1 1/2 tsp dried basil.

I've been making this for years - my grandmother gave me the recipe. Nice accompaniment for a summer bbq alongside ribs, or, if you serve rolls as a filler, try this instead. We use a smaller pan so they are thicker.

Recipe was excellent.   Instead of slicing the zucchini, I grated it.   MIght suggest making mini cupcakes for a quick snack.   I substituted garlic powder for oregano.   Just as good when eaten cold. Highly recommend

This is one of my favorite recipes and have been making it for years!  I normally use less oil and a little more Bisquick.  I add more onions and parmesan cheese.  It takes at least 40-45 minutes to get golden brown.  We eat if as an appetizer, side dish, breakfast or lunch - great at any temp.

This one is definitely a well liked one! I use shredded zuke though and I finely shop the onion. Delish! And a great way to use up some of that bumper crop!

This is an excellent recipe. I have made it for years, brought it to many potlucks, and it's always a big hit.  I add 2-3 serrano chilis (seeded and diced), substitute and add more chedder cheese, and bake for 35-45 minutes.  Sometimes, I increase all the ingredients and bake for longer. It's very flexible, feel free to add extra ingredients - I really like the kick from serranos, but mushrooms and sausage are also nice additions.

Loved this recipe, but I did change a few things. I used one cup shredded smoked gouda instead of parmesan, and added a cup of crumbled bacon. Also, I agree the zucchini should be shreaded. I used butter instead of vegetable oil, and gluten free bisquick. I had fresh basil, oregano and thyme (instead of parsley)from my garden. They were eaten immediately, and I was asked several times for the recipe.

This is a very good dish.  I did add red pepper flakes, but it would have been fine without them.  I grated the zucchini, and it was not too juicy -- in fact, the texture was perfect.

These tasted good but were a little more "eggy" than I'd hoped or was prepared for.  They also didn't make good finger food, which I was hoping.  Be sure to serve on a plate with fork.

I make these like crazy when the zucchini are in!  I serve them with drinks and the friends always ask for more. I use 1 cup flour with 1t baking powder in place of the baking mix. Bake a bit longer to brown.

THIS RECIPE WAS JUST OK.  I CUT THE OIL TO 1/3 CUP PER SUGGESTIONS THAT THE DISH WAS TOO OILY,  AND ADDED 1/2 CUP CHEDDAR CHEESE. IT CAME OUT A LITTLE THIN AND DRY.  MAYBE MY BISQUICK WAS OLD ?? TOOK TO A PARTY, AND THERE WAS NOT MUCH INTEREST.

This recipe reminded me of a childhood recipe my mom used to make....I doctored mine up a bit different though.  I did add garlic w/the spices as well.  I also added shredded cheese w/the grated parmesan....I used colby/jack.  Other than taking a little longer to cook (probably another 15 minutes due to the shredded cheese), they turned out yummy.  I would probably reduce the oil slightly next time if I add shredded cheese, since they turned out a bit greasy.  It's very close to my mom's recipe :o)

I thought this recipe was pretty good.  It seemed kind of like quiche.   Next time I will definantly add a little garlic or something, it was a little blah.

I like the shortcut of starting with the pancake mix.  I was expecting the herbs to give this more flavour and found it came up short.

This was very delicious.  I did add a little bit of zing with some pork chorizio, as zucchini tends to be bland.  We loved it.  It wasn't too good heated up in the micro the next day, so next time I will try to make half a recipe as there are only the two of us.
Additional comment: I accidentally rated this one star, but it should be five stars.

I've made this a couple of times now. Most recently for a party and everyone loved it. I also grated the zucchini. It was easier than slicing. The first time I baked it I thought is seemed to oily so I cut the amt of oil used in half and I preferred it with less oil.

Yummy--  At first I was afraid I had missed a step as I expected the batter to be thinner and to completely cover the zucchini like a quiche.  My pre-cooked mixture looked more like zucchini with some batter binding it together, but turned out perfectly.  It was fragrant and comforting.  Quiche-like, but seemed more healthy as you could actually see and taste the zucchini.

This is my favorite zucchini dish and side for the holidays! For additional flavor, try doubling up on the parm cheese using a full cup or using an additional 1/2 cup of grated romano cheese. With this addition, I always tend to bake it longer then the recipe calls for so that I can cut in squares to serve rather then spoon out.

WONDERFUL!  I made a HUGE batch of this for a group of adults, lots of teenagers and kids. It was cleaned out... couldn't believe would be such a hit with the non-vegetable-loving kids.  My mother, at 72 yrs., said was the best zucchini recipe she's ever had.
Thanks so much for sharing... FINALLY a great recipe to use up all that prolific zucchini!

I think this dish could be outstanding.  I substituted leeks which I sauteed w/some mushrooms prior to adding it to the egg mixture.  I thought it would have more of a biscuit taste, but it had more of a quiche taste.   Quiche is bland in my opinion unless you spice it up a lot. I prob would double the spice next time, add more cheese, and a little more bisquick.   I think I will try that next time to see how it all comes out.

These squares were very good. At first the zucchini looked like too much for the batter to handle, but it baked up nicely. A great side dish.

I sliced the zucchini very thin and it equalled a generous 4 cups. I used grated roman0 instead of the parmesan and dry parsley instead of fresh because that's what I had. Based on a suggestion from a reviewer I added a crumb topping made with a sleeve of ritz crackers and about a quarter cup butter.  It came out great, however next time I will only use half the cracker topping. I will also try grating the zucchini as suggested by a reviewer for a change.

This actually turned out much better then I thought.  I shredded the zucchini, and added some extra Feta cheese.  My wife really liked it and she asked me if it was a Soufflé.  I would really make this again as a side dish to a meal.  Thanks Anna.

These were fantastic! I prepared them according to the recipe with one exception - I baked them on the grill! I heated the grill to 350 degrees and placed the 9 x 13 pan (metal) right on the grill and baked them according to the recipe. One caution - make sure you keep your grill at 350. Great way to have this recipe when it's 100 degrees outside.

This was really good. I made it for dinner, but it didn't turn out like the picture, it was a little more puffier. I think it might be the biscuit mix I used. But it was overall really yummy!

My mother wanted an interesting alternative for Thanksgiving Dinner for use of Zucchini. She sliced the zucchini instead of chopping. They turned out ok but I'd be willing to give one more try slicing the zucchini differently. All in all it was very easy to do, no hassle extra for a busy dinner.

I think this is a solid recipe that is easy to adapt to one's personal taste. I ended up halving the recipe and made 12 mini muffins. They took 25 minutes to bake for me.  I did follow the advice of another reviewer and used more parmesan and added garlic. Very yummy!
