Very quick & easy appetizer to make. My family said it tasted exactly like a pizza. I served it with pita chips & fresh bread slices. I added a dash of salt & pepper to the ricotta mixture along with 1/2 tablespoon of dried parsley. The dip was very tasty but could use some spices. Next time I would probably add some minced garlic to the ricotta mixture and some fresh herbs on top, perhaps, basil and/or parsley.

This was so delicious! It was like eating a calzone as a dip! I made the recipe as written, but next time I will add some crushed garlic and red pepper flakes for a bit of spice just for personal preferences. I served with warm baguette slices. Will be making this recipe again for sure!

Being from Chicago I had to try this! It was fabulous and a nice take on Chicago Style Pizza with a lasagna type of twist. The sauce was very tasty. I made it exact except that I used full sized pepperoni. I served it with garlic bread. Will make again!

It was delicious. I didn't have the mini pepperoni, so I rough chopped regular size. I also made it with a can of prepared pizza sauce. I served it with a baked pizza crust -- from a purchased pre-prepared dough from my grocery store, baked like a focaccia bread. I put some olive oil and Italian spices on it before I let it rise a bit and baked it.
