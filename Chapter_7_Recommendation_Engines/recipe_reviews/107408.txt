Please note that this is 5 stars with no other ratings.   Between the 2 eggs and mayo (mostly eggs), the dish is more like an omelet than a crabcake. There are better uses for crab and shrimp.

I used fresh crab and shrimp left out the tarragon because I don't like the flavor. Also added corn. It was great!! Whole family and the neighbors enjoyed it.

Family loved it.  Used cooked shrimp chopped in food processor so not a paste.  Other than that followed the recipe.
