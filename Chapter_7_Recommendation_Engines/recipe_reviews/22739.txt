Do you eat this frozen?  Is it an appetizer or what do you serve it with.  Can't wait to try it.

This antipasto tastes just like the store bought kind found in gourmet shops!
Not only does it taste great, it's easy and fun to make!
Everyone begs for the recipe once they've tried it! Thanks Rayna!

This is one of the best recipes I have ever found.  People love it (unless they aren't olive fans) and everyone asks for the recipe.  It is great to have on hand, pull out of the freezer and serve.  I highly recommend it!

It will be good to know how to serve this dish after taking it out of the freezer. If it is stored in a large volume, should one use it all at one time? Is it possible to store in small portions and take one when needed?

This antipasto reminds me of what my friend's mom made for Christmas when we were kids. This is much easier to make and store-no fussing with canning. Freezes well and makes a great hostess gift for the holidays. Better than store bought.

This is a great recipe.  It tastes much like another I used to make that had 32 ingredients and involved canning.  This is the third year I've made this to use through the holidays. I freeze in mason jars and take one out when needed.  It is great with ritz crackers or sliced baguette.

I can't believe I found this recipe!!  It's an old family recipe that's been around for years.  

My only substitutions are omitting the green beans and adding a jar of hot gardenia mix.  

Great recipe everyone raves about and I never thought of freezing it....great idea!!

This was unbelievable! No changes necessary.
Should always make a double batch (especially if you intend to share), as you might greedily eat it all the first night!

This is awesome and super easy to make. I made it as the recipe stated. I read that some desired more vinegar, but I thought it was great as it is!! I also read that adding cauliflower was a good thing. I had a head that needed to be used, and I thought the added crunch would be good to. We loved it! We are a ton of it and still had some for freezing. The thawed stuff was just as good. I brought some to work with some crackers and everyone loved it. Thank you for sharing this!!

Great. Turned out looking and tasting exactly as I remember my mom's. I did add a dash more vinegar, but otherwise followed the recipe. Might add cauliflower and carrots next time. Thanks for the great recipe.

I hate changing recipes BUT from necessity tried a vegetarian version for Thanksgiving since several of the guests were vegetarians. I left out the tuna. Tasted wonderful anyway.  Also left out the cocktail onions. Otherwise the same. I served it with baguette slices from the grocery store (both plain and garlic flavored. This was a huge hit and so wonderful  to have waiting in the freezer!
