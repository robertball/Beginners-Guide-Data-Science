This is my favorite combo for dipping. The sweetness of the ketchup with the bite of the mustard really make the food POP with flavor.

Wasn't sure how I would like this but wanted to try it anyway. It was surprisingly good...didn't even need ketchup! Very good!

This is really good but I also add a teaspoon of creamy horseradish and if you aren't doing low carb a little sugar. Gives it a little kick!

I have been making this for years. I also do different variations one of my favorites is adding dill it's so good. Also try red pepper flakes or chipotle.

I made this dip with an addition of my favorite barbecue sauce Stubbs Barbecue Sauc". It was an excellent dip for fried green tomatoes. And an additional spicyness. I added some crushed peppers for that added kick.

Add some Splenda or equal and it makes a nice honey mustard. Great for parm crusted fried chicken fingers.
