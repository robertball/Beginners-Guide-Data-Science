Absolutely DELICIOUS!!  I wanted a soup recipe which didn't use a store bought soup and I found this recipe.  I followed the recipe as stated except I was out of milk.  I subbed  a 12 oz can (1 1/2 cup) evaporated milk in its place. To keep my flour from getting lumpy I used a small container and shook the flour and 1/2 cup of the milk together until dissolved.  Added the milk to the mixture, then the flour/milk to the pan.  Make sure you stir the mixture frequently so it does not burn in the bottom of the pan.  The evaporated milk really gave the soup body and additional flavor!!  It thickened up a little more than I like so I added an *additional* 1/2 cup of broth.  I topped with diced ham instead of bacon.

This was pretty tasty! It made two generous bowls of soup. There was no taste of vinegar in the final product. I had a little bit of leftovers and they tasted pretty good the next day! Thanks for the yummy recipe! Fianc√© says it's a keeper:-)

This is a great alternative to the really heavy cream-based potato soups. It was really good and light. I didn't have any milk so instead of the milk and flour I used plain nonfat yogurt which worked really well. I also mashed the potatoes just a bit before serving.

YUM!!! My husband and I love potato soup and this recipe is probably the best that I've tried. The carrots onion and celery really enhance the flavor. The addition of the vinegar seemed a little strange but I think it is an essential part of why this soup tastes so good! I did add a bit more seasoning--some ground pepper and garlic powder. Like one of the other reviewers I also used a potato masher to mash up some of the potatoes for an even creamier soup. In addition to serving the soup with the cheese and bacon I also sprinkled some chopped green onion on top. A deliciously hearty soup!

I changed the serving size a while ago and it said to add 7 1/2 cups Monterey Jack Cheese - WELL WORTH IT! The only thing I did different was to add more celery onion and carrot and added chives to the topping. Serve with Asiago Cheese Bread. This soup is OUTSTANDING!

This soup was EXCELLENT!!! I would call it GERMAN POTATO SOUP instead of potato soup XI. I didn't have any celery so I omitted it but next time will try it with to enhance the already delicious flavor. The secret ingredient is the vinegar

Very good and easy. The vinegar seemed like an odd addition but you could not taste it. I also added more carrot and celery and cut it into cubes. I added some shreadded colbyjack to the final few min. of cooking to thicken it up.

this was good. i really enjoyed the vinegar in this but i added onion powder garlic powder and instant potato flakes towards the end because i felt it was a little bland and thin for my taste. after the additions i liked it quite a bit. very good w/ homemade biscuits

I increased it for 16 servings as I have a large family. I also added a little season salt pepper garlic powder and chives for more flavor it tastes amazing. I also used red potatoes instead of regular russets and added real bacon bits in the beginning rather than the end. I will definitely make it over and over again.

It didn't work for me for some reason. There are white dots in the soup when I added the milk and flour mixture that are not getting absorbed. Hestitant to serve. Perhaps there should be more detailed instructions.
