Oh wow, this could get me in trouble! This was my first taste of Nutella.  It takes a lot of willpower not to dive into the jar!  We had these with sliced bananas and strawberries. Didn't bother to heat them since the crepes were warm from the skillet.  We dusted them with powdered sugar rather than whipped cream but I'll try that next time (and there will definitely be a next time).  What a treat!  Thanks for sharing!

I used a little heavy creme with the nutella to "thin" it out, and melted it in a bowl in the microwave first. This is the bomb with bananas!

Yum Yum Yum.  I did add the bananas to some of them, but the others I left without.  The crepes without the bananas I served with strawberries and whipped cream.  Also added a touch of chocolate sauce over the top...very pretty.  Thanks for the post.

Felt like I was back in Paris buying a crepe from a vendor! Actually like this better without the banana but good both ways.

Excellant treat!!!  Once I saw this recipe, I knew I had to make it right away.  I chopped up and spread my banannas and stawberries all over the nutella and it was soooo worth the (VERY) minor effort!  Will definately make again..and again :)

I bought the crepes because i've tried making crepes before and they are too difficult to turn. I made these crepes with bananas and added strawberry glaze as well. I had trouble with the nutella because it was to thick to drizzle as it shows in the picture, i added milk and warmed it up in the microwave to make it thinner, but it turned out thicker. Anyways they were very delicious, it tasted like a banana split minus the ice cream. Next time I will drizzle chocolate ganache.

These were very good! Though 1/4 cup nutella would be way to overpowering! I used around 1 tablespoon per crepe and thought it was perfect. I replaced half of the banana's with strawberry's. These made wonderful mothers day brunch desserts!

Good, but the Nutella flavor was too overpowering.  I would suggest cutting back quite a bit.  A quarter cup for each crepe is too much.

Wonderfully good! Thanks for reminding me about this easy dessert. I am from the south of France and make these slightly different. I put fresh cut strawberries inside a warm crepe, fold it up and drizzle warm Nutella over the crepe and then dust it with powdered sugar. Any fruit you choose can be used. Heavenly!

Fantastic.  I used quartered bananas in some and sliced sugared strawberries in others.  I did not use 1/4 c. Nutella in each crepe...just spread it on to cover each.  Topped with maple syrup or whipped cream...very good.

This is requested every single week.  Absolutely the best! I put all of the ingredients in the blender for smoother consistency, and less clean-up.

This was SO good! I did used the basic crepe recipe and then used this one as described, just without putting them back in a skillet to warm. My husband and I ate our fill and he's now in food coma... Man, are they worth it!

I just recently discovered the chocolate hazelnut spread (Nutella)....it is sooo good and very low in fat (if you can refrain from eating it straight out of the jar in one or two sittings.....!).  This is absolutely delicious.  Don't be afraid to make crepes, they are very, very easy, and versatile.

These were so yummy.  I used bananas with Jif Mocha Cappuccino Hazelnut spread and whipped cream on top.  DELISH!!  I would suggest not using as much spread inside.  Maybe 1/8 of a cup and chopping the bananas instead of slices.  Surely a keeper.

Wonderful crepes! Chocolate hazelnut with the fruit and slightly crispy crepe creates an unforgettable taste. I used store- bought crepes- which I'm sure are less good to homemade ones, but still taste good nonetheless- and filled them with bananas with strawberries. I found the medium heat was too high to heat for 90 seconds, I think medium low might work better. Wonderful recipe!

This reminded me of my trip to France a couple of years ago. Yum! I added a little cinnamon and vanilla to the crepe batter. Other than that, no changes!

so easy and fun to make, I used Nutella in a few and jam in the rest. I also used soy milk (from the basic crepe recipe), and I think using vanilla soy milk would give it even more flavor next time. great recipe!

Delicious, plain and simple! Great use of Hazelnut! Thanks so much! If you like crepes and hazelnut, try a Chocolate Hazelnut Crepini, its a mix of a French crepe and a Russian Blini.

These were awesome.  I reduced the Nutella to about 2 tablespoons per crepe because my husband does not like sweets and I was making breakfast for us.  He had nothing but praise for my efforts, thanks!
