This was a very good tasting veggie dish.  I used a butter spray instead of real butter with no complaints.  The snow peas were alittle stringy even though I tried to remove it, and quite chunchy. Will try sugar snap peas for next time. Maybe add some almonds too.  Flavor was very good. Will make this again.
