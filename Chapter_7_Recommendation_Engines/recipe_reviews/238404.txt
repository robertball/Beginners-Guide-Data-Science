This is fantastic. The grilled bread and at the vinaigrette are over the top with the fish. Made for company and they went crazy for it. Outstanding.

I did grill the bread, having sprayed with olive oil.  Cut in half all ingreadients except the cayenne pepper.  We loved the way the bread soaked up the balsamic juices.  Followed the recipe exactly using olive oil instead of grageseed on the fish...finawiz

I've been cooking fish for 30+ years. This is my all-time favorite recipe. Outstanding flavor and very easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't have cherry/grape tomatoes, just regular tomatoes. It turned out GREAT! The grilled bread adds a terrific flavor. My husband wants me to make it again and to try it with other fish.

I made this dish several times over the summer and keep coming back to the bruschetta vinaigrette and how delicious the juices taste absorbed into the bread. Chef John your dishes are winners!

Oh my, this was SO good!  The bruschetta really complemented the fish.  Hubby and I both enjoyed this.  So easy and quick too.  Love that.  And love Chef John.  :)  Another winning recipe, thanks!

This was awesome and delicious.  I omitted the bread and served over a fresh bed of Arugula. I added thinly sliced red onions to the sauce and used both red and yellow cherry tomatoes. I used more cayenne pepper to my liking. I did not have any grape-seed oil so I grilled the swordfish on a lightly oiled (canola) grill. Before grilling, I seasoned the steaks with lemon, salt and pepper. I served this with the Spicy Bacon-Wrapped Scallops from this site. Great recipe. Thanks for sharing.

OMG this was so good.  Relatively simple to make and just fantastic. I've never been a huge fan of swordfish but with this recipe I could eat it all the time (if it wasn't so darn expensive). I'm wonder what other types of fish could be used successfully for this recipe.Thanks Chef John for another great recipe.

This recipe was great!  I used two whole tomatoes, dried basil, and left out the cayenne pepper (personal preference).  We got a little side tracked so probably let it marinate for about 1.5 hours.  We did grill the swordfish, but I greased a baking pan with grapeseed oil and broiled the bread for a few minutes instead of grilling.  We used the tomato topping on the bread and on the swordfish, rather than putting all three together (it was just easier to eat that way).  My husband didn't care for the bruschetta/swordfish combination, but I thought it was phenomenal.

Excellent and easy dish.  Paired it with glazed Brussels sprouts from this same site for a wonderful dinner.

Very delicious! Made exactly as written and the bruschetta complimented the swordfish very nicely. Made this for my husband's birthday and he really enjoyed the fish with bruschetta on top of the grilled french bread baguette slices. I enjoyed the fish as well, but didn't have it with the bread. Served with Lemon Asparagus Risotto, also from this site, which paired nicely with this dish. A mixed greens salad would work well too for a side to the swordfish. Will definitely make this again! Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious! Didn't have any fresh basil and subbed a scoop of fresh pesto from Costco. Amazing.

A definite keepr!! I followed the recipe but wish I had grilled more bread as the combination of the sauce with the grilled bread is delicious.  Soaked up the extra sauce with untoasted French bread, good but better with the toasted bread.
