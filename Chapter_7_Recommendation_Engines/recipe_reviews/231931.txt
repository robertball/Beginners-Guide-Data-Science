I decided to make this because i was running out of things in the fridge... It came out AMAZING... but i winged it and substituted some things... WHAT I DID: COOKED @ 375 instead of 350 (based off of previous comments) and placed oiled/seasoned hash browns in oven after it was preheated and cooked them ALONE while i cooked the beef and did all the other steps... (about 20-25 mins, depending on how fast you work). While cooking beef i substituted onion powder for actual onions, cut into TINY little pieces (yellow onion) and also added salt and a tad bit of WORCHESTIRE sauce... I also substituted the gravy mix with ACTUAL gravy, because i didnt have the dry stuff.. so just used some beef broth (1 cup), flour, WORCHESTIRE (just a tad, like 1-2 tsp) and butter was my mixture i poured into beef after draining. after that just made it as usual, except I also put a couple tidbits of butter on top of mixture to melt into it and i cooked 20 MINUTES @ 375 then another 5 mins to melt remaining cheese... MMMMMM DELICIOUSSS... MAKE IT YOUR OWN :)

Quick meal to throw together. I would add a little extra pepper to the hash browns. I thought the hash browns still tasted uncooked but hubby had seconds. I will do this again adding extra cooking time or maybe cooking the hash brown layer a bit first before topping with the ground beef mixture.

I just finished having this for dinner, need I say it's All Gone.
I read some of the reviews so, I decided to take care of the hash browns  not being Cooked enough.
So while my oven was heating up to 350 I placed the prepared pan with  the hash brown mixture in it And left it in the Oven while cooking the hamburger mixture. I did add double the seasoning and added salt. It turned out Perfect !
I will be fixing this regularly. I'm going to share with my daughter in law that doesn't cook & my 2 single brothers.
It's Easy but good and filling.

This is really easy to make and tasty.  I did not have any gravy mix so used beef bouillon powder and flour to make the gravy.  Could add veggies or more spices to change it up a bit.

This was a big hit at a church luncheon, but I had to time the dish so that it was piping hot when I left for church. However, when the timer went off after 15 minutes, the hash browns on the bottom were barely even warm. I jacked the oven up to 375 on preheat and baked it for an additional 10 minutes. I will adjust the oven time to 25-30 minutes when I make it again--and again! When asked for the recipe at the luncheon, I replied that it would appear in our upcoming church cookbook--so they would have to buy a copy!

I have made this several times, once as written and more recently with several tweaks.. The first time it was pretty bland and the hash browns were undercooked. But with some changes it is one of my favorite weekday meals now.  

As others mentioned, the cook time is off.  I used a whole 2 pound bag of potatoes (that's enough to nearly fill a 9" X 13" baking dish) with olive oil, Italian seasoning, garlic powder and black pepper,  and began cooking it in a 375 degree oven while starting on the hamburger.  Finely dice a medium yellow onion and one or 2 jalapenos to add a little kick- or use a bell pepper if you don't want any heat. Cook with a dab of butter or olive oil until onions start to turn translucent, then add hamburger until brown. Drain grease....

Remove hash browns and add a cup of of Colby/monteray cheese before adding meat.

Here's where I went way off script. I didn't like the brown gravy/water flavor very much.  Instead I used a ranch dip mix packet, 1/3 cup of milk and a cup of sour cream. I combined that with the drained hamburger and spooned over the potatoes and cheese. Bake for another 15 minutes and add a cup (or 2) of Colby/Monterey cheese. Bake that just until melted. 

I love green onions so some of those  chopped up made a great addition sprinkled on top!

This was very bland the first time I reviewed it, even for my simple palate. I've tweaked the recipe, now giving it 4 stars. First, I used pre-cooked hash brown patties which eliminates the flavorless results when baking raw hash browns. No oil, & I added 1.5 oz. of real bacon bits to the ground beef mixture. I also crumbled the hash browns & microwaved them in a bowl. Doing that helped bring it to temp without overcooking the hamburger & gravy. I added a teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce & a tablespoon of minced onions (no onion powder) to the hamburger after it was done. I only had a 2 cup dry brown gravy packet, so I poked a few holes in the hash browns & added 1/4 cup or so to use some of the extra. Much more flavorful!

Good with some provisions! I cooked the hash browns prior to adding the meat mixture (@375 degrees)--all like previously suggested. Also added Worcestershire, ground mustard, and salt to the meat seasonings. Easy to make! Husband asked to keep it in the rotation.

very easy to make like everyone else says. I swapped out the gravy with cream of mushroom and it worked great. I would also recommend that the hash browns get cooked a little beforehand. They don't have to be completely done, but mine were a little on the raw side. 
next time, We'll probably add some eggs on top for a souffle type dish.

Very good..... I took some other reviewers advice and cooked the hash browns first and used more seasoning. I also replaced the brown gravy mix with country gravy. I thought it would go better with the cheddar cheese. 2 thumbs up

Everyone but one of my children loved this. I felt it was a little bland, will deffinately spice it up next time. And cook the potatoes a bit before adding everything else to it. They did not seem quite done to me. Over all a good recipe.

Dead simple and tasty. Good comfort food. Reminds me quite a bit of Shepherd's Pie, but upside down and without the veg.

This recipe was a little bland.
I used 
6 cups frozen hashbrowns, thawed
4 tbs veggie oil
1/4 cup fresh ground pepper
Mixed per recipe

1 1/2 lb ground beef
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/2 tsp onion powder
1/2 cup finely chopped onions
1/2 cup finely chopped pickles
1 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese
1 cup water
1 pack brown gravy mix

Preheat oven to 370.

Put pan with hashbrown mix into oven on center shelf while preparing beef mix

Add 1/2 tsp onion powder and 1/2 tsp garlic powder to beef and then brown and drain beef
Add 1 cup water and brown gravy mix.
Cook on low until water boils out.
Fold in chopped onion, pickles 3/4 cup cheese

Remove 9"x9" pan with hashbrown mix from oven.
Put hamburger mix on top of hashbrown mix.

Bake at 370 on center shelf for 20 minutes.
Remove and top with 3/4 cup mozzarella cheese.
Bake at 370 on center shelf for an additional 5 minutes.

I used a glass 9x9 in electric oven.
Metal pan may require more/less cook times.

Once finished cooking and topped with ketchup it tasted like a cheeseburger casserole with substance.

made it.  It did taste a little "flat" before cooking, so I added some additional Lowrey Seasons Salt.  Plus I cooked it a additional 15 minutes.   Very good, it is on my "make again " list.

I give this 5 stars after my "comfort food" adjustments ~ Brown the hash browns in a large skillet, adding cajun seasoning (I like Slap Ya Mama). Flip so they're well-browned on both sides.  Add to 13"X9" baking dish. Sprinkle with shredded cheddar.  Brown ground beef with medium chopped onion & small green pepper. Drain, if needed. Add 2 Tablespoons Worchestershire sauce, 1 T. dried parsley, 1 tsp. ground garlic pepper, add black pepper. Mix cream of mushroom soup with 1 pkg (mixed as per instructions) mushroom gravy mix, 1 cup half & half. Stir well. Add 1 qt. pkg (or 1 can) creamed corn.  Add to ground beef mixture, stir well. Pour over hash browns & sprinkle with shredded cheese. Cover & warm through in 350 oven. Delish!

I made way to many Bronco burgers. (from this site/appreciate they're awesome)  so I chopped up 3 patties and made this.  To die for.  The ingredients in the burgers (jalapeños, onions, steak sauce,  garlic etc)  made this phenomenal. I didn't really follow the recipe that well but everything goes better when you make it to your taste.  I like things spicy and the burgers were spicy so this made an awesome hash.  I wouldn't rip on the recipe poster so hard because he/she doesn't know what kind of hash browns you bought.  Cooked,  uncooked whatever.  It's pretty hard to mess this up if you just check on it.  Everyone should try it and if it's too bland for you spice it up!

I suggest precooking the hash brown crust without the oil.  I precooked the crust for 20 minutes at the temperature recommended on the packaging of the hash browns.   And instead of using a dry gravy mix, I substituted beef consume and corn starch for the water and gravy mix.  I also layered the cheese instead of folding into the meat mixture.  I (as I always do) added some more spices to the meat mixture.  In this case I used Clubhouse Cajun seasoning.  It was a quick  convenient meal and quite tasty.  I would make this again.

I'm not sure why this received 4 stars. This was very bland even after I added more black pepper and added salt. My husband only ate it after drenching it with A1 steaksauce and ketchup. I also added seasoning salt after it was cooked and that help start giving it flavor. It was too dry and seemed to be missing a creamy component like a cream of mushroom soup. I would not make this again unless I totally change the recipe. Oh and by the way I DID take the advice of others and cook for 30 minutes rather than 15 because the potatoes would not be cooked enough. Overall not a good recipe.

Went way off script for a Mexican flavour .... used Golden Hash Browns from Costco (the kind that come in a miniature milk-carton type container & you add hot water to, to rehydrate...)After rehydrating, I put in large bowl, added oil, 1/4 tsp black pepper, 1/4 tsp garlic powder, Worcester sauce, mixed well, patted into 9x12 glass baking dish, & put in preheated oven for duration of preparing meat mixture.In skillet, cooked chopped onion & diced red pepper, then added ground beef & cooked until browned. Added an envelope of taco seasoning mix & a cup of water; cooked until moisture evaporated. Then added large dollops of salsa sauce & continued cooking again for a bit to reduce fluid.Spooned half of meat over potatoes in dish. Added 1 cup of half cheddar and half mozzarella shredded cheese, simply because that’s what I had on hand. Added rest of meat & then baked at 350• for 15 minutes. Added another cup of “half & half” cheeses to top off, & baked for another 5 minutes to melt the cheese.This made a GREAT Mexican-type dish, & it went over exceptionally well with my family!

We added beef bouillon to the meat and added extra cheese.  It could use a little more seasoning for flavor, but we still enjoyed it after we added ketchup.

Delicious! I've made this a few times. Added my own little touches, but the base recipe is great. The brown gravy is a nice addition.

Loved it! I used cubed hash browns which worked fine. I added corn too. Definitely easy, fast and fairly healthy.

I was craving hashbrowns and beef, and found this recipe...I used real grated potatoes and onion soup mix in the ground beef. In the end, it was delightful, although next time, I will reverse the process, and toast my hashbrowns on TOP !! :)

I’ve made this twice. The first time exactly as the recipe stated. It was pretty bland, so the next time, I changed it up. I used one package of frozen hash browns thawed. I mixed in 1 stick of melted butter and seasoned with Nature’s Seasoning.  I spread this for bottom layer in a 9x13 Pyrex dish. Then I browned 2 lbs of lean ground beef with a chopped onion. I added one can of cream of mushroom soup, and one package of onion soup mix and 1/2 cup of water to the ground beef and mixed well. I added this to potato layer then covered with shredded cheddar cheese. Cooked at 350 for 30 minutes. It was better with these modifications, more moist and flavorful.

Quick and easy comfort food, especially if you need to throw together a simple ground beef casserole and don't care for the many recipes using cream of mushroom soup.  I used instant hash browns instead of frozen; the kind you soak in boiling water; and didn't have a problem with them being under-cooked.  I also used some chopped onion instead of the powder and cooked it slightly longer at a higher temperature as suggested.  It could use a little less oil.  2 tbsp is probably sufficient.

We loved this...although after reading the other reviews, I did tweak it a little.  375 degrees, for total 35 minutes.  I added salt and pepper, plus a half bag of frozen pepper and onion strips.   Yum!  Then I added pepper jack cheese to the cheddar to give a little zip.  I will definitely be making this again. I didn't  precook the hashbrowns, I just extended the cooking time.  it was a good decision for us!

Surprisingly, my family really liked this recipe. First, I precooked the frozen hash browns in a large skillet with some onions, olive oil, black pepper, and marjoram to speed up the baking process. I placed it in the bottom of a ceramic casserole dish. Then I added 50/50 ground beef and ground pork to the skillet, seasoned it with oregano, garlic, onion, and a little salt before adding the gravy mixture and cheese.  350-degree oven for 20 minutes did the trick since  I precooked the hash browns. Served with savory pickles and a tomato salad, this easy recipe was a success.

I added spices to turn it into a texmex version.
Seasoned the hash browns while I was stirring in the oil.
And seasoned the meat to spice it up.
Also I didn't have the gravy mix so I used a beef bullion cube in the cup of water and 2 tablespoons of Bisquick, because I didn't have any flour.
And I then added whole kernel corn.
It was MMM MMM GOOD!!!

the change i made was i added a half  cup extra of cheese to the meat and a half cup extra to the top of the dish for the last five minutes to add just a lil more cheesiness to it. i have two boys who like alot of cheese and it went over well i didnt have any leftovers. i will definitely be making this again.

This was good with changes.  I baked the frozen hash browns at 400 degrees for about half an hour, stirring every 10 minutes, until they started to get crispy.  I also added some seasoning - garlic salt, onion powder, and black pepper - to the hash browns for flavoring.   I followed the rest of the directions and it came out yummy.  Will make again.

it was a good idea, but it really was boring.  I was able to use up the hamburger and potatoes I had lying around the kitchen and that was the best part of the recipe.  Needed more spice and imagination.

This recipe turned out really well using dried browns that you toss in salted boiling water. No extra cooking like the other comments.  It went really well with seasoned green beans and I bet throwing in sauteed mushrooms would be good in the dish.  Black or pinto beans and olives and taco seasoning would be a good version as well!

This was... "just okay".  It took a lot of cheese added in to even get my husband to try it.  He called this a "she loves me not dinner".
