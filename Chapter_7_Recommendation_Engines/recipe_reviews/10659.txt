These are the best oatmeal cookies I have ever made! I separated the batter into two separate bowls and added dried cherries to one of them, a great treat and fun for the kids to eat!

I made only a few slight changes.  I was out of eggs, so I used a 1/2 cup applesauce instead.  I also added the smallest dash of vanilla extract and omitted the sunflower seeds since I did not have any.  These were *amazing* right out of the oven.  The apricots were still warm and the flavor was great.  They were still good the next day...soft, perfect texture (probably from the applesauce).

I really like these cookies, however it is for the out-side-of-the-box flavor they have. Every bite I take seems as though it's missing something. I will experiment with the recipe and see how I can really give it that pop.

I modified this recipe using suclarose in place of the sugar, egg substitute in place of the eggs, and flaxseed meal instead of the seeds.  It was very tasty!

I added 3/4 cup margarine instead of the 1/2 cup butter as the dough was much too dry and crumbly too work with.  Left out the sunflower seeds and added l cup of chopped apricots instead.  Next time I will add 1 tsp. of vanilla for flavor and will cut the flour down to only 2 cups as dough was still quite dry and cookies were a little on the dry side.  Will make again though, with the changes that I mentioned.

I made half a batch of these following the recipe to a T.  They are nice to eat with a cup of coffee in the morning because they are not too sweet.  I find that the first bite of each cookie is quite a surprise because of the sunflower seeds, which I normally like---just not in these.  I'll try this again but with slivered almonds, which would make more sense to me.  I'll try them again with that change.

Odd as they may be, these we really a hit! These were moist and chewy; the flavors are a great twist on a basic oatmeal cookie.  As usual I used a combination of white spelt and whole spelt flours instead of wheat. Following reviewers advice I cut back on the sugar using 3/4 c. white and 1/4 c. brown and replaced an egg with applesauce. Also added cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla. I forgot to flatten my test batch before they went in the oven but it worked out great so I didn't do it to the rest. I ended up with nearly 48 cookies! These freeze well, they still taste great.

This was good, but I think too sweet and bland.  Maybe more cinnamon (I used 1 tsp) and some nutmeg would help? I only put in 1 2/3 c sugar but next time I will try maybe 1 c.  I only used 1 egg and I added 1/2 c unsweetened applesauce.  I didn't want to hassle with chopping dried apricots so I used a pre-chopped dried Tropical Fruit mixture.  I baked on wax paper for 12 min, but my cookies were bigger than 1" balls (I just dropped 2" blobs on the cookie sheet.)  The batter was just right, the cookie held together well and was a little chewy.  Not sure where the crisp part came in??

Yum! A very wholesome and tasty cookie! I modified this a bit based on what I had on hand. I didn't quiet have 1/2 cup butter, so I added some unsweetened applesauce. I didn't have sunflower seeds, so I used flax seeds. I used white wheat flour and added some vanilla extract and a few dashed of cloves for some added flavor.

It's unfair of me to rate this because I changed it so much, I took advice from others and added cinnamon, and nutmeg, I reduced the sugar, and used fresh apricots. Since I used fresh apricots, I would probably double the amount of apricots next time, you couldn't taste them, they got mixed into the batter too much.I only added 3/4 cup white sugar, and 1/4 cup brown sugar, next time I will add 1 cup white, and 1/2 cup brown, just not quite the 2 cups it calls for. GREAT cookies, thank you!!

This is delicious! I made with Almonds and Apricots. I also used a banana as a substitute for egg and they turned out to be a perfect texture and complimented flavors well.

it was way too dry no flavor and I ended up adding a bit of maple syrup to the remaining batter which made it a little better. I would not make these cookies again

These cookies were good, made almost as stated. I did cut the sugar to 3/4 c white & 1/2 brown, this was sweet enough. Some were almost crunchy on the outside but I wouldn't say crisp. I will probably make again as I have more apricots and sunflower seeds to use up.

5 stars from my husband!  I did cherries and almonds instead of apricots and seeds, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Will also be trying the original flavors soon (just didn't happen to have apricot at the time).  The only minus is that this dough is hard to work with, since it's so crumbly, but the taste is out of this world.

Very good cookie. I made them without the sunflower seeds and they were perfect. Used quick oats.

Good, but little more than an oatmeal sugar cookie. The half cup of apricots was insufficient. I would double it.
