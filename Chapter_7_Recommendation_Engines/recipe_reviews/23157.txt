I rubbed the turkey down with butter, sprinkled with paprika, put the apple, sage and rosemary on the inside, and the celery and onion in the bag, and was WONDERFUL!!!  I don't even like dark meat, but the flavor was so great, I ate it too!

I have used this recipe for years. It is so easy, cleanup is a breeze, the Turkey stays very moist, and you can cook it longer,and not dry it out. I have made it stuffed, and without stuffing. great both ways. my family just loves it, and I usually get invited to cook the bird, even if we are the guests.

My mom has made turkey this way for years and now I do too.  We put garlic powder, onion powder and paprika on the skin the day before.  It never dries out and it can be left in longer if you need some more prep time for your other dishes.  Cleanup is a breeze!

this is a fool proof recipe; you don't think it will brown in a bag, but it does and its always moist and delish. I make it this way every year and its always a hit!

With this recipe, I got the most juicy, yummy turkey I have ever tried in my life.
The cooking time was short, a 20 pound turkey in 3 and a half hours, and the clean up was easy.
I definately recommend this recipe to first timers and also anybody else who wants to have a tender, juicy turkey meat.
I will only use this recipe for my turkey from now on.

My 18 pound turkey was done to moist perfection in just over 3 hours. I was surprised that the skin actually browned pretty nicely. The only change I made to the recipe was to spread the turkey breast skin with about 2 tablespoons of butter before putting it into the oven bag. I had a LOT of fat to skim off the juices before making my gravy, so I'm not sure how good an idea it was, or if it was needed.

First time I've ever made a turkey in a bag and it was very moist and flavorful and browned beautifully.  I cooked a 13 lb bird at 350 degrees and it took 2-1/2 hours.   I cut a large onion in quarters and a bulb of garlic in half and stuck it in the turkey cavity as well as seasoning the cavity with salt & pepper.  You don't need to even peel the onion or garlic - just cut it and put it in the cavity. This will give the drippings a great flavor and help infuse your bird with flavor.  I also carefully lifted the skin from the breast and liberally massaged the raw breast with a mixture of softened butter with some garlic powder, dried parsley, & rubbed sage.  I then rubbed the same mixture over the entire bird before I bagged it and sprinkled with coarse sea salt.  Rubbing butter over the breast will help keep the breast meat moist and flavorful.  You can use just butter or any combination of seasoning you like added in.  Just be careful not to tear the skin.  I also let it rest about 20 minutes or so in the bag after I took it out of the oven.  I plan on using this bagged method in the future because it really did help keep the bird moist and no basting!

I have tried this recipe and it really works!! Another thing I added was a half apple with thyme & rosemary tied onto it and stuffed into the cavity, instead of the stuffing.  It made the turkey extremely succulent.  And so easy!!!

I'll never cook a turkey any other way!!  This was the 1st year I used a bag an it was super easy.  Just put it in the bag and forget about it until it's time to come out!! If you sprinkle paprika over the turkey, it helps to even the browning.  I'd recommend this to anyone, novice or pro.

My mom always used a bag, and so do I.  A few things I've learned:    Don't use a bunch of butter.  In fact, you don't need any.  You will end up with drippings unfit for gravy.  Don't go crazy cutting holes in the bag.  It defeats the purpose of the bag.  (yes, vent it, but sparingly.)  You can stuff the turkey if you want, but it increases the cooking time and you risk drying out the bird.

In 20 years of Thanksgiving dinners,I've never had a bad Thanksgiving turkey when using these bags. Browning has not been a problem for me, I brush the whole turkey with melted butter beforehand and I haven't needed any colorants. In fact, I sometimes still have to put a little foil tent over the breast about 2 hours into the cooking, to keep it from over-browning. The largest bird I've bagged was 22 pounds and the hardest part was the heavy lifting. I use a few tricks to get a turkey that size into the bag. I spread a very clean old towel over my work surface, which protects against juices drooling over and contaminating things, and also reduces slipperiness. I slide the bag halfway over the turkey, baste that half with butter, then pull the rest of the bag over the turkey, reach in, and baste the rest. I reach in again and spray the top of the bag with non-stick cooking spray, which prevents any sticking to the skin. I put a little chopped onion, celery, apple, and rosemary in the cavity. This year's 21 pounder was done in a little over 4 hours at 350 degrees. I really like that the juices and drippings don't evaporate and are perfect for the gravy. I'm definitely a bag fan.

WATCH YOUR TIME!  My husband and I have used this method for the last 3 years.  By far the best turkey we have ever had and we continue to get rave reviews about it.  Here is our secret: Thaw turkey for 5 days in fridge.  Follow direction as stated above (although we use stuffing and fill the bird within and inch or so of top of cavity).  Put 6 slits in the bag. When it comes to timing We usually have a 16lb bird that we cook at 350 for 2 hours and 15 minutes.  When the time is up we take it out of the oven and put the lid of the roasting pan on it. The turkey serving platter then sits on top.  We leave it on the counter for 1 hour and 15 minutes.  Even then, when we go to take it out of the pan, it is too hot to touch with bare hands. Snip the corner of the bag as someone is holding the bird up to get out juice for gravy.  Carve up the bird and enjoy!

This was amazing!  Cooked a 20 lb bird for  3 1/2 hours - temp got to 190. We stuffed the cavity with sliced apples and onions, in addition to adding onions and celery to the floured Reynolds bag.  We rubbed the bird with softened butter, and seasoned with salt, pepper, and garlic powder.  I don't if this helped, but I accidently cooked the bird breast-side down, and the breast was nicely browned, CRISPY SKIN, and as juicy as I've ever eaten.  My mom is the best cook I know, and this blew away anything she's ever made for Thanksgiving!  Without question, this was the best turkey I've ever had (including deep-fried), and I will never do turkey any other way again.

I made a 14 pound turkey using this recipe for a large group of people and I could not have been more pleased with the results. The only thing that I did differently was that I took a stick of butter and rubbed the turkey down both under and on top of the skin, then threw what was left into the turkey cavity. I then sprinkled the whole turkey with salt, pepper, and dried sage and put the onion & celery both in the cavity and around the turkey. Also, it only took TWO hours and fifteen minutes to cook, resulting in a perfectly moist and delicious turkey. If you are unsure of how long your turkey will need to cook, you can always look on the Reynolds (oven bags) website for their recommendations.

I want to like this, so much. It's how my mother in law makes turkey and all I can taste is the bag. The skin is soggy and the turkey always overcooks, no matter how much we adjust the time. 

She's made this recipe with me, many times and loves it, but I can't warm up to it. Sorry.

Beware...your turkey will cook quite a bit faster in the bag.  I had a 15 1/2 lb. turkey and it was done in 2-1/2 hours.  I noticed how quickly it was cooking and lowered the oven temp to 325 and still it was that fast!  My turkey was brined which also speeds the cooking process.  I spread a mixture of butter, olive oil and spices under the skin of the breast and over the entire turkey.  The bird brown browned nicely.  I was concerned at first because I had tons of drippings in the bag but they weren't nice and carmelized like they are when you roast without a bag but I just added a bit of Kitchen Bouquet browning sauce to my gravy and it was wonderful!  Great result.  Next time I'll turn the oven temp down to 325 and plan for a much quicker cooking time.

Also, if you don't carve it at the table, cook the turkey upside down.  The breast meat seems to keep so much moister that way!

This is the way I've made my turkey for years! It is absolutely the only way to go!! It's easy, cooks evenly and faster and clean-up is simple!! The first year I used a bag, (i was 18), I forgot the flour...it will blow up the bag without it! :) I add celery, carrots, onion or whatever I use that year; apple, pear, cranberries etc. salt, pepper or whatever you like and in a few hours have a beautifully browned turkey! Happy Thanksgiving!!

After I brined my turkey, i used this recipe! I did put an apple inside along with celery, onion, salt and pepper.  SO MOIST and TENDER...yummy TO BRINE: rinse turkey and sprinkle Kosher salt inside and out of turkey, in a large stock pot dissolve about 1/4 cup salt and 1/4 sugar (i eyeball it) in about 2cups water, then place the turkey in pot and fill up pot with water, try to cover turkey with water, place in refridgerater for 12-24 hrs. Then rinse turkey and pat dry and then proceed with this recipe****You will NOT be dissapointed*****

Using the bag makes the turkey juicy every single time. Also to completely enjoy moist turky put it breast side down for the majority of cooking and at the last 45min or so remove from bag and turn right side up to brown the top a bit.

One trick to a moist turkey in a bag (as long as you are going to carve it before you put it on the table as we do in my famly) is put the turkey breast side down before you bake. It sits for hours in it's own juices and that's the part that dries out the fastest. I have never had such moist white meat!!! It's not as pretty but totally worth it!

The first year I used the bag, I mistakenly put it in breast side down, and stumbled upon the juiciest way to make turkey ever.  Now we do it that way every year!

I've also been cooking my turkey like this, I do however quarter a red apple and a vidalia onion, sprinkle them with sage and place inside the cavity. I use celery salt and fresh pepper mixed with my flour in the bag. Turns out perfect every time!

I have been making my turkey this way for years!  Turns out perfect every time!  I do season the inside & outside of the bird liberaly with salt & pepper.  Smear butter under the skin & on top.  Makes for the best gravy (most fat removed).  I love that I can prepare it the night before, & pop into the oven the next day.

This is the best way to cook your turkey. Been doing this forever. Same recipe in turkey bag container. Tried cooking turkey open in oven once and was not as good. I do put olive oil on skin first so bag doesn't stick to turkey. You can also cut slit on top of bag for periodical basting but not necessary. I do it because I learned it from my Mom and she is the best cook ever!lol Definitely save the juice for gravy, best you'll ever make....

Conventional Turkey Oven bags are OK, but if you want a bird that does not taste like it has been 'stewed'...try my tip.  Take a large brown craft paper bag..(without any inked priniting on it)...and 1 lb of very soft butter..grease the inside and outside of the bag heavily...then butter the outside of the stuffed bird...(does not take a full pound)...I prefer a 12 pound bird free ranger. Slip the bird into the bag (this is always fun)...and tie the end of the paper bag securely with butcher twine..set on a rack uncovered in a 'large' roasting pan and pour in 31/2 - 4 cups of water or chicken stock.  Pan liquid should not touch paper bag. Roast this 'bagged' bird for up to 4 hours in a 350 degree oven...checking hourly to ensure the pan does not dry out totally, and add to the liquid as required. No basting ever required using this method! After 4 hours (pan liquid should be then be minimal)..take out and the paper bag will easily lift off...put stuffed bird on platter cover with foil, and begin to make your gravy...I like to add a prepared Knorr Swiss Poultry or Turkey package to the pan juices to further enhance the drippings that do accumulate in the pan liquid......it sounds odd...but I have done this 3 times a year for about 20 years! To rave reviews!  Effortless really...and you have a perfectly roasted 12 lb bird.

OMG!!! This was the best tasting and juiciest turkey I have ever made!!! I mixed about 2 tablespoons of butter with a little olive oil and added fresh chopped sage, rosemary, smoked sea salt and pepper and rubbed the entire turkey with it. I also rubbed this mixture up under the skin of the breasts. I then cored and quartered an apple and quartered an onion and put them inside the bird. I put the turkey in the bag, laying breast side DOWN, on top of the stalks of celery and onions in the bag, poured a bottle of hard apple cider over and in the bird, put it all in the roasting pan and cooked my 12 pound bird for only about 2 hours in a 350 degree oven!! After it had cooked for about an hour, and was lightly browned on the bottom, I then turned it all over, breast side up so the breasts would brown. WOW!!!! So juicy and tender. The meat just wanted to fall off the bones.
I will never cook my Thanksgiving bird any other way.

I have been using oven bags for a long time. The first time was a pot roast that a neighbor brought over for us to just pop into the oven.  We didn't know to poke holes in the bag. It swelled up to fill the whole oven but didn't burst. The food was great. So when I started using them for turkeys, I only poked one little hole in the bag instead of the recommended 5 or 6. The bag swells up a bit, causing a little pressure inside. The bird cooks even faster and is more juicy. Bags are much more forgiving than other techniques. Better for inexperienced cooks. Two things to be careful of: 1. try to keep the bag off the bird. The skin tends to stick if it does. 2. Make sure that you use the lowest rack on the oven so there is plenty of room on top so the bag doesn't come in contact with the roof of the oven. Especially if you use the one small hole technique.The hole could plug up if it hits the top of the oven.

Made this for Thanksgiving with a 21 pound Turkey. I actually over cooked it and burnt the skin (due to a broken thermometer) and it was still juicy and yummy! My grandfather who hardly ever comments on food said it was the best he'd ever had! I added butter under the skin prior to cooking it. I also added butter, celery, onion, and apples on the inside. Thanks for a great recipe!

I have made turkey like this for 6 years now.   My guests always rave about the moist turkey.   Plus, you don't need to get up at 5 am to make a turkey and stay by the oven for 1/2 hour bastings.   It is done perfectly and tastes great in no time!

I have been cooking my turkey's in a bag since forever.  I actually cook mine upside down (breast down) and it ensures super juicy turkey every time!  The last 20 minutes or so I turn the bird right side up and let the breast brown and it is the PERFECT turkey!  I also always cut slits into the skin and insert butter.  I have used bags and I use different seasoning every year for some variety.  Italian seasonings with garlic cloves, orange and cranberries and other ways.  Bag roasting your turkey is the best way to go!

This is the best way to cook turkey...ever!  Some may argue it's "steaming not roasting" but I say "who cares?" the end result is a moist flavourful bird, and stock that will make gravy that will knock your socks off! I find if you rub the breast (under the skin) with a combo of butter and olive oil and whichever herbs you prefer..I like just sage and thyme, it will really bring out the flavour of the turkey.  It took my 11 pounder just over 2 hours, then rested it for 30 min.  Awesome. The last few times I've done this I've added a couple of cups of champagne to the bag...improves the flavour of the gravy (if that's possible!!).  Love this recipe, no fail!

I brined my turkey for 24 hours beforehand and then cooked it with sage, apple and chestnut stuffing, bastingit occasionally with maple syrup in a bag as directed. It was the JUICIEST most amazing turkey I have ever had. Thank you! I opened the bag up for the last 20 minutes to brown it.

Love this!  I will never prepare a turkey another way!  When I pulled the turkey out of the oven, it looked like the turkeys on the covers of home magazines!  Perfectly golden, and even the white meat was moist and tender.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe, it will be in my favorites file!

Have been using cooking bags for years & years. It's the only way to fix turkey. I don't stuff it (we do cornbread dressing) but apple, onion, fresh sage and other herbs inside and fresh herbs and butter under the skin give you a moist and well seasoned bird.    If you've never used a cooking bag & don't know where to buy them. You can find them with the aluminum foil and plastic wrap. They are made by REYNOLDS, at least that is the only brand I've ever seen. They make turkey sized bags and smaller sizes too.

This was so good! I accidentally cut big slits in the top of my bag and I think it worked out great because my turkey look roasted. The skin was crispy and dark. It was a beautiful turkey.

Why do y'all still cook to 180? That's old info. A turkey farmer told me that 160 is good, and the official word by the  USDA is that 165 in the thigh (not less anywhere) is safe

I always cook my turkey in a brown paper bag. It gets nicely browned, is very moist because it gets steamed, and takes less time to cook. I rinse my bird inside and out, dry with paper towels, run some vegetable oil in the cavity and rub oil all over the outside, salt inside and out, then rub butter inside and out. Then I put the stuffing into the cavity. Next, I run some oil around inside the paper bag to oil all of its sides. Finally, I put the turkey in the bag, staple it shut, and put into my roaster. Into the oven it goes. Depending upon its size, it can take up to 45 minutes less time to cook. Be very careful opening the bag because the steam is very hot. I just start to tear the bag away from the turkey slowly to release the steam. Once you try this method, you will never cook a turkey any other way! This works for whole chicken too.

This was my second attempt at a turkey for my dorm's second annual Thanksgiving.
This recipe was incredibly easy, and the turkey came out super moist and juicy. I added a little bit of extra celery, onions, some fresh minced garlic, and half an apple diced inside, and put the other half of the apple in the cavity. Also, since the turkey wasn't as brown as I'd liked about 30 minutes before serving I opened the bag, spread paprika, butter, and a little flour and let it brown for a little longer. I definitely would recommend this recipe.

OMG, I will never make my turkey another way again.  This came out perfect.  I followed the recipe and seasoned it with garlic powder, Galena Street chicken rub seasoning and paprika.  I then lightly sprayed the turkey with butter flavored cooking spray,I had an 18 lb bird and I cooked it for 2 and 3/4 hours.  It came out browned, juicy and extremely tasty.  This was the best turkey I ever made and clean up was a breeze.  Loved this recipe.

Delicious!  I added a quartered apple and some sprigs of fresh thyme and rosemary to the cavity. Also rubbed the bird with butter and put some pats of butter between the meat and skin on the breasts. Sprinkled some salt, pepper, a little garlic powder and,paprika. It cooked for 3 hours for a 13 lb bird. Very moist!

My mother also used the cooking bags for use and now I always do. It cuts the roasting time, and you can stuff the bird or not. I like to rub the skin with butter, season it, and sprinkle paprika on it.

I've used this method for years. I rub the bird down with oil, then massage in powdered herbs, salt & pepper. I place an apple, orange & onion in the cavity. I also make a bed of diced aromatic vegetables and herbs (about 2-3 cups, they cook down), including a diced turnip (yes!), then place the turkey on top inside the bag. It produces several cups of intensely flavored "essence".  After every other "magic" method of turkey roasting fell flat, I returned to the "bag", and have always had a moist, delicious golden brown turkey every time.

I seasoned my 15 pound turkey with melted butter, seasoning salt, garlic powder, and ground pepper then stuffed the cavity with 3 stalks of celery and one small onion and cooked it for 3 hours.  It came great!  The breast skin was brown, but not crispy.  I was happy that the breast was moist and not dry like it always is without using a bag.  By stuffing the cavity with celery and onions and using a bag, there was quite a bit of juice created for the gravy.  I'd use the bag again even if the skin doesn't get crispy for the fact that clean up was so easy and the turkey was very moist.

Anything you can cook in a cooking bag is going to be very moist and tasty. And the cleanup is awesome.
I have done roasts, ham and chicken and it all is very good.

I have used this method of cooking turkey for years,  I have xcooked a 20-25lb turkey in this way and they have always turned out great.  We have both white and dark turkey eaters and no one is ever disappointed!

I've been doing this for years, mainly due to the shortened baking time.  Yes, best way to go.  I don't add the celery or onions either, and I stuff the turkey.

This is the first turkey I've ever made and it's definitely fool proof!  I did put an apple inside like someone else suggested.  Soooo good and it made me look like I knew how to cook a turkey.  Double bonus!

THANK YOU, THANK YOU!!! My husband loved this turkey, said it was the best turkey he ever had. he eat all the left overs. It was juicy, moist and tender. I will be cooking all my birds this way from now on. I have been cooking for 30 years and have never heard of cooking a turkey in a bag. It was the best turkey my family ever had on Thanksgiving. If I could give it 10 stars I would.

A never fail recipe!  Absolutely delicious!  I only use 1 tablespoon of flour in the oven bag and I rub the skin with canola oil before baking.  Highly recommended!

I cook out turkey this way every year. The turkey always comes out moist, even if it's in for longer than directed!
I usualy just add the flour to the bag, salt and papper the bird and butter it.

First Time I cooked a turkey and it turned out great! I brined it for over 12 hours (garlic, honey and wine) then put garlic butter under the skin. I had a 12 pound turkey and it cooked in 2 hours! was really juicy.

This was so simple! The turkey was incredibly moist and full of flavor. My turkey was 10.5 lbs and cooked in 2 hrs. The meat was falling off the bone. Mmmm I don't think I'll make turkey any other way! Thanks for the suggestion!

Absolutely fool-proof! My first turkey ever, and it was a success thanks to this recipe =D   For fellow beginner, the turkey takes 3 days to defrost, and 10 hours to brine, which makes it stay moist and full of flavor.  Good Luck!

I have used this method for over 30 years and will never cook a turkey any other way. I use some butter and sprinkle seasoned salt on it which helps the browning of the skin.  I also stuff some apples and onions in the cavity for extra flavor. I don't understand why more people don't use this method.

This was a good recipe.  Your basic turkey.  I did add paprika onto my turkey to give it a browned look.  I got lots of compliments on the taste.  I did a 15lbs turkey for three hours, I let it rest for about 30 minutes before I served it.

This was my first attempt at a turkey dinner. It was easy, not at all as hard as I thought. Hardest part was defrosting my frozen turkey overnight. I put half an apple in the cavity (picked up from another reviewer), and buttered up the beast along with salt and pepper to taste. Turkey came out great, it was moist and flavorful, I used a convection oven along with a probe to cook turkey to the right temperature (I used 184 degrees)  and it finished in about 2 hours 45 minutes.

My stepfather has been cooking turkeys in a bag for as long as I can remember so when it was finally time to do my own well this was the recipe I chose.  I grabbed a cheap remote thermometer that you leave plugged into the turkey which made figuring out when to pull it out very easy.  For my first turkey I was very happy to hear people saying "wow this is really good and moist."

Perfect :) I rubbed the turkey with butter then seasoned with salt and pepper. Also added a quartered apple into the cavity of the turkey.

This is definitley an easy way to do a turkey - or pork or  beef. I have  used this same method for  years. I stuff my turkey lightly and  it  looks so golden and pretty when done....and its  very moist!  It also cuts down baking time.

This is a very simple recipe, as is.  No need to add butter as it is incredibly moist and very tasty. Very easy to clean up, and the oven stays clean.  Simple, simple, simple.

Wow!! Hands down best, most moist and tasty turkey ever!! I coated the turkey under and outside the skin with a paste of butter, garlic salt, onion powder and pepper, then put it in the bag with celery and onion. A 14 pound turkey done in just over 2 hours. AMAZING!

I always cook my turkey in a bag, with rosemary, garlic and butter. It ALWAYS turns out incredible. You can even add a little of the McCormick's Turkey Rub. Just follow the directions for poundage on the packaging.

I've made my turkey in a bag for years and it really keeps in the moisture.  I also rub it down with butter and red wine before putting it in the bag, and I place a whole onion (peeled), and apple or orange (not peeled) inside the turkey, this also adds flavor and keeps it moist.

Only way to make a turkey!!! Use the oven bag from R**ynolds.  Started 26 years ago, making the turkey as a newlywed for his family....yep, his family gave me the turkey to fix...blew their minds that I could fix one that was so good.

This is the only way I make turkey! I follow the instructions on the bag box and it's always perfect! I have considered doing my turkey without a bag, but then ask myself why? I've never had a turkey that didn't turn out beautifully browned, succulent and delicious! And there is always plenty of yummy juices for gravy! =)

At 39ys old this was only my third time cooking a turkey on my own and I felt the need to look up how to do that.  This recipe was the simplest yet very tasty making me successful in being the chef of the day.

Only way to make a Turkey! I have roasted it and it is much moister with this method. No need to change a thing and it will be great. For fun, I stuffed with fresh thyme, tarragon, garlic and celery and seasoned with garlic powder. I added one cup of chicken broth into the bag to make more gravy. But, this was for a twist. The recipe is delicious as written. Also, the turkey does brown with this method. If you want it browner, cut bag open last 20 min of cooking, but it was brown enough for us. Let turkey rest and hour before carving and remember to carve the chicken breast against the grain. Enjoy!

Made it today -- totally AWESOME.  Just what I was looking for: Tender turkey that comes out like a supermarket deli chicken, soft, tasty, and juicy.  I ate the wings before I was even done carving, and it was Turkey Heaven!  I made a 23-pound bad boy, and thank goodness I listened and put the half dozen 1/2-inch slits on the TOP of the bag, not on the sides or near the bottom at ALL, because a turkey on the big side like this one made SO MUCH JUICE/BROTH that it came up almost HALF WAY up the side of the turkey.  On the loweset rack at 350 (like the Reynolds bag said), the liquid was literally bubbling and rolling.  Also, I put the whole thing in the bag UPSIDE DOWN, to make sure the breasts were basting in the juices.  They were SO SOFT.  I followed the Reynolds bag directions, not the turkey wrapper directions, and they were spot on in that a 24 pounder took exactly 3 hours.  I never thought it would be THAT fast, thought maybe 4-5, but Reynolds was right.  It made so much broth you would have an abundance of gravy for every meal or sandwich you can make out of it, or do like I did and save big chunks of meat in freezer bags with the broth for a delicious turkey soup with carrots and egg noodles, etc. Still had 2 big chunks left for 2 Jennie-O size boneless size roasts, and two tupperwares full of two full meals a-la Thanksgiving style (with the leftover sides and trimmings).  Used 2 red onions, 4 celery ribs, salt/pepper/sage/2 Tbls butter rub. IT'S A KEEPER! (see pic)

My sister has been using this method for years and her birds come out very moist but not always so flavorful. So I used this method, cooking just as directed, but I stuffed it with an onion, celery, a head of garlic, and bunches of rosemary, thyme, and sage. Like my sister, I also put butter and herbs under the skin, salt and peppered the outside before pouring butter over it. And I added some paprika to help with the browning. So good! The meat had a lot of flavor, was super moist, and it browned well... on top. The bottom was something to hide; it looked how one may imagine Santa's rear... But yea, big hit. Great method. And it only took 2.5 hours for my 12 pound turkey.

First time hosting Thanksgiving for my in-laws. I'll tell you how I did it, for any other first time hosts :) 21lb. frozen turkey, thawed it in a pan in the refrigerator for 3 days. Soaked it for 2 hours in 1 3/4 cup of Kosher salt and enough water to cover the bird. Rinsed off very well and dried with paper towels (a lot!). Rubbed EVOO, garlic powder and onion powder all over the outside, inside cavity, and under the breast skin on the breast meat (careful not to tear the skin). I chopped 1 large onion, 4 medium carrots, and 6 celery stalks. I put the bird in the bag, then on the pan rack then sprayed the top half of the bag with Pam to prevent sticking. I halved and cored a Braeburn apple and placed a healthy sprig of Thyme on each half and placed them in the cavity. I then filled the rest of the cavity with the chopped vegetables. Any vegetables that didn't fit inside the cavity went in the bag around the bird. Sealed the bag tightly with the tie and pricked a tiny hole in the bag right above the stuffed cavity. Cooked at 350 for 4hrs and 10 min. I didn't use any paprika. I meant to but I forgot, but my bird browned very well without it. The meat was sooo moist and flavorful. I didn't even use any salt or pepper. The taste was so close to my grandma's turkey! I don't usually eat the dark meat but tried it and actually liked it! There will be enough drippings for a lot of delicious gravy. Anyone wanting to impress their guests with the best tasting turkey, THIS IS IT!!!

I noticed that that the video included adding Granny Smith apple chunks to the center of the turkey, along with the quartered onions. It also mentioned turning the bag upside down for juicier breast meat. I did these things and it was the best turkey we have ever eaten, hands down! Because it was upside down, the turkey wasn't beautiful for carving, but we didn't care!

Perfection! I used a pop up timer turkey and the thermometer verified the cooking temp. The turkey doesn't have a wonderful presentation but if you carve or cut the turkey and place it on a dish; presentation doesn't matter. The turkey is delicious and moist.

My MIL has been urging me to use a turkey bag for years now and I am SO glad I finally did!  It was the best turkey I've ever made, it fell off the bone!  I had a 14 lb. turkey and left it in for 3 1/2 hours...it was juicy, tender and to my surprise, the skin was brown and crunchy (Yes, I do eat the skin!).

I normally make my turkey in a paper bag, but decided to try a different recipe. I also bought the plastic turkey bags for the first time. When I opened the box, I realized this was basically the same recipe as in the Reynolds box. My turkey turned out kind of dry. I ended up just doing the bone-in breast with wings, so that may have been the problem. I rubbed the bird with butter, salt, pepper, and sprinkled a little paprika. It seems like it needs a little added flavor. My regular recipe in a bag has a couple more seasonings and even honey. This was something different, but I will stick to my regular recipe. TY

I have used only a cooking bag for my Thanksgiving turkeys for the past several years, wouldn't think of cooking a turkey any other way! My family doesn't like dark meat, so I traditionally cook 2 turkey breasts at a time in the same large bag. Great, foolproof way to cook a turkey!

I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out great!!  It is worth having a fresh turkey (not frozen) so that you do not have to worry about thawing the turkey for many days.  THANK YOU for this great recipe.  It took all of the worry out of making turkey.  I used a 16 pound turkey and it was done in four hours.  Perfect.

I made this turkey exactly as stated except I also added some baby carrots inside the cavity along with the celery and onions. BE CAREFUL about the cooking time. My eleven pound turkey was done in 2-1/2 hrs. It was a little dry since I left it in an additional 15 minutes in hopes that it would brown some more. It didn't brown as much as I would have liked, but it made a nice broth for making gravy without all that butter. I will definitely make it again but take it out before it's overdone this time.

really easy.  This was very good.  I must say, you really need to add paprika for the coloring.  It adds so much color, which it really needs.

I have been using the oven browning bag for years and have NEVER had a bad turkey. I do brush the top of the turkey with oil first. I have never used the celery or onion so maybe I will try that tomorrow.

I have been cooking mny turkeys in a bag sonce before forever.  Every year I am tempted to try anothier method, but when it comes down to it, WHY MESS WITH PERFECTION!  This is always, always, always good. If you are not interested in displaying the turkey at the table, try roasting it breast side down,  You will not believe how wonderful the breast meat becomes.  And there is plenty of juice for a wonderful gravy!  Try this and I guarantee you will never do it any other way.

AMAZING.  I have never had good luck cooking turkey, so I thought I would give this a try.  It was the most moist, delicious turkey I think I have ever had.  People were fighting over the crispy golden skin.  The clean up was quick and easy.  I will never cook turkey any other way.

I made my very first turkey for Thanksgiving all by myself using this recipe and it was great! The turkey wasnt dry, it was nice and brown.  Kinda difficult getting the turkey in the bag and the stuff in it, but it was worth the hassel!

Wow...what a Turkey! I was definitely a bit worried at first, since this was my first attempt at making a turkey dinner...and a Thanksgiving dinner at that!  But boy was it a hit among my 7 guests! I also stuffed it with some homemade sausage stuffing and it was so moist! The turkey was also so ridiculously moist it just fell off the bone. I will definitely be cooking turkey in a bag for a long time to come.

For the past 15 years I have always cooked a turkey in the bag, my mom always did too ever since I can remember.  The large 25-30 pound turkeys, in my opinion come out best when cooked in a bag. The bag keeps the breast moist while cooking the turkey evenly. A few times I roasted a  turkey without using a bag and the meat is always dry while the skin is borderline burnt despite my foil tents. Season & stuff the turkey as you wish. I always stuff the turkey and test the temperature of the turkey & stuffing before serving. Definitely a keeper,  especially for first time cooks this is a fool proof method to a fantastic dinner.

My first year doing this.  I forgot to add the flour and the turkey was alone in the bag.  I let it stand a half hour before carving and it was so awesome!!  My whole family sat there chewing with their eyes popping out of their heads!!

I made this turkey for Thanksgiving dinner.  Instead of using a whole turkey, I used a 9 lb. turkey breast.  It turned out really good.  It was very tender and juicy.  The only complaints I have is that the turkey could have been browner and it could have used more seasoning.  I will definitely modify this recipe to our taste and use it again.  Thanks!

I have always used a cooking bag.  Since I do not stuff my turkey but make a huge pan of dressing, I sprinkle garlic powder, a little poultry seasoning and black pepper inside the bird and then place the onion and celery (cut into chunks) inside the turkey also. Then bake in the bag. VERY flavorful and moist.

I've been doing this for years. It's super easy. Cuts cooking time by half. Turkey comes out perfect every time. I always recommend this method to friends who are nervous about making their 1st bird.

Made this twice & turned out great both times! Turkey was so tender it was falling off the bone. We did rub some butter on outside of skin, but otherwise made no changes.

I was so pleasantly surprised.  The bag was amazing!  It cut down on cooking time, still roasted to a golden brown, and was very juicy and flavorful.  I did however, season the bird with butter, poultry seasoning, garlic, and some seasoning salt as well.  Thanks for the idea!!!

This was the first Thanksgiving turkey I've ever made.   I bought an 18 pounder.  It took just about 4 hours to cook.  I put salt, pepper and rubbed the skin with butter.   I also put a little butter inside.  I added about 1/2 cup of chicken broth in the bag.  Very moist and tender.  It was a huge hit.

I made this last year and it was fantastic. I want to make it again this year, but my grandson's girlfriend is highly gluten intolerant. She would not be able to eat the turkey even with that small amount added to the bag. Someone said the bag would blow up without it.  What can I use instead so she can eat it? I know they make gluten free flour, but there are so many I don't know which one to use.

For the simple reason of ease, we tried this recipe for yesterday's Thanksgiving feast. Our 24lb bird was done in 3hrs flat! Plus, considering the turkey was thoroughly thawed and we added no liquids, we still ended up with tons of rich gravy. We 1st rubbed down with garlic butter, sprinkled the paprika, then threw some onions, celery, carrots, apple, Sage & Rosemary. One reviewer's suggestion, spraying the top of the bag, really did help to keep the beautiful breast from sticking and ripping off.

Before the oven bags were available and popular I used a large plain brown bag from the grocery store. I'd oil the bag well inside and out, put my turkey in and then paper clip the bag to seal it. Turkey always came out moist and tender. The skin a golden brown.
BUT I do so love the new browning  bags!
Great recipe!!!

My first time using a cooking bag for a turkey, or anything for that matter. After reading the reviews I too rubbed the bird inside and out with butter. Sage and onion in the cavity and garlic, paprika and our favorite Cajun spice blend, Konriko, were sprinkled on the outside. You don't even have to truss the wings or legs, just pop it in the bag! My only concern with this recipe is that the cooking time seems WAY off. We checked our 15 pound bird at the 2 & 1/2 hour mark and it was already 190 degrees!!! But man was it moist and delicious!! Thanks!

This is the only recipe I ever use for Turkey - it's simply AWESOME! The turkey comes out perfectly, every time - never fails.  Nice and moist, very juicy and flavorful, the turkey cooks in its own juices and yet the skin is perfectly browned and crinkly on the outside.  It's the bomb!  This year I had a 19-pounder, I did a dry rub on the bird before going into the bag, using fresh rosemary sprigs cut from our plant, and using the sprigs to rub in garlic, Lawry's Seasoned Pepper, and Costco's Italian Seasonings, as well as some Herbs de Provence.  It was so flavorful and absolutely delicious!  My wife's Italian family loved it! Came out in 3 hrs 15 mins.  USE THIS RECIPE - IT NEVER FAILS!!!!

Wow, this was simple and taste great. I'm not the best of cooks and the family was worried that I was making the turkey, but it was a hit.  It was moist and looked great. My first turkey was a success. :)

I decided to use this AllRecipes version today. It took approximately 3 hrs 20 mins for the temp to reach 180 degrees. Through the turkey bag, it turned out with a beautiful color. I will find out about flavor and level of moisture after I allow it to sit for about 30 mins.

Turkey in a bag, where have you been all my life??  Cooked the turkey breast-side-down as a few people recommended.  Followed the recipe and it worked like a charm!  This is our new holiday standard!

I made turkey for the first time in my life. Great recipe, easy. Meat turned out moist, skin was golden brown. The only thing I changed - put quartered oranges instead of celery.

I have been using this method for years. My family loves it. It has always worked for me. I use a large BROWN paper grocery shopping bag.  I oil and season the turkey well and spray Pam inside the bag. Put the turkey inside bag.  Make sure the bag does not touch the meat on top. Secure the open end with metal picks. Remove carefully in the end. Make sure that the paper does not touch any elements in the oven. Bake as usual. Toward the end of the baking period, open the bag and baste the meat.  The bag will also collect the juices, which are much easier to remove and save.

9 lb turkey...I expected it to be 2 hours or less based on other comments but it ended up being 2.5 hours.  I forgot to put holes in the bag.  I did open up the bag for the last 15 min or so to brown it.  Also rubbed turkey with olive oil and seasonings...stuffed cavity with cut apples.  YUMMY turkey!!!

It was alright. Nothing extremely special. I try different recipes each year I make my turkey. I will keep trying. I didn't think it was very moist either; maybe I over cooked it?

I don't think I will do this again for Thanksgiving but for any old day it was a perfect "Bag it and forget it" method.  When I tried to lift the turkey out of the bag, it fell apart. So needless to say it didn't look very pretty.

I tried this method for the first time this Thanksgiving. The turkey was absolutely perfect, and even the professed "non-turkey-lovers" were impressed and had second helpings. We'll use the oven bags every year from now on.

Wow, I'll never go back to traditional roasting.  The turkey I used was from last season and I wasn't sure how it would turn out.  I just happened to have one cooking bag so decided to give it a try. The  turkey was brown ( I did use some paprika) and as one reviewer said even the dark meat was good and I don't usually prefer it.  The clean-up was a breeze and the gravy was unbeatable.   I didn't think it would be done in 3 hours so I cooked it longer but 3 hrs. would have been sufficient.   But even w/ cooking iit longer it still was moist and wonderful.  Thanks for this recipe!!

The ONLY way to cook a moist, fall off the bone delicious turkey.  I prepare it just as thie recipe here directs, but add a basic bread, seasoning, celery & onion stuffing.  No basting, easy clean up lots of delicious turkey stock for gravy...simply perfect!

This was the first time I cooked turkey using a bag. I don’t rate recipes unless I follow them exactly.  This being said, the turkey was moist and delicious.  The skin did not brown enough to suit my taste so I will experiment a little in the future to try to get a browner, crisper skin.

I made this exactly as the recipe provided and it is true to its description. Here is my advice: Liberally salt and pepper the bird ( even a brined one). I put a lot but I am not sure it was enough. I did not use butter per the recipe and reviews but I think it might have been a good idea. Overall, it was evenly cooked with no pink and it was a winner.

First of all  I did turn the  breast side down . When I finished cooking this bird I opened the bag tilted the whole roast  pan and drained the liquid into a smaller pan. And then after I cut the plastic away from the bird I placed another roast pan on top and flip the bird over into the second pan and placed it in the oven and turned the broiler on low for just a few minutes and gave it a beautiful Browning. Beautiful golden brown and very very moist.

I read a lot of the reviews and what I ended up doing is mixing soft butter with dried rubbed sage,onion powder, garlic powder, and dried parsley. I massaged this under the turkey skin. Rubbed butter on the skin, too, then seasoned it with salt, pepper, and paprika to give a hint of "tan" color to it.Seasoned the cavity with celery salt then placed halved apple and halved whole garlic in it. I put long metal pins my MIL had to make sure the skin stayed on.. Followed the instructions in this recipe,  but sprayed  nonstick oil on the bag, especially the part that touches the top of the turkey. I was so glad I did not have to baste. The turkey cooked tender, had a nice golden brown top. The guests had seconds and said they liked the turkey. Even my MIL who is a turkey expert said the turkey was good! BTW, this was my first turkey. Thanks for all the reviews I learned from! P.S. Note the timing tips in the box the bag came with.

I brined my 13lb turkey before cooking it in the bag. I added a quartered jonathan apple to the cavity, and seasoned the outside and inside with paprika, onion poweder, garlic powder, and black pepper. I did not add salt due to the brining. The drippings made an awesome gravy, I did not have to season it just add flour.

I have made this recipe for several years now.   Sometimes I change my seasonings.  I rarely add celery but only because I forget it.  Since I went to this method and recipe, I have never had a "bad" turkey.   When turkeys are on sale I will buy one and cook it this way. Then freeze the meat in portions and makes a lot of meals for a couple.

This recipe had many good reviews and only a few that were not favorable.I am sorry to say that I am among the few.I followed directions carefully ,but I did not like the flavor and I almost ruined it by leaving it in the oven 3 hours.The recipe says 3-3 1/2 hours at 350,but my turkey was a bit dry.This turkey just does not have the flavor and texture that we like.My husband tried to be polite,but even he admitted that it was not very good.He asked me not to freeze the leftovers.Maybe a lower temperature and less time in the oven would help this recipe,but I will never use a bag again for my turkey.

The recipe is great, and very easy to make.
However there is an easy way to spruce it up a bit for a wonderful flavor. 
Just wipe the bird of after removing innards (a vital step, lol). Use a paper towel to cover the turkey lightly with olive oil. Then use (Bolners) Fajita Seasoning and sprinkle all over the inside and outside of the bird. From that point, the recipe covers it all.
The fajita seasoning is available in regular and salt free versions. It adds an amazing flavor, not hot or strong, but delicious. An added benefit is that the liquids remaining in the bag are already seasoned for gravy.
Give it a try. I give maybe 20 bag turkeys  a year to various families in need. No one complains (partly because it is free) but all comment on the great flavor.

Love making turkey this way. Always perfect and moist. Another perk is the clean-up! All I added was Garlic powder and paprika.

Not too bad. I think my whole family agreed that it had too much of an onion flavor and the turkey still came out a little dry. I may try this again with a lemon cut up to try to make the meat more tender.

It was the first time I used a bag. The result as far as taste was fabulous, extremely juicy but, and a big but, the skin came off as I was took the turkey out of the bag!!!! I had to carve it and present it all sliced up in a platter, no beautiful bird on the table! Also 3 hours was enough for a 16lb turkey.

Great recipe! Easy too, especially for someone with less experience in bird cooking (like me...). My husband loved it the first time I made it and we have been sharing this recipe with friends and family ever since! Thank you for posting!

I have to give this a strong 5 stars. I have never cooked a turkey in my life. This recipe made it so easy for someone like me. I couldn't find how heavy the turkey was so I just guessed and it turned out perfect! After cooking the turkey it was so juicy and literally the meat just fell off of the bones! I did change the recipe a little bit to accomodate my taste buds. Instead of using flour I used Bisquick pancake batter. I put salt and pepper on the inside and the outside. One onion cut in fours and Habanero hot sauce at the bottom of the bag. Garlic bits that come in a jar that is wet. I just took two heaping table spoons of that stuff. I cooked it for 5 hours.... totally guessing on the time. AND it was perfect AND TASTY!!

Cooked an 18 pound turkey cooked in a bag for 3 1/2 hours at 350, and followed someone's comment to let it sit 1 hour before opening - it was perfect!!  The one hour gave us time to warm/cook side dishes in the oven.   Turkey was moist and delicious, and we enjoyed our Thanksgiving afternoon with no basting at all.  I won't do it any other way from now on.

I love doing the turkey this way, it comes out very juicy and all the flavors blend in together very nice. I used abodo, salt, onion powder, garlic powder and butter all over the outside of the turkey. Everybody likes it!

Oven bags are awesome.  I became my family's turkey maker 4 years ago and I wouldn't do it any other way.  I do recommend brining first which gives great flavor and very juicy.  There are some great brine recipes on this site.

I cooked this for Thanksgiving and it was fabulous. I stuffed the bird and it was so moist and packed with flavor. I rubbed some olive oil on the skin. This will become our family tradition. Thanks for sharing.

Yes, I know -- it seems inbelievable.  That's what I thought, too, when DH first suggested it several years ago.  But the turkey WILL come out perfect, every time, and the stock is amazing for gravy!  We put rosemary and garlic under the skin, and lemon rinds inside the cavity.  Extra extra yummy.  Don't forget to flour the bag as per instructions, and let the bird rest outside the oven for 20-30 minutes for easier carving.  Happy Thanksgiving to all!!

I started hosting Thanksgiving four or five years ago. I tried a few recipes the first few years and this is the best way to go! My dad is such a picky eater and he always asks for me to make the turkey in a bag. It is sooo moist and no basting.  It cooks faster than eny other recipe I have tried and I will never go back!

My first time cooking a whole turkey and I was having 25 people over.  I decided to try this recipe, hoping the turkey would turn out moist and not taste dry.  I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to prep and cook.  Everyone loved my turkey!! I put a quartered onion (without peeling), a few garlic cloves also in the husk, and a sprig of sage in the turkey cavity.  I also rubbed the outside of the turkey with butter, and an herb mix of sage, rosemary, oregano, and thyme.  I'll definitely use this recipe again the next time I cook turkey.

This was a really great, simple recipe.  The only thing I did differently was mince shallot and rub it all over the bird instead of using any other type of onion. The flavor was fantastic and the bird was the juiciest I've ever made! Also I used the brine recipe on allrecipes.com before cooking.

Easy to bake method, directions easy to follow. I added a bundle of herbs, buttered the skin and followed the directions from the video. Turkey looks great, the bag did stick to parts of the turkey skin... anyone know how to not have that happen? Also I would have pulled the turkey out  at 170* F not 180 as the rest of the bird is warmer than the thigh meat.

Cook 15 minutes per pound. Quartered yellow onion and liberally sprinkled with salt, pepper, and sage then added 2 stalks celery, adding it all to turkey cavity. Rubbed under turkey skin with softened 1/4 stick butter mixed with 1/4-1/2 tsp of garlic powder, same amount of sage. I cooked it upside down with vents on top.  For the last 30-45 min. I turned the turkey over inside the bag to help brown the top (can't just turn it over because of the vent holes on top - all the juices would drain out!)  The meat was SO tender and delicious!!! I used the pan drippings with McCormick's Brown Gravy mix and that got rave reviews as well.

Turned out great! Been using the last 3 years. Only thing I do different is butter the turkey and put paprika on it to help brown. I also add some cloves of garlic and use all the drippings for gravy and never have any complaints.

I followed suggestions of other posters a added sliced apples to the cavity and put the celery and onions on the bottom of the bags. My daughter (age 34) said it was the most moist turkey  she had ever eaten!  I decided not to stuff the turkey and that made things much easier. This was a big hit with the entire family.

Used this recipe (with stuffing) this last Thanksgiving and it was a success! My family’s really not big turkey fans but they loved how juicy this turned out. My brother kept asking where I? ordered the turkey haha. I didn’t change the recipe at all and the flavor was great. Will definitely make this again next year.

Very dry and over cooked turkey. 3.5 hours is too long for a 12 pounds turkey when cooked in a bag. It should be roasted for 2 to 2.5 max.

I followed the recipe as posted, although I "splayed " the turkey legs, as suggested by a NYT chef posting. I stuffed the cavity and the leg area with carrots, onions, and celery, and also spread around the turkey in the bag. I used fresh chopped herbs from my garden- parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme (like the song...). I also cut an apple into fourths, and stuffed that in as well.  I cooked breast side down, and applied softened butter, then sprinkled with garlic powder and paprika. I followed the bag directions; and cooked the 11.2 lb turkey for about 2 hours 15 minutes, at 350. Then it rested about 1/2 hour +, on the way to family gathering.  I  cooked a pre brined turkey from Whole Foods. I've done my own before, but this was much easier.
It was superb! Everyone agreed,and clean up was nothing. I also used a disposable turkey cooking aluminum pan. 
Best turkey ever, very moist and delicious! This will always be my go to, after many years of cooking Thanksgiving turkey!!

Everybit of meat was moist flavorful, even the wings which usually get hard and no one eats. I quartered an apple & yellow onion, halved 5 garlic cloves,  and cut celery stalk into thirds to put them in cavity, and cut few smaller to fit into neck cavity. Put  several celery stalks and thick rounds of a small onion on bottom of prepared bag to rest turkey on. I washed my 13 lb turkey,  rubbed it with olive oil as husband liberally cranked the salt, then pepper grinder  over skin. I took 2 T of softened butter and mixed with poultry seasoning to  place under skin of each breast, which I  think was unnecessary since I baked the turkey upside down at 350, and it basted in its own juices the entire 2 1/2 hours. Meat thermometer read 170 when I took it out, then let rest 45 min. Perfect. Next time I'll sprinkle the seasoning on the outside and use a bit more paprika for color.

I followed directions exactly. I am sad to give a less than 5 star review. I roasted a 12 pound turkey and it was over done at  2 hours.  Don't roast a 12 pound turkey for 3 to 3.5 hours using this bag method!  Either the  roasting time or the temperature should be changed on the recipe.   The breast meat is dry.  I had high expectations based on most of the reviews.  I used a thawed Honeysuckle previously frozen turkey and added onions, carrots, and celery around the bird  and a couple of apples in the cavity.

From now on I am only cooking my turkeys in a bag! This turkey came out perfect, juicy and nicely browned. I added apples and carrots into the cavity and used a pre-basted turkey. So simple! Almost no clean up!

So good. I will definitely make again. I have never had a turkey cook so well.  I will never be afraid to cook turkey again. I'm so happy I had a turkey bag sitting in my drawer. I only used 3 celery stalks and used shallot instead. The juices made a whole lotta gravy! I think I would only use 1 heaping tbsp of flour next time.

I use a paper grocery bag! Smear the inside of the paper bag completely with butter. Put your favorite items in the cavity ( apple, onion, rosemary)of the bird. If cooking a large turkey extend the height of the bag by stapling the top of another bag to it. Put your turkey in the bag, fold over the opening and staple closed and bake as normal in a roasting pan. No basting, no fuss.  You have the most perfectly browned, juicy turkey with crispy skin. I have tried cooking my turkeys other ways but nothing beats this technique.

Turned out so juicy and golden brown even though my meat thermometer stopped working and I ended up leaving it in too long. This recipe was made for Catastrophe Prone Cooks like me.

My first 13 pound turkey turned out great with this recipe.  I need use a dry rub on the turkey instead of the salt and pepper.  I stuffed the turkey too.  It was a great starting point for me since it was the first turkey I have cooked.  Turkey was moist with great flavor.

This recipe came out great for my first ever thanksgiving! I used one large onion instead of two!!
