I followed this recipe exactly except I sugared the almonds.  I used 2% milk and next time I will use whole milk so that it holds it's shape a little better.  The coffee liqueur was way too strong for me, so next time I will use a strong coffee and use, maybe a cup, not the 1-1/2 cup this recipe calls for because the toasts were saturated and added nothing to the texture of this dish.  I think that with these changes I will definitely make again.  thanks for sharing your recipe!
