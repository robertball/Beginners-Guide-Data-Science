Such a good summer salad!  I couldn't make enough of it.  It's even delicious without the prosciutto.   Light and tasty, good for a side at a BBQ.

Absolutely fantastic.  We've done this w/peas, French string beans, spinach - have the dressing on hand at dinner time just pick, wash, mix and eat.  Don't know why we haven't tried squash before.  Thank you.

Loved this salad! So refreshing.  
I substituted the feta for goat cheese crumbles and added a few cherry tomatoes. All the veggies and mint were fresh from my garden :)

This really is delish! And I highly recommend the Uber Julianne Peeler available on Amazon for $10.

A great salad with the zing from the lemon. I used my Spirooli to make the squash into thin strips. Thank you T.J. for this refreshing recipe.

Since buying a spiralizer, I am always looking for new recipes to use this  tool.  This salad was easy and delicious and quickly came together with ingredients I had on hand.  My only problem was that I did not consume all of it in one meal.  The next day it was just as tasty but the squash had drawn water which thinned the dressing.  The only change I would make in the future is to keep the veggies and the dressing separate and toss them when I was ready to eat the salad.

This salad was amazing! So light and tasty!  I took it to a function and came home with an almost empty dish.  I will definitely make it one of my regular go-to summer salads.

Simple, quick to make, and flavorful--my favorite kind of dish! I used the hash browns blade on my Salad Master and it came out perfect. I left out the prosciutto; otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. The lemon and mint are subtle and add just the right amount of flavor. This is a definite keeper, and it tastes even better the next day.

Tastes very fresh.  I liked the way it tasted following the directions exactly as written.  I've made my own preferred variation with jerky instead of proscuitto,  didn't have feta at hand so put some cheddar very lightly shredded on top.  I know this adds to calories but I sautéed slivered almonds and and the lemon peel in butter and added.  And I added small capers...to my taste.  Loved the original too though - and that's worth a 5 in itself. YUM!

Great way to enjoy the surplus of zucchini and squash from the garden!  I made this for a family reunion and it was enjoyed by many. Plan on eating it all the first day, as it became too watery the next day. Didn't use prosciutto, only because I didn't have any on hand. I'm sure it would have been delicious with it, but we didn't miss it.

It was delicious and refreshing. I had made stuffed chicken breasts wrapped in bacon and this was the perfect side dish. And since I already had bacon, I just fried a few pieces for the salad. There are only two of us, but I had my serving and he ate the rest!!

Very delicious recipe! The flavors  balanced one another.  I like how the lemon and mint combination adds a nice zing and flavor to the squash, quickly followed by the savory taste of the prosciutto and cheese.

I’ve made this a couple times. The first time, I made it as written except used bacon instead of prosciutto. Excellent. The second time I was out of zucchini so added a few handfuls of arugula. Excellent. I will make this again, again and again.

Delicious and refreshing! I skipped the prosciutto and feta for a healthier version, but it wasn’t lacking. I’m sure it would be tasty with both/either though. My guy liked it; he doesn’t typically like squash because it’s too soft. Since this isn’t cooked, that wasn’t an issue. He also liked its similarity to cold pasta/pasta salad. It paired nicely with sautéed fish with tomato herb and olive oil sauce.

Great recipe.   I added basil and used sharp cheddar cheese as we didn't have feta cheese.
