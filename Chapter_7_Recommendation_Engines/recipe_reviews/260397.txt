These are really easy to make and taste good, esp when you are craving something sweet. Next time I make it I will decrease the amount of the sweetener a bit.

Such an easy recipe to make! I cut back to 7/8 C. of Stevia and it was just a little sweet for me.  It didn't stop me from eating them, though! Next time I will cut it down a bit more or try another sweetener. I rolled mine into a ball and flattened with the tines of a fork. Worked perfectly.

These are really good. I added a little less sugar substitute. I put dough in fridge then rolled into balls and pressed down slightly before baking.  Loved these,  making  2nd batch now!  Thank you
