Awesome recipe! 
Friends at my christmas party loved it! Originally, I thought there might be too much alcohol, but two versions, one as per the instructions  and one with much less alcohol verified that the more alchol as per the original resipe was perfect.  Strawberries were not in season, so I used fresh pinapple in the lowest layer, fresh raspberries in the middle layer and on top decorated with mandarine oranges and sprinkled with grated chocolate. I also spread a thin coating of raspberry jam at each new layer.

AMAZING! I made a lot of changes but it still turned out amazing! I used 1 cup of milk and 1 cup of half and half in the pudding, used a dollop of chocolate liquor in the pudding instead of all the other liquors. I didn't add sugar. I used frozen strawberries and frozen raspberries and made a puree in the blender. I used one package of yellow pound cake in a normal cake pan. I layered in different orders. It was amazing! My family wouldn't stop raving!

Is it possible to give this ten stars? This is fabulous. I have made many a trifle but this one beats my recipe big time. I made half the recipe to suit our dinner party. I also left the rum out of the pudding though I think it would be great with it. I used all raspberries, they are our favorite. I want to thank Marc Boyer for a stellar recipe!

Used lady fingers instead of angel food cake, brandy for pudding and bailey's to soften cake. Made slits in lady fingers so they soak up baileys well. Added fresh raspberries to each layer with pudding. Best to let rest overnight. Awesome next day and probably even better after.

Followed recipe as written but used 1% milk instead of half and half in pudding.  Turned out fabulous and decadent anyway.  Everyone loved it.  My husband questioned the need for the raspberry jam but in the end conceded that it really added to the overall taste.  Making it again now for company coming!
