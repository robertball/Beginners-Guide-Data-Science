Yummmm. :) I took the suggestions of other reviewers and used 1 T. of sugar, vanilla yogurt, and 1 t. of vanilla extract. I also threw in a banana. It was out of this world! My mom didn't say much... she was too busy downing the glass. :P But afterwards she commented on how good it was. And it was! Good, that is. :D

I've never been much of a smoothie drinker or breakfast eater but I just might have to rethink that after having this. For me to eat a few strawberries, a glass of milk and some yogurt is too much effort and not all that appealing, but blending them altogether is a whole other story. I used cherry-vanilla yogurt and just a smidge of Equal, and I think the vanilla really contributed to the flavor too. I appreciated the lightness of it - very refreshing and goes down easy. This was simple, but excellent.

This is good, I recommend using Vanilla yogurt unless you like the tartness of the plain yogurt.

I used vanilla low fat yogurt instead of plain yogurt and it was so good. I also tried it with blackberries instead of strawberries and have peaches lined up next. And key lime yogurt to go with the strawberries... mmmm.

I changed it slightly, though-- I only use one tablespoon of sugar.

Kids loved it!  For a second batch, we used a package of sweetened frozen strawberries (thawed) along with a banana.  Tasted great also and a little quicker to make.

My friend just bought a new smoothie machine and brought it over tonight so that we could try a bunch of new smoothie recipes...which my family didn't mind "taste-testing!" This was one of my favorites. Other than increasing the strawberries, didn't make a change and this was very good. A "basic" & easy strawberry smoothie that everyone liked.

My children and I felt that this recipe was very refreshing.  Not too much sugar which enhanced the flavor of the strawberries.  We may experiment with the fruit, but not the added ingredients.  This recipe is a real treat.

Very good recipe! Just made it for the boyfriend and the first thing he said was, "This is  good!" It will be a regular rotation. Used only 1/2 tsp vanilla, vanilla yogurt, 1T sugar and added a banana. Will also make the weekend cocktail party rotation: just add rum!

Excellent!  Also great with a handful of blueberries and a banana added (but you
have to add extra milk).  Frozen strawberries
are a great convenience.

I used frozen strawberries so that I could use some of the "juice" that they are packaged in with the smoothie. Also, used half the sugar. Wonderful smoothie and was a great side with breakfast.

I was utterly impressed by the simplicity and flavor of this recipe.  It was quick and easy, and goes with almost any meal.  I've made it several times now, and it's good with either the plain yogurt, or you can use buttermilk in place of it.  It's an excellent recipe - 5 stars and 2 thumbs up!

Very very good smoothie. Definately reccomended. Better than a lot of brand-name smoothies I've had. I used vanilla yogurt, which made mine especially vanilla-tasting. mmmm!

This is a really easy recipe and delicious. I didn't use any sugar and it was definitely sweet enough. I also used frozen strawberries, and so I didn't use any ice. Definitely a healthy, easy mid-day snack.

The smoothie was delicious and not too sweet.  
Tasted more like a frozen yogurt dessert than a smoothie. Although I was looking for more of a "Jamba Juice" type smoothie, this was good.

Absolutely delicious!  My five-year-old wants it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  This is a quick, easy fix for an on the run breakfast.  If you add protein powder, it's a complete meal.

Finally a way to get some nutritious foods into my picky toddler and husband. Everyone loved this smoothie. I did add a banana and had to substitute a flavored yogurt since my store was out of plain, but it was still great.

This was the first smoothie recipe I've tried and I'm glad it was this one. Kids love making and drinking it! I changed the plain yogurt to vanilla,used frozen strawberries instead of ice and a little less milk for a thicker consistency like a milkshake. Great for breakfast or a summer treat.

Very good indeed! The measurements of the ingredients were right on. I substituted soy milk for the regular and now my kids are hooked!

SO SIMPLE, LOW CAL AND DELICIOUS. MY WHOLE FAMILY LOVED IT. I also made blueberry smoothie and strawberry/banana. All were terrific. I reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 tsps. and it was still great.

This was good but just a little too much vanilla for my taste.  Next time I would only put in about half of the amount called for.

This was a great recipe. My 11 year old son who LOVES smoothies was able to do this one just fine. He did use frozen strawberries, which made it nice and cold.
Very yummy and sweet!!!

Great recipe!  I like this because you can slightly adjust depending on your taste.  I prefer a thicker smoothie, so I just added a little extra yogurt.  Most awesome recipe =)

Awesome smoothie.  I made it with ice cubes the first time, & found I prefer to just use frozen fruit & no ice.  It's great with raspberries added in, too.  I noticed one reviewer said it doesn't need sugar - I found I definately needed to add the sugar - the plain yogurt makes it too tart for me otherwise.   Amazing smoothie - it's a wonderfully yummy way to make sure I get fruit in my diet.  Thanks girls!!!

You have to make this smoothy recipe the way it is written. If you want to decrease the sugar that is fine. But to all of the reviewers that are decreasing the sugar and adding vanilla yogurt, they are actually adding more sugar than the original recipe. The whole point of this recipe is to get from the healthiness of the yogurt by adding something sweet(strawberries), without making it unhealthy like adding vanilla yogurt(which contains sooooo much sugar).

With a craving for a strawberry smoothie, I went hunting. I actually only picked this recipe because we didn't have anything fancier than the standard ingredients, but what a treat it is! I used strawberry yogurt, and added a handful of extra strawberries, and it disappeared within minutes. We've just finished it off, exclaiming about how delicious it was. In the words of my ten-year-old cousin, "I could drink this all day!"

Very good smoothie! Experiment with all kinds of fruit combinations (fresh or frozen) and different flavors of yogurt. OJ can also be substituted for the milk based on what fruit is used. I like frozen mixed  berries with strawberry or blueberry yogurt and my boyfriend likes OJ, vanilla yogurt, and either bananas or frozen peaches. Honey can also replace the sugar just be sure to reduce the amount of whatever is being used to sweeten the smoothie if the frozen fruit is presweetened. Using flavored instead of plain yogurt also adds a sweeter flavor so  watch out for that as well. The recipe as written is excellent and is a great starting point for all kinds of wonderful smoothies!

Made these for a work function and everyone liked them.  Used vanilla yogurt instead of using vanilla extract and added a half of banana.  Definitely prefer to use frozen fruit.  Cut sugar down to 1 T.  Delish! Thanks

OMG!! This is good! I also made a couple of changes, I used a full cup of 2% milk (only had on hand), added Dannon Light & Fit Strawberry Yogurt, few more frozen strawberries, and omitted the crushed ice. It turned out wonderful, thick and creamy. Needed a spoon!  Will be definitely making again!! :-)

This is an excellent smoothie recipe as written and it's also very versatile!  When I want more of a "breakfast smoothie", I add half of a banana and 1/2 cup of rolled oats for extra fiber and texture!!  Put the rolled oats in first to grind them up extra fine before adding the rest of the ingredients!  Yum!

Made for breakfast.  I also used Nonfat Vanilla yogurt and a little more ice.  (we prefer a little thicker smoothie.)  We only used 1/2 tbsp. sugar because we thought the vanilla yogurt added the sweetness that it needed.  Thanks

I tried this twice so far w/very good results.  For the first, I used the 8 berries, which gave a very pink smoothie.  If you're expecting something more like the picture, try 4 or 5.  I used lowfat vanilla yogurt, and then cut the sugar and vanilla in half.  Also added more ice for a frostier result.  Yum!

This smoothie was great! I used frozen strawberries and peaches for the fruit, and vanilla yogurt, skim milk, and splenda to sweeten it. I had to use more milk than what the recipe called for though. I made chicken fried rice from this site for dinner and this smoothie for dessert. My boyfriend said, "You did good tonight."

Delicious. I used 10-12 frozen strawberries, 1 cup peach yogurt, 1/2 cup vanilla yogurt plus the reduced sugar mentioned by other reviewers & milk/ice. Easy to switch out the fruits and change up the yogurt to get different flavors. My new breakfast favorite!

Fantastic! I followed the advice of other reviewers and used vanilla yogurt, one tablespoon of sugar, and one teaspoon of vanilla. I am thinking of trying it with no sugar next time, as this smoothie is still pretty sweet. What a delicious breakfast!

This was my first ever smoothie and it was so easy to make!  i used low-fat vanilla yogurt and only 1 tsp of vanilla.  This is a great base and you can definately add anything you want: bananas, kiwis, watermelon...etc.  I think next time i will freeze the strawberries to help give it a more icy texture.

The kids and I loved this shake...a great triumph since my toddler won't eat whole strawberries. I cut back on the sugar by a tablespoon and it was sweet enough. Next time I'll use finer caster sugar so the grains are less noticeable.

This was really good. Everyone finished their glasses and made slurpy sounds :D. Haha, thats unnecessary. I'd cut down a little on the vanilla extract, unless you like the vanilla extract taste. (Personally, I don't like it that much!). The ice doesn't have to be crushed, I tossed uncrushed ice as the drink blended.
A 4.5 smoothie!

Best homemade strawberry smoothie I have ever had. Only thing different I added was instead of plain yogurt cause I didn't have any at the time I used yoplait strawberry yogurt. Luckily I had any yogurt at all. I don't know how it would've tasted with plain yogurt with the strawberry kind it tasted great. Just drank a whole cup for breakfast :D

Hi guys! This recipe was great, I came to find it because I had to make a smoothie for a friend who can't have bananas. If you are looking for a better overall taste, or after taste I would actually do as the following:
10 strawberries, hulled, preferably frozen
1/2 cup milk
2 bananas
1/2 cup strawberry or vanilla yogurt

(LOTS more healthy and absolutely delicious!)
I own a smoothie/frozen yogurt store, and this is one of my most highly rated recipes, thanks!

Ok, so I didn't follow the recipe exactly but I thought the addition of the vanilla and a teeny bit of sugar was great. I used plain Greek yogurt, chocolate soy milk in place of the skim, and only used one teaspoon of sugar. It tastes like a chocolate covered strawberry! And good for you! I will definitely make this again.

I may have just found the first smoothie that I can say I did not care for. I have no idea why, but it tasted like a strawberry antacid. I was able to repair the taste by adding some other berries and juice. I would have rated it lower, but it seems it must be personal taste as there are quite a few people that seemed to like this.

Really beautiful dessert. Except I would argue that the vanilla extract and white sugar are really unnecessary since the strawberries have so much sugar naturally.

Fantastic!  I used a bag of frozen strawberries, and it made a wonderfully thick, flavorful smoothie.  Thanks!

This is close to how I make mine. I like to use frozen strawberries. you can get bags of mixed peices for a lot cheaper than fresh strawberries. they are still available in the winter and they still tatste great. plus added bonus you dont have to add the ice and risk watering down your smoothie!

I think this recipe is good but needed a lot more ice. I also didn't use skim milk we don't drink it so I used the 2% milk that we drink. I also added a bananna!

This was good.  We used 1 tsp of vanilla instead of 2, but that was the only alteration made.

Very yummy!  I made it with greek yogurt.  If you don't like the yogurt taste in your smoothie, just use vanilla frozen yogurt.  I also added blueberries the second time I made it.

Instead of plain yougurt I used non-fat strawberry banana and I used frozen strawberries that I had in my freezer.  I also went off of other moderations: 1 T sugar and 1 t. vanilla. turned out well.

Very tasty. I used half the sugar and I used strawberry yogurt instead of plain. I also added a banana. I topped it with some cool whip, a squirt of chocolate sauce and a sliced strawberry.

This tasted good but only because of the things I added. Not because of what was said in the recipe. There should be just a little less sugar, and twice as much ice for a smoothie that doesn't just taste like juice and yogurt!!!! (I added pomegrante which tasted great!)

Very good!  I used Splenda instead of sugar (to cut the calories some) and added some strawberry daiquiri mix (about half a cup) just to make it where you couldn't taste the yogurt as much.

This was easy and quick to make.We used frozen strawberries instead of ice and I mixed splenda and a small amount of regular sugar to sweeten it.Had to add a little more milk to thin it down to my kids liking but they both raved about it.This is a great way to get calcium and a bit of vitamin c into your childs diet.

Delicious! The vanilla really adds a nice touch. I gave it 4 stars because the vanilla was a little strong. I reduced it to 1 1/2 teaspoons the 2nd time I made it and it was spot on (for me).

This recipe was very yummy :) instead of using yoghurt I used 2 scoops of vanilla icecream, I also used only 2 tablespoons of white sugar and 1 teaspoon of vanilla and it still tastes great! :)
Thanks for the recipe!

Yum! I used plain Greek yogurt and 2 Tbs of sugar instead of 3. I also used 1% milk, since I don't usually keep skim milk on hand. I added a little more ice than listed as well. It came out very well! Next time, I will try reducing the sugar even more. This is a good way to use up strawberries that are too ripe to eat alone. I'll make it again.

For the weight conscious....  Followed this recipe but substituted water and two scoops of GNC french vanilla protein powder and 4 packets of Splenda instead of the sugar.  

The entire shake has 346 calories, 31 carbs, 6g fat, 37g protein, and 12g sugar.  

*The way it is presently is 326 calories, 57 carbs, 3g fat, 16g protein, and 51g of sugar!!!!  51 grams of sugar is awful!  You will be hungry in 10 minutes after this...

Made this today, was so good, just what I was craving. I made a few changes that I don't think affected the recipe. used 1 TBSP honey instead of all the sugar, used 1 small container of oikos greek vanilla yogurt. 4pp per serving on weight watchers. will make again.

I should find and put this under strawberry/banana smoothie, but here goes...    I also add more strawberries, use vanilla low fat yogurt, and a banana and use 1 TBLS of honey in place of the sugar... on ocassion have added a bit of orange juice in place of the milk, too.  Lots of flavors. (I'm not much of a measurer except for the honey - which is also an 'eyeball' thing)

I am NOT a smoothie lover but LOVE this smoothie!  I used frozen strawberries though instead of ice.  Simply delish.  I made it a few times and also added frozen blueberries and mango.  Again, delish.

I make my Protein/smoothie very simular. Besides adding 20 grams of a vanilla protein powder - 1 cup soy milk - I also add 3 heaping tsp. of fresh ground flax seed. I grind it in my spice grinder fresh every two weeks and it hides away in my drink -  very healthy for you besides the fact that it keeps EVERYTHING regular!! Fresh pineapple is great in a smoothie also. Instead of ice I stick it in the freezer while I'm getting dressed for work - its perfect in about 30 mins.

I made this recipe using lite strawberry yogurt, as I didn’t have plain.  I reduced the sugar to 2 t., which was sweet enough for us.  I also reduced the vanilla to about 1/2 t. – 2 t. sounded like an awful lot to me.  This was good.  It was thinner than I thought it would be, but I'm no expert on smoothies.  I garnished it with a plump strawberry and Hubs and I enjoyed this as a nice snack.

Yummy! But I made some possibly significant changes so I can't give it full stars. I didn't have yogurt so I threw in a whole banana and I left out the vanilla extract. Everything else was the same. It was pretty good but a little too sweet for me so I added some fruit juice (Mango Twist to be exact) to take some of the sweetness off. Next time I'll just decrease the amount of sugar used. Also it was a little runnier than I like so I had to add more ice cubes for some thickness but this is probably because of the lack of yogurt. Anyway I'll try this again and possibly edit my review! ^_^

Substituted 2 packets of Equal for sugar and used strawberry WW yogurt. Only about 2 WW points for a generous serving.

The flavor was pretty good but it was so thin!  We even used more strawberries.  This was also a little on the tart side.  I think it would be better if you used vanilla yogurt.  Maybe a banana would thicken it up too.  I'm going to play around with the recipe a bit to see if I can improve it.

Not much flavor to this probably because of the plain yogurt. I added a banana to make it more sweet.

This was a very good smoothie--although I did modify it a bit.  I used frozen strawberries and omitted the ice.  I used strawberry/banana yogurt, and also threw in some pineapple and strawberry ice cream toppings that I had sitting in my fridge.  I only gave four stars because of the modifications I made.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Excellent smoothie!  Like other reviews I used vanilla yogurt and added bananas.  I would use less milk next time to make it a bit thicker.

I made mine with mango, vanilla yogurt, and doubled the recipe.  I did not use double the sugar though.  Only 4 tablespoons.  It is yummy!  I want to try it with blueberries.

I made this smoothie with some minor alterations for my husband and I, and we both agreed it was delicious!  I used strawberry yogurt, skipped the sugar altogether, reduced the vanilla to 1 tsp, and added a banana and a handful blueberries as well.  It had both great flavor and texture - not to mention nutritional value.  We will certainly be making this recipe again and again.

I found this smoothie to be pretty bland, and lacking in strawberry flavor. It did have a nice, frothy consistency, though. I substituted honey for the sugar, and added a little less, because honey is much sweeter! I also had to cut back on the amount of ice, because the smoothie was somewhat tasteless. I ended up adding about five extra strawberries, and even so, I've tasted better smoothies. Sorry, but I won't be making this again!

Followed the other reviewers suggestions to use vanilla yogurt and only use 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.  Way too strong of a vanilla taste for my liking.  It overpowered the strawberry taste I really wanted.  I think next time I will omit the vanilla extract and double up on the strawberry number.

all that sugar seemed extreme--especially since I'll down the whole batch myself every time!  Second time I made it I used French vanilla flavored yogurt and was able to omit ALL the sugar AND the vanilla extract and it tasted great.

I have been making this smoothie for the past 6 years, and it is always my go to strawberry smoothie recipe.

I cut the sugar to 1 tbsp, and vanilla to 1 tsp.  Sometimes I use frozen strawberries (that I freeze after cutting during the summer reasons) and sit them in hot water for a few minutes.  If the mix is too think with the frozen strawberries (I don't use the ice when I use the strawberries frozen) I simply add a little water at a time until the consistency that I desire.

Delicious recipe.

I thought the thickness and texture were perfect but the flavor was a little bland.    However, this is a pretty good base for any type of fruit smoothie you'd like.

Great recipe! I did make a few changes though. I used 10-12 frozen strawberries (then you don't need to use the ice), 1 Tbsp. sugar, 1 teas vanilla and used whatever kind of yogurt I had in my 'fridge. (Peach once and strawberry the other) Awesome!

Pretty good.  I had some frozen strawberries to get rid of so I doubled the recipe and added one very ripe banana.  I used Splenda and it needed a little more than the recipe called for.  Also added a Tbsp or so of Flaxseed meal.  Nice cooling treat for a hot summer day!

You have to try this!!!  My daugher loves this recipe and it has become one of her favorite requests to share with friends during sleep-overs.  It's a must have for breakfast time and very kid-friendly.  I've never used with ice.  I always use frozen strawberries and it works out great.  I also use vanilla yogurt.

soooooooooooooo yummmy. And I am a really picky person. I just added a few slices of banana to mine. I think it is a good base smoothie recipe, so you can subsititute  the main fruit for another one, like mango, blueberry etc. 
Cheers

Added a couple of bananas and extra ice for thickness.  Very refreshing on a hot day.  Kids LOVE 'em.

My family and I went and picked strawberries this weekend and I wanted a delicious recipe. And I found one! Yummy! The only thing I changed was the yogurt. I used vanilla yogurt instead of plain yogurt. Absolutely delicious!

Really delicious. Families first smoothie. I scaled it to 8 servings for 2 adults/3 kids. Made a whole blender full and there's nothing left. I did make some changes like using whole frozen unsweetened strawberries(added a few x-tra too), used light strawberry yogurt and a little less sugar, didn't measure the vanilla. I did not add the ice because the berries were frozen. Kids are begging to make it again soon.

I just tried this recipe out and I absolutely LOVE it.  I let all of my housemates try it and they love it as well... so technically this review counts for 5 people... not just one.  Definitely worth the little time and effort... this smoothie is one of the best and is highly, highly, highly recommended!

My husband made this and used vanilla yogurt since we didn't have any plain yogurt.  It tasted very good, although I think a few extra strawberries would have made it taste even better.

Fast and easy.  I sustituted Splenda instead of sugar, so if you decide to do this, put an extra tsp. of splenda and alittle extra milk.  I absolutely love it!

This really is a great smoothie! I did adjust it from the original. I had more strawberries than it called for, which means I put a little extra of everything else. I used mixed berry yogurt with stevia, the called for amount of milk,  a half tablespoon more of sugar, 8 ice cubes instead of 6 and a tad bit more vanilla extract. It was so good my sons kept coming back for more. I will definitely be making this again

Delicious! I only used 1-2 tablespoons of sugar, and it tasted great! Super easy to make and had no trouble. I would definitely reccomend this smoothie.

Hands down the best home made smoothie I've ever made. The only change I made was that I used vanilla yogurt over plain.  Easy and delicious!

This was sooo delicious.  I used Strawberry yogurt to enhance the taste. Also substituted Stevia for the sugar.   Kept lots of strawberries in the house to make this over and over.

A good stepping stone to making my own smoothie with a slightly healthier twist.
In my smoothie I used:
8 strawberries,
1 banana (totally optional I just love bananas),
3/4 cup Vanilla Greek yogurt to make it a little thicker and add flavor,
1/2 cup of vanilla almond milk,
~1/2 cup of baby spinach (a perfect way to add that extra health bump without adding any overwhelming flavor),
2Tbs of protein powder,
and 9 ice cubes just cause our ice seemed smaller and didn't add much with just 6.

Plan to use this recipe all the time :)

This recipe was really really delicious!!! Though, I would use vanilla yogurt, instead of plain yogurt, unless you like tartness of the plain yogurt. And I added more strawberries to make the smoothie a little more strawberry. Even though this recipe had it's ups and downs, I will definetly use this recipe again.

I slightly tweaked the ingredients...I added low-fat vanilla yogurt rather than plain, and only 1/4 teaspoon of sugar. You get enough sweetness from the strawberries and vanilla yogurt!!
I also only added 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract (since I used low-fat vanilla yogurt).
I added 9 strawberries and 2 bananas and turned it into a strawberry-banana smoothie! YUM!! :)

I used blueberries rather than strawberries and sweetened it with honey. If you need to sweeten, use pure can sugar instead.  Otherwise, it was a tasty smoothie.

First of all YUM! I used Vanilla Bean yogurt and found it gave it a more vanilla taste which was nice. I also increased the strawberries instead of 8 I put 12-14. I also added a banana. Instead of sugar I used 1T honey! YUMMMM

I used raw milk and homemade yogurt instead but everything else as written and it was delicious.  Next time I will try using Honey as we try to stay away from sugar.  Thanks for sharing!

Just made this for the first time. I used vanilla yogurt instead of regular, 2 tablespoons of Splenda instead of 3 regular sugar and 14 strawberries instead of 8. I also used more ice, maybe 12 instead of 6. It turned out ok, but I'll play around with the recipe more next time. Maybe because it's so hot out, but it's more watery than I expected.

Very tasty! I used 16 small frozen strawberries and omitted the ice cubes. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. It was easy to make and my kids loved it too.

Yum! Its was great but REALLY sweet. For the 1 serving I used 2 and a 1/2 teaspoons sugar instead of 1 tablespoon and 1 and a 1/2 tsp. That would have been SUPER sweet, considering it is still a bit too sweet now.I also didn't add yogurt. But overall still good!

Very good!!  I omitted the sugar and used strawberry yogurt.  I've also used vanilla yogurt and that's good as well.  I threw in a couple bananas for some extra flavor.

This is really tasty! But, it's also a little too sweet I don't think all the sugar is necessary. Also, the sugar probably turns a healthy smoothie into a not so healthy smoothie. But still really good!

I would give this FIVE STARS....but, I did have to make some changes! First, I use about 8-10 whole, frozen strawberries and forgo the ice. Doing this makes the smoothie thicker and creamier. Then I use a strawberry yogurt instead of plain vanilla. I don't really measure the sugar and vanilla, but it probably comes down to about 3 tsp. of vanilla extract and 2 tbs. of sugar. With these changes, I give the smoothie 100 STARS!!! It tastes SO good :) I definitely reccomend this, 100%.

This was yummy and very filling. I did as some of the other reviewers suggested and used vanilla yogurt (because that's what I had on hand) and only 1 tsp vanilla extract. Also, instead of sugar, I used 2 packets of Splenda. A quick, healthy, satisfying breakfast.

Doubled the ice, threw in a banana, used strawberry&banana yogurt(it was all I had on hand), and topped it off with a heaping scoop of chocolate protein powder! May not be the healthiest version, but the is my new post-workout shake!

I loved this recipe! Lately, I'm on a smoothie kick, and I've been trying a new recipe a day.  This one will definitely be a repeat make.  I would suggest, however, that you use a flavored yogurt and less sugar.  I used blueberry yogurt for my first batch, and next time I'm trying vanilla.  I also passed on the sugar.

This smoothie was great! The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I did not follow the recipe exactly. I used more strawberries, only 2 T of sugar and 1tsp of vanilla, and I used Chobani raspberry yogurt because that's all I had. It turned out really good and my 2yr old LOVED it.

I combined this recipe with the strawberry oatmeal smoothie recipe from this website. For 1 serving, I used 5 frozen strawberries, 1/2 banana, 1/2 cup almond milk, 1/2 cup silken tofu, 1 teaspoon of vanilla, 1 tsp sugar and 1/4 cup of oatmeal blended finely in the food processor. No ice needed as the frozen strawberries, cold milk & tofu do the trick. Thick, creamy, filling and delish! Paired that with one or two pieces of butterball turkey bacon. Little to no calories or one piece of butterball turkey sausage. YUM!!!!

This was very tasty and easy. I used frozen strawberries but kept everything else the same. My three year old daughter even loved it!! Will make on a regular basis.

FABULOUS! We had all the ingrediants on hand and for my 18 month old, we did no sugar, plain yogurt and whole milk. For my husband we did extra sugar, plain yogurt and more of everything! Easy and fast!

This recipe has become very useful for me. We use it a lot! It is great as is, but we really like it with either greek yogurt or vanilla normal yogurt. This smoothie has kind of become a guidline for us, as we sometimes substitute things in and out, like half of the strawberries for some mango, or just keep it the same and add extra fruit. It really is great! It is really difficult to mess up which makes it even better!

Wow my family loved it!  It was a little watery for us, so I added an extra half cup of yogurt.  Just for fun I threw in a banana.  This is now a family favorite.

This smoothie, was awesome, easy and good for you! I followed recipe, but did decrease sugar to 2 tbls., used 2% milk and used 2 tsp Imitation Vanilla, also added one banana. Used chop feature on blender and it came out perfect. MD always recommends yogurt following tummy troubles and yet my kids don't like the taste. This was great way to get yogurt with probiotics into teen just getting over the flu! He is asking for another! Thanks for the recipe.

I hate berry smoothies. Sounded good today though so I looked for a recipe that had the most reviews. I did change it a bit. I added everything at the same time (didn't read the directions). Used a bag of mixed berries and probably added around 7oz of yogurt. For added flavor I used peach yogurt with a few spoonfuls of strawberry yogurt. Ten minutes later (counting defrosting time) my son and I are fighting over our smoothie. Yum!

This was awesome! I tweaked mine by using 1 container of Yoplait strawberry flavored yogurt, 3 small scoops Bryers extra creamy vanilla ice cream and real vanilla extract. To die for.

Made with 8 frozen strawberries, not fresh, used vanilla yogurt instead of plain, added half a banana and halved the sugar/vanilla. A yummy base recipe for any strawberry smoothie!

My kids have rated this their favorite smoothie of the summer.  They drank all of one batch in a matter of minutes and wanted me to make more.  I like the fact that the recipe is very specific.  I made it exactly as written, even counting the strawberries and ice cubes.  It was very thick, refreshing, and yummy!

Pretty good! I followed the advice of other reviewers and started with less sugar (1T) and vanilla (1t) because I thought I could always go sweeter. I did feel that it was not sweet enough, so I did add the sugar back in (didn't feel like I needed to add more vanilla) to 3T total. I guess it's really just personal preference.

Made this to use up a so-so attempt at homemade yogurt.  Used vanilla soy milk. A little sugar and frozen strawberries from this spring.  Super yum.  All kids loved it on a 100 degree day.

Yum! Deliciousness in a glass! I used strawberry yogurt instead b/c I didn't have plain yogurt, worked like a charm...definitely a creamier sweet smoothie, I only used 2 tablespoons of sugar instead of 3....this was a great excuse to try out the Cuisinart Smart Stick Hand Blender we just got.

I thought it was good, just a little too runny for me.  Next time I'll maybe try adding less milk.  I also used vanilla yogurt and added a couple more strawberries and some blueberries.  It was still good, just runny.

This one gets a middle of the road rating. One thought it was 'fantastic', one 'ok', one didn't care much for it at all. It was made exactly as the recipe states save for using agave for sweetener. The tart tang of the strawberries and plain yogurt were overpowering. I think vanilla yogurt would be a better choice for this smoothie, with half the sweetener or none at all. If I used vanilla yogurt, I would still use the vanilla extract as that added a  little something 'extra' that sets this smoothie apart from the rest.

My first smoothie and I really liked it! Instead of plain yogurt, I used light vanilla yogurt. This eliminated the need for the vanilla extract and white sugar called for. Replace strawberries with frozen berries and a banana...yum! The possibilities are endless.

I gave this 4 stars because it needed a little lemon juice to be 5 stars. If you double the ingredients, like I did, then add 1 full tsp. lemon juice. Otherwise, just 1/2 a tsp. will do for the default ingredient portions. I used frozen strawberries and did not use any ice. I used my Ninja to make this, and it was awesome and smooth! I did not take the route to add a banana because I wanted a strawberry smoothie, not  strawberry and banana smoothie...that would just change the name of the recipe...LOL

My 7 year old asked for a smoothie so we decided on this recipe. I used frozen strawberries and three packets of Truvia instead of sugar.  Used Greek yogurt with strawberries. No ice. My son really liked it.  I asked what he would do to change anything about the recipe and he said "take out the seeds".  So I strained it for him and he loved it. Great recipe. We'll try blueberry tomorrow.

Great recipe with just a few minor adjustments.  I used 10 frozen strawberries for better taste and convenience (didn't need ice cubes).  I also reduced the sugar - 2 Tbsp still makes a sweet smoothie.  Low-fat vanilla yogurt adds sweetness and flavor.  The best smoothie I've ever had.  Add bananas and kiwi for variety.  Even my husband, who doesn't like healthy smoothies, loved this one!

Took several suggestions from other reviewers. Used low fat vanilla yogurt, 1 Equal packet, 1 tsp vanilla extract and added banana.  Had to forward this to friends before I even finished it.

This was very delicious. I used soy milk instead and added some ground flax seed for omega 3's and to be more filling. Also it was very thick so I also added some orange juice. Very good and simple. Will definitely make again!

I added a dash of almond extract as well, and it turned out UBER yummy! Even my hubby who doesn't like smoothies, liked it.

Delicious.  I used frozen strawberries, strawberry yogurt instead of plain, and just a dash of Splenda.  Topped with whipped cream!

This was a quick and delicious smoothie to make! We had some strawberries around the house, and I really wanted a smoothie. I tweaked the recipe a bit- used strawberry yogurt instead of plain or vanilla, as it was on sale at the store- and it was really good! I used the same amount of the other ingredients as the recipe called for.

I made this 3 times trying hard to find the 4 1/2 rating it ranks.  The original way, with a banana and with a banana and flavored yogurt.  Each time we felt it was just O.K.

This was a great smoothie. I made some changes that made it outstanding! Instead of plain yogurt, I used low fat strawberry yogurt. I omitted the sugar and vanilla extract. I added 1T peanut butter and 1 scoop vanilla protein powder. This was yummy and worth a try !

Great recipe!  I usually omit the sugar, use vanilla yogurt and sometimes will use frozen berries instead of the ice.  This recipe is so easy and the kids love it.

I followed the recipe and my kids loved it. It was a bit bitter for my taste so maybe next time I'll use vanilla or strawberry yougurt. Other than that, great basic recipe!

Delicious! Very creamy & refreshing. I used Splenda (2 tsp.) instead of sugar, and I used Vanilla Yogurt, Frozen Whole strawberries, so I did not need the ice. The whip up great in my Magic Bullet!

Very good. For the most part you can make it as thick or as thing as you woulod like it to be. Next time I will try this with other fruit. This is very easy to make. I always have a bag of frozen strawberries in my house and pop em' in the microwave to thaw.

We made it exactly (ingredients) as it said but I did do one thing differently so that I didn't have to use ice, I froze my strawberries too and it was as delicious as buying one from Juice-it-up or another smoothie place! Thick and yummy! If it is too thick for you add more milk, if it's not thick enough add the milk a little at a time until you get your desired thickness! I will DEFINITELY make this again...and I have found a new use for frozen fruit! One more thing...I had a nectarine that was getting too ripe so I cut it up and froze it and used it another day in this smoothie! Great job!

This was a really good and I don't usually like strawberries by themselves in smoothies.  My only change is that I used vanilla yogurt instead of plain.  (Personal preference.) A great consistency with measurements in recipe. Thank you!

Doubled the recipe for 4 adults and 2 kids.  Used vanilla yogurt and didn't use the white sugar, instead added 3 scoops of vanilla protein powder.  We all loved it!

So good! Made this tonight with what I had on hand. Made pretty much as directed, but used a frozen blend of blueberries, blackberries and raspberries and a small carton of blueberry yogurt. YUM!

I loved this and I'm picky when it comes to smoothies.  I used vanilla yogurt, 2% milk, frozen strawberries, and only 1tsp of vanilla.  I think I would like it a bit thicker, but otherwise it's fantastic.

This recipe was perfectly delicious!! It was a little on the sweet side but, all in all, a very scrumptuous treat! Instead of plain yogurt, I used black cherry which gave it a different kind of flavour, still awesome in flavour!

This is a delicious drink, we thought it tasted like a milkshake instead of a smoothie.  We cut in half the amount of sugar, vanilla, and ice.  Since it tasted like a milkshake with that ratio, it must be really sweet with the full amount!

The first time I made this I used half a cup of blueberries instead of strawberries (they are soooo good for you so I have been trying to eat more).  It turned out wonderful!  The second time added half a banana.  This recipe is great for whatever kind of fruit you have on hand.  If you want it every bit healthier, I thought 1 TB of sugar was great!  Thank you for the recipe!

I used AMZY's suggestions (except that I substituted about 2 tsp of honey--and I think that it would be great even without the added sugar) and it turned out absolutely fabulous!

This was a very good way to use extra strawberries I had on hand. One thing I added, which sounds odd but was very good, was a splash of vanilla coffee creamer to counteract the tartness of the yogurt and which gave it more of a creamy vanilla flavor.

Pretty good smoothie!  I used vanilla yogurt and didn't have skim milk so used regular 2%.  Will add bananas next time.

Thanks a ton for the recipe! I made it for my mom for mothers day and she loved it. I had a little bit myself. Instead of using eight strawberries, I used six and it turned out just fine. It also tasted good without the vanilla.

This smoothie was very good but it wasn't very thick and a little to sweet. If you prefer a rich, thick, creamy dessert then don't put so much milk in it.

The smoothie has a really good flavor, except I needed a little more sugar. I didn't have yogurt, so I simply excluded it all together. It turned out great without it.

My kids and I love this recipe! We have it with breakfast all the time. I cut the sugar down to 2 tablespoons and it is still sweet enough for us.

DELICIOUS! We got a new blender for the holidays and  I have been trying many new recipes... well lets just say with my creations I appalled my mother twice and turn my dads  nose up once, which by the way says a lot because he eats anything. FINALLY with this recipe I have found something even I can make and my family actually enjoys! Thanks Lisa and Brittany!!!!

Excellent! I’ve tweaked this recipe a couple of times by either adding a banana and less strawberries, and then using a protein powder smoothie instead of the milk. But it’s great just how it is.

I made this with 8 frozen strawberries, half a frozen banana, 1/2 cup unsweetened vanilla almond milk, 1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt, 1t vanilla, 2 packets of Truvia, and 1/2 cup water (since all my fruit was frozen). It's a lot of substitutions, but I wanted to make it healthier. It was amazing so I know it will taste amazing if you make it as written. Also, it was runny the way I made it, but I wanted to be able to down it quickly.

Excellent recipe! I had some homemade yogurt that didn't firm up as much as I liked. so I used one cup of the thinner yogurt with 1 tbsp of sugar, 1 teaspoon of vanilla and the eight strawberries. It was delicious! Thanks for the recipe

Soooooo yummy! I used vanilla yogurt instead of plain and left out the vanilla extract, and also used almond milk instead of the skim. Pretty much your perfect strawberry smoothie. :)

Instead of skim milk, I used unsweetened coconut milk and next time I’ll use a flavored yogurt, like honey or strawberry. This is a great idea to flesh out and add more flavors. I also used a banana and stevia packets.

My daughter and I made this and it was delicious!  We didn’t have any plain yogurt on hand so used strawberry yogurt instead.  I think it’d be good either way.  Also thinking about trying it with coconut milk in place of the skim milk.

i made it but instead of using regular yogurt, i used chobani blueberry yogurt and it is even better than the vanilla ...                   then i made a black raspberry version of it and used peach yogurt with it and it was amazing !

Way too sweet.  My kids hated it and I thought the vanilla extract made it taste like chemicals.  Annoyed I wasted nice strawberries on this.

Delicious! I love strawberries! I only used Vitamin D milk instead of skim--it tasted fine with that tweak! I would make it again.

Delicious!!!!! My picky daughter loved this. We used vanilla Greek yogurt and reduced the sugar. Probably good with no added sugar when using vanilla yogurt. Yummy!!!!!!

Yuck! This had a terrible texture, and I could only faintly taste the strawberry, which was a surprise because there were eight strawberries. There was a yucky taste left in my mouth, and definitely wasn't healthy. I never finished it.

Very good smoothie! I used low-fat milk, plain Greek yogurt and reduced the sugar to 1 T. I skipped the ice because my strawberries were frozen and added a little frozen banana and vanilla protein powder. Delicious and healthy!

I made half of it and used vanilla Greek yogurt, 1 1/2 T of sugar, and since I couldn’t find it at the time, no vanilla extract. It was still delicious! The ratio of ice to smoothie is perfect and it blended easily.

This is so good! Used some vanilla yogurt and regular (not skim) milk and it was still delicious. As someone who doesn't really like strawberries I made it for my little sister, trying it surprised me very much because I thought it was delicious. Must try, easy to make. Very quick!

I love the fantastic smoothie, but I like to recommend another edition to add to it to make it even better! You can add blue berries, it really makes it better.

Simple and Yummy! I modified it a bit: used almond milk instead of skim milk, Aprivia instead of sugar, added 1/2 banana, added 1/4 c blueberries. Definitely a keeper!

I mean the smoothie wasn't bad, but it wasn't the best. I used plain yogurt ( which I love) and 2% milk instead of skim, but the ingredient that really threw it all off was the vanilla. It made it a little bitter and it left me with a bad aftertaste in my mouth.

Awesome!!! Had to adjust a little bit. I didn’t have vanilla extract, so I used a 6oz vanilla yogurt and strawberry banana yogurt. 1 banana and only 1 tbsp of sugar. It tasted great!!! Thanks

I used vanilla yogurt, frozen fruit and a T sugar.  I didn’t have any ice but with frozen fruit I didn’t need it.  It was great!   Makes me look forward to fruit and milk.

Very good recipe. I added a banana and used almond milk instead of skim. I would make it again with less sugar and maybe add some oats.

This was the best strawberry smoothie that I think i've ever had!! Its was so good! Siblings loved it! Thanks for sharing, I will be making this again FOR SURE! I did do some tweeking to make the amount less, like 5 strawberries, seven ice cubes, dash of vanilla, and I actually just pored the milk untill it hit the top of all of the ingredients and just put in five spoon fulls of yogurt. And used a Tablespoon Truvia instead of sugar. And if anyone is wondering I used the medium sized blender cup fro the Nutrabullet. Thanks!

I have to say I liked this recipe. Although I was thinking I was going to have to leave a negative review the first few sips, all my negative thoughts were gone once I added ice and I tasted it when it was ice cold, not just cool. This drink is not good just room temperature, and gross warm. Don't forget the ice.

This is going to be our go-to smoothie recipe from now on.  We prefer frozen smoothies over just the blended juice kind. So far we've used strawberries, bananas and blueberries, but I think any fruit could be substituted. It's also good with or without vanilla and/or sugar--just depends on your sweet tooth and personal taste. I like using Splenda and adding a couple tablespoons of whey protein powder. I'm looking forward to mixing up more ingredients and even trying some kale or spinach mixed in.

For me, this was the best smoothin I'very ever had. Made exactly as shown except had to use frozen berries which didn't hurt it a bit. Am going to try with raspberries next.   I hate bananas so this is ideal for me.

I had around 20 strawberries, one container of vanilla yogurt to act as both ht yogurt and the extract, a large cup of ice, and 2 tablespoons of sugar. The only thing I would change is no sugar. This was an outstanding recipe. Definitely having again!

I kept it as simple as possible using just strawberries, yogurt and milk and 1 tsp of sugar.  It was delicious. We had a ton of strawberries and over the next couple days I made it for breakfast and managed to use up all the strawberries.  Totally good.

Love the basic premise.  After having this approximate recipe over the years, think I've improved it by replacing the ice cubes with a frozen, overripe banana.  Also use orange juice in place of the milk.  When I feel more decadent, I'll throw in a scoop of a vanilla-based ice cream.  Yum!!

We all loved this, especially the kids! I used 9%MF vanilla yogurt, 2% milk, frozen sliced strawberries and bananas (about 1 cup), 1/2 tsp pure vanilla extract and 1tbsp sugar. So creamy and delicious! Next time, I will try it with raw honey instead of sugar. This is a keeper!

I made exactly as directions stated and I wouldn't change a thing! In fact, I used it for my daughter's wedding morning and served to all the bridesmaid; I had made this before using the suggestions of vanilla yogurt etc and I did not like as much. My husband went all healthy on me and I just substituted unsweetened vanilla almond milk for the milk and added about 3 TBSP. of honey instead of sugar and did not use vanilla at all and it was still yummy.

I used vanilla Greek yogurt instead of plain.  I also used less milk than it calls for because I wanted it thicker.  It was still a little thin, but it is delicious!

This was the best smoothie I ever had( and made myself!) I changed a little bit but not much. I only used 4 ice cubes and added 1 Frozen  banana , I also added a few extra strawberries. I do recommend a little less of the yogurt or maybe use vanilla because the bitter taste of the plain was strong. But overall it was simple and delicious.

This shake was deeeeeelicious!!! I substituted Dannon Lite Vanilla Yogurt (for plain yogurt) and 2 packets of Truvia (for sugar). This brought my drink to a well-rounded 100 calories per serving, and the recipes makes two servings [ about 8 oz. each] .

I looked for a recipe to use up strawberries and really liked this one.  I substituted fat free sour cream instead of yogurt because that"s all I had on-hand and only used 2 TBS of sugar.  It worked very well and I definitely will make again.

This is a very great smoothie recipe, although I would definitely only add 1t of vanilla. Other than that, it's delicious. I used vanilla greek yogurt, for I was out of regular yogurt. Great consistency.

I took the suggestions found in other reviews and my recipe was this:
10 hulled strawberries
1 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon vanilla yogurt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup milk
4 ice cubes
It was great!

I used low-fat vanilla yogurt in place of the plain yogurt and reduced the vanilla to 1 tsp.  I used 3 tbsp of Splenda instead of real sugar. The result was fantastic - the taste had just the right amount of sweetness, and the texture was light and smooth. I also really loved that this smoothie didn't require bananas.

Thanks for such a great and tasty recipe:)
I use the KitchenAid hand blender to make such smoothie! I think you know about this manufacturer a lot, if not you may read on bestadvisor.com or techradar.com.
The process of preparation may be not so fast like in the counter top blender, but i get used) With the help of this blender you will get very homogeneous consistency.

I love it! I changed out the plain yogurt with vanilla yogurt and it tasted amazing. I would suggest using vanilla yogurt if you are going to make it. The second time I made it I didn't put the sugar in, still tastes great. I think that if you use plain yogurt then you have to add the sugar. Quick and easy I love it!

Absolutely delicious. I added 2 tablespoons instead of 3 of sugar. Also, I used frozen strawberries which eradicated the need for ice. I also used unsweetened Greek yogurt and thinned it down with 1/4 cup of water. Overall, it tastes delicious and it's like a healthier version of a strawberry shortcake.

Not as thick as I wanted it, whether it's because the ice we have is smaller in size, so we added possibly more than listed or that we clicked liquify rather than the blend button on the blender. It was still amazing.

It was good! I made a few changes though, I used raspberries instead of strawberries and I used vanilla yogurt instead of plain so I just left out the vanilla extract.

I had a taste for strawberries, so I decided to make a smoothie for breakfast.  And I'm glad I chose this recipe.  It's amazingly delicious and quick!

This is fantastic!! I used strawberry yogurt in stead of plain. It has a pretty strong strawberry flavor, but we love strawberries in this house. I might try chocolate milk next time. The original recipe is the smoothest best tasting smoothie I have ever made at home!

I will definitely make this again. I added half a banana for a different taste, and I also only used 2 tablespoons of sugar and 5 ice cubes (but mostly just because my blender is small). The consistency came out wonderful and I even garnished it with cocoa. I would have taken a picture but didn't see the option... Now it's too late because it is in my tummy.... Yum yum!

My son and I have nailed down a healthy strawberry-banana smoothie. Add one whole banana, frozen strawberries, unsweetened vanilla-flavored Almond Milk, 1/2 cup vanilla Greek yogurt. You can add spinach leaves, flaxseed or chia seeds for more nutrition.

This is really good but instead of using sugar and vanilla, I just used vanilla Greek yogurt.  I have also played around with different fruit, as well: blueberries, strawberry & banana, snuck in some carrots, apples, and sugar snap peas on the ones I made for the kids. All very good.  Using frozen fruit rather than adding ice is definitely the way to go!

My recommendation is to use whatever yogurt you usually eat and whatever milk you usually drink. I always make smoothies and such with vanilla yogurt (or flavored yogurt), as it adds the sugar and vanilla without me having to guess. Whole or 2% milk works best for me as it makes it thicker than other milks do. Definitely gonna use this as a base though!

Absolutely delicious. I used what I had. Used Silk Soy Milk instead of skim milk, vanilla yogurt instead of plain, 1/2 of the vanilla extract, turbinado sugar instead of white, and doubled everything for 2.5 servings. It was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!

I made this recipe this morning for my two young children. I used frozen strawberries instead of fresh since it's November--plus, I have found that using frozen fruit brings iciness to smoothies without watering them down.  My youngest child is currently demolishing his breakfast smoothie, but my older child took a few sips and isn't touching it--maybe the plain yogurt had too much of a tangy flavor for him?  I might try it with vanilla next time to see if he'll go for it.  I tasted it and think it tastes just like a strawberry milkshake!

I have been looking for a creamy strawberry smoothie recipe for a year for my daughters - and this one finally hit the mark!  I used strawberry yogurt because I didn't have vanilla, and used Hobo Power's recommendation of 1 T sugar, 1 tsp vanilla and had frozen bananas so threw them in too. YUM!

I've made this using both plain yogurt and vanilla yogurt. I use frozen strawberries and no ice.  It's very thick, so I sometimes increase the milk.  It's very tasty!

OMGoodness!  This was so super yummy!   I made it for the first time after reading a few reviews and following recommendations on a few minor adjustments.   The  changes I made were:

 - 1 Tbs. of sugar
- 1 tsp. pure vanilla extract (don't like the artificial stuff and    not worth the savings on skimping out on the real deal)
- 1/2 cup of vanilla yogurt 

Will DEFINATELY be making this again, but trying some other fruits as well.  Peaches will be next! :)

I've never made a smoothie so used this as my base, following the recipe for the milk, yogurt and vanilla. Added a frozen banana and 2 frozen strawberries. Omitted the sugar -  very tasty and nice consistency. I froze in single servings and put in fridge the night before and it was perfect for breakfast.

Delicious smoothie! Only changed a couple of things (I used 2% milk and added a ripe banana), but I will definitely be making this again! When it first came out from the blender, it was pretty runny, so I let it set in the fridge for 5 minutes and it got thicker :)

Loved it - delicious strawberries and cream smoothie! The recipe as is made only about 1.5 servings, so I doubled it and froze it for later (thawing over night makes it perfect in the morning - didn't use ice cubes since I knew I was going to freeze it). Used vanilla Greek nonfat yogurt because it was all I had, and reduced the vanilla to 1 teaspoon for a double recipe and the sugar down to 1/2 a tablespoon. I'm expecting my baby to crush this once she gets a taste....

This was really good, especially considering I don't usually like smoothies. I made it with vanilla Greek yogurt as the only difference, which gave it plenty of natural protein!

I was looking for a smoothie recipe to give me an idea of what to put together for my husband who was recovering from a stomach bug. I used strawberry yogurt and a frozen banana instead of the ice cubes/strawberries and omitted the sugar altogether. Tasted great! This is a good base to tweak flavors as desired.

Awesome. We all loved it. I did use vanilla yogurt instead of plain though, but we like sweet. It was perfect.

I've been making this for years, but instead of the sugar, I add a banana.  For extra protein, I use plain Greek yogurt.  If I know I have to be out and about early the next morning, I make it the night before, add the ice cubes and blend.  It's a great way to start your day!

I adapted this to work for SBD Phase 2. All I did was use Splenda instead of sugar. Sometimes I add more strawberries if I have a couple left over. It's always delicious! I've been drinking this on and off for 3 years.

Made this recipe this morning. Slightly tweaked it based on what I had on hand. I also doubled the recipe. So 1 cup of low fat vanilla yogurt, 1 cup of skim milk, 1 cup of mixed frozen berries, 1 Tbl. sugar, and a dash (tsp.) of vanilla. It filled 2 Solo cups. It came out to 5 WW points per serving based on their Recipe Builder. Definitely will use this as my go to smoothie. I might even do without the vanilla. Yum!

I think that it was easy and fun to make! It was fresh, but don't put a lot of yogurt because you then will taste it a lot! Other then that I think you should try it like I did!

Used Truvia in place of sugar, 2% milk since that was on hand and about a cup of chopped ice from the ice maker.  Such a versatile recipe to use and adjust.  Hubby had his half gone before I even got to taste mine!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I used vanilla yogurt instead of just plain yogurt and I also used about a cup of frozen blueberries instead of strawberries and it was GREAT! I usually don't like smoothies but this was an exception. I definitely would try it again!

Let me just say, this smoothie is AMAZING! The flavor of the vanilla gives it a unique taste. To blend this smoothie, I used my vitamix. I added a few extra strawberry's and ice cubes, and instead of using plain yogurt, I used the fruit on the bottom peach chobani greek yogurt. I hope all chefs, families, and children try this recipe. It's sooo easy and tastes so good.

I really enjoyed this smoothie.  Used French vanilla yogurt and deleted the sugar and vanilla extract.  I may try Chef Bailey's suggestion about adding half a banana.  Thanks, B & L!

Followed the base recipe. A little thin, but very tasty. I wonder if the mixture would freeze and defrost well...I'd love to make a large batch of these and freeze them for a easy treat, and to prevent my produce from going bad in the heat.

Love this easy recipe!  Use vanilla yogurt instead of plain to avoid the over tartness. Added 1/2 a banana and used frozen strawberries! Super delicious. My toddler loved it when I made it with vanilla yogurt, spit it out when I used plain yogurt.

I didn't have any yogurt so I added 1/2 of milk for one serving. I also added 1/2 a tsp. more of sugar and vanilla along with 1/2 a banana. The smoothie turned out delicious. :-)

It's really yummy. I used strawberry yogurt and it really helped with the strawberry flavor. I hope it gives me a boost for my track meet today!

I used this recipe to make my very first smoothie...and I'm so glad I did. It was delicious! I'm going to try again with a few changes, like adding other fruits, or flavored yogurt. Loved it!

My girls and I love this. I was out of plain yogurt, so I replaced it with vanilla yogurt and cut out the sugar and vanilla extract, and it turned out great.

5 Stars for for simply being a great smoothie. We made it the first time around as directed but, due to my diabetic constraints, made it the second time around using 1 Tbsp Splenda, 1 Tsp Almond Extract, Plain Greek Yogurt, Fat Free Milk and, to sweeten it just a bit more, a cup of blueberries. Turned the blender on and, when finished, Smoothie Nirvana!

Thanks for a versatile Smoothie Recipie!

Very good.  Super easy.  I used frozen strawberries so I did not use the ice at all.  The thickness was just perfect.  I also modified with a Tablespoon of powdered vanilla and 1/4 cup of sugar, since I used tangy plain yogurt.

Made this smoothie and the taste was on point. Wish it was thicker but maybe that's because I didn't add ice.

This tasted wonderful, even on a cold wintry morning.  Reminded me of summertime.  I used frozen, pre-sliced strawberries and reduced the amount of ice I put in (and probably could have omitted it entirely).

Best basic smoothie recipe I have found - with no modifications.  Making small variations such as strawberry yogurt instead of plain, adding a banana, and frozen strawberries only made it better.

Super good!!! I love this smoothie! I'm not a big smoothie person, but that has changed for the good!!!! The only thing I would change, would be a little less vanilla extract. But overall, amazing!!!

It was good. I used Greek yogurt (honey flavor) instead and decreased the amnt. of sugar and vanilla extract to one (of their corresponding measurements) each. Really great recipe though.

I did use vanilla yogurt instead of plain, so I only put in 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tbsp sugar.  My kids loved it.  I would guess that the original recipe is just as good.

I have been making this recipe since summer of 2013 when I found it. Absolutly DELICIOUS! I love it so much! i also add in a little more vanilla and it is even better! I used vanilla yogurt but didn't notice a difference. Which is great! :) and i have used no yogurt before, just milk, and also heavy cream! everything is great and I make the smoothie all the time!

Made this smoothie with some alterations. Instead of using sugar I used 3 tbs. Agave Nectar (light), added half of frozen banana, and used unsweetened almond milk. It was delicious. Next time I will try the strawberry yogurt as the plain does have a tart taste to it.

The original recipe I started out using was very much like this except I started out using cherry or strawberry Kool Aid as the liquid base. I realized I don't really like a strong fruit flavor so I tried soy milk. Here's the way I made it to my preference, just as a suggestion to try: Great Value (Wal Mart's brand) light original organic soy milk, Stoneyfield organic French Vanilla yogurt, about 1/2 to 2/3 cup blueberries, about 1/2-3/4 very ripe banana, 3-6 whole strawberries and real maple syrup to sweeten to taste. Also, about 3-6 ice cubes to make it really cold. (You can leave the ice out if using frozen fruits and for slightly thicker texture.) Sorry, I don't have exact amounts b/c I don't really measure anything, just "eyeball it."  Even though I "made it my own" I still rate the original recipe 5 stars b/c it is a good combo of ingredients, I just don't like as strong a fruit flavor in mine. Even if you prefer the recipe listed exactly as written, I suggest at least trying the maple syrup instead of sugar as it is a natural sweetener (unless allergic to it of course!).

It was really good!!!  A little less vanilla extract would make it more affordable for a breakfast (everyday) smoothie. vanilla extract where I am is expensive!!!

This recipe was okay. I wound up having to tweak it just a little to get it to taste sweet enough for my kids. I had to add 1 1/2 bananas and I didn't even count how many berries I put in. I added all of the sugar and it made it sweet, but not the "right" kind of sweet I was looking for, if that makes any sense.

Easy and delicious! I use fresh strawberries whenever possible, vanilla soy milk, a little crushed ice, honey-flavored greek yogurt, one tube of strawberry Gogurt (always at my DD's request) and either a squirt of honey/agave or a packet of Splenda.

Great smoothie! I loved the taste, but I changed a few things. Unless you like a sour smoothie, use strawberry or vanilla yogurt instead of plain. Also, I did not add vanilla extract, halved the sugar, used full fat milk, 4 ice cubes, and 10 strawberries! Tastes delicious, thanks for the recipe!

Fantastic!! I used a tablespoon of honey in place of the sugar and vanilla yogurt instead of plain (didn't have plain on hand). I also added one banana to the recipe like another reviewer suggested. So good we drank them right down and made a second round!

It is a delicious smoothie without the vanilla. when you add the vanilla it gives the smoothie a bitter after taste. I made it without the vanilla and it was good.

This was awesome!  It reminded me so much of Orange Julius.  I didn't have plain yogurt so I used blueberry, which was good.  I also made this using vanilla yogurt and added bananas to it as well.  I could drink these all day!  Thanks for the recipe!!!!!

This was a delicious smoothie! It rivaled those at famous smoothie chains. I used vanilla almond milk instead of regular milk and also used vanilla greek yogurt and thought 3 tablespoons of sugar was too much. Next time I will cut the sugar in half. Regardless, I will definitely be making this again.

Love this! I have even tried it without the yogurt and double the milk and it still was wonderful. I use a food processor to blend and that could be why it is always thick! :) My 3 year loves it!

Just gorgeous, not too sweet and very versatile.  Mixing up the fruit combination but keeping the rest of the recipe the same makes for great variety in the morning when I drink mine.

We've made this 3 times now and it's delicious!  Kids and adults both love it.  We use frozen (handpicked) strawberries (and usually add more strawberries) then omit the ice.  i use french vanilla flavored yogurt and reduced the amount of sugar by about a 1/2 (we usually half the recipe because 1 serving is a good amount for 2 small children).

Great smoothie! Used frozen whole strawberries thawed not quite completely and didn't add any add'l sugar and only about 1 tsp of vanilla extract. Yummy! I'll definitely make this again.

Really good!  We made it just like the recipe using frozen strawberries, plus I added one small container of Activia light vanilla yogurt.  This doubled well and fit into my medium-sized blender.  Lots of fun to make with kids.  Thanks!

We use our store's brand of frozen fruit and therefore do not need ice.  We also use soy milk in this recipe, otherwise it is followed to the letter and delicious.

So good! I also cut down on the sugar by about half and tossed in half a banana after reading the reviews. I used frozen strawberries right out of the bag so I didn't add any ice. This way it came out kinda thick but still delicious. Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent smoothie recipe-we made it as is except for reducing the vanilla to 1 tsp and it was great. Can't wait to try it with bananas, kiwi, blueberries, and other yummy add ins. DD loved it too and since it's hard to get fruit in her I was really pleased about that.

Quick and Easy recipe...Used 7 Large fresh strawberries, 1 very ripe banana and fat free vanilla yogurt. My 3 year old son doesn't like yogurt and my 15 month old daughter doesn't like fruit, but both of them like this!! Good way to get them to eat healthy stuff!! Thanks for sharing - will definitely use other fruits this summer!

This recipe is great for curbing a sweet tooth! I used Dole frozen strawberries, 6oz. of Breyer's Light Vanilla Bean yogurt (instead of plain), 1 tsp. of vanilla (instead of 2), 1 Tbsp. of sugar (instead of 3), and left out the ice (since the strawberries were frozen). It was excellent! My 2 and 4 year old daughters even loved it and they are picky!

Great Smoothie! It's a really nice base recipe, you can mix things up and change the fruits and the flavor of yogurt. We had some friends over and made rasberry smoothies, they were a big hit!! We just got a Magic Bullet for Christmas and we were looking for a good smoothie recipe, this is definetly it!!

I was trying to re-create the soy strawberry-banana smoothie from Jamba juice and found this recipe to be a great base for it.  I used vanilla soymilk instead of milk, vanilla yogurt instead of plain, left out the vanilla and sugar, and added a banana to it.  It was fantastic!  If you find yours too thick, add another 1/4 cup of soymilk.  Yum!

Unbelievable!  This tastes very much like one of my all time favorites - the Starbucks Strawberry Frapuccino.  I split this batch with my husband but I'll have to double it if I ever intend to share.  Once my teenagers taste this, I'll have to buy the ingredients in bulk.

This was just ok.  I'm giving this 4 stars (instead of 3) since I changed it a bit.  I used a container of organic vanilla yogurt, 1 teaspoon of sugar, 6 strawberries, 1 banana and a splash of organic 2% milk.  It was thinner than I'd like until I added the banana.  I couldn't get myself to add the ice to it, just didn't sound good to me.

This was good. The changes I made were: I used vanilla yogart, & only 1 t. vanilla extract, & used frozen (thawed) strawberries. Next time I'm going to add another T of sugar. We had this at 6:30am ish & we were hungry around 9 but at least it was good. We'll be making these again.

Made this for my mom who could not have anything thinner than nectar after a valve replacement.  She loved it.  I used strawberry yogurt and frozen strawberries we had picked during the summer.  Had some myself and it was very good.

This was a very good recipe for a smoothie. It had a cool taste between strawberry milkshake and smoothie, but it kinda lacked that "WOW this is the best smoothie i have ever tasted!"taste. It was a very very good smoothie, but very similar to my basic add strawberrys and a bannana together and blend. ya know?  but all in all a good smoothie, just didn't really stand out from others I made.

Sry, I didn't like this at all. All you could taste was vanilla.

This is a great recipe for strawberry smoothie.  I try it with just a little bit less vanilla then the recipe calls for.  Enjoy.

A little bit too sweet - cut back on the sugar and vanilla for a more natural taste.

I loved this smoothie!  A special treat...I made at a party and the kids and pregnant friends loved having a special drink that is tasty and healthy. I used nonfat yogurt and it was great...I might try using the honey in place of sugar next time to see how that tastes too.

Really good.  Tried it with soft tofu for added protein and it was really good as well.  My husband likes it, but it is not filling enough for breakfast.
