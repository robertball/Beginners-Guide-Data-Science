These were really cute, and pretty good. I would take a previous user's suggestion and try it w/"scoop" tortilla chips, because the wonton wrappers worked well, but were a little lacking in flavor.

Pretty good!  I did make a couple changes to use what I had.  Instead of ground beef, I used some leftover shredded beef.  I threw that in the skillet with some of my homemade taco seasoning and 3 tablespoons of salsa.  I also add the cheese in with the beef mixture and let it melt.  After putting the mixture in the wonton cups I spoon about a teaspoon of salsa on top of each before baking.  8 minutes was just enough times to turn the wontons golden brown and crispy.  Topped each with a little bit of sour cream.  Delicious!  Thanks!

Big hit with the wife and yours truly. The only change I would make would be to cook the wonton wrappers for a minute or two before putting the filling in. Other than that it was great.

I was worried that I would mess these up but really, these were quite easy. I cut the recipe in half to make 12 taco "cups", I used ground turkey and I used homemade taco seasoning and homemade salsa. After they were done, I made a topping bar on the kitchen counter of chopped tomatoes, chopped onion, shredded lettuce, sour cream and additional salsa--we all topped our "cups" with our favorite toppings. I had ONE.......the boys ate the rest. NO leftovers. I'll make this one again. This is a fun new way for us to have taco night.

Very Good. My teenager wants me to make this all the time. I add lettuce, sour cream and a dice of tomato on top. They look great and taste great.

So good and so cute! I actually used refried beans instead of ground beef, as I was serving this with cheeseburgers. Topped with sour cream, black olives, tomato, and cilantro before serving. Thanks! :)

Took the advise of someone before me and put these into Scoops Tostitos chips with good results. This is a simple recipe to make a cute, quick appetizer.

These are great!  I had a hard time finding wonton wrappers, but Whole Foods had them in the DAIRY section.  These are great appetizers for a party.  I made them for a group of 8 and everyone loved them.  Perfect amount for a group of 8.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were easy and great. Next time I will add a little more sauce to the meat before I put them in the cups. They also might be good as pizza cups with the beef, green peppers, onions, pizza sauce and then the cheese. YUM!

These are so fun!  I browned my meat, then added the taco seasoning, rotel, and black beans.  I baked the wontons in the oven (at 375...425 was too hot, at least in my oven), for about 5 mins before filling, then I spooned in the meat, topped with cheese, and popped them back in for about 5-8 more mins.  Once they were melty, and the wontons golden brown, I topped with a little sour cream, avocado, and jalapeno.  I made these while we watched football last night, and sadly I think the dog got most of the second batch!  :(

So pretty, tasty and easy! These were better than almost any taco I've ever had. I baked the wrappers and then added all the other ingredients so that they wouldn't lose their crunch. I also used eggroll wrappers in a regular sized muffin tin and that really made for great proportions.

Topped them with guacamole and sour cream and they were very good. I used eggroll wrappers because I had them on hand and I didn't find them flavorless.

These were fun! My kids loved them. I just set bowls on the table with different toppings and they made up their own little bowls. I do suggest something in the bottom of the pan because some of my bottoms stuck and were very hard to get out. Will make these again!

Excellent recipe.  It's all over the internet in various forms; Campbell's version worked well for me.  I made it mostly as written, even down to using Pace, but I have made it in regular as well as mini-muffin cups.  Both work well.  One addition is to put a few crushed corn chips in the bottom of the wrapper before filling. That way you get a little corn tortilla flavor.  These really are adaptable to just about any combination of ingredients you want to try.  Don't let the well-done edges scare you, they're not burnt.

these were all gone! I modified a bit, based on reviews and my own personal opinion. I completely baked the wontons and 1/2 way thru cooking, I flipped to brown underside. Then I assembled filling ingredients inside. I topped with sour cream and diced tomatoes. I dont use PACE, too salty. Used reduced sodium taco seas and did not even add the salsa, until the end (I doled a little on top of meat & cheese, but under sr crm. Because of precooking before adding ingredients, I had no probs with soggy bottoms (this could be because I didnt add watery salsa before cooking wontons either) and no probs with them sticking in muffin pan.

These little things rock. I used a regular muffin pan and brushed olive oil on the wrappers and stuck in the oven while it was preheating for 3 minutes. I then put Spanish rice on the bottom and then put taco meat with Colby jack cheese on top. When they came out after 10 minutes I had a topping bar waiting for the guests. I had cilantro, green onions, avacodo, lettuce tomatoes and sour cream.

These are delicious.  Of course I made a few changes to mine to make them a little richer because that's what we like.  With the taco beef I added 3 T. picante sauce, 2 T. sour cream and some fresh grated cheddar, stirred until the cheese was melted and evenly mixed.  I spooned into the wonton wrappers and topped with more grated cheddar and baked for time and temp suggested in recipe.  They were delicious!!  I also added chopped tomatoes, shredded lettuce and a dollop of sour cream to each.  I wish I could take a picture but not one was left!  I will be making these very often.

Great Idea! These went over very well today with company. There were adults and children and all loved them. I placed the wrappers in the tins and baked them for approx. 4 min. and then continued with the recipe. This really helped with the soggy bottom problem. I also could not find Pace Taco Seasoning and bought a different brand that was in a 1.5 oz package. This was just a little too much flavor/salt. I will back off the seasoning packet just a little next time if I have to use this size again. We topped them with sour cream, lettuce and tomato. Very cute and we will make them again. Thanks for sharing!

These were really easy and fun!  Didn't change anything outside of adding the salsa to the tops after baking.  I also piped some sour cream on top before serving.  Excellent recipe for football nights.

were okay...but meat came out greasy even after draining it well. I would make again using my own spices like cumin to flavor meat..drain and pat dry..I used my own homemade HOT salsa so they had a good kick.  I will try prebaking wontons a bit before as suggested since bottoms were soggy. tasty tho'.

These were fun and different. The wonton wrappers do lack flavor, but I still thought they were good and a neat idea.I did use kroger brand taco mix and followed the instructions on the packet for the meat.

These were good....excellent appetizers, I think the problem I experienced was that because the oven was in use, I used our roasting oven, which you can bake in as well, but it wasn't as even in its baking, so the tips were golden but not the rest of the wonton.  I will try these again and make them in the oven.  Overall, everyone loved them despite my feelings about it...

Awesome, such a crowd-pleaser. I used Old el Paso burrito seasoning instead and I feel like it made a difference in the texture (less crumbly than using taco seasoning, I think there's some cornstarch in it) and it  gave me about 8 more mini tacos. I also had to omit the salsa (mine was bad), so topped it with siracha sauce instead, if you like it spicy this is the way to go.

Love these! Made beef for husband and kids, and made chicken for myself. Husband said chicken was almost better than beef! Used phyllo cups instead of wonton wrappers, delicious!

Everyone loved these! This is SO easy to adapt to your preferences or what you have on hand. I had the round potsticker wrappers so I used those, I had chorizo (already spiced so I didn't need taco seasoning) so I used that. Then topped with cheese, diced tomato, and cheese, letting the guests add sour cream, salsa, and guacamole if they wanted to. Also, I baked the wontons, added the warm meat mixture, and popped in the oven for a few more minutes... then topped with the toppings. Everyone really loved it!

Huge hit, I used Scoops and they worked wonderfully. I put in the beef mixture, salsa then cheese. Then made a separate topping bar with olives, chives and sour cream. I had one solitary appetizer left because everyone loved them and were afraid to eat the last one!

These were great!! My husband really loved them and suggested quite a variety of different fillings including seafood, quiche, stir-fry and even breakfast eggs and bacon. Very good and very easy.

Pretty good taco recipe. However I had to use chips because I couldn't find the wonton wrappers anywhere. But I enjoyed the tacos with chips it was very good.

Tried this recipe last night. They were a real hit.  I added 4oz. of cream cheese to meat mixture and I cooked the wonton wrappers for 5 minutes at 350 degrees before I added my meat mixture then 5 minutes after to melt the cheese. They came out wonderful. Topped them with sour cream and scallions. Would be a 5 star hit if the wontons had a little taste. They are very bland.

These tasted great, and were fun to eat.  I used the scoops chips like others suggested and just a regular cookie sheet (you can fit a lot more).  I'm not sure if I will make them again though because its basically the same as the nachos that I usually make, only it took a lot longer to fill each individual chip.

My very finicky 9 year old said she really, really, a billion times really love these. I followed the suggestions of others and crisped the wontons for a few minutes before filling them with beans, meat, and cheese, then put them in the oven to finish cooking. I had a variety of toppings- lettuce, salsa, avocado and tomatoes to suit everyone's taste. Yummy.

I made these using Tostito's Scoops.  They were good but somewhat labor-intensive for such a casual snack.  Sour cream is a must for these!

Neat idea, but I found that they fell apart easily and when I made them for a party, only a couple got eaten, simply because they took more effort than people were willing to give.

I love these... they are a little bit of work but well worth it! And making them in the hot hot weather we've had... However, my family and friends love them.  The one thing I do different is to brush the wantons with garlic olive oil to make them taste better.  Thanks so much!

I made these for a bunco party but they would be great for anytime too.  The only change I made is that I used 1/2 beef and 1/2 spicy sausage.  Everyone asked what was in them and wanted the recipe.  Several people said that they were so unique!

These lasted about 15 or 20 minutes at our party last night. Even picky kids loved them.  It is a good idea to cook the wonton wrappers on their own for a couple minutes first. Honestly, I'd never use any of that preservative-filled Pace brand stuff, but mine turned out great with homemade salsa and guac. A great idea for an appetizer.

THESE WERE GOOD! I used ground chicken. I pre-baked the wrappers in the pan for 4 mins to crisp them up. Also added a bit of corn into the mix. I don't know why it says to buy Salsa AND Sauce...it's the same thing with a different label. Unnecessary. I bought 1 jar of Pace Picante Sauce and it was just enough. Topped these off with some sliced black olives and a squirt of lime and sour cream. Had requests to make these all the time. Thanks!

This is a keeper.  My husband brought home eggroll wrappers by mistake, so I cut them in 4ths and put into mini muffin cups.  I tried baking cups first and then with meat and cheese.  It was the same either way.  We then added homemade salsa, finely chopped lettuce and tomatoes, sour cream and cheese.  The family loved them!!!

Delicious and easy! One tip though... cook the wonton for a few minutes before adding the toppings... I found it was crisper and easier to hold that way. And I made veggie ones with just black beans, salsa and cheese.

Perfect!!! These are the cutest way to serve up Tacos. My children loved these. I did what other reviewers suggested, I cooked the meat, added the Taco seasoning then put the Wonton wrappers in the muffin cups.( I used my silicone muffin holders) I did not brush them with EVO or butter. I added the meat only and cooked the wrappers for 8 minutes at 450. Once they were done everyone added their own fillings. I had sour cream, guacomole, tomatos and green onions.

These are a really good idea.  I followed other reviewer suggestions and painted with EVOO.  I won't be doing that next time.  I also did 1/2 meat and 1/2 refried beans.  They were cute, would have been perfect for a party but I made them as a weekend snack.

These were really good!  I used baked Tostitos scoops and filled half with taco meat and half with fat free spicy refried beans, topped with salsa and cheese and baked...then I garnished with light sour cream, chopped tomato and shredded lettuce.  I can see how you could get creative with these....black olives, jalapeno slices, etc... thanks for the great idea!  Oh, and fwiw, I preferred the ones with refried beans over the meat, but both were delicious.

I didn't use a package of taco seasoning (used my own concoction) and I added onions. Family adored them. Super cute. Loved them. Difficult to get out of the muffin pans intact though!

These were pretty good.  One thing, though.  They were kind of dry without adding a little bit of water.  My two sons and husband liked them, and they're picky.  I will probably make these again.

My husband loved these. I would have to agree that a prebaking the wontons for a few minutes would have made them crisper on the undersides. I will make these again though and play with the ingredients you could fill these with so many things.

Add the sour cream, olives, and a few diced tomatoes! That's what makes it 5 stars. A little bland without (3 or 4 stars, I'd say). I also added a small dab of refried beans that was a great addition.

Really good! I folded the wonton wrappers in half and flipped them halfway through cooking. They were almost as good as the fried version in restaurants.

these were so easy a little bland, I added brown rice to my seasoning and meat to stretch it and extra salsa to the mix... it still needed something I might season it a little more with something next time i make this.. all in all it was awesome, husband loved it too

This was a big hit at a bunco party I had. Instead of using the wanton rolls. I used pillsbury crescent rolls. They have a recipe like this on pillsbury.com. I just used this filling.

I made these for a superbowl party, and they went fast.  I accidentally grabbed eggroll wrappers instead of wonton, but I just cut them in quarters.  Spray the bottom of a mini-muffin tin, push in the wrappers, then spray again lightly to get a nice crispy browning.  I made this with 1 lb of crumbled spicy sausage, 1/2 jar of salsa, and 1 cup of monterey jack cheese.  Assemble right before serving.  I garnished with a little dollop of sour cream and some green onion.  Definite A+ for presentation

Very nice presentation, very nice idea! I used eggroll wrappers that I halved, since my local grocer didn't carry the wonton wrappers. ....not sure if this is why it came out kinda gummy underneath...But, if you do this, keep an eye on them. Not sure if it was just mine, or my oven, but these browned very quickly. Thanks for the great idea for mexican appetizers ;)>

Very good.  Quite easy too.  After starting to make these I realized I only had egg roll wrappers.  I cut them in fourths and used that way.  Per other reviews, I decided to bake the wrappers without the filling to crisp.  About 4 min at temp stated in recipe.  When making the filling I think I misread the recipe and put 1/2 cup salsa right into the meat mixture.  Then topped each with a spoonfull of salsa and cheese.  Baked them but they only needed about 4 min.  Husband loved them.  I liked too.  (I am not sure I am as crazy about the wrappers as I expected to be.  Maybe if I used the wonton wrappers I would LOVE them.) Still a very good recipe.  They look so cute.  Dipped in sour cream.

Last night I hosted our monthly Hooker Bash (crochet, of course). For a month or so I was searching for ideas to make for "-deourves." I came across this recipe and was sold. It turned out so great! I was very pleased with this. I used 1 lb of very lean hamburger and added about 2/3rds can of black beans. I didn't use the Pace brand taco seasoning, and I didn't use an entire packet of the other stuff either. I put 3 tbs of the Pace Picante Sauce in the meat/bean mixture as well as a small handful of the pre-shredded Mexican blend cheese. I put the wonton wrappers in the oven for 3 minutes by themselves as was suggested by previous reviewers. I then used about 1/2 tbs of meat/bean mixture to fill them and put them back in the oven for about 5 minutes. Also on the meat/bean mixture during that trip to the oven was a little bit of Pace Picante Salsa and some more cheese. While eating them, my guests put a tiny bit of sour cream on top. These were a HUGE hit. Now I hope my kids (pickiest eaters on the planet) will like them and I can make them all the time! Woo!

Have have now made these twice and they were a huge hit both times.  I cheated and used chili instead of a taco mix.  They were such a big hit that we started making other variations.  Smoked meat with cheese, and apples with cinnamon!

A pack of wonton wrappers has 48 wrappers-probably good with 1 pound of meat, though-2 pounds way too much. Cook meat with taco seasonings (it's a lot of seasoning) and mix with picante and salsa. Cook wonton wrappers for about 2 minutes alone, first. Add meat, cheese and bake for 8 minutes. Fine to cooke wrappers and mix meat ahead and assemble last minute. MAYBE FRESH SALSA?
