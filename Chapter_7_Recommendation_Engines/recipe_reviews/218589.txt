This was a real disappointment.  It was too dry and it fell apart, unable to make sandwiches the next day.  Considering it had the sloppy joe packet added, it was really flavorless.  We won't be making this again.  Expected more from the recipe, but it just doesn't please.

Came out mushy.  Flavor was ok, but not as intense as I would have liked.  Better with some extra sauce served on the side.  Too much bread crumbs maybe?

I mixed the envelope of sloppy joe mix to one can of tomato sauce, not paste. To 1 lb of ground meat I put half in the meat mixture and half on top. I also use chopped mushrooms and half cup of oats instead of breadcrumbs and no bacon. It was moist, and delicious.
