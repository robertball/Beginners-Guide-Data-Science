Besides for the fact I had the ingredients for this I was looking to use anyway, I just had to try this recipe given that only three people had reviewed it with very mixed reviews, averaging this out to a fairly low rating. I had to find out for myself! I agree with The Messy Cook wholeheartedly - this is a very nice bread with great raspberry/lemon flavor and the reviewer for whom this bread didn't rise probably didn't use self rising flour - or maybe it was OLD self rising flour. I left out the nutmeg and nuts and added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla for heightened flavor.  I couldn't have been more pleased. It's moist, pretty with its flecks of zucchini and dots of raspberry, and the amount of cinnamon is just right.  With zucchini so in season now, I hope others will give this recipe a try. It certainly is worth more than the 3-star rating it has right now. Great recipe reedfamilyof5!

The flavor of raspberry,zucchini,and cinnamon with the nuts is very nice. The bread may be better if 1 tsp.baking powder and/or soda and a bit of salt were added. Too soggy and dense.

This is a lovely bread.  If you don't have self rising flour, you can add 1 1/2 tsp of baking powder and 1/2 tsp of salt with all-purpose flour. The flavors blend beautifully.

i don't know what the other review was talking about. I love zesting things, so I was all for the lemon zest. And I was surprised by the raspberries and they complimented the bread well. And I think the other reviewer must have used regular flour instead of the self rising flour (which has baking powder and salt in it!). Do try :)

I made this bread last summer as my DIL had lots of zucchini in her garden.  It was such a big hit with my son, DIL & kids. I was hoping to find the recipe again since I didn't save it.  There are blackberries in the freezer, so will try them instead of the raspberries.

My fiance said this was the best bread I have made.  Instead of shredding the zucchini I finely chopped it and the grated lemon peel is a must for the flavor!

I can't believe that my friend and I are the only ones to have this problem:  when made as written it is not a bread batter but just crumbly crumbs.  I checked my Lemon Zucchini bread recipe (from this site) and it was very similar except it had twice the oil.  So we doubled it here to get the right consistency.  Otherwise yummy.

My final product was a dense bread with a lemony raspberry taste.  I didn't have lemon zest so I squeezed in a teaspoon of lemon juice and and half teaspoon of lemon extract. (Thanks to reviewer, Ann)  I used frozen raspberries but thawed them first.  Since other reviewer said the raspberries were tart I tossed them in sugar first. This will be a keeper for us.  Delicious!

Really enjoyed this recipe.  The first time I made it, I used all-purpose flour, so it came out like biscotti; the second time around, with the proper ingredients, it is amazing! Moist, light, and tangy.

I loved this.  The only change I made was substitued 1 tsp lemon peel (which I didn't have) with 1/2 tsp lemon extract.  I did not have self rising flour, but I put plugged it into the search line on allrecipes and the recipe popped up and I made my own!! Thanks for that.

I thought this was a nice variation of zucchini bread.  I added baking powder and salt to all-purpose flour in place of the self-rising (as per the substitutions chart her on AR), and since I only had one small lemon on hand that yielded a scant 1/2 tsp. of zest, I went ahead and added about 2 tsp. fresh lemon juice, and I omitted the nuts.  Make sure you squeeze as much liquid as possible out of the zucchini - the extra moisture will definitely affect the baking time.  I did, and still probably baked this for a total of 45 minutes before a toothpick came out clean when inserted in the center.  Since it's such a moist bread, let it cool before trying to slice.  Flavor was very good - I liked the lemon, but found I don't like raspberries in baked goods all that much - I found them a bit too tart.  Next time, I will use blueberries instead, but if you're a raspberry fan, please try this one!

My new favorite!!  Only had all-purpose flour, so added 1/2 t. salt and 1 1/2 t. baking powder.  Fabulous!

I did have self rising flour this time, which surprized me that the one recipe I would try would call for it. I made two loaves of this particular recipe, one with raspberries and one with blackberries. Only thing I did different was add a little vanilla, otherwise I followed the recipe exact. I think my zuke must have been wetter than last time because it did take another 20 minutes cooking time. Other than that, nice enough bread. Not outstanding, but a good bread.

I made this recipe in large muffin pans. (I use muffing pans for all my bread recipes because it works well for us as a family.) I also used regular flour but added the proper amounts of salt and baking powder to make the (self-rising flour).  I also used one cup of frozen whole raspberries.  We loved it.  It was not soggy at all.  I have been telling my neighbors all about this recipe and the blueberry recipe as I share my extra Zucchini with them.

Forgot I even posted this recipe and just found it again!  Read some reviews and read some things I'll try next time.  Don't know if the water content changes in different zucchini but I use 6-8" Black Beauty I raise. Not tried any other.

This recipe was ok.  I think I'd use only cinnamin next time and maybe a vanilla.  The nutmeg overpowered it.  I also used regular flour and added just under one teas. of baking soda and just under 1/2 teas. of salt. The raspberries were a nice touch in the bread.

My whole family really enjoyed this. I did need to modify the flour as we try to be gluten free. So instead of self rising flour, I used 3 Tablespoons ground flax, 1/2 cup all purpose GF flour and the rest Almond flour. 
I also used coconut sugar instead of regular sugar. coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. I hope to make this recipe again soon!

I'm not fond of nuts in bread so I made it without and it still turned out delicious. A little less dense than the typical zucchini bread but it's hard to fault it for that when it tastes so good.

Made it exactly as shown (except with AP flour and the addition of 1 1/2 tsp baking soda and 1/2 tsp of salt as explained by another reviewer). The batter was VERY thick, but I was able to still fold in the raspberries. I didn't need to cover it in the oven and it turned out delicious.

Used blueberries instead of raspberries, but the bread turned out amazing!
