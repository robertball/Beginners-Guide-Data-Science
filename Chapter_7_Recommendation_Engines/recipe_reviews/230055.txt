This was truly excellent.  I had to make changes due to what I had on hand... I used toasted pecans (because I always have them in the freezer, ready to roll), and I skipped the cheese.  Plus, I had Kirkland Precooked Bacon Crumbles in the fridge - so instead of cooking the bacon and using the grease, I put 1 T butter in the skillet, added the syrup, reduced it, and added the bacon to heat it up.  Bingo!  I didn't have time to go to the store etc. to do it as written, but I'm sure it's a winner either way.

I enjoyed this very much, only change I made was to omit the rosemary and use oregano.  (I HATE rosemary)  Surprisingly, I liked this better than my boyfriend who just wants me to stick to them sauted with bacon.

LOVE LOVE LOVE this salad.  I substituted walnuts for the hazelnuts because that is what I had on hand.  I also shredded the Brussels sprouts before roasting them.

Made a couple of changes.  Cubed Turkey instead of bacon and herbed goat cheese.  Was a wonderful blend of flavors dancing in my mouth.

I love Brussels sprouts and this is such a great way to prepare them! I used agave syrup instead of maple syrup and Parmesan instead of Pecorino-Romano cheese. Delicious!

Great recipe!!  Used a little less bacon than the recipe called for and toasted almonds instead of hazelnuts.  Also forgot to get rosemary, but that was okay with me because I don't like rosemary!

This was a hit, just delicious. I'd use a few less hazelnuts, and will make again for sure.

I thought the maple syrup would be a turnoff since we don't care for sweets but the combination really worked. A nice change of pace from our usually steamed sprouts. I used a mix of nuts: walnuts, filberts and pecans. Also, I had the leftovers cold, very good.

I made this as a side dish for Thanksgiving and Christmas (for different guests).  Only changes I made were to use pecans in place of hazelnuts and parm-reg for the cheese because I always have those on hand.  Served warm.  Very tasty.  Next time I'll cut the cranberries to 1/2-3/4  cup as they were excessive.

Amazing!!! I will 100% make this again. I changed rosemary to Oregano because I HATE rosemary, that was all I changed. Everybody loved it, even the ones who do not like Brussels Sprouts. People were hiding the bowl so they could have more! Thank you for sharing this recipe.!!!!

For us, just the Brussels sprouts and bacon would be enough. I followed the recipe except I used very little rosemary.  Will definitely make again but without the rosemary, nuts and cheese, and cranberries.

It was very good and fairly easy to do. I added grilled chicken and substituted pecans for the hazelnuts, but it turned out very tasty and a hit. My boyfriend and I both said we would eat it again.

the bacon burned after adding in the maple syrup and rosemary.  I used frozen sprouts which worked out fine and walnuts.  Will try it again, as I think if I got the sauce fixed it would be good.

My husband despises brussels sprouts but he will eat this over and over again.  The Pecorino-Romano cheese is an earthy cheese and really makes the dish.

Made this as a side for Thanksgiving and it came out really delicious. The only thing I did different was use fresh cranberries instead of dried. It looks beautiful, too!
