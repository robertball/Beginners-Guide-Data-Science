I followed the recipe to the T. next time I may adjust a few things to thicken up the sauce a bit. I questioned the amount of red pepper flakes but it was not to spicy at all. I would compare it to a mild/med salsa

Followed recipe fairly close. I used much less red pepper flakes, dry wine instead of grape juice and 4 cloves of garlic.  Turned out wonderful would make it again!

Delicious! I thought the sauce was a little thin at first but it worked great!

The family really liked this. I thought it was good but could have been a little saucier. I substituted sherry for the grape juice but followed the rest of the recipe to the tee. Iâ€™ll def make it again.
