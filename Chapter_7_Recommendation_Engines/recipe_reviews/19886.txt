This is a garlic lover's dream come true!
Chicken is very tender and quiet tasty. I took the suggestions of some of the reviewers by cutting back on the bread crumbs to 1/2cup. Used 3/4 cup of cheese and cut the salt to 1/4 tsp. Also used 2 eggs yolks and Italian style bread crumbs and 2lbs. of boneless, skinless chicken. We are a family of 4 and the chicken disappeared very quickly with requests to make it again soon!
Thank you Amy!

I agree this was very moist & not dried out. Make sure you do melt butter on bottom of glass dish, It will stick & burn! Other than that. It was gr8!

Great flavor! I used 3 large breasts, pounded just a bit, 3 yolks & let them marinade 7 hours in a ziploc. I only added about a tsp of garlic powder to my bread crumbs. I used panko crumbs (highly recommend!) & I added some italian seasonings in when the other seasonings. I did like others & just shook my chicken up in a big ziploc w/ the crumbs. I only added a couple of pinches of salt (parmesan can be salty enough). I didn't melt the butter in the pan, instead I  used a liberal amount of butter flavor Pam. The chicken was tender & juicy & loaded w/ garlicky flavor. I served it w/ Roasted Asparagus and Yellow Pepper Salad, fresh corn on the cob (nuked) & Pavlova for dessert.

This is awesome.  My whole family, husband and 2 boys (6 & 2), loved it.  I had to adapt a bit.  I only had chicken tenders, so I used 10.  I also used 2 egg yolks and 2 tsp. of minced garlic (equiv. to 4 garlic cloves).  I put yolks and garlic in large ziploc bag, then added chicken to bag.  Mixed it all up and put in fridge for about 7 hours.  Also, I only used half of the bread crumbs for the dry mix.  After I had all of the chicken coated, I sprinkled a little more parmesean cheese on top.  Since I used tenders, I cooked it for 20 minutes at 400.  Very juicy and wonderful.  I cannot wait to make this one again!

Oh Man, that was THE BEST chicken I've ever cooked!  Who ever gave this recipe a poor rating must have done something really wrong.  6 cloves of garlic was perfect, but one egg yolk wasn't enough for me.  I cooked 5 pieces of chicken so I mixed 3 egg yolks with 6 cloves and garlic and that was plenty to marinate the chicken.  There really wasn't much egg yolk mixture left after marinating overnight so I couldn't get the bread crumbs to stick that well but it was still fabulous!  I cut the bread crumbs and parmesan cheese in half and still had plenty.  I used the whole tablespoon of parsley but I changed up the rest of the spices a little.  I used one tablespoon total with a little of all these spices: garlic salt, garlic powder, garlic and herb seasoning, cayenne pepper, red pepper, and ground black pepper.  This tasted perfect to me.  I think that you can pretty much salt and season this dish according to your own particular taste.

Very simple and easy to make!  I ended up with a lot of extra crumb mixture though.  Next time I would cut them back to no more than 3/4 C each.  I topped the chicken with spaghetti and a red sauce to add to the flavoring.

If we could give this recipe six stars we would - Kids and Adults both love this tender chicken delite!  I like to cut the chicken breast into bite-sized pieces *before* marinating.  After a mere 4 hours in the egg/garlic mixture, the chicken is SO tender and the bite-sized pieces are perfect for my kids.  Also noteworthy is that the dish can be a bit salty if you add the recommended salt, use salted butter, and seasoned breadcrumbs.  We prefer it with no salt added, unsalted butter, and unseasoned bread crumbs.  Great with an Italian themed dinner (ie pasta with tomato sauce, salad, and garlic bread).

I thought this recipe was delicious.  We are big garlic fans and this really did hit the spot.  I did read the reviews before making and used italian bread crumbs and cut down the amount to a bit more than 1/4 cup, and used more than one egg yolk.  I did also have to cook a bit longer than the recipe called for, but still delicious. This is great because most if, not all, ingredients you will have on hand. Thank you for such a great recipe.

After so many glowing reviews for this recipe, I couldn't wait to make it. Boy, was I disappointed. Garlic was overpowering, needed more egg and much less bread crumb mixture. It tasted like shake-n-bake with cheese.

This chicken is fabulous!!!  I made it with the Calico Squash Casserole, corn bread muffins, and chocolate eclairs for desert (all recipes from allrecipes.com) and my husband LOVED it!  The chicken was really tender and very tasty!  I think it helped to marinate over night.  I cooked it for 20 minutes on one side, and then 15 minutes on the other and it was perfect.  Hope you enjoy!

Very good.  The longer you marinate, the better it tastes.  I use thin cut chicken breasts, and bake at 400 degrees in an 8x8 pan with 1/2 stick butter, for 5- 7 minutes each side.  It comes out very tender.  Great with pasta and red sauce.

If a recipe needs to be adjusted by every person who tries it - how does it rate 5 stars?  Way too much breading - what a waste.  Too greasy - why the need for so much butter - I had to pat off with paper towel.  It was okay - but family wasn't thrilled.

I have been meaning to try this recipe for almost a year. Tonight I finally did!  This chicken turned out very moist and ~garliky~ so those who are faint of heart might want to add the garlic to personal taste, however, everyone in my family is a garlic lover so we thought it was just right. 

I altered the recipe to serve 6. Thank goodness the computer will did this for me! I will agree with other reviewers that there might have been too much coating mixture, however, I do think it has a lot to do with the size of the chicken breasts. Mine were large so I didnt have much left over but the comments on the amount of mixture could simply be relative to the size of the chicken breasts. 

I used 3 egg yolks for 6 large breasts. There wasn't much left to pour over the chicken before baking but it seemed to turn out just fine. I might use an extra egg yolk next time unless I use smaller chicken breasts. 

I would recommend trying the recipe without adding the extra table salt. The parmesan cheese is salty enough by far. A few of my family members said the chicken reminded them of KFC fried chicken with garlic added. They said this was a "good thing". 

This is a great, easy recipe to do on the "go". Have your chicken marinating, make up your coating ahead of time and it will be in the oven before you put your purse down after work! :)

Very garlicky indeed and the egg yolk marinade does tenderize the chicken. Hubby and I really love garlic, so this fit the bill! Goes great with the roasted garlic mashed potatoes from this site. Make sure you brush your teeth real good after eating this. Thanks for sharing Amy.

This is a fantastic recipe!  I cannot fry chicken to save my life, and this was a perfect alternative.  I used chicken tenders, and chicken legs for hubby (which stayed in the oven longer).  Yum.  Oh by the way, those who thought it was "too garlicy" check out the name of the recipe....hmmmm.  Thanks Amy!!

I did take the suggestion of other reviewers and cut down the recipe in half and I still had some of the breading to throw away because I didn't need that much.  But even with 3 cloves of garlic this recipe turned out fabulous.  I am always looking for new chicken recipes and this one is great.

This is delicious.  Even my kids loved it. There were some minor changes.  I had to add 2 more egg yolks, one was definately not enough and the breading amounts could be cut in half, it was way too much.  Very tasy and easy recipe though.

Definitely a keeper. Used less butter, and less (Italian) breadcrumbs and grated parmesan per other reviews and still had a bit left over. Also used about 1" square cubes of cut chicken breast. I'd probably use a bit less pepper next time as well, was a tad too strong compared to the other flavors. Could probably also have doubled the eggyolk mixture for the 2lbs of chicken I used.
 
Thanks for a great recipe, Amy!

Yum, yum, yum! If you are a garlic lover, this recipe is for YOU. The chicken turned out so tender and juicy and was very flavorful. Couple of changes I made: (1)used 2 egg yolks for "marinade" (2)used half the amount of breading per previous reviews (3)used cracker crumbs in place of bread crumbs (4)decreased butter to 4 tablespoons and even that was more than enough to make these crisp & nicely browned (5)I did not pour the remaining egg yolk mixture over them before baking and don't think that step is really necessary. This recipe reminds me a lot of Famous Butter Chicken, also found on this site, but my husband thinks this is even better (and he went WILD for that one!). Thanks for a great simple recipe I'll certainly use again.

Sooo good. I left it in the fridge for about four hours and it was so tender and juicy. I cut the coating in half and still had plenty of it, so you might want to try it quarted. I too left out the garlic powder. I used the already minced garlic from the jar and used about 5t of it. I cooked chicken on one side for 20 min. and the other side 15 min. Perfect.y and  Try this recipe it is easy and so good, will make again and again.

After reading all the reviews, I was sure that my family would enjoy this. They like it but they wouldn't ask for it again. I thought it was bland. I left the chichen in for at least 7 hours. Maybe it should have been longer.

This is a very good recipe to keep on hand.  My husband absolutely LOVED it.  I let the chicken marinate overnight and did cut the amount of garlic in half.  However, I used the full amount of breading mixture so I would have some to use for other meals.  I was very pleased with this dish.  Definitely lived up to my expectations.  Thank you for sharing, Amy!

This recipe ROCKS! Make it tonight! I didn't change a thing, & it was perfect. I thought it called for a bit too much garlic between the cloves & the powder, but I gave Amy the benefit of the doubt & she was right on the nose. It wasn't over bearing at all. The chicken was tender, juicy & loaded with flavor... and it was SO easy to prepare. I served it with a side of pasta primavera, & it was a hit. Thanks so much, Amy. This one is definitely a keeper!

After reading everyones reviews and comments, I made some changes to this recipe when I tried it.

I used three egg yolks for the marinade and used twice the butter to make the chicken moister.  I put half the butter in the baking dish as called for in the recipe, and put shavings of the other half on top the chicken after I turned it.  It turned out perfectly moist and tender!

I also cut the breading recipe in half, and had plenty.  I used Italian flavored breadcrumbs.

I did not cut the garlic down, as many people suggested, as my husband and I are BIG garlic lovers.  We go though 3 to 4 whole bulbs a week!  But even for garlic lovers like ourselves, this was just too much garlic.  I'm going to leave the garlic powder out of the breading next time, and see how it tastes.

I still gave this recipe the highest rating, because I think it is a wonderful recipe overall, and I think most people will love this recipe once they adust the amount of garlic to their own personal taste.

We have all had a thousand different chicken recipes.  This one has my vote for the best ever.
I used Ritz cracker crumbs instead of bread crumbs, and lots of them.

We had this last night for dinner and my family loved it, it has a very garlicy flavor that we adored. I used 3 egg yolks and 4 cloves of garlic and for the bread crumbs "Progresso Italian" and added parsley, a touch of garlic powder and pepper. Cooked it for 25 minutes on each side. Delicious, thank you.

Absolutely yummy! First and second time I made this, I didn't have time to marinate it but it still turned out absolutely great.  I think the third time, I will have patience and marinate it as directed.  Both times I cooked it 20 minutes on one side and 15 minutes on the other - perfect!  Bread crumbs - as suggested in a lot of reviews below, were way too much, so I cut this in half and still had left overs - the left overs I just sprinkle all over the top and ended up with crunchy yummy breadcrumbs.  Perfect served with white rice.

Very tasty chicken!  I used 2 egg yolks instead of one, and cut the dry ingredients for the breading in half.  I will definitely make this one again as per my husbands request :)

What a great recipe!  I made it on the weekend for a dinner party and it was perfect - used 6 chicken breasts, 2 egg yolks, and 4 garlic cloves.  I also took the advice of other reviewers and cut back 1/3 on the breading mixture (used freshly grated parmesan of course) and still had leftovers.  Only used 1/4 teaspoon of salt, and when baking 2 Tablespoons butter and 2 Tablespoons Olive oil.  Sprinkled extra breading when turning the chicken.  Everyone LOVED it.  I will definitely make this one of my tried and true recipes.  Thanks to Amy! (and to everyone else for their suggestions!)

First off... I have to agree with the other reviewers. AMAZING. I will definitely be making this one again.  Most of the reviews said that 1 egg yolk wasn't enough for four breasts, and I'd probably agree. But since I was making it for just my husband and I, I halved the rest of the recipe and the one egg was plenty.

Ok I wanted to give this a 4.5 stars but it is not an option. This is a very good recipe and I have added it to my recipe box It didn't rate a 5 for me due to bad ingredient portions. I'm glad I read several reviews before I tried it myself. Like others I cut the coating in half and it work out great and I also used 3 egg. I took advice from a reviewer and placed the breading in a glad bag and used the shake n bake method which worked out great. I lined the baking pan with Reynolds Non-Stick Aluminum Foil which made for easy clean up and the butter did not burn like others had stated. I also added dried onion flakes to the coating. I did not have any fresh garlic so I used 1/4 cup of ground garlic to my egg mixture and it was just the right amount for a true garlic lover,which we are. The direction don't state whether to bake covered or uncovered but common sense will tell you to leave uncovered so it can brown.

Honestly I thought this was going to be a very 'shake and bake'ish' type of chicken but I was very pleasantly surprised!! The breading was nice and crispy and the chicken was juicy.  I only added 3/4 cup bread crumbs and 3/4 parmesan.  Also after I coated the chicken the first time I went back and redredged the chicken in the egg mix then into the bread crumbs again.  I choarsly chopped my garlic for a bigger garlic flavor. I found that after 40 minutes my chicken wasn't fully cooked yet.  This recipe was so easy and the end results were delicious!  Thank you Amy!!

This recipe is wonderful. I used boneless chicken tenders because they cook faster. I toasted a french bread and grated it for the bread crumbs, combined them in a zip lock with the other tasty ingredients. I grated the parmesan cheese too. The whole family loved it! When all the chicken was gone I dipped a piece of bread in the left overs on the bottom of the pan, amazing flavor.I understand why this recipe is in the hall of fame, thanks for posting it.

Absolutely delicious.  There is way too much bread crumb mixture.  Either make half, or save half for the next time!  The chicken has so much flavor and comes out soooo moist.  The next time I make it, I'm going to serve it on top of angel hair pasta with marinara sauce, french bread and a tossed salad.

Great Recipe and so easy.  Have already made several times.  You do need to use more eggs for marinating.  I usually use 3-4 eggs and serve the chicken with Honey Mustard Drizzle sauce found on this site - Delicious

This Garlic Egg Chicken barely tasted like chicken and just tasted like garlic. Thankfully, I am a garlic lover through and through.

My boyfriend LOVED this recipe!  To the advice of fellow reviewers, I marinated my 4 breasts in a ziploc bag with 3 egg yolks.  I also cut the breading in half and did the shake and bake thing in a ziploc bag as well.  Using only 5 Tbs of butter was perfect but cooking 20 minutes a side wasn't enough - it took me more about 25-27 minutes or so.  But OMG the chicken came out perfect - crispy on the outside but MOIST on the inside!!!  I served it like chicken parmesan, with a side of pasta and marinara sauce all over everything.    Will make it again - this time with a slice of provalone cheese on the chicken!

I made this chicken for dinner last night.  I started marinating the chicken the night before.  I used 3 whole eggs and a heaping spoonful of the minced garlic from the jar.  I omitted the salt, used Italian style bread crumbs and some parmesan cheese to coat.  It turned out AWESOME.  By boyfriend loved it!  Will definitely make again.  Thank you Amy!!

HELLO GARLIC!! We liked this - was moist and garlicky and had a nice coating.  Like others I had to use 2 yolks, will cut back on the amt of crumbs and cheese next time.  A suggestion - when you are making the marinade the night before - you can also put together the crumb mixture in a plastic bag.  Then the next day all you have to do is melt the butter (I lined a baking pan with foil first - less clean up), shake up the chicken and put it in the oven.  Using lg. boneless, chicken breasts only cooked it for 20 min. one side, 15 min. the other.  While that was baking I prepared a Lipton's chicken flavored pasta dish, micro waved corn on the cob and served chilled canned cranberries.  Everything was done from beginning to end in 35 min.  As I said, we liked the recipe as is but after you try it once - you can adjust the garlic to your taste. (Oh, I did add some red pepper - not needed - but I like heat!). Try it!  - Thanks Amy.

I marinated the chicken overnight, and the chicken was saturated with a great garlic flavor.  The coating was also fantastic, nice and salty.

If you are going to make this recipe, you MUST do two things:

1)Cut the ingredients for the bread coating by half.  There is exactly twice as much as needed in this recipe.  I put the left-over mixture in a zip-lock bag, and put it in the freezer for the next time I make this (soon, I'm sure).

2)Use an extra egg yolk, since one is not enough.

If you like garlic, this is the recipe you've been waiting for.

I have to say that this is a fabulous recipe, even though mine did not come out perfect!  The garlic and egg marinade was incredible.  I took the advice of many other reviewers and added only about a teaspoon of garlic to the breadcrumb mixture along with a 1/4 lid of cayenne. Once I made up the marinade and could tell how pungent it was I also put the chicken in a ziplock bag to marinate to save my fridge from remembering this meal for days to come. Everyone seemed to be right about addition of egg yolk and cutting the breadcrumb coating in half! There was way more than needed.
It did not turn out exactly perfect but I know that this was due to my having used split breasts (bone in)because I attempted to debone one breast and tore it up so badly that I decided to try the others just as they were.  The one filet was perfect, the rest not quite.  I intend to work out the kinks and will definitely be making this again (with breast fillets, of course) and I will be using this egg based marinade in many other ways.  Great work, Amy!!

This one is my first allrecipes disapointment.  I was really excited about making this one since we are garlic lovers at my house and the fact that this one was so highly rated!  I can usually tell by reading the ingredients if I need to tweek something more to my liking or not, but given the reviews and the fact that the only application that I have ever used garlic on chicken is when I make Chinese dishes, I decided not to do that.  Chicken by nature is a delicate meat and tends to take on any flavors it is subjected to.  If all you want to taste is garlic, this one is for you!  The garlic simply overpowered the meat!  I was disappointed that this one never got cripsy for me at all as well.  We had leftovers (in my house that is an indication the recipe wasn't a hit!) so I took them for a green salad we had at work.  The chicken was even more pungent the next day!  With some tweeking on my part and maybe a change in the breading, I can probably get this the way I want, but I will never put that much garlic in it again.  As much as I love garlic, I still want to be able to taste the chicken.  Thanks for the chance though Amy:)

I thought this was quite tasty; my husband said it was just "okay."  I did cut the amount of butter but it was still greasy.  I think, if I make it again, I'll try the low-fat trick of spraying the coated chicken with non-fat cooking spray before baking.  That trick helps breaded chicken crisp up in the oven without adding a lot of extra calories.

Another Allrecipes winner! I tweaked the recipe a little.. I just cannot help myself. :) I used olive oil instead of butter in the baking dish.. and used a lot less, used even more garlic, reduced parmesan cheese in coating by a lot and used an egg beater instead of egg yolk. It was terrific. I had it the first evening hot and the second night cold.. yum! The garlic really gets a nice mellow roasted flavor, so don't be afraid of adding a lot.

I usually love ALL the recipes that are rated with five stars but OH MY GOD this was absolutely awful.  It had so much garlic that truely the garlic was all that could be tasted. There was not enough liquid in this dish...just a whole bunch of pepper, garlic and even more garlic powder.  My husband and I love garlic but....I felt like I was warding off vampires in my kitchen.

this was a little TOO garlicky for our tastes - i would omit the garlic powder or only use a dash.  i used 1/2 tbsp. and it was a bit overwhelming.  i also cooked the chicken for 25 minutes on each side and it came out dry.  next time i'll cook for only 15-20 minutes, as the recipe says.  in all, not bad.

This is one of the best chicken recipes I've ever cooked.  The chicken was very flavorful and extremely moist.  If you're looking for a light chicken recipe this definitely isn't the recipe for you, but I have no complaints at all about how the chicken was done.  I had quite a bit of the bread crumb mixture left over so I just save it and put it in the refrigerator for the next time I cook this recipe.  I have nothing but great things to say about this recipe.

This was fabulous.  I love cooking with chicken and wanted a recipe that I could serve the fresh, boneless, skinless chicken breast alone.  Usually, I would put the chicken into dishes and did not have a main dish recipe.  I have to say that it turned out great.  I baked the chicken for 60 mins total, 30 on each side, uncovered since I had used nice sized chicken breasts.  I would even but imported grated parmesan for the breading since it would have come through a little stronger, but this is not chicken parmesan by far!  This is a garlic lovers dream, although I know I was reeking of garlic for 2 days afterwards.  The garlic smelled wonderful while baking and it tasted so good.  My husband loved it and not only because I was feeding him!  We are both food lovers and we really think about the dinners we prepare at our home.  We had a glass of cabernet with this meal because it really was a treat.  I would prepare this for company and can't wait to show it off to my Mom and sister.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I chose this recipe because of my love for garlic and the good reviews. I was very disappointed. It was very tender, however the garlic was overpowering. I would definitely cut the amount of garlic in half.

We absolutely loved this dish. I served it with Mushroom Rice (from this site) and sauteed spinach. I did use 2 egg yolks and boneless, skinless chicken filets. I only needed half the amount of bread crumbs since mine were super fine (like sand). The amount of bread crumbs needed depends on the coarseness of the bread crumbs and the size of the chicken breasts used. If you use panko crumbs, you may need a full cup. I don't think it warrants "knocking down" stars because there were too many bread crumbs. 

Note: Avoid the temptation of "double dipping" the chicken in the bread crumbs. I did just that on 2 of my 5 breasts and they did not "crisp up" in the oven. Although still delicious, the coating was soft.

We thoroughly enjoyed this and it was a nice alternative to anything fried. It was close to the flavor of chicken Milanese without the extra calories.

Good! I liked it and I'll definitely make it again, but it wasn't anything that really wowed me.  I love garlic, so I liked the garliciness.  Definitely too much butter though.  I only used 4 tablespoons and thought 2, or just enough to coat the bottom of a smaller baking dish would have been perfect.

I can't say enough good things about this chicken.  If you like garlic, it's the recipe for you.  It tastes great served with a milk gravy like chicken fried steak.

I will always "marinade" my chicken in egg yolks from now on!! These were the most tender chix tenderloins I have ever made! I can't wait to try fried chicken in the egg yolks. All 3 of my kids gobbled it up and the garlic level was perfect! Just use common sense when measuring the bread crumbs. Thanks!!!

So far this is my FAV recipes from this site. I dont think anything can top this:) I make this chicken once a week and everytime it turns out perfect. I wish I could give it 10 stars!!! I add some almonds or pecans to the bread mixture if I have that on hand but other than that I dont change anything. The moistest chicken ever. Thanks soo much!

I am not the biggest chicken breast fan but this recipe makes them taste awesome! Just as good when marinated 3 hours as it was overnight.  Use fresh garlic that you cut up yourself...so much better than the prechopped stuff in a jar.  
I tried it with chicken thighs...no good at all...has to be chicken breasts! I dont find many true 5 star recipes, but this one earned it as it actually made chicken breast moist and tasty!
By the way, coating measurements are far too much for 4 breasts- can use 1/4-1/3 amount.  1 yolk to 4 breasts is adequate.

I make this recipe all the time and I always get compliments.  

I have noticed that I almost always need only half the amount of breading and twice the yolk  the recipe calls for.    Putting the garlic and egg yolk in a plastic bag in the fridge keeps it in the marinade better than putting it in a glass dish.

We love garlic, so the recipe is great as-is, but if you're not a huge fan, cut the amount in half.  I would try the recipe even if you don't love garlic- the egg yolk marinade makes the most tender chicken ever.

WOW!  I thought this sounded really gross but I had everything on hand and hubby loves garlic so I went for it.  I am SOOOO glad I did.  This is great!  My picky 4 & 5 year olds ate it up.  I used 3 medium egg yolks instead of 1.  The chicken was crispy and very tender.  I used the whole amount of breadcrumbs and parmesean and only had about 1/4 cup left so I just sprinkled that over the top of the chicken and it turned out great.  I used large chicken breasts though so that may be why I didn't have much left over.

This is a nice recipe to try if you're looking for something different.  There is no need for that amount of butter for the bottom of the baking pan..you can cut that amount in half.

Wow!  This will be the ONLY breaded chicken oven recipe that I will use from now on.  Thank you so much Amy for submitting and to some great suggestions by other reviewers.  I took the advice of spraying the chicken with a non-stick spray versus the butter.  The chicken breasts that I used were HUGE so the breading amount was perfect.  As other reviewers mentioned, I could see that the coating amount would be way too much if using smaller cuts of chicken.  I also used 3 egg yolks (doubled the garlic) because, again, the cuts were so large.  Due to the fact that I was out of Parmasean cheese, I used Pecorino Romano.  Another great tip offered was the use of a ziplog bag not only to save the frig from smelling like a garlic factory, but also the ease.  I even mixed the breading mixture in a separate bag --- shake 'n bake style!  Awesome!

My husband thought this was "very good".  Hence, 4 stars - I would have given 3.  After reading the other reviews, I too added additional spices.  I think it would have been entirely bland without the extra zing.

With my first bite I thought I had died and gone to heaven!!!  This is the best recipe on this site I have tried so far!  The flavor was exquisite and the chicken so tender!

I altered the recipe pursuant to other reviewers by cutting the dried ingredients in half, which was just about perfect for me.  Also, I added Italian herbs and seasoned salt to the egg/garlic marinade and left the salt out of the crumb mixture.  I found two egg yolks not enough.  I will use three next time.

I can't wait to make again with chicken as well as turkey cutlets or pork chops!

Who would have thought that something so simple could be so divine?

Thank you, Amy!

This was a great recipe--the chicken was so moist, full of flavor, and golden brown.  My only recommendation would be to maybe line the pan with foil so you don't get such a stuck on mess when you're through eating.

This was ok.  The coating on mine didn't harden, and it fell off the chicken while we were eating it.  I think there was too much butter in the pan.  As for flavor and tenderness, they were both great.  But it didn't "knock my socks off".

After reading all of the positive reviews this dish received, I could not wait to try it. Unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed. The chicken was the most tender I have ever tasted but the flavor was lacking. It was very bland.I will try this again (after all 300+ positive reviews show I must have done something wrong) but, in the words of Emeril, I will spice things up a bit!

The chicken turned out very moist and juicy.  Next time I will slice and stuff the chicken with garlic to give it more flavor inside.  The coating was very flavorful, but the inside of the chicken lacked the garlic punch I was hoping for.  I will be making this recipe again!

This was a really good chicken recipe.  I used 1/2 cup of crubs and cheese and still had way too much.  I piled it on top of the chicken to use it up and it tasted great.  The was a hint of garlic flavor on the outside of the chicken, but no garlic flavor inside.  It was juicy and enjoyed by all.

We enjoyed this pretty well. I agree with all those people who say to half the crumb mixture. There will still be plenty. I also omitted the garlic powder because it is plenty garlicy without it.

Absolutely, delicious!
I was only able to marinade the chicken for 2 hours prior to cooking, nevertheless, it was loved by all.  I used 4 yolks (6 servings) and I cut the breadcrumbs and parmesan cheese in half so as to not have any waste.
I will most certainly make this again, and again, and again...

The breading can definitely be halved with plenty left over, and I used three egg yolks in order to have enough to coat chicken - but other than that minor tweak, this recipe is fantastic!  The chicken is really tender, and the breading is so flavorful.  I used boneless chicken tenders for this and it was sooo yummy.

I have never tried to cook anything harder than scrambled eggs before and this still turned out great!  My boyfriend and friends were surprised I had cooked something so tasty.  As everyone else said, I would cut the bread/cheese mixture at least in half, maybe more.  I also think I used too much butter, b/c I fit the 4 halves in an 8x8 baking dish, and it could have been a bit crispier.  Overall, great recipe!  It made me want to keep up with this cooking thing.  Thanks Amy!

My husband and I love garlic.  This recipe is a keeper.  I found that if I use just half of the dry ingredients I still have plenty.

My family and I really enjoyed this recipe.  I did, however cut the garlic in half after reading many reviews, and it still had lots of garlic flavor.  My son has already requested this for his birthday meal!!

I think this may be the best chicken I've ever had!  It was easy to prepare, and I received rave reviews from my family during dinner.  I used 3 egg yolks and 2 teaspoons bottled minced garlic (equal to about 4 cloves.)  I didn't marinate it for the full 4 hours, but it was still the tastiest, most tender chicken!!  I, too, had way too much crumb mixture (I used half plain bread crumbs and half italian seasoned);  I would also recommend cutting that mixture in half.  Regardless, this was awesome!!  Thank you Amy!

Prep time a little longer than expected.  I served it with mashed potatoes, baked apples and bread and was one of the best meals I have had or made.  Fantastic taste and easy to make overall.

Even if you don't have time to marinate the chicken, no problem. My daughter and I have been making Amy's Garlic Chicken recipe for years. No need to change a thing as it always turns out great. Company and kids of all ages love it too.

Fabulous. I marinated it overnight. Copied everything to a T except I use panko breadcrumbs instead of regular. Easy to make and delicious quick meal.

Tried this tonite,  the only difference was I used boneless breasts and used eggbeaters instead of eggs,, which I think helped the coating stick much better to the cutlets,, very tasty,, not overpowering garlic flavor, just right,, daughter gave it four stars and boyfriend gave it five,, I will average it to four and a half :)    I did omit the salt being the cheese is salty and it was just right
Plus I didn't have to stand over it and watch it,, I turned it over halfway thru then broiled it for about three minutes just to crisp up the breading,, definitely a keeper,, thanks for sharing

Found this recipe 6 years ago and we make it almost weekly! I don't measure, however I use more garlic, 1 or 2 whole egg (hate to waste and 1 yolk, rarely have time to marinate and it's always a success.  My 12 year olds favorite meal since she was 6.  I now make it with rice, easy easy easy and the kids the love the combo and so do I.  You must try this.

Followed as directed except "marinated" in egg and garlic a bit more than 24 hours and cut back a bit on the black pepper (personal preference).  I thought the chicken was nicely flavored and although some recipes the chicken itself is only slightly flavored, this one got really soaked in, which was nice, as we love garlic.  Cooked about 15 min on each side.  Not sure what purpose it serves to pour about 2 Tablespoons of egg over the chicken in the pan, but did it anyway.  That egg ended up getting almost burnt on the bottom of the pan.  Everyone here ate all their chicken including me, which is not the norm around here. Served with pasta nuggets in red sauce which went very well.

This was very garlicy (as expected), but if I made this for company I would decrease it just a little bit.  Also, I did not use all the breadcrumbs, I would probably make about 1/2 to 3/4 the amount next time.

This chicken is very tender and quiet tasty. I took the suggestions of some of the reviewers by cutting back on the bread crumbs to 1/2 cup and used panko crumbs. Used 3/4 cup of cheese and omitted the salt. Delicious!

I can't imagine how intense the garlic flavor is if you follow the recipe exactly. We used 4 cloves and marinated for 4 hours and it was PLENTY garlic tasting, I wouldn't do it any longer in our house. The coating was very tasting though and it was moist. Wasn't my favorite but my husband liked it.

Made this with chicken tenders since that's what I had on hand.  Kids (age 4 and 6) loved it and asked when I can make it again.  I did make a few subs to the breading, to accommodate my gluten-free/dairy-free hubby - crushed up rice chex and no cheese.  Will definitely do this one again!

Good flavor, but salty. Would omit the salt next time. Made half the crumb mixture, which was perfect. Used panko crumbs instead of bread crumbs, but it did not come out crispy at all, so I'm not sure what I did wrong...

Excellent recipe!!....just a reminder to all... using a digital thermometer and checking the thickest part of the meat, make sure your chickens internal temperature reaches 165 degrees. This is to avoid any chance of an illness. Keep on Cookin'.

One of the BEST dishes I've ever made! The flavor is just perfect. I used an extra egg and only half the butter. I also marinated the chicken in the garlic egg over night and then left it to marinade for about 2 hrs after rolling in bread crumb and parmesan mix. You only need to make half the batch of mix. Highly recommend!

Good garlic flavor. Chicken was moist. Kinda greasy. If I make this again will definitely use 2 egg yolks and use less butter. And, followed other reviewers and made less bread mixture. Overall, good recipe to mix up my boring chicken repertoire.

I submitted two photos so I think it's safe to say I LOVED this dish. Had a nice thick breast and I sliced it in the middle to "stuff" some salt pepper and Ms. Dash Italian Medley so it would be seaoned thoughout, which is very important. The recipe did not call for a drizzle of olive oil prior to baking but I felt it necessary and since I'm a new Olive oil fan. Juicy flawless tasty, the BOMB!!!

Chicken had a good flavor, I just didn't care for the fact that it swam in a bath of melted butter.

I've made this a few times...  dug out the recipe today to make it again, and realized I haven't rated it.  The first time I made it, used a whole egg, and it wasn't the same as when I used just yolks.  I agree with many others, that there is just too much coating, so I cut that in half and then make a touch more if I need it so I don't waste so much.  I really enjoy the flavor of this chicken, and it cooks up moist and tender.  The garlic is not overpowering, but you can definitely taste it.  I do use Italian bread crumbs, since that's all I ever have.

I loved this! So did my husband (he ate 2 pieces at dinner and a few hours later he ate a 3rd!) Very flavorful and juicy.  There were a lot of extra bread crumbs, so I may cut those ingredients by 1/3 next time I make this. Great recipe!

Excellent recipe, Amy. This chicken was so moist. I marinated it overnight. As other reviewers noted, you will probably end up with too much of the bread crumb mixture so you might want to reduce to half. This chicken is very versatile and could be served with many different sides.

Ommited the garlic cloves, cut back on the butter and used Italian Seasoned Bread Crumbs.  Very tasty over spaghetti with sauce drizzled over it.

very good flavor. like other reviews, i thought the chicken was going to be soggy sitting in 6tbsp butter, but surprisingly wasnt! outside was crispy and inside was very moist. i poured my extra bread crumb mixture over the chicken prior to flipping and after i flipped them. i also used 3 eggs and put two spoonfuls of the egg mixture over the chicken prior to putting in the oven. OUTSTANDING! had no left overs :)

My husband and I thought this was great and it was really simple!  I cut the recipe in half except for the egg yolk.  I would be tempted to use one yolk per breast the next time, since I didn't have any left after coating the chicken.  Also, I didn't have time to marinate, but it didn't seem to hurt anything.

This was absolutely delicious!  At first bite, my 5 year old daughter said "Wow, this is really good!".  I only had time to marinate the chicken breasts in the egg and garlic mixture for about an hour and a half, but it was still delicious.  I used 1 whole egg, not just the yolk.  Next time I will use 2 or 3 eggs.  I also used pre-chopped garlic from a jar, but next time will use fresh.  I also took the advice of others and cut the breading in half, and it was the perfect amount to cover 3 HUGE chicken breasts.  I was skeptical about the melting butter in the bottom of the dish, I thought the breading would be soggy, but it wasn't.  I cooked the breasts for 30 minutes on each side, but they were very large.  I will definitely be making this on a regular basis!!

Not that this needs another review, but wow - this was really good. The whole family loved it. Followed other reviewers' advice about cutting back the breading amounts by half and that was just right for 4 breasts. It was easy enough for my 13 y.o. to make. She loved getting the raves from her brothers and dad for a great meal. Thanks!

The chicken was delicious and very tender. I've never used eggs as a marinade before and I found that it worked really well to inject the flavor of the garlic all of the way into the chicken. It did have a very strong taste of garlic but I am definately a garlic lover and that is what I wanted when I tried this recipe. I had to use three eggs because one would not coat the chicken enough and there was way too much breading left over even though I cut those measurements in half and I hate to waste because our family is on a budjet. I did not use the butter because the last time I did that for a different recipe the breading would not stick to the chicken at all and I used matzoh meal instead of bread crumbs just because that's what I had on hand. It was a little too salty so next time I will probably omit that and add a pinch more pepper. All and all I enjoyed it.

Yumm, garlic attack!! My first time making crumbed chicken and we loved it! I would have given it 5 stars if some of the crumbing hadn't stuck to the bottom of the baking tray. We were also expecting a stronger parmesan flavour - as I've said we couldn't taste much else besides the garlic. But it was still great and well worth the effort.

This is a really good and savory recipe.  I make it all the the time.  I never marinate more than 20 minutes because I usually forget it requires it but it still works great.  Like all good chicken dishes, I pound the chicken into 1/2 inches which makes it tender enough to cut with a spoon.  Garlic lovers will love this, its really well liked by everyone I have served it to.

mine was a little tough.  i don't think you need to cook boneless breasts for 40 min at 400.  and i didn't add any garlic powder, believing the 6 cloves it marinated in to be enough.  all in all, the flavor was good.

Wow, great flavor.  I added a tbsp Less of butter and added a few more cloves of garlic, as I can't get enough of the stuff.  Yet, the chicken wasn't too garlicy, it just had a great taste and juicy!

These were ok, but I marinated the chicken for a day and a night, and I didn't find them all that great.  I used less garlic, and I had to use 3 egg yolks.  I also had a ton of bread curumb mixture left over.

Great chicken dish! My only complaint is that it makes enough dry ingredients for at least eight breasts, so I wasted a lot of expensive ingredients. I will half the recipe in the future, or cook a double batch and freeze some.

This is one of the BEST chicken dishes I have ever had!!  The garlic was perfect although I ended up with too much of the breading mix.  I would also use another egg yolk to have more of the yummy sauce! Absolutely delicious!  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!!

This was GREAT!  I made the recipe using 6 chicken breast halves, and found that one egg yolk wasn't enough, so I used 2 whole eggs for the marinade.  I agree that there is a boatload of crumb mixture.  I refrigerated what was left for the next time I make this.  It's easy, and delicious!  We LOVE garlic and we LOVE easy, so it's perfect for my family.  Serve it with rice and salad or vegetable, and it's the perfect meal!

EXCELLENT OVEN chicken.  I love this!  I didn't expect much, just becauce I haven't found many good chicken recipes in the oven, but this is great.  Does make to much coating.  Scale that down some.  Garlicy good!

This is close to five star.  I would change 1 egg yolk to four, and cut the breading ingredients by 50%.  Great dish!

This was a great chicken dish.  I used the garic press and also used crushed vegetable thin crackers as opposed to bread crumbs.  The flavor was great and had just enough garlic.  I will definately make this again!  :)

Very tasty!  I marinated mine overnight and thought the garlic flavor was wonderful. I also threw in some chicken legs for my kids (13 & 4) thinking they'd really like that, but they did not.  I don't know if the garlic flavor was too strong or if it's just better w/ the boneless breast. It's something I'd enjoy having again.

The first time I made this it didn't turn out quite as brown or as crisp as I had expected. (Small chicken breasts meant that they cooked before they could brown.) But the flavour was good and I wanted to fiddle with it a bit, because we did like it. The next time I made it I followed the recipe up until the cooking part. I browned the chicken in an ovenproof frying pan and then put pan and all into a 400 oven and cooked it for about 10 minutes. I sprinkled a little lemon juice over the chicken, to cut the fat a bit, and WOW!!!! Easy, fast and above all, very tasty. This is a definite keeper!

This was great. Definitely use more then 1 egg yolk, I used 3 for 4 chicken breasts. These baked up nice and crispy. Although I think next time I will just use some cooking spray instead of butter in the pan as it got pretty burned while cooking in the oven.

This recipe was delicious and easy to make. I don't like to waste spices and this recipe calls for way too much quantity wise. When making the bread crumb mixture I recommend using 1/4 of what the recipe calls for. Otherwise, you'll be throwing away alot of spices.

Not half bad, but I don't understand the craziness over this recipe. The beauty is its simplicity. If you have Italian seasoned breadcrumbs, you don't even have to mess with the parmesan or parsley. I'll make it again because I always have the ingredients on hand.

DOUBLED-- I doubled this recipe (see my other reviews for other recipies doubled)  Very moist.  I marinated over nite in the tupperware marinater, but i would next time just marinate in a zip lock bag because the garlic would adhere to the chicken and not the tupperware indentations.  I also increased the yolks to 4 and used italian spice instead of adding them separately.  No salt and I didn't double the cheese because of kids...

My family really enjoyed this very moist and tender chicken.  Used only 3 cloves of garlic but will probably use more next time to pump up the garlic flavor a bit.  Will use a a seasoning blend as we found the chicken to be a bit bland for our tastes.  Used 3 egg yokes for 5 breasts and that seemed to work out very nice.  Per the advice of other reviewers we cut down on the coating amounts.  Overall, this is a terrific recipe and we will be making this again!

Amazing, simply amazing.  My girlfriend and I make this dish whenever we can.  If you love garlic then you will love this recipe.  However you may wanna use a little use and half the amount of bread crumbs.  Happy eating!

An extra yolk and about a third less of the breading mix (there was quite a bit of extra)would be good. This was very flavorful, great garlic flavor.

Our family loved it.  My three year old enjoyed it also.  I personally would not use as much butter in the bottom of the pan as the crust did not turn out crispy at all.  When I reheated the next night for left overs and instead sprayed the dish with non stick spray, it came out much crispier.  I too halved the breading and still had plenty left over.  Strong garlic and cheese taste so to those who opt for a more subtle taste, just cut the amounts as this is still a worthy recipe to have!  I have also tried this with fish and it was great.

The chicken came out juicy and good flavor.  I thought that the inside would taste garlicky but did not so I agree with another person's review and will stuff it with garlic and maybe a couple peppercorns.  Went great with noodles and butter.

SCRUMPTIOUS!   If you measure the crumbs (we used Mrs. Cubbison's Herb Stuffing cubes) before crushing, the measurement for it makes sense.  We did not add salt and my husband put a bit too much pepper which gave it a bit more of a kick than we wanted.  We used chicken tenders (frozen) and two yolks and it came out wonderful.  My husband thought it was good but I REALLY liked this recipe.  It's coarsely crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  Looked good too.  Served with broccoli and rolls.  I recommend using fresh parmesan.

This chicken is wonderful.  I goofed and used the whole egg (actually two)and it came out fine.  I used seasoned bread crumbs and freshly grated parmesan cheese.  After coating the chicken and then poring the remaining egg mixture over it I also topped it with the remaining crumb mixture.  Both my guy and I took a left over piece of chicken to work the next day and everyone wanted to try it.  Sorry, too good to share!

As incredible as everyone said.  Will def. make this one again.  I took a lot of the tips other people made - much less breadcrumbs and I used powdered parmesean cheese, as it was what I had, and I needed much less of that too.  You really do need two egg yolks though.  But it was so juicy and tasty.

Great way to prepare chicken and the flavor is outstanding!  Guests raved and family asked me to fix it again.  Thought there might be too much garlic in the recipe, but it gave it just enough flavor.  Only complaint was that I had way too much of the crumb mixture leftover.  I will cut it in half next time.  Oterwise, an incredible recipe.  Thanks Amy.

Very good, the meat came out very tender. I think the breadcrumb mix was too much - I had to throw out most of it. Maybe just use half?

This was a great recipe.  It was perfect...and all of the garlic taste was great.  I didn't even leave it soaking for 4 hours...it might have been in the garlic/egg mixture for ten minutes and it still turned out great.  This recipe was quick and easy.

I like garlic, but this was borderline too much.  My chicken sat in the marinade over 24 hours.  I may cut that time in 1/2 the next time I prepare this.

Awesome recipe. My daughter is a bit of a picky eater, and she loved this. I used chicken tenders and cut the cooking time in half. I also used Pam cooking spray instead of the butter for a lower fat alternative.

Excellent dish - I will make this many more times before I die.  Thank you very much - this was tasty cooked strictly by the directions and (IMHO) makes a great base for variations (like below).  I really like the ease with which this goes together, and the process can be used with a variety of meats/sauces/breadings. - - - Some sauteed onions made a nice topping for this, with a tsp or two of chipolte & cayenne pepper added to the breading gave it a nice spicy heat.

Too bad I couldn't give this 6 stars ;)

This was good. Definately not too "garlicy". I used 2 egg yolks for 2 chicken breasts. It was a nice change.

It was good, but to me it just seemed like glorified Shake n Bake. I guess I was expecting something more. Also, I had a ton of dry coating mix left over when finished.

My hubby hates garlic, and loved this dish! I used large chicken breasts and halved the bread crumb mixture. Ended up throwing out only 1 Tbs. I beat the egg white until foamy, before marinating, and found the amount to be perfect.

A great chicken change.  Would cut the amount of bread crumbs and parmesan cheese in 1/2 to avoid waste.  Yummy.

My husband just kept saying, "Wow!" and wants to eat the leftovers again tonight. The meat was very tender.  I personally thought it was very good and presentation was lovely - but I was a little put off by the egg if you can believe it!  I am pregnant so maybe that's why!

this was a great tasting chicken dish. i ended up adding an additional egg yolk to the marinating. i reduced the bread crumbs to about 3/4 cup -- but, still ended up with leftovers -- so i put about 1/2 of those leftovers on top of all the chicken in the casserole. it resulted in a little extra crunch in the dish. i like this recipe because it's really easy to put together and extremely quick!!

Aside from the overload of garlic, this recipe was bland and boring.  The taste was okay, but even as a garlic lover, I was overpowered by the garlic.  Doubt that I'll do this one again.

This was a great way to make chicken!!  Easy and delicious and the leftovers were SO good on salad.  Next time I will only make have the amount of the bread crumb mixture.  It was not needed.  Half would be plenty to coat the chicken.  I will definitely make this again!!!

This chicken was very good!!  There were way to many dry ingredients though, I ended up throwing a bunch away after coating chicken.  Next time I will cut everything in half and cut the salt in fourth...we thought it was too salty...overall a good recipe though :)

AWESOME!!!!!! Beware-for garlic LOVERS only.  This was soooo good and very easy to make.  I substituted garlic powder for the fresh garlic and it turned out great.  I used 6 chicken breasts and needed 3 egg yolks to make enough marinade.  My husband and kids(2&4y/o) LOVED it.  Served it with buttered noodles and sweet peas. YUMMY!!!

I made this recipe for a dinner party and I got nothing but compliments the whole meal.  I even used frozen chicken breasts and they still turned out very tender and melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  I served this dish with garlic and herb pesto pasta, french bread, and a greek salad.

This recipe was so good!! I marinated for twenty four hours and it was juicy and tender--no knife needed.  The only change I made was to eliminate most of the salt, I used only a pinch, and think it was plenty.  Excellent recipe!  My husband melted cheese on it and ate it in a sandwich with lettuce and mayo, and said it was the best chicken sandwich he ever ate!  Coming from the man who complains every time I make chicken, that was quite a compliment!!  This will become a staple in our house!!

Loved it!  My house smelled like and Italian restaurant. I think the amount of salt was a typo...I just used 1/4 tsp. I took the one reviewer's suggestion and added another egg yolk to the marinade. For those of you who said they were left with a lot of bread crumbs...try one or both of these...use more chicken (I used 6 large breasts and was left with maybe 1/4 cup.), or place half the mixture in another bowl before you dip the chicken and refrigerate it for the next time you make the meal.

No knife nessescary for this chicken. It is tender and juicy. The bread crumbs make a flavorful crust, I wouldnt change a thing about the recipe. I give it 5 stars all the way.

I used freshly grated parmesan, fresh parsley, a little extra butter a little bit more garlic, and seasoned the chicken w/ salt and pepper while it marinated overnite. It was a hit! This is a keeper. I served it over seasoned rice and boiled broccolli! yummy!

This was EXCELLENT!!!  I served it for guests and everyone loved it. It was so tender I didn't need to use a knife! I sprinkled shredded Monterey Jack cheese and fresh sliced green onions on top about 5 minutes before It was done. Made a very pretty presentation! The  wonderful aroma coming out of the oven while cooking is only exceeded by the taste of this recipe!!

I was very disappointed by this recipe.  The chicken itself was not ruined but the outer breading was dry.  This was also a lot of garlic even for a garlic lover (which I am).  If you are going to try it, I would suggest using only 2/3 the recomended garlic.

This was great chicken!  I changed it a little...instead of baking in the oven, I pan-fried it in a little olive oil, put it in a baking dish, covered with tomato sauce & mozarella cheese.  I baked it for about 20 minutes to melt the cheese.  Spectacular Chicken Parmisana.

Very easy to prepare and cook.  Garlic flavor was good and so was the crunchy outside.  It got great reviews from the family and has been added to the make again list.

This dish was great, super tasty and moist. My whole family ate it and loved it! But I used chicken strips and it turned out great, only thing is that it took longer, about 10 more minutes of baking on each side for it to get a nice golden brown around edges. I'm definitely making this again and again!

I made this last night. I used about 6 egg yolks for the marinade. Turned out really well, but the amount of garlic used is a bit overpowering. I will certainly try making it with less next time (perhaps leaving out the garlic powder in the bread crumb mixture).

I did not care for this recipe. With all the awesome reviews, I was so excited to try this recipe.
I followed the directions to a T, except I added another egg yolk as others suggested. I served it with spaghetti, red sauce and garlic bread.
I realize that a lot of recipes are far more messy and time consuming than this one, but this was not worth the effort.

simply AWESOME. juicy as can be! i let it sit in the fridge overnight. cut back on the parm + bread crumbs like others recommended (used 3/4, 1/2 cup, respectively) and omitted garlic powder as i didn't have any on hand. still very garlic-y and mega YUM. will make again with guests, definitely.

This was very good.  I used chicken thighs instead of breasts.  I also used panko instead of bread crumbs.  It was very garlicky - but really good.  My husband requested it again so it's a winner.

Very good and easy to put together! Although I thought the one egg yolk might not be quite sufficient. I would probably use 2 next time.

Very good.....I would recommend cutting the salt and if you are watching what you eat to replace thebutter in the pan with Pam. I used butter and it was a bit greasy. Maybe just decreasing it would do the trick as well. Overall, GREAT dish, I am always looking for new ways to cook chicken breasts and this was simple and very flavorful!

Very, very good! I agree, however with all the reviewers who said to ease up on the bread/parm cheese mixture. I suggest 3/4 cup each-maybe even a little less. Otherwise, awesome flavor. Oh, also add some cayenne pepper and dried oregano to breading mixture if you like more flavor and a little heat!

This chicken was good, although I would highly recommend letting it marinate overnight. I marinated for 6 hours and I could barely taste the garlic in the chicken. It was very moist, easy to make, and went alongside spaghetti very well. Also, I used the recommended 6tbs butter and I felt like they were swimming in butter and juice by the time I took it out. I would cut it down to 3 or 4 tbs but definitely don't cut it out altogether.

This recipe was simple, and it's hard to mess up chicken so I gave it 4 stars. There are a few reasons that it's not a 5: First, it took a bit more than just 1 egg yolk to make enough marinade. I used 3 egg yolks for 4 breast halves. Second, this recipe made WAY more breading than I actually needed. I think it would've been sufficient for 12 breast halves. I will consider making this dish again, since it was rather tasty. However, I'll definitely adjust the ingredients.

This was very moist and flavorful! The only Change I made was using more Egg Yolks (one per Chicken Breast). Came out great and will definitely make this again!

very, very good. the coating actually stayed on the chicken and it was very moist. The only problem I had was it didn't want to brown in the oven, so I fried it the last 10 minutes on the stove and it came out a great golden color. I only soaked it in the egg for about 2 hours due to time constraints, I can only imagine what it would taste like soaked overnight. Will be sure to try that next time. thanks for a great recipe, this one is a keeper.

i have had this in my recipe box for 2 years and have never thrown it together until now. it was worth keeping around. this was surprisingly flavorful. i added some poultry seasoning and only used 4 tbs of butter, which was plenty. shook it all up in a baggie -- it only marinated for 3 hours since i was in a hurry. i'll make it again. thanks for the recipe!

It takes a lot for me to rate a 5, but I would give this 10 stars! I make this again and again, and give everyone the recipe. You just have to plan ahead for the chicken to sit overnight, but it is SO good and very easy!

This was great! I was trying to find different ways to make chicken so my bf won't get tired of it. He really enjoyed it. I didn't get a chase to let the chicken marinate at all but it was still flavorful. I can only imagine when I let it soak up all the goodness...yummy!

Had to comment on my bad experience and hope you don't make the same mistake. Because I only used 1/2 a chicken, I had it in a 9x9 GLASS pan. When I went to check on it in the oven, the bottom was burning. So I added a bit of tap water. MY GLASS PAN BROKE IN THE OVEN. Do not make my mistake! Either use enough butter or add water in the beginning, or use a metal baking pan! I had to clean up glass pieces in the oven and buy a new glass pan. I will try this recipe again using a metal pan.

Very good recipe. Everyone in my family loved it & it will be added to the rotation. Very easy to prepare and yields delicious results. I used 3 large boneless/skinless chick breasts. 2 whole eggs instead of just the yolks. I soaked the chicken for about 3 hrs b/4 baking. Would be even better w/ longer soaking. Prepared breading as directed & had a little left over...but I dipped in egg & then lightly coated in breading, dipped in egg again & then a heavy coating of breading. Needed a little more egg/garlic mixture to have some to drizzle over chicken b/4 cooking. Also, used olive oil spray instead of butter in pan. Baked 35 minutes, turning once 1/2 thru cooking. Delicious!!!

Not for the non-garlic lover, but I love to fix this chicken for myself...a true garlic mama!  I often cut it up and serve on top of greens and sliced strawberries with balsamic viniagrette dressing for a great salad!  Super, garlicky chicken with lots of possibilities!

Simply amazing!  I didn't have enough bread crumbs so I used ground up veggie thin crackers since thats what I had on hand.  This recipe is easy and taste great, a definite keeper!

This was a good recipe. I double breaded the chicken. The only part that was a problem was the fact that the bread on the bottom ended up stuck to the pan, rather than the chicken. I think this might be good on pork chops also.

I halve the recipe as I am the only meat eater in our house. The garlic is very subjective. I use 3 small cloves and I love garlic. I could probably use more. I've let it marinate even for an hour and it's fine. The great thing about marinating it overnight is that all you need to do it bread it and pop it in the oven the next day, which is fantastic right after work.

this is very good. i use panko breadcrumbs for extra crunch. i also put a thin layer of breadcrumbs on the bottom of the pan to help prevent sticking and spray them with cooking spray. this is a favorite in our house since we love garlic.

We love garlic and this is a great chicken recipe.  I like it because it tastes garlicy but is very mellow, more like an aftertaste. Good for people who aren't fond of garlic.  I've made it a few times and it always comes out really juicy.  I use my probe thermometer and pull it out of the oven as soon as its about 5 dgrees shy of being done cover it it with foil and let it coast its way to the finish.  I also use about 5 or 6 egg yolks.  One? what does that do?
Great recipe.  Its our favorite baked chicken dish.  I slice up the leftovers really thin and make quesadillas out of it.  yummy!!!!

I thought this pretty good.  I didn't see the point of the egg yolk -- I made it a second time and soaked it in a whole egg and noticed no difference.  I agree there's way too much breading; I dipped it in the butter and back into the breading a couple of times, and it was still too much.  Since I liked the flavor, I think I'd like to try just cutting the bread crumbs (not the whole mixture) in half.

I love this dish! I cut the parmesan to about 3/4 cup but that's my preference. I always cut my chicken breast down to tender size and they get alot more flavor! Then serve over a variety of pasta dishes! This has become a big hit with family and friends!

My boyfriend really liked this.  It has a really good flavor, the only thing is, I just find myself missing the marinara sauce and pasta because it is SO much like chicken parmesan.  I don't know where people got that it was too garlicky.  It wasn't at all.

The first time I made this recipe I thought it was good, but nothing amazing . . . a little soggy for our liking, but the flavor was FANTASTIC.  The next time we tried it, we just cooked it in a pan coated with cooking spray on the stove and it was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.  We will make this again and again!  YUM!

This recipes was ok. I did like the outside layer of breading. I found this recipe to be rather bland. With more seasonings it would have been much more tasty. I do think it is a good base to start from though, that is why I gave it a four. Will make again adding more flavor!

Hooray and thank you for this receipe for it is well liked by all the food critics  in my family, that is a rarity. I did use egg white instead of egg yolk and whole wheat unsweetened shredded wheat crumbled instead of bread crumbs. I didn't have time to marinate longer than 15 minutes but it was so delicious.

Great!  Fast and easy too!  There was way too much breading leftover, so I would cut it in half.  I also did 1/3 of the butter, and next time will probably only "Pam" it to be healthier.  Great recipe!

If you like fresh garlic then this is a must-make recipe.  It has a wonderful garlic flavor and the chicken is so moist.  The breading is crunchy and flavorful.

I served it with mashed potatoes and green beans w/tomoatoes.

I will be making this again and again.

We found this to just be ok. Nothing special. I was hoping for more from all the great reviews. I agree with past reviewers that it needs at least 2 yolks and you can cut the breading mixture in half and still have plenty. Overall it was an easy to make family friendly recipe.

Just great. Not enough egg yolk but added 2 more. Did not use all the bread mixture. Took out enough each time for 1 breast and what was left over put in sealed container and saved for future use. Will certainly make this recipe again & again.

This recipe is pretty good. I marinated overnight, and added an italian seasoning packet to the breadcrumb mixture for extra flavor, and since I added that I ommitted the parsley and garlic powder. I used less butter, and it was still good.

wow, what a delicious dish! i finally got around to making this chicken (after putting it in my recipe box last august) & am just amazed at both the ease & taste! don't be shy about using the recommended amount of garlic. the strong flavor is mellowed by the baking process. i marinated my chicken for 8 hours, turning once. quick tip: carefully warm your baking dish on the stove top then turn off the heat. put your cut butter in the bottom of the dish & allow it to melt while you're getting the bread crumb mixture together. thanks for this keeper, amy!

Good solid everyday chicken dish, I halved the breading, butter and garlic and it came out perfect.  I wouldn't make this for company or anything, but chicken came out fairly juicy and flavorful. Not as good as Cooking Light's Chicken Francais....

Lovely way to make chicken.  Used a whole egg instead of just the yolk and was fine.  Did cut back a bit on the bread crumbs.  To help use what still was a pretty generous amount of breading, dipped the chicken in the garlic/egg mixture again and rebreaded, pressing the breading onto the chicken.  There was still a little breading left over and just dusted that on top the pieces.  Doing this didn't leave enough egg to drizzle on top, so used some of the butter.  Chicken was crispy outside, tender and juicy inside.  And oh, so garlicky!  Yum!

Very yummy recipe! Made it with chicken breasts and also skinless chicken legs and worked out deliciously both times. The only problem I had was that there was too much breadcrumb mixture compared to the chicken. Next time will reduce mixture to prevent waste! Thanks!

This was good but way too much crumb mixture leftover.  Halving the crumb mixture would have been more than enough.  I also do not think that you need to use so much butter.  3 tbsp would have worked out just fine.  The seasoning was really good on the chicken.

i found this recipe as I was looking for a good recipe with the breast alone, not wanting to cook an entire chicken. this was an easy and tasty recipe for chicken and garlic lovers! i loved it! we made 8 pieces, it was amazing! i had so many compliments! you can put more or less garlic according to your tastes, and you can eliminate the garlic powder all together. we also put much more bread crumbs, you can adjust according to your taste. i highly recommend.

I was a little confused by this dish - I used only two boneless, skinless chicken breasts and there was barely enough egg yolk to cover them (none to "pour remaining egg mixture over the chicken!).  I marinated this chicken for quite a long time (2 days), and then baked as per the recipe instructions.  We found the chicken to be moist and juicy, but it lacked flavour.  We didn't hate this recipe, but we would probably not make it again.

I halved the bread crumb mixture and there was plenty to cover the chicken.  I also used 3 egg yolks instead of just one, I dont think that one would have been enough.  This was very tasty, I will make again.  I served with a pasta side dish.

Absolutely fabulous, but only for true garlic lovers!!!  I use 3 egg yolks for more moisture, and I decrease the salt a bit.  I love to cut it up, after cooking is and  cooling it a bit and serve it on top of spinach as a salad.  I add cut up strawberries, sliced green onions, and crumbled feta cheese, and serve it with a balsalmic vinaigrette.  Yummy!  There are so many ways to use this chicken.  I experiment with different sauces on top, as well.  Thanks for such a great and versatile recipe!

This was good, I used chicken tenders so needed more egg, but had plenty of bread crumb mixture.  Also cut back on some of the butter. All in all, a good recipe, not as extraordinary as I thought it would be though, but will probably make again and bf liked it fine.

Wonderful.  So tender and juicy and flavorful.  Wouldn't recommend this if you don't LOVE garlic, though.  I also used 3 egg yolks instead of 1, but I lessened the butter to about 3 T.

This was quite good, I think it needed more egg yolks though, I used two but could've done with another one.  There is no egg left at the end to put over the chicken.

OK- I need to be the 475th person to submit a review, b/c this is so good. I also cut the bread crumbs in half, used 2 eggs and cooked it 15 min on each side. Chix was moist and flavorful. I added thick cuts of zuchinni and dipped them in the bread mixture. Delic!

I have looked at this recipe for over a year and all of the rave reviews. I didn't like this recipe at all. I will not make this one again. The flavor was just all garlic which I don't think blends well with the chicken in such mass quantity. And I say this as a garlic lover. Thanks, but no thanks.

This recipe was pretty good.  I think it could have been better if the chicken was pounded a little bit first.  You definately need to cut the bread crumb mixture in half.  Most of it went to waste.

I don't know what all the fuss is about with this chicken.  I am a garlic lover but this was just  okay.  I made four breast and the breading fell off  of two of them.  So I just laid the coating back on and placed it on a platter.  I used flavored croutons that I crushed instead of plain bread crumbs and fresh parsley because I didn't have dried.  The chicken did look good and didn't taste bad either and I am sure I will give it another try.  Also remember to save half of the bread crumb mixture before adding the chicken.

This recipe was DELICIOUS! It was very easy to follow, and everyone loved it.  I only used about 14 cup of Parmesan cheese and I used Italian Style bread crumbs instead of plain.  I will make this again!

This is a great dish that I am going to add to our regular dinner rotation!  My fiance, who hates anything breaded, really liked this because the breading wasn't too thick.  This dish is very easy to make and would be great for company also.  The only change I made was that I doubled the egg.  Thanks Amy!

This was a wonderful dish!  I was a little woried that it would be a too garlicy since I let it sit over night.  So I didn't add garlic to the breading mix.  I did use Italian seaoned bread crumbs(they worked great).  Other reviews stated that there was too much breading but I disagree completly.  I used the extra breading on my ceaser salad that I put the chicken on.  Excellent!

Very tasty chicken recipe!!  I too found one egg yolk not enough to coat chicken so I just used the entire egg.  I also added a little good seasons italian seasoning for a bit more kick but, the garlic flavor is fantastic.  Thanks Amy!!

My husband and sons loved this and they can be very picky! I used the ziploc bag idea which made cleanup easy. I didn't have any parsley in the house, so I used about 1 tsp Italian seasoning instead. Also substituted eggbeaters for the egg yolks. Next time I'll use even more beaters (about 1/2 cup) to mix with the garlic so I'll have more to pour over the chicken. It made for a nice crispy coating. Thanks Amy!

Very good!!  I used chicken tenders and only marinated for about an hour, but they were yummy...served on top of a caesar salad for a light supper.

Excellent!!  I didn't marinade the chicken, just let it sit for about 10 minutes in the egg and garlic.  It still came out with a great garlic flavor!!   Next time I think I'll leave out the butter and just drizzle some olive oil over the top of each breast.  This is definitly one I'll keep using!!

YUM! I only marinated the chicken for about 40 minutes, and I'm sure longer would have been better, but it was still deeeeelicious. Per others' suggestions I halved the breading recipe and had plenty. I also used 5 tsps of prechopped garlic in the jar instead of fresh which made prep easier for me and the results were great. GREAT recipe.

I haven't had much luck with the 'top ten' receipes so far but I can proudly say this won is great!
I marinated the chicken for 8 hours then crumbed and baked with no oil or butter but found it started to brown to quickly and had to use a small amount of cooking spray.
Will be making again for sure.

We were a little disappointed, just because of all the buildup this recipe got.  It tastes OK, and is pretty easy to make, but it didn't seem like anything special to us, just another breaded chicken recipe.  It's worth trying, but not a five-star recipe to us.

I actually used this method with veal, and liked it very much.  I can't wait to try it with the chicken.  Thanks Amy!  I would have never thought to marinade meat like this.

This is an excellant recipe! Have made it several times since i found the recipe a few months ago. Only thing i did not do was pour the egg/garlic mix over before baking. we have also topped with provolone cheese for the last 10 minutes of baking.Yummy!

I thought these were just ok, but my husband & his friend like it.  It smelled wonderful while baking but there was to much butter!  There was also an excess of bread crumbs.  I used chicken thighs, maybe would have been better with breasts.  I'll have to give this another try.

Yum Yum!  I used less butter and about 1/3 to 1/2 of the bread crumb mixture but the flavor is delish - if you like garlic that is!!

This is the second time I have rated this dish.  I have accidentally used whole eggs and can tell absolutely no difference in the outcome.  I also only use a portion of the bread crumb mixture and save the leftover for pork chops or any other cut of meat you wish.  It is good on anything.

Great chicken recipe - my family has a hard time finding chicken breast recipes that we like.  This one's a keeper.  My only suggestion is to increase the amount of egg used.

Excellent!!!  I let the chicken sit in the fridge for 1 1/2 days marinating!!!  So good and tender, great taste too!!!  I cut the breading in half and sprinkled the little that was left over onto the chicken, even after it had been flipped.  This one is going out to friends tonight.  Thanks so much!!!

Garlic was overwhelming on this and I found it too dry, maybe just too much bread crumbs. This one will not be a keeper in our house.

This recipe was simple & easy.  I had a lot of leftover bread crumb, cheese & herb mixture.  though.  The chicken came out moist & tender.  My children & husband all loved it.

Great recipe!!!  Both my husband & I loved it....we loved every bite and even split the last piece (No leftovers with this recipe).  I used three chicken breasts rather than four and reduced the ingredients to compensate for the missing piece. I was amazed at how moist and tender the chicken was.   However, even after reducing the ingredients I found that I had a lot of the breadcrumb mixture leftover. This is definitely a keeper!!

This recipe was okay but not great. I let my chicken marinate for almost 24 hours but it wasn't juicy and tender like I'd hoped. I did use enormous chicken breasts and I know I would have liked it better if I'd have made them into nuggets instead of cooking them whole.

This was so easy and delicious!  I only used 3 garlic cloves instead of 6.  I served it like chicken parmesean from an italian restaurant on pasta with Prego spaghetti sauce (garlic parmesean).  With garlic rolls and a ceasar salad, my family was in heaven. Just be ready for some mouthwash before bed!!

Love it!  My boyfriend requests this all the time, it's his favorite, and I like it too! I've used pre-crushed garlic in a jar, and it works just as well, although I usually use more.  I find buying Italian seasoned breadcrumbs is easier and tastier than seasonsing the breadcrumbs yourself.  I usually only marinate it for an hour or so as well, and it's still just great!

This is a great recipe...but for the faint at heart, I believe half of the garlic requirement will satisfy!  The coating on the chicken was great, and it was so moist, but the 6 gloves of garlic was a might bit over powering.  As my husband stated, "we will have no fear of vampires tonight!".

I was slightly disappointed in this recipe. I love garlic but talk about overpowering! Also, I thought it needed more then one egg yolk in the recipe.

My mom was visting and we were looking for smething new with pizzaz.  Great recipie, but my four year old twins gave it the thumbs down, making us scrape off the crumb coating.  Too bad for them.  Thanks Amy.

This recipe was very good!  I never knew that egg yolks tenderized meat - it sounded so odd to me that I had to try it - and it worked!  I have to say though, even for the garlic lovers we are, I would cut down a little (not a lot) next time I make this, because I will make it again!  Thanks!

Thought that much garlic was going to be over bearing, but it was great once it was baked.    It seemed like a lot of breading, so I also used 1/4 of the breading in egg noodles with butter.  Great dinner!

Very tastey dish!  After reading other reviews, I used 3 cloves of garlic instead of 6.  Also, for a lower-fat option, I tried spraying the baking dish with PAM instead of using the butter.  It worked  great for me.

This recipe is great.  I make it with skinless boneless chicken tenders.  I do advise cutting the spices a bit if you use the tenders. I only use 1 teaspoon of garlic powder and 1 teaspoon of pepper and it's enough.  This recipe is great with noodles with a little olive oil and parmesean and a steamed veggie.

VERY good!!  My non-chicken loving husband liked it, too!  I think Amy was guessing at some of the quantities for the ingredients, but with a little adjustment, it's fine.  1 tablespoon of salt has to be a typo:  make it 1 teaspoon.  Cut the bread crumbs in half, but keep the rest of the cheese and spices the same.  More breading on top when you turn over while cooking.  I used sourdough dressing mix for bread crumbs.  Good flavor.  This is a keeper for us!

Awesome!  I made this for the first time at a dinner party with friends and family and everyone LOVED it! (Including me!)  The chicken is so tender and the breading so crispy, I will definatly be making this again...soon! I followed the other reviewers suggestions and put some of the bread crumbs on the chicken after flipping it half way through, thanx!

This recipe is okay. It was a little bland. If I make this again, I will defintely cut the bread mixture in half. I had way too much left over. It's a good idea to add more bread mixture to the chicken when you turn it otherwise it comes out soggy instead of crispy.

Thank you Amy! We love this chicken dish. At first I wondered if one egg yolk would be enough to marinate and coat the chicken, but I followed the recipe exactly and achieved delicious results. I prepare this at least once a month whenever we are craving a comforting, juicy chicken dinner. Great with mashed potatoes and buttered peas.

I used garlic powder instead of garlic cloves, and not as much as would equal 6 cloves of garlic anyway.  I also added salt, pepper, and rotisserie chicken spice to the bread crumb mix for extra flavor, and everyone loved it!  I also cut up small pieces of boneless, skinless chicken and made chicken nuggets for my kids and it was a hit!  Great recipie, Amy.  Thanks!

Great recipe.  The garlic flavor was a little too strong for my family, so I omitted the marinade part and just dipped the chicken breasts in egg yolk and them dipped them in the dry ingredient mix.  I also put saute'd mushrooms and melted mozzerella cheese on top after baking. Tasted better than our favorite restaurant chicken!

Served this along with homemade cream of Asparagus soup. It was a winner! Loved the garlic and the moistness of the chicken.

I would cut back on the breading mixture as measured, however, as I had a lot left over and felt that it was a waste of the ingredients.

After reading the reviews I cut the garlic and bread crumb mixture in half. I expected to be disappointed but boy was I wrong! This chicken is elegant looking, incredibly moist, and absolutely delicious!!!

GREAT Flavor! This was very good. I had a guest over and he couldn't help but say 'mmm' between every single bite. He said he was jealous of my husband always getting such good homecooked meals. This was really good with pasta and cheddar bay biscuits!! Definitely cook this if you like chicken. I pounded my chicken thin because that is how i liked it. Half the breading and you will still have plenty. VERY Good!

This chicken was absolutly amazing.  It was my first time cooking a home-cooked meal for my family and they loved it.  The chicken is not very children friendly, so I just cooked them a hotdog instead, but despite that grown ups of all ages should try this delightful, easy recipe!!

We love garlic.  I used turkey tenderloin sliced very thin .  It was good and kids said make it again!  It was rather spicy even for me so I will use less garlic powder next time.   I cut the breadcrumb/cheese mix  using only 1/3 cup of each.   I still had enough.  I didn't need 6T of butter either.   All in all I liked this and will try it again.  Thanks!

Great recipe!  The flavor is fabulous.  I rated it a bit lower on the quickness scale becauseit takes a while to marinate.  Definitely a "plan-ahead" meal!

Outstanding.  I highly recommend letting the chicken marinate overnight instead of just 4 hours - really gets that garlic in the meat.

Also - the bread crumb mixture portion was WAY too much for the chicken.  My 4 person recipe had enough crumb mixture for 8 breast halves.  I don't know if this was a allrecipes.com mess up, but... I just froze the rest for another day!

This is company-worthy for the non-cooks out there like me.

We  like garlic but not this much, soooo, I used salad seasoning instead of garlic in the marinade.  Instead of just breadcrumbs I used seasoned stuffing mix.  This gave the chicken just a taste of sage.  I also used chicken strips.  It was sooo good!  This is a really great recipe because you can tweek it to match your family's likes!   Good one.

As stated before, the recipe makes "way too much" of the crumb mixure, I will cut this in half next time.  Couldn't find regular bread crumbs at the grocery store, so I used Italian style bread crumbs, VERY GOOD.  Will make this again and again.  Husband said to keep this recipe.

Great recipe - the only problem was the recipe made way too much of the crumb mixture and I had to throw away over half.  Next time I will cut the crumb mixture in half.

I did not have time to marinate 4+ hours and I intuitively did not use the full amount of breadcrumbs, salt or pepper.  It still came out delicious and my picky-eater son gave his seal of approval.

changed this recipe, and it turned out great!  As I raise chickens and eggs, always looking for recipes.  Not a fan of Parsley, eliminated it (dryed tends to burn), 1/2 the garlic, doubled the egg, used Gluten free breadcrumbs, and, I live in MD, so added Old Bay to the GF breadcrumbs, as well as onion powder.  The added salt from the old bay, as well as the onion powder, added to the flavor.  Overall, happy with the dish.

SO delicious! My chicken breasts were on the small side so I sprinkled a little of the extra breading on top before I baked it. I used panko bread crumbs. I think maybe subtracting a tablespoon or two of butter wouldn't hurt. I would be interested to try it with just a little olive oil to replace the butter also.

I used two egg yolkes and cut my chicken into chunks.  I melted the butter in a separate dish and saved some to drizzle over the top.  Goes great with a bottle of Malbec.  Served with asparagus and oven rosemary roasted taters!

I have never marinated in chicken in egg yolk and loved the result!  Next time I'll be sure to let it marinate overnight, only gave it about 2 hours but it was still fantastic.  I used one and a half large breasts cut and pounded thin into 6 pieces.  My baking dish didn't hold all of the pieces so I sauteed some in oil and butter, they crisped up very nicely.

Killer chix, perfect seasoning!  So easy.  Get dinner done.  Didn't have time so marinaded only 2 hrs & i don't think any more time is needed/less is ok cause the garlic is bomb.  I had 8 chix tenderloins, used same seasoning but used used 3/4 C. each parmesan & panko flakes, used a 9x9" dish, 1/2 the butter, 20 minutes served with greenbeans in a lemondillbutter sauce & roasted potatoes in cumin/chilipowder/italian seasoning. Yum.

Very good!  I also doubled the egg yolk, and the chicken came out very moist and tender with a great garlic flavour. I marinated for 4 hours only and it was pretty good.

Great flavor! I didn't let the chicken sit 4 hours as the recipe suggested, only for about 15 mintues... and it was still very tasty.  I also didn't have enough bread crumbs, so I used about a 1/2 cup of crushed cornflakes, and again... still tasty!  My 3 year old son at it up too!  Thanks!

This yummy dish is definitely for garlic lovers.  I scaled back to four cloves, and it was still a little too much for us...next time I'll cut back even more.  But the chicken and the breading itself is delicious.  I used two whole eggs to marinade the chicken, and drizzled the leftover on top, and that really made this a unique breaded baked chicken.  I also replaced the butter with olive oil and it was delicious.  Didn't miss the butter at all.  Thanks for a great recipe!  I will definitely be making this again!

This chicken was great! Followed the recipe exactly except had to sustitute breadcrumbs with stuffing that I had crushed. Also followed advice of others and halved the salt and pepper Super Delicous!

This makes really good chicken, very tender and has a nice garlic flavor.  My husband wasn't a fan but he's not into baked chicken so no surprise there.  To cut down on the fat, I omitted the butter and used non stick cooking spray.  It would make a great chickem parm, and that's what I'll use it for next time.

Everyone was really concerned when they saw the amount of garlic I put in the marinade, but everyone loved this!  I used three egg yolks, but followed the recipe exactly beyond that.  Served with roasted potatoes and dinner rolls!

Best recipe I've tried from this site, hands down.  I cut the boneless chicken breasts into 3 pieces then pounded to make medallions (just my preference)before marinating in double the egg...omg, perfect breading and the chicken was so tender it cut easily with a fork.  Without a doubt my go to recipe for chicken from now on.

This chicken is so full of flavor. I used 2 eggs to make the garlic "marinade" instead of 1- it coated all 4 breasts evenly. I also reduced the bread crumbs to 1/2 cup and the cheese 3/4 cup. It was so moist and tender after cooking 15 mins each side.

We enjoyed this chicken recipe. I pounded the chicken down, used three egg yolks and marinated for 8 hours. I tried making half of the recipe healthier by omitting the butter and although the cheese burned some, the flavor was still very good. I would recommend sticking to the recipe and using the butter if you don't mind the extra calories.

I had 3 chicken breasts, which I cut into 7 approximately equal pieces (the third breast was larger than the first two) and I used one whole egg with another yolk. I also used panko bread crumbs, because that's what I had around. Also, I substituted cumin seeds for the parsley (with more than the recipe called for) and it was really really delicious.

This chicken was amazing! I give it 4 stars because I altered it a little bit. I used 1/2c of Italian bread crumbs, added Italian seasoning, and for an added touch...melted mozzarella cheese on at the end. I covered and baked it for 20 minutes on each side, then uncovered it and did another 10 minutes to get the cheese nice and brown. I served it with Rice-a-Roni's long grain and wild rice and broccoli steamed with olive oil and Italian seasoning.

My family absolutely adored this recipe. The chicken was wonderfully tender, and the garlic was not overpowering at all. The only thing I changed was that I used more egg yolks than was called for, as did many people who already reviewed. Great recipe!

I cheated on this recipe; I omitted the egg and refrigerating for a few hours. (I know, that's probably the entire point of the recipe, hence the title, so I appologize.) I also didn't have garlic cloves so I used garlic powder. It was a big hit though with my boyfriend and our roommate! I'll have to try it again actually using the egg and chilling for awhile. Thanks!

This is definitely a keeper in my house. Like others suggested, I used two egg yolks, and as we're garlic fans (fanatics even?). The chicken was incredibly moist- I marinated it for almost 6 hours- and we really loved the egg/garlic mixture on top of the chicken. I'll be making it again for sure

This was so very good. It has a great garlic taste without feeling like your eating straight cloves. I didn't soak it for four hours and I sprayed pam on the pan instead of butter and I added the cheese in the last few minutes but that was about it. This is a great tasting and fast dinner.

After all the rave reviews, I was quite disappointed.  The chicken was very bland.  More spices/seasonings are needed in the breading mix.

Yummy Parmesan cheese and garlic crust on the chicken. A keeper for the recipe file.

I really liked this recipe. If you love garlic like I do than you cant not like this. The chicken turned out real tender. Thanks for the recipe.

Great recipe. I have been making this for a long time, before I ever saw the recipe here. I  like to mix additional garlic with the breadcrumb mixture. I also leave out the butter and just spray the pan with some olive oil Pam because its healthier.
Serves great with Sara's applesauce recipe from this site.

Very good and easy. I marinated the chicken in the egg and garlic mixture overnight. I did use 2 whole eggs instead of just the yolk of one (husband thought the cooked egg mixture in the pan was quite tasty.) Next time I will reduce all of the crumb mixture by half - had way too much left over. Thanks for a great recipe Amy!

Outstanding!  Even my kids inhaled this!  I only marinated for an hour, due to time constraints.  I had no egg left at the end to use over the dish, but it didn't seem to matter.  Superb!

After all the amazing reviews, I was expecting a lot more.  My boyfriend and I both agreed that all in all, it was okay, but nothing fantastic.  I followed everything in the recipe, except I used two whole eggs.

Wonderful an easy.  The kids love and so do I.  I have made this dozens of times and found it has not made a difference using whole egg or just the yoks.  So instead of having waste I use two whole eggs.  YUMMY.

I would give this 4.5 stars. My husband and I LOVED it. The kids found it "too garlicy". I will try it again with less garlic and think it will still be good. I did 6 breasts and followed a couple of other reviewers advice. I increased the number of egg yolks to 5 and mainated in a ziploc bag. I also think that the breading mixture could be cut in half. This is a great recipe and it will become a regular dish at our house....UPDATE: If this is too garlicy for you, try the Garlic Chicken on this site. It is also very good and very easy, but less garlic. Kids loved the Garlic Chicken. My husband and I like both.

We love the "Garlic Chicken" recipe from this site & decided to try this one which seems similar, but did not care for it.  There was too much breading, the egg on top made it soggy, the cooking time was not long enough.

I usually change recipes when I make them, but not this one. I made it according to its instructions. It was delicious, and I will make it again. I do agree with the others who say there was too much breading mixture.

This chicken is fabulous!  I used 3 eggs to cover the chicken.  One warning though, I poured some of the egg mixture over the chicken and when it pooled in the dish, it formed scrambled egg on the end of each breast.  Pretty funny looking!  It was very tasty and I will definitely make it again.

My husband raved about this recipe and he only comments when he really likes something!  I love garlic but, like some others, I found this to be quite pungent.  I even omitted the garlic powder because I thought 6 cloves would be enough.  However, I will definitely use this recipe again and maybe modifiy it a bit.

Yum for flavor and ease!  But only 4 stars for crunch-factor.  Next time I'll fry this on the stove top for extra crunch.  Based on other reviews- I cut down on breadcrumbs and parm cheese- 3/4 cup for each and it was perfect.  Thanks for this great recipe!

This is a great recipe!  I did find though that it turned out a bit soggy when cooking it in the oven.  Maybe next time I'll try pan frying it in a bit of butter...yum! Also as others mentioned, there was way too much extra breading...half of that would probably work.

I really liked this.  I did as others have mentionned and used about half the breading and I omitted the butter.  Maybe I would have liked it more with the butter.  For leftovers the next day, I poured some creamed soup on top which made it much more enjoyable.  I think next time I will add the butter and the soup right away.  Very tasty though and pretty easy.

I've tried several of the Hall of Fame recipes and find that, generally, they aren't as good as many other recipes on this website that have many fewer reviews.  Not all of them (Bake Pork Chops, Clone of a Cinnabon, Brown Sugar Meatloaf, Mrs Siggs Snickerdoodles all are great!).  But it's hard to imagine why some get so much attention.  I did not think this chicken was so ravingly good; I LOVE garlic, but this had a pungency that just was not that good.  Followed the recipe, but on the advice of other reviewers, used 3 egg yolks (I can't imagine using fewer), omitted the salt (health reasons, and parmesan is salty), and halved the breadcrumbs.  It somehow managed to taste better, reheated, as leftovers; but I doubt I'd make it again for that reason.

This was really good and easy to make.  The garlic flavor was really nice.  I will be making this again and again:)

This had great flavor.  It was quick and easy since it was all ready to go when I got home from work so it can even be put in the oven before you get home.

Simple and good.  I especially liked the way the chicken was pretty moist.  I didn't have any garlic powder or dried parsley and it still was good.

Great~ My husband loved it.  I thought it could use two egg yolks as one did not wet the chicken enough but a good recipe overall.

This is a really good recipe.  We loved the garlic!  It, however is not very healthy.  I tried to lighten it up a little using egg substitute for the yolk and I think you could probably make it with less butter.  It is a keeper though.  Thanks!

With a couple modifications next time I make it, this will be a 5 star recipe for my family.  I will halve the bredding as I had so much remaining. Too much pepper for my taste.  The chicken was very tender and flavorful.

Wow!  If you like garlic, you'll love this chicken!  For my family (or, at least for those who aren't as much as a garlic fan and me!), I'll cut the garlic in half next time.  This is really great -- wonderful flavor.

Great simple chicken dish. I added another egg yolk and it was perfect. Great served with steamed broccoli and cheese. It wasn't too garlicky at all, and my husband loved it too.

Perfect recipe! I let the chicken sit overnight, which I highly recommend. I used only 3/4 cup of bread crumbs and still had some over. Tastes delicious also with romano cheese. To cut back on fat I only used enough butter to grease the bottom of the dish, then drizzled a small amount of olive oil over the breaded chicken right before baking. That definitely added some great flavor and made it extra juicy. Cheap, easy, and delicious. Thanks!

WONDERFUL!! This is one of the best chicken recipes I have ever made.  I cut down on the garlic a little and used one extra egg yolk and seasoned the mixture well while it marinated with the chicken. I also used italian bread crumbs for extra flavor.  My chicken came out SO moist and was absolutely delicious.  My family loved it and we have made it several times.  Thanks Amy!!!!

This should be called "Amy's EXTREME Garlic Egg Chicken". I would say I somewhat enjoyed this recipe... But the amount of garlic was  a little much. My mouth was burning garlic... I was worried about still reeking of it the next day at work!

I used chicken tenders instead of the breast. I also needed two egg yolks. I ommited the garlic powder. Marinated it all for about 30 hours. I think what I liked best was how easy it was.

Suprisingly underwhelmed with this recipe.  Chicken was not juicy.  I marinated for 8 hours and cooked it on a rack in the oven to lower the fat.  I guess you cannot lower the fat/calories without compromising the taste.  That is a shame since the nutritional info on this dish is shocking!  It took twice as long to cook as the recommended time and I even flattened out the chicken before hand.  Will not be making again.

This was good, we are huge garlic fans. But, we are going away from breading more and more. We just didn't care for the breading. I think that we will make this next time with just the spices and garlic with olive oil instead of the egg and breadcrumbs.

Let chicken soak in the egg/garlic for 24 hours.  This is awesome.  A lot of coating though.  Could be cut in half.

Holy garlic! I'm a garlic lover, but I'd describe the chicken as "intense." The good news is I can set aside my fear of vampires this week. Great recipe, just tone down on the garlic by a couple of cloves.

This was OK.  I love garlic, but I might omit the garlic powder in the breadcrumb mixture, and just stick with the cloves used in the marinade.  It wasn't my favorite recipe for chicken, but not bad as a quick dish.  I would probably use the chicken in a salad next time as others suggested, rather than by itself.

This was pretty good.  I did modify the recipe per other suggestions.  I used more egg yolks because 1 didn't seem to be enough.  I used a little less fresh garlic than called for.  I halved the breading and still had about 1/2 cup left over.  I did not add the garlic powder.  I thought that would be WAY too potent!  Watch out vampires!  And I didn't think that it needed a whole Tablespoon of pepper and a half Tablespoon of salt.  I used teaspoons instead.  (I wondered if that was a misprint.)  Aside from the modifications, this recipe was pretty good.  Nothing to rave about, but worth making again someday.

This chicken was soooo good.  We love garlic but I decided to use 3 garlic cloves rather than 6.  I thought 6 TBSP of butter was a little much so I used 3.  Husband and kids loved it.

Very Garlicy, but the family loved it & I will make it again. i used 1 whole egg instead of just the yolk, and there seemed to be way too much bread crumbs. I will cut that part of the recipe in half next time.

This was good.  I used a ziplock bag to coat and instead of parsley, I used Italian seasoning.  Easy and enjoyable.

Delicious. We also cut back on the butter. We used chicken tenders instead of chicken breasts and served with a side of pasta. Will definitely make again.

I guess I'm one of the few people here that was not that impressed. The chicken was decent/good... but both my boyfriend and I agreed--- not that different from normal breaded chicken. We would have been just as happy. I followed the recipe to the tee. Will keep looking.

Very very moist and full of flavor. My family happens to love garlic. The crumb mixture really beats same old progresso breadcrumbs. Great mixture!! I followed another readers advice and used a few more egg yolks and will add a few more chicken breasts as well. I may also halve the crumb mixture. i wasted to much coating. Will definitely keep this one though.

Probably this recipe would have been good but it didn't say to cover the chicken and it came out very dry.  I made a note to cover the pan with foil next time.

This recipe was all right, but the garlic taste strong - too strong!  I don't use the term strong with garlic lightly, either - I LOVE garlic, but this was too much.  I won't make it again.  If I do, I'll use less than half the garlic called for.

I have always liked this easy to prepare, no frills chicken.  I do; however, throw the mix into a plastic bag to coat the chicken (excluding the bread crumbs) and then fry it in a deep fryer rather than baking it.

Yum.  Just the right amount of garlic, and I even used roasted garlic bread crumbs.  Definitely would make less crumb mixture--I made half and that was too much.  I pounded the chicken breast just a little to even out the thickness and 20 minutes cooking time on each side was perfect.  This recipe's nice because I usually have all the ingredients on hand.

Great recipe, thanks! Whole eggs can be used - not just egg yolks; and olive oil instead of butter. Also, I used bone-in skinless pieces - came out great, just increased cooking time by 20 min and flipped on the other side half way through. Will make it again.

Very garlicky, which I thought my husband and I would like, but it was almost overpowering.  Next time I won't marinade the chicken in the egg/garlic mixture but add garlic to the baking pan.  Also, next time I'll use olive oil instead of butter (and less of it) to reduce the fat content.  Otherwise the breading was delicious.

I'm surprised this is such a popular recipe - I thought it was okay, but not outstanding. Also the recipe makes too much of the breadcrumb mixture for dipping the chicken. I threw half of mine away.

Superb! My family loved this, it was easy to make, and I was so impressed by the flavor and tenderness of the chicken. My daugther said, "It's a keeper, Mom."

This is such a great way to make chicken. I used chopped garlic from the jar ( saves a lot of time, and just as flavorable as fresh) Everyone loved it. I can't believe how tender the chicken turned out. This is now a family favorite.

Tender inside, just enough crisp on the outside. Delicious w/ fresh lemon juice! Not over powering in garlic maybe b/c I used already minced garlic cloves from the fridge. I halved the recipe and still had lots of breading leftover as well... will quarter the amount next time.

The ingredients are fine, but quantities are out of whack! Way too much bread crumbs!  This recipe needs serious adjustment to deserve Hall of Fame stature.  I thought it funny that some reviewers thought there wasn't enough garlic and others thought there was too much.

Hall of Fame????  Why?  This was overly spiced--seemed like there should have been twice as much chicken for all the other ingredients.  This was just not very good.

This was super yummy! Made it last night for dinner and eating the leftovers today. I did not use quite as much garlic as it said and it was still plenty. Next time though...I would not use as much of the bread crumb mixture as I still had more than half a bowl left over. This one is definitely a keeper!

I tried this recipe with pork center cut and it turned out great.  The pork was tender and even my husband loved it... said it was a do over (He is not usually a pork lover).  Thanks so much for the recipe.  We will be trying it again with chicken soon.

This was an okay dish, but it may have been my fault. I used 1 tsp. of pepper (instead of a tbsp.) because we aren't big pepper fans. It tasted like it needed some salt mixed with the bread crumb mixture. Overall it was a little bland.

Easy and delicious! I used 4 yolks, double dipped in the breadcrumbs and baked for 45 mins. It's probably my oven but they came out a little darker than I would have liked. Next time I may lower the cooking temperature and cook a little longer. Will definitely add this one to my ever growing list of allrecipe regulars.

This recipe produced a very moist and tender yummy chicken dinner!  Although, I do agree with other reviewers that the breading tended to fall off the chicken.  Being a garlic lover, I expected more of a garlic flavor.  Overall though, it was quite good!

Tasty but basically average in my opinion.  It took my chicken about 45 minutes to cook through.  The chicken itself was moist but the breading seemed to come off in mushy clumps when I cut into it.  Not sure I will make it again.  Thanks for the recipe though!

Very good chicken recipe. I am not a huge chicken fan so this tasted really good. I would probably bake the chicken longer next time because they were still a bit pink and the crust wasn't as crunchy as I would have liked. Good Flavor!

Great - just be careful to not put on too much bread crumb coating. I think I went a little wild and it became a bit "crusty". But it was real good

This was a pretty good recipe. It looks really nice when it's complete. It was weird using just the egg yolk because I certainly didn't have any leftovers to pour over the chicken, but it was still good:)

This recipe was very good, and fairly easy to make.  The recipe calls for way too much breading.  Next time, I will cut the breading ingredients in half.  
I thought the finished product tasted like a chicken scampi.

I was a bit sceptical about baking the breaded chicken instead of frying it but this recipe proved me 150% wrong. An amazing, rich, yet easy recipe. The chicken was soft and succulent, the coating crisp and golden. I have made a few changes to it though: instead of bread crumbs I used cracker crumbs, instead of dry parsley fresh finely chopped parsley because I had no dry variety at hand, and I also added a good pinch of cayene pepper to the crumb mixture. It was absolutely sublime. I served it with buttered macaroni and red sauce and not a 'crumb' was left. Thank you Amy this is a real gem!!!

My husband can't stand garlic so I had to make this in the afternoon and air out the house before he got home.  I will definitely sneak around to make this recipe again :-) Also will do the marinating in a zip-lock bag to hide the smell in the refrigerator!!!  I used Italian bread crumbs so cut back on the salt and garlic powder.  My sons and I thought these were the best, most tender chicken breasts we've ever had.
Thank you!!

This dish got rave reviews from my whole family.  My son was half finished with his meal and asked when I would be making it again.  I made hot buttered noodles with parmesan and fresh steamed broccoli to go along with this dish. The only thing I would do different is probably half the coating. There was way too much and I had to toss the rest of it because of dipping it in raw egg. Two thumbs up on taste and presentation!  Thanks Amy!!

This was just OK.  There definitely was way to much breading, and I used a little less butter than it called for.

This was very good.  I butterfly my chicken because it seems to be so thick.  Therefore, I doubled the breading.  That was totally not necessary.  I had a LOT left over.  I fit 5 pieces into the baking dish and I pan fried the other three.  The panfried pieces were good, but they tasted a bit more salty.

i made this last night and i have to say that it was ok.1 egg yoke is not enough the bread crumbs you need to cut in half.the chicken was very moist and everyone liked it.Idon't think there was an over kill with garlic like some people said.My chicken breading did not get very brown or crunchy,the breading was kind of soggy.All in all i thought it was just ok.I will make it again though.

This was an awesome recipe! I used 2 egg yolks and marinated overnight and added a dash of onion salt.  I had used chicken nuggets instead of breast and I think I may have overcooked a bit by baking 15 min on each side. Next time I'll cut it down to 10 minutes on each side for nuggets. Even so, the chicken came up moist and tasty!!! My kids kept asking for more. Definitely better than the shake and bake recipe! Thanks for sharing, Amy!

I didnt expect this to be so good after all I've marinated the chicken for 30+ hrs. I totally forgot about it. I had cut up the chicken in bite sizes, it came out sooo tender. Definitely make it again!

This was the most tender chicken I have ever had!  I used tenderloins instead of
breasts but that was just what I had in the fridge.  This recipe has the perfect
seasonings.  Best chicken I ever made!

Great recipe, no leftovers. FYI I doubled the recipe and still had half the dry ingredients left over.  Also, I used about 5 TBs of butter (though I had doubled the recipe) and it was still very delicious.  Will definitely make it again.

I had to use double the egg yolk but other than that it was great.  I expected the breading to be a little more crispy but it was still good.  Overall I would say it was a good recipe and I would make it again.

This is pretty good if it weren't so over garlicky,even for this garlic lover! The crust is delicious,but next time i plan on using 2/3 LESS garlic.

Thanks Amy...my six year old son told me no less than four times how great this was and asked for seconds, and thirds (pretty un-heard of).  He also told me good cooking mom.  I will definitely make this again.

This is a great recipe and soooooo easy to whip up.  I added extra garlic as well as the whole egg and let it marinade for the day.  I've made it twice and served it with rice and a salad.

This was very yummy.  I cooked it for 15 minutes longer, because I expected the chicken to brown more.  The breading didn't stick as well as I would have liked.  Overall, the flavor was great, and I served it with pasta--turned out fantastic.

Amy!! This recipe was so easy.  I left the chicken in the egg mixture for about 24 hours and I can not believe how tender and juicy the chicken was.  My Dad, husband, and 2 year old loved it! Great job!

I thought this was very easy and tasty. I used seasoned bread crumbs and minced garlic in the jar. I also used fresh grated parmesan. I only used a pinch of salt. The parmesan is much coarser when grated fresh so when cooking was done I grated some more and placed on top. I thought this was GREAT!!!!!

After reading some reviews I decided to perk up my chicken by adding some hot sauce to the marinade.  The chicken was tasty and moist, but still a little boring for my liking, even with a little spice.  Next time I will use the chicken in a pasta dish instead of by itself.

I made this chicken for a Valentine's Dinner. I did not make it prior to the dinner which served 40 people. It was an outstanding success. Very moist, tender and flavorful. I used jarred minced garlic and Italian bread crumbs which really simplified the recipe. Absolutely delicious!!!

hmmmmmm..hmmmmm GOOD!!!!  I know that I'm not adding anything new to the reviews... but I don't care!! This was FABULOUS!!!  I made this for dinner for my fiance' one evening, the next day I came home with my mouth watering for the leftovers and he ate all of it!!!  I was more than a little upset, but at the same time I was smiling on the inside because I knew that meant he loved it!!  On my own I can screw up a bowl of cereal but with you Amy, I'm a five-star chef!!  Thanks

Great recipe, although I'm not sure how 1 egg yolk was supposed to provide enough liquid to make the marinade.  I ended up using 3 yolks.  Overall very good though.

This was THE BEST chicken EVER!  My husband went nuts when he tried it, he said it was the best thing I've ever made.  I used italian bread crumbs and didn't use parsley (didn't have any).
Thanks Amy, for this awesome recepie!

My husband absolutely loved this dish.  My 5 year old and 8 year old kept asking for more, as well.  I may even cook this for my husband's mom one day and I never have the courage to cook for her picky taste.  Thanks for this great recipe!

I made this the other night after marinating the chicken for 24hrs. Excellent!  The garlic flavor really permeated through the entire piece of chicken.  My husband loved it!  Thanks Amy.

I made this when I was in a pinch for dinner, and it was good for what I needed it for.  It was quick, easy, but I think it was a bit boring.  But I found this recipe on the 30 minutes or less area, so if I'm in a pinch, I'll definately make it again.  It's versatile, so I suggest playing with it.

My husband and 2yr old LOVED it.(So did I) I agree about the 1 Tbsp. salt being too much, but that's the only adjustment.  The breading was alot, but I used it all.  I will definately make this again and again.

Overall, this is a great recipe!!!  The only flaw i found was it was too salty.  Cooks quick and tastes great.  I served mine over a bed of rice and topped it with fresh pinapple chunks!! Yummy.

I  didn't have a kid around to try it, but the adults loved it.  It was delicious and very different.  My only comment would be that, in doubling the recipe on the computer, it gave me enough breading mix for about five recipes.  But that's okay because it was a recipe that I will use again.

Very good flavor - I marinated for about 30 hours and depending on your taste that may be a little long - The garlic flavor was pretty strong - which we like but others......  I will make this one again

The chicken was moist and flavorful, almost too flavorful.  Next time I would cut down on the garlic.  We are all garlic lovers, however, felt it was much too much.  Would be nice with a "sweet" type veggie.

This recipe was okay. I love garlic, but I wouldn't make this again. It would be better if the breading would turn out a bit more crispy!

I wasn't sure if the picky boyfriend would like this but just the aroma of the deeply marinated meat going into the baking dish had his eyes excited and his mouth watering. I marinated it about 24 hours but think that even an hour or two would still be aromatic and delicious. Definitely recommend if you like garlic!!

Yummy yummy! This chicken is tender and VERY flavorful! There was leftover breading as other reviewers had mentioned, but I sprinkled it on during the turning process and there wasn't too much wasted. I also used fresh parsley instead of dry. DELICIOUS!

I did the overnight thing, and it turned out great, but I had alot of coating left so the next night I just coated with egg and used the left over coating, no over night. I was just as good.

Easy to make, but alot of extra breading....so I added more breading to chicken after I flipped it. Very good flavor, plenty of garlic!!! Chicken was tender and juicy. I will make this one again.

It was good but a little too salty. I had it scaled down to make 4 servings and I think the salt should be a bit less. Otherwise, I loved. Will make again.

Other than remembering to marinade this the night before, this was very easy to prepare.  My kids and I absolutely loved it.  It's the juiciest and most flavorful I've had chicken breasts in a while.  I sprinkled more breading on top before baking and after turning.  And you can cut the breading and still have plenty.  I will definitely serve this for company!

I also decided to try this recipe due to the overwhelming response it has received.  I served it with new potatoes and fresh steamed broccoli.  It was decent, but I hate to say this:  not much better than shake n' bake!  If you like garlic, but are used to fairly bland cuisine, this recipe is for you.

Sorry, I must be missing something.  Couldn't wait to try this after reading the rave reviews.  My sister and brother-in-law stopped over on short notice and I already had this in the oven.  We couldn't believe how good it smelled and could hardly wait to dig in.  Made real mashed potatos, steamed green beans, garlic bread and a beautiful salad to accompany the meal.  What a disappointment.  I mean it was ok....but nothing to write home about.  Of the four of us, no one voted to make this one again.

Good stuff... although next time I will use less ingredients on what you coat it with (bread crumbs, parmesean cheese, etc.) due to the fact that you throw most of it away after you coat the chicken. Overall it's a great recipe and had good flavor!!! Give this one a try for sure!

This recipe was great.  I only used about half of the recommended garlic in the egg yolk marinade and I used Italian bread crumbs instead of adding dried parsley to plain bread crumbs and did not use garlic powder in the bread crumbs.  My friends loved this!  They all asked for the recipe.  It was a major hit.  The chicken came out tender and juicy and so flavorful.

This was awesome! I even managed to get a complement from my dad (the house chef)! Everyone loved it and it was simple to make. Just remember to leave time to marinade! Also, don't know if it was just me, but when I scaled up the recipe(6), I had to add an extra egg yolk to coat all the chicken. Thanks a bunch Amy! This one's a keeper.

My fiance and I really enjoyed this.  The only thing that took any time was marinade.  I sprinkled the extra cheese and crumb mixture after I flipped it, this made it extra good.

This may be the best recipe I've found on this site so far.  So incredibly easy, tastes GREAT, and even LOOKS like you are the best cook in the world. It even impressed my mother! :o)  Thanks Amy!!

excellent!  don't forget to only use 1/4 cup of bread crumbs or so, and when u do so, be sure to lessen the amount of salt and pepper as well.  i forgot and the seasoning was a little too salty/spicy.  won't make that mistake again and will be making this dish over and over (God willing).  the kids gobbled it up with mashed potatoes and baby carrots!

This is a wonderful dish...my husband and I both love garlic. I did make a few changes: used "I can't believe it's not butter" spray in place of butter and used egg beaters. I also reduced the bread crumbs and parmesan cheese (nonfat) to 3/4 cup each and reduced seasonings accordingly. I still ended up with extra breading mixture. I also used minced garlic instead of fresh in the marinade. I'm adding this one to my recipe collection!

Tried this recipe out at a family dinner and it was a big hit.  Took about twice as long to cook however (dinner ended-up quite late), the breading part was 3x too much, and overall a wee bit on the salty side.  Made the recipe again with no salt added to the breading, less breading, the whole egg in the marinade, and more garlic.  Still turned out great -- recipe seems pretty fool proof... perhaps next time I'll try with unsalted butter too....

I thought it was a bit spicy. Really no different from a breaded / Parmesian chicken w/o cheese. Needed mozarella cheese or marinara sauce, though. I thought it was a bit dry.

This kind-of tastes like really great Shake-n-Bake.  The crispy crust keeps the chicken moist and tender, and it's great served with mashed potatoes.  I'll definitely make this one again!

This was really good.  I actually marinated for 2 days.  I cut down the bread crumbs a little.  What I might do in the future is save some of the melted butter to pour over after I turn the cutlets.  Everyone loved this.

We only marinated for about two hours and it was delicious!  I would make 1/2 of the bread crumbs...even a 1/4 would do.  There is a lot of garlic so cut some quite large so you can pick it off if you like (but I love it all!)

I loved this dish.  For the crumb mixture, I mixed all the dry ingredients up first, then I added the melted butter.  I used a spatula to spread the mixture onto the marinated chicken so that I wouldn't have so much bread crumb mixture left over this time.  I've already made this recipe twice this week.

This was so easy- I made this for a birthday party and everyone loved it- even the kids. My kids loved it, which they are becoming very picky about certain foods. I like the fact that it was somewhat different than the "usual party " food and was fairly easy to make!!

this was absolutly wonderful.  i used seasoned crutons instead of bread crumbs and added the extra breading on top of the chicken after it was placed in the pan and also after i flipped it.

Great recipe for a variation on chicken. My husband says "it tastes like garlic bread" and asked for more......no leftovers here.
Thanks......Sue, CT

A bit dis-appointed.  With all the other glowing reviews, I expected a WOW recipe,
but my husband & I thought it was, well...just...ok.  Way too much bread crumb
mixture left over.
