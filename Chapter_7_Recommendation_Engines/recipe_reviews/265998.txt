Very good and easy. I added an extra can of bean, extra spices and no ketchup. Will make again. Grandkids and husband enjoyed. Served with sour cream and cheese.

I made it last night for dinner. We liked it, but reduced the spices by half. We do not like really spiced food. I also used fresh tomatoes as I have so many. Just removed the skins then chopped them. Worked great in place of canned tomatoes.
