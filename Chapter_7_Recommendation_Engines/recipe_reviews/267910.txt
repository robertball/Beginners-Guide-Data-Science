So good using the original directions with only a slight modification. I used cream, as I do for all my cooking, in place of milk. I also added approx. 1/2 t vanilla. I didn't really measure / weigh the berries, but had them cover the bottom of the pan. The family, young and old, all loved this as a dessert, still warm, along with ice cream. We will be making this again, trying other fresh, soft seasonal fruit.
