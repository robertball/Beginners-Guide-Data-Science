Good recipe. Made a few changes.  Used a pre-baked whole wheat pizza crust to save time. Used ground turkey and cooked the onions with the meat, also added a little garlic to the meat mixture.  My family loved it.

I just used a refrigerated Pillsbury pizza crust for this which worked fine.  I omitted the dill pickle slices (boyfriend hates pickles) and the pizza looked good.  He didn't care for the mustard taste so I think I will omit it next time.  Other than that, good!
