Very good...I loved the green chilis and spices in the beans.  Next time I will use more avocados & salsa.  A big hit at the birthday party I brought it to.

This was really good but to cut down on some of the fat, I used low fat sour cream and left out the mayonnaise. I will continue to make it this way.

I did not have Lime juice like I thought I had.  So I ended up making this without lime.  It is a 5 star without it, but with it it would be a 6 star.  I did us the store made fresh salsa, so I did not add onions since there is plenty in the salsa.  CUMIN and Green chilis in the beans give this a good zip!  Thanks for sharing.  (Hubby is still in the kitchen raving about this dip.)

Excellent! Although I made some modifications. In the bean layer, I left out the peppers, and added a 1/4 c. or so of chili sauce, and some extra chili pwdr and cumin. For the guac layer, I used only 2 avacados, which was plenty.  I added some chunky salsa to the guac as well. I added a ~1/2 pkg of taco seasoning to the sour cream layer for some color and a kick of flavor. I don't like olives, so I drained a can of black beans and put about 1/2 on top for garnish. Overall, it was a BIG hit and everyone loved the flavors!

This is always a big hit! Instead of using the salsa, I substituted the salsa with a few diced tomatoes.  I took this to a few BBQ's and it was completely gone within 1 hour!  Everyone loved it!

This is a great recipe, I love the idea of adding the adding lime juice & spices to the beans.  So often that bean layer is dense & bland. I wasn't sure about the sour cream & mayo mixture, but it tasted great. I made this for my halloween party and it was a big hit!

I halved the green chiles in the beans and only used about 1 cup of the sourcream mixture.  Everyone loved it.  Will definitely make again.

I made this as written except I sub'd lemon juice for lime juice.  This was a really great 7-layer... I've made diff. 7 layer recipes before but for some reason this was the best.  I took this out of the fridge about 3 hours before serving and I was very pleased with the room-temp textures and flavors.

I didn't have beans when I went to make this, but I did have a bunch of leftover taco meat.  I used it instead of the bean layer, and my son and husband won't eat it any other way now!

This was incredible!  That's all I have to say, after giving it 5 stars I guess.  My only comment would be try REALLY hard to make fresh guacamole for that layer, rather than buying it already prepared.  The taste is tremendously different and 10x better!

Great tasting dish - although prep time was longer than I expected to get this all mixed and layered..    I used more of a pico de gallo than actual salsa.. had more of a kick with the onions and spices.   Funny story, I brought it to a fellowship dinner at Church and someone warmed it by mistake. It was actually good. A few who were not familiar with the recipie were surprised it was served cold. I guess a great variation would be to switch the layers so it could be heated up ?.. maybe put the sour cream and mayo mix on top with garnish.   I think I am actually going to try that next time.

I have made this dip once before and I didn't have ripe avocados, so I just omitted that layer from the dip. It was still delicious.  I am making it tonight again, and am going to try it with the avocados this time. Easy and quick to make!

Loved this dip!  Took it to a party and got rave reviews.  I added a little garlic and fresh cilantro to the guacamole layer.  And since I didn't have the pepper jack cheese, I added a little taco seasoning to sour cream/mayo mixture.  Good stuff!

This is the best seven layer dip I have tried.  It is excellent and I didn't change one thing.  I have made it several times for parties (I always double the recipe) and eveyone loves it.  Thanks so much.

This is great. The avocado doesn't brown if you add extra lime juice and sandwich it between the other layers! It's better if it sits overnight!
I thought the bean layer was way too thick. Too many beans! I will cut back in the future! Otherwise a great dip that feeds a crowd! Thanks!

Made it for a BBQ yesterday and literally every single person there complimented me on it. Omitted cumin as i do not like it. Added taco seasoning to the white layer, so did not use salt in the other layers. I had made Salsa II previously, so used that as my salsa layer but increased to 2 C to cover. also used 2 C Mexican blend shredded cheese, a large can sliced olives (might do chopped next time), and two whole green onions :)

I LOVED this dip. I made a few changes, but it's wonderful! I used a 7x11 dish and I added a layer of taco-flavored soy crumbles after the beans. I also left out the scallions because I don't like them. I heated it in the oven before adding the sour cream to the top and it was delicious warm!!! I will make this dip often!

Vegan-ized this recipe by subbing in soy alternatives for the sour cream, mayo, and pepper Jack.  All in all a pretty good dip, but not the best my partner and I have sampled.  I think it may have been the lime juice, because when I sampled the guacamole part I thought it was a little ... oddly flavored.  Despite that, I really liked the flavor on the bean mixture layer.  It didn't seem like there were enough black olives and scallions; it was more like a treat when you got one, rather than part of the dip as a whole.  If you're making the recipe as listed, the part about a deep dish 9 inch pan is no joke.  I used a normal 9 inch pie plate and the dip was near to spilling out over the sides.

I made this for a football party and got rave reviews! I added a clove of minced garlic, choped cilantro and some fresh ground pepper to the guacamole which gave it added flavor. I topped it off with cilantro, sliced black olives and green onions. Great recipe, will use again!

I never used avacado's before, it would have been extremely helpful had it stated: Ripe avacado's...fooey.

Excellent and easy.  I made it exactly according to the directions, but you could vary it by adding basically any ingredient that is used in Tex-Mex dishes.  Thanks for the easy crowd pleaser!

This recipe is a hit everywhere I go!  I made it for a baby shower and just friends coming over and it is the best! I substituted Mexican cheese for the pepper jack so you can put your own spin on it if you want to.

This was AMAZING!!!! Best dip I've ever made - It was a hit at the dance club! I thought at first that adding so much lime to the beans and guacamole would not work, but it was amazing! Also, I made one change to the recipe, instead of adding mayo to the sour cream, I used 8 oz. cream cheese.  Thanks for sharing!

I followed the recipe to a T, so I don't know what went wrong. Some of the guests liked it, but I and others did not care for it. I will not be using this recipe again.

Even better than "regular" seven layer dip - the lime adds really good flavor.  I use 2tsp cumin in addition to the 2tsp chili powder in the beans.  Also, I just buy the refried beans that already have green chiles in them.  I use reduced fat everything, including 50% RF Cabot Jalapeno Cheddar, which I think makes the recipe.

Easy to make and very tasty.  If you are running low on time premade guacamole work well for that layer.
