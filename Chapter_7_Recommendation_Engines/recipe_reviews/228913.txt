Have made this twice, omitting the almonds to cut calories.  Delicious sweet salad!

Very refreshing! I made it with half the sugar and added shredded carrots. It was a little acidic. I will reduce the vinegar next time. I think using fresh oranges would also be good and you could increase the amount of toasted almonds.

Made this salad for our Super Bowl party last weekend. It was a group favorite. I only changed the recipe by substituting roasted almonds with caramelized almonds.

The key to this salad is the mixture of the bitter greens, the sweet oranges and the crunchy almonds...simple & delicious.  The dressing is good, but I just use a little balsamic vinegar and olive oil.

Very acidic. Instead of sugar used some of the drained mandarin orange juice and a squirt of honey, also a little more oil. Added cranberries and sweet onion.
