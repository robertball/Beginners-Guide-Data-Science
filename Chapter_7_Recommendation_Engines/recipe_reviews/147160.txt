It was much better the next day as a cold pasta salad. Also, I would double or triple the number of bay scallops.

This dish is so tasty - something you would order at a very good restaurant. I followed the recipe almost exactly with superb results. And so easy! The soba noodles I found (had to go to a Korean grocery) called for cooking only 30 seconds, so I ended up over-cooking mine, but they still tasted great. The buckwheat flavor goes perfectly with the peppers and tomatoes ... add in the scallops, and wowsa! Highly recommended - I will make it again, and probably for company.

for sure double scallops.
have to love strong olives and bell pepper to enjoy this recipe.  was too overpowering for us.  Go by recipe on noodle bag for how long to cook.

This recipe is fantastic!  I didn't think that Dijon, tomatoes, peppers and kalamatas would go good together but I was very pleasantly surprised!  I didn't have any scallops and was trying to use what I had in the house instead of shop so I used some salmon I had and it was terrific and I'm not a huge salmon fan.  Great recipe! thanks!

This sauce was fantastic! I used green olives and shrimp instead of kalamata and scallops. The combination of the tomatoes, olives, basil and dijon mustard was really dynamite. The buckwheat noodles didn't add much to the dish. I'd use this sauce recipe again, perhaps over other types of pasta or with chicken breast instead of seafood.
