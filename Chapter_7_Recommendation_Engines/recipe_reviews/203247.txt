Great recipe, perfect with coffee! When I add a splash of milk (the original dough recipe is a little dry), I also add a teaspoon of cocoa.

Great biscotti, although I think its more of a Mocha biscotti than a double chocolate.  The only negative for me is that the dough is very prone to crumbling.  (I am an avid Biscotti baker and this is not something that usually happens for me) the dough itself was really crumbly when it came to making the logs, so I did knead it a little like I would a loaf of bread, which made it a little better.    Once the logs came out of the oven and I let cool for 10 minutes I did have a few crumble on me.  As always I bake the first time on wax paper.  Over all a good biscotti, pity about the crumbling! I will play around a little with this recipe next time, maybe more vanilla will keep it together better.

Good Chocolate flavor, but crumble.  We'll stick with our regular chocolate biscotti recipe that it much better in texture.

I liked this, and thought it very good.  I omited the pecans, and forgot to paste on the yolk-water mixture.  Not sure if that made a difference or not, but I also didn't have enough regualar cocoa powder, so I put in some dark powder.  It was really good that way.  I can see how some thought of it tasting more mocha than chocolate, but I saw a hint of that, but mostly chocolate.  2 thumbs up!

Really good.  I didn't have walnuts so I substituted pecans, worked out just as well.  Will be making these again.

I love biscotti and this recipe filled my desires of chocolate and biscotti at the same time! Great recipe I added a little more sugar because I have a huge sweet tooth, but you can add or remove sugar as you please. I found that this recipe was devoured in under 1 hour.

This is a great recipe for biscotti.  My family does not like the anise flavour in traditional biscotti, so this was a big hit.  Mine crumbled a bit as well, but just a few pieces.  Also - I substituted slivered almonds in place of the walnuts, and I didn't have any instant coffee granules, so those are optional as well.

Pay close attention to baking times! I let mine go to long and they got crumbly.  Not to much of a chocolate flavor, more of a mocha.

These were just ok. They wasn't really anything wrong with them, they just didn't have a great chocolate flavor.

this got 3 stars as a biscotti, but it could probably get 4.5 as an ice cream topping. the dough was completely dry and half of it shattered when i tried to slice it! i ended up with a dozen biscotti and two cups of crumbs:(

This was a great recipe! So easy to make. I too used about an ounce and a half strong coffee instead of instant granules, and it made the dough PERFECT consistency. It was a BIT crumbly at the end, but not too bad at all! Oh, and instead of walnuts, I used dried cranberries which were amazing. I will definitely make this recipe over & over - I already have plans to make a batch as a gift for friends.

Loved these!  This was the first time I made biscotti -- it was so easy.  I did notice that the dough was quite stiff and dry at the end.  I used 1 to 2 ounces of cold coffee instead of the granules.  This may have added enough liquid to prevent the crumbling that others mentioned.  I also added a few shakes of cayenne to compliment the cinnamon.  It was enough to add a tingle of heat without being overt.  I would have put in almonds if I had had them, but I found I really liked the walnuts.  Will certain make again.

I was expecting something more chocolatey with this name.  It was good, but not outstanding.

After reading reviews I cut butter in half and subbed crisco for the other half. This made quite a difference in texture.  I also doubled the cinnamon and added dried cranberries. Next tome would love to try with dried tart cherries.

This recipe tastes great, but I had trouble with lots of crumbles and biscotti pieces breaking off.
