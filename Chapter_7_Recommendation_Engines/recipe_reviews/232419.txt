Great , east, quick recipe to make.My kids and wife LOVE it. The taste is similar to a restaurant we ate in Clearwater Florida (My Little Greek).

For those not use to the nice, strong lemony zest, the flavor can be overpowering. But you can try using half a lemon at first until the flavor is to your taste.

Also, Be mindful of the volume. The recipe is enough to do a big 8 quart pot. So you may need to cut in 1/2 the measurements.  Love this! Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I liked it a lot. I'd definitely make it again.

Just made this. Used a 1/2 recipe (it still made quite a bit). Made some changes based on what I had: chicken bouillon cubes, omitted the chicken chunks, added ~1.25c egg noodles at the end. I liked it a lot. I forgot to cut the rice in half (so I used 1.5c of half jasmine & half uncle bens). It came out thick, kind of like a watery clam chowder (not in a bad way). The flavors are really good. The lemon is fresh and nice. Maybe add lemon zest too? Might be overpowering. Thanks for the recipe.

I cut the recipe into half. This is an amazing recipe and tastes just as good or better than the restaurants in the Detroit metro area. Very easy to make. Adjust lemon to my personal tastes.

I made this soup exactly as directed. It is so yummy. I fell in love with this soup at a neighborhood restaurant. I found this recipe and it tastes exactly like the restaurant version. My husband loves it too. I will make this soup frequently.  We enjoy it for dinner with a piece of crusty bread.

The lemon is over powering and without it would be bland. I'm not a fan, but it sure was easy!

Very easy and tasty. Reminds me of Greek lemon chicken soup. I did use orzo pasta instead of rice, and halved the recipe.
