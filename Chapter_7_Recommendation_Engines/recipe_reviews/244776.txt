We LOVED this dish!  It took some time but it was fun to make and I finally got to use my new LeCreuset Dutch oven that I got for Mother's Day.  If you have some time on your hands and feel like trying something new, this is the perfect dish!

I followed the recipe exactly, and it came out very good. I have to say that this is a time consuming recipe. If you want to eat at 7 pm, start the process around 2. I really liked the flavor, but due to the time involved, I wonâ€™t be cooking this meal for a while again.

This recipe was time consuming, I would call it a total of two and a half hours from start to finish but the results were very good.  I particularly like the dried mushrooms in the dish, this was the first time I had seen this in a Coq au Vin recipe and they were a great addition.  Thanks for the great recipe!
