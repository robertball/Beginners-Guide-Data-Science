My family LOVED these! My kids devoured them. So quick and easy to prepare. This will be a new weeknight go-to for us. 
I purchased stir-fry beef that was already sliced. I used a cast iron skillet, adding the beef right  when it reached smoking hot. We lined the pitas with hummus, as suggested, and our optional stuffings were:  
lettuce, red onion, cucumber (English/seedless/burpless), tomato (grape tomatoes), Greek olives (kalamata), and feta cheese.
My son doesn't like pitas so he used a spinach wrap. All happy :) Note: I'll try adding roasted red bell pepper next time. I didn't have any on-hand.

Really simple, good and different. I'm not a fan of humus but I spread a thin layer inside the pita and added the goods!

I also used pre-sliced stir fry beef. Made some with tzatziki sauce and some with ranch topped with avocado and shredded cheddar. Both options were delicious.

very yummy and easy. Reheated it for the second meal we got out of it,  and it was still good.

I added tomatoes and cucumbers inside without adding the onions. I marinated the steak with soy sauce, minced garlic and lemon pepper.
