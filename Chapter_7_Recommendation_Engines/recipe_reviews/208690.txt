I think I used too many olives for my own taste, but I loved the avocado with the chicken. It was a nice change from the usual chicken, and I will make it again.

Holy cow, what an explosion of flavor! This is one of the most flavor-packed meals we've ever had. I didn't have any tomatoes, so I used some canned diced tomato and it was fine. We also didn't have any olives (unnecessary in my opinion, would have been too salty with them) or fresh basil, so I let ~1 Tbsp dried crushed basil "marinate" in the lemon juice / water / olive oil mixture for about an hour. It was fantastic!

We had some leftover chicken, so I made only the tapenade to toss over it.  Delicious!  Simple enough to remember, too.  I would definitely make this again.

I made this for my mother's birthday because it was something that sounded nice and was on everyone's diet!  It took me a  little longer to make.  I think it is because I was using some ingredients I wasn't used to.  I also used only one lemon and still found the lemon taste overpowering.  Still, worthwhile to make again.

This was good. Ours was pan-fried, and instead of green pimento olives, I used black olives...personal preference. For most flavour, do use the roasted garlic for the tapenade. The chicken breasts were thick, so I butterfly cut them to be sure they cooked through...the marinade helped keep them moist, even going the full five minutes per side. I served this with rice and an onion/mushroom saute'd concoction, but I think something else (but what?) would make a better side for this. Rice was good, but the onion/mushroom scramble missed it. My bad.

Great summer recipe! It was very yummy. I added one chopped jalape√±o and half of a red onion. It added a little kick.

OK, so the allergies have me so stuffed up that I cannot taste this, and I'm so devastated, because I'm sure I will love it, once my sense of smell returns.  I had rave reviews, from people who hate green olives...so, I'm sure it was fantastic.  Can't wait to get rid of the pollen so I can really taste it...but then again, I've never met a mediterranean dish I didn't love.  I didn't put the effort into smashing the garlic, and sadly, didn't have any fresh basil, so I subbed...and I hate black pepper so I left it out...but nobody seemed to miss any of these things, so save some effort.  Kudos for a super easy, healthy, yummy recipe!

I added lime and lemon juice and a lot of lime zest.  I am veggie, but my husband loved it and so did my 3 yr. old!  Thanks.
