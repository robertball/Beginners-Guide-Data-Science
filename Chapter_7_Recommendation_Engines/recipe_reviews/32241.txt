I had a similar cocktail called the "Violet Beauregarde" at an upscale restaurant.  This is just as good, and so simple if you can stand the wait.  I used frozen blueberries the second time I made this, and not only was it more convenient, but the result was a lovlier shade of violet (hehe) and had a more distinct blueberry flavor.  Great recipe.

After waiting 2 weeks for the blueberries to soak into the vodka, we finally got to taste the martinis tonight. They are excellent and were worth the wait!!!! Now I'm going to make a blueberry pound cake with the left over bluberries!

If you have those little corn cob holders, they are good for making pricks in the berries.  I just stab as many as the cob holder will hold while they are in the colander, and slide them off into the bottle-this makes the stabbing process alot quicker.

Maybe it's not the fault of the recipe.  Perhaps it's just my preference for a good old regular vodka martini with an olive, but I wasn't wild about my blueberry martini.  So I'm thinking, "great, now what to do with this bottle of blueberry flavored vodka".  I decided to try 2 shots of the vodka with some tonic water over ice and it was a pretty wonderful summer drink!
I was thinking about making blueberry muffins with the blueberries that were soaked with vodka until I bit into one.  Yikes!  Makes for a nice garnish though in my Blueberry Vodka Tonic drink.

Mmmmm...(sip)....really good....(sip)...there's definitely a kick to this drink....(sip)....probably shouldn't drink the whole thing while typing this review....(sip)....if you like not-too-sweet drinks, this one is definitely worth trying.  It tastes even better after writing this review!

MMMMMM...
If you DO like sweeter drinks, try adding equal parts sour mix to the infused vodka in addition to the 1 part rasberry...sweeter, tangier (is that a word?)  YUM.

I like to use Stoli Blueberi - absolute best! I actually prefer it to the self infused - no cough syrup effect. Also use more lime juice and some simple syrup (experiment to taste).  Dekuyper  makes a blueberry liquor and I use a splash of that instead of the raspberry. I'm getting thirsty....gotta go!

YUMMMMMM!  Beware though, it packs a punch!  I didn't have time to brew my own blueberry vodka (although I'll try that in the future) but used Smirnoff Blueberry infused vodka instead.  Added fresh blueberries on a toothpick for garnish which were delish after sipping all of the cocktail!

The best blueberry vodka. I mix it with lemonade and is so refreshing. I can't wait for bleberries to come in season again. Also try other berries. Just follow the directions but try raspberry for a wonderful flavored vodka. Much better then the flavored vodkas you  buy in the store

Delicious. I tucked the bottle into the back of the cupboard for about 2 weeks and the results were amazing. 2 parts of the finished blueberry vodka to 1 part of raspberry liquor, with a hint of lime, shaken with ice...refreshing and delicious.

One tip, don't eat the blueberries after they've soaked in the vodka. They're kind of bitter at that point. All the goodness has gone into the vodka.

I made this for my Dad for Christmas. It came out great. It tasted good and was a very pretty color. I used the frozen berries. It's hard to find fresh at Christmas. The frozen add a better color and diffuse quicker.

Love the blueberry vodka.  Thought the raspberry liqueur overpowered the vodka and made it too sweet.  I substitued raspberry vodka for the liqueur and it was awesome.  Also will put in a good spash of not only the recommended lime juice, but sometimes lemon or pomegranate or a combination to change it up and they all work.

Thanks for the recipe!

This was very good, but not good enough to wait two weeks for. I like the color very much, but since I like to mix my blueberry vodka with a bit of sweet and sour mix and lime, I think regular vodka is good enough. One note, I started with Smirnoff blueberry vodka so the blueberry flavor would be quite strong. I would make again if I wanted something pretty to serve at a party. Watch out for those blueberries that have soaked! Woo, what a kick. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this and WOW!  It turned out GREAT!  Used 100% vodka, and it is pretty potent but gooood!  To make it less potent (making it not a martini anymore), I tried ginger ale, and it was so good, I am going to drink it like that from now on!  Thanks for the recipe!

I make something similar to this using a wild berry schnapps instead of the raspberry liquor.  Never thought of putting a splash of lime in though - must try that next time.  Delish!

These came out great. I made them last summer when I got fresh blueberries in my CSA share. I just made another batch last week to take to a bachlorette party. I expect them to be the hit of the party :-)

This is a fun recipe and worth the wait!  The resulting martini is to be savored not only for it's delicious flavor but for it's gorgeous sultry color.  I made two batches of these this summer and will make them again when fresh blueberries are in season.  Make sure to use raspberry liqueur.  I tried blackberry liqueur the first time and the taste wasn't right.  I made poundcake with the vodka-soaked blueberries which was tasty although the berries didn't pop with juice.
