Delicious. A student gave me a jar of the mix for Christmas, and it sat in my cupboard more that two years (waiting for a special occasion, I guess). The cookies were still delicious, which is why I looked up the recipe. Thanks.

This makes a very delicious cookie! Friends who received the jar for a gift gave very positive feedback. Even non-coconut eaters like it. In my own batch I substituted dried cranberries for the raisins for a Christmas-y twist. Yummy!

These cookies were such a hit with my family and friends!  I didn't put the recipe in a jar but made them as you would a traditional cookie by creaming the butters and sugars together (I added 1 tsp of vanilla as well) and then mixing in the dry ingredients.  I replaced the raisins with craisins and added 1/2 a bag of white chips that I had in my pantry.  I would definitely make these again...they were excellent!

I've gotten raves for these cookies. The only difficult part was getting it all into the jar. You have to really press all the ingredients down.

I'm not having any luck with cookies today!  I followed this recipe exactly and they turned out paper thin and crumbly.  I personally think they need more flour, but don't feel like experimenting and wasting all the ingredients to find out.  My batch is going to the birds tomorrow. Sorry!

the cookie is very good but it was impossible to get all the ingredients in the jar. I  had to put the flour mixture in a small snack bag. I tamped the ingredients as well as I could. I am not a beginner cook and was very disappointed in the results.

Well these look fab, im going to make some for a gift for Christmas which i will present in pretty box, i also like the idea that another reviewer has done and added white chips to them, i will add milk or dark chocolate chips as the person im giving them to isn't too keen on white chocolate. I think milk or dark choc will also work fine.

I packed the jar, then baked it immediately to test for gift-worthiness.  The fit in the jar is (as mentioned) *very* tight.  I added 2 Tbs. powedered eggs, and had about 1.5 Tbs flour mix left over - so about 1/2 Tbs of wiggle room.  I made some tweaks:  The aforementioned powdered eggs, from Honeyville Grain, to cut the amount of stuff people need to add later.  Dried cranberries instead of raisins, both for more seasonal flavor and because I don't like raisins.  I cut the brown sugar by 1/4 cup, but added a few extra cranberries.  I replaced the butter with grapeseed oil because I'm a very sensitive lactose-intolerant, and added 1/3rd cup of water at the end to reconstitute the egg powder and because the dough seemed dry.  Conclusion:  These were amazing!  I'm glad I cut the brown sugar - it was just the right amount of sweetness.  The oil definitely had a lot to do with why these came out so good.  I bet it could be cut and a little water added and still make a good cookie, but I won't bother to try it.  They might only be a 4-star cookie if not in a jar, since I am conservative in my ratings and my family liked these cookies but didn't rave about them for hours; but because the quantities were sized for gift-giving right off the bat, I am giving this a definite 5-star.    A big thank you to the author of this recipe for making this part of my holiday gift-giving easy to work out!

Good cookies and very nice gift. Be sure to use a quart jar to get ingr to fit. Also, you can lessen white sugar amount (1/4 cup still tastes good) to help get it all in the same jar. Cranberries in place of raisins, and an added 1/4 C choc chips worked well in this.

Yay!  I was desperate for a cookie recipe with coconut for a surprise visit I was receiving.  Most recipes called for chocolate and nuts or were a macaroon recipe.  This recipe not only fulfilled my needs with my limited pantry, but the cookies it made were so scrumptious that my guests asked for the recipe.  Thank you!

Just made one.  I only used 1 cup coconut and didn't have any trouble getting all ingredients to fit.  I'm donating a couple to a bake sale.  It came out really cute!

Omitted coconut and used frosted corn flakes in place of wheat flakes. There were different, but still tasted good. I don't know if I would make these often, but if your looking for something new every once in awhile then these are worth a try.

The cookies are delicious! (Had to try them before giving them as gifts.)

The only problem I had was fitting everything into a quart jar.  I really packaged it tight, but found that I needed to eliminate 1/4 cup of the coconut.  Everything fit in the jar by doing that!

Mostly easy to put together.  I highly recommend using a WIDE-mouthed jar.  It will make it much easier to press down each layer.

I filled several jars with this mix and gave them to friends and neighbors at Christmas. It was a BIG hit.  I made a batch myself and they a great, moist and chewy.

It didn't fit in the jar as written. I found it also way to sweet and also too coconutty. . My variation is: 1/4 c white sugar, 1/2 c brown sugar, 2/3 c flaked coconut, 3/4 cup crushed corn flakes. The dough barely held together and I thought it needed another egg but I tried it with and without the extra egg and the one with one egg was way better, crunchy rather than chewy, exactly the way I like it, and so did my church friends at the potluck I took them to. One more piece of advice, really let them cool on the baking sheet first for at least 5 minutes or they will crumble apart in your hands! Lovely cookie when done right and very fast to make!

Amazing. Pack in the jar tightly but fits just fine. I love sweet things but could easily cut a 1/4c sugar next time, wow. A keeper. Many thanks.
