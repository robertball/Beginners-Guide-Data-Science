This tasted pretty fantastic and the fish came out flaky and delicious.  My only problem was that I didn't know lemongrass was so tough, so I minced it when I should have just left it in big chunks that I could pick out instead of the little stringy tough lemongrass bits getting in my teeth.  The sauce was good and it was a shame to waste it; I don't know what you'd eat it over though--maybe rice?

Great recipe! I didn't serve it with teriyaki, though. I reduced the sauce with cornstarch and poured it over the filets. A delicious and elegant dish, perfect for company!

I was disappointed with this recipe, especially after reading such great reviews; perhaps I did something wrong, but I followed the recipe to the T.

The salmon was fine, but the citrus taste was barely noticeable, which was frustrating considering all of the ingredients that went into the dish. Additionally, there was a considerable amount of waste...almost 2 liters.

While eating this for supper, I was wishing that I had just grilled the salmon and saved myself the expense of the lemon grass, OJ, and white wine.

I think that if I were to do this again I would 1/3 of the ingredients and marinate it for an hour or so, and then grill it.

Incredibly easy to make, and ready in minutes.  You have to start the rice way ahead of time!  I added a tablespoon of molassas to the broth.  It gave it a nice color and a smokey/sweet taste.  Serve with rice and sauted mushrooms and snap peas with some garlic.

I think the orange juice overpowered this dish. Next time, I would cut the OJ in half and perhaps use shallots instead of onions, and maybe more garlic. I feel like it lacked any flavor except the orange juice.

This was simple and tasty.  We used a Riesling wine and thickened some of the poaching liquid afterwards with arrowroot starch to make a sauce.  Served over white rice cooked with chicken broth and chunks of ginger and with the broccoli with garlic butter and cashews from this site.

This is the perfect salmon dish.  Salmon fillets in Japan can be greasy sometimes but the OJ and lemongrass provides a nice contrast to the rich salmon flavor.

Delicious! I made this recipe the first time that I cooked for my father in law. He loved it! A year later I still hear him telling his buddy how good that salmon was, and how he missed out big time.

I liked this dish... didn't love it though.  It was very light in flavour and after having read all of the ingredients I expected for all of those great flavors to come through on the salmon, but they didn't really.  None the less, the salmon was perfectly cooked and tasted just fine.  However, it was just not what I expected

Maybe I did something wrong, but my husband and I both thought this tasted funny. I think it was the lemongrass. If I made it again, I think I would just leave that part out and make it plain citrus poached salmon.

Very tender,moist,light and flavourfull. It was the nicest salmon I've ever had. I cut the lemongrass in inch long pieces and crushed them to release their flavour and just picked it out at the end. I don't think I'll cook salmon any other way from now on. I just loved this recipe. So perfect with a basmati rice and roasted broccoli. YUMMMMMMMMMMY

I loved this recipe but made one addition. I added about two tablespoons of Sambal Olek chili paste to the broth and after poaching the fish I added Thai brown rice noodles to the broth. I served the noodles and fish in shallow bowls with bean sprouts and lime as garnishment and some roasted brussel sprouts along the edges. Yum, yum.

Nice dish.  Keep the lemongrass in large pieces and you don't need all the OJ.  I've even made without the lemongrass and it is still good.

Looking for something different is our game plan these days. This was a hit! Was always a little timid about making Thia style dishes because I thought for sure I'd get the flavors wrong. Easy as one two three and gone just as quickly! :)

Not bad if already have all ingredients. Ver light flavor. Try marinating in sauce for 3+ hrs before boiling.

Ehhhh. It was okay. I love fish and the price I spent on lemon grass and OJ wasn't worth it. I think I'll stick with grilling salmon. But thanks anyway :)

Wonderful dish!  I substituted the juice of 2 oranges instead of the quart of orange juice.  I chopped the lemongrass coarsely before cooking and then removed after the fish was cooked.  I removed the fish and thickened the poaching sauce with 3tbsp.cornstarch before serving.

Make it five stars with one change - mix all the ingredients and marinate the salmon in it for at least two hours. You can then either poach the salmon in the marinade or grill separately. If you grill you can also boil and thicken the marinade with a little cornstarch or arrowroot as a sauce.
