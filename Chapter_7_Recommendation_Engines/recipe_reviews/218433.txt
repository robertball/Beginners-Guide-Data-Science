I really screwed this one up the first time through :)  Always good to remember to add the sugar!  But I also cooked the cherries per the directions and ended up accidentally caramelizing them.  

So, the second time I made it, it came out pretty well.  I used about 2.5 cups of cherries the second time, and simmered them on medium low heat (3.5 on my electric) with 1.5 T of butter and a little extra sugar - rounded tablespoon.  This produced a lot more juice.

I think if I make it again though, I'd use even more cherries because where it has juice and cherries, it's the tastiest.  Also, I pulled it out at 35 minutes instead of the 40 recommended.  I think it may have been done before that though - I'll experiment with times for the next time I make it.

I'd also probably try adding vanilla and a little dash of salt to bring out more flavor in the cake itself.

The cake is not terribly moist, but it's flavorful.  It's not overly sweet, and tastes great with ice cream and a drizzle of chocolate sauce.  I think it would also be great with whipped cream or a powdered sugar glaze. 

I think it'd be good with blueberries too - I may try that next time.

Update:  Made this a 2nd time and added almond extract, used different cherries and added a streusel.  Wow!  Delicious - moist and flavorful.

The only change I made was to use sour cream for the yogurt.  This definitely is a more dry cake and I like mine a little more moist, so I may experiment and add more sour cream/yogurt next time.  Mine was also done at just about 30 minutes, so definitely check it when you smell it baking!  Thanks for sharing!

I used vanilla yogurt instead of plain.  Also used 2 1/2 cups of cherries.  Served it warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Yum!

This really was very tasty. We ate it for dessert last night and breakfast this morning. I had a bunch of sweet cherries from a friend's tree and needed to use them up. My changes after reading other's reviews: I used a full cup of plain greek yogurt, added a tsp almond extract to the batter and increased the cherries to 2 1/2 cups. The only thing I plan on doing differently next time is use even more cherries. I think this needs at least 3 cups of pitted cherries. Excellent recipe!

Okay, I admit to taking some liberties with this recipe, both from personal preference and for what I had on hand.  I subbed melted coconut oil for the olive oil, used a heaping half cup of white sugar, mixed a half cup of honey in with the coconut oil, 3 cups of cherries with a heaping tablespoon each of white sugar and honey, added a half teaspoon of almond extract and about 8 oz (by weight) of plain greek yogurt.  Did not drizzle top of cake with olive oil, but did add a crumb topping of butter, white and brown sugars, and flour, then drizzled that with about a tablespoon of honey before putting in the oven (took 40 minutes to bake up).  That cake was GONE at our family lunch.  The cake was wonderfully moist, spongey, and light, with just enough sweetness.

I love cake.  I love cherries.  I love buttercream frosting.  So I made the cherry cake and frosted it with buttercream frosting.
Delish.  Excellent recipe.  I made no changes but for the frosting.  I thought about a side of ice cream but the frosting did the trick.

This is spectacular! I usually use sour cherries as I enjoy them more, and I substituted some of the flour with almond flour. It's very easy to make and it's really moist, everything a good cake should be. I really enjoyed that it's not too sweet.
If you're aiming for a sweeter version, try adding crumbles on top - also works really well!

Yummy!  I had 4cups of sour pie cherries so I used them all (cooked with double the sugar) and also subbed butter for olive oil in the batter, and 1 cup yogurt and a little almond extract. We love it!

I made it as is listed with 95% organic and grass-fed ingredients and I liked it a lot, but will make these changes next time:  I'll add 1/4 C sugar as it wasn't sweet enough, I'll use 3 C cherries (and a little more butter and sugar while cooking) as there weren't enough, and I'll poke some of the cherries into the cake as they all stayed on top.  Otherwise, this is my new favorite cake!

Would add at least another 1/2 cup cherries. Not sure I likes olive oil taste. May try canola oil and vanilla yogurt next time. Will serve with ice cream and maybe more berries.

Since I'm allergic to Cinnamon, I made this and used a bit of Nutmeg as a replacement spice.  We also made muffins instead of a sheet cake.   They were good, but they just lacked something.

I found this a little dry and tasteless. Really more like a muffin than a cake.

I made half this recipe in an 8" square pan. I weighed the flour out, stirred the ingredients together just until combined and made extra sure to not overbake. My cake baked in 21 minutes. It's dry and I'm really disappointed. I used vegetable oil in place of olive and added salt, but needed more.

We really like this cake.  I used vanilla yogurt instead of plain because the only plain I could find was a large quantity.  Next time I think I will use black cherry yogurt.  I also used about 2 1/2 cups of cherries.  Next time I will use at least 3 cups.  Very good recipe!

Please don't call it Polish! Polish pastry is fantastic but this cake is not. I followed the recipe to the point and the cake looks good but the taste not so. It is very dense and kind of tasteless.

I halved the recipe to bake in a 9x9 pan, replaced olive oil with melted butter, used vanilla sugar on the cherries, 40 minutes was perfect in my oven. We really enjoyed the cake, it reminded me of a kuchen. A great way to use up some frozen cherries I had.

Great cake! I followed the recipe almost to the letter, except I just used a jar of morello cherries from Trader Joe's  - I drained them and didn't measure them when adding to the cake. I also skipped the drizzle of oil on top and did like another reviewer and sprinkled with sugar instead. I cut the sugar in the actual cake mixture by almost half, using just a little more than 1/2 cup (about 120g). A nice cake to enjoy for breakfast or afternoon coffee!

This was very good. I made it with canned cherries and skipped the sauteing in butter part, since the cherries were already sweet. Instead of drizzling the cake with olive oil I sprinkled 1 tablespoon of sugar over it

I made this cake for my Polish aunt on her birthday and she and the rest of my family enjoyed it so much.  I will definitely make this recipe again.
