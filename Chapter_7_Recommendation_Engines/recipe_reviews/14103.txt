Believe it or not, this is really good.  I was quite skeptical, but I'll try almost anything once.  My husband and I, and one of my 2 boys liked this a lot.  It could have used some salt and pepper, but that was easily fixed at the table.  If we wind up with leftover mashed potatoes again (doesn't happen often with potato-loving boys!), I'll definitely make this one again.

These were wonderful... I didnt think I'd like them so much but I did. Had with a bowl of homemade tomato red pepper soup and it was perfect.  You could use this recipe with your Thanksgiving leftovers... stuffing and turkey added to this, or instead of the potatoes would be wonderful
