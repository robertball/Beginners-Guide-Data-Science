They were good and I will make them again. Do you know that all sugar is not vegan.

A great option for those that need to avoid dairy. I also used gluten-free flour to make them gluten-free. I multiplied the recipe by 8 to make it worth my while. So good!  


Conversion for larger batch:


1 1/2 cups flour

1 1/2 cups chocolate chips

1 cup sugar

1 cup olive oil 

1/2 cup cocoa powder 

1/2 cup almond milk

4 tsp. Vanilla extract 

4 tsp. Baking powder

It tasted good, but it would be nice if you updated it so I could make more than just 4 small cookies
