Boy did this ever hit the spot - I added a little horseradish and some minced garlic (got that little tip from Martha Stewart).  This is much better than buying store bought mix.  Just garnish a tall ice filled glass with a celery stick and a lemon wedge.

Ah yes, so darn good. Also used some horseradish and a pretty stick of celery. Needed something like this to perk me up tonight as we had to put our sweet and lovable cat Oliver down today. Here's to you Ollie; you were the best!

Wow!  this is good--a little spicy but can live with that.  Might try adding a little horseradish the next time.

I made this mix for Christmas day and I really enjoyed it. It was thick and yummy. I did use V8 instead of tomato juice but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. Let it chill in the fridge.

This is a good base recipe for the hubby who does love his Bloody Mary's!  Though after experimenting a little, we did find that we liked using V8 as a base better than plain tomato juice.  Added fresh grated horseradish (so much better tasting than the bottled kind) and lightly dusted the rim of our glasses with Old Bay Seasoning.  Hubs asked that this be kept in the 'go to file' and I agree.  Served with a mix of olives and celery sticks!  Thanks paniece for the submission!

Excellent recipe,I've made this for a large party twice now. I do use v-8 juice for the base. I  make ahead of time and just add the liquor. I  set the tabasco out for people to adjust to their taste. I also add 1 teaspoon of horseradish.

Bloody Mary's are my husband's favorite mixed drink. I made him this mix and tried a new recipe every week. He gave this one 5 stars and said to throw all others away. I even tried this mix with my own touch adding a little lemon juice and beef broth and he said it was way better the original way. So I had to rate this mix. Don't change a thing on this recipe and you will have the best Bloody Mary! Cheers

This was yummy.  Next time I'll add horseradish, I didn't have any at home this time.  Also, I don't drink alcohol, so made this a virgin.

Great recipe!  I don't know how well I followed the directions but it's a great place to start!  Here's what I did . . . 1. I started with a 64 oz bottle of tomato juice so I actually dumped out (and saved!) a few ounces to try to make 48 oz. 2. I ended up adding about a tbsp of horseradish, extra pepper, extra hot sauce, and some garlic powder. 3. I actually packed the mix, a jar of pickles, some cut-up celery in a plastic bag, a jar of olives, and a bottle of vodka in a cooler and had a traveling bloody mary bar!

Oh, my, soooo good.  Much better than anything you can buy, and how great that is ready to go.  Until this time I've always made each glass separately.  And I did add a bit of  garlic powder

This was delicious.  I took the mix to a brunch and got great reviews.  I did add a little horseradish to taste (about 1 1/2 teaspoons) because I love its tangyness.  Also, I used Calamato Tomato Juice, which may help in your selection of juices.

Pretty good basic recipe but even better with horseradish and lime. I didn't have celery salt so used garlic salt plus a little celery seed. I also doubled the Tabasco. And of course don't forget the olives and celery! I like to make this with low-sodium tomato juice and have it as a healthy virgin drink.

Excellent mix!  Brought it to a tailgating party before the Vikings game and everyone was asking me what was in the mix.  It's better and cheaper than the pre-made stuff!  I do prefer a thinner mix, so next time I might try half V8 and half Clamato juice.  That is just personal texture preference though.  I also added the juice of half lemon.  Perfection!!!!!

This was GREAT!  I used V-8 and I wish I'd gone with a tad less pepper, as it was a bit spicy.  Everyone LOVED it.  Oh Oh!  Serve it with Zesty Garlic Dill Spears.  It was AMAZING!

Really like these except I am a baby and following the recipe exactly made them too spicy for me. Now we make them a little lighter on the pepper and they are great. We always dip the glasses in celery salt and have found some spicy dill spears to throw in them. A friend who owns a bar said to put A-1 steak sauce in them and that adds a lot. Otherwise this is a great recipe and fun to experiment with.

I always knew I could make a better Bloody Mary than any bar/restaurant if I ever tried & thanks to this recipe, I proved myself right on my very first try.

My only alteration is the addition of tons of horseradish, as I love it! This is always a hit with guests. 

I'm kinda famous for these Bloody Marys now.

Great recipe! If you are looking for a little more zing, then add horseradish. But this is a great base! Thanks so much, was a hit for our Halloween party and for the next morning! The people that don't drink alcohol loved that they had a "virgin" option.

good basic recipe-Easily added to for personal taste. I use giant green olive instead of celery and use the celery salt as my glass rim salt.

I use about ten times the hot sauce because I like 'em spicy.  By the way, if you run out of celery salt, seasoned salt is a pretty good substitute (I'd start with only 1 TB of it, though).  Thanks for the recipe!!

Fabulous recipe. I really like making my bloody's with Clamato juice. Great idea to make ahead. All our college friends get together for a party the same time each year. The next day, we all meet at my house on the water and have a calmer visit. It was all I could do to keep up with mixing each cocktail. I'll make a large batch next time and relax along with them.

Made the recipe just as it is (well, added a little lemon juice but that's it), took it on a Girl's Only River Trip in the summer and everyone loved it!  They mixed it with a little vodka and celery and it went QUICK. If i would of known it was going to go so fast, I would of taken two bottles.  Everyone said it was way better than the already made mix you buy at the store :).  I used Clamato tomato juice

Much better than any bloody mary mix you could find in the stores. I used V8 and was delicious,just top off with stuffed olives, lemon wedge and a celery stick and its perfect. Much better then paying 8.50 for a bloody mary at a restraunt! Will definately make on those rough morning afters!

Prepared mix within 5 or 6 minutes of finding on allrecipes.com.  It's outstanding.  The only way to go, especially with all of the nappy stuff available on the store shelves.  I'll probably add about 1 1/5 tsp. horseradish next time but still amazing- and very simple. Thanks.

Very tasty the only thing I did different was to add a bit more hot sauce to make it spicier. Made this to use in the bloody mary chicken recipe from this site. I  look forward to eating it!!

I like mine really spicy so I added lots of hot sauce and black pepper.  Make sure to add pickles, celery, olives, even cheese, bacon, ham, or turkey (if you want it Wisconsin-style!)

I had this for lunch today w/ a BLT (it was a beautiful Sunday afternoon) & it rocked! I scaled the recipe down by half & decreased the celery salt a bit as cautioned by one of the reviewers. It was very thick, rich & spicy....yummmy! Next time I want to try it w/ V8 juice.

Throw a couple strips of cooked bacon into the mix for an awesome flavor twist!  Everything is better with bacon!

I thought that this made an excellent bloody mary, but it was far too thick for me, so I watered it down with 2 cups of water.  Turned out perfect!

We had a few people over last night and I made one pitcher of this mix.  They all raved about it and before the evening was over I had to make another pitcher.  I followed the recipe exactly as it was written.  It is a keeper! Thanks for sharing!

Love it! Perfect as is. I tried adding 1/8 tsp horseradish (after sampling it with the base recipe) and liked it less. It's also OK with 1/4 tsp lemon juice added, but that didn't particularly help much either. Stick to the basics, and let flavors blend overnight if you can.

Per other reviewers, I backed off the celery salt and added 1 tablespoon of horseradish. Awesome.

I have to give this a 3*.  My family competes professionally at chili/BBQ cookoffs and I made this recipe for the Bloody Mary contest and the 'testers' all grimmaced and said "no way."  I turned it in anyway and out of 10 entries, mine was not a winner (1-3).  I give it a 3 because there is always the possiblity I made an error.  However, the next week, I entered another Bloody Mary contest using my recipe and won 1st place.

I thought the liquid seemed thin.  May try again.

Tried this mix today.  Didn't have any tabasco on hand so just used everything but that.  Great mix.  Added some olives, which I love and also, in the past I have used dill pickle spears like some restaurants do.  Which is really great, if you don't want to use celery.  When I scaled the recipe down to 4 servings watch the SALT.  Go light with the salt at first when scaling the recipe down.  The scaling might be a little off.

This is a really good bloody mary mix.  I also add about 1/2 tsp. horseradish and use celery seed instead of celery salt but otherwise follow the recipe exactly.  I've tried lots of them and this is by far the best!

I'm trying to decide if the tomato juice I purchased was the reason it didn't turn out as well as expected. I also may try bacon vodka as opposed to regular vodka to give it more of a kick. I've also let it sit a day so perhaps the flavors have combined more. I'll continue to tweak and see how it goes.

Very good. I think fresh squeezed lemon juice is a must and sends this recipe over the top. Also, I garnished with lemon and Spanish olives. Yummy. Thank you!

I really wanted to enjoy this, but did not like it. I started with V8 juice, instead of tomato juice, so maybe that made it too spicy.

Great recipe.  I like spicy so I added 1 tbs of horseradish and 1/4 c mcclures pickle juice.  It is hard to wait (or maybe hard to plan ahead. . .) but giving the flavors time to meld makes all the difference.

Nice basic beginning. My favorite mix is with V-8 and a splash of lime along with the celery as garnish.

This is really good!! I only gave four stars because next time I will cut the worcestershire sauce to 2 tbs instead of 3.

I loved it . I made it last night and let it sit overnight to let the flavors develop. I personally thought it was a little salty ( i don't use a lot of salt ) from the celery salt. Next time I will add less celery salt and add some ground celery seed.I am also going to try it with Clamato juice.It has just the right zing for me. This is WAY better than any store bought mix., and cheaper too.

This was a brilliant recipe.  I had all the ingredients at home (except celery salt which is 3 tsp salt & 1 1/2 tsp celery seed).  Letting it sit overnight was the key (DH usually mixes similar ingredients up in a glass).  He also loves horseradish, so I thought he would doctor this up, but he drank the whole jar--without adding vodka!  (It was a little spicy for me, so I'll cut the hot sauce in half next time, and let him add it to his drink).  I prefer to garnish with a pickle spear.

This was excellent - I did mix half tomato juice and half clamato and lighter on the tabasco (I put the tabasco on the side if someone wanted it spicier) but the pitcher was gone in no time! Garnished with celery, pickles and jalapeno stuffed olives, and mmmm.

Good to relax with at the end of a busy day.  Almost too good.  Was tempted to overindulge.
