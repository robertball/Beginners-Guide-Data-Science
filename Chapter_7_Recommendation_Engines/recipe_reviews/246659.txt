This is how you make broccoli rabe- no blanching. The only changes I made was that I used a lot more minced garlic. 9 cloves. I also tossed pine nuts in. Delicious.

Too bitter. Flash boil brocolli rabe in 4 quarts of salted water for 5 minutes immediately submerge in iced water. Press and drain in colander and salute as suggested in your recipe. A teaspoon of anchovy paste sauteed with garlic really makes it Sicilian.

Really easy and tasty. I used a bit more water than called for in the recipe and lots more garlic.

I added more garlic, sun dried tomatoes and use vegetable or chicken broth instead of water.  To make it a whole meal, a 15oz can of white beans and pasta. Serve with grated cheese
