Wow, not sure where to start... I started preparing this and put just one tablespoon of curry into the yogurt and tomato paste mixture and was immediately worried it was too much! I put a little over half the amount of ginger and stirred. I tested it and it was extremely “earthy” and while that might work for some folks I knew hubby would be unhappy. I did not add the other tablespoon of curry and instead added 1 1/2 teaspoons of white sugar then a teaspoon of brown sugar along with garlic and salt and pepper. Poured it over the chicken and put crockpot on high for one hour. At that point I lower heat to low and added 3 tablespoons salted butter. Cooked a couple more hours and shredded the meat, left it on warm. Daughter and boyfriend loved it, hubby and I liked it. I ate some cold for leftovers the next day and liked it better. I think if you like curry, this may work for you as written but for me two tablespoons of curry is just too much. If I make it again I will try half tablespoon of curry and increase if needed. I also think sour cream instead of yogurt would help the consistency. Thank you for an intriguing and challenging recipe!!
