Loved these meatballs.  Followed the recipe exactly.  The sauce is very tasty.  I've been trying different sweet and sour meatball recipes for the last year or so trying to duplicate the flavor of the sauce I had at a banquet.  Think this is the one!  Don't be alarmed by the overwhelming vinegar  smell/taste at first.  After you combine the sauce with the meatballs and allow it to bake and reduce it takes on a whole new (delicious!) flavor.

Very good, everyone loved it.  I used two pounds of lean ground turkey and one pound extra lean ground beef.  Next time I make this I'll cut down on the sugar.  It was kind of sweet.

This recipe was wonderfull for dinner.  I reduced the size: 120 meatballs for dinner was way to much, but 60 was perfect!! Thanks for the great dinner!

I love this recipe!  I made a few changes though.  I used rice vinegar instead of cider vinegar.  Rice vinegar has a mellow flavor.  In addition, I used half sweet Italian sausage and half hamburger.  My family loved it.

Wow, this were awesome!  I used crushed crackers instead of bread crumbs, just because I didn't have any, and I used only 1 Tbsp of white vinegar like other people recommended.

Super simple to make.  And they taste great.  I halved the recipe and got about 50-60 meatballs.  All but 6 were left after my family of four got their hands on them.  They went better than the main course.

I used 2 pounds of gound elk and 1 pound of lean ground beef.  My family is picky and they ate them with out complaint.  I will definately make them again.  I also used Splenda Brown Sugar because my husband is diabetic and it brings down the carbohydrate count.

This recipe was easy to make.  I subsituted the milk for soy milk and the meat for ground turkey.  This recipe was way to sweet for my family, I think next time I will use half the sugar.

This is my go-to sweet n sour meatball recipe! I follow the recipe almost exactly, except I scale the recipe to 6 servings to use 1 lb ground beef. Fills a 9x13 pan and is perfect for dinner for a family of 5! The only change I make to this recipe is that I use a bit of finely chopped fresh yellow onion in place of onion flakes. Don't worry, the sauce will sound and smell nasty at first but as it bakes with the meatballs the flavor really mellows out into a delicious sauce. I make these with the nutmeg, but I've left it out before and it turned out perfectly fine. Honestly, i cant taste a difference... But i use it anyways! : )These meatballs passed a 6 and a 9 year old, so it has to be good!! ;-) Serve over cooked brown rice for a delicious and hearty meal.

This recipe is very similar to a family recipe we have been making for years.  Except we don't have cornstarch and the amount of each ingredient is slightly different.  Just a note to others, if you are in a hurry to make, you can use frozen meatballs and a crockpot.  We have made it in the oven and crockpot and have used any kind of meatball all with the same taste.

Very good recipe. I agree with an earlier review, the vinegar was a little strong. Next time I make this I will reduce the vinegar. Otherwise everyone enjoyed this recipe.

These were simple to make and taste very good. I do feel like something was missing from the balls. I added some garlic powder, but it's something else...

This is a great meatball dish! I did however make some changes, I didnt add the milk. I added 2 eggs and a pkg of lipton onion soup mix along with the cup of bread crumbs. For the sauce, I used peach preserves being that was all I had and the chilli sauce with 1 c. ketchup. WoW!  Love it! Thank you!

Made this tonight.  Used a little less sugar as other reviewers suggested, only had vinegar, used Kellogg's boxed corn flake crumbs in place of bread crumbs(son's wheat allergy), and omitted the eggs(kids allergic to them).  Turned out great!  Was sooo  tasty!!!!  Definitely will make again!

Wow - the first meatballs I've ever made, and they were great.
One thing I'll do if/when I make this again, though, is use the leanest ground beef I can buy. With the cheaper beef, this cooked up with a lot of oily fat in the sauce.
The flavors of the meatballs and sauce were wonderful though; I never would have thought to put nutmeg in the meatballs.

These were delicious! Here are the changes I made: 1 onion instead of onion flakes, no nutmeg or mustard, homemade breadcrumbs, and for the sauce I put everything in together.

REALLY tasty, y’all!  Made it exactly as the recipe called for with the one exception of using minced onion (half of what the onion calls for).  Over a bed of brown rice... delicious!  I had planned on being shy with the sauce, but then I tasted it.  DAAAAAAANG it made those meatballs something special.  Will definitely keep this recipe for frequent use.  Thanks for posting!

Loved this! I'm originally from Northern Wisconsin so my meatballs have all, to this point, been Swedish.  I was ready to try something new and this recipe was excellent!  Followed it exactly and wouldn't change a thing.

Family taste test - red sauce (grape & chili sauce) vs. your white sauce.  Hands down, your white sauce WINS!!  Leave the heavy red sauce to the cocktail weiners

I made half the recipe and the only change that I made was I used diced onions instead of the dried ones everything else was as stated. They were good but next time I will cut the sugar down. Thanks for recipe Pam Somers
