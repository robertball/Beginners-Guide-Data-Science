These were tasty! I cut the recipe down and used a little less dijon, as I knew that amount was gonna be a bit much for us. I can't believe I'm saying this (as a lover of all thing BACON), but I think I would've preferred these w/o the bacon. Still, they were yummy and I will make them again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Awesome recipe!  Although I did leave out the bacon bits and added a lot more mayo.  This was a great platform in which to build my own style.  Thank you very much for sharing!

Perfect hard boiled eggs but I thought the filling was just alright. Maybe too much mustard

Very good! I did not use bacon and I added a little cream cheese and a few dashes of texas pete hot sauce. I also didn't have any dijon mustard so I used ground mustard. Came out excellent.

I LOVE this recipe. Will use from now on when making deviled eggs. I used fresh bacon for my bacon bits and added just a touch more relish. YUM!

People love these! I actually donâ€™t eat deviled eggs and made them for someone else and ever since then they are requested at every party.

great recipe. Made them for a football tailgate and they were all gone by the end of the game.
