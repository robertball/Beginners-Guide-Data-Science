This was breakfast for the kids this morning. Huge hit, not just for the kids but great for me because I didn't have to cook and it used up a half package or tortillas I had in the fridge. They ate all four on their own. This recipe is so versatile that you could use any spread inside the tortilla and any mix of fruit that you wanted. What a fantastic idea!

Delicious! This was really tasty and made for a quick breakfast. I cut the recipe in half to give it a try and since I LOVE peanut butter I knew this was going to be good. Along with the strawberries and blueberries I added some thin sliced banana that I had on hand. This was a great for breakfast "on the go" and the nuttiness of the peanut butter complimented the sweetness of fresh fruit. Very easy and very tasty!

These made a perfect yummy and healthy snack for my nephews! That's a compliment when they eat anything other than pizza bites and cheetos. I made them again and instead of pb&j, i smeared cream cheese, then layered strawberry pie filling and filled with fresh strawberries, canteloupe, blueberries and kiwi. VERY GOOD!

YUM! EASY! Great for a Lenten lunch, too.  Bananas of course, would work in there, too.

A great snack.  I used raspberry jelly with the pb on whole-grain tortillas with strawberries and blueberries as directed.  This would be easy to modify for personal taste.

Sooo good! I don't have much food around my house, so I used what I had! I used organic peanut butter, organic grape jelly, frozen blueberries, and fresh Gala apple slices, and it was absolutely delicious! The frozen blueberries were a little special treat mixed in there, especially because I let them sit and melt a bit! This is an yummy, healthy, and quick treat for breakfast, a snack, or even dessert!
