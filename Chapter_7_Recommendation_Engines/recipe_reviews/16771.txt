Great combo of flavors... very easy and quick.  I baked in my oven instead of the grill for about the same amount of time.  Yum!

These add up to their name, they are easy and cheesy.  I baked in the oven, but other than that followed the recipe and they were a big hit.  I will make again for sure.

These potatoes are great whether you cook them in tin foil on the grill or in a dish in the oven.  Sometimes I don't even top them with cheese and they are still wonderful.  I also add garlic and onion powder to the recipe.

HOLY COW! These are delicious! My new favorite grilling recipe! I basically made this recipe as stated but inadvertantly some slight things made it better! I had some seasoned onions from precooking my chicken for the grill, used them.(Chipotle pepper and garlic flavored)I also used bacon grease to lube the foil instead of spray and I think that added flavor too! Try this, really easy and NO CLEAN-UP!

I have used this recipe in  the past.  I have found it is best to slice the potatoes thin.  When they are done I simply add the cheese, close up the foil, and when the cheese is melted,transfer to a dish, this is excellent with grilled skinless, boneless chicken breasts basted with garlic butter on the grill.  The recipe I used was about 15 years ago and I still use it today.  I live alone and its an easy meal to make for one, while its cooking I clean up any mess in the kitchen, fix me a salad, and when its done, eat the potatoes and chicken.

OMG! These were delicious! The only changes that we made were that we put Lawrys seasoned salt on them, and threw cut up pieces of bacon in with it. Super yummy, thank you for sharing!

This is such an easy recipe, and a great grilling alternative!  Try it instead of mashed potatoes with your steak, and if you're trying to go low-fat, substitute a yogurt based spread and skim cheese. Still very flavorful with the salt/pepper and onions.  Very quick, and cooks just as advertised in the time allotted - perfectly tender potatoes!

This recipe, with a few modifications, has carried us nicely through the summer with a minimum of dirty dishes! I always use as many veggies as I have available-- including potatoes, onions (any color work fine), peppers (green, yellow, red), squash and zucchini, and mushrooms to name a few. At first I used butter but I find olive oil to work better-- the point of the fat used is to soften the starchy veggies and keep everything from burning and sticking to the foil. I always add spices, garlic is a must (fresh or powdered, whatever is available), and lots of pepper. I usually don't add cheese at all-- who needs it?? All our guests have loved this recipe, it's so easy-- just throw the packets on the grill for 30 min-1 hour (the more veggies inside, the longer) and remember to turn them over once in awhile, and you're golden! Great recipe!

These were so good! I add some seasoning salt and have tried them with a few slices of bacon added and with some left over chicken and both were wonderful.

Made as written.  End results, they were good but no WOW factor for us.  It is definitely an easy, no clean up required recipe, and would be good for a camping side dish.

I was in a jam trying to find a great but simple recipe for scalloped potatoes. This was a great big hit. I will make this alot in the future. Money saving too. I had all the ingredients on hand already. It's now part of my family.

Very tasty! I only had red peppers on hand and the flavor was wonderful. I baked these in the oven at 350 degrees following the recommended cooking times. I sprinkled about 2 tsp of water on the potatoes before sealing the foil to help them steam.

Great recipe! I cut the recipe down by a third since the full recipe would certainly feed a crowd. I used Yukon Gold potatoes sliced thin, and put all the ingredients (minus the butter) in the microwave for 5 minutes prior to cooking on the grill to guarantee that everything would be cooked through. Delicious.

Awesome recipe!!  I made them in the oven, and not the grill.  Next time I make this recipe, I will half cook the potatoes in the microwave, or boil the potatoes... THEN put them in the oven, and add cheese after they've been cooked.  Very yummy outcome!! :)

This was delicious!!  I did have to substitute the shredded cheddar cheese for a Mexican blend shredded cheese, because that's what I had on hand.  Either way, they are scrumptious.

I did this today and it was so yummy!  Very comforting.  I did it covered on the oven.  I tried it at 350 but it didn't cook completely after 30 mins.  I changed up to 425 and it was done in 15 minutes more.  Very fast and yummy as a side dish.  Thanks for the recipe!

We forgot the cheese!! (and it was still a tasty side.)  Our personal preference for foil packets is cubed potatoes, but the slices were a nice change.

I was very pleased with this recipe, even though I changed some things and messed up on some things.  The potatoes were delish.  This is what I did wrong.  I put the pots into 3 different packages, whick changed the cooking time.  One package came out peerfectly, the other two were a little burnt, but still delish. I added onion and garlic powder which added greatly to the flavor.  Also, I believe that I sliced the pots a little too thin.  All in all very good recipe.  Thanx Pat.

These potatoes are the best.  My kids gobbled them up.  I did not add the green peppers because I am not a fan of the green pepper.  The cheese at the end makes them perfect.  Thankyou fora wonderful and easy recipe.

great base for lots of variations, from what veggies you add to what else goes on the grill. I don't have perfect BBQ weather so I baked thin potato slices and the veggies in the oven in a closed casserole dish for about 30 min at 350, sprinkled asiago cheese on it and let it sit in the turned off oven for 5 more min to let it melt. Very tasty!

I have made this a couple of times. I added garlic and  used poblano pepper.  I also baked them in the oven. They turned out very well.

I made this recipe tonight, although I didn't have the green pepper.  I added garlic powder and did them in two packets, just to make it more manageable for myself on the grill.  The potatoes were a hit!

These really were easy! The whole family loved them. A great side dish for barbecues or just a family dinner. I had a little trouble with the bottom burning, but they tasted GREAT!

These were pretty good..should have maybe used a sharp cheese becasue it wasn't very cheesy with the marble and I put lots on because we love cheese.  And 2 layers of regulare foil is not enough...total blackness on the bottom..and hard!!  Maybe some heavy duty stuff...or 4 layers of the other stuff to stopp the burning.  Or this could be done in the oven and be just as tasty without the burnt.

This was a big hit at a recent barbeque. I prepared it ahead of time, putting the foil packet in the oven.I think I will add a little bacon next time.

I used an oven with the foil packet sitting in a metal baking pan.  20 minutes on one side then 10 minutes on the other at 375 deg F. Potatoes still were not done.  It took another 18 minutes in the microwave to get them perfect.  My 81 year old mother said next time put them in the oven at 350 degrees F for one hour, then add the cheese for five minutes, stir and serve.

These are awesome!  Sliced thin, added fresh minced garlic, used "Mama Mia's Garlic Spread" (you should really try this stuff) for the butter called for and these turned out delicious!  Will for sure make this again!  Didn't follow the cook time.  I sliced them thin, but listened to them on the grill and they turned out great.  Really good.

These were basic and great.  I did use double wrapped foil.  they weren't burned at all.  I actually like them a little over done, so i might use single layered foil next time. Also, I used red potatoes and they were perfect!

These potatoes never finished cooking and the flavor left a lot to be desired.  I had high hopes they would be as good as the reviews but they weren't.  I even tried doubling the cheese and popping them in the oven to no avail.  Stick to a regular recipe if you're looking for cheesey potatoes.

Very good recipe. I have made these often- varying it to suit my mood. I often add garlic powder and onion powder, but find that the recipe is very forgiving no matter what you do. Even have cooked it in covered dish in microwave. Thanks for the recipe!

Good recipe.  The first time I made it I thought it was a bit bland, so next time
I jazzed it up with some Italian seasoning and red pepper flakes.

Potatoes turned out very moist.  The kids at it up, but I would have liked more flavor to it.  However, I joined the kids and ate it up, too.  Perhaps, I might try putting in some basil next time.
