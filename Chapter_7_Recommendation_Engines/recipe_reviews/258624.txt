Made without the sour cream due to personal preference and  these were excellent. Simple and straight forward just as a breakfast burrito should be. The bacon grease in the refried beans was the bomb. I did feel however think that the recipe needed more heat than just the salsa. Add some jalapeno and you have yourself a winner!
