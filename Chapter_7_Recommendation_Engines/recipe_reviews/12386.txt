This is EXTREMELY greasy if you melt the butter in the pan first. I prefer to use the same measurements, but I mix all ingredients except for the peaches together. Put the peaches in the pan first and THEN the batter on top. It's really good that way (a recipe that has been in my husband's family for decades!).

I have been making this recipe for years. My Swede-heart loves it. 
Only thing I have changed was adding 1/4tsp nutmeg and 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the flour mixture. Comes out perfect everytime!

I have a similar recipe that was given to me 45 years ago by a friend, who got it from her mother.
The only difference was the flour.  My recipe called for all purpose flour, plus 2 teaspoons of baking powder.  This one is even easier!

Very yummy and very easy!  I did not have self-rising flour on hand but thanks to a previous reviewer I was able to substitute all purpose flour and 2 tsp. baking powder and it worked great!  I have also divided this recipe in half and baked in a 2 round cake pans, using a different fruit in each pan.  Recipe divides easily and provides other choices for the pickier eaters in our family!

My husband is a "peach cobbler" lover and
I had never made it for him before.  I am just
now getting to baking, so I followed the
recipe and I couln't believe how easy it was
to make.  My husband loves me even more after
that.  I made a triple serving for my church
on a Wednesday night for a party, I was asked
to be the "cobbler lady" for now on.  It
was a success.  My kids don't like cobble, that is 
why I only rated "1 card".  Many thanks to Nancy
for such wonderful and easy recipe!

Very Good , We just finished it off! I did make changes as per reviews. I melted margarine in pan, 2 cans of peaches- but only 1 can of juice-I sprinkled about 1 tsp each of cinamon and pumpkin pie spice on the peaches. Poured peaches over margarine and sprinkled 1/4 cup light brown sugar. I used flour and 1 tsp baking powder,sugar+ milk,2tsp vanilla and a pinch of salt.Wisked together and poured over the peaches and around the sides. Placed a baking sheet under dish, for drips. Baked @ 350* for 30min and then 400* on the top shelf for 20 minutes. Take out and let sit for at Least 10minutes-it sets better and won't burn your mouth! I served it warm with ice cream and and a little whipped topping! Perfect!! The only change I would make next time is to spray the pan 1st. It wasn't greasy or mushy. The person who said it didnt rise probably didnt use self rising flour or didnt add baking powder? Thanks too all, I've been on this site for 1 yr now - Love it!! :)

This is a great recipe and it is so easy to make.  I followed the suggestion to add cinn. and nutmeg to the flour mixture and also used the "fruit crispy topping" recipe from this site as a topping for the cobbler. They went great together. Thanks so much for submitting it!

This is the recipe my husband's grandma used to make.  He was thrilled to have me make it last night.  I followed the recipe exactly, baked for 40 mins, and it turned out wonderfully.  Between my husband and 3 kids, it was gone this morning!

I was a bit skeptical that something this easy could be so good.  But the cobbler was delicious and definitely the easiest I've ever made.  I did add 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the flour mixture AND sprinkled additional cinnamon on top.  Yummy served warm with vanila ice cream!

This is the worst Peach Cobbler recipe I ever made. The crust would not rise and it tasted bad.

In spite of my high review, it really wasn't good at all!  I did substitute bacon fat, for the butter, salt, for the sugar, and canned spinach for the peaches.  It was completely inedible.  Where did I go wrong?  I also baked it at 200 degrees for 5 hours, could that have been why it wasn't good?  I followed the recipe exactly, except for the substitutions I made.

A great blast from my past. Before cooking took on an art form for me I just loved the taste of good food. This recipe is quick, easy and made from supplies most have in their pantry. Adding fresh cherries or cranberries is a great twist. Thanks for sharing.

Great and easy recipe!  I used more peaches.  You can never have enough fruit & I made it slightly different.  I took 1 cup of the peach juice added 1/2 cup of brown sugar, 1 tbsp of cornstarch, a pinch of salt, 1 tsp of nutmeg and cooked over medium heat until it boiled and was nice and thick....then I added 1 tbsp of lemon juice.  Once I added my peaches to the sugar/flour/milk mixture ....I then added my peach juice and sprinkled cinnamon.  I cooked mine until it was nice and brown on top...about 45-50 minutes.  Very good!  But next time I'm going to add more peach juice...I like a juicy peach cobbler, but over all very good especially with vanilla bean ice cream!  My husband loved it and I will definitely make this again!

me and my family think this is a wonderful recipe!  i did make a few changes, tho....for starters, i made a double batch....2 cups of flour and sugar...i didn't have milk so i used powdered milk and mixed the milk thick...and, i used 5 cans of peaches...the ones cut in halves....i started out by melting the butter and putting it in bottom of baking dish...then dumped the flour and sugar in...poured in the milk and dumped a bunch of cinnamon on top...probably about two tablespoons...took a fork and mixed it all together, then put two cans of peaches in with juice and 3 without....the cans were the 15.5 oz size....kinda folded the peaches in and put in the oven....it came out tasting delicious!  kinda reminded me of a breadpudding with peaches in it...the best part was the top, as it was carmelized.....love this recipe....i've made it twice in the last two days...next time i make it i'm going to put fresh blueberries in it....can't wait!

This is my grandma's any kind of fruit cobbler, only she called it "Dribble Pie".  She most often made it with blackberries, but I have made it with almost every kind of fruit, even strawberries.  For frozen fruit, thaw and bring to a boil with 1/2 to 1 cup of sugar.  My granny's original recipe called for the batter to be poured into the butter, then the fruit poured on top.  I have had better luck, however, pouring the fruit into the butter, then pouring the batter on top of the fruit.  I did have a problem one time with the dough not rising, but when I tasted it I realized I had used plain flour instead of self-rising!

My neighbor gave me this recipe, but added 1 tsp. vanilla, 1/4 tsp. cinnamon, and used peaches in light syrup instead of heavy(the light tastes just as good as the heavy and saves a few calories). for thicker pieces, I also bake it in a 8x8 or 9x9 pan for just a touch longer than the 9x13 calls for.  It is heavenly served warm with ice cream! Adding the nutmeg sounds good--I'll try that next time.  It's a fast, easy dessert that everyone loves!

I am an American living in Portugal and this recipe tastes nearly the same as the cobblers that my grandmother used to make after we picked fresh blackberries on our farm in Kentucky. All of my friends love it here! I cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup for the sake of my kids. I think it is plenty tasty without so much sugar and you can add other incredients, too. I have mixed apples and raisins, too. My Portuguese friends love it! Thanks!

I did not enjoy this cobblr at all! The consistency was icky and it tasted like baked cream of wheat with peaches. Plus it took way longer than 40 minutes and it still wasn't ready! My mom liked it though. Maybe she didn't want me to feel bad!

The title is definitely appropriate on this one.  I served it to my in laws and hubby who all really liked it.  I will be making this again but next time I will add an extra can of peaches one was not quite enough for the 9 X 13 pan.  I also added nutmeg and cinnamon.  I think next time I will add a little vanilla.

I've made this recipe twice and it was DELICIOUS! I WAS AMAZED TO FIND A RECIPE FOR A PEACH COBBLER TO BE SO SIMPLE AND EASY TO MAKE.  INSTEAD OF USING FLOUR I USED BISQUICK THEN I SPRINKLED A 1/2 TEASPOON OF CINNAMIN OVER IT!

This is a great dish. We loved it very much. Watch closly as it cooks: don't over cook. I have made it twice and thought it was great both times.

This wasn't bad by any means but it took a lot longer than the recipe states to cook, and was still quite runny... and really ridiculously sweet... if I make it again I will reduce the amount of sugar and leave out the syrup. :)

I have made this recipe for years. The only thing I do different is add 1 teaspoon almond extract to the peach juice and sprinkle cinnamon on the top before baking. This makes it excellent.

So EASY!!! I made this today for the first time and it was delicious. After looking at several comments, I decided to combine a little of them all. I doubled ingredients (flour, sugar, milk) except the butter. Into the mix I combined 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and 1/4 tsp nutmeg and melted butter (mix together until smooth). pour 3 cans of peaches with heavy syrup in a 13x9 pan, to this add 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 1 tsp vanilla extract(to taste) and mix together. Pour batter on top and sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar.(optional) I Cooked my cobbler for an hour on 350..Wouldn't change a thing...next time I will try a crispy crust.

Very good and easy. For me it turned out to be a 
spure of the moment for unexpected quests. A Hit.
I'll make it again.I do agree, a little to much butter
when melted in oven, next time, I will add to rest of ingredients.
This is my first review. Enjoy the whole myallrecipes idea.
Sandi.

I gave this a 3 star because as the recipe is, I don't think it would have turned out very well, however, I made some changes based on the reviews of others and it turned out wonderfully! My recipe is as follows : 1 cup all purpose flour, 2 tsp baking powder, 1 cup sugar, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp cinnamon - mix then add 1 cup milk (I use alternative Almond milk but any milk works) and 1/2 cup of butter. Pour 2 cans of peaches with syrup in the bottom of a 9x13" pan and top with the flour mix. Bake 40 min at temp. I think a lot of the negative reviews of goop and not setting up were because people just used all purpose flour without the baking powder and the recipe calls for self rising flour. Hope this helps some of you.

Love this recipe!  Super easy and super delicious!  I have been making this recipe for a number of years.  My dad expects this for his birthday every year.  The only change I have made, since my dad is diabetic, is substituting Splenda for the white sugar. Turns out perfect every time!

The cobbler never firmed up- even after an hour and 15 minutes in the oven! While it was completely unfit to serve, I have to say that my family did enjoy the taste. I definitely won't be making this again.

This would have been really good if I hadn't used all low fat ingredients. The dough doesn't brown if all low fat used. Next time I will use more regular items instead of low or no fat.

Grandma called this "WashDay Pie"... you can make it with blueberries, apples, and seedless cherries too! It's a wonderful easy dessert! Don't forget to break out the vanilla icecream!

I have made peach cobbler from many recipes but this was by far the worst I have ever made or ever tasted. It would never seemed to get done. And the taste was not that great either. It was flat and just simply awful.

It was definitely easy, but I was not really pleased with the final result.  It was more like a bread pudding in consistency, but more importantly the flavor was entirely unimpressive.  No more shortcuts for me.

Like many others, I have been using this recipe for years and years and added my own twist to it by adding spices. I don't put anything extra in the batter, I just sprinkle the top with cinnamon right before  baking.  I also smash the peaches through my fingers when putting the peaches in.  The butter is a must, in my opinion, it gives the crust a nice crunchy texture to compliment the the soft texture of the rest of the cobbler. Also, try a scoop of vanilla ice cream straight out of the oven......mmm, everybody loves this peach cobbler....'ala mode'...

Pretty good for being so easy.  Mine took a little more than 40 minutes to brown.  It might have been because my peaches weren't in heavy syrup.

I was so happy to find this recipe.  I had it over 30 yrs. ago.  I never wrote it down because it was so easy to remember. Never thought I would just forget about it.  I do reduce the sugar and milk to 3/4 cup each.  I also bake it in a casserole dish.  I now bake one at least once a week.  I have also used blackberries in place of peaches.

My grandmother from Texas gave us a recipe similar to this one.  We use 3/4 c. flour, 3/4 c. milk instead of the 1 c.  We also add 2 tsp. of baking powder.  I sometimes add a little cinnamon to the batter.  The cobbler tastes better with fresh peaches.  If you use fresh peaches...add a little sugar to the peaches and set aside as you mix your batter.

Make sure you use self rising flour and bake about 15 minutes longer.  My grandmother made fruit cobblers this way and she called it the 3 cup cobbler.  You can use any kind of canned or fresh fruit or berries

The recipe (including syrup) is way too wet. AI ended up cooking 60 minutes and it still didn't form a decent crust.

I didn't read the reviews first (I usually do and wish I had). While I need the extra butter for the calories for my mom, I had way too much liquid and drained off some after the cooking. I will add spices next time and put the peaches in first with a LOT less liquid.

I didn't have self rising flour, so I added a tsp and 1/2 of baking powder.  It turned out great!

This was a great cobbler. We made it at the cabin with the things we already had available.  Very easy and great with low-fat vanilla ice cream.

Very gooey. You might want to add about 15 minutes to the baking time, and perhaps add more flour.

My family loves peach cobbler so i tried this recipe. I also added cinimmon on top. It was great. It took a little longer to cook than it called for but turned out good. This was my first one.

We thought that this was a very good cobbler.  I added about a teaspoon of almond extract to the batter and it was great.  I even goofed by buying peaches in juice instead of syrup.  I added a little sugar to the juice to make my own syrup and the cobbler turned out great.

Add about ten or fifteen more minutes to the bake time. YUMMY! I never made any kind of cobbler. Both my husband and I enjoyed it.

Love the taste and simplicity of this recipe! I followed reviewer recommendations to mix the melted butter in with the other ingredients instead of pouring the butter into the pan first. I also put the peaches in the pan first and then poured the mixed batter over the peaches. The addition of cinnamon and nutmeg into the dry ingredients was the perfect added flavor. It all cooked up beautifully!! My family loves it, and I love how easy it can be made and with just a few basic ingredients!

Old time favorite - just like my Mom taught me.  I will, on occasion, sprinkle brown sugar and cinnamon on the top for the last 20 minutes of baking.  Thanks!

Thought this recipe was very good. Did add some cinnamon and thought it needed to cook a little longer.  It is hard to tell when the bottom is brown. But very tasty. My family loved it.

I reduced the sugar (3/4 c.) and butter (1/3 c.) and used peaches with light syrup, but I really loved the recipe and especially that it is so EASY and quick! I also love the crispy edges that come from the butter browned crust!

I've made it numerous times and it's always a hit everytime! It's just that easy. Only thing I added on my own was 1 teaspoon of baking powder in the flour mix . . That'll give it that perfect crust! Absolutely delicious!

Great recipe! Fast and easy.  I did take the advice of other reviewers.  1) I didn’t have self rising flour so added 2 teaspoons of baking powder to all purpose flour 2) I put peace’s on the bottom 3) I used only half the butter and added it to the flour mix  along with 1 teaspoon cinnamon, some nutmeg, and some vanilla and 4) I used a brown sugar and stevia mix instead of white sugar.    My husband really liked the addition of the nutmeg.

I have seen this recipe for years and always overlooked it, despite great reviews.  I just couldn't convince myself that it could possibly be any good.  Just too easy and it sounds as though it couldn't turn out "right".  Always figured it would be a "gloopy" inedible mess.  BOY WAS I WRONG!  Fantastic tasting fruit cobbler recipe, PLUS, it is super EASY!  Every time I make this, everyone raves about how wonderful it is, and I always get numerous requests for the recipe.  I love how versatile it is.  You can use any type of fruit, and you can use frozen, canned or fresh.  I love making peach and cherry.  Have also made blackberry and apple.  Add ice cream and it REALLY sends it over-the-top!

Well, most of the crust didn't rise above the peaches.  I used one 29 Oz. can of halves (which I sliced).  I poured the syrup in the dish, then added the peaches.

I've often heard of Peach Cobbler in American movies do was v looking forward to trying it. I was SO disappointed.  I followed the recipe exactly & although it cooked through it was very stodgy & overly sweet.  ?? I won't be making it again.

I really tried to like this! The cobbler came out like goop. The only "crust" was the bit at the top but the bottom was just goopy and tasted like flour. I followed directions step by step and am very upset with the results. Will not be trying this again. Good flavor (besides the flour) but could use lots of improvements!

This recipe is absolutely amazing. The only thing I did differently was I added the peaches (mine were in 100% juice and I drained about half of the juice) to the butter then poured the dough mixture over top of it. It was probably the best cobbler I've made yet and only took about 5 minutes to throw together.

I make this cobbler all the time as a base for any fruit cobbler. Peaches are not in season now so I used 3 Granny Smith apples, pealed and sliced and tossed with 2 tablespoon sugar.  When using some fruits, such as apples, I throw in a little nutmeg and cinnamon.  I also add a tablespoon vanilla.  Sometimes I thow berries in for extra punch.  Very adaptable recipe and so easy.

I really enjoyed this cobbler. Simple and tasty too! I followed the recipe steps but altered it slightly. I reduced the butter by 2 tablespoons and added a 1 teaspoon of almond extract to the melted butter in the pan. After I poured in the two cans of peaches I sprinkled the top with cinnamon. Delicious!!

I really liked this recipe. It is easy and you can make various substitutions without changing the basics of the recipe. For instance, I will add a bit of vanilla and cinnamon to the batter. I have also tried different types of fruit (like canned pineapple). Sometimes I will use coconut oil in place of the butter. However, the recipe if 5 stars because it is an excellent base to start from and good as written as well.

I love this recipe, and have made it several times.  It really doesn't get much easier!  I also add a little cinnamon to mine, as well as almost a cup of fresh blueberries.  (You could probably use thawed, frozen ones as well.)  DELICIOUS!

This is an old family favorite, my great grand mother passed it down.  For peach you really need to add cinnimon.  Switch off with cherries, apples, even blueberries and pinapple!  Always great! Can also used bisquick for the 1 cup of flour works great too.

Very disappointed.  I'm new to cooking/baking, so I wanted to follow the recipe as listed even though I saw comment after comment about different things that went wrong.  I should have listened!  

This was VERY BUTTERY, I mean my whole apartment smelled like butter for hours afterwards, sickeningly so.  The cobbler itself was inedible, there was just no way to get past the butter taste and smell.  

Also, as some other reviewers have pointed out this takes longer than 30-40 minutes to make.  When I took it out it was around an hour, and it still looked like it could use a few more minutes.

This was my first dud recipe. :\

I had jars of peaches that were 24 oz not the oz. called for.  Used that and it was fine.  Did not add the juice as it was light, not heavy. Maybe added a pinch more of spices, etc. to make up for it.  Yummy

This is by far the easiest and best peach cobbler I have ever made. I tweak it with water instead of milk and it still comes out perfect. I have made it for family events and everyone wants the recipe.

I added 1/2 teaspoon of Cinnamon and a shake of ginger like it was suggested in the other reviews. To make it sugar-free,  I added 1/4 cup of monk fruit sweetener to one half of the recipe and sugar to the other to make two cobblers, both were really good. I decreased the sugar to about 1/4 cup and it was still really good. I also didn't put any syrup from the peaches in because there was added sugar and it would make the cobbler soggy like some other people were saying.

I added half a cup of brown sugar to the butter.  An extra cup of flour and an extra half cup of milk to the recipe.  The edges caramelized the way I like it and it was much heartier.  Have saved to my recipe book!

If it's too easy, usually it's not good.  So the case here.  Too much butter that it's swimming,   Cobbler should be ooey gooey and this was more rubbery and one dimensional in flavor.

I made it . I live in the foot hills of KY . I'm a information technologist. But I love to cook. I added some fresh cinnamon and some fresh nutmeg. And a teaspoon of molasses. And a little bit more  flower. I use flower from are locally owned and operated mill .  also drained some of the liquid from the peaches. I also drank and added some (Woodford Reserve barrel proof)Kentucky Bourbon to it .  (This is Optional) but It was Love at First bite...

I switched up the milk measurements. Replaced with 3/4 cup of coconut milk and 1/4 half n’ half. 
Great tasting and it makes it a more spongey and lighter on the dough from the flour

I took a few suggestions from folks- mixing the butter into the batter, and adding cinnamon and nutmeg.  The nutmeg was really nice in it. Also, it was suggested to decrease the syrup amount, so I used the syrup from one can of peaches only.  I used an 8x11 baking dish and it baked beautifully at 55 minutes.   The moisture content was perfect.  This is quite sweet, so you won’t be eating a huge portion. And I did see where a few reviewers cut back on the sugar a bit. I agree with a few reviewers that stated that one could probably add more peaches if desired.

My gripes about this recipe are the amounts of sugar it calls for (seems way too sweet, next time I will use 1/2 c instead of 1 c.), the amount of butter,  and the amount of time the recipe took to cook. Baked the cobbler almost double the amount of time called for. Also I added cinnamon, only a few tbs. of butter and a few cups of frozen blackberries along with one can of peaches. Recipe was worth making and will probably make again! Very easy and delicious.

I made it healthier by using two 10 oz pkgs of frozen peachesl so no heavy syrup, but more fruit than crust. i cut sugar in half and used all organic products. My husband tolerates spelt products so I used instead of modern wheat flour. Spelt is an older version, unadulterated by man.Since spelt is not easily found in my pantry  in a self-rising version, I added one T. baking powder, aluminum and GMO  free, and a teaspoon of salt. I added vanilla, approx 1 tsp and cinnamon, approx 1/2 tsp, and used  lactose free milk. I actually browned the butter accidentally, by  multitasking more than I can do successfully. I noticed no harm; it may have added in the browning and helped the flavor.

Hello, 
             I'm 12 years old and I love to cook.  Making this was very fun.  No offense the picture of the peach cobbler looked disgusting.  I made it anyway and it was so tasty.  I did make a few changes when i made it, I cooked it for 40 minutes and added an extra 5 minutes.  Overall, the sweetness is perfect and I would definitely make it again and recommend it to other people.  Thank you for this nice experience.

The taste is great and this recipe is super easy, but the cook time is wayyyyy off. I ended up having to bake this for about an hour and 1/2 at 350° before it would even start to brown on top and thicken up.

Made is last night for a church Christmas party. There was nothing left over. Follow the directions so easy and came out so perfect. The only thing you have to watch is the cooking time took a little bit longer than what it said in the recipe other than that five stars all the way

I followed the preparation instructions, but I modified the contents somewhat and it was absolutely delicious!

6 tsp of unsalted butter (melted) - instead of 8
3/4 cup milk - instead of 1 full cup

I mixed the two cans of peaches (with syrup) in a bowl, with 1 dash of lemon juice, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp cinnamon and a dash of vanilla butternut extract. I poured that over the flour mixture and lightly sprinkled cinnamon on top. Baked for 40 minutes and my family devoured it in 10! : )

I did what other reviews said and added baking powder to all-purpose  flour instead of using self rising & also added the cinnamon & nutmeg. I did half dark brown & half granulated sugar...Just the southern girl in me that thinks brown sugar belongs in cobbler, I suppose. Took the advice of another reviewer & drained 2 of the cans of peaches, too. Definitely would've been too soupy if I hadn't! Mixed all the ingredients together & poured them over the peaches the pan. I baked mine in a 12" cast iron skillet so I doubled the recipe, though most, but not all of the topping would fit in the pan, for I had to leave room for rising. Had to bake at 375 at the end & for longer than time recommend for it to finish cooking through, probably due to the cast iron or the doubled recipe.  Everyone thought it was delicious, and it came out a little gooey and not too sweet. Just the way you'd want a peach cobbler to be! This is a keeper for for my  recipe book now!

Very simple and delicious dessert. I’ve made this three times in eight days!! Initially I prepared a peach cobbler, as written (except for adding my butter to my dough mixture as suggested by another review) for my husband. It was devoured in two days. Next, I made my “organic, anti-white sugar, health conscious” daughter one. I used 3/4 c. total of brown sugar and coconut sugar, 1/4 cup butter with strawberries and blackberries she had on hand. That cobbler was perfect and gone in 24 hrs. Then I was asked to make another for my daughters co-worker who had given birth. Needless to say any fruit can be used and you can reduce the sugar and butter without harm this recipe at all! A KEEPER FOR CERTAIN.

It was actually not even worth one star, I'm tossing it in the garbage - It's horrible - BUT - I changed the recipe. I used almond milk instead of whole milk. I wouldn't think that was enough to ruin it, the fruit is tasty, but the crust is rubbery, nasty, gross! 
So, I'm posting as a cautionary tale - NO SUBSTITUTIONS!

I’ve been making peach cobbler my entire life and this is the worse I’ve ever had. I followed the recipe exact (it’s not too complicated), I even made sure to use self rising flour. The batter stuck to the bottom and became clumpy and chewy. The peaches and syrup stayed at the top and just boiled! Typically when you have a recipe that calls for pouring the peaches and syrup on the top of the batter, the batter absorbs all or most of the liquid and naturally rises to the top. Something is very wrong with this recipe. I should have listened to the other negative reviews. What a waste or ingredients.

Taste Good! My family like it and kids love it. I also made it with apple filling too. Good with ice cream and whipped cream & caramel syrup. I made it a few times. I add a little cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves or all spices when neither is available

Not sure what happened, but I followed the recipe exactly, baked it for probably 50 minutes until the top was golden brown, and only the top portion was baked. There was maybe a half inch of baked batter, and everything under it was a thick soup with peaches. After I poured the two cans of peaches with the heavy syrup in last, I immediately felt like it looked like way too much liquid. Next time I try this, I will follow the recipe but definitely leave out all the syrup, and see if it turns out differently. For now, I’m really disappointed in how this turned out, and confused because I followed it exactly and got a way different outcome than others, it seems.

I doubled the recipe and added a sprinkle of cinnamon.  Plus, I didn't have self rising flour so I did the substitute for it .  Even with doubling and subtituting, it was delicious.  Definitely will be a keeper.  So easy!

If you don't have self rising flour and you add baking powder and salt to make it self rising, be sure you mix it together before you add everything else to mix....it will make or break this recipe lol after many failed attempts at this cobbler I finally did what I just explained, and BOOM amazing cobbler!!

I've made this to rave reviews for many years. It was too easy, I thought, so one summer, I tried many dessert recipes with peaches for friends who loved peaches.  Each time the response was that they couldn't understand why I wouldn't stick with this recipe, which they said was the best they'd ever eaten.  Sometimes, I do add blueberries. My recipe called for 1/2c milk and it was never enough - 1c is perfect..  Usually. I double the recipe and don't mix, but will try the reviewers'  mixing technique next time.

I will make this again! My family loved it. I made it for Memorial Day this year. My mom is asking me to make it again. It was the simplest dessert I think I've ever made and it taste like it took me the long route to make it but it took me all of six minutes to put it together but what I did do. I put my peaches in a pot with 1 1/4 cup of sugar the lemon juice the cinnamon the nutmeg and I used about a stick of butter. And I let that simmer for about 20 minutes until the sugar dissolved and then I poured that on top of the batter I did not Stir It and then I put another crust on top brushed it with a little butter and sprinkled it with sugar and I baked it at 350 for about 45 minutes. It was awesome! And it taste like it took me forever to make my family was so grateful it was great!

I mix ground cinnamon and sugar together and the. Sprinkle it on top before popping in the oven.  I also peel my peaches and mix with sugar on the stove top.  I would have used canned kind but had already bought the peaches.

This is the recipe that my mother used to make.  I couldn't remember it.   Thank you for adding it to Allrecipes.  So, I made this, as is, and gave it 5 stars.  The next time I made it I followed the recipe as written but added a couple of fresh peaches (I live in Georgia) for texture and freshness.  Yummy!

I made a few changes, one of which was based on another review and the other was my own change.  I melted the butter in my pan but then poured the butter in a bowl and added everything but the peaches.  Mix bowl ingredients and pour in pan.  Add DRAINED peaches on top, keeping juice.   Cook until golden brown.  Then, I poked holes in the cake and poured the peach juice over the top. OMG! Also, I didn't use the peaches in heavy syrup.  I used peaches in natural juices.  So good!!

I love this recipe. It's very simple and it tastes good as well. I used the all purpose unbleached flour with 2 teaspoons of baking powder, the milk, sugar etc...plus I added about 2 teaspoons cinnamon and a teaspoon of vanilla.. Very good!

It's delicious; however, when I made it, it came out too soupy. Unsure why. Used ingredients exactly. I would make again and rate it 5 if I could figure out what happened. Any ideas?

Made this with my mom and we followed the directions perfectly and it turned out terrible. It tasted great, a little sweet. But it had way too much butter in it, it didn’t set up right, and it stuck to my Pyrex dish SO badly. I will NOT be making this cobbler EVER again. I made it for a big dinner and was very embarrassed that it turned out so terrible.

This was the first time I had problems with a recipe from this website. I made it exactly like the directions said to and it came out looking nothing like the picture. It ended up being compared to a gummy bread pudding. The cake did not hug the peaches and instead just realized alone and the peaches were loose on the top

I halved this recipe for my small family of one (me).  In addition, I mixed together 1/2 teaspoonful cinnamon,  1/2 teaspoonful allspice , 1/4 teaspoonful nutmeg and 1 tablespoonful white sugar which I added to the peaches & syrup (15.25oz. can). I baked in a loaf pan for same amount of time. The spices are mixed together with sugar to prevent clumping when added to the liquid (syrup). Very tasty with ice cream on top. Mizzglow photo included.

The difference between "self rising" and "all purpose" flour should be acknowledged. Very greasy and did not raise to brown..

WAY too wet! I even drained the syrup from the peaches for less liquid. I think it was way too much butter and milk. ALSO, it took 70 minutes to cook, and it was still not brown on top. We only took a couple bites and threw the rest out. Bland, and just a peach cobbler fail.

It was easy, delicious, and a definite save recipe.  The only change I made was to sprinkle a cinnamon/sugar combination on the top.  Love the use of canned peaches, as this makes it a treat any time of the year.

I followed exact directions. After two hours of baking, it's still almost pure boiling liquid with no browning. Not even sure if I want to attempt to eat it.

I read several of  the reviews before making this. I doubled the recipe for the crust and added cinnamon and nutmeg. The flavor was good but too much crust. I will definitely try again but I will not double the crust but I WILL add the cinnamon and nutmeg to it and a bit of cinnamon to the peaches (also more peaches) and vanilla extract as noted by some. I had also baked the cobbler 35 minutes @ 350 and 15 minutes @ 400 which browned the crust nicely.

I can't believe how easy this is to make! And it works for pie filling, too. I just put up a pic of my blueberry cobbler. For that, i used 1 1/2 21oz cans of blueberry pie filling. I also revised this a little. For me, 1/2 a cup of sugar is plenty. Tha kind of evens out the vanilla ice cream I add because you've got to have ice cream with it! Also, for the peace cobbler, I add the 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamn, too. Plus, I don't have self rising flour so I add the two teaspoons of baking soda. I add the butter with other ingredients, put fruit on bottom and pour over it. 350 degrees for 30 minutes does not get it done. After that, I cook it for 15 minutes on 450 degrees. Comes out crispy on top and is delicious. So easy to make I have it weekly.

I goofed.  I thought I was cutting the recipe in half so I could use my favorite handmade pie dish, but I misread the recipe and used a large can of peaches (29ounces) instead of a small one.  Everything else I cut in half.  I put the batter in on top of the peaches and butter.   It looked beautiful, although I baked it for 55 minutes before the top set up.  The crust was, however, floating on a large pool of liquid.  I spooned off almost a cup of liquid after it was baked.  I did love the flavor, and did not find it greasy like some did.

So, I will make this again.  Next time I will drain the peaches but do everything else the same.  Even as far as using a large can of peaches, because I like the extra fruit.  

 I'm rating this five stars because it was in no way the fault of the recipe poster, and I can tell that next time it will be perfect.  It annoys me when people don't follow the recipe or goof it up somehow and then rate as one star.

I made this as per directions. I'm not sure what went wrong but it turned out a mess. It was in at 350° for 35 mins then I turned the heat up to 400 and cooked it an additional 40 minutes. So a total of  1hr 15min. It is bubbly and hot but there is way too much liquid and no crust that I can see at all. Yes, I used self rising flour. Disappointed as this doesn't appear edible and I was really craving peach cobbler. Not sure what I'm going to do with this peach soup.

This is actually very easy,  this is my first sharing  a review because of how simple the recipe is . I actually made my own self rising flour instead of buying it and reduced the amount of sugar in the dough along with using heavy cream instead of milk in the dough.   Making a few small changes really knocked up this dessert a notch.  Really awesome

Meh.  I wasn't impressed.  It took longer to cook than the recipe stated... the top of the crust didn't brown until it had been in the oven for  over 50 minutes.  I took it out and let it cool a bit, but it turned out the crust on the bottom was still under-cooked and gooey.  I will not be making this again.

My stepmom tried this recipe but didn't have self-rising flour, so she gambled and did it, anyway.  She had to scoop the peaches out so she could eat them.  I suspected baking powder would have helped, and confirmed this by looking at the reviews. My complaint about Allrecipe's site is the placing of "advertisements" WITHIN the list of ingredients. It makes it very easy to mess up the recipe when the ingredient list is broken up with advertisements! That might have led to some "fails" when making the recipe.

I used 3 cans of peaches in light syrup I drained 2 cans of the syrup but used the 3rd can with the syrup.  Also took an 8oz container of mascarpone cheese and dotted on top of the peaches.  It came out amazing

What an easy and delicious Peach Cobbler! Thanks for the recipe. I did take some other user's advice because I had all purpose flour instead of self-rising flour (added 2 tsp of baking powder to batter) and added nutmeg (1/4 tsp) and cinnamon (1/2 tsp) to the batter as well for some spice. I also liked the idea of another user to place the peaches  on the bottom of the pan because I love the breaded portion and didn't want it too gooey. For that, I mixed all the other ingredients including the melted butter to the batter mix and placed it over the peaches. 
Lastly, towards the end of baking (at 35 minutes in) I brushed on just a bit of melted butter over the cooked batter mix and crumbled some brown sugar and another pinch of cinnamon on top of that for the last few minutes. 
LOVED THIS RECIPE! Excellent results

The crust is too sweet, so you should cut the sugar down probably by half, and use a pinch of nutmeg as well along with the cinnamon. Ill make it again most likely with brown sugar,a little more butter, cinnamon and nutmeg.

Didn't have self-rising flour on hand so tried this with regular flour and it STILL came out delicious! Never made a cobbler before but this was truly quick & easy enough for someone like me. (The only reason I have a kitchen at all is because the apartment came with one...LOL). Thanx for this great recipe!

It was wonderful. My husband doesn't like his sweets too sweet (except for me), so I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup. Added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg.

The recipe says to pour batter in pan first.  That is wrong, as the heavy syrup just sits on top, making a leathery bottom crust.

my guests absolutely loved it!!! I added a bit of cinnamon to the dough mixture. I'll say, it did take about 25 minutes longer than expected to cook, but I may have just mixed it too hard.

It took one hour and 5 minutes before the cobbler was done.  It wasn't very good at all.  I will not be using this recipe again.

Me and my brother, mother entire family really was raised in the country and in a farm so these type of recipes is right up our ally. Thank you so much for sharing with us. Blessings to all of you!!!!

This is definitely my go to recipe when I'm in the mood for peach cobbler. As others has suggested, I usually add a little cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter. I little whip cream on top, delicious!

I've tried this recipe many times and I wasn't pleased only because I was draining the syrup off the peaches.  Baked this today, added the syrup and  a little ground cinnamon to the recipe and it's delicious, just the right sweetness.

Made it once as written but in 9X13 pan (all I had). Had to bake it about 50 minutes. Very tasty but too sweet for me. Second time used 2/3 cup sugar, added an additional 16 oz can of peaches, drained, and added 1 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg per other reviewers. Baked 55 minutes and mopped center slightly with folded paper towel at 50 minutes. Covered with foil and let set 30 minutes before eating. Whipped cream is OK, but served warm with vanilla ice cream makes it extra special.  I'll try adding vanilla next time and using part brown sugar. Even better after resting 24 hours.

Let me start of by saying the recipe was very easy to follow and the taste of the result was good.  But, even as I did exactly what the recipe told me to do, the ending result wasn't quite right.  The cobbler didn't take on the biscuity texture and was rather tough.  The peaches were wonderful, even though I ended up baking the cobbler for a total time of about 1 hr and 30 minutes, and it still wasn't done.  I wouldn't recommend this and I don't think I'll be making it again.

This is the best and easiest peach cobbler I have ever had IN MY LIFE! My family is crazy about it. Also, my little girl is just getting old enough that I can start showing her how to make some things. I helped her make this (she felt like she did it all by herself. lol) and she was so proud when her Papa liked it so much that he asked for a big scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. Thank you SO much for this  recipe!

It wasn't until I had this in the oven that I realized that I accidentally used peaches in fruit juice instead of syrup. I thought for sure that I had ruined it, but it came out okay. If I can mess it up and it still tastes pretty good. I imagine the real one is great!

Used whole wheat pastry flour, 1/2 cup sugar, 2tsp baking powder, 2/3 cup milk, 1/2stick softened butter stirred into batter, pinch of salt, and one can light syrup peaches in a square pan . Sprinkled cinnamon and nutmeg on peaches before batter. Turned out great! Not greasy or too sweet. Will make again.

This is the easiest and best cobbler I've made yet.  The only thing I did that it didn't call for was sprinkle the top with Cinnamon Sugar.  Delicious! ! As a matter of fact I've got another one in the oven now!

This is the quickest and easiest dessert I have every made, and I love it! I added nutmeg and cinnamon as others have suggested and it was wonderful! I also brushed the top before it was completely done with Brown Sugar Butter by Land O Lakes. Great addition. I know peach cobbler lovers and have made this three times in a couple of weeks.

Has become my go-to for a quick and versatile base recipe for all types of cobblers. I add some vanilla to the flour mixture. Last night I tried adding chocolate chips to the flour mixture and used canned peaches. I was experimenting and wasn't sure how this would turn out, but it was a hit! So have fun with this base, quick and easy base recipe for cobbler.

I used a 9x9 glass pan. I put the fruit in 1st and mixed everything else. I also added cinnamon on top. Great recipe! I'm making it now for the 3rd time in 2 wks! It works with pie filling too if you don't have sliced fruit ;-)

Thought I would try this easy recipe for my first time making peach cobler. It was so greasy and buttery that nobody ate it. The crust didn't really cook well and was very doughy. Sorry but wouldn't use this recipe again.  (Made it twice.. same result both times.)

Quick and easy,I doubled the recipe on everything other than the butter,instead of doubling it to one cup i just used 3/4 cup and it was plenty.i did have to tinfoil the edges to avoid them over browning and give it an extra 15 minute to brown up in the middle.

I do not know why this recipe has such high ratings. The crust does not cook right. The only way to describe it is wet. Cobbler isn't supposed to be wet. It's essentially supposed to be cake like biscuits with a fruit topping, however this mess was a lake of buttery liquid on top a wet crust piled with peaches that looked the same going in than when put in. I will not use this recipe again. I'm very disappointed.

So easy and turned out great...plus I had everything on hand (using all purpose flour and baking powder) and added the nutmeg, cinnamon and brown sugar that other reviewers suggested. I used two 15-oz cans of peaches in juice (I never buy in syrup) and the juice from one can was plenty. I also threw in a container of raspberries because I had some. I accidentally baked at 400 for 15 minutes, then discovered my mistake and finished baking at 350 for 20 minutes...plus about 3 minutes under the broiler to get the top brown. Took it to a family dinner and it was gone!

I used 1.5 teaspoon baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon salt, after searching for substitutes, and that worked great.

 Needs 1/4 teaspoon each of cinnamon and nutmeg.  Without that it deserves to lose a star.

 Still, an absolutely awesome recipe.  I'll try some others  but won't expect them to be much superior to this one.  (Or more accurately, what this one made me improvise.)

This is the "CuppaCuppaCuppa" recipe my father used to make Dutch Oven Cobbler over our campfires when I was young. Works wonderfully in the oven. Don't be afraid to add 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and 1/4-1/2 tsp vanilla extract. If you choose not to melt butter in the pan as directed, you'll want to grease your pan or spray with non-stick cooking spray. Also, add white raisins and crushed walnuts to make this a super-special dessert (about 1/4 cup each, to taste).

This was a fantastic cobbler...I used the exact recipe, but I used Southern Biscuit self rising flour, I also added a tablespoon of cinnamon to the flour mix...I"m a cinnamon lover...after pouring in the peaches, I added more cinnamon on top and also sprinkled the top with brown sugar...It came out great, although it took an hour to brown nicely...might have been the biscuit flour, otherwise very very tasty.

In the past 3 weeks I've made this recipe 4 times! Birthday, church, daughter's new house and taught my 12 year old grandson! It's easy, fairly quick, and delicious! I did make a change - I added about a tablespoon of cinnamon sugar to the "dough" which we all felt enhanced the flavor! I've used canned peaches, fruit cocktail, and scalloped apples - all have been big hits! Yummers!

This is so easy and my husband's favorite.  Our friends love it when they stop by last minute and I can have an incredible dessert ready in 45 minutes.  I love it with cherry pie filling but peach is also a favorite.

Simple and good. It isn't as thick as other cobblers but it's still good. I like my cobbler to be more bread like than anything. If you're the same way then you should drain the peaches as much as possible.

Love this cobbler.  I sprinkle cinnamon, nutmeg, and brown sugar over the top right before I put it in the oven, and it turns out awesome every time. But, really? It has a whole stick of butter in it! Of course its going to be delish.

It was amazing I made them in miniature mason jars for a school bake sale and they were great!
I made 8 and it took about 40 minutes to brown and with the leftovers made a full size peach cobbler!

I made this and my daughter and grandsons loved it. I did add cinnamon and nutmeg.  That was my first peach cobbler I ever made.  I will be using the recipe every time. I did put the peaches in the pan first , then the batter and the butter on top. I read the negative reviews and they are wrong. Mine came out great and I am very critical about cooking.

When I made it the first time, the crust never rose and it was very soupy. The 'crust'  became a very rubbery bread substance. I ended up discarding this one.

HOWEVER, when I went and got some new baking powder and remade the recipe, the peach cobbler was AMAZING. I took the advice on adding nutmeg and cinnamon to the batter.  Thank you!

Love this recipe. I have one similar but milk wasn't added. I tell you one thing. My family LOVED IT!!!!.  I change some things in the directions. I put the stick of butter in the batter, instead of melting it. I used can milk because my grandson drunk all the milk with his cereal. Also, I sprinkled a mixture  of light brown sugar,white sugar and butter on top.  Boom!!!!... Thanks for the recipe.  My family demanded me to stick to this one and throw the other one away.

This is some great easy cobbler but I added a little vanilla, lemon and orange Zest. Made it perfect for friends and family. I don't measure and cook a just add to taste. I also use more sugar and very little syrup. First time I made it the cobbler stayed to wet and mushy. That's the reason for 4 not 5 stars.

WeIl,  I followed the recipe but the crust would not rise. After 30 mins I decided to take it out and make some extra crust, (1 cup of flower, sugar and milk)  which I added to the pan before I added the peaches. Now we have rising crust!!!!! Cook for nearly an hour till crust is golden brown...... Also added cinnamon which was a nice touch!

Instead of putting the butter into the pan I mixed it into the batter. I also put in the peaches first and then put batter over top of it. And lastly I didn't pour in any syrup....I just made a layer of peaches at the bottom of the pan. I also used an 11x8 glass pan and baked for 37 minutes.

This recipe is very easy and I love it.  I have added nutmeg and cinnamon along with lemon extract and almond extract to enhance the favor but this is a hit every time with parties and events.  People ask for the recipe all the time so I'll continue using it as it's quick and appears to be a recipe you slaved over.
