Chef john is right. Butterflying those prawns is a PAIN. I don’t have a mortar so I put my garlic and herbs in a plastic bag and pressed and rocked the flat  side of  my meat tenderizer over the bag until they were mush.  Worked great. The breadcrumb mixture was so good.   I subbed melted butter for the oil.  Kids RAVED.  Loved this one.

I used this for shrimp as well as fish. I coated the fish with mayonnaise and then put breading on it. Also added fresh rosemary. Super good!!!

I have loved Asian foods forever, and I love using Chinese mustard as an “optional” dip whenever I serve these!  Converted a lot of friends to the more savory options when eating seafoods!  One thing I do first, is to devein shrimp with a toothpick prior the butterflying.  It’s something I was taught to do in Culinary School 50 years ago.

I have made this several times now and it is just DELICIOUS! when I'm feeling lazy I don't butterfly the shrimp and just coat them whole.  Works just as good and saves a ton of time!

I made these last night with BC spot prawns. Great flavour. 
They looked impressive and tasted the same.

“Just they way it is!” Taste, texture, time, triumph! We hosted an early evening with our friends for 25 years and we all hail from coastal cities, Seattle, San Fransisco, San Diego. The crown of delight goes to the Prawn  Provincial !! Thank you Chef John. As I was performing the tedious slicing surgery I laughed out loud as I recalled Chef John said “only 100 more to do!!!” I was relieved to know I only had about 25. Taste, texture, timing = triumph. We had some crab stuffed salmon steaks and the Prawn Provincial...and the Prawns captured the flag. We’ll do it again and again.
Patrick

This is so easy and so delicious.  Butterflying the shrimp is not a big deal.  We have this as a main entree and not an appetizer.  Followed the recipe exactly.

Perhaps I used too much breading, but to us, it overpowered the shrimp.
