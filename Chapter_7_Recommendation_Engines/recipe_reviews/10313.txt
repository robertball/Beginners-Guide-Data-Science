This recipe as is, only rates a 3, as it would be pretty bland; however, with a few other ingredients to spice it up, it has the potential to be a 5.  Therefore, I gave it a 4.    I added a 2nd egg per some other suggestions as well as 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, 1/4 tsp of nutmeg, a dash of ginger, and 2 tbsp of white sugar.    They were actually very good.  My 16 year old raised his eyes at the carrots, but ate a couple and said that they would have been better with some chocolate, but otherwise were pretty good.  My 7 year old turned her nose up at the carrot cookies, but after I forced her to try one, she sheepishly ate every last crumb, and my 2 1/2 year old ate 3 and said "delicious!".    With the addition of the spices, these were not bland at all.  I cooked them for 14 minutes and they were not dry at all either, only light and fluffy and yummy... although I may sneak in some semi-sweet choco chips next time instead of the 2 tbsp of sugar.

These cookies were horrible! I even tried adding cinnamon, nutmeg and lemon zest, and that didn't help

I thought this was a very nice cookie. I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfectly.The texture was light and so was the flavour but thats not to say that they weren't tasty. 

The lack of sugar is a definite plus.

I think the problem is you just need an extra egg. That should solve the problem since the batter was too dry. However, I just added some milk and i used 1/3 cup of brown sugar and 1/4 cup of white sugar since I didn't have honey and mine turned out really good. But maybe next time I'll just use 2 eggs and see how it turns out.

I gave this four stars because my kids liked these cookies, but only with modifications.  It's hard for me to get excited about a cookie unless it has chocolate in it.  Per other user's suggestions, I added cinnamon, nutmeg, another egg, a little applesauce, and 4 tablespoons of sugar just to make sure it was sweet enough for the kiddies to enjoy.  I did have to add more flour to make the consistency thicker.    Even with all these additions they were still somewhat bland, but tasty enough for my kiddos to enjoy which was all that mattered to me anyways.  If you want something that is healthy and not overloaded with sugar, with the right modifications this might be the cookie for you!

With so much butter, sorry they are for sure delicious but quite far from healthy. Honey is healthy but in this amount is also a lot of sugar

I like this recipe. I was looking for a healthy cookie to make for my 2 1/2 year old cookie monster. I added cinnamon, a handful of quick oats and some applesauce. They turned out really good. He loved them!

I will say this recipe has potential. I did as some suggested and used 2 eggs instead of one. They were not dry at all. I also put in 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg as someone else recommended. I didn't have any lemon extract, but I had orange zest, so I put in about a tsp of orange zest. Still kinda bland. Maybe more cinnamon? More sugar would also help. But part of the reason I made these is because I don't have any white sugar or brown sugar in the house! These will be good for my first grader to take to school for his mid-morning snack.

ok cookies, probably will never make again.  I added 3 tablespoons of sugar, an extra egg and cinnamon, and they still don't have much flavor.

My kids enjoyed these the night we baked them but haven't asked for them since.  They're rather bland, possibly some cinnamon next time?  They were on the puffy side, they didn't bake down at all.  Also a little dry.

Excellent cookie. I substituted orange extract in place of the lemon extract. I also used store bought shredded carrots (I chopped the shreds into shorter pieces). I did not sift the flour (I never do) and I used only a dash of salt. I like the simplicity of this recipe.

These were okay.  I swapped out half of the flour for whole wheat, and changed nothing else.  They were good, but not very sweet.  The honey was good, but didn't make them much sweeter than, say, scones.  So, they were nice with coffee for the folks in the office.  I don't know that I'd make them again, but they were fun and different.  Agree that they need some more spices or something.  Perhaps some cinnamon or nutmeg or something.

These are pretty good for being healthy. I added 1 teaspoon orange extract instead of the lemon, and a teaspoon of cinnamon. The first batch turned out to be pretty lumpy, so I smoothed them out really well before I put them in the oven, and those turned out nice and pretty. I think these woud also be good with some rasins.

I usually don’t modify recipes I find on here, but this time I wanted to try it because honey cookies sounded so good. After reading the comments I added an extra egg and some spices. As much as I wanted to keep sugar out, I added about 1/2 T. They come out soft, and puffy. So I told my kids they were Pooh bears favorite honey cakes and they gobbled them up. Definitely don’t have as much flavor as I would have hoped, but they work for healthier ‘cookies’!

I was out of sugar, this recipe solved my problem deliciously. I did add 1/2 cup of coconut sugar, and a tablespoon of cinnamon... oh, and harvest sprinkles.

This recipe requires a bunch of tweaks, but it's a good beginning. I added an extra egg, a tsp. of cinnamon, a tsp. of nutmeg, and about two Tbsp. of fresh ginger. I also added 1/4 c raisins, 1/2 c walnuts, and 1/2 c oats. Additionally, I used 10-grain flour. The result was amazing cookies with a nice, fluffy texture and complex flavors.

I made these especially for my 1 year old and her daycare friends so the lack of sugar was great. I substituted apple sauce for the honey however and added some cinnamon.

I made these cookies and added an aditional egg, cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger. They were awesome. My whole family enjoyed their light and fluffy texture along with their lemony taste.  I thought they were great without any added sugar or chocolate :)

I read the reviews before I made these so I knew what I was getting into.  They are definitely cakey and not very cookie like. I like the lemon flavor and will probably add a little more the next time I make them.  They are kinda healthy (as a cookie goes)  I entered the recipe into my fitness pal and each cookie came out like this (I got 36 cookies and not the 4 dozen above): Calories 73 Carbs 5	Fat 4 Protein 0 Sugar 4 Chol 10

Adjusted this to be gluten free by substituting 2 cups Bob's Redmill Gluten Free All Purpose Flour and 1/2 cup flax meal, also had to substitute some agave syrup for honey, grated frozen lemon for extract, and added ground sage, cinnamon and nutmeg to taste. So cannot rate recipe as is, but it was a great launching pad for a healthy toddler approved cookie. Great way to sneak in veggies for a gluten intolerant child who refuses them. Next time I will sub coconut oil for butter.

Good, but I did read the reviews. I added cinnamon, nutmeg, 2T sugar and shortened the baking time. Even kids liked them.

These are okay, a good way to hide carrots for my toddler but not an exceptional recipe.
