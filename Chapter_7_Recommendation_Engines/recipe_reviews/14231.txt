Yum!  This was my first attempt at making gauc and I was not let down by the high rating on this recipe.  I adapted it a little to my taste by adding more cilantro and garlic and adding some ground cumin.  When choosing your avocados choose ones that are blemish free and have a slight give when squeezed lightly.  There are so many different varities that color is not a good indication.  Sure this has a lot of fat in it, but it's the good fat that our bodies need to keep are skin supple and our joints lubricated (tell that to my hips!)!

07/07/08 Update
I just had to update my review on this recipe.  My first review was the first time that I had made this recipe - now I am known for my guac!  I don't use a recipe any more, but it is similiar to this.  I think the key to delicious guac is lots of garlic and a lot of lime juice.  The lime juice does more than flavor the quac - it keeps it from turning brown.  I also add jalepenios (sp?) seeded, ribbed and finely chopped for a little heat.  Another thing I add is some cumin - one of my favorite spices.  Teh quac I make is chunky, but chunky from the tomatoes, onion and peppers - the avocado I make very smooth.  You don't want to make this too soon as some discoloration can occur.  I have made it the night before and it's fine but I prefer to make it a few hours before hand.  That way it stays nice and fresh but the flavors have time to marry.  Regardless of when you make it always flatten the top surface smooth and squirt the jui

I line in Arizona and my husband and I both love guacamole. We've eaten guacamole too many times to count and have made it countless times before. WE BOTH LOOOOVED THIS RECIPE! I followed the recipe exactly and it was THE BEST GUACAMOLE I EVER MADE! My husband is picky about salsa and guacamole, due to his grandmother who makes everything so awesome, but he even said this was the BEST ONE YET! MUST TRY!!! I WILL ONLY MAKE THIS GUACAMOLE FROM NOW ON! Thanks!

This was excellent!!  When I can find ripe avacados at Costco, I buy them because they come 5 to a package and that's cheaper than buying them individually.  I scaled the recipe down (using only 1 avacado) because it was just me eating this. Instead of chopping up the onions and garlic, I used onion and garlic powder.  In my opinion, they taste just as good and are much quicker.   I also added a spoonful of salsa to mine.  I love eating this alone with chips or as a side dish to my lunch or dinner.  Thanks for sharing.  Will definitley make again!!

Great Guacamole! This was everything guacamole should be: smooth and creamy with just the right amount of flavor. Nothing overpowering, nothing artificial, no jarred salas or other oddities to make it some sort of "creation". I de-seeded the tomatoes, used red onion and added a little more than 1/4 tsp. of cumin - it went great with warm tortilla chips! This recipe is a definite keeper for sure!!!

Awesome taste!  It took me longer than 10 minutes to prepare, but it might be that I am just slow at chopping and cutting.  Also, be wary of over mashing the avacado - I thought I didn't like it chunky, but smooth becomes kinda soupy.  With the whole lime, this doesn't turn brown for over 24 hours in a sealed container.  Best to eat immediately (or after chilled for an hour), lots of liquid pools in it after a couple days. UPDATE:  Do not freeze this to use at a later time ... the consistency is just strange after thawing and the flavors change.  Still the best Guac, though. :)

Thank you for a great addition! :D

Delicious. NOTES: *I leave out the tomatoes and serve pico de gallo alongside. On the rare occasion there are leftovers, mixed-in tomato makes the guacamole go off faster. Same amount of work, just throw the tomatoes in a separate bowl and toss some extra onion, chili, cilantro, and lime. *Lime acts like salt on the palate, so add salt after the lime juice; you will end up using less. *I always add some ground toasted cumin seed and a seeded jalapeno. *Great with and without garlic. *Reserve half the avocado chunks to add at the end for textural variety. *The most important thing, though, is to use ripe avocados. Buy them a day or 2 beforehand, then let them sit in a brown paper bag on the counter with a ripe apple, pear, or bananas until the avocados are softer. *If the avocados aren't perfectly delicious, I add a little extra virgin olive oil to the mix.

Excellent! My husband loved it! Fresh Cilantro is a must(.70 cents a bunch). We like chunkier style Guacamole so mashed two of the avocados & chopped the third into very small pieces. These pieces will mush up alittle as you stir in other ingredients, but still give it alittle chunk. If it is still too chunky you can mash it alittle with back of spatula. I will use this recipe on a regular basis. Thanks!

The "best" guacamole being purely subjective, in my book this comes pretty darn close. I added a finely chopped jalapeno pepper, 1/2 tsp. cumin and salt to taste rather than measuring out a teaspoon.  I removed the seeds and pulp from the tomato to make sure I wouldn't end up with it making the guacamole watery and just as a matter of personal preference I cut back on the cilantro, a taste for which we are slowly acquiring.

Wow, way too much salt! I think it could have been good with just a 1/2 tsp of salt.  I even used 4 avocados instead of the three mentioned in recipe.

This absolutely ROCKS!  I have been making various forms of guacamole since I was a youngster in Texas, and I have never found one with so much robust flavor and kick.  Follow the recipe!  You won't be disappointed.  I think one of the keys is mashing the avacados with the salt and lime prior to the other ingredients.  It helps to meld the flavors, and prevents the the guacamole from going brown.  The cayenne adds a nice kick with just a pinch, so use with discretion.  The only thing I will mention is that I used sweet vidalia onions which are readily available this time of year on the east coast.  Other onions might make it too "oniony."  Thanks for a great recipe!  I'll be using this one many times to come!

Great. Everyone loved this guacamole. I used only 2 tablespoons of cilantro though and I used 4 avocados and 2 cloves of garlic. Tip: keep the avocodo pits in with your guacamole to keep it green. You can either remove them before serving or keep in for a conversation piece.

I used to work at a Mexican resturant where I had to make gaucamole at guests table (cheezy, i know)..... People would tell me that they drove 25 min out of their way ect ect..... just for the gaucamoli.  The recipe is almost the same, except we'd use 2 avocados, RED onion (not yellow- yuk), and diced jalepenos.  We didn't use garlic or pepper, but they sound like good additions.  Can't forget the jalepenos!

I personally like mine with a little extra veggies.  yum!

Best Recipe EVER!!!!!  Wouldn't change a thing.  To prevent browning, use lime juice to sit over the top of the dip until serving.

Yum!  I used powdered onion and garlic to get the flavour but not the texture, one drained can of diced tomatoes with garlic and onion instead of the fresh tomatoes and a dash a cumin.  Oh...and I kept the pits in the container with the guacamole to keep it from turning colour.

This is the first time I made guacamole, and it turned out very well.  Unfortunately I couldn't buy the avocados in advance, as suggested by other reviewers, and I didn't realise that green avocados are far too under-ripe for this recipe.  I had to go out again to find one which was black on the outside.  Even that one was barely ripe enough.  The recipe still turned out well, though!

I made this for a Super Bowl party and everyone loved.  It is so easy and very good. I do not even like guacamole that much but this one is really good.  I only added a little more garlic than the recipe calls for.  I suggest allowing it sit in the refrigerator for several hours.  I made it the night before and it was great.  This is a definite keeper.

This is by far the best guacamole recipe I have tried. I put the peeled avocado and the onions in a food processor to finely chop.  I recommend using Haas avocados, and I highly recommend this recipe.

This has become "my guacamole recipe" which I've been using for about 3 years. Shhh, cause I don't tell people! Seriously, I make it for EVERY single party and bbq I host, and most I attend. Each time, people say "wow, you make amazing quacamole." If they only knew how simple it is. The only advice I have is:
1. People tend to like it more when the avocado is a bit chunkier, so don't over mash.
2. You can't use too much lime juice. Seriously. Keep adding more till it tastes perfect.
3. Ripen those avocados in a brown paper bag  off-season. They'll taste a bit more summery that way.

This was great other than being a little too salty.  Next time I probably won't add any salt, especially if I have salted chips.

This was very good.  I almost ate up all the guacamole before my guess arrived. LoL!!  Instead of using the ground cayenne pepper, I chopped up a jalapeno pepper.  I did use a little fresh cilantro, and a red onion other than that I pretty much stuck to the recipe.

I am very picky about my guac, this is the BEST. Follow recipe exactly & it's fantastic. **Save the seeds from avocado to put back in dip to be refrigerated, it keeps it from browning **THANK YOU!

Moving from the deep South (US) to Canada, I truly miss my Tex-Mex food.  This is a great recipe and I use it often!  If I do not have fresh tomatoes, I use a chunky salsa and it really works well!

Absolutely delicious, but definitely took more than 10 minutes prep time! More like 30 minutes (I doubled the recipe) due to the chopping of the tomatoes, cilantro, onion, garlic. But well worth it - this guacamole is very tasty! I would recommend more lime juice to give it extra kick.

Wow - Wow - WOW!  This is one of the best recipes I have ever made.  I've never really like gaucamole but this sounded so interesting I had to try it!  I took the advice of other reviewers and used alot of lime juice - 3 small limes to be precise - tons of garlic, probably about 3 heaping teaspoons and I did 4 avocados.  I put an overflowing tablespoon of chopped fresh cilantro in and  I used canned diced tomatoes because I forgot to buy fresh and it was ultimate perfection.  My mother in law who is the pickiest eater and my sister in law who has food allergies couldn't stay away from it.  It was amazing!

This guac is the new love of my life!  It reminded me of the stellar table-side guacamole featured at the best Mexican restaurants here in NYC.  Next time I make it I will cut the amount of salt in half (at least), but I wouldn't change anything else!  This is a 10-star recipe!  Muy delicioso- gracias :)

Perfect! I tend to use quite a bit more lime juice, and cut back just a tad on the tomatoes. I have to have the onion diced really, really fine too. I have made with and without cilantro, and have no preference. Both very good. Thanks. :)

Good but...It needs way more than a pinch of cayenne. I also added many pinches of cumin and chili powder. Leaving the pits in are a must! And I also added a few teaspoons of mayo. I always do with guacamole because it keeps the color and gives it a little creaminess. You make these changes and its the PERFECT guacamole!

This guacamole was quite good but I did wish I hadn't added an extra ingredient which was CUMIN. If you don't want to eat anything that smells like BODY ODOR than I advise you to NOT USE CUMIN. I only used a pinch of cumin and the smell was still there. It reminded me of Indian food (since they use a lot of cumin and other spices) I followed the recipe and added some pepper flakes for spice (like the one you shake onto pizza) but you can use actual peppers too :D to me I thought the cumin ruined it a bit but I guess if you're a fan of cumin then go ahead and try it.

I used this as a base recipe and adapted it to the ingredients I had on hand. Delicious...however I don't have lime juice so it's a race to eat it before it turns brown. Definately something I want to continue tweaking! Thanks a bunch!

I've always thought this recipe was the best guacamole I'd ever had. One day I made this for an office party. Now, I'm a gringo living in Latin America, but everyone in the office RAVED about it. It quickly disappeared, and our Ambassador (a Puerto Rican) devoured it, claiming it was the best he'd ever had. Glad to see I'm not the only one who feels that way!

I didn't change a thing except for the fact that I only had one ripe avocado, so I scaled the recipe back. It was perfect and exactly what I was looking for to go on a taco salad tonight...if I can stay out of it!

Excellent guac! The cilantro really makes it. I definitely agree with the reviewer who suggested leaving it overnight before eating. The flavors are so much more intense.

I love guacamole, but this recipe went so wrong. Yes, I followed the recipe as written, so I know I made no mistake. Like other reviewers, the lime made it kind of watery and soft. Second, there was too much onion. All I could taste was onion! Also, it was a bit salty. Maybe some people like their guacamole salty, watery, and onion-y, but not me. Sorry.

I have made this a couple of times now, I pretty much stayed with the recipe closely, though I never really measure anything. I did add 1/2 lemon juiced and only 1 plum tomato. The lemon added a little extra zing and flavor.  Definitely the best guac I have ever had and actually 2 or 3 people have told me the same exact thing. This includes my foodie fiance who made said it tasted soo fresh and flavorful that Gordon Ransey would be proud :)
GREAT RECIPE!!

Very good, but I don't use the ground cayenne pepper--- I chop up a jalapeno or a serano pepper.

So good.  Just got done making this because I have been so hungry for guac.  I found this recipe and decided to try it because of the high ratings.  It is perfect.  I didn't add as much cilantro as I should have because I didn't have that much.  But it was still good.  I also added 4 avacados because mine were kinda small.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!

I made this for Christmas, specifically for my dad, who loves guacamole (I do not).  He LOVED it and could not stop eating it! Thanks for the recipe.  It was pretty simple and I will make it again.

This was so easy to make!  Great flavor with lots of zing.  I have made many guacamole recipes in the past, but this is surely the winner and the one I will be making from now on.   Just fantastic.

Don't think I can ever do store bought guacamole again!  This recipe was perfect.  I did not have any limes and used 2 tbsp lime juice instead.  I will try adding some diced jalapeno next time for a little kick.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This is a very good recipe. I added some fresh ground black pepper and I ended using lemon juice instead of lime (didn't have any on hand), plus I used a bit more salt than the recipe calls for, but I suppose that goes back to personal taste. Definitely a winner!

This guacamole was delicious- better than many restaurants!  I made it for a football party and it got rave reviews from everyone.  

I made a couple of changes.  First, I used 5 avocados.  I mashed up 3 of them and diced the other two for a more texture.  I used red onion, and I only used about 1/3 cup.  I added more cayenne than called for, and next time I am going to add jalapeno for some added kick.  This is my new guacamole recipe.  Thank you!

I've made this several times.  It is by far the best guacamole recipe I've tried.  To keep from turning brown too quickly, I make sure to use enough lime AND lemon juice.  After preparing the guacamole, I place the pits in the bowl w/ the dip.  I press plastic wrap (side that has contact w/ dip rubbed w/ lemon juice) against the dip surface, removing any air pockets.  You will be amazed at how long it will stay looking a fresh, vibrant green.

BEST!!! This guac is awesome! I make my avocado creamy and chop everything fine. The key is lots of lime juice and salt. Mine I ate on for 4 days and still had a bright green color. Cant add too much lime juice and the more salt the more flavor comes out! This is the only guac I will now make!

This guacamole is one of the best I have tasted. I use kosher salt and probably add more than the recipe calls for, it brings out all of the flavors. I also add a nice handful of cilantro- when it comes to cilantro you can never have too much!  If you are going to add the onion I would recommend using a red onion because I think it goes better with these flavors but I found a half a cup to be overpowering.

This is a great recipe. It's very easy to make, so easy my husband made it by himself!!! He is the type to burn mac and cheese from the box. He added a little bit more salt and omitted the tomatoes because I don't like them. Plus we thought they could make the dip watery because we were making a lot to last a couple of days. I think we'll make this for superbowl!

Loved this!  If you like it spicy, I would use a LOT of cayenne pepper.  Don't be afraid to use the entire juice of the lime.  The salt cuts it.  Thank you Bob Cody!

I was really excited about this b/c of all the great reviews but it turned out disappointing!  Way too salty and the lime juice overpowered the bowl.  I will try to make it again without all the salt and hopefully update my review with something positive.

LOVE LOVE LOVE this! I usually don't follow a recipe when I make guacamole. But I saw this one with 5 stars and had to try it! I loved it so much! It was a huge hit at dinner last night. I will now always make this guacamole! The cayenne pepper adds a nice kick. The consistency was perfect!

Excellent! Best with corn chips but also great as extra topping for taco's, burger's or whatever. I do prefer mine a little chunky so I don't mash my avacado's into baby food. I did cut down on the salt a bit, (personal preference) and it was simply perfect. Thanks for the great recipe Bob!

This is the best guacamole we have ever had!  My dad, aunt and I only use this recipe.  I add a little more cayenne and garlic but besides that it is spot on!  Thank you, Bob!

Tastes just like the guacamole that we loved from a Mexican restaurant in Hawaii... so fresh and good! We made it "chunky" and upped the lime to 1.5 limes and 1.5 teaspoons miced garlic. It was PERFECT!

Definitely the best guac I've had.  I adjusted the salt (about 3/4 tsp) and it was still a bit salty to me.  Next time I'll only use about 1/2 tsp.  Other than that, it was perfect!

I actually make this guac recipe all the time and my husband and I absolutely love it! Tip: Follow the ingredient amounts to a T because if you play around with them too much, it will disappoint.

This was a great recipe. I added one seeded, diced jalepeno and a 1/4 teaspoon of cumin. I got the idea from ofther recipes that i had read. This was my first time making guac. My wife doesn't like guac. She's used to getting it from Mexican resteraunts, but she loved mine. It was a little chunkier than you would get from a resteraunt. I think that makes it better. I reckon i'll be on guac making duty quite often now. Great Recipe.

This is the first guacamole recipe I ever tried, I served the nachos with salsa and another store bought dip and I swear no one touched the other two but most of the guacamole was gone.   I would make it again! Even my fiancé who hates most veggies ate it!

We love this guacamole recipe! I was in a super huge hurry one day and was just going to pick some guac up at the store but after having this one I couldn't do store bought. I bought all the stuff for this one and made it anyway!

Best Guacamole I've ever made! The only thing I changed was only doing 1/2 lime instead of the full lime. I tried it with the full lime and it was way too citrus-y

This guac was absolutely delicious. I couldn't stop eating it!  I used lime juice from the bottle and dried cilantro.  Definitely tastes better the next day, after all the flavors have a chance to marry.

This recipe made a great guacamole my friends and family finished off.  The avocado must be ripe, though, so buy it a few days early and leave it out on the counter until good and soft.

Great! I made this without the tomatoes but everything else exactly as written. Very creamy and a big hit at a family dinner. I kept one pit in the bowl and it didn't turn brown.

Excellent recipe. For a bit more flavor, I added a package of McCormick's guacamole dip seasoning. Also used the juice from 2 limes. Perfect!

I can always count on this recipe. Easy, simple, and delicious. We liked ours chunky, finely chopped red onions, either fresh or bottled limes, and one more tomatoes than it calls for.

this was my first time making guacamole and I think it came out delicious! However, I don't think it tasted like guacamole, but rather another type of dip. Unfortunately, one of my avocados was rotten, so I had to scale down the recipe for 2. In doing so, the lime and garlic became overwhelming. I did add cayenne and cumin, and what resulted was pretty good, just a little heavy in onion and lime, but maybe I didn't dice the onion small enough.
ETA: I've made this many times. I add a little more tomato than it calls for, plus cayenne and cumin, and it is so delicious!

AMAZING!!! We loved it. I used 5 avocados, and we ate it all within the week. Used it on turkey burgers, in ham and cheese wraps, with chips, you name it!! Just delicious, and SOOO much better than any kind of store bought mix.

This was the first time I made guacamole and it turned out great. Even had enough to take to work and share with my co-workers. Everyone who tried it thought it was fantastic. Thanks Bob.

I used this recipe for a football party appetizer.  I always get nervous to use a recipe for guests without trying it myself first.  I made this recipe as is, but added about a half tsp red pepper flakes.. we like things spicy... it was awesome & everyone loved it.  I then used the same recipe for our Christmas party, and everyone who ate it was raving.  You cannot go wrong with this one!  Thank you!!!

This was my first attempt at guacamole and since it was rated so highly I thought I'd give it a try. I followed the directions exactly except that I added  2-3 tbsp of sour cream. (I doubled the recipe because it said 4 servings but the doubled recipe fed 13 people with a fair amt left over). Anyways I took it to a church gathering and got a lot of compliments.  I plan on making this my go-to recipe for guacamole.

Quite good. I detest the flavor of cilantro thus I never use it.  Instead of cayenne pepper I use a little bit of freshly chopped jalapeno peppers and cumin powder. Always keep the pits in the guacamole to keep it from turning brown!

I couldn't decide between this recipe and another on this site that appeared to be much spicier, so I made both.  Both turned out very well and I'm giving five stars to each, but they were very different dips.  This one was like something you'd get at a restaurant or packaged from a store.  Very green, nice flavor, mildly spicy.  The other recipe resulted a very different appearance and much hotter dip.  I like spicy, so the other is my favorite, but this is an excellent dip that most people will prefer.

I used three ripe Haas Avocados. I mashed up two and cut up one since I like my guacamole chunkier. I seeded and rough chopped 2 large roma tomatoes. I also like my guacamole with chunks of tomatoes. I used one red onion and I added a pinch of cumin and Hawaiian sea salt for seasoning. I also snuck in a half of jalapeno, seeded, ribbed and finely chopped. The fresh cilantro and lime juice is what gives this nice rounded flavor. I thought this was delicious and comes fairly close to what I grew up eating. The guacamole was smooth, creamy, with just the right amount of flavor. This was fresh tasting, nothing overpowering or too spicy, just the way I like it!

this was pretty good.
if you have leftover guacamole and you would like to save it put the avocado pits in the guacamole because it helps it sat green longer.

Fantastic!  Used this recipe for my very first time making guac.  Followed the recipe with just a couple of tweaks.  I used just a bit less onion and used about 4 cloves of garlic.  Then I added a pinch of homemade taco seasoning instead of cayenne.  It received rave reviews and was all gone before I had more than a bite.  Definitely a great recipe.

I made this exactly as written and it is very good guacamole. Will definitely make again in the future. Like all guacamole I had problems with it going brown after a bit and someone told me if you place one of the pits from one of the avocado in the center of the dip it will keep it from going brown.

Very good Guacamole recipe.  Just like a place that made it fresh for us at the table in Mexico.  Yummy.  I took the leftovers and added feta cheese.  Took it to work the next day with some chips.  Everyone loved the twist.  :)  ENJOY!!

Great guac.  I typically make this to use in my football season tailgate chip dip.  The green guac makes a great football field with salsa endzones and sour cream piping for details.

Take 2 - MUCH BETTER!

OK the first time I did this, I threw the onion, tomato, cilantro & garlic in the food processor - BIG MISTAKE! Do NOT do this!  It was horrible guacamole!  It was more salsa than guacamole!

So the 2nd time I made it I used around 1/2 cup of onion that I chopped myself, and 2 small tomatoes that I chopped myself.  Mixed together with minced garlic & Cilantro & set aside.  I then mashed up the 3 Avocados, and chopped up 1/2 of one so it was nice and chunky.  Added in the onion/tomato mixture with the Lime Juice.  PERFECTION!

Oh and to keep from browning - we've learned that leaving the seed of 1 avocado pressed into the top of the guacamole & then covering it somehow keeps it from browning! Not sure why but whatever works!! Try this recipe, you won't be disappointed - just don't throw it in the food processor!

Thanks for sharing - I will make from here on out!!

Fresh, delicious and very simple to make. I used red onion and only added enough salt to suit my taste. I also left out the cayenne pepper but only because I didn't have any. Next time I'll make it with the pepper in.

Best guac EVER! Had some chips leftover from mexican dinner last night and had nothing to put on them, so decided to make this. Used 1/2 can diced tomatoes, 3 tbs dried minced onion, and 1 1/2 tbsp dried cilantro since those were what i had on hand. Also added a few chopped pickled jalapenos--we like spicy! Didn't wait an hr. before tasting and it's already excellent!! Can't wait to eat more later after it's gotten a chance to sit a little while.

Amazing guac! Super easy to make and oh so yummy! I made the amount in the recipe for a party and it was gobbled up so fast. The guac was a little salty - it may not have needed the teaspoon of added salt - but I love salty so it wasn't a big problem for me!

This is an awsome guacamole recipe! Perfect ratios. The cayenne is my "secret" ingredient, it dosent give the guac any spice just gives it that extra something.

This is my go-to guacamole recipe. It's the perfect balance of all the flavors.  My only change is instead of the optional cayenne pepper, I add two serrano chili peppers, which gives it a fabulous kick.

Absolutely amazing guacamole and certainly worth the 5-star rating.  I followed the directions exactly and included the cayenne.  Made for a party and it was devoured.  My only mistake was not making more!  My husband - who loves guacamole - asks for this frequently now.

Awesome. We are big guacamole fans and I se no need to ever have or try another recipe. This is a great base recipe that can easily be adjusted to suit your preferences. Perfecto! Made three batches in one week for various gatherings and it was a hit at all of them. We are big on bold flavor so I made the following changes: increased lime to 1.5, tripled diced garlic, used 1/2 tsp. freshly ground red chili peppers instead of ground cayenne, eliminated cilantro, added 1 tsp. garlic powder, added 1/2 tsp. onion powder, added 1/2 tsp. ground cumin. Delicioso!!

I've always made my guacamole this way.  The only thing that I do differently is omit the cayenne and add one very small seeded and finely diced jalapeno (it's not as hot as you might think, but you can reduce the amount added to suit your taste).

Delicious!  Left out the cayenne because I didn't have any and it was still fabulous!

Edit 06/25/2008: I have made this guacamole at least 4 times for various parties and it is always the first thing gone.  I usually dice up the veggies up to a day early and let them marinate with the cilantro, spices, and lime juice.  I just add and mash the avocado right before serving.  I LOVE this recipe!

I never made guacamole before I tried this recipe.  I would give it more than 5 stars if I could.  I add more garlic and salt as a personal preference.  Took a doubled recipe to a family gathering and it was the first thing gone.  Everytime my best friend comes over she asks me to make this as well.  It is addicting!

This is another great Guacamole recipie!  This has a wonderful combination of flavors! The cayenne, cilantro, and garlic work wonders for dressing up Guac! I am so impressed with the way it came out!  I added sliced olives on top for looks.. but I do not suggest doing this at all.  It made it taste very weird.   Its great alone and I do not think it needs any changing. ^_^

This is such a great recipe. I omitted the the cilantro since I didn't care for it. I was quick and easy to make. I had it whipped up in no time! I refrigerate it for a couple of hours to let the taste set in before I had some. It was very good, and this recipe couldn't have been any easier!

I've made this twice now, and it is really good.  It seems salty at first, but do it up several hours ahead and the salt subsides.  Perfect the next day!  I mis-remembered the recipe while out shopping for ingredients, so I used lemon instead of lime.  It works, too.

I've always made my guacamole from a seasoning mix and have always loved it. But after this I will never go back! Amazing guacamole. I didn't have any roma tomatoes so I used a can of diced tomatoes, drained, and just made them a little smaller. I also added slightly more cilantro as it's something we love. 5 stars from this family

I'm blown away!  This is definitely the best guac I have ever made!.. This is what I changed.. I only added a tablespoon and a half of cilantro and instead of the cayenne pepper I chopped up very finely one habanero (love them!).. This WILL be my guacamole recipe from now on.. no sense in looking elsewhere! BRAVO!

This is one of the best guacamole recipes I've found so far. I leave out the tomatoes usually, just because I'm not a fan of them...but still turns out delicious.

This is super tasty! I made this for an event at my place and everyone raved. It's a great combination. The cayenne adds a nice taste too, although be careful that you don't add too much as it gets spicy quick.

Our favorite guacamole recipe by far. This blows the $4 bags of guac at the store away... Use freshest ingredients possible for best taste. Using a blender or food processor is the best way I've found for getting the avocado really creamy before adding the rest of the ingredients.

Amazing guac., make sure you add the avocado seeds to the mix.  It will keep it from browning.

LOVE, LOVE, LOVED this!!  I added more than just a pinch of cayenne to give it more heat, and will probably add even more next time I make this.....but I can't believe how easy and good this was.  This is truly a restaurant quality recipe.

Wow. Easy as pie and a HUGE hit with everyone. I confess to not having any idea what a ripe avocado looked like so my first attempt at this was a pretty big flop. But I learned quickly and bought the brown, shriveled up ones next time which mashed up great that evening and were a huge hit.

I can't help but review this recipe - because I'm a bit amazed by the reveiws that I have read.

On the one hand - I agree - this IS guacamole.  Certain things can only be made one way - and this is it.  If you want to add a bunch of other  junk - have at it - but call it soemthing else because it's not guacamole.

On the other hand - I'm a bit amazed at how people are fawning over this recipe - essentially for the same reason.  It is just a basic - proper - guacamole recipe.  Some things are best simple and traditional - IMHO - this is one!

In the end - I'll say - if this isn't how you make guacamole - then you are in for treat.

This was the best loved recipe of the super bowl party. This was my first attempt with guacamole and it was awesome. I made it exactly as written but double the recipes. For my own tastes I think I would do a touch less lime and salt next time and probably up the cayenne just a bit so the heat hits a bit more. Thanks-great recipe!

I don't care for guacamole, but my husband loved this.  The only change I made was to use lemon juice instead of lime because I have an abundance of lemons to use up.

Finally, a great guacamole recipe! This is a very easy and tasty recipe for guacamole. I think you can easily make small changes for your particular taste and it still comes out great. For instance, I didn't have roma tomatoes, but a can of diced tomatoes worked just fine. Also I didn't have cayenne pepper, but used a dash of habenero tabasco sause and that spiced it up nicely. Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

This was my first time making guacamole and this was perfect!  I used canned petite diced tomatoes instead of fresh, and added a little cumin and jalapeno.  It had none of the "musty" taste that I find with avocados/guac sometimes because it was so fresh, extremely creamy and almost buttery!  Delicious!

This is how i ALWAYS make my guac and i always get compliments. However, depending on my mood ( and what i have in the cupboard) I use green tomatoes, fresh garlic and add a dash of tobasco.. Awesome recipe!

I have been making this guac for about 5 years now and I get rave reviews from everyone. Make sure you have enough salt and lime in it to make it taste real good. Sometimes I make it chunkier by not mashing the avocado but cutting it into chunks and adding diced tomato and onion, along with the rest of the ingredients. That makes sort of an avocado salsa. Mashed or diced- it is Deelicious! Also, I never put cayenne pepper in it before- I will have to try that!

Made as recipe stated, thought it needed more flavor.  Added 1/2 teaspoon cumin and 1 tablespoon minced jalapeno's. Was better with added ingredients, will prob keep searching for the perfect Gucamole

This guacamole was so easy to make and an amazing snack at Christmas!  I actually doubled the number of avacados while keeping the rest of the ingredients as called for otherwise it would have been off-balance.  My husband HATES onions so instead I substituted a teaspoon of onion powder.  I will probably cut down on the salt next time as well because we bought salted tortilla chips and it was a tad too much.  Otherwise, a WONDERFUL recipe!!

Excellent!  My first time making homemade guac and it was perfect!  My Thanksgiving guests loved it as part of my "night before" appetizer spread when they arrived hungry and tired from their cross-country flight.  Thanks so much for a fresh-tasting, quick and easy guac recipe.

I make fresh guacamole a lot, but this is the first time I've put lime juice in. I didn't use all the juice of one lime because it seemed like a lot and it was. I used about 1/2 to 3/4 of the juice from 1 lime and it was overpowering. The recipe needs to say how much lime juice instead of the juice of 1 lime since lime size can vary. I'm assuming you only need a tablespoon or so.

Even though I changed this to my tastes, the recipe has great bones. I like mine with a little more lime so I usually buy two, also I add some fresh ground sea salt, 1/2 c. sour cream AND... a half a habanero. Perfect!

First time I've ever made guac & it was delish! We like garlic, so I added more. Also, followed others advice & added cumin & cayenne.  Tried this for a ghouls-nite-out in the cauliflower brain & it disappeared. Poor hubby didn't even get to try it!  This was very easy & will definitely be making this often.

This is so amazing and I haven't even let it sit for 30 minutes!  I plan to throw some lump crabmeat on top and serve as an appetizer later!  This is BETTER than the guac I ordered at a high end place over the weekend (that was $17!).

I LOVE this recipe!  I have made it several times, you can't screw this up.  I do double the amount of garlic & cayenne pepper as we like ours a bit spicy.  Thanks for sharing this!

Good recipe. The lime juice helps keep the avocado from turning brown, so does leaving the pit in the mixture. But, the best way is to lay a piece of plastic wrap directly on the guacamole until serving time. It's the air that turns it brown. I do all three and never have it turn brown. Of course, it's usually gone before it has a chance=)

This is pretty much how I have been making my guacamole for years, however, I use lemon juice instead of lime and a dash or two of Tabasco sauce rather than cayenne. I prefer not to add the tomatoes to the guacamole as if you have leftovers, they tend to get everything soggy. I like to serve guacamole and chips alongside my salsa and I would never add sour cream to the guac. as another person suggested. Imo, it takes away from the flavor of the avocados. For the best guacamole, use California Hass avocados.

I followed this recipe exactly (not something I normally do) and it came out completely inedible. There is WAY too much lime juice, maybe I just got a big lime, but I questioned the amount before mixing it up. My boyfriend has spent a half an hour in the kitchen trying to doctor it up he wants it to work so badly.

The only reason you would need to use limes in this recipe is to keep the guacamole from turning brown.  I was not a big fan of the lime flavor in the guacamole.  If you are going to serve the guacamole right away you do not need to use the limes.  The key to making the guacamole is to use ripe avacados.  When choosing avacados they cannot be too hard or too soft.

My family loves this guacamole!  I have made it several times, and always follow the directions exactly as written.  I don't add cayenne in case it is too much for my 2 year old.  Today my husband discovered the most amazing and indulgent way to eat it - instead of dipping with chips, we dipped with thick slices of crisp bacon.  Store it in the fridge with the avocado pits to prevent browning.

Awesome guac!! I did add a pinch of cumin and a finely chopped jalapeno. I made fajitas and the guac was a hit!! I marinated chicken breasts for 2 hours in fresh lemon juice, cumin, chopped cilantro and kosher salt with fresh ground pepper. I grilled the chicken, sauteed some peppers and onions and together with chopped plum tomatoes and mexican cheese, the best fajitas were born. My brothers and their kids are still asking when we can have 'South of the Border' night again. Thanks for a great recipe!!

My husband raved about this recipe.  We have been looking for the perfect guacamole recipe for a while and this one is by far the best that we have found.  I will definitely make this one again, but will likely use less garlic.

Very delicious and fresh-tasting.  I only had two avocados so I scaled the recipe down a little.  I used red onion, and less than what is called for.  I didn't add any salt.  I used key lime juice from the bottle and I think I used too much, because it was too lime-y.  Still good though.

I use this ALL the time.  I work one saturday a month and we always have a potluck and all my co-workers always ask for this guac!  To avoid browning (since I make my guac the night before I take it to work) I take an extra lime and squeeze all the juice out over the guac.  When I open the tupperware the next day I just mix the extra lime juice in (I prefer mine w/the extra lime, you could just pour it out if you wanted to) and serve!  Very, very good...and you can never add enough garlic!  Enjoy!

...Avocados were four for a dollar at the farmers market so I had to make guacamole!  We loved this recipe..The only change I made was used key lime juice (fresh limes were floating in our Corona's) and I added a little salsa.  I mashed my avocados with my potato masher and diced my tomatoes and onion very small...Do not leave Out the Cilantro...So good!  Can't tell you if this is good the next day..didn't last that long...Thanks for a great recipe!

This is THE guacamole recipe.  I am now officially the guacamole maker of my friends and family - at their request.  
MY ADVICE:  mix up the avocado, salt (measure to preference) and lime juice as your base.  TASTE THIS!!  Once the base is to your liking, the rest of the ingredients will just be added flavors.

If you're wondering if you chop the stems of the cilantro...you do not. Use the leaves. This recipe is fabulous. You can also swap lemon for lime but don't use a huge lemon and don't use as much lemon juice as you would lime. Lime is a little sweeter than lemon.

This was fantastic!  I made it for the Sunday football game, and it was so good I had the leftovers for breakfast.  AND LUNCH!  Wow -- it tastes even better the next day.  I have two tips:  1) If you think you'll have leftovers, safe the avocado pits and store them in the same container with the leftovers -- that will keep it from discoloring & turning black.  2) If you want your guacamole super-chunky, blend & mix all the other ingredients first, then add the chopped avocados last.  That way they will hold their shape better.

This recipie was a bit salty and had waaaay to much of a bad garlic after taste on your breath.  So the second time i made this  i added 1 more avacado , 1/4 teaspoon of fresh garlic, and a very small can  of Golden Sweet Corn.  Chili's resturant now serves Corn Guacamole.....thats where i got the idea! If i didnt add these things then, for me personally, the overall taste of the guacamole would have been too garlic and salty tasting.

Best guac recipe I have found!  I upped the cilantro a bit and as someone else suggested, added maybe 1/2 t cumin.  Fantastic!  Thanks Bob!

Best tasting guacamole I've ever made. My guests gobbled it up. The recipe makes a nice amount, but it went so fast that I'll make two batches next time. I didn't make any changes or substitutions, and it turned out perfectly.

AWESOME. This rocked. The only tweaks were..I used 1 TBSP of lime juice, 1 TBSP of lemon juice. The onion was a red onion and I used 2 tsps of minced garlic because I'm a garlic lover. I used 1/2 can of petite diced tomatoes w/jalapeno's drained as the tomato part. The consistancy was perfect. Just a tip to keep the avocado from turning brown, once you put it in the container for storage, take wax or plastic wrap and place directly on the dip to remove as much air as possible then cover with the lid.

I like a smooth consistency so I did not add the tomotoes. I blended everything really well as I do not like chunky guacamole. It is quite good

I have made this exact dish 3 times in the past week.  My recommendation is to follow the recipe verbatim.  The guacamole received great reviews on Christmas Day and for a best friend's birthday celebration.  Overall the recipe creates an outstanding taste, is relatively easy to make and requires simple and affordable ingredients.  Bravo!!

I enjoyed the guacamole along with my son, but hubby didn't care for it. Followed the recipe exactly and next time I'll use a little less lime.

YUM!  I am a novice in the kitchen but I really enjoyed making this recipe.  I halved it just because I didn't have all the ingredients for a full-size recipe.  I used my food processor to cut up most of the ingredients and then did the final mixing by hand.  I probably needed another avocado (only had one and the halving of the recipe called for 1.5) so mine was a little more liquid than I would like.  But the flavor and smell of the fresh ingredients is SCRUMPTIOUS!  We'll definitely keep using this recipe.

I made a slight change I followed the recipe but added some salsa about 1/4 cup that I had on hand and a few chopped can jalapenos. Also, I added more tomatoe.  It's more a "taste and adjust" to your liking. This is more of a topping on tacos or quesadillas than a salad.

This is a great recipe but one thing is missing. Don't use a pinch of cayenne for heat. Use a teaspoon or tablespoon of finely chopped serrano pepper. It adds so much flavor and that added heat.

This was the first time making Guacamole! Easy and tastes just as good as any restaurant. I did put a pinch of cayenne pepper and might add a little more next time.

Turned out to be pretty good. I thought it was to lemony but the rest of my family said it was great. Next time I would use less lemon. (Maybe 1/2)

Delicious! This is my go-to recipe for guacamole now. My one change was to add just a *smidgen* of CUMIN, which adds a nice body to all the flavors, and then it was perfect.

This was my first attempt at making Guacamole and it was perfect.  Only change I made was to cut the salt to 1/2 tsp.  I probably used about 1/8 tsp of cayenne pepper.  
As others suggested, keeping the pit in with the dip prevents the avocado (and your dip) from turning brown.
I'll be making this again!

EASY and addictively good!!! best guacamole ive ever had... i used only two avocados(mashed with my whisk) and all the ingredients int he recipe but i didnt measure, i just eyeballed. i also used red onion and threw in some cumin and cayenne. woukldnt change a thing . served with whole grain tortilla chips,  healthy and tasty

**update, i forgot the garlic once and didnt miss it. ALSO its very important to season your avocado 1st w the salt, cumin, paprika, and lemon juice then add in everythign else.

I made it just like the recipe and this guacamole turned out delicious.  Although, I think next time I might mince up a fresh jalapeno instead of adding the cayenne pepper.

I didn't have a fresh lime so I used about 1/4 cup of lime juice and I also used about 1/2 tsp garlic powder in place of the diced garlic and it turned out great!

The cilantro gives it a nice flavor, but the SALT is WAYYYY too much. I'm going to make this again and use only 1/4 teaspoon and start from there.

This recipe makes absolutely great guac! I like my guacamole kind of chunky, so didn't mash all the avocadoes. Took this to a housewarming party - and we're picky about our guacamole here in TX - and the men basically parked themselves around the bowl until it was all gone. Highly recommend this!

I hate guacamole only eating it once by accident because it smooshed next to a taco on my plate....but my 22 yr old daughter wanted guacamole instead of a birthday cake.  I found this recipe having no idea what I was doing and followed it to a T.  She loved it, the guests loved it and the biggest shocker - I LOVED IT!!

Best guacamole ever! This recipe was so delicious and easy. I will never buy guacamole again! Im not a big fan of cilantro or onions, but i chopped them up real fine and it gave the flavor and i didnt notice the cilantro. I also added an extra avacado. It was the best! Perfect with some chips and matgaritas.

I tasted this after just making it, and it's delicious. I added about 5 slices of pickled jalapenos for kick. I can't wait to try it tomorrow after the flavors meld.

We changed this recipe a bit by substituting the lime juice with lemon juice and doubling the salt, onion and tomatoes. Also, we left out the cayenne pepper and cilantro. We folded in 1/2 c. sour cream to make it smooth and creamy. It makes your avocados go further, too. This is a family favorite at our holiday gatherings. We serve it with tortilla chips and Fritos.

All I can say is WOW.  I made a 3 serving version with 2 avocados (topped 4 fajitas with some to spare).  I served this on top of Paula Dean's Gold Medal Sizzling Fajitas.  Use a fork to mash the guacamole.  Putting the pit into the guacamole keeps it from oxidizing...the lime juice helps with that too.  YUM!!!

This is what guacamole should be! I don't care for tomatoes in my guac, so I didn't add those, and in the end I realized I had forgotten the onion, but it was still fantastic! I'm glad that I cut the recipe in half or we would have over-indulged.

I mean..... no wonder this is 5 stars after more than 2000 reviews! Absolutely perfect as written. Love it!  I served this with some Tostitos Scoops along with "D's Famous Salsa" from this site.  We also used it as a topping on our Fajitas.

Hands down, best guacamole recipe.  Definitely add the cayenne as it gives it a nice kick.  I like to add freshly ground black pepper as well.

This guacomole is wonderful!!!  We like ours a little spicy so we add either more cayenne or a little chopped jalepeno.  Either way....it is GREAT!!

DELICIOUS! My first time making guac by myself hah. My boyfriend LOVES it. Didn't use any cayenne pepper, and only used one tomato. Used about 1/4 cup of onion. SOOO gooooood! I'd recommend this to anyone who wants awesome, easy guacamole.

This guacamole was excellent and will certainly be a staple in my household as most of our dinners tend to be Mexican themed. I didn't add the salt since chips tend to be very salty already.

This is the first time I've made guacamole.  I have always liked it, but my husband not so much.  I doubled the recipe and used the following ratios: 6 Avacados, 1 lime, 2 tsp salt, 1/2 onion chopped, 4 small tomatos, 1/3 bunch chopped cilantro, 2 cloves garlic.  I would have liked to use a whole onion, but my husband doesn't like onion so much.  He loved this guacamole and had me make two batchs in a week.  The first batch, I used 2 limes and it was too much.  1 lime in the 2nd batch was perfect.  This will be a regular for us.

I made this over the holidays and for the Superbowl and it was a hit.  Everyone loved it.  The only variation I made was to put the avocados in the food processor for a smoother texture.

Delicious combination of ingredients but a bit too much raw onion for my taste.  I used 4 avocados and the suggested amounts of all the other ingredients and STILL found that the onion was overpowering.  My guests didn't seem to mind though!  Next time I'd use 1/4 cup instead of 1/2 cup.

Wow, the proportions on this are perfect. This is easily the best guacamole I've ever tasted (and let me tell you, I've tried quite a few)! The best way to get this just right is to use really fresh ingredients. If the avocado is just a little bit tough, it'll prevent the guacamole from coming out too liquid-y and will taste that much better :)

Good, but too much onion.  Make sure you let it sit in the fridge for an hour before serving.  The onion needs to mellow out.

This Guacamole is Deeelicious!  I was at a party 4 days ago and a guest made some awesome Guacamole.  I thought about it for 4 days.  I couldn't take it anymore so I came to my trustee Allrecipes and here was an awesome recipe for Guacamole.  I swear this taste exactly like what I had a the party.  I used 4 avocados, 2 garlic cloves, 1/2 onion, a lot of cilantro (i love it) a little salt, juice of 1 lime and 8 grape tomatoes.  Just fabulous delicious!

It was a bit bland, so I added half of a jalepeno, finely chopped, and a bit more lime juice.  I also added diced green bell pepper for a bit more flavor.  Otherwise, good.

Love it.  For a change make it with the juice of one lemon instead.  Real refreshing!  To pick a ripe but not rotten avocado, pull the stem off and make sure it is green, if it is not bright green, pick another one out.

I am only giving this 4 because it was VERY salty for some reason! I would cut back on the salt by half. I added about 1/2 cup of sour cream to neutralize the salt flavor and wow, it was fantastic.

It's nothing out of the world guacamole.  Still searching for a great recipe.  If you are looking for a basic healthy guacamole- this is it.  I would suggest adding in more salt and lime juice.  The roommates enjoyed it, though.

I made this about 20 minutes ago for tomorrow's family dinner. I must say that it is certainly pretty, but perhaps next time, I may double it!  I also didn't have any limes on hand so I used 1 teaspoon of lime juice from concentrate (those little green limes you get at the supermarket). I also skipped the cayenne and added a chopped and seeded jalepeno.  I tasted it and it was pretty darn good!  Definately a keeper!

I followed the recipe exactly and while this did not taste bad I feel that it could have benefited from fresh jalapeno pepper and more tomatoe, cilantro, garlic and lime. Next time I will just add pico de gallo to the avocado.

Yummy!  Very, very easy.  The only change I made was using flat leaf parsley instead of cilantro (none on hand).  My husband loved this as did I!!!.  First time making and will make again and again.  Thanks Bob for sharing.

This is a really good and original recipe. The only difference I've made it adding fresh chiles for the spice. But as is this recipe is great, it uses the same ingredients my grandmother and he great-grandmother used in mexico. MUST TRY!!

This guacamole was not good. I followed the recipe exactly. A whole lime is too much lime juice. And three tablespoons of cilantro is too much. All we could taste was lime juice and cilantro. Yuck. Leave 2/3 of each of those ingredients out, and you will be better off.

I have never liked guacamole, but I needed some for seven layer dip.  After making this, I forced myself to taste it.  Oh wow was it delicious.  I was so excited about this recipe.  But after it sat in the refrigerator for a couple of hours, it seemed very salty.  I will definitely try it again, but with half the salt and maybe a little less lime (my lime was very juicy).
*(Update)* I made this again with a little more avocado (my avocados were larger than the first time a made it) and I used only ¼ tsp salt but still plenty of lime juice.  It wasn't as good immediately, but after an hour in the refrigerator for the flavors to meld, it was delicious.  So I suppose if I plan to eat it immediately without time for the flavors to meld I would add almost a tsp of salt.  But usually I make it a little ahead of time so the salt definitely needs to be cut down drastically from what the recipe calls for.

Awesome recipe. A little tip I learned to keep it from discoloring so fast is to save a pit from the avacado and put it into the quacamole. Works great.

The ONLY Guacamole recipe anybody should ever make! I served it with organic red tortilla chips at a holiday party (for the festive green/red display) and it disappeared b4 any other appetizer was even touched! I like to make recipes as originally written by the author 1st, then tweak a bit, but this one doesn't need a change at all!

This is for sure the best guac recipe out there.  I used to think my guac was the best, and have always used lime juice, which is key, but have now made this 3 times and receive rave reviews every time.  I add a bit more cilantro and cayenne than called for, but that's my personal taste.  Thank you!

I made this when my chef-caliber family came over for Mother's Day.  I've been asked to bring it on countless occasions since then.  I do the whole thing in a food processor, but reserve one coarsely-chopped avocado to stir in at the last minute.  Creamy and chunky.  But most of all, delicious.

i wish i knew to pick out the avocados that are softer before attempting this. i had 2 soft avocados and 1 firm one. the firm avocado was completely impossible to mash. i also think 1/2 cup of onions is too much for 3 avocados. my guac turned out very oniony tasting. when i tried it again w/ half the onions and softer avocados, it was much better. update 3/31/09: i just learned on the food network that if your avocados are too hard, you can grill them for a couple minutes to soften them.

The most addicting Guacamole I have ever had. I made it and took it to a party and it was a big hit. I didn’t bring enough chips though. I made 8 serving of this and the only thing I changed was instead of the tomatoes I used almost a cup of salsa but everything else I kept the same. Was so good and this is my only Guacamole recipe.

This was pretty good. I made it exactly as the recipe called for and gave it a taste, but wound up adding a couple extra pinches of salt, cayenne pepper, and an extra squirt of lime juice. I wanted that extra little kick, and it was a bit bland when done by the recipe. Still, very good guac, I will definitely be making this again.

** 5 STAR RECIPE ** Absolutely SUPERB GUACAMOLE! I used a red onion & sea salt which is just our preference. Mashed the avocados just enough to leave some nice chunks for texture & grated in fresh garlic.

Oh my! This recipe is as easy as it is good. I had to leave the house to stop myself from eating it all.....

I made it as written, next time I will kick up the cayenne or add jalapenos for a little more spice. Thanks for the recipe!

So delicious! I thought I made a killer guacamole, until I tried this one. Absolutely the best. No changes needed. Unless you hate cilantro, don't skip it - it makes the flavor wonderful and also makes for beautiful presentation.

I made this today based on the reviews and I have to say it was a hit.  I love chunky guacamole and I also did what one user suggested and I chopped one avocado and mashed the others.  The guacamole was a hit.  Everyone loved it and asked where I got it from.  I was proud to say I made it.  I added more cayenne then most would but I am a Creole gal!  We like it spicy and with a good swift kick!  Thanks!

Great guacamole! Like many suggested here, I used purple onion instead of white or yellow and only used 1/3 cup. I love onion, though, so next time I will up it to 1/2 cup. I'm not a big fan of tomatoes in guacamole, so I omitted them. In their stead, I added a chopped freshly roasted red pepper. I liked the red color and smokey flavor it added.

We ate it with Bite Size Tostitos, which are very salty chips. I had reduced the salt to 1/2 teaspoon, and it still seemed a little too salty to me. If I make it again and plan to serve it with salted chips, I might completely omit the salt.

Awesome!  Didn't use the cilantro, as I'm not a fan of that spice.  It was very tasty and got rave reviews from my husband!  Also made the Easy Mexican Casserole, which was delicious.  I'd make both of these again.

I added a few slices of cooked bacon,drained well,chopped very small & 2 plum tomato's, finely chopped & it was the biggest hit!  I've made it 3 times in the last month so that other people could claim it as their own for their Holiday parties! If you don't have fresh cilantro, then DO NOT bother making this recipe.  The Key here is...FRESH!  Thanks for the recipe!

Really good, I used dried onions.  Fresh cilantro is the key, and I used some extra garlic salt.  Perfect!

The BEST guac I've ever eaten and I can't believe that I made it!  I'm the only avocado fan in my house so I only used 1 avocado, and cut all the other ingredients in half.  Definitely taste as you go...I ended up addding more red pepper for more kick, and left out the cilantro completely (didn't have any...don't care for it much).  And a big BONUS:  because of the lime juice, the guacamole stayed a beautiful green even the next day.  I covered the surface of the guac with plastic wrap, then put the lid on the plastic container and I think that helped keep it nice also.  Thanks SO much...delicious!

I like to use red onion in this (a bit less than 1/2 cup), an extra Tbsp.  cilantro and definitely more than just a pinch of cayenne... best guacamole recipe on this site though,in my not-so-humble opinion. Thanks, Bob!

My hubby is  always the one who makes the guac but he was at work & I wanted some so I tried this recipe. How will I ever tell him that I prefer another man's guac to his? ;o) I didn't have romas so I subbed cherry tomatoes, finely minced. I added a bit of extra garlic & a couple of twists of black pepper but otherwise didn't change a thing. My onions were very sweet & mild so they didn't overpower it...I thought it was just perfect!

I have to admit, I was a little disappointed after reading all the wonderful reviews....It was just okay.  Maybe I did something wrong. The taste of onion completely overpowered everything else, even after doctoring it I ended up just throwing it out.  Maybe I might try it again, only next time with about a 1/4 of the onion.  Thanks anyways.

This Guacamole was awesome!!  Make sure to take into account the saltyness of the nachos you are using, I added less salt when I used this recipe.  This recipe still tastes great the next day (but looks kinda nasty).

Oooooh yeaaaaaaah! This guacamole is out of this world. I made this several times now and every time it is the first to disappear. My friends always ask me if I have any more in the fridge. Try it!!! You won't believe how good it is.

Fabuloso.  I use red onion instead of regular, but otherwise this is my favorite guac recipe.  Perfect for when our neighbors share their avocado crop!  I could eat it with a spoon and often do.  (who needs a tortilla chip?)

I love this recipe. It is simple & the fresh ingrediants make it what it is.
 When preparing this recipe recently, I discovered my daughter had the 2 fresh tomatoes for another dish.
 With no time to spare before guests began to arrive, I substituted several tblsp of canned whole tomatoes, it still was the best guacamole ever.
 Thank you, Bob.

I have never gone wrong with this recipe. Guests will ask me ahead of time if I'm making this guacamole. I mash the avocados with a potato masher and add extra tomatoes for a nice chunky texture. Fresh cilantro is best but even the dried stuff works in a pinch. Depending on your tastes you can add more or less onion and garlic - better than anything I've ever had in a restaurant! So easy and so versatile.

Very, very easy to make and be sure to add the lime juice first when mashing the alvacados.  I found this keeps it from turning brown.  I usually add extra tomatoes, garlic, and a couple of dashes hot sauce.  I agree with the others, the longer you let it sit the better it tastes!

This is an excellent guacamole recipe.  The only thing is that I included the juice of one lime, but it was too much.  Maybe I should have used a Mexican lime because those are smaller.  Anyway, when I made it the second time I only used half a lime.

Good stuff!  I love coriander (aka cilantro) so it was a treat to have this ingredient included.  The second time I made this, I threw in some chopped jalapeno pepper for extra punch...yum!

Nothing to change about this fabulous guacamole recipe. It is absolutely delicious! Although not specified, red onions are a must for this. Also, save a pit from one of the avocados and add to the finished guacamole to keep it from browning before serving.

To keep from browning, just leave one of the avocado seeds in the middle of your bowl.  That's how it's been done in Texas for generations.

As most other reviewers' have said, this is an outstanding fresh guac recipe that is simple and so yummy! All that I changed was using less (1/4 t.) sea salt and more garlic (didn't measure but at least doubled). Oh and I added cumin because cumin is absolutely my favorite spice ever! (Try it mixed in w/ scrambled eggs or sprinkled on fried eggs it's blow your mind fantastic). Also de-seeded tomatoes first to prevent runniness (sp.?). Anyhow, Muy Sabrosa!

Rockin' out some pretty awesome guac there Bob!! I've always liked my own but I thought I'd give AR a shot and see what y'all got going. I wasn't disappointed. This recipe is very much like mine. I don't get to bothered with the quantities, I just kinda piled all the ingredients in and voilá, we got some tasty guac to throw some chips in. Thanks Bob! As is, this recipe for guac is perfectamundo!

This was gobbled up by the party goers last night. I noticed a couple of reviews in particular that I'd like to comment on. Someone said to layer the lime juice over the top of the guac rather than mixing it in (to prevent browning). I used the lime juice as directed, and here it is the next day and still no browning. Fresh as can be. Someone else omits tomatoes, because they make the quac "wet" and thus inedible for leftovers. I used my regular garden tomatoes, first removing the seeds and juice, and my leftover guac is still yummy and creamy green perfection (having some for a snack as I write this). I used five large avocados for a party size batch, but kept the other ingredients as is. Only real change I made was to add 2 T. mayo and a bit of cumin. Garnish with a thin lime slice or cilantro sprig and then start on the margaritas!

I am just offering a hint on unripe avocados. You can buy them and use them in 24 hours. Just put them in a brown bag with a banana and fold the bag close I clip it shut, the banana releases ethylene gas which ripens the avocados. Go for it, it works.

Followed the recipe to the letter and it turned out absolutely perfect. Great texture, slightly chunky in a creamy base. Best guac ever!

The best guac ever! Every time I have made it there are NO leftovers and I double it! I do add only half of the lime juice the recipe calls for after the first time I made it. Also note that by adding the pits from the avocados back into the guac -it keeps it from turning brown so quickly!  THANKS SO MUCH FOR SHARING THIS RECIPE! My friends thank you as well!

This was my first try at guacamole and it was super simple and easy to do. And delicious. I received a lot of compliments. I added extra garlic and two dashes of cayenne. Yum, yum, yum!

I have always loved guac, but now that I am pregnant, my cravings for it are out of this world! If you want to add yet another kick to this fabulous recipe, add a tbsp or two of sour cream. Learned that tip from my dad. Thanks, Dad!

I love it like this, but added lemon juice, same amount as the lime. I use red onion, specifically, which is a nice color and texture. The key is really using fresh juice (not bottled) and especially fresh cilantro, not dried. The other works, but it's just not the same!

Excellent recipe! I personally like to taste the avocado a little more so I use only 1 tomato, 2 tbsp cilantro, 1/3 cup onion, 1/2 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp garlic, along with the lime juice.  I also add 1/2 cup sweet yellow corn.  I make this recipe at parties and it always disappears.  Twice already my guests have asked me to make more.  I might have to start doubling the recipe!  You can play with the recipe like I did to suit your tastes, but it's a great place to start.

This was my first guacamole attempt as well, and it did not disappoint. I omitted the cayenne pepper and used 4 cloves minced fresh garlic (seeded the tomatoes as well because I wanted it more chunky, less soupy). My husband polished off the whole thing in one sitting. Amazing.

This guac was perfect.  I was very concerned that I was setting myself up to be disappointed, as the local mexican place really makes a great guac, but this recipe certainly matches theirs.  My guests ate it all.

I have been making this recipe for eons and it is absolutely delicious!  Everyone is always wanting me to make to the guac!  There are one or two variations that you can do for variety.  Instead of the cayenne pepper you can use a favorite picante and the warmer the picante the warmer the guac.  You can also add about 1/2 to 1 cup of sour cream for a "can't stay away from it" version of this time honored recipe.  My family enjoyed it that way at the Sundance restaurant in Red River, New Mexico several years age and it was so good that they want it that way most of the time.  If you are concerned about fat grams, use low or no fat sour cream.  It is hard to beat.  Enjoy!

LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS GUAC! Best I've ever had, easy. So wonderfully fresh, simple, fun to make, and a total crowd pleaser. I added extra garlic and cilantro, diced my tomatoes and red onion on the chunky side, and mashed the avocados smoothly. The crunch of the onions is perfect, but the key here is the lime. It really adds a special something. 

My first attempt, I made it with just a pinch of cayenne, and my second I tried to up the spiciness by adding more: still delicious, but it wasn't the kind of spice I was looking for. I think next time I'll play around and add finely chopped jalepenos as some reviewers have suggested. Either way: two thumbs up! I foresee myself making this many, many, many  more times.

Made this for my husband and he loved it!  I don"t like avocado, but he told me I had to try it.  I did ... and ended up eating half of it!! We polished the whole thing off in less than 30 minutes!  lol.  For me to eat ANYTHING with avocado in it is a pure, unadulterated miracle!  ha ha.  Excellent!  I totally recommend this recipe. =D

Must have been yummy.  Every bit was gone!  I didnt see until now, it is very close to Alton's and I do wish I would have added some cumin.  It must have been fine without cumin also because not a drop left.  His has less cilantro but I think the 3 tbls is fine or whatever your tastes are.  I had a pretty good size lime and I really worked it, so I only used half.  Thanks for sharing!

This was fantastic! I made it for taco night. My husband and I both enjoyed it on tacos and with chips.  Our 16 month-old-son begged to try it. I assumed he wouldn't like it, but we were wrong. He kept furiously signing "more."

Made this recipe for a Mexican themed party. It went over really well! However, I think if I made it next time I would use less salt and maybe even less lime juice.

I thought this was wonderful and I got a lot of compliments on it at my party.  My hubby thought it had too much lime though.  My lime was pretty large so maybe I should've only used half.

By far the best guacamole.  Generous on the salt and cayenne for extra kick.  Also add fresh jalapeno if on hand to taste.

Fabulous guacamole recipe! So easy and scrumptious! I didn't have lime and it was fine without it, still kept the color with the slight acidity of tomatoes and juice. 1/2 tsp of salt was plenty (even for me, a salt lover). The colors in this are really nice, especially with purple onion.

Great recipe, I am now known for my great guac! :)  Leave avo pits in the guac while it is refrigerated to help keep it fresh (my cousin is a cook gave me that tip).  I chop onion VERY finely, but keep tomatos a good size, and I use 3 tomatoes instead of 2.  Also I use a few jalapeno peppers instead of cayenne :)

To keep the guacamole green and fresh, KEEP THE PIT and put it in the center of the guacamole when storing in the fridge. Remove the pit when serving. It sounds like the people who gave this recipe bad reviews aren't too familiar with avocados. If using hass avocados (small, dark green to brown), make sure they are ripe and soft. If they are very firm or hard, they will make a horrible guacamole. Left out on the counter, firm avocados will ripen in 3-4 days.

This didn't come out very right for me, but I do believe I just didn't pick up the right avocados. It was rather tasty, just a bit too chunky!

Awesome!  I use the blade of my knife and the teaspoon of salt to mince the garlic into a paste.  That way you get the flavor, without the bits of garlic :)

This is very good! I went to a Mexican restaurant recently where they make the guacamole at the table. I remember the different options of what I chose to go in it. When I seen this recipe, for guacamole, it had basically all of those ingredients. The only thing different is they added a pinch of garlic powder. I love the addition of lime! I don't know why I had never thought to add that to my guacamole? The only thing I will change next time is to reduce the onion, by about half, out of personal preference. Other than that perfect!Thank you, submitter.

Perfect. I've made Guacamole twice before looking for a recipe I'd like, the other two didn't work out for me. This one has all the spice and flavor I like. I just made this again, this time I didn't have a fresh tomato so I used what I had, small can of petite diced tomatoes with green chilies (drained), I left out the pinch of cayenne. Came out just great! Oh and personal preference I cut the salt down a bit, I figure the chips I'm dipping into it have enough.

I made this guacamole for my boyfriend who is a fantastic chef.  He said the guacamole was far better than any he's ever made.  We both ate the whole batch in like 5 minutes it was so good!!  I added a bit more garlic and cilantro since I'm a fiend.

Wow - this is an excellent guacamole recipe!  I have brought this to many gatherings this summer and always get rave reviews.  Even from people who claim not to like guacamole!  Since I have jalapenos in my garden, I have been using a small jalapeno in substitute to the cayenne pepper.  LOVE I!

I LOVE this recipe SO much!!! And thats saying alot because I hate guacamole. I tried this at a friends house and i could not stop eating it. She gave me the link and now I make this at least once a month! The only thing I changed was I didn't add 1/2 an onion. My onion was huge so I ended up only adding a tablespoon or two since onion upsets my stomach. But otherwise, perfect recipe! :)

too onioney? pffft. this was easily the best guac i have ever made, and I love avocados in any form! also I need to say that I hate onions but will always try a recipe one just the way it is written, glad I did this time. the onion was quite strong before I refrigerated it but after it completely  mellowed out! I find that as long as you follow a recipe to a T the first time it usually works out! thats for this great recipe! better than in Mexico!

First attempt @ guacamole.  Not a fan of it, but wanted to bring it to a summer invite to a friends lake home.  everyone thought it was great.  All thumbs up.  Easy.  I say the hardest part of this recipe is finding the perfect ripness of the  avacados.  You want semi soft,  not soft to touch. Roll the room temperature limes with your palm on the counter to juice them up before cutting.  
You must try it!

This is the perfect guacamole. The only thing I changed was adding more garlic, but that is totally preference. Delicious!

I loved it!  The only thing that I did differently was diced the guacamole instead of mashing it.  It made the texture a bit more chunky and brings out more of the avocado flavor.  Thank you for posting this recipe!

I was only making this for myself, so I only used 1 avocado, 1/2 a small onion, 1 tsp dried cilantro.  I didn't have any ripe tomatoes so I opened a can of diced tomatoes and used some of the tomatoes strained.  The guacamole turned out great and was a perfect amount for 1 serving.

This is exactly how we already make ours. Nothing to change here. The fresher the ingredients the better it will taste. We prefer red onion diced really small. You might try garlic powder if you don't want big bits of garlic.

I made this for my sister's bridal shower and received RAVE reviews over it! I followed the exact recipe, except that I toned down the cilantro a bit since my family is not big on its flavor. This is now my one and only guacamole recipe!

Very well received at the pig roast.  My first try and it was a success.  As mentioned by others, it took longer than 10 minutes to make, but it was well worth the effort.

Part of the perfect recipe. 2 essential items are missing to keep this from 5 stars. Add 1/4 teaspoon of cumin and mix in 1 Tablespoons of finely chopped cilantro leaves (yansoy for those living in Asia).

I have never made guacamole without mayo before.  It was OUTSTANDING!!!  I will never make another guac again.  I made the recipe exactly as is.  I had some guests over and they practically licked the bowl clean.  Serve this with D's Famous Salsa and YOU...ARE...SET!!!

Everybody loves it!  I can't tolerate raw onions or cilantro, so I microwaved the onions and omitted the cilantro.  I've made it many times and it is always well received.  Great snack to bring when there are a lot of gluten/dairy allergies, with gluten free chips.

I used this recipe for my first ever attempt at making guacamole & it turned out GREAT, even though I forgot the cilantro & I used onion powder instead of onions.  Next time, I won't forget the cilantro & I'll probably have to double the recipe because it was gone in no time!

Yummy!! This definitely deserves the 5 star ratings it's chalked up. Easy to make and the compliments from my dinner guests just kept rolling in. I pared down the garlic a little though, and stayed off the cayanne to make it kid-friendly as well

I made this for a Mexican themed Mother's Day dinner I prepared for my in-laws and my hubby.  They all loved it.  My hubby is very picky when it comes to guacamole because he LOVES authentic Mexican food.  Therefore, I was really excited when he proclaimed his love for this recipe.  Thank you for sharing your recipe Bob Cody!  I will definitely be using it again.  The only change I made was to use onion powder in place of the fresh onion because my mother-in-law is allergic to onions.  It was still delicious though.

Pretty darn perfect.  The lime juice, the tomatoes all give it more moisture and fresh tasting.  Cilantro was a great add.  The only thing I changed was added some diced jalapenos and extra seasonings (onion powder, garlic salt, cumin, chili powder, and pepper).

This was so yummy! Everyone devoured it and I will definately make it again. The only thing I did different from the recipe was that I added more garlic. Maybe next time I will try adding some cumin like some of the other reviews suggested. Thanks for the delicious recipe!

This guacamole recipe was fast, easy and extremely tasty. The only thing that I did differently was to replace the yellow onion with scallions. Turned out great!

Really good!  I reduced the amount of onion by half, but it was still a little too much.  Also, added a chopped fresh jalepeno pepper, which gave it a nice little kick.  I made this for a Cinco de Mayo party at work and it was gone in no time!

Cinco de Mayo get together last night - I ordered everything but this from a Mexican restaurant and this is even better than the guac I could have gotten from there!  Rave reviews from guests and requests for recipe as well.  Best guac I have ever made/tasted!

Finally a REAL guacamole!  Mexicans almost always used LIME, NOT lemon... this is an "enhanced" version of the true mexican guacamole which is usually just avacado, lime, CILANTRO, and maybe some onion, garlic and/or tomato.

YUM! This was my first attempt at making guacamole EVER, and it worked out great. I had extremely ripe avocados...I needed to make something! This was easy to do and very flavorful. I think I inadvertently ate about 1/2 of it already...I should probably slow down. I can see eating this with chips (which is what I was doing) but I also like to use it on a burger, or as a spread in a sandwich. I put a dash of paprika in it as well, to Hungarianize it...and actually that was a nice little addition, so I am pleasantly surprised. I can't wait to make this again!

This was a perfect recipe.  I left out the cayenne only because my kids were going to eat it and don't like anything with a kick but I'm sure it would have been the perfect final addition.

Fantastic!! I am not a big fan of guacamole but wanted to make it for a party. I couldn't believe how good it was. I did make a couple of adjustments. I reduced the tomato to half and added roasted red pepper. I also added cumin. It was a success. My Texan friends even loved it and they are used to authentic guac. Making it again this weekend and will continue.

Excellent guacamole recipe...my sister and I use the same recipe, but we still have competitions for whose is better...you can easily add more cilantro, adjust the salt, cayenne pepper, etc. to make a more distinguished flavor.  I also like to leave my avocado a little chunkier!  Muy delicioso!

Making guac in an authentic stone Molcajete bowl makes this even better; I use jalapeno pepers instead of cayenne, and seed according to serving tastes (more seed=hotter taste!). I seed and juice the tomatoes as well so it is not to runny.  I often triple the recipe for crowds, it's that popular!

This is my go-to recipe for guacamole.  I prefer chunky guacamole, so I cube the avocados, add the other ingredients including the cayenne most definitely, and mix. Perfect.

I loved this! I mashed 2 of the avocados and diced the third one. The only deviations from the recipe were that I used Paula Deen's house seasoning instead of salt and I was out of tomatoes. Absolutely simple and delicious :)

Okay. I am finally reviewing this. This guac is the most amazing guac I've ever had. I make it ALL the time. My husband LOVES it and gets excited when I make it. He loves to dip chips ... and I love it on my rice, beans, tofu! Oh baby! I honestly couldn't tell you how many times I've made this in the past 8 months, ever since finding it!

I've been making a version of this recipe for a long time- with my own tweeks. I zest the lime after I juice it and mix it with the avo- this adds kick and helps keep the avos from browing as fast. I also add a jalapeno- chopped finely- and I only use red onion b/c I think the flavor is better than a white onion. Hope this helps!

Delicious.  This is a great and healthy snack.  I've shared this recipe on our GetAllergyWise.com blog because it's a recipe that is completely free of the 8 most common allergens. I didn't have a lime so subbed in fresh lemon juice.  (I can tell that adding the lime would have been it so much better!)  I also added 1/2 tsp ground cumin and 1/2 tsp dried oregano.

Delicious. I added more cayenne and would probably cut up a jalapeno next time to kick up the heat.

This was my first time making guacamole, and this dish came out as well (perhaps better) than any guacamole that I've had in restaurants! Delicious! I personally added fewer tomatoes and significantly more cayenne pepper for more kick. I'll definitely be using this recipe again!

The Best Guacamole i ever made it was wicked. the change i made was added 1/4 cumin and did not use vinegar and olive oil or cayenne pepper. Make sure your Avocados are not overly ripe just ripe enough that when u press they have medium firm touch but not squeezy.

I have to say I never review any recipe that I make from sites but hands down this is the best Guac ever.  I have made this about 20 times now and everytime I make I get asked for the recipe and to bring it again.  I do add more garlic then asked and cayenne pepper we like the kick.  I pour some garlic oil in the mix.  Thumbs up here!

Holy cow.  This is the best guacamole I've made, maybe the best I've had.  It goes so quickly at potlucks and parties that I've started doubling and even tripling the recipe each time I make it.  Simple, delicious, tasty, and easy to customize.  Thanks, Bob!

You know what I like about this recipe? I love the guacamole so much, that I eat very few chips (only use them as a scoop to get the guac!) I highly recommend!

I quadrupled this recipe.  Instead of Lime juice, I used Lemon Juice, and just splashed it over the avocados.  Turned out GREAT!!  And this was the first time I ever made it :)

This will be my go-to guacamole recipe -- it is excellent just the way it's written. For a little more kick, though, I might use freshly minced jalapeno instead of the cayenne.

This came out a little bitey for the tongue but I think it's because I couldn't find any ripe avocados. Everyone at the potluck really liked it.

This is the guacamole recipe I've been looking for!  It's really lime-y, which I like, but maybe start with about half the lime and add to taste.  Delicious!! :)

I was looking for a reciepe that tasted like the guacamole at the resturant "chipole". This ended up being better. I put a little less lime juice in mine than it called for and it turned out perfect!

Average.  In real guacamole, if tomatoes and onions are used, they should be finely chopped. Guacamole shouldn't be chunky.  Also, cayenne pepper is no substitute for jalapeno, serano, or some yummy Hatch green chilies. Don't get me wrong. I love cayenne. I use it a lot, but good guacamole requires real chilies.

I've never liked guacamole till I tried this recipe! One thing I learned from my mom is to add a little sour cream. It adds a rich flavor that many people don't recognize, but love! I actually added more lime juice and this stayed a nice green color in my fridge for three days. The only other thing I added was hot sauce and cumin. This is so yummy! My hubby and I are now fans of guac, but only if we make this recipe at home!

This made me absolutely love guacamole, whereas before I didn't think guacamole was all that exciting.  I had to buy the stuff to make it again the very next grocery trip.  I added cumin and sour cream.

This was my first attempt at guacamole, since my husband and I didn't even like it prior to finding a great one at a local restaurant.  THIS IS AWESOME!  I give out the recipe after making it for potucks.  I do modify it somehwat.  I have never used the garlic nor the cayenne pepper.  I use 1 serrano pepper, seeds removed and finely chopped. That, the lime, cilantro and salt make avocados sing!

FAB!  Loved this!  I love garlic so I added more but other than that made as it!  Found myself dipping into the leftovers the next day with just a spoon!  YUM YUM.  Would recommend this to anyone.

Quite good.  Added a bit more garlic than it called for.  It was a lot of work...I think I'd rather just open a seasoning packet, mash avocados and be done with it.

Usually I don't follow recipes on here exactly. Typically I read all the reviews and tweak recipes how I think I would like them. For this recipe I did not tweak it at all (unless you count using red onion, but it didn't specify what type) and it was FANTASTIC! I could hardly keep my hands off it until it was time to serve.   I mashed the avocados with the lime juice and salt, and the rest of the ingredients I chopped together in my food processor, then added to the avocados. Soooooo good.

Made as is with few modifications for personal taste: cut down to 1/2 lime juiced, used red onion, used extra cilantro, increased to 3 roma tomatoes, used extra garlic, and covered top with cayenne pepper to taste ... YUM! Perfect blend of taste and textures! I've made this countless times and always loved!

Love this recipe. Also to keep the guac from turning brown keep a pit or two from the avocado in the finished product and it will stay green until its gone!

This was great!  One of our good friends who "didn't prefer" guac even said that if his wife made it this way he "might" eat it more...that was after he finished licking the bowl!:) I omitted the cayenne since I don't really like hot.  If you put the pit back into the bowl and cover with plastic wrap so that it's touching the guac it will stay green longer. YUM!

My wife said this was the best cuacamole she had ever had.  Made some minor changes, left out the tomatoes because kids will not eat them in their guacamole.  Added 1/4 teaspoon white pepper and cut the cilantro in half.  It was the hit of Mexican dinner night at our house.

Yummy! The only change I made was I used only 1/2 of a tomato. The garlic-lime-cilantro combo really make this guac great.

Yum! I used 1 avocado and adjusted all of the other ingredients accordingly. Add garlic powder as well as garlic clove. Tossed in some extra cilantro as well! Oh! And I used lemon instead of lime.. I will make this every time we eat Mexican!

This is absolutely the best guac recipe I've ever made!  Fresh, zippy, and keeps well for a few days if you put plastic wrap on the surface of the guacamole to keep it from browning.  Thanks!

This is similar to how I make it. I like to add diced sweet peppers and a finely diced jalapeno instead of the cayanne.

I always get rave reviews - the cilantro gives it such a fresh taste.

After moving away from a neighborhood with an assortment of latin american fair and quite possibly the best mexican restaurant restaurant in new york, I was really craving some delicious guacamole. This is a great recipe.  I will be making it over and over and over again.  I made no changes.

This is one of the best guacamole recipes I've ever had. I make this all the time and get rave reviews and requests for the recipe as often! The only modifications I perform are as follows: 1) for the onion, I use equal parts white and purple 2) I mix all ingredients the night before except the avacado and cayenne pepper. Even without the modifications, this is a 5+ star!

Excellent ingredients.  Much more texture and color than most guac recipes.  I added a 1/2 pouch of Hidden Valley Ranch dressing which gave it even more of a great flavor and kept people guessing what that delicious taste was.

Like many others, this was my first time making guacamole. I have bought premade guacamole a few times from the store-YUCK!! Anyway, this was AWESOME!! I'm hooked now! My family is big on mexican dishes and I will now be making this guacamole every time we make burritos, fajitas, etc. It adds the perfect amount of flavor and zip to complete the meal. Even my six year old son couldn't get enough of it. Thanks for such an excellent, simple recipe!

YUMMY! My husband has been craving guacamole lately and I have been tired of buying Whole Foods' yummy, but expensive small tub of guacamole.  Easy to prepare and I used my own fresh cilantro from my herb garden and cherry tomatoes.  I served it with Whole Foods' Restaurant Style tortilla chips (which are heaven!) and my husband and kids wanted to devour it and skip dinner altogether.  Thank you for a glorious recipe!

I added a little cumin powder in the place of the cayenne pepper and a teaspoon of lemon juice and it was awesome.  I will definitely make this again and again.

This was one of the best guacamole recipes I've ever tried!  I used 4 avocados instead of 3 to stretch the recipe a bit, and it still tasted great.  Mash 2 of the avocados well, and then keep 2 of the avocados very chunky for a good texture.

I also used a little more lime juice and salt in the recipe to bring out the flavor more.  

If the avocados are not totally ripe, try adding a few tablespoons of sour cream to make it a creamier guacamole.  Enjoy!

This was my first time ever making guacamole & it turned out fantastic. I added more cayenne because I didn't really think it was spicy. To make the guacamole less chunky I used my electric hand mixer to blend it all.

Really quick and easy recipe to assemble and super tasty. We love it. 
I tasted it before and after letting it sit in the fridge. 
Thought it was a little sour before but after resting, it was perfect. I used a little more cayenne pepper because we love spicy food. Thanks for sharing.

Excellent! The entire dish disapeared at our party! I feel guilty that people keep thinking I'm a great cook but its really because of all these recipes on this site! Thanks so much! I also used the red onion instead of yellow for more zing.

Excellent guacamole - pretty much just like I like it. My only modification would be to use 2/3 as much lime juice.

This is the best guacamole recipe ever!  I have made this quite a few times and each time it is delicious and gets eaten up very quickly.  The cayenne definitely adds some kick to your typical guacamole and that's what makes this recipe soo good.

The best guac I've ever had!  Made this for a family get-together and they loved it!  I used the end of a heavy drinking glass to mash up the avocados in a bowl and it worked great.  The lime juice kept the guac nice and bright for a couple days.  I added a tad less of the cilantro because I'm not a fan of it's "dishsoap" taste and it was still yummy without being overpowered by the herb.  Following advice from other members, I added about a 1 tsp. of cumin.  I had doubled the recipe.  I'll definitely make this again and again.

Fantastic - The only thing I changed was use 5 avacados instead of 3 - My family loved it!  It's such a hit that we'll be using it exclusively for some time to come as a side dish and chip dip.  I kept the leftovers in the fridge squeezing a lime over the top and covering each time.  It never changed color. Perfect.

Excellent recipe. I did feel however that this recipe is over salted. I only added 1/2 tsp. of salt and felt that it was still a touch too much. I will definitely make this again@

I usually buy my guacamole at the store already made, but was in the mood for something fresher this time. I am very glad I did. I did substitute the fresh tomato with salsa (drained). Perfect with chips or as a salad with lettuce and diced tomato.

This is a great recipe. I made this for class one day and everyone loved it and even asked if this was a family recipe; granted I used avocados that weren't that ripe yet since i was running around that morning buying the ingredients, but it still tasted better than any other guacamole I've ever had.

This guacamole is better than the fresh stuff I had in mexico.  I mashed two with a potatoe masher and chunked the last to give it more texture.  Next time I will add a little more cilantro.  Wonderful recipe.

MMMM!! This guac is great! I am a huge fan of guacamole and this is the best recipe I have come by so far. Much, much better than store bought mix. Nothing against the mixes, they are great too but I think it's the freshness that makes this recipe so good. I added chopped black olives and used a sweet vidalia onion, although not the whole thing. This is the sort of recipe that you should taste as you go along and do not use any measuring tools. It should be different every time you make it! Also, if you leave one of the avocado pits in the bowl w/the guac, it helps to keep it from turning brown. I use it in addition to the lime juice, but if you don't like lemon or lime, it's a good way to preserve your guac w/o using those. Great recipe! I can't wait for my boyfriend to get home so I can help eat it! Thanks!

Great recipe BUT be careful with the onion and/or garlic.  Followed the direction exactly and was too oniony/garlicky for my taste.  I wound up adding 2 more avocados and some lemon juice to "fix" it.  Came out great and everyone ate it up.  Next time I'll just omit or reduce the onion and garlic.

This is an excellent guacamole recipe.  I served homemade nachos with lime-cilantro fat free sour cream and this guacamole on the side.  I kept smacking my brother and father's hands because they were eating the guac and not the nachos!  Definitely a keeper!

Holy Moly! Good Guacamole! This was the best Guac I've ever had. The cilantro was the ticket in this recipe. I did take the advice of other reviewers and added less lime juice than the recipe suggested. Just added the lime juice a little at a time til it was to my liking. Excellent recipe, will make again often.

Fantastic!  What more can you say.  When refrigerating it, place the avocado pits in the bowl and cover. It'll keep the guac from turning brown.

This was a great recipe - a little bit too much lime - it overpowered the flavor of the avacados. I will definitely make this again, but only use half a lime.

Just like my favorite restaurant where I often make a meal out of the guac.  Also, leave the pits in the container to prevent browning.

Excellent recipe!  Tastes just like the guacamole in an authentic Mexican restaurant when one uses the juice of a lemon instead of that of a lime.  I love guacamole so much that I made it twice (I made it the second time using lemon juice after using lime juice the first time).  Big difference.  The lemon juice gave it more of a kick that was missing when I used lime juice. Just the same, this is a great recipe regardless of the juice that one chooses to use.  Thanks, Bob!

This is absolutely amazing.  What a hit - made it exactly as the recipe said, but parsley instead of cilantro.  Amazing.  Definately tasted better second day, will think ahead next time.  Amazing!

This is the best guacamole recipe ever.  I took it to a party last weekend and it was gone within 30 minutes.  There wasn't a speck of it left in the bowl.  I received compliment after compliment for it.  Guys usually aren't ones to compliment a girl on a dish, but I had three guys ask me for this recipe.  This was definetly a hit and I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe.

This was so light and fresh tasting.  I loved it.  I substituted the salt, minced garlic, and cayanne pepper with kosher salt, garlic powder, and black pepper.

This was good. I agree with the other reviewer who suggested to use juice from 3/4 of a lime. I also did not pass up the cayenne pepper. Next time I'll add a jalapeno pepper for more kick!

I thought this was a really good starter recipe.  I have NO experience making Guacamole, so, this made me look like I actually knew what I was doing. However  I think It could be tweaked here and there for improvement. But very good BASIC recipe.

This is really a fantastic recipe.  I doubled the recipe and took it to a Fiesta Bowl party.  It got rave reviews from absolutely everyone.  I cut back a little bit on the lime juice but that's just personal preference.  For those of you who don't think of guacamole as a dip, this will change your mind.

Absolutely the best. I can't even eat guac at other places. Everyone devours it when I bring it to gatherings. It works better when you remove seeds from tomatoes...less water comes out after refrigeration.  We also include lime pulp when we squeeze the juice.

This was exceptional! It is very easy to build more flavor into it if you need a little more of something else. We used red onion and diced it as fine as we possibly could to spread out the flavor and keep the kids from noticing and did the same with the cilantro ;-) As is, we loved the recipe and was a winner from 2 years old all the way to 70+! There wasn't any leftovers. That has to say something! I would say it yielded about 4 cups, if that helps anyone. Happy eating!

I am not a fan of guacamole personally but most everyone I know is. I made this as a side dish for visiting company and they loved it. They all agreed it was the best guac they ever had and all needed the recipe. Thanks for creating and posting this...obviously it's a true winner!

This makes really good guacamole! I made it for a Super Bowl party, and everybody loved it. Expect to spend a bit longer than it says because you really need to spend the time chopping/mashing up all the ingredients.

I never really liked Guacamole but now I love it. My husband made this recipe for a party and I practically hogged the bowl. I am currently obsessed now. This recipe is delicious as is but you can add a few jalapeños, which is also a nice addition.

Delicious and super easy!! Made this for the Super Bowl party I went to yesterday and EVERYONE wanted to know who brought it so they could ask how to make it. It was that good. It was my first attempt at this recipe and I was obviously very happy with how it turned out. I didn't change a thing. Just make it as is and watch everyone flip out! This will be the only guac recipe I use from now on

My family loved it. I made it during second quarter and the bowl was empty halfway  through half time. I only gave it 4 stars because I thought it was a little heavy on the lime. But it was still great.

I've recently developed an affection for guacamole.  For some reason I thought making it would be difficult.  Apparently not!  After watching it made table side at a restaurant recently I realized it was something I could easily make.  When I saw avacados on sale the other day I thought "I gotta try this".  The only change I made was instead of the cayenne I substituted 1/2 jalapeno, seeds removed, for 4 servings.  It was FANTASTIC!  This is an easy, quick, delicious recipe.  Try it, you won't be disappointed!

Rated excellent by all those who ate it.  Simple to make and even our experienced "expert" guacamole tasters found this to be one of the very best they have ever had.  I cut the salt and used powdered onion and garlic to suit the likes of my guests.  The pieces of fresh minced onion and garlic while perhaps the choice of a chef, is not the choice of the majority of my guests and so the powdered  substitution was preferred and did not diminish the flavor.

ALMOST PERFECT!

My (spicy) tweaks:
Add sriracha to taste (TRUST ME IT'S PERFECT)
Add 1/2 red bell pepper
Add 1-2 small hot peppers of choice
Add another 1/2 or whole juiced lime

This recipe is delicious! I'm a huge avocado fan. We did make a few changes to it. Instead of 3 avocados we did 5 since the ones we had were on the smaller side. Didn't add any cilantro or cayenne pepper. We used 1 Roma tomato instead 2. Also added a little lemon juice instead of lime to keep the avocados from turning brown.We will definitely be making it again.:)

WHA!!! I am 40+ years old and it took me this long to find out how to make delicious guacamole! Don't be me. Make this. Share it with the people you love the most. Eat quickly and then make them share their portion with you. Lick the bowl. Repeat. You won't be disappointed.

What can I say except that 'look at how many positive reviews are here'. It is a FANTASTIC recipe. However, I 'tweaked' it a little to have been able to keep it for a week without oxidation. I replaced the tomatoes with a very dark green bell pepper and cilantro with Italian parsley. Also, I added white onion and a jalapeno (of course, you can add less if it is too spicy)...and 4-5 cloves of garlic. With so much of vitamin C (from the parsley and some from the bell pepper), the 1-week preservation in my fridge allows me to use it in my salads, on my quinoa burger and whatever strikes my fancy. Oh, and it is so green that it is almost flluorescent...just beautiful!!! Too bad there is only a 5-star max....it deserves five more!

First time trying guacamole.  I thought this was very good and only giving the 4 stars for it "as is" because I haven't made any other to compare.  However, having read the reviews either on this recipe or another, it suggested putting one of the pits in the mix to keep it from turning brown.  Not sure if that is what did the trick, but my guac is now 4 days old and not brown.  For the one who said it gets too soupy, I suggest scooping the seeds, etc. out of the tomatoes as i think maybe another reviewer suggested. Oh...and I read somewhere that when buying your avocados, flick off the stem...if it is brown underneath, don't buy it...it will be "yucky" too.

I was never really a fan of guacamole until my husband tried this recipe. It is fantastic! We go heavy on the cayenne and cilantro, and sometimes don't even use the tomatoes.  It is quick and easy, and tastes so much better than anything you can buy at the grocery store or even most restaurants around here!  To keep it from turning brown so fast, place plastic wrap directly on the guacamole, and press it down to get rid of all the air.

This was an awesome guac! Will definitely make again. Will probably add a double pinch of cayenne pepper next time as we like things spicier.

Interesting.  I have been making this same recipe since 1988 without the cayenne pepper.  I got it from a Mexican restaurant in Phoenix, AZ.  The fresh minced garlic and "green" onions are the most important ingredients.  I squeeze and discard the pulp out of the tomatoes before chopping them.  Once in awhile I will add a pinch of Lawry's Seasoned Pepper and Lawry's Seasoned Salt.

This is by far my favorite favorite favorite guacamole recipe.  It is fantastic.  Follow the recipe exactly and you won't be disappointed.  I add a little fresh jalapeño, diced up, for some extra heat.  Everyone loves when I make this recipe. Thanks so much for sharing :)

I followed the recipe exactly the first time I made it (except for the cilantro, which I think tastes like soap). I love the flavor overall, and it's super-easy to make! I've made it several times since then, personalizing a bit each time: 1) I add the garlic using a press, so there's no danger of anyone biting into a chunk of raw garlic. 2) I add the lime juice a little at time, because the amount of juice in "one lime" varies (and I ruined a batch by not tasting.) 3)I use less tomato and onion, because I prefer a smoother texture with less "stuff" in it. (Maybe the small avocados I buy are not what was used in the original recipe?) Also, when I made this guacamole today, the avocados had large pits and less fruit, so I also cut back on the salt a little.

this is a good recipe I didn't have any cilantro and I didn't use onion personal preference, but the rest I did as written and we loved it! Will make again.  I like cilantro but to us a little goes a long way it can over power a dish if you use to much, but that is also personal preference.  Easy to make very yummy.

I tried this and my husband and I liked it. It is awesome except that the juice of one whole lime seems to be much. I'll try next time with just a three quarter lime juiced.

Awesome recipe! I made it without cilantro as I am not a big fan of it.  I used a small yellow onion instead of measuring a 1/2 cup. I also used two vine tomatoes in place of the Roma... Turned out delicious! I had handmade corn tortillas that i sliced into 4 and fried them for homemade corn chips. DELICIOUS!

This recipe is amazing and we make it for all family events. We dice a jalapeño pepper for more spice. It is by far better than guacamole from any restaurant we've tried!

This is the BEST guacamole recipe out there!! The only thing I did was added a bit of jalapeno vs cayenne pepper...YUM...even my Hispanic co-workers think it's great!  **Just a quick tip they taught me...put the avocado pits back in the guacamole until time to serve..it keeps it from turning brown!!

Instead of finely minced garlic I just added garlic powder to taste. The minced, uncooked garlic is too bitter for me. If you prefer to use fresh garlic without it being extremely bitter - cut garlic clove in half and take out the middle part that comes out easily. To make the guacamole less watery: 1. salt the onions and set aside because it leeches out the water. Drain when you're ready to add to everything else. 2. Cut the tomatoes in half at the equator and squeeze out the pulp. Dice as usual.

I am a novice to the dip-making world. And this recipe was extremely easy! It is also delicious. Smooth. Zesty. And the lime wasn't too overpowering. 
I agree with some of the other reviews...definitely took more than 10 minutes to chop up and mix everything together but wasn't time consuming at all. Also, it makes WAY more than 4 servings. I brought it to a holiday dinner with about 8 people and had about 1/3 left over still.
I will make this again for sure!

This gauc was delicious!! A lil tip I learned from a Mexican restaurant by my house was if you add a tablespoon of sour cream it keep the dip from browning for as long as three days. Just make sure to refrigerate :)

This is an excellent recipe and it was my first time making guacamole from scratch. Only things I have to add to other reviews are: 1) be careful about not adding too many onions, I think 1/2 c is just about the upper limit of my preference, I'd rather make it thicker by adding an extra tomato, or if you really like onions, consider adding onion powder instead, unless you really enjoy raw, diced onions in your recipes. Next time, I would probably add a bit more garlic too. 2) 1 tsp of salt would have been way too much for me, I stopped at 3/4 tsp. and even less would have been desirable. I used 1 extra avocado than the recipe calls for (though mine were smaller in size), and that worked out well. 4) Finally, I substituted fresh parsley for cilantro, I think that either parsley or cilantro are key to  adding a nice flavor to this recipe.

Very good, I didn't add the tomatoes and added quite a bit more garlic just cuz that's what we like didnt have fresh cilantro so i used the dried.  I think it would have taked best with the fresh of course and also had to subsitute lemon juice instead of lime.  Can't wait to try it with all the right ingredients, we still loved with what we had :)

This is basically the guac that I have been making for years, and it's always delicious!  If you omit the avocados you have a basic "pico de gallo" salsa.  I've also replaced the avocados with fruit like mango to make mango salsa... Very Yummy...

If you don't have tomatoes and cilantro on hand you can add about 1/2 cup of salsa instead. Also, if you are from the South you might want to sprinkle some Tony's or Slap Ya Mama on top too.

Perfect recipe as is. No adjustments needed. The only thing I did different was add a little olive oil - but that's just preference and definitely not needed. I'm keeping this recipe handy because I know I"ll be using it often!

Holy GUACAMOLE!  This is awesome.  I had no lime but used lemon instead and it was great!  I am too old to hurl my upper body and head towards the ground like a toddler, but if I could this stuff would have made me do cartwheels...seriously, it is that good.

This is the best recipe for guac on here- hands down. I have made it as is many times and it's always great.
I sometimes doctor it up with Jalapeno peppers to give it a bit more zip when the kids aren't eating it. 
Also great to add is hot sauce from the Yucatan or Tapatio and Adobo seasoning with cumin.
I also love to add a dash or two of Cumin and a little extra Garlic (not that it needs it- I'm a garlic fanatic).
Thanks for sharing!

This stuff is to die for!!!I have made a lot of versions of guacamole, but they have never been good enough for my rather high standards. (I am my own worst critic in the kitchen) It was so awesome, but next time, I will lighten up on the salt just a tad. It was a bit salty for me (and I LOVE salt) But regardless, it was a hit, everyone loved it, even the kids who "don't like avocado"

I like to add more garlic, a couple teaspoons worth. Also, to stretch the guacamole and give it a chunkier texture, I add 3/4 cup of chopped iceberg lettuce.

Delish!  I used green onion and left out the garlic and cayenne and replaced them with 2 seeded jalapenos.  Since first trying this recipe I have found a fresh salsa sold at Sam's Club that has all the ingredients so now I keep that on hand for making guac.  Just mash avocados, use a slotted spoon to scoop and add the fresh salsa to taste, add salt and lime juice.  It's a real time saver and so delicious.  **A tip - when buying avocados choose those that still have the little end of the stem attached, otherwise the top of the avocado will be brown upon slicing.**

I've made my guac this way for years--everyone raves about it. I use red onion and usually grape tomatoes. Also add a diced jalapeno and a splash of hot sauce. Great recipe!

Delicious! My one recommendation to maximize the flavor is to mix all ingredients except the avocados either a few hours before or even the night before. Add the avocado right before serving. Tastes great!!

DON'T BE FOOLED by other guacamole recipes.  This one is THE BEST, by far, EVER!!!!
Red onion is delicious in this recipe.  I must admit, several others have mentioned adding cumin so I think I might try that next time I make this.

This is a great recipe my whole family loves. It can be made up on a moments notice and there is never any left. Suggestion: to keep from turning brown quickly place seed in middle of guacamole until ready to serve.

Fantastic recipe. It made it for cinco de mayo party and it was a hit. I followed most of the recipe to an exact. Instead of ground cayenne I used crushed red pepper flakes and then added about a tsp of light mayo to give it a creamier texture. It was excellent. 5 stars

Excellent and simple if you are looking for something mild.  That said, I left out the optional cayenne pepper.  I also cut back slightly on the onion, used one roma tomato, and used dried cilantro (obviously scaled back) as I didn't have fresh.  Wil definitely make again!

I made this recipe just as listed and it was awesome!  I'm not a huge lover of guacamole, but I wanted a recipe for my first bat a a 7 layer salad.  This is the best recipe for guacamole that I have ever tasted!!  I even added the pinch of cayenne!!  Thank you Bob Cody for sharing this!!

Very flavorful- I used jalapeno peppers instead, but it tasted great too! Otherwise, I would recommend that you stick to the recipe (portions were not too important to watch, however) because these specific ingredients gave it that fresh, restaurant-quality guacamole!

Use parsley instead of cilantro and red pepper flakes instead of cayenne pepper since that's what I had on hand. Still great, but a tad too limey.

Great, easy and quick!  This was a 1st time try for me and it's delicious!  I used 6 avocados (3 mashed & 3 chopped), 4 Roma tomatoes, 1 1/2 jalapeños as well as minced garlic.  This  recipe is definitely a keeper!

I've used this recipe for a few years now, and always get rave reviews.  The only change I make...I use granulated garlic.  No biting into raw garlic.  Delish!

Excellent but a little too salty - 1/2 t. would've been better for our tastes & same on garlic - but all around it's great (as we are all devouring it right now :)

To be honest, I don't like guacamole. However, I make this recipe for my friends and family because they love it. Everyone agrees that it is the best guacamole they have ever had. Definitely a keeper.

This is the second time I have made this.  I had all the ingredients with the exception of the romas, so I subbed salsa.  It is still terrific.  The magic ingredient for me is the cayenne pepper.  It makes it magical !!!!!

Best guacamole I've ever made!  Didn't have cayenne but used some ground cumin and adobo seasoning.  Only made the serving size in the recipe for my nephews 2nd birthday party and it was gone within 15 minutes!

Ive made this twice and its probably the Best Guacomole Ive had. Delicious, and if I can make it, anyone can. Was surprised at how easy it is to make.  I halved the salt called for in the recipe since the first batch was slightly salty, but otherwise great.

I am famous for my guacamole and salsa (d's salsa-on this site made with mexican style stewed tomatoes instead of plain). I blend 2 of the avocados and cut the other into small chunks for texture. Also blend the onion and one tomato and leave the other tomato in small chunks. I sprinkle cayenne pepper all over the top once everything is blended and then mix it in. Now and then I'll add just a pinch of garlic powder and cumin for some extra flavor but usually I don't add anything!! Thanks for the recipe!!

I love guacamole and this is great (and easy to adjust to your tastes).  I always use garlic salt instead of salt and garlic in mine, but i'm sure the fresh garlic is great.  For heat, my family has always used tabasco sauce, a few dashes or so.  I also like the cilantro, but don't always have it, and it's great both ways!

DANKNESS!!! Made it today followed the recipe for 2 servings. 

I added a dash of ground cumin and pepper. I also added in a Serrano pepper (its a cousin of the jalapeno)  to kick up the heat. The heat is not unbearable, but yet adds great flavor.

Delicious! I used my little food processer to chop everything and it was really quick and easy. I made it for a Hispanic family and they said it tasted very authentic and insisted on keeping the leftovers.

I made this and I thought it was great! My husband, who is from the west coast however, did not. So I added about a 1/3 cup of regular mayonaise and boy oh boy!! We cannot stop eating it now!This was my first time making gaucamole and now I cannot get enough!! Thanks for the recipe! Oh and I cut back to 1/2 a lime. That was enough for us:)

this is wonderful!! my roommate and i are loving it, and neither of us are big on onions or tomatoes. i think next time i'll add less cayenne pepper though. too much of a kick for me, but still delicious! i'll definitely be using this recipe again.

If you have a jar of pickled jalapeno you can also pour some of that liquid in the guacamole it also helps so it will not brown. Plus the extra spicy makes it delicious.

The best guacamole ever, especially if you like cilantro. Unfortunately, the cilantro flavor does not last if you refrigerate this and eat the next day. So serve fresh!

This was very good.  I preferred it after it sat in the refrigerator and the flavors blended.  I thought there was a little much of the lime juice, salt, and cilantro for my taste but would definitely make again.

I use half a lime...a full lime makes it a little too juicy.  Also, I use more salt and more cayenne pepper.  This is amazing, everyone gobles it up right away!

Definitely 5 stars. I used cilantro paste because I'm lazy and used a bit more garlic. This is delicious and I can't wait to make it again.

Really good. It was supposed to be an appetizer while waiting for the steak to cook.... You know, 3 avocados for 2 people.... I even assumed we would have some leftover... but you know what happens when you assume things... Now i'm in trouble for filling us up before he finished the steak!

This is now a staple and I've become "known" for my guac.  It's so fresh... People are always amazed when I share the recipe and they see how easy it is!

I think the best part is how easy it is to 'tweek' for individual tastes.  I have a good friend who loves heat and hates cilantro, so I make a batch heavy on the cayenne with no cilantro for her.  I'm just the opposite, so I make a second batch heavy on the cilantro with no cayenne for me.  Both have a little extra garlic and lime juice as we both love those...

This was one of the best Guacamole's I ever had!! Since I didn't have any limes I used lemons, but that was the only thing I changed. I would defiantly recommend this to anyone.

For serving four, add 1/3 tablespoon cumin and 1/3 tablespoon of jalapeno pepper flakes.

For a typical party serving six is a good quantity.

I thought it was very good and tastes like the guacamole in the Mexican restaurants. The only thing I did different was use 1 fresh jalapeno pepper and added one more table spoon of cilantro to give it a little bit more of a kick just like the restaurants. I put all my ingredients into the bowl before I mixed it all together with a fork. The consistency was not as mushy.

This totally didn't do it for me. Nothing about it seemed "right". Too much tomato, onion, not enough lime and cilantro. No bite to it whatsoever.

First time making Guacamole. It turned out beautifully, and even my husband (who claims he hates guacamole) loves it!

My mom and I were nervous to make our first guac, but this recipe is AMAZING. We omitted the cayenne pepper since we're fans of mild food.. this is still the BEST guac I've ever tasted.

I thought the recipe was excellent, but it might be better to add lime juice as you're mashing so you don't end up with too much.  I felt like it was watery and very limey.  I think the avacados I used were on the small side.  If I make it again, I will use less salt, less lime juice (perhaps I'll add some zest).  Overall though, it had spot-on flavor.

This is our favorite guacamole recipe. I've made it several times so far and everyone loves it. I've started adding 1/2 of a small minced jalapeno pepper w/o the seeds to give it a perfect little kick. I'm not a fan of hugh heat, so you could add more if you wanted to kick it up. Love Love Love this recipe.

Very good flavor!!  Make sure you let it set for an hour before serving--the flavor is much better that way!  I left the seeds in the bowl until I served the guacamole to help it not turn brown, and it worked out perfect!!

I cannot cook to save my life. My sister's neighbor gave me 2 avacados last week and I figured what the heck, I will give it a try! This is the most amazing guacamole I have ever had. Now I finally have something I will gladly offer to bring to the next family get together, thanks!

Fantastic!  I added some chopped fresh jalapenos and a little cumin, as my husband hates cilantro.  It was excellent.  I make it all the time now.  Even better with extra lime juice.

Definitely a tried and true gauc recipe.  Much healthier than the creme chese guac thats served down south.  I think people tend to eat healthier in New England so thats why this is a the common guac you get a most mexican places up here.

If I could add more stars I would.  This is the first time in my life I have ever made guacamole, although the stuff from the store is pretty good but this recipe blows commercial brands out of the water!  Thank you for sharing.  Donna in Calgary

This is SO good! When I arrived home from the grocery store one of my large avocados had busted at the seems, so I decided to look up a guacamole recipe on here. With almost 2 thousand reviews I just had to try this one. I am so glad I did! I ate the entire bowl with tortilla chips for lunch!! The only changes I made were I used onion powder and garlic powder because it was faster and easier. So good! Thanks!

When i don't put in cilantro it is to die for - i don't like the taste/smell it gives it. I make it at least once a week!! Make sure your Avocado is nice and "mushy" when you buy it if you want to make it right away - otherwise buy a hard one and put it in your fruit bowl on the counter until you are ready to make it

I have never been a big fan of guacamole, but made this at home one night and devoured it! The second time, I didn't add any cayenne. For me, there is enough bite from the onion and garlic I don't need any extra spice. I took it to a party and it got rave reviews!

Not much to say, really - but had to rate 5 stars since it deserved it.  Truly a wonderful, well rounded in flavor guac.  We've made it several times - and whenever we make it for company or social occasions, we get rave reviews :)  Highly recommend.

I have mafe this recipe several times already and it is fantastic.  The only change I made was omitting the cayenne pepper and using diced jalapeno pepper instead.  I think the diced tomatoes are the key to making this taste so good.

I only rate recipes when they're outstandingly good.  This recipe is so fantastic, that I made it several times in the same week!  Definitively a keeper, and I didn't change a thing (although I did eye-ball most of the recipe, since it's so quick and easy)!  5 Stars Recipe!

This is fantastic.  Instead of roma tomatoes I used a drained can of Rotel with lime and cilantro.  This must be a new product for Rotel.  It really works!!  For whatever reason kosher salt makes this even better.

FANTASTIC!   4 in the family.  2 are not crazy about guacamole.  I tried this recipe tonight (minus the cilantro, I don't care for).  A HIT!  I used the food processor to smooth it out and folded in the tomatoes after transferring to a bowl.  We ALL enjoyed it!  This recipe is a keeper.

Look no further! This is the only guac recipe you will ever need. I have made this more times than I can count - always a huge hit. My family likes chunky guac, so I use a potatoe masher, and try to keep mashing to a minumum. Add lots of medium diced roma tomatoes - definitely seed before chopping or else guac gets too runny. Be bold with extra lime and garlic. I add a few shots of sricha hot chili sauce. All to taste of course. Enjoy!

I have never made guacamole before and now that I've made this I don't know why it took me so long to try.  This is super easy to make and tastes SO much better than the mushy store bought stuff.  I took this to a friend's house for quesadilla night and it was devoured, even by the avacado haters.  Thanks for a GREAT recipe!

Loved the guacamole!  I pureed the avocados & lime juice until smooth and then added in the remaining ingredients.  After taste-testing it, I added in more onion and cilantro.  Yum!

***Update!! I still make this all the time, but now I use the food processor to chop the tomatoes, onion, cilantro and garlic. I then add the salt and lime juice and let the mixture sit in the fridge for a few hours. 1 hour before serving I mash and add the avocados. This way the flavors blend really well without the avocados browning!!***Delicious! Followed the recipe exactly except I did not add cayenne pepper because I'm not good with spicy. This was delicious and will be my guac recipe from now on! A tip that I learned--buy avocados that are dark in color and soft to the touch--when you cut them they will fall apart easily!

Use food processor for cilantro, onion, and garlic. Much easier and faster! I used two sharp knives to mash the avocados- slice each one in opposite directions. I also took the seeds out of the tomatoes.

Excellent guacamole...very fresh and great taste.  I used red onion and grape tomatoes because that's what I had on hand.  It will be yummy with the taco salad that I'm serving for dinner tonight.

This is truly a great guac recipe.  Every time I make it the crowd goes wild.  My best advice is to just make it to taste though. The taste of this guac also intensifies overnight so don't go crazy adding more ingredients if it seems bland at first. Wait until the next day so you have a better idea of what it's going to taste like.  Also, make a little more than you need so that you can taste it and still have enough for everyone

We've made many batches of Guacamole and I think this is the best! Only thing I would change is to chop the Cilantro a little finer and maybe mash the tomatoes before adding to avacado. Excellent!

I have never made guacamole before.  But I will again.  And again.  Using this recipe of course.  I was amazed by the incredible amount of flavor produced by such an easy and simple recipe to make.  Truly, a perfect blend.

IF YOU HAVE CHILDREN: Although this recipe is a 5-star as is, I made a few adjustments to accomodate my picky eaters.. 1). Instead of crushing fresh garlic, I substituted the regular salt with garlic salt. 2). Instead of diced onion, I used onion powder. 3). Use LOTS of cilantro! 4). Use chili powder instead of cayenne pepper. I made the recipe using heirloom tomatoes ( my personal preference). This guac is FABULOUS!!!!

i just wanted to see the recipe because every time i see a "Mexican" recipe,its just disappointing...because people change a lot of ingredients,or people think because it has tomato and onion,or pepper (chile),they think its Mexican!! but this recipe its real Mexican guacamole.. i'm telling you,i was born and raised there and i know what a mexican guacamole is, great recipe,it goes really good with tortilla chips,a bbq,or just as a sider on any other meal.. usally meat,or chicken :)

excellent recipe...only suggestion is to use a seeded jalapeno pepper instead of the cayenne pepper.  It gives added flavor.  You can always add the cayenne if you need more heat when finished.  Thanks for sharing

This is the guacamole recipe I've been looking for, and it will now be in my favorite recipes file!  I followed the recipe as written, except I did add 1/2 tsp. cumin and 1/2 serrano pepper (chopped and seeded)for some more spice.  Only complaint was it was a little salty esp. when served with chips, so next time I will put 1/2 teaspoon salt instead of a full teaspoon.  Good tip I read from other reviewers---keep the seeds of the avocado in the guacamole until ready to serve---it really helped prevent it from turning brown! (Even with the seeds in it, though, definitely use it the day you make it, as it is very perishable!)Also, I recommend cutting the cilantro very fine--as you don't want full leaves in the guacamole. Thanks Bob!

This is absolutely the best guac I've ever had! I've made it twice now, and it was devoured by friends.  The only thing I do differently because I know my "audience" is that I add some pureed jalapenos to give it just a little kick.

Oh so tasty! I do not care for store-bought guac, so thought I did not like guac in general. But this recipe has made me a convert. I added a little cumin as suggested by others since I like cumin. All of the ingredients do not overwhelm the avocado, just enhance it. Thanks for the great recipe!

Awesome! This is a great guacamole. The only thing I did differently was add a bit more garlic to suit our tastes. We will be making this again-many times over! Note: To mash the avocado I used a meat tenderizer. It made it just a bit chunky which was perfect for us-worked like a charm! THANKS!

Absolutely delicious!!! I LOVE guacamole and I thought that this recipe was the BOMB.  I blended the ingredients in my mini-foodprocessor and it turned out great.  I served atop chicken fajitas with sourcream, red peppers, onions and chedder cheese. Yum!! Better than eating at a restaurant :)  P.S. I did not use cayenne paper the initial time and recipe still turned out great, also I did not refrigerate prior to initial serving and still delish.

Turned out really nice aside from the lime. An entire lime is way too potent and I noticed that each bite taste like almost straight lime followed by a typical guac aftertaste. It's still good, but 1/4 to half a lime would have been much, much better off.

This was my first time I made something from avocados. I got nice green firm ones, very expensive and a few hours before potluck I started to make it. WARNING: If you are fist timer with avocados: Don’t refrigerate them and buy ripe one. We had to run to the restaurant and by some guacamole. Was cheaper than the avocados I bought. Anyway, I made the recipe a few days later and it took we much longer than the time in recipe. Make sure you cook it a couple of hours before eating, I thought it tasted better after a few hours. It was very good; just I thought the lime tastes dominant. Maybe my lime was too big. My mom thought the lime was too much too. Husband thought it is good. 

Will make it again, but will keep trying some other recipes.

This is awesome.  I was told if you leave the pits in the dip it'll keep the green color longer.

Wonderful! Its like pico de gallo with avocado. I added some fresh minced jalapeno and a couple of dashes of hot pepper sauce. We've decided we like this chunky guacamole so much better than the creamy.

The ingredients for this guacamole were perfect; however I think the quantity of ingredients was a little off.  Though I was hesitant to do so, I made the guacamole exactly as directed.  There ended up being too much lime juice and it over-powered the flavors of everything else.  I understand the importance of the lime juice to preserve freshness, but I would recommend using only half a lime.

Ohhhhhhh yeah.  I only had one big avocado so I kind of eyeballed some of the ingredients after scaling the recipe down to 2 servings but woooooowwwww.....that's excellent stuff.  I also reduced the salt-just a pinch.  The chips I had are salty enough.  I imagine you'd want it with flour tortilla chips, though.  I used dried cilantro and it worked just fine.

Sometimes there is nothing better than a fresh guacamole. This was wonderful and got rave reviews from friends. I used extra cilantro because I worship it and a little less salt than called for. This was great and it makes me realize how much i'm going to miss summer.

We absolutely loved this!  It was delicious.  My husband added a little bit of chili powder and it really was good.  We even froze half of it in a ziploc baggy and after thawing a few days later, it was even better. Much better than the kind we buy at the store!

So I have not actually made this guacamole myself, but I will be very soon! A friend of mine made it and it was FANTASTIC!!! I'd give it 12 stars if I could. Definitely the best guacamole I've ever had...even better than Chipotle's! 

**I made this yesterday...it wasn't as good as when my friend made it. I'm not really sure why. But it was still really good! I didn't make any changes to the recipe.

Mmm this guacamole is awesome. I chopped the avocados because I like it chunky. I put onion, garlic, cilantro and jalepenos in the food processor (my husband doesn't like a strong taste of these things). When mixed with the lime juice, it coated the guac well and gave a great flavor throughout. Added cumin as others suggested. Yummy!

not bad at all.  Very easy to make.  I think that I should have waited a day or two to make it so I could let my avacados ripen a bit more but over all pretty good.  I will make this again.

As is, this is not near as spicy as I feel it should be - a pinch of cayenne does nothing - I added a least a teaspoon as well as just as much chipotle chile pepper to kick it up a bit - I also found a whole lime juiced would make it much too watery - I used half if that.  

I also don't mash the avacados - by the time the mixing is done, it's mashed up enough in the end.

I only made 1/2 the recipe and wish I had made it for 4 as listed now.  It is absolutely amazing as promised.  If you only use 1/2 the avacodo, be sure to use the part without the seed.  Place the empty shell from the side you did use over the part you are keeping (with the pit still in it) and wrap both with plastic wrap. It will keep a lot longer for some reason.  

Great recipe and thanks for sharing!  Lorrie

I HATE GUACAMOLE!  I loved this stuff.  Onion and garlic flavors, lots of chunks and texture.  A delightful blend of spices. MAde my own tortlla chips in the oven and my hubby thought he had gone to heaven. I'm a convert now and am delighted to be able to eat avacados - they're so healthy for you!

As written, I found that this recipe produced an excellent guacamole, but way too salty. I used something like 4 cloves of garlic. Next time I will half the salt.

My first time making guacamole. Superb is the only word that comes to mind. I cut the recipe to just one serving and omitted the cilantro (not a fan of it). . Mine could have been a little colder, so next time I will leave in the refrigerator a little longer. Thanks for the recipe!

I had to leave out the red onions, pepper, cilantro and garlic to adjust to a friend's preferences but this was amazing that way too. I think it would be even better next time when I follow the recipe entirely.

I think this could be great guacamole, but way to much lime. i don't think I used a big lime. The lime flavor just took over. It stayed very green never got that gross brown color i think because all the lime. I will make again and cut back on the lime. Thanks for the recipe.

It is great, but use your good judgment on taste. I didn't put all the lime juice in and I also put only 1/4 cup onion in it.  Was a little salty and still onion potent so I added 1 more avocado and WOW now it's perfect.

What's the big deal here?  This is just a standard Guacamole recipe.  Down here in Texas, this is standard fare, so I'm not sure why all the hype.  As a matter of fact, what other way would you make it?  This is pretty basic folks.

I don't know if I had a realy juicy lime, but it tasted too much like lime juice.  I liked the taste, but it wasn't the guacamole taste I was going for.  It tasted to me like I was eating it with thoes lime flavored tortilla chips.  So if you love thoes, this would be a good recipe for you!  To mash all the ingredients up good, I just put everything in my food processor, that worked really well!

Fantastic!  Just the right blend of spices and I think the cayenne rounds it out perfectly.  I've been searching for the perfect guacamole recipe and now my search is over.  To stretch it to the second day, cover it with plastic wrap, but be SURE the plastic is right on top of the guac, leaving no air.  Then, the next day, simply scrape off the top layer and your guac is good as new:)

I took the advice of the other reviewers and used red onion instead of white.  Also used onion and garlic powder.  The hot sauce gives it a tang, but if anyone is sensitive to heat, stick with the small cayenne pinch.  I like it so I used two jalapenos hot sauce and a dash of cayenne.  Yee-hah its GOOD

Excellent recipe! I used red onions and since we aren't big fans of cilantro, I used parsley instead. No need to look further; this is the best.

Very tasty and simple to make. Instead of mashing all the avacadoes, i chopped one instead. Turned out nice. My husband loves it as well. This recipe is a keeper. :o)

Despite all the rave reviews, I didn't think this was very good. I've tried a few kinds in my day, so it comes down to personal taste. Perhaps I would leave out the onions (I usually love onions) and add more garlic. Or use green onions. Also, blend avocados, garlic, and other spices in the food processor. Stiring in the tomatoes by hand. Maybe even add some sour cream.

If I could give this more stars I would.  This is what I consider perfect guacamole.  It tastes as good as the guacamole from my favorite restaurant and I can't believe I made it!  I didn't change a single thing except for I add more than a dash of cayenne pepper.  After my friend tried this at she told me I should be a chef.  YUM!

WOW! WOW! WOW!  This is awsome!!  I know how to make a mean salsa, but have never mastered quacamole.  With this recipe you can't fail!!!!  I would use less salt though, a little salty for my families taste.

I really, really loved this recipe.  And it's prepared just how i like it - oniony, garlicky good. Instead of cayenne tho I cup up some serrano chilis. My only thought however, is that if there's anyone who appreciates garlic and onions but isn'ts big lover they may not enojy this as much.  Grant it i used red onions which kicked it up a couple notches...just keep it mind!  Wonderful recipe!!!!

I hate guacamole but made this for a party. I only used 1 tbsp. of cilantro because to me anyway, it had an overwhelming odor. The people at the party loved this recipe but all agreed that 3 tbsp of cilantro would've been way too much.

Great recipe. Will definately make this again. I like it better when there are some chunks of avocado and will save some bigger pieces to mix in at the end. For a creamier texture, try mixing in 1/4 cup of mayonnaise for every 2 avocados  used. Thanks for submitting this quick and easy recipe.

My boyfriend, who frequents Mexico on business, claims this is the best guacamole ever.  I was very generous with the cilantro and even added on one whole diced jalapeno for extra kick.  This stuff is addictive!

This is fantastic!! My first time making homemade guac, and I must say I love it! I didn't change a thing. The only problem I have is I like my guac a little more smooth. I don't know how to make it that way without it turning out runny. I will always use this recipe and I'll never change it. Thank you so much for sharing!!

Oh so wonderful with Haas avocados.  I skip the tomatoes and add a little adobo, as well.  My boyfriend likes it on toast, believe it or not.

For some reason this was really salty.  I even added an extra avacado.

A great guac recipe!  I use my food processor and process the onion, cilantro and garlic a little first.  Then add the rest and process to the texture I like.  Chop the tomatoes by hand and stir in at end.  Always gets great compliments!

This was a hit.  Even my 8yr old son loved it and he has always HATED guacamole.  I will be making my guacamole instead of buying it from now on.

This was a big hit with everyone.  I substituted Frontera Tomatillo salsa for the tomatoes (1/4 cup) in the recipe and it worked out great.  I plan to use this again very soon.

Good stuff.  We used this with the Oven Baked Chicken Chimi from the site.  Did make a few adjustments, though.  Reduced the amount of cilantro and lime juice.  It turned out great.  Thanks for the post.

Finally, the perfect guac recipe! I actually grated the onion because hubby has an aversion to raw onion. Also, I used garlic powder and bottled lime juice...and it came out great! It would be even better with the real thing. Thanks, Bob!

I made this for a party where there were some very tough critics and EVERYBODY raved about it.  They practically licked the bowl clean -- there wasn't a drop left!  I did not use cilantro because I was out, but it didn't seem to make a difference.

Yum!  When choosing your avacados, be sure they are soft and ripe.  Be bold and add extra cilantro and garlic and don't skip out on adding the pinch of cayenne!

Not a bad dip, though if you add a packet of sazon with achiote, increase the garlic by 1/2 teaspoon, the cilantro by one tablespoon, AND...are you ready for this? Add a tablespoon of good teriaki sauce to the mixture before processing, will give it a zesty flavor that will not disappoint! =D

This was good, but we found it a bit bland.  Added another TBSP of lime, and a chopped jalapeno pepper for a bit more flavor.

This guac is fantastic!! I didn't change a thing, and it came out perfectly. I made it with lemon once, and it wasn't the same so I recommend using lime as the recipe calls for.

This has been my base guacamole recipe for years and I've made a few changes to my taste that have really turned this into a crowd favorite. I substitute red onion for white and only use 1/2 and for my secret ingredient I add cumin (less than a tsp) for a slightly smokey flavor and always add jalapeño with the seeds removed (usually 2 small or 1 large). The Roma tomato is key to this recipe in my opinion, as it is meatier and holds the flavor so much better. I always cover with Saran Wrap and let the flavor a meld in the fridge for at least two hours before serving, and to avoid any browning of the avacodo, make sure it is sealed tight with no air allowed between the guacamole and the plastic.

OMG!!! I tried this last night and chose this recipe due to the number of ratings and I was NOT disappointed.  I recently fell in love with guac and I've been buying Chipotle's and eating it alone or over their rice, chicken, salsa and beans bowl, and I figured I should probably start making my own.  It was extremely easy to make.  I adjusted the salt and the cayenne pepper.  I did not add as much salt as was called for (I need to watch my sodium intake) and I probably added a bit more than a pinch of cayenne pepper because it's great for weight loss.  P.S.  I use pink Himalayan rock salt which has a better flavor than traditional salt.  Additionally, although I did squeeze the juice of one lime into the bowl, I probably went easy on that too since I'm not a fan of too much lime.  I will be making this on a regular!

I'm a Texas gal who grew up eating what we call "Tex Mex". I've adapted my guacamole recipe over my span of 68 years and have watched how the favorite restaurants do guacamole table side. I can attest to the fact that this recipe is just about as authentic as it gets for good guacamole in Texas. I know different states offer their own influence (California, Arizona and the Cuban influence in Florida)" but in my humble opinion you HAVE to have onion, tomato, fresh lime juice and cilantro for it to be authentic guac. This recipe brings it all to the table. Yes, plan to buy your avocados a day or two in advance. They should be just slightly soft to the touch with no bruising. If you HAVE to buy hard ones, put them in a brown paper sack for a day or two and they will ripen beautifully. We prefer our guac a little more chunky, so we don't mash the heck out of it. However you like yours, chunky or smooth, this is a no fail recipe. You may need to adjust seasonings based on the size of the avocados. Enjoy!

Seriously, who knew Guacamole was this easy to make?!  I omitted the salt and in 15 minutes created the best Guacamole I've ever tasted!  I was worried about it turning brown but, after 3 days it's still a vibrant green; must be the Lime.  Great recipe, definitely will make over and over since it's MUCH more healthy than the cream cheese/mayo/sour cream dips.  Was a superb addition to Burritos!

I did 2 large avocados, doubled maybe even drowned it in the lime juice. One of the avocados was about to turn, despite popping the nib off the end of both the day before at the store (Kroger). It was bright green for three days, It was devoured the whole after two chicken taco dinners (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/easy-chicken-fajita-marinade) and one dinner of tilapia tacos, seasoned with paprika salt and pepper. Great recipe. The cayenne is a good addition if you don't put heat in another place. But, I love heat. Far superior to store bought "fresh" guacamole.

Wonderful! I cut down on the salt a tiny bit, added a little more cayenne pepper and a little jalapeno and it came out really spicy. I can dig it.

Classic recipe, can't go wrong with it. We like ours blended in the processor (well not with the tomatoes).

Delicious! Bringing it to a Mexican party tonight. I made a double batch and the ingredients cost me about $17.00 in fresh produce! (I had the cayenne pepper and garlic in the fridge) I have a feeling a got off the easiest cost wise for the party. Will definitely make it again soon!

5 stars for taste! Next time I will use a smaller lime or possibly half of a lime because the guacamole turned soupy after a day. Or maybe add another avocado. Fantastic, robust taste!

Not sure why but we just didn't care for this much. I mean it was edible, but not very good. We have had more success with 2 avocados and the packet of seasoning from the store. :(  Perhaps I did something wrong, but I don't think so. We probably will not be trying this one again.

Outstanding, authentic recipe. Followed it to the T. Cannot ask for a simpler more delicious recipe. The pinch of cumin, cayenne pepper  and the cilantro just Complete the flavors.

Great recipe! I added more garlic and lime juice. I forgot to add cilanto but it was still so delicious. The cilanto would have made it irresistable. Keeping this one around for good!

I have always made my guacamole that way but I also add green chili (chopped). A spoon full of sour cream. You could also add jalapeño.

My first time making guacamole. Used salsa instead of tomatoes/onions. Loved it and so do my co-workers!! Thank you for such an easy recipe. Guacamole isn't so intimidating anymore!

So simple to make. Using the food processor for a couple of pulses makes it smoother, but chunky is good too.

this was good but it needed more flavour.  I would add a bit more garlic and onions or use a bit less avocado.  maybe even some garlic powder.

Healthy and fresh tasting, this can’t be beat for a wonderful afternoon snack.  I used less salt than required and substituted green onions because I wanted to use them up but I’m sure it would be just good with regular onions.  Delicious!

The recipe is nice but...to make it perfect add 2 or 3 jalapenos instead of cayenne, a bit olive oil and one more option, which I like it very much, 2-3 tablespoons of green salsa. Enjoy it!

This was a great recipe I did find it to be a bit salty with a whole teaspoon of salt I'd cut it in half next time, I also added half a teaspoon of chilli powder and a half a teaspoon of garlic powder (since I didn't have garlic on hand) I also used lemon juice instead

This recipe was exactly what I needed. The guacamole came out delicious! I left out tomatoes, but did the rest as directed, I even added a pinch of cayenne pepper to the top for color and a little pop of flavor. Since the recipe doesn't specify onion type, I made it with red onions to give it the perfect zing. I won't waste money on guacamole packets again.

Awesome Guac! I add a fourth avocado and a touch more onion, red pepper, and salt. TIP: if the lime seems overpowering at first, a little salt will neutralize it. Soooooo good and easy! Perfect for a pool party!

Super recipe! And super ez!  Cut back on the salt a bit, traded the ground cayenne pepper for a few drops of Lousianna Hot Sauce, no fresh lime - so 1 TBS of lime juice, scrapped the cilantro (hate it) for parsley and dropped the garlic.  Family loved it.

This was my first attempt at guacamole.  I'm a fan, I've just never made it.  I thought 2 tomatoes was too much.  I wanted to taste more avocado, less tomato.  I'd definitely add more than a pinch of cayenne too.  Maybe two pinches.

OMG!!!!!!!!! The best Guacamole I ate in a long time! I had three very ripe avocados, and was looking to make something so they don't go to waste. Everything the recipe calls for we usually have at home anyways. Quick, easy, and super delicious. Everyone loved it! Thank you for sharing Bob Cody.

There is NEVER a pre-packaged container of store bought guacamole or mix to which you add avacados in my house after making this recipe.  It doesn't take long and the accolades from family and guests is amazing.  (Isn't that what every cook wants?) If I don't make this for every gathering I get stared down.  Made this during a multi-family vacation in Myrtle Beach.  It was gone in less than 5 minutes.  Made it the next day, doubled the recipe, and it didn't even make it to the fridge for the 1 hour.  I'd give it 6 stars.

This is delicious!  My only complaint is that it doesn't age well (in appearance, not taste), so if you're making it for company, don't make it too far ahead of time.

Hands down some of the best guacamole I've had... We had an avocado left over from making sushi the night before, so we simply adjusted the ingredients to one serving... Didn't have tomatoes on hand so used two heaping tablespoons of prepared chunky salsa instead.

I loved this recipe, although I thought it maybe had a little too much lime in it. But regardless, I'd still make it this way according to the recipe.

Since I started using this recipe, I'm forbidden from ever bring home store bought guac!  I lower the salt to 1/2 tsp. as another reviewer suggested - 1 tsp. was too much for us.   I use red onion and if I have a jalapeño, that's a happy addition to toss in.  Either buy avocadoes in advance, or find a grocery store with a good Spanish-Latino cooking section.  You won't be putting up with slimy cilantro or rock hard avocados.

I have made this at least 20 x's and always get rave reviews for this appetizer.  The only changes that have evolved for me in this recipe are dropping the tomatoes because they make the guac a little runny and substitute 1/4 t. cumin for the garlic.  Fantastic recipe!!

You can kick this recipe up a notch by adding a can of drained Rotel chunky tomatoes/chiles. Remember to drain the tomatoes and omit the last three ingredients (garlic, roma tomatoes and cayenne pepper). really good.

I made this as written with two exceptions: I put about 3/4 tsp ground cumin in it, and I used green onions instead of yellow or red. This batch had great flavor with lots of lime juice in it. My old recipe may be slightly better, as it has 4 T. salsa in place of the garlic and tomato of this recipe, but the salsa (freshly made) has more depth  of flavor (green pepper, jalapeno, onion, tomatoes, red wine vinegar, tomato paste, garlic). But I will use this recipe sometimes, because it is almost as good and easier to make than my old pair of recipes (salsa, guac). Thanks! BTW, I made this a second time using Vidalia onion in place of green onions, but it wasn't nearly as good. If you like green onions, they are a must!

This is an excellent guacamole recipe.  I made it exactly as stated and it turned out great.  I gave it 4 stars because I felt it was a little too salty.  I will half the salt next time and will definitely make it again.

For me; guacamole has always been a bland topping.  This recipe changed my opinion!  The stuff is awesome.  Very easy to make and very delicious!  I plan to use this in the “Seven Layer Tex Mex Dip” by Ginny.

Easy recipe and was a big hit! I've brought this to several parties and it always gets eaten! The key is to buy ripe avocados and add a lot of cilantro and lime juice. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this recipe in the midst of the devastating Hurricane Sandy Aftermath.  No power, and no where to go, I had a super blue family, but When I came out of the kitchen with a bowl full of chips and this homemade guacamole, boy did those Hurricane frowns turn upside down!!!  And wouldn't ya know it, the power came back on soon after we dug in.  Thank you Bob Cody for posting such an AWESOME guacamole recipe!!

I followed this recipe pretty closely.  I added a bit extra garlic and cilantro.  I also added some cumin to give it some more kick.  It was more tangy than I would have expected it to be.  I feel like I still would need to change it to meet my tastes.

Really good guacamole, authentic and flavorful!
A bit too much salt for my flavor, so I'd recommend only 1/2 tsp and maybe add to flavor.
Now I just have to figure out how to stop myself from eating it all up!

I have made guacamole for many years but this is, by far, the best recipe I have come across.  I only used about 1/4 teaspoon of salt and added a seeded, veined and chopped jalapeno in lieu of the cayenne pepper.

Awesome! I used a lemon since I didn't have a lime on hand. I used one yellow tomato rather than 2 plum tomatoes. Pulsed in my Pampered Chef food processor. The entire family devoured it!

This was my first attempt at guacamole and it was awesome!  Everyone raved and wanted the recipe.  I highly recommend giving it an hour for the flavors to mesh.  It tasted too salty to me at first but after an hour it was spot on!

Very delicious! Just make sure that when you make this recipe, you don't get fresh avocados. They tend to be a little hard, buy it a day or two in advance.

Yum!  Made exactly as written and it was tasty although a little more liquidy than we're used to.  Easy to assemble and stores well.

This is a fabulous recipe! It is so fresh and bursting with flavour. I added 1/2 a seeded jalapeno for more kick and my family enjoyed it very much. A tip to keep it from browing too quickly if you're making it a couple of hours ahead is to make sure that your plastic wrap sits directly on top of the guacamole so that no air can get to it all.

This was the BEST Guac I have ever tasted! I used more lime than the recipe called for, but my limes were a little dry. I blended everything except the tomato and half of the onion in the blender... then mixed in the remaining onion and tomatoes. SO GOOD!!!! I have shared this recipe with so many people.

I have made this several times exactly as written and my whole family loves it!  Actually, I have to double the recipe...and it makes alot!  This is good with the obvious tortilla chips, but also on Vegan Tacos!  Yummy!  I typically use iodized sea salt, but I did use Pink Himalayan Sea Salt once (I had a couple little samples) and I must say it was out of this world!  Instead of juicing a lime, I use 1T of Real Lime Juice to save some time.  A "pinch" of cayenne is 1/4 tsp, but you can always add more to your taste ~ I recommend starting with this amount.  This is a must try recipe!

I made this exactly to recipe except that I used dried cilantro instead of fresh (only because I forgot to pick some up at the store). Since I used dried cilantro I only put in 1.5 tablespoons which I think made the whole thing too salty. I will definitely make this again using fresh as I don't see any other reviews complaining about it being too salty. Quick to make, I like!

Amazing, amazing, amazing!! I'm a guacamole lover and a picky one too, so this recipe was perfect!! (though I did not squeeze in a half a lime because I bought a rather not-so-ripe lime) My whole family loved it too. Thanks for sharing!!

I'm sure it's a 5 star recipe using all the ingredients listed, but since I'm not a raw onion or raw garlic person, I just omitted the onion and added a few shakes of garlic powder. It was fantastic- My husband agreed that he didn't miss the onion....

I've been making guacamole with a very similar recipe for years with rave reviews! I make sure to remove the tomato insides...reduces liquid amount in mixture. Also, I use green onions. I find that taste is more to my liking. Finally, I use a guacamole seasoning mix. It really adds some flavor to the dip, but I'm sure enough salt would do the trick as well. Cilantro is really the secret to this guacamole!

Instead of the diced tomatoes, try medium hot salsa instead. I think it brings the flavor up a notch, especially if you like it with a little zip.

this is how i make my guac.  only i use tabasco sauce and a minced jalapeno.  you can also use lemon juice if you don't have lime.  the acid is what keeps the avocado green, not so much for the taste.

I scaled down the recipe a bit because I made it to top hamburgers, and not for a dip.  I followed the directions for the most part, but as I didn't have lime, I substituted lemon.  It's not quite the right flavour, but it gave the avocado a little kick.  Also, I didn't have fresh cilantro, so I used 1 Tbsp ground coriander instead (I figured it should have the same flavour).  If you're making this and it's runny, make sure you use plum tomatoes, as directed.  Other tomato varieties are too fleshy; however, you could scoop out the insides and just use the tomato shell if that's what you have in your fridge.  Personally, I like onions, so this was great for me...but if you find yellow onions to be too strong, try a couple of green onions, or just use less onion (and grate it to keep it small).

Good potential but I found this to be a little heavy on salt and lime.  This surprised me because I'm always adding more salt to my guacamole!  Need to tweak this one....  not any good 24hrs later :(

This was my first attempt at guacamole. I am a long time AllRecipes user, and have never written a review. I seem to only make the 5 star recipes, and am typically a little disappointed in the results. This was really a fantastic recipe. I stayed true to the directions and the results were awesome.

Brought this to a party with tortilla chips and it was the first thing gone! Sometimes I add garlic salt, finely diced jalapenos and/or cumin depending on my taste that day.

So delish!  Just like Guac should taste.  Next time I will leave the avocados more chunky because by the time you stir everything together, they mash down a lot.  I also added a pinch of cumin as suggested...  Awesome!  I only had yellow onion, but red would be ideal.  Thanks for this fabulous recipe!!

Ok, I usually hate guac, but this was FANTASTIC!  I never order it in restuarants becuase it tastes creamier...maybe they use sour cream.  This was sooo good, I ate almost all of it and didn't even eat dinner.  My hubby even liked it.  The tomatoes are so tasty in there add a nice fresh zing!  This is a keeper!!!!

Yummy!  I don't even like Guacamole and I loved this recipes.  It had a lot of flavor and not as bland and tasteless and I find most Guacamole. I don't mash the Avocados that much either.

You probably dont need another review to tell you how delicious this guac is!  We prefer red onion, 1/2 the salt, add cumin but leave out cayenne for the kiddos... so completely addictive!

This is by far the best Guacamole recipe ever. Me, my 6 and 9 year old make at least once a week. Fun making and even better to eat. Me, hubby and the kids eat it with some blue tortilla chips. To die for. Thanks so much for the recipe!

Wonderful! It was just salty enough for my liking, and the amount of cilantro in this recipe wasn't overpowering, like in some other ones I've tried. I will definitely be making this again.

The best guacamole recipe ever... I estimated the measurements, and added a bit more than a pinch of cayenne, but wow... I'm quite spoiled now! I don't think I will be able to have any other guacamole! The high rating is definitely well deserved!!!

This guacamole was great. As suggested in the comments I added some cumin, as well as mexican spice, crushed red pepper, and garlic salt. I also doubled up on the fresh garlic. A little corn also added to it nicely. Went great with some wholegrain tortilla chips and there was a little left for fajitas as well. Will definitely make again.

I have made this recipe many, many times.  I absolutely love it, but I have made some modifications to the recipe to suit my own taste.  I add about 2 tsp of finely minced onion instead of the 1/2 cup, and I add half of a tomato instead of 2 full tomatoes, plus I also skip the cayenne.  With these changes, the guacamole stays creamy and is very easy on the palate.  Love it!

Excellent overall, make sure to get ripe avocados, or make sure to get the avocados at least a week before making the guacamole!

Good, but any great guac recipe should have fresh diced jalapeno and cumin (1 tsp), so have to take a star off for that.  If you add these 2 ingredients, it's a 5 star guac.

Ok to start off with I want to say up front that I love this recipe as it is written, and I know some of you out there think you shouldn't rate something if you change it.  With that said in my opinion a recipe is a guideline to follow and you make changes to suit you individual taste and I have to say that this is the best guacamole recipe i have ever made.  Yes I did change a few things but again i made it to suit my family's taste and they absolutly loved it. The only changes I made was: cut the salt in half (also used seasoned salt instead) added 1 finely chopped jalepeno, doubled the garlic, used green onions (only because it was use them or lose them) and doubled the cilantro.  This is a great easy recipe that everyone will love!

I make this for almost every party I hold, and everyone always tells me its the best guacamole they've had!  I follow the recipe pretty closely, but add a bit more garlic and season with the lime juice, salt, and cayenne to taste.

I make this all the time and don't change a thing (and I do add the cayenne pepper)!  People rave about this when I make it for parties.  I need to remember to cut the recipe in half because when I make it at home (there are only 2 of us) it turns out to be a bit too much.

This was simple enough to make. I though about adding onion in might have added a bit more. Also you could be fine with half a lime. Was very good, I paired it with a nice zesty marinated chicken breast. Very quick and easy. :) Will make again. Way more authentic then the instant mix.

better after having sat in the fridge for a few hours...don't forget to leave an avocado pit in the guacamole to keep it from turning brown :)

This recipe is SUPERB.  I did not follow the measurements.  I wanted a colourful guacamole so I just added the ingredients and tasted as I went along.  The first time I made it, I added garlic.  I have skipped out garlic ever since because it just tastes better without it.  I also add in some paprika to up the flavour a little bit more. :)  Thank you so much for the recipe!

Crisp, clean, delicious - EVERYONE loves it, even people who don't eat the squishy green stuff.  I think the key may be in the lime, but really why try to figure it out?  Just make it, bring it and let everyone enjoy it!!!

I just made this.. with a little modification: I didn't put in any onions and tomatoes.. It turned out really yummy! I like it without all the chunks and my husband who still prefers to add the onion and tomatoes still agree this is the best tasting guacamole!

This is definitely a keeper for our family.  I had 4 avacados, so I squeezed in an extra lime (total of 2) and added 2 tsp. more minced garlic, based on another reviewers suggestions.  Just the right amount of lime and garlic!

So freaking yummy.  I put a pile of cilantro in, and skipped the cayenne, and did refrigerate for a couple hours.  This was my first try at guacamole... and I may end up making this every other day for the rest of my life lol

A little too much lime juice and a little too salty for my taste, but still good - and those things are a matter of preference and can be easily adjusted for next time!  I'll also add a chopped jalapeno next time!

I just made this and it is sooooo good. I'm eating it right now. I only put in 1 tablespoon of cilantro, since I'm not a huge fan, and I also added a little bit of olive oil to make it smoother. I would definitely recommend this recipe!

If I ever thought guacamole from a can was the real deal... well let's just say I was wrong. 

This is delicious x10, easy, and disappears from the bowl as soon as I set it on the table. 

Thanks!

Made this a dozen times by now-- it's always a hit at get togethers and one of my favorite afternoon snacks! I also follow suit and add more garlic and lime, but otherwise it's an awesome recipe-- thank you so much for sharing!

This was an amazing recipe. I honestly forgot to add the cayenne pepper but I did add a quarter of a jalapeno pepper. This is the first time I've ever reviewed a recipe. Thumbs up to the contributor. I couldn't stop eating right after I made this. Now all the flavors are marrying in the fridge, so I just know it's going to be even tastier. You have got to try this guac. It taste better than any one I've had in restaurants or the dry ingredients you find in packets at the market. This is now the only way I will make my guacamole..cudos

The lime completely overpowered the taste.
Please use 1/2 lime and add the other half incrementally- this approach would have saved my recipe from the trash. :)

The BEST guacamole recipe. We have made this over and over again and we always get so many compliments when we can be persuaded to share it with others instead of eating it all ourselves!

Absolutely DELICIOUS! It is a little oniony for my taste so perhaps next time I make it I will go little lighter on the onion- but it is still so good!

I was a little salty for my liking. I would suggest using a 1/2 teaspoon instead of 1 teaspoon to cut back on the saltiness but other than that it was great.

Great, simple guacamole recipe.  Leave the avacado chunky, and I prefer less onion.  Excellent!

I have made tons of guacamole in my life as a waitress in Mexican bistros, but I lost my touch. This recipe was just right! Of course I had to add jalapenos for that kick, but this was a nice, clean, fresh tasting guac.

I was glad I bought five avacados.  I needed all five because with only 3 the lime flavor is overwhelming.  It was just okay, it seemed like it was missing something.

Delicious! This is amazing. I used about 1/4 C.   homemade salsa in place of the tomatoes. I used half of the lime and think it would be better with less, but that's just my taste! So good; must try!

Excellent...only things I changed was ditch the cayenne in favor of 2 jalapenos seeded & finely chopped & chopped the lime peel & added that too.  Fantastic!

Instead of tomatoes and pepper I added a spicy tomato paste salsa. (World Table Creamy Salsa Dip) 

It turned out awesome. That salsa has a little bit of cream in it, so it give it that creamy texture that the users that suggested that you add a bit of sour cream to it. 

It was a hit with my picky husband. I'm about to roll it out at a party this afternoon if it don't eat it all myself first!

I followed this recipe exactly. I measured carefully. It was WAY to salty. I ended up adding corn and more tomatoes to help balance the salt. Still pretty salty. I made unsalted chips from corn tortillas and that helped a little. Good other than that!

THE best! The is honestly the only thing I put raw onions in (I like them cooked). This is wonderful with raw red onions, and also try it with raw shucked corn from the cob.  Yum yum yum! Note: do add the dash (or four) of cayenne pepper - great with it!

Loved the taste but I found the tomato , which I seeded , left it with a slimey texture. I may make it again omitting the tomatos.

I am very new to cooking and I have NEVER made guacamole before.  I literally had to google how to cut an avocado, that's how inexperienced I am!!  I made this over the weekend for my boyfriend and it was DELICIOUS!!  He said it was the best guacamole he's EVER had, and he wasn't just being nice.  I totally agree!! Delicious and easy.  I also added a few jalapenos! Thank you for the recipe!

DO NOT USE ANYTHING BUT FRESH INGREDIENTS!!! Five stars!!

Take it from me - a lifelong guac maker - one way to make this recipe a 3-4 star recipe, use garlic and onion powder. :(

Caution! Add the lime to taste. I juiced the lime and added extra because I was using 4 1/2 avocados. Well, 1 1/2 juicy limes was way too much! I may have to toss this out. Still the recipe, if not for my error, has the potential for being really good.

Wow...this is great. I've never made my own guacamole before and was a little intimidated but this was so simple and quick and absolutely fantastic! I left out the cayenne pepper (because I forgot about it!) but wouldn't change a thing!

My fiancee and our best man raved that this was, "restaurant worthy, if not better!"     I took a lot of tips from previous reviewers and this is what I came up with: 2 mashed avocados, 1 cut into tiny cubes, add 1/4-1/2 tsp cumin, leave out the seeds of the tomatoes, extra garlic and onions, leave the pits of the avacadoes in the guac and instead of mixing in the lime juice, just layer it over the top of the guac til ready to serve, then stir well. LOVE IT!!

Amazingggg!!!!! I love guacamole and I could eat it everyday! I have never tried to make it myself because I hate chopping onions and tomatoes. Well we had a little get together so I decided to go ahead and try this out. OMG let me tell you I will be making this again and again! Everyone loved it and voted that I am now the official guacomole maker. lol! I didn't follow this recipe exactly but I did use all the same ingredients. I changed it up based on personal preference, like less onion and more salt. I also added cumin as others suggested and will definitely add it again next time I make this. Yummy!

SO tasty. Followed exactly, but added a pinch of cumin and used shallots - only because I had them handy in the fridge. I am new to cooking and this was the EASIEST recipe to follow. Friends raved about this for days! Will definitely make again in the very near future :)

This was insanely good.  I used small hass avocados for this, lessened the salt a bit, and omitted the pepper.  Definitely use a fresh lime and fresh garlic-- this makes all the difference.  Anyway, I intended to eat some of this on a good bread with a friend as a snack, but we ended up making the bread + guac a full lunch.  We literally couldn't stop eating the guac because it tasted so good, and ended up finishing a whole loaf of bread, not because we were hungry, but because we didn't want to stop eating the guac!  This is definitely a dangerous recipe if you're on a diet.

Awesome guacamole! I added a LOT more cayenne - kept tasting and adding until it was  good, but I would think I added about 1 1/2 tablespoons in the end. Will try jalopenos next time.

Very good. I made it in the mixer and did not use the garlic. Instead I used  garlic salt. I made about a tub full and it was gone within the night I made it. I am most definately using this recipe again!

Excellent recipe - YUM!  Good thing my hubby doesn't like guac because once I start eating this I can't stop!  I did make some adjustments and increased the garlic, added in some cumin for additional flavor, and also added in some chopped mild green chiles and jalepeno.

Made this tonight for taco night and two people commented that it was the best guacamole they have had and one said that I would have to make it again sometime. It was definitely a hit and very easy to make! Highly recommend. Don't need to change anything from the recipe!

This is not the first time I made guacamole, however, it is the first time that I have used cayenne pepper in my guacamole, and boy was it good!  I don't recall how much cilantro I used, but I always use lots of fresh cilantro and just keep tasting until I reach that desired taste.  Super yummy---great refreshing summer snack---will be using this recipe again....thanks Bob!

There are three things that need to be changed in this recipe to make it truly mexican: 1. Get rid of the cayenne 2. Throw in some chiles serranos depending on how hot you like it (1 to 3) 3. Add a tablespoon mayo

I have never heard my husband say so many times that he loved something I made from scratch.  This recipe is phenomenal, and the only change I made was a little sprinkle of cumin and a few dashes of cholula hot sauce instead of the cayenne pepper.

Excellent!  My whole family loves this Guacamole.  I followed the instructions except for adding a little olive oil to smooth it out and fresh ground sea salt and black pepper to taste.  This tastes awesome with Meijer brand lime tortilla chips.

This was my first attempt at making guacamole and I was so pleased with the finished product. As a beginner-level cook, I found that this recipe was easy, delicious and super fresh. It reminded me of the guacamole my husband and I have while vacationing in Mexico. Yum!!

I made this recipe to go with fajitas, beans and spanish rice. This is my first time to do guacamole and I actually do not like avocados, so I made it (following the recipe, put much less onion in it, and couldn't find cayenne pepper) without ever tasting it.   My husband who is at home with everything Mexican and Tex-Mex, said that it was really good. I asked him for future references, if there was anything he would change about it, and he said NO!!!    So, it must be good. I will keep the recipe and do it again!

This is the best guac that I ever tasted.  I left out the tomatoes because I like it better that way.  The cilantro gave ot a very fresh flavor.  They were fighting over the last scoop!

Great guacamole!  Since not everyone likes cilantro, I usually separate into 2 bowls and only use cilantro in one.  Make sure you mince the garlic FINE and store in an airtight container so it doesn't turn brown.  I usually wrap it in plastic wrap and then put it in tupperware, seems to help.

This was absolutely delicious.  I have never prepared guacamole before and had no idea how easy it is to make.  The flavors come together so nicely.  I can’t wait to make this again.

I omitted the cilantro because I didn't have any on hand, and used 1/2 tsp of kosher salt and this was SUPER DELISH!! We didn't even refrigerate before gobbling up the whole thing.

The is the best tasting guac I've ever made. I get rave reviews special requests from friends to make this for their parties and poker nights. I have to admit, I am not a fan of cilantro, so I don't use it. I make the recipe as listed but omit the cilantro and there have been no complaints. I would imagine if you're a cilantro lover... you'd have no complaints. This stuff makes my mouth water...

We doubled this recipe and found that it was too heavy on the limes. Next time I will use 1 or 1.5 limes instead of 2 limes. Other than that though, this was quite tasty.

Awesome recipe! I love the original, but I usually tweak it to my taste a bit... I buy this fire-roasted salsa from costco, so I usually add a few heaping spoonfulls to add a little flare to the guacamole. I also add way more lime juice ( just from a bottle ) as I like more tang. I have this chili lime seasoning that I bought in Mexico which I also add. Yumm Yumm Yumm!

Very good.  My son who is the guacamole fan in the whole bunch didn't really care for it.  But other than him, people seemed rather happy with it.  My biggest issue was balancing the flavors.  I used three avocados...but with the whole lime it was way too "limey" So I ended up adding a little bit more of everything including another avocado (but salt) and after sitting for about an hour in the frige, I think it turned out okay.  DH will be home tonight to give it the finally thumbs up or down!

Look no further.  This recipe is fantastic and we've tried a lot of them!  After it was mixed it up, I thought it tasted a bit bland but after it set an hour, it was beyond perfect!  Liked the idea one reviewer suggested of adding salsa.  Didn't try that but may next time, just to experiment.

OMG this was such a perfect guac recipe.  Enjoyed it so much...I used 2 large Florida avacados...(there are 2 kinds).  So yummy!  Thanks!
UPDATE:  I decided to make this for Easter this year...and I can't wait to have it later, so I'm eating some for breakfast with white corn tortilla chips!  Haha...I did add a total of 2 pinches of cayenne (red pepper), and 1 pinch of cumin to the mixture this time!  Unbelievable!!  I also used 4 organic avacados, but not the Fl ones, like I previously used, the smaller ones.  So yummy!!  What a great recipe!

Wow, it was awesome to see something close to my recipe that made real guacamole-chunky like it should be.  I do up the tomatoes to 3 and use a red onion, plus instead of cayenne, I use hot sauce and add in onion powder and garlic powder & salt & pepper to taste. Also, one big main ingredient missing is cilantro.  I chop a couple handuls and toss it in - really adds an extra zing! My uncle is from Mexico and he helped me perfect my recipe and this is almost exact - yum - great recipe!

This was by far the best guacamole I've ever had, let alone made.  I followed the recipe exactly, but instead of the cayenne added 1 seeded and diced jalapeno for heat.  Also, only used 1 tomato b/c we like more avacado.  This stayed fresh in the fridge for 2 days in an airtight container-keep the pit in the container when storing and it lasts longer.

Did NOT care for all the cilantro! OMG! It would have been a 5 star rating if I hadn't put that in there!

Made it again a couple of weeks ago and took it easy on the cilantro this time. It was great!

This was so tasty!  I could only find one good avocado at Walmart, so I got the packaged guac and mashed it in (I left it chunky).  I didn't change anything with this recipe and it was perfect. I bet it would have been even better had I had 2 other fresh avocados instead of the packaged, but it is what it is. Fresh cilantro a must and I recommend letting it sit for at least an hour in the fridge to let the flavors blend. Its worth it!

This is a good one ! I have made the same recipe for years since living in Texas and its always a big hit . I do add more cilantro . Lime is good too , I think it makes it better than lemon juice . :)

This guacamole is fabulous! It disappeared minutes after it hit the serving table! Everyone loved it. The fresh cilantro is the ingredient that really makes it! Try it. You wont' be disappointed

I've made this numerous times now, both as written and with some modifications. It always turns out perfectly! When I have time, I'd make the recipe as written along with some frozen corn and a dash of chili powder if I am in the mood for it. When I'm short on time, however, I make a more basic version, using just avocados, onions, corn and S&P. I always, always use purple onions.

This is a great recipe; I followed it exactly and it was great.  I worked at a Mexican restaurant for many years, and no other guacamole ever came close to that, but this one does!  My husband was impressed as well.  I may make this for a Superbowl appetizer, thank you!

I eat this as a dip and as a topping for fish tacos. Sometimes I add Tony's Chachere's seasoning in place of the salt & cayenne.

This is the first time that Ive written a review but I had to set up an account just so I could do that. This is the best guacamole that Ive ever had and Ive made it so many times now Ive memorized the recipe! Everyone who tries it loves it and even though I double the recipe everytime I make it, its gobbled up. I hate it when reviewers change everything and then leave a review, the only thing that I did different is add more garlic and a dash more salt...personal taste. This is perfect the way it is!!!

This was pretty good. I thought it was a little too salty, but my guests liked it. I added a little cumin at a reviewer's suggestion.

Wow!  Soooooo good.  I think I will be making a lot of guacamole from now on!  I followed the recipe almost exactly - one of my avocados was bad :( so I only used 2, and my lime was a little hard so I probably only got about half the juice of a regular lime; but I thought it was just about perfect - from now on I will use 3 avocados and the juice of half a lime.  Thanks so much!

Love, luv this recipe. Great on sandwiches, burgers, omlettes, off to the side to cool down chile w/ chips. Or add hottness w/ the mild, lime flavored hot sauce along w/ the lime juice for variation.

Easy and delicious.  Made a large batch for a family gathering and expected to have a lot leftover, but they ate it all!  I actually did the right thing and used fresh cilantro and it made all the difference.  A keeper.

An amazingly simple recipe with great results.  I didn't have fresh tomatoes, so I used four tablespoons of chopped canned tomatoes.  When summer comes, I will be using fresh ones from my garden! I also didn't use cilantro.  I don't like cilantro, but in this recipe, I would probably eat it since the base recipe is so well balanced. I will use this as my standard guacamole from now on.  Thank you!

to prevent turning brown just place the avocado pit in bowl until ready to serve - works every time . also if avocados are hard & green just place in dark place (like a drawer) for a few days & they will be perfect for use in guacamole

Not that this recipe needs another review but I have made it so many times now, it seemed only right to rate it.  Everyone I have made this for loves it too!  I love the proportions as they are, though I sometimes add a bit more garlic.  My son loves this guacamole without the cilantro - he`s not a fan so if you aren`t either you can omit it and still have great guacamole.  Personally I think the cilantro adds excellent flavor.  Don`t be afraid to use a little cayenne if you`re not sure; that`s what I did the first time and it added just a little kick.  No other guacamole recipes that I`ve tried are as good as this one.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!!

This is the best guacamole I have ever had.  I  used Rotel cilantro and lime.  To keep it fresh in the fridge, I kept one avocado seed in the mixture.  I don't know why but it helps it maintain the bright green color.  Also, to stay heart healthy and carb-free, take a chicken breast dry seasoned with Mrs. Dash fiesta lime and grill it, then top this guacamole on top.  Delicious!

ABSOLUTELY the best guac in the world.  I'm astounded every time I make it.  Made it for a fourth of july party and it was gone in 4 minutes- and that was a triple batch!   Everyone tells me its the best guac they've ever tried.  I add about 3 pinches of cayenne pepper and extra garlic, but other than that I follow the recipe to a t!

Spectacular. I've only eaten guacamole a few times with some chips and crackers (store-bought), but I was stealing spoon after spoon after I was preparing this recipe for carnitas. I didn't try it the first time I made it (about 2 weeks ago), but my family loved it. My mom even wanted a whole quantity for herself! Thanks for this recipe, it's wonderful.

A great recipe although i did think there was too much salt and not enough lime, i had to add the juice of 3 imes to counteract the saltiness.   I used red onions and cherry tomatoes.  A bit of tweaking makes this a five :D

This recipe is almost identical to the one I've been making for years. The reason I'm only giving it 3 stars is because it is missing one of the most important ingredients... JALAPENO!!! Oh my goodness. It's so ridiculous that this recipe has such great reviews despite the fact that it's missing something so critical. I think the cayenne is unnecessary and minced jalapeno be substituted in its place. Just a small amount is needed for taste, and for those of us who love hot, hot, hot, at least one full jalapeno should be added. Additionally, the recipe should specify that it is sweet red onion that should be used. Hope this helps.

This recipe is great.  I used red onion and forgot the cilantro.  It still turned out pretty good.  Although, I'm not sure if a full tsp of salt is necessary.  I will make this again in the very near future.  UPDATE: A 1/2 tsp of salt is all that is needed, grating the onion and 2 cloves makes this the perfect dip!

This guac tastes exactly like what we got in Mazatlan last summer.  My husband scarfs it down every time.  Even my three-year old begs for more!  Fresh cilantro and lime are musts.  Absolutely spectacular.

Simple recipe, absolutely awesome!  I didn't have dry cayenne so I added a couple shots of Tobassco sauce. No fresh cilantro so I used dry.  We served it with a dollop of sour cream.  Yum!

AWESOME!! This is the best guacamole I ever had in my life. Better than the best restaurants. This is so good and fresh tasting, it makes the whole Mexican meal so much better. Would highly recommend this. Do try it just the way it is recommended. You will love it!!  Thanks for sharing!!

I have to say that this was my first attempt at making guacamole.  Not sure why I haven't made it before. I guess I thought it would be difficult.  I've had guacamole made by lots of different people and at many places around the country, including the southwest, but this recipe was phenominal.  The only real changes I made was to eliminate the salt (not a big salt fan), increased the garlic (mmmm!) and added a jalapeno from my garden. Thanks for making this one of my new favorites!

Great and easy guacamole recipe.  I used a key lime instead of a whole lime because I think it's a little over powering to add that much lime juice.  My family and I love this recipe!  Thanks so much.

I'm a native Arizonan who has eaten her fair share of guacamole, and lemma tell ya...this stuff is fantastic!  I put more cayenne and a finely diced jalepeno in mine because we like things hot and spicy around here, but otherwise...didn't change a thing!  This stuff didn't have a chance at our "Fiesta Friday" dinner - it was gone fast!  Muy delicioso!!

I was a little disappointed with this recipe.  I thought it lacked flavor.  I did not rate this any lower because I had to use lime juice from a bottle cause I did not have a lime on hand.  Next time I will use a real lime, add more garlic and add cumin per other reviewers.

Very good and very easy... I've used this recipe several times. I like to cube one of the avocados and fold it in after I've thoroughly mixed all the other ingredients, the result is both smooth and chunky. Sometimes, I'll sautee the onion first so it's not so bitey... makes the dish that much more special.

Too bland. We added cayenne pepper, chili powder, red pepper flakes, more lime juice, and some seasoned salt and it still tasted like I was eating an avocado.

This is so good and so easy to make. Try not to make it too early in advance because it turns brown within 2 hours sitting in room temperature. Store in the fridge with a tight seal helps to slow it down from turning brown a little bit. My friend suggested to keep the avocado pits in the guacamole might keep it from turning brown quickly. Will definitely make this again and again....

Best homemade quacamole I've ever made. Left out the cayenne pepper and minced garlic (actaully forgot to put the garlic in) but added a little cumin and garlic powder for some added flavor. Let it sit in fridge for about a half hour for flavors to meld and that was just fine. Also note that by leaving the avocado seeds in quac will keep it fresher and from turning brown...I left 2 seeds in there as well as made sure plenty of lime juice.

This was sooo great! I know this is bad but, I didn't have fresh tomatoes and used 2/3 can of diced tom. with green chiles....It really was delicious....Sometimes you just have to cheat :-) (I did chop them up a little 'cause they weren't the petite dice)

I doubled this recipe, and added about a half tablespoon or so of cumin, and flew out of the bowl.  I barely got any and now everyone wants me to bring guacamole for this summer's parties.  Thanks for the recipe!

First time making guacamole, and what a success! For me, this is way more than 4 servings. Maybe my avocados were bigger. I'll be making this regularly.

This is really yummy. I recently had a glut of avocados and this is what I turned them into. Added more cumin and coriander because I like them. Good recipe as it is.

Absolutely delicious! The only thing I do is double the lime juice for personal preference!

My 1-yr-old loves guacamole so I wanted to find a recipe to make it on a regular basis. This was my first attempt at Guacamole and it was delicious. I used the food processor to combine the ingredients. I like mine slightly chunky and it turned out perfect.

Easy and delicious recipe.  I've made this recipe 3 times already and everyone loves it.  Here are some of my deviations: I am not a big onion fan, so I only use 1/4 to 1/3 cup of onions; if you want more heat, use 3-4 pinches of cayenne pepper; and if you don't have fresh cilantro, use 3 teaspoons of dried cilantro.  I also don't use any salt since I normally eat it with tortilla chips which are almost always salted already.

This guacamole was so good, my family ate it up in minutes.  I bought a netted bag with 5 small avocados and used them all. They were black and soft and when I peeled them they were already turning a bit brown, but they were easy to mash (I used a potato masher), and tasted great.  It is hard judging which avocados to buy, but the riper the better. I used the 1/2 cup of onion and didn't find it overpowering at all. I also added an extra tspn of minced garlic, and chopped up a jalepeno pepper(did not make it hot at all), and only used 1/2 squeezed lime(a whole lime would have been too overpowering.  My one daughter does not like cilantro, so I divided the guac in 1/2 before adding the cilantro (only used 1 tspn of cilantro, since it was divided) and both bowls were eaten up. I made this about 3 hours ahead of time, and while it tasted very good when I served it, it did taste better, I thought right away after I made it. Refrigerating it, it lost some of the taste I found.  Great easy recipe, will definitely make again.

This recipe is pretty much identical to one I have been making for 29 years. Shown to me by an old amigo from Mexico City, it is authentic and delicious. You wont need to change a thing unless you want fresh jalapenos instead of the powder.

This is a WONDERFUL recipe. I LOVED it. I have read all the reviews and I have noticed that no one said anything about how to get the pit out...I cut my avocado in two, then I take my sharp knife and hit it into the pit and turn sideways and out pops the pit. Then instead of peeling the avocado, I simply spoon it into my bowl. (or) invert the peel and the (ripe) avocado can pop into the bowl too. As to the recipe...I wouldn't change a thing, other than to say, I always put the pits in the bowl when all is mixed up. The lime juice & the pits  keep it from turning brown. Works every time also, ALWAYS put leftovers in an air tight container IF, that is, you have any left. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!!!

Excellent version of this wonderful treat! This is just like I make only I use tomatillos instead of roma tomatoes. I also add a little fresh jalapeno for heat. Oh no, please, never the powdered dead stuff! Fresh is always best, I recommend organic and local!

I usually make guac by mixing avocado with store bought salsa, but omg, I'll NEVER do that again after having tried this recipe. Everything is in perfect, delicious proportion. Substitute organic ingredients and My oh my, I could eat a whole bowl of this alone!

I have been making an almost identical version of this for years and it is always a hit! the only differences I would suggest are a few jalepenos for kick instead of cayanne, and some cumin. delicious!

Phenomenal! Only tweaks I made for our personal taste were: more lime juice because we like the zing, white pepper, and ground cumin. We live in Hawaii so Avocados are plentiful and will be making this guacamole frequently! Thanks so much for the wonderful recipe!

This tastes exceptionally fresh!  One of my favorite recipes when I can get fresh produce from the farmer's market.  I use extra cilantro, just because I love that lime taste.  It also freezes well for a few weeks.

This is a keeper for the best guacamole ever.I made a batch 6 months ago and I should have rated it at that time with 5+ stars.  I lost my recipe and had trouble fing it again here.  Today my search brought me back & I see the 5 star ratings/reviews almost doubled in those six months. Make this, everyone!  No alterations needed.

To prevent the avocadoes from browning, peel them and put them into some water with ice in it. Let them sit in there while you chop your cilantro, tomatoes and onions and whatever else you add. Drain off the water and then mash them. This keeps them nice and green for a long time. If you have leftovers try storing in an airtight container and at the most there is a thin dark green layer which you can scrape off if it bothers you. I don't remember where I learned this but I know it works.

I must say, this took a lot of work! However, it was definitely worth it. I find it not necessary to make any alterations on this recipe. If you like chunky guacamole, this is the perfect recipe for you. The combination of spices was pleasant to the tongue, unless you don't like a little kick. Don't try to make too much if you don't plan on eating it within a week. But overall, I thought this was absolutely delicious and is worth to make if you have a large amount of free time.

I make this guacamole frequently, and it is always quickly devoured. I toss all of the ingredients into my stand mixer and blend until desired chunkiness. I use ½ t of salt and usually omit the cilantro simply because I don’t want to waste the unused portion. I tried the cilantro in a tube once, but I didn’t care for it. Sometimes I add a jalepeno.

The best guacamole I've ever had! These are the minor adjustments I made: I use 2 limes, red onions, 4 tbsp of cilantro, 3 tsp of garlic, and cayenne and cumin, about 1/2 a tsp each. Otherwise I followed the recipe. Good even the next day.

Holy cow, this is outstanding.  I made it for every camping trip this summer and it was ALWAYS gone!  Along side some beer margaritas from this site, and that's all you need for an afternoon of fun and relaxation!

Yum!  This is truly the best guac I have ever made.  My boyfriend HATES guacamole, but he LOVES this recipe.  He actually suggests it now as something for us to bring to family get togethers!  I like to add lots of extra cayenne.  It's so good for you and gives it a really great kick.  A perfect anytime snack.

This was great.  I chopped everything the night before and then smashed up the avacado right beforehand so that it wouldn't turn brown.  The guacamole was actually better the next day.  Had great flavor.

Great recipe!  Made some changes though.  Used a can of diced tomatoes in cilantro and lime juice rather than cutting up tomatoes and cilantro.  Tasted great.  Everyone loved it!

Fantastic recipe!

After trying this many times, I liked it best with 1/3 cup onion and 1 tbsp of garlic.  I don't like cilantro so I dropped it.  Cayenne to taste and salt until the avocado flavor stands out nicely.

Buy the avos at the point where they give a little with a squeeze.  Then ripen them in a paper bag with apples for 12-16 hours and they'll be perfect.

Amazing recipe!

This is the BEST guacamole I have ever had!  Better than any Mexican restaurant I've been to.  I make this as is, but I use a red onion and a little extra minced garlic.  AMAZING!

Followed the recipe exactly, except omitted the lime juice because I was serving it immediately. This guacamole was absolutely delicious. I used to buy the seasoning packet in the produce dept, but will always make this recipe from now on. I loved the fresh garlic and will add a little extra next time. Everyone raved about it at my party and practically licked the bowl clean.

Sensational! I always wanted to make my own Guacamole, for the purpose of fresh taste, and I was never a great Dip maker. Well, Made this one tonight for a party of 6 and it was a HUGE HIT! Thanks so much!

This guacamole was really good. I just guessed on all of the amounts because I only had 2 avocados. You definitely need to let it sit for an hour... the flavors really blend better then. I tried it right after it was made and everything tasted a little too strong... but letting it sit really mellows it out and then it was perfect.

This is a great recipe! Although it probably would be better if you use a real lime, I used lime juice from a bottle, and if you do use it from a bottle, only use about 1/8 cup.
This tastes great, and it makes a real big bowl of it, not like the 4 servings it says.

Magnificent recipe!!! :) The blend of onion and garlic with the avacado flavor is so amazing! I made a packet guacamole one time before this... never again! It was a complete waste of an avacado! I'm adding this to my repetoire of recipes... love it! Thanks so much!

Excellent. Used in layered tortilla dip and served to Parisians (this is not something they see) and they cleaned the platter.

This is excellent. Since cilantro seems to be the love/hate herb for people, I made it without and added a little at a time until it was what I knew my family would like. Also only used the juice of 1/2 lime at first, then added more as needed.

I normally modify recipes quite a bit, but this one was very good as written. Thanks!

However, I like things spicy, so I added a fresh jalapeno, and it kicked up the flavor much more to my liking. I also strongly recommend growing or buying fresh, local tomatoes, cilantro, onions, and avocados as it REALLY makes a difference in the flavor. Yum!

I love good guacamole but have yet to find a recipe that is as good as that in a couple of my favorite restaurants. When I saw all the positive reviews for this recipe I decided to try it. My husband and I found it just "okay" for us. It may be just a matter of preference but for us  the cilantro was too overpowering. It was all we could taste. I made the recipe exactly as stated.

Absolutely, HANDS DOWN, the BEST gucamole recipe EVER. I actually learned this recipe from a few waiter friends I knew that worked at this AMAZING Mexican joint. The key, and I seriously mean this, is good avocados. This is ALL ABOUT the avocados. Don't bother to use this recipe if you don't have good, creamy, ripe ones. It will turn out chalky and unpleasant. If your avocados aren't ripe yet, stick them in newspaper with a banana in a cupboard for a few days. If you insist on using bad avocados I would suggest adding some sour cream and a couple of teaspoons of olive oil and they should improve the taste.

Perfect!  Many good Mexican restaurants now do this tableside.  You can get a mortar bowl at Crate and Barrel, and mix and serve in same bowl, and it looks very impressive.

So easy and very delicious. I followed the recipe except for not adding the cilantro. My husband usually hates guacamole, but loved this.

This guacamole was great. I love the cilantro in it, except I did use a little less. I have family that think they don't like it, but couldn't tell it was in there when I served it. The lime is the hidden great ingredient.

very good!!!  I have always had a hard time making guacoamole and this is a perfect recipe!!  Instead of tomatoes, I just added a can of the hunts diced tomatoes with jalapenos.  Just make sure you drain the can really well so the guacamole doesn't get to waterly.

The flavor is good, but a little bland.  Great "Americanized" guacamole.  We added tons more garlic and cayenne pepper and it was still lacking the spice we wanted.  I'll make it again, but next time add some chopped up jalapenos and cut down the lime juice as well.

I don't eat guacamole (can't stand avocados), but made this for my hubby.  He didn't like the tomato and said it needed more salt, but was otherwise a decent recipe.  Good, but not great.

I made this for my daughter's pre-prom party.  80 people showed up.  I almost forgot to take it out of the fridge and everyone was there an hour with all of the other appetizers.  Then I remembered.  Wow.  The comments were one thing but I had to replenish it twice and used every last bit of it.  I personally LOVED it.  The best guac I've ever had.  I made it exactly as described and left the pit in the bowl in the fridge until I served it to keep it from going brown and it totally worked.

This is the best guacamole I've ever had.  Beats any restaurant's!!  I only made one change and that was I used a teaspoon of garlic powder instead of minced garlic.  It turned out great!  My boyfriend, who doesn't like guacamole, ate this up like CRAZY!!

WOW! The first time I made this recipe, it came out so disappointing, I figured I'd just buy the store bought seasoning forever. I decided to try it again since I was craving avocado. It's amazing! I used 2 large avocados, no cilantro, 1 minced jalapeno, the juice of 1/2 a lime, 1-2 large pinches of cumin, and used a can of drained, diced tomatoes instead of roma. The rest of the recipe I kept the same. So amazing, I'm so glad I tried it again! Tweak this recipe to your liking and you can't go wrong. **Update: I've also used 1 avocado and 3/4 can pureed white beans and it makes a yummy lighter version. Both versions are great depending on what you're looking for. Season to taste!

This got great reviews at a small get together.  Followed recipe exactly.  I tasted it immediately after preparing and then refrigerated for several hours before serving.  It was much better after refrigeration.

Good recipe. I like my guacamole kind of chunky so I used half the tomato. I only had juice in plastic squeeze bottle in the fridge but like the idea of fresh squeazed. Also I put a blob of sour cream on top and a sprinkle of sliced black olives and a sprinkle of shredded cheddar cheese on top but the actual guacamole recipe is perfect. Thanks!

Good guacamole with a real taste of Mexico in it. I will definetly do this again. 

In my flavor little bit too much onion and too less chili. I added about twice the amount of cayanne pepper to make it little bit more spicy and added an extra avocado after first tasting.

Delicious! I used one more roma tomato than advised, and red onion.  I also added a little bit of salt and fresh ground pepper.  The cayenne pepper really gave it a kick! It was a huge hit at my husband's poker night! Thanks for the great recipe!

I thought this was terrific!   I used lemon juice instead of lime to save myself a trip to the store and it still tasted great.  I would scale back on the salt though and slowly add to taste.

I liked this but my family did not.  They thought the cilantro over powered the avocado taste.  It was additional work to chop the cilantro so I will go back to an easier recipe since my family did not appreciate the extra trouble.

We don't like guacamole but I've had to make this over 5 times THIS WEEK b/c it's SO good! My husband and his friends WON'T stop eating it! I think the difference is no cilantro. Also, i've been using petite diced canned tomatoes instead of fresh and no one's noticed yet! Better when chilled for sure! Cannot go wrong with this one! This made me LOVE quacamole!

This is very similar to my own guacamole recipe, except that instead of using the cayenne pepper I seed and dice 1 or two jalapeno peppers - gives it a little zing.  

I've also used ground chipotle pepper if you like a bit of a smoky flavor.

This recipe is perfect. Not only did I love it, but our 5-year-old was running around the kitchen clapping and singing, he liked it that much! Plus our picky eating 9 year old daughter even ate it! Great recipe, a real keeper!!!

this was spot-on FANTASTIC. a little labor intensive w/all the chopping involved, but worth it in the end. we made this for a super bowl party this year, and the entire bowl was gone by the end of the game! [one batch kept 6 people very happy the whole game!]

I wanted this to work so badly, and I followed the recipe to the t. There was way to much onion, it's all I could taste. Maybe it was a really strong onion, but I had to sit there for half an hour picking out onion pieces so that it would be edible. If it weren't for the onion though I'm sure it would have been supurb.

This made a wonderful guacamole!  I cut back on the cilantro a little because my husband doesn't like it and used a tiny bit of cayenne.  Next time I will use more of the cayenne to spice it up a little but otherwise will not make any other changes.  Fabulous!!

I don't eat avacodo, however my husband loves this and I will be making it over and over for him, followed directions exactly.  I did have some left-over so I added some fruit fresh to it so it won't turn brown.  I also left the pit in the container.

Ok, so I had to come back and review this recipe.  I've been making this Guacamole for the past couple years and wow, it's a winner.  I follow the directions exactly.  It gets rave reviews from all that partake of it.  Thanks for sharing!

This was good, but not as great as I was expecting it to be. I must've had a large lime because the lime juice flavor was extremely overpowering. It was somewhat of a disappointment as I was bringing this to a party and couldn't seem to correct the problem. I tried adding some hot sauce to cut back on the lime flavor but it didn't work out very well. What I really needed, but did not have, was another avocado that I could have mashed up and blended in. So... just heed this warning: Be aware of the size of the lime you're using for this dish so you don't ruin what would have otherwise been some really good guacamole!

delicious! be sure to use ripe avocados (purplish- black and slightly soft), just slice and twist it in half to pit, and scoop out the flesh. i dump everything into the blender and pulse until i get the consistency i want. great with tortilla chips or bread.

This recipe should be re-named "BEST Guacamole EVER!" haha, everyone, including myself, ate it up fast. It was gone in seconds and mm it was so good. I think next time I'll add a little more cayenne pepper for even more of a spice. MMM SO yummy. My mother wants me to make it again for Christmas! I'm looking forward to it :)

xoxo

Awesome recipe!!! I served it at a party and it was a huge hit!!  I had 8 people, so I doubled the recipe, which I am very glad I did as every last bite was gone.  I did use red onion which I think really enhanced the flavor.

Very good! A spur-of-the-moment inspiration led me to add little honey (especially since I was making slightly spicy chips to go with it), and it definitely improved the guac to have the hint of sweetness.  I had this, a storebought bottle of salsa, and a tub of storebought sour cream with homemade chips when I had some friends over for dinner.  The salsa was untouched, and I got constant comments that the sour cream and guac went very well together.  A definite success!

After the first batch we cut the salt in half, otherwise it is perfect. Also, we used bottled lime juice. The bottle suggests 2-3 tablespoons to equal one lime. We found that 2 tablespoons was just right for our tastes.

I've made this twice and always get complements on it.  The first time was very oniony tasting, so I reduced that and it was perfect.  I especially like the cayenne pepper flavoring.  Really boosts the taste.

I'd never made guac before, and I was a bit nervous (I served it for a dinner party).  But, it was awesome!  Great recipe!  Will make again.

Totally worth trying.  Not only is it incredibly easy to make, but it tastes better than most Mexican restaurants' versions of guacamole.  I served this w/D's Famous Salsa (also on this site), and everyone was raving about both!

I don't think I've ever rated a recipe on here, and I've used many over the years.  I have so many requests for this Guacamole, that it's becoming my signature dish!! Being allergic to jalapeño peppers,  I am still able to heat this up with the cayenne. I top it with Cotija Cheese (similar to feta) like they do at many restaurants for that added bit of salt and texture.  Thank you for the PERFECT quacamole recipe!

Absolutely fantastic!!  I followed this recipe to a "T" except for the cilantro - - I'm not a big fan of cilantro.  I added a dash of Tabasco too to give it some zip.  My husband was licking the bowl, that's how good it is.

Yum!  This recipe is quick, easy and delicious.  It is very easy to modify it to your tastes.  I upped the garlic and onion and halved the cilantro since that isn't a favorite in the house.  Will definitely be making this one again.

Great guacamole recipe!  I did leave out the cilantro (not a fan) and didn't have tomatoes on hand, but this was WONDERFUL!  I'm not too much of a guacamole person but I really liked it, and my mom and hubby (who are huge guacamole fans) thought it was great.

I have to agree with the majority here - fabulous!  I subbed some good, spicy salsa in place of the tomatoes and had to settle for dried cilantro as opposed to fresh (it's all I had).  Will be making this a lot this summer.  Thanks!

This is the tastiest guacamole I've ever had! So glad I found it! It was so easy to make, after I finished off the first batch, I put the ingredients on my grocery list right away. I did not add the optional cayenne, but I'll try that next time.

We were having some friends over for Mexican, and I decided to try making guacamole for the first time. After reading through the recipes, I chose this one based on the ingredients and ratings. It was so easy to make and it turned out great...my husband even ate some, and he hates guacamole! I should have doubled the recipe because it was gone in no time! I will always use this recipe without changing a thing. I am going to try it on burgers next. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!!!

Yum!  I've never made guacamole since my fiance doesn't like it, but we're having quesadillas tomorrow night and I wanted some to go with mine.  Made this up tonight so the flavors could meld and couldn't resist a sample.  This stuff is great!!!

Super-easy and Wonderful guacamole. I left it nice and chunky and the texture is perfect for chips. I followed to the letter and really do not see any changes that I would make for the next batch. Tastes even better the next day!! Can't imagine buying store-bought again as this is just so easy.

I made this for a dinner at my husband's boss's house.  I was intimidated by the boss's wife, who is known far and wide as a great cook.  Not only did the boss and his wife love this guac, but they requested I make it again for the next dinner.  I loved it, and even my guac-hating husband said it was good.

I've tried several recipes, and this is the only one I will ever make again.  I made it one day for my husband's friends, and within an hour the guys had eaten it all!  It tastes just like the guacamole we had on our honeymoon in Mexico...perfect!

As a transplantded Southen Californian I have to say that after making this, I miss home a lot less now.  It's very good.  Even though I added a bit too much cilantro, it just rocked!  My sister and mom both loved it too.  And it's sooo easy.  Great recipe.

I didn't have any cilantro so I didn't use it, but this was AWESOME anyway!  YUM!!  I loved the cayenne pepper - it was just what the guac needed- a little extra flavor, but no outrageous spicey flavor.

Excellent guacamole! I used dried cilantro, as my grocery store was out of fresh. I thought all the ingredients were perfectly proportioned, but the amount of onion you use should depend on personal preference and the strength of the onion. Also, finely mincing an onion (garlic or pepper) will make the flavor more pungent, so take care when chopping. Additionally, the cayenne pepper can be scaled to your preference or omitted entirely. I substituted it with 1 seeded and finely chopped jalapeno. I used the guacamole on chicken quesadillas, and dipped we tortilla chips in the leftovers. Great!

There's really something to be said about a simple recipe that is consistently good...this is one of them.  My only modifications are typically to add a little more salt and cilantro, but that is purely by preference.  Great job Bob!

A friend called and said "Bring guacamole, I couldn't find any at the store."  THANK GOD, because this was much better than any store brand I've ever had.  Exactly what I wanted in guacamole, even though I did forget the cayenne.  This will be added to my recipe book for sure!

Great fresh guacamole recipe.  Adjust seasoning to your liking.  My husband gobbled this up.  Make sure to use ripe avacados (I was idiotic enough to once buy an unripened avacado)!

This has a wonderful blend of flavors. The cilantro and cayenne are perfect additions! If the lime I use is large, sometimes I don't use all of its juice. Every time I make this it's a big hit.

I make guacamole for my family's weekly mexican dinner night.  Last week I thought I would try a new recipe, so I pulled this one up.  I was a little skeptical about the large amount of lime juice and salt...so I only added a little at a time.  I ended up using half a lime, 1/2 tsp salt, and 1/2 tsp garlic and my family LOVED it.  This way you don't overpower the avacado. Cilantro is a great addition :)

This recipe makes the best guacamole.  In the summer I love to add in a chopped habanero pepper picked fresh from the garden.  This goes so well with blue corn chips.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Tripled this recipe, without the cayenne, for a work party. It was gobbled up, people were scrapping the bowl.  Every single person asked for the recipe--which I gave with credit to Bob.  The best guacamole.  So absolutely fresh!

This was absolutely FABULOUS~!!!  I added one jalapeno for a little kick.  It was my first time making guacamole and it was the best I've ever had thus far!  Even better than restaurant quality!  My husband actually ate more guacamole and tortilla chips than his steak last night! Thank you for this wonderful recipe Bob!

My husband was not a huge guacamole fan until I tried this recipe. Everyone who's tried some has enjoyed it. I love the fact that it's super simple.

I gave this recipe five stars because it was the first time I ever made guacamole and I was very pleased with this recipe.  The only change I made was using lime juice from a bottle rather than from the real thing.

This was pretty tasty!  I doubled the recipe and took it to a Cinco de Mayo potluck and had no leftovers.  I like guacamole a bit on the lime-y side, and thought that this was just about right.  Mine definitely tasted better after refrigerating overnight.  Thanks for a keeper recipe!

This was DELICIOUS! We can't get enough of it! I leave out the cilantro because my husband and I don't care for it. Simple to throw together.

Fantastic and easy. I've made it twice this week already!  I couldn't get quite the right spice with cayenne pepper, so instead I added a couple shakes of Tabasco.  That did the trick.  Very good. Great with Pico de Gallo quesadillas from this website.

This guacamole is excellent!!  I prefer a little bit more lime juice, but that is the only change I would make.  I don't even generally like guacamole, but am hooked to this recipe.  We had a barbecue last weekend and everyone complimented me on this dish.  Since then, I have had to make it twice in one week!  The best part is that my husband has now learned how to make it, so I get all of the taste and none of the hassle. :-)  Thanks!

Yummmmm!!!
My first time experience to make Guacamole and it came out absolutely delicious. 
The only custom addition from me I added 1 finely chopped  jalapeno pepper (seeds removed).

Thank you for the recipe.

added jalapeno and more lime juice and cilantro  :)  just a helpful tip - when avocados go on sale at my local grocery store I buy lots and make a huge batch of it - then spoon it into 1 cup containers and freeze it for future meals.  It freezes amazing and doesn't go brown at all :)

I really never liked guacamole... that being said, I like this recipe a lot!  I used bottled lime juice (2t), two slices of onion and 2 slices of tomato, diced, and no cayenne.  we don't like cilantro, so I left it out.  I would think that anyone could start with this basic recipe and have a successful batch of guacamole in no time!

Made it as described in the ingredients. Was a big hit. Everyone liked the zing from the lime juice and pinch of cayenne pepper. Made it twice so far, will make it a few more times before the winter rolls in.

This is my first time making guacamole but definitely not my first time eating it.

I used 2 cloves of garlic, added a little more cayenne pepper and a lot more cilantro(just bc i love it). Brought it to work and everyone liked it so make it as is and then adjust to your taste????

LOVE this recipe! I always add more lime, and it also helps to keep it from browning so quickly. If you don’t want to take the time to cut up the onions, tomatoes, cilantro, etc., I recommend buying a container of fresh pico de Gallo! It’ll save you lots of time, and you should still get the same desired result! I also add a little bit of chili powder, and a touch of cayenne for that added spice.

Oh. My. Goodness. So usually I just 'wing it's and add stuff until it tastes good enough to eat. And it never turns out like i hope it would. But following this recipe turned out PERFECT. I halved it, because it was just my husband and me. I also do not trust my knife-cutting skills, so I used a hand-powered food processor. 

My husband is of mexican descent and is really picky on his mexican food. And his fruits. And his vegetables. Basically he doesn't like anything that comes from the ground. I chopped this up and gave him a small sample and he LOVED it. He wanted a second taste. He said I WILL EAT THIS BY ITSELF. So yeah, its pretty good. Definitely a keeper. I literally made an account with this site just to write a review. 15/10.

I've been wanting to prepare guacamole for years and this was my first shot. It was fantastic. If I never tried another recipe, I would be completely happy with this one. It's excellent. One cautionary note: Be careful with the salt. It's easy to add too much. Go a little at a time.

Increased for 8 servings but only used three Roma tomatoes. It’s very good. Wanted enough to have some for dipping chips and some to add to salad to make guacamole salad. Should be enough hopefully.

The recipe is really good, just put less salt. I added only 1/2 tea spoon and it was perfect.
The guacamole was gone at our party!
Thanks for the recipe!

Made this on a Saturday and it was browned by Monday. It was very good and very tasty when I made it. Little disappointed it didn’t stay fresher longer. Any tips to keep it fresher is greatly appreciated. I stored it in a plastic bowl with a lid in the fridge

Excellent an authentic tasting recipe. My kids absolutely loved the flavor of this guacamole. It’s rather simple to make, but the key to it is the quality of the avocados you use. I’d highly suggest that you buy fully ripened avocados, or purchase your avocados at least three days prior to making the guacamole to have the best tasting guacamole possible.

This had too much salt and onion for me. However, it has all the ingredients necessary for my perfect guacamole. I loved the pinch of cayenne pepper as I don't like jalapenos in my guacamole, but I like a little heat.

I followed this recipe (well, 5 batches worth), but added extra lime juice, cut the salt in half, and cut the onions about in half.  I made it the day before a party, and when I arrived it was delicious and everyone was raving about it.  If you have to prepare it a day ahead and don't want it to turn brown (like avocados do), store in a tall narrow container to limit the surface area that is exposed at the top, and top with a layer of lime juice.  Mine was as perfectly green the next day as it was when I made it!

I added all the ingredients to a food processor one at a time. I did the avocado last because I like it a little chunky.  I ommitted the salt  for health reasons and I did not miss it at all. This was fresh and delicious.   My company loved it too.

I'd give this recipe 100 stars if I could! I've been making this recipe for 2 years now, and every single time the bowl is wiped clean, and I make TRIPLE recipes of this each time. Everyone raves about it and says it's the BEST GUACAMOLE they've ever had, and that they can't stop eating it! The only ingredient I don't use is by personal choice as I don't care for the flavor of cilantro. Nobody has noticed it's not in it, only I know it's not there. This recipe is AMAZING in flavor, texture and color. YUM!!!! 100 STARS for sure!!!!!!

I love this Guacamole Dip.  I made this recipe for my grandson's birthday party and everyone liked it.  I brought the little bit that was leftover to work for a co-worker and she absolutely loved it and asked for the recipe.  It was easy and fast to make.  This will be a go-to recipe for all my upcoming summer parties.

Have made this one several times now. Simple & quick to make.  Very tasty! We like a little more kick, so I increased the garlic and cayenne, and also added fresh ground black pepper. In addition, I substituted chopped red onion, which added some nice flavor.

This is amazing guacamole that I've made at least half a dozen times. The best suggestions from reviews that I have incorporated are:
a) double or triple the garlic (to taste)
b) double the cilantro
c) smash all but one avacado, then cut the last into 1/4" chunks and stir into the mix
d) add a finely chopped jalapeno pepper
e) cover the completed guacamole with plastic wrap and chill in the fridge for an hour.

This recipe is amazing. Tip: to help reduce browning of the guacamole, leave the pit in it after you are done. It sounds silly but really works!

I have made this guacamole several times, minus the cilantro.  It is my go to guacamole, very easy to put together and very fresh tasting.  It will keep nicely in the refrigerator for a day or two as long as you place an avocado pit in the guacamole after it is first prepared.  I do like to add a fresh diced jalapeño to the recipe as well as the cayenne pepper to add some spiciness.

I made this for my husband and a group of his friends this weekend. It was a huge success!! Everyone absolutely loved it. I don't eat guacamole so I have no opinion either way but those who tried it said it was one of the best ever! Thank you for sharing.

Perfect, AS IS! This is the closest thing I have ever found to authentic guacamole found in mexican restaurants. This is so easy to make that I don't even have to look at the recipe anymore. Thank you for sharing such an easy and delicious recipe!!!

Best Guacamole Ever!!! Simple, easy, wonderful tasting recipe with no alterations. I sometimes put cooked, cut up shrimp in it just because I love shrimp but it is great made as per the directions. Thanks for the great recipe, it has become a family favourite.

Very simple recipe. All the metrics and ratios are great. It's plain. But on the mark. I used the viatmix for about 5 pulses because I like it smoother. Also you could go with a couple pinches of cayenne if you like it peppier. And I used only one tomato and 1/4 of an onion because mine were quite large. Skipped the cilantro. You could use parsley for that fresh green taste. :)

We loved this!  Used 2 HUGE Avacados, 1 Med Tomato (not Roma but removed seeds), 1 small lime and 2 lg pinches of salt.  These were the only adjustments we made to the recipe based on what we had, and.... well.... YES, just YES! We love guac and usually eyeball ingredients, but this was great and definitely a recipe worth following!

Super easy and very tasty! This is probably the best quacamole  recipe I've ever made.  I used lime juice from a bottle  and pre-minced garlic from a jar as a shortcut.

I have been making this recipe for almost a year now and this recipe NEVER seems to fail me. If I want guacamole and I don't have ripe enough avocados, I will leave them in a brown paper bag for about 6 hours or so in a slightly warm place and they will soften right up. Also, I usually add maybe a 1/4 - 1/2 cup more tomatoes. (I love tomatoes :) anyway,... YOU MUST TRY THIS RECIPE

I made this guac the first time exactly like the recipe stated.  It is very good as is.  This time around I adjusted it to my family's taste.  I used 5 avacados that were a little too ripe so I had to make it smooth style.  I almost doubled the tomatoes and oniions.  I used half red and half yellow onion.  The red tangs it up quite a bit.  I used one good shake of cayenne for each avacado.  I also used about 1/2 the salt (1/2 tsp).  I used CLINK1833's suggestion and added a jalapeno (deveined and deseeded).  I also used 2 whole cloves of garlic.  I used the juice of one lime, but will add some fresh for each use over the next day or so to freshen it up.

So, i'm from México and i live in México. If you want to make a great guacamole, you should be starting for reducing the quantity of salt, by a half of tblespoon you use one lime, take the garlic and the ground cayenne pepper and instead of that you can use a pinch of common black pepper and 200 gr of Cotija cheesse and to eat that wonderful thing i recommend friend pork skin, yes, CHICHARRÓN DE PUERCO. The best snack of all times. 
Also, you should come to México and taste some real things that cannot be imitated even from another state in México.

Easy and yummy. I agree with other commenters. Half that amount of salt would be enough... Start with that and add more if you need it!

I've made this recipe approximately 5 times now for family parties. No changes to the recipe. It's always a hit when I make it. I personally don't like cilantro but everyone who's eaten the guacomale says it's delicious and there usually isn't any left by the time the main course is served.
UPDATE: I've started adding one jalapeño and one extra garlic clove to the recipe; makes this already incredible recipe even  better.

This is great as is.  Simple, easy and delicious.  I have made it as written many times but have recently been adding a few things.    
I add a few chopped Jalapeños and a bit of cumin to suit my tastes.  And I have some sort of weird addiction to salt so I add a bit more.  Some people think this recipe has to much salt but I disagree.  We all have different tastebuds as we all know.  I wish all recipes were this simple.  Now, to just plant that  avocado tree.

Very easy to make! I like my guac a little chunky so I cut up one of the avocados to give it a good consistency. I wasn't able to get cilantro from the store so I omitted it, but added some chipotle chili powder to add a bit of spice as well. Great recipe!

It's really easy and quite tasty! I modified the recipe by using 4 avocados (that's what I had on hand), 1/3 cup finely chopped red onion (I'm not a huge raw onion fan)  and 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper.  The cayenne gave it a slight burn, but not overwhelming at all. I followed the recipe with all other ingredients. It was a hit!

I didn't buy an onion from the grocery store because I THOUGHT I had one at home.... Needless to say the one I had in the fridge wasn't any good. ?? But, with a little quick thinking and improvisation, onion powder did the trick! I will make this EVERY time i make tacos!

I tried this per the recipe & thought it was salty & bland.  So I added what I thought it needed & it was great.  It needed 1/2 tsp of cumin, 1/2 tsp of cayenne, a diced jalapeño seeded & membranes removed, and more tomatoes.  I do think it was too much salt, but I couldn't take that back out, next time I'll only use 1/2 tsp.

Great base to work from!  I added about 1/4 cup of our  favorite fresh made chunky salsa since I didn't have any tomatoes or cilantro on hand. I reduced the amount of onion to 1/3 since we aren't too keen on a  lot of raw onion in our food plus the salsa already has some onion in it. A tsp of salt seemed excessive so I just added a couple pinches and the end result was perfection. So happy I found this recipe for my family to enjoy, thanks Bob!

After making this for the third time, I can't say enough about this guacamole!! It  is so darn yummy!! I do double the lime and add jalapeño pepper chopped really fine. Other than that I follow it exactly. We made a batch for a party of 80 and it was one of the hits of the evening.  The lime juice and salt really make it. Oh - and I use red onion. I like the way the color looks.  We will be making this a lot!!

Award-winning recipe! I adjusted a bit and won my office's guacamole contest. Added lemon pepper and a little extra garlic. Also used cherry tomatoes and red onion. Delicious!

Great recipe! We love guacamole in our family. Adding a Roma tomato was a welcome change from the way we usually eat guacamole.  I used less salt as suggested by one review and subbed garlic salt.  For a little more zip, add jalapenos.

We really enjoyed this.  I recommend doubling the lime juice (two limes instead of one) and extra onions if you like them.

Very good. A little too salty so I'd cut down on the amount in the recipe. The addition of garlic is interesting. I think adding fresh jalapeno instead of cayenne pepper is a no brainer.

My first time trying and making Guacamole. It was awesome and everyone that tried it including my 8 month son loved it. Only thing I did different was triple the garlic as we are garlic lovers. It was the perfect amount.

I am going middle ground here, since my husband liked it, but I didn't. There was something off-putting about this, and I can't figure out what it was. I made sure the avocados were ripe, but not too ripe; and did everything as stated. Somehow there was something very bitter about this, and I can't figure out if it was the garlic, the salt, the acid from the lime juice; I just don't know. I put in a ton more cayenne because I like the kick, and ditto that for the addition of two jalapenos... but somehow I just didn't care for it in the end :\ With that said, I added a teaspoon of sugar to try to cut the bitter and I STILL disliked it. So, I give up. The hubby can eat it, and I'll just stick to eating other dips.

Like other reviewers, I love this recipe. To tweak it a little, though, I fry a few chicken tenderloins in a mixture of lime juice, garlic, and a touch of cayenne and then shred it and add it to the guac. My executive chef husband is crazy about it!

This recipe has been used numerous times.  We adore it.  The flavour varies slightly based upon the ripeness of the avacado and/or tomato.  Otherwise, it's perfection on our book.

Absolutely The Best guacamole EVER!!!  I have been using this recipe for years and it beats any fresh restaurant guacamole.  The best compliment was when a relative said it was the best guacamole she had ever had - and her sister owns an "authentic" Mexican restaurant in Texas!!!!

This is the first guacamole recipe I have ever tried, and I'm not sure I will ever try another.  I follow directions with one exception - I add the juice of 1/2 of a lime more to the recipe, regardless of what serving size I am making. I have made it 4 times since the first, sometimes smooth, sometimes chunky. Great on grilled chicken, w/ corn chips, or used as a spread on turkey/bacon sandwich. Exploring more serving suggestions today. Love it!

Definitely a five star recipe. Only change I made was using red onion as opposed to regular yellow onion. The recipe came together very quickly and it tasted amazing. Made it for a party and let's just say my guests ate it all! Thanks for the great recipe. Definitely went into the recipe box for the future.

I didn't want the avocado I had cut into earlier today to turn brown so decided to make some impromptu guacamole today. Had all the ingredients on hand except the tomatoes. I didn't feel like going to the store so I substituted with a can of drained rotel.  Best guacamole ever. I like it even better than chipotle and that was my favorite prior to today.

Wow!! This is absolutely delicious and so simple to make. I don't think I'll ever buy guacamole from the store again. Per other reviewers' suggestions, I did use less salt- only half a teaspoon- and I thought it was perfect. Great recipe!

Very healthy and preservative free.  Love it!  Very quick and easy to make.  I discovered that putting clear plastic wrap over the guacamole and making sure to leave no air pockets from edge to edge of the container will prevent the guacamole from oxidizing and turning brown. But also make sure to seal the lid after putting the wrap and refrigerate.

This was pretty much perfect!  My boyfriend is demanding I make this again and again.  I used red onion and highly recommend that--I think the acidic bite of that did a lot to balance the saltiness.  And I used only one tomato and thought that was plenty.  Next time I'll probably go without the cayenne and add a bit of jalapeno instead.  Thanks for this recipe!

I had my softball team over for a BBQ and it was a hit!  I used two cloves of garlic (make sure it is fresh and not pre-chopped)and 6 avocado.  Instead of 1 tsp of salt, I used 3/4 tsp and chopped the red onion in the food processor so it was nice and fine.  I always use more cilantro then required. YUM!

Absolutely loved it!  Perfect meld of flavors!  I added just a sprinkle of salt to taste instead of 1 tsp and left out the optional cayenne, but, other than that made exactly as is.  It would also be great with some fresh jalapeno added.

I love this recipe. It is very simple yet very good. I added a little bit extra lime juice but otherwise followed the recipe as presented. Will definitely make again!

Addendum: The first time I made this, I used bottled lime juice, and it turned out very well. Last night I used freshly squeezed lime juice, and the result was a vast improvement. I will never make it any other way!

Out. Of. This. World.  

I've made this many times and it has never failed me.  I usually add about 1 tsp. of cumin to give the flavor some depth.  I can honestly say, this is the best guacamole I have ever had.

Loved this recipe. Used 1/2 teas salt instead of  one teas. We eat it with salty chips. I will also use a little more cilantro  just because we like it.....  5 star recipe for sure!

Delicious!! Great flavor!! The only thing that I changed in this recipe is I doubled the garlic, changed fresh chopped jalapeños for the Cheyenne pepper, and I used sea salt (I find it adds a better flavor to most recipes). My children loved this recipe!

Yummy - I added a bit more lime and a bit less salt; very tasty and best served with warmed tortilla chips or as a topping in tacos, burritos... I've made it a few times and guests love it. This is now my go to recipe for a great guacamole.

My first attempt at making guacamole and it turned out incredible. Fresh cilantro is a must, but more importantly is having quality avocados. I add a little more cayenne but it's great without it.

I used fresh chopped jalapeno instead of the cayenne pepper- everything else stayed the same in the recipe- awesome!

This was just OK for me.  I must have done something wrong as I found it to be a bit bland.  I tasted too much onion and other than that it just seemed a bit bland.  That and I don't know if I didn't add enough lime but mine started turning dark after a day covered in the fridge.  I gave 4 stars instead of less on the possibility some of the problems may have been "operator error" so to speak. Probably will try again with some of the others suggestions for adjustment.

Absolutely fantastic.  The blend of ingredients is just right. No one flavor dominates another.  This was my second time making it and the only change I made was the amount of salt.  I served it with homemade pita chips for the perfect appetizer.

This is SOOOO good.  We had steamed tamales, beans and rice with this guac. OH my - I am such a hit with the neighbors. Everyone had a great time and I had time to enjoy them all. Took the suggestion to save the pit and keep in the guac until serving -  or after. So easy. So good.  Thanks, Bob Cody for a keeper we all enjoy.

Came out very good. I cut the salt in half (I'm sure 1 teaspoon would have been way too much). I used all of the juice from one small lime, but I think it was a bit too much. Half of the juice would probably have been plenty.

This rating is based on my taste testers...(I don't eat guacamole).  My BF just loves and raved about this, he didn't think it could be so easy, its so easy enough that he makes it own his own now.  Only suggestion is to just start with about 1/4 tsp salt and then adjust accordingly.

First time trying it and my boyfriend and his best friend loved it! I personally think it was just a tad salty but extremely extremely amazing! So maybe next time I'll make I'll just use a little less salt. Great with multigrain Tostitos!

I've never cared much for the guacamole that I've tried at various Mexican places I've been to but I've made this recipe twice now. The first time was just "ok", I didn't have fresh lime or cilantro. I made it again today with all fresh ingredients, including fresh lime & cilantro and it is so good! We did opt out on the tomatoes since neither me nor my daughter like them but the flavor (and difference the fresh ingredients make) was amazing. We'll definitely make this again and again.

I made double for a party last night and I added one jalapeno. Everyone was commenting on how great it was and thanking me for bringing it, asking for the recipe,etc. BIG HIT!  I just chop my avocados into small chunks because by the time I mix the rest of the ingredients into it, it's half mashed up anyway! Delicious

Very good recipe as written. We always use fresh cilantro. However, we've used lime juice out of the bottle and used lemon juice once when the lime ran out. Best when using all fresh ingredients. We also add more garlic to suit our taste. We think it tastes better when made and chilled for a couple of hours while the ingredients meld together. If you have leftovers or are making the day before, save one pit and push into the middle to keep the color from turning brown. We tried once to spray lime juice on the top, but the pit works much better.
Thanks for sharing.

This guacamole is perfect the way it is written, nice balance of flavors. After reading so many reviews I added cumin the 2nd time and I have to say it is equally as good either way.

I'd never made guac before this, and it turned out great! Super easy, and the cilantro is an awesome kick. There was a little too much onion for my taste, but I'll definitely be making it again, just with less onion.

This guacamole is fantastic.  It does take a little time to make but so well worth it.  Watch the video as there is a great tip about making sure the plastic touches the guacamole when you store it and it will not get brown.  I never knew that and it works great.  We make this almost every weekend now.

Very good started guac recipe! Easy to make, doesn't take long, however it was a little bland for my taste.. I recommend some extra cilantro, garlic and cayenne pepper to spice it up more!

My boyfriend and I always make this guacamole together and it is THE BEST! We can never stop eating it, once we start.  We play around a little with the portions to taste and it's always delicious! I suggest making several batches because you will not want to share! :-P

So easy to make.  It all depends on the ripeness of the avocado and how finely the onion/tomato are chopped.

For someone who's not that savvy in the kitchen, this was just amazingly delicious and easy! I used regular avocados so it confused me whether or not to adjust the ingredient portions, but it worked.  Does anyone know if to use hassa avocados or regular ones? Thanks! Great recipe thanks for sharing!

Tried and true standby.  This is, by far, the best guacamole I've ever tasted.  I'm not one to follow recipes to the tee but have found that this one is best just as written (using the juice of fresh limes versus the bottled juice). I have shared it with many and everyone raves.

Since I made this recipe for my family who are huge guacamole fans they tell everyone about it and are always wanting me to make it. By far the best I have ever had! No restaurant can even compare! I have never tried it with cayenne pepper and I add a little extra lime.

I was craving Guacamole and my local favorite store only makes it on weekends!  I immediately came to allrecipes because I love that there are reviews from real people.

This recipe did what we needed it to do.  Based on reviews, we added cumin and jalapenos (dice)   This is delicious!  We decided to stick it in the fridge as the avocado had been sitting in a sunny window.  We are letting the flavors blend and cannot wait to snack on this tonight!  Thank you so much for sharing this!  

I have a garden so I just used one roma tomato (the rest were green) and several cherry tomatoes.  Yummy!

I am now going to make my own

Be warned!  If you bring this to a party or gathering, you will have to make it again or you will not be invited back.  This is all folks want me to make anymore!  Delicious, creamy, flavorful, wonderful!!  I made it with red onion and added two more avocados because they were kind of small.  Very much a crowd pleaser.

This recipe is a WINNER!  I can't tell you how many times I've had guacamole that was just so-so.  Yuck.  This recipe kicks it up a notch with onion, garlic, cilantro and lime.  I mash up the avocado so it's about 75% smooth and leave the tomatoes fairly chunky, say 60%. I like texture.  I'm a texture girl.  A good guacamole recipe will make you very popular with your friends and family.  This guacamole is paired with a good organic chip.  Spectacular.

Great flavor.  The only thing I did different, because of my own preference, was juiced a 1/2 of the lime vs the entire thing.  I could not wait the hour!  Used this as a topping for taco's that I made.

What the deuce?! This guac is fanfreakintastic!!! I did add a jalapeno instead of the cayenne..very worth it. Anyway, never buy guac again. Just spend $5 and make this. Now, to continue stuffing my face with deliciousness....

This was a good guacamole.  Make sure to use ripe avocados--not over-ripe!  The avocados make the difference.

I used red onion, added the salt to taste, and put in some garlic powder. Delicious! However, I LOVE guacamole, so the real test was my husband who isn't usually a fan. He loved it too; in fact I caught him licking the dish to get every last bit!

PERFECT Guacamole.  It is my signature party dish.  I'm liberal with everything - cayenne, salt, lime...that's a matter of taste though.  just do trial and error on the salt - I like tons.  You can get cilantro in a tube that lasts a long time and saves the chopping.

I followed this recipe to a T and it turned out great! It was my first time making guacamole and this recipe was easy to follow. I was somewhat nervous about being able to find ripe avocados that were ready-to-use; I haven't had much luck in the avocado department. However I did a little research beforehand and basically the way to tell if the avocado is ripe is my squeezing it. It'll be distinctly "softer"/easier to squeeze than the others. At least that's how I figured it out. :)

This was delicious, everything blended so well and it was so creamy.  The only change that I made was that I did not add tomatoes since I did noy have that on hand.  My youngest who is the pickiest of the family, could not stop eating it. That's when I know I have a keeper.  This will be made many times during this summer.  Thanks

I made this recipe last night but must have done something wrong since it tasted too heavy of avocados. Will try next time skipping the onion and subbing a little salsa for the tomatoes.

First time guac maker and this was very good. I thought it was a bit salty as written, and I followed it exactly. I added one more avocado and then it was perfect. I used cherry tomatoes quartered instead of roma and 1/2 of a red onion.

I omitted onion and cilantro (we don't like them), and subbed about 3 TBS of salsa for the tomato (I was out!!) and we all LOVED this recipe. My 14 year old actually made this himself and was SO proud of how it came out - between three of us we ate up more than half of it in one sitting! Perfect with chicken tacos and tortilla chips.

Not being a guacamole fan, I wouldn't know a great one if it slapped me.  But my family are great fans of this terrific recipe.  I had to omit the tomato, simply because I had none, but it was still wonderful.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Salt to taste instead of using an exact amount. And I find diced Jalapenos go over better, as far as adding heat.

This was chunky and delicious! Don't try to substitute lime juice and cilantro, we did on our first batch and it just didn't have the same punch. Stick with the ingredients and you're sure to have a real pleaser here.

Best! Just make sure that if you squeeze the avacados with the peel still on, it has a little give. I usually buy the avacados 2-3 days before I want this dip. I made this exactly the way it says, and I LOVE it! Thanks!

This was fantastic! I left out the tomatoes only because I didnt have any. The only other thing I need to mention is that I used kosher salt instead of regular table salt & lime juice from a bottle instead of a fresh lime. I will definitely use this as my go to recipe. I didn't even let it set for the flavors to blend, but ate it right away. LOVED IT!!!

I've never made guac before but love to eat it, therfore, I was a little intimidated. I followed the recipe exactly as written....and wow!! It was delicious!! I believe in trying a recipe exactly as written first, then altering when I make it a second time (if needed). This is one that needs to alterations! The guac was creamy  but chunky. The flavor was smooth - none of the ingredients overpowered each other. It was VERY yummy and this will be a recipe I will use often!!!!

Holy guacamole!  (haha, couldn't resist!)  This is a great recipe for one of my all-time favorite appetizers.  It's so fresh testing and very flavorful.  This will be my go-to guac recipe.

We love this quacamole! I don't know if I just get limes that are too big but using the juice from one lime was too much lime for us. We are using half a lime instead and adding a little extra if needed.

I made this for the first time yesterday to take to a potluck and no one liked it. Way too much onion and we had to add more lime and some lemon. Also the recipe didnt specify which kind of avacados to use so people were like why is it yellow and not green.

This is an amazing recipe except the inclusion of cilantro ruins it. I've never in my life tasted a more disgusting herb then cilantro. Next time I'm going to try  green onion instead of cilantro.

This is amazing and fresh!  I use a whole red onion, A LOT of cilantro (much more than the recipe calls for), and I rarely add minced garlic...it really doesn't need it.  I also normally finely chop a large jalapeno instead of using cayenne pepper.

Better than any I've ever had!  Always a hit. If you're a person who enjoys "heat" a half of a seeded japeno and a dash of Tabasco are a nice addition... But this recipe is perfect as it is!

Winner.  I've made this many times, and people often say it's the best they've ever had.  Also, it's quick (except the first time, years ago, before I learned to cut an avocado in half and scoop, rather than peel).  Sometimes I add a bit more lime juice, and young people sometimes request a bit more salt.  Fortunately, you can always taste and add more at the end.  Best fresh; doesn't keep long.

I have honestly heard this more than once: "I don't even like guacamole, but I love yours!" This is THE BEST! I increase the cilantro in the recipe because I am in love with cilantro! It's delicious! Try this one out :)

Nothing better than welcome friends with a bowl of chips, guacamole and salsa. I have tried this recipe, but I  add 1/4 of a green pepper chopped very finely; a drizzle of olive oil and omit the garlic. Cilantro and tomatoes must be chopped very finely as well.

Great go-to recipe for guac.  I often vary the amounts of each ingredient based on taste and desired chunkiness.  I also add chopped, fresh jalapeno and ground black pepper--we like spicy!!  My fiance loves this and asks for it all the time!

I used to use guac seasoning packets when I would make guac. I'll never do that again! This recipe was a big hit and tastes great for days. I tweaked it a bit to suit my tastes, but not too much to really alter the original. I love cilantro so I used more than 3T. I also think next time I make it that I'll use just a little less lime juice.

It came out WAY too salty, and I ended up doubling everything in order to overcome the saltiness.

Otherwise, tastes great.

This is the best guacamole I have ever eaten!!! I made several adjustments just for my personal preference. I ommitted the onions because I do not like the taste of fresh onions.  I also added a little cumin, and some diced jalapeno peppers for kick.  I made the recipe for company that was staying the weekend.  I made this recipe 3 times during the weekend because everyone loved it so much!

My family loved it, I did make a few changes though. I didn't use as much onion and I ended up using more avocados and I minced a jalapeno and mixed it in. Over all I loved making this recipe and I plan to make more.

i'm one who generally prefers to make simple recipes (such as this or hummus) based off taste preference from scratch, but i decided to give this one a shot based off the awesome reviews and ratings. i never have thought to add lime juice to the guac i usually would make- that was a nice, zesty touch! but i have to give it 4 instead of 5 stars because i don't think the onion really fit in with it. next time i will use onion powder instead of diced onion- i think it was a texture issue but i think the powder would fit better for the flavor. i also was not a huge fan of diced tomatoes in this. i thought it took away some of the appeal. oh, and a touch of cumin made it perfect! otherwise, great recipe and glad i tried it out! one i will make again with some modifications... thanks for sharing!

Have made this twice and it doesn't last long enough to turn brown.  Didn't change anything about the recipe.  Do have difficulty finding avocados ripe enough to serve immediately.  Is there some kind of trick to get them to ripen faster?

Very easy, very "customize to your own taste" friendly.  I added a little more of this and a little less of that to make it what I wanted but THANK YOU for the awesome start!!! I never thought to make it myself before.  I usually used packets. Now I always will make my own!  :-)  Great!

Wow!  I do not like the Guacamole that you get in restaurants, but had tasted fresh once and wanted to try it again.  This is AWESOME!  Easy to make, I used my Ninja Chopper to mash the avocados and mix in the lime and salt.  I can't stop eating it! LOL!

Perfect with no alterations necessary! I prepared it exactly the way the recipe was written the first time, it was so good and fresh I actually ate this by itself! The second time I made it, I was pressed for time, so I substituted a fresh "salsa" from the grocery store  (the kind that is basically just tomatoes, onions, cilantro chopped up already- not the "saucy" kind, and that worked well too. Thanks for sharing this!

YUM. This guac is so delicious. I'm not one for cilantro, so I omitted that. I also unfortunately only had unripe avocados at the time, but it still tasted amazing! I mashed them up until they were pretty smooth. Turned out great, everyone loved it. You can really play with this recipe to suit your personal tastes. A 5/5!

Imade this just as the recipe states without the ceyenne since I have a little one and didn't want it to be too spicy. I was the best ever!! I had guests over that couldn't stay away from it!

So naturally good and good for you too, as long as you don't over indulge!  I add chopped jalapeno and ground cumin to taste.  If no kick, I add a few drops of hot sauce also.  Great with torilla chips or that special mexican meal.

This was easy to make and my whole family loved it.  We opted to chop the onions very small and put it a bit of extra cayenne.  10 minutes of work and you'll have fresh guacamole.  We spread it on a tortilla and put grilled chicken breast and some southwest marinade with it.

I made this the night before and covered tight with wrap (after coating the wrap that will touch the guac with light olive oil). I think it tasted better the next day and it didn't even turn brown! I will use this recipe again.

I made this tonight for the first time. I have absolutely no talent in the kitchen and have never made guacamole before, but my boyfriend - who has always insisted he hates it - tried it and loved it.  He said - and I quote - "the flavors burst in your mouth". I feel like a culinary success and will definitely make it again :)

I have been looking for a recipe like this for guacamole... better than Cooks Illustrated.  Holy cow this is great.  I would probably add one more avocado (the ones I picked may have been small-ish).  Added 1.5 Tbl of mayo because I didn't have any sour cream.  This recipe is a true keeper.

Delicious, perfect blend of ingredients, wouldn't change a thing. The fresh cilantro is a must for me but I understand some people can't stand the stuff; I have no doubt its just as tasty if you leave the cilantro out. This is my go-to guacamole recipe now, thanks for sharing!

This is a delicious recipe! I, too, don't care for mayonnaise in guacamole. However, I am one of those people who absolutely hates cilantro. To me it tastes of soap. No problem.....I either leave it out entirely, or I have added chopped parsley. Either way, this is a very tasty version of guacamole.

This is fantastic. I add salt to taste, and a little black pepper. You can also substitute finely chopped jalapeno peppers if you like it a little more on the spicy side and ditch the cayenne pepper. YUM YUM YUM!

This is the way I make guacamole, the only difference being that I use diced fresh jalapeños to taste (about one or two medium for this recipe) but will try the cayenne pepper. Always get lots of compliments on mine.

The garlic would be better toasted in a dry skillet, and there are more Mexican tasting sources of heat- I think Serrano chiles taste best in guac.  If you don't like raw onion, it can be sauteed, or toned down by a brief soaking in water.

This was my first time making guacamole.  I told my son's friends and they were kind of rolling their eye balls at trying my first attempt!  
Boy were they surprised and came back for seconds and gobbled all up!  I think it is the garlic that makes it different from all other recipes/

I have used this basic recipe for yours and it is excellent.  I use 1 chopped serrano chile rather the cayenne pepper, but it depends on how hot you like it!

Since the first time i tried this recipe and it became a regular for me at least twice a week, it's one the best dips ever to use with grilled chicken or meat like in the mexican fajitas

This guacamole was really good! My kids and I loved this recipe just the way it was but my husband thought it had a bit too much lime. He said the lime flavor overpowered the guacamole for his taste. Maybe I'll go with just half a lime next time. But I will definitely make it again!

OUTSTANDING recipe!  I honestly think it's better than the local restaurant selected as the community's best choice for upscale Mexican.  They offer a tableside guac that's fantastic, but this recipe may just outshine it...thanks for posting - didn't change a thing!

Great recipe, everytime I've made it everyone loved it. I use red onion and make sure to chop it finely but add a bit less than half a cup (maybe a 1/3 of a cup) as I don't like raw onion to be overpowering. I figure you can always add more if not strong enough.  I don't find the onion is too strong in this dish if you let it sit for a couple hours. I've also made it with diced jar jalepenos as well rather than the cayenne pepper. Used baby Roma tomatoes about 8. I've served it with raw vegetables, homemade pita chips and also with corn chips. Delicious!

Total crowd pleaser!  Only substitution I do is dried minced onion just because fresh onions don't work for me.  With the minced onion I get a milder onion flavor and it's easier on the tummy.

I have made this at least 20 times, not much to add to the reviews except to say that it's always a hit. I've made it exactly as listed many times, but sometimes when I don't have any roma tomatoes I just use 2 tbsp of chunky salsa, and it's just as good.
I like how there's no mayo or miracle whip in here too -- it's creamy enough that you don't need it.

I put everything (only 1/2 the lime juice) in my food processor and made a nice smooth Guacamole and then added in 1 more roma tomato and 1 more avocado and pulsed it so it would have some chunks. I was glad I had the extra avocado because the lime juice was still too overpowering for me even though I cut it in 1/2. But that's just me. I usually keep the lemon and lime juices to a minimum for most recipes.

This recipe is fantastic!! I did however add some jalapenos, cumin (1 tsp)and a also doubled up on the garlic.. you wont be disappointed!! :)

I've notice  a few people say to to leave an avocado pit in the guacamole to keep it from turning brown.. After a little research I have found that the key is not the pit but rather preventing oxidation.. simple solution is to press plastic wrap tightly to the guacamole.. hope this helps!!!

I'm sorry, but I didn't have two of the ingredients (cilantro and the lime juice, I used lemon) and it still turned out delicious.  I could eat the whole thing myself.  Great recipe!!

Great guac recipe! I just learned about it two nights ago and have already made it twice! I plan on making it a third time tomorrow for my staff at work. I think it tasted great although my girlfriend thought it needed less lime juice. Great recipe regardless!

I never cared for guacamole. Then a friend of mine asked me to taste some she made. It was good, so I searched for a recipe. I found this one and now I love guacamole!  The garlic is a key ingredient. I added a little more garlic and a little extra lime juice than the recipe calls for.  This is the ONLY guacamole I will eat!!  Oh yeah, for some reason the organic cilantro seemed to be a little more potent than the other.  This is quick and easy to make too.

Wonderful! I let the onion soak in the lime juice and salt for a little while and it took on a wonderful lime flavor! This got rave reviews from our guests.

This was good but for me seemed like it was missing something.  I used red onion and added jalapeño and that seemed to do the trick. I left out the tomato (just because i don't like them).  Thanks for a great recipe!

Absolutely fantastic guacamole! Tried a few before and this one is definetely the best. Make sure you refrigerate it for at least couple of hours before serving. Delicious.

I must have done something wrong cuz this was way too salty, though I used the right amount.  Saving grace was that it was just one layer of five so the end product was good.

I have always been intimidated at the thought of making guacamole.  I always bought a mix, or pre-made.  Avocados were on sale and I had fresh tomatoes in the garden and thought I would finally give it a shot.  I made the recipe as written, but after tasting thought it a bit salty so added a 4th avocado.  My husband thought I was excellent and ate a huge bowl of it!  Thank you for the recipe, I will NEVER go back to the pre-packaged stuff again!!

This was the first time Ive made guacamole and my husband and I LOVED it! The only thing I would do differently next time would be to not add the entire lime. It seemed like the lime juice took up the flavor of the avocado more than Id like it to. So squeeze cautiously!! Other than that, it was amazing!!

I've never been a big fan of guacamole, but my husband had brought home some avocados that needed to be used so I gave this recipe a try. This is outstanding!  My 12 year old son, who hates avocado, couldn't stop eating this!  I followed the recipe exactly except for using 4 avocados instead of three, since that's what I had on hand.  Thanks for the terrific recipe. I'm saving this one to use again!

We love this guacamole and I get compliments on it every time I make it!  I mash the avocados, lime juice and salt in a bowl and add chopped tomatoes. I put the onion, cilantro and garlic in the food processor and then mix it into the bowl.  Sometimes when I want a smoother texture, I leave out the tomatoes and it is still wonderful!

This is the best!!!!! What I have done to give it a kick is instead of the cayenne pepper, use a jalapeno pepper (to taste) Just chop it and stir right in.  This will also give a true mexican flavor.

i can't believe i like guacamole! wow! i've never liked guacamole! i decided to try this because everyone tells me that i'd like guacamole if i found a good homemade fresh recipe, and they were right. i didn't even know what a avocado looked like until today and had to watch a video to figure out how to peel and seed it, haah i ate about half the batch! so good! thanks for the recipe. will make again!

YUMMY!  Thank you for an awesome recipe.  I added 2 TBSP of Mayonnaise and blended avocados, lime juice and mayo until smooth then added other ingredients.  It was excellent even though my advocados weren't as ripe as I would have liked them to be.

awesome recipe....Careful on the garlic though...This may be better left for a non-date night, or just ease up on the garlic (at least half it I would say).    Its delicious tho, outside of that!!

This was so good!  and I love that the tomatoes add to the texture of the guac.  I love garlic, so I used about 5 cloves.  But this was definitely better than anything I've bought in the store.

This is a fabulous guacamole recipe.  I follow it pretty exactly, except for adding a little less salt.  I usually double the recipe and use only 1.5 tsp salt total.  Yum!

Awesome recipe. Also I red some of the other comments. If you keep the avacado seed in the guacamole before serving the guacamole it keeps longer with less discoloration.

This turned out so so so good!  I left mine pretty chucky so we could get big chunks of avocados on our chips.  I put one of the pits in the container to help keep fresh.  I will be making this often!!

I'm a new fan of guacamole and this was amazing!!!  Even my 8 year old son, who has tried guac before at restaurants and wrinkled his nose, ran his finger through it and said he liked it!  My husband and daughters were less eager to try it, but I'm a believer and I'll never get store-bought or try another recipe again... no need!

This is so simple and so very good!  Due to salt restricted diet, I only used 1/2 the salt.  I roasted a jalepeno pepper and added that to one avacado in the food processer, along with lime juice, cilantro,and salt.  To that well blended mixture I added the remaining ingredients.  I'm not a fan of cayenne so I skipped that.  Everybody who likes guacamole will be asking for this recipe.  Thanks B. C.

The ONLY negative I've found with this recipe is that you will likely begin to get tired of making it because once you do, that is ALL that you'll ever be asked to make again for a party.  I don't change a thing... it needs to tweaking.  Make sure to use fresh limes and fresh cilantro... it makes a HUGE difference.  Also, for those afraid of heat or thing the cayenne is actually "optional"... my opinion is that is what separates this guacamole from the rest.  It adds a depth of flavor that shouldn't be missed and there is liitle "heat", just a friendly little kick.  As the old commercial says... try it, you'll like it.

This was my first time making guacamole so I needed a recipe - this was perfect!  I only had one avocado, added some lime juice, salt, onion powder, garlic powder and some cayenne pepper and it was perfect.  I didn't add tomatoes because I didn't have any and I HATE cilantro. :) But it was great, thanks for sharing!

This was my first time making guacamole and it was awesome!!! I read the other reviews and took someones advice and added 2 tablespoons of sour cream and i used 3 roma tomatoes. The cayenne pepper gave it the perfect little kick. Definetly making this again.

Excellent!  I have never been a guac fan until I had some made fresh right before my eyes at a place in St. Louis.  Ever since I have been on the hunt for a good recipe and here it is.  Made it for a family gathering and I made sure I got the remaining bit left at the end of the day.  The only adjustments we made were dried minced garlic which we eye-balled (we love garlic so we added plenty) and added extra cayenne for more heat.  To maintain its bold flavors, it's best to serve cold.  If serving at room temp, make sure your chips aren't too salty because the chips seemed to overpower the guac.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is my favorite recipe for Guacamole, I have tried many recipes in the past and have created my own, I have gotten rid of all of them and now keep this one!  I will be making this for a graduation party this weekend and I will triple the recipe and have extra ingredients on hand just in case it dissapears to fast.

DELICIOUS! My first experiment with guacamole and it turned out wonderfully.  I used a TBS of bottled lime juice instead of a real lime and I didn't have the cilantro on hand at the time but it still came out great.  I can only imagine how much better it could've been with it!

This guacamole is THE BEST! The only thing I did differently was increasing the cilantro to 1/3 cup and seeding my tomatoes. I made it about 3 hours ahead and kept it in the fridge with a piece of plastic wrap pressed onto the surface. Everyone at our Cinco de Mayo party said it was the best guacamole they've ever had!

This is pretty good. I left out the cilantro, due to an allergy, but otherwise followed it exactly. It was spicy enough, but I just felt like it was missing something.

This guacamole really is AMAZING! Do not change anything about it. It is fresh, light, and so clean tasting. The lime juice in it not only tastes great but keeps the guacamole from browning. I think it tastes best eaten the day you make it, but still awesome after sitting in the fridge all night.

We love this guac!  It's so good, but really simple! I typically use about 1/2 tbsp of dried cilantro, but it's better with fresh.

Delicious! My only complaint is that I found it a bit salty. I'll scale back to just over a half a teaspoon next time.

This was delicious! I made it for a spanish project and my teacher kept coming back to get more! Even kids who were skeptical about guacamole tried it and liked it! I did change some things about the recipe, though. I started with 1 lime, but added another one because I thought it needed more, I also only did about half a tomato but that's just personal taste. I would probably use a little less salt,  because I ended up having to go out to the store and buy another avocado because it was too salty. Also, I suggest using red onions if you're not a huge onion person. It is a lot milder, and add some more color to the guacamole. Anyway, overall I thought this was delicious and would make it again in a heartbeat.

I didn't have fresh cilantro but I had some dried so I added just a bit of that.  I used garlic powder as I didn't want chunks of garlic.  YUUUUMMMMMM!

This was my first time eating and making guacamole.  I use to see it on t.v. all the time and thought it was gross, but everyone was always eating and raving about it so I set out to find the perfect recipe and I found it.  So delicious, I make for parties all the time now and everyone fights for some.  I just omitted the oil as said by some reviewers. Thanks for a great recipe!

Wow! I am not a guacamole lover; however, YUM! Used a dash of salt, cut the cilantro down 2TBSP, 2-3 pinches of Cayenne, put small amount red onion, minced garlic and a shallot thru food processor. Plus took the advice of another and put 2-3 TBSP of salsa. WOW, WOW!!! YUM! Can't wait to try on my homemade fajitas tonight!

Excellent!  I came upon this recipe when I couldn't make my usual one and was not disappointed.  Loved the addition of the roma tomatoes in this and the pinch of cayenne, yummy!  Lime juice is always a must to me, it makes it!  I also added about a tbsp of sour cream as I always do to my guacamole!  Left out the cilantro as a personal preference, don't like it at all.  Will make again for sure, thanks!

This is a very good beginner recipe for guacamole.  For a little more robust flavor you could try making any or all adjustment:  2 cloves of garlic (pressed or mince) 1 roasted red pepper half - chopped 1/2 teaspoon Cumin 1 teaspoon Oregano Pinch or ground black pepper Jalepeno-seeded and chopped

I prepared all the ingredients the night before and put them in a plastic storage container, without the avocado.  The next day I took it on a picnic and cut up the avocado right there "blanket side" and it was amazing.  I used a fork to get a chunky consistency.  Try it instead of mayo on a sandwich.

Used artificial lime juice, red onion (for a little of the sweetness), garlic powder and no cayenne but added a jalapeno. To get flavor without the heat from the jalapeno, take out the veins and seeds before you add it.

This was actually pretty good guacamole, but it certainly wasn't the best I've ever had. I honestly found it to have way too much garlic. I would use this recipe again, but I would use probably half the garlic it calls for, a tad more cilantro, and also a little more cayenne pepper.

Made this recently for taco night and it was a massive hit. Everyone commented on it. If you know your friends are up to it, add some heat with extra jalepeno or chayenne. Also, make sure you buy your avocados in advance so you can let them ripen them if necessary. It was all gone before the end of the night!

Tasty but watch the cayenne or you will have gross looking guacamole! I got a little too cayenne happy--and although it tasted great, boy was it not pretty! Also, tastes good sans cilantro as well (I am one of those cilantro haters)

I made this last night for a family gathering and everyone loved it! I liked it better than any other guacamole dip I've tried. Thank you for the recipe! I'll definately make this again.

Very Good- made it two times in three days and the second time around did not add as much salt (way too much salt the 1st time I made).

I am not a fan of Guacamole, but I have to say this is the best of any I have ever tried or made. I hate cilantro, so I used about half of what it called for. It was a fan favorite at the big game.

This was good, however, unless you have really large avocados, the lime juice is pretty overpowering. I used 3-4 medium avocados and I would have used half a lime instead of a whole one. Other than that though, the seasoning is great. The best guacamole is simple and fresh.

Excellent guacamole. I added more cilantro and some jarred, sliced jalapeno's that I diced finely. The cilantro is a must.

This had a great flavor and texture.  I omitted the tomatoes, based on preference, and added a few pinches of cayenne.  Next time, I might cut the lime juice back to half a lime - I found the favor a little strong, but the lime juice also helps prevent the guacamole from browning.  I might also add a little garlic powder to intensify the flavor (it might have had more garlic flavor if I had let it sit longer before serving).

This was incredible. Made 4 servings just as directed for me and my husband, mashing by hand in my new granite mortal and pestle. At first, my husband said it was way too much for two people, but somehow we ended up with no leftovers :)... Will definitely make again and again.

So easy and so good. This was my first attempt at guac and I doubt I'd try a different recipe. I love the lime and cilantro in it. I forgot to put in the garlic and it was amazing anyways. I tossed in some corn as well for sweetness and crunch :) We ate it with baked tostidos and celery sticks.

I recommend omitting the salt.  The chips already have so much salt on them that it makes the guacamole chip combination too salty.  Added a dash of cumin like the others and it was just what it needed to make it 5 stars.

This was my first time making guacamole, and it was a huge hit.  Even my husband and father, who said they don't like guacamole, ended up devouring this!  I used four ripe avocados.  The lime and salt was perfect in this recipe!  I think I'll try making my "pinch" of cayenne pepper a little bit bigger next time, but overall I loved this recipe and will definitely make it again.

Love it & so does my whole family! I get requests for this guacamole and don't ever mind making it because it takes very little time. The only part I changed was adding 3/4 C of diced onions and tomatoes instead of 1/2 C. We're lovers of both and it tasted great with the extra amount!

This was okay. If you're using onions make sure you don't wait more than an hour to eat it. I ate some the next day and the onion was overwhelming. I'll try this recipe again, but next time I'll skip the onion and add black olives.

This has become my go-to recipe for bbq's or most get togethers.  Because my daughter eats it, I leave out the cayenne.  Also, I add about a T. of sour cream to make it creamier and keep it from turning brown.  Best guac recipe ever!

Best Guacamole recipe we've ever tried.  When we want it with a little more kick we've added more cayenne pepper.  Also, if you're running short on time, you can always run to the grocery store and get a pint of fresh pico di gallo and mix with the avocados and other ingredients.  Thanks for this, its our go-to gauc recipe.

I picked this recipe because it sounded good and also sounded easy enough to make with my 11-year old son.  He loves guac, and I starting to teach him how to cook.  We made the guac according to the recipe.  It tasted fine, but our family tends to like more pungent flavors and we added a few more shakes of cumin and more jalapenos.  I'm sure you will enjoy it either way.

I made this so many times. I love it and so did everyone else. This became a must have at all the summer parties. I have looked and looked for a receipe that I would like and this is it. I think next time I will add some hot peppers to give it a kick. Thanks you

Unless you're serving this as a main dish (does anyone do that??) this serves more than 4 people--closer to 8 I'd say.  It was a little too lime-y for us, but I can get a lot of juice out of 1 lime. I used red onion b/c we prefer that flavor in raw onions and b/c it makes the dish even more colorful!  With those small changes this will be my go-to guac. recipe.

This recipe was a good start. I think my additions made it really delicious. I used half of the onion because I find that it overpoweres the other flavors.  I added a finely chopped seeded jalapeno pepper instead of the cayenne pepper.  I also seeded the tomatoes before chopping. That way the guacamole doesn't get too soupy. I used Lawry's seasoned salt instead of regualr salt. Mix all ingredients except for avocado. (If the avo is ripe enough you don't need to chop it - just scoup it out.) Then add ripe/soft avocado last and keep stirring and mashing until desired consistency.  I have tried chopping the ingredients in the food processor a few times  but it never tastes as good as chopping everything by hand. I don't know why.  Yummy!

Very yummy.  I was in a hurry so I just used some fresh pico de gallo that had tomato onion and cilantro instead of preparing everything separately.  It was a big hit!

This is a fantastic recipe. I like to saute the onions a bit, and add a few serrano peppers rather than the cayenne pepper though.

AWESOME!  I have been making this recipes for a few years and every time it is a hit!  I recently got married and received a molcajete from Crate N Barrel for a gift and it makes the guacamole even better, so if you are a guacamole addict like myself I would strongly recommend purchasing one!

I'm editing my first review to emphasize just how good this guacamole recipe is. I've made it now maybe 20 times and the most common response I've has is; "this is the best guacamole I've ever had". It really doesn't taste like anything special immediately after mixing things up, but  becomes absolutely wonderful after spending a few hours in the fridge. Make it ahead of time, but finish it all up the second day. Thanks for sharing, Bob!

This recipe is excellent!!!!! I am super picky about any type of salsa/guacamole. it has to be just right. 10 stars!!! I didnt even have any cilantro and it came out great. I added more cayenne pepper though!! next time I might try this with some chopped fresh tamatillo or pablano peppers and take out the cayenne.

This is the perfect Guacamole for people who don't like anything hot. With the Jalapeno it is the perfect Guagamole. If you boil the tomato for two mintues then cop and add, it helps to make it smoother, if you don't like chunky.I did not add any oil.

This is a good guacamole recipe but only became worth five stars after I added some chili powder. Probably really only the needed the cumin component of the chili powder but the only cumin I had on hand was whole and I was too lazy to toast and grind it.

Fantastic recipe (and garlic breath!)--I was out of cilantro and the recipe worked just fine.  I also used lemon juice instead of lime juice with no problem.

This is my first time making guacamole and it looks exactly like how the Mexican restaurants near me make it.  I omitted the cayenne pepper and added some diced jalapeno for the authentic kick.

I took this to a small dinner party untested.  It was a big hit and was eaten up quickly!  I think the garlic makes this recipe.  I added cumin, and some homegrown jalepenos.  I also added  1/2 c.salsa instead of the tomatoes.

A little too much lime flavor for me. I would only use a little next time. Made exact then added fresh jalepeno, better, then added more of everything (basicaly doubled the recipe) to lessen the lime.  I definitely would make again, the rest of the ingredients are perfect.

My husband and I have made this quite a few times and we love it! We do add some diced Jalapeno and more than just a pinch of Cayenne pepper to give it a little more spice. It's great and never goes to waste.  Thanks Bob for the great recipe!

The guac was good but was lacking in flavor in my opinion.  I am very fond of a smoky guac I make and this was just flavorless in comparison.  I think it could use almost double the salt, cumin, extra lime, and some chipotle chilis in Adobo would make it far more delicious.

The BEST ever.  I made a double batch & we just about licked the bowl clean.  I didn't use the cilantro, garlic or cayenne simply due to preference.  I increased the salt, tomatoes & used fresh pepper.  Will make over & over again

This is very close to my guacamole recipe. I dont use cayenne or raw onion. I instead use a couple of dashes of onion powder. Other than that the recipe is one that will make some good ol' guac!

Great starter recipe for one to tweak to their own taste - Guacamole is just a salsa made from avodcado, so you can make it any way you like.  The lime juice will slow the oxidation of the avocado, but you can also use lemon juice.  Add some jalapenos for kick - its good without garlic too (and I'm a garlic lover).

Made and ate guacamole for the first time with this recipe. I always thought it looked funny before! I made it to put on top of Carne Asada. It might be funny looking, but it sure tastes good. I did use only 2 avacados (all I had) and skipped the cilantro (can't stand it). It was very good on the carne and even wonderful the next day with chips. Make this recipe!

This is a great recipe! It's fun to mix it up sometimes, too, and to add whatever's in your cabinet. I used seasoned salt and also some Mexican seasoning I had to give it a bit of a kick without being too spicy. Also, thanks to the reviewer who gave the tip about leaving the pit in the bowl! The pit, along with the lime juice, kept this fresh for the whole weekend. No more brown guacamole for me!

I really liked this recipe.  I think its delicious and so easy to make.  I did make some changes; I added some salsa because I didn't have enough tomatoes.  I also added a tsp. of Worcester sauce, which I find goes really good with avacadoes/.

Perfect!  Everyone at our Memorial Day picnic LOVED this.  I added lots of cilantro and fresh chives from our garden.  We served with a veggie tray...red, green, yellow, orange pepper chunks, cucumber slices, fresh asparagus spears, celery, broccoli.  Also had chips on the side. Will definitely use this often!

I'm not a guacamole person, but I made this for some friends. As the recipe reads, it's a little bland.   **I also DOUBLED the recipe so PLEASE NOTE that the changes I made were for twice this amount!**  Juice of 3 limes, not 2. Add about 1/2 - 1 tsp cumin 6-7 Dashes Tabasco sauce Salt to taste  Even I liked it! My friends couldn't stop eating it - one girl told me it was as good as her mom's. (She grew up in Mexico, so that's DEFINITELY a compliment!)  Delicious!!!

Thank you! I didn't think I liked guacamole till I had some home made a few weekends ago and decided maybe I just didn't like the stuff they serve at the restaurants I've had it at. I used this one as a guide, did not add cilantro (husband doesn't like it) or tomato, as the home made version I tried that I discovered i liked didn't have them in it.  Was great and I used it in a 7 layer taco dip for the girls at work.  I plan to tweak this to our liking and am happy to learn I do like something I thought I didn't. Thank you!

Great recipe!  I add more garlic, cilantro and lime juice than the recipe calls for.  I also add a bit of cayenne on top along with the paprika.  When I mash the avocado I leave it a little chunky as well.  Bon appetite!

This recipe is absolutely FANTASTIC! We'd been craving a good guacamole for a few weeks now, saw the reviews and decided we'd try it out. We followed the recipe to a T and couldn't be more pleased. We'll make it again and again!

My star rating is based on my guess that it would have been really good if I would have left out the Cumin that some of the reviewers said they would add.  I like the taste of the fresh vegetables and the cumin made it taste like a taco.  I'll leave my tacos to taste like tacos and my guac to taste like the delicious fresh ingredients.  I'm going to try again leaving OUT the cumin.

OMG this is soooooooo good!!  I've never found a recipe on this site that deserved 5 stars without any changes to the ingredients.  I would give it 100 stars if I could.  I had never really liked guacamole much until I had an urge to try making me own... now it's my new favorite!  Delish!

Wow! I'm REALLY particular about Mexican food and am a tough critic because I love it so much. This is the first time I've made guacamole by myself and it just so happens it's also the BEST I've ever had! 5 stars all the way! Even my husband who typically hates avocados/guacamole really enjoyed it. At our dinner, it was the first thing to go! You won't go wrong with this recipe. THANK YOU to the person who was kind enough to post it! :) This is a keeper in the recipe box!

This recipe has served as a good guide for me, to know what should go into a guac.  I use about 1 Tb chopped onion, 2 cloves garlic and left out the tomato (not in season here) and blended it all in a mini food processor.  Turns out delish everytime.

Oh, man. Avocado has always been a staple in my diet, and this is my favorite guacamole recipe. I like it a little chunky, and I almost always use red onion instead of yellow or white.

Perfect guac recipe! I'm always asked to bring this to parties and it disappears fast. I add a pinch of cumin and 1/2 a jalepeno for a little kick. Great on a sanwich the next day too! The lime juice is a must to keep it from browning.

This recipe was quick and simple to make.  I also added a teaspoon of cumin as suggested by other reviewers and I'll keep this recipe in mind for my next potluck party.  I truly intended to share the batch with family but I'm eating the last bit of it as I type up this review.  Delicious!

Great guacamole!  Served about 2 hours after I made it & it stayed beautiful & delicious until it was all gone.  I doubled the recipe, added cumin and used only two large roma tomatoes total.  Wanted to add diced jalapenos but my grandma begged me not too :(  I will be making this again & again - with jalapenos :)

Awesome guacamole for any occasion, definite crowd pleaser!  To make it stand out a little more, I added a couple splashes of worcestershire sauce as well as some hot sauce...other then that, no changes neccessary.

Great recipe.  Here is a small addition for some heat... mince half to a whole jalapeno and mash (with the back of a spoon) together with the onions, cilantro, garlic before adding the avocados... and as a parting thought, core the tomatoes for a nicer look.

Excellent!  I took this to a party today and the bowl was wiped clean - everyone asked for the recipe!  On a personal note, the next time I make it I will eliminate the salt or use less.  The lime juice seems to enhance the flavor enough. But this is a personal preference because we don't add salt to much of the food we cook. You won't regret making this!

Absolutely Amazing!  I made a double batch for 8 people and was left with less than a cup.  Even those who don't normally like guacamole were chowing it down.  I made the recipe as called and put a little more lime on top to prevent browning.  Thanks!

This is almost exactly the recipe I came up with when I took a shot in the dark at making guac from scratch. I like mine thick, so I actually use dry minced onion, and I use the lime juice to rehydrate it (put both in the microwave for 10-20 seconds). I agree that a dash or two of cumin is a nice addition, and even a little lime zest.

This is the first time I made guacamole, I've always bought it in the store not to mention expensive. I LOVE this recipe.  I will never buy a store bought guacamole ever again.  This is so simple to make.  When I only added the avocado, lime juice and salt, it was excellent.  When I put all ingredients it was a little liquidy because of the tomatoes, other than that it was excellentt!  This recipe is a keeper.  Thank you for sharing.

This recipe is quite rich, although that's a funny way to describe a healthy dip. The flavour of onion, creamy thick avocado and chunky tomato plus lime hit my stomach hard when I ate it first. I served this when a friend came over and only put a little in a bowl which we scooped up with vegies. It was fine like that but I wouldn't like to have lots. Less is more.

Awesome! Perfect guacamole! I didn't have tomatoes so I used a few tablespoons of salsa that I had already and blended it to make it smooth. Tasted great! Update: made exactly as stated. WONDERFUL! Wouldn't change a thing!

My go-to guacamole recipe, perfect as written.  Comparable with the absolutely delicious, yet horribly overpriced, Chipotle guacamole.  Come on, $1.25 for one scoop?!  Not anymore, when I can make this on my own!

I can't lose with this recipe. It's so easy and always a crowd pleaser. The citrus has an awesome kick - especially when combined with the cayenne pepper and jalapenos. Don't miss out on this yummy dip.

Delicious. I have made this several times and it turns out best when the tomatoes are chopped and separated from the juice. Adding in the juice from the inside of the tomato makes it too runny.

This was great. I made it for a get together and I got good reviews. I used garlic powder instead of minced and I just kindof started adding more garlic and cayenne to a preferred taste. No more buying guacamole from a tub this is our new go to for guacamole!

Love it! I made a double batch for a Christmas get-together. I altered it a little by using one big regular tomato, chili powder instead of cayenne because I didn't have any, and lemon juice instead of lime for the same reason. A definite keeper!

This was my first time making this recipe and my boyfriend and I completely loved it. One thing I do suggest is to add the lime juice to your taste, because mine ended up a little sour. All in all it was great.

Always a hit at parties! I do buy an extra lime and squeeze it over the top and mix it in RIGHT before serving. Tastes nice and fresh. Thanks for the great recipe!

This guacamole is delicious! By far the best I've ever had, and it was so easy to make. Took as an appetizer for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit. Followed the recipe exactly minus the cayenne pepper. Wouldn't change a thing. It was perfect!

Amazing.  I am a nut for guacamole and this is the best recipe I have ever tasted.  It's not necessary to follow the measurements, just throw your stuff in to taste.  I prefer a chunkier guac, so I don't mash up my avocado so much.  Also, the fresh cilantro and lime juice are the key here.  Don't skimp on the lime juice.

This recipe was excellent!  I have tried making guacamole before with not the best results (browned quickly, not flavorful, etc).  This was the best guacamole I've ever tasted.  Like some other users, I used chunky salsa instead of the tomato and onion, just to make it a little easier.  I will definitely make this for my guests again.

Normally my husband and I would pick up guacamole at Whole Foods market and bring it to get togethers, but I decided to "attempt" to make guacamole myself.  My hubby thought it was even better than Whole Foods!  I brought it to a neighbor's house tonight and it was the only appetizer that was gone by the end of the evening.  In fact, it was gone in 15 minutes!  Great recipe!

Very good recipe, I added a little sour cream and jalapenos and used minced roasted garlic in a jar since that was all I had on hand, I did only use one roma tomato, then put in the freezer for a few minutes to chill and this is delicious!

Great recipe but don't be fooled by the serving size. I had to double the recipe for 4 people. I also added cumin, which added great flavor. The garlic was really key in this guac recipe. It didn't taste right without it. Finally, I squeezed another half of a lime before serving. Everyone loved it!

HOLY GUACAMOLE!!!  This was awesome.  I am a big fan of guacamole and had never made it before until now.  This was even tastier than Chipotle's guac (which I thought was the best until now).  Even my husband kept saying how great it was (and he's not a guacamole fan at all).  Thanks for an awesome recipe!

I never made guacamole before and followed this recipe exactly -- it was so good!  The only addition I made due to other reviews was a clove of garlic.  I couldn't stop eating it.  Thanks for the great recipe.  I will definitely make it again!!

I'm extremely picky about guacamole, and my favorite restaurant is over an hour away.  So when I recently had a craving, I searched this site for recipes.  I came across a few that sounded good, but this one had all the ingredients I would expect.  I did take other reviewer's advice and added a touch of cumin.  And my avocados were tiny, so I used only one tomato.  Very very good.  I wouldn't change a thing!  Thanks so much for the recipe!

This is sooo yummy.  Up until this recipe, I never liked quacamole.  I use a lot of cayenne for that extra kick!

Very good; used juice of an orange instead of lime, its a very smooth flavor.  Also used a red onion and kept the cilantro to a minimum.

This is the only guacamole recipe I have made since trying it from this site about three years ago.  It is the best.  A batch only lasts about 10 minutes in my house--my kids and husband love it!!  I do usually leave out the cilantro as I'm not a huge fan but sometimes I put in dried.

From New Mexico, where we know our guacamole:  AWESOME!  Only change was to add some spicy New Mexican salsa, cutting back the tomatoes a bit, as the salsa had tomato in it.  Make sure you use all of the lime; it adds a wonderful, fresh zestiness and keeps the guac from turning black--even by the next day!  Thanks, Bob!

This recipe is fantastic and I didn't find it bland at all. I used just a little more lime juice than the recipe called for and rather than cayenne pepper, I added a splash of hot sauce. I'm not a big cilantro fan but I did use it (fresh) and it definitely adds huge flavour to this recipe and it tasted quite delicious. I thought it was a better guac than restuarant versions I have tried. I loved it.

This is a wonderful recipe. I have made it several times now for family and friends and everyone absolutley loves it! The lime juice and cilantro really make this stand out. Using fresh cilantro, (not dried) is the key.

I decided to make my own guac for an upcoming party.  I printed many recipes to test before the event.  This was the first, and only, recipe I tried!  YUMMY!  I made the recipe exactly as is with all fresh ingredients.  The only thing I did not add is the cayenne pepper, mainly because I did not have any.  I can't wait for my guests to have this!!!

This is awesome but if you want a shortcut on all the dicing and chopping just add the lime juice, some garlic salt, cayenne, and some Pace picante sauce (hot) to taste.  Yum!

Good recipe but, for all recipes that use avocados, try to get the good California Haas avocados. This guacamole was a bit bland with regular avocados (not the recipes fault, gave that a 5).

Mild, but good. Like this with the Guacamole Cilantro Lime Cheesburger on this site better than the guacamole that is given with that recipe. It is good, but you can't taste the burger. Will make both types again.

This was really excellent.  I took it to a women's party and got many rave reviews.  My only complaint is that the recipe says it will serve 4 people, so I doubled it.  However, I altered it a little bit as I saw fit:  I only put 1.5 limes in, instead of 2; 3 romas instead of 4.  I thought the lime flavor was far over powering (but I liked it for my taste).  And it ended up serving about 15 people at the party, and I still had a full bowl (15ish servings) to take home!  It did not brown at all for me the next day, which was a plus because I enjoyed it so much!

OH. MY. GOD. I just made this and it really is the greatest guacamole ever. I changed a few things, however. Instead of three avacados I used four haas avacados, only used half the salt, and to cut down on time, I used half a can of petite diced tomatoes. And I also marinated the cilantro, garlic, and onion in lime juice as another reviewer did. 


Here's a tip I learned from my father: leave an avacado seed in your guacamole to keep it from turning brown if you plan on putting it in the fridge. It'll keep it fresh. 

Thanks for the AWESOME recipe!!

I've made it several times.... exactly by the recipe and it is FANTASTIC!  The last 2 times I made it, I put the garlic, onion and cilantro in the bowl first and marinated it with half of the lime juice for a few minutes as I was cutting open the avocados. I added everything else and the rest of the lime juice and mashed it all together... adding the tomatoes last. It was PERFECTO! Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a good guacamole recipe. I mash half the avacado and chop the other half so it stays a little chunky. I also add some diced jalapeno peppers because I like my guacamole with just a little more heat.

This was a great recipe!  Very tasty and everyone loved it.  I do have 1 change.  I converted it to 10 servings and it called for 1 1/4 cups of onion.  It was too much.  I would cut it down to 1/2 cup.  I will definetely use this recipe again!

This is the best guacamole ever!! I don´t even like guacamole OR avocados!!! I just made this because I wanted my boyfriend from Brazil to know about my culture and Mexican food. He said he didn´t like avocados either but he LOVED this and so did I!! But I can kind of see why he didn´t like them before since his mom just ate them with sugar!! yuck! A must try! Hey, It turned two non-lovers of avocados into now lovers! Thank you!!

This was excellent! I used two avacados, one medium tomato, lots of chopped garlic and extra chpped cilantro.  I squeezed and mixed in half the lime immediately.  I squeezed the other half lime the next day to freshen it up.  Works well... and oh so good!

This guacamole is great! Just to make it even easier I used homemade salsa instead of dicing up the onion and tomato.  It also gives it a little bit of spice.

My husband really loved this guacamole and he doesn't even like the stuff. He wolfed down at least half the bowl himself. I will definitely be making this recipe again when I can find avocados that don't cost a fortune here in Germany...

I found this recipe on a web seach before I was using Allrecipes.  I lost the sheet I'd printed, though.  And the guacamole was so good, I spent hours trying to find this recipe again.  I took it in to work, and not only did it vanish in no time, I had 5 or 6 requests for the recipe.  Even my picky, guacamole-hating friends ask me to make it!

Best guacamole I've ever made.  I added a little bit of sour cream just to make it a little creamier. ETA: I do not add sour cream anymore or the tomatoes

This was the best guacamole ever!  I used a bit more garlic and dried cilantro instead of fresh.

Delish-- got rave reviews at the party it was taken to, and was gone before I knew it. I could not find fresh cilantro, no matter how hard I looked, so I added a tablespoon or two of salsa verde to give it some extra flavor, and some extra garlic. I processed the avocados, onions (I have an aversion to biting into raw onion), and garlic with the salsa verde and lime juice in my food processor until reasonably smooth, then mixed the tomatoes in my hand. Making this again soon!

Very easy!  Taste great!  I added a dollop of light sour cream to make creamy.  It did not take away from the taste.  It was a big hit at a superbowl party.  I will make again!

Perfect recipe!  This guacamole goes great in a 7 layer dip, I just leave out the tomatoes because those are found in the salsa.

I don't care for guacamole, but my DH requested it last time I made Mexican, so I tried this and got rave reviews from DH, cousin and her husband.  I tasted it, and it just tasted like guacamole to me, but I will definately make this again for the fam :)

Most people tell me this is the best guacamole they've ever had.  I have to agree.  Any time there is a party, or pot luck, or get-together, I'm asked to make this recipe.  Thanks Bob!!!

I do add a diced jalapeno to the recipe to spice the recipe up a bit more.  I also use more cayenne pepper than recommended.  Feel free to add an extra roma tomato, and don't forget the cilantro and garlic!!!  Some people say they don't like that stuff, but it makes the recipe!

I'm from California and this is how I have always made guacamole. It's best to make this and let it sit overnight to blend the flavors. The lime juice will keep it from turning brown. However, if you are not a big fan of lots of lime or lemon juice, drop one of the avacado pits on top of the dip once it is made and cover with plastic wrap. The pit will also keep the dip from turning brown. Remove the pit then stir just before serving.

This was the best guacamole I have ever had.  Some of my family members do not like guacamole but loved this!  I didn't have fresh cilantro so I use dried and I left the cayenne pepper out as well.  This will be the only recipe I'll use for guacamole from now on.

This is a GREAT recipe!  I made it this weekend for a New Years Celebration and it was a favorite!  I used about half a can of rotel instead of the tomatoes and I think it kicked it up a notch.  It was wonderful!

So this was way too salty, but I didn't add the cilantro and it drives me NUTS when people give bad reviews when they make changes to the recipe. So I'm thinking with all the cilantro it would have been perfect. Yummmy

OMG!! I have been spending a fortune on guacamole at costco because it's the only place that sold big enough batches..
NEVER AGAIN!!! This was soo yummy and so fresh tasting! It wasn't hard but the chopping does take a lot of time. I tried it with cayenne and without and I found I loved it both ways. I doubled the recipe and I only used 1 lime and I found it was perfect. I had a dinner party and everyone loved it. :) Will make it often!

I'm not normally a reviewer but I have to thank Cody for posting this recipe because I have never found a better one! It's got me through many a party with raves. I must admit, when I'm pushed for time, I take a shortcut & use the Mexican style Rotel tomatoes & chilies (NOTHING but Rotel).
Fabulous recipe - thanks for sharing!

My Dad has always made wonderful guac, I was skeptical that being a native San Diegan I would find the best Guacamole I have ever tasted, but I did.  This is WONDERFUL!  You can eat it right away, but I found it key to let the lime juice, onion, garlic, and cilantro flavors mix for an hour or so in the fridge.  Even better than Su casa's fresh table side guacamole.  USE FRESH INGREDIANTS... I have made it three times in the past 3 days, and I used some onion that wasnt quite fresh and it wasnt as good.  I also subbed air loom tomatoes, but they werent as good as the Roma.  I dont know if you can improve this recipe if you try.. although maybe a sqeeze of orange which I will try next time.

Excellent recipe! I thought it had a little too much salt, but all my friends loved it.

This is the best recipe I've found for guacamole - and I've been looking for a long time! Every time I make it, people ask me for the recipe... it's my "go-to" item for potlucks, girl's night, etc...

Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

I am very picky with my guacamole and this recipe made me want more! I don't completely mush all of the avocados because I like my guacamole a bit chunky. I've always wanted to learn how to make guacamole, and now I can. Excellent recipe!

Great recipe!  My own version is very similar and everyone  raves over it, even those who say they hate guacamole.  Two things I do differently.  This recipe needs some spice and I use one habanero per four or five avacados (pray you don't get a really hot pepper and dice it VERY finely).  I tried jalapeno peppers but they still didn't overcome the blandness.  The second thing I do is after you blend all the ingredients you add club soda to the consistency of your liking-no matter how firm your avacodos are you can get the same consistency each time and somehow the soda water really melds the flavors together.  Chill before serving.  I don't normally use garlic or cayenne but it sounds like a good idea and I'll try the garlic next time!  Cayenne and a habanero would be way too much heat.  The sweetness of red onion helps balance out the spiciness of the pepper.  Shhhhh!  Don't tell anyone about the club soda secret!

Excellent recipe.  This is the first time I've ever made guacamole and this recipe was easy and delicious.  I omitted the tomato since I'm not a fan of tomatoes.  I made the guacamole chunky, which I think gives more avacado flavor.  One tip - make sure the avocados are soft and not firm.

My husband and I loved this guacamole!  It was a bit sweeter than I'm used to, but I think adding some jalapeño next time will do the trick.  Very, very good!  We used it both as a dip and on fried cheese corn tortillas.  Mmmm.

Perfect, simple flavor.  Only had 1 tomato, but that was plenty.  And I used a purple onion b/c that's what they use at my favorite Mexican restuarant.  Next time, I will make sure to chop the onions to almost minced instead of diced.  Other than that modification, this was perfect quacomole!

I have made this very guacamole for years.  It is the only way to make it right and most authentic.  Sometimes I add a dash of cummin. For company I mix all of these ingredients except the tomatoes, cilantro and onion - out that to the side.  Put the guacamole in a pretty bowl and make a hole in the center of the mixture.  Mix the diced onion, tomatoes and cilantro and place in the middle of the guacamole.  It is a very pretty presentation and for those who don't like onion etc...they can still dip arount that part.

Great fresh, straight forward guacamole.  I followed the recipe the way it was written.  Adding the onions and the tomatoes make the guacamole go a lot farther.  I made this for a BBQ with 6 people (there was a lot of food) and I still has some left over which is awesome!

This is the best guacamole ever - so worth making it over the seasoning packet I used to always use. A BIG hit at a party I made it for - everyone asked for the recipe! I substituted onion powder instead of the chopped onions b/c I didn't have any onions on hand.

Wonderful!  Super easy.  I omitted the onions - don't like them & added onion powder.  Also substituted  a few dashes of hot sauce for cayenne b/c it is what I had on hand.  Delisious!  So fresh tasting & super easy!

Will try to medium salsa (drained)instead of the tomatoes next time for a little more flavor.  Unless you hate cilantro, don't skip it!

I found this recipe a year ago and fell in love.  I used in at a 'Guacamole-off' against my bro-in-law, who had the self-proclaimed 'best' ever.  Well, the masses agreed with me and this one won!  It's really the cilatro that makes the dip.  Amazingly done.  Great job.

To be honest, I used this more of a base recipe. I omitted the tomatoes and the onions. I kept the rest the same and it was just perfect for me!

Excellent, this is the first guacamole recipe I have tried, and since making it I am reluctant to try anything else.  I kept all the ingredients the same.  My only difference was to puree everything except the tomatoes in a food processor.  Stirred tomatoes in last.

Was making quiet a few things for a party so handed this recipe to hubby to make, it turned out really great.  Loved the chunkiness of this dip and the colours looked great.  We will be making this again for sure.

This is the first time I've made guacamole, and it turned out well.  Our guests really liked it too.  I added salsa in place of fresh tomatoes and no cilantro as I'm not a fan.

Very good....This is just like a recipe for guacamole I have been making for years and I also add jalepeno to it..sometimes I will also blend the ingredients in the food processor to make the consistency more smooth.

This recipe is wonderful!  My husband calls it "Killer Guacamole."  My mother-in-law loves it also.  I will make this guacamole forever.  I no longer hope that my Mexican friend will make guacamole at our potlucks, because now I have this great recipe.

This recipe is fabulous!  I used 1 Tbsp dried cilantro and 3 Tbsp bottled lime juice instead of their fresh counterparts, and the guacamole still turned out well.  Even my picky 3.5 year old and husband who usually won't touch guacamole thought this was good!

this just didn't work out well for me, on account of the awful avocados available from my local grocery. i did my best, and the taste was fine, but i feel i can't give more than four stars - also can't give less because of all that was my fault. i'm sure i'll try again.

This began as a side dish with chips a for chili dinner I was making. Too bad I ate it all before I even started making the chili! Delicious.

Just the right mix of flavors. This was my first attempt at making guacamole.  It was easy and so good I almost made my self sick eating so much.

Best guacamole you will ever eat!  I made what seemed like an inhuman amount of this for a party and sadly (for me), there were zero leftovers to munch on the day after.  Everyone loved it.  I only used 1/3 of the cilantro because I am not a huge fan, but that was my only modification.

Great guac recipe! I've rarely had better. Like many people, I halved the salt and included just over half the onions. I did add a pinch of cumin, as well. 

I took this to a Mexican-themed potluck and it was the first dish to go. I doubled it but I wish I had tripled it!

Great recipe! I added a half of a minced jalapeno for spice, and instead of the cayanne pepper I used chili powder, along with about a teaspoon of cumin. We ate it all up in one sitting! I prefer a creamier consistancy to the avocado mash, however, so next time I will add a dollop of sour cream (I've used mayo before but I like the consistancy of sour cream better).

I've finally decided that I'm just not a guacamole person, but this is still the best guacamole I've ever had.  There was a sharp taste in there somewhere that I didn't like, either the garlic or the cilantro, but everyone else was blown away by it.

Excellent!  Just as good if not better than the restaurants.  Only change we would make next time is to reduce the salt to 1/2 teaspoon.

This was delicious!  We thought that the onion slightly overpowered the rest of the ingredients, so next time I would use less onion and more tomato.  Otherwise, it was perfect.

This is fantastic!  I made a double batch of this on New Year's Eve and it was a huge hit!  I used fresh lemon juice in place of lime because of personal preference. I also used red onion, also personal preference. I also salted to my own taste.  Other than those personal little tweaks, I followed the rest of the recipe as is. It is excellent! Thank you so much!

This is the best Guacamole recipe I have made.  A friend just returned from Mexico, and she said this recipe tasted just like what she had been eating all week.  I sometimes increase the lime, because I like that "bite".  Thanks for a great recipe.

this was my first time making guacamole but I thought I would give it a try since I love the kind at the mexican restaurant my boyfriend and I frequent. This was absolutely amazing!!!!!! Tasted as good if not better than the stuff they serve there. I loved it! And I wouldn't change a thing. The ingredients blended perfectly. :)

Very good!   I use whatever type of onion I have on hand and usually more of onion and cilantro to suit my taste.  I also substitute fresh jalapeño for the cayenne.

This was better than any guacamole I've ever had at a restaurant.  At first I was disappointed because it had a very limey taste to it but tasted awesome the next day after I let it refrigerate overnight.   I don't think the cayenne pepper added much to the overall flavor though.  Still a terrific recipe nonetheless.

Really yummy recipe - I made it chunky with 3 Florida avocadoes (the larger ones.  Everybody loved it, and commented on how wonderful it tasted!  Note:  I would only put one squeezed lime going forward - it had a very limey taste to it - perhaps a tad bit too tart.

This was so good, thank you Bob. I followed the recipe for the most part, except I used only 1 Tablespoon cilantro and I added 1/4 teaspoon cumin. Fabulous!

Really liked this.  Quick and easy to make.  Found the onion flavour a bit strong and so next time will probably make with green onions so it won't be so intense.  Thanks Bob.

This is a wonderful base recipe, I tweaked it as others have by adding cumin, garlic salt and pepper.  It needs something spicy though like jalapenos or something - but I definitely will use this recipe again and again!

This is a great base recipe.  I would have given it 5 stars, but I did so many modifications to it, that I feel that wouldn't be fair to people who just look at the ratings when deciding on a recipe.  
I skipped the lime, added some lemon juice instead. It tastes better (in my opinion) and it prevents browning.  I upped the amount of minced garlic and added chopped jalepeno.  For spiced I used pepper, garlic salt, cumin and cayenne.

Absolutely delicious!  I have been searching for a good simple recipe for guacamole, but other recipes seemed to be missing a certain something.  I made it with no tomatoes (I don't really like tomatoes) and extra dashes of cayenne pepper, and it came out great.  I made it twice this week - our friends said it was the best guacamole they have had - we had to put it away before everyone filled up on guac and chips!

I may have gone a bit wild with the cilantro (I'm a huge fan of cilantro), and my avacados weren't quite ripe, but nobody seemed to mind!  I doubled the recipe and it was gone within minutes.  I tossed 4 of the avacados in a food processor until they were smooth, and then chopped the other 2 and added them.  That seemed like a pretty good ratio.

My Superbowl men were happy with this recipe, and I appreciate how easy it was.  Alas, the tomato I thought I had was in no condition to add, so I threw in some chunky salsa.  Wonderful, easy, and I think the juice of the whole lime was perfect.

Even though I had to substitute powdered cilantro for the fresh variety, the taste was amazing! I can't imagine how much better it would have tasted with the fresh herb.

So easy. So good.  When I'm in a hurry, I just throw everything in the food processor.  It turns out very smooth, but just as good.  Even some "anti-green stuff" friends ate some, and LOVED it.  Great recipe!

This recipe is wonderful. The flavor is terrific! Just a tip before you squeeze your fresh lime juice in-try heating the lime up in the microwave for a few seconds. You will get more juice from it. Thanks for the great recipe, I will be making this one again and again!

I saw that RDZELLMER would have cut the lime in half... me too.  I put a little less cilantro than called for and added salt and pepper and it turned out well enough.  Guacamole features avacados, not lime!  We'll see how it goes over at work tomorrow...

First time I have ever made guacamole. Very tasty. Even enjoyed the pinch of cayenne. Added a little fresh cracked pepper as well. My boyfriend and I had a great time in the kitchen making such a simple recipe. I have to confess this never made it as far the fridge for chilling!

The Best!! Only you MUST make sure to use ripe (not hard) HAAS avocados--they have the most flavor! I use 4 avocados, no garlic (sometimes no onion), and 2-4 small jalapeno or serrano peppers instead of the cayenne. Again THE best!

Great recipie!!! I didn't mash avacado much after I diced it, becuase it gets mashed well as you mix the ingredients in...used lemon and lime juice, extra garlic...and tabasco becuase I didn't have cayenne on me. Just as good as the dips in my favorite mexian resteraunt!

Amazing recipe, really nice as a chunky dip, I would even cut the pieces larger than I did this time. I did however add a bit of hot sauce (Frank's) and would add more spice next time for a hotter dip.

Great recipe for guac.  Although, it was a bit too tangy for us. Next time we'll try using lemon juice instead or maybe a little of both. But overall, still quite yummy. Thank you.

Good, basic recipe but waaaay too much salt. I didn’t use a full teaspoon and it was still so salty I couldn’t eat it. I think it’s still a good recipe; I will use less salt next time.

This is my go-to recipe! I’ve been using it for years and always get compliments and the bowl is always licked clean! I use red onion because it adds a little color and I like it better and I usually omit the cayenne pepper since I don’t like spice.

This was my first time ever making guacamole. I made this with my friend who was feeling really sad at the time. When we began making it, he wasn't talking or doing much, but he cheered up fast and was smiling and talking when we brought him home. Also, my mom and my boyfriend LOVED it. My boyfriend has never liked guacamole, but he ate lots of this.

Love this recipe. My husband who usually does not like guacamole even likes it. I did made a few modifications I do not add Cilantro. I use 1 tomato instead of 2.  Half of a lime instead of a whole lime. I use paprika instead of cayenne pepper.

My husband is hard to please but he loved this one. I did too. I don't ever eat raw onions but they are disguised in this recipe and can't be left out. I am on day 3 with leftovers and it is still just as good. Best guacamole!

Absolutely delicious! My husband can be kind of particular about his guacamole...but he loved this one! Hooray! Total success. Didn’t measure the ingredients, but eyeballed them according to the recommended portions as indicated in the recipe and it turned out splendid. Will make this again! Thank you!

I added both garlic and chile powder and lots of fresh, ground pepper.  Since many people do not like cilantro, I used fresh, chopped parsley, instead.

fantastic recipe!  I'm on a pureed diet. So I made everything smooth. And it was still delicious. But I did add a tad more lime juice and salt for my liking. So so good.

This is yummy.  I made it to go with pork carnitas and I have almost eaten it all before my pork is done!  I put in a seeded diced jalapeno instead of cayenne.  It is day two and it is still green.  This will be my go to guacamole in the future.

Luv it!  Super easy & tasty! Followed the recipe and  I didn't add the cayenne (optional) since I'm not into hot spicey foods and it turned out great.  Party pleaser.  Everyone loved it.   Recipe as listed makes one large party size bowl.

I've made this recipe time and time again, it's very good as it is although I eliminate the cayenne so that it appeals to everybody. I also add celery salt now, it enhances the flavor that much more.

I made this day the day before I served it, and got rave reviews. At least half the people who ate it said it was the best guacamole they had ever had. I only made slight changes. I used 1 tablespoon of dried cilantro because I didn’t have fresh. I also used Chachere’s creole seasoning, which contains salt, instead of salt plus creole seasoning as directed. I will definitely make this again.

Second time I made it. Used 5 avocados instead of 3 and 1 1/2 fresh lemon squeezed juice instead of 1, because it needed it. Didn’t use the cayenne pepper. Everything else remained. Delicious. My go to guacamole recipe.

Just found out I have an onion allergy and all store bought guacamole has onion in it so I found this recipe to try. Omitting the onion, I followed this recipe as written and OMG.. I was shocked at not only how easy it was to make but how amazing it tasted, even without the onion. Why did I never try making this before? It literally took less than 5 mins to put this all together. THANK YOU! This was amazing!

My go-to avocado recipe. It easily feeds 5-6 people. Everyone always compliments it, and it's so easy to make. Definitely put it in the refrigerate for one hour before serving. I used the recipe as-is and did not make any changes.

A very straightforward recipe that was very tasty, especially for making it in a pinch.   One modification is that I did not have jalapeño pepper so we omitted it.   The guacamole tasted fine without it.

I’ve been all over the country trying guacamole when I happen to find a Mexican restaurant. My wife and I simply love guacamole and this is the best we have ever had. We consistently make this at home, for get together with friends, and any other excuse we can find to make this recipe. I generally quadruple the amount of everything because I need a large amount to feed the masses. This guacamole recipe has converted guacamole “haters” young and old. I’ve made it so many times now that I don’t need the recipe anymore. We like it chunky, not a Madagascar reference, just our preference! This is sure to be a hit for one or twenty-five people.

Very easy recipe. I did tweak it a bit based on another reviewer’s suggestion.  I added a bit more garlic and some cumin.  I also put a little chipotle chili powder along with the pinch of cayenne pepper.  My kids thought it was very tasty.

Easy to make and it’s a crowd favorite.  Even my brother in law (who dislikes anything avocado) went back for more.  I substituted a finely diced jalapeño instead of cayenne.  Make it as creamy or chunky as you like.

I make this exactly as the recipe states, but add a little more than a pinch of cayenne pepper. It’s the best guacamole recipe I’ve ever found and whenever I make it people tell me it’s the best guacamole they have ever eaten! I make this for my family get-togethers and it doesn’t last long!

This has become my go to guac recipe. I blend mine in a food processor as I prefer a creamy texture, and make sure I add plenty of lime.

I'd recommend mixing all your core ingredients first then adding the salt, cayenne and cumin to taste. I did that and it turned out great. I find it doesn't hurt to go pretty heavy with the cayenne but a little bit of cumin goes a long way. Basically just a dash. I'd also recommend fine ground sea salt rather than regular table salt.

I wish this recipe was more specific. Avocados are different sizes (I use Hess) and the juice of one lime is different etc. The first batch had way too much garlic and I ended up throwing most of it out as my husband would not eat it. I actually omitted it for the second batch. I also had to add two more avocados as the salt was too much BUT my guests for dinner and my husband loved it.

Thx for posting. Also, instead of minced garlic I used a garlic press and the garlic seemed to blend into the guacamole easier.  Take Care, ML

This is so good! I did add a Tbsp (or two) diced jalapenos instead of the pepper spice but the spice is good too. Made it more than once. My daughter and her hubby who usually turn away restaurant guac love this!

This was awesome! I used garlic powder instead of minced garlic and added a small amount of fresh jalapeno. So Good!

I  made this as called for in the recipe except the cilantro. I do not like the taste of cilantro so I added a small amt of parsley. Everyone enjoyed it and I had no leftovers. I will make this again but may use jalapeno pepper instead of cayenne pepper next time.

?Question? I made this as directed, except used a lemon instead of a lime. Not that I think it’s better but I only had lemons and it seems like they keep the quac’s color longer when I’ve used in the past - could be coincidence. My question is, the batch seems quite sour. Could it be the lemon and what would you suggest to sweeten? Sugar or honey? Or should I shy away from lemons all together?

Made the recipe as written but added 1 tblsp of sour cream. I took it a work breakfast..it was demolished really quickly and I took home an empty, but scraped clean bowl!
All in all this was a hit. Had to be the cayenne pepper.
Thank you for the recipe. Definitely my go to guac recipe from now on.

Made it for 10 people so ended up using 6 avocados.  Added all ingredients but maybe not in the exact amounts they should have been for 6 . It was almost all gone. Well received.

I suck at cooking but this turned out rather well. I think a whole lime was too much for my batch anyway. I also left out onions and garlic. Def gonna make again.

I made it exactly as prescribed, but used pre-minced garlic rather than fresh.  It turned out great.  I'll cut the salt in half next time.

Delicious!  Only had 1 avocado so cut the recipe in roughly 1/3  tonight.  I forgot to add the garlic & cayenne, but it was still delicious.  Great basic recipe that you could tweak based on your tastes.  I'll definitely make again!

I joined this just so I could rate it. Perfect!!!! Delicious, I can't stop eating it. 
I subbed paprika for cayenne, lemon for lime, mixed the juice and the spices in a separate bowl and added to the started mashed guacamole, didn't end up using the whole mixture and its just fast, delicious and perfect!!!

This a nice and simple guacamole recipe. I did not have tomatoes, so I substituted a little salsa. I would not change much the next time I make this. I would note that the fresh garlic has some punch so go easy unless you are prepared for some dragon breath.

Good flavour- i will stop buying the packets now - this is so much better.  I didn't have cilantro on hand and was still really good.

Hands down my favorite guacamole recipe!! Simple to make and can be slightly altered to taste. I personally add a little more cilantro and lime and it’s perfect. Guests rave every time I make this!

Haven't made it yet. Too many ingredients that I don't like. But I am skimming thru to find one that I do like, so the website is totally awesome!  As I hate to cook,but love food, I've already sent to 3 people to make it for me. They love the site n will start cooking the things that I send them to make. Thanks for having such an awesome site. ~Kristi~

This was my first time making guacamole.  This recipe was so easy and I made no alterations to the recipe.  There is nothing like freshly made guac.  Some of the best guac I've ever had.

took this recipe and made it my own in that I used what I had in the kitchen at the time. 1 avocado, 1/2 lime, fresh parsley, green onion, tin San Marzano tomato (1 whole from the tin) 1/2 large garlic, fresh ground pepper and pinch of sea salt. Chilled for an hour and I really enjoyed it. Just enough for me without waste as Hubby isn't a fan.

I know how to make guacamole, i just can't remember measurements.
This came out great and ready to serve in minutes!
I bought already chopped onions, bottled lime juice, and jar of minced garlic from my grocery store. It save me a lot of time.

I usually dice the avocados in the skin so the guac is a little chunky after everything is folded together.

Made it a bit on the smooth side, will try a little chunkier next time maybe by mixing it all up with half of the Avocado first to blend the flavors, then add the the other half, and mix it less to retain some chunks.  Taste is fantastic.  Use all fresh ingredients.

Took this to a Superbowl party and everyone raved about it! I bought the avocados a few days in advance to ripen them, and also combined everything in advance, except for the avocados (to keep them fresh). Will definitely make this again!

This won the guac-off at the super bowl party tonight.  Instead of using 1 tsp of salt, I used 1/2 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp garlic salt - and skipped the fresh garlic.  Great lime flavor and perfect consistency.

And make sure that onion a red onion!

Too salty but otherwise very good.  I used 1/2 tsp salt and it was still a bit salty for us.

Substitution: I used 1 diced Steak Tomato, Half of a minced Jalapeño, Half of a diced Red Bell Pepper, and added a 4th Avacado. I also salt, peppered, and cayenne peppered to taste. Perfection!

Really good! WAY better than any store-bought guacamole. A bit salty for my taste - I would use 1/2 the salt next time.  But this one's a keeper!

Excellent recipe. I add diced jalapeño to mine and leave the pit in the bowl to keep it fresh.

Delicious! As a shortcut I use prepared pico de gallo instead of chopping the tomatoes and onions. I also add garlic powder and cayenne pepper to taste. Always a big hit at parties.

I had never made guacamole before so I went with the one with the best rating on this site. It was sooo good and easy to make. I left out the cayenne. I will definitely make it again.

I used a little hot peppers grown in the Dominican Republic instead of Cayenne. Wonderful! I would cut down on the salt a little next time. I will certainly make again. Thanks!

Used 6 Avacados, increased salt to 2 tsp, added 3 Jalapeños seeded, deveined, and minced.  Before processing, I finely chopped the onion and placed it in the bottom of the mixing bowl followed by the avacados, jalapeños and salt, using a hand potatoe masher to chop, mix and cream the mixture.  Next came the tomatoes, and cilantro (a complete bunch with stems trimmed off).  A nice heaping of Mexican Cheese at the table to meet your taste.

I followed the recipe exact and the taste and texture was perfect! I would definitely make this again.  It was my first experience using avacados, so I had to do a little research on how to find a ripe avacado.  Maybe a quick how to pick the right one could be added to the recipe.

Made this twice because the guac is so good! Definitely tastes better after refrigerating it for at least an hour. If you are making larger portions, don't forget to get more lime juice as that will preserve the guac for longer.

This was sooooo good. I followed the recipe except I forgot the garlic - oops but it was still very good. We absolutely loved it with our sweet and spicy chicken wraps and tortilla chips. It was the perfect side dish.  I loved the kick it gave as you took your bite and began to chew. The freshness from all the ingredients really made this stand out. We like ours less chunky and it was still awesome the more we mashed it. I made this in the am that way the flavors had time to blend before we ate lunch and it was perfect there wasn’t a morsel left when we were putting the food away.  There were three of us. I have to say though growing up with avocado tress were a little fanatic about all things avocado. I will make it this way from now on. Thanks for the recipe.

No doubt, the best guac recipe.  Once again, my family agrees;  we like this better than any guac we have ever had.  Even all the  local Mexican restaurants' guac pales in comparison.  This has become a staple in our house.

This recipe was super easy and came out delicious. Three homegrown jalapeños, extra cilantro and extra garlic was added for a bigger taste punch. The key is to have nice ripe hass avocados. This recipe is a keeper for sure!

Followed the recipe (except I added a tad more cayenne pepper than called for). Took it to a gathering last evening and EVERYONE raved about it. Will be making it again for snacks during the holidays. This recipe is a keeper!

I made it exactly as written.  Sometimes when the avocados are small, I add an extra one.  And try to use nice ripe avocados.
This is a wonderful and easy recipe.  I usually have to double it  when making for my son's family.  The grandchildren love it.

Thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipe!

So easy and quick to make. I made this for a baby shower and everyone loved it. 
Came home and made some more as my family was disappointed that I didn't bring home leftovers.
I'll be making this recipe again. Thank you

I pride myself on making the best guacamole I’ve ever tasted, but I’m always trying others’ recipes in search of improvements I might possibly make.  This one is pretty great.  I’ve never used cayenne pepper before in my guacamole but I liked it.  I add more elements than these, but this is a good recipe.

Made it for first time.  At end of night all bowls were empty.  Everyone impressed that it was from 'scratch'.  Will now begin to rummage through the comments for tweaks and adjustments...can't wait.  great for anytime or holidays.

Awesome. Subbed lemon juice for lime juice (what I had on hand) and omitted cilantro ‘cause I don’t like it. Will definitely make again.

It was very good guac.  My only problem with it was tasting a bit salty. I would use 1/2 the salt nexrt time, then salt to taste.

Best guacamole ever. One addition though ... my mother always told me to add a pinch of salt to anything sweet and a pinch of sugar to anything savoury. I added a small packet of Splenda and it rounds out the flavour!

It was really good - just too salty. I think next time I will use one more avocado and less salt.

**HINT: Make sure to BLEND not mix, use chopped cherry tomatoes in place of the red bell peppers, and add about 1tsp of garlic salt to bring out the genuine salsa flavors.

I made this last night for a girlfriend get together.  They are all wonderful cooks, so I wanted to make something tasty and fresh!  This was perfect!  I used about 1/2 the onion and I would recommend a little less lime juice, but it was fantastic!!  It makes a nice size bowl for sharing!  Definitely recommend!!

I left out the cayenne and used a dash of garlic powder instead of fresh, and used one fresh Regular tomato from our garden. And used 1/2 tsp salt after reading some reviews. This recipe is awesome!

It was delicious, but needs added cumin and fresh chopped jalapeño peppers for a bit more kick and flavor. Then it’s perfect, especially paired with lime-flavored tortilla chips!

I wish I could rate this higher. This was the best guacamole I’ve ever had. I’ll use this recipe from now on. The only change I made was the serving size. Thankfully I only had one avocado because I ate the hole thing and I’m not sorry either. Lol. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

I made it exactly as written without any changes or substitutions. My guests raved and kept talking amongst themselves about how much they loved it!! Some of the comments included things like"it's great because it's not overdone with too much onion or too many spices." And I would have to agree. It's a keeper!!

Have never been a huge guac fan but loved this! Easy to put together (although I made a huge mess of my kitchen!) and very tasty! I used 1/2 teaspoon of cumin as I didn't have cayenne, a 1/2 teaspoon of salt and a Vidalia onion per someone's suggestion here.

Pretty much followed the directions as written,.  I did cut back a bit on the salt and onion which I minced fine.  I personally don't like biting into a chunk of raw onion.  I did kick it up a notch by adding a 1.2 pound of freshly boiled shrimp cut into small pieces.  I boiled the shrimp for 5 minuted in old bay style seasoning then chilled after draining,  Real nice addition, guests loved it.

Excellent guac. I had a few extra avacados so I used them 
all and adjusted the ingredients accordingly. Other than that I changed nothing. I used the optional cayenne pepper.

I typically substitute whatever I have on hand for my cooking. This time, I used lemon juice instead of lime, and chopped beefsteak tomatoes instead of plum tomatoes. Simply delicious!

Simply delicious! I pretty much followed the recipe to a tee, with the exception of a touch more cilantro and lime. I will make it a bit chunkier next time, and will definitely make this again and again!!

This is the perfect guacamole recipe.  I make it without the cayenne for my kids, and usually halve the salt.  Otherwise, perfect proportions!

This was very good but it was missing something. So I added 1/2 tsp of cumin and I cut the salt down to 1/4 tsp as well. Also it didn't say what kind of onion to use so I opted for a red onion.

This recipe was excellent. I only made a few adjustments: a sprinkle of salt (instead of 1 tsp.); 1 tomato off the vine (instead of 2 Roma); and a few sprinkles of cumin. My favorite part about this recipe is its adaptability!

Careful on the addition of salt. I didn’t have a line so I added a bit of lemon juice instead, I think if I’d had a lime it would have tasted much better. Overall great guacamole though!

I really liked this recipe. However, I suggest starting with 1/2 a teaspoon of salt and tasting it to see if it needs more. 1 teaspoon was too much for me. I put this on top of black bean burgers I made from scratch. It was perfect with them. My Husband raved about the combination. Id give 4 stars but I felt it still deserved 5.

Often times, people will try to get too fancy with guacamole thinking it improves it.  I like this because the flavors are simple, clean and bright.  And, it's easy.

Love it!  This is my go-to guac recipe, no doubt about it.  Only difference is that we are watching salt, so I use barely any.  Just a grind a bit of sea salt over it (less than 1/8 tsp)-- perfect.

A bit too much onion for my taste. And this portion is HUGE! Definitely perfect for a small gathering!

Soooooo good. I don’t like cilantro so I did not put any in but the other ingredients exactly as directed. It was a great blend of flavors and I highly recommend.

Delicious!  If you want it a little creamier you can stir some sour cream through.  I only put in a little cracked salt, probably 1/4 tsp.

The guac lovers in my family had nothing but good to say about this. It was my first attempt at making guacamole and I doubled the recipe. Unfortunately, I couldn’t convince everyone in the family to try it and had half leftover. (Note to self for Cinco de Mayo.) The many flavors blend together perfectly in this recipe, making for a delicious dip! This recipe is a definite keeper.

Made a smaller portion (2 av., half a small red onion, one tomato, one clove garlic, 1 tsp lemon juice, 1/2 tsp salt, omit cayenne / cilantro) and was very good, would make it again.

This recipe is a hit with my entire family! I'm constantly asked to make this for every family dinner and holiday. I recommend using 4, possibly 5 avocados. I also skip onions, but add a little bit more garlic to it.

fabulous.  Could reduce the salt to half a tsp, though, as someone else said.  I used chili peppers instead of cayenne.  1/8 tsp to start with as they get hotter as it sits for awhile.  SOOO good with fresh cilantro and fresh onion.

WOW!!! this is a great, easy, no frills guacamole that is just spot on. 
The only deviation from the recipe was in my technique. after chopping the onion, cilantro and garlic, I sprinkled some kosher salt and mashed/mixed it together for a few minutes with my chefs knife (kind of like mincing garlic) until it was like a paste. then mixed my paste like mixture with the avocados, tomatoes and fresh lime juice. Voila, simply incredibly good guacamole!

I got rave reviews with this recipe. I only put in half the lime juice, thank goodness because a whole lime would have been too much.  I also added jalapeños from my garden.

I LOVE this guacamole! I basically followed the recipe, except I doubled the avocados and all ingredients except for the tomatoes and onions. I used 6 avocados, 2 tomatoes, 1/2 onion, 6 Tbs cilantro, 2 limes, 2 tsp salt, 2 tsp garlic, one pinch cayenne pepper and one pinch black pepper—amazing!

I did make a few changes, added cumin, cayenne, and a dollop of fresh salsa instead of using seeded tomatoes, and less salt, 1 teaspoon is too much!

Pretty good but not the best I’ve had. I would definitely cut salt by 1/2 next time. Seemed to be missing something but I’m not quite sure what.Used red onion. Will probably make it again.

I second everyone else's awesome comments. Awesome guacamole recipe. Do consider using a bit less salt though. Mix in the lime first, taste, then mix in 1/4 tsp salt. If more is needed add at that point.

This was my first attempt at guacamole and it was fantastic!  I did, at my husband’s request, double the garlic and lime juice.  We also added some cracked black pepper and a bit extra salt.  It was awesome!

Omg wow excellent. First time making it. I just can’t see buying it at a Mexican restaurant it’s so expensive for such a small amount of it. I try to make most things from scratch for it’s usually cheaper and you know what ingredients are in it and there is nothing like fresh food verse when was this made. This guacamole recipe was super easy to make and I’m not the best with the knife. Will definitely make again and send to others

Fabulous! Everyone that has had it at our house wants the recipe and have considered it the best they have ever had. The only problem I have is to procure good avocados in the winter in Minnesota.

Great recipe.    Love putting diced tomato in it. Had to use red onion and dried  cilantro. Will definitely get the fresh cilantro next time. Also like to add a  few drops Milhenny green sauce.

This is the best guacamole dip ever! But here is a tip- to keep the dip from turning brown, leave one of the avocado’s pit in the dip.

Simple to make and very good. I used garlic powder to save time and added a little onion powder and cumin, which always go good in guacamole.  Good with tortilla chips and Crab Ceviche from this site. Light but filling supper.

I’d also like to add (from my last review) that I added jalapeño with seeds removed for extra flavor and a kick instead of the red pepper flakes.

Great recipe, all the ingredients I like to have in my guac :) However, I did only add a pinch of salt, not the entire teaspoon whereas I think that would have been way too much.

It tastes awesome! Question for the creator or anyone else: how much is a serving? Is it a cup or  something like that? I want to keep track of my calories with this but no way am I eating a quarter of this at a time.

I made this recipe for a friend, and while she has not tried it yet, I have. I liked it, but I have made a few edits that I will be using when I make it again, and you can use it too! 

I put in a tiny dash of extra lime juice, only half a teaspoon of salt instead of a full one. I also put in about a teaspoon of the cayenne instead of the estimated 1/8 of a teaspoon, and about 1/8 tsp. of ground cumin. 

My only qualm was the cilantro. 3 Tbsp is D E F I N I T E L Y too much in my opinion. Next time I make this I will be putting in about a teaspoon instead. 

Over all, I liked it!

This was so easy and tasty....but I did make some changes as suggested by other reviewers:  added 1/2 tsp. white vinegar, about 1 tsp. sour cream, about 2 Tblsp. my favorite salsa and, since I didn't have lime, I used lemon juice instead...about 1 Tblsp.  I only used 2 large Haas avocadoes so my measurements were 'eye-balled' so texture did not get too thin.  Very good stuff!

Very easy to make and very good!  I did a short cut.  I used the fresh organic salsa from Costco for my tomatoes, onions, garlic, etc. mixture plus the rest of the ingredients to make it.  Hubby said it was very good and he doesn't even care for guacamole.

My husband, who says he doesn't even like guacamole, loved this. My kids reported that this was a million times better than the mix envelopes that I've made in the past. Even though it was a bit time consuming to prepare, the extra time was worth it, and I will make this again.

It didn't blow me away, but it was definitely good and tasty. I'll definitely make it again. It's a very safe guacamole recipe that really can't go wrong.

This recipe is delicious. Makes a lot. I'll try to adjust all ingredients by 1/3 for next time ( ie 2 avacados, etc). Also I will reduce the salt from 1 tsp next time to 1/2 tsp next time. I found I could really taste the salt.

Excellent! My husband and I both loved it! 
I did not add any salt.  The chip rounds that I used for dipping had enough salt.  We also added a pinch of cumin as others mentioned.  Very very tasty.  Thanks for the recipe!  
I read that if you are not using right away to refrigerate and cover with saran.  Ensure the saran is touching all the top surface of the guacamole to prevent discolouration.  Worked like a charm.

I made a double recipe for a party of 12.  I thought that I would have leftovers, but it was all consumed.  Turned out great.  The only thing that I changed was that I did not use the Cilantro, since I had some people at the party that did not like Cilantro. It was still great.

I like this recipe, however I think I will half the cilantro next time, just based on my personal taste. Also, I might add a little more avocado to make the guacamole just a little thicker, since mine came out a little on the juicy side. Still has a really nice flavor though.

This recipe was my first attempt at making anything with avocados and I've made this particular one twice already.  I followed the recipe almost as written but left out tomatoes and cilantro because I don't like them.  I used parsley instead and eyeballed the salt amount so it was probably about 1/4 tsp.   I put everything in the blender and it was done in no time. The trick with this is to make it ahead of time and let it sit in the refrigerator at least an hour so the flavors meld. Each time I made it I had none left.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This is the best guacamole ever!  I cut the salt to a heaping 1/2 teaspoon and replace the cayenne pepper with half of a fresh jalapeno pepper.  The pepper has to be fresh - the canned peppers taste awful in this recipe.  A family favorite!

This is how I always make guacamole except I use a fresh Serrano Chile pepper instead of Powdered Cayenne. I don't ever measure anything, just make it to taste.

My first time to make guacamole and this recipe met my high expectation!  Excellent - very fresh tasting.  Based on other reviews I did decease the salt to a pinch since it's easier to add than remove.  Otherwise I followed to the letter. It was enough especially considering the salt on the chips.

Great recipe. And very easy to make.  I used the large avocado which worked perfectly.  I did have to leave out the cilantro since we had someone allergic to it.   I was afraid there would be too much onion and salt but with the large avocados it was perfect. Had request for the recipe. Will add this to my family favorites folder.

Very, very good! I increased the garlic a little, omitted the cilantro (just a personal preference), and made it chunky
 Next time I might add some chopped jalapeños. Thanks so much for the recipe.

First time attempting guac and it was awesome! I doubled the recipe because I was taking it to a BBQ. When I arrived, I thought it would be too much, but the bowl was empty 3 hours later!!! Delish!!!

I have made this 3 times already and may have to make it this week!  Everyone loves it.  It is easy and quick to make.  We have a friend who is a bachelor and eats dinner with us.  He said he usually doesn't like guacamole, but he loves this!

This is by far the BEST recipe for Guacamole I've come across yet.  It's a HIT in my household EVERY TIME.  Instead of dicing tomatoes I use Rotel petite diced tomatoes with chilie's. I'm generous with the minced garlic and cilantro.  It turns out delicious without fail!!  This is definitely a keeper!!!

As a lover of guacamole this one fits the bill. I didn't measure out the salt but only added it to taste and used diced jalapeno to taste in place of the optional cayenne. This one's a keeper.

This is so simple I can't believe I have never tried making Guacamole before.  I'm not good at chopping cilantro so I through mine in my little ninja chopper. A batch of this last about 1 day in my house.

This is a fabulous guac recipe. Quick and delicious. To make even faster, I substituted 1/4 cup cilantro salsa instead of separate onions, tomatoes, and cilantro.

This recipe for guacamole is absolutely delicious. To get more flavor I added a bit more garlic, and cilantro in the mix. It gave the guacamole more flavor.

Amazing guac recipe, but adjust according to taste.  I prefer a less "sour" taste, so only use half a lime per 3 avocados / per recipe proportions.  Anything more is way too sour in my humble opinion.  Also, I like to go a little lighter on the garlic (too heavy garlic taste for me, which overcrowds the delicate avocado flavor).  I use 1/2 tsp per 3 avocados / recipe proportions.   :)

I love this recipe and always get raving  reviews when I make it. One of the little guys I mentor declared its better than his mom's. I had to quickly explain why he can never say that about anything! Lol. I do add some serano peppers for an added bite. Excellent recipe!

I would give this 10 stars if I could. I have been making this guacamole for a few years now and I ALWAYS get rave reviews and requests for the recipe. I take no credit and mention I got it here. It is SO delicious that any other guacamole is just sad now. I follow the recipe exactly, except for adding a bit more cilantro because we like it. I "halve" the recipe for just my husband and myself using one large or two small avocados. And I throw it all in a food processor and give it a few whirls. Easy. Yummy. You can stop looking for the perfect recipe - this is it!!

It's a solid recipe but I prefer far more tomato and garlic in my guacamole. I triple the tomato, double or triple the garlic, preferably use 4 large avocados instead of 3, and call it "Mama's Guacamole Salad". It's a big hit with everyone. I've also found you can omit the salt and nobody will notice unless it's the focus of the meal (i.e. a large bowl of dip for chips).

It turned out fantastic! You could tone the salt down a tad if you really wanted but it wasn't overkill in my opinion. Ithe was a hit!

Great easy recipe that can be flexible based on how you like your Guac.  I know it's hard but try to chill it for an hour or so before eating, so much better cold!!

I added a pinch of cumin and minced a jalapeno (no seeds), used red onion, and doubled the garlic. I learned this from a Mexican woman and I like the bite and everyone else loves this dish.

Made this for Easter, added some sour cream to cream it up a bit. It was absolutely delicious and went well. It was the first time guacamole was served at this particular family's gathering and those that are into guac were pleased by its presence.

Not too excited about this.  The one I make I've never had a recipe for I just winged it one day so I'll stick to that. This one was bland.
I add a bit of sour cream to mine and also a little salsa and cumin.

Easy to make and delicious!  Best to keep on fridge for 2-3 hours before serving.  Still is good the next day, but best same day and fresh!  Smells so good!

Awesome recipe! Hint: soak the red onions in ice cold water for 10 minutes to remove the pungent odor.  Then toss them into the recipe. They still add great flavor!

Followed recipe exactly. Easy to make and very good. I will cut back on the salt next time. Also followed suggestion of other reader and added a bit more lime juice to reduce browning. It worked.

This was the first time I made guacamole without just adding salsa to avocado's.  I could not believe how good this was.  I had everything on hand but not exactly the right amounts but it still turned out great.  At first I thought there was too much salt but after it set for a while it was totally fine. I'm going to make this a lot now because I love avocado's.

I have made this twice so far, and think it's the best quacamole recipe out there. First time didn't have any lime, and used lemon, was just fine, and second time had only 2 avocado's so lessened all the other ingredients by a small amount, and both times used way less  Cayenne, as I am not a fan of too much heat. Loved it!

I've made guac all my life and never used a recipe - last night, 6 people told me it was the best I've ever made, I think this recipe is a keeper.  Also, the avocados weren't the most flavorful I've had, so that's saying something.

This stuff is awesome.   I use half a seeded jalapeno diced up instead of the cayenne.   Other than that don't change a thing!!  I've made it 100 times and there are never any leftovers!!

I use this recipe, as written, again and again and again. It is easy, delicious, and easy to tweak to your own preferences. I have yet to try adding mango, or nectarine, or any other fruit (even though I love those additions in guac when we are out eating or at a friend's home) because this basic recipe is very yummy just as written.

Impress your guests with this easy-to-make recipe that uses fresh ingredients! 

Use scallions (green onion) for a less-intense onion flavor and add a pinch of cumin. Yum!

I made guacamole for the first time with this recipe and it was a HIT at work. Was even asked for the recipe. I took another reviewer's advice by lightly mashing 2 of the avocados with a fork, and then chopping the last one into small chunks  to stir in. I stored it in a plastic container with a seed and it didn't go brown for hours after serving. Lastly, I didn't have any cayenne pepper so I just used an extra large pinch of paprika instead. Very small alterations, so I still give this recipe a 5 star rating. Will make again for sure!

Made this recipe for a work potluck. Everyone loved it and said it was the best guacamole that they ever had. I didn't add the cayenne pepper though due to the fact that we didn't have any, but the recipe was still fabulous.

As usual I can't just make a straight recipe. This was a great base but here's what I did to jazz it up for our tastes. I used 2 avocados. I added a 1 1/2 tbsp of mayo, 1/4 to 1/2 cup salsa (I didn't have tomatoes), 1 tbsp dried cilantro, 1 tsp chipotles powder, and, since I had some crumbled feta cheese I needed to use, I added about 2 tbsp to the mix.  It was delicious!

This would have gotten 5 stars from me except for the salt.  1 teaspoon was way too much.  For anybody making this for the first time, definitely cut back on the salt.  Otherwise yummy yummy yummy!

Our first attempt and we had high standards to meet having had the best ever homemade for us in Mexico.  Very good results and we will be making this again!  Rated a 4 only because we were missing a couple of key ingredients that would have made a difference.

I used a large, finely diced jalapeno pepper instead of a pinch of cayenne, but it still needed some more heat. It was,however,  an easy recipe to make.  If not consumed right away, it would be helpful to mention coating the surface of the dip with lemon juice or other acidic liquid to prevent it from turning brown.

Instead of cayenne and salt I used a a habanero-lime and jalapeño-sea salt seasoning. About what the salt and cayenne would have been. It was great!

I didn't add garlic or onion but it turned out pretty good regardless. I need a little more practice with avocados because they don't last very long and I don't eat the guacamole nearly fast enough :)

I made it for the first time last week.  It's the first time I made guacamole, and it was so good!  I made it again last night and didn't have quite enough cilantro left, so I added a little extra garlic and it was still really good.  I'm keeping this as my go-to recipe.

Some people are more sensitive to salt than others.  If you think 1 teaspoon is too much reduce the amount to your own taste.  There is no need to write a review in which you appear to be angry about it.  The author of the recipe doesn't know that you are salt sensitive.

Terrific guacamole! I used a dusting of garlic powder instead of the fresh garlic, and only 1/2 tsp salt, omitted the optional pepper. Otherwise I made it exactly to the recipe.

This is my go-to guac recipe.  I just made a big batch of it for a Super Bowl snack.  The only modifications I recommend are using 1/2 tsp. of salt and substituting a half to a whole fresh jalapeño pepper for the cayenne.

This was very good on some fresh veggies with lemon and salt. I also put in on my chicken with sour cream. 

We are not big on guacamole and honestly never have it, but I had some avacados that I didn't want to go to waste. Glad I tried this. My 10 year old, (who I was sure would HATE it) who hates avacados and tomato with a passion, loved this and raved about it. My little guys weren't crazy about it but their on the extreme end of picky. Lol.

Thanks for the recipe. Will make again

I add diced jalapeño for some heat. The onion adds a nice crunch. Cilantro and tomato add a nice touch.

It was fantastic. The one and only thing I did do was cream the avocado first before adding everything else. It was chunky and the flavor did mix super well. But even with this, it was amazing!! Everyone loved.

This is how I've made guacamole for years.  The only thing I add is finely diced jalapenos.   You simply can't make it any better.    I've lost count of the times I've been told by others that it's the best guacamole they've ever eaten.

If you want some heat, chop up some jalapenos and toss them in.  If you really want some heat, add cayenne pepper as part of the seasoning.   Also added some scallions too.  This is easy to make and anything with avocado is going to be delicious.  Perfect for parties.

I've made this dozens of times. I follow the recipe, but would advise adding 1/2 the salt and lime and then doing a taste test before adding it all. Limes of various sizes hold +/- juice. We had one batch that was overpowered by lime. Likewise, avocado size can result in too +/- salt. Too much and you'll be wishing you had 1 extra avocado!

This is my go-to recipe when making guacamole... I have to stop myself from eating the whole bowl! The only changes I've made to it were to use red onion and I add a little lemon juice in addition to the lime juice (I've never used a fresh lime - just the bottled lime juice from the store). Tastes amazing fresh, but better when you let is sit for a few hours.

Good but WAY too much cilantro. It was overpowering and I had to added 1.5 more avocados just to get it a little milder. Then we liked it. If I make this recipe again I'll cut the cilantro by  half, at least, or completely omit it.

First try making guac and this was delicious!  The yellow onions I chopped seemed to make it too oniony, but I still love it.

I love this recipe. Everything is fresh and I know my family and I are eating something healthy. I would recommend taking the seeds out from the tomatoes to prevent the guacamole from turning color too fast.

Fantastic recipe. My only suggestions are to remove the seeds from the tomatoes to reduce excess liquid, and adding 1/4 - 1/2 tsp. ground cumin seed. This takes it into savoury territory.

Will definitely make this guacamole again !  I didn't use as much salt as it called for (personal taste) and I left out the cayenne and jalapeno (also personal taste).  The fresh cilantro and tomato gave it such a great flavor.

This is a great recipe!  Like others I did not use that much salt, I added some more garlic, a little bit of regular black pepper and utilized at least twize as much cayenne pepper as mentioned.  Overall an excellent recipe!

I made a few changes to the recipe. I did not add the garlic, required salt, or Cayanne pepper. Instead I just sprinkled sea salt and added half jalapeño.  The lime was a bit strong so I think next time I will only use 1/2 a lime. Over all it was delicious my boyfriend could not stop eating it. We ate it with organic blue corn chips yum!

Living in the SW, I am able to get guac many places. Since trying this recipe nothing in a restaurant comes close to this flavor. I make it just as written with an occasional shortcut.  I use jarred minced garlic  - the kind found in the produce department, not the dehydrated stuff.  When in a pinch I have used the freeze dried cilantro, but I do prefer fresh when I can get it.  I only use the leaves, not the stems.

This is so great, my friend had given a a recipe which is very similar to this but this is better.  I made this for an appetizer hour I was doing for my husband birthday, I added some ground pepper and used red onion and did not add the crush cayenne pepper but I will next time, everyone who ate it love it.

I didn't have any cilantro, and I was skeptical because there were so few ingredients. However, it turned out very good. I will definitely make this again.

Very yummy!! I added cumin as others suggested. Didn't have fresh tomatoes but did have a can of petite diced tomatoes in my pantry and used instead, just drained and rinsed them. Also used dried cilantro instead a fresh. Definitely a hit in my house and would make again. Thank you!!

I usually don't like guacamole. I've tasted some I don't like at all and others I only tolerate. Only once have I tasted guacamole in a restaurant and really loved it. I know avocado is nutritious so I decided to find a guacamole recipe we would enjoy at home. This is it. I followed the recipe and loved it. I will make this again and again!

I love this recipe.  The only change we make is I use 4 avocados not 3.  I also find it essential that it sits overnight before serving. And don't be afraid to liberally use the cayenne pepper.

This is very similar to my recipe, so I made it as written...This is good, but mine is better.
I would specify red onions in the recipe and I add about 1 tsp of ground cumin.  I also add 1 finely chopped jalapeno.
But,  overall, if you are looking for a non-spicy good flavored guac, I would use this recipe and add 1 tsp of ground cumin!

WAY too much salt.  I never would add that much, and didn't.  The basic recipe is good without that much salt, although to cut the acidity, I browned the onions and roasted the garlic - it was delish.  Even my picky hubby who "doesn't like guac" loved it! :)

This recipe is divine! However, I did not use onions due to family allergies, and it turned out great! I left the avocado sliced until the end and then proceeded to mix the entire bowl with a fork. I don't know if it'd just be easier to mash and avocados before adding the rest of the ingredients. My guac is a big hit with the family! We like to eat them with some organic blue corn chips.

This is my go to guac recipe and I never change a thing. A useful tip from another reviewer: gut the tomatoes of all the liquid and  seeds inside so the guac doesn't get too watery. This recipe makes a lot! It's so good, I've come close to eating it all myself on multiple occasions.

Moving from Southern California to Northern California, I missed having a place where I could go to buy really good homemade guac. So I wanted to learn to make my own. Found this recipe and tried it, and it is delicious! I like the lime, but I think next time I will start with squeezing half a lime, or not try to squeeze so much of the juice out. Other than that, I don't plan to change a thing. Really great guac!!

This guac recipe is AMAZING. First time I made it, I followed the recipe to the letter with the exception of the cayenne cuz I'm sensitive to heat and I wanted to be able to enjoy this as much as everyone else!  So I've now made it probably 10-15 times and I haven't changed a thing.  It's perfect!

Delicious recipe! Everyone raved about it at the bday party I made it for. I used 5 avocados instead of three and the ratio of all the other ingredients worked. I didn't add the tomatoes since I have some tomato haters on my family (wierdos! Hahaha). Can't wait to make it again!

I'm a virgin when it comes to homemade guac, but I know good guac when I taste it and this one is gooooold (I'm still in summer Olympics mode)! I didn't change anything about the recipe, although now that I've tried it once, I may experiment a bit with the suggestions of other reviewers. The only thing I did was add one step because I have a husband who is adverse to raw onions in his food (such a little whiner!). I refused to omit this very important ingredient because it adds to the overall flavor and helps give the guac a nice texture.  So I used a trick my mom taught me which is to soak the chopped onions in water for about 20 mins. This helps to decrease the strong onion-y smell and taste. Once the chopped onion has soaked, strain it, dump it out onto a paper towel, ring it dry, and add to the guac mixture. Finally, continue on your merry way with the rest of the recipe and enjoy!

I made this according to the directions with the exception of adding the zest of my very small lime and not measuring the cilantro (lots) or onion (probably on the light side).  Excellent!  I'm not going to speak to authenticity; I just know I love this guacamole and have a tree full of avocados in the yard that will be donating quite a few of it's fruits to make more of this stuff.  Thank you for sharing!

You do not need any measurements for this wonderful recipe. Just taste as you go. The key is putting in the tomato toward the end but before the lemon and lime. You do not want to squash your tomatoes. You can either season after you've chopped the onion or after. I do after so I can taste with the onion so I don't over-season. I don't add cilantro as I feel the onion and spices add enough kick but for more spicy, go for it! Also, I do not use regular salt. I use season salt and a little at a time between tastings so make sure I don't overdue it. I feel regular salt adds too much saltiness to the dip.

Great tasting , easy making, healthy recipe. I use it as a substitute for mayo on sandwiches. I agree with the rest of the commenters in that, 1 tsbp of salt is tooooo heavy. Just throw in a pinch and double the garlic. Cilantro and avocado work so well together. Magnifique

I think this recipe calls for way to much lime. Maybe 1/2 lime juice would work better. I think this would pair really well with shrimp, (shrimp tacos maybe?).

Best I've ever eaten or made.  I blended all but one avocado and some tomato to have a smooth and chunky dish.  So good.  I forgot to put in cayenne but it was fantastic without it.  Had it on a hamburger last night and on tacos tonight.  Really easy to make. Love it.  Will be my only recipe in future.

I made this for our little get-together on July 4th and I had a couple of people tell me it was the best guac they've ever had and one person even  said they don't normally like guac but they couldn't stop eating this one! I will definitely make this again! Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent.  I reduced the salt,  increased the cilantro and used 5 small avocados instead of 4. This is a great spring board, as with other recipes small edits to personal flavor may be necessary. I also added two tablespoons of salsa. Overall simple, easy to make and delicious. New favorite.

I thought this was a awesome recipe, the salt was a little to salty, but I thought it tasted great with any kind of chip, on a sandwich or just eat it by itself. This is great for an snack, appetizer or side for a main meal!

OMG!!!! So! I'm almost 37 years old and until the past year I didn't like Guacamole. Something with avocados and the texture. So I recently started liking it and had a craving for it. For someone that doesn't even like guac they much!!! OMG!  When I tasted this I said out loud, "mmmmmmmm!  that's good!" Definitely give this recipe a try. I used red onions instead of white; didn't add cayenne (I don't like hot); and I think I added double what they call for with the cilantro. I am a salt lover, but I feel you don't need to add as much salt as they say. Probably half of that. Or perhaps a dash or to taste. The other reviewers are correct- the lime is key! Gives it a different yummy flavor. I did taste it before adding the garlic, and honestly you could go either way, with or without, and I too am a garlic lover. It tastes great even without garlic. I mashed mine with a mash potato masher :-) and it kept it the perfect consistency.Thanks for an amazing recipe!!

I make this several times a month and we always devour it!  I am always asked to bring this to parties and pitch-ins.  This is a crowd pleaser!!  I like to spice it up and always add a fair amount of cayenne pepper.  I do however scale the onion back by about half and usually use a little more garlic.

Excellent and easy to make.  I like mine with a little kick so I increased the cayenne a bit, but since that's the only real spicy ingredient this guacamole can be easily adjusted to your own taste.  Don't forget the lime juice - not only does it add a little zing to the flavor, it also helps keep the finished guacamole from turning brown.  Also, always refrigerate any leftovers and it'll be good for a day or so.

Very easy to make, after the first try the salt was a bit too much especially with salted tortilla chips, so the other tries I cut the salt in half and added more cilantro, very tasty recipe I like it very much.

It was perfect.  Made a double batch and it disappeared. Put in in the mixer so some of it was chunky.

Great recipe!!!  Now I have a hard time eating any other.  I think the key to this recipe is adding or deleting items to your personal taste.  I love lime, so I upped it.  Not a huge fan of salt, so I added a little at a time.  Thank you so much!!

Really good . Used 4 avocados, 1 and 1/2 limes, couple of pinches of paprika and cumin and salt, 1 garlic clove, cilantro just enough to get in every bite and half of a red onion. Only had cherry tomatoes on hand but still worked great. I didn't mash it too much because I like it a little chunky. Eating now and don't know if I can save some for my boyfriend later because it's so good.

Awesome!! For years I was buying Wholly Guacamole because I was too lazy to make guacamole myself. Today I decided since I love guac so much it was time to stop being lazy & make my own. This was so easy and sooooo awesome!! You will love it too!! You could skip the tomatoes if you don't like them in your guacamole. I do so I put them in and it was just right.

I needed a quick appetizer for a group that included someone who couldn't eat processed foods and this was perfect! Quick, easy, tasty and I was able to make it using only fresh produce. The only changes I made were: I used green onion instead of regular onion and only used about 1/2 tsp of salt.

The hardest part was figuring out how to pick ripe avocados at the grocery store.

I always have trouble with my guac and I know now that it is the mayo or sour cream or whatever I was adding that is not necessary. This is the best tasting recipe for guacamole that I have used, and I have made a few. I didn't change anything .  It was loved by everyone in my family and this is how I will do it from now on.

This is wonderful! I never rate anything! My only advice is only add a pinch of salt.  I used green onion instead of regular.
Fabulous with fish tacos

I make this guacamole regularly and it's always a hit!  The taste really changes depending on the type of minced garlic I use (freshly minced vs. jarred).  Both ways are really good but freshly minced is better.  But on those lazy days when I don't feel like chopping garlic and use jarred it still turns out fantastic!  I agree with other reviewers who say be careful with the salt.  I used seasoning salt once and I thought it was too salty.

This was really good guac!  I was a little nervous about making it, and I was very pleasantly surprised at how it turned out.  I did make slight modifications - a little less onion (maybe about 3/8 cup yellow onion) for my DH's preference, and only 1/2 tsp salt (I'm trying to cut back a little on salt, a little bit at a time).  I also used grape tomatoes instead of Romas, since that's what I had.  
My husband suggested a little more lime; and I think using red onion (full amount suggested in the recipe) instead of yellow onion would be good, too.
I was looking for a good guacamole recipe, and this is definitely it!  I will definitely be making this again.  Thank you!!

I make this recipe once a month at least. It is my favorite guacamole recipe of all time...restaurant or homemade. I have also used some fresh salsa when out of onion and it was still good, but the recipe as is is perfection. I never use the salt amount in a recipe. My modus operandi is to cut it in half or less. I use a pinch of sea salt or just rely on the salt from tortilla chips. Also, I would not consider myself a big cilantro fan, but I use the whole amount and fresh is a must.

I absolutely loved it! I didn't have any cayenne pepper but I did have hot sauce so I added a few drops of that and it was delicious. I also added some chopped jalapeno and pepper. If you made this recipe and found it to be bland then you didn't add enough ingredients or need to add your personal touch.

Added a half of a jalapeno and eliminated the cayene. Used the food processor to do all the work of mixing and smashing the avocados. Turned out perfect!

Super good! My husband didn't like guacamole (he never tried it) until I made this recipe. We both now LOVE it.  I really don't measure exact... I use a little less onion (hubby doesnt like them) and a little extra garlic, lime and cilantro.  I don't think you can really go wrong with this recipe. I have even used grape tomatoes instead of the plum that are called for.  Thank you for a great recipe!

I love this version...it is the gold standard in guacamole!  I substitute 1 tsp garlic powder for minced garlic & 3 TBSP Nellie & Joe key lime juice for the lime juice.  I pulse the avocado, lime juice garlic powder using the immersion blender until it is a smooth consistency.  I slice the onion and tomato using mandolin, then chop finely with a knife.  Mix all together & let sit for a couple of hours to allow flavors to meld...good stuff!

this recipe is great as is!  I was nervous about the cayenne making it too spicy for me, but 2 shakes really add to the flavor without making too hot.  I am someone who thinks avocados are pretty blah on their own, but can't get enough of this guac recipe!

Delicious!! I doubled the recipe to take to a Cinco De Mayo party and everyone loved it. I only made one change,  instead of adding cayenne pepper I added two small  jalapeno's without seeds chopped finely.

First time ever trying guacamole, had no idea what to expect. I hate cilantro so used fresh parsley instead and kept it chunky. It's so yummy! I've made it a couple of times now!

We doubled the salt, used two limes, and 2 pinches of pepper with a red onion.  It was gone in 30 minutes.  A definite WINNER in this household!

Seriously the best guacamole I've ever made or had.  So fresh!   I upped the cilantro because I didn't feel like measuring it and we LOVE cilantro.   I also used the optional pinch of cayenne for a little kick.  The onion I used was a red onion because it's what I had on hand.  I also LOVE red onion in certain recipes and often use it.
Other than that, I really just followed the recipe.  That's it.  I can't see where using red onion and adding a bit more cilantro changed this recipe by much, if at all.
THIS will be my go to guacamole  recipe from now on !
Thanks Bob Cody for sharing this recipe :-)

This guacamole was delicious! However I think two limes is just too much. Next time I will only use one. I had to add eat with a little sour cream to help kill the lime flavor. Will make again!

This is a good base recipe for the ingredients that need to go into a good guacamole but the ratios are waaaay off. First of all, I'm not sure how that is only 4 servings. I was making this for a potluck of about 20 people so I tripped the recipe. I ended up with a massive salad bowl almost full. I only needed to bring half to the potluck! And 1 tsp of salt to three avocados? Again, in my tripled recipe I only used 1 tsp so I can't imagine how salty that would be with only three avocados... If you plan to make this, I'd say max 1/2 tsp for the original recipe and it would likely serve at least 10 people. This isn't a meal, it's a snack or an appetizer!

With a few alterations to suit our tastes, this is great!  Everyone goes nuts over it!  First I've replaced the minced garlic with garlic powder.  Second, the onion and tomato individually have need replaced with a batch of fresh Pico De Gallo (the local store has some fantastic hand made stuff) and I add in the juice from the Pico as well to re-hydrate the garlic power.  We prefer to make larger (2x or 3x) sized batches of the goods - it does seem the larger the batch the better the flavor...  And, lastly, there is _nothing_ wrong with making it 2 or 3 days in advance!  To store it, pour it into a storage container with a tight lid but, cover the top of your green goo with plastic wrap, right down on top of it and all the way to the edges, getting all the air out.  Lid up and put in the cold box!  We always make it at least a day in advance but more if we have time!

Highly recommended! This was absolutely yummy! This is my first time making guacamole so I scaled the recipe down to 1 avocado so that if I didn't like it, I could just toss it. Now I wish I made double the recipe, it was so good I couldn't stop eating it! Never even made it to the refrigerator. I'll be making a heap of this again and will chill first for an hour as instructed, I'm sure it will taste even better! I did not omit any ingredient but I did lessen the salt a bit and added just a dash of pepper.

First time making guacamole and it was astonishing! Would highly recommend to apply cayenne pepper, even though the recipe said it's optional. The cayenne pepper make a big different.

No need to look for another Guac recipe ever. This is my go to that I will share with all. I used 4 gloves of garlic and a little more red onions than the recipe called for bc I'm obsessed with garlic and onions and can never get enough :) the flavor was definitely better when you mix it all up and let it soak in the flavors in the fridge. I only put it in the fridge for about 30 minutes before I started eating it and it was amazing.

I've never made guacamole before myself, though I love it to bits.  I used less than  half the salt the recipe called for (somewhere between 1/4 and 1/2 tsp) and it was plenty.  I also used chopped shallot instead of onion.  Despite those minor changes the end result was delicious and went great with tacos that night.

This recipe was amazing. I have never made guacamole before but I decided to give it a try since it is a family favorite. I made it exactly as it written and it was a huge hit. By the end, my family was scraping the bowl. Thank you for posting this recipe. Will definitely be making this one again.

I omitted the onions and added a whole tomato instead. And only half the amount of salt,. I did use 3 avocados, next time I will use 4 because 3 didn't seem like enough.  Tastes great! It was my first attempt at making guac.

I used 4 avocados and used my homemade pickled ghost peppers along with homemade cayenne/italian/jalapeños dehydrated flakes .
And since I think cilantro taste like vomit i used chive and parsley . 
So yeah i didn't really do the recipe apparently but it was my base and i love it.

I love this recipe.  I use 4 avocados, a medium tomato, seeded and chopped, 1/2 cup of cilantro and a lot more lime juice because I like it tangy!  I get a lot of compliments and have passed this recipe on to a half a dozen friends at least!!

The salt made this almost too salty to eat, especially if your chips have salt too. Otherwise the flavors are good, maybe a little less cilantro too. Next time I will completely omit the salt.

This was the first time I've ever made guacamole and I followed the directions exactly.  It was awesome ... the best I've ever tasted!  Hubby agrees with me.  Definitely a "keeper."

I made to the exact recipe.  Way to much cilantro for us. I was able to get a small amount without cilantro and its was fabulous. I will make again and omit the cilantro

I live in Cali and have guac all different ways. This one is so easy with fresh ingredients and the proportion of flavors is perfect. BOMB!!  Just make sure you use ripe avocados.

I eliminated the cayenne pepper, only because my mouth can't tolerate it, but I followed the rest of the recipe to a tee.  It's my first guacamole and it was so easy. I'll definitely do it again -- soon!!!

I love this recipe & am always asked to bring the guacamole now!  I use the recipe as a guideline for how much of everything I should add but I adjust depending on taste and it always turns out great! 
Take the advice of other reviewers and only add salt to taste!

This guacamole is fantastic. I had two avocados that were ready to use  however I did not have any fresh tomatoes,  limes or cilantro. So I decided to open a can of diced tomatoes and rinsed them real well and used some dried cilantro and some bottled lime juice. All the other ingredients I had on hand. Mixed them all together and let me tell you, it was fantastic. I did refrigerate for one our before using.

Be careful on the quantity of lime juice... don't want to make it too runny. Add a little at a time to suit preferred consistency.

Made it with my own portion measurements for one avacado and loved it! I'll taste it in 1 hour  to see if the flavor I just enjoyed is even better. This was absolutely delicious with the touch of lime.

The amount of salt the recipe calls for made it too salty.  Made another batch, the week after and cut the salt down to 1/4 teaspoon.  Much better!

I liked it, but apparently my husband and daughter didn't.  It's sitting at our Super Bowl spread getting all brown on top- I'm the only one who has touched it.  I think it's yummy. I added a bit of seeded jalapeno to it.  Not spicy at all.  Avocados are super creamy and it was so pretty til it started turning.  Guess I'll wrap it up tight and put it back in the fridge.

This is the best guacamole I have ever tasted. My husband and son agree. I did feel that it was a bit too limey so I added a 4th avocado. Also I omitted the tomatoes because my son hates them. Such a great Super Bowl food!

This will be my guacamole recipe for many years to come! It has wonderful flavor and it looks beautiful. The first time I made it I got every last drop of juice out of my lime and the guacamole was a bit too lime-y. Now when I make it I tend to go a little easier on the lime juicing(but I still use 1 lime)  and it is perfection!! AND because there is so much lime, it can stay out at a party and keep all its beautiful colors. This is the dreamboat of guacamoles.

Excellent, fresh guacamole! It was hard not to eat it all the first night. This was my first attempt at guac. Took me more than ten minutes, but I'm not a seasoned cook. I cut back just a bit on the salt and put the pits in to keep it fresh for tomorrow (does this work?).

I had to use about 2 tbs of fresh salsa instead of Roma tomatoes because I was out, but it still tastes amazing! I also cut down on the salt as recommended by other reviews to 1/2 teaspoon.  Best guacamole I've ever made with those adjustments.

This is by far the best guacamole recipe there is. I have been making this for a few years now and it never fails. It is ate up well before it can expire. I actually started making a double batch when I do make it. Thanks for such a great and simple recipe. My family and I love it. It's always the simple recipes that are the best.

Yummy :)  This recipe is awesome !!!!  
I made it to go with chicken quesadillas and it was a huge hit with all my family.  For a little more of a kick I added 1 fresh jalapeno pepper, we love the extra spice.  This guacamole recipe is  definitely a keeper and will be used every time we crave some.  Thank you :)

I've made guac before, with, usually, poor results, this recipe is, however, fantastic.  Easy to make, simple ingredients, enough acid to keep it from turning brown, just salt enough to add flavor without being overpowering, great cilantro flavor, and just enough tomato go give it some color.   When you store it, put some plastic wrap right on top of the guac to keep the air off.   I add a few(+) dashes of hot sauce when time to serve.

Delicious and easy to prepare,  I added a chopped jalapeño in place of the cayenne, also omitted the tomatoes just because I
forgot to get them.  Am using the leftovers for the base for chicken wraps tonight!

This was my first time making guacamole and it was a hit!! I added diced fresh jalapeños (seeded) and a smidget of olive oil...then I seasoned it to taste. It was to die for after being refrigerated for a bit!!

Excellent. My fiancé loved it and was impressed! He's a big fan of guacamole. His only suggestion he had was to add extra lime.  I did put the onion, cillantro and tomato in the food processor separately so they wouldn't be too chunky.  Great recipe. Thank you!

Delicious. So easy. To keep it from turning brown super fast, I put a layer of plastic wrap directly on top of he quac and then a layer on top of the bowl itself.

I love this guacamole. I did not have a ripe tomato, so I left it out and I only had lemons, so I used that instead of the lime. This is delicious, and I will make it again. I will use grape tomatoes next time. Oh, and I only used 1/2 tsp of the salt, and it was perfect.

Added 1/2 tsp. Cumin and omitted lime. We like the sting, zip and color of red onion instead of white. Garlic must be minced fresh-no jarred stuffed. We mix it all with the same chef knife used on ingredients and as we "fold" in ingredients with the knife we get the perfect consistency of creamy and chunky...my m.i.l. taught me that trick. Leave pit in the guacamole and press Saran Wrap flat against to completely seal out air that can turn it brown.

First time making guac, although I love it, and this recipe was great! I only used 1 avocado and scaled everything else down.  Perfect and definitely a keeper!

We make almost the same but never measure anything out, as salt is always by taste .
We also make our own chips from tortillas we cut up and bake with EVOO and salt.
There in never enough made so good.

I tweaked this recipe a bit, adding juice of 1 lemon instead of 1 lime.    I put chili powder, instead of cayenne pepper.   And no tomato, since I get bad heartburn from tomatoes.   It turned out GREAT.   My husband LOVED it!

I made this recipe to a T.   I found it tasted good, but needed something else like cumin to make it over the top. I will be using it again, but I will be adding something to improve the flavor.

Best I have ever had! I live in Canada and you don't see it that often here but this is awesome. 
One negative thing to comment on, I am going broke buying avocados
Also for best results use overly ripe tomatoes (to the point of the skin starting to wrinkle) and very ripe avocados.

This the second time I have made this recipe.  I use no salt due to a family member's dietary restriction, and no cilantro for another's dislike of that flavor.   It is still our favorite guacamole recipe.   With fresh avocados it is a delightful bright flavorful taste.

DELICIOSO!! Better than a lot of Mexican restaurants. Great base recipe to play with according to your taste. I left out the tomato (I used red onion to give it color) and cayenne. I used bottled lime juice. But added cumin and fresh jalapeno.

I used more cilantro than suggested and added chopped green onions. I didn't put in the cayenne pepper and definitely missed out. I should have smashed the avocado more before adding the rest of the ingredients.

My mom went to Philadelphia so I had to make me and my dad dinner. I usually make quesadillas so I wanted something Mexican to go with them. The recipe calls for way to much salt, so I cut it down to half a teaspoon. I would actually recommend no salt at all if the chips you use are very salty, like mine. I also used cherry tomatoes instead of plum tomatoes and a little less garlic. Best guac ever! So much better the Chipotle and Taco Bell.

My second time making it this week!! I don't like avocados on their own, but can eat guac all day!! Plus it's healthy. Recipe is amazing & easy. This time around I used fresh garlic instead of dry minced. Just wish we had access to fresh cilantro; guess I'll plant some in the house.

Funny thing - I cannot pass up a ripe avocado when in a supermarket. Sometimes it changes my whole dinner plans!

This is a great recipe. I agree with one other commenter to add a bit of olive oil for a more silky texture. I also like to add a bit of chopped jalapeno to the mix.

Only question now is what do I need to change to work this into tonight's menu!

This is my go to guacamole recipe.  I've made this so many times in the past few years and has become one of our regulars.  I didn't change a thing other than omitting the cayenne pepper because I don't like the heat.  Highly recommend.

The only thing I would change is a little less salt.  I'm a HUGE salt fan but I thought it was a little too much especially given that most tortilla chips are also salted.  Cut back the salt to a 1/2 t.  ...possilby even bump up the cayenne pepper... Otherwise, fantastic recipe!!!

This is the perfect guacamole combo,I used 4 1/2 large ripe avocados and bought a fresh made 7oz package of Pico De Gallo(which is basically diced tomatoes and onions and cilantro) instead of chopping it all.I omitted the pepper(spicy stuff not in our diet)Perfect every time,ty for sharing this perfect recipe!

This is my personal go-to guac recipe; it's fast, simple, and a hit at parties - my husband's coworkers demand it every meal night! Recommendation: replace or supplement cayenne with fresh jalapenos, minced.

I have made it multiple times and it is the best guacamole recipe ... love the chunky easy to dip consistency.  I have made it with red onions or sweet yellow onions.  Great either way.

I had gotten a big bag of ripe avocados on sale and needed to use them up, so I decided to make this recipe for a party. My challenge was that the party was a three hour drive away. So I left the avocados whole and unpeeled, and mixed all the other ingredients with lime juice in a big lidded bowl. When I arrived to the party, I just peeled and pitted all the avocados and mashed and mixed it on the spot. Everyone really enjoyed it, and the veggies were really flavorful from marinating in the citrus juice! Great recipe, nice ingredient proportions!

I loved it. Only reason i gave it a four was because there was way too much salt. Plus i didnt use as much onion or tomato. But all the flavors were delicious. I definately recommend adding half the salt first and taste.

It's not the best I've had but it's a good base recipe. Maybe it's because guacamole is like homemade salsa, it's very subjective to taste based on individual preference.

I made a double batch but used only 1 and 1/4 tsp of salt and doubled all other ingredients.  It came out great you can taste how fresh all the ingredients are and everything complements each other so well! I don't think i will ever eat store bought guacamole again!!

First I have to say too much salt, I only added 1/2 tsp. BUT let me just say this is the best guacamole I have ever made! Wow, I hope I don't eat the entire bowl before my husband gets home...lol. Awesome, awesome recipe! I only gave it a 4 star because of the salt, but if you only use a 1/2 tsp it will be a 10!!

I have made this recipe over and over and it is always raved about! Everyone loves it! The only change that I make is that I use diced green onions. They seem to add to the freshness of this recipe. I serve with white and blue Tostitos for a different presentation! Thank you for sharing this wonderful go-to recipe!

It was a decent recipe but not outstanding . I've tried one that had  garlic powder in it but was similar. I liked this one second to that other recipe. Wish I hadn't lost the first.

This was good.  The lime however was overpowering the guac, so I next time I make this I will use 1/2 to 3/4 of the lime juice.  Also, the cayenne needed more kick so I added an additional pinch. I originally left out the salt, but decided it definitely needs some to bring out the fresh garlic flavor so I added 6 turns of my sea salt grinder. I will also add more cilantro next time as we both love cilantro. It's a matter of preference & my fiance was my taste tester & after a few modifications from the original recipe, he agreed this was good.

Fantastic and easy recipe. Made it 30 minutes before a team event and everyone loved it. Probably could have let the flavors meld a little longer before serving, but it was a crowd pleaser.

very good recipe!  have struggled making guacamole until I used this recipe.  to make it easy I used the chopped tomato/onion/cilantro blend from the store and used lemon as I prefer to lime.  Yummy!

It was good but I'm still looking for the perfect guacamole recipe.  Perhaps the juice from a whole lime was too much.  It turned out a little wet. I'd like it to be more creamy. But the spices were a good balance and the tomato and onion proportions were good. I think I'll add another half tomato and a half an avocado or less lime juice next time.

this recipe is incredible.  Two important points, the recipe does not make clear what kind of onion to use but I always use red onion.  Also, you should really pit the tomatoes to keep the guac from getting too watery.  AMAZING RECIPE!!

I think this is the best guacamole recipe here I just want to warn people though use half a lime first I used a whole lime like the recepe and being a new member of the kitchen it was too sour! I like sour but this was overwhelming all the other flavors. Still great tasting though I will definitely stick to this recipe and adjust the lime level next time 
Happy eating!

GREAT RECIPE!!  My first time making guacamole and this recipe was perfect!  I modified the recipe for my taste -- used only 1 clove of garlic, removed the "insides" from the tomatoes before dicing, and did not add the cayenne. I made it for a Sunday School party and everyone loved it!

I absolutely LOVE this recipe! The first time I made it I didn't have fresh tomatoes, so I substituted salsa instead. I actually loved it so much with the salsa, that I make it this way now! (It gives it an added flavor!) Everyone LOVES this recipe and always asks for the recipe when I bring it parties! I highly recommend!!

This was outstanding! Will be my go to from now on! Love all the fresh flavors, and I like mine a little on the "chunky" side. I did add a diced jalapeño instead of the cayenne and used a red onion. Just AWESOME!

This is the first time I have ever made guacamole. I really enjoy the fresh made guacamole at the Mexican restaurants, so I thought I would male some for the 4th on July cookout.  I had people who don't like guacamole eating this recipe!  The one change that I made was, I only used half the salt.  The flavor was amazing.  Next time I have to make a double batch.

Not bad but skip the tomatoes. Whenever making anything Mexican I use of powdered cumin and a dash of quality olive oil.

This has become a favorite for my Paramedic daughter and her teammates.  I know when she wants it because there is a beg a avocados on the kitchen island.  She doesn't like tomato so I use 1/4 c. picante sauce.

Wowzers, this is some good stuff!  Hubby was wandering around looking for snacks and I had avocados so there you go.  I had to use dried cilantro and green onions and grape tomatoes, but it was great anyway.  I also didn't make it spicy because it was late at night, but the amounts on everything are great.  No flavor overpowers the other and that's the way it should be!

This just the Best! Only changes - my family preferences add more garlic and lime.  If I can't get "good" fresh tomatoes I have used canned diced. Sometimes I add 1/4 tsp cumin as others suggested. I add avocados last to make sure they stay chunky.

A whole lime was a little too much. I will try using only half a lime next time and add to taste. Otherwise, a great recipe that is easy to make and delicious!

Bland as written. I added extra garlic, a jalapeño pepper, extra lime and let it meld overnight. My husband and I were both shocked at how tasteless it was. I've just added tsp onion  powder , garlic powder and cumin in the hopes of improving it.  I think I'll continue buying my quac at Costco.  Thank you for sharing.  Just to much work for  something that bland.

The recipe was very good although I personally preferred less onion. I would reduce the onion measurement to 1/4 cup the next time I make this dish. This recipe was definitely the best by far. My family loved it!

I actually didnt get to have very much of this because my friends ate it all up so quickly! They were all very surprised at how good it was and it was the most popular thing at the picnic (maybe tied with the quinoa lasangna though). The only change I did was i used half a teaspoon of salt instead of a whole teaspoon. And i used four avocados (but they were really small). I dont know if I could've added more salt because I barely got any! This recipe is wonderful. I will make it for all future potlucks.

We loved it. Here is a tip not to much onion add less or the taste of onion will be to strong. It is great for appies and entertaining. I am tired of buying the expensive store bought stuff that does not taste over the top.

This is the best guacamole I've tasted ! I tried this recipe one week ago as an aperitif with friends and the result was perfect! The taste is very good and my guests greatly enjoyed. I love this recipe because it is fresh and easy to do.

The texture is very creamy.This guacamole is both fresh and spicy which is very pleasant to taste.I did it taste to a friend who does not crazy about spices and garlic but he really appreciates. I like serving it with little crackers and it's a delight ! I love cooking and for me,this recipe is simple but still provides a good effect! It can be prepared in 5 minutes if there are unexpected guests !

I don't hesitate to do it again at the next opportunity ! ;)

We all like guacamole served in different ways, like varying amounts of salt, lime juice, tomatoes and onions. I use this recipe with a less salt and I use lime juice to taste. Every time I make guacamole, I use this recipe. It never fails and I'm always happy with the result. :)

The lime juice works perfectly with the proportion of avocados, tomatoes, and onions.  I added a 1/2 teaspoon of salt.

By far my favorite guacamole recipe, it is fresh and tastes really good. I used all the ingredients but added a bit more salt and cayenne pepper (it gives it a nice kick!) I also only used 1 tomato since I'm not a huge tomato fan. It came out really good and tasted even better after refrigerated, I will definitely be making this again it's a great appetizer.

This was my first attempt at guacamole and it was really delicious. I did cut the salt back as some reviewers suggested. I also used red onion and added just a little finely chopped jalapeño. It was perfect! I will definitely make it again.

Good, solid base recipe that is easy to customize to your family's taste. I ended up using about a 1/3rd cup fresh salsa (drained) instead of the tomatoes and part of the onion (mine were bad) and used a bit more cilantro. This recipe really lets the few ingredients shine.  We will have again.

We were going to a guacamole contest party, and I had never made guacamole before.  I used this exact recipe but then added Costco's Mango Salsa into the guacamole (approx. 4 big spoonfuls). Out of 15 guacamole recipes we tied for first.  I did add the cayenne pepper.  It was sweet and delicious.

I substituted lemon juice for the lime since I didn't have any on hand. Instead of hand mashing and chopping I used my Ninja Master Prep Food Processor and enjoyed a creamy, flavorful guacamole. Delicious!

Too salty with a full teaspoon - will definitely make again, with less salt because otherwise it was delicious

So yummy!  I didn't really measure anything, but I think I was pretty close to the amounts in the recipe.  It was really delicious, very similar to my favorite restaurant guacamole.  I also didn't mash the guacamole, just cut it into small chunks and mixed it all together, so it got a little mashed up but still had chunks of guacamole.  I will definitely be making this again!

Unbelievably fresh to DEATH!!!  I just downloaded Allrecipies this afternoon, this is the first recipe I've tried making that I found on here, and it's my first go at making homemade  guacamole.  I don't know if it could have turned out any better than it did, this recipe is PERFECT!!!  Now onto this evening's main course that I found on here,  "Easiest Spicy Cod" with a few sides of Corona Extra.  THANKS ALLRECIPIES!!!

So good!  I only used 2.5 avocados b/c that is what I had and only did one clove of garlic b/c I didn't want it to overpower the avocado taste.  Used a tad less salt and half a lime.  Turned out great.

I rarely made guacamole the last 40+ years.  I was recently having a Chipotle style dinner and decided to make some.  Wow, was this recipe good.  In the last two months I've made it at least six times.  Everyone who tries it just loves it.  Thanks for sharing a real gem of a recipe.

Perfect guacamole recipe!! I made it tonight to go with tacos and my husband (who is a bit of guacamole snob) couldn't get enough of it!! The key is to get nice ripe avocados. We ordered guacamole at our local Mexican place two weeks ago that was made table side and this was way better!! Thanks for a great recipe!!! This will definitely be my go-to for guacamole recipes from now on

Delicious!  I adjusted the measurements slightly for 2 avocados, instead of 3.  Also added a couple of dashes of Cumin (personal taste).  Thank you for posting.

This was, as everyone else has said, amazing. I didn't add any chilli and loved it just as it was. I reduced the salt to 1/2 a teaspoon and used red onion, finely chopped. Definitely a make again guac.

Wow, this recipe was perfect!  I added probably about 1/2 tsp of salt, but otherwise didn't change a thing.  I have tried many different guacamole recipes, but I was surprised that this one really is a standout recipe!

I more or less doubled the recipe, but didn't quite double the onion. I subbed 1 tbsp. of dried cilantro for the 3 tbsp fresh, and 1/4 tsp. dehydrated minced garlic for the 1tsp fresh minced garlic. Even though I didn't have fresh cilantro or garlic on hand, it's the best guacamole I've ever tasted. I plan to make this again to bring to a potluck next week.

Use a blender and omit the tomatoes!! I made it two times; once with the tomatoes and once without. Without was by far, so much better!

Very simple! Delicious ! Added too much lime juice and salt... Maybe the avocados were small? Will adjust down a little.

This guacamole is wonderful. It was too salty so the only changes I made was using 6 avocados instead of 3 and we love garlic so I add a little more.

I found this recipe to be perfect just the way it is, not a thing needs to be changed. The Cayenne pepper should be a staple not an option. My family loved it.

This recipe is awesome. I did little changes according to my Taste.They are..

1. I'm not a big fan of sour taste so I added only one tomato and juice of half a lime.

2. I put onions, tomato and cilantro leaves in the chopper and chopped it till it looked like grated.

3. I too added some green chili.

 I loved my guacamole .... :)

It was ok. I added two cloves of garlic which gave it a little umph! I think I will try using the food processor next time for a slightly smoother consistency.

Fantastic stuff!  I tweaked it a little bit (used a combination of spring and red onions, a bit of Tabasco Chipotle hot sauce, a dash of Maggi seasoning, a pinch of oregano and cumin), but the basic recipe is fabulous!

I moved to Australia 3 years ago, and love the 'cuisine', if I may call it that:  a mixture of South Asian, Indonesian, Indian and bush tucker, very fresh, with lots of chillies!  This fits right in, as it can be tweaked and turned to Mexican, Thai, whatever.  Wonderfully flexible!

As far as cost goes:  I got 3 overripe avocados on special for 2 AUD today ($1.80 US?) and the cilantro probably cost 0.70 AUD (60c US?), so the dip costs about what a jar of pre-prepared guacamole does in the super, but it's much better!  :-)

Thank you!!!

Great recipe! A few additions since I like it a little spicier, I added a chopped jalepeño and a few sprinkles of cumin.  It gives a deeper more authentic taste.  Delicious!!

Yummmy!! I did halve the salt and added olive oil. And instead of cayenne i minced some serrano pepper. The serrano is spicy but not burn your mouth spicy. This is a must have with Margaritas.

Followed the recipe as it was but it seemed that something was missing, let it sit overnight and then tried again, still missing something. I checked some of the reviews that were out there for this so I added some cumin, that did help but I've had better, then a little more salt and some lemon juice this time. This made it better but not up to our standards, sorry. So my daughter and I both give it a 3.

Everything was fantastic except for the salt. I would cut the salt down to one fourth the amount. If you like it saltier you can always add more. But I had to double all the rest of the ingredients and it still tasted too salty to me and my husband.

This guacamole was so good and easy to make.  I didn't have any limes or fresh cilantro. I used lemon juice and freeze dried cilantro and it was still good.

This recipe is amazing and I like that it doesn't call for canned tomatoes. This recipe has become a household favorite. It's our go to recipe for guacamole. It's easy and doesn't call for a lot of ingredients.

I am not a fan of roma tomatoes.  I used grape tomatoes. VERY GOOD! I don't think cherry tomatoes would work.   One time I accidentally forgot the cilantro and I liked it just as well without the cilantro.  I also found that it didn't matter between fresh garlic or garlic powder, but fresh is always better.  I used my blender, just threw all ingredients in. 

TRY THIS ON A TRISCUIT CRACKER!!!!!!!!!

Best guacamole I have ever tasted!! I got many compliments and everyone asked for the recipe! However I would recommend to not go crazy with the cilantro, the taste can get a little strong but that maybe just my personal preference.

I added this recipe to my "Recipe Box" in February, 2012 in the event my jars of premixed Guacamole Spice I carried to Costa Rica became non-usable. Despite being seal, the humidity here was just too much.  This recipe was a tremendous suprise!  It was as good, perhaps better than those jars of premixed stuff.  The only chages i made was using Costa Rica's "Cayote Cilantro" and removing the core and seeds from the Roma Tomatoes before dicing. I will never buy that other stuff again!

I would make this recipe again. It has almost everything I like in guacamole. I added some jalapeños to spice it up a little bit. I am still searching on the best way to mash the avocados while bringing all the ingredients together because texture is key for a good guac

My first time making Guacamole.  It was very easy and turned out great!  I liked it better than the Guac served at my favorite Mexican Restaurant. I forgot the cayenne pepper, but it really didn't need it and I could have easily added it later.

This recipe is fabulous!  I did modify it slightly though. I don't particularly care for cilantro, so I omitted that and instead added two jalapeño peppers, finely chopped. Yum!!

The only complaint about this recipe is that the preparation time was definitely longer than listed (maybe I am just really bad at cutting things). But it was delicious!

This is my second time making the recipe. I usually use half of a lemon - because I use organic and the flavor is extra intense, as compared to regular store-bought lemons. I had seen a variety of reviews from others stating that they had used cumin. I didn't have cumin on its own, but I did have a curry blend that primarily contained cumin. The added middle-eastern flare definitely improved the flavor. I believe this recipe is highly flexible. Don't be afraid to experiment!

Excellent!  I used a bit more lime juice because I like it with a slightly tarter flavor, but otherwise this is a fabulous recipe that is quick and easy to make.

We really like this recipe.  It's quick and easy to make.  I've made it with and without garlic or cilantro (ran out), yellow onions and red onions.  The amount of salt and lime is just fine as well.  If I want the guacamole more thick, I seed the tomatoes.  If I want it a little more thin, I keep the seeds.

Delicious!  Substituted fresh parsley for the fresh cilantro (I don't care for cilantro), and it was yummo!  Best guacamole I've ever had.  This recipe is a keeper! :)

Great basic recipe, except other reviewers are right, it is too salty. Cut back to at least 1.2 the amount of salt and you'll be good.

I made this exactly per the recipe and it was marvelous!  I've never made Guacamole before - actually I've only tasted it once or twice - but this was delicious and my company went through it in a very short time!  I will be making this again - many times - a sure-fire hit!!

This recipe makes the finest guacamole ever!  When I served this at a recent potluck, it was gone before the event even started, people just couldn't stop eating it.  I did cut back on the salt (personal preference) but the rest of the recipe is spot-on perfect.  The kicker of the recipe is the cilantro, I may add a Tbsp more the next time I make it.  A definite keeper recipe!
Added: I have been making this recipe for two years now and have found that a tsp of cumin and 1/2-1 tsp of smoked coriander seed takes this over the top!  And yes, the added cilantro is amazing.  Simple a great recipe and very adaptable.  This is the recipe I will use for many years to come!

My first try at making Guacamole and I used this recipe. Fantastic! I did not have the cilantro at the time but the garlic made up for that. I also used a Vidalia onion which added some sweet. 1/2 the salt too. I may add more cayenne next time.

I have this saved in my favorites. It's the only recipe for guacamole that I and my 4yo absolutely love. Even my husband, who doesn't care for guacamole will sneak a few chips. I add about half the amount of salt though and substitute the lime for a lemon. Put all but tomatoes in the stand mixer and blend with a lid slowly. Fold tomatoes in as you place it in the serving container. Best ever!

Mmmm! Great flavour, texture (like it chunky), super fast to toss together and the flavour was GREAT. I didn't even add the garlic this time. Cayenne is a great touch!!  This was supposed to be an app for my dinner tonight ... but it is quickly becoming my whole dinner :)

This is one of my favorite recipes and the best guacamole. We make it every couple weeks and I have the recipe memorized. I like to chunk the avocado as opposed to smash it. When hot peppers are in season I substitute the ground cheyenne with diced fresh hot peppers. Also, I usually put in half the lime, taste test it, then add more if needed.

So good!  This was my first time making guacamole, and this recipe is a keeper.  I added a little cumin & minced jalapeno (personal preference) but would love it either way.

This was great!  The only thing I will do different next time is add less salt.  I ate this over an hour ago and still taste salt in my mouth.  I didn't let it sit for an hour, however, I don't know how it could have tasted any better.  I ran out of minced garlic, so I sprinkled some garlic powder.  I also used red onion because it's all I had.  This is so much better than those seasoning packets...and even minus the MSG. :)

Made this for bookclub 3/20/2013 - good.  Used canned tomatoes - might be better with fresh. Used jarred garlic and used a bit too much.  Powdered garlic might be better.

I made this recipe for a family dinner and then again for a gathering of girlfriends - it was a huge hit with both parties!  I followed the recipe as directed (with a bit more garlic!), and it was delicious - will definitely be making again and again.  Thanks for sharing!

I have never made guacamole before.  All I can say is OMG!  This was amazing.  I know that they said to leave it in the fridge for an hour.  It was so GOOD, that I couldn't.  Amazing, and so easy. I invite anyone to try to make guacamole any better, restaurants invited.

Similar to mine though I prefer the flavor of red onion and not to add the tomatoes.
Always use fresh ingredients for the best results, thanks.

First time making this recipe and already making alterations, lol. I like the chunk and it definitely works better with ripe Haas avocados. I added green pepper, ground pepper, used 1/2 of a lemon instead of lime for 2 avocados, Frank's red hot sauce and 1/2 a jalapeño minced (We love spice!) and it was pretty good. Placed it on top of a warm tostada spread with Pace's Jalapeño and Pepper Jack dip, some grilled chicken mixed with black beans and topped with mexican cheese blend, and Ta Da, one heck of a meal.

This is the best guacamole of all time!  I made a few adjustments according to my taste.  First, I just about pureed my half onion in a blender (would work in a food processor too).  I don't like the texture of raw onion, and this prevented any tears from being shed.  I just wanted that fresh flavor.

I put in a little extra garlic, a little extra lime juice, and one extra tomato -- just the way I like it.  I also mashed only half of the avocados and cubed the other half to have a chunky (more avocado-y tasting) consistency.  Five stars like this!  

You may need an extra avocado if yours are on the puny side or have plenty of dark spots (better to buy four).  Left out cayenne pepper and cilantro.  Threw in one jalapeno, diced, and seeded for extra zing.  Perfect.

This recipe was very good. I halfed the ingredients as I was cooking only for two and did not want to over make the guacamole as it tends to turn brown when it sits for too long. To add a little extra zing, I added a jalapeno pepper (chopped) and I added some cumin. I also added a little extra cilantro. I did not find this recipe too salty as others did. I shall make this again in the future.

Best guacamole ever for sure. However, 1 teaspoon of salt is just WAY too much. Also, I only squeezed half of the lime, and didn't add pepper. Use like 1/2 tsp of salt of even less than that. My parents said it was the best guac they've ever had :)

AMAZING!!! One of my favorite things to make on allrecipes! My husband and his family were really impressed and absolutely loved it! I, myself am not a huge guacamole fan and I love it too!! I have already made it quite a few times in a few months. Try this recipe!! I don't make any modifications, other then adding additional cilantro at my husband's request. LOVE IT!

Simply awesome just as written.  And a hint about keeping the guacamole green is to save the pit and put it in the dip when storing.

A few minor changes for my taste. Too salty and not enough kick.
1/4 teaspoon or less of salt and add 1 diced jalapeño.  Add cilantro to top for those who don't like it or love it (me).
I like it chunky 8-)

I liked mine a little smoother in texture so first I combined all the ingredients in a big bowl, and then I added them little by little into my small processor and the result was delicious. Will take a lot of restraint to not eat the whole thing!

This is by far the BEST guacamole recipe I have ever tried!!!!  It is flavourful, and really easy to make.  Everyone that has tried it absolutely raves about it.  I use a 1/2 teaspoon of Franks Red Hot Sauce in lieu of the cayenne pepper, it really rounds out the flavour.  Definately try this recipe!!!

The onions needed to be sautéed before added to Guacamole in my opinion or else all you taste is onion. Once that change was made, it was good

This is a good, basic recipe for guacamole.  I agree you have to adjust the cilantro and lime to your taste.  I didn't think the tsp of salt was too much at all and I really think that has to do with the avocados as well.  Some just need that little extra salt to bring out the flavor and some don't.  I added a little more than a "pinch" of cayenne because it's one of my favorites and it adds the perfect kick to just about anything.  I feel this needs to set for at least 3 hours though to really get the flavors to meld.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks for sharing!

I've made this recipe (sometimes doubling it) several times.  It is always a big hit with my guests.  Thanks Bob.  

I should mention 2 minor changes I made-
1) I used half the salt.
2) Since I'm using lime juice from a bottle, I start with 2 tablespoons and then keep adding to taste.  I think the last time I made it, I used 3.5 tablespoons.

Lime, cilantro, and salt are absolute essentials to perfect guacamole, and this recipe incorporates them generously.  Delicious!  This will be my go-to guacamole recipe from now on.  I did notice that the tomatoes softened to unfavorable texture after being stored in the refrigerator for over 24 hours.  I would recommend omitting the tomatoes if you expect to store leftovers.

fabulously addicting!! Used less salt and an extra lime, but I always use less salt, you can always add more...but can't take it away!! ..and 1 less tomato..in case the juice made it too watery..It's perfect..we love it!! Used red onion and fresh parsley..not cilantro..as we don't like it. Awesome recipe!!

I use to buy the package mix and add tomatoes for my guac.  I actually thought it was pretty good until trying this recipe.  I've had people who say they don't like it and when they try it they can't seem to stop eaating it.  Now I'm always asked to bring it to functions.  I do add a diced jalapeno.

Great to have the fresh ingredients, but ALL my friends use simple pre-made salsa, avacado, a few simple spices and theirs is 5 Star.  I love fresh ingredients and I love to cook...so I was a little frustrated that it was just "good" and not "the best"

This was my first time making Guacamole because my dad makes it the best and I was afraid mine wouldn't be as good. Well it was GREAT! I love the pinch of cayenne. Also, I put in black pepper out of habit as I didn't realize it wasn't part of the recipe. It was still great. I also added the zest of one lime because I wanted more of a lime flavor and had already doubled the amount of lime juice. My guests kept commenting on how good it was. They went through 2 bags of chips!

Awesome!!! Took this to a potluck and it was the first thing gone! Everyone loved it. The only change I made was I used less than 1/2 tsp of salt. I think 1 tsp would have been way too much. Thank you for the recipe!!!!!

This was my first attempt at guacamole. It was teriffic! It will definitely be a regular in my house going forward. Very easy to make. It is important to choose ripe avacados. We used Hass avacados. Their skin should be dark and they should have a little give when you squeeze them. I would recommend this recipe to anyone!

Haas avocados are what I recommend. I used the large Mexican avocados and it was bland. So, go with the more expensive Haas.

This was a big hit! Everyone loved the freshness. I let it sit in the fridge for 5-6 hours.  I didnt use a lot of cilantro....I dont know maybe its because Im pregnant- but I hated the smell of fresh cilantro. ICK! But I did use a little, I didnt use any onions. I used 4 avacados, 2 limes, no cayenne pepper, and I just kept tasting to make sure it didnt lack any salt or if it needed more lime. It was so refeshing and yummy! Will def make it again. It was a lot of fun and a great arm workout while mashing the avacados lol. :) Happy eating! XOXO

Delicious! This was my first attempt at making quac and it came out awesome. You can really taste the lime without it being too overpowering and the cayenne gave it a great kick without being too hot (I don't like anything too spicy). I doubled the recipe and put it in jars to give to family. Everyone loved it.

Good guac! I added half a jalapeno & one serrano pepper. I think next time I'll add .5tp more of minced garlic. Maybe another pinch of ground cayenne pepper.

This is the best guacamole I've ever had.  I used a whole onion instead of a half, but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  Amazing.  I will definitely make this again.

It was a huge hit! Slightly spicy, but just the right amount. I added extra garlic because I love garlic and I left out cilantro, because I don't like it. It was fantastic.

I've made it a few times now. If the garlic is fresh, it's amazing. If the garlic is minced from a jar, it's not so wonderful. I've also tried freeze dried garlic that I rehydrated and that tasted quite good.

Great recipe for guacamole! The only changes I made were halving the amount of onions and tomatoes. I've also used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic, and it works just as well. It's been a big hit with friends and family!

This is by far the easiest and ( for our palettes) tastiest guacamole base recipes I have come across. My wife and I add fresh hot peppers to spice it up and go salt free but after a few other recipes we always come back to this one.

This guacamole is the bomb. Whenever I make it for family get togethers, more than one person will say, "Yeah, Cheryl brought her guacamole." I've also been asked for this recipe quite a few times. For my personal taste, I like to add extra tomatoes. This is absolutely a must try recipe. It is Muy Bueno times diez.

This has been the base recipe for my guacamole for a number of years. Sometimes I omit the tomatoes if they aren’t in season, or I substitute chopped jalapeños for the cayenne. Regardless of whether I use the recipe is written or if I make one of the changes mentioned, it always makes a great guacamole. In fact, I’ve had more than one person tell me they don’t usually like guacamole, but this one is really good!

This was my first shot at making my own guacamole, and I was pleasantly surprised at how well it turned out!  Next time, I will cut the salt and the lime juice by about half, but overall, it was a great recipe!

Very nice Guacamole! I added a half teaspoon of ground cumin.... Very tasty! I liked the teaspoon of salt that this recipe called for, and I am not a big salt fan. Most recipes just call for 1/2 teaspoon of salt....I always have to add more. Good Stuff!

Followed tips from other reviewers (a little more lime juice and cilantro, as well as the addition of cumin) and it turned out GREAT. I am normally not a huge fan of guacamole, but needed to use up some avocados in the fridge. I can't wait to finish off the rest of it this evening, my boyfriend also loved it. Five stars completely.

Left out the onions. Instead if the cayenne pepper, I put in sliced jalapenos peppers and poured in some of the juice from a jar.

We really liked this recipe, but we thought the lime and cilantro overpowered the avocado a bit too much. We plan on using less of both next time. Great recipe!

Fantastic!!  I double the batch and it's still gone before we start the meal.  The only change I make is to only put in half the salt it calls for.  My family's favorite!!

Yummy!!! I can finish off (eat) this recipe "by myself" in about an hour! :):):) The only added note that I have for this recipe is to use RED onions...it makes all the difference.

This recipe was great and VERY easy! The only thing that I would change (per a couple people in my family) is the amount of salt. They thought it needed just a bit less but other than that...perfect!

I will NEVER buy pre-made guacamole again.  This was SO easy and delicious!  I was only making it for myself, so I used one avocado and cut the other ingredients by 1/3rd.  Except the garlic.  Because who doesn't love a lot of garlic?  If it wasn't for the carbs, I would have eaten it all with some chips!  But it was delicious on my Taco Salad!

Simply the best guacamole I have had.  I used a red onion and 2 tablespoons of lime juice rather than a fresh lime.  I made a double batch for a party and it disappeared.

This is a great authentic guacamole.  I would just spice it up with 2 or 3 serrano peppers or jalapeno (fresh).  Chop them up and toss them in.

Delicious!  I only ever make up a third of the recipe, leaving out the cayenne.  I sometimes use lemon in place of lime, depending what I have on hand.  It always hits the spot, thanks!

I make this exact guacamole OFTEN. I never sway from the original recipe because it's just that good! Everyone raves about it and I always get asked for the recipe. In fact, I'm making it tonite for about the 100th time!

This was so good.  I made it for my bunco group as a dip for the table. I should have doubled the recipe b/c it was a hit! I used half of a regular tomato, and not so much onion.  The fresh lime is a must!  This is the BEST!!

I'm very picky when it comes to Mexican food because i lived so close to the border in cali. But this was the closest thing to authentic I could find after I moved. This is a wonderful recipe if you love guacamole like I do you'll love this. the only thing i changed was a little more sault and lemon juice. Besides for that its wonderful.

This is the best!  I didn't have fresh cilantro so had to use dried.  One teaspoon worked great.   I'll be making this all summer long.

Yum!  I have made guac many times in the past but nothing even compares to this recipe.  Its full of flavor.  Usually I adjust the ingredient list but there is no need here.  I can't wait to make this again!!

Well, I thought this had very little flavor, however the roomies ate it all, so I'll give it a three out of five stars. I'm not sure what went wrong, I mean, you can't really screw up guacamole! I'll probably try this another time and hopefully taste better results.

Made this for a staff party at work.  Unfortunately I am allergic to avocados so cannot say what my personal opinion of this recipe is, however the response from my friends, co-workers and their families was phenominal.  Everyone loved it!!!!! Plus is so much easier to make than I ever imagined.

Guac was delicious, just make sure you use RIPENED avocados... Being new to cooking/using avocado, I didn't know that it needed to be really soft in order for it to mash... but once I figured that out and made it again it was great!

This was the first time I made guacamole and ate guacamole. It was also the first time I tried cilantro, and I'm not a fan. But, everyone else loved this recipe. I guess, cilantro has an acquired taste. Thank you for the post.

5 stars.  I made this dip on Thursday and let marinate over night but added sour cream and it was wonderful.  My husband does not like guacamole but he loved this receipt.

This is ,for me, hands down the BEST guacamole recipe!  I have made it several times.  Since finding this recipe I have always make guacamole from scratch.  I recently made it for a party and people just raved about it.    I usually use 2-3 cloves of garlic and leave out the onions (have an onion hater in the house).  The lime and garlic really make it spectacular.  Sometimes I don't have fresh cilantro and use dried or leave it out altogether and it still turns out amazing.

I love it!!! Added a touch of mint, which is not so important. What is VERY importantly, in my opinion, is squishing all the ingredients together with your two hands. Messy and sloppy, yes, but so wonderful at the same time. Avocado pulp is sensitive and so are tomatoes so they need to be squished just right, to release all the flavors and getting the creamy in wonderful merriment with the chunky. I also minced the garlic inside the lemon juice with the cilantro and mint. Great way to release the flavors. Thank you Mr. Cody!

this was my first time making my own guacamole.  I loved this recipe, I didn't use the same measurements as the recipe, used 1 less avacado, more lime juice, and added a little more salt.  Turned out great!  I think I ate the whole bowl...

We have just recently become fans of Guacamole (as long as its fresh!) and I have never attempted to make it - this was so easy and so good!  I followed it exactly as the recipe stated and only added in about 1/2 t. of Cumin as others had suggested.  I mashed the first 2 avocados and cut up the third in small chunks as we don't like it completely creamy.  My 12 year old loved it and ate the leftovers (there was not much!) the next day.  I also did as others suggested and kept the pit in the container with the leftovers really did help - it had hardly changed color at all.

This is a good guacamole recipe but too salty for my taste.  I would cut the salt down to 1/2 teaspoon or use kosher salt instead to really let the buttery avocado taste shine throught.  I also add a dash of cumin.

Excellent recipe and soooo easy. I was extremely upset that I bought Italian parsley instead of coriander as we love coriander. Will definitely make again. I cut tortillas in points baked at 250 until crisp (maybe 1/2 hour). Was amazing. And yes, the pit in the mix does delay it from turning brown :)

I must say, this is the best home made guacamole I've ever had. I used my food processor and combined all the ingredients. It came out smoooth and delicous! Loved it!

I followed the recipe exactly and it was terrific. My husband does not normally eat guacamole and he loved it and went back to eat more several times. Best guacamole I've ever had!

Bland. Didn't care for this much at all.  I think it was lacking something but I couldn't  put my finger on it.  I prefer the rotel guac recipe much more.

I was only making this for a party of two, so reduced the measures to 1 1/2 avocado. I changed a few other things, like subbing in different tomatoes because they are what I had. But either way, this recipe is fantastically delicious; quite the zesty flavor.

Awesome!  I added salt AND pepper to taste.  I also added a jalapeno for some  spice (we like it spicy)!    I personally don't like tomatoes but my Husband does ....... so I removed half of the guacamole before I added those in (that way we are both happy).  :-)  I also like my guacamole creamy so I put my half in the food processor and blitz it up to make it smooth.  :-)   Very yummy!!!

I love this guacamole! Pretty much followed the recipe exactly except I added a bit more cilantro (I love the stuff), RED onion, diced jalapenos and quite a bit more cayenne because I love my guac with a whole lot of bite. Also, I don't like super mashed guac so I smashed a couple of the avocados and cut the last in chunks for texture variety. Definitely tasty and doesn't keep me in the kitchen too long, especially when chips and guacamole are my dinner for that night!

It was good but I have had better.  This was my first time making it.  I stuck to the recipe to the tee. I will try it again but plan to read the reviews to see what I can add to it to give it a little more kick.

My wife and I LOVE guacamole and this recipe is perfect!  The recipe is great as is or you can adjust the ingredients depending on your taste.  We use a little less salt, a little more garlic, a little more cilantro and add some diced jalapeno pepper.  I also typically add lime juice to taste.  Sometimes one lime is too much and sometimes not enough, depending on the size and juiciness of the lime.   FYI - a pastry mixer works great for chunking up the avocado.  Overall this recipe is AMAZING.  If you like guacamole, try this, you won't be disappointed!!!

I made this for a superbowl party and it was gone quickly. I didn't have any cayenne pepper so I used some crushed red pepper instead. I read someone's review that said to use soft avocados, and as this was my first time making anything with avocados I found that tip helpful, because otherwise I wouldn't have known how hard they should be. Thanks!

OMG!!!  Fabulous!  Haven't started eating it yet but just licked the spoon and bowl.  We'll be eating in an hour or so and wanted to let the flavors blend a little but it's not really necessary.  I was skeptical about making the entire recipe (4 servings) for the two of us but we're both guac hogs so I am glad I made the recipe as stated.  Thank you for a delicious recipe!  Just as good if not better (fresher and organic) than our local restaurant.

Very good. My first time making guacamole. Thanks! Edit: You know, I have to upgrade this to 5 stars - we've made this too many times to count, and it has turned out wonderfully every time. Definitely try this if you love your guac chunky.

Might be 5 stars after meddling in the fridge for a while.  I just made it up and it needed way more garlic at least triple and some garlic powder.  I also added a minced jalapeno, & some chipotle powder to kick it up then added more cilantro as it seemed to give it a nice touch.

Wow...best ever!  I didn't have fresh cilantro, so I used coriander seeds and crushed them up...worked in a pinch!

I was not a fan of guacamole until I decided to make this on a whim. I'm so glad I gave it a chance. This is the only way I will ever eat guacamole. I made it exactly as the recipe said and it's perfect!

Nice balance of vegetables, but mine came out a bit too limey...  Will only use 1/2 of a lime next time.  LOVED the kick from the cayenne!!

By far the best guacamole recipe I have ever made/tried!  Everyone raves about this guacamole and I am often asked specifically to bring it to parties & events.  The little bit of cayenne gives it a nice kick and the cilantro is a must.

As is, I thought the recipe itself was pretty good. However, as per other reviews, I added several things that made this fantastic--couple tbs of sour cream, used red onion, lemon instead of lime, a little bit of cumin and paprika. I also used jalapenos instead of cayenne pepper.

The best!  I've been making this guac for a few years now, and now I'm simply expected to have it with me whenever we're invited over to a friend's house.  In fact, if I don't come with this guac in hand, I might as well just stay home.

Delicious.  I set it out and it was gone in minutes.  The only complaint was that there wasn't enough!  I used fresh garlic in mine and it had a bit too much bite to it.  Next time I might try dried minced garlic or maybe saute it for a bit first.

Very disappointed after reading how great this was supposed to be.  We followed the recipe and felt it had way to much lime and no real flavor other than that.  Will not make again.

Very good recipe. I zing everything but the avocado in the food processor and put it in the frig. Then I can make a 1,2, or 3 avocado batch of guacamole in about 90 seconds.

Nice and onion-y.  Great fresh taste with the cilantro.  The pinch of cayenne adds flavor but not heat.

This recipe gets rave reviews every time! I cut back on the onions a bit because I find it a tad over-powering and throw in an extra garlic clove. I also add a binch of cumin at the end. Thank you, Bob Cody, for a homemade recipe no one can beat!

Wish I had more stars to give! Fabulous! I increased the recipe for 19 and used 14 avocados. Every bit was gone! I used a little less tomato and onion then what the increase asked for and it was perfect. A Keeper!!

This recipe is awesome! (Lunch, mmmmmmm) I have made this recipe twice.  I made it the first time with red onions and the second time with green.  I prefer the green onions.  I was going to reduce the cilantro, but after tasting it, I decided to add the full amount.  Also, the first time I made it, 1 tsp. of salt was perfect.  The second time I made it, the avocados were a little smaller and so were the tomatoes, so the batch ended up a little salty.  Next time, I would start with 3/4 tsp, and add more if necessary.  I would also recommend squeezing the juice out of the tomatoes.  When I did not do that the first time, the batch turned out a little runny.  If you like more of a chunky guac. try mashing 2 1/2 of the avocados and then cut up the remaining half.

I use minced jalapenos instead of cayenne, but otherwise have made this twice just as described and it was delicious both times.

I felt this did not have a good balance of flavors.  The predominant flavors are overwhelmingly cilantro and lime juice, followed by raw garlic and raw onion.  I like to taste the avocados (and it was hard to taste them in this recipe) and have some kick too.  The cilantro and lime flavors did tone down a little after 48 hours.  It sure looked beautiful though.

I love guacamole however not had much luck making it at home until this recipe came along.  This is simply awesome.  My wife doesn't like guacamole but loved this recipe.  This recipe is great as is, no changes needed.

This is very good.  I usually double the garlic and omit the tomato and it's quite tasty that way.

I thought this recipe was really good, but could have had a bit more zest. I would recommend adding diced jalapeno, and perhaps a bit more garlic.

I can't believe I even liked the guac made from the packets at the grocery store that my mom always made. For about 5 minutes more effort than the "flavor packets" at the store, you can have Cantina restaurant quality guacamole! Check out Pioneer Woman's recipe for Pico de Gallo and you'll have all the Mexican chip toppings you'll ever need!  This guacamole is out of this world!

Awesome easy recipe.  I use this as a base and really tweak it based on the ingredients I have on hand.  I go a little light on the onion and used dried cilantro because it is what I had and it worked out fine.

This has become my go-to guacamole recipe.  It is perfect!  I do make one change now and that is to replace the regular onions with green onions.  Occasionally I will add a half of a jalapeno as well, whenever I want an extra kick.

it started out kind of bland.  We didn't have Cayenne, so we added some Frank's Red Hot sauce and a little extra lime juice and salt.. came out very good.  Also added a bit of sour cream (to make it creamier), but I think it made it more bland.

awwww...I was disappointed in this recipe.  I LOVE avocado but, the strong lime juice & salt overpowered the avocado.  I would probably try it again cuz over 1,000 reviewers can't be wrong!! However, next time less lime juice & way less salt!

Fantastic recipe - I didn't put in onions (my mom and I both have an intolerance), but added in more garlic and cilantro. It was a big hit!

I made this guacamole for a bbq with a group of people visiting our community from Mexico. The bowl was scraped clean and I received many compliments from the Mexicans and several of them requested the recipe, which I had to have interpreted in Spanish. It passed the test from the experts, so it's a keeper in my book.

I have made this several times, with a little creativity added, mixed in a TBSP of sour cream, or mascarpone cheese (whichever i had handy) and it made it even better!!! Must try!!!!!!!!

This is the first Guacamole recipe I have ever made.  It was soooo delicious and super easy!!  I have made it 3 or 4 times now and the only changes I made was that I only added 1/4 cup onions because the onion flavor was a little too strong for me.  I also added a little more garlic and an extra avacodo!!  It was sooo yummie!!  I will definitely be making this delicious recipe for years!!  Thank you so much for sharing!!

I made this Guacamole for the first time to my family who LOVES guacamole and they said this was the best batch yet! It is super easy to make and it is awesome! The only thing different I did was I only put in one tomato instead of two due to the fact I have a tomato hating kid to please,but this was so good,she didn't mind the tomato.

My 1st time making guacamole & it was great!  Easy & tasty.  Of course, you can always adjust the amount of ingredients to suit your taste (i.e., less onion, more cayenne, etc.).  Definitely a keeper!

I followed this recipe almost exactly and was pretty disappointed. I found it to be too salty even though I cut the salt in half. I also thought it tasted way too "limey" even though I reduced the amount of lime juice and used a small lime.   My friend and husband, on the other hand, seemed to like it. They insist they were eating it because it was good, not to make me happy.  Addition: It's better the 2nd day. The lime flavor isn't quite so strong.

Great recipe! We had to omit tomatoes because a dinner guest does not like them, but it still turned out great. I added extra cilantro and the lime really adds a nice zest. Bueno!!!

Not the best guacamole I've ever had, but still okay.  I followed the recipe exactly but omitted cilantro because I hate the stuff and never add it to guacamole.  My husband thought it was alright too, but not exceptional.  I let it sit for several hours in the fridge before serving.

Excellent recipe. The most important thing is to make sure you get good, ripe avocadoes (which is especially difficult for us in the Midwest). If you do that, this recipe comes out perfectly.

This is absolutely as good as guacamole can get! Thank you for sharing it!!  Tips: Obviously, you want ripe avacados. Make sure to use the lime juice, NOT lemon. Also, the chill time, although not required, makes it that much better! Also, the serving size is correct, I need at least 2 batches of this stuff if there's any more than a few people eating it. Truly, can't say enough good things about this recipe! :)

I was craving Guacamole from a local restaurant and decided to make it myself. I just happened to have everything needed for this recipe. OMG, it was soooo good.   The one thing I did do, is scrape out the seeds out of the tomatos so they wouldn't be so watery.  I processed 1 of the tomatoes (used 3 roma total) along with the cilantro, onion, garlic and a big scoop of avocado in my mini food processor and then mashed/mixed it in with the remaining avocado.  I gave some to my neighbor who has now asked me to make it again for her. This is a definate keeper.

Kind of disappointed I was hoping since this had so many good reviews this would be more like a restaurant quality guacamole. Seemed to have a big wang to it, possibly from the garlic but it was overpowering to me. I plan to try again another time with less garlic and I had left out the cilantro (husband hates it) so that may help too.  Second try - better than the first as I added the cilantro this time but still just not the greatest Guess I will keep tweaking to my taste preference.

I added an extra tomato, a jalapeno pepper and left out the cumin. Loved it.

I have made this countless times.  My family and guests always rave about it.  I have often substituted frozen, mashed avacados because I cannot always get nice ripe ones.  Plus, I can keep it on hand and whip up a quick batch when I have a last minute gathering to attend.

I used a can of drained, diced tomatoes instead, but everything else the same and it was excellent. Rave reviews from husband and friends. They couldn't get enough of it.

I didnt change anything! I like mine a little chunky, so I used a pastry cutter and stopped when I got to the consistancy of my liking. This is the best guacamole I have ever had. Thanks

BIG HIT! I took this to a party and noone could stop eating it. I added onion powder instead of fresh onions and add garlic powder as well as fresh garlic, everything else was the same.

We liked this.  One avocado wasn't completely ripe, and it still tasted great.  I even omitted the cilantro, because I am a cilatro hater, and it was still yummy!

Added a bit of salt and some Chipotle Tabasco because we like things spicy.  Everything else is perfect.  This is a very fresh guacamole and a nice change to pre-packaged.

Really good- although I sprinkled chilli powder in instead of the cayenne, and added more garlic and onions the second time.   I made it according to the recipe the first time and it was a bit bland.

Very easy to make and came together quickly. Be sure to use very ripe avacadoes - they should be just soft to the touch, or you will not be able to mash them. I used the juice of two limes for this, and opted for red onion instead of white. The family didn't like it, but they don't like guacamole in general, so I can't fault the recipe. I know you will enjoy it - just play with the seasonings and make it your own. When avocadoes are on sale, it is a very economical recipe.

Good guacamole, but my avocados didn't mash together with the rest of the ingredients very well. It could have been the avocados I purchased but as this was my first time making guacamole, I will have to rate this 4 stars until I try the recipe again. Then maybe I will rate it 5 stars if it turns out it really was just the avocados.

I would suggest starting with half a lime then add to taste if necessary.  One lime was just too much.

Excellent recipe however next time I will use green or red onions instead. My store was also out of fresh cilantro so 1 used 1tbs of dried and it was great but will be even better with fresh.

Very good.  The only change I made was that I used canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh.  I gave it a 4 instead of 5 as I thought it tasted good and people ate it at the party but no one mentioned anything about it so it must not have been outstanding.

Excellent!!!  I put everything in the food processor but the tomatoes.  So smooth and creamy and the bite of chopped tomatoes really made it the best ever.  My husband actually licked the bowl!  Can't wait to make again!

This was my first time making guacamole. I saw and reviewed all the ratings but I didn't expect this to be SO GREAT! I was not let down. I am very picky about my guac and this was divine. I have made this over again the same way since. Love it everytime. Try it!

As good as restaurant guac. Have made this many times, always delicious and very flexible. I highly recommend using a food processor. After processing all other ingredients,add the tomatoes(quartered) and onions(also quartered) last and pulse.

okay, a bit longer than 10 minute prep, but who cares, this tastes really delicious, i am going to use more cayenne next time and also maybe some cumin because so many reviewers had recommended it, i cant seem to get enough of it and feel like i want to keep adding more fresh cilantro, next time i will also try red onion as i always prefer the kick they add to everything.  THANKS SO MUCH FOR THE WONDERFUL RECIPE, GREAT REVIEWS AND TIPS!!!!

Very good recipe! Made double batch, half went into a 7 layer dip, the other was set for it's own dip! Was gone by the end of the evening! Thank you :)

This recipe really needs more spice and less lime juice. I would say half the amount of lime and a jalapeno or two. I won't be making this recipe again.

Perfect! Next time I will use 3 large avacados, instead of the 3 small that I had. I may add a 4th avacado just for extra taste. Best recipe. I wont be using any other! Thank you!

this was AWESOME!!! I thought it even tasted better than the guac i've had at a lot of mexican restaurants. i make this whenever I am making quesadillas for dinner and it is a huge hit. The only thing I feel is that it does not need 2 roma tomatoes - 1 is always enough for me. I feel like the tomato flavor overpowers the avacado and also will make it more watery, which I don't like. I like it to be more of a paste. I also just used garlic powder, and i thought it was wonderful.  I also used red onions and thought they added more to the flavor as well. This will be my go-to recipe for years to come.  Thank you!!!

Though I snarfed it down I thought the lime overwhelmed the other flavors even after letting it the flavors meld for 5 hours. Very fresh tasting. It was my first home made guacamole in years and I am glad I made it. Will use the same recipe with less lime juice next time. Thanks!

This guacamole was very good. I followed the recipe exactly as written, but I didn't use fresh cilantro. I think that made a huge taste difference. Next time I will use fresh. I also think it needs more garlic than called for, but it's just a matter of personal taste. All the guests at game night really liked it!

This is a great recipe, we added some cumin as others mentioned and only half the lime, it was overwhelming at first but after sitting in the fridge it melded with the other flavors. Added a bit more garlic and onion, personal preference

Excellent!!!  I normally use the food processor when making guac but I didn't this time and it was excellent!  I used three cloves of fresh garlic minced and I substituted a few drops of tabasco in place of the C pepper.   SOOO good!  Even my 4 and 2 year olds ate it!

I love guacamole but had never made it before because I thought it would be really time consuming.  This recipe took under 10 minutes to make and was delicious!  Just make sure your avocados are ripe, and increase the spices to your taste if you like it spicy.  I added half the lime juice and tasted it before adding the rest (based on the other reviews) but I thought it tasted great with the juice from the whole lime.  Thank you for this outstanding and easy recipe!

Perfect in every way! I substituted bottled lemon juice for the lime juice, and used dried cilantro (half of the fresh requirement), and it was great!

The best guacamole ever! I made two batches for a party - one for cilantro lovers like myself, and one for those who hate cilantro like my boyfriend. I was surprised to see that cilantro-haters actually liked the guacamole with cilantro!

I have made this guacamole six times since the 4th of July and every time I get rave reviews.  I go easier on the tomato, since I don't think they add a whole lot.

Delicious and so easy to make! I used a little less salt, about half the amount, because it tasted a little too salty before I chilled it. After standing in the fridge for about 3 hours the saltiness mellowed and was just right. 

I doubled the recipe, and it was all eaten with enthusiastic praise from everyone!

Awesome!!! I made this for a class I was doing with teenagers. All of them said at the beginning of class they did not live avocados.

A must have recipe in your cookbook! Very nice blend of flavors and texture. I substituted fresh cilantro for dried, since I didn't have fresh cilantro. I also reduced the amount of tomato by half. Served it alongside Lime Chicken Soft Tacos. Will be definetly making this again!

This was great and the citrus helped keep the guacamole fresh for the day after so it stayed nice and green. Everyone loved it, at first I thought it tasted like there was too much lime but after adding all the tomatoes it was just enough to give it a unique taste. loved it and will definitely make it again.

Very good.  I leave out the Cilantro and use Onion Powder instead of diced onion.  Also, I like to add pepper jack cheese to my Guacamole.

Fantastic! I followed the recipe exactly, opting NOT to add the cayenne pepper. At first, I thought it was too much lime, but in retrospect, the lime kept the dip from turning brown, and I think I liked the lime-ier flavor. It complimented the cilantro well. Oh, I also cut the salt in half - better to have too little than too much. Will make again!

Meh -- this was just okay.  I will give it 3 stars because the recipe provides a nice base for you to play with.  I had to add so  much more garlic, cayenne pepper and I even added extra peppers just to get a little heat.  I did like the fresh cilantro because it added a fresh taste.  However, on its own, this recipe is just too bland to deserve more stars.

This was so good I could have eaten it with a spoon!!!
I left out the cayenne pepper (personal preference).  The cilantro makes it special!

I doubled this recipe for my family and it looked like a huge amount of quacamole, but within 2 hours it was all gone. Everyone said it was the best they had ever had. My sister took the recipe home with her and said she will never buy guacamole again.

Had my family over for Memorial Day.  Only change I made to this was I used 2 Tbsp. of lime juice 1/4 cup onion and forgot to put in cilantro.  Everyone loved it!!  I would definitely put in cilantro next time and do lime juice and onion as I wrote above.  EXCELLENT!!

I love alvocados...this was excellent! I did add a little chili powder, it was a bit bland before that. I didn't put the pepper in though, so I may do that next time. Either way, it was excellent!

Made this for my husband's birthday party, minus the tomatoes, and he declared it his new favorite recipe. He asked that next time I make it, I add the tomatoes too.

This was great! I made it for a party of 20 people andeven the kids ate it. I made another dish without the cilantro and jalapeno for the wimps and it was still great! A no-brianer.

Great guac! I used grape tomatoes (I like that they're a tad sweeter) and leeks (I didn't have any regular onions) and added just a pinch of cumin. Awesome and gone in minutes! Next time I'll definitely double or triple the recipe!

This is AWESOME! We adore Guacamole and this is the only one we make! Tried many other but this is the best by far! LOVE IT! We keep everything the same except for the amount of Garlic; we add a lot more garlic but that's just for our taste! Great recipe! Thank you! *Thumbs Up!*

I took this guacamole to a party yesterday and it was a hit! The only change I made was I only used 1 tsp. of salt while preparing, then added a little bit more to taste after the recipe was together. I just didn't want the salt to overpower the other flavors. PERFECT!

Quality recipe, but it could be spiced up a little more... I add extra garlic (and maybe a little garlic salt), cayenne pepper, and cilantro.

This was the best guacamole I have EVER eaten. I added a little more lime juice and some cumin (personal preference) to the mix and it was faboulous! I suggest keeping the cayanne in the recipe since it really adds to it as well. Just scale it down if you're worried about the heat.

I have made this every time we go to a party and it is a huge hit!  My boyfriend is a health nut and will eat this guacamole with a spoon straight from a bowl.  Although,  I added more lime juice and diced up an avacado and put it in at the end.  I like mine a little chunkier.

Mmmm, very tasty Guacamole!  I'm warning you though that you don't taste much of the avocados.  I would suggest cutback on the cilantro abit.  It can be a very powerful addition.  I make guacamole alot and this recipe is always the one I come back too!  It might need alittle tweaking to your taste but not much.  It is also best next day, when all flavors have set. And a must to go with it is your own baked corn tortillas:)  YUM YUM!!!

This is by far the best guacamole I have ever made. Every time friends come over, they ask if I can make this...The last time I made this, I was out of fresh garlic and added just a tad of garlic powder and it was still great.

I thought this was good, but I prefer less onion and cilantro in mine.  Will make adjustments next time.  Hubby ate it all, so it must have been good.  Did like it better the next day after it sat in the fridge.

For 2-separate events, I made the best rated Guacamole on AllRecipes.com and every one said it was THE best they'd tasted ... as well as even greater compliments and comments.  I used Haas Avocados and by the generic recipe of 3-Avocadoes, I bought 8 Haas, but only used 6 ... just in case.

Thanks!

Best guacamole I have ever had...hands down.  I did use shallots instead of onion because I had some left over from another dish.  Don't pass this recipe up...you'll only want guacamole at home after you try this recipe.

I love avocados and I love guacamole and this is really good guacamole. In fact, the hubby and I just ate some tonight w/chips and salsa. I try to follow the recipe exact except I add a bit more cayenne or sometimes Jalapenos for some spice. I will add a touch of Lawry's and it definitely needs cumin. I buy my avocados from Costco because they come 5 in a bunch and are a lot cheaper then the market and they are good. So I am making guacamole all the time it seems. Which is ok with me and the hubby!

I can't make guacamole to save my life, so I was really excited to find this recipie. I have to pull out the measuring spoons EVERY time, but it kicks the  of store bought guacamole in taste and price. Nice work and thank you.

Taste-wise, this was great, but I'd like a recipe that wouldn't turn brown after just one day in the fridge. Wonderful the first day, though!

We LOVE this guacamole!  It's better than our favorite at the local Mexican restaurant. I had 5 avacados, so adapted the recipe.   I smashed 3 of the avacados, then chopped the last 2 for chunky consistency.  Also added an extra pinch of red pepper.  There's only 2 of us now that all the kids are gone, so my husband took leftovers to work and had lots of requests for the recipe.

I followed the recipe to a "T" (very easy to make and quick too) and it was delicious.  It is so much better than restaurant guacamole and a million times better than the store-bought stuff.  Never again will I buy guacamole!

This is a fantastic recipe! 
I have made this a few times, and each time I realize I love it more than the last. I most recently made this so I could use it as the dressing on grilled chicken sandwiches, and it was simply delicious (and perfect in place in mayo).  It is healthy and tastes good…these recipes are not easy to come by! Thanks for posting this!!

YUM!  This was great!  I did make a few tweaks, I used 4 avocados because what I had was small.  I didn't have any limes so I used 2 tablespoons of lemon juice.  It turned out fantastic!  My family ate it all in one day and I'm making more today.

I love this recipe and first made it for an open house...many people wanted the recipe.  You can always add a little more or a little less of anything to suit your taste, it is definitely my favorite. A Chinese friend of mine who never had it before wanted to come over and learn how to make guacamole after eating this.

Try using salsa sauce instead of chopping onions, tomatoes and garlic...it saves a lot of time.  Don't skimp on the fresh cilantro - it's a must.

AMAZING!  I have made this for several parties and everyone LOVES it and asks for the recipe.  I usually put in 1 whole garlic clove for each avocado I use.  Really tasty with "hint-o-lime" tortilla chips.

Based on the reviews, I thought this was going to be the best guacamole I had ever eaten. That wasn't the case. It has way too much salt. I love onions, this is way too much onion for 3 avocados. Sorry, this recipe isn't for me and my family.

Super easy. I added a corn, cumin, red onion, garlic, apple cider vinegar recipe and the two blended fabulously.

Wow! I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. Even my mom and brother who normally hate guacamole! I used a red onion instead of a normal one and made it about 5 hours ahead of time. Great recipe!!

I think the basics in this recipe are good, but when I made it I tasted way too much salt.  The cilantro is a bit overpowering as well, so I think I'll reduce both these ingredients the next time I make it.  Using fresh tomatoes is a good idea if they're flavorful enough, but the romas I bought in the grocery store were too bland.  I might used canned tomatoes next time.  I miss my grandfather's garden-grown tomatoes :(

This was really good and I got a lot of compliments when I served this at a party. The only things I did differently were that I used the juice of half of a small lime and added a few dashes of garlic salt. It definitely needs to be refrigerated a few hours before serving though to let all the flavors mix. Thanks for the recipe.

My first attempt at a guacamole recipe...and this one is fabulous! I also took the advice of another reviewer and used 1 Tablespoon of onion powder instead of actual onion because I was in a hurry...YUMMY!

This was amazing.  I wanted to make a little bit for my finace and I tonight so I changed it to one serving (using one avocado).  I then only added 1/2 of the lime juice and a only a couple tablespoons of tomato diced.  The kicker was adding a dollup of sour cream. - this is the best guac I have ever had!!

These are by far the best guacamole I've tasted.  I've made this one about 50 times now.  I would NEVER buy another premade guac from a store.  We usually have it with seven layer tortilla pie from this site.  It is very good.

A decent recipe.  It's very similar to a guacamole recipe I make, however I don't use cayenne pepper.  Instead, I add diced marinated jalapenos.  These tend to add the right amount of spice as well as the tanginess (because of the vinegar).

This is a fantastic recipe! The only change I made was that I added more tomato and more cilantro than called for. This is very easy, I actually chopped the tomatoes and onion (very fine chop) ahead of time and then peeled and mashed the avocado when I was ready to serve. I got it done and served during halftime of the Packer game. Excellent!

This is a great, easy to make recipe. One night I made this recipe to serve with taco salad. I forgot to take the guacomole out of the fridge so took it out and served it with chips after everyone said they were full. It still disappeared after a few minutes!

Made Guacamole for the first time and it was such a big hit at my son's first birthday party! Good to chop the onions small so the taste is not so strong, but is still there..if you know what i mean.

This is the only guacamole recipe that my family allows me to make.  The only changes I've made is using red onion and dicing a small jalepeno pepper.  But, would be excellent just as is.  Best if eaten in 24 hours.

Being a yankee, I have never been a big fan of guacamole but this was delicious!! The hubby is from NM and also loved it. I left out the cayenne pepper. I may add some hot sauce the next time for a little kick. Great recipe and really easy to make as long as the avocados are nice and ripe (learned that the hard way).

The addition of cilanto and red pepper really spiced things up.  Two ingredients that I had not added in the past. A real crowd pleaser!

I made it exactly as written but probably upped the cayenne pepper from 1/8 tsp to 1/4 tsp or more.  It was EXcellent!

Nothing beats fresh guacamole that you can make so easily yourself! I prepared it earlier than needed, with the flavors "mixing" during the day.

Just ok. This was my first time making real guacamole... I had to add a lot of salt and cayenne. I think my boyfriend and I prefer the packet of seasoning! But still, this was a nice change from the "generic" guac:)

This was my first time making guacamole.  I always thought it was too difficult to make.  Boy, was I wrong!!  This was delicious!  I ate 1/2 of it myself in one sitting!!  The only thing I will do differently next time is cut the salt in half, to 1/2 tsp.  I thought 1 tsp. was too salty.  I used red onion and only used what I thought "looked" like enough.  In addition to minced garlic, I also sprinkled some granulated garlic in it.  This is excellent!  I'm going to make it for my daughter's birthday party next week!

This is so good.  I have been making this recipe for a while now and am just now getting back to review it.  I do not put the tomatoes in because I don't like them and I use red onion.  I think this is better than what I find in the Mexican places around here.  Thanks.

I'm just beginning to learn how to cook (my Mom's pressuring finally got to me) and this was simple and easy! I added red chili powder and a green chili because my Indian family likes things spicy. This was great!

Being a Texas girl living in Japan, I decided to through a Fajita Fiesta for my birthday.  I made the whole spread including this recipe.  The Guac got rave reviews from everybody and was completely eaten by the end of the night...even by the Lt. who doesn't like Mexican food!!! What an awesome recipe....

The only reason I would try another guacamole recipe is because i like experimenting. But if I want to be sure to please my guests, I'll serve this one! I used green onions instead of a regular one, added half a jalapeno pepper and upped the amount of cilantro: perfect! Thanks for posting this recipe.

SOO good!  I made this for company and I only used 2 avacados, forgot to add the garlic, and used lemon juice even-- I am having a VERY hard time staring at it in the fridge rather then waiting for my company!!

I made it the day before so the flavors could mingle.  Fairly easy to make but wasn't over the top.  It was ok.

This is excellent - perfect for a party or night-time snack.  I made this exactly as described but added one extra plum tomato.  This will definitely be the first snack to disappear at the party - make extra!

Yum! Used a few tablespoons of salsa instead of the tomatoes the second time I made it, which turned out to be a great addition, but the original recipe is delicious as is.

this recipe was both easy and delicious I will be making it every time we have mexican food also if i could add bottled lime juice works just as well but other than thatI would not change a thing about this recipe.

Yum!!  This is by far the best version of guacamole I have ever tasted, and it is very simple to make.  I make it smooth with a food processor before adding the onions and tomatoes.  I live in an area where fresh herbs are costly and hard to come by, and I found using a gelled version of cilantro from McCormick produces much better results than dried.

I made this for a Mother's Day family BBQ, and it was a big hit. I only used one tomato, and I cut back on the salt. It was so flavorful that we didn't think adding the cayenne was necessary. We'll make this one again and again. The fresh cilantro and lime juice are what makes this taste so fresh and wonderful.

This was the best guacamole ever!!  I used onion powder instead of minced b/c I don't like a strong onion flavour and it was just perfect!  Way better than what you get at the grocery store and really quick if you use a food processor.

Pretty good recipe, but the flavor was a bit off for my taste. The second time I made it with lemon instead of lime and liked it much better. Just a matter of personal preference.

FABULOUS recipe!  I did make a few changes, mostly because I didn't have quite the exact ingredients...Instead of lime, I used 1 T. of lemon juice; instead of 1 t. of salt, I used only 1/2 t., I used 1 t. onion powder, replaced fresh cilantro with 2 t. dried parsley, used hothouse tomatoes (1 lg., but next time I will use 1 1/2 or 2 because I love tomatoes in mine), and used 1 clove garlic.  It was FABULOUS FABULOUS FABULOUS--even my 3 year old loved it!!!  It never did make it to the fridge.... :)  Thank you for a definite KEEPER!!!

Holy cow this is awesome! I made a few changes to the original though. I left out the lime, garlic, and cilantro just because I didn't have any and added one big heaping spoonful of Mrs. Renfro's picante sauce mixed with a little Pace Picante Sauce and a little ketchup. It was just the right combination of sauces to add to it to make it truly incredible... the BEST guac you will EVER sink your teeth into! Thanks Bob! This guacamole is HEAVEN!

Yum!  This only lasted about 15 minutes between the five of us at the gathering.  It was very flavorful and tasty.  I'll have to make this again over and over.  Thanks for sharing!

Overall, very good.  I thought it to be a bit bland, but then again, I tried to substitute Tobasco for cayenne pepper.  (also added a few dashes of lemon juice)

This was very tasty.  I followed the recipe exactly, expect I only had two avocados on hand, rather than three.  Next time I make this, I'll make sure I have the three on hand.  Husband loved it too.
