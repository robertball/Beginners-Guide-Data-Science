This is a good, basic and very easy salsa recipe. Toss everything in the food processor and let it do all the work.   We had peppers, tomatoes and onions straight from the garden so the flavors were super fresh.  I may try this again using the canned tomatoes in the middle of the winter, but I couldn't pass up the opportunity to use the garden fresh flavors of summer.  I did roast the peppers over an open flame on my gas stove which is easier and faster for me.  This one will be used time and again.  My tasters couldn't get enough of it.

I used this recipe as a base recipe and added mango chunks. I also realized I had some shrimp in the freezer which made it into a meal almost! It was a hit, the only complaint was it's heat but I didn't mind because I love the heat! I think everyone would benefit from making this and adding some fun tweaks to it for a get together.

I added a couple of grinds of sea salt, lemon juice and a bit of red wine vinegar.  It's really good.

I substituted a poblano pepper for the red chili's and before roasting sprinkled some cumin and smoked paprika on the peppers.  I used a red onion and processed all the rest of the ingredients down before adding the peppers, processed the peppers and then added it all together, before processing again.  We like our salsa very smooth. When finished we added a bit of red wine vinegar, a few drops of Tabasco, and a sprinkle of chipolte chili powder.  This salsa is delicious and I will definitely use this recipe again.
