What this recipe lacks is an essential ingredient. The beef is traditionally served with rice vermicelli which can be easily prepared in the following way:
1-soak the vermicelli for about one hour in cold water. Hot water ruins it.
2-have a pot of boiling hot water ready  and a hand strainer full of the limp noodles. Dip in for about 30 seconds to 45 seconds and take out. While dipping use chopsticks to mix the noodles around in the striner. 
3-continue with remaining noodles until all are cooked.
lemongrass tip--put lemongrass stalks in food processor (add a small bit of water if dry)and freeze in small usable portions for future, saves time in the future for other dishes like the beef and or use on chicken.

As with almost every Vietnamese dish I've eaten and cooked, this is a savory and addictive, awesomely good and simple recipe, especially when the dish is served with sauteed vegetables, sesame green beans and jasmine rice (as mentioned by a previous reviewer) or vermicelli (as mentioned by another).  I agree that the lemongrass must be pulverized with a mortar & pestle or in a food processor (you can also buy frozen pulverized lemongrass in little plastic cups in some Asian markets).  Additionally, only the tender interior of the fresh lemongrass should be used for this as the outer leaves are too fibrous.  My one comment about this dish is that it is much more authentic and tastier made with fish sauce (Vietnamese nuoc mam, Thai nam pla or even Filipino patis) instead of soy sauce, which I know can sometimes be harder to find than the readily available soy sauce.  NOTE:  the fish sauce I mention is *NOT* the sweetened American kind served as a dip with fried fish, but the Asian version made from fermented fish.  Soy sauce makes it universal for everybody to make, and still creates a terrific dish. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

The flavors here are awesome, but if kids will be eating this too, I'd put some of the marinade for the kids's portions in a seperate dish before adding the pepper called for in the recipe. Use most of it in the adults marinade but add just a sprinkle for the kids. Also, gently pound the lemongrass stalks with a mallet or hammer to help them release their flavor once chopped. This dish will definitely impress guests!

I'm Vietnamese so I know authentic asian bbq. this is pretty good. i would grab the lemon grass if at all possible because that's the kicker. some people have subbed for lemon juice. don't let the "lemon" in lemon grass fool you. they ate totally different things. When I bbq i usually bbq a few skewers first then adjust the marinade to taste. If you try this recipe, feel blessed cause we don't be giving out ancient secrets out all the time.

Excellent dish! I had no grill, skewers or lemon grass, so I used lemon juice on the steak, baked it for 20 minutes at 350 degrees, and then combined it with the vegetable portion in a large bowl. Man, this was great food! Try it with authentic fried rice!

This wasn't bad. I proably won't make again.  Would not go out and buy lemon grass for just this recipe. I would recomment serving this over the lettuce and putting Nuaoc Cham Sauce over it. For some reason my review of how to make the sauce got deleted?????? Here is how you make th sauce: 2 coloves garlic mniced,1 tea crushed red pepper flakes, 3 tbs white sugar, 2 tbs lime/lemon juice, 4 tbs fish sauce, 1 cup water.  Mix it all together.

This is fun as well as delicious.  Along with the Nuaoc Cham sauce, it's a big hit with my whole family, especially the children.

I added about 2 inches of grated ginger to the marinade, and we cooked these over an open fire while camping.  To serve, we tossed the meat with rice vermicelli, fresh julienne carrots, red peppers, snap peas and green onions, mint, corriander and basil, and topped with crushed peanuts and Nuoc Cham sauce (crush together 1 clove garlic, 2.5 tsp sugar and a pinch of chili pepper powder; add 2 tbsp fish sauce, 1/8 fresh lime juiced, 2.5 tbsp water or to taste).  This was absolutely spectacular!

For me, I thought there was too much pepper taste.  My husband on the other hand thought he had died and gone to heaven.  

Will make it again for him.  thanks for the recipe.

Made this for family and guests - everyone raved over it - even the kids asked for seconds! I partially froze the beef so I could slice it nice and thin. I also doubled the marinade and used dried lemon grass instead of fresh. Will make again!

This was pretty good. My first time to venture into "Vietnamese" cooking but it was good. A different twist to steak. My family (even picky eaters)rated it a keeper.

My husband is Vietnamese and I was so happy when he said that this tasted just like his mom's!!  His only suggestion was to serve it with vermicelli noodles as opposed to rice.

We liked this a lot.  I wasn't sure how it is supposed to be eaten.  But I made the rice vermicelli and noauc cham according to Rachel1070's directions, and we had all the leafy herbs, green onions and lettuce to accompany.  Labor intensive.  Very healthy.  I also made Vietnamese fresh spring rolls as an appetizer.  I just wish I knew exactly how you are supposed to put everything together and how to serve this.  Are you supposed to wrap it in lettuce?

We followed another reviewer advice and used lemon juice instead of lemon grass. It was very good.

This recipe was awesome!!!  I changed the following:  I toasted the sesame seeds, and used pork loin cut into small chunks and marinated it for a full day, stir fried it in the marinade, which had pretty much soaked into the meat, over high temp very quickly.  Would definately recommend this recipe for somthing new!!!

Very Good! The produce section didn't have fresh lemon grass. I bought some in a jar and used about 2 to 3 tablespoons. It tasted the same. Also, in response to other reviews, discard the sliced lemon grass with the marinade before eating.

This was very good. I baked it instead of grilling in a pan and I did not even need to use the sauce i made because it was nice in the juices left over from the marinade. I also had to marinade it for 5 hours because I was ou of the house. Came out very yummy!

I was surprised how flavorful and moist these skewers were.  I had to replace the lemongrass with a good squeeze of fresh lemon juice and added a little garlic chili paste and marinated them overnight.  I also omitted the garnishes and the Nuaoc Cham sauce.  It was still delicious.  Served it with Chicken Satay and Peanut Sauce and grilled asparagus over brown rice with Ume Plum Vinegar.  I can't wait for lunch tomorrow.

I didn't make any changes to the marinade.  I did choose to cook it on the grill without skewers and ate on a bed of rice with a cucumer/avacado/tomato salad...  Oh and I used boneless beef ribs.  It turned out amazing... Word to the wise I bought 1.5lbs like the recipe said and it was barely enough marinade so if you use extra meat then make extra marinade.

This was yummy. I didn't skewer the meat. I just marinated it and cooked it on the grill.  I sliced it into strips and served it over Israeli couscous. It was great.  Yummy flavor. Use Lemongrass. I didn't  add sesame seeds- I used them all up last week.

These were GREAT!! I used half soy sauce and half fish sauce in the marinade. PLEASE don't substitute the lemon grass! It really adds flavor that nothing else can duplicate. We buy lemon grass at the Asian market, chop it up, and freeze it. Then you can have it available for recipes like this one.

This recipe turned out great - after I realised that you don't use the whole stalk of the lemongrass! lol.  I made it ahead of time and froze it until I needed it.

Great recipe! I grilled the kebabs on the BBQ and served with fried rice. The lettuce and herbs add a wonderful freshness. Would make an excellent summer dish.
