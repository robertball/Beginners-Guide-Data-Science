Easy and delicious - reminds me a little of a pizza we order from a local pizza shop! Tomatoes, fresh mozzarella and fresh basil - how can you go wrong? I used a mix of canned tomatoes mixed with fresh tomatoes and I added a little kosher salt and minced garlic. I let that set for a little while to let the flavors blend and then spread that over the pizza then topped with the fresh mozzarella.  I followed the rest of the directions, baked according to my oven and perfecto - fresh delicious margherita pizza! Great with a glass of wine!

Rating this on the changes I made. Used prepared pizza dough and fresh tomatoes, sliced and drained for 30 minutes. I laid  the tomatoes on the pizza dough, topped with fresh basil leaves and placed fresh mozzarella over all. I found fresh mozzarella packaged in a roll, so all I had to do is unroll it and tear it in pieces. I have a pizza pan that has holes in it so the crust gets crispy on the bottom too. I baked it for 30 minutes at 400 degrees and it wasn't done on the bottom, so next time I will up the temp to 425 and keep the time the same. The favors were very close to what we had in Italy

My family loved this pizza. I followed the recipe exactly. It was very easy to make. The bread dough created a soft chewy crust. The canned peeled tomatoes gave a lot of flavor, just drain them as well as you can so your pizza won't get too soggy.

I mostly used this recipe as a guideline but whatever I put together turned out great! I didn't use the cornmeal and I just bought a pre-made dough from trader joes.

Delicious!  I didn't have canned whole tomatoes, so I used fresh tomatoes, sliced them, seeded them, then chopped them and mixed them with minced garlic and allowed to drain.  I also misread the directions and ended up doubling the basil because I put basil under the cheese, then realized it's supposed to be topped in the last 5 minutes, so I did that too.  I made two pizzas as directed with this, but made a thicker dough.  I used the New-York Style Pizza Dough recipe on here, allowing it to rise for 20 minutes before I topped it.  I also chopped the mozzarella to help it spread better.  I upped the temps to 425 to compensate for the thicker crust but kept the rest the same.  This was a lovely lunch for hubs and I, and I gave the second pizza to my neighbor so she could enjoy as well.  Super easy and delicious.  Thanks for the recipe!
