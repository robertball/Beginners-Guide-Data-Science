Okay, I felt silly looking at a recipe for grilled cheese sandwiches, but I am glad I did. I also felt silly on how long it took me to get this right, LOL. I did not know that the sandwich would cook on the bottom first. So, the first time I cooked them, I kept waiting for the top to turn golden brown, so the bottom burnt. The second time I flipped them when the bottom was cooked, and cooked the other side for the same amount of time. So, the bottom burned. The third time was a charm :-) I flipped when the bottom was done and checked the sandwiches after 2-3 additional minutes. Perfect!! The total cooking time is 6-8 minutes. If you cook the total time that the recipe says, you might end up with burned bread as I did. These are great. Can make many many at a time and they are not greasy. So, I am slow at learning, but these are great!! Thanks for the recipe!! I will repeat many times!!!

In my family, we've been making grilled cheese sandwiches in the oven for as long as I can remember.  I had never had them any other way until high school. We don't bake them as in this recipe, though -- we put them under the broiler.  If you do it this way, however, watch them closely because they cook _fast_.

Some tips:

Where there is butter, the bread will take longer to cook.  This means, for best results, put the most butter around the crust and little to none in the middle.  Done that way, the crust won't burn before the sandwich is ready.

Also, if using a thick slice of cheese, or a pair of american singles, you might want to melt the cheese with the sandwich open-faced before closing it, buttering and baking/broiling as indicated.  I find that the cheese sometimes doesn't get melted completely otherwise.

I have had grilled cheese sandwiches made the "traditional" way many times, though I grew up on them this way.  To me, there is no comparison; the oven gives a nice, crispy texture that I have been unable to duplicate any other way.

this is a great idea! And a tip for anyone who is left with soggy-bottom bread: elevate the sandwich OFF of the baking sheet. Slip you sandwich onto a cooling rack,and put the rack on the baking sheet. PRESTO! total-surface ventillation. thanks, michelle :-)

Ya know, I never thought I would stop and actually read a recipe for a grilled cheese sandwich! My curiosity got the best of me and I am sure glad it did!!  I've always made grilled cheese in the frying pan...NO MORE! Although I love the gooiness of a grilled cheese sandwich, mine were always too gooey and floppy! This recipe makes a wonderful crunchy outside and a glorious gooey inside! Thank you so much!
I did follow the other tips below and buttered the bread heavier on the edges and hardly at all in the middle.  This worked out perfect. I also only set the oven for 400 degrees, put the rack on the bottom position and baked for about 8 min on the first side and only 6 mins after flipping.
Two slices of American cheese was my choice for the sandwiches this time, but looking forward to adding other goodies such as tomato, ham, or even trying a tuna melt....Thanks for this idea!!!!

Curiosity got the better of me and I just had to try this method of "cooking" grilled cheese sandwiches.  It's a really great idea if you need a whole bunch at one time.  I don't run into that problem because it's just me and my husband but this Actually Does Work.  The grilled cheese comes out oohey, goohey, crispy, and delicious! Great idea and great recipe!  I'll have to try this with other "grilled" sandwiches.

All I can say is WOW!  Who would have thought a sandwich could taste so different using the oven? They were great ~ as mentioned previously, the outside comes out super crispy and the cheese inside is just perfect.  I used two slices of cheese and baked both sides at 425 for 6 minutes and they were wonderful!

After reading the reviews and making this several times, I've discovered a few things. The time it takes depends on the bread type (e.g., wheat, white, etc.), the bread slice thickness and the temperature of the cheese when it goes in the oven. White bread takes twice as long as wheat bread (with the same thickness) to brown. Cheese that is still at refrigerator temperature will not melt by the time the bread is browned. I've a feeling that the author used white bread and her cheese was at room temperature. For me, it takes 5-6 minutes on each side for white bread and 3-4 minutes on each side for wheat bread. The best way I have found to make sure the cheese melts is to place a buttered slice of bread (buttered side down) on a cookie sheet, top with cheese and bake for the first half of the time. Add a second slice of buttered bread on top of the cheese (buttered side up) then flip over and bake the remaining time. It turns out perfect every time for me now. Each oven will be slightly different too. Mine is only about 6 months old.

This is the only way I make grilled cheese.  This is how they made it when I was in school.  I usually have to make 10 sandwiches at a time and this cuts the time in half!  It's really, really tasty!!  Try it, you'll never make them in a pan again!

I love the texture of these sandwiches.  They're crispy and flavorful instead of soft and squishy they way ones on the stove are.  I doubt I'll be making grilled cheese sandwiches any other way from now on, even when making only one.  They're great.  However, I did find that 5 minutes per side was plenty in my oven.

This is truly the easiest way to make a batch of grilled cheese sammies for a larger family. I still prefer the skillet method (the crust gets a little "harder" when done in the oven) but this is just too easy. I cover my baking sheet in foil and cleanup is a cinch. The cooking times are a little high for my oven so keep an eye on your sandwiches.

What a great recipe! The sandwiches were perfect. The bread was crispy, not soggy or greasy. You can really taste the flavors. The cheese melts beautifully and clean up is a breeze. The baking time of 6-8 minutes per side is right on. I placed my baking sheet on the lowest rack in my oven.

I would've LOVED for these to be *just as good* as regular grilled cheese sandwiches, but unfortunately we were disappointed.  Too crispy around the edges (hard even) though the centers had a nice texture - certainly nothing special and we'll definitely be using the old tried and true *fry* method in the future.  Kids (age 2 and 4) ADORE grilled cheese sandwiches - hated these.

This is Sooo Gooood! I did change it up a bit but this was a great beginning! I used frozen Texas Toast, thawed. I spread ricotta cheese on one slice, topped with pepperoni and then shredded mozzarella, topped it with a nother slice of toast. Baked at 375 for 7 minutes. Dipped in pizza sauce. I will be trying this with my own garlic bread also. A bit more budget friendly. I made these the night before so dinner was ready to pop in the oven. This is a keeper! Nice change!

After reading the reviews, I lowered the oven temperature to 400 and baked on the lowest rack of the oven.  It still only took about 2 1/2 minutes per side -- Just watch them.  Also, as a timesaver, I used buttery cooking spray instead of butter with great results.  Insides & outsides were perfect.  Thanks for the start of a great recipe!

I have been making my grilled cheese like this for years and you can't beat the crispness you get this way.  For an additional kick, try spreading cream cheese on the inside of one piece of bread before baking.  Cream cheese adds an unexpected richness.  My girls always make sure we have cream cheese to make grilled cheese, now!

Awesome indeed! I had all four grands yseterday & remembered this recipe when they asked for grilled cheese sandwiches for lunch. I did as suggested by the reviews & buttered it heavily along the edges of the bread & lightly in the center. I did 6 & 6 minutes but the first side wasn't quite as toasty as the second so next time I'll do 8 & 6. They tasted even better than pan-fried sandwiches! This recipe could have saved me hours over the stove if I had known about it when my kids were small. ;o) Update...I made these again & this time they were a little overcooked. Maybe I read the temp wrong last time & cooked them at a lower temp. ???? Anyway, I'll decrease the time down to 5 min next time & see how that works.

Excellent way to make multiple grilled cheese sandwiches at once with perfect coloring. When I fry them on the stovetop, I always end up burning the last ones because my pan is too hot, or the center is darker than the outside edges. These turned out perfect. I cooked the first side 6 minutes (the bottom is what browns) and then checked them at 2-3 minutes after flipping and they were ready. These also have a crispness to them that pan fried ones don't have.

I too was sick of standing at the stove forever making grilled cheeses for 5 people, took forever plus my skillets like to stick so they end up torn at times, so this worked great, the taste was even better when i did it in the oven, plus it has a crispiness to the sandwiches that i really liked, this is my new way to make grilled cheese sandwiches now, Thank you

I was looking for an alternative way to making grilled cheese in the frying pan, mine always stick and burn. This was AWESOME! I was worried they would burn because my oven runs hot, I just turned it down to 425 and cooked the first side for 5 minutes, flipped, then another 4 minutes and they turned out perfect! Can't really say I followed the recipe to a T, I just buttered the bread like normal, put 3 slices of American cheese on each (I like cheesy!), and a slice of turkey on a couple. Put foil on the baking sheet for easy clean-up. YUM!

Wow!  These were wonderful grilled cheese sandwiches -- golden, crispy bread and the cheese all melty and gooey. Even easier than using a big griddle, and not as messy. I'm saving this so I will always know at what temperature to bake them.  Thanks for sharing!

We really liked this recipe, the only reason  I did not give it 5 stars was because the browning process was great on the first side that was face down on the cookie sheet but when flipped the side on the cooking sheet did not brown very evenly --hardly at all.  If I pressed down on the sandwich once flipped that seemed to help.

These are great, I learned how to make them when I worked as a cook at a daycare.  Perfect when you need to make a lot of sandwiches quickly.

thank you for this recipe. Wish I had known how to make grilled cheese sandwiches this way when my children were young. These are so crisp on the outside and so yummy cheesy on the inside. It doesnt get any better than this.

At first I thought this was kind of funny that it was a recipe. But, after making them I realize that it is a really convenient way to cook many at the same without sitting over a stove. I am not able to get 8 on a tray, but I can do 6 at a time. And, clean up is easy because I line the try with foil. They are kind of crispy, but slightly greasy with the cheddar so American cheese can be used which helps with that slightly. I tried one with a large slice of tomato and it was excellent! They do get brown fast though, so keep an eye on them. If you make extra they taste fine the next day to.

I loved these, and so did my daughter & husband.  Because of your oven we always have to adjust the time on recipes so that wasn't a probem for me.  I loved the crispy edges, and I loved that they were all warm at once.  We made these with tomatoe soup---and I dip the grilled cheese in the soup.  Definalty good for a large number of kids!!!

Very easy to make!  Great idea!  However, I cooked for 6 minutes on each side and they burned so next time I'm going to do 4 or 5 minutes instead.

I used to have a stovetop with a cast iron grill in the middle which made perfect grilled cheese but it is gone :-(  I worked in a high school cafeteria and they made multitudes of grilled cheese this way and I'd never tried it at home.  This is the ideal sandwich.  Nice crispy even toasted bread with hot melted cheese inside.  What else could one ask for?

This is a awesome idea. I use olive oil instead of butter for my grilled cheese sandwiches. It turns out great.

The bread came out a little crunchier than soaked in butter in the pan, but it sure took less effort to bake the sandwiches in the oven!

This recipe was fantastic!  Finally we could all eat at the same time.  I usually get stuck cooking, and hearing "make mine next!" .  Thank you for sharing a wonderfully easy recipe that makes a lot of sense!

Most interesting.  Very crispy.  I'd do this again.  Some people may want more than one slice of cheese in their sandwiches, because the taste of the cheese sort of got lost for some reason.

I must say that this is the best idea ever for making large batches of grilled cheese sandwiches! No more standing over the frying pan for what seems like hours on end frying grilled cheese sandwiches! Making grilled cheese sandwiches in the oven is so quick and easy and there is hardly any mess to clean up at all,I love it! :-)

O...MA...GOD!  I was looking for a way to make numerous grilled cheeses at once. Here it is people! The bread stays nice and crispy. In my oven it only took 5 mins per side.

Wow! I made one for myself in the toaster oven for 5 mins. on one side and 3 mins. on the other.  I sprinkled garlic powder and oregano between 2 slices of havarti, it was sooo delicious!  I had never made a grilled cheese in the oven before and now I don't think I'll ever make them on the stove again!  :)

I tried this recipe again tonight - I like the idea of an oven - i can put it in there and forget about it for a few minutes.......I buttered only the edges but this time it came out "soggy" in the middle....perhaps due to adding leftover ham.  I did the 6 mins per side twice and the edges were crispy (borderline burnt) but soggy in the center.  Son loved them but I prefer the whole slice crisping up.  But it's worth the 5 starts for the fix it and forget it aspect.  I also used leftover bread machine potato bread - altho good - if slices aren't just right - this can happen...I think.

When making more than one sandwich...this is the way to go.  It is so easy and you don't have to do any of the work.  Of course you want to change up the cheeses to make the recipe suit your tastes...my favorite is a colby jack cheese.  Thanks for this great idea.

I have to give this an A+ for quickness, but its not a grilled cheese sandwich. Its more like a toasted cheese sandwich.
Good, quick but its no grilled cheese.

I do the same thing, bake in the oven. I have found that using two kinds of cheeses makes it different yet yummy! I use colby-jack and cheddar cheeses, and instead of buttering the bread, I spray both sides of the sandwich with cooking spray. It's not as greasy and it evens the color of the baking.

so I had to laugh at first when I saw a recipe for grilled cheese sandwiches but  have to say this is a great recipe. As a family of six we like to do grilled cheese sandwiches and soup for lunch or a quick dinner. I hate standing at the stove making 1 or 2 at a time everyone eats while I cook then I finally sit to eat and they are done. I liked being able to make them all at once in the oven. and the oven gave them such a great toast they were not soggy and perfect t dunck in soup! Thank you for this simple but yummy recipe!

I LOVE this method for grilled cheese!!! It is so much easier to make all of the grilled cheese sandwiches at one time. The best part is that they become perfectly crisp and evenly browned :)

I almost feel silly for rating a basic grilled cheese sandwich "recipe".  I guess I'm more rating the technique!  I've never ever thought about trying to do grilled cheese in the oven but when feeding a family of 6, this recipe has been a life-saver.  I can cook all the sandwiches at once without having to haul out my electric griddle.  Also, the flavor is amazing - perfectly browned bread and gooey, melted cheese.

This tasted so good even though I didn't use any butter! So crispy and cheesy! Like another review suggested, I baked at 400 degrees on the lowest rack for 8 minutes, then flipped and baked for 6 minutes. I also let the sandwiches bake open-faced for a while to let the cheese melting get a head start. Very satisfying and full of yum!

so much better than in a frying pan!! nothing was soggy.  great cruchy taste.  i put the sandwiches on a cooling rack on a cookie sheet.  takes longer than the frying pan of course, but well worth it and i'm glad i finally tried it after all these years!  thanks for the recipe.

I love making grilled cheese sandwiches this way! They actually taste a little different from the regular way of making grilled cheese, but still delicious! It reminds me of the ones we always had in school. This is super fast and easy. Mine were done with only 4 minutes on each side (in a gas oven). Ovens vary, so I would suggest maybe starting at around 4-5 minutes, and checking them. You can also try it with different cheeses!

I'm sure I've rated this before, but here it is again -- this is a great idea and works fantastically well to make grilled cheese for a crowd. If you use softened butter, you can also reduce the fat & fatty "texture" of traditional grilled cheese as well since you only need a thin coating of butter to make these great. Watch your sandwiches closely, as all ovens are different and 450 is hot enough to burn them up if your oven is even a hair off from the recipe submitter's. Thanks for the recipe, we love these!

Great way to make alot of sandwiches at one time. I used a whole wheat bread, and a combination of colby-jack and provolone cheese.  I baked 5 minutes per side. Very crispy and yummy!!!

How have I lived on this earth for 34 years and never thought to use the oven to make grilled cheeses?  The idea hit me out of the blue today, and so I Googled to figure out the right temp and time, and this recipe came up.  I tried it out, and they were PERFECT.  I lined my pan with foil to make clean up a snap, and I didn't even end up needing to flip them; top and bottom were perfectly done.  Maybe the foil had something to do with it?  In any case, this is how I will make grilled cheeses for my family from here on out!  Less work, less clean up, perfect done-ness....mama likey! :)

I've been making grilled cheese in a cast iron pan for years. But if I make more than 2-3 at a time, it just takes too long. I'm having a grilled cheese play date with friends and I'm so glad I came across this idea. Now I can make grilled cheese for everyone without slaving over the skillet. Yah!

I made these grilled cheese sandwiches tonight - I will never make them any other way again! These were so super easy! Don't be concerned about your bread being soggy at all - these came out perfect! I used 2 slices of American cheese per sandwich and followed the recipes exactly. Perfect!

Like the other reviews, I was surprised I had to look this type of recipe up,but I'm so glad I did.  We were having a chili luncheon at work and I needed to make enough grilled cheese sandwiches for about 10 people.  I knew I would have to do something in the oven to speed the process up.  I'm glad I looked this recipe up.  Everyone raved about the sandwiches, they were buttery, crispy, melted and golden brown to a perfection.  And the best part.  Everyone had hot grilled cheese sandwiches at the same time.

This was awesome! We love them in the oven so much better! I also used shredded mozzarella and added a little "Garlic, Garlic" and "Seasoned Salt" from Pampered Chef onto each side of the sandwiches. My daughter said it was the BEST!  I'll never make grilled cheese the old way again!

They get 5 stars. We use this recipe when we have Hot Lunch Friday at school. These are easy to make. We melt the butter and brush it on to save some time and fat.  The kids love them and we can make a whole big batch really quick.

Followed the recipe exactly, even the 8 minutes on both sides. Tasted amazing, will make when I need to feed a crowd, but I have to admit, I prefer the taste of grilled cheese on the stove top.

An excellent way to make grilled cheese sandwiches! I love grilled cheese, but I hate trying to make them in a skillet. With this method you can make multiple sandwiches all at once and they don't get soggy. I baked mine for 5 minutes on one side and 3 minutes on the other. They were a little toastier than I wanted, so next time I'll lower the time by a minute.

This came out very good.  I think I'll add more cheese and maybe some different kinds.  It was a little too crunchy so I might not cook it quite as long next time.  A great way to cook grilled cheese sandwiches!

Simply the best grilled cheese I ever had. Bread was crisp, cheese melted perfectly, used much less butter.  This will be the way I make "grilled" cheese from now on.

These were the easiest and most flavorful toasted cheese sandwiches I've ever made!  I used to watch my mom flip toasted cheese sandwiches in her cast iron skillet.  It never seemed easy or worth the effort.  These sandwiches browned evenly and nicely.  I love to dunk them in tomato or beef vegetable soup.  Thanks for sharing this very easy and yummy recipe!

Been doing this for years, nice to see this posted here. Now there is spreadable butter so life is easy but if you don't have that use melted butter that you brush on the bread. I am too impatient to wait for the butter to soften! This way the butter is evenly distributed and you don't have to worry about soggy middles. I also now use Release foil so I can be sure that there isn't any sticking. I use double cheese slices just cause we are cheese junkies. Great comfort food and we love it with tomato or veggie soup.

Finally got around to making these and they truly were awesome.  Used 2% cheese slices, a big slice of tomato (we're overloaded with tomatoes, gotta use them), a little basil.  Used butter flavor spray and just a little "light butter" around the crust (I love that stuff).  Six minutes on first side, four on the second at 425 degrees.  Came out crusty on the outside and gooey on the inside.  Just perfect and with the substitutions, very low fat/low cal/low Points!  Beats either the skillet or the broiler in my book.  Will do this again often.  Thanks.

As the other reviewers said, only butter edges & none in the middle.  I served them at kid's summer birthday party.  Great for speed, but a little too crouton-like for my taste.  Some were more than just crispy.  Those babies were hard.  I did them 4-5 on each side at 400.

I have always baked my grilled cheese so that the bread remains it's shape, it's evenly toasted and the cheese has sufficent time to melt and get all gooey!  I like to jazz it up by using different cheeses like swiss or colby and add some ham or even roast beef.  To cut back on fat and calories, I spray the bread with butter flavored Pam.

Yummy!  As my guy doesn't really fancy grilled cheese (but I do!) I but some corned beef and tomatoes and cheese in his and toasted in the oven.  He thought it was great!  I put tomatoes in my grilled cheese and it was so good.  I followed the recommendations to use less butter in the centre of the bread and more around the edges and it toasted perfectly.  Will make more sandwiches this way!

How come I never thought of this? It's so simple! I love grilled cheese sandwiches, but they are such a pain to make. This makes it effortless. Tastes as good as the skillet way...maybe even better.

I didn't feel like standing at the stove waiting so I searched for a way to use the oven. Followed the directions, only I lined my cookie sheet with foil because I wanted it to be crispy not soggy. I did 6 minutes on one side and 4.5 on side two. Came out so good. Tasted like school grilled cheese sandwiches. Yum!

I was looking for a way for Dad (who had no cooking abilities) to make lunch for the kids when I was at work and this is perfect.  We used melted butter and the kids brushed on the butter and made their own sandwiches.  Dad popped it in the oven, 6 minutes on one side and 2 minutes on the other and we had perfect grilled cheese sandwiches.

Made this tonight for the first time (after having this at a friend's this week).  Overall, this was very good - I need to play with the recipe more.  Unfortunately, I had one side "well done" after I flipped it since I cooked it on a dark cookie sheet.  I'm thinking if I hadn't, it may not have gotten so brown (after I flipped that side already).  We all liked how they weren't as soggy as regular grilled cheese and that we could all eat at the same time w/o them cooling down waiting for others to be done.  Will make again and try to perfect!

Super duper easy way to make the whole family's sandwiches all at once. These were a little drier especially on the edges due to baking, and had a little different texture than grilling, but still very tasty and no standing over the stove watching and turning sandwiches. This works. Thanks Michelle.

Grilled cheese sandwiches are always saturated with butter and far too greasy to suit me, but I broil my "toasted" cheese sandwiches.  I lightly butter the outside of the bread.  Add the cheese. In order to insure that the cheese melts properly, I keep the oven door closed for the first half of the toasting.  Once the sandwiches are flipped, I leave the oven door cracked.  Don't walk away!  These are really great!

I grew up with the open-faced version of this.  We probably had it 3 or 4 times a year and I loved it every time.  Just a slice of bread with cheese on top and possibly a slice of tomato (which I didn't appreciate as a kid, so I had the plain cheese version.)  But throw on ham, pepperoni or whatever suits you. Yummy!

I broil my grilled cheese in the oven 2 minutes each side. 12 at a time. Broil cooks fast just keep an eye on it or they will go from done to burnt quick. I owned a home daycare for 17 years and this lets you crank em out as fast as they eat them

very good.  I had some homemade dinner rolls left over so I sliced them into 3 layers doing the butter and cheddar on each layer.  I didn't bother flipping them.  Just assembled them and ate.  They were a bit soft due to the fact that I didn't flip them but we thoroughly enjoyed them.  Thanks for the post.  PS.  I felt as another poster did - silly looking for grilled cheese but it's amazing how a little twist can change the presentation.

Great way to make lots of grilled-cheese sandwiches at the same time.  They go great with a pot of chicken corn soup.  I lost track of how many my son-in-law ate.  We loved them with the cheddar cheese, as I always used Amercian cheese in the past.

This was very simple to make. I only made one sandwich for my daughter who asked for a grilled cheese in the middle of the chicken baking so I just threw this in on the bottom rack. She ate every bite.

I don't know if it was the temperature or the time but these came out BURNT. Even taking them out a few minutes early. I had to scrape the burnt part off of everyone's sandwich and then they were just your average every day grilled cheese. The only plus side is that they were done at the same time (well, almost the same time since I had to scrape the sandwiches).

This worked very well for making a lot of sandwiches at once.  They tasted just like they would if we had toasted them in a skillet.  They did require a few extra minutes on each side.  I added sliced green olives, fresh minced garlic, and thinly sliced tomatoes to some of them.  YUMMMM!

We love cooking grilled cheese this way. They turn out perfect and crispy. This heat is too high though which is why I rated this 4 stars. They go from light too dark too fast. I cook them at 420 degrees for about 6 minutes per side. I use 2 slices of cheese and a slice of meat per sandwich. Mmmm. Ham & swiss are our favorites.

I never thought to make these in the oven, these were delicious! I am HOPELESS when it comes to making grilled cheese on the stove top, I always burn them beyond help. I took the advice of another reviewer and only buttered around the crusts to prevent burning. This sandwich came out perfectly toasted and the cheese was perfectly melted. I can't believe I actually made a grilled cheese that wasn't a bit burnt!!!!!

Having raised a child who almost lived on grilled cheese sandwiches for a portion of her life, I feel like I can make a pretty darn good grilled cheese, either in a skillet or a panini maker.  I decided to give this method a try today, and I thought it made an impressive sandwich, crisp on the outside, nicely melted cheese on the inside.  Mine cooked much faster than six minutes per side, so keep an eye on them.  I wish I had known about this method all the times I had a gaggle of girls in the house to feed!

Good recipe. I've never heard of making grilled cheese in the oven, so it was a new concept. It made an amazing sandwich, but the timing was too long in my opinion. I took it out several minutes early and the edges had already started to burn. Thanks for a good lunch, though.

What a great method. Easy and clean. You can get at least 6 to 8 grilled cheese sandwiches at once (depending on the size of your baking sheet) without lugging out the electric fry pan or griddle. I had some deli ham I wanted to get rid of so actually ended up doing "Awesome Grilled Ham and Cheese Sandwiches". I didn't need to cook for as long as stated. I did on one side for 5 minutes and then flipped and only had to cook about 2 more minutes before they were very toasty and melted. I used Promise spread instead of butter with a very good result. Next time I might turn the oven temp down to 425 and see if the cook time would be closer to what the recipe calls for. I'll definitely use this method again.

I have been making grilled cheese like this for almost 18 years.  My husband taught me this way and I have never looked back.  He comes form a family that had 7 kids in the house so they needed to be able to feed alot of mouths quickly.  

It is great with added bacon or ham nad/or tomatoe slices.

The entire family loved these.  Used thick whole wheat bread, buttered only the crusts and used cream cheese on one side as another reviewer suggested.  Cooked at 375 for five minutes on each side and they were perfect.  Not greasy, not burnt, just absolutely perfect.

I was so happy with how these turned out! I love grilled cheese sandwiches, but making them (especially if you're doing more than one) can be such a pain. These turned out so crispy and not greasy at all. I will be making my grilled cheese sandwiches this way from now on. Thank you!

I can't say that I ever thought I'd be reviewing a grilled cheese sandwich, especially since I've been making them for 40 years, but I couldn't help myself.  I never baked a grilled cheese in the oven before, but it turned out better than when I cook it on the stove!  Very crispy!  I spritzed with Olive oil instead of butter, and added some deli turkey.  Crispy and delicious!

Mmmm - melty!! I've never had such a great grilled cheese sandwich, and it couldn't be easier! I like the idea that I can make many at once, too. I cooked mine at 400 degrees for 5 minutes, then turned it, and then cooked it for 4 more minutes. That was brown enough for my persoal tastes, and the cheese was so melted! Yum!

thanks a bunch for such a great idea!  For an even quicker dinner, I've made these "open" (each slice of bread butter side down on the sheet) so that I don't have to turn them.  I put ham or turkey on half the bread slices, cheese on the other half and then put them together after taking them out of the oven.  I have also found that I can bake them at 350 or 375 with nice results.  You could make a nice sandwich in your toaster oven using this recipe's technique. --super!

We didn't think these were a great alternative to grilled cheese sandwiches.  I say, buy a large griddle and you can grill at least 6 sandwiches at a time and also put at least 2 pieces of cheese on each sandwich.

I made this recipe some time ago and just forgot to review it. Sorry, Michelle. You and your husband came up with a fabulous idea. We have five kids and this makes our life so much easier. I think it makes grilled cheese sandwiches better than the ones you make on the stovetop.

Although I loved the convienence of everyone getting to eat a hot sandwhich at the same time, I wasn't truly impressed with the way these turned out.  They were definitely more 'done' then I prefer them and most of the cheese seemed to disappear.

This recipe was great!  I made perfect grilled cheese sandwiches in 1/9 the time!  My kids loved them because - finally - I didn't burn their grilled cheese sandwiches on the stove!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a great idea!  My family loves grilled cheeses, but I rarely fix them for a "family meal" because we can't all sit down together for the meal and everyones still be hot.  Plus, there are 5 in our family so I end up spending forever standing at the stove.  Thanks for this great idea!

I love this recipe, as it is so hard when you are trying to cook for a family and yet you can only cook one sandwich at a time.

I have one suggestion, and that is to place tin foil on top of the sandwiches and then place another baking sheet onto the tin foil, and there you go no need to flip the sandwich. 

Gotta have some yummy soup to accompany these sandwiches.

Made 12 baked grilled cheese sandwiches last night. They were the bomb diggity. So quick, easy and no greasy fingers. Heated the other half of mine up in the microwave some hours later and it wasn't soggy. Wonderful.

Use 2 slices of cheese. Cook 6 minutes on 1st side, 3 minutes on the other or it will be burnt.

This is the first grilled cheese I've been able to pull off. Its delicious and very easy. Plus, with foil and paper plates, there's no dishes to clean! 

Others have said to make sure the butter goes to the edges; so, they don't brown too much. I'll try this next time as the edges are a bit crispy.

Excellent and crispy!  Be sure oven is preheated to the right temp.  Mine takes almost 20 minutes to get to 450 degrees.  Next time I will cook on middle rack and flip over after 3 minutes since the bottom tried to burn too quickly.  Also, I think I will butter the outside edges of the bread and add very little in center to keep the "crispiness".  Love this way of making a grilled cheese sandwich!

I too never had a grilled cheese out of a frying pan until High school - there were 7 of us all together so we too made our "grilled" cheese in the oven.  We called them though Toasted Cheese .. and they're marvelous.  At home now, we do them in the toaster oven - there's just the 3 of us - and we just call them "toasties" now :)  We'll occasionally add a slice of tomato, or a bit of ham, scallions... whatever just never more than whatever cheese we're using... I personally prefer monterey pepper jack... with tomato..
and doing them open face under the broiler for just a minute, closing them and then just toasting in the toaster oven... YUMMMMMMY Thanks so much for submitting :)

I've been making baked grilled cheese sandwiches for about six months now.  I love the golden brown all over appearance.  Best to cook on a piece of stoneware instead and then there is no need for flipping them half way through the baking process.  I like using different cheeses that I slice off of a brick of cheese.  Fresher tasting and I can change it up so many ways.  Grilled Swiss and cheddar is my favorite.

This recipe is only good if you have a bunch to make. The crispy part is good to dip in tomato soup thats why I gave it 2 stars. Other than that I will stick to the fry pan ! 1 piece of cheese ?? Are you serrrrious ?

Yes, making them in the oven on a baking sheet & rack, especially when you have several to make is a brilliant idea....they don't get soggy as they can in a skillet.

I use coconut oil instead of butter and put the sandwich on a sheet or even a frying pan, but I use the top broiling element (about 3 inches away from sandwich). No soggy bottoms and it gives the toasted bread a really different texture. If I use a frying pan I can just leave the oven door open with the handle sticking out and don't even have to use oven mitts to handle anything!

The bread was crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle which was great but it needed more cheese.  One slice was not enough.

Great idea to bake it but just not enough cheese - you are eating mostly bread.  Try adding a slice of mozzarella and a slice of swiss.
Taste nice and cheesy with three cheeses....

This is a brilliant idea. My husband and I made these last night with texas toast, aged cheddar smoked gouda, and some assorted scraps of diced leftover meat. They were fantastic. I cooked them at 400 degrees for 7 minutes on each side. I was afraid they would burn but they didn't. Each side was crisp and perfectly brown.

very awesome! I was looking up oven grilled cheese because I didn't want to stand over the stove for a long while, and this totally fit the bill! For a little zing, you can put a tomato in between two slices of cheese. It's very good :)

AWESOME! BUT I had to change it a little. If you want more of a "grown up taste" do as follows:  Added grated garlic and grated Parmesan cheese to the butter mixture. YUMMMMM

I'm not sure what happened on my end, but the grilled cheese sandwiches did not turn out as mentioned in the recipe.  The recipe said to bake the sandwich for 6 to 8 minutes on each side, but the bottoms burnt when only baking the sandwich on the one side for 6 mins.  I will try again, but possibly tweak the stove temperature next time.  Thanks!

Very Good, the only changed I made was to add a little more cheese. My favourite thing about this is both sides were evenly browned unlike in the pan,  I will never make grilled cheese in a pan again.

I used this method of cooking my grilled cheese tonight and let me just say that I will NEVER go back to cooking them in a pan again! I cannot believe how perfect these came out-crispy, buttery and ooey gooey delicious. This is my new and only method from now on! Thanks for sharing. :)

This is a fabulous way to make grilled cheese, whether for a crowd or just one. I often make these in the toaster oven for myself for lunch (temp @ 400, no need to flip, but watch carefully as it might cook faster than in the oven), and I love them. They are crispier than pan-fried grilled cheese, which makes them a hit in my book. Thanks so much!

I love grilled cheese, but when I make them for the whole family it always ended up getting smoky and taking forever to do them in a pan...this way always turns out perfectly melted and browned grilled cheeses!!!! and SO easy!

I'm so glad we looked for a recipe!We did 2 on a cooling rack and 2 on the pan.  The cooling rack adds time to brown by at least 2 more minutes. Either way great!

I only looked at this recipe for a goof, thinking "now, how can anybody not know how to make a grilled cheese sandwich?"  But to my amazement, this cooking method blew me away!  So crunchy and yummy - and many possiblities for meat and cheese sandwiches, too.   Like so many others, I'll never go back to pan-frying again!

OMG these were AWESOME!!! I was craving grilled cheese sandwiches and was wondering if there was a quicker, easier way to make them....and here it is! My 4 year old even noticed the difference! She said "Mommy, how did you cook these?" LOL! These are the crispiest, tastiest GC sandwiches I've ever had, I'll never go back to pan frying them. Thanks so much!

Now this is the way to make grilled cheese sandwiches! We were out for swimming lessons tonight but I prepped these beforehand so they were ready in a jiffy when we got home and everyone could eat at once. I put apple slices on the kid ones and tomato and fancier cheese on the adult ones. Very yummy.

Awesome! Always made them on the stove but this makes making multiple sandwiches so simple.  The cheese was always cooked through and the the bread was nice and crisp without being soggy.  I also only cooked for 5 min. on each side.

We liked these. The cheese gets evenly melted and they don't seem as greasy as the stove top way. But the crust IS crunchier this way, if you like that and I did concentrate the butter on the edges.

What a great recipe.  So much easier to make grilled cheese sandwiches in quantity.  The come out much crispier than usual.

I used one slice cheddar, one slice provolone, a thin slice of fresh tomatoe, and some italian seasonings...on bakery white bread.  Delicious!

This was A LOT simpler then standing over the stove as you grill the sandwiches....unless you have a griddle and can do all of the sandwiches at once. I made this with ham and cheese and the kids loved it.

I raised 8 farm fed kids, and believe me, grilled cheese was always a favorite. We made all kinds of sandwiches and open faced sandwiches on the cookie sheet in the oven.  It's the best way to do it with a large family.  We also loved open face with peanut butter, or with cheese, or with brown sugar and cinnamon and all these were on top of a thin spread of butter. Sometimes I put the oven on bake and sometimes on broil.  I also made a concoction of crab and mayo, onions, boiled eggs and cheese for an open faced sandwich in the oven.  Another quick hint for busy parents of large families, you can serve almost anything edible wrapped in a tortilla.

I work in a school cafeteria and this is how we make our grilled cheese. I tried it at home & now my family doesn't want it any other way. The bread gets nice and toasty and cheese all melty.

Yum! Grilled cheese sandwiches are one of those meals I somewhat "overdid" in college, so I never have the urge... but my husband still does! So I decided to make these just for him - but we both really enjoyed them and they are SUPER easy! Thanks!

I felt a little silly reading a recipe about grilled cheese sandwiches, but this recipe is great!  We have between 4 and 8 kids in the house at any given time, so this recipe will come in very handy.  Thanks!

Thanks for the great idea!  I don't know why I never thought of it.  I'll never make grilled cheese on the stove again.  It came out perfectly even, which it never does on the stove, the cheese was melted perfectly and it was much less greasy.  I added bacon to mine.  Also, 5 min. per side in a 400 degree oven was perfect.  Thanks again!

I make my "grilled cheese" sandwiches like this all the time.  I don't usually use butter though, just to save some calories.  It is nice to add some extra flavor, but the bread gets crispy enough (for me) without it.  Try adding fresh tomatoes in the summer, or some thinly sliced deli meat if you have it around.

Used American instead of cheddar. Simple to prepare, nice when you have a big group of kids (or adults) to feed at one time.

Tasted great.  I like the idea of baking grilled cheese instead of frying it in a pan.  Its easier and you can make more at one time.

I tried this recipe last night and it was great! I did make a few changes though... nothing big. I didn't have cheddar cheese so I used american cheese slices instead and they still tasted delicious. I tried to soften the butter and ended up melting it and then kind of dunking the slices in the butter which made the crusts really yummy. (Probably not the healthiest!) I also put the oven at 375 and cooked for 6 min on each side and they were perfect. I am never making grilled cheese on the stove again. thanks!

This is a very good idea! I did what other people did I put them on at 350 degrees. Worked well for me. I have 7 kids to cook for, so this was fast and easy. I didn't have to stand at the oven forever. That's nice considering I am pregnant. I will try this with french toast.

These were fine, nothin special, but I guess most grilled cheese is about the same! :) Just a warning- if you are using a toaster oven, reduce the heat so that you don't burn the bread because it is much closer to the heating element! Otherwise, these were quick and crunchy, quite nice, but you still have to keep an eye on them like you would if they were in a skillet.

This technique is a huge timesaver for me...with 5 kids it takes FOREVER to make enough grilled cheese.  This cuts the time in half.

This is a great idea. We made grilled cheese sandwiches for a church function. I was dreading standing by the stove flipping endless sandwiches. So we tried the oven method. We baked them at 375, 400 seemed a bit hot. I flipped the sandwiches after 5 or 10 minutes, and they were done in about 15 to 20 minutes.  The sandwiches that were on a darker cookie sheet browned a lot faster and nicer than the ones on the shiny sheets. I ended up transferring the unbrowned ones to the dark sheet for a few minutes to finish them off.

 We used thinly slice colby longhorn cheese (that’s what was left from a buffet dinner earlier in the week), squishy white bread, and soft margarine. I sprayed the baking sheets with a non-stick spray and had almost no problem with the sandwiches sticking (a couple stuck a bit where melted cheese escaped from the bread).

This is a great idea for making LOTS of grilled cheese sandwiches, not sure it’s worth heating up the entire oven to make just a couple. I’ll bet these would work well in a toaster oven.

These are good!  Mine were nice and crunchy.  I'll make them again if I already have the oven on or am making multiple sandwiches.  However, it still seems easier to fry the sandwich on the stove top if I'm only making one or two.

I baked these at 425 degrees, rack at lowest position, for 6 minutes on the first side and 4 minutes on the second side.  Here's a general grilled cheese tip -- try a sprinkle of freshly ground pepper to the cheese when assembling.  It sounds weird, but it tastes great!  Thanks, Michelle.

Best way I know for making a large number of sandwiches with very little effort.  May want to trim the crust for kids before baking, but I like the crunchy brown crust!  These are not too greasy and so easy!

I didn't have any problem with the crust burning because I used Ironkids Crustless and it was wonderful.  I might use Parkay spray next time instead of the butter for a little less fat.

Even after reading all of the reviews & adjusting the oven temp & cooking time & buttering more around the edges - mine were too burnt around the edges and way too DRY. Maybe if you use 3 cheese slices per sandwich, you might get a moist sandwich. It's a great idea, but I don't think I will try this again. Sorry.

What a neat idea.  We do a lot of grilled cheese onthe weekends for a quick lunch.  Sometimes I use american, cheddar and even swiss.  For a little change, we will also add slice of ham, deli turkey breast, or crisp bacon.

I'm sorry but these were awful. Who wants only 1 slice of cheese? I used ham and 4 slices of cheese. Maybe my toaster oven isn't any good but the sides never got brown and all the cheese melted out. Also, it took FOREVER. I'll be sticking with the frying pan.

I love this so much because I can make multiple sandwiches and serve them hot all at once. I find my oven runs a little hotter so I Pre-Heat mine to 425 and only cook them for 5-6 mins on each side. Otherwise they burn and aren't that tasty.  I've even added shredded Parmesan to the outside for a nice toasted cheesy crust.

Baking the sandwiches on a silicone mat cuts down on the amount of butter necessary, which makes for easier cleanup.

Such a great hack to make multiple sandwiches simultaneously.  Like other reviewers, I let half the sandwich bake open-faced for a few minutes to help the cheese melt before adding the second pieces of bread, and I also buttered around the edge but left the middle dry.  Sprinkled some garlic powder and chives in between slices of cheddar and munster as well.  Sliced the sandwiches into strips for dipping into tomato soup -- perfect!

Where has this been all my life?!  My family loves grilled cheese with tomato soup but it's such a pain when you're feeding a small army of boys that wants 2-3 sandwiches each! I made 12 sandwiches at once, perfectly golden and toasty. Mom even got a hot sandwich and soup at the same time as everyone else!  Never going back to the skillet again!  Perfection! 
 Thank you!!

Works really well, I find that if you butter both sides of the bread you get a creamier finished product as the butter and cheese mingle.

This is the only way I make grilled cheese now! SO EASY! I change it up and use different cheeses, add meat, add tomatoes or mustard... everyone gets whatever they want and it's hard to mess up!

So tasty and practical; I "grilled" 12 sandwiches simultaneously! As recommended by another reviewer, I kept the top slice of bread off to allow the cheese to melt properly. Also, I got nervous because it was toasting so slowly, I turned the broiler on for final toasting. Final note (which matters) I used white bread --which means we will have grilled cheese sandwiches for a couple of days since we never eat white bread. Super recipe!

This did not work for me AT ALL...and I'm interested in fellow opinions on how to make it actually work! I invited a bunch of people over to watch Outlander and was making grilled cheese and tomato bisque to go with it. 

I buttered the bread, put it on a cooling rack over a cookie sheet and got the oven all heated. The bread was HUGE, farmstyle bread from safeway, and because of this I added three thin slices of cheese. I added two cheddar and one havarti slice. 

So far so good, was very excited for some large, gourmet grilled cheese to serve with bisque. Shoved 'em into the oven, and baked for 8 minutes. Nothing happened. 

I doubled the time, flipped the sandwiches, nothing happened except the cheese melted in a gooey puddle. I panicked, and turned on the broiler and broiled them arduously by flipping the pan around so the edges wouldn't get too burnt. 

After about 10 minutes of broiling I succeeded, with some very burnt edges. They tasted good, all the flavors were there, and everyone was very gracious about the burnt ends. 

But I am very disappointed it didn't work.

My oven must run "hot" (no pun intended), but 7 minutes per side yielded burnt toast for me.  Next time, I'll try about 4 per side.  Oh, and on the middle rack, too!

I’ve done this his twice now and the boys love it every time! Whenever the boys & hubs are sick I make a bone broth chicken noodle soup and grilled cheese but individual grilled cheeses take a long time and a big mess - this is the perfect way to bulk make sandwiches so we can all eat together with minimal clean ups :) thank you!

I followed the recipe exactly and loved the results. The bread was nice and crisp and the cheese perfectly melted, plus this was less time consuming than standing over the griddle. This will definitely be my preferred method for making grilled cheese.

Like others suggested, I put butter on only the crust.
I cooked mine on 400
I cooked mine for 1 minute open, then 4 minutes, then flipped and cooked for another 5 minutes,
So good, So crunchy

Awesome & easy recipe.  Made it for dinner last night and it came out great.  No standing by the stove and not having a big enough frying pan for 3 or more grilled cheese sandwiches.  I made it 2% American cheese (dietary restrictions) and added sliced tomatoes and pepper to it.  Served with a side of salad & eggplant fries.

Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe as this is a keeper in my recipe file.

Absolutely love It! The family enjoyed them. I followed directions exactly and also watched carefully they came out perfect. I brushed a little melted butter on them for more buttery taste. Will make again.

Maybe I did something wrong.  I'm not sure.  But this took longer than just pan frying.  The bread just would not brown...  I'm not sure if I did too much butter or what.  I'll just stick to the griddle in the future

I just made my boyfriend and I grilled cheese sandwiches in the oven. I made it this way years ago but couldn't remember at what temperature to set my oven. I made them at 400 but it took much longer, like 10 minutes each side. Next time I will try 425.  You really need to see what temp is right with your oven. Also everyone was right, make sure you don't put a lot of butter in the middle and more around the crust. I baked one slice of buttered bread with 2 slices of American cheese first, then flipped it with the second slice of buttered bread face down. This is truly the best way to make grilled cheese!

Oh my goodness. This is the BEST grilled cheese sandwich EVER!!!! Instead of Cheddar cheese I used Muenster and Provolone, WOW! I love putting them in the oven because they all get the perfect golden brown crunch and I could make 6 at one time!!!  I will definitely be using this way exclusively from now on.

I use cheddar cheese and a little bit of pepper jack shreds to give it a little kick. Was definitely delicious and a lot easier than trying to pan fry/cook them.

For my oven, need to bake 6 minutes on each side.  I used cheddar and Swiss cheese - yummy.  8 minutes  is too much for my oven - almost burned.  Will do again soon.

I made this with kings Hawaiian rolls because I love sweet and salty, but I found the temperature to be too high for that bread. I lowered it to about 400 ~ 425  about 4 min in and flipped it at 6 min and only cooked it for  about 4 to 5 more min. Next time I think I will heat to 400 or 375 and go from there. But I'm really happy I found this recipe that gave me a good starting point.

Worked very well.  Very easy to make several sandwiches at one time.  Make sure to keep an eye on the sandwiches in the last few minutes.  I just set the timer for 6 minutes and didn't check the sandwiches and they almost burned.

I know I know...we all see this recipe and think "who the heck needs a recipe to make basic grilled cheese??"  Boy was I fooled.  I'm one who always stands over the pan at the stove making each persons order individually (and with 4 kids plus hubby and myself, that can be a time consuming procedure).  So, even though I was slightly skeptical, I was none the less very happy to stumble upon this oh so easy recipe.  THANK GOODNESS I DID!  Oh these were the BEST!  Why have I never thought of baking them in the oven?!  I have switched to preparing so many other things in the oven for convenience and for health benefit reasons, but the grilled cheese never crossed my mind.  THANK YOU for pointing out foolishness to me and awakening me to my new method of preparing crispy, gooey, yummy grilled cheese!  They were PERFECT!  I used one slice of American cheese and one slice of mozzarella cheese on each and they were absolutely divine.  Crunchy and crisp from edge to edge outside and perfectly melty inside.  YUM YUM!  Thank you so much for making my life easier and more delicious!

These were so nice to serve cut into triangle halves with a bowl of soup.  They were crispy on the outside just like it says and ooey gooey inside.  I used what cheese I had, which meant I sliced off the block of cheddar and made a second layer with a slice of baby Swiss.  Baked 6 min, then flipped and baked 3 more minutes got them just right in my oven.  Hubby and son got home late from ball practice, and theirs was still perfect after I nuked in the microwave 30 seconds.

This is the best way to make a prefect grilled cheese sandwich!  Finally a wonderfully crispy, not greasy, outside and a gooey center.  I used fresh mozzarella, slices tomatoes and fresh basil and it was fantastic!!  This is the only way from now on.

This is an amazing recipe! So quick and you get to make multiple at once. I always hated pan frying them. Instead of using butter I used mayo and they were yum yum yummy!!

So glad I came across this recipe. We are a family of 5 so it's nice to get all the sandwiches cooked at once. They crisp up beautifully.  I've also done this with lunch meat too, for grilled turkey and cheese. Delicious.

I use Parkay Butter/Margarine Spray in the blue pump bottle for a less greasy sandwich and it saves calories. We've been doing this for years because we love them this way (just like they made at grade school) I also fry my bacon in the oven its much easier and cleaner. But back to the Grilled Cheese I like the crunchy toasty bread and the warm melty cheese. Plus you aren't standing around the stove burning your sandwiches trying to hurry them up for a crowd of hungry people.

This isn't special at all. This is how my mom always made it at home. Compensating for the type of bread is easy: whole wheat/brown/rye/etc bread requires a lower temperature and longer time to melt the cheese, white/Parisienne/etc bread can be made at a higher temperature and is cooked when the bread is golden. Also depends on your cheese. Processed cheese tend to melt faster and combining several types of cheese (I like cheddar, mozzarella, and Parmesan in mine) requires more time.

Love it!!  Set oven to 400 degrees, put one buttered slice of bread and the cheese first and cooked for 3 min, added the top and cooked for 3 more minutes and then flipped and cooked for 3 more minutes!  Came out perfect!!!

Definitely as good as it looks. We don't buy processed cheese slices, so I ran some old cheddar and monterey jack through the shredder blade of my food processor, and used the blended shreds.

2nd time using this recipe in a month!! Plenty of other things (sides and drinks) able to get done by this is done too. The kids get to choose what cheese and breads so everything is made just for them. I'm even putting one child's milk-free cheese on his this time. Just needed a new recipe for our extra-large family, skillet or griller wasn't working any more.

Maybe its just me, but I like to try the recipes as submitted- but 1 piece of cheese? More like grilled bread with a little cheese on it! One piece of cheese does not even cover 1 whole slice of bread. Sorry maybe just me- even for my son who is 2 yrs old i use 1 and and half slices of cheese!

They are awesome! I just don't like how the bread gets crumbly, in the oven. I'll stick to the stove top method. But thanks for another alternative!

I can't believe I didn't think of baking grilled cheese sandwiches until today! I am a mother of 4 and wife to a big husband, and when most people think of grilled cheese sandwiches they think cheap and fast. I think cheap and at least an hour cooking 1 or 2 at a time for everyone. I will never use a frying pan for a grilled cheese again! I thought about baking them, but had no idea about temperatures and times. This is a great recipe to give you an idea about how long and at what temperatures to cook them. Now that I know how to do it the possibilities are endless!! Thanks Michelle!

My friends said they were the best "grilled" cheese sandwiches they have ever eaten.  So much healthier and easier to make, too.  I added canned mild green chilies to some of the sandwiches.  Yum!  Because you're not cooking the sandwiches in batches on a grill or in a pan, you can serve everyone at the same time.  Pair it with "Jersey Fresh Tomato Soup" and it's a wonderful "comfort" meal!

Definitely the easiest way to make a lot of grilled cheese at once, I usually just use the broiler and flip them over a few times during the cooking process to ensure nothing gets too hard, dark or crispy.  The trick is to watch them while they're cooking and you'll end up with perfect grilled cheese :)

Loved this method of making "grilled" cheese sandwiches.  I made ham and cheese sandwiches, and this is the only way I will make them in the future.  Less mess. More control.

Not a bad way to make many grilled cheese sandwiches. Use to make them either via a buttered griddle, four at a time, or by the skillet method, fried with a couple pats of butter in the skillet.  May I suggest try using regular or Mexican flavored Velveeta, thick sliced equal to two or three slices of American cheese. The oven method is so much easier. Just adjust your time to the desired crispness of the bread. - Gerald, a Mom taught and former Army cook.

In my family, we always called these toasted cheese rather than grilled cheese and we've been having them since the 1950's.  I agree that it is so much easier than grilling umpteen sandwiches for a large family. My daughter liked to use mayo instead of butter, which gives one a slightly different flavor and, as mentioned by others, adding other things just gives it all an extra punch.

This is the way my mother always made them when we were kids growing up.  They always turned out perfect too, crisp and golden and never burnt.  I remember they were extremely warm when she pulled them out and she would warn us to let them cool a bit so we wouldn't burn our mouths with the melted cheese.  Of course tomatoe soup would always accompany these sandwiches.

My mom has been doing her grilled cheese in the oven since I was a young girl (45+ years).  Definately the way to go when preparing more than 2 or 3 sandwiches!!

I have been making my grilled cheese sandwiches this way for 30 years.  Picked up the trick from the cafeteria ladies.  Its the only way they can cook grilled cheese for hundreds at a time.  I love it done this way.  The crunchy toast is just what I like.

Baking grilled cheese sandwiches are nothing new for our family. My Mom always baked them when I was a little girl. Plus one piece of cheese isn't enough. We make ours with different cheeses, cheddar and Brie. Or cheddar and provolone. Whatever you like. I also put red onions and tomatoes on mine before I bake. They are delicious.

This is without question the best and most useful (as well as obvious -- why didn't I think of this?) idea I've ever gotten from a recipe website, bar none. Nice golden brown, crunchy bread, cheese perfectly melted!  It didn't look like someone had backed over it with a steamroller, and it wasn't all greasy.  What an idea!

I'm getting over a cold and didn't feel like standing over the stove, so I used this recipe to make two sandwiches just for myself. They came out perfectly! I cooked them on the first side for about 6 minutes, and on the second side for about 4. The results were actually better than I generally get when cooking on the stove top since I tend to burn them. I'll definitely be using this in the future, both when I'm cooking for a bunch of people and when I'm just cooking for myself.

These are indeed Awesome!!!  I watch 4-6 grandkids during the Summer and this recipe was the bomb!  All the kids loved them and it was so easy for me.  I used real butter and 2 pieces of cheese on each sandwich.  My 9 year-old grandson asked me to please give this recipe to his mom.  Delicious!  Thank you!

I took one of the suggestions to use a rack in the pan.  That worked out great and got both sides evenly toasted.  I don't think I'll ever do grilled cheese on the stove-top again!

These are excellent, I added tomato to mine just because I love tomato.  I didn't grow up eating grilled cheese so I was never very fond of it, the few times I had it I found it soggy and greasy but baking them takes all that away so you're left with a crispy, buttery, cheesy and delicious sandwich.  I highly recommend these.

I never thought there was an actual recipe for a grilled cheese sandwich, I laughed when I read it- but this worked out great! I liked that I didn't have to smoke up the whole house to make it! I only gave it 2 stars because as good as it worked, it's not the best. It dries out a bit too quick in the oven, and I am not a fan of the really crunchy ones. I might make this again, but only when I don't want to worry about the smoke alarm going off!

These turned out perfect!  They don't seem as greasy as when grilled on the stove.  This recipe is such a time saver.. it's so nice to be able to sit down and eat a grilled cheese sandwich with the entire family rather than stand at the stove forever making several batches at a time  and be the last person to enjoy one.   Thanks for posting this, Michelle!

If you are looking to make several grilled cheese sandwiches quickly then this is the recipe for you.  My three children enjoyed the crunchy outside and cheesy inside.  Would make again, but would probably use real cheddar instead of the processed cheese slices I had in the fridge.  Cooked for 7 minutes on each side at 425.  I think 450 would have burned them.

Yum! I followed others' advice and lightly buttered the main part of the bread, but spread heavier butter on the crust. I was using two pieces of cheese per sandwich, so I baked each piece of bread cheese side up (one piece of cheese per bread slice). I cooked them for about 8 mins in my toaster oven, checking the bread periodically as the time counted down. Once the bread was lightly crispy, I put light mayo on each piece of cheese and put the sandwiches together. I then switched to broil and after about 30 seconds on each side, they were beautiful! Thank you for the yummy recipe.

YUM!! I baked them for 5 minutes, flipped, and then baked for 3 more. They were not golden on the bottom when I flipped them, but they continue to brown after you flip them over. LOVE how crunchy these are.

YUM!  Even my kids who don't like grilled cheese (can you believe it??)  liked these.  I was skeptical that these would be different, but they are!  So crunchy & yummy.  We like to throw some pepper-jack cheese in with the cheddar every now and then to spice it up a bit.

Thought I'd try this technique using the toaster oven because I was only making 2 sandwiches. My 3-yr-old and I enjoyed ours with Muenster and ham. Although not superior to traditional stovetop or griddle-grilled cheese, I like this alternative, especially for a crowd. Looking forward to serving various grilled sandwiches using this method.

If I'm feeding myself I still prefer it it in the pan but with a total of 6 of us, this is the way to do it!! I got "oooh's and ahhh's" all around. The kids and my other half all loved it and I was IMPRESSED!! Thank you so much for a wonderful recipe!

Great way to make grilled cheese!!!  I didn't have to bake these for 6-8 on both sides.  Mine cooked in under 10 minutes.  So, keep a close eye on those sandwiches b/c they may burn.  Otherwise, PERFECT!

Try using fresh Mozzarella or Provolone to make this a little healthier. Cheddar is very high in sodium and provolone is almost always a better option for anything! :)

I don't know why I never thought of it but thank you for the great idea. We have a large family and frying individual sandwiches took forever. Add bacon, tomato, apple or whatever. Thank you again for the time saving idea.

These grilled cheese sandwiches were PERFECT! I did about 7 minutes the first time, then about 5 minutes when I flipped them over. They were nice and crunchy and definitely NOT soggy like when cooked on the stove. Will definitely be making again.

This recipe is so good!  The kids still like the plain version.  But the grown ups like to add: italian seasoning, granulated or fresh garlic and mrs. dash in the butter mix.  Add ham, turkey, roast beef or canadian bacon.

I used to LOVE the school cafeteria grilled cheese and was always dissapointed that mine never turned out that good at home. Now I know why!! The oven gives the sandwich the perfect amount of crispiness to bring back the memories of why I loved school grilled cheese so much growing up! The only change I made was to add some garlic salt to the outside buttered pieces of bread. Yum! This is the only way I will make grilled cheese from now on.

This is the first time I have tried grilled cheese in oven, and I loved it. Not only was the time issue solved while making several sandwiches, but they were much cripier then pan grilling them.

We made these with sourdough bread, extra sharp cheddar & a couple of cherry tomatoes. Younger cooks can even help make their own.

Add some chopped fruit on the side and you’ve got a delicious dinner on the table in less than 20 minutes!

Why in the world has this never occurred to me and/or why haven't I heard of it until now?!?!  Of COURSE!!!  This is the only way I'll ever make grilled cheese from now on.  HOORAY!  Bonus: no more squished, deformed bread from the spatula-they're perfectly square every time.  Awesome.

I just finished making and eating these with my 2 year old and 4 year old . . . YUM! They turned out PERFECT! I cooked them 5 minutes on each side. I always hated standing in the kitchen to make grilled cheese, it's not easy with a 4, 2 and 9 month old. THIS IS THE ANSWER!!!! I will make them this way from now on! Thanks!
Sligh veriation: 
For my kids' grilled cheese, I added hotdogs and pickles.
For my grilled cheese, I added onion and saurkraut . . . AMAZING!

Great way to make grilled cheese. Much better than making it in a skillet. To make the best grilled cheese I recommend using a high quality butter like Kerrygold. It really makes a difference.

I made this as a last minute addition to dh's dinner as he's a big lover of a grilled cheese sandwich. He said that it's 4 1/2. Thanks for the recipe.

This is how I will fix grill cheese from now on. So easy my 9 and 10 yr old can do it. Great I'm not cooking but still getting it done food. To me it is the best grill cheese I have ever made. LOL

Method of baking is good. Careful not to use too much cheese (for my liking). Add tomato and/or bacon.

I absolutely love baked grilled cheese now. I never thought of baking it. It makes such a huge difference. So crispy and good. I like to put a slice of American as well as some shredded chedder or swiss. Yum...

These are the BEST!  However, I didn't have to turn them.  They were not brown on the bottom after 6 minutes so I left them in for another 3 minutes and they were perfect on both sides.  I used a foil lined cookie sheet not a not stick.  I will never make them stove top again!  Thanks!

I never thought about putting grilled cheese in the oven before, but it works really well. I also, like another reviewer, didn't need to cook it for as long on either side. However, I think that one slice of cheese is really not enough; it didn't bring out much of the cheddar flavor.

Yummy! Exactly what I've been wanting but wasn't sure how to get. After the sandwich is flipped, watch closely. It should not take another 6 to 7 minutes. It is too done if it is on that long. Excellent!

My husband and I wanted to use our toaster oven. We set our toaster oven to "bake" as opposed to "toast, grill or broil".  Followed the recipe exactly and we came up with perfect grilled cheese sandwiches.  I loved them and my husband liked them.  He said he prefers greesy grilled cheese sandwiches...maybe I will add more butter next time and I will use the "GRILL" feature on my toaster oven.  Thanks for the recipe.

An easy & un-messy way to make grilled cheese. I used Light Oat Bread from this site and Tillamook cheddar cheese. I liked the different kind of crispiness that baking lends to the sandwich, and the cheese melted nicely with some little drips off the side of the bread--YUM!

I'm apparently not a "think out of the box" kind of person because it never dawned on me to try making grilled cheese anyway but stovetop.  What a nice convenient way to make a bunch of them at once.  They do get crispy around the edges (my kids' only complaint) but definately worth making this way again.

I love this easy way to make grilled cheese especially when you need to make several. I do cut down on the butter a bit, and they turn out crisp and tasty! I have added diced tomato, or sliced turkey and even mushrooms! Thanks for a new way to make an old time favorite!!

If you don't like soggy grilled cheese, then this is definitely the recipe for you.  THe first batch I made, I cooked as called for and they were a little over-done.  The second batch, I cooked about 4-5 minutes each side and it was perfect.

And to think all these years I was unnecessarily making a mess on the stove.  These came out wonderful.  I didn't need to flip them for some reason.  It took 11 minutes on my stove but then both sides were beautifully toasted, scrumptious, and with no mess!

I laughed when I saw a recipe for grilled cheese, then I decided to try the method of cooking used in this recipe. I give the idea of baking in the oven 5 stars. My way was good but very greasey. I love the way the sandwiches turn out. If you have not tried this I would say try it! This is the only way I will make grilled cheese from now on.

These were really good...and a lot easier than stove-top grilled cheese if you're making several at one time.  The bread came out really crunchy, which I liked.  I've also made this with tuna salad and cheese for a tuna melt.

I love grilled cheese sandwiches, it reminds me of being a kid. I used shredded cheddar and shredded swiss and left the sandwich open first to melt the cheese for about three minutes(because I used a lot) and then cooked both sides. I used whole wheat bread because that is the only bread I eat. It was great!

This is a really great way to make grilled cheese sandwiches! I must say I enjoyed the crust on these sandwiches alot more than I would other sandwiches. I think I put a little too much butter on my bread though cause it was a bit oily but it was still so yummy. Definitely making these again!

I thought to myself why would you need to post a recipe for grilled cheese but what a great idea to be able to cook a few sandwiches at the same time.  These come out the same if not better than when you cook it in a skillet or a griddle.  The edges come out crispier. Really good !!!

Why did I never think of making them this way??  This recipe is awesome.  It let me make grilled cheese sandwiches for all the kids at the same time.  No more taking turns doing a couple at a time in the skillet.  Thanks for the new method!

What a great idea!  The cheese sandwiches taste just like those grilled in a pan, but are much easier to make, especially on busy nights.  We vary the types of cheese and bread depending on what we have in the house, but you can't go wrong with gooey melted cheese and the crunchy, buttery toast!  We make this recipe at least every few weeks.

A nice alternative to grilled cheese sandwiches on the stove. The bread comes out toastier and buttery, not all soggy like on the stovetop. Much like the grilled cheese sandwiches in high school. Yum.

Thursday nights at our house is tough, my two sons have ice hockey practice at 6:50 & 8:oopm and I take care of my mother and bring her home around 6:00pm every night. I told my husband that I have to come up with a quick and easy dinner for that night. Mt decision is soup & grilled cheese night. I tried a sample test and made only one sandwich, my youngest son said, "this is the best grilled cheese sandwich". It came out perfect! Now, all I have to do is find a different soup from this site for every week. That task will not be difficult because this site is filled with fantastic recipes.

Duh ... why didn't I think of ever doing this myself. I hated having to stand by the stove and making a couple at a time. But thanks to this recipe we all sat down and ate together.  I added slices of tomatoe to mine. I will be using this recipe over and over again!

Had a chance to try these both at home and at work.  Home was ok using my oven, but at work I used the toaster oven and I liked it a lot better.  These reminded me of the grill cheese sandwiches from the Friendly's Restuarant.  Would love to know how to get the cheese to melt a little more though...any thoughts?

Yuck. IMHO, these taste nothing like grilled cheese sandwiches made in a frying pan. The bread didn't cook evenly and it gets hard, not crispy. I would only recommend this recipe for large families that don't mind the difference in taste and texture. Now I know how the cafeteria at work makes their grilled cheese as they taste the same!

This was OK.  I used a baking stone and the sandwiches turned out very crispy.  The edges were not burnt as some other reviews have suggested, but they were very crunchy.  I still prefer a skillet or griddle, but this would be good if you were feeding a small army.

These were great! I used swiss cheese since it isn't processed & used a whole grain bread. They were nice & crunchy & tasted great in just a few minutes! I almost always burn mine cooking them on a skillet so this recipe is a godscend! Thank you so much!

This is just another variation of the traditional grilled cheese sandwich... just remember to spray your pan with pam, so the sandwiches don't stick. Great Recipe!! Thank you for sharing....

I cannot believe that I didn't think of this before! The sandwiches retain their shape better, and don't ever burn. We make our sandwiches with two different kinds of cheese--it adds something to it. Thanks, Michelle, for a great idea!

I must agree... MUCH easier than trying to fry them in a pan!  Although mine still came out a big soggy in the middle, though the crust was nice and crispy... my fault, however, as I forgot to flip them and cook for the additional time.  Oops!  Still very delicious!

So simple but good.  Used just a bit of butter and a spray of pam.  6 to 8 minutes would have been too long in my oven.  They were nice and brown in just 4 to 5 minutes per side.

These grilled cheese sandwiches are so much tastier than the ones made in a skillet on top of the stove and they are so much easier too!  I added a slice of tomato to mine and ham and tomato to my husbands and we both agreed they were GREAT!  I did have to adjust the cooking time though or they would have burnt.  Thanks Michelle for this quick and easy recipe, I will be making these often!

This is the only way I will make grilled cheese sandwiches for the family in the future. I cut the crust off of the bread for my toddler's sandwich and buttered the crust heavily on the rest of the family's.  When I turned them over they didn't look like they would be done with 6 minutes on each side, but the second side cooked FAST.  Five minutes on the second side was too much. . . made for very crunchy (but not burned) sandwiches.  Next time I'll shorten the cooking time for my oven.  This is a great idea if you want to serve your whole family at once.  It sure beats waiting on one sandwich at a time to be cooked in a skillet!

My favorite way to have grilled cheese now!  I don't use butter at all, just spritz each side with some Pam - which makes this a much healthier version.  The sandwiches come out nice and crispy/crunchy, not mushy and greasy like the traditional ones.

This recipe turned out great!  Very cheesy and crunchy, my husband loved them and he's hard to please!  This is much better than cooking them on the stovetop, which always seems to result in a burnt outside but an unmelted inside.  Thanks so much!

Really great!  I was surprised at the difference in the oven!  I'll never make it the traditional way again!
