I have a question.  The picture of the soup clearly shows celery in it.  The recipe does not call for celery.  Why not?

Quick and simple but I think this was a bit bland as written. I ended up adding some herbs and next time I would replace the water with chicken broth. I also recommend cutting the ginger in half. Overall good recipe that just needs a couple of tweaks.
