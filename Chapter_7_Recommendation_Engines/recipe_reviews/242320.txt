This is an expensive yet delicious mac and cheese. I made a deviation to elbow noodles and used Abito turbodog beer (figuring it would be better than a strawberry beer). The gruyere makes this mac and cheese...it's worth the splurge so don't try substituting a different cheese.

This is the best Mac and cheese recipe I have come across yet. It is versatile in the fact that you can modify the flavor based on the brew you choose. As far as modifications- I substituted cavatappi pasta and used more panko to make a thicker crunchy topping.

Great comfort food recipe. I cooked a package of bacon and chopped it up and put it in the cheese sauce as well as a tin on green chilies. Let that boil then mix it in the noodles. Delicious
