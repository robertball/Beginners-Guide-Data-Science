I made two changes because that's what I had. I used a white cake mix instead of yellow and I substituted blueberries for the raspberries. I wasn't impressed by this cake two hours later when I first tasted it, neither were hubby nor granddaughter. I decided to try it again this morning and wow what a pleasant surprise. The flavors all melded and came together to produce a rich berry filled, cheesecake tasting-like cake. It is essential that this cake be refrigerated overnight for the delicious flavors to be spot on. Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

Wow.  I can't believe more people haven't reviewed this one.  It is easy and delicious.  It is time consuming though and definitely gets better with age.  I only had half the cream cheese required, so I subbed Greek yogurt for the other half.  That may have been a very good idea as the cake came out with a little bit of a tang that complimented the berries nicely.

My husband, a self-proclaimed "Treat Master," said that this was the best dessert he has EVER had in his almost 50 years.  He said the amount of lemon was perfect to accent the berries, and gave it a whopping 15 out of 10 on the charts!  I topped each slice with graham cracker crumbs, then strawberries cut to resemble hearts and/or stawberries for Valentine's Day.  A total hit!

Absolutely delicious! Only tweaks I made were more lemon juice to the fruit mix, and two tablespoons of sugar to the cream cheese mix, it tasted very bitter. I also cut into 18 squares instead of 12. It was a huge hit and has become my new favorite cake. Thank you for this recipe!

I made this for a family BBQ, I did make a change to lighten it up a bit.  Instead of the cheesecake topper I just used whipped topping and some fresh fruit.  It was a huge hit!  The cake was delicious and with the lighter topping it was not too sweet or overpowering.

This was so good!  I made this for a potluck the day before so it would have plenty of time for the flavors to meld... only change for me was to use blueberries instead of blackberries (I don’t like blackberries).  What everyone commented on was the fact that it wasn’t sickeningly sweet.  I will definitely make this one again!  Thanks for sharing!
