As this recipe’s first reviewer I wish I could rate it higher to give it a better start but neither Hubs nor I cared for these much.  I had my concerns about these from the beginning but I resisted the urge to tinker with the recipe because in this case I thought it important to make these as is (except for using butter rather than margarine) and not put my own spin on them.   First, I’m always a little skeptical of a basic cookie dough that calls for milk, or any liquid for that matter. It generally isn’t necessary.  Also, I was afraid I wouldn’t like the spices as listed.  I generally don’t like any spice with oatmeal cookies but a little cinnamon is fine.  This recipe, by contrast, had no cinnamon, but rather a little nutmeg and quite a substantial amount of cloves.  I doubted I would be a fan of that but I kept an open mind.  My concerns, however, bore out on both issues.  The milk wasn’t necessary at all – in fact, it made a dough too loose and sticky and a cookie much too soft - and kind of unattractive too I might add.  As for the spices, the taste of cloves is overbearing, even off-putting.  I’m afraid I can’t recommend this recipe.
