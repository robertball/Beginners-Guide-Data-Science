Make sure your wings are dry before dredging in the flour, should help with them not be so soggy if that's the issue you are having. Also, this recipe is pretty easy to customize to your taste, you can add different sauces and herbs. You can bake these wings on a roasting pan if you want. I've been getting lazy and using parchment paper so that I don't have to use cooking spray, kind of messy, haha. Thanks for everyone's input, I'm so glad you like the recipe!

Excellent! My suggestions to avoid soggy wings (1) Make sure to dry wings before flour dredge, (2) "Rest" wings uncovered in fridge for longer time (3) Line baking sheet or broiler pan with aluminum foil and place cooling rack or equivalent on lined pan, then bake wings on the rack. The grease will drip down into the pan and the wings will cook without soaking in the grease. This is an excellent alternative to fried wings, and being from the Buffalo area, I can say with confidence that these are comparable to those served in this area. Well done!

I have always baked my buffalo wings, but this is the first time I've drenched them in flour prior to baking them. I only added 3 tsp of cayenne pepper to the flour because 5 tsp seemed excessive. The wings were crispy and juicy on the inside. Definitely the best wings I've ever made. Thanks for sharing!

I have to stop the madness on this board!  This recipe is INCREDIBLE!  Here is what you need to do in order to feel like I do, post-meal:  
Put paper towels down and dry/squeeze your raw wings.  Dredge them in the flour mixture, leave them in the fridge for 45 min-1 hr.  You DO NOT need to leave them in for longer/overnight...I promise. Place them on a cooling rack or a griddle pan (I took my "racks" from my panini press).  Do not dip in the hot sauce mixture and bake wings at 425F for 25 minutes one one side, and then flip for 25 another minutes.  Take them out, dredge them in the sauce mixture (I turned mine twice) and then put them back in the hot oven, under the broiler on low for 5 minutes on each side. If you want to wipe down your pan with paper towels so you're not putting them back into the grease, do it!  I promise they will be amazing!  Re: sauce.  Taste it before you dredge! If you like it hotter, with soy sauce, more garlic and salt, add it! This recipe is great with these additions.  Took longer, but WELL worth it.

Wings were good, but not outstanding.  Based on 200 + reviews, I decided to chill the wings with the flour coating overnight as other reviewers suggested.  Right before baking I dipped in the butter/hot sauce and placed on a wire rack to cook.  Baked these the required 45 minutes and they were, soggy, soggy, soggy with not much flavor.  Pulled them out of the oven and re-dipped in straight hot sauce and then baked an additional 30 minutes with the last 20 minutes at 450 and they FINALLY started crisping.  Once they crisped, they were delicious.  3 stars based on the soggy factor and modification of the recipe to make it "work".  4 stars for taste with the re-dipping!

This recipe offers a good alternative way to make buffalo wings than the traditional deep-fried. It's easy and tastes great. It's good to make ahead for parties. If your wings didn't end up with crispy skin or came out soggy, it may have to do with the wings aren't dry enough. My suggestion is to dry your wings on a drainer after rising. Then pat dry (or even squeeze a little) with paper towel. If your wings are dry enough, they should coat nicely with the flour. Refrigerate without the plastic wrap can also help drying the wings. Do not soak your wings into the butter and hot sauce mixture for too long. If juice comes out during baking, drain it. This should make the crispy skin. I might also try making them in different favors such as lemon pepper or honey lime, etc.

I made these for my spice-loving Louisiana husband and he liked them however he brought to my attention the fact that a similar recipe is actually printed on the bottle of Frank's Red Hot Sauce....only difference is that the wings are baked first, THEN dipped in the sauce. Either way, it's a good recipe for spice lovers. The sauce was enough to liberally coat about 9 large chicken wings.

These wings were really quite tasty.  I'm not ready to say that they're the best I've ever had, but they certainly rival that of most restaurants and we were very pleased with them.  I think there are a few musts with these if you want them to be crispy: 1) pat your wings dry before coating with flour and let them sit in the fridge.  Ours sat for an hour and that was perfectly fine.  2) Don't line your pan with foil. While it might make clean-up a little easier, it does nothing to help crisp your wings.  We spread a little olive oil on a cookie sheet and spread them evenly. At about the 30 minute mark we drained any oil or juices off and then put them back in the oven.  3) Don't put the sauce on right away.  We baked ours for about 25 minutes, flipped them, baked for another 15 or so, and THEN rolled them in sauce before putting them back in for another 10 minutes or so. Our wings were crispy and delicious.  Hopes this helps some!

I really love Buffalo Wild Wings (a buffalo wing restaurant & bar)!!  I don't have one near me unfortunately but whenever I am in a city that has one I always stock up on their spicy sauces!!  I used the BWW sauce that I have and just tossed it with finished wings that I baked at 425 for 20 minutes on one side and 15 on the other.  Other than that they were cooked as the recipe said with the flour and butter and they were so awesome!!!

These are the best! Mine came out perfect. I was a litle worried about all the flour in my pan from them sitting in the fridge, but they were just perfect!

Sorry, but these came out a soggy MESS for me.  They weren't even close to crispy.  I prepared and cooked them as directed, but when  I pulled them out, they were swimming in chicken juice and sauce, and they were soggy.  The flavor of the sauce was great, though, maybe I'll try again with just baking the wings in the flour coating, and dipping in the sauce after, right before serving. I don't know.

This is such an easy dish to make but way too hot & I like hot.  I see now there was a correction made to how much cayenne.  I used 4 tsp. plus the hot sauce. I tried wings & pork.  I'll use this recipe again with less cayenne & some Ranch dip on the side to cool off!

Never, never, never, add flour to chicken wings, baked or fried. For the best tasting and healthier hot wings just cook in oven on cookie tray with non-stick cooking spray for 45 minutes to an hour at 450 degrees. While chicken is baking add your favorite hot wing sauce (and there are many on the market) with as much honey mustard sauce in a bowl and mix real good. When wings are done add to bowl and coat real well. Let cool and eat!

Great recipe for wings. 
Per other reviews, I made sure the wings were very dry before breading, and let sit in fridge for around 3 hours. 
However, when baking, I did half of my wings with dipping in the sauce then baking, the other half I didn't put sauce on until last 10 minutes. Flavor was about the same on both, but the ones that I didn't put the sauce on until the last 10 minutes came out way crispier than wings dipped in sauce before baking.

absolutely wonderful. full of flavor that sticks to the meat, not your mouth and fingers. it's also easy to adjust to your preferred levels of spiciness and also easy to add new flavors (little bit of bbq sauce, honey, etc.)

I currently live in New Zealand but grew up on the East Coast in the US. I have yet to find anywhere here with even passable wings, so I was glad to come across this recipe. I  found some Frank's Redhot at a specialty import store and using that (with a splash of vinegar), they tasted just like home! I followed others advice and baked them on a rack, making sure they were very dry first and brushing on the sauce only after they baked for apx 15 minutes. Then, after baking them for about 15 more minutes, I broiled them until crispy (which does result in a bit of smoke). The first time I made them I refrigerated them before baking for an hour, the second time not at all and I did not see a difference. I served the leftover sauce for dipping along with a homemade bleu cheese dressing and some celery sticks. I cooked them a second time for some of my Kiwi mates and my French bf and they all couldn't get enough!

Wow! My husband and I were really impressed with this recipe-he even said to add it to the regular rotation!  The results were very close to the taste & texture of wings from our favorite wing place.  After reading the reviews, here were the changes I made: 1).  Drying the wings before placing in the flour mixture 2). Placing the wings on a wire rack coated in non-stick spray, then placing the rack over in the baking pan I had refrigerated the wings on.  3).  Cooked the wings at 425 for 45 minutes, turning after 30 minutes 4). I didn't put sauce on the wings before placing in the oven-before turning them over I brushed that side with the sauce, then finished cooking them. After they were done, I placed the wings and sauce in a bag and shook.  Sauce stayed on and coated them well.  They also had a slightly crispy skin.

Incredibly crispy skin and wonderfully moist chicken. 

My husband and I are wing lovers, and we both agree that these are likely the best wings we have ever had. However, you have to follow the adjustments posted by other reviewers to assure that they come out crispy. 

Here are the changes I made for the perfect crispy, delicious wings:
Make sure to pat your wings dry with a paper towel.

Coat in the flour mixture ( I increased the amount of seasoning and added some turmeric and paprika as well).
Place on baking trays and let them sit in the fridge for at least one hour (I let them sit for almost 2 hours).
Preheat oven to 425 or 450 (depending on just how crispy you like your wings)and bake for 25 minutes.
Take them out and flip them over.
Turn heat down to 400 and bake for another 20 minutes.
Remove from oven, let cool slightly, and then dip the fully cooked wings in the sauce. 
Return them to the hot pan and let them sit for a couple of minutes to absorb some of the sauce.
I always have sauce left over, so I pour it into a bowl and use it for dipping.
Watch them closely as you are cooking, so that you can lower the heat if they start to char too much. My husband and I like the skin very crispy and a little charred. 
I served this up with a salad and some fresh garlic green beans. So good! Just made these today for the second time and looking forward to the leftovers.

This is definitely a 5-star recipe IF you follow suggestions to dry wings thoroughly with a paper towel AND put in fridge for 1-2 hrs before cooking, then baste with sauce last 15-20 minutes or so.  Tried cutting corners tonight (10 min in freezer) and it does not work!  Minimum one hour in refrigerator!

These were great!  I made them last night for the AFC title game, and they were a big hit.  I used the whole wingette, (drummie and wing connected).  It was easier to just pull apart later.  I floured them, and put them in the fridge for two hours.  I then baked them for 30 min. at 425 without the sauce.  Then put the sauce on them for 15 min. Flipped, then sauced the other side.  They came out crispy and tasty. I'd probably up the spiciness next time, but we had a little sauce left over, so I just drizzled that over the finished wings.  Thanks so much!

Tip against soggy wings:
 - dry wings thoroughly with paper towel
 - when baking, place it on a rack so the fat won't 
    soak the wings.
Tip for coating:
 - allow the butter & hot sauce sit until consistency 
    gets thick.  I found out the wings are well 
    coated and retains more of the hot sauce flavor.

Only change was to add a little smoked hot paprika to the flour mixture, and I altered the cooking process slightly - I skipped the refrigeration step, and baked the wings for about 40 minutes, then tossed with the butter/hot sauce mixture, returned to the oven and baked another 10 minutes.  Perfect!

I didn't have enough sauce left in my bottle of Frank's Red Hots but it was enough for the first test run. Thanks fellow reviewers for the tip on drying the wings before dipping in flour mix. The mix stayed on. I then dipped the wings in butter/hot sauce mixture and laid it on a rack on top of a cookie sheet to drain the excess grease (thanks again for the tip!). 30 minutes into baking at 400, I switched the oven to BROIL mode and let the heat crisped up the skin for 4-5 mins each. Best recipe ever. I didn't even bother to turn over the wings and they came out great!! So tender and juicy. Next time, I'll put more cayenne pepper and more adobe in the flour mix. YUM! Can't wait to do it again!

I have made these a couple of times and both times they came out great.  If you like crispy wings, do not put sauce before you bake

Fabulous wings!!This is the only way I make them now. Deep fried wings mostly come out of the fryer with hard bits which I find unappetizing. These, however, are tender and moist and flavorful. And, without the added fat of deep frying! Easy to make too! Advice: if you keep your opened hot sauce in the fridge, you may wish to warm it up before adding to the melted butter. The cold of the sauce sometimes causes some butter to lump up.

Great recipe.  I'm an advocate of following a recipes instructions, however this time I didn't.  I cooked the wings at 500-degrees for 30 minutes without flipping them.  The wings basically fried themselves at the high temperature and came out slightly crisp.  They were perfect.  I also doubled the cayenne and the wings had just enough heat.

This is a great recipe.  You get the fried flavor while baking.  I did a taste test between "Texas Pete's" and  "Crytsal's" hot sauce.  While Texas Pete's had the best smell from the bottle, Crystal's blew it away in every other aspect.  If you look at the texture of the two, Crystal's is way more granular with lots of pepper traces.  Also if you look at Texas Pete's ingredients, there are many perservatives.  Similar to Frank's Red Hot (which may have the best flavor, but has the same additives).  Crystal has the least ingredients, and in my opinion has the best flavor.  Just shake the bottles and look at the texture in your grocery isles.  Hope I saved you some time.  PS dry your wings before flour dredging.

This is a solid recipe! Great alternative to deep frying!  The flour adds a nice crispy texture to the skin and holds the sauce!  As many others mentioned!  Do NOT dip the wings in the sauce before baking them until they are really crispy first!  Pat wings dry, dredge 'em in the flour mixture, let them rest, if you must, then bake them flipping them every 20 mins for about 1 hour or until wings are golden brown and crispy, THEN brush with the butter/hot sauce and bake 10-20 mins longer!  Reality is : all oven temps vary so be mindful of this and adjust temp as needed!   I started at 400, turned down to 350 for 40 mins of the baking so as not to burn the wings but let the fat cook out, then I cranked 'er back up to 400 after I brushed the sauce on!  They were still crispy, not burnt and tasted fab!!!

These wings are so easy and so DELICIOUS!! I make them every Sunday during football season.  I coat them in the morning and leave in the fridge until were ready to cook. I use more cayenne (we like them hot) and i cant believe it's not butter spray instead of melting butter. Make sure to squeeze out the liquid from the wings before coating them with the flour and they will come out as crispy as fried wings!! I also cook mine longer and at 375, turning every 20 minutes for an hour or so  til they're good and crispy :)

These were delicious! I turned them, half way through cooking and one side was still slightly soggy. I will be sure to dry the wings next time. The husband (a wing fanatic) loved them and stated that we no longer had to go out to eat wings! Whoopee, lucky me! LOL.  By the way, instead of using foil, I cooked them on parchment paper.

I really didn't want to fry the wings so i tried this recipe. My conclusion is that there's no need for the extra fat, mess, and trouble! My only recommendations are: cook on parchment paper so they don't stick and you don't have to spray. Double sauce and reserve half to drizzle/toss with wings after they cook.

Great, great recipe. Made it so easy to make delicious wings at home. I think flouring the wings and then refrigerating them was the key to their success. I've made them 2x, once with frozen wings and once with fresh. They both were good. I used a baking pan (the double kind) with the bottom lined with foil; made clean-up super easy. The first time I followed the recipe (minus the cayenne since I was serving it to my kids), but the second time I didn't dip them in the butter mix before baking. they were still great and not as greasy. I've used extra garlic - delicious! - and Old Bay seasoning - the BEST! This recipe is a keeper!

I was skeptical at first. It seemed... to simple. The only variance from the directions I had was doubling the cayenne pepper and garlic powder (definitely NOT the salt). And WOW. I don't usually create website accounts just to rate something, but this might have turned into one of the greatest buffalo wings I've ever eating in my entire life. Absolutely fantastic. Crisp, rich in flavor, not greasy at all (far from it), and as someone who doesn't appreciate a lot of breading on anything this was... well... perfection. Give it a shot! You really can't go wrong! Thanks to the submitter!

I've made these twice now and they were phenomenal both times!  They really did come out crispy like they had been fried but without the guilt.  I basically followed the recipe exactly except the second time I used 1:2 ratio of butter and hot sauce 1/4 cup butter for 1/2 cup sauce) since the first time it was way too greasy for me and didn't stick to the chicken very well.  Also, I didn't dip them in the sauce prior to baking.  I thought they might get a little mushy that way or just not be as good, so after they were finished I let them cool for about 5 minutes then tossed them in the buffalo sauce.  They were PERFECT this way - like restaurant quality.  My husband is always asking me to make these again... and guess what I'm getting ready to do ;-)

I personally do not like buffalo wings, but my husband is a big fan. So, I decided that I would give these a try and see if he liked them just as much as the store bought ones. He sure liked these!

I did change a few things based on other peoples reviews. I made sure I patted/squeezed the wings dry with a paper towel before I dredged them. I also baked them on a cooling rack above a baking sheet. One last tweak was that I baked them for 25 minutes on one side, flipped them and cooked them for another 25 minutes *then* I put the sauce on and baked them for an additional 5 minutes. Then I drizzled them with the leftover sauce I made.

Only thing my husband would have liked was for them to be a bit more "saucy". Maybe I'll double dip them next time. Will definitely make these again!

Made this yesterday for the Giants domination over the Pack....we got RAVE reviews. I followed the recipe to the tee, but took heed to reviewers and placed the wings on a rack and not directly on the pan. Served with blue cheese, carrots and celery. DELISH! A football party staple from now on.

One of the best wings I have ever had. I scaled down the flour to 1/2 cup only because I didn't want to waste the flour. I had a feeling there would be extra and there would of been. Make sure your wings are dried off with a paper towel before you flour them! They set in the fridge for about 3 hours then brushed on the butter/hot sauce mixture. I lined a cookie sheet with foil and put a metal rack on top so the oil would drip down. This is a must! Easy clean up and no sticking.  My wings were huge so I cooked mine for about 60 minutes and flipped them three times. Each time I basted the wings with extra Franks Redhot. We like them hot!! These wings turned out perfect! Crispy skin with the meat moist and falling off the bone. This will now be the only way I make wings!

I wont use the flour next time! That's what makes them soggy. I will stick with my old method. I usually just bake them longer (closer to an hour or so ) at a lower temp 350-375. I use quite a bit of melted butter but the skin crisps up nicely. Not quite the same as fried, but their not!  Also, I sometimes skip the hot sauce and mix in an itialian seasoning or ranch packet with the butter. Not the healthiest, but yum!

I made these for Super Bowl and they were fantastic!  Definitely bake them on a rack on top of the foil lined baking sheet.  I'm so glad that I did because the juices/sauce will blacken on the bottom and you don't want them cooking in that.  I chose to do 2 flavors, buffalo and terriyaki.  I used 1/4 cup melted butter, 1/4 cup Franks buffalo sauce, and 1/4 cup bbq sauce for the buffalo wings and in another bowl I did 1/4 cup melted butter and 1/2 cup terriyaki sauce.  When the wings were done I felt the terriyaki wings needed more coating so I warmed some terriyaki sauce and recoated them.  The buffalo wings seemed good as is but you could do the same with additional Franks/bbq sauce.  This method produces wings that are easily as tasty as the fried version and the clean up is so easy!  Just throw the foil away.

This is a great recipe. Only changes I made was to use Tonys instead of cayanne and salt and I baked 15 min on each side THEN I dipped them in the sauce put them back in the oven for 15 minutes and they were perfect. Tender, juicy and had a great flavor. Oh and I used Cholula hotsauce instead of Franks (my husband doesnt like it.)

By far the best hot wings I have ever made. Nice & crispy with great flavor. For my six year old son I dipped a few wings in a little BBQ sauce instead (thinned with water) because he doesn't like spicy foods. They were also absolutely delicious.

Made these tonight. So easy and some of the best wings I've ever had. EXTREMELY Juicy, not greasy, and make sure you pat your wings dry and change out the foil in between to avoid sogginess!

Used all dry ingredients, let sit overnight. Baked with just dry coating and olive oil spray. Used Frank's RedHot sauce after they cooked for 1/2 hour. NO butter!! There is no need for butter. Just use olive oil spray, turn add more sauce. My husband thought they were the best!! I think the reason they turned out soggy for so many others is because of the butter.

I have been cooking for 60 years and I started when I was 10 years old learning from my mother and grandmother. My grandmother was a cook in the Cleveland, Ohio school system for many years as well as for her church. I wish I had read the comments before I wasted my food materials on this awful recipe. Without a source of drainage the wings came out extremely soggy due to the butter and chicken "butter" from fat in the wings not having a place to drain. I could not recommend this recipe to anyone who has a sense of taste for even mediocre food. This review may be harsh but it is concert with the quality of the resulting food when using this recipe.

These wings have changed my life! Okay, I'm being a little over-the-top, but seriously, I will never eat another wing any other way. I would swear they were deep fried. I've probably made these ten times. THANK YOU!

I made these for a business lunch and upped the recipe to 150 wings and they turned out great! Drying them in the fridge first really helped!

Just as good as fried wings...If not better!

Before trying this recipe I thought that it would not be as good as fried wings. I have been mistaken!
These wings are crispy, without the grease of fried wings!

I followed the suggestions to thoroughly dry the wings before coating them and also let them sit in the fridge for about 3 hrs rather than only 1.  While that seemed to work great the only issue I had was that after flipping them half way - may of them were stuck to the foil when it was time to take them out.  And when I took them off - the coating stayed on the foil...  Only modification I made was rather than put them in the sauce before cooking - I tossed them in wing sauce after.  The flavor was great and for those where the coating didn't stick to the pan - they were very crisp.  Will try again and maybe this time re-spray the pan with cooking spray when I flip them.

I read others reviews all the time on here but I have to be honest-this is the first one I have written. I couldn't NOT post a review after making these.  They were outstanding! Husband says better than fried. I did make sure they were perfectly dry. Dried them off with paper towels and let sit in the fridge. I used the seasoned flour(I did add a few extra dashes of this and that) and let them sit in the fridge again for the hour then I baked them as is, flipping them ever 10 minutes or so for about an hour at 375. Made a wing sauce with the butter and Red Hot and some extra spices and when they were done cooking I tossed them in the sauce. They stayed crispy on the outside but were fall apart tender on the inside. I can't wait to make them again-perfect game watching food!

These wings are good!  I did not put mine in the fridge, so I baked them on foil lined pan with a rack on it.  I increased the temp to 425 (knew this from previous tries) and also increased the baking time to 1 hour - these 2 changes make a big difference. I did the flour mixture and then dipped them in the butter & Frank's mixture.  Once baked, I slathered them in Franks again as I was eating them.  REALLY GOOD!

These were delicious!  No complaints and I will make them again soon!  I reserved half a cup of the butter and hot sauce mixture to pour over the baked wings to make them saucy right before serving.  Fiance gobbled them up!

They are fantastic.  I didn't wait the hour this time.  I did bake without the sauce for 30 min and flipped then baked for 30 more min.  Drizzled the sauce on them and we ate after they cooled a bit.  WOW...crunchy, spicy and GONE.  Hubby and kids loved them with ranch dressing.  I only added 2 tsp of cayenne.  Will make again and again.

The best results to get these wings crispy is to make sure your wings are completly dry. Rinse, drain for a bit, and paper towel dry before dredging into flour. I substitued smart blance light butter, saving a lot of fat, but not the taste. 45 to 50 minutes in the oven is all that is needed. These are absolutely delish, Thanks Leesah! This recipe is a keeper!

I followed the recipe exactly and found that the chicken wasn't spicy.  I made a batch of hot sauce/butter mixture to dip the cooked chicken in to make them hot. The chicken was neither soggy nor crispy when it was done cooking. The chicken was tender when it was done baking.   I don't plan to make these again.  There was nothing special about them.  Thank you Leesah for sharing your recipe.

Great recipe! They're not as crispy as I'd like but maybe I'm just not trying off the chicken enough. I actually use this recipe with chicken breast and it comes out great. I make it quite a bit hotter than this recipe calls for, but one the first attempt following the recipe to the letter, they came out great.

We liked these!  I made 1/4 of this recipe using 4 whole wings (8 pieces) and the amount of sauce ended up being just right.  As other reviewers suggested, I dried my wings well by squeezing them in a paper towel a few times to get as much moisture off them as I could.  Seemed to work out just fine.  I was making another recipe for wings at the same time, so I baked these at 375 for about an hour.  Then I crisped them a little more under the broiler.  Very good and we'll make these again!

These are excellent!  I followed the ingredients exactly.  I did however cook them (on a wire rack) first and then I tossed them in the sauce.  Turned out perfect.

This was fantastic! I used chicken breasts instead (4 large ones), cutting them up into strips.  I coated them, then refrigerated them overnight. I put them on a very well-greased cookie cooling rack in the baking sheet, and cooked them (without hot sauce mixture) at 425 for 30 minutes. Then I turned them over and cooked for 15 more minutes. When they were done, I put them in the hot sauce mixture to fully coat them and served them that way, with blue cheese. SOOO good!  They weren't soggy at all, super crunchy/crisp, and very tasty. See photo for proof. :)

These were the best baked "fried" chicken wings I have tried. I followed the recipe except I did not coat in the wing sauce until they were baked and had no problem with soggy chicken wings. I placed wings on foil wrapped cookie sheet with cooking spray. Cooked 30 minutes, flipped and cooked another 30 minutes. Much healthier...Thank You!

I've only used frozen wing parts ONCE (not for this recipe) and they are pumped with liquid to enhance flavor - they WILL be soggy!  The one and only time that I used them, I had to dump the liquid off 3 or 4 times while baking, and they still didn't really crisp. My tip would be to use the ones at the meat counter, NOT the ones in the freezer section of the store!

While the original recipe is not perfect, it doesn't take a whole lot of alterations to make it absolutely incredible!  I dried my wings well, floured them, and left them in the fridge on a cooling rack for 1.5 hours.  I then proceeded to bake them on the cooling rack on top of an aluminum foil covered tray at 415 for 25 minutes.   Took them out, drained excess juice from the tray, dipped them in sauce, flipped them, and baked another 25 minutes.  
I took them out AGAIN, brushed the tops with sauce, and broiled them on high for 3 minutes on each side, brushing once more after flipping.  The result was crispy, flavorful skin, and tender, juicy meat that slides right off the bone!  What I did obviously took a little more effort, but was well worth it.  I will undoubtably be making these again, thanks!

5 STARS! I MADE THIS LAST WEEK AND MY HUSBAND DEVOURED IT. HIS FAVE FOOD OF ALL TIME ARE BUFFALO CHICKEN WINGS. HE COULD EAT THEM EVERYDAY. HE SAID THESE WERE PERFECT IN EVERY WAY, CRISPY-THE WAY HE LOVES, AND FULL OF SPICY FLAVOR. THE BEST PART ABOUT THIS RECIPE IS YOU CAN ADJUST IT TO YOUR TASTE LEVEL EASILY.I DID JUST BAKE THEM WITHOUT SAUCE FOR 45MINS TO 1 HR, THEN POURED THE SAUCE OVER THEM WHILE THEY WERE STILL HOT FROM THE OVEN.DIDN'T EVEN TURN THEM BECAUSE THEY WERE ON RACKS.AMAZING! MAKING THEM TONIGHT AGAIN AT HIS FRIENDS HOUSE FOR A CROWD. THIS RECIPE IS NOW "SAVED TO FAVORITES".

This recipe is great. My family loves buffalo wings and they saved me 2 out of 20! I'm making them again tonight. The only change that I'm trying is to put them on a wire rack since they stuck to the foil.

Follow the directions, but hold off on the sauce till they are done, then roll them in your sauce (hopefully you heated it up on the stove to melt everything.. and hopefully you know to mix your dry ingredients with dry ingredients and wet ingredients with wet ingredients..

Alrighty....read all the tips and they turned out not crispy or soggy. 
When I make them again I will: 
1 refrigerate overnight ( 2 hrs not enough )
2 use a rack in the oven ( helped a lot this time)
3 wipe off wings before flour ( great tip !)
4 cook in oven without sauce, dip in ten mins before done. I had to double dip in the sauce this time 
and they weren't coated or spicy enough.
Still a good recipe, will def try again!

The best I've ever made!  I did as others and cooked at 425 instead and coated in the sauce at the 2nd half of cooking.

We followed the reviews and dryed the wings well and baked them on a rack on a cookie sheet....but they were still soggy.  Not sure what we did wrong.  But they still tasted very good.

The best wings ever!!  Baked mine and fried some for my husband.  Better than any restaurant wings I've tasted.

I like the technique of baking rather than deep-frying, but these were a bit bland.  I usually do not like hot and spicy and in a restaurant, I would order mild wings.  But these had absolutely no kick at all.  I will make again, but next time, I will doctor the flour mixture with a lot more garlic powder, onion powder, a bit more cayenne and black pepper.

These were really good!  I made a few changes.  I dried the chicken really well before dredging.  As suggested by many others, I waited until after cooking to put the sauce.  I did half on a broiler tray and half on a cookie sheet with foil and didn't notice a difference, neither batch was soggy.  I baked the wings at 425 for 25 mins, flipped and backed another 15.  Then broiled for 3 minutes at 500.  I am a wuss when it comes to spice, and didn't think these were that spicy.  Next time I will use more sauce, less butter.

These wings were delicious!! I used the same measurements and ingredients, but instead of bothering with refrigerating them for an hour, I just floured them and baked them for 50 mins, took them out and sauced them, and baked for 10 more mins and they came out perfectly crispy! Will definitely be making these again soon!!

This great! Just like restaurant fried wings but without the hassle of greasing popping everywhere. They were super crispy because I let the chicken sit in the flour overnight before baking.

Thanks so much for sharing this recipe! We made it for the Super Bowl...we did well season the flour, and I think the wings being dried before floured, and the hour in the fridge was the trick. We did skip the cayenne pepper, and it's a good thing, because they were Hot! But perfect. When I say Hot...I worked at Hooters and I'm from Louisiana, so I know a thing or two about Hot Wings! We will make this much more, without the cayenne!

So delicious!  My husband and I are temporarily living in a country where you really can't find good buffalo wings...I cooked these up as a little reminder of back home.  SO good! Just make sure you really let them bake long enough before flipping the wings over, or all the goodness falls off into the pan.

My roommate and I wish we could give this 10 stars!  We loved it!  They were gone in about 20 minutes.  I didn't have a problem with them being soggy at all.  Perfectly crisp and moist.  Fabulous recipe, thank yo so much!

1-16-2016 ~Even tho’ I’ve never prepared chicken wings myself, we eat them out often. Hubs’ sensitive innards require that we ask for the sauce on the side  and because of that I know they are tossed in the sauce AFTER they’re cooked, whether they’re fried or baked, so I knew that’s what I’d be doing when I made these.  But in praise of this recipe I also knew that the flouring would be a good step and would help to achieve a crispy exterior.  Unfortunately, however, they did not brown or crisp sufficiently in the allotted cooking time, so I continued baking them for several more minutes.  That certainly helped, but also resulted in wings that were a tad overdone.  In hindsight, maybe raising the oven temperature to 425 degrees would solve this. Or maybe giving them a blast under the broiler at the end would have accomplished that as well.  Frankly, I think what we’re doing here is to try and achieve the same results with baking as we would with deep frying, and that just won’t work.  If I try these again, I think I’ll just deal with the extra effort and messiness and fry them.

I thought this recipe was a HIT!!  I refrigerate in the f'lour bag and make sure to shake the wings at a few stages (esp. At the end) to ensure the outer crust is dry and not soggy before baking.  This is also how wings are made in restaurants: fried dry,then tossed in sauce when done cooking.  I cooked them dry (no sauce dip)- once at 400, and the second batch was at 400 then 425 for half the cooking time (because I was cooking something else concurrently), and both times, the wings were crispyand came out very nicely!   It def helps to liberally grease the foil/pan, as the wings can stick when you flip them or when they're done cooking, causing patches of crispy crust to stick and get peeled off from the wings.  I tossed the wings in the sauce after they are done baking, and they were saucy and tasty on the outside, and the skin/flour underneath  was crispy and crunchy, just like fried wings!  I would absolutely recommend this recipe!

Best wings I've ever had!  As one of the reviewers said, I dried the wings well, then dredged in flour/seasoning mixture and refrigerated for at least an hour.  Baked on broiler sheet lined with foil for 25 min per side in 425 deg oven.  I do not like my wings to burn my mouth so I added some BBQ sauce and honey to taste.  Then covered wings with sauce and baked them an additional 5-7 min in broiler until bubbly.  Watch carefully.  Yummy!

My family LOVED them!! I have made them differently before but this was the easiest recipe I found by far. I just cooked them at 425 instead of 400, but otherwise they were crispy and delicious and my boys couldn't stop saying how great they were. A definite favorite in our house!!

I finally found a easy and great wing recipe without all the frying.  I will definately use this recipe from now on.  I doubled this recipe and brined the wings first in salt and brown sugar for a couple hours, then rinsed them.  Then I put Superior soy and chiracha on the wings and let set for a few minutes. I didn't worry about drying the wings before the flour but did give them a shake and poured off any excess moisture in bowl before I put them in the flour.  I did then put them in the fridge for an hour. I didn't sauce first but baked at 425 for 25 min. right on a piece of foil, skin side down first then turned the wings and lowered temp to 400 and basted them with the sauce and cooked for about another 10 to 15 min.  They were very crispy and I have tried all different ways to cook wings and this was by far the best wing recipe I have come across.

I made this recipe for my Super Bowl party. Having read everything... I made certain my wings were completely dry before I dredged them! Also, did let them rest in the fridge for an hour. However, I did use a cooling rack to bake them on in the pan. Some of my guests are picky about the wings not being soaked in sauce. They turned out fantastic! Thank you for teaching me how to make a simply great wing appetizer!

I did dry my wings before dredging as to prevent soggy wings. I increased the garlic powder to a full teaspoon and omitted the salt as I was using a salted butter. EXCELLENT. No leftovers. Great for Superbowl Sunday.

This recipe is delicious.  But I have a secret about how to get baked wings, or baked any cut of chicken.....crispy  Par boil for 15 min.  Then drain and dry well.  Then just follow this recipe with any changes that appeal to your family, you won't believe the difference.  And, bonus you get rid of alot of the fat when you boil and it doesn't take as long to cook.  Thank you Leesah for this tasty recipe

Excellent ... followed the recipe exactly ... next time I will broil for the last 5 minutes but other than that they were very tasty.  Thanx Leesa ..  Would like to add that now that I have a gas oven vs an electric oven my wings are so crispy that I do not have to broil at the end any longer ... and when I first put them in the oven it is preheated to 425f and after 5 minutes I turn it down to 400f

This is a fantastic solution to not having the "fried smell" in your home, but still having crispy yummy wings. I did make sure they were patted dry with paper towels before shaking them in the flour Ziploc. I put them in the refrigerator for about 2 hours. I cooked them on a cooling rack over two tinfoil lined cookie sheets. 10 wings a rack, they fit in the oven fine, bottom rack and 2nd to top rack. I cooked them for an hour to ensure maximum crispiness. Though be warned, the drippings made a lot of smoke in the oven and I released the smoke a few times.

These wings were simply amazing.  Very easy to make and came out perfectly.  My husband said they were better than any wings he has ever had restaurant or home made.  I didn't modify the recipe, but i did place in broiler for a few minutes at the end.  Just one thing, make sure your exhaust fan is on because my kitchen got pretty smokey but it was well worth it.  I will make these over and over!

Have made this a few times and a few ways. Always wonderful. I like it best when I mix all the spices they suggest and then add onion powder, paprika but skip the salt. I put the spices on the meat directly sometimes and just in the flour other times. Always good either way. I do let the wings sit in the flour for a few hours and make sure the wings are dry when they go into the flour. When I bake them, I do it on a PAM sprayed rack over a cookie sheet.  PAM is VERY important. I don't put the sauce on until they have 10 minutes left or less. Then I pull the wings out and sauce them up. I put them back on the sheet and finish up baking until they are not dripping and the sauce is baked on.  So good.

Followed this recipe exactly, though upped the temp to 425 and baked for an additional 30 min., as the wings weren't crisping. The wings still ended up soggy and gummy from the flour - very unappetizing. Next time I will pre-bake, then toss in butter/hot sauce.

these wings are AWESOME!!  We were craving hot wings that didn't need deep frying and my hubby found this recipe.  We've made it three times now and every time they've turned out great ... and as I write this review we have another batch in the oven :)  Make sure the wings are dry and we let them sit in the fridge for a few hours after dredging but before the hotsauce goes on.  mmmm...

I dried these really well with paper towels and then proceeded to follow the recipe exactly. I liked that they weren't so terribly hot.  They were spicy, just not   super hot spicy.

Excellent! Addictive!  I used 8 chicken legs, any size. Only 1/2 cup flour, 3/4 tsp. cayenne pepper, 3/4 tsp. garlic powder, 1/2 tsp salt. I used chicken shears to cut off skin for lower cholesterol, which actually helped the spices to be more on the meat.
Shook one leg at a time in bag for better coverage.
Placed a tiny spot of olive oil on foil where leg was placed.  Refrigerated 1 1/2 hrs.  
Put some Frank's hot pepper sauce in small bowl, Added 2-3 T. of olive oil. Mixed and dipped one leg at a time in bowl, put a spot of olive oil on foil. Put on leg.  Baked about 40-45 mins. Did not turn. Incredible!  Could have eaten 4-6..Husband loved them. Great for leftover warm-up or snacks.  Grandsons would have devoured them if they had been here. Very cheap to make, quick and easy.

This recipe was great!! I did not chill my wings at all. I first coated them with the flour and cooked them at the 400 degrees for 20-25 min each side. Then I mixed the melted butter and franks redhot together, and tossed the wings in the sauce a few minutes after taking them out of the oven. This gives the wings much more flavor and still has the nice crispy skin.

These turned out great. Used the tip to use a rack when cooking them & they came out crisp, but not greasy. Perfect for Sunday night football, served with cornbread, salad & it was dinner.

I also followed the recipe to the letter and felt that the sauce slid off the wings.  There was very little sauce left on the chicken and a ton of oil or grease on the aluminum foil.  They also stuck to the aluminum foil pulling off some of the skin.

I drained off the oil and broiled the wings to get them crispier.  They were tasty but not saucy or spicy enough to our liking.  You would think the flour and sauce would hold together and adhere to the chicken better.

We really hate soggy wing, we love ours nice a crispy but I try to avoid deep frying as much as possible. Let me tell you, these wings came out perfect! My husband is a wimp when it comes to hot things, but I made these on his birthday with some other finger foods, and he ate most of them himself! I did add a little soy sauce and honey to butter and hot sauce mix, and it came out great. I am somewhat of a wing expert, everywhere I go that has them I order them, wings are my favorite and these are at the top of the list now. You HAVE to try them!

This is a great wing recipe and I hate to fry anything so it was right up my alley. I shook the wings around in the flour mixture and refrigerated for 30 minutes to an hour. I then baked the wings without the sauce for the 45 minutes. When they came out of the oven I dip them in the hot sauce/butter sauce and place them on a serving dish. They have a lot of flavor and are not soggy. At a popular wing place where waitresses where orange shorts they always dip the fried wings in sauce AFTER cooking. Their wings are delicious and now so are mine!

These were great, I did take the advise of another reviewer and use a roasting pan covered in foil with a cooling rack on top so the juices fall into the pan and they dont get soggy, worked wonderfully! Hubby loved them!

THis is a fabulous recipe, I was very impressed.  I struggled with the 5/5 but went with it because it had such wonderful taste...IF you save some sauce (make extra) and re-baste the chicken.  Without that, it is still really really good.  I liked the suggestions by others to put a splash of vinegar in the sauce, and pepper to the flour mixture.  I also added juice from 3 limes to the sauce... This recipe is a keeper, thank you!

Love these!  These turn out great and crispy every time.  The one thing that I noticed from cooking these a couple of times is that the heat from the hot sauce burns off in the oven.  So I usually add some cayenne and other hot spices into the flour.

These were good but not the best.  I would still like to say that I am grateful for a recipe for buffalo wings that does not require frying and still produces a pretty tasty wing.  The only way I could get them to kinda-sorta crisp up was to broil them for several minutes on each side - twice - after baking them at 425 for 45 min.  My son asked for buffalo wings for his 10th birthday dinner and was very happy with the results, so I can't say I'd ask for anything more.  Thanks! =]

These a amazing!!! BUT Don't use foil just put the wings on a wire rack and spray the rack with non stick spray. It starts smoking really bad when there is foil! I dipped the wings in the wing sauce at the begining and then again after 45 min. and then I cooked them for another 30 minutes and then I dipped them one more time after they were done. And they are amazing.

I read at least 50 of the reviews before making my second time.  First time out I followed the recipe and they were very soggy.  After these tweaks to the recipe my second batch of wings were excellent.  My advaice is to be sure to dry the wings well after cleaning,  use the parchment paper and not foil, leave them in the oven for 2 hours not just one, turn the wings twice once they have started to brown, do not dip in sauce until AFTER you bake them (ensures them to be cripy and not soggy).  I also used Franks Red Hot Wings - Buffalo sauce instead of the regular flavor.  Great if you like less heat in your wings and serving to kids.

Just ok.  I will stick with my own method which doesn't involve butter and has more flavor.  Just season well with Lawry's , garlic powder, cayenne and black pepper and paprika.  Place in 350 oven for about 45 minutes.  Turn oven to broil, cook an additional 5 minutes to crisp up.

Wow. As a native Buffalonian, I've always despised baked wings -- they are typically soggy, greasy pretenders to the real thing.  But these are fantastic!  Crispy, spicy, amazing! Served these last night at a Super Bowl party, and wished I had tripled the recipe -- and so did the guest!  Thanks, Leesah, for a great recipe!

Followed the recipe, wings stuck to foil, not much flavor and ANYTHING but crispy. Face it, baked wings just don't measure up to fried wings. This recipe was a disappointment.

Excellent recipe.  I baked the wings on a baking rack to allow drippings to run off.  Wings were crispy and deliciious.  Preparing again for the Super Bowl.

I tried this recipe today and really enjoyed it.  Like Aaron, I baked the wings on a rack, but for the last 5 minutes I put them under the broiler to get them as brown as I wanted without over cooking.  I set several wings aside and dipped them into the sauce after cooking to compare tastes.  I found you had stronger flavour dipping after cooking but a nice mellow heat if you dipped them first.  I also had some sour cream to dip them in as I was eating them.  I also sprayed the wings with cooking spray to get the nice oil taste.  All in all a great recipe.

Made this today for the Rose Bowl, everyone was very impressed and asked for the recipe.  I did place the chicken on a rack while it was cooking.  Additionally, I waited to apply the sauce during the last 10 minutes, 5 minutes on each side.  Results crisp chicken with a nice sauce base.

This is a great recipe.  I like to add a little extra butter to the mix, and a little extra cayenne.  I recommend you put a layer of parchment paper down under the wings, and it really will give it some added crunch.  I've made wings using this recipe about 10 times now, and I always get favorable comments.  UPDATE - If you want the wings a little more crispy, broil them for about 3 minutes before removing from the oven!

I was a bit conflicted as to how to rate these. If I have to rate them against all buffalo wings (including fried ones) I can't give them a 5 because they are just not as crispy. BUT, as baked wings go, these are better than anything I've ever had.  These did have a bit of a crunch to them, and were definitely unlike any other baked wings I've ever made (which usually come out soft, soggy, and greasy.   As other suggested, I made sure mine were dried well, and gave them a couple of hours to sit with the flour mixture on them. I cooked them on a wire rack so any grease would drip into the pan below.  Definitely worth making if you don't want to do fried.

My to-to recipe for wings.  I'm convinced the method is the key to success.  Be sure the wings are dry before dredging and then dry them again in the fridge after dredging.  I usually bake for 20 minutes per side and then do a setting on my oven - convection roast - for 5-10 minutes per side.  The convection roast really browns them up and crisps them.  I only put the hot sauce on half on account of my finicky kids but the plain ones are also very tasty.

I loved this recipe.  My only complaint is that there was not nearly enough "heat" for my Texas taste buds.  I made sure the wings were completely dry before coating them with the flour.  I cooked the wings on cooling racks placed on the cookie sheet, so they were crisp all around.

I love Bar Buffalo wings and I know they deep fry them, so seeing this recipe baking them is wonderful.  I followed everything but dipped them again 1/2 way thru baking when I flipped them over.  Also had to broil for the few minutes, watching closely not to burn.  Otherwise they just didn't cut it crispy wise.  I loved 'em and would make them again and again, super bowl party or other.

I made this recipe exactly as is - including Frank's Red Hot (middle) sauce.  They were INCREDIBLE!  They were crispy and delicious!  I'm making them again tonight and I think I'll roll them in some more Franks after they're cooled and done because I like them a little more spicey.  But an awesome recipe - EASY and cheap - a perfect meal!

So, I originally started making the 'Boneless Buffalo Wings' from this website. After I mixed the flour & ingredients from that recipe, I began to read the reviews for this one & decided to go this route. Pretty much the only difference is paprika & amounts of other spices added (which everyone does anyways). I read the first few pages of reviews & did this - other than change the flour recipe, I blotted/squeezed extra water out of the chicken before I floured it, let it sit in the fridge for more than an hour, I used the cooling rack in the oven, but forgot to spray it, so the wings stuck a little bit, I didn't put the sauce on (I used that Frank's stuff, they wouldn't have been as good with another brand) until they were done cooking & cooled (I used butter Pam & sprayed the wings before I put them in the oven). I didn't flip them either. After I let them cool, I sauced them, then on a couple I added cajun seasoning on top of the hot sauce/butter mix. Mine were super crispy and perfect, so if yours weren't, try what I did & you'll love it! Also, after I battered the wings, I made ranch with the Hidden Valley Ranch dip mix and light sour cream (I don't think the fat-free sour cream works/tastes well for ranch) so it would have time for the flavors to mix. I plan on flouring wings the night before the weekend (when I really crave them).

My husband absolutely loved these. I did not have time to let the wings sit for an hour in the fridge so I just cooked them immediately. I did not put the hot sauce on when I cooked them and did turn them over half-way through cooking time. At the end I took each wing and dipped them in the sauce and put them back in the oven at 450 for about 5 minutes. They were nice and crispy!

FANTASTIC!!I had to convince hubby that they were baked, he was sure I fried them. I dried them very well, then kept them in the fridge for over 2 hours.  I baked them without the sauce.  I think they got more crispy without sauce.  I put the sauce on and baked about 5 more minutes.  45 minutes was perfect timing.

These were the best,crispiest baked wings.I baked the breaded wings at 425* for 30 minutes, then took them out, coated with sauce, then cooked them on the other side an additional 25 minutes. I was afraid the sauce would burn if on the wings the entire baking time.

Absolutely wonderful!  I used a half of a teaspoon of cayanne pepper and my hubby and 11 year old daughter said they weren't hot enough.  I used my convection on the last 5 minutes and they were perfectly crispy and delicious!

We love hot wings at our house, but the deep frying is a giant pain, mess and bad for the hips.  This recipe was very good.  The wings were crisp and tasty.  I did not dip them in the sauce before baking, just did the flour dredging and then refrig before baking.  Also, forgot to spray my foil, so they stuck a bit, so I'm sure the non-stick spray is an important step.  I tossed my cooked wings in the hot sauce/butter mixture and let it sit for about 10 min before serving.  The wings stayed crisp and not soggy.  i will make this again (BUT with the cooking spray!!).  thanks, I'm sure we will be making these a lot with football season starting!  *****Update*****  spraying the pan with Pam or other spray is CRITICAL to make sure the wings don't stick.  I forgot AGAIN the second time I made these and they really stuck, when I made a try with spray first, then placed the raw wings on, then cooked the first side, then sprayed again....It worked GREAT!

These were great!!!  I usually don't use flour or dip them in anything (butter mixture) before I bake, but it truly made a big difference. The wings came out crunchy and yummy.

This is a variation on a recipe that I have. I do the flour the same, and coat the wings and allow them to sit at least 30 minutes but then I fry the wings and coat them in the hot sauce/butter mixture. I have always loved this recipe cause you can adjust the heat to your comfort level.

Delicious! After trying these, my son refuses to go back to the frozen Buffalo wings I used to buy! They're a lot of work, but worth it. I made a few changes. Do not use foil, the wings stick to it horribly! Instead, I used parchment paper. First of all, I added 1 tsp of cayenne pepper, 1 tsp of garlic powder, and 1/2 tsp of salt to the flour. (Because my guys love hot food)  I followed other reviewers's suggestions and thoroughly dried the wings before dredging them in the flour. Also to the sauce, I added a dash of black pepper, a dash of hot pepper flakes,  and a dash of garlic powder. Also, I used only 1/3 c. of butter and 1/2 c. of hot sauce because the sauce is not hot enough. Next, do not dip in the hot sauce mixture.  Bake wings at 425F for 25 minutes one one side, and then flip for 25 another minutes. Take them out, dredge them in the sauce mixture and then put them back in the oven, under the broiler on low for 5 minutes on each side.  Amazing! Going to make a ton for the Super Bowl.

defintely put much more cayenne pepper to add taste or else the wings will come out bland. For a thin crisp and juicy texture leave in the oven for 45-60 min. you will need a lot more hot sauce to dip all the wings into. you can add some brown sugar to the sauce to have a spicy and sweet combo

I have made them this way for years, and they are great.  

I found I can CUT a lot of calories by this method.  I skip the flour, butter, and dipping in hot sauce.   I bake them on a cookie sheet lined with foil, at 425 degrees for about 1 hour until they are golden and crispy.   This renders out most of the fat under the skin.    I don't use butter in my sauce anymore either.   I roll them through the hot sauce, straight from the bottle,  and enjoy them with a great lite Blue Cheese dressing.

This is a very tasty and easy alternative for those that would rather bake their wings than fry them. You will have to play with the cayenne and hot sauce portions to get your desired spicy taste. Using the portions listed will give you a mild spicy taste, in my opinion. To improve the crispy turnout after baking, I would suggest: 1) make sure the wings are thoroughly thawed; 2) pat dry the wings (using paper towels) before placing them in the flour mixture; 3) after flouring, place them in the refrigerator for an hour (the overnight suggestions I’ve been reading seem to be overkill); 4) bake the wings BEFORE rolling them in the sauce (25 mins on one side, 15 on the other); 5) drain the oil from the pan then roll the wings in the sauce, place them back on the pan; 6) cook for another 10 mins or so….until the wings get nice and crispy. If you prefer wet wings, I’d suggest making extra sauce to toss the wings in afterwards.

Yes I will make these again. The only change I made was to use parchment paper. Tin foil seem to stick, even though it was well oiled.

I'm going to blow your mind folks.  Dip the wings in the buffalo sauce first, and then roll in flour.  No need for refrigerating them.  I did two batches, side by side, one following the recipe, and one doing it my way.  My way was better.  Also, I cook wings in a large cast iron skillet for amazing flavor.

I made these today and they were far better than any other wings I have made in the past.  I added Tabasco for more spice and will use a hotter chili sauce next time.  My husband loved them and the aroma as they were baking was amazing, too.

Excellent all around!!  The spicing was perfect to give just a hint of heat, which is far better than the burn your mouth variety; that being said, you can definitely up the amount of cayenne if you like them hot hot.  They were a perfect texture, like being "fried" in the oven.  There were some complaints of the chicken being too soggy once baked but, as has been pointed out, extra time in the fridge after coating fixes that- I did 2-3 hours.  I have to agree, the original home of the buffalo wing can't top these!  My family loved them and begged for more!

Everyone in my family loves this but I always use season salt instead of all the other ingredients since season salt already has all that in it. They are amazing!!!!!!!!

I felt the need to offset some of the 1 star "I didn't follow directions and it didn't turn out, so I don't like it" reviews. 

If you follow it, it will work.  I used fresh wings; maybe people are getting soggy ones if they use frozen wings?

It's important to NOT crowd your pan (you do not want them touching), and make sure to use enough non-stick spray so you get all of the crispy goodness left on your wing.

The only modification I do is heat up some extra sauce (no butter this time, just sauce out of the bottle) and toss the crispy cooked wings in it at the very end, just to get that little extra zing.  Basically I originally did this because I had extra sauce, but not enough to keep for something else.

Probably the best chicken wings I have ever had. I made a big batch for the Redskins game last week, and needless to say the wings were the most enjoyable part of the afternoon. Everyone requested the recipe.

Great basic recipe. The two things we did differently that put them over the top: 1st we steamed them for 10 minutes to get rid of excess fat. Then, after drying, we dredged them in the dry ingredients, put them on a pan sprayed with cooking spray and baked. When we pulled them out, we tossed them in Frank's hot wing sauce, minus the butter to again reduce the fat content. With these adjustments we may never buy store bought wings again.

These are right up there with the fried version. As long as you refrigerate them as some of the reviewers stated, you'll be good to go!

Chicken gets stuck to the aluminum foil even after using cooking spray and can't turn them. Therefore they weren't able to be cooked evenly.

I dry my wings first, then I use 1/2 tspoon chilli powder instead of cayenne pepper and add 2 tablespoons of ranch salad dresing to cut some of the spiciness. I also use Frank's Red Hot Buffalo wing sauce. Love this recipe

The wings came out crispy but also bland. I had a suspicion that they would be so I added some crushed garlic to the butter mixture. I also followed the advice of some of the reviews and omitted the butter mixture until the wings had been baked at 425 for 50 minutes, then basted them and put them back in for another 10 minutes. That and drying them thoroughly beforehand really made them crispy. Unfortunately, the end result tasted only of hot peppers and garlic. Basically, the chicken will taste like whatever sauce you used and that's all. I was looking for something more interesting, more homemade. I will try this again if I can find a good recipe for sauce because I liked the crispiness but flavor-wise this was a bust.

I am making this recipe for the second time. Truly, the trick is to dry your wings and let them 'set'. :-) I don't use the red hot sauce because i need something milder and my significant other drenches everything with TABASCO sauce anyway. I will melt the butter and combine with a mixture of italian dressing & bbq sauce instead. Last time I made Jack DAniels sauce and poured that over the wings. These are delicious and I think whatever sauce you prefer will only enhance them.

I made these exactly as the recipe called and they turned out great. I may add more hot sauce next time...these weren't hot at all.  Hubby liked them, which is always the best sign.  I baked mine on a broiling pan so the grease would drip down.  Worked great! I did a few on a baking sheet with aluminum foil, as it called for, and they were a little soggy, but they were still good.  Broiling pan is best.  

Thanks for an easy to do recipe!!

I tried these last night.  The basic recipe is great!!!!  I did however change the cooking methods per other viewers. I baled them at 425 for 25 minutes per side, and did so on a broiler pan lined with a rack. When done, I dipped them in the sauce mix, then put them on a cookie sheet and broiled them on low for 3 minutes per side.  These turned out FANTASTIC!!!!!  My hubby was reluctant for me to try wings that were not deep fried, but he has changed his mind!!! The wings were just crispy and juicy...and oh so tasty...Thanks to all those who tried this recipe before me and tweaked it to make it perfect!!!!!

These wings were not as crispy as I thought they would be, but they were by no means soggy like some other posters called it. They were, in fact, fall-off-the-bone tender and delicious. I had to cook them an extra 10 minutes at 430 degrees, but overall, we were completely thrilled with the taste and texture. We dipped them in bleu cheese dressing and served them with fresh carrot sticks. Next time, I might make the flour mixture a little more spicy. I'm going to make these again!

This was my 1st time making buffalo wings (for NYE party)....and they were AMAZING!!!  I am not the least interested in trying a fried recipe!  I tweaked a couple of things for my liking.   I basically added more garlic powder, cayenne pepper and Lawry's season salt than suggested. In addition I added a little black pepper, paprika and onion powder.  Something else I did different was Once the chicken was completely finished and crisp, I placed all the chicken in a large skillet with the already prepared Franks hot sauce and butter sauce.  This was the first and only time the chicken was mixed with the sauce.  So the chicken was crispy yet full of sauce and juicy on the inside.  Served with blue cheese for dipping.  It was the best this way!!!!!!!!

I modified for 12 wings. Came out crispy on outside juicy on inside. Got nervous and added less hot sauce and were not spicy enough but still tasty. Next time I will add the suggested amount of hot sauce.

This is an answer to prayer for a fry-free wing that is still wonderful. Highly recommend this, even to use on your wing-fanatic relatives (like I did). Sometimes I place wings on a rack over the baking sheet, and this makes a crispy-all-'round wing. Good; even better.

I liked the method most of all, the coating created a seal that kept all the juices in, creating, by far, the juiciest chicken wings I have cooked! Usually when we try to do them in the oven all the juices run out and we are left with small  little wings!

I hate to be one of those people that changes somebody else's recipe around and then reviews but I am admittedly,a very picky cook and Buffalo Wings have been a favorite of mine since childhood so it is only natural for me to try,try and try again until it comes out perfect.I mean,literally,these Buffalo Wings are perfect and a favorite of my family.
If you want authentic Buffalo Wings I strongly recommend that you follow Chef John's Buffalo Wing Sauce recipe right here on Allrecipes.com BUT follow the first part of this recipe where you coat and bake the wings.
The combination of the two great recipes will produce delicious,authentic tasting Buffalo Wings right  in your own kitchen.
I lay down several sheets of paper towels and layer the wings, batch at a time on top and then press down on the wings with more paper towels to get them as dry as possible before coating in the flower mix.
I also prep them several hours(4-6) before baking time so that they can rest in the fridge a bit.
Make sure you are generous when spraying your foil lined sheet pan(s) with cooking spray as they have a tendency to stick if you don't.
Turning them after 24 minutes is very important so make sure that you set your timer.
They are crispy every time.

These are great!  We've made them twice now, and both times have been successful!  We use frozen "party wings" (they're a little bigger/meatier than the others).  I defrost them in water, which doesn't take long, and then put pat them off & start the recipe off w/ the flour mixture.  We usually use extra garlic in our flour mix (we use extra garlic in EVERYTHING!), and sometimes a little extra cayenne to kick up the heat, and ball park it on the salt (I hate measuring; hence, my complete inability to bake!)  I do let these rest on an elevated grated surface (think a cookie cooling rack), above a foil-lined cookie sheet, for at least an hour, in the fridge.  I dunk them very quickly (enough to coat) in the butter/red hot mix, and then bake immediately (on the same elevated rack - to allow the heat to circulate better).  I have found that the red hot mix isn't really enough to coat 20 large wings, so we usually end up having to make extra.  It would probably work with smaller wings though.  I turn them about 1/2 way through cooking.  In the last few minutes, I put the rack under the broiler on high to really crisp up the edges & brown them a little - just for a couple of minutes. They DO take about 45 minutes to an hour to cook, depending on size.  Also, I've found that the "flat" wings tend to cook a little better (melt in your mouth vs. work at it) than the drummies, even though I personally prefer drummies regularly.  This recipe is great - just plan on a couple of hours!

Not as crispy as I'd like.  I'd cook them longer (35 minutes side one, turn them, cook 15 minutes.)  Be sure to change the foil on the pan before you bake them.  The extra flour on the pan got mushy.  Great flavor.  Everyone loved them.  Very easy. I'd make them again.

This is a fabulous wing recipe!  After trying various recipes that we had found online, this has become our go-to.  Like many others have posted, we made sure to dry the wings before dredging, and we let them remain in the flour mixture overnight.  We never had an issue with cooking at 400 and getting soggy wings, but every oven is different so that may be the case with us, as I noted a few people saying they needed higher heat.  Ours always turn out crispy and delicious!

Really tasty and way healthier than frying. Thanks! Tip: I think broiling really helps with browning and crisping them up.

I thought they were too buttery, however it may have been because I had too much flour and the flour absorbed too much butter and since my hot sauce was mild, you could really taste the butter.

I did not like these wings at all - they were not crispy and all the butter sauce dripped off into the pan.  There was very little flavor on the wings.

Great Recipe! I make a couple of changes as we like to have crispier wings. After baking for about 30 minutes I change the wings over to a clean parchment lined baking sheet and continue baking for approximately another 30 minutes.  I have found this makes them nice and crispy on the outside. By far the best recipe I have used and way better than any store bought wings.

I was looking for a healthier alternative to delivered (deep-fried) buffalo wings, and this recipe came very close to being 5 stars, however, it left me wishing for a slightly stronger flavor.  Next time I will try adding more cayenne pepper and possibly garlic powder.  I followed the advice of many, many reviews that said you should dry the wings before putting them in the bag with the dry seasoning mix, so that it sticks better to the wings.  I measured the butter and placed it in a glass bowl and put it in the microwave for 30-45 seconds in order to melt it.  Because the recipe says it's for 20 wings and I had a little bit more than that I was concerned it wouldn't yield enough for all the wings, so I decided to double the recipe.  I had a lot of flour and butter/hot sauce mix left over, so next time I am going to make the wings without doubling the recipe to see if that is enough, I'm sure it will be.  Don't forget the blue cheese dip on the side!

It was only mildly spicy, and I expected something spicier, but they had a good flavor overall. I also ended up using drumsticks instead of wings because of the price difference.

2 stars is pushing it for me.   I love this site for new recipes, but this one just did not cut it for my family. The wings came out crispy, but the amount of oil (grease) they were swimming in at the end was worse than frying; and they were not hot at all.  I would suggust leaving out the flour if your not going to fry, cooking on a rack and sauceing after cooking.  They were edible but not great at all.   I will stick with tried and true when it comes to buffalo wings  I allso suggest doing these in a smaller batch to ese if you like them before serving them to anyone else.

This recipe was great. I altered it by - using chilli powder instead of cayenne, dried wings thoroughly using paper towels, baked on a rack as most people advised, did not turn, baked for 35 minutes, removed to immerse each wing entirely in the sauce then returned to oven for another 15 minutes.

I make  a VERY hot wing sauce of 1/2 cup butter, 1/4 cup sriracha, 1/4 cup habanero pepper sauce, a mild hot wing sauce using 1/2 cup butter & 1/2 cup sriracha and a sweet sauce using 1/2 cup butter 1/2 cup honey.

Thank you to the original poster, and the AR community for giving such great feedback. These delicious wings really made our Super Bowl party and my older relatives were amazed, asking "how after 40 years of cooking can such a young man make such delicious wings for us?!!?"

I bake my wings all of the time and was looking for a different recipe.  When I saw that many people stated theirs ended up soggy, I went back to look at the temperature.  I always have to bake mine at 425 for at least a full hour turning over after 30 min.  I will try the resting in the refrigerator - never tried that before.

This recipe is great for the seasoning mix!  Make sure the chicken is patted dry before dredging in the seasoning.  I also refrigerated for about 2 hours.  Another modification was that I added the chicken drippings to the hot sauce mix after baking, and sauced the wings after baking them, just to ensure that they didn't get soggy.  Mine turned out amazingly yummy!

Great wings. Dredging in flour mix really helps create a crispy exterior.  I will make these again and again!  And of course add blue cheese dressing for dipping.

Disapointed. Still in search of a worthy recipe for crispy buffalo wings. Followed the recipe almost exactly. Patted the wings dry. Coated with the flour and spice mix and put them in the fridge overnight. After baking in the oven for 50 minutes and turning over mid way, the wings, although tasty were not crispy at all. Yes, I could have increased the cooking time but the rest of the meal was ready and so were the guests. If I try this recipe again, I will likely broil them after baking for 45 minutes until crispy.

Great recipe! They could have been a bit spicier, but that is most likely because of the sauce I used. I also used half butter and half Smart Balance Omega oil to make it healthier. These turned out super crispy and full of flavor!

Made these for a football game gathering, and they were a big hit. I was very concerned about the baked wings being crispy enough, and these were, with some adjustments.  Baked at 425 for 45 minutes, poured the juices off the pan, turned the wings, and cooked for another 45 minutes.  Then I tossed the wings in Frank's Red Hot and returned to the oven for another 10 minutes.  No need to use the butter - wings are fattening enough.  I used lots of Pam, but did have trouble with the wings sticking to the foil.  I'll probably use more vegetable oil next time.  I was intimidated, but these were really pretty easy.  Now that I know how, I'll make these again sometime.

This is a great recipe and a simple tweak, makes it perfect!! Just replace the cayenne pepper with any jerk seasoning, raise the temp to 450, place wings on cookie sheet and cook for 15mins and then put the hot sauce combo on and bake for another 15mins and  then turn over and put hot sauce combo on that side. This is an absolute favorite of friends, family, and co-workers :)

I had to do alot of substitution for this recipe card. I omit flour and used red pepper paste in place of hot sauce. Some of the other things I added were vinegar, chilli sauce, chilli powder, sugar and some dijon mustard. I poured a bit of Texas Pete hot sauce in wing mixture to give it more flavor. Everything else stayed the same. This is not my typical recipe for hot wings in that I was looking for more seasonings to be added and a VERY SPICY taste to them. Other then that it is good that you post recipes on site and continue to do that. If you come up with another buffalo wing recipe please add to this site and I will be willing to try it.

I followed the recipe as directed and was a little disappointed that the wings weren't more flavorful.  Once past the skin, the chicken was very bland.  I don't know if I need to marinate longer or with something else, but it wasn't what I was expecting.  However, my kids did like the skin - a few minutes under the broiler made it REALLY crispy - on the chicken I just brushed with butter, no hot sauce.  Not a bad recipe - I'll probably try it again with a few changes.

Wish I had read the reviews first! Definitely not crispy with the original recipe. I broiled mine for a few minutes towards the end and that helped but they were still pretty soggy and quite a mess. Good flavor though so I'll definitely try again, this time using all the suggestions in the reviews.

This recipe was excellent.  I will definitely use it again.  You just can't keep the uncooked floured wings in the fridge over night, they get a bit soggy.

EXCELLENT recipe!  I followed the advice of many reviews that said to dry the wings off with a paper towel first and that seemed to have worked perfect because the wings were nice and crispy.  My husband (who LOVES his wings) says these are the best homemade ones he's had so far.  This is definitely a keeper!  (As a side note, I used Buffalo Wild Wings Medium sauce instead of Frank's RedHot).

Outstanding.  I used frozen chicken wings from costco.  Just dipped them in the flour mixture then into the sauce (no refrigeration necessary if the wings are frozen).  Cooked for 30 minutes each side, basting with leftover sauce when I turned them.  Cooked them at 400 but on convection setting.  Also used a full cup of Franks rather than the recommended half cup

I changed this recipe a bit after reading several other wing recipes. These turned out great. I baked them at 425.  I did add a splash of vinegar to hot sauce/ butter mix. I also baked wings after dredging in flour mixture before mixing with sauce.

These came out great!  I cooked up 10 wings, and cut one breast into 5 pieces.  Followed the recommendations of others and dried the chicken out.  The wings were pretty good, could have used just a tad more spice.  But the tenders were fantastic!  I highly recommend you make this recipe with some tenders.  It's a must have.

Tip: When the wings are done they're "dry".  Make sure you add the Frank's sauce to the outside of them to make them wet.

These are awesome!!!!! I made these for the first time during football season to bring to a tailgate party. The second time I made them I made a huge amount of them and my hubby brought the extras to work the next day, he shared them wth all the guys he worked with. The next they all gave him money to buy ingredients and begged him to get me to make them for them for lunch that Friday. I have made these many times and everyone that has tried them has begged for more. I have taken a short cut I put the flour and seasonings in a large zip lock bags and put them in the fridge for an hour or so. Then I follow the recipe exactly using Franks Hot wing sauce and butter. Thank you so much for this recipe. I will never wings any other way. I have also used this recipe with pieces of boneless/skinless chicken breasts to make nuggets.Jjust need to cut down on cooking time they turned out great too.

These were delicious!  The sauce baked right into them so they weren't nearly as messy as most wings.  I only had time to refrigerate them for about 20 minutes and they turned out just as delicious as others have stated.

Thanks Leesah for this GREAT recipe!
These wings are awesome! My family dislikes wings swimming in Buffalo wing sauce because of the mess. This recipe has the full Buffalo sauce flavor w/o the mess. Everyone raved about the wings!
Great bar style food w/o the expensive bar prices!
IMPORTANT – crack all of the wing joints first.
I always rinse and thoroughly pat dry any meat before dredging them in flour and I refrigerate them for at least an hour before cooking them, I do the same with any meat that has an egg wash. Doing so ensures that the breading won’t get soggy and will remain on the meat during the cooking process. I refrigerated the wings for 90 minutes after dredging them in the flour mix.
I followed the rest of the recipe instructions and baked them with the wing tips (yes, I like the crispy skin on wing tips) facing up at 400°F for 30 minutes, flipped the wings and baked for another 30 minutes till they were nicely browned and crispy. I served the wings with Bleu Cheese salad dressing, celery sticks and carrot sticks.
I served the choice of beer or iced tea as beverages to accompany this dish.
Yummo!!!

These were very good, although I did have to go less on the spicyness for my kiddos. The only thing that truly annoyed me was the overwhelming buring smell from the butter! Next time I will place the chicken on the broiler pan that was provided and let the fast and excess butter drip down inside of burning on the pan.

I wish I could give these more than 5 stars. They are my all-time favorite wings. My family thinks that they are too hot and spicy but, I think they are absolute perfection. I will never change anything about this recipe. Thanks for sharing it!!

This recipe is awesome and has quickly become a family favorite.  I use boneless strips, cut into chunks, and fix as directed, but bake for about 35-40 minutes, turning once.  I then put some dipping sauces of choice (our favorites are Caribbean Jerk and Honey Chipotle) in two small dishes and warm in the microwave.  Dip the cooked chunks and ENJOY!!!  We absolutely love it and feel it is the closest to Buffalo Wild Wings that I have been able to come.

My Boyfriend and I made this recipe for Super Bowl this year and it went over great at the party. We accidentally bought Frank's "Buffalo Style" wing sauce instead of the original brand. Doing this will give you a very mild taste, as there is already butter flavor in the branded sauce. We tried the recipe again but with Chicken Legs. We bought the Original Sauce, cooked at 350 degress for 25 minutes, flipped them over once and glazed the legs and cooked for another 10 minutes. We then broiled the legs for 5 minutes to get the skin crisp according to previous suggestions. They were cooked perfectly and tasted fantastic! Great Saturday evening dinner!

Thanks for this easy recipe, we really enjoyed it and it was so easy to make.  It wasn't exactly like the saucy buffalo wings I was craving but it came out spicy and crispy on the outside.  I used chicken thighs cut up into smaller pieces and it was so juicy.  Also I used tabasco sauce and it was delicious.

Hard to get crispy and very greasy. Maybe taking off the skin will help.

A big hit with the family.  I did cut my wings into 3 sections (discarding the tip) first, and used a metal rack on the baking sheet.  Result was wonderfully browned and non-soggy.  I was concerned about it being too spicy (for the kids) but it wasn't (can always add pepper sauce to taste at the table).

These were a huge hit!!!  Take the advice from others, Dry the wings first, then let them sit with the flour mixture in the fridge uncovered for longer than an hour.  Then Bake them on a rack so the juices drip down. I also increased the baking temp to 425 and cooked 50 mins.  They were AWESOME.  My guests kept complimenting on how good they were for baked wings :)  Thanks for the recipe!  Super Bowl was a hit!

Great (and simple!) little recipe, thanks.  I have been wanting to try making buffalo wings, $14 at sams club for the bag you can bake, knew it must be simple to make our own, and it was.  I used what i had on hand, so had to make a few subsitutions, used cut up chicken breast instead of the wings, used chipolte powder instead of the cayenne pepper and baked the little gems at 425 for 20 minutes instead of 400.  Made 2 pans, my boys were lined up with their plates waiting for the 2nd pan to be done!

This is a solid recipe for oven baked buffalo wings. I make two changes in procedure to help prevent soggy wings. I bake them on a rack to let the grease drip down, and I bake them without the butter and sauce. Once they're cooked, I melt the butter in a frying pan and stir in the sauce. I then drop the wings into the hot frying pan and toss to coat.

Great recipe!  Great taste and easy to make.  I followed the instructions without any changes.  Make sure the wings are totally dry before adding to the flour mixture to ensure best results.  Turning off the oven and letting sit in the oven for about 15 minutes caramelizes any remaining sauce.    Terrific!

Love love love this recipe!  As I was turning them over halfway though cooking I got nervous that they wouldn't be crispy on the outside and I remembered in one of the reviews the reviewer suggested placing them on a rack on the pan so I quickly transferred them to a rack (inside a lined pan) and let them finish.  I didn't use the same hot sauce as the recipe calls for just because I had something else in the refrigerator.  I also added a little more sauce after they were finished because I wanted more heat.  These wings were delicious!  A little crispy on the outside and super juicy on the inside!  I can't wait to make this again!!!

I struggled between 4 stars and 5 stars with this recipe.  Yes, I have had better, but they were deep fried and not baked.  I used bbq sauce instead of hot sauce because we were eating these for supper with 3 small children.  But my family ate them up fast, and they were easy to make, and tasted great! So, 5 stars it is.

The reason that I'm only giving this recipe 4 stars is because I think that the sauce should be put on AFTER baking.  We did everything as directed, except put on a rack above a pan to bake so the wings weren't sitting in their own fat the whole time.  They came out good, but there just wasn't enough hot-wing sauce flavor on them.  After eating a few I ended up putting them all in a bag and pouring Franks over them again.  THEN they were fantastic!

I made these for my bday party and they were a big hit! I didn't dip them in the sauce before baking since I saw it makes them soggy. I lined a cookie sheet with foil, and put a cooling rack on the cookie sheet and baked the wings on top of the cooling rack. They were totally crispy!  I had the Franks buffalo wing sauce allready so I just dumped that over the wings and spun them around in the bowl. These were delicious and there were no leftovers! **Oh..and definitely pat the chicken dry before covering it in flour!

It was ok .... I think I like the traditional way of dipping them in sauce after they are cooked better.  These just didn't seem to have the same "zip" normal wings have.

I put these in the fridge, coated with the flour mixture, all day. I cook them on racks on baking trays, so that the juices drip down and away (I've tried doing as the recipe suggests, as well, but everyone preferred the "racked" wings, because they were crispier). These taste fabulous, and with bleu cheese dressing, even better. This will be a regular sports-night meal....!

these were great.  I made three different kinds of wings b/c I didn't think my kids would want these spicy ones but thought my husband would love them - well, he did love them, but my 5 yr old wouldn't touch the others, but loved "Daddy's chicken" as well.  Next time, this will be the only recipe I make.  I followed it exactly, using sriracha sauce for the hot sauce.  Yum!  thanks for the great recipe.

This was a great recipe! I used Bisquick instead of all-purpose flour & it worked great--gave it a little bit of a sweet taste. also for the sauce, I combined traditional chicken wing sauce with Italian dressing, some more garlic powder, & cajun seasoning. Delicious!

This were REALLY good, particularly for my first time making wings. I took the advice of the reviewers and baked these on wire racks. Also increased the temperature to 425 degrees, cooked for a full hour, and basted extra sauce on them halfway through. They weren't super crispy, but they weren't soggy either. You'll never be able to get the crispness of frying, but baking is a little better for you.   Next time I will probably forgo most of the butter and do more hot-sauce. They weren't that spicy at all (but Frank's Hot Sauce isn't that spicy). Will also double the sauce recipe to coat after baking - I like wet wings. Great, easy recipe!

These wings have wonderful flavor.  The recipe does not say to disjoint the wings and remove the excess skin and dispose of the tips, but that should be done. (I discovered that the hard way.)  Of course, most people who eat buffalo wings know this, but I was concentrating on following directions and didn't think of it until they were done. I did this the second time I made them and they turned out crispy and perfect.  Also, the leftovers were even tastier reheated the next day.  A very good recipe!

I loved the idea of baking the wings - so much healthier!  I followed all of the instructions except when it came to baking.  Frank's RedHot suggested I bake the wings at 500 degrees for 20 minutes AND THEN dip the wings in the sauce (so sauce after baking) and I thought this might clear up the issue regarding soggy wings.  It set off the fire alarm for being too smoky, so next time I'll bake em longer at a lower setting.  But they were perfectly crisp!  So my suggestion - don't add the sauce until the end :)

For a baked recipe I thought they turned out wonderful! To help cut the fat I cut up boneless skinless chicken breast into large chunks (similar to a boneless buffalo wings) and it turned out really good! It's far easier and less mess than frying chicken!

These wings are fantastic!  I love the fact that they are baked instead of fried.  The skin on the chicken mixes with the flour coating and creates a crispy texture.  I've made these twice.  The first time I dipped them in the sauce before baking.  The second time I dipped them after baking.  Dipping them after baking was much better (and messier!).  They turn out tangier if you dip them after baking.  I also used the "Absolutely the best Blue Cheese Dressing ever!" recipe to serve with the wings and they were a huge hit!

Loved  these wings!  It's important  to dry them off before  dredging in flour.  I also broiled 3-5 minutes after baking.  I can't wait to make them again.  I  also cut back to 2-3 tsps of cayenne pepper because hubby doesn't like real  hot!

We made the recipe as it reads, only halved it, with all the cayenne pepper and found them to have good flavor.  My husband did mention that they were too buttery tasting and didn't like that he had consumed a couple tablespoons of butter.  We found it made a lot of the flour mixture, so maybe add some of the dry mixture to a bag with the wings and save the rest for the next wing craving.  We used Paula Deen's hot sauce and needed more hot sauce than called for for good heat.  Overall, a great baked wing that we will try again.  My only complaint...make sure you plan ahead.  The hour refrigeration time and 45 minute baking time sets back your wing chow time!

Wonderful flavor! Crispy and delicious! Made exactly as written (except for Cayenne, where I saw that it should have been 1/2 tsp).  Really tried hard to dry off wings before coating with flour, and that helped them to be nice and crispy.  As a wing lover, in a house full of wing lovers, these were just perfect and will be a wonderful addition to my recipe box!

Thank you so much for posting this recipe. I lost mine when my hard drive fried last year. I'm so excited to make these tonight. This is our FAVORITE family wing recipe. Sinfully simple and so delicious. The only thing I do differently is use less butter.

My family says these were the best wings they've every had...counting "professional" ones from BW's.  They were tender and crispy and very flavorful. I didn't use the 5 t of cayenne, just probably 1 t, and some garlic and onion powders and salt.  I did add about 1/2 cup of Panko bread crumbs. I patted the wings dry and let them sit for a bit as others have recommended.  Then dredged them in sauces and butter before baking.  I used an actual cookie sheet and would recommend using something closer to a jelly roll pan (something with some sides) as they cook out some and the cookie sheet was in danger leaking drippings onto the bottom of the oven. They were a little labor intensive but well worth it. Thanks for the recipe!

I read the reviews first, and found the misprint for the amt of cayenne pepper. I used 1 1/2 tsp cayenne and the wings turned out great! Hubby said they weren't so hot/spicy but were still good. The next day though, the heat seemed to increase, but were still yummy. The wings were not soggy, even though there were puddles on the baking sheet. I made sure to remove the wings from the pan asap so they wouldn't soak up the grease. Thanks for a great recipe Leesah!

Delicious! It was my first time baking wings as well so I followed the recipe exactly (except I added additional cayenne) and broiled them the last five minutes or so for extra crispiness. Definitely five stars though!

These are amazing Buffalo wings, baked not fried. I followed others suggestions and blotted the wings well before flouring them. I cooked them on a cookie cooling rack over a jelly roll pan. Spray the rack well with cooking spray so the wings don't stick. I flipped them half way through the cooking time. We like our wings spicy, so I used just a quarter cup of butter. Next time I may use less. I shook the baked wings in the hot sauce/butter mix. They were delicious, not greasy at all, and are now a Sunday staple!

These were edible, but as many have complained they are pretty soggy. And why coat them with flour? Breading wings is time and work for nothing, they're better just with sauce.

VERY tasty! I was surprised by how crispy they got. They can get a little greasy though, so I would recommend going light on the butter. I actually used olive oil to brush on mine and they still turned out great.

I had been using a mix with a baking bag or buying frozen, but this was delicious and easy. I make 6 "Buffalo Breast" and substituted a hot barbecue rub (we were out of cayenne). I only chilled for 15-20 minutes and it still worked well. You can make bone-in breast for dinner - it bakes at 400 deg for 45 minutes then broil for 5-10 more. You could probably do this with tenders to make an appetizer and this would bake much more quickly.

I tried these, hoping for a healthier option for buffalo wings and I followed the other reviews suggestions of patting them really dry and using a wire rack over the cookie sheet so they wouldn't sit in juice etc... these were still soggy and I will not try them again.

We love this recipe. Our wings have turned out great every time!! It's nice to bake them rather than deep-fry.

I used 4 lbs of wings with this recipe and the finished product was great....received rave reviews from everyone!  They were spicy enough to know it, but not too spicy to keep folks from eating them.  Easy....I did broil for a couple of minutes to really crisp up.  I did follow the recommendation to really dry the wings before dredging...I can see that would make a difference.

We Loved These! Want to make wings for the Super Bowl (Go Steelers) but dont want them deep fried, gave this a trail run last night and we are sold!  I waited till the end and basted them with the hot sauce instead of at the start, and gave them about 10 more minutes in the oven with sauce on and...Perfect!!

I made these for my brother-in-law! He LOVED them. I like spicy food, but these were WAY to hot for me to enjoy!. For myself, I would cut the cayenne to 2.5 teaspoons. The spicy food lover will certainly be pleased.

Tasty wings, but it's not exactly healthy as "Baked" would imply.
Swimming in butter and I don't think I have quite the right Hot Sauce. The brand I got was so hot that I only used a 1/4 of what the recipe called for and it turned out to be an acceptable hotness but didn't quite have enough of that spicy and sour flavour. Will keep looking for a better hot sauce.

My husband and I didn't love these.  Although they were nice and crunchy on the outside, they were kind of mushy on the inside.  Others may like moist chicken wings.  I may be a rarity because I think I like them kind of dry inside.  But, this is a nice switch from fried wings and the flavor was nice.

I will never fry buffalo wings again after realizing I can make such crispy delicious wings in the oven. I made some changes to the recipe though. I omitted the garlic powder and added paprika. To prevent wasting spices and for more flavor I seasoned the chicken directly, and then added to the bag of plain flour. I kept them in the bag instead of transfering them to a baking sheet. They absorbed more of the coating this way. Make sure you keep the wings in the flour for at least an hour though, its a must. I also didn't add the sauce until after baking, and I don't think the wings would've came out as crispy, or crispy at all if i did. I used a much higher ratio of hot sauce to butter because I love the heat.

This recipe is great! I bake some with the red pepper and butter sauce and some without. They are really great either way. They come out crispy and delicious.

Tastes fantastic, and while not normally what I practice, followed the measured ingredients precisely.and ended up having exactly the right texture; I’d change two things: double the sauce recipe, save half to toss in for after the wings are cooked. Second, I strongly recommend parchment paper, as the wings stuck pretty badly to the foil.

Absolutely great!  As others said, thoroughly dry the wings. I used paper towels - overnight in fridge. Then dipped in flour mixture and put back in fridge for an hour or so.  Baked using cooling racks on cookie sheets, then dipped in hot sauce and return to oven for a few minutes to crisp a bit.

These were delicious! After reading about soggy wings I made a few variations because we like crispy wings and they were a hit from my 13 yr old son, my teenage daughter and my hubby and me. DO NOT dredge them in the buffalo sauce right away. I baked at 425 for 20 minutes skin side up, flipped over and baked another 20. I took them out and dipped them in the sauce and returned them to the oven on broil for 5 minutes and then another 5 minutes flipped to the other side. enjoy and I suggest making extras!

I've made these wings countless times since finding this recipe a few years ago.  I skip the 1 hr refrigeration without noticing any negative drawbacks.  I changed the ratio of butter to hot sauce from 1:1 to 1:2.  I cook on Convection at 375 degrees F for 53 minutes.  Racks that suspend the wings above the pan by the wing's "wrist" are also a must to keep for tearing half the skin off of the wing.  Definitely a family favorite!

Awesome Recipe!  It had a little kick to it!  Was good plain and dipping in the different sauces, or just eating  plain.  I really liked them tossed in the chicken and rib sauce too!  Have a few different varieties!  It's all yummy!

Most delicious!  I use parchment paper rather than tin foil and I highly recommend it - it doesn't stick.  Seems like no matter how much you grease the foil, the wings stick to it like glue.  I refrigerate the coated wings for at least TWO hours.  I also don't put the hot sauce on the wings, I just serve it on the side.  This way the wings remain wonderfully crisp, and if someone doesn't care for hot sauce they can eat the wings plain.

I got rants and raves over New Years Eve celebration for my wings!! I made exactly 50 wings so doubled the recipe of dry ingredients and used one cup butter and 1.5 cups Franks. 

Washed and put in fridge overnight on plastic wrap. Next day I patted each piece with paper towel. I didn’t have flour so I used almond flour (amazing) tossed them in dry and placed on foil lightly sprayed with oil and baked for an hour. Took out, tossed generously in wet and baked for another half hour. Served with celery and organic Ranch.  Yummmmm

I am a huge wing fan and these are such an easy alternative. You have to make sure the wings are good and dry before coating with flour and refrigerate before dipping into the wing sauce....the longer the better. Bake on a cooling rack in a pan and they crisp right up.

The Buffalo wings came out great! It was my first time ever making them, ever. I used a hot sauce that said"Buffalo won't sauce" and went from there.  I used the wings I got from the grocery and didn't use the ones that are super small. Mine were giant compared to what you get in a restaurant. But boy were they good!! Thank you, All Recipes!!

Just as good as fried plus the advantage of less calories and less mess to clean up.. The only way to fix buffalo wings. I did flour them and put in refrigerator most of the day... otherwise followed the recipe exactly...

Made this for Super Bowl LI and those who like spicy gobbled them up.  We followed the recipe to a T, except my girls refrigerated the wings in a Ziploc instead of on the baking sheet.  All turned out well. :)

The hubster and I both loved these! We toned them down quite a bit (trouble digesting spicy food) We separated each wing into 2 pieces before seasonings. Followed the recipe the rest of the way. I can't imagine why anybody would be disappointed!

These are so good! I made them exactly how the recipe reads. I might add more hot sauce next time. Make sure you have the edges of the foil turned up so the sauce and grease doesn't pour over the sides in the oven. I learned this the hard way and set off my smoke alarms.

As written I have to give this a 2 star. I used chicken legs instead of wings but other than that followed the recipe with the exception of adding more cooking time because of the larger size of the legs. I read that at one point the cayenne pepper was in a larger amount and I think that would help for those that enjoy a harsher heat profile. I find cutting the butter in half than what's recommended  to Frank's sauce helps too. But a recipe should be good as written without modifications...hence the review.

This is our go to baked buffalo chix wing recipe. To keep the wings crispy, we bake the wings without the sauce. After baking, we then toss them in the sauce. It also helps to cook the wings on top of a wire cooling rack so they sit above the baking sheet and don't get soggy in all the juices. You also don't have to turn them half way when doing it this way. We also like a spicier sauce so do 1/4 cup butter to 3/4 cup Frank's hot sauce, perfect!!

We loved these. I baked without any sauce for 20 minutes and then turned over and brushed with sauce and baked 25 more minutes. Brushed rest of sauce on after I took them out of oven. Not soggy at all and crispy. My husband kept raving.

Fantastic!  Followed the recipe exactly, with two changes.  Instead of butter, used 1/2 olive oil and 1/2 veggie oil for the total amount called for butter (for a less saturated fat version). After being baked, I broiled the wings about 6 inches from the heat source 10 min. turned them over and repeated for another 10. This will be my go to recipe for wings.  Thank you so much for sharing your love of cooking with us all.

Totally defrost and blot wings before preparing to cook.
If you use frozen wings they'll get very soggy and wet.
The recipe is wonderful, if wings aren't frozen.

I disagree that overnight in the fridge doesn't work.  It made a huge difference. The flour mixture stuck only a little bit after a few hours in the fridge, even after I made sure the legs were nice and dry. Overnight and it stuck to make a nice thick crust .  I did chicken legs and used both skinless and skin on legs. Both turned out wonderfully.  I did not take out the legs halfway through and re-dip them in the sauce. Just flipped them half way through. Really good. Used a foil lined tray to bake them.  And instead of hot sauce, I used sirracha.

Great recipe! I thought the wings were very tasty and I did not miss them being fried. I must agree with making sure the wings are dry before dredging them in the flour mixture. It makes all the difference.

These were perfect with Frank's Red Hot Buffalo Wings sauce, exactly what I want when I want wings. Baking them,  the skin crisped up and the meat just fell right off the bones, they were delicious. My hubby prefers boneless wings over bone-in, but he even loved these wings! A keeper, and this will be a go-to recipe.

The sauce mixture was exactly enough for 2 dozen wings, had to roll the last half dozen around in the bowl to coat them.

I do suggest serving extra sauce on the side for dipping if you like them hot and saucy, they were quite mild without that. I will try brushing more sauce on them for the last 5 or 10 minutes of bake time next time I make these!

Wings do not need any butter. The problem with mixing the sauce with the butter is that you don't get that much sauce on the wings. I like my wings crispy and spicy. Next time I'll add more cayenne pepper to the flour (twice the recipe), no salt (because the buffalo sauce is seasoned enough), and no butter (because the skin has enough fat). I cooked them on 425 F for 20 minutes each side, then BROILED each side for 5 minutes to get the skin toasted. I recommend getting ready to cook wings (frozen perhaps) so you don't have to go through the trouble of cutting the pieces (not good butcher skills here).

First time ever making Buffalo wings.  As soon as I started, I realized I made a big mistake - I didn't thaw the wings beforehand, so I had to do it in the microwave.

In the end, I followed most of comments and dried the (more or less thawed) wings with a paper towel.  I am a hot head, but didn't think I needed the cayenne pepper.  I figured that 1/2 cup of Franks hot sauce was enough, and it was.  Heat wise, it was about the same as a typical "hot" chicken wing at a restaurant.  Perfectly balanced.

Like the other reviewers, I dipped them in sauce towards the end of the bake.

The main problem with these is that I didn't make enough.  My family cleaned them out.  My wife claims that they were better than her fried chicken, something that is physically impossible :)

I made them according to recipe, using parchment paper rather than foil, and I had extra wings, so I made a batch per recipe and the method of not dipping them in the butter mixture before baking. The original recipe way was far better!! I did however, drain the fat from the first batch before turning. They browned up very nicely, and were very crispy,  and the spice was perfect. I will definitely make them again, as per recipe!

***********EDIT TO ADD ANOTHER VERSION - Last night I roasted a whole chicken using this recipe using the same steps - DRY the chicken, dredge in the flour mixture, refrigerate for 2hrs, preheat oven to 375 on convection, pour the butter sauce over the chicken and brush onto spots that got missed, put 1/2 lemon inside the bird, baked approx 1-1/2 hrs (use your own judgement as oven temps vary). I put the chicken on a rack in a roasting pan and added some water to prevent burning the pan.
This chicken was awesome! Nice crispy skin and full of flavour - adjust spices to your personal liking. I added more heat. This is going to be my go to for wings and roasted whole chicken!

I've made these so many times. I bake them, without the butter and Franks, until done and crispy and then toss them with my own version of wing sauce  (hot sauce/butter/liquid smoke/water/cornstarch) before serving. This method replaced my old one, which was grilling. It took lots of baby sittting and I burned them more than once. This method is basically fool proof. You can also adjust the seasoning to your own liking. Using parchment paper makes clean up much easier. I love this method.

I, too, dried off my wings before tossing them in to the flour mixture. I also cooked them on a wire rack to keep them from sitting in their own grease. I used only the flat onesand did not flip them. They don't come out soggy at all. The batter bakes to a lite crispy texture. I had a lot of the flour batter leftover and will use less flour next time. I recommend more cayenne, if you want any it to be hotter than mild.

Very tasty!  Husband who LOVED hot wings gave this a double thumbs up.  I did end up frying them but followed the recipe other than that.  second batch we sprinkled with old bay seasoning after they gave out from resting in fridge.  Also very good.

Made theses yesterday and were delish!!! The only difference I did was I did not coat them in the sauce... After they came out I put them in a bowl and pored the sauce on them and tossed them around... I received many complements... Tip: purchase the non stick foil... It makes a huge difference:)

This is a great recipe! Patting dry before coating with flour mixture and resting in the refrigerator is the key to crispy wings. I add just a touch more cayenne for my hubby who likes spicy hot. Thanks for sharing.

I live in Buffalo NY, the birthplace of "Buffalo Wings" and these were just as good as anything here, without the frying. Hometown wings never ever use flour, but if you want to bake, the flour adds a level of crispness you wouldn't have otherwise. Delicious, crisp and so good. The only suggestion I would have is to wait to the end to dip in the butter/hot sauce. Dip hot wings into sauce using a set of tongs and just set back on the cookie sheet in the oven for a few more minutes. They'll be crispy and saucy. Enjoy this great recipe.

These are as good as any restaurant. My boyfriend said, "if the way to a man's heart is through his stomach, I should propose to you after that." (He didn't haha.) I followed the recipe exactly with one exception: I waited until after the wings were baked to coat them with my sauce of choice. Took them out of the oven, tossed them in a Tupperware container with the sauce, shook them up, and they were ready to serve! Crispy and delicious.

Amazing! Made for the Super Bowl this year, and they were absolutely fantastic. Followed other reviewer's advice, and baked the wings in the flour mixture for 25 minutes, flipped for an additional 10, and THEN added the sauce. Turned out crispy and delicious! Also, I halved the sauce mixture, 1/4 cup butter, 1/4 cup hot sauce. Thought it might be too much, and I was right! The half version was plenty for all of my wings :) Definitely will make again!

They were excellent!  The only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 is because there was a lot of grease on my pan when I cooked them in the oven.  I liked the recommendation to cook them on a cooling rack (didn't know those things could go in the oven at 400!) because I think this will help them to not be so soggy.  But all of my kids and hubby gobbled them up!  With the proportions of spices this recipe isn't very hot so be sure to adjust the cayenne if you want to make them hotter.

Delicious!  I used boneless, skinless thighs cut into tender-sized pieces.  I baked them on a rack as others suggested.  They turned out nice and crispy!  Since we like spice, I used 3tsp of my own cayenne pepper in the flour mix and Stubb's "Inferno" chicken wing sauce.....they were out of his world!!

I have made this recipe five times and each time it gets better.  I changed some of the methodology per the advice of other reviewers: 1) I made sure the wings were very dry. 2) I didn't have a baking rack and instead used a roasting pan (wings came out nice and crispy!) 3)I did not refrigerate after dredging. 4) I used the modified amount of cayenne pepper (1/2 tsp). 5) I baked them without the sauce half way through on 400 then brushed on liberal amounts of wing sauce mixture and baked them for the rest of the time on 450. 6) after taking them out brushed on some more sauce to have a crispy yet saucy texture.  This review has been Hubby tested and approved of the improved methodology :)

I tried making these several times and no matter how much time I cooked them the outside would not get crispy one bit. The flavor is great but i just couldn't get the consistency I wanted.

Easy and tasty. I used boneless breast and cut them into nuggets. I cut the time to 25 minutes. They stayed moist. A new Super Bowl recipe! ??

I love this recipe. I use it as a base. Cut the wing tips off and make sure they're dry. I just use red hot and butter and it's amazing. Everyone loves them.

I've made this several times and felt I had to let everyone know .... These are GREAT.  The fact that there is NO frying (all done in the oven)so no mess.  I like that I can control the 'heat'.  I usually use legs and thighs (more meat) FANTASTIC.  Thank You!! debbie

I like really this recipe...Tonight I made a few changes though. I did a half corn starch,  half four mixture and I used a Cajun seasoning. I also cooked the wings in a cast iron skillet. The corn starch actually helped crisp the wings and the skillet kept the wings from burning. I used just a little oil too. I cranked the heat to 450 for an extra 10 minutes at the end.

My husband and I love wings but I hate the house smells after deep fry the wings. I made these wings today and they turned out great. I only refridge the wings for 15 minutes because my husband was starving. They were still crispy. I will for sure make wings more often now.

Great recipe. The only thing I changed was that I added a little brown sugar to the hot sauce and butter mix. It gave it just the touch of sweetness that I like.

I followed this recipe EXACTLY and it was so delicious! No need to make any changes, it was perfect! My husband and I gobbled them up. Every oven is different however, so after 45 minutes mine still needed more time, I would say I left them in for an hour. Will absolutely make these again, so easy and tasty!

I make wings and pizza every Friday for my family. Add a dash of white vinegar and worcestershire sauce and a sprinkle of garlic powder to the sauce, just toss wings in sauce after finished baking. I don't refrigerator the chicken and I use organic thighs cut into bite size pieces.

This recipe was amazing.  I ended up letting the wings sit in the flour mixture overnight (more from laziness and time constraint).  Since they were slightly damp, some of the flour had become pasty but I just added more flour and they coated fine.  I followed the advice of another reviewer (Vandygirl29) and baked for 25 min on each side at 425 on a cooling rack.  They came out amazingly crispy.  I then actually used Sweet Baby Rays buffalo wing sauce to bake for an additional 5 min and then coated them in sauce to my liking once done cooking.  These were absolutely amazing.  I'll probably be making my own buffalo wings from now on.  This recipe can also easily be used for other flavors.  I'm a fan of Wing Stop's lemon pepper flavor.  Can't wait to do that next!

This is a really good chicken wing recipe!!! If you love blazing wings from Wal-Mart, then you'll love these wings. I added 1/2 tea. onion powder, 1/2 tea. cayenne pepper, we like it spicy, 1/2 tea. white sugar  you could also use brown if you wish, 1/2 tea. lemon pepper and 1/2 tea. black pepper, again we like it spicy. We used Tabasco for the hot sauce but next time we will probably use franks red hot. I hope you enjoy this recipe as much as we did.

To make more crispy this what I tried~Use a few tbs of melted coconut instead of cooking spray and in the hot sauce. Bake 20 mins each side. Serve with hot sauce or pour over chicken after taking out if oven and serve. Very delicious!

I have looked for a baked wing recipe for some time.  This is it.  I will say that you can do what you want with the sauce (when to apply it).  You can dip before, or just basted 1/2 way, or dry.  We do a combo of all whatever mood we are in.  Keep them in for as long as you feel comfortable - sometimes we go longer b/c we want more well-done wings.

Delicious!  I skipped the flour and butter.  I sprinkled the wings
with cayenne, garlic powder, and salt and put them on a baking sheet
with parchment paper.  I cooked them at 350 degrees for 1 hour.  I took them out and dipped them in Franks Red Hot Pepper Sauce and put
them back in at 400 degrees for about 15 min. until they were crispy.
Definitely a keeper!

Fantastic!  I made these wings last night for the Super Bowl.  I made primarily as the recipe stated except I added a little more seasoning to the flour mixture.  Then...as another reviewer suggested I baked on a rack in a foil lined cookie sheet at 425 for 20 minutes, flipped the wings and baked for another 20 minutes.  Coated with sauce and broiled for 3 minutes, turned and broiled for 3 minutes more.  After broiling I coated in sauce again.  They came out moist inside, crispy outside and had tons of fantastic flavor.  They were devoured by all and made for easy cleanup on a busy day!

these were easy and tasty. I did these without the butter/red hot sauce for a base wing and were perfect. My son, who is my target audience for this recipe, LOVED them dunked in BBQ sauce. Will keep as my base recipe, as well as my true buffalo wing recipe. Thanks! Oh, side note...I did throw them up to the broiler at the end, 3 mins on each side to finish them off - perfection!

I had high hopes after reading so may good reviews but ended up being very disappointed.  I baked the undipped chicken at 425 for 25 minutes on parchment paper.  Then I dipped the chicken in the butter mixture and was going to bake it for another 25 minutes but after 15 minutes I noticed there was so much grease.  So I discarded the parchment paper, wiped up the grease, lined the pan with a new parchment paper, and baked for another 10 minutes.  Family was getting hungry and the chicken wasn't crispy yet so I broiled it for 5 minutes.  It still wasn't as crispy as I would've liked and the taste was BLAH!  VERY BLAH!  Had to dip in hot sauce just to get any taste.  Daughter was the only one that liked.

My daughter has a true gluten allergy so I made this recipe--only I substituted the regular flour with King Arthur's multi-purpose gluten free flour and I followed "Vandygirl29's" advice and put the wings on racks and baked for 25 minutes each side in 425 degree oven (I didn't dip them in the buffalo sauce mixture until they were done baking--then broiled them on low for 5 minutes--about 2 to 2 1/2 minutes each side.  They were crispy and DELICIOUS!!!!!!!  My daughter is so happy and so am I.  Thank you for this recipe and the helpful reviews.

These wings are very good. I followed the recipe the first time and the second tried to let the flour sit longer. They haven't come out really crispy, but we feel they are a fantastic alternative to a fried wing. Thank you!

I love these wings, I add a little extra sice to fire them up ma little. I alsop add a few Chicken Fingers along with the wings.  I don't use foil, I use Parchment Paper, does not stick at all and absorbs so of the grease. Great recipe, better than deep frying.

For crispier wings, place wings on parchment paper (no baking spray)For the sauce, add a cap or two of white vinegar! Love, from a Buffalo girl!

The chicken sticks so badly to the foil (yes I sprayed it) because of sitting on it in the fridge that you loose a lot of the skin to the foil.  In addition the sauce didn't even coat 15 wings, much less 20.  By the time all was said and done, the temp is so high they burn on the outside, stick to the foil and don't really have any flavor.

Followed the recipe exactly, except I put the wings on a rack on the baking sheet and also followed the review that complained that the wings didn't have much taste at the end of the 45 minute cooking so they re-dipped them in hot sauce and continued baking for another 30 minutes.  They were pretty hot to us doing them that way - I should have tasted them before re-dipping.  I dipped half of them in BBQ sauce at the end of the 45 minutes and continued baking them along with the hot sauce ones and they came out delicious.  All of them were nicely crisped and my husband loved them, even the hot ones.

Great recipe, came out awesome! The only things I did differently was season the wings themselves with Lawry's and Garlic powder before dredging in the  flour.   I also used Frank's Buffalo Hot Wing sauce instead of regular hot sauce.  When I baked the wings I did not on an oven safe baking rack and they came out nice and crispy. The fat and excess sauce stayed on the drip tray.   Can't go wrong with this recipe, its has to be healthier than frying.

I used boneless skinless chicken thighs to get the dark meat flavor of wings without the bones. They were crispy, spicy, and all around delicious!

My husband loves these! Excellent flavor & the coating step is key. We use Frank RedHot or Texas Pete. 
After making these several times, I have a couple slight modifications that really work. Do not refrigerate more than 2 hours. I know many recommend refrigerating overnight, I humbly disagree. I tried that. I had washed/patted dry the wings but the coating still absorbed chicken juices after resting 8+ hours. When baked, the coating texture turned puffy; not crispy. 
When making the sauce, reserve 1/4 of it. Bake as instructed. When turning the wings over, brush the remaining sauce on. Finally, non-stick foil made them crisp the best so far. You can do parchment but they will not have the "crisp" factor..but they're still good!

I made these for our New Year Party 2013 and making them again tonight 3 months later.  I've tried fried wings once before and they were all pink inside.  I was so dissappointed.  I tried this recipe and I loved them.  Way healthier than fried, very yummy.

I'm kind of a traditional wings snob, so I tried this mostly out of curiosity, just to see how they'd work out. Like a previous reviewer, I found 400 degrees to be too low; the wings didn't start to brown or crisp until I increased the heat to 450. I also had to re-dip the wings again after cooking, which decreased what little crispiness they had. Fun to try, and I'd probably make them again, but I wouldn't serve them to a fellow wing-lover, if that makes sense. (Note: Used Chef John's Buffalo sauce recipe from this site. THE BEST.)

I added paprika and chipotle powder to the flour mixture. I also didn't feel like drying the wings with paper towels SO INSTEAD I baked the wings WITHOUT seasonings for 20 min. (this dried out the wings for me) then I dipped the wings in the flour mixture and baked another ten minutes. in the mean time I made my hot sauce mixture then brought the wings out re coated some of them with some leftover flour mix then dipped them in hotsauce and cooked them for anther 15-20 min. SO GOOD!!! my best wings yet!

Great Recipe!  Used it for Superbowl Sunday and turned out awesome.  I used Cholula hot sauce, which is my favorite, so I recommend using your favorite hot sauce.  Also used "I can't believe it's not butter" rather than real butter to cut down on the cholesterol and worked out great, couldn't tell the difference.  Highly recommend.

This was a great recipe.  Based on several others, I did make a few changes to the cooking process--but not the ingredients.  I "dried" the wings for about 10 minutes between layered sheets of paper towel.  I put all the wings in the flour mixture, tossed, and left them right in the bag while they sat in the fridge for an hour.  I baked them on metal cooling racks perched on top of a foil lined cookie sheet, and dipped them in the butter/Frank's mixture after baking.  They were absolutely delicious and will be a staple for future parties!

I followed the recipe. It was NOT enough sauce to cover 20 wings. And even though I dried the wings well and left in fridge overnight all looked well they turned out to be a soggy mess!  I will NOT try this one this way again.

I followed the recipe pretty closely. I did have to put my own twist on it. I did bake my wings on top of a cooling rack to keep the juices from making them soggy. It was really good. I will have to make again and try some different flavors next time!

These are really good. Didn't change anything made as stated, but i did put a rack in baking pan for the grease as someone mentioned and it works. Thanks for the recipe.

Just made these and they came out very crispy. The important thing is to place them on a cookie rack in your baking sheet, not on the sheet itself. That way they won't be sitting in their own drippings and it makes them easier to remove without tearing the meat off the wings since there is less surface area for them to stick to. As others suggested I sauced them at the very end. This is probably the closest you're going to get to a crispy fried wing without actually frying it. I could taste the flour a little bit, but the sauce pretty much masks it.

I tried this recipe and don't understand how it can be healthier than just frying your wings in oil. First of all...you are dredging it in flour and then coating it in BUTTER.....YUK.....

This recipe was great.  I went and bought Buffalo Wild Wings sauce for my sauce.  I fixed the wings as the recipe suggested. The only thing I changed was I used butter in half of the wings and the other half I did not.  It did not seem to make any difference in the crispiness.   They were great.  They were very crispy and very juicy and tender. I would certainly use this recipe again.

I think this is a great recipe, but I'm surprised that you don't cut the wings up as is usual (drumette, wing, wingtip). Thanks.

As is, this recipe will get you a pretty classic mild wing. For that I give it 4 stars. 

I personally made a batch of hot, and a batch of mild. The hot ones I added extra cayenne before putting in the fridge for 2 hours. I also put them in small crock pots with a buffalo sauce/butter mixture, and they just fell off the bone. Definitely a keeper.

Awesome recipe and I'll be using it often when I get that craving for some hot wings. I wasn't sure how the flour coating would be but it turns out it works great for keeping the sauce with the wings. This was a fairly easy to use recipe too.

This is the best baked wings recipe! We have made many recipes looking for wings that are crunchy outside and tender inside without frying. This one beats all!

Fantastic!!!  The only reason all the negative reviews are saying they are "soggy" or "mushy mess" is because they aren't shaking off the flour when they take the wings from the ziploc.  Tap the wings and place them on your cookie sheet.  Bake them for recommended 45 minutes but on 425 (can do skillet corn bread at the same time;)) Frank's wing sauce or Emeril's dry spice are both fantastic.   Killer wings in no time and no grease!!!  Crunchy and yummy.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe. I have been using this recipe for a year, and have made these about 10 times now. Everybody loves them and they turn out so great! I've never put them in ziplocs to flour them, I just use a mixing bowl for that and then take them out and arrange them in the greased tin-foiled pans. I then cover them with plastic wrap and refrigerate them the hour or more. My favorite chicken wings recipe, forever.

Excellent flavor! Nice texture. YUM! To make this recipe even healthier (which is why I was looking for a baked wings recipe) I used whole wheat flour and cut up boneless/skinless chicken breasts and boneless/skinless thighs into fourths to make "wing" size pieces. As others have mentioned, the secret to crispy wings is definitely DRY wings and plenty of fridge time. I also made a dipping sauce with 16oz. plain low fat yogurt, mix in 1 mashed avocado and a pack of low sodium ranch spices. While nothing can truly replace the greasy goodness of chicken skin and oil, this is definitely close enough to satisfy a wing craving without blowing your diet!

These wings are always a hit among all of our friends. Any bbq party we go to or throw, we make sure we make this recipe. 
The only difference is that we don't put it in the fridge after we flour it, we put it straight in the oven and add about 1 tsp on cayenne pepper, and then when we have to flip them over during cooking time, we add a bit more over the entire tray of wings. I wouldn't recommend it to most people all the extra cayenne pepper, but we can't get enough of the spiciness.

I consider myself somewhat of a novice in the kitchen, but I love to dabble and try new things that DON'T require deep-frying.  In looking for a fun and simple baked wings recipe, I stumbled across this gem.  As you can see, the ingredients do not require any special trips to the grocery store (all of the ingredients I consider to be cooking essentials).  Additionally, I did not have any problems whatsoever with the moisture of the finished product.  In fact, what I absolutely wanted to avoid were super-dry, crispy wings.  I was very satisfied with the taste and texture of this recipe, and just for fun, I used a few different varieties of sauces as coatings.  (I recommend Frank's Red Hot Sweet Heat BBQ.)  The only tip I would offer to the next person who attempts this recipe is to use a non-stick baking sheet if at all possible... just reduces the cleanup effort.  Thanks for posting, Leesah.

I tried these wings and they did turn out quite good except that 1/2 teaspoon of salt is FAR TOO LITTLE.  We had to sprinkle salt on them to get some flavour.  Also, 1/2 cup of butter seems to be  alot of fat, considering the skins are fat too.  Is there a less calorie way to make buffalo wings?

Overall, they were tasty.

This is a good recipe. I tried it out tonight and everyone loved it. I didn't have the cayenne and garlic powder so I used a little sage and paprika instead. I did half a batch with hot sauce and the other half plain for the kids. I floured the wings in the bag and baked it in a 400 deg oven, I didnt brush the meat with oil as the meat had enough fat to sweat out whilst baking and this gave the flour coating a crispier finish. Brushed on the hot sauce for half the batch once the wings were done and sent them back in the oven for 5-10 mins to finish. My mother in law loved it. Btw I had some chicken leg meat cut into large chunks and cooked with the wings in the same way and my daughter said they tasted like chicken nuggets, but better. All round a good recipe.

Excellent! And rather easy. Just like others have said, make sure the chicken is as dry as possible before dredging and it'll turn out scrumptious. As with any recipe, its easy enough to add things to the flour to adjust the taste to your liking, but as is, great!

I read many of the reviews and adjusted instructions accordingly.  Yes, they were good, but because of the concerns of way too spicy, I cut back on the hot sauce!  A mistake for those loving spicy wings.  I had to put the Tabasco bottle by the wings..and almost everyone use it! It was nice to have wings that were not messy!

I just made these....awesome.  These are better than fried.  I did cook them for 25 min and then flipped them for another 25 at 425 degrees. Then I put the franks wing sauce on for 10 minutes more .  Used my broiler pan with slots to drain grease.  I listened to the reviews of not enough heat in the sauce and added another tsp of cyanne to the flour and it was a bit tooooo spicy.  Next time I will do exactely what is called for.  Even so,  fabulous!!!!! Dip in Bleu cheese.  Try the absolutely best bleu cheese dressing recipe on this site. These are the best wings ever.  Crispy, crunchy and great taste.

These were really good. I made them Gluten Free by using sorghum flour/ cornstarch. Made sure to dry them with paper towels before flouring and let them sit, uncovered, in the fridge for a full hour. Baked them straight on the greased foil and they turned out awesome!

First time I ever made buffalo wings and they turned out amazing. I followed the guidance of others and made sure the wings were dry before coating them. 

My husband liked them so much (and he doesn't typically care for most wings restaurants serve up) that he has requesting them.

Great recipe!  I am usually a deep fried fan but, these are really good.  I did follow the advice of some of the other reviews and dried the wings and did cook them on parchment paper.  They were great!!  Thanks for the recipe!

Fantastic- I used Texas Pete's, adding more cayenne and habanero to the sauce as well as some flour to thicken it up as people in the comments were talking about slow cooking wet wings.  They were probably the best wing I've ever had - thanks much for the recipe!

Really enjoyed.  Moist as well as crisp.  Make sure dry.  Left in frig for 1hr after coating in flour.  Baked for 25 min on a rack and prior to flipping dipped in the sause.  Cooked another 25 min.  Great and crisp but moist inside.
Made boiled then broiled recipee  (4 1/2 stars) I found on Food.com on the same day and these were better though it was close.   really very good.  Better then wings I've had out.

The flavor of these wings was good (I used Crystal hot sauce), but the texture was not what I had hoped for. I dried the chicken prior to coating it with flour, but there was no crispness to the finished wings. I did not use a rack, and that probably would have helped. We gobbled them up anyway, but I don't know if I would make them again.

Think I would try to raise them so the fat would drain off and make extra butter/red hot mixture for dipping. Very good flavor, even had a die hard "I hate hot stuff" say they were good, he had thirds.

Good recipe. Followed previous reviews and kept the floured wings in the ref for 3 hours. Not as crispy as I had hoped but the wings were tasty. I think I'll try corn starch/flour mixture next time.

These were super easy to make! I can't wait to try different hot sauces. They were a big hit when I made them for a football game viewing party. Picking the right dipping sauce is key! Thanks!

We really wanted wings but didn't have any oil, so we decided to try these. They took a lot more than 45 minutes to get really done and crispy, about an hour and a half, but once done, these are great. We really like trashed wings, so when the wings were done and crispy, we dipped them in sauce and baked the sauce on for another 5 minutes or so. We'll never fry again!

DELICIOUS!!!  Not to spicy and not soggy as other reviewers stated.  Cooked on 400 for 45 min turning after 25 min.  Might try using a rack on the baking sheet next time to help keep extra grease off wings while baking.

Very tasty!  They were not crispy though...kinda mushy actually.  Next time, I'm going to break them, bake them in some butter and then mix them in the sauce last.  I will let you know how that goes!

I was nervous about making it, because most ppl fry in a deep fat fryer, However I got sooo many compliments on it, at my sons 1st Birthday party, there was NONE left. Also for the kids table i didnt add really any franks red hot sauce, only the butter to coat, so it wasnt spicy for them. It was a hit!

These tasted just like in the restaurant! Yum! Only, I did as suggested, cooking them on a wire rack, and them chickens smoked like crazy. The meat was fine; just the grease at the catch pan was smoking the whole time. Oh well. It was worth it! Making them again tomorrow, I think.

Meh.  The wings didn't crisp up.  After reading other people's reviews it seems clear I should have tossed the wings in the powder the night before to dry them out enough.  The three hours mine sat in the fridge was NOT enough and baked them on a cookie cooling rack so all the oil dripped off (rather than the wings sitting in oil). I can't fathom these wings coming out crispy without double (or triple) the oven time and/or resting overnight.

I took advice from dome of the reviews and baked the chicken on wire racks. I also added garlic to the butter-buffalo sauce mixture and put that on during the last 10 mins in a Pyrex pan. My family LOVED it and we will no longer be frying our foods...thanx for such a great recipe!

These were the best wings we have ever had.  Everyone enjoyed them tremendously.  I did trim the wings of the excess skin and fat before cooking to try and cut down on the fat.  That process took a very long time, but the wings were great.  The only thing I changed was I used 1/4 tsp. chipotle pepper and 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper since I had both on hand.

Great wing recipe! I followed the recipe closely, I just added a tablespoon or so of honey to add depth to the hot sauce. (Also cause my husband can't take his wings too hot.) Made sure the wings were patted dry, etc,. It was a great hit between him and two guests.  He's already requested it for tomorrow's dinner already! Thanks for the great recipe! Saving it permanently. :)

These wings are perfect! Just the right amount of kick to them. I make them just about every Saturday night now, and the whole family loves them. I mix a little extra sauce after for dipping or serve with ranch. 
Great recipe! Thanks for sharing!

The wings had good flavor, but they were a soggy mess. Next time I'm going to wait until after I bake them, before I dip them in the sauce/butter mixture.

I followed the recipe exactly and these did not turn out.  My husband said they had good flavor but they were so soggy as soon as you picked one up, the batter fell off.  Very disappointed as I made these for our football party.

Theses were the worst soggy wings I've ever had!!  I even cooked then an extra 30 minutes and they were still a big soggy mess.  We ended up eating frosted flakes ;0(  Next time- I'll be firing up the deep fryer.

great recipe, easy to do. Everything has already available in my pantry. I used rice flour instead of wheat flour because my husband has gluten sensitivity. But they are still crunchy, garlicky, and spicy. YUM!

Contrary to what many have said, this recipe made more than enough of both the coating and sauce to coat all the wings. Great recipe!

Best baked buffalo wings ever.. baked the wings first without mixing with butter and hot sauce to make it crispy as per other reviews, then dipped it with the hot sauce mix and return it inside the oven for 15 mins more, and viola!!! I have tried other recipes but I'd say this would be my buffalo wings recipe from now on :)

My kids loved these... I pat dried the wings, dredged in the flour mix and chilled for several hours.  I baked them over an hour, turning a few times and they were as crispy as if deep fried without the greasiness!  Next time I will finish them off by stirring them up in a bowl with a butter, garlic, hot sauce mixture the same as I would if I had deep fried them.

turned out good but not great although it may be because we had just moved to a new house with a really bad oven. I was used to my Profile convection ovens and the new house has an old electric oven.
Now moved again to a house with a brand new gas oven and cant wait to try, the new oven bakes so well!

I changed it a little by soaking the wings in Frank's Hot Sauce over night. Made the chicken it self taste better. I DID NOT like the flour additive!! Next time I make buffalo hot wings....no flour!! It got in the way of tasting the chicken,  & I didn't really enjoy the flavor.  I'm going back to the original recipe.
It's all good!!

Fantastic recipe!  This will be the only wing recipe we use.  The crust was crunchy and the chicken tender and juicy.

Instead of all purpose flour, I used Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free Pizza Crust Mix then added Kosher sea salt, garlic powder and cayenne pepper.  We left the wings dry of sauce prior to baking so each person could sauce how they preferred.

Really good! I followed just as written, except for one thing: I didn't have as many wingettes as I thought(only 10), so I also used two boneless skinless chicken breast cut into strips. Other than that, I used the recipe with Franks Hot Sauce. I turned them at 20 minutes & they were done 22 minutes later. Very Tender, yet a little crispy. This is a keeper to be made again.

These were so much better than I expected.  I had no issues with sogginess.  I baked them on parchment paper and followed the recipe exactly as it appears.  On batch #2 now since batch #1 was such a hit!

Yum yum yum.  Played around a bit with butter and hot sauce--used about 1/2 the second time I made this after seeing how much was wasted.  Turned out great.  Thanks for sharing!

I have to admit thamy results was similar to other reviews. My wings were very soggy and I believe that if you cook the wings firstprior to adding the melted butter mixture, it may come out better.As a result I had to cook them longer and drain the chicken twice.

I had to seriously change this recipe as it ended up being flavorless. Instead I made the butter/hot sauce mixture and added garlic salt instead of garlic powder and salt. I also brushed additional butter/hot sauce mix half way through baking.

I can not speak highly enough about these wings!  I had never made wings before so i was a skeptical, but they turned out absolutely perfect.  Because they were for a big birthday party I lowered the hot sauce to 1/3 cup to be sure that everyone could enjoy them.  I also made sure to throuroughly dry them before placing them in the flour mixture.  I can't wait to make these again, although I will probably go with the whole 1/2 cup hot sauce next time.

These were VERY good.  My husband and son loved them.  I followed other's advice and made sure the chicken was very dry before putting it in the flour mixture.  Make sure you line the pan with foil.  I just used PAM and boy I had a mess to clean off the pan.

These were a big hit on Halloween night!  They were time consuming though, becuase they were not nearly crispy enough after the stated baking time.  I cooked them significantly longer to ensure they were crispy.  I also elevated them on a rack over a baking sheet as some other posters mentioned - so they were laying in the drippings.  The end result was delicious - but definitely required more bake time.

I made this yesterday with about 10 small chicken legs and it was very good. It was my first attempt at any 'Buffalo' style chicken and the recipe was a great blueprint even though I didn't follow it exactly - I kinda eyeballed everything!  I would definitely use this recipe again.  I'd like to try it with boneless chicken tenders next time and see how it is.  Thanks Leesah for sharing!

Needed this recipe!  Awesome, crispy baked wings!  My husband was so excited (as was I)!  I did a few things different: didn't rinse wings so I didn't have to dry them, put garlic powder, seasoned salt, and onion powder in flour, no foil in pan, cooked @ 400, and turned the wings every 10-15 min to prevent burning and even the crisping.  This all worked GREAT!  Will definately be making wings like this again!

These are so simple to make, the recipe consists of things I always have in my pantry anyways. All of my boyfriend's friends come over for football on Saturdays, and they always request these!

I love these wings.  I like to add a little more cayenne pepper and a little less butter to make the wings a little spicier.

These turned out awful. I followed the directions exactly.  The coating all slid off the wings in the oven.  Sooooo disappointed, as I was making these to take to a trivia night and had splurged on individually quick-frozen drummies (big ones at that).    I think I'm going back to frying my wings and then coating them in sauce.

Delicious, crispy and flavorful.  the only thing I changed was dip the wings in sauce AFTER baking them.  I bought Buffalo Wild Wings sauces.  I also baked them on 425 - 20 min first side, 15 min second side. Only issue I had was oil splattering all over so my oven got really smoky.

I love that these are baked, not fried! My husband and I both love spicy crispy chicken; these turned out wonderfully crispy, but not as spicy as we'd hoped. I did kick it up a notch with the hot stuff, but apparently not enough. I didn't want to go overboard the first time not knowing how it would turn out, but next time I will definitely add more zing!

These are awesome!! I followed the advice of others and baked them on a rack and dipped them in the sauce after. They were crispy and it had just the right amount of heat for me. I like it spicy but I don't like it to burn my mouth. I will definitely be making these again.

I LOVE these wings!!!!  The only change that I make is I don't dip my wings into the sauce until after they are cooked.  It's MUCH better that way.  The wings remain crispy and so delicious.

Wow!  I was worried about them getting soggy from sitting in the fat, so half way through cooking them (when you're supposed to flip them over) I carefully relined the baking sheet with fresh foil/cooking spray, flipped them and put them back in the oven and they were GREAT!

These are amazing!  I made them one Sunday early in football season and they were such a hit my family insisted on having them during the game every week from then on!  The key to succes is drying the wings well with paper towels before flouring them and making sure they sit for at least an hour (I usually do 2 or 3) before dipping them.  We like them hot so I add more cayenne.  Will never buy pre-made hot wings again!!

These were incredibly easy to make and tasty.  The first time I made them I followed the recipe but there wasn't enough sauce.  The second time I tripled the amount of butter and hot sauce to coat the wings, used more to brush the wings half way through baking and the leftover for dipping.  Just perfect.

I've never baked chicken wings before...but these turned out great!  I'm not a huge fan of buffalo wings.  Instead of the hot pepper sauce, I used "CHAKA's MMM" sauce (found in the BBQ sauce section).  After they were done baking, I brushed the wings with "CHAKA's MMM" sauce.  They turned out excellent.  You can use any sauce to your liking for this recipe if you don't like buffalo wings.

Very good - couldn't even tell they were baked.  I listened to other reviewers and made sure they were dried out good so they weren't soggy.  The only change I think is needed is additional sauce basted in last 5-10 minutes because all of the sauce cooked off and they weren't that spicy.

SO good!  We baked the wings before dipping them in the hot sauce mixture and this helped them to get crispier than the last time we tried this recipe.  Also, we like ours a bit more spicy so I put 1 1/2 tsp Cayenne Pepper and used 1/4 c. butter with 1/2 c. hot sauce. Delicious!

Great wings.  I have made other baked wings before but they didn't have the right texture like these do.  The flour coating serves two purposes - it seals in the juices and also gives the wings a little crispy outside.  I cut down the cayenne to 2 teaspoons.  For the sauce at the end, I used smart balance instead of butter.  These were great.  They are "dry wings" AKA not messy to eat but the meat itself is juicy.  My husband packed the leftovers up to eat for lunch the next day.  BTW, the supermarket sells 4 lb bags of wings which required a double batch of everything.  Can't wait to make them again!

I have made this several times and it is always a hit. The first few times I made it just as it is described and they were wonderful. However, I decided to take the advice of a few other reviewers this last time I made it and it made a huge difference. Definitely pat the chicken dry before dredging it in flour to help the sogginess as well as baking it on a cooling rack (or something similar) with a drip tray underneath. Also, I baked the chicken for 30 minutes without the sauce and then dipped it in the sauce for the last 15 minutes and they came out crispy and perfect. This is definitely the way to go. I also like to prepare the chicken the night before and let it sit in the fridge overnight. Anything you can do make the skin crispier the better they will turn out. If you do all these things your wings come out very crispy to the point that you almost can't tell that they weren't deep fried. This is a great recipe, I make it almost every week during football season.

Sticking to the foil is often a problem, even with the cooking spray.   I use the Reynolds Wrap non-stick foil.  It cost a bit more, but worth it for the non-stick factor with a recipe like this one.

These were great. Five stars. If you like them really hot I would up the ratio of hot sauce to butter. I made half the way suggested and half with very little hot sauce or the kids. I mixed wings and tenderloins. Huge hit all around. This will become a favorite in our house.

These are great. I'm not sure they are any more healthy than deep fried as the sauce is made of butter and hot sauce. But they have been gobbled up everytime I've made them. One time I did it from memory and used mayonaise instead of butter for the sauce and it was at least as delicious. Next time I make these I'll create some new sauces. I'm thinking Thai Peanut and Honey BBQ.

LOVED these!  My husband asks for them for every party we go to now.  They are a hit everytime.  I use boneless chicken strips sometimes too, I don't like wings as well... more work for little meat I think.

Great wings, though I do prefer Buffalo wings a bit saucier.  Next time I will dip again quickly before serving.  Good alternate to frying, though, and if you let them set up in the fridge and remove the fat from the pan, they don't get soggy.

Be careful with making sure the pan you bake them on is non-stick. We always end up losing the coating on the drumsticks because we didnt spray enough.  This recipe is a nice healthy alternative but I still miss the deep fried version.

Awesome!  I only let the floured wings rest in the fridge for 15 minutes because I was starving.  Turned out great!  Definitely going to be a staple in my home.

I have always made deep fried chicken wings. I never believed that baked wings could be sooo good! This is the second time I have made this recipe. I wanted to have buffalo wings without all of the fat from deep frying! I did not have cayenne pepper but this did not make a difference in the taste. I also used franks red hot sauce. MMMM! This is definately two thumb up! My husband egrees with me too!! A much healthier and less messy recipe! Thank you for posting this recipe! Delicious!

My boyfriend really liked these, he said they were just like the ones at a bar we like. Just like other reviewers I cut down on the cayenne pepper. I also made some home made ranch so it felt like a real restaurant experience

These were pretty good.  I was expecting them to be more saucy than what they were.  They had good flavor, though.  Next time I think I will double the sauce and reserve some aside to brush the wings with while baking.

I made these for my boyfriend's family and they disapeared before I could even try them! I used the recipe as written, did not change it at all, except I did not have enough time to let it rest in the fridge. I had also made bbq wings for my boyfriend's dad, who does not like spicy things, but he gobbled up the buffalo ones! So I guess the cayenne was not overpowering for him. Everyone really enjoyed them! Thanks for the great recipe!

I followed the directions exactly and they came out perfect and crispy.  It was my first time making wings and I was skeptical about the flour coating, but they were delicious.  I will definitely make them again.  I recently moved to Hungary where it's almost impossible to find decent "bar food" but now I can finally satisfy my cravings!  Thanks!

When company was coming I looked for an alternative to frying batch after batch of wings. These were pretty good but I still prefer the fried ones. How I made mine: I baked them on a non-stick rack for an hour without any sauce. I then dipped them and returned to the over for 5 minutes. I didnt have any garlic powder so I simmered some fresh in the butter before adding the hot sauce. These werent spicy enough for us and I had already changed the hot pepper sauce ratio to 3/4 cup pepper sauce to 1/4 cup butter. Next time I will increase the cayenne to 1 1/2 tsp. I had no problem with sogginess, I made sure my wings were really dry and left them in the fridge for way longer than an hour. Make sure to turn them when half done to crisp both sides.

Very tasty...used 2 tsps cayenne and Diannes chicken and rib bbq sauce.  Definately switch pans upon turning to increase crispiness.  Only need 25 min on one side and 10 once flipped!

I made this for our family and since two of my kids don't like spicy things, I made a batch according to the recipe and a batch where I subsituted bbq sauce for the hot sauce.  Both were fabulous. I followed other reviewers and made sure to pat dry before flouring. Everyone gobbled them up and they were looking for more.  Will definitely make again.

I'm lazy so instead of making my own sauce I used a good wing sauce I had in my fridge.  I just used raw chicken legs (patted them with a paper towel to remove excess moisture)dipped them in plain flour, baked (375 for 45), and then dipped them in a hotwing sauce I had in my fridge.  I even put them pack in the oven for five minutes afterward.  Awesome crisp juicy and full of flavor plus about three times the size of regular buffalor wing!

I substituted Fish Fry for flour, but did everything else the same.  I also split the chicken and made 1/2 without buffalo sauce.  I then made home-made blue cheese dressing & my fiance fried some potatoes.  I however, ate my wings on a green salad.  It was excellent!

Yummy! I didn't have time to refrigerate at all, only used 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper, flipped half way through baking, and brushed with sauce again after baking. Came out crispy and crunchy!

These were really good. I did not think they were soggy at all. I did not drench them in butter before baking them. I drizzled the butter on when they were almost done. I only refrigerated them for half an hour and I doubled the garlic powder. I also only used 3 tsp of cayenne. But I think they turned out great!

awesome!  MY husband and I loved these!  So awesome and relatively easy..just time consuming.  You have to plan ahead for these..so worth it!  I used Franks Red Hot Buffalo sauce.  I did not have any cayenne so I used a little garlic powder and chili powder.  And heavy on the black pepper.

Our 3 grand kids, ages 6, 9 &12, love Buffalo wings and their ability to withstand and enjoy spicy foods is astonishing. They can take the heat more than I. With this recipe, I used only 1 teaspoon cayenne and then followed the recipe as written. Still spicy enough for the adults and never slowed the kids down at all. Good ratio, very tasty and one we'll do often! Thank you for sharing a great recipe.

I loved it.  Not the first time to bake my wings, but the first time to leave out the first step of frying them first and baking them off after coating them in hot sauce to dry them out a bit.  My original recipe was from my friends Grandma who grew up in Buffalo, and this is a great fix to make it easier, less steps and mess, and fewer calleries.  I left out the butter!

I made this for the Superbowl, and it was aweful; I threw it out right away. I spent over $15 on ingredients; at least I learned why the premade frozen wings are as expensive as they are. There is also alot of wasted sauce from dipping the wings, which is a real shame, as the Franks sauce alone sells for $4. :( Buy frozen premade wings and add your own hot sauce (like PC hot sauce, $1.49 a bottle).

These were excellent -- very tender and flavorful. I cut of the tips of the wings. I placed them on a rack in a foil-lined pan and put in the fridge for 3 hours before baking. I baked them for 45 minutes before brushing both sides with the butter/hot sauce mixture. That really made them crispy and delicious. I will definitely be making these again.

I came across this recipe and have been wanting to try it all week.  Finally had the opportunity.  I hate the smell of Deep Fat Frying in the house or even in the garage.  I made this with just the butter not the pepper sauce. You can always add the heat but you never can take it away.  I wanted to try it without the sauce since I have some friends who don't like the heat.  Thanks to the other reviews at the 25 minute mark I transfered to another tray to try to keep them from getting soggy and this seemed to work.  I really think next time I will use a cooling or broiler rack.  Not sure if I will add this to my Super Bowl arsenal or not this weekend.  If you love wings give it a shot, you wont be sorry.

These turned out delicious! They do turn out crispier if you leave them in the fridge longer. Tweak the cayenne and hot sauce for your likeness. We did and whew!

This was a very good recipe for buffalo wings. I did make some modifications to the recipe however. I used the small party wing instead of the regular size wings. I only put the wings in the fridge for about 30 minutes. I also increased the amount of garlic powder to 1 tablespoon. I baked the wings on 425 for 1 hours. After 50 minutes in the oven I dipped the wings in the sauce then put back in the oven to bake the additional 10 mintues. They turned out so good and crispy just like we like them. Me and my boyfriend ate all 20 wings, they were just that good.

This recipe was good.  The only thing I would do next time is NOT use parchment because the wings stuck.  I would do what the recipe called for which was foil.  The wings did come out crisp.  I would also put the sauce on half way through the process.  I will make these again for sure.  Thanks for sharing.

So good!  I followed the bit of advice and cooked them halfway before dipping them in the sauce.  I also broiled them for a minute at the end.   A tip that works for baking or frying wings...let them cool and dry out for about 5 minutes before adding the sauce at the end.  It crisps them up even more.  Warm up the sauce and don't add it until right before you eat them.

I read the reviews before I tried this recipe so I didn't make the mistake of adding 5 teaspoons of cayenne.  I followed the recipe almost to the letter with a couple of exceptions.  I used a family sized package of 25 drumettes and coated them in the flour mixture the day before.  They were in the fridge, uncovered, for about 18 hours.  I baked them in two batches.  The first batch I coated in the oil/hot sauce mixture before baking (20 minutes on one side, 25 on the other).  The second batch I baked for 20 minutes, removed from the oven, basted with the sauce, turned them over, basted that side and baked for another 25 minutes.  Both batches were really crispy and delicious.  My husband, who doesn't much care for hot wings, loved them.

This is a great recipe!  My husband who does not like hot wings and my son who only likes pizza and chicken nuggets wolfed them down on New Year's Eve.  It's not too spicy either.  It's a great party item and the left overs are great for lunch the next day!

These were good but I think I didnt cook them long enough because they were a little pasty.  I think the flour mixture needed more seasoning (salt) and will experiment next time. I also cooked them on a rack and I think that prevented them from getting crisy.  I also used Frank's 'Wing' sauce as opposed to the regular hot sauce.  Not sure if it that makes a difference but the sauce was a bit thicker than I am used to. I am determined to tweak this until I get it right.

These are great!  A regular recipe in our house now.  I try to remove as much skin as I can from the wings prior to dredging in flour.  I find if I don't do this there is too much grease from the skin and the cookie sheet I bake them on needs to be drained so they crisp up.  I may try baking them on a rack on a cookie sheet so they crisp more easily next time.

These were amazing!  My boyfriend and I love Buffalo Wings....especially during football season.  But what we don't like is all the fat and calories that comes from deep frying them.  These were perfect!  I even removed most of the skin on the wing prior to cooking to cut down on even more fat. I've tried other recipes before but none come close to  these.  They are the closest you can get to take out wings!  Thank you for sharing this...They will most definately be being made weekly in our house!!!

These were really tasty and nice that they had a healthier twist to them. Also, really easy to make. I just couldn't put a whole stick of butter into the "sauce" mix, so I did 1/2 stick and a little extra hot sauce to make up fluid content, butI had more then enough sauce to coat about a dozen larger sized drumsticks. They were coming out crunchy until I flipped them and then it was a bit of a battle with wetness. I ended up broiling them for a few minutes at the end. Next time I will either flip them and put them on a new tray, or use a roasting pan and I expect they will be perfect.

I was really hoping these would turn out crunchy since I like the crunchy kind best so I did as some of the reviewers suggested and baked the wings before I coated them in the sauce.  I did not leave them in the fridge first since I figured that was a moot point so maybe that was a mistake.  The wings were not crunchy but I'm also thinking I might could have tried cooking them longer?  I will probably play around with this recipe some more.  If you like spicy you will probably want to use less butter/more hot sauce.  I had doubled the recipe (we were feeding lots of people) but the sauce I only did 3/4 cup of butter and 1 cup of Frank's hot sauce and there was MORE than enough sauce.  I saved the extra sauce and put it in the fridge for topping burgers and such.

The wings didn't come out as crunchy as i thought they would. I did add more Franks wings sauce which gave them a little more spicy flavor. I love my wings hot!! Thank you for posting though. This was a great recipe!

I didn't have to change a thing.  It was delicious!  I only had to add more of the butter/hot sauce mixture, but my wings were a little bigger than normal. =)

So easy to make with very common ingredients.  This recipe will be a regular that I will make again and again!  Thanks!!

I followed this recipe except for three minor things: I did not soak the wings in sauce at any point, I put the wings on a wire rack  and I only broiled for a minute or two. They came out great. This is my new go-to recipe.

I baked the wings on a rack placed on the cookie sheet, what you cool cookies on, without the sauce to get the wings suuuuper crispy by not letting them sit in their own juices. When they are done I dip each wing in the sauce afterwards and serve. They come out perfect and are delicious ??

I made these with Skinless chicken breast strips or nuggets for years and they are so good. 
My husband cannot have very spicy foods, so if he plans on eating any I reduce the Frank’s RedHot sauce to less than a quarter cup.

Fabulous result. After reading several reviews,  I  opted for baking at 425 degrees. I  did the 25 minutes   per side on a well greased foil lined tray. I  then dipped in sauce  and returned to oven for 5 minutes. 
I  also brushed with extra sauce ( that I warmed) after cooking. 
They were delicious. Crisp on outside and the chicken was moist and tender.  Great flavor.  This recipe  is a keeper.

Very good! Following the recipe and the comments, I made sure they were DRY before dredging in the flour. Let them sit in the fridge for an hour, then dipped and set on a wire rack in a pan covered with parchment paper to bake. Worked GREAT!

As other reviews have said the key is to drying wings with paper towels prior to flour mix, put wings in gallon ziplock, pour flour mix in, seal bag and shake. Remove wings and place them on baking rack on cookie sheet so grease and water can drip down and wings don’t soak in them. 20 minuets

I wound up not saucing the wings prebaking as we were divvying up the wings for different flavours. I'm glad I baked them naked as I was able to see which rack was crisping better - I wound up broiling one of them at the end for a few mins to brown them and they were AMAZING.  I didn't have the soggy issue (didn't need to blot the baking sheet when turning them, nor did I "dry" the wings before coating them in flour.)

My wife and I loved this recipe. We used sriracha sauce because it's all we had. In the future, we'll use Frank's. Thanks Leesha

Came out delicious and crispy.  Per suggestions in reviews, I cooked the wings on a rack that allowed the wings to crisp and fat to drain into the prepped pan below.  Used my own hot sauce as well.  This recipe will be a great standard to try out and show off new sauces I make.

I modified the ingredients to 1/2 cup flour, and double the cayenne, garlic powder and salt all to 1 tsp. Wings are so crispy!  Better than restaurant wings.

it is good less salt and like someone else said dunk a second time in hot sauce after the 45 and cook a bit longer like 30 or so. after that if they are a bit mushy still let them cool like 5 mins in the freezer. after that they are not burning your finger and and skin has gotten a bit tougher. I cut the recipe in half cus i have half the wings. I thought the flavor was good with 2 dunks and alot of tuning but next time i will use less salt

I tried this recipe and honestly did not like it.  I've baked Chicken wings before without the flour and they were great.  Mine were crispy and you would have thought I fried them.   This recipe doesn't have enough sauce on them to make you lick your fingers.  It didn't have that HOT kick, and I only used 16 wings.  The flour absorbs the Hot Sauce, so you don't see the red coloring..

Excellent recipe! Very easy too. Wings were a little dry after baking so I booked the remaining sauce in the microwave. for more heat I think I will do the traditional. Frank's recipe which has more sauce than butter rather than equal parts.

There was more than enough of the flour mixture in the bag so I made a few extra. It made about 30 wings total, which is half of the "party pack" from Costco. I placed them in 2 foil-line baking sheets and baked them in the oven before adding any of the sauce (they won't get soggy).  Flip after 25 minutes. Take out after 20 more. To make the sauce I just mixed a stick of butter and the whole bottle of Frank's Red Hot (Xtra Hot) in a glass baking dish. Place wings in glass dish & turn to coat both sides. Put dish in oven 5 minutes. My husband says they're really good.

The technique for getting your wings dry and tasting like they are pub wings. The only issue I had was getting them hot enough. I always increase all spice, but still we felt the were mild

I changed this up bit. I used a baking sheet and coated it with olive oil. I coated the wings and laid them out after coating them and put them in the fridge for an hour. I preheated the over to 400. I cooked them for 30 minutes, I drained the grease, baked them another 25 minutes, flipped them over, baked them another 15 minutes and THEN rolled them in the butter and tapito sauce and then baked them another 10 minutes.  I pulled a few suggestions from other bakers together to make it come out just so great.

Made it for my family the first time without the flour and they loved it. The second time I made it with the flour and they didn't notice the difference because it still tasted great. I live by this recipe for my Buffalo Wings from here on out.

Delicious and a huge hit! However, I recommend not using foil to line the baking sheet. The wings we're sticking terribly, even when using PAM cooking spray. Bake directly on the pan or use a baking rack for the crispiest wings. The second batch I baked directly on baking sheet were outstanding.

So these turned crispy and with a going amount of heat. I used a bit more cayenne in the flour mixture.   Also used a cooling rack to bake them on which I think made them really crispy. Also did not dunk in sauce until they were cooked, after dunking put them under broiler until they browned a bit. Cooked at 425 23 minutes each side. Would definitely make them again. Great for game night!

This came out really well.. 
It is a simple and easy recipe which you can make anytime .
Just reducing one star  because of the spice level. 
We like much spicy things so from the next time just need to add some paprika more,otherwise it is just yum??

Wonderful!  Been trying several different recipes and this is the winner.  I didn't add butter!  Had before and they didn't taste as buffalo-y as I wanted.  I might have gone overboard on the Frank's sauce, they're spicy!  Love 'em.

Loved this! Much healthier and easier than the fried ones I've been making for years!
I added about a tablespoon of vinegar to the sauce. This enhances the flavor and aroma of the hot sauce. 
I foil lined the pan, but I cooked them on a rack in the pan, no need for turning and not as soggy

I made this and used the advice to refrigerate the wings before adding the flour.    It made the wings a lot more crispy.  I added honey siracha seasoning to the flour mix.  I cooked them at a lower temperature for 30 minutes.  I flipped them and then cooked at the higher temperature for another 30 minutes.  I was so surprised at how golden brown these came out. These are so delicious.

made this twice already, I left out the cayenne pepper, and used oil instead of butter. I bake them and then grill them for a couple of minutes at the end. These are really excellent.

A true home run in this house!  The spicier, the better!  Although this recipe calls out for an hour of resting time  after dredging  in for mixture. I go overnight and  the wings have maximum flavor , texture and juiciness!

Sunday before the Super Bowl I was digging around in the freezer for something to eat while watching the game. I found a few things that needed to be tossed and a few things that the wife and I could snack on. And I ran across a package of chicken wings. I put then in water to defrost and came here to Recipes.com to see what I had saved in the way of chicken wing recipes. This is the one I chose because I had all the ingredients.

After the wings defrosted I found I only had four whole wings which separate into only 8 drumletts and blades so I halved the recipe. Also, I'm off gluten so I used a gluten-free flour (Better Batter) which works really well in most cases but tends to brown more quickly than wheat flour. This tendency to brown is actually an advantage in this case. I followed the recipe as given with the amounts halved (Note 3/4 cup = 12 Tablespoons which means I used 6 Tablespoons of flour).

Chicken wings are fatty and baking them produces lots of grease. Next time I make them I will put them on a rack. Turning them in all that grease was not something I wanted to do so I blotted the grease with paper towels during the turn-them-over process.

The flavor was very nice - a bit mild for my taste and I'll up the heat next time, the texture was excellent - crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, the 45 minute cooking time was just right. Even my wife, who is not generally a wings person gave them two thumbs up. This has become my go-to wings recipe.

Maybe I didn't do something right, but the skin didn't "crisp up" like I expected.  The flavor was just ok, but I'd I received this order in a restaurant, I wouldn't order it again.  Again, this was my first attempt, so don't let this kill your buzz.

Followed the recipe to a T and they came out very soggy, bland and unappetizing.  I made them for the super bowl and couldn’t even finish one wing.  My guests politely nibbled on one to two per person, complimenting that they were moist.  Yes, soggy.  I actually was sure I messed it up by submerging the wings in the sauce before baking but reread the recipe and that is what was suggested.  After reading the reviews I should have made a different recipe.  Why give something 5 stars if you had to make major changes for it to work out?   I see a recipe, that it has 1k reviews that net at 4.5 stars and I assume it is a pretty good recipe, not that I should have to change almost all of the steps for them to turn out ok.

I followed other reviewers pointers - dried wings thoroughly, baked almost the full time without sauce, added sauce just for the last 5-10 minutes with oven on broil - and they were delicious! Easy to prepare too.

Increased to 1 tsp of cayenne and 1 tsp of garlic.   Fabulous taste.  I've been looking for a delicious, easy to make baked hot wing and this is finally one that I will stick with.

Excellent!! This was my first attempt at homemade wings and they were definitely a success. I agree with other reviews in that they should be baked on a rack then tossed in the sauce just before serving. Also, expect a good deal of smoke from the oven if you keep the heat at 425.

I have been making this recipe ever since I discovered it over a year ago.  The only thing I do a bit different is to put the flour/seasoning mixture on the wings in the morning and let the wings rest all day until it is time to bake them.  Then follow the rest of the directions as given.

I make this every year for super bowl, so much easier and healthier than deep frying and tastes delicious.  I have not been able to achieve the same level of crispness as deep frying, but I get close enough, with lots of compliments from my guests.  I find a full cup of Franks Original with 1/2 cup butter is needed for 12 wings.  1/2 cup as per the recipe does not do it.

Coated the wings and left them fridge for 24 hours.  Cooked as directed and then broiled five minutes each side.  Lovely

Have made these twice now and they’re so tasty but also so easy. You can easily change the herbs and spices you add to the flour to make these your own. A tip though, use Franks Hot Sauce. There’s really no substitute.

We like more spicy foods so I used 2 t cayenne pepper to 1 C flour.  I also increased the garlic powder to 1 1/2 t, deleted the salt, and added 1t onion powder.  I also used vegan butter for those who keep kosher.

I didn't have a rack so mine were a little soggy but not bad since i baked an extra 5 minutes. 25 min on each side. I also spooned extra Frank's sauce at serving time for some extra punch and flavor. Warmed us up on this chilly Northwoods Wisconsin night.

It was good but not enough seasonings for my taste. I followed suggestion of some reviewers and marinated the tofu overnight in the sauce. I also added lemon pepper to the flour mixture and Creole seasoning since I did not have cayenne pepper. I also waited until last half hour to baste wings with melted butter, dash of Srirracha & honey.

Ive made this a few times and it is really good. My family thoughly enjoys it. I like the fact that there is less clean up as  there would be from deep frying and a little heathier. depending on the size of the wings,i leave them in the oven for about 5-7 minutes longer for a little extra crisp.

This is such a crowd-pleaser! Everyone loves these chicken wings! This is the kind of recipe that you are so happy to have found. This recipe definitely added joy to the life of some people around me (including myself)! Thank you so much for sharing the recipe!!

Since I make this so often nowadays, I have perfected the easier quicker way of making this. I make a big batch of the flour in advance. We like garlic and the heat, so I used to triple the amount of galic powder and cayenne, but I am now back to doubling them to fit to everyone's taste. If you use microwave to melt the butter, the sauce will be too runny and will not stick to the chicken very well. I usually microwave the butter and mix it with hot sauce in advance, so it is the right consistency when I dredge chicken in it. In fact, recently, I have developped new method of placing several chicken pieces on a plate and pour 1 -2 table spoonful of sauce on top of it. Then, spread the sauce to coat the chicken pieces evenly gently rubbing them against each other before placing them back on the foild pan. Chilling the chicken definitely helps the coating to be more firm, yield crispier Buffalo wings. You can flour large amount of chicken wings at once, put them in smaller bags 10-20 pieces of party wings in each bag, thaw them in the fridge a day before coating them in hot sauce and baking. This way, the wings are already perfectly chilled. What a great recipe. (Ugh... one more confession... I actually even have the h

Didn’t change a thing! Followed exactly. They stuck a little to bottom of pan but I think it’s because I used spray instead of just brushing a good amount of oil across pan. Approved by (3) 12 year olds.

One of the best Baked Buffalo Wings I've ever had.  I normally cook them on the grill but it was too hot to be outside for long.  I cut the wings into drummies and wingies and did the flouring early morning and by the time they went into the oven, they were beautifully coated with the flour and hot sauce mixture.  Cooked the amount of time stated.  They were getting a nice brown on them and they fell off the bone.  A bit greasy and that's why I rated it 4 stars.  If I have to cook wings in the oven again, I will use this recipe and put a dash or two of red pepper powder in the flour.

Thank you to Vandygirl29! If not for you, I may have passed by this outstanding recipe. I loved your instructions and they certainly made a difference in the finishing product. One thing I did differently was to add a little brown sugar (to our taste as we like things a little sweet-n-spicy).

They turned out delicious!  I like spicy so added a bit more cayenne pepper to flour.  I did refrigerate them for one hour then dipped them in sauce and baked them until they looked done!  Since I like spicy I dipped them as I ate them in Franks Red Hot Wings Buffalo sauce!  I also turned them over half way through cooking.  Next time I will buy skinless wings without tips!  I hated pulling the skin off  but it was worth it. Yum

Family really enjoyed the flavour and crispness of these wings.  Made them for a St. Patrick's Day gathering and called them "Leprechaun Legs".  Because they are baked in the oven it is a nice snack to cook while visiting.

I made these today, and they were better than the ones I get at the store. I used Kentucky Kernel seasoned flour to coat the wings, and let them sit in the refrigerator for an hour before dipping in the hot sauce. I followed the directions, and turned them halfway through cooking. I did cook them about 5-10 minutes longer than the directions said in order for them to crisp up. I will definitely make some more of these.

If your problem is soggy ness my suggestion would be to cost them in baking powder, bake in oven preheated to 250*f for 30 minutes and then coat them with the butter and bbq sauce mixture and crank the heat up to 425 for 40-50 minutes.

These were the best oven Buffalo wings I've made (and I am really picky about wings.  I'm from Buffalo and have had the originals at the Anchor Bar.)  I think it may have been the flour and just the right amount of sauce that helped- no complaints from the men about them being "too hot".  Came out crisp and that's not usually easy in the oven.

Excellent Wings without the fat of frying!  I've made baked wings before, but all I did was throw the wings in a dish and cover with Franks Buffalo Wing sauce.  These are MUCH better.  Be sure to completely dry out your wings.  And don't use those that are big bags of frozen wings with "extra liquid added."  Get fresh wings/drummettes and squeeze them completely dry with paper towels.  Be sure to place them uncovered on the prepared baking sheet (just as the recipe says).  When finished, if you still want them crispier, just put them under the broiler for 5-10 minutes.  These are DELICIOUS!  THANK YOU for the recipe---it's a keeper.

I baked mine as stated, but did not add the hot sauce until after they were completely baked.  More like a "dipping sauce."  Perfect!!!  Highly recommend!

I've made this recipe several times. The only change I make is I toss them all in hot sauce a second time after they come out of the oven, and I generously apply cooking spray (butter) to the aluminum foil so they don't stick. Great wing recipe, and I've made it with several sauces.

I made this without making any changes to the recipe. It is an easy recipe but the next time I'll make a few changes to avoid the trouble I got into. 1) double the dipping sauce (I used Presidents Choice Buffalo wings sauce), lightly whipping the sauce and melted butter together thickens it. 2) add about a half tsp of paprika to the sauce (I like a more vibrant "red" to the dish if using the PC sauce again. 3) definitely use a grill insert over a roasting pan, Do not use a cookie sheet!  grease from the wings dripped over the sides and smoke poured out of the oven setting off the smoke alarms. 4) don't pack the wings tightly together to get it all in one pan, give a little space for the wings to cook evenly. The flavour of the wings was just right -- not too spicy. I will make this recipe again but will definitely avoid the mistakes I made with the type of pan I used to bake the wings in. I think the grill insert will make the wings nice and crispy.

Made these tonight because my son searched the Internet for a buffalo baked wing recipe.  Found it here on my favorite site... We followed the recipe except used Louisiana Hot Sauce.  Took the recommendation to make sure the wings were well dried before the flour mix.  Not soggy at all.  Wonderful flavor.  Will add more cayenne pepper next time because we like a bit more heat.   It truly a great recipe.  Baked not fried.

I’ve been making these for a while. And I have to say, my boyfriend and I LOVE these! I honestly find these better then Buffalo Wild Wings. I didn’t have time to rest the wings for an hour in the fridge but the dipping in the butter/wing sauce and a coating of Pam on the foil seemed to help and they didn’t stick.

Made without the Cayenne but used Sweet Baby Ray's Buffalo sauce.  They were delicious.  Best with smaller wings though.  Made it with the flash frozen wings in the 5 lb bag the second time and not as good as with the smaller wings.

Loved it.. followed almost exactly just doubled the cayenne pepper and made a bigger butter and Franks red hot mixture because when i flipped them over at the half way mark i bathed them in extra sauce.  So easy even i could make them!

The butter made the wings melt-in-your-mouth juicy.  I like that you can use whatever hot sauce you like.

THese wings deserve  more stars than I am allowed. Seasoned perfectly, so easy to do, and crispy too! For those who had a problem with soggy chicken wings, I have the solution. Your wings should be partially frozen when you cut them up. Then when you add the flour mix, there is no wetness at all. I also place  one of my cookie-cooling racks on the baking sheet. This gives an even, crispy crust and you don’t have to turn them over half-way through baking.  Be sure to spray the rack before use.

We loved them, my husband said they were the best I have ever made.  The only thing wrong with them is we ATE too MANY!
I will follow the recipe closer next time.  I left the wings in the zipper bag and should have spread them out on the baking sheet like the directions said.

Still experimenting with it. I like my wings to be covered wet in sauce and have had to dip them after cooking. Not yet where I want them to be.

Have been looking for a really good, and easy, wing recipe to make at home because I've noticed restaurant wings are getting quite expensive. This recipe does NOT disappoint! 

I followed the recipe ingredients to a T, but followed another reviewer's advice when cooking them. I made sure the wings were dry before I dredged them in flour. Then I sprayed a cookie sheet with olive oil spray, placed the wings on it and put them in the fridge for an hour. Baked them for 25 minutes and when I took them out to turn them, a few were stuck to the sheet, so I placed the wings in a bowl and poured a little EVOO on the cookie sheet and spread it around. Put the wings back on and baked the other sides for 15 min. Removed them from the oven and dredged them in the Buffalo sauce and cooked them another 10 minutes. They came out crispy on the outside, but still nice and moist on the inside. I really believe using the EVOO on the cookie sheet, instead of using the spray, is what makes them crispy. 

My husband and son said there wasn't nearly enough sauce on the wings when they tried them(they like ALOT of sauce), so I put them back in the bowl and tossed them with Frank's Red Hot buffalo sauce. When they were finished, they both went on and on about how good they were and asked to make this a permanent recipe in our house.

My husband wanted buffalo wings to eat while watching football.  I liked that this recipe was baked, not fried. Followed recipe as written except that I added some black pepper to the hot sauce mixture for a little more kick.  It came out really good, my husband liked him.  Will make again.

The taste is great.  The soggy factor is not good.  2 stars as is, but it has promise.  If it was baked at a higher temp (e.g. 425), which I did after a bit, or broiled probably better, they'd be crispier and taste great.

Skip the butter. It's fatty enough with the skin on the chicken. Up the cayenne to a tbs.

Next time I will leave it overnight with cayenne pepper and garlic on. For 4 pieces (1lb - 0.5 kg) I used 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper, garlic and salt each and it wasn't too incisive. As a sauce I mixed tabassco with sunflower oil. I baked it for 40 minutes (20 minutes each side). With good garlic sauce and slices of bread you will get fast, cheap and simply dish.

This recipe is how I make my wings. Instead of lining foil on a pan, use parchment paper. No need to use cooking spray and the wings will never stick and come out a beautiful golden crispy brown I to lightly flour the wings before baking.

I found real stick butter works best. I used non stick cookie sheets, once with foil, once without. Worked best without foil. I also tried with GF flour, worked just as well as regular flour.
My husband could live on "bar food" this recipe is a nice alternative to deep fried wings.

After reading many reviews stating that the wings were soggy, I decided to bake them without the sauce. I baked them at 375 degrees for one hour. I put them in the broiler for two minutes per side to crisp them up and then I then tossed them in the hot sauce mixture. They were very good.

This was really good! I made some minor modifications to suit my needs, 1 tsp cayenne, and 1/4 cup butter. I used both chicken and rabbit wings, both we so good! Cook time 35 minutes, I did not notice it being unreasonably soggy. Will make again!

These were very good but I made some changes based on other reviews. I thoroughly dried the chicken with paper towels before dredging in flour then I put them on trays, uncovered, in the fridge for 1 hour. I did not put sauce on them until almost the end of cooking. I baked them on a jelly roll pan cover with foil at 425 for 25 minutes then I drained the pan, turned the wings and baked 25 more minutes. The wings were super crispy. I then dipped the wings in the sauce & put under the broiler for about 3 minutes. These were not soggy at all. I will definitely make again. One of the things I have learned over the years is that a low sided pan (like a jellyroll pan) allows for better crisping than a regular baking pan when making wings or ribs. It is also important to pour off any fat from the pan at the half way cooking point.

I tried this method which was s little different from what I usually do.  Dunking the wings into the melted butter mixture before baking was something I hadn't tried.  This tasted too floury to me. It tasted spicy with not a lot of flavor.  My husband liked them, thus I gave it three stars.

Being the first time I make wings, this recipe was a good way to start: very simple and not much preparation.  What takes the most time is refrigerating them and baking them (not much work at all). 
I read another rating of this recipe and there was a problem with soggyness, but I did not encounter that. What I did to ensure I did not have this problem was bake them for 20 min at 400F, then turn them and bake them at 425F, and once they were fully cooked, I turned on the broiler for 525F. They came out crispy and well cooked. 
I will be using this recipe again.
4 stars only because though they were good, they were not amaaazing.

These were excellent. Thank goodness for the extensive reviews, I always read many of them before attempting recipes on here. I took what I thought were some of the best tips to avoid sogginess and swimming in grease. I took care to trim and then seriously dried each wing before dredging. The pan was in the fridge for about 5 hours. I put the wings on racks that fit the pan to keep them from sitting in their own grease and covered the bottom with foil for easy cleanup. I cooked at 400 F for 25 min without the sauce, flipped them and cooked for 15 min more, and finally took them out and rolled each in the buffalo sauce, drizzling more on top, and then cooked for a final 10 minutes. They were crispy, spicy, juicy, simply wonderful. I made extra buffalo sauce for dipping and it was a perfect complement to the homemade ranch dressing I also used for dipping. Will definitely will make again. Oh one final thing- I like spice, I used two tsp of cayenne and a full teaspoon of the other seasonings in the flour blend.

There is nothing compares to deep fried wings ....however for less calories and mess these are good ....the frank's hot sauce and butter needs a Tb of white vinegar ....every wing recipe seems to leave that out .....it makes a difference believe me ....

Perfect!!!  I used same ingredients.  I added just a little bit of hot sauce to the wings, then added the coating and let them sit in the refrigerator for about an hour.   I set the oven to 390 as mine runs a bit low.  After 45 minutes I checked them and they were close, total in oven was an hour and they came out not quite crispy, but almost which is the way we love them.

Great wings! Dredged wings, refrigerated for an hour.  Baked for 25 mins. Turned. Baked another 25 mins .  Tossed in sauce. Broiled 3 mins. Turned. Broiled 3 mins.
Voilà! 5 star Buffalo Wings.  Note:  I used a baking cooling rack to cook them on. It kept the wings out of the juices and grease. Nice and Crunchy.

Very nice.   I was worried they may be too hot for my wife so I prepared half the hot sauce and made a honey garlic sauce.   She preferred the hot s'aide better so we are golden.

Easy! Yummy! Perfection!  Someone advised baking the wings @ 425 for 25 minutes; turning them and baking an additional 25 minutes; then dipping the wings and broiling them for 10 minutes.  DH liked them--even though he claims to only like boneless wings!  Can't wait to make them again!

These were a huge hit.  A little time consuming, with prepping but so worth it.  You definitely have to make sure the chicken is as dry as possible before flouring.   Flour sticks better.   I refrigerated mine for over an hour, but only because I was in the middle of a project, not sure if this time matters.  Then, what I did, on aluminum foil, 20 minutes, flipped for another 20.  I removed chicken from pan, there was quite a bit of juices. I threw that out.  Had the chicken sit in the hot dressing for about ten minutes, back into oven on clean dry foil, for another 10 minutes.  PERFECT!  Weren't too spicy, but the crunch was fantastic!   As far as the seasoned flour, I followed directions, the taste was fine for us.

I followed the recipe closely, only change I made was baking them without the sauce for  45 minutes in a 400 degree convection oven. I then rolled in the sauce and stuck them back in for 15 more minutes. They came out plenty crispy.  I would have liked more spice for sure. Next time I will add more cayenne pepper.

My husband likes a sweet BBQ hot wing, so for the last 20 minutes of the bake, I drizzled honey on each wing and sprinkled them with brown sugar.  Perfection!  He loved them!

Made these using the technique suggested by Vandygirl 29... no sauce until the wings are out of the oven. I made Chef Johns Buffalo Wing Sauce recipe for the sauce.  The entire dish turned out great - not quite as crisp as deep fired wings but really close.

Better than expected. Were not soggy at all! However, I did as some reviewers suggested and put sauce on during last 10 minutes of cooking, The only thing I would change is the butter ratio. At times I could taste the butter more than I prefer, so I may try lessening the butter to hot sauce ratio. Otherwise, very good for baked buffalo wings.

My guests enjoyed this recipe. I used legs instead of wings. They have more meat and cost less. I will use more cayenne the next time I prepare this for more heat.

I substituted four crushed garlic cloves for the garlic salt and gently browned them in the butter. I removed them before adding the chicken wings. Yummy.

I dont know if I did something wrong but my wing sauce melted off and left a mess in the pan and nothing on the wings. Will try adding the sauce on after next time!

Pretty good.

I don't know about this 'resting in the fridge' business. Why? It's not a marinade.

The butter and sauce amount was enough for 10 medium/large wings (not 20) and basting. I cooked on a wire tray and brushed the wings with leftover sauce towards the end. 

They came out crispy. (I dried the wings with paper towels before the flouring stage)

They weren't hot at all, so get ready to add pure hot sauce if you want heat!

It is a nice lower fat substitute for the real thing.  Putting flour on helps to crisp it up, but there is nothing like a REAL BUFFAL WING , like  you get in the bars in Buffalo, NY.  They are fried crisp, and then shaken in the butter/hot sauce combo.  The key to this recipe is to thoroughly dry the wing before you start!

These were a showstopper!  But they were very labor-intensive.   I followed the advice of 2 reviewers regarding hand drying by paper towel to assure crispness, and refrigeration for at least an hour(longer is better) after dredging.  I was grateful for the information regarding the hot sauce-melted butter ratio, as a heat regulator.  Thanks.

I've noticed many people saying their wings were soggy. There are a couple reasons this can happen. The first is make sure when you buy your chicken wings they haven't been soaked in a brine. To know if they have, check the ingredients list. If salt is on it,  it's been brined. The chicken sweats the brine liquid while cooking which leaves you with soggy wings. The other is not making sure the wings are very dry before coating with the flour and not re-flouring just before adding to the baking sheet. The second round of lightly flouring is imperative to get a crispy baked wing. 
I made half a batch according to the recipe, the other half using what I know.  The recipe batch were soggy. My double floured batch were crispy. That aside this recipe is fantastic. The flavor is perfection.

These were GREAT! I used Bob's all purpose gluten free flour to make them GF! I also followed Chef John's Buffalo Chicken Wing Sauce recipe for the sauce. This was my first time making buffalo chicken wings and they made my NYE party great!!! Everyone loved them!!

I broiled mine for the last 3 minutes of cooking which helped with the soggy/runny part. Other than that, these were amazing. Texas Pete buffalo sauce all the way!!

These are delicious. I followed one of the reviewers instructions as well.  I made sure to soak up all the water from each chicken using paper towels. I only put it in the frig for one hour in flour mixture. I didn't add the sauce mixture until the end. I baked 25mins turned and baked another 25 mins at 425 degrees, then I added the sauce put them back into the oven at a low broil for 5 mins each side. Yum, came out chrispy. Would diffenately make again.

These were great-so great that I was told that this recipe should go into regular rotation. I followed the recipe as written except that I baked the wings on a metal cooling rack atop the baking sheet. I dried the wings with paper towels before dredging in the flour as other reviewers recommended. I will definitely be making these again, particularly during football season. Thanks!

No grease, no mess and taste just as good as deep fried wings.  Everyone I serve them to loves them and asks for the recipe.  I do a couple things different though.   After refrigerating, I place the dredged wings on a wrack place on top of the pan so the hot oven air circulates all around the wings.   I DO NOT put the wing sauce on them until after they cook about an hour, turning half way through the time.   I take them out of the oven and place them in a lidded bowl with the sauce and shake to coat well.  I then put them back in the oven for another 15 minutes.  This insures crispy wings.

I made these for my brother when he came home from college, but I was  bit disappointed because after cooking the wings the buffalo sauce almost completely cooked off the wings. I recommend that you re soak them again after baking them.

This was my FIRST time attempting to make buffalo wings and they turned out great! I always have good success with the recipes I get on this site. The family loved them.
   I made sure they were dry by patting with a paper towel. I did not have time to follow the step where you put them in the refrigerator for an hour after dredging them in flour.. but they turned out crispy. I read the reviews before cooking and the general opinion seemed to be to cook them WITHOUT the sauce first. I cooked them 30 min on each side. The family loved it that they were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. My teenager said she liked them much better than Zaxbys. I will make them again, but only on a Sunday. They take a bit too much time to make on a weeknight (for me).

I am not really sure why this recipe has such a good rating!?!?  I made it for my husband, exactly as the recipe stated &  it was really bad. Gooey, not crispy at all & very bland, needs more seasonings for sure... I could not eat them, my husband ate some, but told me not to make them again... I wasted a lot of time, as well as the food to make them...

I made these for a Halloween party I had and to be honest, we had 30+ people here, and I think I'm the only one who ate them.  We reheated them and fed them to my family the next day and everybody loved them! So good, even reheated! I'm making them again, tonight!

I make these 3 times a month, and they are a favorite in my house.  My youngest son, who is 39 years old, says they are the best he has ever had!  The only license I take with the recipe is to add a little garlic salt to the dry ingredients.  I also bake for a couple of minutes longer than the recipe recommends, but this could be because of my oven.  We like them to be crispy, so they definitely need to be under broiler for a few minutes, I watch them the entire time to ensure crispy, not burnt!

My family loved these wings! We followed the directions except that we baked the wings at 450 degrees for 30 minutes, turning over after 20 minutes. One big difference is that we added the sauce AFTER baking. That way, we were all able to add as much sauce as we liked. My husband drenched his wings and I lightly sprinkled my wings with sauce. We used Frank's Wing Sauce(no added butter). My son used a less spicy BBQ sauce on his wings. We will definitely use this recipe again.

Easy and very tasty recipe but I did make a few minor alterations... From reading the other reviews I was sure to dry them well with paper towels before coating with the flour mixture, instead of placing the wings directly in the pan I put them on a wire rack so the juices would drain into the pan and my chicken wouldn't be soggy, and lastly, after dipping the wings into the butter/hot sauce mixture,  I baked the wings for 25 minutes turned them over and baked an additional 35 mins.  They were crisp and flavorful.

Made this dish twice and love it! I probably baked the wings for 50 or 55 minutes to make sure they were super crispy, but not burnt. I also waited to dip them in sauce until the very end, right before serving them.

I found it to be lackluster. There was no "kick" to it at all, and the flavors were barely there. I followed the directions to the letter. My family was disappointed.

I also followed the advice to completely dry wings prior to flouring, baked the wings without sauce, then dipped in sauce and cooked 10 more minutes.  My wings were crispy, crunchy, saucy enough, and a big hit with my husband.  I sprinkled extra sauce on half of the cooked wings, and left the other half as cooked. The extra sauce was too hot for us. I will definitely be making this recipe again.

I tried this for my family this evening, and they are very picky about greasy/fatty tasting foods.  I followed the directions EXACTLY, and the wings turned out amazing.  I made half the batch In just butter and the other half in butter & Frank's Red.  Everyone ate and loved them.  There were no leftovers.  I will definitely make these again.  They were not soggy at all as some others described, and I only kept them in the fridge for 1.5hrs.  The next time I will try over charcoal instead of the oven and review my findings.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Dry wings good first.  Add honey to sauce.  Don't dip first.  Bake at 425, on wire cooling rack, for 25 mins; flip and bake 25 mins.  Dip in sauce.  Broil on each side 2-3 mins ~ Perfect!!

These sucked. Dry burnt  wings couldnt even taste the sauce. My suggestion cook for 35 instead of 45 minutes and put the sauce on when they come out not before they go in

OMG these are insane! I cooked them on a cookie sheet and used my toaster oven grate to raise them so they wouldn't sit in the grease. As others have done I baked them until they started to get crispy and brown, then I put them in a bowl and coated them in the sauce. There was still plenty of sauce left in the bowl so after browning them another ten minutes I put them back in the bowl and coated them one final time and served them. A few minutes later I was looking at nothing but bones....A plus!

I apologize in advance because I don't actually use this sauce recipe, I use Chef John's Buffalo Chicken Wing Sauce. I know! I'm sorry! I DO however prepare my wings this way because they come out so beautifully crispy and delicious. I've used flour before, but now use almond meal instead of flour (health reasons) and it gives it this wonderful texture. Don't bake your hotwings any other way because this is perfect!

I made these with gluten free all purpose flour and Cooke them an additional 5 minutes, they came out crispy and very tender inside, served them with a wedge and made ranch dressing for dipping, I would definitely make them again.

Very good basic recipe.  Made it for a Superbowl party and they came out restaurant quality.  I'd rather deal with baking vs. using a deep fryer.

I dredged the chicken wings in the flour mixture before reading the reviews, so I forgot to dry the wings before dredging. I let them sit an hour, and then put them into a 450 oven without dipping them into the hot sauce mixture (I increased the temperature because I was afraid they would be soggy). I cooked them 15 on each side, then took them out to dip in the hot sauce mixture. I lowered the temp to 425, then put them back in for another 20 minutes. They came out very crispy and delicious. 
I used one baking sheet line with foil and one glass Pyrex baking dish. The wings came out the same, so I guess you can use either one (but the baking sheet was a lot easier to clean--just  throw away the foil).

Followed the recipe to the letter, and although skeptical about baking the wings rather than frying (an occasional indulgence for us), these turned out well.  The only thing that I would do differently is make more of the butter-hot sauce to drizzle on after the wings come out of the oven.  The wings really soaked up the hot sauce while baking and although they crisped up nicely, they were just a bit dry, and I'll check for doneness sooner next time.  But I think a little more of that hot sauce would have helped.  Enjoyed and will make again, for sure!

I have made these baked wings many times and it is easy to adjust  the recipe to adjust  the "flavour of the day". I've tried different adjustments with honey, sriracha sauce, sesame seeds, more cayenne, lime, etc. Baking makes them easy, and slightly healthier. Well done !!

I agree with previous posts, make sure your wings are dry before dredging in the flour. Of course you won't get the same crisp as fried wings but still the flavor is good and hits the spot! I've made it a few times and played around with different spices to add to the flour mix and different sauces. Each time they come out tasty. Glad I found this recipe!

I added smoked chipotle powder, onion powder, red pepper flakes, and pepper (all to taste). I also baked for 40 mins, then fried in vegetable oil for a crispy finish!

I made this today for 7 kids ages 1-12.  I followed the recipe exactly until the sauce.  I used about 4 oz. of hot sauce with a stick of butter, and it gave us a good buffalo sauce with a little kick.  The older kids loved it, and the preschool set just ate the wings plain, or dipped them in bbq sauce.  I thought the plain wings were very bland, but loved the crispiness.  With the buffalo sauce, they were perfect.

I haven't made this yet but, what I want to ask is:  Why do wing recipes call for so much butter?  Doesn't that defeat the idea of chicken being healthy?  I think I would prefer to use canola or olive oil.  Thoughts?

They turned out great! It had the crispiness of a fried wing, minus the grease!  I baked them on a baker's rack on top of a cookie sheet to prevent the wings from being soggy.
One issue i had was that it was not as "saucy" as i like my wings. It seemed moreso like a dry rubbed spicy wing.

GREAT -- simple and excellent!   I made the recipe exactly as it was provided; used drumettes only (which have more meat than wings), and made sure to pat them very dry before dipping them.  That's it!  ...very big hit with the resident males.

Made these wings just as told drying them off real good and let them sit in the refrigerator for a hour and a half. They were wonderful and very crispy. I will keep making them this way.  The sauce I used is the Buffalo wing sauce from Buffalo N.Y. It's thick to start with and stays on the chicken really well. Thanks

I baked them a bit longer because I used legs as well (10 minutes longer). Other wise, I followed the recipe exactly. My only issue was that they didn't come out crispy, but overall they were really yummy and not dry at all.

I used skinless thighs and called them elephant thighs instead of Buffalo wings. I dried them, dredged in flour mix, baked 20 minutes per side at 425, then dipped in hot sauce and broiled 5 minutes per side.  Crispy and tasty but not spicy enough for me so I served with Tobasco. Next time Tobasco goes into the hot sauce or drizzled before the broil. They got eaten up very quickly!

We have made these many times but without the flour. We bake plain wings for 15 mins. then dunk them in the sauce then back in the oven for another 15 mins. we repeat the process 3 or 4 times until wings are cooked through. The extra dips give extra zing.

Made these for Superbowl yesterday, but took advice on paper towel squeezing/pressing raw wings before flour dredging.  What a difference! These turned out to be the best wings I've made yet! I've always deep fried them before and I loved the ease of baking. Also placed the floured wings on cooling racks  over aluminum covered baking sheets to bake, turning once during bake time. 25 minutes each side.  I made 2 sauces, dipping half in one and half in the other, and put them under a moderate broiler for 5 minutes to crisp (after baking)  Serve extra sauce on the side--mmm mmm! These were worth the effort---clean up was nothing more than tossing 2 sheets of aluminum foil (and all those lil' bones)  in the trash! Thanks for great suggestions people ~sure made my day!--- PS. I watched chef John's video on  deboning that part of the wing with the double bones--just before you eat it--EASY!! And you didn't miss a single morsel of the meat!! 
Boy have I learned a lot of cool things about Wings!!!

First time making wings, and I'm so glad I read the reviews and followed these tips.  I made sure the wings were very dry (squeezed in paper towels and even had sit in fridge with no cover for an hour on more paper towels, to be sure).  I used gluten free flour which was undetectable to anyone, along with cayenne, garlic powder and salt -  and also added some onion powder.  Went a little heavy on the cayenne, but it was good.  After coating chicken wings/legs, I placed evenly in two foil throw away pans that I had sprayed with coconut oil.  Sat in the fridge for about 4 hours (because I was out running errands).  Then I kept in those pans, cooked for 25 minutes at 425 degrees with no sauce, on each side.  Then added the sauce (I melted 1/2 pound butter and put a bottle of premade wing sauce) into the pan and whisked.  When I tasted it I thought it was a bit too spicy so I looked in my fridge to see what to add to cool it a little....and I had leftover tomato soup, so I put it in - did the trick, and tasted great!  Covered the chicken, then broiled 5 minutes each side.   Was sure to coat the chicken very well with the sauce.  Tasted fantastic!  Was a big hit at a super bowl party.  Will definitely make this again!

This was the first time I made chicken wings and they turned out pretty good. I took the advice of some other reviews and made sure the wings were dry before coating them. They still didn't turn out real crispy so I baked them and extra 10 minutes at 450 degrees and this helped.

First time making  these and will not order them from any other company again!  Just a tip for crisp wings.  Bake them before you dip them in the  hot sauce/butter combo!  Franks (original) hot sauce was perfect for  a medium spicy bite.  You can adjust the ingredients for added heat!  Enjoy!

Easy recipe, easy cleanup! we like it a little spicy so at the halfway mark, when I flipped the wings, I added hot sauce directly to them and baked the wings the remainder 20 minutes. Made 2 batches with ease for Super Bowl. Family loved it.

I thought these were pretty good and the fridge trick was priceless.  I think I could have cut back on the franks so next time I try it I may use half as much.

I have been making these wings for ages.  The hubby asks for them several times a month. Other than adding more cayenne I have not changed a thing.  They always come out crispy so not sure why others claim theirs were soggy; although, at the halfway mark when it's time to flip the wings, if they seem to be swimming in an excessive amount of grease, I will blot up (pour off) the excess before returning the wings to the baking pan for the last 25 minutes.  I make extra sauce for dipping at the table.

Absolutely the best.  I have been making wings this way for 3 or 4 years and they always turn out well,  also I have been asked for this recipe many times.  Made as written here you can't go wrong.  Thank you for sharing.

These sound really good. Question:  should the wings be frozen or thawed before coating?

Did the recipe exactly as called for. Baked mine on Al foil. Most of the skin ended up sticking to it. Very disappointing. I think parchment paper is the way to go. Overall flavor was good. Missing the good sauce flavor at the end. Maybe they should be dipped in the sauce half way through the cooking process vs. the start.

Very, very easy to make....I am just starting out in the kitchen..this probably took about 2 hours total to make if you count in the time the chicken had to be in the fridge. I don't eat meat either so I can't be a fair judge of how they tasted, but my boyfriend approved highly!

Love these wings! I have a few tips though. 1) DO NOT BAKE ON A STONE. I wanted to make sure they were crisp but the stone baking made so much smoke it set off my alarms and made a mess in the oven. And upset my dog for about an hour! Lol 2) I added 1/2 cup bread crumbs to the flour mixture. Nice and crispy. 3) These are not super hot so you might want to add more spice. Also I don't keep garlic powder around and they were fine without.

I love it. I guess I read the recipe wrong the first time, because I put the wings in the oven just with the flour dredge and they came out great. They come out nice and crispy, then I put them in the sauce, either hot sauce and butter, or teriyaki, or whatever you want.

The wings turned out great! Like some other reviewers, I waited to sauce the wings (at about ten minutes left to cook). They were nice and crispy! I was afraid that these might be too hot (spicy) for me, but they weren't that way at all. Will definitely make again!

Can't count the number of times I made this recipe. Best ever so far. I always end up using less than 20 wings, so I lessen the amount of butter and hot sauce. Franks hot sauce so far the best. I bake for an hour  30 min each side, that way the wings are crunchy and juicy too.

We are not a hot sauce family. So I used Chef Paul Prudhommen Magic meat blend of spices and instead of butter I used coconut oil. It was absolutely amazing and so much better for you.

I've made these twice and they are so good!  Finally, a crispy baked version!  Must make sure the butter stays melted and doesn't harden up as you dip the cold wings into the sauce before baking.

Made them today!  Put the wings in the fridge overnight then took them out and let them come to room temperature.  Placed them directly on the stoneware baking sheet and baked 20 minutes with wings down, 25 wings up and then put them under the broiler for about 5 minutes.  Big hit at the football party!

These were great, closest to frying without the oil that I've tried. I've been baking my wings using the spiced flour sift for a few years now anyway but I've always added the sauce after baking. I tossed them in the butter/hot sauce for the last 10 minutes of baking and it did crisp them up more then just the baking alone ever had. Son still tossed in more sauce afterwards as he likes them crisp but dripping with sauce.

If you're using frozen chicken, make sure that its thawed or it might come out soggy too. I liked the crispiness and flavor! COVER them in flour, I thoroughly patted them in flour and then had flour in the bag with them. I put them on a wire rack (with something underneath to catch drips). I took the rest of the sauce, boiled it (because it touched raw chicken) and served it with the wings. It was a hit! Will make again.

Hope my review gets submitted this time.
I made it last night and wow that was just yummy.
As advised by  the reviewers, I  paid attention to dry meat to perfection ??. Other than that I DID NOT CHANGE ANYTHING AT ALL.
I have a hard time  with bones but trust me meat was so tender. I will definitely make it again.

Leesah, thanks for sharing girl. This recipe rocks!

Excellent baked wing recipe and exactly what I was looking for! Tasty,not greasy and no frying involved! I followed reviewer Ionimuse's suggestions and was very happy that I did. Concerned with wings sitting in grease, I used parchment paper and never had to drain at all during the cooking, and there was hardly any grease in the end. Thanks for a keeper recipe, Leesah, that I'm sure to make again.

These were delicious. I couldn't find fresh chicken wings only frozen and they were laced with preservatives. Why they put chemicals in frozen meat is beyond me. So I bought skinless, boneless chicken thighs and cut them in strips. Otherwise I followed the recipe. Don't forget to spray the lined baking sheet or they will stick. I made these for my grandson's 13th birthday party and we all loved them. I think chicken thighs are meatier and less mess than wings and a lot cheaper! I put a party pick in each one and called them "Buffalo Tails":). Thanks Leesah.

I wish I had read more reviews before making these. mine turned out very soft and the all the sauce dried up. It tasted okay, but no one wanted seconds nor do I want to make them again. I had high hopes but was disappointed.

Works well.  Leftover butter and Franks, so I am trying it on by pouring the excess over the wings, and lets see where we go.  No deep fryer, so the oven baking is perfect!

These wings are fabulous. I've refrigerated my wings at least four hours each time and had no problems. You may have to adjust the bake time if your wings are smaller -- and if they are, you probably won't have to turn them over. If you want to make other flavors (such as BBQ), I just apply it in the last 10 minutes of cook time so it doesn't burn -- and yes, I apply it right over the existing sauce for a spicy BBQ.

These wings were awesome.  I don't know why so many others are complaining about the wings being soggy.  I set them in the fridge for about an hour and then baked them for 30 minutes on one side and then 30 minutes on the other side at 425 degrees.  I melted the butter with the hot sauce (use whatever kind you like) on the stove eye just before taking them out of the oven.  Once out, I put them in a big bowl and poured the hot sauce mixture over them and tossed them in it.  We like our wings wet.  They turned out to be wonderful.  Will definitely be making this recipe in the future.  It will be my go to buffalo wing recipe.

Not great.  Used boneless tenders instead of bone in wings, maybe that was the problem.  They certainly didn't get crispy more pasty from the flour.  Had more to cook so I cooked in oil then tossed in butter and hot sauce.  Much better.

Fantastic! Minor tweaks- baked till mostly done before saucing. We got wings from a local pizza place while these were baking and these out-rated them! Thanks, Leesah!

These wings were a hit at my Superbowl Party. I used Sweet Baby Ray's Wing Sauce and Glaze in the Sriracha variety. I also added a tablespooon of molasses.

I loved this recipe and so did the family. Unfortunately, they were soggy but I took them out of one cookie sheet and placed on another for the last few minuted to crisp them up. I had to buy frozen as the store was out of fresh with the superbowl and all. when I make them again, it will be with fresh wings

I guess I had extra juicy wings, I had to drain the juices off twice in order to get them to crisp.  All together they turned out fantastic!

Best baked wings I have ever made! I cooked them for 25 minutes on a rack and then flipped and cooked for another 25.  Just as someone else suggested, I finished them off under the broiler for 5 minutes.  Delicious!

Makes pretty standard breaded, baked wings.  I've done something very similiar to this using masa harina in place of flour as well, although I would recommend going half and half if you decide to try it, because the flavor of the masa can be a bit strong.

As written, I could see how the wings could get soggy.  Put oven to 450.  DON'T put sauce on until the very end.   Use a cooling rack over aluminum foil.  25 minutes, then turn for another 25.   At the end I just poured sauce over the chicken instead of removing, dipping, and returning.  Put everything back in the oven under broiler for 4-5 minutes and you'll get rave reviews!!!

I followed the recipe exactly (except the only hot sauce I had was Tapatio), adding the step of patting the wings dry before flouring them. Also, instead of dipping them in the hot sauce/butter mixture, I dripped on some sauce and rubbed the wing to coat it. I think this had the dual effect of a) making sure there was enough sauce to coat all the wings and b) allowing the wings to get delightfully crisp in the oven. Both my husband and I really liked this recipe and we will definitely make it again!

My first time making wings. Awesome easy recipe. Great texture....I'm guessing because of the flour and butter. Would give it 5 stars but I used the Frank's red hot and the wings weren't hot at all so I added extra sauce. Definitely recommend.

I used paprika and tandoori chicken powder as well. I switched out the flour and butter for cornflour and olive oil. They we're   juicy and very crispy.  Great recipe!

I threw the wings in a bag with the spices, melted the butter, added it to the spice bag, threw the bag in the fridge to have the butter to re-harden. I did not bread the wings. Baked the wings and sauces them after baking and had no issues of sogginess. I made some of my own sauces. Solid base recipe for baked wings.

Made these as written, except for forgetting to flip the wings, and they were very tasty.  Baked up with a good crispy crunch (though not as much as fried) on a cast iron griddle pan (with the raised ridges) so they weren't sitting in their own grease/sauce and the wings had good flavor.  Since we're the frugal sort and don't want to waste a bag, we do coatings like this in a plastic container with a lid.  Shake, shake, and we can wash it clean.

It was horrible and soggy. The sauce was the only good thing. I did dry the wings a little   before mixing with flour and it was still soggy.

Even though the meat fell off the bone, the taste wasn't there.  There wasn't enough sauce for all of the wings so I made more.  They stuck to the foil even using cooking spray so there wasn't a crispy outside.

Great way to get wings without frying! First few times I made them I did find them more soggy than crispy, although the flavor is good. This time, at the recommendation of other reviewers, I baked the uncoated wings 25 minutes per side, and used a rack so they weren't soaking in drippings. I then dipped them and ran them under the broiler 3-4 minutes per side. Not as crispy as fried but VERY good. Plenty of dipping sauce to use.

My friend wanted me to make my usual chicken wings for her wedding (we live in Alabama, chicken wings are welcome any time).  I decided to try a different recipe and this one looked great.  They turned out very mushy but very tasty and everyone liked them.  I just didn't care for the mushy part, I was looking for a crunchy crispy recipe.  This one didn't deliver :(

I would never flour my wings before baking, although baking IS preferred over frying. I simply lightly season my wings with whatever tickles my fancy, throw them on a baking sheet(s) covered with "Release" foil and bake for at least an hour at 425, turning once halfway thru and draining off any grease/liquid. Then I put them in a bowl lined with paper towels to absorb any leftover grease and toss with Frank's hot sauce. EASY PEASY!

Made this recipe as is. Well, I probably used more than a 1/2 cup of hot sauce.
 It was great! Forgot to place wings in the fridge but it did not make a difference in the taste! Definite keeper!

Made these awesome wings for a NYE party. They tasted awesome, but I wish they would have been more on the crispy side. Next time I'll try one of the tips, like baking them first, then dunking, then finjsh the baking. They were VERY tasty!

Followed the recipe except we cut out the cayenne, no one wanted them that hot...I also added chili powder to the flour mixture. We fridged it for an hour like it said (my wings were frozen) I then placed them in a large lasagna glass baking pan...we brushed on the butter hot sauce mixture (we also added a table spoon of brown sugar to that) after brushing it on I then poured the rest over the wings...I baked mine for an hour & 20 mins being they were frozen at 375f and they turned out PERFECT!! Crispy & almost falling off the bone! So delish! I also made another bag with just BBQ sauce on them & the spicy ones were the biggest hit! We also had Tabasco on the side for anyone who wanted more spice but I think ours were just right! This is definitely going to be the way we do wings from now on!!!

Good! || Heya! I loved the recipe and it was just amazing. I cooked it for my family and it was all good and nice. I dried the wings before putting them in the flour mixture too as some reviewers said.

Anyway, I added some Heinz Classic BBQ Sauce and replaced the regular pepper hot sauce with x1.5 chili sauce for extra sweetness. I also added some soy and teriyaki and it came out sticky yet crispy.

I was looking for baked crispy wings and this recipe popped up.  A couple of things I brushed my wings with olive oil half way in the cooking process, I don't know if that helped but I wanted to make sure the were crispy, also dry chicken before cooking.  Next time I will season wings prior to the flouring them,  I will never fry another wing, Thanks.

This is a great recipe for baked wings.  I have made them several times and find that they turn out best when you refrigerate them overnight with the flour coating.  Also, the amount of butter can be reduced greatly, and the wings are still just as tasty.  I use about 2 TBSP of butter to 1/2 cup of wing sauce.  These are definitely the best wings I have made!  They are crispy and seasoned perfectly.

I patted the chicken wings with a clean kitchen towel before placing in the plastic bag and kept for about 1hr20m inside the refrigerator. I added cayenne pepper and hot sauce to adjust to my spice tolerance. It is sad that my oven broke the minute I was preheating, so I ended up deep frying instead. It still turned out pretty good! I will try it next time when my oven gets fixed.

These were very good.  45 minutes was the perfect baking time.  I then put them under the broiler on a separate pan for about 3-4 minutes to crisp them up.  If you like them spicy, I would use more cayenne pepper and lower the butter to Frank's Red Hot ratio.  Good recipe, thanks!

This recipe is really good.  I was trying to make it a bit more healthy so I substituted 1/4 c olive oil for 1/4 c of the butter. I baked it on a cooling rack as a reviewer said.  Be sure to put some water in the pan under the rack, I didn't and it smoked pretty bad.  My wings were really tasty. I cooked them in a convection oven and only baked them for about 25 minutes before it became obvious that they were done.

This is the best baked wing recipe I've tried so far. I didn't refridgerate them after coating them, since I was in a hurry & baked the wings without adding the sauce (turning them over halfway through). Instead, I tossed them in BBQ sauce ( didn't have any pepper sauce) after baking & they turned out great! The family loved them. Thanks for the recipe. I'll be trying them with other sauces in the future.

very crispy and delicious. I started by drying the wings really really well, even squeezing them a little. I then threw the wings and flour mix in a big ziploc bag and shook it. I left the wings in there for about 40 minutes, then on a tray lined with foil and sprayed with non-stick cooking spray. Baked them at 400 for 25 mins on each side. Whenever I checked on them, I wiped off juices in the pan with a paper towel on tongs just so they don't get soggy. I then dunked them in buffalo wing sauce and threw them back in the oven for 5 mins on each side. They were a little overdone, so next time I'll only put them in 20 mins on each side.

Awesome recipe! These were my personal changes to the original: This is for 12 wing pieces (no tips). I used only two tablespoons of flour, added pinch of salt, 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder, 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, and some fresh ground black pepper. Dry the wings in paper towels then shake in the flour mix; really shake off any extra flour, the wings should be ever so lightly covered. I place the wings on a wire rack (sprayed  with  Pam) then place rack on foil covered sheet pan. Place in fridge (uncovered) for one hour. Bake in preheated oven (400) for 20-30 mins. Flip wings and return to oven for another 20-30 min. I take the wings out and turn the oven to broil ... put the wings under broiler to brown and crisp. If you want crispy wings, do not coat with wing sauce until ready to serve.
Sauce: 1/3-1/2 cup Franks Red Hot sauce, one tablespoon butter, 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper, pinch of sugar; warmed in saucepan.

Very good recipe. Like others recommend, be sure to rinse then dry chicken wings before dredging in flour.  Also, I don't dip the wings before baking. I dredge, refrigerate, spray with cooking spray or olive oil misto, bake for about 40 minutes, then toss the crispy baked wings in sauce and serve. The flour makes the skin extra crispy and picks up more of the sauce.

Guests loved them. I followed the directions to pat dry before dredging, leave in the fridge on pan uncovered for an hour, bake 15-20 minutes on each side before brushing with sauce, and then the last 5 minutes or so on broil.

I was out of cayenne pepper so I added some cumin and chili powder instead. I also baked my wings directly on foil  and then dipped them in sauce just before serving. One of the best wing recipes I've found on this website. :-)

The guys here liked it!  Simple to make, I did refridgerate for about 1.5 hours as so many others recommended.  When I make again I'll be sure to finish with broiling them at the end to crisp things up a bit more (I ran out of time)

Made these for Superbowl. They were great. My family loved them.
Had no trouble coating with flour, this is something I always do with chicken. They do not need to be dry, with fried or baked chicken you always dip in wet ingredient and then shake in the flour.I swished them in more sauce before serving. That made the difference.I will make them again.

Didn't love it. Have found better recipes on this site. The wings were dry when I coated them and they sat in the fridge as needed, but they took longer than 45 mins to cook and stuck to the sprayed aluminum foil and just didn't crisp very well.

These wings were unbelievable.  I may have added a bit too much cayenne.. so the blue cheese dip and celery were necessary, but the flour dredge was really good!  They tasted better than most fried wings I've had!

This recipe was my first attempt at wings and it's a "keeper"! Great alternative to frying.  I can't wait to try it with legs and/or boneless breast.  I dried the wings, uncovered, in the fridg for several hours before dredging in the flour mixture.  Also, baked them on a rack so I didn't have to turn them.

My wife, who normally doesn't like wings, could not get enough of these!
I changed the breading recipe quite a bit by tripling the cayenne and garlic as well as adding a bit of cumin. They were baked at 400 for 50 minutes and they were good. They weren't super crispy, but they weren't soggy at all either. I used a broiler pan to keep the wings from swimming in their own fat. To get them a little crisper, I moved them to the top rack and put the broiler on for another 10 minutes. For the sauce, I used half texas pete and half margarine. They came out soo tender and juicy! Yum!

I actually make a much lower fat version, by using the  non-fat butter spray and coating the chicken with it before baking and turning frequently then when done and crispy I dip them in a bowl of Frank's red hot sauce and let stand a couple minutes to set. They are awesome!

Loved it! These are actually the best wings I've had in a long time although many people would say they're not real wings because they're not fried. I found the wings to be very mild though and for anyone looking for any spice make sure to add more cayenne and make the ratio of hot sauce to butter higher on the hot sauce end. Will definitely be making again with more heat!

My wings were less crispy than I would have preferred.  The flavor was great though.  I dried my wings well before flouring them and left them in the fridge for 3 hours.  The recipe on the Frank's Hot Sauce bottle is the same except it states to apply the sauce AFTER baking.  I ended up leaving them in the oven for 1 1/2 hours and then crisping them up with a kitchen torch. Next time I will do it according to the directions on the bottle and hope that it solves the problem.

This was disappointing. The wings were dried out when cooked on a rack in the pan, and just passable NOT on a rack; terribly bland flavor if I hadn't upped the hot sauce AND cayenne pepper amounts (let's just say I was skeptical from the beginning), and even then it was just "OK". Unfortunately, I made 10 lbs of wings for a baby shower as my first attempt at this recipe, so I've learned a valuable lesson - NEVER TEST A RECIPE ON AN EVENT BEFORE TRYING IT YOURSELF! I was embarrassed, to say the least, but needed a baked buffalo wing recipe, since frying was out of the question. Next time I'll just use a tried and true fried wing recipe and reheat in an oven prior to any event.

Good flavor but couldn't get them crispy. I will try to refrigerate longer next time.

I followed the recipe, but didn't have time to refrigerate for an hour.  I put the cookie sheet full of wings in the freezer instead for about 25 minutes.  Turned out great!

I make these the "healthy" way, with cut up chicken breasts. I do recommend drying the chicken out in the fridge before cooking. I put the sauce on the chicken AFTER they are done baking, just shake them in a bag with the sauce and serve. Much crispier! Great recipe!!

Don't be skimpy on the hot sauce!
Make sure the skin is well done & crispy?

It is a great recipe however when you make the dry mix you're usually left with a good 20g of flour at the end.
I usually make this on a regular basis and have only tweaked this recipe slightly to make it a little hotter.

The only problem with the receipt is the issue of "crispy". I soaked my wings in hot sauce over night, rolled them in the flour mixture and into the refrigerator for an hour. Put them on a foiled sheet pan and let them bake for 20 minutes per side. Pulled them out and dipped them into the hot sauce mixture and baked them for an additional 5 min. Perfect and the clean up is great.

While these didn't taste bad and everyone ate them, they were very bland. Not sure if it was all that butter diluting the hot sauce or just not enough spices (I added more than called for). I drained the butter that the wings were drowning in halfway through cooking when I turned them.
Not my favorite, and I was really looking forward to HOT wings. Oh well, I'll try another recipe next time.

I made these wings as directed although I prepared two pans for baking and spaced the wings so they wouldn't be crowded allowing most of the cooking juices to bake off.  They were crispy and delicious.  I will definately be making these again.

Love these.  Sauce was a little thin, just put in freezer for a few minutes to thicken it up.  Baking much better than frying!

I thought I'd made enough to have some for lunch the next day, but my husband and I ate all 20 of the wings. I followed the recipe exactly and they were very crispy in 45 minutes.  Following the advice of other reviewers, I dried them thoroughly before coating with the flour.  Next time I'll reduce the butter and hot sauce by 50%.  You just don't need nearly that much.

These turned out GREAT!!  I have never made wings before.  I made some modifications.  I dried the wings, put them in flour only, put them in the freezer for 30-40 min to save time.  Put them in the oven with the flour only on a 'speed bake' for 20min, turned them, brushed sauce on them, baked for another 20min, turned them again and brushed more sauce on them to bake for 5 more min, took them out of the oven to then turn them one more time and brush sauce on them one last time.  They had a caramelized and crispy taste.  They were amazing!!  I used a sauce on them that several people referred my husband to try.  It was great!  We will be having these again in the very near future!!

I dredged the wings in my gluten free flour mix, after drying them throughly and put them in a baking pan, refrigerated as per the recipe, then put the pan in my Weber grill. Very crispy, but 45 min was a bit too long.

Love this recipe. For sure stuck with the recommendations of 1) making sure the chicken isn't wet 2) applying hot sauce/butter mixture twice (before and half way through baking and 3)baking for longer than 45 min...more like an hour, 4) putting more pepper, garlic and hot sauce and 5) on a slightly higher temp like 400 degrees to get crispy. 

I don't know if you are supposed to or not, but I for sure get as much of the skin off as possible and it still is plenty juicy. 

Enjoy.

These were crispy and flavorful, and so easy! Unfortunately not terribly healthy, as 'baked' might imply, but I guess we're talking chicken wings here. The house filled with smoke from the chicken grease, but I used the tip to place the wings on a rack on top of a lined tray and they mostly stayed out of the grease and were not soggy at all. Served with extra hot sauce for those who like it spicy!

Me and my daughters loved this recipe. The best thing about it is if you just want a spicy breading for your chicken you just leave the sauce off.

These were wonderful!  I was in a rush, and was unable to refrigerate for an hour.  I seasoned the wings with salt and pepper, then put them into the flour mixture.  I baked them for about 30 minutes in a 400 degree oven to crisp them a bit.  Then I started to baste the sauce on them and bake for another 20 minutes.  Finally broiled for another 30 minutes, and turned every 5-10 minutes, basting until the sauce was gone.  Long process but worth the great results!

These wings are all they promise.
I made 1 mistake in preparing these and that was not using a baking sheet with sides. I used a flat sheet and had oil all over my oven but it was worth the mess because the wings were perfect.
I dipped the floured, refrigerated wings in a mixture of oil and butter rather than all butter and didn't add any sauce to the oil before dipping them. After the wings were baked, I dumped them in a bowl with hot sauce and butter. I was a little concerned because I used WP 5000 instead of all-purpose flour because I'm on a low carb diet, but the wings were nonethelss perfect, crisp wings.

I've been looking for a hot wing recipe for a while and have tried many others. This one is by far the best I've found. It was very very tasty! Letting the wings refrigerate for an hour was the key.

sooooo freaking good! i didnt change anything with this at all, i did it exactly like they said and my wings were amazing.  i wished i had made more for leftovers.  my husband loved them also and i know this because whenever i make something new, i always ask him after he eats if its something he would ask me to make again, and he said "hell yea" so i know just by that that its a good recipie!!!

Leesah, You have just made my life a hundred degrees simpler, because this recipe is so easy to make varying degrees of heat for various members of my family without remaking a recipe to so it. I just start with the lesser heat, add more cayenne and hot pepper sauce. make more. Add more ingredients. The wings are wonderful and everyone is happy. Thank you so much

I am a very picky eater and wouldn't eat these but I made them for my boyfriend and my parents and they all LOVED them. I am not really familiar with all the different ways you can buy chicken and accidently bought the entire wings...oops. So prep time was a bit longer for me. I will definitely be using this recipe again in the future! Thank you!!

Ok, my results were a soggy mess.   I did dry them very well, however, I'd say that the wings were still too cold in the middle. Or, these poultry factories are adding far to much water weight.   I had to grease a broiler pan and dry them out for 45 minutes.   Wow, ordering some fast food would have been much less trouble.  11:20 pm

Good. Good. I love wings and fried wings- but need the fix with out frying was something I need- I made this for my boyfriend and his cousin- who love wings and they liked this- it was not as spicy as I liked- will add red pepper flakes and more hot sauce- they came out good. BUT! 1/2 WAY THOUGH THE PROCESS OR ABOUT 10 MINS BEFORE i DID BRUSH ON MORE SAUCE/TURN THEM OVER-

Tried them first using the exact directions and was disappointed in how soggy they were.  I tried a second time, but this time baked on a rack in the baking sheet.  This kept them out of the juices and were much better.  I may try what others have suggested and put the sauce on after baking.

This is a great recipe!  The wings came out perfect.  Crunchy on the outsid and juicy on the inside.  In my opinion, they taste better than fried chicken!

Excellent wings. Thank you. I misread the directions and added the sauce after they were cooked.  They were perfect for me this way. Delicious, juicy, and the perfect crisp.

I followed  the directions exactly as written, and the wings were okay, but not great. After 45 minutes in the oven the wings were done, and still juicy, but the skins were not crispy enough. I should have left them in longer to crisp up the skins, but I was crunched for time so I couldn't. Also, the sauce coating was too thin and too little flavor, so I think it would have been better to dip the wings in the sauce after they had been cooked, as some other reviews have recommended.

better than fried for sure! This is how I did: 1. cut 6-7 wings : 12-14 small wings in total 2. wash and sprinkle 1-2T of essense on the wings 3. arrange them on a rack and refrigerate for an hour or longer 4. preheat the oven at 424'F and bake for 45 min (after first 30 min, turn them over)  5. 1/4C hot wing sauce + 1T butter+2 cloves of crushed garlics; heat it throughly on the stove 6. after wings are baked, coat them with the warm sause 7. enjoy with baked fries (bake'em at the same time)

These are by far the best wings I've ever had. They were soft, moist,and tender, not dried out and tough. They were crispy and had a great flavor.They were not real hot so next time, I'll add extra hot sauce.

The wings were really good, just needed a little more spice which i will fix next time. Mine were not soggy at all, very crispy on the outside and juicy inside. Only "lesson" i learned it to make sure to use enough cooking spray because some of my skin was pulled off onto the tin foil

Very tasty! My only complaint is that they took longer to cook than 45 min, i had to broil them to make them crispier and i did chill them with the breading on for 1 hour.

The key to these wings is to make sure they are dry before putting them in the flour. Tried these with Emeril's Buffalo Wing Sauce.  They were great!

Love this recipe. My boyfriend is addicted to these wings. It is very important not to recover them in sauce while they're cooking. That just washes the flour and sauce away.

Per the recommendation of previous reviews, I cooked them on a rack.  I ended making my buffalo sauce a little different.  A little bit of this, a little of that (margarine, paprika, chili powder, onion powder, garlic powder, cayenne, vinegar, habanero sauce, a hint of sugar, ketchup, and BBQ sauce.  I cooked half of the batch with sauce, and half without.  The  ones without sauce came out slightly crispier, but the ones with sauce came out more flavorful, especially since I basted them with 15 min of cooking time left.  Next time I might marinate the chicken with sauce then bread it.  Overall, a great recipe with flexibility and an awesome substitute for the original fried buffalo wings.

The flavor was good, but they weren't crispy at all.  I had them in the fridge for several hours, then baked them on a rack, did everything exactly as specified in the recipe, but they weren't crispy, so they were quite different from traditional fried buffalo wings.

These wings were excellent. I made them for my Superbowl paarty and they were a huge hit. I added extra cayenne about a TBSP. The only problem I had was my sauce was a little too thick, and didn't stick as well. But that is easy to fix. These are now my new favorite wings.

These were fantastic!  I put a lot more cayenne and hot sauce and they were fantastic.  The key to the crispness of the skin is definitely patting them dry, then dry them in the frig for an hr, then coat with flour mixture and put in frig again for another hour before cooking.  Also, I made two without the hotsauce/butter sauce and they were still awesome and hot!!!!!

These came out crispy, but they are not a reasonable replacement for fried wings.  Flavor was off from the flour.   Beware of them sticking to the pan while baking and grease the pan liberally.

I followed the recipe exactly as written and they were perfect.  Not too hot but hot enough.  Very tender and flavorFUL.  Were easy to make and not a lot of mess to clean up.  Nor were they soggy or sitting in very much grease or liquid like some reviewers stated.  My friends loved them, too.

What a fabulous alternative to the usually fried version. Everyone in my family was happy, even my daughter who does not like her food too spicy. They have the perfect flavor without an over abundance of heat. We just had them yesterday and my son woke this morning and asked when I could make them again. My compliments to the recipe submitter.

Not bad, not bad at all. I think it may need more garlic but I thought the spices such as cayenne pepper was just about right. I used 3 tsps. of the cayenne and 1/2 cup tabasco in the butter. I dried the wings well, the flour held and I baked them on a rack as suggested. I've read reviews where people complain of them being soggy and all I can say is that they are probably not drying them well. Maybe some black pepper next time...

Although mine didn't get crispy like the description says, they were very yummy.  I doubled the flour mixture and the sauce for a 3 lb. bag of wings.  This is a keeper for sure - also, they did great sitting on the buffet in a crock pot to stay warm.

These were awesome.  I dredged frozen wings and then baked them in the sauce.  I think it took about 1.5 hours all together because they were frozen.  When they were almost done I basted them with sriracha hot chili sauce and they were AWESOME!  I also used the full 5 tsp of cayenne and I thought they were perfect.

Restaraunt quality!  I baked on a grill rack so it wouldn't sit in grease while baking.  Would recommend saucing one more time before serving, but otherwise fantastic!

I was not happy with the flour coating. Came out of the oven fine but after saucing they became soggy. Next time I will skip the flour and just season. Also steaming for 10 mins before putting them in the oven cuts down the fat and helps them crisp up!

I eat a LOT of hot wings, and my wife and I agree that these are the best wings we have ever eaten!  Thanks for clearing up the amount of cayenne; I cut your original 5tsp. in half but they were still too hot for my wife.  It didn't stop her from going back for seconds, though!  Next time I will use 1/2 tsp.  Oh yeah, there will definitely be a next time; and soon!

I usually fry my buffalo wings before baking it, which is so time consuming so I was eager to try this recipe.  I pretty much followed the recipe (with 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper); I figured the recipe didn't require "20 whole wings", but rather "10 mini-drumsticks & 10 safety pins", which is what we call it in our house.) As suggested, I used a rack to keep the wings crispy.  After turning over, I "basted" it by spooning the drippings.  I also made a dipping sauce using 1/3 c melter butter and 1/3 c hot pepper sauce.  My hubby is a buffalo wing lover, and he gave this recipe the "thumbs up"!

I made these last night and they turned out great! Crispy and flavorful.  I doubled the sauce and used the remaining sauce to dip in after they were done baking. This made the finishing touch for us. I used 1 tsp cayenne after reading the reviews and could have definitely used more for a spicier wing, which I will do next time.  All the same, great wings and great recipe. Thank you!

I had never made wings before and these turned out pretty well. I halved the recipe but still put in the 1/2 tsp of cayenne (like the correction review stated) and a 1/4 cup hot sauce (I used Texas Pete because that's all we had). I definitely will make these again but I'll make the following changes: 1) I'll probably double or triple the amount of cayenne and add some additional hot sauce as well. Definitely needed more kick. 2) I'll try cooking it on a rack next time because it ended up swimming the the grease a lot. 3) I will spray the aluminum or rack extremely well with cooking spray because I had some issues with sticking. Otherwise, they weren't soggy at all because I patted and squeezed with a paper towel after rinsing, as well as leaving them in the fridge for about and hour and half.

Yum Yum Yum!!! I had not ever made wings before and was a little worried about how they would turn out. I have made these twice and they were easy and delicious! A huge hit for a very critical wing loving family, This is without a doubt a keeper! Thanks for the recipe!

My first review! I could not stay quiet after eating these! I am a Wing LOVER, and these are the best. CRISPY!! Not saucy!! My wife and I could not stop eating them! Other comments; I had never cooked wings myself, so I did not know that twenty wings, once cut apart, equaled 40 wings. That was OK, we just had more...thank God! I used two and a half teaspoons cayenne and Franks Extra Hot sauce. We like our wings "spicy" but these were just a bit too hot, so next time it will be 2 teaspoons. Lastly, I found that even after turning them halfway, the wings sometimes stuck to the foil. Next time I will spray my cooking spray liberally rather than lightly. Enjoy!!   Oooops...I almost forgot....you HAVE to make Mexican Rice III and Best Black Beans from this website and serve on the side!!!!

Came out well for a first try.    The oven seemed to make the Frank's lose its kick.  Next time I'll try baking the chicken before dipping it in the butter mix.  Definitely a keeper though!

These were sooo good. I followed the recipe exactly except I used 3 tsp cayenne pepper instead of 5. Next time I might use more hot sauce because I like a lot of spice.

These are the best wings I've ever made and/or have ever eaten.  I love crisp wings without the slop of sauce.  The second time around I removed the skin from the wing but they were a little dry...but really not bad.

From my own experience, traditional Buffalo Wings do not get coated with anything before cooking. This recipe is on the right track but would be so much better without the coating that prevents the skin from becoming crispy. A good alternative for sauce is the Franks Red Hot "Wing Sauce". Just follow the directions on the bottle.

Great wings, this was the first recipe I tried to make my own wings.  Definitely need to dry the wings though, I missed that step and they were a little bit soggy.  Reheated the leftovers in the oven the following day, added more sauce, and they came out perfect. Making them again today

Fantastic. I put them on a broiler sheet to keep them crispy and let some of the fat drain. I've made then twice in the past 10 days for an appetizer. Everyone loves them.

I LUV buffalo wings, and I hate how much wing shops charge for them.  I was super excited to find a recipe for them so I don't have to pay 3x as much at a shop.  I don't recommend putting them in the fridge after coating them.  Otherwise, excellent recipe.

Great alternative to frying!  These were super tasty, but I forgot to pat dry the wings prior to dipping them so they turned out just a little soggier than expected. My husband and I loved them!  I will definitely use this recipe from now on!

I didn't read the reviews and used 5 teaspoons of cayenne and super hot buffalo sauce and they turned out just fine. They did come out a bit soft and I put them in at 420F for 30 minutes. but the next day I put them in the toaster oven at 400F for 20 and they came out great. Also when I flipped over the chicken I changed the foil to dry them a bit. I thought they were great.

These were really good. I used chicken tenders instead of chicken wings and I cut waaaay down on the cayenne, and also went a bit easier on the Frank's because we're don't like our chicken too spicy.  These would have been a 5 if the breading was crispy; ours wasn't but still good.  I will make this again for sure and play around with it to find a way to make the tenders crispy.

I think these wings are awesome.  Whenever I serve them I get rave reviews.  The only thing I changed was reducing the cayenne pepper to 2-3 teaspoons.

I changed the recipe a bit, I used the flour mixture and then dip them in sweet baby rays bbq sauce. My husband wasn't very satisfied with adding in hot sauce though.

I waited to add the sauce until the wings were cooked through.  I just tossed the sauce with the wings and then served them.  They were great.

Well, I waited the whole hour before cooking these baby's I gotta say, boy howdy! These were espically hot.  I cooked them for the alloted time on the first side at the right temp but had to turn it up to 425 degrees for the last 25 minutes to crisp them properly.  Really good with blue cheese chuncky dressing.

I ended up doing the flour part and leaving them in the fridge overnight. This must've been okay because they turned out great! Not soggy in the least, can't wait to have these again.

If it was solely up to me, I'd probably give this recipe three stars, but my husband really liked it so I decided to compromise. I followed it exactly (except for decreasing the cayenne to 1/2 tsp per all the reviews. I used drumsticks instead of wings.

This recipe was easy to follow and the wings were "the best". As lovers of chicken wings, my family enjoyed these for the first time on Halloween 2008. It wasn't hard ripping that trick or treat candy out of the hands of my little ones when they saw the huge platter of wings.(As a family of 8, I more than doubled the quantity,minus all the cayenne of course!) We have enjoyed these wings several times since! Thanks for the AWESOME recipe!

These turned out yummy.  I used about 2 tsp of cayenne and PC Hot Buffalo Wing Sauce instead of the butter/Frank's.  They turned out nice and crispy with a nice yummy spicy flavour. Hubby raved about them.  Would make these again :)

My family loved this recipe and the best part was that I could leave out some of the hot stuff so my boyfriend could eat it without it causing problems with his diverticulitis. The wings were great. They were moist on the inside and crispy on the outside. An all around great dish!!!

These were great! they hit the spot, but i was looking for something more garlicky. I used the Mexican hot sauce Tapatio for the hot sauce and it worked for me! Also floured my chicken. Thanks for the recipe!

I tried this recipe for the Super Bowl using skinless chicken tenders and it came out great.  I baked them at 400F for 32 minutes and they came out tender and juicy with plenty of taste.  I used the 5 tsp. of cayenne and added 2 tsp of blended peppers to create taste with a slow-burn effect.  They were well received by the crowd.

These are stupendous!!!! Gone in minutes. I did follow some of the other tips that were added by reviewers. I did not add the hot sauce and butter until about the last 15 minutes of baking. I know that I will use this recipe every time I make wings from now on. Thanks for sharing.

I wasn't too crazy about these.  I could taste the flour mixture on the wings after they were cooked and I didn't think the sauce stuck to the wings very well.  I ended up dipping them in sauce after they came out of the oven too.  I guess personal preference is that we only like our wings fried.  I was going for something healthier with this recipe, but it's not even worth it.  I ate 2 and I think DH ate about 4.

Very easy to do. My family doesn't like spice (aka hot). Used paprika instead of cayenne. Used barbeque sauce instead of pepper sauce. Even my picky eater loved these. Have saved it to my recipe box. Will definitely do again - playing with different flavorings.

I have been married for 18 yrs. We are a football and wing family. These are the BEST BAKED WINGS and so easy to adapt. I inject them with several marinades flour and fridge. It works great with the sauce in or out of these wings.

These were excellent.  Have made these several times.  I will say however, my oven ended up a mess with all the splattered grease.  The last 2 times I made these I put them on the gas grill with the cover down.  Must say, much easier clean up than my oven!  Thanks for the recipe.  Definitely a keeper.

OMG  if u don't love these then i don't know what to say. me and my picky husband just loved these. i made them late at night and served them with salad. if i could i would rate them a 10 out 5.  i noticed some ppl mentioned that they were not too crispy, i think it may be the meat they are choosing because ours were just perfect.  thank u so much for posting...

PERFECT!  I made these for an after-game event for a bunch of football coaches.  They were gone in no time!

These were good. Whole family enjoyed them. I was hoping they would be crispier. Will try some of the suggestions next time. Definitely will make again.

Mmmmmmm.  These are great.  Just a thought, to make them saucier I think that next time I will toss them in a little hot sauce right out of the oven before serving.  VERY YUMMY!

Awesome wing recipe! I followed the recipe with the exception of using Ranch dressing instead of Blue Cheese, and used "Franks Red Hot Buffalo Wing Sauce". These are by far the best wings I have ever made. Thanks for an easy and delicious recipe!
