Hi all, it's me, SouthernGma.  Wanted to let you know that if you have leftover hamburger, hotdog buns or rolls for sub sandwiches, you can split them and toast on a tray in the oven and use up that extra bread in making this bread pudding.  Works just as well and a good way to use up bread before you have to feed it to the birds or toss it.  1/2 of a burger, hotdog or sub roll will equasl one slice of farmhouse-style bread.

This is sooooo good! I just used reg white bread & altho I added 4 extra slices, I don't think it was enough because the pudding was a little too mushy for my taste. My fault tho, not the recipe's. If I use reg bread again, I think I would use at least 6 extras, possibly even more. The vanilla sauce is totally different than other vanilla sauce I've had/made before. It's thicker, like a thinned out pudding, so it kind of spreads over the bread pudding, instead of soaking down into the bread. It threw me at first but I really liked it! 1 more note, I put mine into a 3 qt dish because that's what I had availble. It baked perfectly in that size, puffing up over the top, but not spilling over & I didn't have to cover it at all, it was perfectly golden. Of course, it deflated while cooling(normal). I'm not sure mine would've fit into a 2 qt dish, as called for in the recipe.

This was tasty. Although, it is really sweet! I didn't have farm house bread, but the recipe said to use a "hearty" style bread, so I used bread from a homemade loaf I made the other day. I only had a small 1.5 oz box of raisins, and just used that. I don't care for raisins that much anyway. After 1 hour of baking I noticed the bread had risen to the top and the sauce was on the bottom. I stirred it lightly and then put it back in the oven for 10 minutes, and it thickened up fine. The bread pudding was very sweet, like I had said, so I do wish I would have cut back the sugar some. The sauce did have a nice brown sugar and vanilla taste. However, it is also really sweet and does thicken up almost immedietely after it cools just slightly. It might have to be thinned out a little, with some milk or cream, especially if using it the next day.

This is the best Bread Pudding I have ever made! Everyone raved. I used a 1 lb loaf of Italian Bread and increased the servings to 12 (backed the white sugar down to 1 3/4 cups) and left the vanilla sauce at 8 servings. Absolutely perfect in every way. Thank you, SouthernGma for sharing this recipe. It will be used often and passed on to the family.

Excellent!  I cut all of the sugars in half and it's still plenty sweet.  Also cut butter back slightly.  I used a large loaf of Italian bread cut into 1 1/2" cubes, well toasted in the preheating oven for about 10 minutes.  I think that's the secret to it not being overly soggy.  Used 2 1/2 C skim milk plus 1/2 C half & half in the pudding part, and in the sauce 1 C skim milk and 1/4 C half & half.  Plenty rich.  Will make this often!

This is excellent! Even my super picky husband loved it. Used toasted, cubed french bread and substituted finely chopped green apples for raisins (didn't have any) I added more cinnamon than called for to the bread pudding and the sauce (we love our cinnamon). This was just excellent. Thank you, SouthernGma!

Excellent! The only thing I did different was I heated the milk because I wanted to make sure the sugar was fully dissolved. The family loved the bread pudding with the vanilla sauce on top. Thank you for a nice recipe.

My pudding separated and curdled and is soggy.  Can someone tell me what went wrong?  Some say 375 is way too hot.  I did quadruple the recipe to serve at church and allowed extra time testing for doneness along the way.  Both pans turned out the same.  Never had this happen before using another recipe.

Absolute pure comfort for a fall, blustery day.  Everyone is lickin their lips and rubbing their satisfied bellies in this house.  I made it exactly as written.  Next time, which will be real soon, I will try apple chunks and cranberries instead of raisins, and I might even flamb√© a little rum into the sauce just for fun.  No changes are needed, just to add a little variety.  Thanks Southern Grandma, I knew it had to be good if it came from your Mom's Bible...only very special things are kept there.

Extremely good.  The Wife requested I add additional fruits.  I complied by making a special one with a dried fruit blend substituted for the raisins and increased it to 1 1/2 cup as well.  Excellent.  The Sauce is very very good. Recommend using quality vanilla in the sauce as it is noticeable if you use the cheap stuff.

As written, the sweetness is megawatt. But the basics were there, so I tinkered. The second time I cut the sugar back to 1 cup, and whereas it was better, it was still too much for me. It was OK that way if you don't plan to top it with the sauce. But we discovered the right proportion when serving the sauce was a mere 3/4 cup of sugar. BOO ya! That allowed the vanilla sauce to fulfill the role of complementing the rich, homey goodness of the pudding and pointing up the delicate cinnamon whisper. I added the grated peel of one lemon, which contributed a nice foil to the creamy richness, and made the orchestration of luxurious tastes shine. All in all, the recipe posted is a decent foundation, but it needed a major reduction in sugar to appeal to our palates.

I've made a LOT of bread puddings and this one is my favorite.  I did use 3/4 cup of 1/2 & 1/2 and the 2 1/4 cups of skim milk but otherwise followed the recipe.  I didn't make the sauce since my picky hubby doesn't like "sauce" on his bread pudding.  Anyway, it was the perfect way to use up some old hamburger/hotdog buns!  The 1/2 tsp of cinnamon was absolutely perfect, just a hint of cinnimonny flavor (if that's a word!).  We love it cold from the fridge.  This is now my go-to recipe for bread pudding!  Thanks Gail for the great recipe.

I love bread pudding, I love cinnamon and I love this recipe.  Last month I made the bread pudding in foil cake pans, froze it and had it ready for the next holiday or need for a dessert. I put the frozen bread pudding in 350 degree oven for 45 minutes & loosely covered the top with foil.  Meanwhile I made the sauce.  I only increased the cinnamon to 1 tsp.  When the bread was hot, I covered it with the sauce and served it.  Sweet and delicious!!!!!

Made this for my wifes quilting club and they loved it!!  Used diced canned peaches because the wife does not prefer raisins.
Used "Los Cinco Soles" vanilla in the sauce.  Very deep vanilla flavor.
Wonderful recipe!!

Delicious! I halved the recipe ( used 2 eggs) & didn't make the sauce (was out of brown sugar). I doubled the cinnamon & used stale hambuger buns. This is sooo good!

I have made this dish several times and each time it gets better and better. I bake it mostly as the recipe entails, but will usually substitute heavy or light cream for the whole milk. I also don't like raisins, so I'll substitute dried cranberry or chocolate chips. Very delicious and I will continue to make this for years to come.

This is the best bread pudding recipe ever. It may take a little more time in preparation for the sauce but is well worth it in taste.

I followed the advice of another reviewer and substituted 10 toasted hamburger bun halves in place of the bread. What a wonderful way to use them up. I also used half and half in place of the whole milk.  This is definitely a keeper.

I made this with leftover powdered donuts and cinnamon donuts. My husband's coworkers loved it!

Update 9/8/2013: Made this again with glazed and old fashioned sour cream donuts. Another hit!

This recipe is perfection! Here in Texas, we eat bread pudding for breakfast, so I did make slight changes to make it a breakfast pudding.  I skipped the white sugar and used 3/4 cup of brown sugar instead. We use almond milk in our family, so I used almond milk instead of milk, and it turned out just perfect. I had some bread from Sprouts that was made with walnuts, raisins, dried cranberries, and cinnamon. This bread was going to mold if I didn't use it up (we got it in the clearance for a dollar!), so this is what I used. I didn't need to add any raisins, because this bread is just packed with them. I did add a chopped honeycrisp apple, though. I made it in my dutch oven, which worked perfectly. 

The sauce is delicious! I can't stop tasting it. I added a tablespoon of coconut oil to it just for the heck of it (I need to add weight to my adult son, so making it higher calorie was a good idea). To keep the sauce from being lumpy, and to keep it smooth, I wisked it the entire time it was cooking - just like you would do a good gravy.  It is perfectly smooth and saucy.  

I will be making this again... and again and again and again.

This was amazing! I ran out of brown sugar when it came time to make the pudding the first time and used 1/4C brown and 1/4 C white and it was so good that when I made it according to the directions the second time my family requested I make it "my way". I had a large crowd of picky children tonight who don't like raisins or bread pudding, but they ate every bite and even asked for seconds! Kudos to the person who posted this!! Right now I'm on a high calorie soft food "diet" (for lack of better words) for health related reasons (and I had teeth pulled) and I LOVE this recipie!!  Thx for sharing

I don't say this often, but too, too sweet! For me anyway.  I didn't make the vanilla sauce, and used leftover potato rolls.  The taste was delicious, though, and I will try again with seriously, half of the sugar.  But I guess that's just personal preference.  I'm also interested in trying the sauce next time. Thank you!

I MADE THIS DISH AND TOOK TO WORK AND THEY SIMPLY RAVED OVER IT. I TOOK SOMEONES SUGGESTION AND USE HEAVY CREAM INSTEAD OF MILK AND I ALSO LET IT SIT OVERNIGHT IN THE FRIDGE BEFORE BAKING. WILL USE THIS RECIPE FOR NOW ON. GREAT STUFF.

Very good!  I used fresh blueberries instead of raisins.  I agree on using less sugar and more bread. I really like the sauce as well. I did use the heavy cream because that is what i always used before when making bread pudding. Thanks for sharing!

Very good bread pudding.  Rich and delicious!! I will only make this for really special occasions because it is way too fattening.

I had never had bread pudding so I thought I would try it.  This was delicious - my whole family loved it!  I had baked some bread from a recipe on this site and used it instead of store bought, and I thought it was great.  I also didn't add raisins because some don't like them.  This is definitely the only recipe I will use!  Thank you for sharing!

This was delicious and easy to make.  The only change I made was to decrease the sugar to a little under 1 cup, since others said that with 1 1/2 cups of sugar it was a little too sweet.  It came out perfect!  Thanks for this great recipe.

Made this recipe for my husband and guests last night.   I had never made or eaten bread pudding before last night.   It was extremely easy to make and was utterly delicious!   A total hit, and the vanilla sauce was wonderful!

I followed this recipe, but used a cup of coconut milk and added pecans instead of raisins.  I also added a pinch of nutmeg and shredded coconut to pudding.  I  didn't need the vanilla sauce.  I added whipped cream.  I LOVED IT!  MAKE THIS, IT'S EASY!  YOU WILL CERTAINLY BE GLAD YOU DID!

Delicious! Thanks for the great tip of using frozen old hamburger or other rolls from your freezer! A great way to use up old bread.  I toasted all of my cubed bread and no sogginess. Tip: I think I cooked the sauce too long, since it tasted a bit eggy and custard-like. Be careful to not overcook your sauce.

I would give this recipe 5 stars just for the vanilla sauce!!  Once I test a recipe, I only keep those which get raves from my husband, and he declared this one a "KEEPER!!" after the first bite.  Delicious.

I made this recipe just about an hour ago since my husband is a big fan of bread pudding. It turned out AMAZINGLY GREAT!!! I followed the recipe exactly except I omitted the raisins - not a fan - and I used a 1 lb loaf of Italian bread. DELICIOUS! Thanks for this recipe!

I changed up the recipe quite a bit. I only used 1 cup sugar and used 2% milk for both pudding and sauce. For the bread I went to a local bakery and purchased a loaf of cinnamon bread. I also used dark brown sugar for both giving a nice rich flavor and darkening the sauce given a caramel color. Very tasty! Family loved it.

Amazing! I don't even like bread pudding, I made this for my husband and I loved it! He loved it too and even went on to say it was the best bread pudding he had ever had (And he's from the South.)! I made it exactly like the recipe. It was perfect! Everybody should try this one.

i just made the sauce.  the flavor was good, but the egg curdled.  probably my fault, but i didn't like it enough to try again.  on the up side, it was not as sweet as some other sauces i've tried.

Amazing! I wouldn't change a thing in this recipe. The vanilla sauce is what makes this recipe stand out, so make sure you don't skip it!! If you don't like things too sweet, than cut down on the sugar a bit, but otherwise this is heavenly!

I had some "Advent Bread" (White bread with a pinch of Cardamon) left and used this! I am no Bread Pudding fan, but this one was super yummy! The only thing I added was dark choc drops!! Was liked by all my family!!

This was great. I only made a couple of small changes - we hate raisins so I used a handful of chocolate chips in their place. Instead of putting the bread into the egg mixture and then pouring it into the greased pan, I put the cubed bread in the greased casserole dish, sprinkled the chocolate chips on top, and then poured the egg mixture over it. I then pushed the bread that hadn't been soaked under to make sure it was all soaked. I made it in the morning and just heated it up in the oven while we were eating the main course and then while I was making the vanilla sauce. Delicious - thank you so much!

I made this recipe for my family yesterday, they had never eaten bread pudding prior to me making it.  I followed the recipe, however, I did use a combination of whole milk, 1% milk, and heavy whipping cream for both the pudding and the vanilla sauce. Instead of pouring the sauce on separately, I mixed my sauce in the pudding and baked ait a little longer....turned out just like my grandma used to make....DELICIOUS!

Excellent recipe as written!  Some reviewers have  experienced too dry or to "wet" of consistency after baking.   Breads/types vary and you can't just go by "10 slices".   For example, I used French bread that I sliced and toasted in the toaster.   I toasted 9 slices but only ended up using 8.  It is important to go by the visual ratios of  liquid with the bread.  I could see after adding 7 slices, it was still a little heavy on the remaining liquid so I added one more slice.  The baked consistency was heavenly.   The ratio of bread within the custard resulted in moist but not the least bit "soggy" bread pudding.    Everyone thoroughly enjoyed this dessert.  And the sauce... YUMMY and I think it is best served over individual servings.

This recipe is fantastic and what is even better is it can be tweaked to taste.  I halved the sugar (to 3/4c) like many others suggested (I honestly can't imagine any more sugar than that, especially if the pudding is served with the vanilla sauce).  I also upped the cinnamon to 2 heaping tsps and added around 1/2-3/4 tsp of freshly grated nutmeg.  We don't really like raisins, so I omitted them.  I also opted for challah.  Incredible.  This is the second time I've made this recipe and everyone is always pleased.

My husband, kids, and grands all loved this!  I will definitely be fixing this again. The only change I will make is to cook it for a full hour.

Exceeded my expectations! I had three half loaves of white italian / wheat italian / bakery white bread, threw them un the toaster and/or in the oven to toast up before mixing them in.  I think I may have used more than the 10 slices but my mixture was heavily moist but not soupy when I put it in the pans. I used 2 8x8 disposable brownie pans, fit perfectly. Baked in 1 hr and didn't cover. Also didn't have a cup of raisins so threw in a handful of craisins. Equally delicious.

I have never had bread pudding before so i didnt know what to expect. Its too sweet so I cant eat as much of it as i would like. Its also very mushy but considering it is a type of pudding i guess thats normal. My sauce came out lumpy also. I dont know how to avoid that. But the overall taste was very good and the house smelled wonderful.

My buggy LOVED it.  Not a huge fan of the vanilla sauce... but I haven't tinkered with it much yet.  I may try to find something different to pair with it.

I definitely want to give this recipe another try, but with WAY less sugar. I followed the recipe exactly and it was incredibly sweet. Even for someone like me that has such a sweet tooth! To me, bread pudding should be slightly sweet and comforting. Not so sweet that it leaves you nauseous! I do, however, like the addition of a sauce. That's something I haven't really seen before, and made this bread pudding a bit special. If I can figure out the proper sweetness, I think this could end up being a winter tradition.

Work at a school and we had leftover cinnamon toast so I decided to make this bread pudding with that.  Wow...was it good!!  Because of the others backing off so much sugar and with what sugar was on the toast I only used about half of a cup, still stayed with the same amount of cinnamon but added a little more milk and one more egg because I felt it really needed that extra moisture (might have had more bread than what was stated too) It turned out wonderful!!  The sauce is a must too because it really sets it off, I could pour that stuff over anything and it would be good!  Well done, Southern Grandma!!

Loved this recipe with a few adjustments.  I used a small (8X8) glass dish, so I reduced the ingredients by 1/3, used 8 slices of bread (crust on) and added dried cranberries instead of raisins.  To prevent over browning I baked it for 20 minutes on 350 and increased to 375 for additional 35 minutes.  And to finish I topped it caramel sauce instead of vanilla.  Excellent!!

To save calories, we serve with powdered sugar instead of the sauce. Very delicious, and simple to make, and a great way to use up eggs and milk and bread. Thanks! For a twist, try chopped dried apricots or cherries!

I made this bread pudding and it was absolutely delicious. I think I messed up on the sauce but it was still delicious, the sauce just didn't look so good. It looked buttery like the butter separated and I couldn't get it to thicken up that much. But the taste of the sauce and bread pudding was perfect.

Delicious.  I made 1/2 recipe in a meatloaf pan and it turned out great.  The sauce was a bit lumpy and I can't figure out how to avoid that.  Maybe sift in the flour?  I don't know.  Anyway, it was very good and I am a huge bread pudding fan.

This was amazing.  I used 1% milk and about 3/4 cup of sugar.  I also used french bread sliced and toasted.
Easy and always have items on hand.  
This is a winner.  Doesn't even need the vanila sauce!

I had some 2 day old wholewheat buns full of seeds and raisins baked by my brother.  Cut them into cubes and threw in some raisins and sultanas.  Used brown sugar only. I should have read the reviews. Was way too sweet but turned out well. Will reduce sugar next time. Thanks.

Changes I made was just the bread had French bread so added about 4 extra slices. It was very easy to make the only change I will make next time is too cut down on the white sugar was a little too sweet. Did not make sauce to go over it. It's a keeper. The 4 stars was only for my personal taste of it being a little too sweet

Made this recipe for a gathering and it turned out great. My guests said they liked the bread pudding.  They liked  the flavor, texture, and spice of this bread pudding.  I rated this recipe a 4 because we didn't love the sauce. It was too sweet for an already very sweet bread pudding. I will make this recipe again without the sauce and might even cut out some of the sugar.

As good as,  or better than, the HAL Cruise Lines dish and sauce.  Made exactly as is except I may have been a little more generous with the butter.  I used less sugar in both the pudding and the sauce, but that is a matter of personal taste, some may prefer it sweeter than we do.  A real keeper, especially the sauce mixture!

Instead of 10 slices of bread, I used 5 cups of cubed, toasted bread crusts that were left over from some pimento sandwiches made last week for my niece‚Äôs baby shower. 

I also cooked in a splash of bourbon with the vanilla sauce with excellent  results. I‚Äôll make it again Saturday to share with my family.

This is the first bread pudding I have ever made. Since I'm over 60 that's saying something. My elderly mother raved about it. Said it was the best she had ever eaten. She was raised on bread pudding and has eaten it many many times. My husband loved it, as did I. I'm so glad this was the first recipe I've tried. I will look no further. This is now "my" bread pudding recipe. Excellent with lightly toasted stale butter croissants and toasted pecans with maple butter sauce. Heavenly!

This was my first foray into making bread pudding. My mother made it when I was young and her best friend who is from Panama, made the best bread pudding ever!! Everyone loved the pudding. I used 2 loaves of raisin bread and I added a little rum to the pudding and the sauce.  My family and friends are asking when will I make more..

This is my FAVORITE bread pudding recipe. A few notes: If you don't have whole milk, I like to do a mix of whatever milk I have (we never buy more than 2% ) and some light cream. If you don't like your bread pudding mushy, I prefer to use a dense bread like ciabatta or sourdough and toast it. Using leftover white bread will make it collapse a lot and mushier in the middle (and any leftover milk that didn't absorb will curdle.) Sourdough makes a mountain of a pudding! I just use a whole loaf.  Also, I've made the vanilla sauce but it's a little heavy for my taste- I make a lighter bourbon sauce with a few Tbsp butter, 1/4c brown sugar, a splash of bourbon and a tsp of vanilla. Any sauce leftover makes a great ice cream topping! My S/O is a good old southern boy and he says this is the best bread pudding he's ever had- and his favorite dessert that I make!

Excellent.  I've made this a few times and everyone has really liked it.  I normally use left over hamburger buns from the camping season that are sitting in the freezer at Christmas time.

I made this with week-old homemade rolls.  I soaked the bread a little longer than directed because the bread was dry.  I also cut the recipe in half  but followed the recipe as written.  It was delicious!  I used a homemade salted caramel sauce I already had made instead of the topping listed and topped it all off with  some sugared pecans (all recipes were from Allrecipes).  I warmed the sauce and served the pudding room temperature.  The comments were it tasted like a holiday!

Made this and I have to say everyone loved it. I wouldn't change a thing. The bread pudding wasn't too sweet so when you added the sweet vanilla sauce  it was just right. Think next time i will try it with peaches. Sorry I didn't add a photo but it didn't last that long. Will be making again soon. It's already a family favorite.

Amazing!! I baked this with 5 large croissants from Sam's instead of the bread. And I substituted the vanilla sauce for a Krispy Kreme-style glaze since I was missing a few ingredients. This stuff will melt in your mouth!!

i've never made bread pudding before and this recipe was soo easy and absolutely delicious. it was exactly what i was looking for. the only change i made was i used 1 cup of white sugar instead of the 1 1/2 cups. as others had suggested it was sweet enough and i agree.   great recipe!

Wonderful recipe! This is my third time making it now. I left out the raisins  this time just simply because I'm not a huge fan of them but I have made it with the raisins also and it is absolutely delicious either way!

This bread pudding is really good!
I replaced th raisins with pecans...
I used a cupcakes mold with cupcakes paper cups... I put a portion of the mix to fill at flat level... following the recipe it makes 18 cupcakes
I baked them at 365 by 25 minutes...
once out of the oven... I covered them with aluminum foil while the sauce was being prepared... then I put the sauce over each cupcake and let them cooled down for 20 minutes... finally I took them off the mold...
My family love them!

I used unsweetened  vanilla almond milk with leftover cinnamon bread and quartered donut holes  because that's what I had on hand.  Wonderful recipe, thanks for sharing!  I noticed that several have had problems with the sauce.  Because this sauce contains eggs, it will curdle if allowed to boil, so heat gently and remove from heat when it coast a spoon, as directed in the recipe.  Delicious!  I added a tiny bit of rum flavoring.

This has been my go to recipe for some time now. The recipe is great as is, but over time I have tweaked it a bit. I reduce the sugar and use 1 cup for the bread pudding. I add all of the bread pudding ingredients to a sauce pan, without the egg. I heat it up so the sugar dissolves and ingredients blend better. Then I take some of the hot liquid and temper the eggs before adding the eggs to the rest of the hot liquid. From there I just mix it with bread, and bake it as the directions say. I made it again tonight with 6 hot dog buns that I had left over, and 1/3 of a French baguette that I was planning to use with dinner. I toast the bread on low in the oven before adding to the liquid. It's such a great recipe and the only one I use.

I made with 1cup 2% milk & half of a  cup evaporated milk. Added a splash of vanilla coffee creamer for extra flavor (taken from one review). I wasn't thrilled with this recipe, although I may have made it wrong.  I've never tasted bread pudding before to know much of the difference. Found it very soggy.  Reminded me of cake dropped in a bowl of water. :(

This is delicious, I made it a little different by adding 1/2 cup of sweetened dried cherries and 1/2 cup of raisins  . I love the sauce too. This is the very first time I have made  this desert so I love that there is a video I can look at while cooking . Awesome , will make this again for Christmas Eve .thanks for the recipe!!

I love this recipe.  The only thing that I changed was, instead of using raisins, I used dried cranberries!  This is by far the best bread pudding that I ever had.  The Vanilla sauce was delicious, but a little to sweet for my preference.  Everyone else loved it though!

I got rave reviews from my coworkers. I followed another reviewers advice and soaked the bread in the pudding for about an hour before baking. I also added some bourbon to the vanilla sauce, which was a nice add-in.

Usually dont make the sauce because the family eats the pudding too fast. Best one I've tried yet. The sauce I double when I do make it to use with other deserts.

Used a bit less sugar and 2% milk. I keep quart size bags of bread pieces in the freezer which is the perfect amount to make a bread pudding. My husband just texted me from work to say that this was the best I've made yet. Thanks for the recipe.

I cut the sugar in half, and it was plenty sweet.  If I had used the amount of sugar in the recipe, it would have been WAY too much.  Plus, the milk curdled in the sauce when cooked on medium heat, so the cooking temp needs to be lower.  Overall, it was very yummy though.

This is the best bread pudding I've ever had! The only think I changed is the milk. I didn't have enough whole milk, so I used about 3/4 cup or so of heavy cream. Other than that, do not change a thing! This will be my go-to dessert for company. The vanilla sauce is a must! LOVE!

I used left over crescents from sam's, left out the raisins and added sliced bananas. My grown up kids loved it so much they said we should start having it for Christmas! It was amazing! Best I have ever had!

I don't like raisins so I omitted them.  Next time I will add pecans.  This was so easy and some of the best I have ever had. I served it and got rave reviews.  Thank you so much for this recipe.

I didn't use this bread pudding recipe so I am only rating the vanilla sauce. I thought it was ok but it really didn't have enough of a vanilla flavor and the sauce was not a smooth consistency but rather how cream looks when it starts to curdle.

Had a bunch of bagels, cinnamon raisin conveniently. Used 6 total for this recipe and as others noted, it puffed past my 2.75 qt dish but settled out perfect. Went with 1 cup white and 1/2 cup brown for main, love the added chewy of brown. Also added a 1/3 cup slivered almonds to the top. Can't wait to make again!!

This was a big hit at breakfast today!  Excellent recipe for bread pudding.  Having said that, I doubled the recipe and used one loaf of french bread, which worked out proportionally.  I did NOT double the sugar and was glad I had not.  We just don't need or want foods sweeter than necessary.  
It must have worked because my son-in-law requested that I keep making this one instead of a different recipe.  And one guest had a third serving!
The vanilla sauce was also very good, though we have been known to use whiskey sauce.  I will try making this same sauce and adding some whiskey next time.
I served it will a huge bowl of fresh sweetened strawberries which drew juice--also making the bread pudding delicious.
Thanks for a great new favorite!

This as such a nice treat enjoyed by my family. I made one with raisins and one without. The one with out, wasn't as pretty or plump like the one with raisins. I made the sauce twice as well. But the 1st time, it seemed a bit to brown for a vanilla sauce and the brown sugar was very prominent and stood out. It was quite nice but decided on the 2nd batch of vanilla sauce to cut the brown sugar to a 1/4th cup and used white granulated sugar for the other 1/4th cup...and it was perfectly vanilla-y where it needed to be ;-) other then that, it was excellent and the kids seem to really enjoy it. TY

I was making a bread pudding today, using another bread pudding recipe on here but after I put it in the oven I decided I wanted to make a sauce with it. I always make it without a sauce. I found this recipe while searching and thought I would try it. I realize it's not exactly fair to rate a partial recipe, but I try to rate every recipe I make. Well, this is only a review for the sauce that goes with this bread pudding(which, I am sure is fabulous, and I will be making for sure). The sauce was great! It was not overly sweet, in my opinion, and was rich and silky. I will serve my bread pudding with a sauce from now on:) Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is fantastic! I made it with pumpkin bread that had been made out of Thanksgiving leftovers but didn't have much flavor on its own, but which was perfect in this recipe. I substituted butterscotch schnapps for the vanilla in the sauce, and the results there were equally yummy. OMNOMNOMNOM.

This was simple, easy and a great food. We didn't have any raisins on hand so we made it without. great way to get rid of all the extra buns we bought for a grilling party a few weeks ago. My mother made one similar and used leftover raisin bread and cinnamon rolls, they are really good as well. Enjoy this recipe, it is a keeper.

My first attempt at bread pudding and everyone loved it! I didnt want it to be too sinful, so I used 10 slices of Honey Wheat bread and in the bread pudding mix 2 1/2 cups skim milk and 1/2 cup heavy cream, and in the sauce 1 cup skim milk and 1/4 cup heavy cream.

excellent, fast and easy! Everyone loved it! Didn't have whole milk for the sauce and my grandma always used canned milk in a pinch so I did too!  Used currants cause I didn't have raisins and did use 2% milk in the bread part. I read the reviews and also stirred the "pudding" about 20 minutes into the cooking, cooked it at 360 because my gas oven cooks hot and covered the last 30 minutes like it suggested. I love recipes that are not so finicky that you cant improvise! The true test of a good old fashioned recipe in my opinion! 
Was a great find!

This is my first time making bread pudding and it was lovely!  I ended up baking it for about 1.5 hours because I was scared it wasn't done because it jiggled so much in the middle.  However, once it cooled a bit, it set up perfectly and wasn't slimy at all!  It had a very nice texture that wasn't too dry or too mushy. Thanks for a great recipe!

Made this with soy vanilla milk ( not in the sauce) and smart balance and it was AMAZING!  A hit at a neighborhood gathering (which is why I had to make it lactose free).  Everyone called it bread pudding with "awesome sauce" lol....so it's a keeper! Thanks!

This recipe was delicious!   I used 2 day old baggette.  Used a few more slices then the recipe called.  Cut the bread into 1 inch slices, toasted int the oven for about 10-15 min, cubed and placed into the bowl with mixture.  Made sure all
the bread was coated well and let it soak for about 15 min. before placing in the oven.  I don't like my bread pudding mushy, I like it more crispy like my French toast. Everything else I used according to the recipe.  The vanilla sauce is heavenly, I highly suggest NOT omitting.

This is the first bread pudding I ever made.  Neither my husband or I had ever had bread pudding before- this tasted great!!  I was worried about the sauce thickening but it does after about 11 minutes of stirring.  Wonderful recipe - I followed it exactly both times I made it except used 14 toasted pieces of honey wheat bread (that's all we had in the house).

Light and moist, just the way my family likes it! Cutting the sugar back to 1 cup was just right.  I also added 1 apple, cut in chunks.  Used 1/2 loaf of stale french bread, untoasted, which was perfect amount and texture. Baked in 3 qt casserole at 350 in water bath, covered most of the time, so baking time was more like 1 1/4 hours.  Two drop-in guests who were served a bowl topped with vanilla sauce, raved about it.  Definitely a keeper!!

I made this tonight, and my kids WOW'd loud!! I made it as written in the recipe with the exception of the Vanilla sauce - I added a bit more vanilla extract based on my taste preference. Otherwise this was soft, sweet and just a lovely dessert :) Two thumbs up for this one!

It was because of so many leftover dog & burger buns that I stumbled across your recipe. I was stoked to see your own comment about using up these buns, and I followed your recipe to a tee. I have never tasted Bread Pudding so good, and even though it took my boyfriend and I 4 days to finish it up, it was excellent from start to finish!! Thanks for sharing with us!!

My family and I thought it was great.  In fact all of it was gone by the end of the night.  After reading other reviews, yes, you could probably cut down on the sugar.  But we eat desserts so infrequently, I decided to follow the recipe exactly.  It was wonderful.  Husband said it was the best he has ever had!

Deliciously sweet.  My sauce turned out a lumpy consistency, but still tasted good.  Cut back on sugar if you're not a fan of the sweets.  You can take or leave the sauce.

Didn't change a thing except to add a dollop of whipped cream to the top which made a beautiful finished product. Love it!

I have been looking for a bread pudding recipe that would take me back to my vacation in New Orleans and believe me I finally found it in this recipe. I could almost hear the jazz music playing while I ate it! I only changed the amount of white sugar in the recipe by reducing it to just under a cup because of the sweetness of the vanilla sauce. My Oh My.....was this just the best! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe, we will be making it many more times!

Delicious!  Used a loaf of Italian Bread, cubed and toasted in oven.  I changed servings to 12 and cut white sugar back to 1 cup and it was perfect.  Family loved it, will be making this over and over again!

Really easy and very good. I made a couple of changes -- only 1 cup of sugar in the bread pudding itself since many reviews say it is a little too sweet. and I added two diced pears because I needed to use them up. I used brioche, two cups of half-and-half and one cup of whipping cream. Just delicious. I made the sauce exactly as written, except I added some additional cinnamon. I will definitely make again.

This dessert made my husband very happy! I didn't use the frosting, but topped the warm pudding with really good vanilla ice cream. It was easy to make. The only problem I had was toasting the bread. As multiple slices were toasted the toaster got hotter and I had to scrape some burnt edges.

I'm surprised that there were so many comments regarding it being overly sweet.  I actually feel that it could use more sugar and more cinnamon.  A pinch of salt maybe also.  I soaked the raisins in spiced rum hoping to instill another flavor dimension, but I don't feel that it was detectable.   I used 2% milk for the sauce and it was ok, but I'm sure it would have been much richer with whole milk.  I would make this again, with the changes I mentioned.  But I'm also looking forward to trying some other bread pudding recipes.  I'm looking for one that tastes like Mom used to make.

This is a wonderful recipe. I've always loved bread pudding, but never managed to get my mom's recipe for it (she probably didn't use an actual recipe - yes, she was THAT kind of baker and great at it). This reminds me of her bread pudding.  I used a small loaf of stale French bread so probably had a bit too much bread for the amount of liquid, but the flavor is absolutely delicious. I will be making this whenever I'm hungry for bread pudding.

*I have never made bread pudding before, but this was delicious. The only alterations I made were for the bread, I used French Toast (like Texas Toast but with a maple flavor) and for some of the milk (about 1/2 cup), I used Vanilla Carmel Coffemate. We don't care for raisins so I left them out. It was amazing.

I didn't have raisins so I used chopped figs which made it way too sweet, and I reduced the sugar!  Otherwise excellent, but make sure you use a country type bread.

I followed the recipe exactly but substituted gluten free Canyon Bakehouse Hawaiian Sweet Bread and GF all purpose flour in the sauce. It was fantastic and everyone had seconds. I‚Äôm the only person that eats gluten free and everyone raved over it. I am now a believer that I can enjoy bread pudding again!

Great basic recipe!  Used one 18 inch loaf of baked French bread and 4 stale hot dog buns.  Some people toast buns and some don‚Äôt.  I don‚Äôt feel like it makes a huge difference.  Cut sugar to one cup and used 5 eggs.  Didn‚Äôt have raisins or dried fruit but would have put it in if readily available.  Turned out great!  Will make this recipe often with little twists along the way.

It was delicious. I did unfortunately make the mistake of dumping the excess liquid after spooning the bread into the pan to bake so it was a little dryer than I wanted but still very yummy. I used a loaf of Italian bread just under pound and it was perfect amount. Next time I will leave ALL liquid. I just didn‚Äôt want it to be soggy, however with that amount of bread it would have been perfect AS IS.!!! Great recipe , kids and husband loved!

This is very good.  Just watch your vanilla sauce closely so you don‚Äôt end up with more of a vanilla pudding like I did after letting it cook a bit too long.

Made twice; today with the sauce, last week w/o. Looks & smells great! (I don't have any taste buds myself) 
Everyone loved it. Went with reviews and cut the white sugar in half. Best made in an 8"x8" I believe. Today I used 2 slices less, of a farmhouse bread. I  toasted first, but also made it w/o toasting last week. Everyone enjoyed both ways.
I think you def would want to toast the bread, if not using a thicker, more substantial bread. 
I also used 1tsp cinnamon in the pudding, and a sniff of nutmeg. Awesome recipe; really suggest making this for get togethers! People will think you really worked hard!

I loved the consistency.  I toasted the bread and then dried it for a day.  I would cut the sugar next time as it was a little sweet.  I added vanilla to the pudding,  1/4 t. nutmeg and 1/2 t. fresh orange rind.  It was delicious with the layers of flavors.

We LOVED this bread pudding. We used rustic breads that had been in the freezer for a while. We even threw in some Sourdough. I was a little worried about aged and sour bread but the dish came out amazing and was gone nearly the same night my son and I made it.
We probably had more bread than 10 slices. Cooked in a cast iron skillet, the custard did not completely cover all the very top portion of bread pieces. I did make sure they were saturated with custard by dunking them down before popping in the oven. Was worried, but all for naught. The crunchy bits on top were great as a contrast to the custardy bit below. What a delicious juxtaposition. 
We served hot with the vanilla syrup a bit on the thick side,  vanilla ice cream, and a sprinkle of salt on top to balance the sweetness and add some interest. Unbelievable fabulous. This pudding is going to be on our Thanksgiving table this year!

This bread pudding was amazing and really easy to make. I used left over dinner rolls from Costco, which I cut up and let them air overnight. The consistency of the pudding was just perfect. I put the left overs of the pudding in the fridge and every morning I warm up some in the microwave and enjoy with my coffee...still delicious!!!!!

The bread pudding is really good - just like my mom used to make??.  But I must have done something wrong to the sauce, we didn‚Äôt like it. So today I remade the pudding to take to a potluck but made a family favourite sauce from water, butter, sugar, cornstarch, vanilla and nutmeg.  Will definitely be saving the pudding recipe

The pudding is very basic.
The flour in the sauce is a terrible idea. It makes the sauce look curdled. Next time, I would use corn starch or a completely different sauce recipe.

The pudding recipe was great. I did tweak by decreasing the sugar to 1 cup and using old bagels for my bread. I would definitely use this base recipe again.

The sauce, on the other hand, was a bit off-putting in appearance. It looked more like gravy. It tasted fine, but I have made better sauces and will return to those.

I made this tonight and the only changes I made were to use a fresh Italian loaf which I cubed and baked until crispy and I baked at 350 for 30 min and then covered and baked about 12 min longer in a 8x10 glass pan. It was amazingly fluffy and the vanilla sauce was sooo good!

Just as delicious as described. I used naan bread that went stale, and it worked just fine. The vanilla sauce was a great topper, but the bread pudding doesn't really need the sauce - it is sweet enough without being cloying. The sauce is just gilding the lily, which is not a bad thing! Took it to family Easter dinner and everyone loved it! Will make again for sure! Thanks for the recipe!

i made it few times. The first time I made it with dark brown sugar for the sauce and it turned out funny looking.  Then the 2nd time I made it with golden brown sugar as it suggested; it was curdle and ugly.  Now I just made it without the sauce and it was perfect.

Good recipe, but too sweet in my opinion.  It was as sweet as syrup.  Everything else was good.  I had it without the sauce.  I can't imagine how much sweeter it would be with the sauce.

It is these old-time recipes, treasured family food, that need to be shared. A time when food had to taste good, be filling,  and the ingredients simple to acquire. Cooks didn't worry about calories, and the loved ones at the table didn't either... I made this recipe 3x now, using homemade bread. The second time, trying to replicate my own grandmother's sauce, I used cherry brandy and the memories nearly overwhelmed me. My modern kids don't care for "stale bread," so I either call over a bread pudding lover, or 1/2 the recipe. Thank you so much for sharing this gift!

I have it in the oven now. I did use half n half and 2% milk as I did not have enough of either.  I used half stevia for the sugar. I added walnuts that were leftover from Christmas. I will update you on the results. I forgot, I used homemade leftover biscuits instead of other bread. That‚Äôs what my Mama, grandma and aunt always used

Delicious! I've added my own touches - I use different types of bread and pastries to make mine, so it comes out different each time.  I also don't use as much sugar and it comes out delish.

I used some day old cinnamon rolls for the bread in this recipe. The sauce was good, but a little pasty.  Next time, I might use cornstarch to thicken, instead of flour.  My husband loved this!

Best bread pudding  recipe I have found.  After reading many reviews, I did cut he sugar in half and it was still plenty sweet. I did leave out the raisins. Other than that, followed the recipe. My hubby loved it!!!! Will try  adding some peaches next time.

Made this at my husbands request as he said it was a childhood favorite.  He said it was exactly as he remembers his mother made it, and that's a very high compliment as she was an excellent cook.  I  had never tasted Bread Pudding, and just swooned at the deliciousness.  Thanks so much, Gale Coble for sharing it with the community & to your sweet Gramma for saving it.

The only tip I would add is to toast the bread for 5-10 minutes - until just before it starts to turn brown. The sauce really made this great!

Both the pudding and sauce flavors were great.  The only drawback was that the pudding didn't have any custard sauce.  It was all soaked up by the bread.  I suspect the outcome depends on how thickly the bread is sliced.  (Mine was sliced about 1" thick slices, similar to slices described as "Texas toast").  Perhaps it would be more helpful to list the total weight for the bread needed in this recipe.

The easiest and best tasting bread pudding I've ever made! I used a loaf of Challah bread- forgot to toast it but it turned out fine. I also added a pinch of nutmeg, and a heavy splash if Appleton Estate Jamaican rum to the pudding and cream sauce. I also made my rum spiked whipped cream- as I make that for all my bread puddings. Was amazing!  p.s. left out raisins... don't like cooked raisins.

I'm a novice cook.  Wouldn't know how to improve this.  I use very little cinnamon. 
Cosmetically, the pudding looks better with thicker (3/4") chunks of bread!
The recipe is basic.  A good thing!  Missing ingredients that make me NOT like other bread puddings.  
Same with the sauce. Basic and Great!
I love it!

I used Franz Bainbridge Island Cinnamon Swirl bread!

Made an easy bread pudding from a Betty Crocker cook book recipe and it went to the dogs. I made this recipe for my very picky husband and it was so delicious! He couldn't stop eating it. Hands down best pudding.

This is the best!  Don't change a thing.  I made it for my daughter's birthday.  She loves bread pudding.  I had people trying it who thought they did not like bread pudding and they loved it.

I have made this recipe many times and it is one of my favorite desserts.  Over time I have made the following changes.....Slice and coarse chop an apple.  Cook the apple in 2 tbsp of butter and a pinch of cinnamon until tender.  Add the raisins to the pan while the apples are cooking and almost done.  Add 3 tbsp of Kahlula and finish cooking the apple mixture until a thick syrup has formed.  Add the apple mixture to bread pudding recipe when it calls for raisins.

Oh my! This had the best texture I've ever had for bread pudding--crispy on the outside, and soft on the inside. Although I only used 2/3s of the recommended sugar, it was still way too sweet. Next time, I'll cut it down to a half cup. I also didn't make the sauce. Will definitely make again to use up bread crusts from the freezer.

For me, it was way too sweet and I didn't use the sauce. It was delicious so, if I make it again, I will cut the sugar in half.

After reading some of the other comments about the bread pudding being too sweet I only used half of the white sugar the recipe called for and found that it was pretty much right on for sweetness.  Instead of the vanilla sauce I made a rum sauce and it was very delicious .

Great flavor and easy to make! After following the advice of another review, I added extra bread... So mine is little too bready. I'd say follow the recipe to the letter. Overall, great recipe for a first-time bread pudding maker. Can't wait to do it again.

Just made this for the second time, hoping it turns out as good as the first!! I used a loaf of French bread cut into cubes,then toasted them lightly. I also used heavy cream in place of the milk in both the pudding and the sauce. Yum!! I used baking raisins (as they are super soft &juicy) in half. I guess now it's MY recipe! Thanks for the help. Lol

This was a great dessert for my dinner group.  It looked as pretty as it tasted.  I did make some changes so I honestly couldn't give it 5 stars.  Firstly I doubled this recipe for my dinner and baked it in an 11X14 greased baking dish.  Like the previous recipes stated CUT ALL SUGARS IN HALF.  For my doubled recipe, I used 3 cups of 4% milk and 3 cups of 1/2-1/2, 1 long skinny loaf of French bread sliced, toasted and cut into cubes to equal 7-8 cups of cubed bread, 1 apple sliced and about 3/4 c. Craisins.  Cover dish for 30 minutes and uncovered for 30 minutes.  Push down bread to cover in 'juice' the last 10 minutes or so.  It came out great.  It was served warm with the Vanilla Sauce on top.  I had trouble getting the sauce to thicken without curdling.  Cutting the sauce recipe back would be advised...it made a lot.   I think instead of the sauce serve with whip cream or even vanilla ice cream and it would be just as delicious.  The pudding was also good as leftovers cold from the refrigerator.

Definitely would make again. I substituted 2 cans of evaporated milk for the whole milk for the bread pudding, added 2 handfuls of golden rain sins and sprinkled in a cup of chopped pecans. For the vanilla I used almond milk instead of whole milk  and 2 tablespoons of cornstarch instead of flour.  It turned out great. The bread pudding had a richness to it and the added raisins and chopped pecans gave it a moistness and crunchiness to the bread pudding. The vanilla sauce was terrific with the almond milk. I will make these recipe changes and this will be my Christmas dinner dessert. May add a tablespoon or two of light rum to the sauce for a special Christmas dessert.

I grew up in a Cornish mining town in South west Wisconsin.  We grew up with Cornish pasty, tea biscuits and bread pudding.  This bread pudding is fantastic.  I made it with raisins and it was delicious.

An excellent recipe! I've made bread pudding for years, and I'm always checking out other recipes to see what I can borrow or learn to do differently. 

For this, I used just a little less sugar simply because we don't care for things too sweet, but that's a preference, not a problem with the recipe. Especially with the sauce, taste test and find how much sugar you want to add. I always go lighter on the sweetness with the pudding and let the sauce give the added touch. You could add more cinnamon and/or a touch of nutmeg if you want a little more zip, but this is actually quite good all on its own.

I used french bread, but you could use anything you have around. Bread pudding is an excellent thing to make to use up extras and cost-reduced items. I've even used extra loaves of spice bread that fell apart when a kiddo made them to great success. A good recipe lets you experiment!

I changed almost all the portions to my liking which included reducing the white sugar to 3/4 cup, reducing the milk to 2 1/4 cups, raisins to 3/4 cup  which was still plenty and I love raisins, increased the cinnamon to 1 1/2 teaspoons; I used high quality cinnamon.  I also used challah bread with the crust, roughly 1/3 of a loaf which I cut in rough cubes and baked in the oven while it was preheating to dry it out a bit, maybe ten minutes and results were perfect.   I added a tsp of vanilla extract.  I used the amounts of light brown sugar, butter and eggs as listed.  Don't be afraid to follow your instincts when making bread pudding; it's all about personal preference.

I microwaved the liquid with the raisins in the liquid for 60 seconds before pouring it on the bread.  I covered it  as recommended and prepared in a convection oven at 325 degrees for 50 minutes.  I didn't use the sauce as the pudding was still very sweet to me.

I had never made bread pudding before this, but this was SO delicious and easy to make! Bread pudding is actually one of my dad's favorite desserts, and he said it was one of the best ones he's had in his life. (And he's very honest about these type of things- good or bad) The bread pudding was so good by itself that I wasn't sure if it needed the sauce, but the sauce totally elevated it to another level of deliciousness! This recipe is perfect, nothing needs to be changed.

This is now my go-to bread pudding recipe.  I cut up an entire baguette and let it soak in the liquid mixture for 30 minutes before baking, to let the crust soften.  I also added 1 tsp. vanilla to the bread mixture  and cut the sugar to 1 cup, so it tasted just as sweet without as much sugar.

Indeed the best bread pudding ever! I made it exactly as written, except added 1/2 tsp nutmeg to pudding and a dash to the sauce. I omitted the raisins because none of us likes raisins...it was the best bread pudding we have ever had. Very easy. My fiance and son loved it and my fiance had me make it twice this week. Thanks for the recipe.

I used stale cinnamon raisin bagels (untoasted) in place of the bread which was wonderful. The vanilla sauce is certainly worth making.  This was my second time making it. Go to recipe!

This was amazing! Definitely a great way to use up extra buns. I toasted them and added a few extra and it turned out perfect. Not too mushy and not too dry.  I also added a little less sugar as other reviewers suggested. I only used 3/4 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar for the bread. I didn't mess with the sauce recipe and I'm glad I didn't, it was delicious! The only other addition was 1/4 cup of raisins that I soaked in brandy. Thanks for a great recipe.

I made this sans raisins. My mom made homemade cinnamon rolls (yes they were already frosted) that failed to rise so she gave them to me and said what can you do with these? I had about 10 cinnamon rolls to use. I found this recipe and made this instead. I subbed softened (not melted, just softened a smidge) chocolate chips for the raisins. The cinnamon rolls already had enough cinnamon so I didn't add extra. I left the rolls out overnight uncovered to stale, chopped them up into bite size pieces, stirred in the softened chocolate chips, poured in the liquid, stirred again, and soaked it all for 30 minutes in the liquid mixture. Baked it in a greased oval baker. Topped it with the vanilla sauce. Fantastic! Took it to work and people loved it. It was gone within 20 minutes! They keep asking me to make it again. Thanks for the great recipe!!

I have made this many times exactly as written, excellent! I have made changes, not that it needs it, but for variety. I have added pecans, dried cranberries,  dried apricots. And  I use whatever milk I have, sometimes half & half with 2%, sometimes heavy whipping cream mixed with 2%, it's all good, some more rich than others, but all have been great!  Other note: I make potato rolls often and leftovers make the best bread pudding.

Very easy to make. I used brioche for the bread. After I poured the vanilla sauce, I garnished with blueberries and raspberries! It was hit! I love bread pudding and this recipe is one of the best I've tried. Will definitely do this again!

I used leftover hotdog and hamburger buns, lightly toasted in the oven on low broil like southern grandma recommended. I also used about half heavy whipping cream and half whole milk. I added much more cinnamon and raisins too. Recipe is user friendly and delicious!!! This was my very first time making bread pudding.

I made this for the first time at Thanksgiving and everyone loved it, I am making it again today.. I used a whole stick of butter in mine and I cut the white sugar and used only a cup. Today I added a teaspoon of vanilla just to give it that nice flavor

This is a fantastic recipe that was THE FAVORITE at our annual Thanksgiving Eve Dessert Party. I skipped the vanilla topping and served it with a Praline Sauce from another bread pudding recipe on this site. Anytime I'm using dried fruit in a recipe I plump it in either hot water or alcohol. I used red wine on the raisins in this recipe which makes just enough of a difference that it is worth going the extra mile. I also make my own bread in my bread maker (Milk Bread recipe) & I saved my heels in the freezer for months knowing I would use them for bread pudding at Thanksgiving. I really do believe that what bread you use makes the difference, a high quality or homemade bread will make a MUCH better pudding than your average loaf of sandwich bread. This recipe is a keeper!

I let the bread pudding  sit in fridge for 2 hours, covered with Saran wrap, then cooked un- wrapped. I added a homemade whipped cream made with vanilla powder added while the bread pudding and vanilla sauce was still hot... Very good.

I was getting ready to throw out about a dozen rolls from Texas Road house and thought "bread pudding"!  This is the first time I've made it and it is DELISH!!!!  I did cut the sugar back to 3/4c based on other reviews and it is plenty sweet for me!  I didn't make the sauce  and I've gotta say I don't miss it!  
I had to use some hamburger rolls (burned some of the rolls when toasting) and it is really tasty!!

I really liked this recipe.  Hard to believe I'd never made bread pudding before because I've always liked it, but I never had.  I didn't want to deviate from the recipe but I didn't have the correct bread so I used a loaf of cinnamon swirl pepperidge farms bread and it worked perfectly! The sauce was a bit grainy but I'm chalking that up to user error...the taste was still very good!  I think this will be our new Christmas morning tradition!

I'm a pretty good home cook, but I have never tried to make bread pudding, which was one of my mom's specialties. Today, using this recipe, I made bread pudding my mom would have been proud of! This is a perfect recipe, I wouldn't change a thing.

Delicious! Moist and the vanilla sauce was heavenly. I substituted a can of apple filling instead of raisins, other than that,  I followed the recipe to the "T". Complete comfort food on a cold winter night.

I made this for our Thanksgiving meal today‚Ä¶.and it was a big hit with all 13 people who tried it!   I will definitely make it again.   It seemed to have too many raisins, so I left out almost half of them.  I made a double batch in a 9 X 13 pan.   It was very rich and light‚Ä¶.and the sauce is wonderful!

My review is for the vanilla sauce as I needed something to go with a french toast souffle recipe I had already made. I used 1/2 & 1/2 to make the sauce richer and Wondra flour to eliminate lumps, but otherwise followed the sauce recipe. The sauce came out a little thick but was amazingly delicious! Will definitely be adding the sauce to my repertoire, thanks!

I made a couple of changes. I cut the sugar down to 1cup and added a pinch of salt and vanilla to the bread pudding. It was plenty sweet enough. I made the vanilla sauce as is. This was the best Bread Pudding I have found so far to make. Everyone raved. ??

Was delicious!!! I only had American bread and used a bundt pan.  My sauce came a little thick and used dark brown sugar that's all I had. So I glazed the bread pudding cake.  The recipe was easy and forgiving. Thank you for sharing.

This is soooo good! I did reduce the sugar a little and added vanilla to the bread pudding just because of my personal tastes. This recipe is definitely gold and will be repeated frequently. My daughters also loved it!

Fan-Tastic!! The only changes I made was using golden raisins and adding a half of a shooter of rum to the sauce while it was cooking. This was a hit with the whole family!

Wow. Very good. Will definitely add this to my personal recipe box. Not the online one, but my actual one. Thank you!  I did not have whole milk and used a combination of evaporated, 2%, and whipping cream. It was spectacular!

This was the hit after dinner tonight! Followed the recipe except I used dried wild blueberries instead of raisins (don't care for them) and it was perfect with the blueberry flavor. Everyone agreed that this will be on the menu again!

Great bread pudding. I omitted the raisins & added 2 mashed bananas to the mix before adding the bread. Turned out great.

Very good recipe.  For personal preference, I'll cut sugar back to apx 3/4 cup (especially if we have the sauce).  I used hamburger rolls, and next time I'll use a shallow pan to increase the crispy too.   :).

I increased the protein, reduced the net carbs, increased the nutritional value and enhanced the flavor with the following changes.  First, I replaced the milk with tasty Silk SoyNog (a seasonal product that tastes like eggnog, but is made with soy milk instead of eggs).  Then I used Nature's Own 100% whole wheat bread, which is a soft fluffy whole wheat bread.  I used 14 slices, cut into 18 cubes each, then toasted the cubes on the slotted broiler pan in my countertop Breville oven.  I omitted both the white sugar and the brown sugar completely from the pudding (because the SoyNog contains sugar), reduced the raisins to 1/8 cup and added 3/4 cup of fresh blueberries.  I also increased the cinnamon to one teaspoon.  The only changes that I made to the vanilla sauce was to replace the milk with SoyNog, and replace 1/2 of the vanilla seasoning with orange extract, so 1/2 Tablespoon each of vanilla and orange extract.  I later added some 1% milk to thin the sauce as it thickened while cooking.  Absolutely delicious!

This is a great recipe! I used a fresh bread not a sandwich bread. It took a little longer to cut into cubes. I made the sauce and my boyfriend said I could put that sauce on dog poop and it would be great! I will make it again!

This was great!  I used the hearty farmhouse style bread by Pepperidge Farm just as directed.  The bread was fresh so after cutting it into the cubes I baked the cubes for 20 minutes in a 200 degree oven.  I used a large casserole dish instead of a pan.  I baked it uncovered for 30 minutes and then put the glass cover on for the last 25 minutes.  Perfect! I agree that it was a little too sweet so the next time I will cut back on the sugar.  I also used 1 teaspoon of vanilla plus 1 tablespoon of Bacardi Rum in the sauce. Fab!  I will be serving this on Christmas eve.

I made this recipe for dessert on Christmas Eve last year and everyone loved it. No leftovers. This is the best bread pudding recipe I ever made. I plan to make it again this Christmas Eve. I made it exactly as directed, except I omitted the raisins because my family does not like raisins.

This is the first time I tried to make bread pudding and it turned out great!  The vanilla sauce made way too much however, so I am thinking of only halving the recipe next time, but half an egg?  Great use for leftover baguette that we alway seem to have.

This is super yummy!  My husband loves bread pudding and he said this was the BEST one he has ever had (I've tried a few other recipes online). I diid not add the vanilla sauce because it was a bit too sweet (you can always cut back on the sugar), but it was still super delish without the sauce. Best served warm. Thank you so much!

I made this in January 2014. I don't know why I didn't review it then. Although way too sweet for my taste, it is delicious. In spite of protests from my son, I will greatly reduce the sugar when I make it this week.

My 2 quart baking dish was not big enough! It drooped over the sides and made a mess in my oven. Put a cookie sheet under it, or use a bigger dish. Otherwise, a good recipe.

Love this recipe, I used leftover cinnamon crunch and blueberry bagels. I had enough bagels to make two recipes, one to serve, one for the freezer! Served with the Vanilla Sauce and my guest were impressed!   Thanks for sharing!

Very good recipe. I'd never made bread pudding before. I used home made white bread heels and guestimated the amount I needed, believe it or not, it came out perfect. I was a little short on milk so I opened a can of evaporated milk and subst. 2 cups. Only thing is I would probably boil the raisins or soak them in hot water before adding them, they were a little chewy. But, whatever you do, be conservative when serving this stuff, it is very, very rich and a little is plenty unless you are really craving sweets! :)

Make it more healthy without losing the taste!  I did some experimenting and it turned out GREAT!  First, I used 100% whole wheat sliced bread (I actually liked this better than the white bread I used last time, and I generally hate whole wheat bread).  I used skim milk instead of whole milk or cream.  I decreased the eggs by one to keep it from being "eggy".  I used smart balance butter blend instead of regular butter.  I used half brown sugar and half white sugar (not healthier, but yummier).  I am going to try it with partially splenda to make it even healthier next time.  I think one thing that made up for the lower fat was extra flavor-  one teaspoon cinnamon plus one teaspoon nutmeg and 2 teaspoons vanilla (double the amount called for in the recipe).  I am a sweets junky, the fattier and sugary-er the better, so I can't believe how much I like this!  Please try it!

I've made this once exactly as the recipe stated except for increasing the cinnamon(personal taste). I used my homemade bread, which is 100% whole wheat. The outcome was very good, but I wouldn't rave about it because I thought it was a bit bland, surprising since so many reviewers said it was too sweet. It may depend a lot on what bread you use. With homemade wheat bread, you may want to increase the sugar. The sauce was excellent. I very much enjoyed it with the sauce!

made this recipe, added cinnamon and a bit of all-spice. I also snuck in about a cup of diced skinned and cored ambrosia apples. I did have to substitute about 1/4 cup of brown sugar for 1/4 cup of sugar, as i ran out of regular. I used some very flakey dinner rolls from HEB shredded into tons of flat pieces. After using 2 egg yolks versus 1 egg, and about double the vanilla, the creme' came out beautifully.  just like you'd expect from a great texas BBQ smoke house. my wife LOVES raisins, so i added a handful of raisins to the creme topping, and let them soften up. I cooked the bread pudding for approximately 65 minutes at 365 degrees F. i'll definitely be doing this at my next smoked brisket event. need to find a good peach cobbler recipe to go along with it!!

Great recipe!  Much better than my grandmother's. I was looking for a recipe to use up some things in my cabinets.  This was perfect.  I made the base recipe exactly as written with a couple of exceptions.  I had no raisins so I substituted Cran-raisins.  I threw in some pecans.  I made the vanilla sauce with mostly heavy cream (something else I didn't want to throw out).  I used sour dough bread.  Yum!

I love bread pudding although I never made it myself. I read several comments and made some notes and I will be making it for this Sunday's dinner... I like the idea of using apples, peaches, or even chocolate chips.  can't wait for Sunday.. thank you for this recipe

This was easy the best bread pudding I've ever eaten, after a few minor adjustments.  I decreased the sugar to 1/2 c and used 1 1/2 c Half n Half plus 1 1/2 c water in place of 3 c milk.  I also used sweetened  whip cream in place of the sauce to cut the richness and the calories.  It was really good and not too sweet.

Bread pudding as good as my mom's. Maybe even better and that is saying alot. I substituted peaches for the raisins and it turned out great. A comfort food that really pleases. The sauce was especially good. The pudding is also good served warm and topped with vanilla ice cream. YUM YUM

This was very good, nutricious and delicious. I followed the recipe exactly, but used a little less sugar. This makes a great breakfast. Definitely will try this again, playing with other dried fruits.

Delicious! First time making bread pudding, though I love it. Recipe was easy, clear, and accurate. Made it for family who had it at a restaurant for first time and loved it. Was told that this recipe was many times better than the restaurant. Good flavor without being sickeningly sweet. Did add a splash more cinnamon to both pudding and vanilla sauce, but we love cinnamon.

Fantastic!!!! I followed the recipe almost exactly, may have used a few extra raisons‚Ä¶used a 9 by 13 inch pan. It is so good that I can't wait to make it again and also add pecans.

I have made this recipe about 15 times now and it's my go-to recipe for bread pudding. I've made it with everything from hamburger buns, baguettes, farmhouse bread, etc...a soft but dense bread is the best kind to use but anything will work in a pinch. The only thing I change is that I increase the mixture by half as I find it's a bit dry otherwise. I also double the vanilla sauce because everyone always loves it so much. Wonderful recipe.

I absolutely loved this recipe. Used some day old homemade bread and a few slices of whole wheat sandwich bread too! I had never made bread pudding before, and this was super easy and really yummy! We don't like raisins here, so I substituted 1C  milk chocolate chips!

Used old cinnamon swirl bread and other than cutting back on the sugar and using golden raisins instead of regular, this was on point. Used a whiskey vanilla sauce for the topping! Very yummy and my new go to

I wanted to make this as-is, but out of consideration for the diabetics in my family, I cut back on the white sugar and left out the vanilla sauce.  Yummers!  Best I've ever had, even without the added sweetening.  I made mine with half of an egg bread I had left over.  So good!

I gave this 4 stars because the bread pudding was delicious but the vanilla sauce, not so much. It was way too thick and goopy and kind of tasted like paste. I will definitely will be making this again but serving it with caramel sauce instead.

This was my first time baking. The bread pudding turned out wonderful! I need to work on the vanilla sauce, but my family couldn't get enough. The video and written instructions was very easy to follow. This is a 10 on my chart!!!

Best bread pudding is an understatement. Super easy, super YUM!  No leftovers, pair it with icecream, delish!! I used regular white bread, 5 slices. & used a 3 qt pan for length, but the pudding wasn't tall, so I should've used a 2 qt. THANK YOU so much for this recipe!!!!! amazing

Delicious!!I have made this multiple times and it never fails to please. The last time I made this was Mother's Day and I accidentally omitted the white sugar, but even with only the 2 tablespoons of brown sugar and the vanilla sauce it was delicious! I plan on making this again and again! Great recipe!

This recipe makes the best bread pudding I've ever had. I make it with French bread and half-and-half, and add a little vanilla to the pudding. It's perfectly light, creamy, and sweet. An absolutely classic dessert.

Just the bread pudding I was looking for!  I reduced the recipe for four and I used a half loaf of stale Italian bread.  My sauce tasted good but it broke.  I used it anyway and no one was the wiser.  Great with a cup of coffee and good conversation!  Don't hesitate to try this one.

Great recipe. Altered a little bit. I added one 14 oz can of lite coconut milk , one cup of toasted coconut flakes and a cup of chocolate chips. Cut the sugar to 1 cup and used toasted challah bread.  There is more sugar in the coconut milk and bread. I also let the custard soak into the bread for 5 mins. Came out great!

Didn't change a thing! My entire family loved both the pudding and the sauce.  I used a loaf of Homestyle White Bread from the Giant Eagle Bakery and sliced off both ends.  (Then sliced, toasted and cubed the remaining loaf per the recipe.)

Made it exactly to recipe and it was fantastic. The best bread pudding I've ever had and the sauce was delicious even if mine didn't have a perfect glossy texture. That was probably due to me not whisking diligently enough though. If I had to change anything I would add a little less sugar because this was incredibly rich and would probably be too much for some people. Overall this was a solid recipe that my boyfriend and I loved and one that I will make again.

This was a great recipe! I normally make bourbon bread pudding but my dinner guests last night don't consume any alcohol (even if it's cooked) so I scrambled to find a bread pudding without rum or bourbon! This had all the great flavors I love of bread pudding and more! The vanilla sauce really gives it the flavor profile that makes it different than any other. I didn't cover it at all because I like my bread to be really crispy on top and the sauce softened up any of the over cooked spots!

This is my go to recipe and I make bread pudding several times a month as it is always requested!  I add raisins or chocolate chips or nothing at all.  The best results have been from leftover hot dog buns.  I skip the sauce, not needed.

Love it.. the whole family loved it, even the ones that are not crazy about bread pudding. I used a french loaf for the bread. I cut it into slices over 1.5" thick, and toasted it. Perfect! Thanks for sharing your family recipe.

Made this today, it was wonderful! I used half of a day old loaf of french bread. Followed the recipe exactly (minus raisins). Cooked it in a 3 qt glass casserole dish. It was so good, my boys came back for seconds, as did I. I will definitely make this again.

I'm lactose intolerant and used Silk vanilla soy milk instead of whole milk. It was fabulous! Also prepped the dish ahead of time for easy baking later. I hadn't planned it this way but it gave the french bread time to soak up the yummy cream before baking.

Just made this tonight and it was YUMMY!! Sauce was really good too. Came out perfect! I used chocolate chips instead of raisins since I had no raisins in the house. Plus, chocolate chips go over better in my house than raisins. But I will say, I prefer raisins in my bread pudding. It was really yummy though!! thanks for the recipe!
