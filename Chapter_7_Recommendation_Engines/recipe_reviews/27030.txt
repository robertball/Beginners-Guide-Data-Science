I have been using this recipe for 3 years now. DELICIOUS and MOIST and comes out tall!!! I do not use coffee cans, but a Tube Pan (much like a bundt pan, but the center is removable from the base). I cook it at the same temperature and same time. A Nice Touch! I brush egg whites on the top of the Babka after te first process of "baking for 15 minutes @400 Degrees"...AND after a while I do notice it turning brown, I then cover it w/foil. It has turned out perfect each time!~..2 LARGE/TALL Babkas every year  (very moist!) for the past 3 years!

I made this recipe because I have been trying to find the perfect PASKA recipe. This is just as I remember and love. Breakfast this week has been divine with toasted babka. Thank you so much I can't wait to start baking them for Easter! I also made the dough in my bread machine then baked in the oven, 1/2 the recipe fit in my machine, and baked in a 2 lb can.

I didn't have my (Polish) grandmother's recipe on hand, but this worked perfectly.  It tasted just as like Babcia's!
Helpful Hint:  you may want to fill the loaves with lekvar.

This was a great recipe. I did cut the recipe in half. Used 1 cup dried raisins mixed with cranberries. Turned out better with the cranberries the second time. I also used my bread machine, but hand folded the raisins/ cranberries. The first time I used only the raisins and tossed them into the bread machine. Didn't turn out so good. The raisins were all torn apart. I also noticed that once you fold the raisins/cranberries in, the rise before you bake takes almost all day. Without the raisins/cranberries it takes only 2 hours for it to rise. I made half the dough without the raisins/cranberries and then half with.  Make sure you let the dough rise in a butter spread pan before you bake. I warm my oven for a few minutes and then turn it off and let the dough rise in a warm area. After its done baking I spread lightly in mixer: first 1 egg white until fluffy then add powdered sugar until thick. Spread it on the warm bread as soon as itâ€™s done baking and let it dry. Can also sprinkle the top with sprinkles before it dries.

I was so disappointed in this recipe. It turned out awful for me. I was so hopeful and followed it to the "t" but was greatly disappointed.

I have used this recipe for years. It always turns out well and tastes great. It is not too sweet so can be used in combination with sweet or savory dishes. I love it and so does my family.

not sure how to rate, i'm not a bread maker by any means.  i may have cooked this too long?  a little dry, but it does taste almost EXACTLY like my mother in laws.  i didn't use the raisins because i don't like them in bread.  i will make again, for my Dad and use the raisins.

It was a little drier than my Mom made. I think my oven cooks a little hotter because it's propane. I will cut the time down when I make it next time. The flavor was perfect and all the babki I gave as Christmas gifts were really appreciated. I received many compliments. Min was probably dry because I took the one that had the brownes crust. I'll never use a metal pan again.
