I too typically do not like fish (especially baked) and saw this on sale at the store & had never heard of it. I Googled it, read it had good reviews as a mild white fish, so I went ahead and got it. Found this recipe and used the sauce and I really like it as well as the rest of my family. Would highly recommend! Served with Hasselback potatoes, green beans & wild rice.

I came across this type of fish in the grocery store today and what caught my eye was that I had never heard of it and it was "Wild caught". I never by farm raised fish and lately thats all I have been seeing as well as color added to salmon?? So with that being said, I made a few changes. I hate cilantro. I hate the smell of it and the taste. Its just nasty to me. So instead of cilantro I used dill. I love the smell of dill and taste. I usually use dill with any fish I bake in the oven anyway. And instead of one tablespoon of lemon juice I used juice from a whole lemon, without measuring I chopped up a nice size clove of fresh garlic, instead of paprika I used a nice dash of red cayenne pepper, organic garlic powder, salt and pepper and used real butter instead of margarine. And I totally ditched the white wine. And as I was heating the mixture in the sauce pan, I gave it a little taste and it was so yummy. I actually am a fan of the fish too. Nice, light and wild caught in the US....doesnt get any better than that. And YES! I would soooo make this again! YUM!

housewife628.....if your fish monger told you it was US caught, I would not go back to him in the future.  Swai is native to the rivers of SE Asia.  Almost all of what you buy in the supermarkets are either frozen or previous frozen and farm raised. It might have been caught by a US citizen but he was in the Mekong Delta when he caught it.

This recipe is very good and have used it for the past 6-7 yrs with either Swai or Basa. I add 3 tbl of oleo and 2 tbl of cilanto when cooking.  Also great on the grill or deep fried after dredding in egg wash and 'Dixie Fry' seasoning mix.
6/27/04 - I am now just frying Swai with no egg wash.  Just adding a little Accent and paprika to the Dixie Fry Seasoning Mix. Swai does not shrink at all when frying and actually looks like it plumps up during frying.  With fish so expensive now this is a great buy.  Bought 4 lbs bag on sale last week at the supermarket for $9.99 per bag.  Cheaper than ground beef, for sure.  I would buy some more Basa but it seems to have disappeared from the supermarkets completely.

I changed very few things overall. Instead of cilantro I used dill and and cut back a lot on the garlic even though I love it. Used 9x13 Pyrex dish and Olive oil spray. Placed the fish on top of lemon slices so it wouldn't stick. I warmed the butter, chicken broth (not wine) and seasonings in the microwave at 30 second intervals stirring often. Poured this directly on the fish and since our fillets were quite thick they took about 20 min to bake at 350. Superb flavor. Even the 18 month old ate every last bit and asked for seconds. I also made a delicious risotto type of side dish using quinoa, mushrooms, spinach, Parmesan and some seasonings. I used thyme in the side dish and worried it would clash with the thyme but it was fine. Great recipe!

I used the allrecipes phone app when in the grocery store and saw Swai fish and had no idea how to cook it.  I made this recipe for dinner tonight as the ingredients are commonly stocked in my home.  Everyone loved this!  I served it with steamed green beans and some quinoa.  To make extra sauce to put on rice or quinoa, double it.  I used butter instead of margarine. This recipe is saved to my recipe box now and I'll make it again!

I am not a fan of fish by any means. My experience with seafood usually expands to about fish sticks, and not much more. but i came across swai in the store and it intrigued me. not being a seafood eater, i was intrigued, and since it was on sale i figured why not? I made a few changes - no white wine, extra lemon, extra garlic, and i added some garlic and onion powder directly to the fish. I have to say, I was complete BLOWN AWAY. This recipe was AMAZING! I will defiantly be making it again! I was so grateful I had leftovers to freeze for lunch during the week! (Not sure if it will make it though the weekend though because it really was that awesome).

I made it exactly as is and liked it overall, but something was really spicy, the fresh garlic maybe? It seemed  to overpower everything else. I will try this again, but think I will try garlic powder instead of minced fresh garlic.

I thought this sauce was very good and you could pour it over just about any fish and it would taste good. A note about Swai for those who are wondering about this fish. This was on sale for $5.88 for a 2lb bag of frozen fillets so I thought I would give it a try. I came home and Googled it and frankly, I was kind of scared as there is some pretty non flattering info about this fish. People who don't like fish like this one because it doesn't taste like fish, in fact I had a hard time deciding if it tasted like anything at all? So yes, it is very mild and  be prepared for a slightly mushy texture. I might buy it again because it is very inexpensive and my boys  liked it. I honestly haven't decided but I would definitely use this simple lemon, butter(yes, butter, I never use margarine) sauce on any fish with the same good results.  Hope this is helpful and oh, if you are a cilantro hater chop up some italian parsley in its place.

It was wonderful. My whole family loved it. I have one that won't eat fish of any kind and he liked it. I make sure they all taste things at least once.

This was a really nice way to eat fish. I do not enjoy eating fish but try to work it in when I can as I become more health conscious. This marinade made the fish very easy to eat which is a plus in my book. 4 stars is the highest I could bring myself to give any fish recipe so it is high praise! I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of mixing in the paprika rather than sprinkling on. Aesthetically it would have looked better sprinkled I suppose but taste wise didn't make much difference. This will be a go-to when I "need" to eat my fish :)

I buy as much Swai (Pangasius) as I can get at Trader Joe's...we got sick of tilapia, which sold in bags of small fillets for a high price at box grocery store. Swai comes in frozen fillets of about 8" long and a good .5" thick. It cooks up quickly, has a gentle flavor that goes with EVERYTHING you season/dress it with, and best of all, has a wonderful 'chew'. Very satisfying.

This (recipe) is a wonderful way to cook this fish (hadn't tried it w/ cilantro!)...5+! Also try it baked with a panko-parmesean-garlic powder-lemon pepper treatment...killer. A very versatile fish!

Hot with that amount of pepper. My son who adds hot sauce to everything loves this fish just the way it is. Those of us who like things less spicy need half the suggested amount of pepper at most.

I omitted the wine because we don't usually like meals cooked with it & I was planning to let my baby eat some.  I also reduced the black pepper a bit because I'm not a big fan.  We cooked it in our NuWave oven, but that wouldn't alter the flavor any, just the cooking time.  I've always hated fish, but have been trying to find some that I like lately & this one was the best so far & I didn't have to drown it in soy sauce to make it taste good.  It didn't taste fishy at all.  I barely even knew I was eating fish.  We loved it so much, we had to make more while we were eating it & then made more to have as leftovers for lunch tomorrow.  Our 13 month old gobbled it up too.  We will definitely be making this again.  I would have given this 5 stars, but I know I wouldn't have given it 5 stars if I had made it with the white wine.

I did not care for this recipe. Too salty, too peppery... Covers the sweet taste of swai too much.

My husband really liked this recipe.  I didn't, but I'm not a fan of fish!  But I'm trying!  So if your fond of fish, swai is a nice firm fish bakes, and steams well.

This is a lot like a skillet cod with cilantro butter recipe that I make only difference is lemon instead of lime.  I probably would not do it in the oven again as it is too easy to overcook and will stick to the skillet.  However, the flavor is great - I placed sliced lemons on top of the filets after I poured the butter/garlic mixture on top.  Salt and peppered the filets then sprinkled with the cilantro and a little paprika for color.

Too spicy: cut pepper in half at least.  Rest of the flavor is great.  I want to try it over other types of fish.  Oh, and line 9x13 with foil then spray foil with Pam (or similar).  Easy clean up and no sticking!

Hubby, son and I all liked it. I would put more cilantro in next time. I used more garlic and I also would consider cayenne pepper in place of paprika for a little more zip.

Because they contain GMOs and unhealthy additives, I used olive oil in bottom of dish instead of cooking spray. Reduced the salt and black pepper, and increased garlic. Other ingredient changes were only because I didn't have everything on hand. Replaced white wine with Corona (ha!), used cayenne (sparingly) instead of paprika. Baked for about 18 minutes then broiled for a few extra minutes. This is a very light, flavorful dish. Will definitely make this again!

350 degrees doesn't begin to get this done in 10-12 minutes. Maybe it should be 10-12 minutes at 450, or 30-40 minutes at 350. I finally got it right by turning up the oven and baking some more. This was delicious though, and I'd serve it again with the time & temperature adjusted. I was out of white wine too, but it was just fine without it. I just upped the amount of butter and lemon juice.

We've never had Swai fish before & didn't know what to expect. We really liked it cause it was very light & had a nice taste. I did use others suggestion & cut back on the lemon juice because I like lemon, but it doesn't like me. I also just put a dash of salt/pepper on the fish. We didn't have any cilantro so will try that next time since it was optional. I was curious about the margarine because some used butter, but I stuck to the margarine. Will make again for sure.

I have made this twice now and both times it was great. I know folks don't like others posting with substitutes but I had Rock fish, couldn't find anything for that fish and this recipe looked like it would work.  Also used Italian parsley in place of the cilantro...personal preference..kept everything else the same.  Everyone raved about the fish so this is a keeper  for any white fish.  Enjoy!

Made this tonight and it was very easy. Closest white wine I had was white zinfandel, but I have used it before in a pinch. Also, the butter I had was unsalted butter... I don't care much for cilantro so I didn't use it. Flavor was good, but still needed a little something  (maybe cause of unsalted butter) so I sprinkled some Curts season salt on my fillets, my wife used tarter sauce. Overall I give it 5 stars because swai fillets are super cheap and larger than tilapia. There was no fishy smell even when they were raw, and no fishy taste whatsoever once they were cooked. Took a gamble on these fillets and it payed off big time!

I made this exactly according to the recipe, with the exception of a teaspoon of dried dill instead of cilantro. Absolute perfection! Fish was so flavorful and light. I normally don't rate recipes but this one is definitely a keeper. Thanks for sharing :)

Moist and delicious. Might try Old Bay instead of paprika next time. Super easy to play around with, but very good as is.

It was great! I used tarragon instead of cilantro, and I baked it for 20 minutes instead of 12. It came out really tender and tasty!

This was good, but not great. I would make it again, would probably add cayenne pepper for more spice.

This fish has a magical quality that allows its flesh to become flavored with darn near anything that a creative cook might want to add, whether it's pan seared, baked or broiled or used in stews or soups. My dinner companion simply fell in love with the swai fillets that I wok seared along with a few shrimp and a medley of aromatics and colorful sweet peppers. Do not overcook! :)

I added extra lemon and used butter rather than margarine. I also sub. dill for the cilantro. Prep was the same though and I thought it was very easy and tasty too (extra cooking time for mine).

really good with risotto made with white wine, mushrooms and cilantro.  Only thing that I think it could use is that the cilantro would be better raw with the fish.  So make up the sauce and then just prior to serving sprinkle with the chopped cilantro

Very tasty and EASY to make! I used red wine instead of white and it was perfect. The smell of simmering garlic and red wine is heavenly! I served this with rice pilaf and green beans.

This had good flavor, but pretty salty.  I will make again but next time I will use only half the salt. or omit it altogether. Also, it is a very wet fish, so if you put it on some paper towels and press until most of the moisture is out, that will help.

Instead of baking, I brushed the sauce on the fillets which I then grilled on a cedar plank. Turned out delicious and we will definitely use this recipe again. My wife said this was her new favorite fish!

First encounter with swai and I am favorably impressed.  Need to pre-thaw and drain the fillets before starting.  I baked at 375 for 15 minutes and it was very good.  Served with marinated cherry tomatoes and rice/quinoa mixture.

Excellent recipe. I subbed butter for margarine and added cayenne and Old Bay to the sauce. Cooked in a baking dish lined with foil and splashed with olive oil. As with all baked fish, you've got to be vigilant about checking to be sure not to over or under cook. My swai wasn't too thick and took 10 minutes.

Did not taste fishy. Used a little less wine and more lemon. Added fresh cilantro. Butter instead of margarine.

This recipe is delicious! My whole family enjoyed this. Even my picky 11yr old. I do feel it needed more flavor so, next time, I will increase the amount of lemon, garlic and seasonings.

I made this last night and my family LOVED it! We aren't big fish eaters. Gorton's fish sticks usually is as fishy as we get. We are trying to eat healthier, and on impulse grabbed a bag of wild-caught Pacific Whiting. I've no idea what kind of fish that is, but this recipe was perfect for it! The only thing I did different was another reviewer suggestion of slicing a lemon and putting it on the bottom of the dish and laying the fish on top of that so it didn't stick to the pan. I'm not sure that it would have stuck anyway, given I doubled the sauce. The sliced lemon did serve the purpose keeping the fish from being soaked in the sauce (since my doubling actually made too much... Oops!). I ended up having to bake this fish for 20 minutes, and bumped the temp up to 400 degrees halfway through baking. 

Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

I have made this a few times substituting tequila for white wine and lime juice for lemon juice, which is also good. It was AMAZING prepared that way and served with a mango salsa found here on Allrecipes!

I didn't have all the ingredients, and I used margarine because I'm lactose intolerant, but the general idea was used (though I heated up my "sauce" in the microwave), and it came out great. I especially love that it only took like 20 minutes (including prep, baking, and cleanup).
I eat swai a lot, but had never baked it before, and now that I have, I prefer it  this way to frying it.

I thought this dish was way too salty and I didn’t have any cilantro.  I used Old bay instead of paprika. I would try again but less pepper and salt, more garlic. I think the cilantro would have helped the flavor. Something was missing.

I've never heard of Swai fish... I made this & it won't be the last time, either !
   This is a tender, tasty buttery type fish when baked. 20 min tops. I did tweak the recipe some, omitted the cilantro & lemon but used a squeeze of lime juice along with some spicy paprika from Budapest, minced garlic, S & P
... lined a cake pan w/foil, 20  min till dinner...Yummy !!

It was great. I forgot the paprika, but overall, I didn't miss it. Wife loved it too, and luckily I made enough for us to have seconds. She had never had Swai before and now this recipe has made her a fan. Simple, easy, delicious - you couldn't ask for more from a recipe.

I didnt understand the reason for the margarine and so used butter.  After reading some of the comments, it might be why a few didnt like it.  I found it was delicious.

This was delicious but a bit too strong of a flavor for my children.  I made the sauce for twice as many fish and it seemed to be too much.  We enjoyed it though and I ate 2 pieces with a green salad and tomatoes and it was really a delicious combo.

This dish is delicious!  I loved the sauce on mine, but my husband wasn't all that happy.  He likes his fish without a sauce; basically DRY.... OY!  Other than that, he thought it was delicious :-)  I served it with smashed potatoes and sautéed Brussel sprouts with bacon.  I WILL be making this one again!  Thank you Allie for the recipe!

Great starting point! Some people said it felt like it was missing something. Heres a few tips if you wanna spice it up!
Add thinly sliced lemon and onion on top of the fish before spooning on the sauce. They cook into the fish and taste fantastic. I also added an easy fresh salsa on top:

I made it, but there is something missing and it is also too much broth. Maybe less white wine will be better.

It was good.  My family like it but complained that it was a little spicy BUT I substituted the white wine for chicken bouillon. I think that if I omitted the salt, it would have been great. But I will definitely try it again without the salt.

The fish was really tasty , the sauce enhanced the flavor nicely. However waaaayyyyy too much salt and pepper. I'll cut in half next time.

This was delicious and very easy. I just do not like the taste of cilantro ...so I eliminated it.

Loved it but 12 minutes cooking time was too short for our taste. I ended up cooking it close to 25 minutes, but I cooked two 8 oz fish.

Good & Light. I did it all on top of the stove...not the oven.  I used cooking Sherry & cilantro in the tube...didn't have fresh. My grandmother used to make a similar fish...brought back good memories.

This is my "go to" swai seasoning. My family LOVES it and have even instituted fish Friday because they can not get enough. I usually grill it on bbq grill pan actually cooking it in the oven for the first time tonight. Full of flavor and compliments the fish beautifully. Sometimes I will throw in some capers to change it up, but an awesome recipe.

I followed the recipe (but only used two filets because it was just my husband and I). It was amazing. The only thing I added were scallions after I pulled it out of the oven. This is a keeper for all fish types!!!!  Thank you!!

This went over as a huge success.  None to spare.
I did not have the white dry wine, so I made without.
Served with the Cranberry Rice Pilaf and green beans.

Loved this recipe made a few changes to my own taste preferences I used dill Instead of celantro, added garlic powder sprinkle on the fish, used Australian chardonnay and some roasted garlic seasoning blend from Aldi, and real butter only real butter in my house! Ate it with some Brussels sprouts the wine says was great on them!

I made the recipe as is, and it turned out pretty good.  I've made other tilapia recipes with more herbs and spices (which I prefer), but this recipe was easy and quick to make.  I served it with a wild rice blend and poured the leftover juice over it, as another reviewer recommended.  It made a difference.  I will use this recipe again if I need to make something in a flash.

Although the dish was tasty it took longer than 10-12 minutes to bake. More along the timeline of 30 minutes at 350. I used garlic salt rather than regular salt and used more minced garlic. A butter and herb rice is excellent as a side as is a pasta.

I increased the butter amount by 3x and accidentally almost burnt the butter,but I ran with it.  I added red wine(din't have white), dill - like some people suggested(didn't have cilantro) and sweet, smoked paprika.  I let it reduce and then poured it on top of the fillets and baked for 30 minutes uncovered.  Delish!!  My husband ate 2 servings.  It was a nice light meal.  I served it with white rice and a caesar salad.  Thank you for the inspiration!

My mother absolutely loved this when I made it for her! Hint to those who don't like cooking with wine: max half a cup of water, a quarter cup of white vinegar,  and a tablespoon of sugar.  Its a dry white wine substitute. Then just use a quarter cup of it like the recipe calls for. My mother mother a recovering alcoholic, so its my go to for a substitute when I cook recipes that call for it for her.

Made this for my mom and sister one night.  They absolutely loved it!  Me, too.  Mom prefers Parsley to Cilantro but that didn't detract from the dish. Also, added a little corn starch to thicken the sauce.

I liked it but I don't think it needed as much salt and pepper. Very spicy! I may have added to much and I only had 3 fillets. I'll try it again.

I use this recipe at least one a week!  But have used so many different spices I could not begin to tell you which?  It is a great basic recipe that is good for experimenting.  Swai/Basa or basically any mild fish will do well and it is very easy.  A keeper.

Excellent.   I used 10 ounces of fish and left everything else the same.  I did not use lemon juice.  Cooked at 375 degrees for 12 minutes.

Absolutely love how quick and easy this recipe is to prepare and the sauce has a wonderful flavor. I plan to use try this sauce with other fish as well (like Tilapia).

Simple, quick and has all my favorites for cooking fish.  I did cook about 10 minutes longer and turned out just as moist.  Light, yet flavorful.  Served with rice and roasted veggies.  Also spooned some of the remaining juice over the rice. Was a hit with my family and will make again.

Oh my gosh, this is a great recipe and very easy for me, a person that loves to eat but not cook.  I didn't have white wine, I substituted with sparkling grape juice instead.  I also didn't have lemon juice so I used just a dash of lemon extract.  The foiled cookie sheet made cleaning up very easy.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!!

I've made his several times now, I love it! I'm trying to eat fish at least 3 times a week and I do not like salmon, so swai fish it is. First time I made it exactly as written, very good as is. But I make changes now using tips from previous reviews as well as our family's preferences. I pan seared the fish first; use old bay seasoning instead of paprika; use more garlic and less salt. I serve with brown rice and steamed broccoli.

I love fish, but this is cheaper than what I normally get, and thought I'd give it a go. I tweaked it a little spice-wise, no wine, and we had 1.5 lbs, 3 fillets, so I cooked it for 25 minutes. My husband says it is one of his favorites, and ranked it in his top 5

Delicious and very flavorful! Husband and I loved it, will definitely make again. The only change I made, was substituted paprika with old bay seasoning, tip from another review. I also added lemon slices, and poured the sauce over white rice and served with steamed veggies. Yummy!

So good! I added the paprika to the simmer sauce instead of sprinkling it on top of the fish and covered the entire fish with the sauce so it cooked in the sauce. It came out moist and very flavorful.

I admit, I was skeptical at first, having tried several baked fish recipes and not being overly happy about any of the.  I have been searching for a good recipe that will make Swai flavorful as it is a very mild fish (one of the reasons I like it because it's not "fishy"). So when I saw this recipe for Swai fish, and I love Swai fish, I just had to try it. So I prepared it just as the directions suggested and boy, was I ever impressed!  The flavors all blended so well and I truly think the paprika was the finishing touch!  I paired it with some homemade mac n cheese and side salad and it was a great dinner!  I will definitely use this over and over whenever I make Swai!

I don't usually like cooking with wines but this was delicious.  Used dry vermouth since that's what was on hand. Turned out light but very flavorful. Will definitely make again and often.

Mild in flavor but very tasty. Easy if you need to cook a big batch of fish at once since you can put it all in the oven to cook.

I love swai, we usually fry it, but I ran out of vegetable oil, so I tried this recipe, and used everything but the cilantro, but I also added creole seasoning on top of the paprika, for an extra flavor. It was really good.

i wanted to pan sear this instead of bake so i used the ingredients as more of a marinade..  this had way too much pepper.... i can't fault it though b/c it was meant to be cooked in the oven.. i subbed beer for the wine, lime for the lemon, and kosher salt for table salt.. i made this as part of lunch for me but i think i'll let bf have the rest that i didn't eat

This was very tasty, I didn't have white wine so I used chicken broth I also doubled up on the spices, it did take closer to 25 minutes to cook throughly, served with rice and steamed veggies all in all I would make again.

Wonderful with lots of flavors. I let the fish set  until room temperature and the texture of the fish was perfect. I always worry when baking fish because I am afraid of getting it too done (dry). This method made a moist filet and the spices marinated the fish throughout. I had to substitute the fresh cilantro with ground cumin. It turned out very tasty.

This is an excellent recipe.  I love swai as it is mild tasting and easy to work with.  I made this exactly as directed and it came out perfect.  Flaky and tender with lots of flavor.  Accompanied with brown rice and sauteed summer squash and garlic.

Not even close to flakey. We baked in oven at 350 for about 20 minutes and then boosted oven to 400 and baked another 10-15 minutes. We tried to eat the fish, but the texture was so squishy.  So we then placed it in the toaster oven on high to dry it out.  Still squishy. Recipe ingredients are good...but the fish, not so much. Will stick to salmon going forward.

Perfect for Swai. If you use dried cilantro, use half what the recipe calls for. The dried seems to have a more pungent flavor that almost overwhelms the delicate Swai flavor. Simple ingredients, but packs a flavorful taste to fish.

I tried this recipe instead of Tired ol' Lemon Pepper fish (which I don't particularly like) & OMG!!! Fantastic Fish!!! I played it on a bed of Tony Zacheries herb rice and we literally had no leftovers and tons of thank yous. Thank you for the recipe and we can't wait to try more

Loved it...Total HIT! As others have mentioned, very versatile fish. This time I pan seared it, omitted the wine and used butter, coconut oil & sesame oil with sautéed baby bok choy and portobellos in the same pan. There was enough sauce to pour over the brown rice. I guess this is a whole other recipe, but the original led me to it. Bravo!

Perfect! So quick and easy. I didn't measure any ingredient, just eyeballed it and used lime in lieu of lemon juice. My boyfriend said it was the best fish he's ever had, home cooked by yours truly. Highly recommend :)

I was surprised by how good this was! I used frozen swai which I don't recommend. This was my first time ever eating swai and I had no idea what to expect. It's a very mild fish like tilapia maybe even a little milder. This recipe is perfect for first timers or people who aren't into "fishy" fish in my opinion. The only real thing I would do different is add the cilantro at the end since it loses all of its flavor cooking it in the sauce. It was a really simple and quick recipe with loads of flavor and I will be making this over and over.

I enjoyed this recipe.  I did not use the wine, but added extra lemon juice, and a little cayenne seasoning.  Very moist and tasty.

Fantastic taste, very easy and fast, super picky ten year old ate it all and husband loved it. Used a wild caught striped sea bass and I think it would go great with any mild tasting, white fish as long as it is not very dense (cod, halibut - which I generally use only for fish and chips.) Highly recommend and will definitely make it again and again.

I tried this for the first time and the flavor was GREAT!!   I did substitute the cilantro for dill but otherwise kept the rest of the recipe as written.  My husband went back for seconds so this one is going into my 'fish' rotation, thank you for a great recipe!

On HcG diet, so this is our go-to fish! Healthy, fast and yummy!  I left out the margarine and just used a little coconut oil. Instead of white wine I used a little  less than 1/4 c lemon flavored Balsamic vinegar. (available from Texas Hill country olive company)

Very delicious!!! I have never heard of this fish until yesterday. It's currently on sale at my local market 2 for $9.99 so I figured I'll give it a try. I added Italian dressing to the sauce, less then 3/4 cup of white wine then followed the recipe. I didn't like the taste with initial baking time so i allowed it to cook for 20 adtl minutes then added chopped carrots. It came out Perfect!!!   Thanks for recipe ???

I cook a similar dish.  Add dill and substitute the white wine for vodka - I steam mine in a slow cooker to seal flavors into the aroma.  i throw broccoli and carrots in there too.  lemon citroen vodka is my fav.

I made this without the white wine and substituted olive oil for the margarine.  I also mixed the paprika into the seasoning mix, rather than sprinkling it on the fish separately.  It turned out great!  This was my first time having swai, and this recipe was a great find.  When I make this again, I will use a little less salt than the recipe calls for to account for the change in seasoning volume due to the skipped wine.

Not extremely exciting, but Pretty good. I put lemon slices under the fish like another reviewer recommended... I also used dill in place of cilantro because I didnt have any. In short, I'd make it again.

Yes! I tried this recipe today 7/16/14 for the first time I loved it and so did my family. I am sorry I did not have more pieces of the Swai Fish. This was my first time eating this fish also , It was on sale so I decided to try it I would most definitely make again . I did not change a thing. Thanks for sharing.

Unfortunately, I didn't have any white wine on hand so I substituted 1/4 cup of chicken broth and 1 teaspoon of white wine vinegar.  Very good recipe especially for those that aren't big fish eaters.

Loved the Swai fish and loved the recipe! I didnt use cilantro only cause I don't like the flavor. My husband cooked it on the grill in the tinfoil not sure how long just till the fish fell apart with a fork (short time). Will buy this fish all the time and use this recipe just as much!...-bam88b

Great recipe!!  All three of my kids love it too!  Tastes so fresh with the lemon and cilantro!  The only change I make is using unsalted butter instead of margarine.

The recipe was very good. I would use again on a better quality fish. The swaill was not a hit in my home, the texture was too  'slimy' for hubby's liking.  I didn't care for the texture either but I would buy again if other family members agreed......not likely

First time cooking Swai, found this recipe for it, and it's spot on as far as flavor, and this being a mild fish. I do see what some are saying about lacking a little punch, but I didn't use cilantro, since I was out of it. Next time I'll try fresh cilantro, and maybe a tad more pepper. Otherwise, I was pleased with this recipe.

Good recipe my boyfriend found. First time using this fish. We bought it because it was on sale. It has no fish smell, and I agree it is a bit mushy, but not a nasty texture. It is a pretty good recipe. We did not follow it exactly due to having 4 times as much fish and not wanting to use as much wine. You can change up the seasoning a bit to your taste if you like more flavor or saltiness.

Pretty good - I used a bit more wine and kept the lemon juice low   because my daughter is not supposed to have citrus or acids for a few weeks, and still this was tasty.  A bit more garlic (always, in this house!), and I simmered the sauce a bit longer to avoid a raw garlic bite.  I had the oven up higher because I was roasting cauliflower, and it still took a bit longer than the 12 minutes in the recipe.

Best random recipe I have EVER found. It was about 7:00 and I was head deep in work and planned on getting up at 7:30 for something convenient to eat.  Then I remembered I had thawed a big swai filet today so I thought I would just toss it in the oven with salt and pepper to cook while I wrapped up my project. I googled how to bake swai because I always mess up temperatures.  This was the first result.  I skimmed the ingredients and since I had everything and it looked simple I set forth. I only switched it up for butter since I don't eat margarine.  Anyway, it was sooo easy and smelled incredible while cooking. The sauce is so quick and so tasty. I just realized I forgot paprika but it didn't need it. I'm not a big fan of the texture of baked fish so I seared it for a few minutes but I'm afraid to do only cook as it might burn off that delicious sauce flavor?  But I might try that next time - but only for the sake of texture. Either way... I gobbled it up with a small bowl of edamame which isn't the most complementary side dish...but I don't care - the fish was so deeeelish.  Now I'll enjoy a glass of the sav blanc I had to open as I work onward tonight.  And I will be certain to keep this recipe in my back pocket . Beats a PB&J for sure! 

THANK YOU!

Simple and delicious recipe! I recommend adding the cilantro, even though the recipe says it is optional.

When I sent my husband to the market to get some fish Swai is what he brought back. I never had this fish before so I didn't know how to cook it. The first time it was mushy and nasty. I diid't want it anymore. Then I decide to look up how to cook it. I came across this recipe and wow this is good. I can now enjoy it.....my family love it. My daughter who don't like fish I let her try both the fried and bake fish but she prefer the fried.

So, I followed this recipe to a T, but just couldn't like it. To be fair, I am not sure if it was the recipe, or the actual fish itself that I did not like. I had never had swai fish before but bought some because it was inexpensive. We regularly eat some type of mild, white fish, including cod, Ono and tilapia, so it's not that we don't like fish. This just had a strange taste, and I didn't care for the texture.

I tried this recipe tonight... didn't have the white wine but just did without it. It was good but we thought it needed more salt (which we just added) and alittle kick - some sort of spice. I'll probably try it again and add a few more ingredients to spice it up.
