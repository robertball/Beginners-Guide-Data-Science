I love this dip and make it all the time.  The only thing I do is use a heaping TBSP of dry chopped onion and I rehydrate it in the beer before I add it to the recipe.  I also don't add seasoned salt since the ranch makes it pretty salty.  Great with pretzels.  You'll never go home with leftovers.

I made this for a family gathering at Christmas, New Year's and put a bowl out with fresh veggies to hold off the crowd til dinner could get done at Easter. There has never been any leftover. My 8 year old GS said we should just plan on having it "everytime" we get together even when he just comes to visit for a weekend!! Delicious, easy, simple ingredients. Can't ask for more.  **UPDATE** Well, here it is late 8/2011 and he's here visiting.  He specifically asked that we make this today. Heading to store for another brick of cream cheese. Doing only "half" of this recipe is  a complete waste of time in my house!!  When kids ask for it by name and dig in with glee with their celery sticks, how can you say no to that kind of celebration!!!

At first, I thought this tasted a lot like beer. I scaled the recipe all the way to 7 servings to try out the taste only. I used whipped cream cheese, because it was all I had. I did use a darker beer, that has a stronger taste, but the recipe didn't specify. Once I let it sit in the fridge for 24 hours, and then dipped pretzels in it, the flavors blended together well. The beer just enhanced the cheese flavors instead of dominating it. It does go great with pretzels. However, I would definitely make it the night before so the cheese has time to absorb the beer and blend right. It will also be much thicker by then and the right consistency for dipping.

This is MUCH better if you substitute 8oz of sour cream for one of the packages of cream cheese.

Delish!  Made the whole thing in the processor - took about 5 minutes.  I didn't use any seasoned salt, and I'm not a fan of cayenne, but I did want a little "kick," so I added a healthy dose of horseradish.  I used a little more than 1/2 cup of Terminal Gravity IPA, and it was good straight out of the processor workbowl.  I got some Snyder's giant pretzel rods as a go-with...can't wait to taste it after it's had a chance to meld.  Thanks for a keeper!  10/8/11 - 24 hours later.  I'm not going to change the rating, but I will do a couple of things differently next time.  First, I was surprised by how thick it was, so that means I'll add more beer.  Second, I couldn't really taste the horseradish at all, so I'll be adding more of that, too.  It was very good, but just a wee bit too "ranchy."  I took it to a party in the bread bowl, and got lots of compliments...nice about not having to worry about taking the bowl home!

I haven't tried this particular recipe yet, but have been making a variation for year.  Only difference is no salt or pepper, but two chopped green onions mixed in.  Everyone loves this dip!

This is always my go to appetizer for work functions, parties, and snacks at the house. Only thing different I do is add garlic powder instead of the salt/cayenne. I always get request for this recipe!

I make this for parties or get togethers.  I put in 1/2 of a 12 oz. beer or a little more.  I don't use salt or cayenne pepper.  I also add 1/4 cup of chopped green onions.  It always gets devoured.

This is identical to a dip I've been making for years except I never add seasoning salt or cayenne pepper.  I do however add chopped green onions which goes great in this dip.  You must let this chill AT LEAST 8 hours for it to taste best.  The longer it sits, the better it will taste.  And I think light beer is best to use, as a darker beer will be too over powering.

I could eat the whole bowl of this.  It is my favorite snack to make since it is super easy to throw together. I have found that my favorite beers to use are Corona and Dos X. Have tried IPAs and even plain ol' domestics, and always come back to the above named 2. They seem to give a good beer flavor without being overwhelming or just too bland.

Excellent and easy!  It's been my "go-to" dip this summer.  Always a hit and always the first one gone.  Actually is great w/fat free cream cheese and 2% shredded cheddar.  We prefer it w/a darker beer as it makes it more flavorful.  Make the day ahead and let sit overnight.

I will be honest; I did not have high expectations for this one. But what a hit! This was THE hit of my Beer Fest party - people could not believe it was made with beer. This is so awesome with crunchy veggies; I will be making this for all of my summer time parties.

Loved it!  Big hit-  made it half size and it works fine, used newcastle brown ale, more robust flavor I think than a bud or lighter beer.  Easy and yummy!

Excellant Cheese Spread easy to modify, i.e. chopped green chilis, rolled in chopped nuts, crushed peppers, you get the idea, or all the above. Lots of opportunities with this one. Thanks for sharing.

Beer with ranch dressing didn't sound good to me, so when I found that my ranch dressing mix had fossilized, I threw it out and instead added a heaping tablespoon of crumbled blue cheese and a goodly sized pinch of cayenne pepper.  The hubby and son insisted on the dip being warm, so a few seconds in the microwave and it was bubbly and perfect.  We ate the dip with celery, soft pretzels (an Alton Brown recipe) and regular stick pretzels, no need to add salt, the pretzels have enough.  Best of all, this dip was even better after a night in the refrigerator.  Thanks for the yummy food!

I just made this for a party tomorrow and it's awesome.  I can only imagine it's gonna get better as it sits.  I thought the seasoned salt would be too much as the ranch packet is already very salty, so I did as other reviewers and added some chopped scallion instead of the salt or cayenne.

This is a wonderful dip.  I have been making this for quite some time now. I altered it by adding minced garlic and chopped green onion.  I mix the onion in and reserve some for the top.  Yummy!!!!

Delicious!  Big hit at poker night!  Serve with honey wheat pretzels.  I did heat up the dip before serving.  And I used a stout beer...but only a few splashes.

Big hit for an outdoor BBQ. Nice since this dip doesnt need to be heated like many cheese dips do. Will be making again soon. Great with pretzels.

Quick and tasty!  I made it in the food processor and chilled it overnight. Add 1/4 tsp of cayenne and it was perfect for us, not too hot, just flavorful enough to stand up to the veggies.

We really liked this dip. I added extra beer since it was so thick and also seasoned it with garlic salt and garlic powder in addition to the seasoned salt and cayenne pepper. It needs to sit for at least a couple of hours for the flavor to develop. Tastes great with salty pretzels and crackers! Try adding 8 oz Greek yogurt or sour cream and topping with bacon and green onions!

Super easy, so few ingredients, & fast.  I halved the recipe to try it & I didn't have any ranch dressing mix (I'm not a big fan of the stuff) so I just put in some parsley, garlic powder, garlic salt (no seasoned salt), & onion powder.  Love the kick the cayenne gave it (I put in about 6-7 shakes - we like spicy).  I used Bud Light, 1/3 less fat cream cheese & reduced fat cheddar.  Great on pretzels, even better right off the spoon!  I may try using sour cream instead of a second cream cheese when I make the whole recipe just to give it a little more tang & better texture.

This was a big hit. I used only about 1/4 of a beer instead of 1/2, it still had a good beer flavor.

Took this to a BBQ party.  I didn't have any left to take home!  I used a smoky seasoned salt and that added a nice flavor that went well with the beer and sharp cheddar.

This was a big hit at my get-together! I used Corona Light because that's what I had on hand, but next time I will use a more stout beer - Juengling, Harp or Amber Boch? I felt you couldn't really taste the beer because of the Corona. Instead of the regular packet of Hidden Valley Ranch, I used the spicy version and I really liked the flavor. I also added a bit of Old Bay and went happy with the cayenne! I will also use pretzel bread or soft pretzels rather than dipping sticks. Overall, it was really good & Inwill definitely make it again!

Cut recipe in half. used about 2TBS seasonings, (onion soup mix for one and Jack in the bean dip for the other). I used a Mexican blend of cheese with the jack seasoning mix. I found that mixing the beer with the cream cheese first, then adding seasoning, then shredded cheese was a much easier way to mix. So many different ideas of how to mix and use this dip!! Both the dips were wonderful used on both pretzels and various crackers. Found just in time for the holidays. Thank you for sharing.

This came out super salty.  If I make it again, I will skip the seasoned salt and not use the whole pack of ranch mix.  I also added a little sour cream based on a review, not sure if that impacted it.
It was easy to make, but not as good as I was hoping based on all the great reviews.

I was thrilled to find this cold beer cheese dip since I didn't have a small warmer to take to my party. I took the suggestion of using half cream cheese with half sour cream and also added some grated parmesan. I added a good bit of cayenne for heat and some paprika for color. It was fabulous!

A very nice change the the usual chips and dip.  I needed this to be non-alcoholic so I simmered a whole bottle of beer down to 1/2 cup, cooled and stirred into the cream cheese.

If I don't show up to a party with this dip in hand I am not welcome.  I do half the paprika.  It is so tasty.  

I used a really hoppy beer in it not just sparkling water (er. Budweiser, coors etc)  

It is a true hit

Made this exactly by the recipe for a party and everyone loved it.  I did make it the day before and I think that did make a difference in the taste (more flavorful).  I served it with pretzel sticks as recommended.  We also ate it with french bread the next day and that was yummy too.  I would add a bit more cayenne pepper next time to give it more of a kick.  Otherwise it was perfect!

Good base recipe. I skipped the ranch mix. Would have made it too salty. I used several other seasonings in its place and I used Budweiser. It disappeared quickly. ( the seasonings I used: garlic powder, onion powder, Cajun seasoning)

this turned out great... I used a medium cheddar, and new castle for the beer,  everything room temp. I was a little worried that it would come out chunky. it did not and the house loved it. made home made soft pretzels to go with it.

Add more beer to make this dip to make it more spreadable.  It will firm up once you refrigerate it.

Made this for a family New Years Eve get together. People
Loved it. Will make it again. It makes a huge amount, will likely scale the servings.

Made this for a party. I liked the idea of adding onions to the beer but was out so I used dried chives. Also added bacon bits. My adult kids wouldn't even let it chill for an hour before they dug into it!

Really great!! Incorporated some other suggestions from the previous reviews: omitted the salt, added 2tbs of dried onion to the beer and let them rehydrate before adding, and used 8 oz of sour cream in place of 1 package of cream cheese.... Fabulous!!

I used IPA Beer, and substituted 1 1/2 teaspoons Szechwan for the dressing mix.  Very good dip with Pretzels.

July 4th pot luck with family, nothing but rave reviews. 
Made according to direction, the only thing I will change next time is that I will add a beer with a bolder flavor. I made with a light IPA and it needed more beer flavor for my taste. Also watch the cayenne pepper I added one too many dashes.
I will only go with one dash, but that just personal preference.

Love this dip!  I've made it twice now to rave reviews.  Instead of dry ranch dressing, I added about 1/3 cup of bottled ranch dressing, so it's easier to stir together.  I also added some stone ground mustard.  And I baked it at 350 for 20-30 mins.  It's delicious hot with pretzel crisps  !

I was hesitant about the texture at first, but its delicious! I will say though, if you are making 1 batch of pretzels halve this, its quite a lot of dip.

This was great with pretzels or even ranch Doritos chips. It tastes very salty but very yummy!

This stuff is so yum! I added about 3 tbsp of minced dehydrated onion, an extra half packet of ranch seasoning, a dash of Worcestershire, a dash of hot sauce and almost a full beer. Everyone loved it. Will make it again for sure.

I'm not sure what exactly happened here, but the taste of this was very odd. Maybe the type of beer used matters a lot in this case. Wouldn't make again unfortunately.

I really thought I'd like this recipe but was disappointed by the overpowering beer taste. I used a mild light beer too. Apparently my guests were of the same opinion as there was a lot left over :o(

I thought this turned out just ok.  A lot of dips I have tried lately use cream cheese, shredded cheddar and ranch mix and they are all starting to taste the same.
