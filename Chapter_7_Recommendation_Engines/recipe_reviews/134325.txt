We tried this in my commercial kitchen exactly as written. The four kitchen staff tasted it and rated it a 3 - too bland.  We decided to add more pork rind, chunky rather than crushed and some scallion. Everyone rated the new version as a 4.

I tried this last week but made a few changes. I used 1 tablespoon of low-salt butter instead of the lard and I used canola oil in lieu of vegetable oil. I added chopped onion, scallions and a bit of fresh garlic as well. They come out pretty greasy, so pat them between layers of paper towels when removing them from the frying pan and voila!

When I saw this, it reminded me of the "tortas de papa" my grandma makes, but hers don't have chicharrones or flour in them... I made them and OH MY GOSH!  So much better than that!  I mean, texture and consistency are different, but they are delish.  How are these usually eaten, by the way?  Ours are put in a spicy caldo, so that's what I did.  Did I mess them up?
