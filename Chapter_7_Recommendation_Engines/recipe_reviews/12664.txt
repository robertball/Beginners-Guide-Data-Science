Delicious! I used ground lamb instead of cubed and brown rice instead of white. The flavours were just right. A very satisfying dish worth the effort. Great with a fresh garden salad on the side.

The taste was very flavorful. This was delicious. It does take a long while to put together but it is worth it. The next time I make it I will prepare it the day before I am going to serve it and refridgerate it over night. This will make it easier. I know I will be serving this for our family gaathering at Easter.

My Greek neighbor got me hooked on this meal. So when I found this version I made it and let HER try it. She was impressed. And so where my kids! The LOVE it. A little labor intensive but worth the effort the taste is out of this world!

This was delicious! It took a bit of time for prep...including cooking lamb and boiling eggs ahead of time. However it was worth it. I kept thinking that the mix of ingredients was odd as I put it together but they came together very nicely in the end. The only thing that I changed was the rice...I didn't have white rice I only had brown. And I only had enough to make two cups. However I felt that was the perfect amount in the end and that 4 cups may have been a bit much.

I really liked this but my Husband didn't. He thought there were too many textures going. I adore Greek food and thought the flavours were just wonderful. Used minced lamb and didn't add the beaten egg in the top layer because I ran out of eggs! Took a while to put together but the end result is worth it. Too bad I won't be allowed to make this again:(

My family loved this dish. I didnt use the phyllo dough just because I didnt have it and wanted to use what I had on hand. I also used the brown rice as one other person had suggested and the dish was wonderful. Oh and instead of using the beef broth I used the left over gravy from the lamb.

This dish took forever to put together! Lots of steps and pre-cooking involved. The taste was good but not that fantastic. We all liked the phyllo crust.

I made this dish pretty much as written and it was quite good. However my family agreed that when I make it again I would reduce the amount of rice to maybe three cups and increase the amount of meat. I can see also making this with beef. The seasoning combination was excellent.

Used what I had on hand as always and adapted this. Had one roasted lamb shank and a pound of ground lamb. Fried the ground with a chopped onion and some greek seasonings until the onions were cooked and the lamb cooked thru. added garlic powder a splash of beef broth a 10 oz package of chopped spinach squeezed dry S&P 1 c feta crumbles (I had 1/2 4 0z a tomato basil flavor and 4 oz fat free plain) and then I added 1/2 c parm to make up the difference. I added the meat from the roasted shank. and 1 T chopped green olives. I cooked the rice (I only had white would have preferred brown) then added some greek seasoning and a tsp of olive oil to give it some flavor. Assembled as directed. Brushed the top with a beaten egg and baked at 400 I think for 35 minutes or until it is brown. Smells really good. Thanks for the starting place...Momofone
