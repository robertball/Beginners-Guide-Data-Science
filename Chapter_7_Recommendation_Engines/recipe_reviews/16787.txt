This is a WONDERFUL recipe- the cookies melt in your mouth due to the powdered sugar in the dough. The combination of oatmeal and chocolate is yummy! My mom made these cookies when I was young and now I am making them for my 3 grown sons! So easy too and fast! Slice and bake!

These cookies taste good.  Be careful not to over bake as they burn easily.  12 minutes/batch worked well for me.  You could try rolling the logs in colored sugar.
