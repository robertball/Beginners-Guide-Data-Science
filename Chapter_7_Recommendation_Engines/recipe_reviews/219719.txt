no, I have not made the pie.... but I "KNOW" this pie is going to taste great... our family has something very close to this... the biggest difference is the crust, we make graham cracker crust.

I only gave this 4 stars because I have not tried it yet. I will make it this week. I grew up with home made angel food cake and have loved it! This sounds delicious and your story behind it is very touching. It makes me want to try it on that merit alone. Those who have negative comments, I'm sure, did not follow the instructions correctly or they simply have a taste for richer foods. This is simple, yet elegant. Thank you for sharing this recipe, along with your story.

bad recipe imo. to much water, not enough substance. filling broke down only hours after being made. the recipe makes twice as much filling as needed for one 9" pie shell. the whipped cream topping is bland at best. I wouldn't make this again if i had to.

eh, was ok.  Fairly easy to make, but, really not much to it.  Probably will not make again.

For a switch up, I put a layer of homemade lemon curd into the piecrust before adding the eggwhite mixture.  Be sure to let the curd cool before putting it into the pie.  
Being sure to add ROUNDED tablespoons of corn starch helps the consistancy of the egg white mixture and remember - it will only last a couple of days in the fridge.  
In this house - it lasts a day - that meal and then I seem to have fridge raiders!  Leftovers never see the light of the next day.

Have not tried it yet; but did read the 2 negative reviews.  My first thought was that I would add either melted chocolate (or cocoa) to the bottom layer (making it like chocolate mousse) -- OR add pineapple & nuts to the filling (making it like millionarie pie).  Perhaps that will "jazz" it up!

I just -tried- to make this pie, and something is not right with the recipe.  I makes twice as much as you'll need for a 9" pie...you'd probably get a 12" easily.  The water and cornstarch took over 25 minutes to thicken even a little bit (never got a nice, pudding-like consistency).  I drizzled the warm mixture into the egg whites, and it took another 35 minutes and 3 more egg whites to get it past the liquid stage, and I'm a really good cook....I KNOW what stiff peaks should be like.  The taste of the ingredients was wonderful, but right now, I have it in the freezer trying to harden it enough to slice, instead of spoon into a dish.  I will toy with this one because I believe it's worth saving.

This was ABSOLUTY Fabulous!   I  had leftover egg whites(From a chocolate cream pie)  and a baked pie shell and I needed a second dessert for someone who does not like chocolate.  So a quick search on Allrecipes with Baked pie shell and NO chocolate turned this up.  Boy Am I glad it did.  It turned out perfect.  And was so delicious. It is correctly named.  A new favorite.  It went over more than the chocolate pie.  Thank you Thank you!  I made just as the instructions and it does NOT need anything more.  I will be making again very soon and will upload a Picture.  I loved the story as well.   Thank you for sharing the recipe and the story!
