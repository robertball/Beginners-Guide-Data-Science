I will use this recipe in place of my old standby, which is a blue-ribbon winner. I followed the directions exactly and it came out perfectly.  We'll see how the county fair judges like it this year. Please note: one reviewer suggested to add 3 times more chocolate, add more cornstarch, and use whites instead of yolks. If you want a disaster on your hands, go ahead and take that advice!

This pie came out great - It was wonderfully chocolaty! I made it for my husbands B-day and he loved it. I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect as is and I even live in high altitude. I didn't have any problems with it setting or anything else. The step where you mix the egg yolks separately in a bow is necessary so that the eggs don't cook when you add them to the hot chocolate mixture, if they cook as you add them then you will have lumps of egg yolks in your filling. Having them in a bowl and adding some of the chocolate mixture to them slowly takes the temp down a bit so this doesn’t happen.

For those of you who have a gritty result, I'd say it's not the kind of milk you're using (I used whole) but perhaps you're not dissolving the sugar/milk mixture long enough, or melting the chocolate thoroughly.  I whisked this recipe basically constantly  and it came out with a lovely texture.  It tastes like homemade chocolate pudding.  Very good and pretty simple.

Good flavor, but not suited for pie because it's a bit loose. Backed off the sugar and did 1 1/8 cup, plenty sweet as it is with the choco. chips. Everything else followed exactly --and nope, the Saran Wrap doesn't stick, cool, huh? Pie set for 24 hours in the fridge, but still came out loose (we even used whole milk). Consistency of thick pudding -- excellent tasting pudding, mind you, but not quite thick enough to truly be a great cream pie. We'd cut a slice, put it on a plate, and it'd would blob into a gooey puddle that looked like pudding as soon as your fork hit it. Big no no for a pie. I may try this again and add a little more corn starch to see if that firms things up.  I'm not a fan of pudding pies - pudding is good, just not in a pie shell. If you dig instant pudding pies, are content with that sort of gooey consistency and are looking to get a bit fancier than ripping open a box and dumping some milk in, you may really dig this recipe. If you're not a pudding pie type, this probably won't be for you.  If you're just looking for a great, rich pudding, this is a great recipe, sans the pie shell!

This is a great base recipe, but it needs a couple changes in order to make it perfect.  First of all, DO NOT use chocolate chips.  Chocolate chips contain ingredients that can cause items to be soft-set.  Instead, I substituted 6 oz. semi sweet chocolate and then the 2 oz. unsweetened chocolate already called for in the recipe.  I suggest using whole milk simply because it will yield the best results, but I'm sure you could sub. lower fat milk and it turn out just fine.  I also used a chocolate graham cracker crust instead of the normal pie crust.  Once your milk/chocolate mixture gets warm, temper it into your eggs.  This essentially means to whisk constantly to ensure the eggs don't curdle.  Add that mixture back to the pot, and whisk constantly until it boils.  You want it to boil for a good minute and make sure you whisk during that minute.  Pour into a pie shell, cover with plastic wrap and chill.  For those who complained about it being lumpy, it could be you didn't temper the eggs correctly and you're tasting pieces of egg.  If it's grainy, you likely didn't cook it long enough and you're still tasting the cornstarch.  I'm sure using a store-brand chocolate chip can also yield lumpy results because they just don't melt the way toll house does.

This chocolate pie is evil on a plate, it is sooooooo sooooooo yummy.  My husband made Christmas eve and had extra pudding in a bowl saved for mwa and I put whipped cream on and yes it is sinful.  It would even be GREAT served in fancy glasses w/ whipped cream if you don't have pie shell, I can't decide how I liked it better.  Don't change this recipe, why mess with perfection.  For pie give plenty of time to set up.

o.k. so this pie turned out super awesome! It totally wasn't THAT hard, and so worth it even if it was! It was so rich and chocolaty compared to the pudding versions. At the last minute before serving, I smothered the top with fresh whipping cream, then I  garnished it with chocolate curls that I made with a vegetable peeler. YUM

This must be a DEEP DISH pie shell...or use 2 regular pie shells. I poured the excess filling into dessert cups, and used Meringue II from this site to top the pie. ONE cup of sugar was perfect, and made the perfect chocolatey richness. 5 stars if the sugar were reduced.

The chocolate is so rich it will make your teeth ache!  I used 2% milk but next time I make this I'm going to use either whole milk or maybe half and half as the pie wasn't creamy enough for me. I would certainly be pleased to offer this to guests.

This is a WONDERFUL recipe!  Very chocolatey & delicious.  I made it for Thanksgiving and it was the only pie that was completely devoured.  I will definitely make this one again.

My mother's long lost recipe!!!  My mother always made the best chocolate pies for the holidays.  She passed away 14 years ago, and I have been searching high and low for something that would come even close.  When I ate the first bite of this...I almost wept.  It's my mother's pie.  I can't believe it.  I am so thankful to Corwynn Darkholme for posting this recipe.  I am thankful to all those that tried it before me, and rated it the way they did.  I was careful to use the name brands that my mother always used in her kitchen....and this Christmas we will be sharing her pies again with the whole family.  By the way, my mother got her recipe from my great grandmother....so it's truly a bitter sweet sense memory treat!  If you love chocolate...DO NOT PASS THIS ONE UP!!!

Great - IF you really want a deep, dark chocolate pudding.  I just made it as a pudding, instaed of as a filling.  It set up nicely and tastes rich and delicious.  I'll definately use this one again.

If you like chocolate, you owe it to yourself to try this recipe! I have made it twice and received rave reviews both times. The first time, I used a traditional homemade crust. For this years' Thanksgiving, I had my stepdaughter pick up a crust, expecting a graham cracker one, and she came home with a chocolate one. Either way, this is one delicious dessert. Easy, quick, chocolate and delicious. What more could you want?

Excellent! The texture of a cream pie with the taste of a fudge pie. I added a meringue for extra decadence. Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe did not turn out well for me. The filling was too runny and actually tasted gritty. Very dark flavor, as well. Won't make again.

i gave this pie 5 stars for the taste.  it is sinfully good.  i get requests for it for every family event.  but it is very difficult and time consuming to make.  my family knows that it has to be a VERY special occasion for me to make it.  i ususally need someone to help me cook it which bothers me because i like to be the only one that sees my dishes until they are ready to eat.  BUT, the finished product is definatly worth the trouble.

VERY good! I didn't have the unsweetened chocolate squares. Instead, I substituted 6 tablespoons of Hershey's unsweetened cocoa powder, which I added to the sugar mixture and 2 tablespoons of butter, which I added when it was time to add the vanilla. 

I set aside 1 cup of the milk and stirred the egg yolks into that and then stirred the eggs mix into the milk and sugar mixture. No lumps of scrambled eggs this way. 

For those of you who don't like dark chocolate, you can substitute milk chocolate morsels instead, which are much sweeter. The pie was divine and will be my go-to chocolate pie recipe from now on!

The people who got bad results cooking this pie just don't know what they are doing and didn't follow the recipe.   This is a wonderfully thick, dense, rich pie that is smooth as silk.  It is any chocolate lover's fantasy dessert.   It is a annual favorite requested by all.   I serve it with freshly  whipped heavy cream lightly sweetened (just use a hand mixer)  and it knocks it out of the park.  
The only change I have is not to press the plastic into the chocolate.  I let it cool and then wrap the pie tin keeping the plastic off of the filling---put into the refrigerator.

I followed the recipe exactly as written and this was delicious.  Hint:  when baking the pie crust, I lined it with aluminum foil, them filled it with coins from my change jar.  I don't have pastry weights, but those also work.  It cooked the crust perfectly.

WOW this was absolutely amazing. I followed the filling instructions to the letter and it came out brilliantly.  I used the Tiramisu Cheesecake crust from this site and it went brilliantly. I had some crust left over so I mixed it with some coconut essence, grated coconut, some sweetened cocoa powder and some cinammon and sprinkled it on top of the set pie. It was heaven. One thing I noticed was that the pie's flavour was a lot cooler- sort of less intense - after it was chilled overnight. However my family loved it either way. The consistency was perfect. If anyone's didn't set I would say they didn't cook it for enough, or didnt follow the instructions properly. Don't skip the egg step! Absolutely perfect!

I tested this recipe and personally I didn't like it - it was too chocolatey(dark bittersweet taste). I don't like that taste but my family really enjoyed it.

My search for the perfect chocolate pie is finally over! This is so good. The second time I made this I combined it with another recipe "Chocolate Banana Pie" I am not a fan of boxed pudding and this was the perfect answer. I needed 2 pies and combining it with the other pie recipe, it was more than enough for 2 pies. I followed the other recipe but used the filling for this pie instead of boxed pudding mix. I also didn't add the layer of whipped topping until I was ready to serve the pies. Chocolate curls and a sprinkling of chopped pecans on top of the whip cream made for a beautiful presentation. Thank you for a great recipe!

I made this for Christmas lunch with my family, and they would not stop talking about it. It was rich, and super yummy. I was expecting to mess it up or for it to be strange, but it was PERFECT! 
I put a meringue from Alton Brown on the top, and my Pappaw used his small welding torch to lightly crisp the tips of the meringue. You can find the recipe for it here: http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/lemon-meringue-pie-recipe/index.html
  I will definitely make this again!

This is THE BEST chocolate cream pie recipe on this site that I've tried. I've tried several of the higher rated ones, and I didn't really like them -- I think I don't like ones that use flour. I used just 1 cup of sugar and it set up fine (I'm not sure why it didn't set up for some people, unless they just didn't cook it right). Next time I'll increase the sugar to 1 1/4 cups, and I think 1 1/2 cups as instructed is probably perfect for most people -- I tend to like things less sweet. This is extremely RICH so I would either make a meringue with the leftover whites next time or make homemade whipped cream as Cool Whip is a little too rich a topping for this too :) Thank you, Corwynn Darkholme, for my family's new favorite chocolate pie! (P.S. The filling DOES fit in 1 deep dish crust, but it mounds up very high and there's no way you're putting a meringue or decorative whipped cream topping over it and then fitting it in a pie carrier. The Cool Whip on mine was smashed against the top of my pie carrier -- next time I'll put this filling in 2 pies!)

The pie is rich and chocolaty, but I think it is too much so.  Some people liked it, but I just felt it was too overwhelming chocolate.  To say the least I was disappointed, it was supposed to be a special pie for my dad. I would have given it fewer stars, but felt this was more a personal dislike not the recipes fault. Thank goodness the coconut cream recipe I got from allrecipes was great.

most of my family really liked this recipe, and even though it's not as sweet as other chocate recipes, it really tastes great, and is kind of one of those 'just right' combinations.

I absolutely LOVE this pie, and my family requests it for every gathering. I use a homemade shortbread cookie crust, and it's simply delicious. I also use 3/4 cup of milk chocolate and 2 ounces of dark chocolate, since my family prefers milk to dark. This pie is PERFECT.

Thank You So Much!  My mother passed away over twenty years ago and never taught me how she made her wonderful chocolate pie.  I have been missing it and looking for a similar recipe for a long time.  This is the closest yet.  She used the egg whites to make a meringue, (just like the ones on a lemon meringue pie) and the golden peaks of meringue takes the recipe from 'super yummy' to 'out of this world yummy' for me.

This pie was absolutely perfect.  I had never made chocolate cream pie from scratch before and had been dying to try this.  I had no problem with consistency or set up; the only reviewer suggestion I used was to add the white of one of the eggs, but I don't think it made any difference.  This is a WONDERFUL recipe.  Thanks so much.

As a true chocoholic, I found this pie to be quite tasty; however, my husband and mother thought it was a little too strong.  I topped it with a meringue and used 2% milk, but I thought it set a little too soft.  I don't know if anyone else had this problem, but I also noticed that the unsweetened chocolate took quite a while to melt.  So long that I was afraid I would have little chocolate pieces in the pie even though I chopped it well.  Despite this, I thought the taste was great, and I will probably make it again.

This is a really really really sweet pie.  The whipped cream actually is needed to offset the sweetness of the pie.  Good but probably won't make again.

This is a basic chocolate cream pie recipe and it's very good. As is this is just barely chocolatey as I had to add about 3 times more chocolate (chips and cocoa powder) to make this chocolaty. I also needed to add more cornstarch as it was clear that the mixture would not be solid enough. I did not use egg yolk, but instead whites as I never use yolks and everythign came out fine. I also assume that the mixing the eggs in a separate bowl is a uselss step and one extra dish not needed so I will skip that step next time to see. I made a grham cracker peacan crust, garnished pie w/ banana, chocolate shavings, chocolate & regualr whipped cream and caramel. Was sinfully to die for!

This is a great recipe, but if you make it, be sure after you add the eggs, to bring it back up to a boil, and once it is boiling, let it bubble for a full minute or even maybe two minutes. There is an enzyme in eggs that needs to be killed by the heat. The enzyme liquefies protein coagulation, so if you do not kill it with the boiling, your pudding will liquefy after it thickens.

As another reviewer said, this makes stunning pudding. But its not a pie filling. I was going to ignore the slightly loose texture, but even my fiance (who loves the taste of the pie filling) commented on it being just a bit to loose. I love love love the taste of the filling (I know some have mentioned it being to sweet, but I didn't find that to be the case, personal preference for sure)so I wont be changing anything to do with flavor. I will try adding a bit more cornstarch to see if that fixes the firmness issue and will report back if it does!

This is an incredible pie!  I did sub half the milk for heavy whipping cream.   I added 5 medium size marshmallows while cooking and this pie stood at attention.  I topped it off by using a chocolate pie crust.  This will be a holiday favorite.

This was amazing and very easy to make!  Followed the recipe exactly as written and family loved it!  I was afraid I had let boil too long after mixing in the yolks as it thickened quickly, but it was perfect.  Refrigerated overnight and then served with whipped topping with mini chocolate chips sprinkled on top.  Will definitely make again soon!  Thank you!

I was in a hurry and looking for a good chocolate pie recipe last night.  This looked like the one my mother used to make that everyone in the family loves. If it's not, it runs a close second!  Wow, it's rich, creamy and very good.  I only had an 8" pie shell, so the remaining filling went into some pudding dishes (2).  I usually don't have the exact ingrediets called for in some of these recipes and I substiute what I have instead. This time, I got to follow the recipe exactly and it was truely a good pie! I will keep this recipe and use it for the holidays! Thank you!

Everyone really enjoyed this pie. The only thing that kept it from bein a 5 is the fact that I had to add cornstarch to firm up the filling. As is it was a bit on the runny side.

as with anything in cooking you can vary the recipe to change the flavor or add a little more pizzazz. But, for the basic, no-fail chocolate pie this is the one. I have been using this recipe for the last couple of years at Thanksgiving and Christmas and one is never enough, even if it is just my wife and kids. It uses cornstarch so as directed, you must bring it to a boil for it to set up properly. Thank you for this recipe. My wife and 4 daughters thank you as well. P.S. on a personal note... Adding some fresh chopped mint leaves is a killer touch for those who like chocolate mint flavors.

WoW!  This is incedibly rich and delicious!  I used 2 1/2 cups milk and 1/2 cup heavy cream.  It made the filling a tad richer and creamier.  I also replaced the chocolate with 1/2 cup milk chocolate chips and 2 1/2 ounces of a dark chocolate candy bar because that is what I had on hand - it turned out super tasty!

This pie is so rich no one could eat a whole piece, I don't know how to lighten it up. Had excellent taste, but was like eating a wedge of fudge.

Delicious! I make chocolate pies for my youngest son (18) regularly and this is my new recipe. Made a graham cracker crust for the pie (recipe from this site). I used 60% chocolate chips.  The pie was perfect.

I read alot of the reviews prior to making this pie and I have to say, I had no problems whatsoever. I followed the recipe to a T minus one small fact: some people mentioned the pie was very sweet so I cut the sugar to 1 cup. The pie set up perfectly and was not runny at all. Made sure to cook it till it was thick before removing from heat. I used a graham crust and topped with homemade whipped cream. It was really delicious. Probably would have been just fine with the additional sugar. First chocolate cream pie I ever made and was very pleased.

Most amazing chocolate pie I've ever made and it stood up beautifully when sliced!!! Added some chocolate chips to the crust when it was hot and spread them around to keep the crust from getting soggy. Can't wait to make it again!!!

I made this pie for my birthday this week.  I love chocolate any way, so this pie hit the spot! After being chilled throughly, it cut perfectly. It looked like the pie in the picture.  I topped it with canned whipped cream.  I may try adding meringue next time.  It does have a ton of sugar and I will only make it for special occasions, but I will make it again.

This pie was absolutely delicious!  It has a very rich, dark chocolate flavor which I love. The consistency was perfect-- it takes a bit of time heating and stirring, but it is worth it.  I made it with a graham cracker crust instead of the pastry crust and it turned out beautifully.

I was not very fond of the flavor. I think it was the addition of vanilla extract. I also did not find it to be sweet enough. However, it was creamy, thick and SUPER chocolate!

I really liked this recipe. The filling set very well and tasted great. I shortened the steps by adding the egg yolks to the milk and whisking them together before adding them into the pot. This worked out fine seeing how I did this technique in a different custard pie. Just don't stop moving it around. Other than that I didn't change a thing and I received rave reviews!

Absolutely delish, and, clearly, since myself was involved in the making of it, it's fool-proof! My husband wanted a chocolate pie for Thanksgiving, and was surprised when I actually made this one from scratch instead of simply putting pudding in a pie-shell. I used milk-chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet, and the end result was a pie that had you groaning "I SOOO full" after one slice . . . even as you reached for another.  Milk chocolate chips makes for a much richer tasting pie, and it might not be for everybody that way, so caveat emptor. I used a Pillsbury Pie Shell, because I have no luck with pastry, and it went perfectly with it -- very airy and flakey. Thanks a ton for submitting this fun and easy recipe that only LOOKS hard to make.

I have been wanting to make a homemade chocolate pie for some time now and thought this was the recipe.  I followed it exactly and it was awful.  I was surprised because most of the recipes I use from this site are great.  I was disappointed with this one.  First off, it didn't set at all.  When I cut into it, it oozed all over and it looked terrible.  Second, it had way too much vanilla.  I had a feeling when I was adding it that it was going to be too much and I was right.  I guess I will have to continue my search for a good chocolate pie recipe. Sorry.

Everyone loves this chocolate pie! The texture did turn out gritty the first 2 times I made it. Then I switched to whole milk and it was smooth. The recipe should say whole milk.

NOTE TO NEW COOKS: I have never made a homemade cream pie like this before, but take it from me, when it says add things gradually, add them GRADUALLY!  Also, use whole milk....I used 1% and didn't do things gradually, so my pie ended up like soup.  I rated this a 4 because I could tell that if I'd done it correctly, it would have been great.  Wonderful chocolate flavor!  I had chocolate chips, but I didn't have unsweetened squares; I only had semi-sweet squares, so I winged it and guessed on reducing the sugar.  I think I used about a cup of sugar instead of 1.5 cups, especially after reading a couple of reviews that said it was too sweet in the first place.  I can imagine that homemade whipped cream would have made it perfect, too.

This was amazing.  I did come out similar to a pudding pie, but the filling is so much better....very much worth  the extra effort!

It was good, and not difficult. Company enjoyed it, and the family enjoyed the leftovers. The crust quality will also influence the taste of the pie, so keep that in mind.

Wow-have never written a review before, but this was so good I had to say it....  and it was oh so easy. It was so rich and creamy.  Top it off with some chopped nuts and drizzle with some caramel to really bring it over the top. Very very rich though, a little slice will do!

I thought this was great, and my sister loved it, too. I think it makes a big difference when you use homemade pie crust. I followed the directions exactly, and it set beautifully. I had too much pie filling for the crust, so I let it set in a bowl, and then served that with raspberries, vanilla yogurt and granola, and even that was a hit!

Pretty good!  I made this for my dad who insists on from scratch instead of a pudding mix (and he can always tell the difference!) and this passed the test--he said it was the best he has had in years!

I don't usually rate recipes before I've had the final product BUT... This pie is WONDERFUL!! Chocolate pies are a thing of my childhood. My grandmother always used Royal brand chocolate pudding to make her pies but I only make scratch. It's sooo hard to find a recipe that's made from scratch that's chocolaty and it's even harder to watch and stir it JUST right to not get lumps. Between the different method of this pie resulting in a SMOOTH filling and the double chocolate, it's PERFECT!! It's very rich so I small tiny pieces of heaven in our future. I always put my chocolate pies in Graham Cracker crust. Thank you, Corwynn for sharing!

I'm 17 yrs old thought i'd try my luck in pastry and this is a great receipe the chocolate isn't so overpowering it's just right although some tips to have smooth chocolate would be when adding sugar, cornstarch, and salt I personally sae it bettet to add milk first to help desolve the other ingredients since when sugar melt it tends to caramelize and if using cold milk it will harden and cause little chunks of sugar and cornstarch anyways loving the pies.

I made this exactly as written.  It was OK, WAAYY too sweet and rich for me and as it turned out wouldn't be suitable for serving company as it really didn't set up firm and the pieces don't come out nice.  Think I'd have to modify if I made again.

This would have been a good pudding or parfait recipe but not for a pie. I made it exactly as the recipe called for and it tasted wonderful but even after letting it set and refrigerating it, it wouldn't cut like a pie should and basically melted. I am glad I didn't take this to my in-laws for the holidays. Like I said good pudding but not for pie! Me & my husband ate it with spoons.

Made it last minute in a hurry for a family dinner & everyone loved it! The recipe is enough to fill up two pie shells or we save the extras and eat them like pudding. I didn't realize it needed to chill so long so I threw it in the freezer while we ate dinner and it was perfectly chilled by dessert time. You can taste the cornstarch a little which is my only complaint.

My husband was craving a chocolate pie, so after seeing the reviews for this recipe, I tried this one. It turned out fabulous! I burnt the bottom of my saucepan a little, but that was my own fault for not stirring constantly as I should have. I will definitely be trying this again!

UPDATE: This pie still continues to wow. I've made it many times since my first review, following the directions exactly. Make sure you put in the exact amount of cornstarch so your filling isn't too loose! I also use a pre-made Oreo cookie crust. One of my old employers loves chocolate pie, so I made this for him, and he LOVED it. He said it was better than his mom's that he ate growing up. The next thing I want to try is adding bourdon or rum.

I have made this twice.  Beautiful rich chocolate flavor.  The first time the consistency was great for pudding, but made a sloppy pie.  The second pie I was trying to use up a milk chocolate Easter bunny, so I substituted about 5 oz milk chocolate for the semi-sweet and cut back the sugar to a rounded cup and the vanilla to 1 tsp.  I also increased cornstarch to 1/2 cup.  The pudding seemed almost too thick during cooking, but resulted in a perfect pie consistency and the sweet level is good.  Overall I preferred the flavor of semi-sweet chocolate but will continue to add extra cornstarch.

My brother and I have been looking for a Choc Peanut Butter pie recipe that resembles what we had as kids.  I used this recipe and made just two changes.  I used 2 Cups of Half and Half with one Cup of Milk.  At the very end I added about 1/3 C smooth Peanut Butter.  I must say that this was excellent!  Will make this again!

This has been a wonderful pie for me to make!  I made this the first time last year for Thanksgiving...My family, including my father-in-law, ask for this pie for every get together.  (And I make one just for him because otherwise he get upset that everyone is going to eat it all)  I have also made this for just the pudding as a treat for the girls.

A delicious chocolate pie. The filling tastes like pudding, but with a stronger cacao flavor than the average supermarket kind. I used 500 ml of whipped cream to cover the entire pie.

This pie was not good.  It was far too sweet and not rich in the way I prefer.  I am not sure how else to describe it except to say that the two pies I made for Christmas were an unfortunate end to an otherwise delicious dinner.

This is the first time in my life to make a chocolate pie. This pie recipe is the ultimate. So easy to make just remember to never stop stirring while it cooks~ using a whisk works best! My family couldn't believe I made something home made that was so delicious. Yummy chocolate better than my grandmother's for sure!

Grainy, and way too sweet.  Omit semisweet choco chips maybe?  I think Baker's unsweetened chocolate makes it grainy.

The consistancy was great, but it was way too sweet.  I would adjust the sugar and the vanilla.  A tablespoon of vanilla is pretty strong.  I will try again with less sugar and vanilla.

This was excellent!!  The filling was creamy and chocolatey!!!  Also I made an oil crust...in my opinion a much flakier crust than lard-type crust.  The pie was delicious and I plan to make it again for Thanksgiving.

Outstanding!!! I used pre-made crust, but the filling was absolutely delicious. My Mee-Maw is the only person in my family who makes a top-notch homemade chocolate pie - others cannot compete! Her heart would be broken if she knew there was one better! :)

This pie was delicious!! All you chocolate lovers out there this is the pie for you. Its for one VERY chocolaty!! This pie was the first pie I have ever made and it came out perfect. My advice would to chill your pie for about a day and half. That way the pie won't fall when you cut into it. Also I would add not to leave the pie on the counter for long, because it then starts to fall [as in melting].

I followed this recipe exactly as written  and my family did not like it.  The taste is sweet... too sweet.  The texture, was like pudding. It wasn't quite as runny as one of the other reviewers said, but it had a difficult time keeping it's shape when sliced and the remaining pie, after a while, wanted to fill the space.  Won't be making this one again... still on my search for the ultimate chocolate cream pie!!

This pie was AWESOME!  My 11-year-old actually made this for Thanksgiving and it was devoured within minutes!!!!  She made an Oreo pie crust to make it even more sinful, and used whole milk.  It was very creamy and yummy.  We will use this recipe again!

First bite and this pie is great, but after just a couple bites it is way to strong.  I guess if you like super rich chocolate this might be good.  I think I will stick to my old fashioned chocolate cream pie recipe.

If you are looking for a super-chocolaty chocolate pie this is for you.  This was the first pie i've ever made and it turned out great(except I didn't have whole milk, so mine was at first a little runny, but it thickened up nicely despite this).

I loved this pie.  It was closer to a dark chocolate.  We tried it in regular pie crust and again in a graham cracker crust.  We preferred it with the graham cracker crust with homemade whipped topping.

This pie tasted so amazing I will NEVER buy pudding mix again. I added it to an oreo crust YUM!
Other reviewers were correct that this was more pudding than pie. But who cares about looks when it tastes as amazing as this did. Add to a bowl for awesome pudding or add to a shell if you don't care that it's puddingy.

My pie set up really well.  Some of the reviewers said their pie was sloppy but mine was very firm and did not fall apart upon cutting.  The taste was not as good as I had expected.  I could almost taste the unsweetened chocolate.  Maybe it needed a bit more sugar.  I don't know.  I think I will look for another recipe when I make chocolate pie again.

This was OK but didn't turn out great for me. I didn't have vanilla so I wonder if that would have made a big difference. It would've been good in a sweet crust, i didn't like it with a normal flaky crust. It was too dull for me. I won't make this again.

This was the BEST!!!I took the advice from others and used 2 cups 2% milk and 1 cup 1/2 and 1/2. I boiled it alittle longer to make sure the sugar was disolved and used a chocolate cookie crust. I read about people saying to use whole milk but I had no problem with 2%. Just take your time and alittle bit more boiling isn't going to hurt. Mine didn't run or ooze. It was so thick the first piece was a pain to get out. I let it sit in the fridge for about 24 hrs. My family loves chocolate and not one said it was "too chocolaty". Topped with cool whip when served and with 11 people the whole thing was gone that night!! Thanks for the wonderful pie.

This was the easiest pie to make.  I served it at a family party and recieved many compliments.  I didn't change anything and it came out perfect.

I thought this pie was a little more work to make than it sounded, but it is worth it! The key to getting it to set up right is to use whole milk and one egg white in addition to the 4 egg yolks. I also let it boil for a few minutes longer than the recipe called for. Do not attempt to cut the pie for at least 24 hours. I left mine in the fridge with the saran wrap on it for 24 hours, and when I cut it, it was perfect. Use a really sharp knife too, that will help.  I also used the Ghirardelli 60% chocolate chips, because I love really dark chocolate, and it was terrific!  I will definitely be making this again.

Very tasty pie! Got rave reviews from all! Actually very easy to make. If anyone felt it was too thin, they did not cook it long enough. Served with homeade whipped cream and a few mini morsels on top. Lovely dessert!

loved this pie. I used Ghiradelli 60% bittersweet chocolate and semi sweet chips and the family was even licking the pan as soon as I poured in the shell. This will move into the recipe box.

Decadent and delicious! I really appreciated the fact that the custard thickened quickly - not like some recipes that leave you stirring endlessly. 
For a yummy variation, use a graham cracker crumb crust, pour in half the custard, slice three bananas and lay them on the custard and then cover with remaining custard. YUM!

Wow, yum!  I didn't have unsweetened chocolate, so used semi-sweet and decreased the sugar to one cup.  I used a chocolate cookie crust, just to add more chocolate.  I also strained the mixture before pouring into the pie crust.  An excellent Valentine's Day dessert!

Totally awesome!! I was looking for a chocolate pie other than the "pudding and cool whip" variety. It was simple, yet tasted gourmet. I used 2 cups 1% milk and 1 cup half and half. The texture/consistancy was perfect.
Thanks for sharing!!!

Great texture but horrible flavor.  It was waaayyy too much for children and most adults didn't like it.  It had a really strong aftertaste that was very unenjoyable.  I'll go back to my standard Betty Crocker Recipe cream pie.

If you're looking for a double-good chocolate pie recipe, this is IT!  

I put the filling in a store-bought shortbread crust and it was a huge success at a family gathering. This is well worth the effort.

The flavor of this pie will make your eyes roll back into your head!  I made a few changes: I reduced the sugar to 1 1/4 cups because, based on other reviews, thought it might be too sweet.  I was running low on milk so used fat-free 1/2 & 1/2 and used 2 oz. semi-sweet chocolate instead of chocolate chips.  I was in the middle of melting this mixture when I realized I had only 3 eggs but continued on nevertheless.  The result was a very soft pie (which was most likely the result of lacking an egg yolk) but so rich and yummy my son licked his plate (behind my back, of course!)  Thanks Corwynn...really enjoy your recipes!

This pie was very rich and chocolaty - very delicious. I used a chocolate store bought crust and I think it added to the decadence. I will definitely make this one again!

This was a big hit with my husband and very easy to make. My only suggestion is to use a deep dish pie shell instead. I couldn't fit all of the filling in the pie shell.

Great chocolate pie. Was very popular among my family. The chocolate is very rich, however, can spill out of shell depending on how you cut the pie. Definitely a pie to try.

What can I say...this is the most amazingly delicious chocolate pie I have ever tasted!! I used cool-whip on top but think I might do real whipped cream next time. I used "no roll pie crust II" from this site and it couldn't have been easier. My 80 year old mother (known for her lady-like manners) was caught eating it with a spoon right out of the pan this past Thanksgiving!!

Great recipe, very rich and chocolatey. It would be very easy to modify this to suit your sweetness, using 3 oz. bittersweet chocolate and 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate, for example. It set perfectly, just make sure you could cook it on the stovetop long enough, make sure it's actually bubbling and getting really thick, then it needs to set in the fridge for several hours to set up.

This is amazing! Has a smooth deep rich flavor. I followed directions exactly as written. Will definitely make this again. You won't go wrong with this one.  However, I must have used the wrong size pie shell since I had a lot of filling left over. Though it made for some excellent pudding, next time I will use a deep dish prebaked pie shell.  Thanks for sharing such an awesome recipe!!

This turned out really well. I do recommend using a deep dish pan and crust. I didn’t have quite enough corn starch so I used some flour and it worked fine. The chocolate flavor was great. This will be my standby recipe. I used the 4 egg whites and made a meringue to top it off.

I made two changes to this recipe; I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk and used a graham cracker crust instead of a regular pie crust. Absolutely Fantastic! To those who say it was a loose pudding I suggest you didn't have it at a boil long enough or you skimped on the corn starch. It's not a difficult recipe (be sure to temper the eggs so they don't cook on you!!). If you like a rich chocolaty dessert - this is it!!

I made it with strawberries,  and melted marshmallows, it was delicious. I will definitely make it again. Though I do recommend leaving it in the fridge for longer than 4 hours. Mine turned out a little custardy.

I’ve used this recipe several times now with NO changes. It always turns out perfect! It is very “chocolatey”, dark & smooth. Leave the recipe alone, don’t change anything & it should be just fine.  We love it!

Followed the directions and had no problem with it setting.  You really need to whisk it constantly to get it to firm.

This is a delicious, rich, very chocolatey pie. We made it for Christmas Eve and it was a hit. Served with whipped cream, it's like homemade chocolate pudding in pie form. Will definitely make again!

I followed someone’s advice below and used regular semi sweet and unsweetened chocolate instead of chocolate chips. I changed the ratio to 4 oz of each and it will still plenty sweet. I also made it with half and half, which I don’t recommend unless you want it really fudgy. I will make this again, but will use whole milk instead.

I made this pie for Thanksgiving. I followed the directions to the letter. When I poured it into the pie crust it was very thick and tasted wonderful.  When I got the pie out of the refrigerator after dinner, it had liquified! How does it go from thick to like chocolate milk? So disappointed.  I cooked the filling per instruction.  I was so looking forward to and so were my chocolate loving friends.

This is my first thanksgiving away from home (I'm studying in the United Kingdom), so I made this pie as a part of a thanksgiving feast for my British friends. It is absolutely delicious and turned out so well! I will definitely be making this again next year.

Lost my Aunt Vera's recipe so I looked in All Recipe and found this.  It is to die for yummy ! Equal in taste to my Aunt Vera's recipe (and I even  forgot the vanilla). It seemed like it took forever to thicken, probably because I doubled the recipe.

I followed the directions as it said, but it never thickened. After chilling in the fridge for a day, the 'pie' had a consistency like thin pudding. Maybe I should've cooked it longer than the recipe said? The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because it DOES taste good.

I make this pie every year at Thanksgiving and Christmas. My entire family loves this pie. I altered the recipe slightly and use 2 cups of half and half and 1 cup of milk.

I spend the money and buy higher quality chocolate chips and bakers chocolate. I don't use the cheaper nestle chocolate chips. This makes a huge difference in the taste.

I see a lot of people complaining that the pie does not set and is too loose. I kind of have the opposite feeling that the pie is too stiff. I actually cut back on the flower.

This is a rich pie. If you don't like your pies being rich don't bake this one. If you do, try it, you will enjoy.

My husband said this was better than my Mema's chocolate pie!! Thanks so much for sharing the recipe. Very easy for a rather seasoned Cook. I usually am a bar or cake baker, so pies are a little intimidating for me. This one was great. Will make it again. I can say that a first-timer in the kitchen might have problems with this.

Very quick, tasty, and inexpensive to make. Very substantial pie!!! I loved the way it stacked toward the center when poured into the crust!!! No creeping over the edge of the crust for this filling! I taste-tested it tonight and my husband can't wait to dig in tomorrow after work LOL!!!

I made this as instructed the first time and it was good, but the second time I just skipped the crust and poured the filling into little cups.  Much better, the crust was a distraction from the chocolate goodness.  This is soooooo rich.  If you don't know the meaning of "too rich", make this recipe.  The quality of the results is going to depend on the quality of the chocolate you put into it, so go ahead and get the good stuff.   Also, if you are on a diet and planning to alter this to use low-fat ingredients- don't, that defeats the purpose of this recipe.   It's crazy rich, so you won't need to eat very much of it to be satisfied!

This pie was amazing. I made it for thanksgiving this year, following the recipe exactly, and was specifically asked to bring it again for Christmas dinner, along with the recipe. I had no trouble with it setting up. You just have to make sure you cook the chocolate for as long as it says even if it looks done before that.

My sister served this chocolate pie along with her other desserts at Thanksgiving this year. She is an expert cook, and while everything she serves is a success, this has to be the most incredible chocolate pie she has ever served. I will definitely be serving this over the holidays myself.

My Mom used to cook chocolate pies, then lost the recipe. After looking long and hard, this is it. Brings back lots of memories. For those that say it is too loose, just keep chocolate on the burner just a little while more and keep stirring, it will thicken.

I have made this for the past 5 years for Thanksgiving. I have to make 2 for each place I visit (= 6 pies!) These are always the first to go. I have not had any issues with it being too loose as I saw another review state. This is the best chocolate pie I have ever had. I don't make any changes to the recipe. The shells I do mix up. Some times I use the roll out, sometimes I use a chocolate crust. 
Thank you for the great recipe!

The chocolate was very thick. I love chocolate and I've been looking for something like a chocolate creme pie. This was as close as I could get to a creme pie. Thank you so much for this recepie. I will surely make this again!

It was way too loose and the only way I could get it to become a little more stiff was to freeze it.  The taste was super awesome.  Just couldn't keep it to hold.  I read all the other reviews and followed the recipe exactly again and see what happens.  If anyone has any advice, PLEASE post it.  I'm really confused.

I used 1 1/4 cup sugar and did not add any of the chocolate until finished the cooking part. Just stir in after taking off heat. Also used 2 tsp vanilla and added 1 T of butter with the chocolate and vanilla.

We have made these pies for the last 2 Christmas Seasons and we love them. I follow the recipe using GOOD chocolate and it works perfectly every time.  The only thing I do differently is divide the filling into 2 different pies and top one with whipped cream and one with meringue.  The chocolate is so rich and creamy that the thinner layer is just perfect!  We will be making these every Christmas!!

Everybody loved it, the taste was good... could be a little thicker, it did not stay in "pie" shape once it was served on a plate, has the consistency of a thick pudding. Also it was a little gritty (I boiled it as directed). It was less gritty the second day when eaten as leftovers.

Delicious. I discovered after starting the recipe that I did not have unsweetened chocolate, so I substituted 6 tbsp cocoa and 1 tbsp margarine. Turned out great--this was the Thanksgiving pie that was my favorite.

This was my first attempt at a pudding pie from scratch and it turned out amazing! (I wish I had made 2 of them so there would be more leftovers.)  :)  My family has always just used regular boxed pudding, which is good, but this was definitely a step up and easier than I thought to make. Definitely a keeper, I will never use the boxed pudding again.  My only deviation from the recipe was use semi-sweet baking squares, as I didn't have any unsweet.  It was probably slightly sweeter than the original, but I topped with a generous layer of whipped cream to balance it out.

I brought dessert over my friend's memorial day party, everyone loved it.  It definitely tastes like rich chocolate and not like the chocolate-type flavor pudding found in other chocolate pies.

I followed the recipe exactly except i used 2 cups of milk, 1 cup of half and half (as suggested by someone else).
I should also mention that i used extra large egg yolks which might make a texture difference if you are using regular [smaller] egg yolks.

This pie came out really well.  It is very rich, and very sweet.  I would recommend cutting back on the sugar just a little.  Other than that it was great.

I was trying to replicate an old family recipe that has been lost. I substituted 4 squares of baker's semi-sweet for the chips and kept one of the egg whites to stiffen it a bit, but otherwise stuck to the recipe. Delightful. I recommend melting the chocolate in a half-cup or so of the milk before combining. And if you don't have whole milk, you can use 2 1/2 cup 1% and 1/2 cup cream.

I loved the very chocolatey flavor of this pie.  I followed the directions exactly (and used whole milk) but mine did not set up hard enough.  After 30 mins. sitting on the table in an air-conditioned room, it started to melt.  Still tasted good though...

This was a hit in a house full of chocolate lovers.  I didn't see the need for so much sugar so I only added one cup but followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  I used whole milk and didn't have any problems... wasn't runny or gritty as some previous reviewers noted.  Creamy chocolate heaven.

Very good!!  I only had semi-sweet chocolate, so I cut out a 1/2 cup of sugar, and I thought it tasted great.  I covered it in whipped topping, and it definitely needed it because it otherwise has a very rich chocolate taste.  The whipped topping helps cut the chocolate a little.

This pie was awesome! The only question I have is which kind of milk to use? Because I used 2% and it was kinda gritty instead of smooth.

This is a great pie.  My husband and I are dark chocolate lovers and have never had a chocolate pie that we really like -- too milk chocolaty.  Anyway, keeping in mind that we like dark chocolate, I will decrease the amount of sugar next time.  It was a little too sweet for me.  I also whipped up some heavy cream with a few TLBS of powdered sugar.  Yummy!

This is the BEST chocolate pie I have ever tasted.  It's sinfully rich (my kind of pie), and when I served it at a recent party my friends went wild for it.  I was asked for the recipe by many.

This filing was terrific and easy to make. I used the basic pie crust recipe from this site in addition to a whipped cream recipe from this site. It was just like those wonderful pies that you get at a church gathering or a terrific old time diner. Very Good

This is a decnt enough 'pie' for a quick chocolate fix but I daresay you could buy some pudding mix and a pie shell - VOILA same thing.  Not really spectacular, maybe something you could claim as home made chocolate pudding.  
It did satisfy my chocolate craving but I won't be sharing with guests and I was the only family member (par the little ones) who seemed to enjoy it - maybe I was expecting something amazing seeing as it had 5 star reviews :(

Wow! This was awesome. Used semi-sweet chocolate as that's what I had on hand. Also was a little short on chocolate chips so made up the difference with about 1/4 cup of peanut butter chips. Yummy!

Utterly fantastic.  Wonderful chocolate cream pie. I got my father to try some and he really liked it, which says a lot because he does not like cream pies.  Good Job!

Yummy! Made this pie for Thanksgiving with my boyfriend and his family. It was a huge hit. They are big chocolate pie fans. Very rich and creamy. I used a graham cracker crust and really liked that. I'm sure a regular crust would be good too though. Will be making this again for sure.

Almost the whole pie was eaten on thanksgiving day! I only had semisweet chocolate squares, and I don't know enough about chocolate pies so i added an extra half square but i don't think it needed it. I have never made chocolate pie before but this will probably be the only recipe i ever use.
