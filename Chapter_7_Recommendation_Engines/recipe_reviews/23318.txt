I made this and poured it over chicken breasts, and baked it for 25-30 mins at 350. It was really really good! I served it with some pasta tossed in parmesan and garlic butter. Really tasty, and quite quick too, which is always a bonus. I will make this again. Thanks Sara for this really good sauce!

I cut out the green onion because I have some picky eatter in my house and added a teaspoon of dijon mustard to give the sauce a little punch!

It was amazing over simple over baked salmon.

Yum! I did about a half batch (I say 'about' because I didn't measure anything!). Around Â½ cup sour cream, maybe 3 or 4 TBS mayo, close to 2 tsp dried dill, about 1 TBS lemon juice, and I omitted the green onions and put maybe 1/4 tsp onion powder. We're out of green onions and my daughter isn't keen on biting into onion bits. :) Oh, I also added a couple shakes of salt and pepper. A very good dip right away, it will be excellent in a couple hours. Thanks for sharing, Sara!

this was great, I used it as a layer in a layer salad, instead of salad dressing.  Not a leaf of lettuce was left.

This was great!  I used light sour cream and light mayo and it was still great, however I added a little salt and for some reason I threw some dried parsley in too.  (And I forgot the green onions until the last minute.)  I mixed it up and topped some salmon filets with it, let it chill for 30 minutes and then cooked it.  I served a little extra on the side as well and it was great, and there was a lot leftover which came in handy for dipping baby carrots while waiting for the salmon to cook :)

My husband asked me to find a dill sauce recipe for our chicken fingers we had last night and this is the one that I ended up making.  As I had never had dill sauce before I didn't know what it was supposed to taste like so my husband did the final tweaking.  He ended up adding about 1T of honey and it turned out quite nice.  I also halved the recipe cause I wasn't initially sure how it would turn out and I wish I would've made more!

This recipe is better with only one tsp of dried dill, one whole green onion, 1/2 cup mayo (helmans). Whipped in a blender for about 1-2 minutes, sit in the fridge over night.  Excellent on Salmon or with Smoked Salmon, or just vegetables.

The only thing I did different with this was to reduce the amount. It goes well with just about any fish. When I need something quick I make a fish sandwich of fish sticks on a hamburger bun and I use this sauce. Makes a good quick sandwich.

This made a great chip/veggie dip, though it seemed a little too lemony for that purpose.  I will lower the amount of lemon juice next time.  If you're using it for fish, I think the lemony flavour would be perfect, though.

Good Stuff, especially served with a crabcake or oven fried catfish sandwich. I omitted the sour cream and added cajun seasoning and minced garlic. Good clean taste. Thanks.

This was so easy and delicious.  I used the full amount of dill and thought it was just right and I added a little sugar to sweeten some.  It was wonderful served with my salmon and steamed veggies tonight.  Will definetly make again!

I decided to make this sauce as the recipe directed so I could fairly score it.  It turned out great, everyone liked it. Spread it onto Alaska true cod as it was baking.  Gave the fish such a nice flavor.  I agree with other reviewers, this sauce could be good on a variety of dishes, even as a topping for baked potato.

Delicious!  I did add a little bit more lemon juice because I had a very juicy lemon - but otherwise,  I made as directed.  We had it on Grilled Salmon first and two days later we tried it on Crab Cakes.  One of our guests, who was five, finished it off on her Tater Tots.  I'd say it was a winner all around!

I really loved this!  I think it would be great with many things.  Used as a dip, sauce, dressing, over top of potatoes, etc.  I was wanting to make some sliced grilled turkey wraps with cucumbers and veggies, and used this sauce to dress them up.  It was delicious.  It gets better when it is prepared ahead of time and sits for an hour or two.  I added in a touch of garlic powder and used a little greek yogurt in place of some of the sour cream to lighten it up.  Otherwise I made it as stated and it was great.  Thank you for the recipe.  I will have to try over top of roasted potatoes next time!

Easy, I had all ingredients on hand. Added a bit of Dijon mustard as another user had suggested. Perfect.  Using for a dip for oven roast potatoes

I made this and served it with pan seared salmon.  It was excellent.  I left out the onion and only used 1/2 cup of mayonnaise (Best Foods).   I didn't think it had too much dill, but then I often add extra dill to dips.

This dip is so good! I've made it twice now in the span of a week. I've made it with yellow onions finely chopped and no lemon. The first time I made it, I had it over salmon and mashed potatoes. This time we are using it as a chip dip and over perogies. This is definitely a new favorite!

Added 1/4 tsp onion powder instead of green onions, 1/8 tsp salt, 1/8 tsp celery seed, and used only  Tbsp mayo (instead of 2) to 1/2 C sour cream and 2 tsp dill weed.  Excellent flavor, just adjusted to my taste.

This is really good.  I've also used Kefir instead of sour cream and it worked great.  Use it on fish and salmon patties

Didn't think this was good.  Tasted too much like mayonnaise and not like the dill flavor I was hoping for.  Perhaps this is because I used Miracle Whip.

This dill sauce is great for salmon or as a vegetable dip. I used fresh dill instead of dried. I made this with Garlic Salmon. It has all the same flavors: dill, green onions and lemon. It was my first time making salmon and it turned out perfect.
