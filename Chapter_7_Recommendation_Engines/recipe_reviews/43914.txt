Easy and good recipe. Recipe isn't clear so here's the clarification:
Chop all of the strawberries. Set 1/3 aside and cook the other 2/3. After cooking, combine all strawberries back together for your topping. 
Some like to puree the cooked topping before adding the fresh strawberries back into it. I just use a whisker to smash them up while they're cooking - That way I don't dirty my whole blender :)

I use this to top white cake and angel food cake instead of the nasty store-bought glaze.

The directions seemed a bit confusing to me, but I needed a place to start.  Here is what I did to come up with a topping for the New York Cheesecake III on this site:

*  I didn't have fresh strawberries on hand, so I used a 16oz. bag of frozen strawberries.  I started by cutting them all up into smaller chunks.

*  I added 3/4 of the strawberries into the saucepan along with the sugar.  I started to cook this on medium and let it go, stirring from time to time, for about 25 minutes.

* Next, I used an immersion blender to smooth the mixture out.

* Finally, I added the remaining stawberries and let them cook for about 3 minutes.  Added the vanilla at the very end.

This was the hit of the toppings I supplied with the cheesecake.  The amount of sugar worked very well for 16oz of strawberries - not too tart, not too sweet.

This couldn't be easier and is so pretty! Delicious over cheesecake, ice cream or pound cake, this is equally as good prepared with frozen strawberries as well as fresh. For a little variation, I sometimes like to add a little berry liqueur such as Creme de Cassis or Chambord, but if you ask hubs this is perfect as is! On this occasion I used this to top "Perfect Cheesecake Everytime" and found that for this purpose I wanted the topping thicker so I thickened it with a bit of cornstarch and it was just what I was after. Also, since the strawberries I used this time were HUGE and very meaty, I mashed them coarsely and added a few drops of red food coloring to make the sauce more vibrant red.

I made this recipe this morning early for Saturday morning pancakes. My son likes the strawberry pancakes that Shari makes, but I can't justify paying $5 for something I can make better at home. This doubles really well and is simple enough for the kids to help make. Plus, it tastes better than the Shari's topping. IMO. I'll for sure make this again. UPDATED REVIEW: I have made this strawberry topping over and over again. I usually always double it, I use organic strawberries and pure vanilla extract. Besides using as a pancake topping, I like making this as a cheesecake topping. Specifically, Cheesecakemama's Perfect Cheesecake Everytime. Whenever I pair those two recipes together, people always ask for seconds and the recipes.

Wow what a great recipe!! I was a little confused by the direction but I figured it out. I made it a little different because I dont really like mushy strawberries. I took about 1/3 of the berries and sat them aside, I used the other 2/3 in the recipe whole. I cooked the sauce until it was as thick as I like it (maybe about 10 minutes)Than I took everything in the pan and pureed it in a blender. After that I added the 1/3 strawberries I had sitting aside to the sauce.
This way the chucks of strawberries in the sauce are not so mushy.

This recipe was easy and practical but the really good news is that it also worked with blueberries.  In fact, it turned out even better with blueberries!  I used the exact same measurements and directions for the blueberry version and the result was an delicious even more professional-looking topping than the strawberry one.

I made this to top Chantal's New York Cheesecake on this site.  It was delicious!  Although I was a little confused by the directions, but here's how I ended up doing it: I cut up 1/3 of the strawberries and set the rest aside.  I cooked the sugar/strawberries/vanilla as directed until the sauce thickened but then pureed all of it.  Sliced the rest of the strawberries and mixed it all together.  Chilled in the fridge and then topped the cheesecake.  Delicious!

Yum! Made this for strawberry sundae as desert. My 3 year old loved it. Quick tip for cleaning the strawberry: use a plastic straw (not the really flimsy ones though) and poke the strawberry at the bottom and push through. The stem along with the core of the strawberry should come out easily. :)

I could eat this with a spoon, I love it that much.  I cook it on a much lower heat for a longer period of time and I am generous with the vanilla as well.  A stick blender directly into the pan saves on clean up.

This was very easy and worked great over cheesecake.  It did need a bit more sugar and some cornstarch to thicken it.  It also could have used some red food coloring to make it a deeper red color which I didn't have and sadly it could have used.....

2011-02-20  The recipe ingredients were doubled and cooked until thickened.  After pureeing the cooked mixture & tasting it, I decided not to add in more sliced strawberries.  The vanilla extract gave an unusual flavor & would not have been my first choice for flavoring the sauce.

I LOVE this recipe, though I cook half the strawberries, mashing only slightly as they cook (no need to bother with the blender) then add the other half once removed from the stove. Also, we like it better with half of the vanilla.

Fantastic over ice cream!  I sliced all the strawberries, nearly halved the sugar, added just a *tiny* bit of flour, and let the whole mix simmer for 20 or 30 minutes.  The slow, low cooking eliminated any need to use the blender, and the let the flavors develop nicely.  I'll never buy pre-made fruit topping again.

For any health nuts out there, this also works very well with 1/3 cup agave nectar instead of the white sugar! Very tasty!

WOW! amazing.... my only issue was I didn't make enough! We used it on our waffles in the morning and on our sundaes that night. All gone. Next time I will double the recipe. Easy to follow- and absolutely delicious. Reminds me of my moms yummy homemade strawberry jam!  I cut up most of the strawberrries to cook with sugar,  used my flat blender right in the pan as others suggested- and added the rest of the strawberries at the end. I love the strawberry chunks!  You can do whatever you prefer-make it thin like sauce or chunky. this is a fabulous recipe! I agree with other reviewers, you could use frozen strawberries too.

This is getting 5 stars as I made it.  I agree that this recipe is poorly written.  After reading the reviews, I did basically what OC Cook did.  I chopped all my berries, reserving about 1/3 of them.  Gently simmered the remaining berries with the sugar for about 25 minutes.  I used my emersion blender to puree them and then added back the reserved strawberries.  I simmered the whole thing for another few minutes.  My sauce was really thicker than I liked, so I thinned it with water until I had the desired consistency.  I also wanted a vibrantly colored sauce, so I added quite a bit of red food coloring until I achieved the color I wanted.  The taste is excellent and I would make this again the same way.

I always had a hard time getting the sauce right on the cheese cake , but this recipe is fail proof especially after I chill the cheesecake this sauce holds very well, I had to add more sugar though to get the desired taste.

Very yummy.  I added some Grand Marnier as I was cooking the sauce. Wow!  I also added some fresh, uncooked strawberries to the final product and served over a homemade NY Cheesecake.  Very good.  I think next time I would not cook the sauce for quite as long.

I agree that the directions are confusing but I looked up "most helpful" reviews and got some clarification. I mashed 2/3 of the strawberry after cooking in the vanilla and sugar instead of pureeing in a blender. Served with Chantal's NY Cheesecake.

This is one of those recipes that I can't believe I haven't made before.  So few ingredient, yet so very yummy.  I served this warm on our pancakes and french toast for breakfast and it is scrumptious.  Thankfully, I still have a little leftover in the fridge to use on top of other recipes (maybe the cheesecake that I'll be making later this week.) I did have to use thawed frozen strawberries because strawberries here are not very ripe and very expensive. A definite keeper that I will turn to over and over again!

Amazing!  Spoon a bit over cottage cheese, and its just like those bowls you buy at the store, for a fraction of the cost. Cant wait to experiment with peaches & blueberries!

I haven't seen a "pint" of strawberries forever, so I used a 1-pound package.  If you're using berries out of your garden, these were my equivalents: 1 pound of berries yielded 1 1/2 cups of coarsely sliced berries that I simmered with the sugar and vanilla, AND 1 cup of diced strawberries that I stirred in after I blended the cooked mixture with a stick blender.  This was delicious--it wasn't too sweet and didn't need artificial red food color added.  I multiplied the batch for use on ice cream sundaes for teacher appreciation week, and it was a bigger hit than the squeeze chocolate topping.  I can't wait to try it on waffles.

I needed a strawberry sauce topping on my homemade cheesecake.  It was Christmas eve and the grocery store was completely sold out of strawberry topping in the frozen food section.  Thank goodness I was able to find frozen strawberries and this absolutely wonderful recipe.  The three ingredients are excellent.  The only thing I did to enhance flavor was to add 3 teaspoons of Grand Marnier liqueur.  If you want to make the sauce thicker, you always have the option of adding a teaspoon or two of corn starch.  I used 2/3 of the package of strawberries and after all the ingredients were added and cooked, I used an immersion blender to turn everything into a fine puree.  Then I added the remaining strawberries and turned off the burner.  I took the cheesecake and strawberry topping to a Christmas party today.  All the guests raved about my cheesecake and strawberry topping.  I'm delighted to say goodbye to store brand strawberry topping!

I used 16oz frozen strawberries. Wish I would've only cooked 2/3 of the strawberries instead of 3/4 so that it would've been thicker. Overall pretty good. Was a hit with Chantal's cheesecake

Excellent recipe.  I used blueberries instead of strawberries because that's what I had in the fridge.   Made a double batch to serve it over the most delicious cheesecake and it was a PERFECT pairing.  Thank you for a wonderful and easy recipe.  No more store-bought artificial toppings.

This was an excellent addition to my home made cheesecake. In fact, I am constantly hounded to bake cheesecake because my family loves it and although I used the exact same recipe as always, they said this was the best cheesecake I have ever made (must of been the topping)Thank you for sharing, this is a definate keeper. One note, I doubled the amount of fruit called for and it was YUMMY!!!!!

This is tasty, but I skipped the blender and just used a potato masher in the pot and it was a whole lot less mess with all the good taste (which is high priority to me :o)

This is wonderful! And, it is so quick and easy to make to. I used 1 1b of strawberries because that is how they usually come now. And, to make it easier I used a hand emulsion blender one of my favorite kitchen tools.  I served it over vanilla ice-cream. Much better than any store bought or restaurant strawberry sauce.

I bought a a 1/2 flat of overripe strawberries, had more leftovers than I expected & and wanted to make good use of them before they started to mold over. So I multiplied this recipe to handle 3 pints of berries, and WOW! 

This was very easy (especially using a hand blender directly in the boiling pot of berries & sugar) and far superior to any commercial prepared sauce or most restaurant sauces. Plus now my home smells incredible. ;-)

I'm going to keep a jar or two for myself - it's great on belgian waffles, or vanilla ice cream, and give a jar to another strawberry addict.

Supreme is right! I love this strawberry topping. I make this several times a year and very often during the summer (i love ice cream). This would be perfect on cheese cake too. This recipe is a keeper in my book!

This was heavenly!  Followed the directions exactly except used my immersion blender to puree, then added the vanilla and remaining chopped strawberries off the heat.  Served over slices of angel food cake for a low fat dessert.

I loved the recIpe. Husband loved It. I used teaspoon corn syrup and 1/4 cup Sugar.  .. recipe would have been fine as is though.  I did puree in blender after cooking.  I put sauce over Cheesecake-will post photo soon. I can see the sauce being used with biscuits and strawberry short cake.

We used this recipe to top our waffles.  The topping was wonderful!  I did double the amount of strawberries & vanilla, but didn't double the sugar.  I ended up adding 1 tablespoon + 1/3cup.  This is so easy and versatile, I'll be making this again.

I always keep some of this on hand. I purée the entire sauce since I don't like lumps of cooked berries. Recipe yields about a cup of sauce, which for me is about 10-12 servings, not 4. Freezes well also. Pour into an ice cube tray & thaw one at a time to use later.

This tastes amazing. Just the right amount of tart to sweet.  I followed another person's suggestion and cut all the strawberries.  Cooked 2/3 of them, and then added the last 1/3. Super easy my 4 year old was able to do it!

We really liked this sauce. It wasn't too sweet, which a lot of times you find with syrupy sauces. I loved the fact that some of the strawberries were left intact. I did cut all of mine in half because they were all so large. I served this with Mini Cheesecakes, but it would be excellent on pancakes, ice cream, etc. Thanks so much for sharing!

Cooking the berries really zaps the "fresh" flavor.  I prefer to simply blend some of the berries with the sugar and pour over some fresh berries, much better flavor.

I used to containers of strawberries and I let my topping simmer on the stove for quite some time. I used it while still hot as a topping for waffles.

Excellent! I used almost a full lb. of strawberries, cutting them all in half, & cooking 2/3 of them with the sugar and vanilla. I added the rest of the strawberries at the end along with 2 tsp. of cornstarch to thicken it up a bit.  Then I used a potato masher to mash it to a chunkier consistency. I might use a hair less sugar next time, as it's a little too sweet for me. But it pairs well with Chantal's New York Style Cheesecake. NOTE: I am updating this review to say that I made it with 1/4 cup of sugar and it was perfect! A big hit as usual.

Agree with others that the instructions aren't clear.  I think what the author meant by cutting some up is just to vary the size of the berries.  ALL the berries are supposed to go in the pot with the sugar and vanilla.    I Doubled the recipe to serve with (10) chocolate croissants and had some left over.  I did the corn starch to thicken as some others suggested.  Worked out great as well.  I don't have a blender so I used my food processor.  That worked out great as well.

10 stars! Only if I could give.... It was so super easy to prepare this luxuriously looking yet delicious topping sauce! I only added 1 tbsp of cornflour to thicken the sauce a bit with few drops of red colouring for a more professional and appealing look. Will be posting picture alongside with Chantal's New York Cheesecake (also from this site) very soon!

this was great!! i have already made six batches of this stuff and have served it to all of my relatives. the directions aren't all that clear so i made it like this: chop up ! pint of strawberries. Take 2/3 of them and pu them in a pot along with the sugar and vanilla. Cook for more than 5 minutes, stirring, untilthe berries have let out all of their juice. Then pour this into a blender and combine. Then pour this back into the pot and add the rest of the strawberries. Cook for 5 mins. Serve chilled.

A delicious and easy idea for dessert. Used frozen strawberries, as the fresh ones weren't the best. Thanks for the idea.

Great topping.  Really really sweet and I used a lot more strawberries than it called for so that it wouldn't cook down so much.  I like a bit of crunch in the berry like you were eating them fresh from the store!

I used frozen strawberries, excellent. The next time I made this recipe using frozen blueberries, excellent. My family love this recipe. You can not mess this recipe up. To make it a little thicker use cornstarch a little at a time, until its to your liking. 10 stars for taste & being easy to make. We put this topping on PANCAKES!! Oh and by the way, when I make this recipe, I put everything in a pot and let it cook.  I DID NOT USE A BLENDER TO PUREE. I let it cook until the fruit is soft and looks like puree and then refrigerate it until ready to use the next morning for breakfast. If you like bigger pieces of fruit, just add a few pieces the last few minutes of cooking. Yum!!

I made the Chantal's cheesecake recipe (THE BEST!!!) and I decided that I did not want to ruin it with some artificial store topping, I tried this recipe and let me tell you something...after I slice my cheesecake and poured this topping over OH MY GOD! it was a match made in heaven, I'm going to make it again for my pancakes.

I had to read and reread these directions many times. I was very confused about cutting all the strawberries or leaving some whole. I put this topping over lemon poppy seed pancakes. Excellent! Next time I will try adding some bananas in the sauce. Strawberry Banana Topping!

A definite 5 star recipe based on simplicity and taste! I found this recipe easy to follow. You can use this as a topping over any cheesecake recipe and also ice cream. Since I needed to use up some strawberries before they got bad so I decided to make a topping/glaze for a cheesecake recipe.  I used almost 2 cups of fresh strawberries, chopped and some halved. A great topping for any dessert!

Just made this--easy and YUM! tastes as expected and looking forward to drizzling over lemon cake..Though I think the "all recipes" pic is a little misleading. I pureed everything, so mine looked like  "lucky noodle"s pic, but even before the blender, mine wasn't as opaque as the pretty pic. Delicious either way!

this is a godsend. my bf LOVES strawberry everything... especially fresh strawberry topped pancakes like at the local diners. 

i made this exactly as instructed and poured over +Fluffy Pancakes+ recipe from Kris.-- Uh-mazing. 

Definitely impresses guests that it's made from scratch. Will make again and again!

Thanks Heislord5!! :)

I don't know if I did something wrong or what but it just didn't taste right and the color was not appetizing at all.

This recipe is great! I am sick on the ones that use so much other junk that you don't taste the strawberries. This recipe stays true to the strawberries. If you like the pure strawberry flavor, this is the topping for you! Also, it says 4 servings. I used 2 pounds of strawberries and it makes SO MUCH! I didn't add anything at all to the recipe. I'm sure with a higher yield, this could be a very low-cal, low-carb topping for those who are looking for one. I can't wait to make this with other fruits!

I modified this to make it Southbeach friendly. Basically all you had to do was replace the sugar w/ Splenda (or another SB approved sugar substitute). I used just a little under 1/3 cup of Splenda and I topped the rest of the 1/3 cup w/ some Xylitol. REALLY YUMMY!!!

We really enjoyed this over "Heavenly Angel Food Cake" with "Sweetened Whipped Cream!" I mashed it by hand but I think next time I will run it through the food processor to have a smoother sauce. I used 1/3 cup of sugar and I think next time I'll try 1/4 because it was very sweet.

I would give a 5 star for taste, but I had to reduce to a 4 star because the recipe did not  use any cornstarch to thicken which I feel it needed a bit of ...very good though !

This sauce is good with ice cream, pound cake, waffles, crepes, etc.  I cut back just a little on the sugar and vanilla, and I mash the strawberries a bit right in the pan with a potato masher.  No need to dirty the blender.  ;-)

Very easy and delicious. I chopped all the strawberries in half (and the big ones in quarter) and i blended about half of the cooked ones and juice. So when I finally mixed it all together, it was a thick syrup with chunks in it which was amazing. Great topping for cheesecake and icecream...

This is so simple to make...the taste is super yummy! I made this topping to serve with a white chocolate cheesecake, and it was fantastic! I used frozen strawberries, and they tasted like they were fresh in the sauce. Thanks so much for sharing!

This is 10 times better than just sweetened strawberries on your ice cream.  I pureed the whole batch, I prefer to have a smooth sauce.

Mmmm, mmmm... good! I made a double batch of this in lieu of the strawberry/glaze layer called for in TABKAT's strawberry angel food dessert (the idea of using pre-processed strawberry glaze didn't appeal to me at all). I can't believe how EASY this was to prepare! I followed HEISLORD5's directions to a T except for the puree step. I gently mashed my strawberries with a potato masher instead. I also added 1 T cornstarch dissolved in 1 T water to thicken a bit and several drops of red food coloring for a more intense red color (to mimic the glaze I would have otherwise used) as suggested by wifeyluvs2cook. One tip: use a sturdy straw to hull (i.e. stem) your strawberries. Simply push the straw up through the bottm and then through the top stem part. It works every time! Thanks for sharing :)

Absolutely delicious! My favorite breakfast is strawberry pancakes from IHOP and I swear this tastes exactly like their pancake topping! I used frozen strawberries and it still came out fantastic--can't wait to try again with fresh ones

I served this yesterday for our Easter lunch dessert.  I scooped French vanilla ice cream into an edible-type of cup.  I topped with the strawberry topping, and garnished with a small  chocolate peppermint patty.  The result was a restaurant-style presentation and taste with little effort.  I prefer to add strawberries into the puree.  Bravo!  Will make again and again.

Added less than an 1/8 tsp of fresh lemon zest.  Really perked up the fresh taste.

This recipe is a good base, but I did a few little changes.  I halved the strawberries and added sugar depending upon their sweetness.  I added about 1/2C of water and brought it to a boil only until the strawberries were slightly tender.  I then thickened it with a little bit of cornstarch solution.  It was great!  I put 1/2 a strawberry with a little bit of sauce drizzled ontop of the mini-cheesecake recipe found on this site with so many stars.  They were a big hit with my neighbor and family.

Just like everyone else claims, this is really good.  I served this over crepes along with whipped cream and they were fantastic. I gave it a few pulses with my hand mixer verses a blender. I have some left over that I'm waiting to try on top of ice cream.  Thanks for sharing.

Oh my...I didn't expect something so simple to taste so good!  The directions were not clear--but I had faith that the reviewers would clarify, and they did!  (Reserve 1/3 cup of the strawberries for the end, using the rest to make the sauce.)

If I had to rate this based on instructions, I'd give it 1 star...don't know how this one made its way out of AR editing.  But based on taste and ease of preparation, it's 5 stars.

This was amazing! I followed the recipe but just mashed instead of purée the first 2/3 of strawberries and added a little cornstarch. Once thick I added the remainder of strawberries. Topped our no bake cheesecake wonderfully! I will never buy pre made glaze again!

This was sooo good and very easy. It is very versatile too and can be changed to taste easily. I made this with fresh strawberries and poured over pancakes instead of using syrup. Delicious!! I will make this again!

The only reason I gave this four stars instead of five is because the directions were very confusing and didn't make much sense.  Nonetheless, the topping came out magnificent thanks to the suggestions of people who wrote reviews. Thanks everyone!

Easy and delicious! Thinly sliced strawberries, cooked and mashed the fruit until it turned a darker shade of red. Pureed entire batch. Made my dessert look and taste expensive!

I made this to top a cheesecake and it was delicious.  I used a sugar substitute to lower the calories.  I cut the strawberries into quarters and put them in the sauce pan with the vanilla and sugar substitute.  Once the "sugar" melted i used a potato masher to make it saucy but still leaving some nice chucks of strawberries.  Delish!!!!

I have used this for several years for a topping on cream cheese crepes, The only complaint I get is when I run out. I sometimes add lemon or lime juice to brighten the flavor.

This was fantastic! I wanted it just a little thicker and a deeper shade of red so added a small amount of cornstarch slurry and tad bit of red gel coloring. We are now looking for other recipes to make so we can use this on top of it. Thank you for sharing!! Update 7/7/10 - Thank you to member "redamber" for suggesting using this over cottage cheese to duplicate Breakstone Cottage Doubles! This tastes exactly like them. I love Cottage Doubles and this will save me a ton of money. Declicious...Great Idea!!

I just didn't like this recipe.  It wasn't pretty and the flavor was boring.  Other people (including my mom) really like it though.  I guess it's a personal preference.

Amazing. Simply cannot go wrong with this fast, easy, DELICIOUS topping! It would be the perfect topping for pretty much anything! I enjoyed it with pancakes--with a little thickening (cooking longer or cornstarch, perhaps), it would be wonderful on top of cheesecakes (otherwise, it would sort of pool and not be as pretty...but would still taste amazing...). Definitely make ahead of time to allow it to chill in the fridge. An easy go-to recipe!

Simple, quick, and wonderful. Fresh strawberries were expensive while frozen strawberries were on sale here at my local food cooperative (and I was doing a 1.5x recipe). So I used a 10oz. bag of frozen strawberries + 1/2 pint of fresh strawberries (other 1/2 pint used for garnish on the cheesecake). The frozen strawberries actually performed better because they broke down over about 10 minutes of simmering. I wouldn't have had to pulse the mix in a blender if not for the fresh strawberries that don't break down. Still absolutely delicious! I used 1.5 times the recipe as a marble swirl in New York-style cheesecake and it was spectacular! And I used my own homemade rum-based vanilla extract for an added kick! I WILL be making this again.

Delicious! Just made this to top Chantal's Cheesecake. I followed the suggestions of another reviewer: chopped all strawberries; cooked 2/3 of them, breaking them up while cooking; combined cooked and uncooked. Yummy and easy! Had to make myself stop eating it so I would have enough for that big ol' cheesecake.

The directions were a bit tricky ... so I used the measurements but did my own thing, that being said after topping my cheesecake with this I was in heaven.  The vanilla mixed with the strawberries (mine were just past the eating straight up stage) was suburb!

Wonderful topping but do wish the strawberries weren't so mushy. Next time I am going to cut all the strawberries in half. Cook only 1/3 of the berries in the sugar and blend that all together and then add the other strawberries at the end so they won't get mushy. Hopefully it works out well. I served this topping over hot milk cake (a recipe I got from my mother) and whip cream, tasted wonderful.

Yaayeaaah! Topped Chantel's New York cheesecake with this. If you decide to add cornstarch to get it to your desired consistency, remember to dissolve the cornstarch in a few teaspoons of water first or you will get lumps. But it will be delicious regardless!

This sauce was so easy and so good.  It was really sweet, but hey, it should be.  Be careful about how much you're pureeing.  The first time I made it, I pureed a few too many of the berries and it was a bit soupy.  (I like a few big strawberry pieces rather than just a sauce.)  The next time I didn't puree as a much and it was perfect!

The vanilla completely ruined the whole batch.  It went from smelling good to smelling like rancid strawberries when I added the vanilla. I used real vanilla extract (bought last week) in the exact measurements listed. What happened?

really good recipe, i found i had to cook mine a little longer, maybe because i like to thicken mine and i added just like 5 drops of lemon juice and some marshmallows, which makes a really nice texture!!

Time savers: Slice all the strawberries into the pan, and use a potato masher on them while they're cooking, after they've started to break down. Yay... skip the blender step! Also, mashing them leaves some berries still visible, so it's prettier, too.

Great recipe! I used 10 frozen strawberries, mashed with a potato masher while cooking, and blended to purée the big chunks...mmm...perfect! No need to cut frozen strawberries before cooking because they become soft when thawed. I cooked straight from the freezer. Everyone loved it....not too sweet and full strawberry flavor!

Fabulous topping!  Perfect amount of sweetness.  Fresh strawberries are not good in my area this time of year, so, I used frozen.   There was no need to blend since they are softer.  I just mashed in the pan with a potato masher.  Perfect over the cheesecake supreme recipe! 4/24/14 I made this again using fresh strawberries and it was SO much better.  I adjusted to our taste - 2 qts strawberries, 2/3 cup sugar and 1/2 tsp vanilla - perfect!

This recipe is not confusing.  It makes perfect sense.  It's delicious just as it's written.  Some people like to mix in fresh, uncooked and some people like it to be mushy and others enjoy it pureed or a little of each.  I, personally, did everything but puree the sauce.  But, I cooked all of the berries with the sugar and vanilla as written.

A great base recipe for making strawberry topping/sauce. I will play with it a little more depending on how I want to use it. making the recipe as directed makes it look like runny strawberry jam/jelly/preserves in my opinion. I suggest for a topping cook only half of the pint of strawberries.. add 1/2 teaspoon cornstarch while cooking... puree all of the cooked. cut the remaining fresh strawberries in half (or quarters if very large). pour pureed cooked over fresh. I personally don't feel you need the vanilla or any extracts.

It has good taste. I didn't follow the instruction exactly.. i puree all of it instead of just some and it turned out bubbly. It might be better if i had followed the instruction exactly.

I had to adjust this recipe, i used 1.5lb strawberries, 1/2 cup water, 1 tablespoon vanilla extract and 2/3 cups cane sugar, cooked for 10 minutes, pureed with a bur mixer, then added .5lb small straberries and 2oz water premixed with 4tsp corn starch to thicken, cooked for additional 5 minutes.

Loved this simple recipe so that I may indulge in one of my favorite treats.  I did however do a step different by cutting all the strawberries and adding them to the pot.  I mashed the fruit a little bit because I wanted it left a little chunky.  No worries cleaning a blender.  Will use over and over again in the future!

I made this topping for cheesecake. I followed other reviewers instructions and chopped all of the strawberries and left 1/3 out. I boiled the rest and used a masher to break them up. I only used 1/4 cup of sugar and I'm glad that I did, it was plenty sweet, any more would have been too much. I added the remaining 1/3 and cooked 1 minute longer. I also made cherry topping following this recipe and it came out great as well.

YUMMO!  This is delish!  The only change I made was to slice most of my strawberries because they were so big and I pureed a little more than 1/3.  I should have doubled the batch because it went so fast.  I served this with Cheesecake Pancakes.  Thanks for sharing!

Excellent! I doubled the recipe and only heated up a very few berries, mashing them with my potato masher to release the juices. I dissolved two teaspoons of cornstarch in a little bit of cold water and when the berries were hot I added the cornstarch mixture to  the thicken the berries. I waited until they cooled off a bit and stirred in the rest of the berries. I used a potato masher and mashed them slightly. I wanted the sauce rather thick for the cheesecake I was serving.  I also added a bit of red food coloring and it looked fantastic! Such an easy but elegant recipe. Thank you HEISLORD5

Perfect! I used frozen strawberries. I chopped them all into quarters or eighths and cooked 2/3 in the sauce pan. I used a whisk to smush those up while warm so I didn't have to use my food processor. The last 1/3 of the strawberries were added in at the end.  I let them cook with the faux-pureed syrup for 3 minutes.

i've been making this for a while, but i keep forgetting to do the rating/review.  this is a great recipe...the only thing i do differently is that i don't put it in the blender.  i cut all the strawberries, add the sugar, vanilla, and let it cook until the berries let out their juice and i'm done...love making this especially when strawberries are in season :)

we enjoy this recipe a lot. I added all my strawberries to the pan, and cooked them all until they were soft, and then poured it into my food processor for a smoother sauce. I have a son with a disability and the big chunks really bother him. We have poured this on french toast, angel food cake, pancakes, waffles, even stirred it into lemonade to make freckled lemonade. It's a simple go to recipe!

very yummy!  I cut up all of the strawberries and left 1/3 of them out.  I cooked 2/3 of them with the sugar and vanilla.  After I blended the mixture i added the remaining strawberries.

Very good and fresh-tasting. Mine turned out a little pink after pureeing, so I added a couple of drops of red gel coloring as suggested by other reviews. I also added a little lemon extract along with the vanilla and served on lemon scones with whipped cream. THANKS!

Mmmmmm...so good and so easy.  I didn't puree mine.  I just sliced the strawberries thin down the length of the fruit and then once the other direction down the middle.

This is a great recipe for sweet strawberry topping.  I had to add some corn starch to thicken it otherwise I think it would have run off the cheesecake after cutting it.  I mashed 1/2 a pint of fresh strawberries in a saucepan with the sugar. I left the other 1/2 pint sliced strawberries aside until the the mixture in the pan was hot anf boiled. Then I added the sliced strawberries to the pan, mixed it with the cornstarch slurry and spread over the cheesecake after cooling 20 mins.  Very good, the whole family enjoyed it!

I made this to top the New York Cheesecake III. It came out good but I think next time I'm going to nix the vanilla and reduce the amount of sugar. I was hoping for a more fresh strawberry taste but it came out a bit too much like a syrup. This recipe is a great place to start however.

This makes an outstanding topping for cheesecake.  I surprised my wife with it, and she loved it!  I refrigerated mine for about an hour before I drizzled it on top of the cheesecake, and it was wonderful.

I have used this recipe several times and I absolutely love it!  I, like another reviewer, prefer to leave out some of the strawberries until after I've blended the cooked mixture, since I really like larger chunks of strawberries.  I cut them into thirds or forths, depending on size and add them after blending the rest.  I continue to let them cook for a little while and add the vanilla at the end!  Delicious, especially over the New York Cheesecake III on this website!

Simple, easy, and oh so tasty!  For a nice filling for tarts or crescent rolls, add some cornstarch to thicken the mixture and don't put the strawberries in the food processer.

Outstanding! I used ONE POUND of SB, 2 t vanilla and 1/2 cup conf. suger. Cut all of the SB up into small chunks and then took out 1/3. Cooked the 2/3 SB w/suger then smooshed them with my hand masher. Then added vanilla and other 1/3 SB at the end. I lowered the heat a little a cooked another 5 minutes. Added a couple of drops of red food coloring too! I poured them over my homemade British Style Scones that I found on another recipe here. They were fantastic!

Came out great!  Couldn't believe how much liquid came out of just the strawberries!  Tripled the recipe to top an entire cheesecake, but cut back the sugar a bit.  Might have used a little cornstarch to thicken it, as it was a little runny.

This was a great sauce. I cooked a third of the strawberries for about 15 minutes and then blended until smooth. I then sliced the remaining strawberries and added to the sauce. I refrigerated the sauce to serve with mini cheesecakes from this site. For those who said the vanilla made the sauce taste a little off use 1 tsp of fresh lemon juice instead. This is a good sauce that can be served with pancakes, waffles, crepes, ice-cream, cake, etc.**update, after I took this out of the fridge I pureed the whole mixture and added chopped strawberries.

I don't have much experience making fresh fruit topping, and this was nearly perfect.  I only gave 4 stars because even with using 1/3 of the sugar it was almost too sweet for me... I can't imagine how sweet it would have been if I had used the full amount.

WOW!!! This was the hit of our family's Easter celebration. I tripled the recipe for our party of thirty people and served it over cheesecake. I ended up pureeing the entire batch, and I'm glad I did. It was perfect and I got nothing but rave reviews! My husband and I are very happy to have brought some home to serve over ice cream later.

This is a great topping for cheesecake.  Instead of pureeing the strawberries - I simply mashed them with a wooden spoon, and it came out fine!

This topping goes great with cheesecake.
It smells and taste wonderful. I did thicken it up by blending half of the mixture and adding an extra 1 1/2 cups of fresh strawberries.Thanks for the wonderful recipe:)

Very good, although i like to add some diluted corn starch to help thicken it up. One time the corn starch made it look kind of pink so i just added a couple drops of red food coloring and it worked great. I don't use the blender at all because the heat makes the strawberries soft and some of them actually "dissolve". I make this to top crepes, pancakes, waffles, and to serve with plain cheesecake ( i don't actually top the cheesecake with it but have a serving dish beside it for people to spoon on top if they wish to...and they do)

The strawberry topping was great,but it was too thin at first.
So I decided to puree more of the sauce then it was perfect.

YUM!  Was wonderful on crepes and Dutch babies.  The vanilla is such a nice  touch.  I have used the basic recipe to make toppings with blueberries, blackberries and raspberries.  All have turned out yummy. (For the blackberries I mashed them and removed some of the seeds.)

Yhis dang search  engine keeps giving me all the NOT ingredients, and none of the "want" ingredients.
 Out of 127 recipes, I have cakes, alcoholic drinks, slushies, ice pops, 9 SPECIFICALLY SAID NO ICE to eliminate beverages.,  out of 127 recipes, NOT   one using frozen strawberries, my #1 ingredient on the "WANT" LIST.  All recipes is turning into a piece of !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I tried the words, "sauce, topping, coulis UIt asked if I meant cousin for crikey sake!!!) and not a single topping, sauce or coulis using frozen strawberries.

It was O.K. but not great. There's something about cooked strawberries I'm not a huge fan of.  I started over again. This time I just made a simple syrup by boiling together 1/3 c. of sugar and 1/3 c. of water, for maybe 5 minutes until it thickened a bit. Then let it cool and added fresh sliced strawberries and mixed well. I thought that was much fresher tasting and the berries weren't mushy.

A great recipe, but I did it a little differently because I didn't have a blender. I used whole frozen strawberries. Once the strawberries were heated through I simply used a potato masher to mash them in the pan while they cooked. Also, I cooked the sauce on medium and the reduced to low-medium for the last 8 minutes or so.

This was a really good recipe, but I added a tablespoon of lemon juice to it and also instead of pureeing it, I decided to let it thicken and leave it whole because I love eating strawberries whole and I don't mind the seeds

Made the recipe just as described (after clarification in comments)- I just used my immersion blender to do a coarse chop thru my sauce on the stove after it was simmered (I love the chunky bites) - served it warm over Lemon cake with a dollop of whipped cream! Very tasty! Thanks for sharing!

I doubled the recipe. I reserved I/3 of sliced strawberries. Cooked remaining strawberries with sugar for 25 min stirring and mashing strawberries every now and then. Quick pulse in the blender, back on the stove top, added reserved strawberries and vanilla and cooked for 5min more. Smells so good while cooking and tasted great on a cheesecake!

Hi. I made this topping using *OC Baker's* recommendations using it as a topping for homemade angel food cake. My men said the cake was good but the strawberry topping was exceptionally great. This is a definite do-over. And I will try this with blueberries too.

This was totally easy.  I had everything (all 3 ingredients, can you believe that?!) available and ready to go.  Who woulda thought?  It tasted just like the stuff that comes on waffles at the restaurant.  For the record, I got lazy and used my hand-puree device while it was still cooking.  There are fewer chunks, but still it tastes the same.

Thank You!

Really tasty fruit topping. I made it as directed, except I just used a potato masher in the saucepan to get it to the consistency I wanted. It reminded me a bit of freezer jam, if you've ever had that. If I wanted to make a more elegant presentation, I would probably strain it, but it was great as is. I put it over cheesecake, but I think it'd also be perfect over pancake or waffles since it's not too sweet and has a fresh fruit taste.

I kept the strawberry's whole and got them simmering. Then I found about 2 shots of dark rum, sugar, and vanilla give it a delicious flavor. I then followed heislord's directions for cheesecake supreme and he's got that one down pat. Its always good to show up to a party with strawberry cheesecake!

I followed this recipe to the letter. It is not meant to be a strawberry pie filling, so don't expect that!  It comes out as a very tasty strawberry topping such as can be used on ice cream or pancakes and such.  WE LOVED IT!!!!  I will definitely use this recipe again...next time perhaps on my cheescake!  Thanks Heislord5!!!

This was good but much too sweet.  I used a pound of strawberries in the cooked mixture and a heaping 1/3 cup of sugar.

Awesome recipe!!! No changes were needed, followed method verbatim. I originally made this recipe for strawberry shortcake but now it's replaced boring maple syrup!

Super-easy to make.  I was amazed how cooking the strawberries in sugar yielded so much liquid.  I used a pound of fresh berries and would cut back the sugar a bit next time.  Hubby said it was delicious; served it over waffles.

Yes, the directions are confusing. This is a very simple strawberry topping we used for Angel Food Cake. It was a winner! Next time I will use a little bit less sugar. I did not blend into a puree.

Next time, I would only make 1/2 the recipe as this is a lot of topping.  It was delicious over a yellow poke cake with cherry and strawberry gelatin.  I froze the leftovers and they remained firm and tasty after defrosting.

Could this be canned?  Should I add lemon juice for acid?  It was very yummy, and I would love to just make a bunch at once and have it on hand.

This sauce was amazing!!! I made it the first time with fresh strawberries. The second time I made it with frozen strawberries and it still turned out well but not as good as with the fresh strawberries.

Excellent!  Tried it as suggested, but found it worked best for me using a 16 oz frozen package of strawberries, 1/2 c. sugar and 1 1/2 tsp vanilla.  I like a translucent strawberry glaze and found that pureeing the strawberries made the topping more like jam. After it cooked, I strained the leftover strawberries out which left me with a perfect strawberry topping!  Love it, will make again and again!

Used less vanilla, only a couple of drops and this went great on top of my strawberry poke cake, between the cake and whipped topping!  Super easy to do and the results are amazing!

Someone from Allrecipes should have edited this recipe for clarity before approving it for the website, hence the 4 stars.  I made it the way I thought it should be done, using the recipes ingredients as written, and found it to be exactly what I was looking for to top my angel food cake.  I had frozen a pint of fresh strawberries I bought on sale and so I used those.  The sugar to strawberry ratio was perfect for my taste and the vanilla was a  nice touch.

I wanted a topping for a pound cake and I used brown sugar instead of white.  The vanilla adds the right amount of flavor and surprisingly, this wasn't excessively sweet.  Very nice!

Great, it was just what I was looking for & turned out wonderful. Thank you to those who took the time to clarify about chopping all the strawberries, holding 1/3 to the side while cooking 2/3 and pureeing 1/3 of the cooked strawberries, then combining them all.

I stumbled upon this searching for a topping for mini cheesecakes for a friend's birthday.  Super easy, super tasty.  I'm not a fan of strawberry sauce, but even I enjoyed licking the spoon.

This recipe was awesome. The only change I did was squeeze 1/2 lemon in it to a add vitamin C so I could can it in a water bath afterwards. It was so yummy on our creamcheese pie (from here) and we had leftovers on ice cream weeks later.

Yummy! Directions weren't clear, so just to make things easier I chopped up all the strawberries and cooked them all, blending them after about 10 minutes. We ate it warm with crepes, and everybody loved it.

I was pleasantly surprised with this sauce as I was sure I would need cornstarch to thick it up, but it wasn't necessary.  I thought it was a bit too sweet so I would cut back on the sugar next time.  The directions seemed obscure so I appreciated other reviews.  I sliced all the berries, put 1/3 aside, smashed up the remaining 2/3 with a potato masher to release the juices and cooked as directed.  I put all the cooked berries/juice into my magic bullet to puree and added the set aside raw berries into this.  I refrigerated the sauce before using on cheesecake.  Would definitely make again!

I save this in my box to used for a special birthday breakfast and was startled when I found that my roommates ate all of the fresh strawberries and there was no more vanilla extract (cookie season =/),  So I ended up using frozen strawberries and strawberry extract, much different recipe but I am thankful for the guidance.  It was good!

My husband and I made this last night as a topping for vanilla ice cream and we loved it! It's easy to make and is very delicious (so much better than store bought strawberry topping)!

Wow - I could eat this stuff all by itself. I had this out for folks to top their "Perfect Cheesecake Everytime" with, and it was blissful. I chopped all the strawberries up pretty small, mashed them while cooking and added just shy of a tablespoon of cornstarch. Outstanding!

Ended up having to blend this, mashing didn't get the strawberries fine enough.  Great sauce, I topped "Chantal's cheesecake" with this sauce, and some ice cream.  Only thing I might try next time is to reduce the vanilla, the taste was too strong for me.  Maybe even worth trying an orange extra extract instead??

Ive made this twice. first time It was way too runny/watery. Second time I added a little cornstarch and it was way better. Heated all the strawberries in the saucepan, didnt split them up, and blended the whole thing in the blender.

So simply and yet wonderful! Took advice of other review and mashed in the pot as I simmered and then added 1/4 which I had  reserved for the whole berry look. Great!

Amazing how auch a simple recipe can be so good.  I added a smidgen of corn starch, to thicken it up a bit more, and a dash of lemon juice, to brighten the flavor, and make it not so sugary tasting...I also doubled the batch.

Delicious! When I was making it, my house smelled like a funnel cake! I just mashed up the strawberries while I had them in the pan... didn't bother blending them and it turned out perfect! I used it over Chantal's New York cheesecake and it tasted wonderful.

very good! i cut the recipe to two, and used probably about 9 large size strawberries. a great way to use berries that are about to go bad. i cut the berries into quarters and put about 2/3 in with the sugar and vanilla. i mashed them as they cooked with a potato masher, and added the rest of the strawberries for the last minute or two. a nice and tasty addition to our angel food cake!

What's not to like about this recipe??  It is great!  I didn't know how much is a 'pint' so I just used around 8 big strawberries. It made much more than I thought it would. The sauce turned out to be around 3 cups. I used this on Chantal's New York Cheesecake.  EXCELLENT RECIPE!  Next time I would cut back on the vanilla to maybe around 1/2 teaspoon. I can really taste it.   Thanks!

Really yummy! I used frozen strawberries and used this sauce to fill my baked apples and baked pears! I have also used it to top other fruit desserts! Update - I made this as a strawberry compute - I added some lemon juice and a bit of ginger and it was fantastic!

I used this with Chantal's Cheesecake as the topper, and it came out fantastic! The immediate taste of it is like candy, but once cooled off, it was just like the topping on a cake from the store. I love it, and will make again with future cheesecakes, ice cream, etc.

This was terrific.  I modified in the folowing ways.  Cut up all strawberries. Mix 1/3 of them in saucepan with vanilla and sugar. for about five minutes. Puree that and then mix the rest of the cut up strawberries into it. Delicious on shortcake or ice cream.

Perfect combination!  I used frozen strawberries, and mashed them as they cooked instead of blending it.  I don't like whole strawberries in sauces so it was perfect!  I also added more strawberries than the recipe suggested, but that was because I don't like things too sweet.  I'll be using this from now on as a base for all my fruit toppings!

I agree with past reviews in that the directions were confusing.  I ended up cooking 1/3 of my strawberries with the sugar and vanillla and then pureeing it.  I cut the rest of the strawberries in half and added them to the mix.  I used this as a topping for "Chantal's Cheesecake" (on this site).  It was delicious.  I would have given it 5 stars were it not for the confusing directions.

Loved this....yummo.  I mashed the strawberries as it cooked and skipped the blender.  It was just right.  I also made sure to put all the strawberries in.  Another point is that you can use older strawberries that are not so fresh any more to make this.

hmmm hmm hmm! I've made this a couple of times now to replace cherry sauce that I'd usually put on cheesecake, I've experimented with how much blend/whole strawberrys, etc. My favourite for a jewel clear sauce without any 'bits' is to put the cooked and cooled mix through a cheese cloth or piece of muslin.. lickalicious!

VERY delicious and easy.  Used some strawberries that were on their way out...  what a great way not to let fruit go to waste!  The sauce was delicious over angel food cake.  Next time I think I will cut the sugar in half since I don't have much a sweet tooth.

So delicious.  My kids went crazy when I gave them a sample - they tried to knock me down to get to the bowl on the counter (they are 3 & 6). I cooked about a pint of strawberries slowly for a long time, then put the lid on the pot and cooked them until they boiled over. Pureed and added a cup of sliced fresh berries. Served it atop "Perfect Berry Shortcakes" with fresh berries and vanilla icecream. Thanks, HeIsLord5, it's heavenly!

I served this over Chantal's Cheesecake (on this site).. it was soo delicious! I used frozen strawberries and added in a drop of red food coloring to make the color pop! It was really amazing, not a slice left!

Excelent. I mixed cream cheese and bananas with it and stuffed french bread slices, and made stuffed french toast special in my little cafe. Every one loved it.

A little too sweet for me - so you may want to cut back the sugar, or use more strawberries.  I cooked about 10 minutes and pureed half.  This was very good over ice cream and also over Heavenly Angel Food Cake (this site).

I've done this a couple times to use as a topping on Cheesecake, and it's always a hit! The recipe is great as is, but I also tweak it a little sometimes and use orange juice instead of the vanilla. Makes it a little more tart and not quite so sweet. But it really just depends on the particular flavor you're looking for. Have fun with it!

Very good but very SWEET!  Next time I will cut back on the sugar (it was grainy) or try powdered.  I will probably make more chopped strawberries.

I made this twice.. First time with the vanilla and it added a strange taste to it... So the second time I made it without the vanilla and LOVED it! So delish! I also cut the sugar down just a smidge.. Im not a huge sugar freak, and hate anything that is too sweet.. Turned out great. My husband liked it both ways.

WOW!  I have been using this site for a while now but signed up so I could rate this. Amazing, I could eat the entire bowl with a spoon all by itself.  I am a brand new cook and I have no IDEA why people thought the recipe was confusing. It was very self explanatory. Thanks!

The first time i tried this i used fresh strawberries and i didnt like AT ALL! I dumped it.  This time i decided to attempt it again, i used frozen strawberries, and about 3 tbs of sugar, and about 1 tsp cornstarch. I added the vanilla at the end with some red food coloring,(it really didnt need the food coloring) I just added it for more deep red color. I really liked it this time!

I must admit I was skeptical of this recipe since I've never liked strawberry topping. But this recipe is amazing! Great over ice cream and tastes so much more natural than bought topping. I only did otwo things differently; I cut all the strawberries in half and pureed the entire batch because I'm not fond of lumpy toppings. Don't worry about the seeming lack of liquids at the beginning, the strawberries soon add moisture. This is a great recipe that I will be making again!

Terrific!! Very quick and easy. One twist, I added Triple Sec while simmering, and made a 'Strawberry Margarita' topping for mini cheesecakes.

So good.  So EASY!  I used frozen strawberries and I am not a fan of chunks in my dessert sauces so I pureed the whole thing and served it over the New York Cheesecake recipe on this site.  So unbelievably good! (did I say that already?)

This is very, very good.  I made it to spoon over pound cake and then topped it with whipped topping.  It was a little too tart for me so I added a ittle more sugar.  I will definitely make this to top my cheesecakes. 01/08/13 UPDATE:  I now use this recipe for strawberry cheesecake topping, strawberry trifle filling, you name it, it is a wonderful and simple base recipe!

I only give this four stars because the recipe is pretty confusing...however, that being said, I think regardless of interpretation the recipe works overall.  I am not sure what it was supposed to turn out to look like, but it was yummy served over crepes.  I cooked all the strawberries and pureed only a third.  I'll use this again for dessert crepes.

Marvelous!  I only used 1/4 cup sugar, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla, and applied a potato masher instead of cutting/pureeing the strawberries.  I used frozen strawberries, so they were perfectly soft/mushy for saucing.

This topping was the perfect accompaniament to New York Cheesecake III on this site.  I read the reviews and questioned putting the vanilla in, but last minute I decided that I would.  I used Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla, and added it after I took it off the heat.  I cooked 2/3 of a 16 oz container with the sugar and mashed them with a masher rather than pureeing them.  I cooked it for about 15 minutes, then added the vanilla and the other 1/3 of the strawberries, also mashed.  It was a HIT!  Even someone who likes cheesecake plain, tried and loved this topping.

It was definitely sweet, but it made the perfect strawberry shortcake.  The sweetness complemented the whip cream and angel food cake.  My only modification was that I put all the strawberries in at the beginning and cooked it for about 20 minutes (stirring every so often).  I did not puree anything since the it came out very saucy.  My husband and I loved it!

No one complained of this, but I thought the vanilla was not well suited with the strawberries.  I thought the strawberries would have done just as well on their own.  If I try this again, I will definitely leave the vanilla out.

Very good, but the directions were a pain.  Instead, I cooked all the strawberries in a saucepan, added the right amount of sugar and vanilla, but also a teaspoon of lemon juice.  Then I blended it until smooth.  The kids LOVED it!

I used frozen strawberries (probably three cups of whole strawberries that I then sliced) and cut the sugar back to 1/4 cup.  We served them over Buttermilk Pancakes II from this site.  Wonderful!

YUM!  This was a nice change from just my usual strawberry with sugar and water.  I used a quart size stawberrys, cut cup all the strawberrys.  Used half with the sugar and vanilla heated up and pour that over the other half of strawberrys cut up.  YUMMY

This is an awesome recipe! One suggestion I do have though- if using it as a topping for a cheesecake (w/ strawberries as well) make sure it doesn't stay around too long. Use up the cheesecake within 2 nights/3 days tops.

I pretty much followed the recipe exactly - except I used less sugar because my strawberries were pretty ripe.  While the topping definitely tastes good, I noticed that it isn't as bright red as the picture version.  Did I miss something?  Should I have let it cook for longer?

I made this as a topping for my brother-in-law's angel food birthday cake with strawberry topping request.  It received nothing but rave reviews.  It was very easy, and from what I hear (I'm allergic to strawberries), it was delicious- people kept coming back for more!  Because fresh strawberries were $2.59/lb. (!) in November, I used IQF strawberries and the consistency was just fine.

I made this sauce to go with pancakes and it was sooo good! I pureed more strawberries than asked for because of comments about it being too runny, and cooled it slightly beofre serving to thicken it up. Yummy.

Great, and easy!  I pureed the berries first, before cooking, to make a smoother sauce.  I added a few TBS. of water and used more strawberries than recommended.  (Kept the sugar the same).  I added just a little cornstarch to thicken.  Made with berries we picked ourselves yesterday- so yummy and good!  Served on top of cheesecake supreme.

This was okay but not as great as I wanted it to be.  I ended up doubling this recipe to go with only a half recipe of Chantal's New York cheesecake because it didn't seem like enough.  Also, I added a few squirts of red food coloring to make it a more vibrant red. I didn't puree too much of mine because I didn't want it too runny.  All in all good flavor and a great complement to cheesecake.

This was fantastic and easy! I needed to make a sauce for my strawberry shortcake so I just used this recipe and let it simmer only a few minutes to keep the berries firm, it turned out wonderful,will definitely use again and again. Thanks!

DH bought angel food cake and fresh strawberries.  This turned out AWSOME!  It was a little runny but that was ok since we were just putting it on angel food cake.  It is definitly a keeper.

Perfect on cheesecake and ice cream, but make sure to put the sugar in gradually and taste as you go, cause it can get very sweet or it might not be sweet enough, depending on the ripeness of your fruit.  I've used this recipe for raspberries too and think it would probably work for just about any berry.  Happy eating!

Perhaps I cooked them a bit too long, syrup came out a little too thick.  However, it still had a delicious taste.  Will try again.

I found the directions to be a bit confusing, measurment-wise.  But in all, a great topping, and a great way to get rid of the berries that are visually unappealing.

Very easy to make and tasted delicious. I made this strawberry topping for my daughter’s funnel cake. She loved it!

Completely forgot to grab a can of topping for my cheesecake yesterday. This was a life saver. I used a pint of frozen strawberry and added a tad bit more sugar. Hubby loved it!

Super easy and super good. I slice my strawberries quite thin and just boil it all down according to the directions. I don't feel the need to blend half of it that way but that's just me and I like the presentation better this way. Recipe is great as is.

I think I may have over blended, because it came out more like a gravy as opposed to a glaze/sauce... Otherwise, it was fantastic and a HUGE hit. If anyone has suggestions on what I did wrong, I'd appreciate the feedback. Thank you for an awesome recipe!

Made a pint for a cheesecake topping. It was so good, that everyone finished the sauce before the cheesecake!  I'm making a double batch now and am going to freeze some for winter, when there's no local strawberries. Great recipe, thanks!

Easy and delicious...two of my favorite things!! I wish I had an immersion blender to get the sauce a little smoother but no biggie cuz it's just me and my two guys eating it, no one to impress. I used a small masher to break down about half of the berries, then added the remaining sliced berries for about 4 or 5 min. Served it over regular ole vanilla ice cream for a Sunday night dessert. Yummy!

absolutely delicious!!  I cut out a step and reserved 1/4 of berries, then chopped them small and added back into sauce after I'd cooked it down.

Served over cheesecake and everyone loved it! Super easy and delicious. I used frozen strawberries since I couldn’t find fresh. I’m sure with fresh it will taste even better.

I made it at my home and then again on Mother's Day at my daughter's.  Since my daughter did not have cornstarch, I substituted flour out of desperation.  I definitely suffered.  The lack of clarity I anticipated, but the change in flavor disappointed me.  However it still saved the pound cake which was way too dry.

I was making a cheesecake and wanted to make my own topping. I used about 5-6 larger strawberries, a little under 1/3 cup of sugar, and I eyeballed the vanilla. I put it to medium-high heat (about a 6) and let it start to simmer. I brought it down to lower heat (a 3) so it could cool and thicken a bit and I took it off the heat. It tastes so good and It's super easy to make!

I was making my uncle’s cheesecake for the first time for Easter dinner  and was panicked about messing up a recipe that I waited 39 years for so I wanted something to add to it just in case. I found this one and my boyfriend found another so I made both and, even though it didn’t need any help, this strawberry syrup was an amazing addition. My boyfriend liked it so much that I have a new batch on the stove now

I experimented with two batches:  1 batch GMO strawberries @ $1.25 pint and 2nd batch strawberries @ $3.00 pint.  Ingredients added to both batches:   Cut sugar to 1/4 cup.   Used organic, Madagascar (alcohol omitted) vanilla.  Organic batch significantly tastier.  Make sure good quality strawberries used (makes a difference).

I thought this tasted great right before I added the vanilla unfortunately I believe there’s too much vanilla-  it takes the brightness of the strawberries away and turns it more artificial.  Perhaps if you’re used to store-bought sauce  this flavor may be acceptable  but if your  looking for  fresh fruit flavor, for me this recipe  was a failure.

My one regret is that I didn't double it. Made no changes, it was perfect. Cooked about 15 minutes and I didn't need a blender. Texture was perfect. Syrupy with plenty of strawberry chunks. Great flavor, tasted like homemade preserves. I couldn't stop sampling it as it cooked! Chilled it to serve on top of shortcakes. Crowd pleaser! Will make again!

I made this last night but changed it a little. I tripled the recipe and  I added an additional 1/3 cup of sugar and half jar of Smuckers  Strawberry Preserves.  Cooked it all together and chilled.  It's really good. I do think next time though I will cut the vanilla back to 1 tsp. Just seems like 3 is too much if you triple the recipe as I did.

Made this for a cheesecake topping for a customer, and they loved it. I actually had the topping sit on the cheesecake for a few days which made it even that much better. I wasn't sure how it would be sitting on top that long, but the strawberries tasted even better with my cheesecake recipe.

This is absolutely delicious and easy to make. I have made it many times and now just throw in the strawberries and sugar without even measuring the ingredients. I use this to top “Chantal’s New York Cheesecake” and it is the perfect balance. I think I could actually just drink it by itself if I thought no one would judge me...

I added my own twist by adding fresh lemon zest and 1tbsp rose water to the sauce. I also slightly thickened it with 1/2 tsp cornflour. I wanted a thick spoonable sauce. Yum.

Wonderful with fresh or frozen berries. Sometimes I blend up the whole batch, and everyone in the family wants to eat it straight, with a spoon.

Cooked 3/4 of the berries in 1/4 cup sugar for 15 mins. Used the spatula to crush the berries and then added the rest of the berries and vanilla.

Since I mastered the Italian American Cheesecake recipe that I found on this site, I made it again for a party I'm going to tomorrow. This time around I decided I wanted to try making a strawberry topping to compliment it and I found this recipe. The only step I did differently was after the mixture was finished cooking, I poured it all into the bowl I'd be storing it in and took out 1/3 into a measuring cup. Then I "pureed" that part using a wisk and put it back into the bowl with the remaining mixture. I covered with alluminum foil after it cooled and refrigerated. It looks perfect and can't wait for everyone's reaction on the cheesecake and topping together.

Delicious and simple! I made this topping to go with Angel Food Cake I recipe on this site. I used frozen strawberries, which I thawed and diced, and I skipped the pureeing step. I also added a couple drops of almond extract because I love the smell of it.

It was a hit. Surprisingly, it taste almost exactly like IHOP strawberry syrup that I've been looking for a long time. None came close and what do you know, without trying.

I grabbed a smoothie shake cup and pureed it all after mashing then returned to the pan for about 3 mins on a simmer. Taste great as soon as it's made!

I might have to bottle for mom gifts along with vanilla extract this year. 

Thanks

Super yummy. I only used 1/4c sugar, and may even try less next time! I mashed some with potato masher instead of pulling out the blender. Served over pancakes with whipped cream and a dash of cinnamon!

Wow!  After making this recipe and seeing how quick and easy it was, I can't see buying this sauce ever again.  I made this to go with the "Strawberry Shortcake" birthday cake I made, and although I actually made the sauce on a whim, it wound up pairing quite nicely and my guests assumed they were part of the same recipe.   Next up: Making some blueberry sauce as one reviewer suggested.

Very simple and really good, I smashed all the strawberries instead of pureeing but that was just because I didn't want to get the blender dirty :) It was a just the small portion that I needed, but it seems very easy to double it.

Basic yet delicious, I've been using this for several years and used it for pancakes mainly until recently, I've been putting this on my yogurt parfaits. I put a layer of plain non-fat yogurt, the strawberry sauce, and granola. Great breakfast snack for work!

This Strawberry Topping was perfect for a plain cheese cake. Everyone loved it. As others have said, it is not too sweet.  I added a handful of blueberries for color which added another nice texture. I will definitely keep this recipe on hand for future uses.

LOVE IT! Amazing flavor! I followed the recipe exactly as written the 1st time and then the 2nd time I replaced the vanilla extract with 2 tsps of Grand Marnier as suggested by a few reviews. I placed it on waffles and on pancakes. I  can't wait to try it on cheesecake!!! Yum!

No changes. I don’t know about anyone else but I just don’t get why people have to charge a recipe. Just submit your own.
Anyways super easy and very tasty on my homemade cheesecake.
My husband is wanting more already.

What the hell am I doing buying this in the frozen food isle when this level of decadence can be made from your own home? And the flavor is MUCH better than from the store.    WIll make more and more.

Delicious! absolutely perfect! and soooo easy! I started with frozen strawberries, because I always have them on hand. I didn't blend, but used a potato masher to smush the strawberries a few times as the cooking progressed. Didn't add the vanilla, but I bet that would be great. We used it on waffles and there wasn't a drop left!

There seems to be some confusion by some of the reviewers. The instructions do not say to add uncooked strawberries at the end, although that's certainly a modification you could try. They say to take 1/3 of the cooked sauce and puree it and ADD IT BACK to the rest of the cooked sauce. That way you have some smooth and some more chunky. Really, the amount that you puree or you don't puree or you smush (as I did) is just to achieve the texture and thickness that you want.

I'll be making this recipe again!

It was delicious! My son had just finished his first day of cooking camp and had made puff pastry cups. He wanted to serve them for dessert with some vanilla ice cream and something with strawberries. So, we looked up this recipe. It was fantastic!

I have been searching for a good cheesecake recipe for a loonnng time and I finally found it!. I read the revisions about putting the cheesecakes in a cold over and put the temperature at 200 degrees for 3hrs and 10 min. I also cracked the oven amd let sit for an hour before taking out. No cracks at all!!! I didn't even use a pan of water at the bottom. Now, instead of vanilla, I used 2 tablespoons of amaretto. Familly loved it. Smooth and creamy. Make sure your cream, cheese, eggs, and heavy cream are all room temperature. I also made one with an oreo crust (haven't eaten it yet). Definitely a six star recipe as long as you do the revisions mention

Had a bunch of organic strawberries to use up in the fridge - starting to get a bit soft so I picked through them and cleaned them all up and made this sauce. Used 4 cups of strawberries and 1/2 cup sugar in total and one tsp vanilla. I thought this was great and am glad I used only 1/2 cup sugar in total (4 cups is two pints) as was plenty sweet enough this way. Thickened up at 15 minute mark and I cooked a bit longer (2-3 minutes). Used an immersion hand blender and tilted the pan and gave it a few blends which also helped thicken a bit. Also thickens a bit as it cools. Overall would be great on a cheesecake or even waffles and pancakes. My 4 cups reduced down to about 1 cup and a bit in total when done.

This was super easy. I sliced the strawberries before throwing them in and stirred them a bit more than the recipe says to. I didn't even have to do the strawberry splitting/blending/mixing part - by the time this finished cooking down, I had a perfect strawberry sauce/syrup for my waffles.  I used genuine vanilla extract and loved the flavor. The only thing I had to watch out for was the sauce bubbling over while it was reducing. Am so excited to have this sauce over ice cream, french toast, pancakes... mmmm

I didn't follow the recipe. I read all the reviews and so all I did was to hull the strawberries and chop them very coarsely. Then I added the sugar and vanilla and cooked it on medium high for 15 minutes, which made it gel nicely. Had over strawberry ice cream for a perfect summer dessert. I'm putting up a bunch for gifts, too. So pretty and so easy to make!

I just made this to top a homemade cheesecake and it turned out amazing!! I might reduce the sugar, but we'll see after I try it on the cheesecake. It tastes like strawberry candy jelly and the consistency is perfect. This will be my new go-to strawberry topping recipe!

Easy recipe. I modified it slightly by adding a little water and didn't blend in instead leaving it a little chunkier.

Good to put on anything... (Almost famous lemonade is spectacular with it, ice cream and especially great with plain Greek yogurt!) GREAT recipe! The only thing I changed is I used xylitol to make it no sugar.  Thanks!

Very good--if you like it less sweet  or what you are topping is already sweet, reduce the sugar to 3T; otherwise good as written.

This really depends on how you like your strawberries.  I made two batches, one following the exact directions and one doubling the sugar.  I like the doubled sugar much better and so did the rest of my crowd.

No changes.  Pureed about a third of the cooked strawberry mixture with an immersion blender.  It was a hit with the cheesecake.

OMG - I want to drink this! I made it with whole frozen strawberries and let reduce for quite some time. I skipped the blender step; didn't need to if you let reduce a while and mush a few along the way. Used with homemade whipped cream and brown sugar pound cake. Thinking about pancakes next...

Amazing!  This was definitely a restaurant quality sauce.  I made it for some mini cheesecakes & it was a hit!  My husband even said he could put this on an old shoe & it'd be delicious ;) This will be my go-to Strawberry sauce.  Thanks Brad!

Made this recipe  twice now.  Four stars for the way it is written.
Very large strawberries  were cut in 3 pieces. Large strawberries were cut in half. It was not necessary to blender at all.
The second time I made this recipe, I didn't add the vanilla until after cooking and removing from the stove.  Noticeable better flavor.  5 stars the second time.

3 stars as written. 5 with changes. Slice all berries. Cut sugar down to almost a third. Simmer half of the berries, add the other half after taking off heat.

I had to rush to prepare a sauce for my cheesecake about 30 minutes before a thanksgiving party. I decided to go with this one and followed it according to the recipe although I pureed the mixture as I don't like smushy strawberries and then set aside more fresh strawberries to top the cheesecake with. It was delicious and I loved it.

Goes perfect with the cheesecake. Probably would cook it a little less than 15 minutes because it turned out a little thicker than anticipated.

Easy-peesy-tasty.  I substituted 1/4 cup dark brown sugar for the white sugar for a richer taste.  Instead of removing some of the berries to blend, I cooked them in a  2 qt pot & used my stick blender for less to clean up.   My husband offered to "clean" the pot to keep the dishwasher from getting clogged!

Quick and easy, but I did add a bit or red food coloring to the finished product.  Made to use on cheesecake, but it would be great on many other things as posted by other reviewers.  Thanks for this; it is now my go-to recipe for strawberry sauce.

Great recipe!  I only made one adjustment that I'm sure didn't change it much.  I left about  a cup of strawberries aside and cooked as directed, then blended everything and stirred in the fresh strawberries at the end.  It was delish!

This turned out perfect for cheesecake and ice cream. I didn't change the ingredients but I chopped the strawberries fairly small and simmered it for about 20 min. and didn't need to mess around with blending or thickening.

Excellent! Here is how I did it, tho': Used one 16 oz. bag of  whole frozen strawberries and 1/3 cup of sugar, plus about 2 Tbsp. water. Heated it up slowly, and let it cook about 10 minutes. Then, I gently mashed with a potato masher--I wanted  pieces of strawberries in the sauce, not just a puree, to pour over pound cake. And, I added 1 tsp. real vanilla extract at the very end, after I had taken it off the heat. It was absolutely delicious.

This is my go-to recipe for strawberry sauce.  So simple and delicious.  Excellent for strawberry shortcake or as in ice cream topping.  But it is my absolute favorite drizzled over Grandmother's Pound Cake II.

This was a big hit served with Chantal's Cheesecake.  I used a potato masher, instead of a blender.  It was more efficient and less cleanup.

The is a very good and easy sauce to make.  I used frozen strawberries from the garden, next time I will try adding food coloring to have it look as good as it tastes.

I've made it and use it as a cheesecake topping. 
Great taste! 
I found out that this is the only recipe that does not use cornstarch. I put it on top of the cheesecake and after a while it started to melt, but taste was very good.

Super easy and oh so good.  I followed others directions:  I used a 16oz bag of frozen strawberries.  I left 1/3 in the freezer, cooked the rest on the stove and then puree'd half of the stove mix.  I went on a ledge and added 3tablespoons of fireball whiskey into the mix before I puree'd it in the blender... It was FABULOUS!!! It gave a sweet yet cinamonny kick.  I just love this recipe!

Awesome recipe! I used this to top Chantal's New York Cheesecake. Much better than any store bought sauces and makes my cake look that much more elegant and yummy. I followed another user's advice and cooked 2/3 of a 16 oz bag of frozen strawberries with the sugar, blended it a bit and placed back in the pan, and then added the remaining 1/3 strawberries for a couple minutes with the vanilla. Delicious!

I don't know why everyone found it confusing! All you do is add sugar, Strawberries and cook until sauce thickens. Take out 1/3 cup and puree and then add it to the rest. Easy as pie. Don't forget vanilla.

The taste of this strawberry topping was extremely mild, and no more flavorful than a strawberry preserve you might get anywhere.  I won't bother doing it again.

I didn't follow the directions completely -- I was too lazy to dirty the blender so I just mashed the berries with a potato masher -- but the ingredients were great.  We served it on mini cheesecakes with fresh blueberries for 4th of July and received many compliments!

I used seven cups of strawberries, which is 3.5 pints. I was concerned about the amount of sugar called for. I added less than 1/2 cup total (instead of 1+ cup) and 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract (instead of 1.5+ tsp). The end result was still way too sweet for me, and I'm not sure I would add any vanilla next time. I will make again, but I will cut the sugar down to 1/4 c and try almond extract or none.

This was absolutely delicious. I've never made a sauce before, so I wasn't sure how it was going to turn out.  I did follow others hints to keep some of the strawberries out and add them after cooking the sauce.  It was perfect that way.

This turned out very well! Served it with Chantal's Cheesecake from this site! Did exactly what the recipe called for & threw in some extra chopped fresh berries at the end for a more bountiful berry effect. Good on ice cream too!

I never rate recipes but I have to tell everyone how GOOD this is. I'm making my first cheesecake and had no idea how to make the sauce for the top. So simple. So good. After reading the reviews I cooked and blended the whole recipe then added more sliced strawberries to the mixture to avoid mushy pieces. YUM

I followed the instructions and it started out ok but then if you only stir it occasionally like the directions state it will end up a burnt mess... There go the strawberries. Now have to run to the store to buy another carton.

OK...I followed this recipe EXACTLY how it was written.  Exactly!  It was great!  Why didn't I give it 5 stars?  Because it was too thick for us but could be my fault.  I'm thinking I needed more strawberries.  Going to try it again and if I figure out that it was my mistake...will give it 5 stars.  Kids loved it!  Spooned it over cheesecake.  I would suggest doubling or tripling the recipe as there just didn't seem enough for 4. (Could be we just spooned on a lot because it was so good!)

I have made this sauce before & it is wonderful.  Today I made it getting ready for Christmas.  I had 2 pears that had to be used so I added them into the strawberry mixture.  A wonderful combination of flavors!

Love this recipe! Quick and easy way for a delicious strawberry topping!
The recipe isn't very clear but I simply chop all strawberries, and put into pan with sugar and vanilla. Cook until thickened. And instead of putting part of the mixture in the blender, i just smash some of the strawberries while cooking! Comes out just a great!

So easy, practical, and delicious.  I needed to alter it a little to use raw cane sugar, used roughly half of what the recipe called for, and it turned out fantastic!

Made this for two cheesecakes that I was bringing to the office and followed Misty's suggestions. It doubled perfectly and was flawlessly good! It wasn't too sweet, not too tangy but very fresh and tasty. It complimented the cheesecakes rather than competed with it. Excellent topping!

Kinda silly that this is the only strawberry topping that came up on the page when i searched strawberry topping. With the poor quality instructions and the need for a blender, but thanks to the people that write the reviews I was able to make a great topping . Also added a table spoon of icing sugar to give it a bit more cavity causing goodness, I agree I will never need to buy canned fruit toppings again .

Thanks for sharing! I was looking for something to put over pancakes when I discovered (after I had started cooking of course) that I was out of maple syrup. I didn't have much on hand but I did have frozen strawberries and it turned out great.

Just out of curiosity I used 2/3 teaspoon  pure vanilla extract and 1/3 teaspoon almond extract. Heavenly, although I can tell that it would be equally great using all vanilla.

Enjoyed.  Made it to top chessecake.  As everyone else said, much better than the "jellied strawberry" topping you find in the grocery store.  Will make again.  Would be great on waffles or pancakes.

I was going to run to the store and buy the premade topping, but I am so glad I dedicded to look up a recipe first. This is excellent and I will make it again and again. I used a pampered chef masher that is usually used for ground meat to mash the strawberries and it worked just as good as a blender. Thanks for the recipe!

I spooned this over fresh blueberries on top of mini cheesecakes. I thought the sauce was a lilttle too sweet (I used fresh strawberries) so I added a little fresh lemon juice which gave it a little tartness. Pretty good.

I made this recipe with Organic Sucanat instead of sugar and it turned out great. I pureed the entire thing beause I am using it as ice cream topping for my daughter's class. I did add a little corn starch to thicken it.

This tastes way better than the predone stuff you get at the store. The only thing I altered was increasing the vanilla and sugar for all the strawberries I used and blending them all into the sauce as they cooked. (My hubby and son dont like the chunks :P)

This is a great recipe, very simple. I used this topping as a syrup for sweet cream cheese filled crepes, and found it a touch too sweet for that, so I added lemon juice to taste until it reached the flavor I was looking for. The recipe as written is, however, perfect for topping purely sweet desserts like ice cream and cakes! Thanks for the recipe, I'll use this one again :)

Simple and delicious! I was looking for something to marble into my cheesecake, and this was perfect! I didn't have a blender, and don't like fruit chunks, so I spooned the mixture into a fine sieve and pushed through with a spoon - it got all the syrupy part through and I just had to scoop out a small amount of the leftover pulp. EDIT: I've also used this recipe for raspberries and blueberries, and worked just as great every time! Don't be afraid to up the sugar a little if you are buying tart off-season fruit.

Good, but I was looking for something more special to top my shortcakes with--this wasn't it.  This is definitely more saucy than fruity.  I was going for the latter, and it didn't work too well.

My husband loves strawberries and he really loved this sauce.  I found the other reviews quite helpful.  It is really easy to make this sauce as smooth or chunky as you want.

This is so yummy, The only thing I did different is I cut the sugar to 1/4 cup, my personal taste I like it a little more tart and i thought a 1/4 cup was a perfect mix of sweet and tart. Also I just mashed the berries in the pot with my potato masher, it worked like a charm. I will never buy the store bought stuff again!!

I followed OC's instructions on this recipe, and it came out great! I also cut it up to small pieces, and got my hand mixer out on high, and whipped them to almost a jam consistancy. I like my toppings sweet, so next time I may add a little more sugar.

After reading the recipe and then the reviews, I figured it out, I tried the recipe to the "T" at first with the vanilla.  I did taste it before I put the vanilla in and I have to agree with some of the other reviewers that it is "Fresher" without the vanilla. It is in the refrigerator now and I will taste it again after it is cold. Thanks for the recipe.  It is for a cheesecake.

Great recipe, minimal ingredients. Just the way I like them! I didn't have fresh strawberries, so I used the 16oz bag of frozen strawberries I had in my freezer. Followed the directions up until the blender part. I blended the whole batch, because I wanted a smooth strawberry sauce, rather than chunky. Once blended, I ran it through a sift to catch the puree and seeds. Perfectly, smooth, delicious strawberry sauce that went PERFECT with my flourless chocolate cake!

not the best, but I suppose that's my fault.  I used agave syrup instead of sugar, but then it was way too runny....I ended up having to add about a tablespoon of cornstarch and it thickened right up...I put it over Belgian waffles with powdered sugar...yum!

I made it twice. The first time, I didn't blend it, but mashed it with a fork. I didn't like it mashed. The 2nd time, I used the blender--MUCH BETTER! I would've like it to be a thicker, but I guess, it'll do. I'm using it as topping for Chantal's Cheesecake.

Directions are incomplete but figured it out w/the help of previous reviews. A little too sweet for my taste & mine turned out pretty thick, but that's probably a personal preference.

I never know strawberry topping is so easy to make! I follow others' suggest to mash 2/3 strawberry in the pan together with the sugar. Skip the vanilla cos don't have any and still taste good. Need to add more sugar though, maybe my strawberries are not sweet enough. Constant mashing and stirring, done within 5 mins. Add the remaining 1/3 diced strawberry to the finish sauce. Really need to hull the strawberry cos the core can't be mash easily in the pan.

I used 2 lbs of berries, washed and stemmed and cut in pieces. I  put about half of them in a pan along with 3/4 cups of sugar and about 1 tsp vanilla(I didn't measure a thing)& cooked them while mashing them(w-pot. masher) for about 4 minutes. Then I took them off stovetop and used my Braun hand blender to puree. Worked great! Then put them back on to boil a bit them cooled slightly and poured over the rest of berries and chilled. Excellent!! Handblender is key!! Thanks!!

I make this as a topping for my New York cheesecake, and it is the jewel in the crown. My friends stop talking and start grunting yum-yum noises from the first bite they take.

Great!  I used frozen strawberries and splenda (a little more than the amt of sugar the recipe called for) and drizzled over angel food cake.  Yum!

this is great. i got my three- and six- year- old cousins to try it,and they really don't like sweets. they thought that i was great, and it works especially well for kosher, since there is nothing like gelatin or anything unnatural.

I loved this recipe! I chopped the strawberries instead of halving.  Used this sauce not only over ice-cream, but cheesecake, fruit salads.... I did add another 1/2 tsp of vanilla and did not find the vanilla overpowering.

This was good and easy! I used frozen whole strawberries, because Kansas in January isn't the best time to buy good fresh strawberries! It worked really well. What I did was put the strawberries in my blender and chopped them up so that there were still some small chunks and I put everything in a saucepan and simmered until it was the consistency I wanted. Used a little more sugar(not sure how much, just scooped a couple of heaping spoonfuls in)and added a splash of amaretto. YUM, was really good over my no-bake cheesecake. Thanks!

This was the best!  We used it to top off our waffles.  I took the ingredient list and kind of did "my own thing" like I do quite a bit.  It turned out great!  My husband was looking forward to use the leftovers on ice cream the next evening, but earlier in the day my son used it as a cracker dip!

Just what I was looking for! Simple and tasty, definitely a "keeper" for my family. I used 2 cups frozen strawberries, since that's what I had, and followed the suggestion to reduce vanilla to 1/2 teaspoon.

This topping was a big hit in my house. I made it to serve over Chantal's Cheesecake (also on this site). It was a good consistency and flavor (although the flavor really depends on how good your berries are.) and kept well in the fridge. Thanks for the recipe.

This was pretty good, but not the best I've ever had.  We paired it with the Cream Cheese Pound Cake III on this site, and it was pretty tasty.  Over the top sweet for me, but my guests all said they liked it.

Great topping. I made it with the New York Cheesecake III and everyone was impressed by the fact that I homemade a topping rather than buying sundae topping from a can to use. It was so simple for such big compliments! I, personally, thought the vanilla strawberry taste was a bit odd on its own, but it disappeared with the cheesecake taste and no one seemed to notice.

Very good strawberry topping.  I also made it for the Chantal's New York Cheesecake recipe.  It was a great combo.  I sliced a pint of strawberries.  I took 1/3 of the sliced strawberries and cooked them according to the recipe with the vanilla included.  I pureed the cooked mixture and then added in the remaining 2/3 of sliced strawberries and chilled.

This is the best homemade strawberry topping I have found thus far. I really enjoy it on ice cream and waffles, but it is almost a little too sweet and has a slightly odd taste to it. Haven't figured out what that's about. It is not as good as the topping you get at upscale ice cream places, but is an excellent home substitute for something you never see (done well) in the grocery store.

This recipe tasted very good, but there are some things I will definitely do differently next time. A little less sugar and maybe add just a smidge of cornstarch to thicken it up a little, it was a little runny for my liking. The flavor was fantastic, though! Thanks!

This was a bit too sweet for me, but my husband loved it over Belgian waffles.  Next time I'll leave some of the chopped strawberries uncooked and add them after blending. An excellent start.

This is fantastic.  I've made it with strawberries and also with frozen mixed berries.  It's a hit everytime and no one can believe how simple it is to make.

This was easy to make and came out with a nice consistancy but I didn't care for the vanilla flavoring, it made it taste like store bought strawberry glaze.  Will make again minus the vanilla.

Simple and fantastic!  I used more strawberries and less sugar and thought this was so much better than the typical simple syrup mixture.  Used as a topper to some pancakes and can't wait to use whats left.  Thanks!

I altered the recipe a bit, using frozen mixed berries (from Costco) and fresh strawberries- so yummy!  Because of all the seeds in the mixed berries, I pureed the whole batch, and then stirred in a bunch of fresh sliced strawberries and blueberries.  I will be serving over the cream cheese poundcake from this site, but can easily imagine using as a topping for ice cream or belgian waffles!!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was definitely supreme, and so easy to make. I halved all my strawberries before I threw them in the pot. I also pureed all of them since one of my brothers doesn't like chunky stuff. I loved that it wasn't sugary sweet and you could taste the strawberries.

This tasted really good. I followed the advice of other reviewers and set aside 1/3 of the strawberries for after I cooked the sauce. I also cooked them whole, pureed them then added the 1/3 strawberries to the mix. I blended it again but that was not a good decision. Next time I will not do that.

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!!! It is the very best! We loved it and refuse to use a different recipe for strawberry sauce/topping ever!!! I did add some fresh chopped strawberries to the sauce after it was done cooking to avoid the mushy fruit pieces!

With this recipe having only 3 ingredients, I was a little skeptical - but pleasantly suprised. I made this topping to be served along with a cheesecake and it was very tasty, not to mention super simple!

The best thing there is.  I used it on waffles this morning instead of syrup.  My 20 month old son kept dipping his fork into the sauce and didn't really want the waffles that much.  I guess that is the best compliment there is.  Thanks for the post.

OK. This doesn't need another rating, but it really was fantastic.  Served it over dessert crepes, then used it on waffles with whipped cream.  Very simple in its divinity.

Wondering what to do with those less-than-perfect strawberries? Stop right here. This is the solution! Ours were a little on the sour side, but came out sweet and beautiful in this lovely sauce. I needed to add a little more sugar than called for in the recipe, and used an avocado masher instead of a blender to make the puree. Other than that, I didn't change a thing. The vanilla in the topping is subtle and makes for a perfect strawberry sundae. Pour this over vanilla frozen yogurt, top with whipped cream, and ENJOY. We sure did. Thanks, Brad! You saved our berries!

Excellent topping, exactly what I was looking for. Would maybe lessen the sugar just a tad when you have really fresh ripe strawberries that are sweet enough, but will use this very often!

This was good. I pureed most of it and left a few chunks remaining. It was served over waffles. I think this would also be perfect over ice cream, which is one of the ways I will serve it when I make it again.

Made this and let it cool then served over french toast. YUM! Would have been even better if it had been over stuffed french toast.  04/06/09 - New suggestion:  Quarter strawberries (don't mash), let syrup cool then serve over twinkies.

I couldn't wait until the topping was cooled off so I had one serving over vanilla ice cream and a hostess short cake while the topping was still hot. Later I had another one after it had cooled and I liked it better when it was still warm! Either way it's deffinately a five star treat.

I must have done something wrong because mine turned out more like strawberry jam, but it was still very good, I served it with the mini cheesecakes and it was verry yummy. I will try to make it again.

Excellent. I served this with Mini Cheesecakes 1 from this site and people couldn't get enough of either! As another reviewer has pointed out, you must adjust the amount of sugar for the sweetness/tartness of your berries. Start with less than the recipe calls for and keep tasting as you add more. I also added just an ounce of water at the start to get the cooking process going.

Very good. Used this on top of funnel cake II recipe from this site. I used frozen strawberries that I had frozen from the strawberry stand. I would recommend cooking it only as long as it says...I overcooked it and it turned out more like fresh strawberry jam...not a bad thing, but the strawberries were a little too mushy. Still, it tasted great and I will make this again!

My husband absolutely loved this recipe.  I served it over Big Jim's Biscuit recipe with Blue Bell Vanilla Ice Cream and whipped cream on top.  He said it was the best strawberry shortcake he ever had.

This sauce is TOP NOTCH.  It tastes just like the sauce you get in a fine restaurant.  I tried the sauce on Cheesecake both warm and when it was cold.  I think it was better cold.
