This is delicious and EVERYONE raved about it.  And it's not a hard dish to make.  I didn't have lemon juice so I used lime.  We loved it!  I made half again the recipe because it's a little small for four people, and when I made it half as much again, it was about perfect for four.  It could easily be doubled.  For white wine, I used Pinot Grigio

I never met a chicken piccata I didn't like, and this is no exception.  It was delicious.

Very tasty dish.  I used homemade chicken stock instead of the granules.   (guests were late so it was on stove much longer than the recipe called for) so the liquid reduced substantially.  I kept adding chicken stock and the result was a very lemony sauce, and I added a bit of lemon zest as well. Goes terrifically with capers. 
Loved it. Will make this again.

Chicken recipe portion is delicious. Make sure to pound the chicken to soften it up. The sauce portion was not so great. I did not have bouillon so maybe that is where it went wrong. I used Pinot Grigio and it was just too bitter and not a great flavor. Perhaps white wine works better or maybe adding more water and less wine. Otherwise was great

I made a mix of this recipe with the Quick Chicken Piccata  recipe from this site.  I pounded the chicken so it was very thin so cooking time was around 2 minutes per side.  I didn't have lemon-pepper seasoning, so I put lemon zest into the flour with pepper and cayenne pepper.  I used 1/3 cup of lemon juice, 1/4 cup of water, 3TBS cold, unsalted butter; and I added a bunch of parsley on top for serving.  It is really a combination of both recipes.  Everyone liked it; two asked for the recipe.  Oh, I also added a c an of cut-up artichoke hearts.

The flavor was nice and very light but it was just ok.  I had to make double the sauce and it still wasn't enough.   I made a recipe from Allrecipes previously that I thought was better so I'll look for that the next time.
