I love scones, and these might just be my new favorite flavor combo! I made a couple of modifications . . . 1 tsp of sugar didn't seem like near enough, so I added about 1/4 cup to the flour mixture. There is also a typo in the ingredients - the submitter's personal recipe calls for EITHER 1/2 of a bar of good quality white chocolate OR 1/3 cup white chocolate chips. I used the 1/3 cup of white chocolate chips, and also made a glaze with 1/4 cup of powdered sugar and a couple of teaspoons of milk and some more orange zest, and drizzled it over the warm scones. This really made the orange flavor POP in my opinion. I ended up baking them for about 18 minutes total. Delicious!

I wasn't sure of the directions when I read this.  It didn't look right, but I followed them anyway, as written.  Should have listened to my gut. Once the berries and chocolate are in there, it's impossible to get a smooth dough if you don't want the berries to burst.   Mix the milk into the batter first and then fold in the chocolate and berries.
My scones are really ugly, but they taste pretty good.

Definitely satisfies the sweet tooth! Would make again! I used buttermilk and butter instead of shortening just because thatâ€™s what I had on hand. I always sprinkle the tops with sugar also. Mine needed a bit more baking time but were very tasty!

These scones were too dry.
