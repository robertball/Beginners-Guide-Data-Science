We found a pizza stone preheated in the oven works amazing for getting the best possible texture out of the bagels. We had leftover pizza toppings from when we cooked up a large pizza (refrigerated crumbled sausage, pepperoni, mozzarella). Needed to use them up so this seemed like the way to do it. The texture was just perfect on a preheated stone at 425 degrees on the bottom rack for about 10 minutes. Hot enough that the toppings were no longer cold and the cheese was just starting to slightly turn brown. Perfect!! That's my pic with the three on the clear plate. I think they were wonderful.

Quick and easy, mini pizzas in the simplest form. My daughter and I enjoyed this as a quick dinner. I made homemade pizza sauce (tomato sauce, paste, oil, and seasonings.)

This is one of my favorite quick meals--the possibilities are endless. I like to make the pizza sauce from scratch. When I do this for dinner, I make little bowls of "toppings"--sliced olives, chopped onion, fresh sliced mushrooms, crumbled sausage, mozzerella cheese.....you name it. This way, everyone can make their own pizza the way they like it. HUGE hit for beginning cooks.

Very easy, kid friendly, adaptable and fast. I use a canned pizza sauce....after I spread some on the toasted bagel I sprinkle with garlic powder and Italian seasonings. Top with a pizza cheese blend and then the turkey pepperoni and sliced green pepper strips. Thanks!

Boo! I made these for a Halloween appetizer using a mini ghost shaped cookie cutter to cut out provolone cheese.

Perfect for a quick dinner that the kids can help with. Definitely kid friendly. Very versatile since you can add whichever toppings you desire. Used regular sized bagels so we increased the time from 5 minutes to 10. Will be making this again.

This was an overall fairly good lunch. I do wish for it to have a bit more flavor but it is something I would make and eat again, very easy to make.
