I made this for a day-after-Thanksgiving brunch.  I followed the recipe completely and it was my grandson's favorite and he is asking me to make it again for our day-after-Christmas brunch. I used Jimmy dean regular sausage.  I do believe it took a few minutes more than stated in the recipe to cook. Wonderful flavors.

Loved it!! I'd back off to 16 oz on the salsa to avoid a watery finished product. Flavor is amazing.

It is hard to decide between 4 or 5 stars.  The taste of this is really good.  I would use a thicker salsa next time and not the full 24 ounces.  It was a little too watery and not as attractive as it could be.  I think serving the remaining salsa on the side would be good.  (Salsa Verde would be great too!)  If you don't have avocado, no worries - make this anyway.  Leftovers are going to be re-warmed and wrapped in a flour tortilla for an easy breakfast burrito.  Thanks!

The family liked it. I agree with decreasing the amount of salsa.

I've made this twice now. The first time was to use up some eggs and leftover salsa, sour cream and peppers. I had already made up a delicious Indian dinner, but got bored & did this in addition. It was a bigger hit than the Indian food. Today, I made this again and doubled the recipe because the 11x13 pan for 4 people disappeared to fast. I did the sour cream and eggs in the blender to aerate which my eater loved how fluffy they were. I added mushrooms, jalepenos and at the very end did sprouts on top after it was out of the oven. I learned doubling the recipe wasn't enough for 6 people. I'll have two make two doubled recipes next time. What a hit!!!

This was excellent! I took reviewers' suggestions and reduced salsa (8-10 oz with remainder offered at serving). I always substitute Greek yogurt for sour cream, and used about 1/2 the amount of Jalapenos; everything else was as written.  Will definitely make this again!

This is very delicious and packed with flavor! I eat eggs everyday for breakfast (in some form) and this was a great twist.  I did have to use bacon instead of sausage as I didn't have any sausage in the house. Also, I didn't use a lot of salsa as I'm not a big fan, but even still I think using the amount recommended would be too much. Definitely will be making this again!
