I made this for supper last night and it was amazing!! Super yummy and easy to prepare. I used lemon and cracked pepper sardines and I added a layer of sauerkraut as well just because I believe that sardines and sauerkraut are soul mates. I also added some sliced onions with the potato layer.

This recipe was delicious.  I layered sauted mushrooms and onions with garlic bread on the side.

I dont know what I did wrong, but it was not that good. I followed the directions all the way. I think my family just likes things with a different flavor. I made mediterranean fish to go along with this casserole. The fish was great! but this not so good.

Tried it as written and while I like all the ingredients together they didn't work.  Perhaps with the sauerkraut it would be okay as it seems like it needs something to bind it all together but as is, it wasn't awful but it wasn't good.

super easy, super healthy and all natural ingredients! the fewer the ingredients, the healthier a meal is.  NEVER thought I could like sardines cooked in a casserole, but this is simply delish!

It was dry.  I like all the ingredients separately but flavors didn't blend at all like they do in other casseroles.
