I followed the recipe except for using milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet.  I could not imagine trying to spread the dough into the pan specified so I used an 8x8" square pan.  They baked about 40 minutes.  I would prefer blond brownies to have no chocolate so next time I'll probably make them without.  Thanks.

I doubled the recipe for my family for a party (used a 9 X 13 pan) and left out the nuts. Every one gave it a 5 star rating! It's a keeper.

Amazing. I made one change. I dont like butterscotch so I used 2 cups of semi sweet choc chips. I don't think we will ever make regular brownies again!! Family is already asking for another batch.

Just made these. I did not add the nuts. Going to serve with a scoop of ice cream for dessert. Will warm up the brownie as little before hand.  They are really good right out of oven..hope there will be done left at dinner time????

This recipe is really good. I like it the way it is (the original recipe) but the chips/nuts additions can be modified with different flavored chips, Heath bar bits, M&M chips etc... The dough kind of reminds me of chocolate chip cookie dough, only just plop it in the pan and go! Great recipe, and I could see a young cook being able to do these easily! Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

I doubled this recipe and baked in a 9x13 pan for about 28 minutes. It really was fabulous. Served it warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. Will definitely make this again.

These were really good!  I also skipped the nuts, but used a combo of peanut butter chips and chocolate chips--so good! We are empty nesters, so I appreciate that it uses a smaller size pan--although this batch is going toward the coffee hour after our church service.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe, Steven!

I made these brownies for an open house.  At the time I did not have any pecans so I made them without.  They were delicious.  I am going to try them with the pecans next time.  Either way I bet they are great!  Very simple to make.  This recipe is a keeper!

Made these to the recipe except I browned my butter (as per the Pioneer Woman!)  and simply mixed everything in the saucepan- just be careful to temper your eggs a bit. I skipped the nuts and chips and added a pinch of cayenne pepper and toasted cinnamon. Perfection with an extra touch that puts it over the top.

Great recipe!  Added some cinnamon, probably put in a little less chips next time, still really great!
