My husband was really excited to try these...until he did! Cute idea, very easy to make, but the filling was just a little weird for our tastes.

Delicious little turnovers! I actually used pre-fab pie dough (from the deli section of the grocery store) and cut out 5" rounds. They were flakey and tasty with great flavor. Since I was making them for the first time (and for a party) I thought they needed some sort of dipping sauce. I made the Ginger Dipping Sauce, the Mustard Cream Sauce and Bloomin' Onion Dipping Sauce and got rave reviews for everything. I made the Empanadas 2 weeks before the party, froze them on a cookie sheet then put them in a zip lock bag. About a half hour before serving I popped them frozen into the oven and they came out perfect.

name is very deceptive since "picadillo" is ground beef not shredded chicken

Of course using canned biscuit dough does not make for the most authentic crust, but it was a LOT easier than making it from scratch and still came out great. They were a unanimous hit at our potluck!

I wanted to make Cuban Empanadas with Picadillo the old-fashion way by making fresh yeast dough from scratch using an original recipe from Ivonne, Cuban in the Midwest blog. The results are wholesome and just as tasty with seasoned ground beef known as "picadillo" in Spanish with raisins.  Golden Empanadas con Picadillo yield 16 empanadas for 2.5 cups of flour and one active yeast envelope.

I'm not a big fan of using canned biscuits when you are trying to duplicate a dough that is as delicate as an Empanada or pie dough.  It's just not the same.  I prefer a flakier crust.  The Picadillo filling just didn't work for me either.  This recipe just didn't quite hit any of the highs for me.

I loved the mixture of tastes all in a neat package - and it was easy to make and double the recipe.  I have two more dinners sitting in the freezer!  Watch the cook time, 450 is too hot for 16 minutes.  They would have burned - it was closer to 11 minutes!

gave them a try and I'm so glad that I did. Made these last night as posted and they were very good, couldn't get enough of them.  Even my three picky eaters want more. This recipe has ignited an empanada spark in my home.  As I understand it empanadas can be fill with just about anything and I'm willing to try empanadas with many different fillings.  Thanks for sharing.

I only made the filling and used Goya empanada skins., which I pan-fried in oil per the package instructions. The filling was fantastic!! The blend of flavors hits every taste: salty, sweet, savory, tangy. My husband still talks about them and I plan to make them again soon.
