These shrimp were delicious, yet I found the coconut difficult to shred.

I used pregrated unsweetened coconut that you buy at any store. The recipe is a little dry, but flavor delicious. I think the flavor would be enhanced if 1/2 cup coconut milk or fish/chicken stock was added.

Indian food is some of the most imaginativly flavored cuisines in the world, much is done with many spices with few ingredients. Adds a lot of 
interest to a menu .

WOW! I love coconut shrimp and this was very, very good. Reading other reviews I simply used unsweetened flaked coconut and added a little water once the shrimp were added to the pan (to make up for the moisture loss of using dried coconut). Very quick and tasty. I served it with Indian side dishes. My husband finished his plate and exclaimed "that was great, time to lick the plate, good!" This is so not my man, to give you an idea of just how good this dish is. Thank you for sharing this dish. This will take the place of my Korma as the star of my Indian dinners.

Quite a good recipe but I felt that something was missing. Maybe it is because the only spices are chilli and turmeric. Will try with some mustard seeds and garam masala next time. Thanks for the recipe anyway!

To make the recipe a little more juicy I used canned young cocnut juicy (since I did not use fresh coconut but shredded unsweetened coconut from the store). I also did not want to burn up myself nor set my guests on fire so I used a lot less cayenne pepper. It was absolutely delicious (the leftovers the next day were even better after soaking in the spices for a whole night)

ouch! really good, 1 coconut is to much for 3/4 lbs of prawns unless (you have really small coconuts).

A very good recipe, although I definitely recommend not using a whole coconut.  Otherwise, I really enjoyed it!

I made this dish last week, along with other Indian side dishes and it was wonderful.  Because I didn't want to fool around with cracking, peeling and shredding fresh coconut, I looked online to see about substitutions.  I learned that 4-5 cups of unsweetened, shredded coconut is equal to the fresh type.  Turned out great, although a bit dry.  I will make this one again.  Thanks for sharing.

I changed only two things: 1) I couldn't find coconut so I used processed coconut flakes sweetened for baking; it turned out well.  I think it was a good balance to the red pepper.  2) I added less than a quarter cup of water; it was too dry.  I agree with the reviewer who suggested adding coconut milk, which I plan to try next time.  The dish was a hit!  Thank you!!

My family loved this. I served with rice and broccoli. For my son the cayenne was a bit much so I would 1/2 it next time. I added the coconut milk (approx. 1/2 cup)while frying the grated coconut as it took up any moisture in the pan. I would in future after grating the coconut pour boiling water and letting sit for 30 minutes. (a common way to make coconut milk) and add as required to mitigate dryness. A GREAT RECIPE THAT CAN BE MINORALLY ADJUSTED TO TASTE. Thank you so much. Chris
