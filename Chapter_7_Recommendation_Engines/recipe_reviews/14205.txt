This was really different, and very tasty used as a hamburger relish.  I used sweet onions very finely chopped.

Made a couple salads today for potluck. I have to give this one 2 stars. It didn't go over well at all and I really wouldn't call it a salad. Maybe as a relish it might be ok--but salad no. I wouldn't make this again--sorry.

The tangy pickle/onion taste and the sweetness of the apples (I used red apples) gave my taste buds a kick. It was a delicious combination. one I will try again!

My grandmother makes something very similar to this, except that hers has a mayonnaise and sour cream dressing. Good stuff!
