Very delicious soup!  I made a few changes...skipped the step to make the rosemary oil.  I just used regular oil and then added some rosemary to the soup.  Also, I added a couple tablespoons of honey to the roasting veggies to add some extra sweetness.  Like a few others, I added about 1/2 cup half and half at the end.  It was spectacular...the balsamic vinegar drizzled on top was inspired!  Crushed pistachios would probably be good on top, too, although my son is allergic to nuts so we didn't try it.  Also, there was huge variation in rutabaga size at the store, so I just used one medium-large sized rutabaga and it seemed to be the right amount.  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious. A great way to use winter root vegetables. The balsamic vinegar adds a nice zing and contrasts well with the richness and smoothness of the roasted vegetables. Try throwing in cloves of garlic (in skin) to the roasting vegetables, as well as an onion. Add or substitute a few carrots or maybe some celeriac.

It came together really nicely; the creaminess of the soup was very rich without needing to add dairy.  I used a daikon radish to substitute for parsnips, and it worked well.  Try leaving the skins on the red potatoes for added color (tiny red flecks) and nutrition!

I was a little hesitant about making this at first since I am honestly not much of a vegetable person, but I really wanted to try out my white truffle oil and this was the first recipe I found. This soup was absolutely amazing. My husband and I loved it. We made it exactly as written with no substitutions and thought it was great. It will be a staple in our house this winter!

This was good, but to save the time and effort of peeling and cutting up the rutabegas, I used 4 turnips instead. I also sprinkled ground ginger over the vegetables while they were roasting, and added and extra sprig of rosemary as everything simmered together, and removed it before blending. I also skipped making the rosemary oil, and instead finely chopped the rosemary before mixing it with the vegetables.

This soup was very tasty.  I roasted the vegetables several days in advance and kept in the fridge.  Tonight I simply made 10 cups of chicken soup base with bouillon cubes then added the vegetables and pureed.  We added 1/2 pint heavy cream before serving and skipped the balsamic vinegar and oil.  Would definitely make again.

This was incredibly delicious.  Instead of making the rosemary oil, I just tossed two big sprigs of it into the stock while it simmered.  It pretty much fell apart so I just pulled the stems out before adding the veg.  I also read the recipe wrong and didn't simmer the vegetables in the stock, just blended them in small batches in the blender with a ladleful of broth.  Mixed the whole lot back into the pot and simmer it for a few minutes to blend.  Came out great!!  This does make an almost obscene amount of soup, though.  I should have halved it.  Hopefully it will freeze well!

After making this, I was disappointed.  It was a bit less thick and more bitter/ less balanced than I had anticipated.  I went back to the store and picked up a medium sweet potato and 1 lb of carrots, roasted those and pureed them into the soup.  Add a star!  Much more to my liking, more balanced flavors, thicker.  I will make it again, but with the modifications.

Yummy.  This was really great.  I found however that there the quantity of vegetables indicatged in the recipe was in excess of what I needed.  Perhaps our Canadian parsnips and rutabagas are bigger than the ones you guys have in the US, however, I ended up cutting back on the veggies, and still making a huge pot of soup.  I left some of the veggies in pieces, rather than puree all of them, to add a bit of texture to the soup...but I loved it, my kids loved it too.  Great one..thanks!

This is a great, soothing winter soup.  The flavors were subtle, but blended very well together.  I was put in charge of bringing a soup to Thanksgiving dinner - this will definately be the one.
Thank you so much for the wonderful recipe!

Very good-I used carrots, parsnips, rutabagas, potatoes, onions and garlic.  The smell of the roasted veggies was amazing.  The flavor was great but a little more subdued than I was hoping.  Really good though!

Silky and roasty goodness.  The store I went to didn't have rutabagas so I substituted celery root (celeriac).  I just thought that flavor would work well.  It did!  If your knife isn't the sharpest and you have trouble cutting through hard-skinned squash just microwave it for a couple minutes.  That softens it enough to cut easily, and we are pureeing it anyway.  This soup feels like you are eating something with cream, but there is no cream here at all.  The fresh rosemary really makes it, dried just wouldn't be the same here.

I made this for Thanksgiving 2 years ago for something a little different than your typical T-Day sides and everyone loved it!  Every year, I get phone calls from half the family making sure that I'm making it again this year!

This soup has very little flavor outside of that of the vegetables.  I added cumin on the first batch and curry on the second batch, and it helped a bit.  I ended up giving the rest of the soup to my dog.  For the effort that this soup took, the soup is not that good.

Great way to use winter vegetables. I halved the recipe and added a whole yellow onion and a few carrots.

This was absolutely awful.  It had both a sour and sweet taste, which can be an interesting combination, but in this case it wasn't.

If you like rutabagus you will enjoy this soup.  Good with or without vinegar.  Didn't use truffle oil.
