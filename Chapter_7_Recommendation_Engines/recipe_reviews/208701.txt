I made this recipe as a base , as i thought this recipe in its entirety seems a little bland. I used 2 cups whole milk and the juice of 2 lemons and let it curdle for 15 mins (for the buttermilk) then poured it over 6 large drumsticks and marinated for about 6 hours.  Then i took flour, paprika, chili powder, garlic powder, salt and pepper and a little chicken rub (basically 2 pinches of herbs de provence) and mixed it all in the flour, dipped the chicken to coat and cooked exactly like recipe said. Turned out GREAT. I ama vegetarian most of the time and will only eat chicken if has GREAT flavor and the marinade definitely made this chicken moist and flavorful and ofcourse the herbs i added to the flour helped as well.  Will make again and was just as good as any other FRIED chicken out there.

Everyone from the hubby, the 3 year old to the 10 month baby couldn't get enough of this chicken- and a super easy fast dinner (I did the curry variation).  I used fat free evaporated milk- worked out fine. Going into the regular rotation for SURE.

I tried the basic recipe, and it was not bad, but a little light on flavour. I might try this again with one of the variation suggestions. Paprika, cayenne, curry or garlic would definitely give this a flavour boost.
It's now several months later, and I should mention that this recipe is in my regular rotation. I now use a teaspoon of curry powder in the Carnation Milk mix, and another teaspoon and a half of curry powder in the flour mix. You might vary the amount depending on how subtle you want your flavour. Each time, the chicken is moist and flavourful and the texture is crispy. Always a crowd-pleaser.

I used regular carnation evaporated milk and lemon juice. I added lemon zest as well and regular paprika with some smokey Tabasco sauce. Delicious. I wiped excess marinade off with a paper towel before dipping in flour. Stayed on just fine. This is a great recipe for guests. Easy to prepare ahead of time and bake off when your ready. It is just fine marinated in the am and cooked for dinner.

All and all the chicken was pretty good but all the flavor came from the crust on the outside.  I didn't detect any actual flavor in the meat from marinating it over night.  I used vinegar and the evaporated milk.

I always love recipes that call for over-night marinading and this one is no different.  I made it with both the lemon juice and the vinegar and I preferred the lemon juice.  It gave it an interesting zip!  This is going to make it's way into my weekly rotation.

This was pretty good, I only marinated for 1 hr. I did half with the garlic and oregano it was bland for me the other half I added a tbsp of Indian Masala and loved the flavour that added. Will do this again and see if marinating it longer makes a difference. It was nice and crisy like fried chicken without the greece. Next time I'll skip the parchment paper and just make it in a glass dish sprayed with cooking spray. Will definatly use the Indian Masala again.

Mine did not look like the picture, but it was still very good and easy to make.

I have made this recipe twice, since I messed up making the first batch.  The second time I made it just as written and I was less than impressed.  Too much work for a so, so dish.  I will be deleting this one from my recipe box.

Made the paprika and cayenne variation - still came out quite bland. Good to serve to people who don't like spicy tastes.

Where's the buttermilk? Nothing beats the real McCoy but adding lemon/vinegar to milk is an acceptable substitute.  This definitely needs spices added like garlic, paprika, basil, oregano or what-have-you. I'd add it to the milk mixture as well as the flour.

This was a nice substitute for real fried chicken.  It was pretty good given how easy it was to make.  I'll definitely make it again.

Very good, I think I'm going to fry the chicken using the same marinade, but excellant baked, thought maby a rack underneath the pieces would allow some of the grease to drain away.

I followed the recipe exactly but the buttermilk coating wouldn't stay onwhen it was baked. Flavour was decent, but nothing too special. wouldn't make it again.
