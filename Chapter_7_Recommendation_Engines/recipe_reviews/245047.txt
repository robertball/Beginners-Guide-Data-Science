I scaled to 3 cups of rolled oats as that is what I had, omitted the pecans due to allergies and increased the raisins and apples, which I used dried apples. It did not clump the way I like so I would play around with the sugar/butter ratios. I would also double the cinnamon as it wasn't spicy enough, but smelled awesome while baking. I would also shorten the baking time or lower the temperature as mine browned too much for my liking. Added the raisins and dried apples in the last 15 minutes so they wouldn't scorch. Good basic recipe to play with.

I did not make any changes, and this has a pretty good taste; however, I would not suggest adding in the pecans until maybe about the last 10 minutes because mine ended up getting burnt
