The soup that was required wasn't available at my grocer, so I used seasoned canned tomatoes instead.  I also took the tomatoes and added a can of sliced potatoes (drained first) and cooked them in a sauce pan for about 30 minutes before adding them to the browned beef.  It came out spectacularly and I will be doing this again soon.  Great recipe!

The meat was great for tacos! Very basic but for minimal effort the flavour was good!
