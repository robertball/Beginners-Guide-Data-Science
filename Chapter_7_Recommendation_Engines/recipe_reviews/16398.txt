I quite liked this simple and hearty recipe.  It's very good for a chilly evening.  However, the turnip adds quite a bit of flavor, so if you don't like turnips, you might not enjoy this recipe.  I used Yukon Gold potatoes with the peel still on.  It was quite good that way.

Very Tasty.  I had some cooked chicken leftover so I simmered the veggies in chicken broth until soft and then i just threw in the diced chicken.  This is one of those recipes were nature's ingredients are the star and nothing fancy is needed to make it a winner.  My husband and children ate this up.  Thank you for sharing!

I browned the chicken first, after cutting it up in small pieces (I only had breast meat). I used a tsp. of olive oil. I thought it was very flavorful and simple. Great for the cold winter Michigan days.

Perfect on a cold night.  I found this looking for ways to use up the turnip we had in the fridge.  I used the leftover vegetables that we had - so not exactly the same amounts.  I used chicken stock instead of water and simmered for 45 minutes, adding a chopped up cooked chicken breast for the last 10 minutes.  No need to cook longer than that - came out great; very filling.

Loved the taste! Clean and 'chickeny'. I thought this was too little chicken for too many veggies though, so I doubled the chicken and pretty much cut the veggies ratio in half. Tasted heavenly :-)

This made way more than 3 servings and tasted pretty blah to us.
