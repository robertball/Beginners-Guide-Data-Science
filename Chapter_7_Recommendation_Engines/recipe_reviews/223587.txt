I used roasted garlic olive oil and I didn't put in the pineapple or sliced onions. I sauteed diced ham, onion and diced garlic and then I added the chard, kale and I added fresh spinach as well. I then sprinkled on crumbled blue cheese (didn't have feta cheese)and it was delicious! see picture for my finished dish.

I would give this a five if the pineapple weren't in there. We made it just as the recipe states, except for the pineapple and it was awesome. I'm sure it is delicious with it as well, but our personal preference is without. It just didn't seem that the flavors would blend well with the cheese, cranberry, and almonds...

My husband and I really liked this recipe. We used it as a side dish, omitting the ham and pineapple. I used dried onion instead of red onion and dry cherries instead of cranberries.

My family loved this. I had a bunch of greens from the farm so I mixed kale and lettuce. I skipped the meat and used a pomegranate blueberry dressing.
