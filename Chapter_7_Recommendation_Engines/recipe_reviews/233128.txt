This recipe has a nice start. We thought it was too sweet and it needed salt.  Can be a good vegan meal, but make it the day before you serve it, after the flavors had a chance to marry.

Excellent base recipe but I did change a few things. Found it a little dry, and added an extra 28-oz can of diced tomatoes plus a little water. I also added more chili powder to get a bit of a kick.
I also did not need to cook it after adding the sauteed onions and garlic; the beans were already tender without being mushy.
I really enjoyed the end-result - so healthy and delicious - not to mention affordable!

Made a few changes. I added green peppers and jalape√±o and red pepper flakes.  Good recipe just a little to sweet.  I put this over yellow rice.  I definitely would make this again.

Concur with the other assessment. It is remarkably devoid of salt and is too sweet. With good kernel corn one doesn't need that much sugar. I agree on the desire for a nice sweet chili but it should be arrived at through slightly more natural means. as for salt, perhaps the original chef intended for some of the original ingredients to be salted at the onset. Barring dietary restrictions this recipe will improve dramatically with pitches of salt across the board. Consider garnishing with fresh cilantro and queso fresco for a southwestern flare!

This was a great recipe. I didn't have time to wait for dried beans so I used low sodium canned and part way through I realized I didn't have and kidney beans so I substituted black beans I also substituted 2 tbsp of maple syrup for the white sugar (I don't use white sugar for anything)which turned out to be delicious. I would have given it 5 stars but it could have used a bit more flavour. All in all we enjoyed it for dinner and then lunch a day later.

I love this recipe.  I made a change based on 12 servings.  I used a 1/4 cup light agave nector in place of 1/2 cup of sugar.   Yes, this is a sweet chili, but that's what I like about it.

I live in China and have been craving some good ol' American chilli! This was perfect! However, I added about 1 tablespoon of taco seasoning to the mixture in the crockpot for a little extra kick! It turned out delicious!

Glad to find this recipe, as I had assorted leftover dry beans I wanted to use up. I followed the recipe to the letter, and it's very tasty, but more like glorified baked beans. Going to try adding more spices to see if that helps.
