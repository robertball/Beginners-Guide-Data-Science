Loved this recipe. Soft and light. I have a sweet tooth so I sprinkled some (sugar mixed with a few drops of anise oil)on it before I put it in the oven.
Thank you for this great recipe

i made these yesterday for my baby who is teething, thinking they would be like boudour biscuits.... but they were much softer and more like a sponge cake, but very yummy, the baby loves them... i made a small change, i didnt have any anise extract so i used vanilla extract.

Instead of fingers , I just bake in a cake mould n it was perfect . Soft and not to greasy . I had to reduce the sugar to 200g . Just fantastic .
