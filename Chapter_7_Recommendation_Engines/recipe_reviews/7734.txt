I just made this cake for the first time. I am not much for pound cake, but this one is excellent. It's moist, flavorful and quick to make.

Given that a yellow boxed cake mix will almost always identify itself to the taste buds, this is very good--again, for a yellow cake mix. What caught my eye on this cake was that sour cream provided the only fat--no butter or shortening. I'm sure this is why the crumb was a little different, kind of like a sponge cake. I substituted apricot nectar for the apricot brandy and in addition to the other extracts, 1/2 tsp. of butter flavoring (anything to try and cover up that dead giveaway cake mix taste!).  I made it in a tube pan, then glazed it, top side up, with a mixture of powdered sugar, apricot nectar and a dribble of corn syrup. It's a pretty cake, tall and delicately yellow, with a balanced blend of flavors, none of them dominant. Light and moist, this is tasty and satisfying on it's own and not overly sweet.  It would also be the perfect cake to use in a trifle or just topped with fruit and whipped cream.

Excellent cake.  I made 3 in the last 2 weeks as gifts.  Didn't have apricot brandy so I used Hungarian pear brandy.  Used fat free sour cream and "Egg Beaters" (instead of eggs) for a "lighter" version of the cake.

A bit different. I made it for Christmas presents last year and got many compliments. Freezes very well. I wrapped it in apricot brandy-soaked cheesecloth to give it added oomph. Very adaptable for toppings although it is rich enough to stand on its own merits.

Outstanding cake, Joyce. Thanks for sharing. I didn't change a thing. This recipe is perfect as is! Next time I'll try either some lemon yogurt over each serving.

Of all the cake recipes I've made with pkg. cake mixes this has to be the best. Everyone who has tried it, loves it. I plan to use it for an upcoming wedding cake.  Very good with seasonal fruit and custard sauce. Delicious.

This cake was expensive to make with the brandy and the different extracts and just not special.  If I made it again, I would make an orange juice powdered sugar icing to pour over the top.

I have to agree with Joyce.  This cake was rich, but not too rich, delicious and easy to make.  Didn't get a chance to freeze it as it was gone before you knew it.  Got tons of compliments, and of course I didn't tell it was a cake mix base!!!!!!

This pound cake tastes fantastic! And Ive never been a fan of pound cake before.  The reason I tried this recipe is because I wanted to use my new pumpkin shaped bundt pans and Ive tried other types of cakes from ooey gooey to light and airy but the pound cake kept its shape and was very attractive after I decorated the top with fondant.  Then I was really really pleasantly surprised at how flavorful and moist it was.  The only thing I did different was putting some food coloring in the cake batter to make it pumpkin colored.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great recipe,  I have made it several times!   Always perfect.   I used apricot nectar in place of the brandy when I took it to church and it was perfect.   Also added a teaspoon rum extract.   Thanks

I think I have spent years trying to hide a "cake mix taste" and this one almost accomplishes.  Also, it is wonderful to the taste buds and most people don't care if it comes from a mix or not. Guess I tend to be a bit of a perfectionist where baking is concerned.

Really moist cake! Was loved by family and friends. I bought it as a dish to pass. I used burnt butter frosting from this sight. I changed it slightly. Instead of using milk to thin the frosting I used part apricot brandy and part hot water and put on warm cake after removing from pan. This frosting spreads much better on warm cake.

Pleasant taste, although not really a strong apricot brandy flavor. Similar to the Orange Cake on this site, nice for afternoon tea.

The texture was great, moist but very little apricot flavor.  i used DeKupper apricot brandy, maybe that's the problem.  Just can't go to 5*

I read this twice before making the first one...without any changes. It was great with just a powdered sugar dusting. I put a paper lace mat on top before dusting to add a bit of glam. I'm baking another right now to take to a church meeting tonight. This one will have a light apricot glaze drizzled over it with a few sliced almonds on top. The cake is SOOO good as it is, but a friend wants to make one usibg cherry brandy. YUM, too, I bet.

A little spongier than what I think of as a pound cake, but excellent density nonetheless. I didn't have brandy, so I used peach schnapps. It was still delicious! Very citrusy and refreshing. I sent it to work with my boyfriend & they gave it 5 stars there... I even have requests to make it for upcoming parties. Great summer cake!

A very delicious cake, the flavor is awesome. I add 2/3 cup brandy instead of 1/2 cup for more flavor. I either drizzle orange flavor icing over cake or sprinkle confectioner sugar over cake. Never any left overs!!

I adjusted this recipe for 125 servings for a wedding a year and a half ago and still get complements about it to today.  I will be making it again in two weeks for another wedding.  Great recipe.

My friends really enjoyed this cake.  The texture was wonderful and very moist.  I didn't have yellow cake so I substituted butter cake.  I also added a full teaspoon of orange extract.  The taste is light and not overwhelming.

A good pound cake -- not overly special, though. The brandy and extracts give the cake a light, pleasant flavor which makes it more interesting to the palette than a regular pound cake. I would make it again for a tea party, but not as dessert for a family gathering.

This is my new go-to recipe.  Easy to make, smells delish, looks great out of the pan and tastes wonderful.  Have made it several times and not a crumb left over!  I made a glaze of Powdered Sugar, a dash of lemon extract, almond extract (or vanilla), and either the apricot nectur or apricot brandy.  Drizzled over the cake - YUMMO!!!

I followed the cake recipe exactly as written and it was fantastic! Really moist. I added a glaze made of icing sugar and apricot brandy. I would definitely make this again.

I made this cake for co-workers and I am so glad I did!   This is my new go to pound cake recipe.  Moist and delish!
