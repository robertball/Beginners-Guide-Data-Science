I liked this meal for the variety it added to our normal menu, but I found the sauce bland.  The texture was perfect, but the thing I tasted most was the flour.  I think next time, I'll halve the flour, double the parmesan, double the thyme and try to work in some additional flavor.  Not sure what: may experiment with garlic, or sundried tomatoes, or paprika.

I really enjoyed this pasta. I didn't have scallops so I used all shrimp and it was excellent. (The shrimp was from a bag of frozen shrimp, too). The kids liked it but a little too spicy for them.  Next time I'll reduce the pepper flakes but, otherwise, I'll definitely make again.  Very easy to do. I'm not sure what the reviewer who tasted flour did wrong but there was no flour taste.  Adding 2 Tablespoons of flour to thicken a sauce is a pretty standard thing to do.

This was delicious!  I added about a teaspoon of Emeril's cajun seasoning for some extra flavor, and a little bit of extra milk, since the sauce reduced rather quickly.  My husband said he was "very impressed" and gobbled it up!  I was happy to find a tasty cajun pasta recipe without all the cream.

Very good!  The crushed pepper is a must because it really gives this dish a kick.   My three kids under 5 just ate some cut up fettucini with a little sauce and had no complaints! :)

My husband and I liked this recipe, but it seemed like the sauce was a bit lacking. If it wasn't served right away hot, it seemed that the noodles absorbed a lot of the sauce. I made mine also with just shrimp and it was very good this way.

My family loves seafood but just thought this was okay and there were leftovers which is a true sign that they were not overly thrilled with the meal

My family loved this, even the eleven year old who claims he hates seafood.  I did add some garlic and a bit more crushed red pepper.  It turned out delicious, definitely a family favorite!
