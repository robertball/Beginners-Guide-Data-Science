This was very good and a snap to make.  I used a packet of bouillon powder, a little sprinkled on each mushroom, to greatly reduce the sodium of the recipe.  I used low-salt bacon also.  I used Pepper Jack cheese, and becaues I didn't have any chipotle peppers, I just sprinkled a little hot sauce in with the mayo.  Also, I only used 2 slices of bread per sandwich, instead of 3, and still found it to be quite filling.
