Very quick and easy but a little bland. Needs some more spice to it.  Perhaps some garlic and cayenne pepper or old bay.

To quote my father's favorite compliment for food, "This is disgusting -- I can't stop eating it!"  This is so delicious, and it's not safe in this house!  Upon the advice of a previous reviewer, I tried adding 1 tsp. of horseradish instead of a tablespoon, but I could hardly taste it so I think next time I'll try it as it's written.  I also added a few dashes of Old Bay Seasoning.  Fantastic -- and I need to tie myself to my chair because I want to finish it off right now.  ;-)

I was so excited about making this dip for my boyfriend. "Who" loves any kind of crab recipe.
 
This was a disappointment for myself and to him.
Maybe if there was less horseradish added the dip would be good.

I will never make it again to find out!!!

This was a waste of money and crab!!!

Good base recipe. I agree with some comments about it lacking something, and I added both the horseradish, and a lot of old bay. But it gets you going in the right direction. My wife took the left overs and wrapped them in wonton, fried them in some hot oil for 5 or 10 mins, and served them with a 50/50 mix of hot chili sauce and duck sauce for dipping.....PHENOMINAL.

I wish that I had read the reviews first.  It was bland and poorly consumed by my guests.  I'll bet the Old Bay makes a big difference.

Fantastic!  Easy to make and delicious to eat.  It wasn't quite as spicy as I thought it would be so you may want to add a little more horseradish for an extra kick.

This dip needed a little more pizazz.  I liked that it was fast and easy, and made in the microwave, but it needed garlic or seasonings or cheese, or SOMETHING else.

Thought it was a bit bland, we love horseradish so not enough tang for us.

This is really bland.  I added Old Bay, garlic powder, more worcestershire sauce- nothing helped.

I couldn't taste the crab meat. I would recommend two cans of crab meat and possibly some Old Bay Seasoning to taste.

I made this for a Halloween party and in 15 min it was gone. I followed it exactly by the recipe and even used suggestions from other people that made it. Delicious!!!

I have been making this for years. I agree that it needs something and I either serve cocktail sauce on the side or layer it on top. Layering it is most efficient but definitely looks disgusting after the first few servings. Serving on the side is much neater.
