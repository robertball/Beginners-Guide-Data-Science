I made two minor changes: In batter, I used plain yogurt with a tsp sugar and a splash of vanilla. In the filling, I used only 2/3 C of cottage cheese (all I had left) and used graham cracker crumbs. Even with less cottage cheese, I had a lot of filling left over and had to make a second batch of batter. Hubby and I thought these were really good. 22 month old didn't like them at all.

Very tasty, just has a lumpy filling - I would blend it and use 1/2 cream cheese next time.
