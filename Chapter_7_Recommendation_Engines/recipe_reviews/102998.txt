This took me almost an hour and a half to put together but the payoff was excellent. I made only a few small changes and that's to use what I had on hand. I added one extra bell pepper, I used lean ground beef and I used only one half of a can of the chipotle peppers in adobo sauce. I also added at least quadruple the amount of chili powder and oregano, I didn't use a whole tablespoon of black pepper (I just added it when needed, like when I was browning the meat and sauteing the vegetables) and I added two heaping teaspoons of cumin. This absolutely filled my largest soup pot to the brim so I split into two large crockpots to have it cook evenly and to save on power. After an hour, it's awesome. It has a serious bite to it from the chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, I'm really glad I asked for advice before I threw in the whole can. (And it was a small can, too!) I will recommend that you puree your chipotle peppers in with some of the tomato sauce so you get an even consistancy and don't have chunks of hot. Killer chili.

Love this, love this, love this!  I used Young's Double Chocolate Stout and only half of the chipotle peppers (as I was cooking for someone with chronic indigestion) and it turned out SPECTACULAR!  Served with Pinot Noir and Hawaiian Sweet Bread.  Rave reviews.    SIDE NOTE:  There are so many ingredients, if you feel like unleashing your inner Emeril, you get to yell "BAM!" a lot.  Loads of fun...

Great Chili~the adobe gives it a very different flavor. I used 1 pound of hot Italians and 1 pound of sweet Italians.  To spicy for my 10 year old.  Everyone else liked it lots!  Thanks for sharing.  Served it with sour cream, Frito scoops, onions and cheddar cheese to top it off.

This is a good recipe. My husband said he would like it to have more chili powder for a more "traditional" flavor. I love the meat combination.

i am making this chili as i type this (its simmering away) .. all in all it seems like a good dish (i took a taste at the begining and it seemed like a good START) but it definatly needed wayyy wayyy wayyy more chili powder and definatly needed to add cumin (which wasnt in the recipe) without added it is tasted like a meat stew, not chili.. plus i added a can of diced tomatoes (drained) for more texture and tomatoe flavor.. the chocolate is a great touch!! i will write another review after its finished and after i add more of my 'touchs' to it :)) but this is definatly a great STARTER dish by its self, but DEFINATLY needs more ump in it and more spices!!!

Reports are this is the best recipe we've had.  I had spicy Italian sausage so 1/2 the chipotle peppers, and still had plenty of kick. Ate it with a dark beer. Perfect

The biggest drawback was that the stew meat was tough - I dug it all out before serving and put it in the food processor.  Omitted the beer (made it for an AA event) and added two tablespoons of molasses.  Great flavor.  Makes enough to feed a crowd or save some in the freezer.

This is such good chili! Took a big bowl to a friend's and expected to take some home. Nope! It was all gone! (Thank goodness I left a bowl at home for us!) Awesome flavor! Makes a HUGE pot!

I cut the recipe in half and actually forgot the bacon because I was going to add real bacon bits toward the end (had on hand), used half the onion and chipotle peppers and doubled the garlic per family requests and would of simmered longer than 1 hour but no one could wait, the aroma was filling the air. Loved the thick stew like texture, it was wonderful, a great change from my typical chili with ground beef. A keeper, will make again and again!

No changes needed. This recipe is so fabulous! I've made at least 5 times for big groups for games, ski trips, and just random winter nights. It's so spicy, smokey, and delicious.

I make this once or twice a year during the fall months and it gets rave reviews. For the adobe peppers, what I have found is to wrap them in cheese cloth and tie it off, then leave it in the pot to simmer for HOURS-gets the flavor in and allows you to remove them so the chili is not overly spicy.

Made 1/2 portion yesterday for Super Bowl 50. Flavor was awesome. Took about 1 hour to prep until simmer but well worth it. Had a 2nd bowl later and was even better. Definitely will make again. Thanks for sharing, is really a great recipe!

Great! Didn't use the oil and cooked the onion and pepper in the sausage grease. Used my husband chocolate porter homebrew. Left out the bacon because I forgot to buy it and left out the chipotle peppers because I was cooking for a group with lots of young kids and adults.

I usually try a recipe one time by the book and then play around with it afterwards.  I made this chili for the first time tonight and would not change a thing. Excellent chili...and I did it having some trepidation about the recipe. 

It takes a long time to prep.  The 45 minutes advertised seems short but maybe I'm just slow. But the chili itself is very, very good.  

The only thing I might try next time is to cook the bacon first so that it's not as chewy.  Or perhaps browning the meats first, draining the fat, and then mixing in the veggies.

One reviewer suggested blending the canned chipotle pepper in advance.  I did that with some of the beef broth and I second her recommendation.

I was surprised at how hot the chili came out. Some reviewers suggest halving the chipotle peppers and you may want to do that if you do not like your chili spicy.  I do prefer the heat and, with the (7 oz) whole can, it came out just right for me.  You can always make it hotter later.

Excellent recipe.  I made an adjustment and only used the can of cream corn instead of 1/2 a can of normal corn and 1/2 a can of creamed corn.  The consistency was exactly what I was looking for.  Creamy and pudding like!  Superb!

I tried this yesterday. It was good, but I made a big mistake. I adjusted the recipe for 8 servings so I should have used 1/2 can of chipotle peppers, but I used the entire can. Man, was it spicy!!! I like spicy but this was just a little too much heat for me! The next time I make it I will use a lighter beer (dark stout was too much) less oregano and more chili powder and of course, 1/2 can of chipotle peppers. :O)
