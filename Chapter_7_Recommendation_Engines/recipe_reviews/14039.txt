This quiche came out great.  We made some substitutions though.  We couldn't find the packaged "herb and lemon soup mix" called for in the recipe, so we substituted spices from another quiche recipe (1/2 tsp salt, black pepper, a pinch of thyme, 1/2 tsp. dry mustard, and top with paprika).

Very good!  I omitted the crust and baked them in muffin tins to make 16 mini quiches.  They make great leftovers and are easy to take in to work or travel with.  Spray with cooking spray and bake about 30 minutes.  I've made this recipe with the crescent roll crust before and liked it, but it did not make good leftovers because the crescent rolls got a bit soggy.

Excellent!  My first quiche.  Turned out perfectly.  Made it for a date with a picky vegetarian and she had seconds and asked to take some leftovers.

A couple of notes - used a 9.5in. pie plate and needed 1.5 packs of crescent rolls to cover it.

Sauted in olive oil instead of butter.

Added a hand full more spinach while sauteing as it reduced considerably.

Had to bake it for 45 minutes, covered edges of crust with tinfoil after 30 to keep from burning.  Turned out perfectly browned and set in the middle.

Put a thin layer of the cheese in the bottom over the crust before pouring in the filling.

Used about 1/3 of a 1.5oz pack of Knorr garlic and herb seasoning.  Could maybe use a little less.

Let it cool at least 10 minutes before serving.  Very hot in the middle.

This was a big hit for Father's Day brunch at our house.  Hubby finished the leftovers all by himself! :-) Like several others, I used the Lipton Savory Herb soup mix, but I only used 2-3 teaspoons of the packet, based on others' notes that the entire packet could be too much.  This was perfect for our taste.  I used baby Portobello mushrooms...quite good. Had to play with the crescent rolls a bit(like others) to get the crust laid out properly, and, in retrospect, would have used the small can (not the "Grands" version) of the crescent rolls--I had quite a bit of excess dough. Our particular dish needed to cook almost 50 minutes to set properly in the middle, but it turned out quite well. Reheats well, too. Thanks, Mindy!

Excellent quiche recipe that I will make again.  Not too keen on the crescent rolls but the filling taste wonderful and I will find a substitute for shell.

This recipe was fabulous!!! I had a get together with my girlfriends and thought I would make a quiche to munch on.  Everyone loved it, I even had to give out the recipe.  I will definately be adding this recipe to my box - I have a bridal shower coming up and will make it for that occasion as well.

I thought this was a great recipe...easy to make.  My husband wasn't a big fan of the crescent roll crust, but I thought it was good!  Next time I will make it with a pie crust instead.

Quiche was very good. Even my picky 20-year old loved it. I couldn't find the lemon herb soup mix so I used lemon herb sauce mix. The taste was very good. Thanks! Barb

I've made this both with and without the crescent roll crust. It turned out beautifully both ways.  I couldn't find the soup mix this recipe calls for. However, just your standard spices are needed to make this flavorful. I put in pepper, salt, parsley flakes, garlic powder, and some chili powder.  This is a great recipe for substitutions. I made a mushroom and spinach one about a month ago. A ham and spinach one after that. A celery, green chile, and spinach one today. They all came out excellent.

Delicious and moist! I used what I had on hand and was trying to use up in the fridge.  Followed another poster's suggestion and instead of the soup mix, used: 1/2 tsp salt, black pepper, pinch thyme, 1/2 tsp. dry mustard and 1/4 tsp. paprika. Not a fan of quiche crusts so made mine crustless using muffin tins coated with nonstick spray.  Used 1/2 tbsp each olive oil/butter and substituted: 1/4 red onion (minced) for the green onions, 1/2 cup each shredded cheddar/crumbled feta cheese (instead of Monterey) and 1 tsp butter and 1/2 cup nonfat milk (didn't have any half & half).  Added 1 tsp minced fennel. Will definitely make again - with fresh garlic as another poster suggested.  Hints: be sure to drain all the liquid from the cooked veggie mixture before adding to the eggs; a 6oz. bag of fresh spinach worked perfectly.

In response to the issue of burning the crust, here is how I chose to bake it:  I covered it in tin foil and baked it for 45mins at 400, then lowered the temp to 375, took the foil off and put it back in for 15 mins.  The foil will keep the crust from burning while the egg has a chance to bake.  The 15 mins at the end will brown the top.   I also subsituted skim milk for the half and half, and it turned out fine.  I think you can experiment with what you put in this and the types of cheeses.

Excellent and delightfully flexible dish! After reading the many reviews, I incorporated some of the suggestions and made a couple modifications of my own...

I used a muffin pan and made individual quiche.

For the filling, I increased the amount by 1/2 again (for instance, 3 cups of spinach rather than 2 cups), and then doubled the crescent amount.  2 8 ounce tubes.  Grease the muffin pan.  And for each pre-cut crescent triangle ("scalene", all three sides are different lengths), create one equilateral (all sides are equal) and one leftover smaller triangle.  Fill a muffin cup with the equilateral triangle, the three tips will poke out above the edge of the cup just a bit.  I used the leftover bits of two pieces to fill an additional cup.  In all, 16 crescent triangles filled a total of 24 muffin cups this way, and the filling done 1 1/2 fills exactly 24 cups as well.

They baked well at the same temperature, for twenty minutes.

Additionally, I had tasty results using 2% cheese, lowfat half-n-half, and lowfat crescents.

I've made this recipe twice and both times got rave reviews.  I used a regular frozen pie crust and Knors Vegetable soup rather than the lemon.  I traded this recipe with friends who used a garlic herb soup instead, and all agreed the vegetable was the best.  This recipe is super easy too!

Love this recipe!! It is so easy and inexpensive to make! Instead of the herb and lemon soup mix, I used dry mustard, salt, pepper, paprika, and thyme (as another user suggested). I changed the oven temp to 350 for 30-40min to prevent the crust from burning. I also tried it with bacon and it was great, a little too salty though. Next time when cooking with bacon, I will omit the salt, as the bacon provides plenty!

YUM!  I made a few modifications for my weight-watching self:  half the butter, reduced fat crescent rolls, skim milk instead of half and half, 1 cup of egg beaters instead of the eggs.  Baked for 45 minutes per other reviews - perfecto!

This is excellent. I think the writer means "sauce mix", not soup mix. Knorr makes a lemon herb sauce mix. I like the idea of using crescent rolls. I had to fuss with them a little bit, but it wasn't that hard to to. Will surely make again.

My first quiche ever and it was delicious!  I heeded others warnings about the soup mix.  I was making 3 quiches for a brunch and I used 1 Knorr's Vegetable Soup Mix (couldn't find the other) for all 3.  I also had frozen spinach - I used 1 bag for all 3 (hard to know how much to use becuase the fresh would cook down so much).  And I think the best change I made was that added some bacon.  I cooked the onions and mushrooms in a bit of the bacon greese instead of the butter.  One problem I had was that the middle didn't cook up completely and the crust was getting too dark to continue cooking.  Did anyone else have this problem?  I had some runny egg in the middle.  I didn't mind though becuase it was soooo yummy!  I will definitely make this one again!

This is a great recipe.  I could not find the lemon-herb soup mix either so I used Knorr's Leek soup mix.  Also, I used 1 cup of fresh spinache and 1 can of artichokes chopped up (we love artichokes).  It came really delicious, infact I made it 3 times in 4 weeks.  By the 3rd time I got the hang of how to place the dough so it looks really nice on top.  Thanks for the recipe!

Yummy!! Very fluffy and cheesy and delicious. Really enjoyed this. Used a few tablespoons of lemon pepper instead of soup mix, and a frozen pie crust. Both subsitutions were lovely.

So good!!  Instead of the soup mixture I used garlic powder, salt, pepper, and italian seasonings.  Mine cooked perfectly in about 35 minutes. This is a very versatile recipe. Next time I will use ham, swiss, and mushroom to change it up some.

This was very good . I used one batch of Never Fail Pie Crust 11 . I also substituted Savory Herb & Garlic soup mix and Taco cheese as I did not have exactly what was called for. It took 45 minutes and 10 at rest. Nice! Anna

Great recipe.  put all the veggies in the food processor because I knew the kiddos wouldn't eat the larger chunks.  Everyone loved it!  Even my 1 year old and 4 year old.  I didn't have the soup mix so used another user's suggestion except instead of 1/2 tsp of mustard I used a 1/2 a teaspoon of lemon herb spice mix.  I also forgot the green onions, but it still was excellent.  Had to bake for 40 minutes just like another user suggested.  Will repeat this one folks!

This turned out wonderful. The crescent rolls are a fabulous idea. I didn't have the seasoning packet so I added salt, pepper, lemon pepper, oregano, thyme, and a little garlic salt. I also did not have half and half so I used 2 TBS melted butter with 1/2 c. 2% milk instead. I also added some bacon. This is a fabulous recipe!

Great recipe that is easily adaptable to whatever you have on hand. I substituted frozen spinach (thawed), onion soup mix, and cheddar cheese, and added bacon bits for some extra flavor.

This was just delicious. I upped the spinach to 2 cups that I already steamed, omitted the mushrooms as I didn't have any, but used mushroom soup mix in place of the lemon herb mix. I added a bit of chopped ham and used swiss instead of Monty Jack cheese and really, this was just great.

This recipe is wonderful!  I substituted egg beaters for the "real" eggs, used reduced fat crescent rolls and 2% cheese.  I also used the Knorr brand vegetable soup mix instead of the one called for in the recipe.  This was a very easy recipe and it turned out so pretty - will definately make again and again!  Bake time was about 40 - 45 minutes.

Used frozen deep dish 9-inch pie crust, thawed at room temp.  Baking took 45 minutes.  Next time, I will place crust with mixture on a preheated cookie sheet and bake like my other quiche recipes recommend.  Otherwise, the outside pie crust edges browned very quickly.  Easy to make. Used frozen 9-oz. spinach, thawed, cooked three minutes in microwave.  Used pre-sliced mushrooms, since time was a factor for me.

FABULOUS! I made a few changes after reading past reviews: used a frozen pie crust instead of cresent rolls and I used one Knorr's Vegetable Soup packet instead of "herb and lemon" mix. The first time I made this it seemed a bit to salty for me. So, the next time I made it I withheld a bit of the veg. soup mix (maybe a teaspoon?) and it helped to mellow the salty flavor. Overall, I would give this recipe 10 stars for taste and ease.

This was an excellent recipe. I used hearty vegetable soup mix because I couldn't find the recommended kind. The quiche looked beautiful and my husband said it was one of the best he has ever tasted. This was my first quiche and it was very easy and delicious. Thank you for the great recipe!!

This was amazing!  Fluffy, flavorful, and the perfect amount of everything.  The herb and lemon soup mix is no longer made by Lipton so I used the Savory Herb with Garlic mix, measured out 1oz from the packet and it seemed to be the perfect seasoning.  I used frozen pie crust instead of cresent rolls.  I also used baby portobellas, yum.  I will be making this again!

Excellent quiche.  Made in my Pampered Chef Deep Dish Baker - one Grand Crescent roll package covered the bottom and sides of this perfectly.  Didn't have the soup mix so just used 1/2 tsp each of dried mustard, salt & pepper. Baked for 40 minutes to perfection.  An easy, satisfying dinner served with buttered toast. Thanks Mindy!

I didn't make this exact recipe. But I was looking for a good quiche recipe to make with what I had (and have never ventured into quiche territory)and so I tinkered and referenced this recipe with the recipe for the Sausage and Mushroom Quiche. This really helped me create a quiche that met my personal needs. This was great to use as reference as well as all the comments and reviews. Clearly we can tell that making a quiche is not hard and that we can tinker with ingredients. The important part is the milk/egg/cheese ratio. I used 1/2 c of half and half, and 4 eggs, fresh broccoli and fresh spinach (steamed), fresh mushrooms and green onion fried with butter, garlic and dried onion. It was a veggie heavy filling delight with 2 cups of cheese, and a frozen pie shell. It's not the same recipe here at all, but I think as a reference to help me on the path is worthy of five stars.

This quiche is very good.  I used herb/garlic soup mix (1/2 a package) instead of the herb/lemon soup mix and substituted artichoke hearts for the mushrooms.  Everyone at our Easter brunch loved it.  This is definitely a keeper!

Turned out perfect.  Variations: for the soup mix, I used one packet of Lipton Vegetable recipe mix; I used whole baby spinach leaves; I used egg beaters; and I added juice from half a lemon.  It needed to bake for 40 minutes.

Very yummie!  And it was easy to make, even for a cooking slow-poke like me.  I agree with an earlier review that it tastes better if you cut back on the dried soup mix (I used Lipton's Garlic and Herb), as it's a little too salty otherwise.  Thanks so much for sharing!

This quiche is SO yummy! This is definitly  my favorite recipe to make so far.

I've tried using frozen spinach and it works well, though I do prefer fresh.  Instead of the package of soup mix, I used whatever seasonings I have on hand plus a clove of minced garlic. I noticed the cheese rises to the top even after blending well, so I add some cheese to bottom of the roll covered pie plate before pouring in the egg mixture.

Three Stars! This is very good and pretty right out of the oven! I didn't have (or could buy) herb and lemon soup mix so I used a 1 oz. vegetable soup mix instead. Also, I used frozen spinach because I didn't have any fresh. If you use frozen spinach, remember to cook for three min. and drain.  It was excellent.  I can't think of one thing that would have made this any better.  Thank you for such a wonderful way to prepare spinach.

Mmm... so easy and so go good.  Before this recipe I would have said that I don't like quiche at all.. and my fiance doesn't normally like eggs.. but this is wonderful.  (And not "eggy"!)  Only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is that the crescent roll crust took a bit of work the first couple times I made this.  Now, we just cut the dough as needed and pat it together into the pan.  Followed other suggestions and use Knorr's vegetable/herb soup mix.  Also have tossed in bits of bell pepper and other finely diced veggies when trying to use them up.  Wonderful, versatile recipe!

Took longer to cook than the 30 minutes in the recipe, I took the suggestion of another reviewer and added artichoke hearts. It was a hit in my house with requests for more. I will be making this again.

i USED 1 PKG FROZ DEFROSTED SPINACH INSTEAD OF FRESH.  IF I USE FROZEN AGAIN I WOULD ADD AN EXTRA EGG AND A LITTLE MORE 1/2 & 1/2.  ALSO, USED MORE CHEESE THAN RECIPE CALLED FOR .  DELICIOUS.

I find this quiche to be too rich for my taste (and I don't like the crescent crust), but my husband loves it and asks me to make it frequently.  My grocery store doesn't have an herb and lemon soup mix, so I've added rosemary, garlic powder, and lemon herb seasoning to mine.  I give it 3 stars since he loves it so much... and I don't.

Wow...what a nice surprise this one turned out to be!  I was searching for something to do with my large container of spinach and happened to search spinach and mushrooms and stumbled across this one.  It's not often that I have a pkg of crescent rolls in the fridge, but I did tonight (reduced fat ones too!!).  So, I actually used 5% cream, light cheddar (no mont jack) & 2 eggs with 4 egg whites.  Didn't have a pkg of herb and lemon soup mix, so improvised with some dry herb/dip mixes that I have (used a combo of cheese/jalapeno with bruschetta herbs).  This turned out SO WELL!  Hubby was very pleased and even claimed he would be eating some leftover for breakfast (wow, shocking)!!  Thanks for the post!

This was the best recipe I have ever gotten off of allrecipes!  My children and husband gobbled it up and my husband's only request was that next time I make two!!!  I even substituted the half and half for whipping cream and the Monterey Jack for Chedder cheese (only because that is what I had on hand).  This will be a regular dish in my home!

This was a great recipe. I did alter some things after reading other reviews. I didn't use the crescent roll crust based on what other people said. I used a ready-made frozen crust and it was delicious. I couldn't find the lemon soup either, so I just used a garlic basil veggie seasoning packet (but only used half of it) and it was great. I also added a can of chopped artichokes. I loved the flavor it added, but I think it also added extra water, so I had to cook it for an extra half hour so it wasn't so runny. I used milk instead of half/half and sharp cheddar instead of monterey jack. I also added a few red pepper flakes for some zing! My husband, who is very picky, raved about it!

This was my first Quiche attempt, as I am sensitive to eggs, and I was NOT disappointed.  You just wouldn't believe how nicely the crescent rolls works out for a crust! It looks funny while you're lining the pan and draping the ends over the top, but the end result is absolutely perfect! This is very easy to make for anyone. It's even good heated up the next day - thank you!

I've never been a big Quiche fan, but decided to try this for the family. It was amazing. I fixed this up to the point of cooking it in a casserole dish and froze it for a latter dinner, it still came out perfect! Thanks!!

I made this for Mother's Day brunch and it was such a hit!  I really liked the crescent rolls as the dough, but I would suggest covering the edges with foil and until the last 5 minutes because they brown really fast.  Delish!

Great recipe.  My crust started to burn halfway through cooking so I covered it in a layer of shredded cheese (I used a mix of monterey jack and parmesan) and it created a delicious cheesy crust that my fiance could not stop raving about.  I will do this next time for the taste and highly recommend it as a finishing touch.

This was good.  My only complaint is the soup mixture is way too pungent for the quiche.  Next time, I will add only half a packet.

I used the Herb & Garlic soup mix as well - I like garlic better than lemon anyways :).  Crescent roll crust was a hit.  Turned out great!

This is really good and REALLY easy.  Couldn't find the soup mix, so I used Lipton herb and garlic.  Also had to cook a little longer, as there was a LOT of filling.  Could probably make 2 with the amount of filling.  Otherwise, great recipe.

The best thing about this recipe is the simplicity of the crust - it comes out brown and looks great.  I make it without the soup mix - I use some lemon juice, dill, and cilantro instead.  I also find that using less cream (or milk instead) and using marble cheddar instead of monteray jack makes the consistency better and it cooks a little faster.  Regardless, this never cooks in 30 minutes.  It always takes longer.  My family, including my "I hate quiche" husband LOVES it.

This was really good.  I used 2 packages of frozen spinach and that was too much, next time I will use only one package.  I could not find the soup mix so I went without, next time I will add seasonings.

Delicious, and very easy for someone who had never made quiche. However, I did make some changes. Instead of herb and lemon mix, I used garlic and herb (that's what the store had). Instead of mushrooms, I used Roma tomatoes. Instead of half&half, I used 3/8 cup + 2 tbsp. of lactose-free milk and 1/2 tbsp. of margarine. I had an extra pie crust, so I just used it instead of crescent rolls. Instead of monterey jack, I used mozerrella as it is less dairy-potent for someone who is lactose intolerant (lower the fat content, the lower the lactose). My only complaint is that I had to cook the quiche for around 50 minutes instead of 30... could have been something with my oven, so it's a minor complaint. The end result was wonderful.

I just loved this recipe. Using the crescent rolls really made this more interesting. I think it's a versitile recipe as well...I used a different soup mix. My boyfriend was upset that I ate all the leftovers:)

I tried this recipe last night and it was great...the leftovers are even better (had it for breakfast and lunch).  I made several substitutions as I was orginally using another recipe when I decided halfway through that I did not like it so I used a homemade crust instead of the crescent roles, used fat free milk for the half and half and omitted the sauce.  It was still divine...even my picky boyfriend loved it...will definitely try again as is.

I made this as my first quiche and it was a hit! I used frozen spinach and the garlic/herb sauce mix. I also added ham. I had people that don't even like spinach saying how good it is. I also looks beautiful. The only problem I had was it took longer to cook than 30 min and the crescent rool were getting too brown. I just covered them with foil , Thanks for the recipe!

First attempt at making Quiche. The cresent rolls made a nice presentation. Will use pie crust next time. Could not find the lemon-herb mix; used garic-herb and flavor is really great. The key for me is fresh spinach. Took this to a party and we only served appetizers and everyone really loved and wanted the recipe.

It was absolutely delicious!  The crescent rolls didn't work out very well, so I ended up making my own crust, but I've heard pie crust works well. I didn't have herb and lemon soup mix, so instead used Mrs. Dash Salt-Free Original Blend and it turned out great!

Perfect recipe..!  I was a little heavy on the spinach and cheese as i knew my dish was a little big. i used 5 eggs and about 3 cups of spinach sauteed in 4 teaspoons of butter.  Very good dish that allows you so switch out the veggie. I'm trying broccoli florets next time.

Really good, fast and easy. I didn't use the whole soup packet, and I'm glad I didn't. It was seasoned perfectly. If I had used the whole thing, I think the soup mix would have overpowered the whole quiche. Overall, very good.

Every time I make this, it is a hit. I made cupcake sized quiches using one triangle of dough and folding the corners in until it resembles a circle then placing it in a muffin tin. I spooned in some mix until it was just over the crust (the crescent rolls to like to rise!) and baked them at 375  for 20 minutes. They turned out great! It makes about 16 muffins with two tubes of crescent roll dough (I had a bit left over), and lasts a little bit longer, or it would have if people didn't grab more than one!

There is a herb/lemon SAUCE packet available but did not find soup.  These sauce packets are in the dried soup section at my store.  I would not use a whole packet for this size quiche.  Maybe a fourth or a third at the most.

Spinach should be wrapped in a towel to dry before adding.  I thawed mine in the collander to get rid of water and then cooked it as dry as possible in a skillet before putting it in the towel.  I toasted the mushrooms instead of sauteeing in butter.  Much more flavor.  Followed the suggestion to put cheese on top of rolls.  Used an extra egg yolk and a dash of mace.

This is a really nice recipe! The crust came out a bit burnt, so I guess I'll find an alternative for the crust. But the rest of the recipe is awsome. I couldn't find the lemon and herb soup mix, so I just went to the spice rack and got the lemon and herbs stuff and but a small handful in and it still tasted great.

I've made this twice so far and love it! I haven't been able to find Lemon Herb soup so I use half a packet of Zesty Herb marinate. I found a Lemon Herb seasoning that I will try next time. Make sure you don't use a whole pack of seasoning, it's TOO intense. Also, in order to make sure it cooks through, dry those veggies off as best as possible! I like to throw in spinach, broccoli and mushroons. It's delicious!

This was a very easy recipe.  I liked the idea of using the crescent rolls for the pie crust.  But the soup mix was definitely too much.  Next time I will use a traditional recipe with regular spices.  The soup mix made it too strong, and both my husband and I could "taste it the rest of the day", if you get my drift.

This was great. I substituted margarine for the butter and used non fat half and half and I (like so many others) was not able to find Herb and Lemon Soup Mix, so I used Lipton's Garlic and Herb. I only used 3/4 of a packet and this was perfect -- very flavroful but not overpowering. The crescent rolls worked perfect for me but I think that a pie crust would have been fine too.  Instead of Monterey Jack cheese, I used a Jack and Colby blend. This was great, everyone loved it. I will make again (but not soon as it is very fattening.)

Made this for my husband and another couple - eveyone loved it!  My grocery store does not carry lemon & herb flavor soup, so I substituted with a envelope of garlic and herb soup mix.  Very easy and tastes excellent!  I can't wait to make this again!!!

Very, very delicious.  I had more mushrooms  and spinach than the recipe called for (maybe half a cup more of each), and I only had heavy whipping cream, so I threw in another egg.  Also, I didn't have a spice packet, so I just cooked the mushrooms/onions/spinach in garlic butter and threw in some fresh rosemary, salt, and paprika.  [The only addendum that I would *strongly* reccomend to anyone who wants to try this recipe is garlic in one form or another - make sure your soup packet has some, or throw in some garlic salt, whatever.]  The crescent roll crust works and tastes delicious - the end presentation results in a colorful quiche with flavor to spare.

I didn't have the soup mix so I made it without and put in 2 extra eggs - I added bacon as well which I think made up for the soup mix - it was good and I will make again

Wonderful!  I made this recipe two days in a row.  It was wonderful.  The only changes I made were to use ready made pie crust and Knorr vegetable soup mix (I couldn't find the sauce mix listed).  I will make this again and again.  It is my new holiday recipe.

This was very good. I couldnt find the lemon-herb soup, so just went without. I had a little trouble getting the crust to cover the pie dish without any gaps, next time I will just use a store bought pie crust. I also used reduced fat crescent rolls, egg substitute and non fat cooking spray.

This recipe was my first attempt at making a quiche. The first time I made it, it turned out horrible - I had used frozen spinach. The second time I kept to the recipe and it was perfect! VERY GOOD. My hubby loved it!

I don't like quiche but my husband does so I'll usually eat one piece.  I made this and he was out but would be back for dinner so I went ahead and ate anyway. When he got he asked where the other half of the quiche was. he also says I never eat leftovers (which is usually true), but midday he decided to come home and eat lunch, so he asked where the quiche was. I ate it for lunch. So if I ate it, it was really, really good. I added artichokes and it was even better. i just had it last week and now i'm having it again. So far I haven't cooked anything twice (since I found all recipes) thanks

This was soo good. I doubled it to make two. I had a really hard time with the cresent rolls (duhh) and I couldn't find lemon herb, so I used knorrs Veg. soup mix. It was great! I had to run off a few copies for friends.

The quiche was good, again had to substitute garlic herb soup mix instead of lemon herb. (If you're serving vegetarians DO watch out for the chicken fat in soup mix).  Perhaps would have simply chosen to add oregano and basil instead of garlic/herb.  Be sure to wash your spinach well - my quiche was gritty still even after two washes!!!

I have made many quiches but this is now one of my favorites.  I love the crescent rolls as the pie crust.  I used this recipe when catering two breakfasts this past week.  It was a big hit!!!

Yum! Really easy! Made mine with pre-made pie crust on top and bottom.  I couldn't find the lemon herb soup mix, so I improvised with lemon chicken stir fry sauce from a packet.

Delicious! As others have stated, use less herb mixture (maybe 3/4 or 1/2 oz instead). Otherwise, very easy and fast

I tried this today and it was pretty good, except I think the recipe needs a little salt. I doubled the recipe and sauteed the veggies, along with minced garlic, in butter and olive oil. I used two deep-dish crusts instead of crescent rolls and they needed to bake for 45 minutes, then I turned the oven off and left them in for another 15. Could've used more cheese, too. Hubby liked it well enough. Maybe I'll tweak it a little bit next time.

I would have given this five stars, except that the crust leaves a bit to be desired. I could not get the quiche to cook fully without the crust turning dark brown and getting very soggy - not appetizing. So I use the "Basic Pie Crust" recipe on this site and it is INCREDIBLE! I also add a couple of pieces of torn up bacon to the quiche for flavor. Great recipe that I have used again and again!

this is a fantastic recipe.  i ended up changing around the recipe a little bit to save some money and to custom tailor the taste a little bit.  i substituted biscuit dough for croissant dough.  biscuit dough rises alot though so you have to carve out the center to keep it nice and thin. for this reason i would recommend sticking to croissant dough if possible.  make sure you make the crust ahead of time if you use biscuit dough.  i also added some sliced shallots and used laughing cow cheese.  this really made the flavor pop.  overall this is a fantastic recipe.  i was stoked because i only spent $3 for the ingredients.  i had everything else so all i had to get was biscuit dough, cheese, and spinach and spent a buck for each item at the dollar store.  you can also substitute milk for the half and half.  best of luck everyone!

Overall this was pretty tasty. I was not crazy about the flavor of the soup mix I used (Knorr's vegetable). I am going to experiment with the spices next time. Also ,I cooked this for one hour at 350. I had to cover with foil the last half so the rolls wouldn't burn. Worth trying!

Highly flavorful and tasty.  I couldn't find the lemon and herb soup, so I took the suggestion to use the herb and garlic.  I turned out SO well I don't think I will change that.

This recipe is great!  I couldn't find the lemon soup, so I used Lipton Savory Herb and Garlic soup mix.  I also used a ready made pie crust instead of the crescent rolls and a monterey-colby cheese blend.  My friends and family ate the whole thing in less than half an hour!

The outcome came out excellent but I still think it lacked some flavor. Perhaps more salt/pepper or other spices would liven it up.

I had to improvise a bit with this recipe since I couldn't find the herb and lemon soup mix.  So instead of the mix, I made up my own concoction using 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp lemon pepper, 1 tsp oregano, 1 tsp parsley, and 1/2 tsp marjoram.  It came out quite well.  The only oddity about this recipe was that I didn't seem to have enough dough to cover the sides and bottom of the pan.  However, it all turned out anyway and tasted just fine.  Next time I will try the herb and lemon *pasta* mix to see if that's better.

I loved this recipe but I used ready made pie crust instead of the crescent roll dough & I too couldn't find Lemon & Herb soup mix so I used Garlic & Herb.  I also took another reviewer's advice & didn't put the entire package of soup mix (about 1/2) & thought it came out excellent.  Will definitely make this again.

Easy to make, and reheats very well.  

Don't like mushrooms?  Reduce (or remove) mushrooms and replace with approximately equal amonts of spinach.

I doubled the recipe to make two, and didn't measure out the veggies exactly. I just used what I had on hand (trying to use up some mushrooms), and I used frozen spinich rather than fresh. They came out great, and the crecent roll points on top make a pretty design. This was my first quiche from 'scratch', and I'll definately make again!

I made this for the first time tonight and my husband and I loved it.  We ate the WHOLE thing in one sitting.  This is the BEST quiche I have ever had.

This is a really good recipe. Everyone I have served it to has loved it. I added zucchini one time, and I used Knorr Leek soup mix and added lemon juice. The crust is great. Thanks!

This recipe was great.  I held a
brunch for my girlfriend's birthday.
It was the talk of the party.  in
addition, this was the first time I 
made quiche! ;)

My only (minor) difficulty was that the 
crescent rolls were difficult to
separate in to triangles.  So, I'd
suggest that you buy a extra one to
be safe.


Thank you Mindy!

BTW this site is awesome also.  Easy to
use and navigate. A+ on the UI.

This was delicious!  I loved the flakiness of the cresent roll.  I did not have it go over the top just made sure I had a pie crust style bottom.  Great flavor will make it again, maybe in mini muffins

This is a great recipe! I couldn’t find. Lemon herb soup mix, so I used lemon juice and fresh herbs with a pinch of garlic salt. I tossed in some real bacon crumbles and slivers of ham to keep the troops happy. I also used Pillsbury butter flake crescent rolls, and used two packages with a thin brush of butter between layers. The crust came out beautifully crisp and came cleanly out of the pie plate, while inside it looked almost like filo. Last tweak: because I had it in the fridge, I sprinkled the top with mazithra cheese. This is going to be a monthly staple at our house.

Great recipe.  Made it without the crescent rolls..healthier...trying to avoid all the bread nowadays....so the recipe is perfect..I just added some feta cheese about 3 oz. I upped the eggs to six and it came out perfect.

I made this for an Easter brunch. Everyone loved it. I did need to tweek it because two family members are gluten free, so I omitted the sauce package and added my own spices to it. Would make it again

I made the following substitutions:

1) I didn't have crescent rolls, so I just used a regular pie crust and it was fine;

2) I had lemon pepper seasoning in my pantry, so I added in 1 TBL.. of  that and it really worked well in the quiche;

3) I added in 1 tsp. of nutmeg.  I thought that was such a nice compliment to the spinach, mushrooms, and lemon pepper.

Next time, I'm going to switch out the whipped cream and replace it with low-fat evaporated milk to cut the calories and fat grams.  Thanks for sharing such a nice recipe.  This quiche is perfect for a brunch, shower or light dinner.

I loved the taste of this but it took a full hour to cook at 375, and by that point the crescent roll crust on top was nearly burned. I kept it covered for the first 35 minutes because the crescent rolls were browning before the eggs had even started to set.

Love this! Easy to make for non-cooks like me, used suggestions from others for soups.  I split the mixture to make a smaller crust less quiche, and large muffin size ones in pastry.  30 minutes was perfect for the larger quiche, while 20-25 minutes was enough for the muffin sized.

My husband has not stopped raving about this quiche. It was so fast and easy to make! Only thing I would change is adding more spinach. It cooked down to so little. But I like spinach so that is a personal choice. I couldn't find the dry soup like others so substituted with onion and mushroom and worked great. But, wasn't sure how much to put in so just put half the bag. Maybe could have used more. Either way- would highly recommend! Would be great for big crowds!

This quiche was excellent.  I made it a little simpler by only using onion powder, spinach, mushrooms and a blend of Italian cheeses for the added ingredients.  The crescent rolls make a wonderful crust for quiche.

My son and husband raved about this.  I thought it was good but not spectacular.
I crimped the edges of dough as I could not seem to get the triangle hang-over thing. I am going to make it again soon.

This quiche is THE BEST.  I made it first as a vegetarian dinner for my boyfriend, and since then it's become one of my all-time favorite meals.  Preparation is a tiny bit time-intensive, but I've made it ~20 times and it's always come out well.  Just awesome!

I also used Lipton's garlic & herb soup because my store didn't carry a lemon & herb soup mix.  I used skim milk instead of half and half.  I think the recipe was pretty good and I'd consider making it again.  My husband really liked it.

The three people I made this for all LOVED this dish! It was easy, quick and tasted like I had put in a whole lot more effort than I did. I would only suggest adding some pepper to the egg mix to flavor it up some more.

My family loves this recipe. It's versatile. I've made it with different veggies and soup mixes. I use milk instead of cream to lower fat, and low fat cheese. This is very filling.

Thanks for sharing your recipe.

I couldn't find the herb lemon soup mix so I got Lipton's Savory Herb with Garlic and added 2 Tsp. lemon juice.  It was too "garlicy" for me.  I'll try again using the herb lemon sauce mix suggested by other users.  My dinner guest did enjoy it and even had a second helping.

This receipe is a great one; however to save time i didn't use the crescent rolls as listed.  I used a frozen pie crust and it came out great.  Great raves!! I also forgot to put the spinach in and it was pretty tasty!

Wow.  This was incredibly good. I made this for dinner and have been reheating it for lunch for two days now.  I will admit that I was a little skeptical of the crescent roll crust, and though it's a little different it does not detract from an all around fantastic dish.  Yum yum.  I will make this again... probably next week!

Great tasting and easy to make. My 4 year old even ate it (well, most of it). 
I did find that it took longer than 30 minutes to cook. Will definately try again.

Absolutely fabulous!I just made this tonight -my first ever attempt at something so "complicated" as a quiche!
I am a "real" vegetarian and could not use the lemon and herb sauce packet as i found it contains  chicken fat.I used a hollandaise packet and added some of my own herbs-  it was fabulous -30 mins was a few too long in my oven but it rose beautifully and frankly,we were astounded by the results!
Thank you Mindy!You are a goddess!!

Very tasty.  However, had problems getting it to cook through.  Knorr's Lemon Herb cream sauce had a bit too much dill for my taste, which was the only lemon herb packet I could find.  But really this recipe is very forgiving, could probably use any soup/sauce mix, such as mushroom garlic.

This recipe was a big hit a brunch I hosted. I used a frozen pie crust instead of the crescent rolls, and have tried it several times with different varieties of mushrooms. Each and everytime the quiche is delicious!

For  a novice cook, it's really nice and easy to make. Really the only problem encountered was spreading out the crescent dough. Either the pan wall was to high or I didn't have enough dough. It's still turned out great.

My family enjoyed this recipe.  I couldn't find the lemon herb soup or pasta mix so I had to use Knorr's Herb and Garlic Pasta Sauce and a squirt of lemon juice concentrate.  My 3 1/2 year old was neutral on this dish, which is a good sign.  Unless it is a dessert or a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, she will either eat with objection or be neutral.

Really liked this!  Made it low fat by using reduced fat crescent rolls, regular milk, and egg whites.  What a great way to get your veggies!

I really liked this.  My elementary kids didn't want to try it based on appearance but my toddler liked it.  I found Knorr Lemon Herb Pasta Mix 1.6 oz and McCormicks Lemon Herb Chicken Mix 1/1 oz in the store.  I was glad I read the reviews to find out about these because I cannot find the soup mix either.

This was my first attempt at making quiche. The recipe was easy to prepare and the taste was delicious.  I did use Pillsbury ready made pie crust instead of the crescent roll dough and I added more cheese to the top for baking purposes. It was fabulous! I highly recommend it and am looking forward to making it for friends. I used Knorr Lemon Herb sauce mix as well. Thanks for the great recipe.

This recipe was super! - It was great for dinner - my husband was surprised that I could make a "quiche". He said it was even better as leftovers - Very good recipe - tasty and filling.

EVERYBODY RAVED OVER THIS ONE!  I LIVE ON THE WEST COAST AND COULD NOT FIND A LEMON HERB SOUP MIX, BUT DID FIND KNORR LEMON HERB PASTA SAUCE MIX.  IT WAS PERFECT!  THIS QUICHE IS EVEN BETTER WHEN ALLOWED TO SIT FOR A WHILE BEFORE SERVING.  CAN'T WAIT TO MAKE IT AGAIN!

One of the things about living in a small town is the lack of selection at the grocer so I had to use Knor Veg soup mix instead of the lemon herb. Nonetheless, the quiche was great. Loved the buttery flaky crust.
