I cook mussels like this all the time with just a couple of adjustments.  Another reviewer said he/she would cook the mussels with plain water and pour the sauce over them, but you would loose all the lovely mussel "liquor" that comes with the cooking of them.  To thicken the sauce, boil it down a little before adding the mussels, and afterwards, add a little heavy cream and boil it down more, while keeping the mussels warm, under a damp cloth in a low oven.  Works like a charm and you don't loose any flavour.

This is the recipe I have used for years, and it is really excellent. I like this version better than most of the variations suggested by other reviewers, although I have added garlic on some occassions.

This is a pretty good recipe. I think I would put more butter in the sauce, and I would also add garlic. Next time I will make the sauce on the side and let it thicken up a bit, steam the mussels with regular water, and pour the sauce over the cooked mussles.

This is a wonderful, simple recipe. I probably used a little extra butter and shallots, and I added garlic (do it!) and a pinch of cayenne pepper. I also tossed in a pinch of kosher salt to help sweat the shallots and garlic. I didn't really measure my ingredients, and I think the key was to not overdo the wine. It can make the broth too sweet. And DO NOT use a grocery isle "cooking wine." Use a real dry wine like sauvignon blanc or chardonnay. Also, I kept an eye on my mussels, and they all opened after about THREE minutes. I HIGHLY recommend taking the mussels off the heat as soon as they open. Once they open, they're DONE. They were SO tender, and melted in my mouth. Five minutes would have made them chewy. My friends tonight said they were the best mussels they've ever had! I was inclined to agree :)

This is pretty good, and SUPER simple. I haven't spent a lot of time cooking mussels, and I knew I wanted butter and white wine. This was perfect. I took the advice of another reviewer and added an additional tablespoon of butter. I can see adding garlic to this too. We served it on top of a bed of linguine - great.

Delicious and quick!  Used 1 lb. of mussels instead (since I was cooking for one) and had more than enough for two meals.

These mussels were great and so simple. I substituted cilantro for the parsely. It was amazing! I also added some cream to thicken it up a bit. I will be making this one again!

Quick and easy. I made this last night as an appetizer for my husband's Valentine meal. I couldn't eat any because of a seafood allergy but the smell was divine. He loved them!

This recipe was equisite. The muscles were extrememly tender and the juices were definately worthy of dipping with crusty bread. No need to change a thing.

This will become one of our favorite recipes in our house.  I made it as an appetizer tonight, but will make as a main dish maybe over pasta next time.  The crusty bread dipped in the juice is addictive, also.  Thanks for the recipe!

We have never made mussels at home before yet enjoy them time to time at a reputable restaurant. I have to say that we both thought they were absolutely fabulous if not the best we have ever had. We followed the recipe however took tips from others that had added garlic and cream, substituting cilantro for the parley. We did the same, with the addition of half a large tomato as well. Outstanding. We will certainly make these again and have found a recipe we will enjoy for years to come.

I used this recipe as a base, but then also incorporated some ingredients from a second one (a restaurant copy-cat recipe).  Here's what I did:  I increased the butter to 4 Tbsp and added a clove of minced garlic with the shallots.  I omitted the white wine (only because I didn't have any in the house) and used a mix of half water half lemon juice.  I added 2 Tbsp of chopped fresh basil to the pot while steaming the mussels and omitted the parsley.  The final touch was a teaspoon of Pernod added to the pot at the end. Served with plenty of bread to sop up the yummy, garlicky, lemony juice.

I did some minor adjustments for a more heart and body friendly version:  olive oil instead of butter, chicken broth instead of white wine, and I added grape/cherry tomatoes and tons of cilantro.

Delicious!  It's definitely one of my favorite meals!

Very good, but it does need a tablespoon more of butter.  I used garlic instead of shallots and it was so tasty.  Dip some baguette bread in the sauce.  Yum!

Very fine, simple recipe.  I omitted the shallots, but added rough chopped onions and celery.  I liked the faint butter flavor. This one goes into my recipe box!

This is a great simple recipe, perfect with some crusty bread. I had an Italian sparkling wine on hand when I made it and it was perfect. I would suggest pairing this recipe with a lambic beer. I had an apple one just to have with this. I wonder how it would taste with a belgian wheat beer. Maybe someone else could try  it and post how it was?

I decided to try this recipe after seeing that Wegman's was selling 2lb bags of mussels for $4.99/bag (though, at 7 days old, I was skeptical if any recipe could outweigh the age of my seafood.)  Much to my surprise, the addition of an extra tablespoon of butter, a minced glove of garlic, and a dash of cream to thicken the broth, really brought these week-old mussels to life.   Definitely going to continue using this. Such an easy, quick, and filling meal, especially when coupled with a fresh baguette.

Good recipe but we tweaked it a bit. We used more butter, decreased the parsley by 1/2 and put sweet basil in it's place. We also added a couple of Tbsp's of half & half at the end to thicken it up. All in all it was a good base recipe but it definitely needed a few little tweaks.

Simplicity itself, but so delicious.  Well done.  Followed the recipe exactly, except I didn't have a decent white wine, so I used what I had.  The taste suffered as a result.  Don't scrimp on the wine, and don't use more than the recipe calls for.

Great recipe.  As we don't use alcohol but want flavor,  we used seafood stock.  I would upload a picture but after the two of us attacked three pounds of mussels there are none left!

Family and company really enjoyed these.  I made them according to recipe the first batch. The 2nd batch I followed  some reviewers comments. I added 2 cloves garlic, extra butter, some cayenne pepper, then poured at bit of 1/4  up cream in juice once mussels were removed and boiled it for a few minutes before pouring over. Both methods were wonderful, but the add ins did nothing but make a good recipe great. Ty

Loved this,  added just a little heavy cream, and the broth was great!  Best mussels I have ever made.

Super good!!!  I just ate 2 pounds of mussels for Sunday brunch and I could have eaten 4.  Had to use green onions and chopped garlic instead of shallots but the wine/butter broth made it delectable. By the way, my mussels had no "beards" so cleaning was simply a matter of rinsing in fresh water.

It's me and 3 kids under 10 and first attempt on 5 lbs of mussels from Costco. Turned out well. However for next time would not remove mussels from pot as soon as they open. I'd add 30-60 more seconds. Otherwise kids got grossed out by the ultra soft texture (which I don't mind).

Or maybe I was too aggressive to cook all 5 lbs at once? Thanks for the recipe!

This was my first time cooking mussels and I'm surprised to find it so easy.  Very delicious but I added sea salt to taste.  Overall, I like this simple and quick recipe.  Thanks for helping me overcome the fear of cooking mussels!

These came out perfect.  Recipe worked exactly as stated and oh what a fantastic flavor.  Only suggestion is that I added in a pinot gricio instead of what the recipe called for.  I think either would have produced the desired flavor.

excellent and very simple recipe. a true delicacy to a steamed-mussels lovers. you would think you're sitting in a brussels restaurant. one note though - the amount mentioned (3 lbs) should fit 2 servings, not 4. 
have fun with it...

This is a great "basic" recipe.  Made several times. Add more butter.  You'll need at least 2 cups of liquid.  I always stir in 3 minced garlic cloves & 1 T. of Pesto (store brand) & 1 t. Crushed red pepper flakes to sautéed shallots/wine 30 sec. before adding mussels & cover with lid.  When mussels open, I squeeze/stir in about 1/4 of a lemon and lay lemon slice in liquid, cover for 5 min.  Lemon and seafood always go together well.  Thanks so much for posting this recipe.

I'm in Brussels and was told 1kg of mussels for ea person. I have made this a few times.  The last time I used some winter beer that was left over from a party instead of wine, added garlic, and increased the parsley (neighbor said throw in any green herb) and shallots.  Best batch yet.  Served with steamed artichokes and fresh bread.  Everyone was VERY happy.

This was so easy and so delicious. I didn't have shallots and I added some garlic. I also didn't have fresh parsley so I just threw in some dry parsley. Tasted great and it only took 10 minutes to make!

Easy recipe...
Like the others, I tweaked it by using fish broth plus the wine and added 4 cloves of garlic to the saute part. Oh and a TB olive oil. I had 2 lbs and they were very large. Needed to be cooked a little longer or in a wider pot. The ones on the top were cooked but not as much as the bottom ones were.
Now I know for the next time.

I made this recipe with just a few adjustments. I used minced garlic instead of the shallot. I also used significantly more butter than the recipe called for (probably 2-3 times more), and I added a couple tablespoons of milk to make the sauce a little "creamier." It turned out great!

I incorporated all the suggestions.  I used a stick of butter, 1/3 cup shallots and 1/2 teas of herbes.  Reduced liquid, added mussels, removed mussels, added 1/2 cup of half and half, boiled one minute, returned mussels and thoroughly enjoyed!  A new family favorite.  Great sopping sauce!
