Well I liked it! Lots of yummy flavors all in one sandwich.  I like the mustard.

What's NOT to LOVE?!?! I had some beautiful tomato basil bread, so I used that, and, of course, I couldn't resist adding bacon, which made this over the top yummy! Great combo of flavors....this is a sandwich I will be making again and again! Thanks for sharing. :)
