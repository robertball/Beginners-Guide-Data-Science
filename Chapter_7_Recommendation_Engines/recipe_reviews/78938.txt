for the rice, do add one stalk of crushed lemongrass. it enhances the flavor and aroma. and for the sauce, blend the shallots and garlic together with the chile paste until smooth. First, saute the onion slices, then, add the chile mixture and go on with the directions provided here.

We substituted lemon juice for the tamarind, and it turned out great.  The recipe is a little complicated, but it's worth it!

For the coconut rice,instead of bay leaf i put in 1 pandan leaf and some fenugreek seeds.it really does enhance the aroma even more.as for the chilli sauce,i blended the shallots and the garlic with the chilli paste in a food processor and fry them together as i dont like the texture of limpy shallots.all in all,it is a very good recipe.a must try for all

Very good. I used Sriracha as Chili paste. Other than that I followed the recipe.
