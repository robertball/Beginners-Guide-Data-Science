Worked as a quick and simple dish that I served for a light supper, with a bit of chopped ham added. I used frozen hash browns instead of rehydrated, which shouldn't change the final product. I found potatoes to be more fragile to remove from the waffle maker than a true waffle, and the grids took a little more cleaning due to potato bits. If I repeat these, I plan to just fry the mixture like pancakes.

I tried this recipe this a.m. for brunch. Very tasty and a good way to use an appliance that usually only gets used for waffles. Instead of sour cream and salsa, I topped them with shredded cheddar.

This was a really great recipe, except WAY too much pepper!  Try 1/4 tsp if you want to feed it to your children.  I love that you used rehydrated potatoes since I have a lot of those, but could probably use fresh just fine. I threw in some chopped ham and a bit of shredded cheddar as well as rehydrated peppers and onions.  I was even short an egg in a doubled recipe and used a powdered one and it STILL turned out great. I liked it with creamy chicken gravy as well as salsa. My family and my pantry thank you!

Oh so yummy! My mind is going crazy with a on foods. Like bacon and cheese, sausage or even steak! I used diced ham in mine and that was the only change made to the recipe! I am a fan and will continue using this recipe, I can't wait to see what the grandchildren think! 

Also what a great freeze to go meal! I used foil to wrap the second waffle and then freeze, throw it in air fryer to reheat and it's perfect!

Delicious and super easy. I used only 1/2 tsp pepper. But I might add a little cayenne next time or seasoned salt just for a little more flavor. Thanks

So... I made two batches of this. One with the original recipe which seemed really flimsy coming out of the waffle iron and broke apart if you weren't extra gentle. So for the next batch, I added a couple of extra eggs. Let's just say my griddle came alive. Spitting and spewing all over the place. Both had a great flavor and my son who doesn't like peppers even liked them so I would definitely recommend trying them. They were also fun to make and experiment with.
