I didn't use the egg, felt it was unneccesary. I didn't expect the Italian dressing to come through in this recipe but it did and it was a nice change. I flopped the flour/cornmeal ratio around but that is just personal preference. If you love fried catfish then you should really give this one a try (minus the eggs). I cut them in sticks but the finished product does not hold the stick form.

This was delicious! I wish I had doubled it because my family wolfed it down. The Italian dressing is a great touch and the breading is wonderful!
