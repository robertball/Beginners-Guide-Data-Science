I cut the recipe down for 3 ppl, maybe that was the problem.  I even added pan drippings and it just wasn't what I expected. Will try half the flour next time like other recipes call for and less butter/pan drippings. Sry.

I did not enjoy this recipe at all! It needed way more flavor, and I did not like the way it tasted.
