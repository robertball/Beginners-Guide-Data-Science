Had to change the recipe slightly as I didn't have all the ingredients on hand.  I used cream of chicken soup (w/out herbs), an onion soup mix, fresh mushrooms and white zin.  I also used frozen chicken breasts that I cut up since I was in a hurry and cooked over medium-low heat for about 2 hours.  My husband loved it!!!  Haven't heard him rave like this in quite a while.

This turned out so well! I didn't have any wine so I omitted that, used cream of mushroom soup instead of the mushrooms, added a minced clove of garlic and some fresh rosemary and it turned out very well--so tender! Its a new family favorite.

I thought this was very good and very easy.  A good combination in my book!  I followed the suggestions of a few others and added an envelope of Lipton Onion Soup Mix instead of the chopped purple onion.  Also, I didn't have the cream of chicken and herb on hand so I tried Cream of Chicken Dijon soup instead.  It had a great flavor!  Most of all, I just couldn't believe that was all there was to it.  Throw it all in the crock pot and a few hours later we had a nice dinner.  I served it over rice one night, had a few leftovers that I served over small shell pasta for lunch later.  Both were very good.

I changed nearly everything about this recipe.  I used 2 cans of soup, 1 cream of chicken and mushroom and 1 98% fat free cream of chicken. I used pearl onions instead and fresh mushrooms and omitted the wine.  I read other reviews about concerns over bland chicken, to fix that I browned my seasoned frozen chicken breasts over high heat and then added them to cook in the crock pot, it worked perfectly and I think it wouldn't have been as good without doing that.  Served it over egg noodles with French bread.  It was really yummy and a great concept.  Thanks!   ***UPDATE*** I finally managed to remember white wine at the store and it makes quite a bit of difference in the flavor.  It's a pretty heavy sauce and the addition of the white wine gives it an almost crisp feeling in my mouth.  It's a subtle difference and I noticed but my hubby didn't.

No question --this is super easy and as a mom of 2 small kids--I will certainly make again.  I followed the recipe exactly minus the marsala wine and it was delicious--and I did sprinkle the chicken with a little garlic.  I thought the chicken was very moist and the sauce was great--I spooned it over my green beans.  Also--very healthy--only 5 weight watcher points for a filling serving!!!!! A keeper!

Super easy is right. I used whole chicken breast instead of strips and fresh mushrooms instead. It turned out yummy.

Like the other reviewers I added onion soup mix but also left in a few white onions.  I used a few dashes of generic white wine and also added about 3/4 can of milk while cooking to give it a little richer taste.  Left out the mushrooms because I didn't have any.  When the chicken (boneless skinless chicken thighs because they are cheaper) was done cooking (I left it in for about 6 hours alternating high and low on the cooker), I took it out and placed it in a dish, and then added a little flour to the pot, making a really nice gravy.  Served over wide egg noodles... and everyone loved it!

My husband and son are quite the food snobs and usually have something to say about any food I fix but all I heard from them was moaning and lip smacking.  When they were done I was ordered to make this again.  I have to admit that I didnt follow recipe to a "T".  Had to use what I had on hand.  I put chicken in a bag and added garlic powder, dried thyme and EVOO. Mixed until well coated.  In a fry pan I heated EVOO and then did a quick brown on the chicken.  Removed chicken and put in lined crock pot.  I put a sliced sweet onion and fresh mushrooms in the same hot fry pan and deglazed the pan with wine. I added cream of celery and chicken and rice soups to the mushroom mixture. (It was all I had) Simmered for short time to mix well.  I poured mixture over chicken in crock pot.  It cooked on low for aprox. 2 hours and I served it over rice with a side salad.  I could tell you how good it was but the empty crock pot does all the talking.  YUM!

This was really yummy and very easy. However, I changed the recipe as follows: I used purple and yellow onions, fresh mushrooms as well as canned, a crushed clove of fresh garlic, since I couldn't find cream of chicken with herbs, I used cream of chicken and mushroom and added fresh thyme, parsley and a pinch of dried rosemary. I also added a second can of golden mushroom just for more sauce. I added a Tbsp of Marsala. Served with egg noodles and peppered asparagus. My house was happy!

Let me just say one word, "Amazing"!!  Even my pickiest eater, a 10 yr old had seconds.  I had to change a couple of things because I couldn't find any cream of chicken with herbs soup.  I used a can of cream of chicken and mushroom and added the pkg of onion soup mix for seasoning.  I omitted the chopped onion because of the soup mix.  I also used fresh mushrooms.  Not only did this smell amazing while cooking, it tasted incredible.  I served with green beans and mashed potatoes.  There was enough gravy from the chicken to put on the mashed potatoes.  This will definitely become a regular recipe in my collection.

This is one of those recipes that my husband looks at me like I am crazy while I am throwing it all together, then while he is eating all he can say is "MMMM! This is awesome!" I use my crock pot alot, and this is one of the easiest, best dishes that I have done in a while-it always amazes me how just 4 ingredients thrown in a pot can make such a yummy dinner! I did make a few changes, as usual. I used 2 cans of soup because when I put the cream of chicken& herbs it just didn't look like alot, so I also threw in a cream of chicken & mushroom as well; but to be honest you would probably be fine with just the one can. I would have also seasoned and browned the chicken breasts first but I was pressed for time to get it in the crock pot, but next time I will definately do that. I used bone in chicken breasts,white onion and fresh sliced baby portabella mushrooms;and I also threw in some garlic and additional herbs. My 3 year old is a huge mushroom fan (the kid won't eat a piece of pizza without mushrooms!), so she loved this but everyone else did too! I am always looking for recipes that I can add to my slow cooker meal rotation and this is definately a keeper!!Thanks for the recipe!!

Tried this with low fat soup and regular and it just doesn't have enough flavor.  However the concept is good, it is missing something.

This was a good starter recipe! I didn't have the chicken and herb soup on hand. Instead I used one can of Golden Mushroom, and one can of reduced sodium Cream of Chicken. I also added some frozen mixed veggies, garlic, onion powder, pepper, chicken broth (instead of the wine), then, at the end of cooking time, added some Swiss cheese. Perfect! Big hit!! Served with garlic bread. I'll be making this again! Thanks, Jamie!

I loved this! AlthoughI must admit, I used skinned chicken thigh on the bone (dark meat is just juicier!), which I quickly browned (2min max)with maragrine, chopped green onion and Mortons Seasoning Salt. Added an extra can of cream of mushroom and 3 tbs of marsala(could've added more). My husband HATES chicken...He LOVED this dish, because it was full of flavor and very juicy!!! Served it over white rice. Thanks for the basic idea.

This is so easy and so good. I used dry minced onion instead of fresh, and subbed lemon juice for the wine. I also mixed garlic powder, dried thyme, rosemary, and parsley into plain cream of mushroom soup. I steamed leftover chinese rice in the microwave and served the chicken over it, with salad on the side.

Very easy recipe! My whole family loved it.  I have tried this recipe with and without a packet of onion soup mix.  Using the soup mix gives the recipe the added "kick" that it needs to liven it up.  I have served this over rice, but egg noodles would probably be great, too.

I really liked this recipe.  It was definitely bland.  I would recommend using an onion soup mix to add to it.  I used cream of mushroom soup because I was unable to find cream of chicken and herb.  Instead of red onion, I would use shallots.  I also added 1/2 cup of marsala wine as opposed to a dash.  Would make again but using the ingredients I mentioned above.

This is my new favorite slow cooker dish!! I used low fat cream of chicken instead of the chicken & herbs and just added some chicken seasoning. I also used fresh mushrooms and didn't cut my chicken into strips. I subbed white wine because that's what I had on hand. Served over rice it was fabulous! I already want to eat it again!

I changed a few things to this recipe and it turned out delicious! As another reviewer suggested, I dredged the chicken in herbs/spices (paprika, fines herbs, thyme, Lawry's seasoned salt, garlic powder, black pepper and a little flour) then browned it in a skillet. Transfered that to the crock pot, then sauteed chopped onion, garlic and mushrooms in a little butter, added port wine and let it simmer for a bit  to burn off the alcohol. Added that to the crock pot, along with  low sodium cream of mushroom soup and 1/2 a chicken boullion cube. Cooked on low for about 6 hours. Served over rice. Had great flavor and nice brown color due to the browning of the chicken. Also, the longer cooking time made it super moist.

I made this last night, and while it was very easy, I thought it was only so-so.  There is something missing.  I couldn't find the the cream of chicken with herbs soup at the store, so I used cream of mushroom and a Tbsp of Italian herb seasoning.  I also added a couple cloves of minced garlic and a 1/4 tsp ground black pepper.  I served it over pasta.  I can't quite put my finger on what's missing.  Maybe salt?  That could be why the people who put Lipton onion soup mix did like the dish.  That soup mix is really high in salt.  I don't think I will make this again.  UPDATE:  Yep, it was missing salt.  I heated the leftovers and added some salt and it vastly improved the taste.  A lot of reviewers said that they added Lipton onion soup mix, which made it too salty.  So I recommend fixing the recipe as is, but adding salt and pepper to taste.  My suggestion is 1/4 to 1/2 tsp. of each.

This recipe was very easy but tasted just ok.  I made some changes per other reviewers:  I added an envelope of french onion soup mix instead of the raw onion, and I used cream of mushroom soup instead of the cream of chicken because that's what I had on hand.  I worried it would be too salty so I added a little milk.  It tasted mostly like onion soup mix but I have to say my three children ate it without complaint (which rarely happens)!  I think I will try this again and stick to the original recipe.

I love slow cooker recipes because I am a morning person who likes to get things done early in the day.  This recipe is quick to put together and my whole family loved it served over rice.  It's one of those recipes I can make with stuff I usually have in the house.  Love it!!

This was the first time that I've ever made this dish.  This recipe was good.  I did, however, coat the chicken in a ziploc bag with 1/4 cup flour and 1 teaspoon of black pepper. I added a clove of crushed garlic  to the combined ingredients and I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned.  Trying to stay away from too much salt and preservatives.  I served this with garlic mashed potatoes and fresh green beans.  Yum!!!!  Will make again.

This was pretty good. I used fresh mushroom since I had them and the wine was whatever red I had open (Merlot, I think). I followed the recipe otherwise and the flavor was delicious. Only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because some of the chicken was dry even though it had sauce. Could be that it was white meat chicken which is not my favorite.

Not sure why but I really didn't care for this. Perhaps it was the marsala wine or maybe the soup but the taste just didn't appeal to me. Not a big hit with the family either.

This dish was delicious and easy.  To give it more flavor, I browned the onion and fresh mushrooms and added them to the slow cooker with regular cream of chicken soup that I had and 1/2 cup of cabernet sauvegnon that I also had on hand.  SO GOOD! Thank you Jamie for sharing this great recipe.  I will definitely make it again as the family loved it.

I altered the recipe a little and normally don't review if I do that but I feel compelled to agree with it tasting like it is "missing something". I had 3 lbs of boneless breasts so I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup, 1 packet of onion soup mix instead of onions, 1 can of mushrooms and marsala wine. I served it over mini bowtie pasta with a side of brocolli. 
It smelled great, the mushrooms were tasty, it wasn't terrible but it wasn't yummy either. Wish I could pinpoint exactly what it needed...

This was a huge hit with my family. Very easy to make. My son told me it was "restaurant quality". I served this dish with roasted potatos and onions but it would be great with pasta.

The chicken was really juicy!  But the cream of flavor was bland.  Using canned soup is cheating, but easier.  I also used fresh mushrooms and a dash of Chianti because I had it on hand.  I think it would be good over rice with a side of green veggies.

Might have been slightly my fault...by overcooking but the chicken was tough, the sauce very blase and if I hadnt used freshed mushrooms I would have been mad.

This was REALLY good.  I forgot to defrost something for dinner and all I had were chicken legs and thighs.  I literally threw them in the slow cooker completely frozen and added the remaining ingredients plus whole garlic and cooked it on high for about 6 hours.  The result was fantastic!  The chicken fell off the bone and was so moist.  The sauce made an excellent gravy that we used over mashed potatoes.  My husband and our 4 year old loved it!  Will definitely and make again

We had this last night and it was fabulous!  I used a regular yellow onion instead of a red one, and instead of Marsala wine I used a dash of red wine vinegar.  I also added some herb chicken seasoning and a dash of garlic powder.  During the last hour of cooking I put some broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots on top.  Everything turned out great.  Thanks for this recipe!

My family loves this chicken. I always use 2 cans of cream of chicken and mushroom soup, skip the onions and use Lipton onion soup mix instead, boneless chicken thighs (whole), and more than a dash (1/2 cup or so) of wine (prefer white wine to Marsala). I serve it over egg noodles.  Delicious!

The first time I made this recipe I did it as listed. As others said, it was a little bland and lacked the kick my family normally likes. The second time around, I marinated, seasoned and seared my chicken first, then added some potatoes and carrots to the mix. Because of the added ingredients and my desire for more sauce, I used 2 cans of cream of chicken and 1 can of cream of mushroom. Finally, I added some chicken stock, and halfway through cooking I added some more of my favorite seasonings to the mix. This came out SUPERB, and is going to be a staple for cold, busy days!

This was delicious! I would have been better off just following the recipe on this one though, I think!  I didn't have the right wine or soup on hand, so I used white zin (I know, I know) and cream of mushroom soup.  Instead of canned mushrooms, I used a fresh, coarsely chopped portabello cap (Bonus points!) & threw in about a tsp of minced garlic.  You really don't need to add more than a splash or 2 of wine; also not a good plan to thin out the soup with more liquid than is called for, especially considering the relatively short cooking time.  (this was my first mistake, and the dish took about 4 hours instead of 3.  The chicken juices thin it out plenty as it cooks.)  Before adding the chicken, I dredged it in a mixture of salt, pepper, parsley, sage, thyme, rosemary, garlic powder, & paprika.  This added a lot of good flavor, especially since i didn't use the chicken & herb soup; BUT the sauce turned out very salty; next time I will omit or greatly reduce the salt I put on the chicken.  Even still, it was amazing.  All of us--me, my husband, my 2 1/2 year old son, and his little friend--all loved it!  We will definitely enjoy this again and again!

I followed the recomendations of others and used onion soup mix instead of onion.  (I was out of red onion).   I also only had regular chicken soup, so I added chicken seasoning as the "herbs".   It was still delicious, an super easy.  I'm sure this will be a crockpot family favorite.

Just made it and loved it! I made a few minor changes to the recipe. Instead of cream of chicken and herbs, I just used cream of chicken and added my own spices. My husband doesn't like onions so I took those out too. Then I put it on top of some mushroom rice and it was delicious :)

this was a tasty EASY meal to make. Just be careful not to overcook or the chicken dries out. 3 Hrs max. 

I used fresh mushrooms, 3 T sherry ( a replacement for Marsala), and served over angle hair pasta. Yum

We enjoyed this! Following reviewers comments it was bland, I added onion soup mix as well as the red onion.. I browned the chicken, sprinkled it  with cayenne pepper and tossed fresh mushrooms and some chunked red pepper into the pot along with a dash of Worcester  sauce and some chopped garlic. It was tasty and I'd make it again.

I couldn't find chicken and herbs soup, so I just used cream of chicken and added some spices to make up for the herbs.  I also used fresh mushrooms instead of canned, added some fresh garlic, and substituted chicken thighs.  The recipe was not specific on how much marsala to use, so I used 3 tbsp.  This turned out wonderful.  There is enough sauce to pour over the chicken and the noodles I served it with.  Will definatly make again

We'll have this again.  I did substitute cream of chicken and mushroom because our local store was out of chicken and herb.  Maybe that would have been a little better.  But, it was pretty good.

I followed the recipe exactly and found it lacked flavor.  So, I added 8 oz. of reduced fat Velveeta cheese and tada...it gave it the added flavor I felt it needed.

The flavor was good but the chicken was dry.  Next time I will reduce the cooking time or not cut the chicken into strips.

Yummy!  Mine came out a bit dry, but that was probably because I decided to break in my new 6.5 quart crock pot using only 4 chicken breasts.  I think that had I used my smaller one the chicken would have been covered by the sauce, making it moist.  But the flavor was excellent, my husband really loved it.  I served it with brown rice and mixed veggies, and the sauce was amazing on the rice.  I will definitely be making this again!

This recipe lived up to its name- super easy.  This was a good meal for a busy day.  I also used the onion soup mix, but then with the 2 soups it's pretty salty (I added some peas to cut down the saltiness a little, and ate with rice).  Something else that I found is that you can put frozen chicken straight into this recipe (without thawing), just add a little extra cooking time.

I read the reviews and thought I'd try the onion soup pkt...but, I don't like the dry soup flavor!  Instead I used a half packet of Frito's green onion dip (for chips) mix.  Omitted the wine also, it turned out yummy!

I thought this was yummy.  After reading the other reviews, I added 1/4 cup white wine, instead of Marsala, and added a can of cream of mushroom soup.  I also added some cayenne pepper, some black pepper and some salt, but there was something still missing.  Maybe some garlic would help.  Next time I may add half a cup of chicken boullion to help bring out the flavor more, instead of the cream of mushroom soup.  Thanks for another winner in our house!!!

Super easy and pretty tastey.  I put it in my slow cooker on high for 2 hours and the chicken was still very tender.  My 2 year old son enjoyed it!

For being so easy it was a lot better than I expected.  Served it over rice and it was pretty darn good.  My five-year-old enjoyed it.  This one makes it into the recipe book.

Like many other reviewers, I added a package of onion soup mix. I also used boneless chicken thighs instead of breasts because my family likes the richer flavor better. For a change, I sometimes add a roughly chopped yellow pepper and 4 tsp curry powder about 1 hour before mealtime. I like this recipe very much because it is easy to add an ingredient or two and have a new taste. My family approves!

Very good & easy.  Left out the mushrooms as we don't care for them.  I subbed one packet of french onion soup mix for the onion as some other reviewers recommended.  Couldn't find chicken w/herb soup, so I used plain cream of chicken.  I used about 1/2 cup of cooking sherry instead of the marsala.  Very flavorful, but I would recommend a longer cooking time for more tender chicken.

This is one of my favorite recipes, but it's the first time that I've used it for a slow-cooker though. This is what I did... I used frozen pearl onions instead of the red onion, ~1/3 cup of cooking sherry (beer works great too) and a  dash of seasoned pepper. Then I serve it over wide egg noodles (or rice is good too). Quick annd easy and yummy! Enjoy!

Great start, however I took some of the other comments and did the following. Used 11/2 lbs chicken tenders dredged in a plastic bag with 1 tablespoons of black pepper, sage, thyme, rosemary, garlic powder, paprika. parsley. Brown chicken on both sides for about 1.5 minutes and move to Slow Cooker. Add 1 10.75 oz can of Cream of Chicken Soup, and 1 10.75 oz can of Cream of Mushroom Soup and package of Lipton onion soup mix. A couple of dashes of White wine. Cook on Low for 3 Hours. Serve over yellow rice.   I have renamed this.  Slow Cooker Herb Chicken.

Having not yet tasted, this recipe was a good starter guide to get that chicken marsala-like recipe for a slow cooker.  I changed a lot.  I used a can of 98% fat free cream of mushroom, 1 cup of fresh white mushrooms, 1/2 cup of marsala wine, 1/4 cup of sherry (my favorite ingredient), 1/2 teaspoon of oregano, 1/4 teaspoon of pepper.

I omitted any garlic, but did add 1/2 cup of sliced onions.  Lastly, I used frozen, thinned chicken breasts that I thinned before freezing.  This is bound to be good tonight.

I didn't have the Marsala Wine, that might have made a big difference in the taste, I don't know. Anyhow, I liked the recipe... it was easy and quick. It wasn't sensational or anything, and my hubby didn't seem to like it that much. We discovered by accident (when some salad dressing from our salad mixed with the sauce) that it tastes a lot better if you mix some greek dressing into it.

This was liked by both the kids and adults.  We had about 2 1/2 lbs vs. the 1 1/2 so I added a can of cream of celery soup and, following other suggestions, used the onion soup mix instead of the onion.  I don't like using the "low" setting on the crock pot for chicken, so I cooked on high for about 3 hours.  The chicken was moist and flavorful.  Will make again.

I made this last night for dinner and was extremely disappointed.  It made the whole place smell wonderful so I couldn't wait to eat dinner. I did make some changes to it (after doing everything exactly as the recipe called for), I added a packet of onion soup like many suggested but then I also added some garlic, thyme, rosemary, poultry seasoning, oregano and a dash of celery salt. After I took the chicken out I added just a touch of flour to try and thicken the gravy and I then served it over jasmine rice. The whole dish just wasn't as flavorful as I would have liked at all and my boyfriend and I were quite disappointed.

I thought it was good. Very easy to make, although just a tad bland. I did add 2 cloves of minced garlic and used fresh mushrooms. Next time will try adding something else for flavor. Needed 3 hours over low heat. Great over egg noodles!

This was great. I prepared the chicken and broth in the crockpot during the day and then assembled the rest in 10 minutes on the stove. Delicious!

The sauce made by this recipe is very good and makes the entire house smell wonderful.  However, for those who like flavorful chicken, it might be in the best interest to season the chicken with a little seasoning salt of some form.

This was not a favorite, tasted OK but not great.  I do something similar on the stove top, but I use cream of mushroom soup and lipton onion soup mix.  14 year old would not even taste it.  Will not make this again.

Incredible recipe! I followed others suggestions using onion soup mix to enhance the flavor. I also used a few dashes of white cooking wine,rather than Marsala. I couldn't believe how easy this was! My husband uncontrollably said "Mmmm" with EVERY bite he took!

This was definately easy.  The results was not great.  The chicken was bland, but there was a real heavy onion taste and smell.  We like alittle onion...that's why I only used about 1/4 onion.  Maybe I should have went with some others by using the liptons onion soup mix.  Don't think I'll be making this one again.

This was amazing. I did make a few changes based on what I had on hand. I probably doubled this recipe because of the size of my family I was preparing it for. Instead of the herbs soup, I used cream of chicken and seasoned the chicken with roasted chicken and herb seasoning. Instead of mushrooms, I used cream of mushroom since I didn't have any canned or fresh on hand. Also added one cream of celery. Yellow onion substituted for red. Cooking wine substituted for marsala wine. Added garlic powder, rosemary, onion powder, and black pepper to season. A few hours before serving, I added a frozen bag of carrots, cauliflower, broccoli, and a half bag frozen peas. Let it cook for almost 7 hours on a relatively low setting. Turned out delicious!! Definitely will make again!

I used boneless chicken thighs, omitted the wine and mushrooms, and just used regular cream of chicken soup. It turned out really good! I served it over rice.

This was very easy to put together, it was also very bland. I felt like no matter how much salt I put on it, it would have never been enough. My husband will definitely not be happy to eat this every night.

I’m not a fan of chicken in the slow cooker, so made this as a casserole in the oven instead. As written this is a bit bland so I definitely recommend adding extras to your own taste. I added oregano, extra mushrooms (fresh), used mushroom soup instead of chicken, and seasoned the chicken with paprika and pepper in my revised edition. Everyone loved my revised version (even my very picky 7yo) and I would rate that 4.5 stars, with a rating of 3.5 for the original recipe.

I enjoyed the recipe but made a few adjustments the second time.  Instead of using water, I used chicken broth and also added just 1/8 teaspoon of bouillon .

This is very good served over mashed potatoes.  I make this for 2 people so I use 2 thin chicken breasts, 1.4 cup marsala wine and fresh mushrooms.  I also add minced garlic, italian seasoning and a packet of Lipton onion soup mix.

I like slow cooker recipes where there is little prep involved.  While the prep for this dish was easy, my husband and I thought that it was bland (I skipped the wine because my son does not care for the taste in his food).  I may make it again, if I do I will add more mushrooms because we all like them and will definitely add some seasonings.  Maybe I will add the wine next time too.

Very tasty and easy!  I added a package of onion soup mix and some celery along with a small yellow onion, used two cans of mushrooms and about a quarter cup of sweet red wine (that's what I had on hand).  I was concerned that the onion soup mix would make it too salty, but it was just fine and very juicy.  The aroma while cooking was wonderful!  I cooked it on low for 3 hours, and that turned out to be too long, so next time I'll cut the time down.  As one reviewer suggested, I served it over green beans for a delicious low calorie dinner.   I'll definitely make this again.

I used 3 whole breasts, added 3 cloves of garlic, no onions but used onion soup as others stated and cooked on low for 5 hours then slightly shredded the chicken.  The chicken was extremely tender and flavorful, a bit too salty so next time I will used 1/2 envelope of onion soup or I will add some water/broth.  Second time around, used half the soup and was very good, serve over pasta.

Looking forward to making this again—and following the recipe more closely. I substituted cream of tomato. And somehow overlooked adding the dressing. It was still pretty delicious! (I definitely add dressing to my servings.) I can't wait to taste it with cream of mushroom!

I am not really a cook and am trying to use my new slow cooker as an easy way to get in more home-cooked meals. 
I followed the recipe, minus the wine, used fresh mushrooms instead of canned, and added a little black pepper (I was worried about it being bland). 
I thought it was really tasty, so did my boyfriend, and YES it lived up to its name, being SUPER easy. Next time I would probably add some more veggies.

This recipe was easy, but lacked flavor.  I needed to add tons of garlic salt to the dish to give it something. My kids wouldn't finish the entire helping because they thought it had a bland taste to it.  Needs extra spices to make it more tasty.

I couldn't find cream of chicken and herbs, so I used cream of chicken and mushroom.  I added a clove of garlic, a pinch of dried rosemary, marjoram, and thyme and salted and peppered the chicken.  I still didn't think this was flavorful enough, however, my husband liked it.

My daughter and I absolutely loved this dish (which I made with fresh mushrooms instead of canned), however my husband disliked it so much that he made himself a sandwich. I guess it's not for everyone. I'll have to  make it again on a night when doh won't be home for dinner. Super easy and tasty. I served it over egg noodles with a side of brocolli. Thanks for the submission.

This was an okay dish. I was surprised that it was rated so highly.  I followed the suggestions (soup mix) it was so salty that I had to add more wine (chardonnay, water and milk.  It was still quite salty.  I thought the chicken was bland too.  I would not make this again.

Super easy and tasty. I used cream of mushroom, white onions, fresh mushrooms and chardonnay because that's what I had on hand. I also added some diced scallions. I'll definitely make this one again, it's too easy not to.

I don't have a timer on my crock pot but I don on my oven so I cooked this in my oven at 250 for 4 hours.  Came out excellent.  I forgot the Marsala wine though so next time I will try to remember, but it was great even without it.  Very easy to make.

As is: pretty bland. After reading reviews I browned the chicken in garlic, cayanne, crushed red pepper and rosemary. In the crockpot I added I used 2 cans of soup: Cream of Celery & Cream of Chicken. 3/4 can of milk. 3 cloves diced garlic, parsley, 1/2 onion, rosemary & chicken. Cooked for 3 hours. Last 20 mins I added 2 cups of whole wheat pasta to the crock pot. This way it was a solid 4 for us.

This was okay. I had to sub chicken stock for the wine because I didn't have any. I also used bonless, skinless chicken thighs because that is what we like. It tasted okay, it just didn't look very good. I shredded the chicken & put noodles in it to make chicken & noodles. It was better that way.

Great taste and easy.  Would be good over rice, noodles or mashed potatoes.  I added a can of drained peas the last 30 minutes and turned it to high to be sure the chicken was cooked all the way through.  Probably wouldnt have to do that if the chicken strips were thin.

my family loved this.   I doubled the chicken and added a can of drained mushrooms along with a can of cream of onion soup and cream of chicken and mushroom soup.  I cooked in slow cooker on low for 8 hours.   Served over rice.

This is definitely worth making -- especially considering how easy it is!  I added garlic powder, some ground pepper, and used 1/3 cup sherry instead of the wine.  It was very good over rice.  The chicken was tender and good.

This was a hit with my family.  Very tasy.  I used third cup of Sherry instead of the Marsala wine.  Otherwise, I didn't change a thing and all loved it

Of course I had to go with everyones advice and use the french onion soup mix. I didnt add chopped onions and mushrooms and I served mine over rice. I thought the taste was great and the chicken was moist and flavorful.
