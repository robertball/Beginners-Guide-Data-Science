Great combination texturally with toasted crusty bread. Tasty spicy flavor that mesh together overnight. It is well worth your effort gathering these ingredients and take these several preparation steps and combine them with fresh herbs. It is a recipe you should save and make this a delightful beginning or side dish.

This is definitely worth all the steps and makes a large quantity which would be good for a party. I used roasted red peppers since I had a jar. My advice would be to make sure you cut the eggplant and zucchini very thin making it easier to stack on the toasted baguette. I will make this again but make a half recipe next time.

Great for leftover garden zucchini! Wonder if you could add onion for added flavor. But delicious just the same!

I love how recipes say it only takes "20 minutes" but they don't include all the chopping and prep work you do.  This took me, from start to finish, about an hour, although I did roast my own peppers.  While I like strongly flavored things, the salt and vinegar in this were a bit much for me.  I'll definitely make this again but reduce those ingredients somewhat.  It's a great dairy free appetizer or condiment. It made 2 pint jars for me.

It was to strong for me.   I would cut down on the garlic and vinegar. I I would not make it again.
