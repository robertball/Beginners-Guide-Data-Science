I must say, I liked this, but it is very sugary and buttery. You don't need any kind of sauce topping for this, as it makes a syrup that goes to the bottom of the pudding. I made the recipe just as stated (except for adding 1 t vanilla), and at 45 min, the pudding almost poured out when I pulled out the pan to take a look. I had to cook for 1 hour total, and it is still a very wet pudding. I don't think 3 c of bread cubes is enough for 2 c of milk-- I put almost 4 c of cubes, and it could have used at least another c of cubes. It's interesting they way she has you stir the brown sugar, butter and cinnamon together and then toss in the bread cubes. They don't really "coat." The brown sugar mixture is very thick, and most of the bread cubes become crumbs while you incorporate all the cubes in the mixture. Every other bread pudding recipe I have made has you mix the sugar in with the milk and eggs. However, the end result is yummy if you like your bread pudding very sweet and squishy. :)

I added another cup of bread cubes and about a teaspoon or more of vanilla.  It was perfect.  Brought my mom to tears, because it was like what her mother used to make for her:)

I made this today and it was good! I didnâ€™t measure anything but the butter. Just eyeballed everything else until it was well saturated. I also added raisins and craisins.      Like another reviewer I baked it for an hour.

I love this recipe. It is so simple to make. I decided to try something different this time. I added another cup of cubed bread and a tsp of vanilla. Divided the recipe in half before I added the milk and egg mixture. In one half I added raisins and the other half I added chocolate chips and poured them into one 13 x 9 baking dish with the raisin mixture on one side and the chip mixture on the other. Poured the liquid ingredients over both and backed at 350 degrees for 55 min. It was delicious. My husband is not crazy about bread pudding but loved this one.
