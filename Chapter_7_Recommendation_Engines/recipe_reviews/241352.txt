Where has this recipe been all my life? I would give this 10 stars if I could. The taste is rich and creamy and tastes like all the good things in life in a mug. I used coconut cream and heavy coconut cream instead of dairy versions. I used whipped coconut cream too. Top this with some cayenne pepper! This will make you hate those cold dreary days a bit less! Thank you Aurora for this heavenly cup of chocolate goodness!

Perfect. Added a tablespoon of flour for that Haitian touch.

Very awesome! Made one exactly as written (but using 1%-thats what we drink) it was super tasty and rich. 
The second mug I again used 1% with a teaspoon of honey instead of brown sugar. 
They were both great.

Rich rich rich. I melted my chocolate in a double boiler. Actually it was a glass bowl over a pan of boiling water. I warmed my milk in a pan with sugar & cinnamon on other burner. Then added it to melted chocolate gradually whisking it in.  I never added cream...I had it out but was so impressed with its thickness and richness  I never added any cream, I used fat boy milk alias whole milk! That probably made the difference! Numnum Nummy!
