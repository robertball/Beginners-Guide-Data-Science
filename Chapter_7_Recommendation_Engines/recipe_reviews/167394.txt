This was delicious served with chickpea curry, my only complaint is that it became runny very quickly, I think next time I will give the chopped kiwis a little squeeze with a clean towel to reduce the amount of juice they release into the yogurt.

This reminded me a lot of tzatziki, and makes a nice addition to spicy food however we found it to be a little too sweet. Perhaps from using over-ripe kiwis, the juice made the raita sweet and runny. If I do make this again, next time I would recommend using kiwis that haven't quite ripened yet.

This is a delicious, easy recipes that puts the finishing touch on your Indian meal.  The addition of kiwi is inspired.  I serve this with the chickpea curry recipe, and my husband thinks I spent hours in the kitchen.  Diner is prepped in 20 minutes.

A tragedy. I made it after reading the good reviews, but my dinner guests were appalled. The end result had a strong, unpleasant bitter taste. Possible reaction between the ingredients? It was so embarrassing!! I followed the recipe to a tee too.

I made this with mango instead because I didn't have kiwi. It is different & quite yummy. A fun twist on traditional raita.
