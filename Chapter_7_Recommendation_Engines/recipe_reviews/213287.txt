This was really better than I thought it was going to be. To keep the beans crisp, we heated them in the microwave and put them at the bottom of our bowls, then added the hot chicken & rice mixture on top and mixed it in. We also added some garlic and a little parsley. For cooking on a budget (and especially for small kids - we have two) this was a hit.

The flavor of this was good but it was not creamy.  I made it exactly as written.  I would make this again but would add extra milk or maybe a couple of tablespoons of sour cream.  I will definitely try it again.

Quick and easy dinner. Very mild flavour but my 2 small children ate it with out complaint :) Will make this again. I might experiment with other flavours and see what happens.

I tried this as a variation on a chicken and rice bake I used to make.  I added mushrooms and a dollop of sour cream.  After a few grumbles from the kids, I sprinkled season all on it too.  I substituted french cut green beans.  It's something I'll make again.  Easy and quick.

It is not a pretty dish, nor will it make anyone shout with glee.  But, as another reviewer said, the family ate it without complaint, which is a blessing when you are short on time and just need something on the table.  I exchanged frozen broccoli for the green beans as that is what I had on hand.  Also cooked brown rice in another pan and served this on top.  I wasn't crazy about it, but husband and boys ate it up.
