As a non-vegan I'm probably not so used to meals made entirely without animal products, but nonetheless I was very happy with these burgers - very filling, healthy, full of fibre. The only thing I'd do differently is use more salt, or a stock cube in the cooking water. Thanks for posting!

This mix turned out delicious. Ishould have read the other review first: the patties do not hold up at all. But I did not mind. Great filling for a pita or just warm up and serve with the sauce. Nice blend of djon tahini and lemon juice. Great flavor. No more salt needed IMO.

Save a step! Skip the breading and frying- and this is a delicious VEGAN "bean and rice" dish with a twist. Top with sauce and garnish with parsley.

This makes enough for a small vegetarian army! After cooking the lentils I put them into a sieve and drained all the water off them. I made up half of the recipe into about one inch thick by about 3 - 4 inch round patties which produced 12 patties. They held together just fine. With the other half of the recipe I made thinner patties. When the thin patties cooled I crumbled them up put the crumbles into an oiled iron skillet dusted them liberally with chili powder and "scrambled" them as if they were hamburger meat. (Before I made the thinner patties I tried just putting a gob of the mixture into an oiled iron skillet and scrambling it but it stuck and was a mess.). I then used them like sausage crumbles in some breakfast burritos. I though that the recipe had too much mustard. Next time I will start with about 1/3 cup.

Didn't notice it made 16 servings till after I started! Thought that was worth mentioning in case it saves someone else. The taste of the patties are good but because of how long it took to prep/cook it all (and because I had used all my tahini in the patties) I bailed on the sauce altogether and just squeezed some lemons on them in the end which was tasty. They do not stay together but at least they are really healthy!

My only complaint is that the patties did not hold together well. Next time I think I'll just spoon the filling directly into the pita.
