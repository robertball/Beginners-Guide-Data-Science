I really liked this recipe, as I served it on Easter Sunday.  The only caveat was that the blueberries leaked through the springform pan (likely because I had to use frozen), and the bottom of my oven was a bubbling, ashy mess when it was all said and done.  My suggestion, just in case, is to put a layer of aluminum foil under the springform pan to collect any juices that might leak out.

Otherwise, this was a wonderful recipe, and the whipped cream was a great addition!

This turned out kind of dry and crumbly for me, but it could have been my fault for using half whole wheat pastry flour (although it has never negatively affected a recipe before).  I also used lemon juice instead of lemon zest, so maybe that changed things.  Mine baked in 50 minutes also.  The top was good, but I wish I had used frozen instead of my freshly-picked berries, because it kind of just tasted like I had spread blueberry preserves all over it.  I think the "Plum Blueberry Upside Down Cake" on this site has a much better texture and presentation.

An awesome recipe!  Very moist and tasty! Little work and very little cleanup make this cake a winner in my book. Pay close attention to the "Bake 60-70 minutes or when toothpick comes out clean. My cake cooked in 50".

I made this dessert for company as I had blueberries and needed something quick. It was delicious. I made it again with frozen berries and fresh was definately better but frozen were fine.I served ours with fresh whipped cream. You have to be a real blueberry lover for this one, as I am. Thanks for sharing.

I found this recipe to be easy to prepare; however, I was not that satisfied with the result.  It didn't look as nice as I would have liked.  It did not need to bake 60-70 minutes - 55 minutes maximum.  Also I would definitely switch the almond extract to either lemon or vanilla in the future.

I've tried many recipes on this website, and this recipe is my first bad encounter.  The cake was positively the worst desert I have ever made.  One piece and the remainder quickly hit the bottom of the trash can.  If you want a winning blueberry cake, try the Blueberry Cream Cheese Poundcake instead.  It's fantastic!

Over all this was a nice tasting cake the blueberry and lemon really shine through. I did omit the almond extract and added lemon juice in its place. I also used half and half instead of milk. I did not have a problem with it being dry but it is dense and the crumb is very coarse. I'm thinking some additional butter or perhaps some oil would lighten it up a bit.  I did use frozen berries which were nice but next time I think I will use less flour and sugar as the topping was very very thick as others mentioned. I love the idea of this cake and I am going to try it again with some changes.

I thought this was fantastic! I made it exactly according to the recipe with FRESH blueberries and FRESHLY grated lemon zest. It turned out perfect. I'll admit I used rum extract instead of almond because I was out of it, but I think you could use vanilla, too and it would be fine. The cake was light and tasty...yummo! Mine was done in 50 minutes at 350, though so keep an eye on it so it doesn't burn.

I had some frozen berries I needed to use up and wanted to make a upsidedown cake which lead me here. Normally I do not find it worth the effort to make cake from scatch but this was truely amazing. I had to double this recipe as I found there did not look to be enough for a good size cake. I used self rising cake flour and OMG! The best, moistest cake I ecer made. I used sweetener ( both brown and white) and my husband and brother went back for seconds and thirds and didn't even know the difference. This was increduble served hot with PC Vanilla Bourbon ice cream. Blueberry season is upon us here in the north and I will be making many more of these cakes. I think I will even try this as individual muffins. Yumm Yumm

Made for Mother's Day. Everyone liked it but I found the topping was too thick, I think halve the flour next time, I used frozen blueberries and they had a good flavour. Just thought the topping would come down the sides a bit to fancy it up! Used spatula to try to do but was too thick. will try again though as it was easy.

This recipe was very flavourful, and I loved the addition of the lemon. I used a bunt pan instead of a springform. I also make a cream cheese mixture consisting of 1 250gram pkg light cream cheese, 1 egg, 2 tsp vanilla, and a little cinnamon. I poured this over the blueberrys, and then topped that with the batter. Unfortunaly, I overcookes mine a little, and it was a bit dry. That's no fault of the recipe though. Thanx for this one :)

I made no changes in this recipe, and it came out perfectly.  The blueberry lemon flavor combination was very nice.  The only issue (and it is minor), was that the almond extract flavor was pretty much undetectable. I might consider cutting back on the lemon zest in the cake to let more of the almond flavor come through.  Great cake!

Very nice cake! I even read the recipe wrong and kinda did my steps out of order and it was still perfect! lol! I did double the almond extract because I love almond and I added a bit more zest. Would recommend and will certainly make again...absolutely terrific!

I made this cake today for my dad and grandfather (father's day!!) and they both really enjoyed it! I made a few changes - vanilla extract and no almonds and I used a bundt cake pan. I also mushed the blueberrys a little to get them just a little runny and sugary... Mmmm perfect with a cold glass of milk!  The other reviews are right when they mention that this cake is done in 45-50 minutes.    I only wish that the cake wasn't so dense and low looking... maybe next time I will try more baking soda?  Any other suggestions?

This was a huge hit at my nephew's birthday party.  I'm not a huge fan of almond so I'd make it without next time. Also, the sugar mixed with the blueberries collapsed the top of the cake, so I'd probably cut the amount in half.  Definitely going to make it again!

Husband loved it!   I did not change a thing except for the addition of the nuts.  And I did not use a springform pan b/c I did not have one and I used frozen blueberries. Still turned out delicious, and makes a great presentation too.. I's make this again.

This cake was absolutely delicious! It turned out moist and froze well for when I had cravings for cake for breakfast. I highly recommend this if you are a blueberry and lemon lover. I am not a fan however, of almond extract but vanilla subsituted nicely. Great recipie!

Not  the most flavorful cake I’ve ever tasted. With the combination of blueberries and lemon rind, I expected something a little more tart. Not very fond of the consistency of the blueberry topping; and for some reason, the lemon flavor was very muted. Probably won’t make again.

I paid attention to previous reviewers and ended up with a very nice looking and tasty cake. I used fresh berries because I had some on hand, omitted the almond extract and used fresh lemon juice for a brighter flavor. And I used a 9 inch professional cake pan. I did not end up with a gooey burnt mess in my nice recently cleaned oven and the cake came out of the pan beautifully. The only thing I will change next time I will use fresh frozen berries as they keep their shape better.

Baked the blueberries in the cake so the final product wasn't so soggy.  Still tasted amazing!

Was very happy with this recipe.  I didn't have any lemon, so used lime zest.  And used vanilla extract instead of almond, cause of what I had in my pantry.  It turned out fantastic.  It cooked in 70 min and was moist and yummy.
