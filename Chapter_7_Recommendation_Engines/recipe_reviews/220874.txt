This recipe isn't a true roux, IMHO, because the half and half is added too late in the recipe for it to thicken, and next time I would leave it out.  This tasted really fresh and delicious and would be great over rice or couscous.

This was delicious. I did make a couple small changes. I mix my own Creole seasoning so I can adjust the heat to our taste and I didn't have zucchini on hand like I thought I did so I just chopped some fresh pea pods and added them for color. Loved the simplicity and it was bursting with flavor!

I had high expectations for this dish, but it just didn't quite do it for me. It was too spicy for me- and I;m not sure what the purpose of the half-and-half was. It just made it watery. Sorry, I won't be making this one again.

While my dad and Mr. LTH enjoyed this, I wasn't as a big of a fan.  It was OK, just nothing I'll make again.

I followed the recipe exactly and thought it was too spicy.  I would cut back on the Cajun spice if I was to make again.  It made for a nice light meal.

I REALLY enjoyed this meal, as did my family.  I used all red pepper as I am not a green pepper fan.  It was still flavorful and had the green zucchini to make it a beautifully colorful dish.  I thought it was especially well suited for Spring - fresh tasting and delicious!

Amazing dish.  I left out the shallots, so increased the amount of green onion.  I left this dish without rice, and it was amazing.  Many reviews say this is too spicy, but that seems easily changed by the amount of creole seasoning put in.  I also agree with another review, and put the half and half in earlier than the recipe says.

Soooo amazing!  Have loved this since I first discovered it...this time I swapped the zucchini for tofu, and the shrimp for lobster.  FANTASTIC!

Husband and I really liked it, and it was good over brown rice.  I wasn't sure about adding the cajun seasoning in the veggies so I left that out but, of course, I used it on the shrimp and it was fantastic.  It's a definate do-over and will also try adding black or red beans one day.

OMGosh! We can't believe we've never heard of this until now! We used fresh corn, cut off the cob, and we scraped the cobs for the corn milk. We also added frozen mussels, which I added to the veggie mixture along with about a half cup of chardonnay and and turned it to low, covered, while I sauteed the shrimp to let the mussels steam in the wine. We used Tony Chachere's Original Creole Seasoning. 
The only thing I would change is to eliminate the salt in the veggies. There was plenty in the Creole seasoning. Definitely a make-again!

Delicious and so fresh! Big hit with my family. Only alteration I made was to leave out shallot as I didnâ€™t have on hand. Used fresh corn. Next time will make with more shrimp. Yummy!!

This was quite good. I made it without zucchini and substituted andouille sausage for the shrimp (Mostly because we had it prepared that way at the Crab Trap in Destin, FL. A new favorite!

Husband really liked it and went for seconds. It was a little too spicy for me. We will make it again.
