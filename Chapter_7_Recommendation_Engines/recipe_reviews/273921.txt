This tastes nothing like BBQ sauce. It actually makes a great spaghetti sauce with the addition of 1/2 tsp dried basil and 1/4 tsp sage. I've been asked to make this as our 'go to' spaghetti sauce and I've agreed. So - not a waste of time to try out the recipe it just wasn't BBQ sauce.

This "Keto Barbecue Sauce" is exactly my taste (naturally sweet, smoky, not spicy) although I can see how with a little imagination it could very easily be adapted to suit other tastes. I used high-quality ingredients: KYKNOS Greek tomato paste (naturally sweet Mediterranean tomatoes - from Italian or Greek markets); BRAGGS apple cider vinegar; PRESIDENTS CHOICE smoked paprika; and WOODLAND liquid smoke. I almost left out the fish sauce; however, I found I needed it to balance the vinegar. I would not hesitate to make this BBQ sauce again. Thank you Bibi for sharing your recipe. UPDATE: It was my first time using Liquid Smoke. I did not realize that the smoky BBQ flavor would get stronger with time.  Yum! I would suggest making this BBQ sauce in advance if possible.

Did nothing as a BBQ sauce. Very bland. Will use whole tomatoes next time (tomato paste too sweet.)
