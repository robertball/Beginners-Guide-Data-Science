This was a pretty good treat, I had never prepared tiramisu before, but I found this dessert to be very similar to a trifle. The cream cheese added into the pudding made for a little extra richness, which was delicious. I wasn't really a fan of the strawberry dips whipped cream, it tasted a little too fake. I plan on preparing this again sometime in the future but i think i will substitute regular whipped cream instead and maybe add some other kinds of berries.
