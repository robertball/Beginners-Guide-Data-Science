This punch is fantastic.  I made it for a friend's bridal shower and it went over very well. However, I did not use the simple syrup step of the recipe...do not worry, it doesn't need it. Another side note, I used all generic brand ingredients as well. It was great.  Will propbably be one of my signature beverages.

Really tasty and beautiful punch. Loved by all the teenage girls I served it to. I used regular sugar.
