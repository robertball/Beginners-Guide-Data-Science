These are fantastic! I have been making them for five or six years straight and they are always a favourite. Different from your standard sugar cookie cut out. They really, really taste like eggnog. I usually use rum extract for the cookies and real rum (piced or dark) for the icing (thinning it with rum as required). The only thing I have found is that if you want enough of these cookies to feed your family and give away, a double recipe is ESSENTIAL!!!!

This cookie is delicious and I didn't even follow the directions right. I still made them but just made them as drop cookies and everyone loved them. I am going to make them again only follow directions. I love sugar cookies anyway. They truly taste like eggnog. Very good cookies.

Wonderful!!!  Dough was easy to work with, cookies held their shape very well.  Excellent flavor.  Frosted with Rum Flavored Frosting & sprinkled with a little nutmeg before frosting set.  Will definitely make again.

Lovely! I made the dough for these one evening and left them wrapped in cling film for over 2-3 days before I was ready to make them. Also I didn't have any rum extract so I used 5 tablespoons of white rum. It goes brilliantly without any icing and just a bit of nutmeg sprinkled over and even with Rum Flavoured Icing (from this site). I've still got more dough in my fridge to bake, I'm saving it up to bake closer to Christmas!  Also, I believe, those who complained about the cookies not being like eggnog were commenting on Millie's opinion...she felt they tasted like eggnog to her ... and perhaps some of you'll disagree but the cookies are NOT eggnog cookies they're RUM COOKIES and do complete justice to it! Thanks a million for sharing Millie, these will be  on my cookie platter this year and for all the years to come!! :D

These cookies are perfect if you are not looking for a super sweet cookie. They do have a hint of eggnog flavor. They are really good with the rum icing. Make sure to sprinkle some nutmeg on after the icing, does make more of an eggnog flavor

This recipe tastes nothing like eggnog.  The cookies were good, but certainly not eggnog good.  The butter needs to be somewhat softened before incorporating it into the ingredients, but your directions do not say that.

Friends ask me to make this cookie every year. Very good. Dough can be tough to work with if chilled too long, work it with your fingers until the butter melts a bit.

These were a big hit at the party I brought them to. They were gone by the end of the night. As a side note, I made them as drop cookies and they had to hang out in the oven about five minutes longer. Other than that, perfect.

These cookies melt in your mouth! I liked the flavor, but I have to agree with others that I really can't say it's eggnog. I didn't even frost them. Maybe I'll make a 2nd batch and use the rum frosting using real rum. Dough was easy to work with but I think 1/8" is too thin. Made mine about 1/4" and none burned!

I wouldn't go so far to say these taste "just like egg nog".  They are very good, and are very similar to my great-grandmother's egg nog cookie recipe.  I have only done one batch, and have not yet done the icing.  Will try the icing too.

This recipe was easy and fun to make.  Use lots of flour to roll out the dough, it's pretty soft and sticky.  They puffed just a tad during cooking and turned out soft and kind of cakey. I prefer a thin crispy cookie so they weren't my favorite.  I iced them with the rum flavored icing and they were pretty good.  My husband likes to dunk them in his milk in the morning.  Not my favorite cookie, but certainly not bad.  Might make these again next year.

These cookies are VERY good. They have a unique taste. I had to make another batch after my husband found them and ate almost all of them. These were his favorite out of 6 different kinds of cookies I made for Christmas. I frost some of them with the rum frosting, but ethier way they are good.

the dough was very sticky and was unable to roll out very well..the cookie cutters stuck. I eventually just spooned the dough out and added chocolate spinkles. My husband said the taste was fine.

I didn't think they cookies tasted like eggnog but I did like the rum flavoring.  It was very unique.  I made these for a bachelorette party.  They were a big hit with the rum icing.  These also go good at Christmas.  Several people asked me for the recipe.

I like the way these cookies turned out, they were very soft and buttery and not too sweet.  But I don't think they taste very much like eggnog, even though I sprinkled fresh nutmeg on them like some people suggested.    Next time I might try adding more rum extract to the recipe.

I made these yesterday, they were good, but only with the frosting.  To eat them by themselves, they don't have much flavor.  One reviewer said they found a frosting recipe on this site, I could not find one that was rum flavored.  My hubby and I came up with one on our own.  My suggestion next time would be to post the frosting recipe along with the recipe.  These were very good with the icing, the nutmeg sprinkled on top is a must!

I really liked this!  I had no almond extract though, so I doubled the rum extract.  dusted them with nutmeg instead of icing.  They do spread when they bake though, so it may help to chill the cutouts before baking again to - or leave lots of space for the spread.
