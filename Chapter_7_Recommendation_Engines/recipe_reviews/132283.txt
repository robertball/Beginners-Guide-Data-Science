one of the better Tourtieres ......but a homemade crust is much, much better because the ready made ones taste too sweet for this sort of pie.

This recipe made a very tasty pie, and easy to make, however, I found the resulting filling to be very loose.  I might add a bit more broth (rather than water) next time.  I made my own pastry in preference over store bought .

Have made these for Christmas Eve for 35 years, coached by two French-Canadian mothers in law.  I will caution that the frozen crusts taste too sweet for us.  I use 1-1/2 to 2 lbs of pork per nine inch pie, so this recipe would make two 9 in. pies.  Wouldn't be Christmas without these pies.
