I halved the recipe and used a metal cake pop tin.  They turned out really good! I baked them for 1 minute and then, and they are perfectly cooked. I definitely recommend this recipe!

A nice light, cakey cookie.  I don’t have Madeleine molds so I just used an ice cream scoop and made drop cookies.  Nice buttery flavor.  These would probably be good with fruit.
