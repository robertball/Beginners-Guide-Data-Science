I love this cake. The banana flavor is nice and it's not to sweet (I can't handle things that are too sweet). I took out the nuts and used Greek yogurt since it was all we had, and it turned out amazing. Crunchy on the outside and moist inside. I'm sure it will become a new brunch favorite around my house.

This cake is just wonderful!  It is moist and has a wonderful flavor.  My family absolutely loved it.  This cake was eaten quicker than any cake I have baked in a long time!  It is also inexpensive to make.  I will be making this cake many times!

It was very good. I was looking for a recipe using some strawberry yogurt that was in my fridge and it worked great in place of the plain. Sometimes substitutes mess up a recipe but not this time.  I will definitely use this recipe again.  Thanks for sharing.

Good cake! I added tahini and coconut to the batter. Your classic bundt/tube cake, very heavy batter, but somewhat lightened by the banana and the low amount of butter. I added the tahini to make sure the cake had enough fat to keep well.

Yum! Used white whole wheat flour because that is what I had on hand and had to leave out the nuts due to allergies so I subbed mini chocolate chips. Great cake, thanks for sharing!

Nice moist banana cake.  Has the taste and texture of banana bread.  I poured half the pan without nuts and then added pecans to the other half.  My family enjoyed this cake and it disappeared quickly.  Thanks Savoy Rouge for sharing your recipe.

Really yummy. Made a few substitutions/additions due to what I had on hand. I used half butter/half coconut oil, used only 3/4 c. of sugar (per comments from others), vanilla greek yogurt (it's what I had on hand), and in place of the nuts I added a mixture of dried cranberries & blueberries. 50 minutes in my oven would have been too long, so I shortened the bake time to 40 minutes (glad I checked at 40 minutes!!) Cake turned out perfect and everyone loved it. I'll definitely be making this one again!

Not bad but pretty blend ! Could hardly detect the bananas taste and the peacans are just a waiste. Have even tried with roasted coconut flakes instead... but there are still better recipes than this one, sorry.

Very good! Moist too,  but if I baked this for 50 mins in my oven, it would be burnt cake..  I used nonfat greek yogurt, one cup of white all purpose flour, and one cup of wheat flour, and about 3/4 cup of sugar.  My husband likes this too which is good because I'm always baking with bananas!  I love them and after they are too ripe to eat, what better way to use them up than making something delicious like this cake? It's a diet breaker. LOL.

This is super delicious served warm! I only had a 4 oz. container of honey vanilla Greek yogurt so I used that and added 4 oz. of low-fat sour cream and it was fabulous. Made the mistake of taking it out of the oven about a half hour before dinner and we couldn't stop eating it. Definitely a keeper and a sharer!

This is a nice, moist cake with a good banana flavor.  Not having any yogurt, I substituted 3/4 cup soured milk; and used chocolate chips in place of the pecans because hello, chocolate :-)  Four very ripe bananas were just right for this recipe.  The outer edges were almost crisp, giving a not-quite-crunchy texture against the soft insides.  I will be making this one again for sure.

Loved this cake.  As some other reviewers suggested, I used less sugar, about 3/4 cup.  I also used dark chocolate chips and peanut butter chips in place of the nuts.
I will definitely make this again as I cannot let an over ripe banana be thrown away!

Lovely cake.  It's a keeper.  I used 4 bananas, 1 cup of sugar and plain 2% Greek yogurt.

Perfect !  Texture, flavor, moistness.  Added more nuts and now topping with cream cheese frosting and a sprinkle of nuts for presentation.  

So glad to have found  a keeper after trying so many other recipes.

The only thing I changed was used vanilla yogurt instead of plain, it was amazing. So moist with just the right amount of sweetness and flavor, my family ate almost half of it in one setting!! I'll definitely use it again in the future, thank you for sharing! :)

I made this for a 4th of July picnic and it was easy to make & tasted great!  Since I'm trying to decrease the amount of sugar I use when baking, 3/4 cup of sugar was used and it was sweet enough due to very ripe bananas!  I'm baking this again tonight and taking it to work in the morning.  Thanks for the recipe!!

I just made this cake for my wife but made it gluten free. It has become our most favorite gf banana cake, and I have some good ones. It must be the yogurt.
