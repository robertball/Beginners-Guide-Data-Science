If I could give more stars, I would!!  Absolutely loved this recipe.  I wanted a really good drink mix and had heard about this one and decided to give it a try even though I do not drink coffee.  I am so glad I did because it is deelicious and Iwill be making several batches to give as Christmas gifts.  I checked several other mixes before trying this one and after reading the reviews and noticing that in every recipe people would change something because it was not sweet enough, did not have enough coffee taste, etc., that I decided to make this one because no one changed anything.  It is truly perfect as is.  Thank you so much CATWWALK16 for sharing this recipe.

I've been looking for a good quick powdered coffee recipe for my husband who drives truck for a living. He needs
a pick-me-up for those early start times and slow days.

THIS. IS. IT.

It was easy enough that my older son could help me make it for his Dad and just the right measurements of everything called for in the recipe. 
And he loves it. So do his co-workers. ;)

I will add that I bought most of the ingredients at Grocery Outlet, so don't
feel like you have to buy expensive products at the regular grocery store. 
Off brands or factory seconds work just
as well as the name brand labels!

Thank you for sharing this recipe. I'm 
incredibly grateful. 

EDITED 12/23/08: I made a double batch of this for my family. This filled eight grande latte cups with just a little left over. I filled them to the brim,
slapped the lids on and covered the drink hole with a sticker. Worked out perfectly.

Pretty yummy, although a little heavily spiced for me, so I cut down on the nutmeg by half and the cinnamon bit a tiny bit.  I also cut down the sugar by a half a cup (don't forget the hot chocolate has sugar too).  I used decaffinated instant coffee so I wouldn't have to worry about drinking it before bed, and I've tested a few different types of hot chocolate now, and Swiss Miss and Goodiva (about the same) are the best.  Cadbury was so/so.  Suprisingly the Goodiva wasn't much chocolatier.  I was looking for Ghiradelli but couldn't find just their drinking cocoa.  My boyfriend loved it too so I made him his own container.  Great for the upcoming winter months!

I replaced the coffee creamer with dry vanilla flavored creamer. This made it more sweet for my tastes. Loved it!

When I made this I thought it layered so nicely and looked very pretty that I could give it out as gifts, so that is what I'm going to do.  Once I drank it I thought it had plenty of flavour, very good, it will make good Christmas gifts.

This is really good, we took it camping with us and really enjoyed it.  I even drink it in the morning now on my way to work.

Okay, I must say that having been a barista for several years, I am a bit of a coffee snob.  As such- instant coffee is a big no-no.  Plus I like my coffee black...nothing at all in it, or I have no interest.  Still, I was thinking about making this to give as gifts with my baked goodies, so I wanted to try it for myself first.  And I am glad I did, because it is amazing!  So perfect after a long and chilly day.  I am totally hooked!  In anticipation of not really caring for it, I bought the cheapest instant coffee, hot chocolate mix and creamer I could find, and it is STILL incredible. Not only will I be putting this in my holiday gift baskets, I will be making it for myself and my daughter (a Starbucks fanatic) to enjoy throughout the winter.  Thanks for a terrific recipe CATWALK16 :)

This is really nice with just the right amount of flavour and sweetness.  Nothing needs to be changed, I tried a recipe similar to this but it had no sugar in it, this in my opinion is much better.  I really liked this and will use it from now on...thanks Catwalk!!

Where was this recipe when I was sending military packages? None of the ingredients are really perishable. Either way, I typed in 2 on the servings and had enough for one cup. The only thing I changed was using 3 half and half creamers with the scaled down recipe instead of non-dairy creamer. After I warmed it in the microwave I topped it with whipped cream and sprinkled cinnamon on top. It has a really nice flavor with just the right amount of sweetness and the cinnamon gave a nice warmth to the cocoa coffee mixture.

It's ok, but cut way back on the cinnamon and nutmeg.   Actually I wish I would have left them out.   These spices take over the taste of everything else.

It wasn't love at first sip for me.  It took me a bit.  But after adding a little extra creamer and finishing a full cup, I found myself wanting more.  I can definitely see keeping a tub of this in my desk at work (to replace my Internation Coffee mix) and bringing it camping.  Don't judge too quickly as I did.  Savor it a bit.  Then you'll see why gunline coffee has such a good rating.

I made this last night and plan to share as Christmas presents to family members.  It is sooooo easy.  I did the same thing with a Chai tea recipe of couple of years ago.  This is much easier and just as good if not better.  Thanks

We love this! My daughter is home for Christmas break from college and she wants to make a batch to take back to school with her to share with her friends. We will also be sending the chai mix back with her.  This is a wonderful gift for college students (since they usually don't have money to spend on fancy drinks), or would be great to send to a loved one who is deployed.

AMAZING!!  Just made this and had a cup, tastes just like the expensive star-schmucks! Am taking it to work tomorrow and can't wait to see how the folks like it. 7-1.25 oz envelopes was about 1.5cups of hot cocoa mix. Also I used the splenda/sugar mix: 3/4c. Perfecto!

We called this "Fireside Coffee" because of ease for use when camping.  I added 1/2 cup powdered sugar and decreased white sugar to 1 cup.  I also used 1/2 cup cinnamon flavored hot cocoa mix and 1 cup regular hot cocoa mix.  Add a little coffeemate hazlenut creamer or any flavor you prefer and its delicious!

I cut the recipe down to 10 servings as I only had a 1/4 cup of coffee whitener (I used Coffeemate's Double-Double Mate which is lightly sweetened). I used instant espresso as that is what I had on hand. For the spices I used 1/4 teaspoon of each as I like my hot beverages to be a little spicier. Tasted good, but I did have to use additional milk/cream to give it the taste and colour I like for my coffee (this may be because of the espresso). Would make a great gift once I tweak right, as I love the deep flavour of espresso but also like a lighter coloured coffee, if that makes sense.

This is EXCELLENT!!! Is so much like Starbuck's Cafe Mocha. I did substitue Splenda for the sugar but wondered if there was much taste difference so will use sugar the next time. Super mix!

MMmm, tasty. I made a sugar free version of this, using sugar free cocoa mix and Splenda. I also used fat free dry milk instead of the non-dairy creamer, as that's what I had. I find the coffee flavor to be quite strong, but that's probably because I'm not a huge coffee fan. The spicing, however is great. I also added a dash of cloves. Yum. A bit of portion math reveals that this recipe makes approximately 36 servings, not 80 (80 would be about 1 heaping tbsp per serving). Even so, my sugar free version comes out to 32 calories a serving! Mmm!

Are you seeking a smooth, tasty mocha/coffee mix? SEEK NO MORE. :)  I have made several batchs of Gunline Coffee for home use and for coworkers to enjoy on the job.  Everyone enjoys it tremendously!  Cinnamon or peppermint flavored creamers are a nice change of pace, but this yummy recipe can stand on its own "as is."  Thank you CATWALK and to your husband! :)

Made the mix as directed the first time, I liked it but, some cups were stronger then others, and in the end there seemed to be less coffee then when I first started drinking the mix.

To make the mix smoother in texture, and the taste more consistent from cup to cup, I blended the coffee granules in my coffee grinder until is was powder then added it.  Made the taste more consistent from first cup to last.

At first I wasn't sure because I like my coffee creamy and sweet and it didn't have that creamy colour but I was pleased with the flavour since I added a teeny bit extra creamer and sugar. It was really yummy and a 1/4 cup level scoop (was about 2 heaping tablespoons) was perfect for a mug. I'll get about 24 good sized mugfuls.  This will be great for overnight shifts. I would have loved to have this when I was in the field on exercises.

A great winter drink. I am not a coffee drinker but sometimes I need a little pick-me-up in the mornings and this is it! I did tweak it some by adding an extra 1/2 cup of each cocoa and creamer and replaced the regular sugar with 1 cup turbinado sugar. Thanks for the recipe. I will be packaging this as Christmas gifts this year.

It's still instant coffee but it's pretty darn good. I replaced the one and a half cups of white sugar with one cup of turbinado sugar and it turned out nice- not too sweet; better flavor. It's kind of nice knowing I have a canister of mix for the winter and any of those "out-the-door" moments.

I was looking for drink mixes to send in a care package to my deployed sister and this came highly recommended from the recipe exchange. I count resist trying some and I must agree it tastes A LOT like a Mocha Frappuccino. I only had half of the hot chocolate mix so I added some extra creamer and sugar. It was still good but I cant wait to make it when I can use all the chocolate mix.

Wow this is really good! I scaled it down to 1 serving. I don't like instant coffee or non-dairy creamer so I mixed all the other ingredients together and poured in 1 cup of fresh brewed coffee then topped it off with about 3 tbsp of half and half.

Thanks for a great new recipe for me. Better than my old "cocoa mix" recipe.
I put the instant coffee (decaf for us) in the food processor first-it incorporates better into the mix.  Then I added all the other ingredients to the food processor.  It was ready in less than 5 minutes.  My husband loved it so much, he now leaves a large container at his office, and I do not have to make him coffee in the am anymore! I put this mix into cute jars from the dollar store, added cute fabric bags for wrapping, put on a label with instuctions (I called it Mocha coffee mix) and gave it to all of my children's teachers as Christmas gifts!! I intend to try it again with flavored creamers. Thanks!

Good, but if I'm in the mood for a spicy hot drink, Chai Tea usually wins out.  I think I would like this better with less cinnamon and nutmeg- personal preference.

Love this recipe!  I made the "Fire Side Coffee" recipe on this site first, which is almost the same except it does not call for sugar.  I tasted it and it definitely needed sugar.  So I went ahead and added the 1 1/2 cups sugar this recipe calls for and it is fabulous!  Serve with a dollop of whipped cream and a sprinkle of nutmeg.  The mix would also make a great gift for the holidays.

For an instant coffee drink I give this 5 stars! I made a few changes and added hazelnut coffee creamer instead of regular and didn't add any sugar to the mix. For our house it's just perfect. We don't use much sugar in our coffee and with the sweetness of the creamer I substituted and the sugar in the hot chocolate this was perfect! The 1st cup I made I gave to my husband to taste and he wouldn't give it back to me! Great recipe! Thanks!

Very nice, I liked the hint of spice in it. I made a half batch and since my instant coffee was the kind with the bigger crystals, I buzzed the whole batch in the food processor for a second. Now it is a smooth mix and I can easily measure it out for a cup. Definitely a keeper.

I thought this would be a little more chocolate-y and a little creamier (I suppose I'm a bit of a dreamer), but I seem to find a reason to drink it everyday, so I think I like it-I add additional cream to it after I make it and that is the taste I'm looking for.  I have a cup everyday after work while I read the paper.  Good stuff- Thanks!!

This was really good.  I loved it as is, but adding flavoured creamers is nice as well.  I liked using the vanilla coffee mate as well as the plain.  I really like this!  Thanks for the great recipe and I really like the name as well...way to go Catwalk's Husband!! LOL

Absolutely outstanding!  Added a tad more cinnamon.  Mixed everything together in a food processor so it came out powdered, and everything is totally mixed together instead of layering.  Warning! This can be addicting; the taste is unlike anything else you have ever tasted.

This is pretty tasty stuff.. the only thing I would say is DONT use French Roast instant unless you want a hairy chest.  I made this for a coffee lover and used French roast and it was way strong.  Doubled (plus) everything else though and it was much more palatable.

I made this today exactly as written with one exception- I blended the mixture until the particle size was consistent. It is delicious. Thanks for sharing!

Delicious! Headed camping this weekend and found this recipe. I liked it better than my morning coffee. I am already addicted after 1 cup. I added a scoop a cocoa powder. Yummmmm. Can't wait for breakfast!

Very yummy!  I needed more caffiene so I added a 'shot' of espresso that they sell in individual packets at the grocery!  It worked.  I may use this recipe as Christmas Presents in a Jar!

This is fantastic!  I used Splenda in place of sugar, Swiss Miss no sugar added cocoa.  The instant coffee I got (Taster's Choice) was really coarse, so I put that, the spices, and the Splenda in the blender and gave it all a whirl so it would all be as fine as the cocoa.  Sipping a cup now, and it's really good.  Not too sweet, not too strong.  Will try again with other flavored creamers to see what that's like.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!  Update:  Just in case anyone is wondering...  about 11 packets of cocoa is 1 1/2 cups, since that's all I had to make this.

It was ok. And I agree with another reviewer on this. It is not a love-at-first-site recipe, but it might be a sweet addiction for you...

This was good. Im not a big coffee drinker, so this was perfect for me. The only change I made was that I used french vanilla creamer.

Very easy and a great gift. I've made this twice. The first time was good, but left a bitter taste (maybe because I used generic coffee). The second time I used Maxwell House and it came out great.

This was surprisingly good. It's a nice deviation from the strong, standard coffee I drink every morning.

I cut the recipe down because it made a lot. Next time I make a batch I will do half white sugar and half Splenda. 

After I make a cup, I still use a little bit of flavored, liquid creamer, but not much. I imagine if you added some whipped cream on top it would taste just like something you'd get at a coffeeshop.

This is a very good hot drink. It is very comforting, especially on a cold night in Michigan. After it was made, I added a drop of vanilla to my cup. It really seemed to bring the flavors together in a very nice way. I halved the recipe and cut back the spices by half. I also used splenda instead of sugar. Thank you for a quick, easy, and excellent recipe!!

This was tasty. Next time, if I was making a batch for myself, I'd probably cut down on the sweetener (I used Splenda), but that's a personal thing. My younger brother loved this as is. It's very comforting on a cold night.

The only thing I would do differently is use less sugar.  That's a personal thing.  I and my fiance just love to sit down to a cup of this stuff.  He went out and bought all the ingredients and had the mix made by the time I got home.

I love this coffee so much! I am not a chocolate fan so I decreased the hot chocolate by 1/2 cup and instead of regular sugar I used vanilla sugar. Thank you for the recipe!

my friend and I started making this about 25 years ago to put into the goodies baskets we made for the holidays.  We each had around 12 baskets we made for people so we'd get a mug that was appropriate for them (one friend loved to be out in her garden so I found a garden themed mug, had a friend that was a dog lover--dog mug for her etc.).  We make a couple of different kinds of cookies, some kind of quick bread, and sugar-spiced mixed nuts and some of the coffee mix in a little jar.   We'd save the boxes and cut them down and wrap the box with some kind of holiday paper so it would look nice (save a little money on buying a large container to put everything in) and after all the goodies were placed into the box, we'd just wrap with saran wrap and put a ribbon and bow on.  Always well received!

All I can say is WOW! So delicious. I've been having trouble with coffee bothering my stomach lately so I decided to try this because there are other things mixed in with it. My daughter and I are both totally addicted now. We've already finished the first batch and I am in the process of making a second batch. This is now my preference over coffee and the recipe is perfect as is!

This is also known as Poor Man's Mocha...without the spices.  Love the addition of spices though.  Make it with decaf instant for something you can share with your kids.

It's really good! I used all generic ingredients, and french vanilla coffee creamer. Next time I'll add a little more cinnamon since I couldn't really taste it. BTW: This recipe actually makes 40 2-Tbsp sized servings, not 80. I usually scoop out 1/4 of a cup and fill my 16 oz coffee mug. Much better than store-bought flavored coffees! Very rich-tasting.

Great recipe!!  The cinamon & nutmeg give a great flavor without being overpowering.  I left the sugar out to allow for individual tastes in adding sugar, spenda, etc.

I've made this for about 5 years now and can't believe I never reviewed it.  It's a great keeper and great for some small gifts for co-workers, etc.  So glad I found this years ago.

Loved it, wanted something other than regular coffee, but cheaper and this is definitely it. The cinnamon and the nutmeg make it taste like the coffee you get at coffee shops!

This has become my morning staple! My husband always has fresh coffee in the morning, so I left out the instant for myself and bought Rolo hot chocolate for fun! With fresh coffee I find I only need 1 heaping tsp with a splash of milk, but this is REALLY great to wake up too :)

I didn't know how this would turn out with the spices but it is really delicious. I used powdered skimmed milk instead of the non dairy coffee creamer and good quality chocolate (at least 32% cocoa). For a coffee this is great, however I am more of a chocolate drinker so I tried adding more chocolate and less coffee and it turned out even better for my taste. I tried this recipe with regular quality chocolate mix (20% cocoa) as well and the taste is very different, more bland. so I recommend the use of good chocolate because it boosts all the other flavors.

I'm not much of a coffee guy in the fact that I never drink coffee.  But being the food connoisseur that I am, I decided to give this a shot and to tell you the truth I wont leave for work without a cup of this.

I used french vanilla creamer because I am trying to get rid of it. After I bought it, my husband decided he is not a huge fan of it anymore. I imagine this is probably better with regular flavor creamer. More coffee flavor would come through. I used splenda and sugar free instant hot chocolate. I started with 1/2 the cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg and I am glad I did or it would have been too much.

for those times when i can't decide if i want a coffee or a hot chocolate, now i don't have to decide. This is the best of both worlds and the cinnamon and nutmeg make it different from a regular mocha drink. Definately could be addictive! I can't wait to take it camping. This recipe is perfect as written. I wouldn't change a thing.

I've tried this with sugar and with Splenda.  Like 'em both.  Also, have made a regular and a de-caf batch as well.  I drink this now, instead of coffee, all the time.  I've always been a mocha fan, but the addition of the cinnamon and nutmeg makes for a unique drink.  Brew a batch today!

This is different.  I dont care for instant coffee - at all but I am able to drink this drink.  I scaled it down to 10 servings to start with.  I think I need more creamer though, but all in all is good.  My hubby (who drinks his coffee black) thought it was a nice different drink.

This was so yummy and exactly what I was looking for in a coffee that was different than the boring old one.  I made it with decaf coffee took it camping and the kids even loved it and chose to have it instead of hot chocolate!  Perfect with a dollop of whipped cream, mmmmmmm.

It wasn't exactly what I thought it would be, but it was ok.  It will do nicely for a quick pick-me-up before heading into work.  I dribbled a tiny amount of vanilla in it which I thought made it better.  Thanks for the coffee-on-the-go.

Reading all the five-star reviews, I wanted to make this recipe. It tastes really good, part coffee-part hot chocolate. I ended up mixing up a batch and giving it to my stepkids in mason jars. I also made myself a half recipe and used 1/2 cup sugar (instead of 3/4 cup for a half recipe).

No changes this time but I think 2 Heaped table spoons is a bit much. Next time I will use only one.
And perhaps half the sugar. I'm a savoury, rather than a sweet person.I topped it with whipped cream.

I scaled the recipe to 1 serving. I liked it a lot but I did find the spices to be a bit strong. That could have been because I made only 1 serving. Nonetheless it was still very good.

I like it, apart from the fact that I found that the instant coffee flavour came through a bit too much, I didn't realise how much I've lost the taste for instant and much prefer ground! So I sat pondering how I could enjoy this without instant coffee, it really didn't take much thought (luckily for me, lol) I don't dislike it so I'll use the batch I made. The next batch, I'll omit the instant coffee and, instead of hot water, I'll use freshly made ground coffee. I'm sincerely hoping It'll make it (for me at least) perfect! I also thought about putting marshmallows or that fluffy stuff in the jar, on top. Thank you very much for the recipe. Update. I've made this three times now, the second time I did use freshly made coffee, it was nicer than the coffee granules. I found that the granules were concentrated at the top of the container so I got more of the coffee flavour in the earlier cups, there was also a bit too much sugar for my taste, so I reduced that by 3/4 of a cup. This time I decided on espresso coffee powder, and I added 1/4 of a cup of cocoa powder, this has turned out to be my favourite version but, without the original recipe I'd have never even THOUGHT about this! 2nd Update: This is my fifth time of making it, I've been tweaking it little by little and I've got it to my taste now. I'm really glad I followed the recipe, I always do the first time, I don't understand why anyone would tweak it without trying the original first. I used a whole 100g jar of espresso

I was looking for a recipe that used A LOT of instant coffee as my mother, before she died, had stocked up on instant coffee.  I now have many jars of it.  I don't like instant coffee for my daily coffee.  Most of the recipes I've found that use instant coffee only call for a few teaspoons or tablespoons.  This is very easy to make (5 stars for that) and I happened to have all the ingredients.  I've been having a mug of this daily and top it with marshmallows.  I  am giving it 4 stars overall because, while good, I'm not "wowed" by the taste.  I don't find the spices overwhelming.  Whether or not someone likes the spices in any dish is  personal taste.  For those that didn't like the spices in this, they could either cut back, eliminate all together or substitute something else they like better.  I plan to try other similar recipes  just to see if I can find one that knocks my socks off but may ultimately come back to this as my "go to" recipe.

Love the recipe, the only change I made was using french vanilla creamer instead of plain creamer. I will make this again and give it as Christmas gifts to friends. 4-3-18  I make this recipe regularly, I love it and my adult son drinks it every day. I use vanilla, hazelnut or whole milk powder for the creamer, depends on what I have or my mood, all taste great.

I was a little liberal with the nutmeg (I accidentally dumped a bunch in) and it was insanely overpowering. That was my fault though. Still drank it, so I can only imagine how great it was if I didn't mess it up. Took it hunting with me in a Ziploc so I could heat it in my canteen cup. A great pick me up after slogging through the muck for hours.

Hey....This is great stuff. If you are a true coffee aficionado then this is not for you. If a couple of the ingredients like cinnamon or nutmeg grate against your palate, then thus will not cut either. I made just about as directed and it is great without changes...except.... I am a insulin dependent diabetic that likes his coffee and flavored from time to time...this is spectacular stuff.

I love this coffee! This is the second Fall I've been making this mix and I can't say enough about how warm and comforting it is. The spice really comes through and you can actually taste the coffee flavor. The added sugar does not make it too sweet. My only substitution is dry milk for the non-dairy creamer because I don't drink the "fake" stuff. Included this mix with a few of my holiday cookie baskets last year and will probably do the same this year. But I always make plenty for me too!

I love this! I made this with slightly less sugar (1 1/4 cups made it sweet enough) and slightly less cinnamon and nutmeg to be conservative. Great recipe!

Good mix, I just couldn't seem to get the combination right.
