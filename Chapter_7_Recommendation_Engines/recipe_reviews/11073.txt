I toasted the pecans first. First time to try my new shortbread pan. These came out so beautifully. They have a wonderful flavor with a melt in your mouth texture. Don't be afraid of the bourbon. It lends a delicious, but subtle flavor. Thanks Cyndi.

(Made it exactly as on the recipe, but used gluten-free flour.)
Melted in our mouths, yummy!  Brought it to work the next day and it barely lasted 5 minutes, haha.  Husband couldn't stop dunking it in his coffee this morning and almost ate half.

Oh, and I used 9" springform pan (the closest I had to 8" round) and the cook time of 35mins still rang true.

We enjoyed these very much.  We really couldn't actually taste the bourbon - it just leant the shortbread a different, subtle taste.  In fact, my husband asked me to increase the bourbon just slightly so that there is just the hint of bourbon taste.  I am thinking I will add another tsp, and just keep tinkering to get this to our liking (not that it isn't good as is - thus, the 5 stars!).  Using different liquors would provide almost endless possibilities.  Thanks -

This had a very delicate crumb.  I couldn't taste the bourbon.  I like the concept but may try  Frangelico or Amaretto next time.

Great flavor, even without the bourbon! I didn't have bourbon and my husband thought scotch would be too different, so I substituted 1T water for the bourbon. Can't wait to also try bourbon!

Iâ€™ve made these several times. I double the pecans and use brown sugar instead of powdered sugar. Great flavor. Come out of the pan beautifully. You can use bourbon or vanilla. Delicious!
