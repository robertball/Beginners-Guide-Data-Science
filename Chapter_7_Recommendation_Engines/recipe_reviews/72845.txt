I didn't change the ingredients, but after browning the loaves I put them in a crock pot, poured the soup mixture over everythnig and cooked on low for 3 hours.  I served everything over cooked rice. This is a great comfort food dish even during the hot afternoons when you don't want to sweat over an oven or stove.

I would have given it 5 stars, but I changed a couple things.  I added a teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce as suggested by others and used a small jar of Marinara Sauce instead of the Tomato Soup.  It made the meatloaf richer and spicier.  I also browned the meat on top of the stove, then put it in the oven for 45 minutes uncovered.  It was delicious with mashed potatoes and green beans.  Will make it again soon.  

Thanks for the recipe.

I found this recipe very good.  I changed it a little and instead of sing condensed tomato soup, I substituted condensed cream of mushroom soup and it came out delicious.

My meatloaf loving husband gives this 5 stars.  I thought it was toooo salty but he's the expert so I'll go with his evaluation.  I used Italian bread crumbs and omitted the cheese.  It was so easy and no need to heat up the kitchen by baking it in the oven.  Left overs great in sandwiches too!

We loved this easy meatloaf!  I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs and a can of pizza sauce instead of the soup.  There's only two of us, so we have the second loaf for leftovers. Thanks for the recipe!

Meat was just delicious, juicy & tender but I didn't care for the sauce too much of an intense tomato soup flavour.  Will make it again but alter the sauce with maybe a little extra water and some Worcestershire sauce

My husband I weren't fans of this, but my three year old thought it was delicious.  I used the pizza sauce idea and Italian breadcrumbs, as tomato soup totally grosses me out, and I thought the meat just had no flavor.  It's always fun to try a new recipe, but again I was told to stick to my original meatloaf recipe.  Oh well!

Made this tonight for my husband and two kids. Everyone quite enjoyed it! It got a little burned on the bottom so I'll have to watch that next time. I used tomato sauce instead of soup. I'd like it to have a little more bbq flavour - might use bbq sauce instead of tomato sauce next time...

I tried this tonight w/ a few alterations, and it was GREAT!  I used spaghetti sauce instead of tomato soup and added 1 tsp. of Worcestershire.  I shaped the meat mixture into patties, rather than loaves, and fried them for about 10 min. on each side.  It was also quicker as I didn't have to wait for loaves to cook through.  I served it with brown gravy rather than sauce and cheese.  I'm not a big fan of meat in general, and my husband doesn't really like meat loaf, but we both liked this and had seconds!

I love the cooking method, but this is some of the most bland meatloaf I have ever tasted.   It was more like an oversized hamburger patty.  Next time I'll punch it up with honey, diced jalepeno, and dark mustard.

PLEASE condensed tomato soup has a completely different flavor than pizza sauce, tomato sauce or any other sauce containing tomato.

This meatloaf was super easy!  I didn't have everything on hand, so i had to use tomato sauce rather than the condensed soup (which tasted great).  I always add garlic to my red meats.  Also, i was using 93/7 ground beef, so i added two teaspoons of bacon grease to keep the loaves from sticking because there was no grease cooking out.  I added some of the sauce mixture to the loaves while they were simmering.  This is a beautiful dish and equally as tasty!

very good and very easy.  almost all 7 of my kids liked it.  I added worchestershire and a bit of hot sauce. I also made it into 8 little loaves/patties so each kid got his/her own.  served with Ketchup.

The overall flavor was good. One change: I used "No Salt" with low sodium. As I mixed 73% lean ground beef with the ingredients I saw a problem; it was not firm enough to hold together. When browning, the loaves crumbled as I turned them over in the skillet. There was not enough sauce in the pan to stir it so meat simmered in it. Next time I will follow Megan's suggestion and make smaller portions rather than two loaves. For greater quantity of sauce, I'll add 1/4 cup of water. If I desire a creamier sauce, I'll use milk instead of water. Thanks, T.J., for sharing your recipe.

This was absolutely delicious!! Alterations: I used 2lbs ground beef and made 4 'loaves'. Therefore I increased the amount of bread crumbs to taste/texture. Also, after reading many reviews I was really apprehensive about using the tomato soup seeing as I HATE tomato soup. BINGO - it was delicious! I added some Worcestershire sauce to kick up the flavor a bit, and a little bit of Italian seasoning just in case I regretted not using Marinara sauce. Also, I used milk instead of water and that seemed to be an EXCELLENT call! Pair this with some mashed potatoes and yes...you will love it!!

This was good, but it needed a little something as it was a bit plain. It was easy to make on the stove top, but I did have to increase the time it took to cook and excluded the sauce for this as not everyone likes mustard.

The first time I made this it burned so badly on the bottom when I followed the directions.  Last night I made some slight changes---Put about a tablespoon of oil in bottom of the pan before adding meat.  About a minute or two after adding the meat and searing the bottom I turned the heat down to med low.  Worked great!  Even my 1 year old couldn't get enough.

This was not bad at all. I don't eat a
lot of red meat so I substituted it with ground turkey and the only other change I made was to use spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce (I think it gives it a better taste). I had a bit of  trouble keeping it together but it still came out tasting good. My family still enjoyed it. Thanks.

This was "so-so". I read a lot of reviews, and being afraid of it being bland, I used pizza sauce instead of tomato soup. Perhaps I'd like it better with tomato soup - not sure. Anyway, this was not our favorite, and don't think I'll be making again. Thanks anyway!

This is the easiest meatloaf recipe ever.  My husband and son, who are big meat & potato eaters thinks it's the best.  The only thing I do different is I use Italian flavored tomato sauce and let out the mustard.

I made this last night for dinner and it was  VERYgood & so easy to make. It is not often that I make a meal that both of my two kids and my husband thinks is great!  The only thing that I changed was that I only had provolone cheese so I used that instead of mozzerella. My husband suggested that next time we add some green peppers. We will definatley make this again.

This recipe turned out pretty good.  A definite keeper.  The only problem I had was the wrong choice of ground beef.  The meat began to stick, probably because I did not have too much fat.  I think I'll use meat that is not as lean next time.

This was fantastic.  I changed it just a bit.  I used 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 ground turkey and I added a garlic dill seasoning.  I took the advice of another, since I do not care for tomato soup in recipes, and used cream of mushroom.  I added some beef boullion granules to the soup and water mixture.  I topped with a cheddar and mozzerella mixture.  I did not use the yellow mustard.  I made 3 patties tonight and froze 3 for later.  I can't wait to make this again.  My family loved it, that includes a 12 year old, a 10 year old and a 7 year old.  I served with a fresh green salad.

Great tasting meatloaf! I used extra lean ground beef, so I had to add a little water to the skillet while it cooked for the 25 minutes. It definitely was a very moist meatloaf this way :) I used tomato soup, but next time might try spaghetti or pizza sauce. I did use an Italian blend of shredded cheese on top, and Italian flavored breadcrumbs in the loaf. My boys really ate this up! Thanks, TJ!

Quick and very easy.  I did add about 1/4 cup of chopped peppers (green, red and yellow).  I didn't feel the tomato soup overpowered the taste.  And it made great sandwiches the next day.  Thanks for a really good recipe, TJ.

Nice recipe, thanks TJ.. :)
The kids and I enjoyed this dish..
I did increase the ingredients so had to cook it a bit longer to get it fully cooked.. I may use the idea of finishing it off in the oven next time too.. 
I changed the bread crumbs to Italien seasoned, and my onion was.. well let's just say, I had to resort to dried (which worked out well there was enough juices in the dish to make the onions taste ok..) .. 
Next time I may doctor it up a bit more.. maybe some garlic and basil or oregano..more like a big meatballs I guess.. 
Anyway, I will make this recipe again.. :)

You need to be careful not to have the meat burn on the outside while simmering. Adding just a touch of tomato soup for it to simmer in is just the thing.

This a really great recipe! My whole family likes it, and I think that adding the cheese on top is original and very tasty. The only "negative" point would be that there isn't enough sauce left at then end. But next time I'll do this, I'll just double if not triple the amount of tomato soup. I also didn't put as much salt as the recipe called for, I only put half of it, and the recipe was still pretty delicious. Thanks for sharing this recipe with us! ;D

This was simple and tasty.  I did make some changes, for what I had on hand.  I used ground turkey instead of beef and oatmeal instead of bread crumbs.  Instead of canned tomato soup, I used a partial box of organic tomato soup (not condensed).  I used a good tablespoon of spicy mustard.  I also made 4 loaves instead of 2, and used sliced muenster instad of shredded mozz.  Thumbs up from the family, and DH doesn't like turkey burger - was a good disguise.  Will make again!

Great flavour and very easy to make....i didnt care much for steaming the meatloaf though...it made it really moist but somewhat soggy. i think that it would stay really moist and turn out great if i bake it instead. i loved the sauce!

Excellent!  My sister likes this better than regular meatloaf.  I did change the cooking times to speed things up a bit.  First, I divided the meat into portion sizes so they would cook faster.  Instead of browning on both sides first, I just threw the loaves on medium and left them covered for ten minutes.  Then I poured the sauce over top, flipped the loaves and sprinkled the  cheese on.  After another ten minutes of cooking uncovered, they were ready.

This is a great recipe!  I didn't have any tomato soup on hand, so I found a recipe for tomato basil soup and made the meatloaf with that.  We served the meatloaf over mashed potatoes... YUM!

This recipe saved me when I still didnt have an oven. Even though I do my meatloaf in an oven now, I pretty much still use the same recipe. Thanks.

I messed a little bit and added the whole can of tomato soup into the meat mixture.  Because of that it was hard to keep the meat into loaves while I was cooking them in the skillet.  But the taste was still really good.  The only thing I will do differently next time will be to double the sauce.  Since I had already used the tomato soup, I substituted ketchup.  The sauce was very good!  I will be making this again.  It was nice to have meatloaf but not have to wait an hour to have it.

I generally DO NOT like meatloaf....but...this was excellent!  I tweeked the liquid ingredients a little by using spaghetti sauce in place of tomato soup and added brown mustard instead of yellow.  It was scrumptous!

This recipe had some great innovative ideas but the final product was not what I was hoping for in a meatloaf.  Loved cooking it in the pan vs. oven, but as one reviewer stated, the recipe needed more liquid in the sauce for pan simmering.  I ended up adding water and still had very thick sauce.  The tomato soup was just too strong a flavor and the meatloaf had no flavor of its own.  Very bland.  This might be a good starter recipe, but not a great one on its own.

This was really moist and it really did have some flavor where the meat browned from the skillet. Overall it tended to crumble though and I tried making patties instead of loaves. I would doctor up the sauce part though and maybe add some worcestershire or a little Italian seasoning. This is a good base to start with and just needs a little tinkering with. The sauce was a little too tomato soup tasting still. Otherwise it's worth a try.

I had trouble with this recipe.  I always use the leanest ground beef and in this recipe I used home grown longhorn beef which has basically no fat at all.  I could tell early on the loaves were not going to stay together and had to transfer them to a dish, pour the sauce on and bake them.  I am surprised a didn't find the suggestion in the reviews not to use lean beef.  Probably won't make this one again.

Well, not super impressed with this recipe. My husband didn't like the tomato soup idea, so we used Emerils marinara sauce... All in all it was okay, but it was more like a couple of giant meatballs. If i made it again, it would be with pasta!!!

I wasn't too happy with how this came out.  The meatloaf fell apart - was close to burnt (tried adding soup - it burned the soup)... The final product tasted good, but it was too much of a hassle.

I cooked this recipe for the first time.  The meatloaf fell apart in the pan but it did taste good.  The bottom got burnt even though I had it on low flame.  Next time, I am cooking it in the oven in a baking dish but following basic recipe.  I must say, my son did like it.

I tried this recipe and like it very much. I added only some garlic powder.  Because I had trouble getting my thermometer to read done. I finished the cooking in the microwave. I will make it again but, like another person who made it, will finish cooking in the oven.

I gave it a four because I changed from bread crumbs to garlic herb croutons and instead of tomato soup used baroque sauce. My daughter thought it was fabulous and she hates meatloaf.

Good base but can be tweaked for anybodies liking. I changed it a bit. I used ground turkey and added seasoned salt, garlic, worcestershire sauce and steak sauce to the meat mixture. Because it was ground turkey there was no fat so after the browning I put the remaining tomato soup, water and mustard in. It came out soft, juicy & delicious!!!!
