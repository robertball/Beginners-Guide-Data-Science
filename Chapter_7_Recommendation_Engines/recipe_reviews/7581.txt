I made this cake yesterday for my in-laws' 35th anniversary and it went over very well!  One guest thought it was the best cake she's ever had.  I made the cake with 2 round layers and it served 16.  I used the White Cake Frosting I recipe to frost, and for the filling between the two layers, I mixed 2/3c raspberry preserves with 2t Grand Marnier.  Great cake - thanks!

This cake was a disappointment.  It did cook evenly without much of a crest. However, It sunk while cooling, it was dry and had a bland but over sweet taste.  Texture was spongy and did not hold together well after removed from the pan.  It was impossible to stack the halves without breaking apart.

I made this cake and we LOVED it. It did fall apart thought. It was AMAZING. The second  time I made it for my parents anniversary it was perfect. It had a little crunch on the edge but that made it even better my mom said that was her favorite part!
