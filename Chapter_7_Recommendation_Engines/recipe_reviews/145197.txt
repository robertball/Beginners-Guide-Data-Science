This was very good.  It was tasty the same day I fixed it, but the flavor really improved after it sat for 24 hours.

Used fat free cream cheese to lighten up the dish, also added dried chopped cherries. Used fresh herbs and a good quality blue cheese. Served with Trader Joe's mini toasts. Excellent!

This was good. I made it into a cheese ball by rolling it up and coating it (rolling the ball around in) with chopped walnuts. I'd make it again.

This was good, but everyone was surprised when I said there were walnuts in the spread. Next time, I will add more walnuts and possibly toast them beforehand for more flavor.

My sister and I have made this twice for gatherings and it goes well with crackers and veggies, too. No changes were made.

I love this recipe. I add chopped dried cherries as well. Its a big hit at holiday parties as an alternative to the normal cheese ball. I also really enjoy searving this with black pepper, Olive oil flavored triskets!

I love blue cheese, but many people don't.  The blue cheese taste was perfect, just a hint and not overpowering.  Easy to make.  I also made it into a ball and would recommend a simple garnish for added color (if you really want to impress your guests).  I'm making it again this weekend!

This is great to put in jalapeno halves. Omit the walnuts and put chopped almonds (or walnuts) on top for an outstanding appetizer. I also add a splash or Worcestire.

I made a double batch and took it to work.  It was a huge hit.  A new favorite.

Took it as written to a tennis match & to an early Easter dinner for extended family this week as a dipper app.  I don't choose blue chz dressing on my salads, but I couldn't stop eating this and neither could anyone else.  Lots of compliments and it was such an unsuspecting change from Ranch or Onion. Used plain old Club crackers. Will def make it again.  Thank you for sharing!

This is very tasty for those of us who like blue cheese.  Once the cream cheese was softened, I added a couple tablespoons of blue cheese dressing to make it easier to stir in the herbs and make it easier to spread on crackers. Delicious.

Excellent spread! I looked at the reviews and added 1/4 cup dried cranberries for a nice tart, salty, and sweet blend. The parsely gives it a fresh taste. I can't wait to serve this tomorrow.

Easy and very good! I followed the recipe exactly and used fresh herbs. Next time I am going to make it into a cheese ball and serve it cold instead of at room temperature.

So, so easy! Made for a party and it was gobbled up. I also used fat free cream cheese and subbed feta because we ALWAYS have feta in the house. I know I'd love this with bleu as well. Definitely my "go to" dip as I always have these ingredients on hand. Well done, roxandmike

Loved it.  My book club friends raved.  You can also experiment with different herbs and cheeses.. like feta, or goat, with rosemary, or basil.. the possibilities are endless.

Yum!  This dip is delicious!  I don't have a food processor so I just mixed it by hand and it turned out just fine.  I added some salt & pepper, and a bit of Frank's Red Hot Sauce for a kick.  After reading some other reviews I added a few more walnuts, too. I'll definitely be making this again!

I made lean hamburgers, topped them with hotsauce then piled on this spread.  Fantastic.

As a way to make expensive blue cheese go further, this is good, but honestly the blue cheese by itself is tastier.
