definitely something different for us.. bf liked it more than i did.. i thought it was just okay.. i think i'm used to more of a plain yellow mustard flavor.. i did make a few changes that i don't think are too significant.. used all greek yogurt, no mayo.. spicy brown mustard for the dijon.. jalapeno for the anaheim chile (seeded and deveined).. crystal hot sauce for the buffalo wing sauce.. garlic powder (half the amount) for the garlic salt.. and kept the rest the same.. bf said he could understand why i just thought it was okay and said maybe it needed a stronger taste.. maybe more mustard and hot sauce.. either way ty for something different
