We made this for my mother-in-law's birthday last year and it was pretty good.  However, it was 10 times better the next day!  It just wasn't nearly as good fresh out of the oven for some reason.  But I was very pleased.  I believe we also used peanuts instead of the other nuts.
Very, very good recipe!

So good! I used the chewy caramel recipe from this site as the filling instead of running to the store and buying caramels and unwrapping them. A dollop of vanilla ice cream on top - decadent!

This was a very good cake.  I modified by using regular chocolate cake.  I also didn't add walnuts.  But I would make this again, possibly making a snickers cake by using peanuts.
The Caramel filling was VERY good, nice and buttery.  Although it would be easier to use caramel topping, I feel like the people who did that missed out.

It might be messy, it might not be too pretty, but this cake is soooo delicious. I used a favorite chocolate cake recipe instead of a cake mix. I also left out the walnuts- there are no walnuts in Snickers. The best part is the caramel sauce- it is so buttery and yummy!

I MADE THIS CAKE FOR VALENTINE'S DAY.  PLACE IN MICROWAVE FOR 10-15 SECONDS BEFORE EATING TO MELT CHOCOLATE CHIPS. I ALSO ADDED DICED SNICKERS BARS ON TOP AND ADDED A DOLLOP OF VANILLA ICE CREAM. BY FAR-ONE OF THE BEST CAKES I'VE HAD!!

Really delish!  I can't believe it worked.  I thought the first layer would burn, or the top wouldn't cook properly, or the caramel mixture would mix with the cake batter.  I don't know why, but it came out perfectly!

This cake is requested by my brother every year for his birthday.  I make a few changes though.  I do not use nuts (because his girlfriend is allergic to them), and I top the cake with the Caramel Frosting V on this site, but do not blend all the way.  It makes it more like a gooey glaze.  So yummy, and very rich!

I have been making this recipe for over 20 years, it is a favorite of ours.  The caramel filling is supposed to be somewhat solid once it cools off.  It is equally delicious warm or cold (or, in some cases, frozen!)

I made this cake for my boyfriend's birthday and his entire office loved it!  This is an extremely rich cake - you can't eat much!  I subbed Devil's Food cake and peanuts because he doesn't like coconut or walnuts.  Turned out great and also did the snickers on top.  Delicious!

It wasn't bad.  I am not a fan of box cakes in the first place, liking cakes made from scratch.  However, I made this for my daughter and her boyfriends birthday (they have it on the same day)  and they both really liked it.  The caramel mixture in the middle was really good-I did not substitute buying already made caramel in a jar as you really miss out on the taste.

This was fabulous! I substitued the walnuts for snickers candy bars as others had suggested. I also added chocolate frosting on top (it didn't look to pretty and it was for my mom's bday). It was very delicious and rich. definitly need a glass of milk or vanilla ice cream. I plan on making it again for my husbands bday.

Hubby made this for me for my birthday... so it must be easy to make. ;)  It was delicious too.  I know he used a regualr chocolate cake mix and used pecans instead of walnuts - was more like a turtle cake.  Good the first day; excellent the next day.

Oh my word!  This is such an awesome cake.  I wouldn't change one thing about it.  I'm ashamed to admit how much of it I ate.  I like it better on the second day.  Wow!  Great recipe, Carol!

This is sooo good, my husband and son loved it too. But, I didn't get that gooey center I expected and I measured carefully. Next time I'll try the bought caramel sauce, it's thicker, this didn't stay on top, maybe that's the problem. Will definitely make again and try it with the snickers bars too.

This recipe was awesome!  My husband requested a Snickers cake for his birthday.  He loved this one, infact my whole family loved it.  I changed it just a little by using a chocolate cake mix and peanuts, and the results were great.

Love it!!! Very easy, and very good. Made it for my mother-law-birthday luncheon, and it was a big hit. She has even requested the recipe. This is a keeper! P.S. I used a little bit more choc. chips and nuts. Great with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

I knew I had to try this when some reviewers said it was too rich (as if that is possible). It was wonderful and easy to make(and nice and rich!).  I will be making this again and again .  Next time I might try the toffee bits as one reviewer suggested instead of the walnuts.

This cake got raves at work!  I used caramel topping instead of caramels and butter (and should have used two jars, not one), and topped with bits of snickers candy (I used 3 bars).  I omitted the nuts altogether.  Very sweet, and very well received, thanks!

Yummy!  I was worried when I made this that it wouldn't be good because the caramel sauce was pretty runny when I poured it on the cake, but it was delicious!

BIG HIT AT WORK! and well worth the little time to make the caramel sauce!! I would have used a darker cake mix, not the " German cake mix" it called for but, more like a "devil food cake mix" or dark choc cake mix. I did pecans on 1 half and cut up snickers bar on the other. Snickers were better and I would try peanuts next time instead of pecans(salty peanuts would be perfect).

So good it should be illegal.  The only change I made was to use peanuts, and then after baking and cooling I spread chocolate frosting thinly on top and sprinkled crushed snickers bars on top.  Warmed up a bit with vanilla ice cream.  YUM!

This cake was so easy and so yummy. I didn't get a defined "filling", however, as described in previous posts. My caramel was pretty runny when I poured it over the cake. Perhaps, next time I will go ahead and purchase a caramel sauce instead. I also added toffee bits to the chocolate chips.
Edit: I just realized I added the entire 12 oz evaporated milk instead of the 5oz, hence no "filling."

I couldn't see pouring all that melted butter over the cake, so I cut back on the butter and used caramel topping instead of individually wrapped caramels. I also chopped 3 Snickers candy bars over the top and popped it back in the oven for 5 minutes to melt the candy bars just a bit. I took this to a Super Bowl party and it just didn't go over quite as well as expected. Turned out a lot of people were turned off by the walnuts. My fiancee and I loved it though, so we were happy to bring the leftovers (about half of the cake) home!

It was easy and delicious!  The instructions made it simple to follow and it turned out great. I found Kraft caramels bits which made it even easier ( instead of unwrapping them). I'll definitely make this again!

This really was delicious. I added pecans so it was walnut and pecans mixed. I also used very dark chocolate 60 %. Very decadent :)The last time putting in oven though it took longer. I had to bake it about 35 minutes

Super gooey and yummy!  So easy to make and so delicious.  I thought there was too much caramel to put in the middle of the cake so I set some aside and poured it over the top of the cake after it was done baking.

This is wonderful.  As per someone else's review, I topped it with Caramel Frosting V from this site.  It's not a very pretty cake as is, but this frosting is a beautiful color and just what the presentation needs. After frosting I added more nuts on top - looks beautiful!  I used pecans instead of walnuts, and used more than called for.  My only complaint is that it was hard to find a cake mix that was 18.25 oz. All of the name brand mixes were 15 or so ounces, so I had to go with a generic, just because it was the only mix in the specified amount.  Now that I've tried it, I might trust next time to make it with a 15 oz mix.  Really delish, thanks for the recipe!

I am not a sweets eater but I made this for my boyfriend and he loved it. I really enjoyed it as well with a side of ice cream. I made this recipe as stated but only put light walnuts across the top due to some not caring for walnuts. My favorite part was the gooey carmel that cooked on the edge pieces. I will definitly make again but next time make 2 small cakes and take one into the office.

First off I have to start off by saying. I don't like chocalate or cake. I know I'm weird. But, my friends birthday is today and he mentioned every year his mother makes him Chocolate Caramel cake. His parents are out of town, so yesterday I thought I would try and make it. This is my first cake so I was nervous, but I read the reviews and tried it. I made a test cake last night. My Mother was my guinea pig and she ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT. I couldnt find caramel, so I used 1 jar of caramel topping (I should have used 2) and I used 1/2 cup of semi sweet chocolate and a few pecan turtles (chopped)from Sees Candies (he loves those). And I sprinkles chopped pecans on top. Well I make his cake after work today, I hope he likes it :)
