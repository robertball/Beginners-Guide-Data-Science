It's got a little more cinnamon than I care for, and it's a bit thin.  I added more ice cream, and I think next time I'd cut down the cinnamon.  Overall a good drink though :)

i died when i tasted it! i also added vanilla ice cream ( 1 cup each ) and nesquik (or milo but nesquik is better, as it dissolves into the milk!)

I liked this Spicy milkshake.  But I think that it needed a little less Cinnamon.  A little less milk too.  It was runney and very sweet.  I would also add the cinnamon near the bottom or middle, but not the top of the blender.  I put the cinnamon in last and it all didn't get mixed in.  (There is nothing like have cinnamon in the back of your throat! cough, cough)
But all in all, I think I will make this again and not add so much cinnamon and milk.

I'm rating it 5 with my changes - 3 cups chocolate icecream, 1 cup vanilla icecream, 1 cup milk, 1 tablespoon Nesquick, 1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract.  Delish!!!

The description is right, but the name is wrong.  This is not thick enough to be considered a milkshake in my book; but a tasty, albeit sweet, drink.

My family loved this shake - with modifications. Didn't use brown sugar and cut way down on the cinnamon as suggested.  They have requested it for the 3rd night in a row. Thanks for sharing!

Very yummy!! I omitted the 1/4 white sugar, and went light on the cinnamon. Only had vanilla ice cream so I dumped a bunch of Hershey's chocolate syrup in & it tasted great!

o.m.g. this is stinkin' delicious!!! my friend and i made this at her house the other night and it was sooooo good. she said it was very filling. we didn't have any chocolate icecream so we used vanilla icecream and used hot chocolate powder and a whole lot less cinnamon (almost 1 tbs). very very good i'm about to make it again for me and my boyfriend.

Made this for my girls.  I skipped the cinnamon and they liked it.  The only thing I would change is start with half the milk because it was a little thin. I added more icecream to make it thicker.

Increased the ice cream and skim milk, added only a sprinkling of cinnamon and left out the sugars because I didn't think they would be necessary, add anything to the taste of the shake or dissolve properly. Used my drink master and added some chocolate syrup. My son enjoyed this.

This was a very bad milkshake. It was really runny and it had WAY to much cinnamon. If I made it again I would only use a dash of cinnamon and not so much milk. I gave this to my daughter, and we were both disappointed that a milkshake could be so bad.

This recipe had a little too much cinnamon; perhaps a teaspoon instead of a 1/4 cup would have been better.

I tried this the first time as is.  Then I made it about 3 more times (using chocolate low-fat frozen yogurt) to see how it worked out best for me... because really, it IS too much cinnamon, sugar AND milk.  I liked it best with 1/4th the cinnamon (just a touch of spice was nice), about half the sugar (better w/white than brown), and about 1/2 to 3/4ths the milk.  All of the milk works if you put the ice cream in last and don't over-blend it, and drink it right away.  But less milk works better.  By time I made these changes it was pretty good stuff, but I'm not gonna give a 5 to anything I have to make 4 times to get it right.

As is, I give it 3 stars.  That is waaaay too much cinnamon, and I love cinnamon.  Eliminate the white sugar, and only use 1 T. cinnamon to start.  You can always add more the next time.  An old soda fountain man told me years ago to always combine some chocolate with cinnamon because it enhances the flavor.  I guess he was right!

I think the recipe called for a little to much cinnamon but over all it was great!

This milkshake is outstanding! Obviously you can tell by ingredients it's very sweet so I'd recommend preparing it to taste.

Way too much cinnamon. Gave the shake a chalky texture.

Really great! The cinnamon was a great addition! To those who say it was runny, you need to put it in the freezer for 15 minutes or longer to make it thicken. Loved it!

I really liked this recipe.  I thought it could use less cinnamon and more ice cream, but otherwise it was a really good milkshake.

This was very good with a couple tweaks to the recipe.  I cut back a lot on the cinnamon - about 1 Tbsp.  - but with what I put in there it really added a great taste.  I also threw in some Hershey's syrup and took out the brown sugar.  My kids and husband gave it a big thumbs up!!  Thanks for the recipe!

It was great, a little thin, but very yummy. I used a hand blender instead of a food processor and it still turned out great!

My family and I loved this recipe, but I made it using a magic bullet, so four separate milkshakes. It was different having to separate the measurements but pretty easy. I added more ice-cream (to thicken) and milk, and a little less brown sugar. I also only sprinkled some cinnamon on top before mixing them. They tasted great and everyone wanted more!
Also, since I wanted chocolate shakes but only had vanilla ice-cream I added some chocolate syrup to the recipe. It was a lot of fun to make!

Absolutely delicious.  Didn't change a thing.  Even my landlords loved it!
