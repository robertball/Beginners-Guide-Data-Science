This stuff is AMAZING!!  I cannot stop eating it, wth a spoon!  with fruit! with graham crackers!  Unbelievable!!  I brought it to a get together and everyone was asking for the recipe.  I only had light sour cream and 2% milk, but used regular, full fat peanut butter and french vanilla pudding.  I don't like fruit dips that have orange flavors or marshmallow creme...cool whip was boring and chocolate was too messy to put out where kids would make a horrible mess. This was the perfect answer and I can't wait to make it again!!  The texture was awesome, it also holds up and was just as good the next day!  Thanks!

This recipe is wonderful. I made it for a potluck at work and have gotten many requests to make it again. Its very good, and is wonderful with apple, banana, or anything.

Great recipe for a holiday party. Everyone loved it so much they were dipping everything from fruit to celery stalks to potato chips. It's a winner and very easy to make!
