I obtained this recipe over 25 years ago from a neighbor in Utah...her version includes a glaze, that I think makes all the difference.  Glaze: 1 cup of sugar 1/2 cup water 2 Tbsp. Butter 1 tsp. coconut flavoring  For Glaze, combine sugar, water and butter; bring to a boil. Add coconut flavoring.  Pour hot glaze over top of loaves while still they are still warm.  Let sit in pans 4 hours before removing. Also the oven temp should be 325 degrees. This recipe does make 2 regular loaf pans(bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes) or 3 small loaf pans (bake 55 to 60 minutes) and a bundt pan will hold this recipe.  We just love this bread toasted and buttered.

This is a good recipe, however it makes TWO 9x5 loaf pans, not one.  I have made it several times and shared the recipe with many people.  It turns out very well by replacing the 1 c oil with 1/2 c oil and 1/2 c applesauce or by omitting the oil all together and using 1 c applesauce (unsweetened).  It's a chewier texture, but very good if you're looking to cut some calories.

12/23/04:  Very tasty but I am wondering if the oven temperature stated (375 degrees?) is a typo.  I baked the loaves for the stated time and temperature and the middle of the loaves were very raw...ended up baking it for another half hour.  Crust was burned but the center was salvagable.  I will try this just one more time before admitting defeat.**UPDATE**I made this once more and was disappointed again.  Tasty but other recipes are easier.

Thank you so much Susan, for posting this unusual and unusually easy recipe! I baked the batter into "muffin" form, versus a loaf, with a change in the baking time.  Most muffin recipes that fit into my "Texas" pan, call for 2 cups of flour, so this kooky cook, made 2/3 of your recipe.  They were delicious.  I thought these muffins would rise high, so I used Pam sprayed "skirts" to rest on top of each muffin hole.  By skirts, I mean old canned tuna or pineapple tins that I've removed both sides of the lids, and use just for muffins.  Superb chewy, dense textured muffins, with a big cocoanut flavor.  Keep on cooking and posting Susan!
Best wishes,
Jeff

Just made these for the first time.  I made them in a mini-muffin pan for an upcoming family reunion Memorial Week-end.  They turned out great (all 88 of them).  I baked them at 350 for about 10 to 12 minutes.  I plan to freeze them til the reunion and and then put a light coconut glaze on them.  They were very easy to make and didn't take up alot of time.  (If some of you didn't know, there is a product on the market called Cultured Buttermilk Blend put out by Saco, so you can make just the amount of buttermilk you need instead of having to buy a whole quart of fresh buttermilk)  Thanks for the recipe Susan...I'm sure I'll be making these little gems often.

This recipe is absolutely divine! Easy to make and more delectable to eat. The coconut flavor is so perfect. The bread is like a pound cake. I will make this again and again. Thank you for posting this.

Very moist - perfect with coffee. I used vanilla extract because there was no coconut extract, still good.

The recipe definitely makes two, not one loaf. Also, I think that 375 is too high. I noticed the edges getting way too brown about half way through cooking and bumped the oven down to 350. Keeping the oven at 350 for the whole time would make for better bread, I think. My boyfriend is from Guatemala and keeps talking about coconut bread. It's excellent toasted with melted butter for breakfast. Would definitely make it again.

This was my Grandmas Recipe that she got from some folks who visited the Islands about 50 years ago. This recipe is meant as a deasert loaf, and should never be bigger than the 3X3X6 loaf pans. It will make 3 1/2 of these. I have also found that if you use a quiche pan you can make miniture cupcakes of this I call coconut "poppers" since they can be popped in the mouth so easily. Same temp as bread just cook for 10-14 min. cheack with toothpick to see if done and your set. Her Hubby

This is a fabulous recipe.  I followed the instructions exactly, except for adding a glaze to the top.  It made 3 smaller loafs and I baked for 50-55 minutes.  The glaze listed in one of the reviews is the perfect addition to it, just amazing.  I love coconut and this didn't disappoint.  My kids think I am a great chef now and asked me to make it again soon!  For the glaze (if you don't want to search the other reviews): 1 cup of sugar 1/2 cup of water 2 tbsp of butter (I used salted) 1 tsp of coconut extract (or 2 if you really like coconut flavor)  While the bread was warm, I poked holes all over it with a knife and then poured some of the glaze over it slowly so it would sink in a little.  After it had cooled some, I used a kitchen brush to spread some more glaze on the top.

I have been making this recipe for 5 years now.  A friend gave me a copy of it and I just made it last night.  

I bake mine at 325 for 1 hour to create 2 loaves.  Or, I make small loaves and bake for 50 minutes rotating the pans once while cooking.  I have a 4 loaf pan and this recipe fills it nicely with just a bit of batter left-over.  I also sprinkle mine with a bit of coconut before baking to get the coconut look to it.  I served it at church this morning and many people thought it was lemon or pound cake.  Enjoy it!

This recipe is almost identical to one on the Taste of Home website. The only difference is in the amt. of baking powder This one calls for 1/2 tsp. baking powder. On the Taste of Home it is 1 tsp baking powder.  AlsoI think the temp is too high. It should be 325 degrees.

Baked this recipe twice with the same results.  I finally figured out that with an hour bake time & oven temperature at 350 degrees, the bread was still underbaked.  I also think there was too much flour and eggs.  I have baked loaf breads previously & the instructions may be a factor as I have looked at other recipes which did not call for the large amounts of flour and eggs. I have used butter in my recipes instead of shortening & oil & never encountered such a disaster.  Perhaps the person who put this recipe on the internet should take another look and make adjustments.

This recipe yielded way more batter than could fit into my loaf pan, so I used the leftover batter to make muffins.  After 22 mins., the muffins were perfectly cooked and were superbly moist and delicious; however, the bread was not nearly done after 45 mins. and required a lot longer to bake, hardening and nearly burning the outside.  So four stars for a delicious recipe but flawed cooking instructions.

This is such an easy and simply excellent recipe. It comes out more like a cake really, rather than a bread. It's something like what we Trini's call a sweet bread. I've made it a few times and it always receives a standing ovation.

I've made this bread 3 times now! Every time is better than the previous!  I did make several changes and followed some of the advice in the reviews. - I used 1/2C less sugar - I used 1/2C oil (extra virgin olive oil in fact) and 1/2 C apple sauce - I used egg beaters instead of whole eggs - I used coconut milk once and almond milk another - I added 1/4tsp freshly grated nutmeg - I also added 1/2c golden raisins I followed the advice by one of the raters to decrease the oven temp to 325F.  Excellent advise. It was a hit every time!  Absolutely delicious!

first time experience.  I ended up using pound cake container since the volume was quite large.  I too see that the center isn't cooked at 50 minutes at 375.....that assumes of course I didn't make a fundamental error......when it called for white sugar I used granulated sugar.  I hope this was right and recipe wasn't asking for powdered.  Anyway, so far so good.  After about 55 min I turned it down to 325 F as another review suggested.  Was fine after another 30 minutes.  Not burned looking either. Tasted fine.

I made this following the recipe and using only ONE loaf pan.  I should have used two.  It took a lot longer to bake and the bottom got burnt.  I was making this for a bake sale, now I will have to bake something else.  The cake does have good flavor.

This bread was okay, but not great.  Not a lot of coconut flavor.  It made six 3 x 6 pans.  I sprinkled coconut on the the top of the batter in some of the pans prior to baking.  Those were a little better.  Might make a good base for strawberry shortcake.  It does get better after sitting a couple of days.  Probably won't make again, unless I make some changes to the recipe.

It was good, however it comes out a bit burnt at the stated temperature. If I make it again, I will reduce the temperature and cooking a bit longer.

Made this with coconut milk instead of buttermilk (because I had it on hand) and a little lemon juice. Also added sliced Almonds to the batter and sprinkled raw sugar on top. It was very coco nutty and moist, like I was having coffee and sweet bread in the Hawaiian Islands.

Great recipe- I altered the buttermilk and used Greek yogurt with some lemon juice- and added the glaze mentioned in the other review! My mother inlaw uses the same recipe! It makes all the difference!

This is an excellent sweet bread.the coconut flavor is wonderful.I used Fred's suggestion for the glaze and made three mini loaves and baked at the lower temp. We toasted and buttered the slices. Yum!

Mmm! Yummy!  Very soft and fluffy. My mom said it was more like a cake than a muffin. Note: I doubled the baking soda, quadrupled (4x?) the baking powder, and halved the sugar. Replaced all purpose flour with cake flour. Added 1/2 cup chopped macadamias too. Also used half coconut and half vanilla extracts. Heck, I even throw in orange or lemon extracts at times! I sprinkled some sweetened shredded coconut on the tops before baking as well. (I baked these as muffins, at 400F for approx... 20mins?)

This recipe was ok.  I had to make a few changes after finding out that the shredded coconut leaves the bread too dry.  Instead of 2 tsp of coconut extract I added 1 tbsp and a half, then I changed the shredded coconut from 1 cup to 1/4 cup.  After those changes the bread was moist and perfect!

This was just OK. I was thinking it would be more like a dessert bread/cake. It was a little bland, but good enough for a slice for breakfast with some butter.

I thought the bread was way too sweet, need to cut down on the sugar. This one stated it makes one 9x5 loaf, I am not an experienced cook so I follow recipes exactly, what I ended out with was a huge mess and a big disappointment.  I realize now there was too much batter but a head's up on that would have been nice.
