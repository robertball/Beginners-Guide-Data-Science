Added sliced mushrooms just because I had them. Would have added more cheese as couldn't tell there was cheese in it. It didn't really have a big flavor. Would have added more spices.My husband loved it. It was a great way to use up the ham from Easter. I would make it again cause it was easy and is a comfort food.

Easy to make.  I omitted white wine since I had none on hand, added seasoning salt, sauteed onion and some frozen peas.  Delish!  I have also made this with canned ham and it worked extremely well.

Sorry, I thought this was rather dry.   After baking and tasting, I put it in a large bowl and added another can of soup, more wine and 1/2 cup of chicken broth.  Put it back in the oven for another 20 min to heat through.  I think this would be better with chicken instead of ham.

Tastes great and a true "comfort food"
Rated 4 instead of 5 beause I made adjustments based on what I had in the house.  1st - I precooked the noodles to cut on time while I sauted onions and reheated the cubed ham in a skillet (salt pepper etc).  2nd - added frozen peas to give some nutrition.  3rd - used mont. jack cheese instead of swiss, thats all I had.  4th - Used italian bread crumbs, again all I had.  Skipped the wine and milk, didn't need it.  Baked at 350 for 20 min to let flavors blend.  YUMM!!  A great meal with basic ingredients.

I gave it 5/5.  Quick and easy to make. Even though a little dry (maybe over cooking?), it tasted great and used up some of the left over Christmas ham.  Next time maybe I will cover with foil to keep some moisture in.

This was easy and delicious. Was a tad salty for me but that is easily taken care of, as others have suggested next time will add peas or your favorite veggie, or as Mallory suggests asparagus would be a very nice match.

Great recipe!
Ugh, I know I hate it when people rate recipes when they changed things, but I'm caving :)
This recipe whips up really fast, and easy. I had leftover egg noddles from beef stroganoff the night before (somehow I always make too many noodles). I made a few substitutions for what I had on hand - milk for the white wine, cheddar for the swiss, and turkey ham for the ham. 
It came out sooooo good. I loved how the stuffing mix was a salty crunch, and the noodles were creamy. If you don't like salt, then make sure to use low sodium everything - ham, cream of mushroom, cheese, and stuffing all are typically pretty salty stuff.
The only thing I would work on whem making again, is that it came out, well, soupy. Maybe less water, or let it bake longer?
Despite the sloppy-ness of it, I am more than excited to eat it for leftovers today and tomorrow at work!

I added a 1/2 cup of sour cream instead of wine and it was perfect.

No cream of mushroom soup on hand, instead I used a can of cream of chicken. I added some fresh ground pepper to the soup mix. Not a bad recipe, very simple and fast to make. I would make this again but I think I'd play with the recipe a bit.

Love the taste of this. I’ve made it twice, both times a hit in our house. The only thing I change - and it’s purely personal preference - is to add fresh mushroom and diced onion lightly sauteed. That said, if i didn’t have them, i’d still make the dish. The swiss cheese and wine with ham is a great combo.

Made as indicated and it was quite dry. Baked for 5 minutes less than advised and still why too dry. Add another can of soup next time. Has great potential.

Gave it four stars because it's a very good base recipe that you can tweak to suit your personal taste. 
I used 4 C dried noodles for a 9x13 pan and am happy that I increased the quantity.  May have used a bit more ham than the recipe called for, I didn't measure it, and definitely used more cheese than called for.  Will absolutely make it again, adding sauted vegetables and more spices.

I loved this recipe for its simplicity - I normally have all the ingredients on hand.  I didn't use wine since I didn't have any on had so substituted chicken broth.  Threw in a can of peas and a can of mushrooms and for more creaminess added in about a 1/2 cup of cottage cheese just because I had it on hand and wanted the extra creaminess..  Once I had it all mixed together I added more broth since I thought it looked a little dry.  Topped the stuffing with a few pats of butter and baked - delish!
