I made this, but subbed tofu for the chicken so it was vegan!  It was super delicious. We add shredded cheese sometimes (then it's not vegan). You can use it in lettuce wraps, or sometimes we put it in tortillas so it's more like burritos. It also makes great leftovers!!

This was a huge hit in my house.  We brought this to a housewarming party and all the guests loved it.  It's healthy and very tasty.

I could not find the mango seasoning so I used a lime mojito seasoning. It was not a great hit with my family. We like all the ingredients but I think for us it was the texture. It was just an ok dish and probably wouldn't make again.
