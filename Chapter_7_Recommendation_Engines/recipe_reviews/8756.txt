HELPFUL TIPS: I love this recipe, & found it a lot tastier than a similar dish "Jerusalem Chicken" on here.  Found no need for adding butter before the chicken & obviously from my pic, we don't always use mushrooms.  It's just a matter of being in the mood to add them or what we have in the pantry. I'm also not sure why it says to have COOKED chicken.  I never pre-cook or even cut the chicken in small pieces.  I did use use a little PAM on my glass dish.  While using an expensive wine can enhance any dish, I've had great results using the cheapest wine at the store.  I use fat free evaporated milk, any cream of chicken or mushroom, and don't be scared off by the mayo b/c you won't be able to taste it. I also use (any flavor) Almond Accents to go on top (found next to the fresh salads), and can't imagine NOT adding them to the dish.  It's that good!!  This goes great with potatoes on the side, and I use the honey potato recipe (1 lb red potatoes quartered, 1T butter, 3T honey, and 1t dry mustard - bake 40 min).  The salad in my pic is just romaine with sliced strawberries and of course more almond accents and we sometimes sprinkle dried blueberries and cranberries on top.  Every toddler that comes over loves this fruit salad.  Yummy!

Ok, so I made a bunch of changes, but this turned out great! First, I sauted some yellow onion with the butter. I didn't use the canned milk or the mayo. (I replaced the mayo with sour cream) I increased the white wine and sour cream to make up for the milk. (I didn't measure, just eye balled it) Also, I didn't use the almonds. Anyway, we loved this. I served it with Sour Cream and Chive Mashed Potatoes from this web site. Yummy! Thanx so much for sharing this recipe!

A very good recipe!
To make the meal lower in fat, I used low fat cream of mushroom soup, fat free evaporated milk, and very little butter to saute the mushrooms. I think next time I'll try 2% cheddar cheese. With that change, it if works, this can become a regular meal rather than just for a special occasion.
I also suggest that the mayonaise be added right before the sauce is taken off the heat for better consistency.

Very good flavor. Didn't have any cream of mushroom soup so subbed cream of chicken. This reminded me of a hot chicken dip someone made a few years ago at a baby shower. It is rich and next time, I will reduce the amount of butter.

This recipe is deliciously EXQUISITE! Perfect for a romantic dinner for two, or as a scrumptious, sophisticated dinner for a cozy crowd! I did however change the way I cooked the recipe, though I'm sure the overall taste has remained the same. Instead of cream of mushroom soup I used cream of chicken. I used regular skim milk instead of the condensed milk. Instead of cheddar cheese, I used about shredded mozzarella and some cream cheese. (Sorry I don't measure!) And I added more wine. Then, I let it all simmer in a large skillet on low heat for half an hour instead of baking it. Served it over the rice...MMMMMM! Delicious!

This was good. But I think the next time I'll sub sour cream for mayonaise. My husband didn't really care for the mayo flavor much.

This was a quick, easy one to make.  I used low sodium soup and it didn't make a difference.  My entire family loved it.  I would absolutely make it again and again.

WOW!! This is really DELICIOUS and most of my family of 10 agreed! The only change I made was to saute 1-2 cloves of FRESH MINCED garlic in the 2 TBS butter, THEN put it in the 9x13 pan. If you do this, skip the garlic powder in the sauce.  After baking, it was necessary to whisk the sauce a bit to smooth it out, but we served it over noodles and there was plenty of the cheesey, wine-y, garlicky mix to suite everyone's preferences. Thanks Kay!!

I have made this for so many people now, and everyone always asks for the recipe.  I use low fat mayo, soup and evaporated milk, and you can't tell the difference.  It is really easy to throw together too!

meh...I don't get the high ratings here.  Followed the recipe exactly and I'm sure it came out just like it should have but it was - average.  Not worth the extremely high caloric intake for something so...well, unnoteworthy.  Save those extra calories for something special!  We ate it, won't make it again.  I think, and this is personal preference, I will NEVER like Cream of Mushroom/Chicken soup as a base so this was my own fault for trying to take the easy way out.  Otherwise, easy to prepare, cooking times spot-on.

YUMMY! I followed the recipe exactly except for the cooking method. I sauteed the mushrooms with onion until they were browned and then transfered them into a bowl. I then took  3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts(2 lbs) that I had cut into 3rds or 4ths, seasoned them  with pepper and herbs de provence and cooked them in the same pan. I then added the mushrooms and onions back in and added the wine-soup sauce to the pan on the stovetop. I turned the heat to low and simmered for about 30 minutes. My only complaint is that the sauce was too thick for my liking; probably because I coooked it on the stove instead of the oven. Next time I will add more evaporated milk or wine to correct this. The flavor was rich and wonderful; my 2yr old who hates chicken (but loves cheese) licked his plate clean, and my husband couldn't resist 2nds. This one goes into the rotation!

This was easy to make, but just not that good.  I've had other chicken recipes that combine soups with mayo and wine and they've turned out great.  This one however just didn't do it.  Since the chicken is in the oven for an hour at 350 I didn't see the need to pre-cook it.  I just layered the chicken and mushrooms and poured the sauce over it.  The chicken was tender, but I won't be doing this one again.

Very good, I did browse the reviews and sauteed onions along with the mushrooms and added Herbs de Provence to the sauce. To reduce the fat content, I replaced the mayo with nonfat yogurt and used the light version of cream of mushroom soup.  This is very similiar to Chicken Tetrazini, but without the pasta.

I tried this recipe hoping that it would be something exciting and different. Unfortunatelly I was disappointed. The sauce didn't have a whole lot of flavor and my family was not so happy with me for trying it.

I love this dish!  I have made it a dozen or more times and I'm just getting around to reviewing it.  This recipe has been thrown into my family's regular dinner rotation, we all love it.  It's great over rice, pasta, or with potatoes.  Thanks for such an easy, and tasty recipe!

Great recipe, here were my changes, no wine, used chicken broth, sauteed 4 cloves fresh minced garlic with fresh crimini mushrooms in 2 tbsp butter, seared chicken breasts, cut into big slices, layered into baking dish- chicken, mushrooms, sauce, baked for 35 minutes at 350, added parm and sliced almonds, 10 more minutes, perfectly cooked! Sauce does get a little chunky, just whisk sauce with couple tbsp chicken broth and it's good to go! Served over linquine w/ garlic baquettes.

This recipe is to die for. I made the breasts whole and served over wild rice with a side of green beans. Like another reviewer, I didn't feel the need to cook the chicken before it went in the oven, so I just browned it in the same pan as the mushrooms to seal in the juices. It came out tender and definitely cooked after 45 minutes.

This recipe was so simple and incredibly good!  I followed it exactly (except for the almonds which I didn't have on hand) and wouldn't change a thing.  My husband told me at least 10 times during dinner it's a new favorite of his.  We can't wait for the leftovers!

Easy to make!  Also my picky child ate just the chicken with a little of the sauce.  Instead of cut-up cooked chicken I browned chiken breasts (2 lbs) a few minutes on each side in the same pan I sauted the mushrooms in (after removing the mushrooms).  I also used 2% milk since I didn't have any evaporated milk.

Not my (or my daughter's) thing though my husband & son liked it. Too fattening & I just don't like cream of whatever soup as the base of many recipes.

This was a great recipe and will definitely make it again!  Instead of the evaporated milk, I used 1% milk.  I also sauteed the mushrooms with an onion, and replaced the mayo with sour cream.

This turned out amazing!!  Although I did make a few changes. I left the chicken breasts whole and lightly browned them first. Changed the cream of mushroom soup to cream of broccoli. Substituted sour cream for the condensed milk , added fresh garlic and also 1/2 cup of cream cheese. I cooked as directed, removed the chicken after cooking, poured the sauce over pasta, and then placed the whole chicken breast back on each plate that was served. The chicken was so tender and juicy!!! The second time we made this was with canned mushrooms and what a big mistake, sautee fresh mushrooms in butter and this will turn out beautifully!

We did not like this one bit.I am not sure if it was the recipe or my taste buds. It was very heavy and seemed to overwhelm the chicken itself. I will not be making this one again.

This was a fantastic meal for a cold night. The combination of flavours was perfect and nothing was overpowering. I added spring onion and used real garlic instead of powdered. Will be making this again soon!

This was very rich and tastey.  I made this for Valentine's Day, so it was a VERY rare and special occasion for us to indulge like this.  I gave it 4 instead of 5 because I don't know if it was worth the calories.  "Mmmn" good, but not "ohmygosh" good.

This recipe was great with some tweaks.  I used thin sliced chicken breast which I browned first.  I also added 2 sliced onions with the mushrooms as the cooked (cooked in the same pan as the chicken for more flavor).  I also used 1/2 cup sour cream instead of mayo and used a little less wine then the recipe called for.  Lastly, I cooked mine at 375 for about 20-25 minutes til it was nice and bubbly and the parmesan started to brown.  Very tasty alternative to the typical chicken and cream of mushroom soup.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is wonderful! I didn't have cream of chicken soup, so I used cream of mushroom soup and it was still great. Wonderful over rice! :)

This was easy and good. Even my teenager who hates everything except cheese pizza said it was good. I added red bell pepper and onion along with the sauted mushrooms.

This was very good.  Since I'm the only one who likes mushrooms, next time I'll try substituting par-steamed broccoli.  45-50 minutes bake time was plenty.

This Chicken acme out so JUICY.  It tasted absolutely wonderful.  My husband doesn't usually like wine sauces, but he gobbled this meal up and actully requested it again the next night.  A definite winner in my house!

I didn't have any almonds so I skipped them. I also added more garlic. This was excellent!

We loved this recipe! 
We did make a few minor changes. We added about 1 tablespoon of mustard and used frozen garlic instead of powdered.
We also didn't want to wait to bake it, so we grilled the chicken, sliced it, put it on top of pasta and then topped the whole thing with the sauce!

Thank you some much for the recipe!

I followed this recipe exactly and the chicken turned out dry. I think the 1 hour cooking time is too long. The chicken is already cooked anyway. The sauce had seperated and was horribly greasy but a good stir was all it needed. I actually loved the sauce. I will use this sauce again some another way.

It was delicious!  I cooked this on Valentine's Day for my boyfriend and family.  They loved it!  I listened to the other reviews and presented this on a bed of linguine.  I used fresh mushroom and Italian-five cheese shredded cheese!  I just wish the sauce stayed creamy when I made it on the stove.  But after transferring it to the pan and in the oven, the sauce separated.  Still, I recommend this because it is delicious.  My family still preferred to add extra cheese to top it when serving.

Thank you for submitting your recipe.  I wasn't a member when I printed it out (in April of 2006).  It's in my cookbook and I've made it plenty of times. My family really loves it.

I made this recipe for my in-laws and they loved it.  Substituted sour cream for the mayonnaise, and I forgot to top with the almonds and parmesan, but it was still good.  Next time I would serve it over noodles or rice.

I thought this was rather bland!  My daughter loved it (hence the 2 stars), but the rest of our family had difficulty eating it.

I don't add the cheddar cheese, evaporated milk nor the slivered almonds and I bake everything in a skillet on the stovetop. This recipe is divine and delicious! :)

A little too cheesy in my opinion.  I did not use mayo or almonds.  I also only used 1 tbsp. butter (although I think you could easily omit the butter all together).

We had this for Valentine's day.  It was a very nice dish.  I had marinated the chicken in a lemon-pepper marinade, which may have over-powered the flavor of the sauce. I will try again though.  The sauce has a nice creamy texture.
