Whatever your favorite drink is, choose the fruit jello and the liquor.  Mojito:  lime jello, rum, a splash of mint liquor.  Pina Colada:  coconut rum and pineapple jello.  Watermelon and Citrus vodka.  Seabreeze:  Cranberry Jello, Grapefruit juice and vodka... Then either use an ice cube tray sprayed lightly with Pam or cut a big pan of this down to make cubes and put them in those small condiment cups sold at Costco or Smart and Final.  Line them up on the bar.  This way, they can be slammed down like a shooter without people having to dig them out with a spoon.  Be very careful, you don't taste exactly how much alcohol is in there until way too late.....

This recipe was good, but I think plain vodka with any flavor of jello is better.  Sometimes you just need to stick to the basics.

I've never had these before, but many friends recommended them.  I used Berry blue jello with Wild Berry Schnapps (vodka gives me a headache), Pineapple jello with Wild Berry, and Apricot jello with Peach Schnapps.  Everyone loved them.  I will make on regular basis as an "adult" dessert.  Thanks.

Made these over the weekend and they didn't turn out right.  Hubby couldn't fine the berry vodka so we used half regular vodka and half plum wine.  VERY STRONG!!  We didn't have the paper cups either so I had to pour this into a glass dish and refrigerate till set.  I cut them into squares and swallowed them whole.  It literally looked like green snot, but the taste was good.  I will definitely use the cups next time.

These rock and the combinations are endless!! I made one using the tropical fruit jello and malibu and another with stawberry & vodka. I did reduce the alcohol to 3/4 cup in both flavors and they were good but I MIGHT try them with the full cup next time. Watch out...these will nip you in the bud!! Will make these for many parties and events to come! (thank god we had some food around to soak up that alcohol!) Thanks Hollie!

These were great!  We mixed a few different flavors so that we got a black-ish color and then added a gummy worm in each for our Halloween party!

Easy for a party.  I serve this at Halloween in petri dishes at the mad scientist drink station.  It is always the first "drink" to go.

They were great!  But wait until the gelatin-boiling water mixture cools down.  Heat evaporates alcohol.

The first time I made these I used rasberry jello and rasberry vodka and they were way too strong! Even the hard core drinkers could not stomach them. Then I used cherry jello and Captain Morgans Spiced Rum and they were great!

This is a great recipe for jello shots. I used regular vodka and it was good just like that,but I wouldn't use a cheap vodka.

These are great!  Use PLASTIC cups (1.25 ounce) so they wont stick, I know party city carries them, and they come with lids.  So you can chill them, close them and then (after hardened) put into a big bag for easy transport!!  Great for LARGE batches.  I oil them with veggie oil lightly with a paper towel so they pop right out into your mouth!!  Works great and easy!

Whoa...  These things are toxic.  The vodka was just too overwhelming.  Maybe its because I put them in those little condiment cups with lids.  You were hit with the smell of vodka when you opened them up.  People drank them, and we had a great time (took them on a bus trip to Stateline) but I wish they had tasted better.  Someone told me that flavored Schnapps works much better than vodka, and I am going to try that next time.  Great idea though.  Thanks!  *****update****  I tried making jello shooters again, this time I used one small package of jello, dissolved it with 3/4 boiling water, let it cool a bit and then added 3/4 cup of schnapps (Raspberry Pucker flavor) They were fantastic!

This recipe was very good.  They were set when I checked them one and a half hours later.  I put them in 3 oz. disposable plastic bathroom cups.  They were a little big but they worked.  I used strawberry jello and Creme De Banana Liquer.  They tatsted great but they weren't strong at all.  I am going to make these for New Year's Eve tomorrow, but I think I will try some stronger alcohol.  I used a turkey baster to get the jello into the cups.

very yummy, went down relativly easy...even though we added extra vodka already, next time i would add more...only because it would help them soften up a bit.

I make these all the time and they are always expected when I have a party. I never use plain vodka or plain rum anymore as I find them too strong, I use flavored alcohol instead. My favorite is Raspberry Sour Puss (like Raspberry Puckers) and Extreme Raspberry Jello. Some other good ones are Amaretto and Orange Jello, Peach Schnapps and Peach Jello, Malibu Rum and Pina Colada Jello (or Pineapple Jello), Midori and Watermelon Jello. I use small paper cups, about 1 oz, kind of like the little paper cups you get at McDonald's to put ketchup in. The first time I used these however, the liquid was too hot and it leaked through the paper. What we do now, is mix it all in a bowl, then place the bowl in the freezer for about 10-15 minutes to cool it off, then pour them into the paper cups using a turkey baster. They are amazing!

Made "margarita" shooters (tequila with lime jello), grape jello with vodka, and tropical fruit jello with pineapple rum. These were great. Felt bad for the person that ate all the margarita ones! They were pretty dangerous...

To get perfect consistancy be sure to stir boiling water & jell-o for full 2 minutes, then add very cold vodka (I keep mine in the freezer). Perfect every time!

Easy and quick.  Got compliments on the flavor and presentation (I added a gummy worm each, which helped mask the vodka). 
Despite a strong alcohol taste, these were actually quite weak.  I took them to a Halloween party and everyone had several (5-6), but at best people were just barely drunk.  I had twice as many as that (an entire ice cube tray, or half a batch) in order to sustain a *light* buzz.
Since Halloween was on a weekday this year, I suppose that was a good thing.    However, I wouldn't make them again this way (I'd increase the vodka), since as far as I know, the point of jello shots is to get drunk fast.

Cheap liquor still tastes bad in Jello.  The quality you use will determine if they taste "alcohol-ly" or not.  We made the mojito, per another reviewer, and also made some with raspberry jello and UV Blue.  Very good.

I used regular Vodka with Blue Raspberry and Lime Jello. I made 60 Shots and everyone had at least 2-3 shots each. They did not last long! I had many compliments. Will make them again.

These were very tasty! I made two batches for the 4th of July - one red (Mixed Fruit Jello - added a little red food coloring to make it more red than the pink'ish color it was) and one blue (Berry Blue) - both w/raspberry vodka. To make "shooting" it easier, I made them in 9x13 dishes, scooped them into white bathroom Solo cups and alternated them (red, blue) on a couple of serving platters - very patriotic looking, and well-received - thanks!

Awesome!  My fridge had a stench of alcohol for a few days, but it's always worth it!  We made these for St Patty's day, so we used lime jello and lemon flavored rum (Bicardi Limon).  I've also tried raspberry jello with Bicardi Razz (or any rasberry-flavored rum) for Valentine's day.  We used the 2oz solo cups and they were a perfect size.  I go to Penn State so this fall we plan on bringing these to football tailgates, and using blue jello...

I made a batch using Berry Blue Jello and a batch with Strawberry Jello.  I did not have any berry vodka, so I used Smirnoff Vodka.  The shots were a hit at my Halloween party!  Thanks for an easy shooter recipe!

I Make these for parties, they really lighten up a party! I have used rum and vodka in mine before and they are awesome, the best jello flavor we have found to use lately is "watermelon" we mix it with the rum! excellent! I also use the plastic cups but if i dont have them i use dixie cups!

Fun recipe.  If you have a store like Smart and Final in your area, pick up the little plastic cups used for cheese with pretzels.  Easy to fill, just the right size for a "shot" and they line up easily on a cookie sheet to set in the refigerator.  Learned this from a mom at Little League.

I made 4 different flavor combinations of these for a girls only party and they were all a huge success. Sure, we ended up pretty drunk but that was the point, right?

A bit too strong . 3 parts water to 1 part vodka would have worked better. Rather than 1 to 1. Doesnt set properly if using this recipe with aeroplane jelly. As that brand is 450 ml total liquid per packet.
