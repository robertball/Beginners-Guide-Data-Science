I'm vegetarian but made these for my carnivore sister, who lists corndogs as one of her all-time favorites (along with spam, pork-n-beans and basically any other type of nitrate-infused meat). She really enjoyed them! I could not find refrigerator cornbread twists so used actual cornbread mix, which I prepared using only 1/2 the liquid so the stuff would stick to the dog. It worked ok and baked fine, although I'm sure the twists would be much more attractive, if that's a term that can be used on a corn dog. I'm giving this a 4 star because pre-cooked bacon is expensive and she didn't actually eat the whole pan.

I made these for a superbowl party and they were a hit!  Kids and adults loved them.  I left out the bacon.  Served them hot out of the oven with a jar of mustard and they were gone in minutes!
