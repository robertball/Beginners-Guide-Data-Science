This was great!  I added 1/4 cup more milk to the grits, as my grits label said 3 cups liquid to 3/4 cup grits - was glad I did that, or they would have been too thick.  I added 1/4 tsp. salt + 1/4 tsp. pepper to the finished grits.  I used 1 bunch chopped *green* onions instead of regular, along with 1 chopped red bell pepper, and sauteed that and the garlic before adding the shrimp.  I added 1/8 cup white wine to the mixture while cooking.  When the shrimp were finished, I sprinkled salt & pepper over it all, then served the grits over fresh greens to make them wilt a little bit, and added the shrimp to the top.  Fabulous!  Thanks for the recipe!

Since there were two components to this recipe, I had to average out my rating. I could only give 2 stars. Although the final taste of the grits were very good, I had to add 3/4 cup more liquid to have them come out correct. With 3 cups liquid, they would have finished hard instead of cooked through. With regard to the shrimp recipe, 1 onion is way too much onion. I liked the garlic but they really needed salt and pepper to elevate the taste. Garlic powder may have functioned better than minced garlic with the shrimp. A dash of hot pepper couldn't save them. I really wanted to like this and I think you've got a good start but, as written, your recipe didn't work for us. Thank you.

These were really really good.  I think the trick is to use real chicken stock, not the canned stuff.  I had some stock that I froze last time I did a chicken and used it for this recipe.  Delicious!

Wow !!!!! Good Stuff ! Being from the north I had never had shrimp and grits before, so I was really impressed at how easy and delicious these where. This recipe will now be in my rotation for sure.

This is actually a pretty good recipe except for the liquid ratio being off for the grits. Like some others I added an extra cup of milk (I used whole) and the grits came out great. I also added a whole onion and a squeeze of lemon to the shrimp topping.

This recipe was delicious! Talk about a quick dinner to prepare!!! Only changes I made were to double the recipe as we have hungry teenagers and to bulk up a bit by adding small pieces of Keilbassa sausage. I would also like to add that adding a little more liquid was a great idea. It got devoured quickly! If you would like a more hearty dish, you might double the toppings (shrimp part) and keep the grits  portion the same. Yummy and thanks for the recipe!

This was an excellent recipe! It was my first time making shrimp and grits and it was delicious. I followed the advice of others and added an extra cup of milk. Without it, I'm sure the grits would have been pasty.

This was unbelievable! Made as is except did add 1more cup of milk because my grits specified 1c dry to 4 c liquid. Never had shrimp and grits and am so glad this was my first try. This is a keeper. So easy. I had all of the ingredients on hand. Thanks!

Made a few substitutions, but it's definitely deserves 5 star! CHANGES I MADE: Used Half-n-half instead of milk. Used 2 tablespoons of garlic instead of measurement listed.  I used a blend of Monterey Jack and Cheddar Cheese! Skipped the onions and seasoned shrimp  with HEB Garlic Pepper Seasoning. Garnished with green onions and enjoy!

Very good. I shouldn't have added any salt to the grits because they were a little too salty (I didn't try them before I salted and I knew better!).

The grits were Fabulous! Rich, creamy and full of flavor... The shrimp, not so much. I think I added too much olive oil with the butter, because all I could taste was the oil flavor. The recipe itself is great, I think "the chef" made the error. Will definitely make again, this time with a lighter hand when heating the oil.

I’ve made this a few times and it never disappoints. I only made two changes: I used Gouda cheese instead of cheddar and I used 1/2 of an onion instead of a whole one. This meal can be thrown together in minutes and it disappears faster than the time it took to prepare it. :)

This is now a staple in our recipe rotation. Only change we made is that we prefer smokey Gouda instead of cheddar cheese. Serve with cheddar bay biscuits!

Delicious!   I did adjust the  Sriracha and added a bit of dry white wine.  I served  the shrimp along side so we could peel off the ends without digging through the grits.  MRC

Shrimp and grits are two of my favorite foods combined together. This is a yummy and flavorful recipe. Velveeta is key to creaminess and sharp flavor.

WOW these are GOOD!  I've never had shrimp and grits (just didn't sound like they went together to me) so perhaps I'm not the best judge, but my husband and I both absolutely loved this.  I did use more shrimp, and was glad I did, as I didn't think the amount called for was enough. Excellent tasting  and pretty dish.

This was very good. But we like hot and spicy, so it needed more garlic  and hot sauce. This is excellent for milder taste buds. Definitely will make again!

Being from the Low Country, I have tried dozens of great shrimp n' grits recipes.  This one is by far the best.  It is easy enough to make so try it!

Wonderful!  We used sriracha hot sauce - it was the perfect heat to compliment the flavors!

This is a great recipe. I added a can of creamed corn to the grits. It was terrific but it would have been just as good without it.
