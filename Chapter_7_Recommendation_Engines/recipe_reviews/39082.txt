I made these for a party and every woman there wanted the recipe to take home with them.  One of my male neighbors stopped by the next day to let me know how much he had enjoyed them.

I baked these in 2 9" cake pans.  I had to increase the baking time to 35 minutes but they still came out moist and delicious.  I also opted to frost them with pre made cream cheese frosting because I was in a hurry.  Cut into little triangles they were gobbled up in a flash!

Awesome blondies! They were so moist, and were perfect little bite-size blondies. Perfect for little finger desserts. The icing was great, I added a tablespoon of maple syrup for flavor in the icing. Very yummy! They got snatched up quickly.

These were moist and delicious and easy to make.  I served them at my annual dessert buffet and several people said it was their favorite item. I added autumn leaf sprinkles to make them more festive.

These were very good.  Didn't give it 5 stars because I thought they would have more of a brownie consistancy, but were more cake-like.  Delicious though!  Even better the second day, gave the flavors time to meld.

Made a double recipe to use up some pumpkin. They were a big hit and definitely didn't last long! The icing was a little runny, so I added a bit more sugar.

Not the best pumpkin dessert I've tried.  I made it for a birthday party and wound up not taking it because I just wasn't that happy with them.

This was really easy to make!  I remember eating these as a kid at fall festivals and was excited to find this on the site. I think I went a little overboard on the pumpkin and put a whole can instead of just one cup!  Next time I will follow the directions!

Really yummy with a great pumpkin taste - they were actually better the next day after the flavors had melded.  The frosting was delicious as well! I made these in a 13" X 9" pan, but they should really be made on a baking sheet (size stipulated in recipe).  Enjoy!

Yum! I cut the recipe to 24 servings and baked in a loaf pan. Also, I used whole wheat pastry flour. I decided to forego the icing. One of my seven year old friends suggested I drizzle honey on the finished (and still warm) bars. That was a fantastic idea. Thanks for this recipe!

I've made these for years, and they always turn out great, though are more cake-like than a brownie consistency.  This year, I made them in cupcake sizes, instead of in a big cake pan - and they were perfect.

These were very yummy (although cakey, like other reviewers have noted).  My only gripes: the blondie wasn't nearly spicy enough (needs some nutmeg or ginger), and the maple icing was too strong for the blondie.  I felt that the icing, as sweet and maple-y as it was, overpowered the mild taste of the blondie (it tasted basically like the frosting on a maple bar donut).  However, they were still very moist and tasty and worth making.

This is more like cake than bars (blondies are white chocolate brownies, which these are not). The original cake recipe is worth 5 stars. When I made it the second time, I added nutmeg and ginger, and half again the amount of pumpkin. I'd strongly recommend adding more cream cheese to the icing. I used two packages (16 oz total, NOT 6 oz as in the recipe), and added 1 tsp vanilla. Fiance ate them all up and demanded more!

These were not bad, I gave a lot of them away to friends and they seemed to like them.  It was a good way to use the rest of the pumpkin mix I had leftover from another recipe.

These did turn out very moist and cakey, but I expected that because I had read the other reviews.  I did not have cream cheese to make the icing, so I made a glaze instead.  I used 1 cup powdered sugar, 1 tablespoon of milk, and 1/2 tsp. of vanilla.  I mixed these together, and then added some maple syrup.  Then, I drizzled the "cake" before I cut it into bars.  Everyone loved them!  I am only giving it 4 stars, since I didn't try making the recipe with the icing.

These are so yummy! And not that bad for you either. I made them on a cookie sheet to stretch the number of servings. I cut them in triangles too. Only brought home 8 pieces I think. It is more of a cakey bar but every blondie Ive ever had has been that way. I loved them!

These were good but not great.  Mine came out a little dry and flour-y tasting - not really the brownie texture I was hoping for.  The icing was good but a little thin.  If I make these again, I will definitely increase the amount of spices.

These were really tasty, but were kind of cakey which was still good, but not what the name implies. I read the reviews before i made them and saw some people say they were cakey so i decided to try and make a couple of changes. First, I reduced the baking powder slightly and second I beat everything by hand. They still came out cakey, maybe slightly less than the others, I don't know, but still cakey. That said, they were VERY DELICIOUS. Next time I make them I may add a little more cinnamon or maybe some ginger. They could have been just a touch more spicey for my liking, but they were still good. I also baked them in a 13x9 glass pan because it is all that I had. As a result I needed to bake them for almost twice as long as the suggested time. They still came out moist though. Anyhow, I would recommend this recipe and only gave it 4 stars because of the cakiness. I was looking for something more brownie like.

This was awesome, and easy to make.  The icing and the cake together are so great!  My brother couldn't stop eating them. LOL!  I wasn't sure about the maple flavoring, but it is the perfect complement to the pumpkin.  I will definitely be making them again.

Turned out very yummy!  My daughter loved them, and so did the neighbors.  I didn't use jelly roll pan, so mine turned out more like a pumpkin cake with cream cheese frosting, which I like better.

Very good!  My husband, who does not like pumpkin, even enjoyed these.  I liked the maple cream cheese frosting.  I thought it went well.  (So did my three year old daughter who just licked it off and asked for more.)  It's a great way to sneak in some vitamins!

I made these for a Thanksgiving dessert and now I'm scrambling to find something else to make!  They were OK, but nothing spectacular.  I think the cake part was good, but I definitely need to find a different frosting for them.  With a good frosting I think I'd give them a better rating!
