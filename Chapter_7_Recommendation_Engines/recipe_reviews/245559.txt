I made this new twist on boring mashed potatoes for our Thanksgiving. Everyone seemed to enjoy. And I LOVED it!!! So creamy and flavorful with extra nutrition from the acorn squash, the kids didn’t even know lol. I will definitely be making this dish again and again, throughout the whole year. Only change I did, was added more potatoes than suggested and I used golden potatoes not white. Super yummy!!!!!!

This is very good! I used less potatoes because it was only me eating it, but the flavor was great. A wonderful fall dish and I may do them next year for thanksgiving!

Seems I only review things when I love them - and we all loved this! Made exactly to recipe. Found the squash to be just under 1/2 the mix - recipe was very light and fluffy and flavourful. Was thinking I may decrease the mustard slightly and increase the dill - but it's ALL gone. Also of note, light in the stomach rather than a heavy potato starch. This is my new favourite use of acorn squash. Thank you!

This was a fun, autumn spin on a traditional classic. I didn’t alter the recipe at all and I’m happy with the end result. Super delicious!
