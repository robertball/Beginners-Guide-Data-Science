I made this as a Valentine treat for the husband. Yikes is it SWEET! I left out about 1/4 cup of the sugar and it is still super sweet. If I make it again I might leave out a little more, maybe make it with 1.5 cups instead of the 2 called for...I mean you have DP, marshmallows, and that gooey sugary coating...I doubt the 1/2 cup of sugar will be missed!

I got a request for Dr. Pepper cake.  This recipe sounded pretty good so I gave it a try.  The cake was sweet and moist.  Everyone liked it and there were no leftovers.

I added 1 1/2 tsp. cinnamon to the cake batter as  per a similar recipe.  Tasted like a moist chocolate cake - could not taste the Dr. Pepper in it.  I used a chocolate glaze since I cannot eat peanut butter. Good cake, but don't expect any Dr. Pepper flavor.

I'm always amazed by people who come on and change the recipe and then gripe that the recipe didn't taste like it was supposed to.  

I made this exactly the way it says, and it was great. With 2 teen aged sons and all of their friends coming through the house it did not last 4 hours.  I'm going to have to make 2 of them next time

This was my first attempt at baking a cake from scratch and it was goooood. I used Denton Dr. Pepper, and instead of marshmallows, I used chocolate chips. I also used a chocolate icing instead of the peanut butter. I will make again. (And again!)

Good. Doesn't taste like Dr. Pepper but is a good chocolate/peanut butter cake just the same. I followed the recipe exactly and it was very moist. However, the next day the icing wasn't nearly as good. I will only  make this again if I can serve it immediately after making it.

Very easy to make but it is very sweet and rich.  My 10yo son made this and entered it into our county fair.  He won first place so we think it is a winning recipe.  Next time we will either use less sugar or leave out the marshmallows.

The cake was pretty good.  The frosting was my favorite part.  As per other reviewers that had said it was overly sweet, I used half the amount of sugar in the cake, and it turned out great.

The cake was pretty good. I made it for my roommate's birthday since she is in love with everything Dr. Pepper. Next time, I would find another frosting instead of the peanut butter. It was very thick. Not bad, but you definitely wanted to drink some milk afterward.

The buttermilk in this recipe definitely made it moist.  I was afraid it wouldn't be.  The peanut butter topping was delicious!  This would be a treat if you weren't counting calories!  Totally would make again!

I hear this came out pretty good. I personally, not being a fan of the chocolate/peanut butter combo, did not try it. But it was a hit with the group.

This cake is amazing. Even my cake-picky family raved about it. Being a sugar-challenged family, I made several changes to make it more glycemic-friendly. I cut out the white sugar and replaced it with 1 cup crystalized cane syrup and 1/2 cup Splenda. I also used Dr. Pepper 10. To help bring out the Dr. Pepper flavor, I used 1/2 tsp of Almond emulsion in place of the vanilla. To cut down on some calories, I used plain applesauce in place of the buttermilk. The cake was very moist without the buttermilk.

In the frosting, instead of brown sugar, I used 1/2 cup crystalized cane syrup and 1 TB molasses. I also used natural peanut butter. This can have a gritty texture, so you may need to add an extra splash of milk. I recommend setting the peanut butter out at the very beginning so it is easier to mix the oil back in the peanut butter.

This was very good. I did everything as written, only I used about 1/4 cup less white sugar. I also left out the peanuts because I did not have any. It was great! The chewy marshmallows gave it a great texture. Thanks!

The only thing I have to say about this cake is: it's sweet. I made this cake to taste the  marshmallow version of southern cola cakes. It had no Dr.Pepper taste,and the peanut topping is just weird. But, the boys ate it with no complaints.

I would leave this one in the oven for about 45 minutes instead of 35. Mine ended up not being cooked all the way in the middle and it was hard to tell before I put the peanut butter topping on because of the marshmallows. Otherwise the cake was pretty good.
