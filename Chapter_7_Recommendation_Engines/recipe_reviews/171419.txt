Delicious! I used it to stuff giant porabello mushrooms. I Cut the cream to only 1 cup and increased the cayenne. Very rich, but well worth it!

My family was half/half on this. It wasn't too hard to make, but the sauce flavor wasn't outstanding to me (although my brother wanted to soak it up with bread) and I actually think shrimp would have been better than crawfish (although my dad liked the crawfish). So not bad, but I wouldn't want to eat a ton of leftovers.

I used frozen crawfish left over from a crawfish boil.  This was great.  The hint of horseradish was a nice addition!  We loved it!

A little greasy but overall pretty good. My husband and I both agreed that the horseradish wasn't necessary and that the bread crumbs did not add anything to the dish. Excellent flavor combo and one I will make again with the changes I mentioned. Thanks for sharing!

This was great! I added green bell peppers and celery, and this seemed to make it over the top!!!! I did not put bread crumbs and bake either, it did not need it.  I just served over some thyme and lemon rice.
