Wow is this stuff strong! And yes, I think the name does speak for itself as the submitter states - if you want to forget your name this drink is for you! I switched the whiskey for vodka for my second one....

This was my drink of choice tonight. I scaled it down to one serving, as it was just me who wanted to try it. It's really, really sweet. Good, but sweet.
Reminds me of another drink I've tried here recently, but just a little different. If I make this again, I might add a little fresh squeezed lemon or lime juice, for just a little tang.

We tried this drink at our tailgate party and it was a huge hit.  Everyone liked it.  Some people used pineapple juice to dilute the alchol content and that tasted good as weel.  Be careful as this will sneak up on you!

I absolutely loved this drink! We made two pitchers of it & scaled the recipe up for 14 people & took it out on the lake with us. Everyone loved it! Men & Women alike. It was just the right amount of sweet & the kick at the end is delicious. I might make some of these & just keep them in the fridge for myself.   Awesome recipe! Thanks.
