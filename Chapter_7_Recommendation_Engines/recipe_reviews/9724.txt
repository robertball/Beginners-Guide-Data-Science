what we did was 2C oats 1C flour 1C cocoa powder. Just a couple mins longer on the bake time for me. Next time I might add an egg. Or even rice krispy cereal in place of some of the oats.

These bars tasted good but they were TOO greasy (and I would have used half the amount of vanilla). Quick solution: I cut the bars 10x2 (instead of making 40 bars). Then I crushed graham crackers in a large plastic ziploc bag and coated each bar individually. Then I wrapped each bar in tin foil and voila...homemade candy bars ready to eat on the run.

My husband LOVED this! I thought it was too rich but he asked me to separate the dough in half and put an extra chocolatey layer down the middle. My eldest looks forward to having these after school.

I thought this bar was really good but I think it could be better. Next time I make it I'm adding a little salt to the oatmeal mixture maybe 1/4 tsp and a little salt to the chocolate/peanut butter spread also probably 1/4 tsp. I agree with another reviewer that the vanilla could but cut in half. Also be sure to press down hard when "patting" the oatmeal mixture into the pan. Otherwise they will fall apart when you cut them. I tried the suggestion of coating with graham cracker crumbs (smashed a graham cracker in a ziplog bag then dropped a square in the bag and shook around) and it helped tremendously with the messy factor without changing the taste.

Really really really good! I didn't have any problems with crumbling I just wish the chocolate and peanut butter on top wasn't so "gooey"...if the "topping" could be a little less gooey I would have given this recipe 5 stars! Other than that though - these were GREAT! I will definitely make these again! I also think that I might try just the oatmeal cookie bar with some nuts and dried cranberries! YUM!

Although I liked this dish and it was very easy to make I probably won't make it again. I was careful not to overbake and even though I added a few minutes to the bake time the bars felt underdone. They just didn't have the texture I was looking for. Add to that they were way too sweet. (And I have a HUGE sweet tooth.) Nice try but it isn't for me.

I found these bars to be quite crumbly with the crust not sticking together enough. Good flavor however similar to a granola bar.

These were so easy and they tasted great. They did have a "stick" factor to them though.

Peanut butter chocolate chips sugary oatmeal you can't go wrong! This was great! Mine was a bit crumbley because I reduced the amount of brown sugar and corn syrup by about half. I also added about 1/2 cup ground flax seed for SOME nutrition. I added about 1Tbs. of cocoa powder to the "topping". Super good!

I thought this was a great recipe - pretty much what I expected it to be. I had NO problems with crumbling or dryness. I DID pat it down really well into the pan. It was very moist. If you are looking for a sweet chocolately peanut buttery treat - this is it! Very much like a commercial chewy granola bar.
