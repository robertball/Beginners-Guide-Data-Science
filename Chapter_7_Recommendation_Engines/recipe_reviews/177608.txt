This recipe did not come out well at all. After 7 1/2 hrs I got home  and the rice and chicken had stuck to the pan basically all around the crock pot. The rice was so mushy and yes, it really did taste like stuffing. I followed the recipe exactly. Sounds delicious but it really wasn't- I wasted a lot of food.

This was an incredibly easy meal.  I sliced and steamed about 4 carrots (approx. 2 cups), and thawed 1 cup each of frozen corn and frozen peas.  I added these for the last hour on high.  It was a complete casserole meal with a nice thick consistency.  The whole family loved it, young kids too!  This is a keeper - I will definitely make this again.

This recipe was excellent.  Husband and kids loved it! I didn't change a thing.  The rice tastes just like stuffing when its done.

I really like this recipe!! I did make one change, and that is that I don't put the rice in with the chicken mixture. I cook the rice separate and then pull apart some of the chicken, and then put the mixture over the rice. Then I can make as little, or as much rice as I need or want!! This recipe is awsome!! My husband even likes it and he doesn't usually care for mushrooms. I make it once a week!! yummy

This chicken recipe was fantastic. I cooked it for the first time the other night. The soup was delicious and the chicken literally fell apart. It's a melt in your mouth win. I will definitely be making this again. Don't tweak it, don't fix it. It's fantastic.

I made the onion soup mix (from this site).  It is very very good without all the salt.  Used heart healthy cream of mushroom soup.  Made brown rice separately so it wasn't mushy.  Did not use any butter.  Very easy, in-expensive and quite flavorful.  Will make again for sure.

Made this for my Wife for Dinner and she absolutely raved about. I added a can of drained carrots, 2 tblsps of minced Garlic and 1 can of drained mushrooms. I couldn't find the rice so I served it over Linguini.

Would make again, but would use partially frozen chicken because the chicken came out dry. Though, the rice sauce helped. I added some frozen veggies and fresh carrott for a one dish like meal. The rice was mushy, but that was fine with me. Very easy to make.

It tasted good, but the rice was very mushy. My 3 young daughters did not like it, so they went without dinner that night.  Easy prep, just wish the rice wasn't so terribly soggy. Will try brown rice the next time I make it.

First I must say that all I had ws instant rice, so I didn't put it in to cook all day.  I added it for the last hour and well, that was way too long, I ended up with a stuffing type consistancy; but I still gve this four stars because the taste even like it was was great, I can only imagine how it will be when I make it again correctly.  Every one still ate it and all said they liked it.

The sauce and the chicken came out tasting great, however, the rice came out as hard as it was when I put it in.  It didn't cook one bit and I had it on low for almost 9 hours.  Too bad.

Delicious, I added a couple cloves of garlic and a teaspoon of cayenne pepper to spice it up a bit. Also, I only needed to cook for about 5 hours on low before mine was completely cooked and ready to eat.

i had to adapt this recipe a little to what i had on hand. i didnt have any cream soup so i used sour cream and i used an 8oz package and made up the other 12 ounces with evaporated milk, a few coarsely chopped mushrooms and i used chicken bullion and chopped red onion instead of the soup mix. i used butter instead of margarine and i used a little less parm and some shredded sharp cheddar since i didnt have a full 1/4 cup. this was very good i havent made many chicken and rice type casseroles but this is going in the rotation. we had bread and butter and a salad. comforting.

I prepared and cooked this dish as directed. I ended up with a sticky-gooey mess The rice mixture burned slightly around the edges and stuck to the sides and bottom of the pot.
  On the up side the flavor of the chicker and rice was. I am going to cut down the serving size (to save food cost) and reduce the cooking time until the rice is just tender. This is a keeper I just need to make it work.

This is a GREAT recipe and VERY versitile. I would NOT make it again with the rice. VERY MUSHY. I make it with skinless/boneless thighs, added frozen veggies, a little red onion. Next time I make it, rice will be on the side, or noodles.

Tasted good. Poor presentation. My parmesan turned to brown on top in the slow cooker. Will probably try again.

Great dish. Easy to make.  I used half the recipe (only two of us) and added chopped garlic, onions, carrots, and mushrooms. It was done in 4 hours on high. Sprinkled lemon pepper on top, yumm. My 1yr. old loved it too!

This was extremely delicious - I added sauteed mushrooms and I think it could be even better with green peppers and onions, but since my family does not like them, I did not add them - My kids even loved it!

Converted rice (also callled parboiled rice) is a MUST!!! I didnt know there was a difference when i first tried this and did it with regular rice, it turned into mush! Tonight i tried it with parboiled rice and cooked it for 5.5 hours and it turned out great!

This is delicious!  The only change I would make is that I would add more milk or soup to the mixture because it came out a bit dry after 8 1/2 hours.  Otherwise this is a great recipe!

This was good and I would make it again. 8 hours was a little long, though, and the chicken was dry. I also used brown rice instead of white and it got mushy, so I think 6-7 hours would be a more comfortable time frame. I also didn't have Parmesan cheese, so I will be definitely make sure I have that on hand next time.

This was a wonderful and easy recipe. My only suggestion is to put the rice in with a few hours to go or it can tend to get mushy.  I've made it twice in 2 weeks and will make it again very soon.  My 2 year old loved it!

This is a favorite in our house! I followed the recipe the first time and did not like the texture of the rice. So now I follow everything except I only add 1/2 cup milk instead of a cup and a half and cook the rice separately.  It's so much better this way!

This is a great recipe, but the rice does come out pretty mushy.  I like to double the recipe and serve it over pasta the first night and rice the second night.  I always add a little more parmesan than called for, a sprinkling of garlic powder and a bit of basil to spice it up a little.  It's a tasty recipe that requires very little time in the kitchen and I LOVE that.  Thanks!
