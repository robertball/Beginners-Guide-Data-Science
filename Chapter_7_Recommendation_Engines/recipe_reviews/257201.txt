I thought this was fantastic.  I did find the cook times to be long, maybe I just had thinner pork chops than the author.  2 1/2 minutes browned on both sides and 40 minutes in the oven worked for me.  This dish is SO simple and really tastes great.

This is fabulous. I had thinner pork chops, so I followed Polly's advice and shortened the times. This is easy and good enough to share with guests. Will make again soon.

Pretty awesome combination of flavors. I added a side of roasted slices of yellow and zucchini squash with a splash of Huli Huli sauce.

We love this!! It is so easy and so good.  I make exactly by the recipe except I sprinkle the red pepper flakes so those that don't care for the heavy heat just got a few, but all  the wonderful flavor. This is really nice for company as well. We will have this often as the taste is perfect. Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

Baked to 140 degrees and let the chops rest until they came up to 145. Perfect tender juicy pork chops.
