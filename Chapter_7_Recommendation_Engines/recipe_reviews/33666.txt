My husband loved this dish.  It was very easy.  Next time, I won't boil the Broccoli Rabe for the whole 12 minutes.  It seemed to get a little soggy.  Next time I will only boil for 8 minutes.

This was excellent.  I made only a few changes to turn it into a pasta dish, and it was the best supper we've had recently.  I cooked radiatore pasta in salted water, saved the water for cooking the broccoli rabe, and set the pasta aside.  I used hot ground Italian sausage and added a few teaspoons of fennel seed.  I followed the rest of the directions as written and tossed the broccoli rabe and sausage with the pasta right before serving.  My whole family raved, from my husband down to my 2-year-old son.  Yum!

I modified this recipe to:  rough chopped rabini stems and cooked for 6 minutes seperately from the green leafy part.  I then  rough chopped the green leafy part and blached in hot water.  I thoroughly drained the rabini before adding into oil mixture.  The result was a better looking dish.

You only need to blanch the Rabe for 2 minutes in salted water .  Plunge in cold water and drain and squeeze most of the water out befor adding to skillit. The Rabe will not be mushy or watery when you do this

One more thing-broccoli rabe shrinks like crazy so you may want to double or triple the amount.  If you have good eaters figure one bunch of cooked rabe per person, trust me it shrinks to nothing.

With two bunches of rabe and although only boiled  for 8 minutes still a mushy mess.  Good flavor although chard or kale would probably hold up better. Will try again with no boiling but sauteing instead.

This was a great recipe idea. I too served it with pasta, long fusilli. I reserved all of the broccoli liquid(3 bunches) and served it at the end in a bowl with the pasta because the first time i made it i thought it was too dry when using pasta. I then topped it with toasted bread crumbs. I added 5 anchovies along with the garlic to give it even more flavor. I omitted the lemon from the pan and served lemon wedges on the table for my family to use as much or as little as they wanted.

The recipe is good. The flavour is excellent...but I live in Mexico and we dont have lemon so I always use lime. The next time i will defintely cut the amount of lemon in half. Also had to use chorizo for the sausage, which turned out excellent. I served over bowtie pasta. even the kids liked it...but definitely have to cut the lemon in half

Great flavor, but a little too watery.  My spouse thought that the rabe was "mushy" like cooked spinach and didn't care for the texture.  I would perhaps try just boiling to al dente, chop up the broccoli rabe before sauteeing, and add 1/2 the water and see how that goes.  The lemon was a nice touch.

A good way to use up broccoli rabe and other greens. I added a bunch of kale and a pinch of red pepper flakes, and used spicy Italian sausage. This was a tasty and nourishing dinner and would be great over brown rice.

I made a variation of ths.  I never boil broccoli rabe.  First I cook the sausage.  Then I put the broccoli rabe in the skillet with a quarter to half cup of water cover and cook until it reduces -- around 5 minutes.  Thanks ELEANOR1052.

This is a quick and easy dish, and can be healthy too. I steamed the broccoli rabe for 5 minutes (in two batches) and then cooked it with chicken sausage. I added a little organic low-sodium chicken broth to the frying pan instead of water. I also added a little minced onion for extra flavor. My husband and I absolutely loved it! This recipe is a keeper. Thanks!

I loved this recipe.  I only gave it 4 stars because I only cooked the broccoli rabe for a minute or 2.  It only needed to be cooked that much because you cook it again mixed ith the other ingredients.

This is our new favorite sausage recipe. It's so quick and easy. I use a teaspoon of oil to cook the sausage in, and then cook the broccoli in the sausage drippings. Garlic powder instead of cloves makes it even quicker, and there's no need for additional salt, as sausage is already pretty salty.

This is a great meal when dieting!  Instead of boiling in water I simmer broccoli rabe in low sodium beef broth with some garlic cloves.  This enhances flavor

It was horrible!  Too many cloves of garlic and too much lemon juice. And the amount of time to boil the brocolli is too long.  It made the brocolli soggy.

Thought I made this up. Bought one bunch of broccoli rabe and had chicken apple sausage in the fridge. Sautéed the broccoli rabe in olive oil and garlic until it drooped. Removed and put in a bowl. Sautéed the chicken apple sausage with a splash of apple cider and apple cider vinegar until done and baked the combo in the oven at 350 for about 25 minutes. No salt, no anything because of health issues in my house. Will make it again.
