Bravo Ivan! Words are inadequate to describe how much hubby and I enjoyed your pasta e fagioli tonight! I took just a little liberty with the recipe, using fresh minced garlic, tomato sauce from my garden, a "glug" of a good red wine, and fresh parsley. I used the amount of herbs as the recipe directed, even though I thought it might be too much, but it all came together perfectly. Topped this with a little shredded mozarella and served it with garlic bread. This Italian gal cleaned her bowl! As for hubby?  The first words out of his mouth (filled with pasta e fagioli) were, "Make this again!"

I have had this recipe many times. Made the first time I had it, and quite a few times after that by Chez Ivano (Ivan O.Teeter) himself. Ivan was my father-in-law. Unfortunately Ivan passed away just over two years ago.  
He had many recipe's. This one was among  his favorites. Most people who have had it agree it is an excellent Italian soup. We have served Pasta e Fagioli a la Chez Ivano (he really liked that name) numerous times to guests, and they always ask for the recipe before they leave. 
People will try variations to satisfy there own tastes but the basis of this recipe remains Ivan's. 
Perhaps one day I will get his recipe book out and share more with you. 
There is a recipe for S.O.S. that I'm sure most who have been in the military would appreciate.

YUMMY!  This is a wonderfully flavourful soup that fills your house with the scent of a fine Italian restaurant!  I have cooked this both the regular way and by slow cooker, and have had great success for both.  For slow-cooker fans:  scramble-fry ground beef, then add all ingredients to crock-pot except for kidney beans and pasta.  Cook for 4-6 hours on high (or 8-10 on low, your preference).  Add the kidney beans and pasta during the last 15 minutes of cooking.  If you intend to keep/freeze leftovers, cook the pasta separately and add it to each soup bowl... this will prevent liquid absorption and smushy pasta.  I found that macaroni also works well if you can't find ditalini in your grocery store. I reduced the amount of garlic to 5-6 large cloves, minced (for a 10-serving recipe), and we did not lack for garlic flavour! Thanks so much for a first-class recipe, Ivan!

This is an excellent recipe.  I did somethings differently just to add my own personal touch.  Cook the pasta separately because it gets mushy the longer it sits in the pot.  Abbi

I made this soup in honour of the Opening Ceremony for the 2006 Olympics in Torino...and i have to tell you, this recipe is absolutely amazing!  The only change i made was to add about 1/2 can of navy beans - like Olive Garden's. I halfed the recipe to 10 servings and it turned out perfectly.
I would suggest making the Pesto Bread Rounds recipe off of allrecipes to go with the soup...YUM!!

I was watching the news the other day and a story came on about a couple who had been married for 82 years. The 105 year old husband said one of the things he appreciated about her was that she prepared dinners for him — including his beloved pasta e fagioli. LOL I thought if pasta e fagioli could keep a couple together for 82 years I'd better try it too! ;) 

This recipe was good. Better the next day for sure, but I think I'd use regular beef broth next time as the flavor was quite a bit too strong for our tastes. The main idea was good tho. I halved the recipe, add julliened carrot (1 cup for the half recipe), fresh garlic (4 large cloves for the half recipe) and fresh parsley (didn't have dried). The rest I followed exactly.

PS Serve with garlic or cheese bread and an italian salad.

Okay, I've never had this before, I loved it!  I did add fresh mushrooms and zucchini, , and after saute'ing the veggies and ground beef,  put it in a crock pot on low for a couple hours, till we got home, and OMG, will be making this all the time.  I did keep the pasta separate.

I cut the recipe in half for 10 servings, but next time will do it for 20 servings.  It is delicious! I'll be making this Pasta e Fagioli recipe from now on. I served it with a salad and crusty Italian bread.  A big hit with my husband who said it was definitely a "Keeper".

Made this recipe and thought it tasted good but a little too much celery for me on the first day. Then we had some the next day and the celery taste disappeared and it was even more delicious! The third day heated up it was The Bomb!!!!!It got better and better each day!

Excellent soup!  I have made versions of this soup before but this is the best - very hearty..I served with bread.  Since there are only 2 of us I halfed the entire recipe which still allowed for several bowls for each of us and a container for my parents! Only tweak I made was using fresh garlic (6 cloves minced) instead of jarred.  Thanks!

I thought Olive Garden was the best. You are not going to get a better recipe than this. 1-10 scoring this is a 25  Don't try to be Emerill and tweak this recipe. Cook as stated.

This soup rates up there with those we've had at fancy Italian restaurants. Followed the directions exactly and the only thing I modified from the ingredient list was elbow macaroni instead of ditalini pasta (what I had on hand). Half the recipe made more than plenty for the 2 of us for several meals. Leftovers are even BETTER the next day! Absolutely loved this delicious soup! It will definitely be one of my "go-to" meals. Thank you for this keeper of a recipe. :)

Very good. I didn't notice until too late that it takes 3 hours. I didn't have time to simmer broth for 1 hour. It was still good. I thought 2 jars of garlic would be too much so I used less. I only used 2 cans of reduced sodium beef broth & the rest water with beef bouillon cubes. I make the pasta separately & pour over. Thanks!

I teach this recipe over and over to children who live in foster group homes.  I tell them that they are like the ingredients in the soup.  The pot comes to life and full flavor when everything is put together!  This soup is also a favorite in my own house.

I lost my favorite Pasta e Fagioli recipe and found this to be closest to what I remember mine to be.  My only variations are to use fresh garlic and to use Great Northern beans instead of the kidney beans.  I also add the pasta at the end so it doesn't absorb too much liquid.  This also freezes well as long as you keep the pasta separate; otherwise it gets mushy.

Super fabulous Italian soup recipe! We LOVED it! Wouldn't change a thing! I cooked ground turkey over the stove with diced onions, celery, garlic, and pepper. I added above mixture to the crock pot with beef broth, crushed tomatoes, paste, and herbs for about 5 hours on high. I then added beans the last 15 minutes, while the elbow pasta cooked. Added pasta to bowls then pored soup on top with grated parm cheese. Served with home made french bread.

Made this last evening. 'Twas a gastronomic delight! I scaled it down for eight servings and followed the recipe as is written. I had to make two changes. I only had about a third of a jar left of the minced garlic, so added 4 cloves of fresh (minced/chopped by me). Forgot to get the ditalini pasta at the store, so used elbow mac. Per other reviewers advice, I also cooked the mac seperately and added to bowls upon serving. I served fresh French bread and parm on the side. Husband had two helpings and finally commented, "this is scrumptious" (not a word he uses often). I told him I was going to use his praise in my review and he said that was fine because he means it! It has a rich, deep flavor to it that I haven't found in other pasta e fagiolis I've eaten. So, at the end of the meal we decided that this is a "keeper". Thank you for submitting it.

Definitely 5 stars!  I did the crockpot method for this.  I browned drained the beef (used very lean beef and 1/2 ground turkey for the meat) and added to the crockpot.  I then sautee'd the veggies and added that.  I used a 6 quart crockpot and could only fit in about 96 ounces of beef stock.  I added about 10 cloves of garlic and added some garlic powder and crushed red pepper to the seasonings.  I cooked the pasta separately and added to the individual bowls for serving.  My kids and I LOVED it!  My kids are 4 and 6 and both cleaned their bowls.  I also added 8 ounces of fresh mushrooms to the last 3-4 hours of cooking time.  Will definitely make again.

great flavor! I omitted the ground beef and used vegetable broth instead of the beef broth. Pasta e fagioli means 'beans and pasta' and when cooked traditionally should not include any meat.

This was to die for! I did make a few minor changes though. I cooked it in a crock pot which made it super easy. I used ground turkey and italian sausage and just browned it with 4 cloves of galirc and the onion.  Then I just threw everything into the crock pot excpet for the pasta and beans.  I let it cook on low for about 8 hours and then added the cooked pasta and beans just before serving.

WE loved this so much I'm just sorry I waited so long to try it.  Made it just as read but on a smaller scale and with just a bit less garlic.  It was a little time consuming to prepare but judging from how quickly it all disappeared, well worth every minute.  Adding the pasta and beans for the last 20 minutes or so was a good idea, they stayed more "al dente" that way and the flavour was really very good. I would even consider cooking the pasta separately from the sauce next time...and I will be making a much bigger pot next time to freeze some.

I always saddens me when I need to add salt and hot sauce to a dish upon serving it, but this was just too bland. I had a hard time coming to terms w/ the ho-hum-ness of this soup, b/c the aroma wafting through my house as it simmered was remarkably pungent and drool-inspiring. I followed the recipe exactly, w/ th exception of halving it, and using fresh herbs (and lots of them) and fresh garlic (7 cloves), so I don't know if my superhero ability just happens to be a heightened sense of taste b/c I was just a bit disappointed w/ the lack of BLAMO flavor. There are leftovers, so I intend to re-simmer the soup w/ additional spices to give it more oomph. All in all, a hearty soup (and great served w/ a green salad and crusty bread) w/ loads of potential.

I use a few slight variations but otherwise I pretty much follow this recipe for my pasta e fagioli. First variation is, I use 3 different meats; ground beef, italian sausage, and Prosciutto. I also use cannelini beans in addition to kidney beans.  I also add peeled baby carrots and diced zuccini when sauteing the celery, onions and garlic.  I also use chicken broth instead of beef broth (I never tried beef broth but the chicken broth always worked well for me).  The 3 meats make this soup pasta e fagiolicious. Soup so good that all who eat it beg for the recipe.  I'm making it this coming Sunday and my wife and I can't wait.

Very good. We were looking for Pasta e Fagioli as great as served by a small ‘mom & pop’ Italian restaurant where we once lived but this didn’t quite match that exemplary standard. Will make this again but with some modifications aimed at trying to recreate the one we loved.

This was a really good dish that my kids LOVED!  They all requested the leftovers for lunch the next day.  
Instead of a jar of minced garlic, I finely minced 8 cloves (I could have done more).
I would love to try this dish with fresh herbs instead of dried.

Meh.  I had such high hopes after reading all the rave reviews, but this soup had no flavor until I added bouillon, a cup of red wine, more fresh garlic and garlic powder, more herbs and some salsa, but something was still missing.  Luckily, parmesan helps anything taste better, so my family got through it.

I think that the only problem with this soup is the lack of salt. On the second day when I reheated it, I added a fair (1 tsp.) of salt and topped with grated parm. I served with a salad and Italian bread. Very good!

Good, but the thyme was strongly overpowering and overall I found it a bit bland.  I am also used to the pasta fagioli popular in CT which is usually cannellini beans, and whole tomatoes (sparingly) instead of paste & crushed, so it's not quite so tomatoe-y.  But since this is Ivano's version of fagioli, I let that pass. ;)

WONDERFUL! I added carrots to the stew. It made a TON of food, so we have plenty frozen for future meals. I used ground beef and italian sausage. I also used one whole head of garlic, chopped very tiny, instead of the jarred garlic. DELICIOUS!

I thought this was very tasty! I cut the servings down to 4 and it still made a ton. Also mine turned out to be much thicker than a soup. Almost like an Italian pasta stew. It was still very tasty and we had leftovers the next day and it was great. I'd make this again.

Tastes like spaghetti sauce, good spaghetti sauce.  I like the huge amount of garlic, but the rule regarding garlic around here is, "Never enough."  If I make it again, I will probably add some more veggies like peppers and mushrooms.  It will almost certainly become another good spaghetti soup.

OMG!  The best soup I think I have ever had....and I am not exaggerating..  Even my 13 yr old son who HATES soup loved it!!!  All of my kids said it tastes like speghetti but in soup form!  Will definately be making this again and again and again!!!

I followed this recipe to a T except I used fresh garlic and tomato sauce instead of crushed tomatoes.  Oh, and I seperated the pasta from the soup and just add it as we heat it up.

I made this to have on hand for lunches over the Thanksgiving weekend.  I made half of this recipe and used only 1 T. of oil and 5 cloves of fresh garlic, rather than the jarred garlic.  I was hesitant about the amount of dried seasonings, so I cut back and used 1 t. each, thyme, basil and oregano.  I used the full amount (1 T.) of dried parsley.  Toward the end of the one hour cooking time, I did add two smallish chopped zucchini that I had on hand.  Once I added the beans, they were barely noticeable, so I put in a second can.  I didn’t add the ditalini pasta because some of our guests were watching their carbs, however I have every intention of adding the pasta to the few leftovers that are waiting in the freezer.  This was an excellent Pasta e Fagioli and I will definitely make it again!

Delicious~makes so much soup that I thought I was gonna need a bigger pot.  Was a bit timid with the garlic so I used about half of what the recipe called for.  Next time I will use the entire amount. Will definitely make again.

I halved the recipe and used 32 oz beef broth and 14 oz veg broth and only 1 lb. beef.  Used 3/4 can of crushed tomatoes (28 oz can).  Used only about 1/4 teas thyme and added a dash of red pepper flakes and a dash of sugar, along with all the rest of the spices recommended.  Cooked the beef, onion, celery, and 3 teas garlic until beef was no longer pink.  Drained, then added everything else and simmered 45 min.  Added pasta and beans and cooked 15 more minutes.  Topped with parmesan... better than any other pasta fagioli I've ever tasted

Fantastic! I scaled the recipe down to half. I forgot to add celery but didn't even miss.  I cooked the pasta seperately till al dente and threw it in at the end.  I ended up using more beef broth than required but I was looking more for a soupy result.  So good!!! Will make again.  Was skeptical on adding a whole jar of garlic but glad I did.  Definitely a keeper!

I've avoided this recipe for years because I hate pasta in soup, but the recent photo by TTV78 caused me to add this soup to my list, and I'm glad I did! It looks like a soup my mother made, and after making it, it tastes quite a bit like it as well. I used orzo so that squishy noodles wouldn't be bothersome to us. I think my mother might've also used red wine or red wine vinegar in some fashion -- I think that's the missing flavor, and possibly also a shredded carrot. We liked this a lot, served with crusty rolls and a handful of grated Parmesan on top. Thanks for the recipe!

I love this. Did in crock pot. Changed a bit. Threw in chopped carrot and green pepper. Added in addition to ground beef a half pound each hot and sweet italian sausage had left over from something else. Put in cup of red wine. Also 2 pinches red pepper flakes and 1/2 tsp white pepper. Still was not too spicy.  Two heads fresh garlic. OMG smells so good. Make fresh bread and you are in heaven. I would love to see some more of Ivan's recipes.

Hmmm. This was just "OK" for me, although my fiance liked this a LOT!!! I found my soup to be terribly bland. It's probably just me though, lol. :-) I must say, this recipe is not only versatile (add or remove any items you see fit), but also economical AND easy to prepare (just allow plenty of time for it). To speed preparation even further, I used my mini food chopper/processor to chop my onions - and thank goodness I did (WOW, did my eyes water!!!)!!!!! Since I halved the recipe, I only ended up using 3 large celery stalks. I decreased the amount of meat (I used a 1.10 lb. package of good 'ol ground chuck, drained/rinsed thoroughly) by nearly a half pound. Oh, and I added a bit of the "juice" from my jar of bottled garlic since Ivan didn't specify otherwise.... I am confused by the multitude of comments that speak of using (or not using) beef consomme. It is not one of the ingredients of this soup! Perhaps Ivan made an ingredient change after the fact and then reposted his recipe??? Anyways, I thought this was good, but am certainly not jumping out of my seat to make it again. I prefer Andrea's pasta fagioli (but my fiance thinks I have bad taste in general hahaha!). If I make this again, it will certainly be for him, not me (sans the beans - he felt they added nothing to the soup). Served with warm French bread to sop up the broth, this was a hearty meal. Thanks for sharing, Ivan! I'm sure your FIL has many excellent recipes that you can share with us! :-)

I can't believe I haven't rated this recipe yet!  I've made this for the family a couple times and it is wonderful!  Even my picky eaters eat it up!  I don't mess with the recipe at all, it is perfect exactly as written.  Top it with fresh mozzarella cheese on a cool fall evening and it is out of this world!  Oh yeah, I usually serve it with the parmesan knots from this site, they go great together!

GREAT soup! I kept the pasta separate and added it as I warmed up bowlfuls. I also added some italian green beans and some zucchini just to get more veggies in. I will make this soup many, many more times. In fact, I've got some cooking right now!

Wonderful recipe!  Very flavorful!  I substituted some beef boullion, water, and tomato sauce for half of the consomme to save a little money and use ingredients on hand and still tasted great.  Can cut back on garlic and still have plenty of flavor.  We will be making this often.

I first made this recipe about 4 years ago, as I noticed that my brother was always ordering pasta e fagioli at restaurants whenever possible.  This is a wonderful recipe...it becomes part of the dinner rotation especially during the winter.  I halve the recipe, but I usually use the whole can of tomato paste and crushed tomatoes anyway.  In a pinch, I've substituted Italian seasoning for the spices.  We love it!

Good recipe.  I was in a hurry and modified it slightly we could eat within an hour.  After I cooked the onions and celery in garlic, I put them in a large pot and added the rest of the ingredients except the kidney beans and pasta. I also used 1/2 italian sausage instead of all hamburger.  Worked well.  Thanks

Outstanding!  As good or better than I've had in a popular italian restaurant chain.  I made a few changes according to the ingredients I did or didn't have on hand and also cooked the pasta separately so leftovers woudn't be mushy. Ate for dinner last night with garlic cheese bread and the whole family raved.  Had it again for lunch today and it was just as good if not better.  Definitely a recipe I will make again, and again!  Thanks for sharing Ivan!

Super tasty and easy to make. I stayed very true to the recipe (which is odd for me) and was very pleased with the results. Next time I may add some cannellini beans but that's about it. Will definitely make again.

I halved the recipe it made alot. It was ok, next day it turned more into a chili, all of the liquid soaked up so that was kinda bothersome.

This was the first recipe that popped up for Pasta E Fagioli on the website and when I read the ingredients I knew it was the perfect recipe for what I wanted to make on this Fall Sunday afternoon.  This was also my first attempt at Pasta E Fagioli.  I followed the recipe exactly although 8 quarts is a bit much for the three of us!  It was absolutely delicious and exceeded my expectations.  My son had seconds and thirds.  The flavor, texture and presentation was that of a high quality restaurant.  This is a definite keeper and I highly recommend it for a wonderful hearty family meal.

I have made this 3 times.  I did half the garlic because my husband preferred it that way.  Let me say that this soup is so very good!!  I am making it this weekend but I am keeping the pasta separate.  When the leftovers go in the fridge the pasta gets too mushy.

This is excellent! I halved it; and it still made a ton! The only changes I made was to add more spices. I never measure my spices; always spice to taste. I also used fresh garlic. I don't think it is necessary to cook the pasta with the soup. I also cooked it separately like some other reviewers. I added the pasta and beef in with the soup about 30 minutes in. Perfect!!

My husband and I really enjoyed this!  Easy to make and very flavorful.  I halved the recipe  - didn't have enough beef stock so I used some chicken broth.  Used one can of kidney beans and one can of navy beans.  Delicious!

This soup is amazing! I will definitely make it again and again. I only used 8oz of garlic because that's what I had, and I don't eat kidney beans so I used a can of pintos and a can of great northerns. I think you could play around with different beans if you wanted to! And I added some extra beef broth, just cause I wanted a little more. But I kept it very close to the original recipe - no need to mess with what works! Absolutely delicious and I cannot wait to make it again!

This recipe was a hit with my family. Especially my husband, he loves soups. It made a huge amount but not a drop went to waste. We ate it for 3 days, & each day the taste was better. So flavorful, very hearty. I will definitely make this again. During hunting season I always make food for my hubby to bring to camp to share with the other guys. This will be the perfect, cold weather meal for them to chow on after a long day in the woods. Thank you!

Delicious!  It's only my husband and I, so I haved the recipe (still used all the tomato paste and crushed tomato-or the half a cans would have just sat in the fridge...).  A little scared with so much garlic-but we both loved it.  I will make again.

I cut the recipe in half.    Used homemade beef broth and added a bit more onion and used crushed garlic.  This turned out to be a very tasty meal that we all enjoyed.  Tasted better the next day, as most soups do.  Had plenty of leftovers to freeze for a quick meal when in a rush.  Thanks for sharing, Ivan O. Teeter.

My wife LOVED this recipe - "it's one of the best things you've made" (and I make a LOT!).  It is hearty, filling and the perfect balance.  One thing I found was I had to add salt - about 1 tsp for 7 servings.  This may have been because the broth I used was reduced sodium but there was definitely 'something missing'.  I salted a small tasting portion and my wife confirmed,  "That's it!".  The recipe wasn't specific but I used cannelini beans - white kidney beans.  It might be fun to mix in a can of red.  I will absolutely make this again - remembering the diatlini and to measure how much salt!

JOHND - love to see some more of your FIL's recipes.  This one is absolutely a WINNER!

Fantastic flavor for such simple ingredients.  I scaled the recipe down considerably, and also used some leftover carrots and peppers which I diced.  I replaced the crushed tomatoes with a can of rotel.  I will be making this again.  The ditalini is a great choice of pasta as it is delicate and doesn't overwhelm the dish.

MmmMmm, this was great! I chose this particular Pasta e Fagioli recipe because I liked that it had meat, my carnivor husband won't eat a main dish without it. And this fit the bill! I made a few minor changes- I scaled down the recipe for my husband and I; only used 1 lb of ground beef and reduced the veggies as well. I used elbow macaroni because that's what I had on hand. I used Italian seasoning instead of the individual spices listed and it worked well. I'm looking forward to having it again for lunch tomorrow :)

Fabulous!  Was looking for a recipe similar to Olive Garden's and found this to be even better!  Halved it for my family of 4 and will be eating it for dinner tomorrow night.  A big hit for adults and kids!

This one is a keeper.  I pretty much followed the recipe but I used half ground beef and half italian sausage which made it oh so good.  I also used a head of fresh garlic instead of the bottled.  Also, I didn't have enough beef broth on hand so I used half mushroom broth.  Turned out great and even better the next day.

I put garlic powder and garlic salt in the meat as it was cooking and also added shredded carrots to the mix- It was wonderful! Tastes like Olive Garden soup... but better. My husband even liked it.

I made this as written and I thought it was just okay. It didnt have enough flavor for me. I added some salt, cumin (to make it a little more like Olive Gardens'), and tomato sauce to make it a little thicker and richer. It was much better with the additions.

Very good recipe we really enjoyed it.  I would also recommend as another reviewer suggested, adding salt to your taste.  I did halve the recipe and there was plenty left over.  I will make again!

Disappointed, especially with all of the rave reviews. This soup is begging for more vegetables. The garlic rich broth is really good but the ground beef just leaves you wanting something...more? It's definitely a time consumer too. I won't be making it again, but if you are going to try it, def add some minced green pepper, mushrooms, zucchini.

Easy and quick to prepare!  I added a little hot sauce to mine.  I also added additional beef broth because I prefer mine a little soupier.

Super yummy.  I would cook the pasta separately at the end.  Add the pasta just before serving.  I also added 1 beef bouillon cube for extra flavor.

Very good flavor, I have never added the full amount of garlic and yet the flavor is excellent. Actually going to share this one with a friend. Taste like it is from a restaurant. I use half beef broth and half low sodium chichen broth.

This recipe was very good, one that I would definitely make again.  However, next time, I would cut the olive oil down to 1/4 cup as opposed to 1/2 cup because I thought that it was a bit too oily for my liking.  Also, I boiled the pasta separately and kept it separate so that everyone could add as much or as little as they liked.  I also added shaved carrots for color.  All in all, this recipe was great and went perfect with a crusty baguette!

I made this today for my Mother for lunch, and loved it so much, we're having it again for dinner.  My husband, who's not a soup fan, said it was fantastic.  I made it for 8 with 1 lb. ground beef and tinkered a little with some of the ingredients.  It was helpful to have a little extra stock on hand.  Excellant recipe!

I was really happy with how this recipe turned out. I halved the recipe and made it in the crockpot. I added Navy beans per another review and added a little more pasta (personal preference).  I also substituted ground turkey for the ground beef, and I couldn’t tell the difference. My husband LOVED this, and I will definitely be making it again.

This is the absolute best! Decided to make this as an add-on for a party. It was cold outside. Put the big pot on the buffet table with styro bowls and spoons. They all but licked the pot. Prefer fresh garlic ~ used 1 and a 1/3 BULBS of garlic and grated it. Agreed with another viewer and cooked the pasta separate al dente (I used ditallini). Put the pasta in only 1 minite before serving. Yumola! Great reviews from my guests also. Thanks for sharing.

Absolutely awesome!  Made according to directions and wouldn't change a thing.  The leftovers do get very thick when refrigerated -- I attribute this to the gelatin in the consomme.  May try it with beef broth next time.

I just had Pasa e Fagioli at the Olive Garden and HAD to duplicate it at home.  I halved this recipe, but used even less hamburger (1/2 lb.).  Added one or two carrots, chopped and sauteed with onion.  I didn't simmer it for an hour nor did I bother with the simmer time in between hamburger/beans/pasta.  Just threw it all in there and it was delicious!

I have not made this version of Pasta e Fagioli b/c I have my own version but to Kat6678 or anyone looking for the ditalini pasta I have only found it one time but at Albertson's in Texas I have found one of their products called salad macaroni that looks exactly like ditalini pasta in size and taste.  I usually get several bags of it and put in the freezer for future use.

Totally fabulous! I cooked the hamburger and then put it all in the crock pot keeping the pasta and beans separate until serving. THE BEST! Hubby and 2 year old daughter ate it up and raved! Thanks for such a great soup recipe!

This was a great meal!  I scaled it to 10 servings and it made a LOT.  I didn't have the separate spices so I used Italian seasoning (1TBS) and I'll use more next time.  I also used crushed tomatoes with Italian seasoning in them.  I cooked the pasta separate so I can freeze the leftover soup. Served with toasted whole grain bread.

This is a wonderful recipe. We cut back on the beans- just a personal preference, added freshly ground black pepper, and served with soft bread sticks. My husband was thrilled with this recipe and my kids came back for seconds and thirds!

Absolutely delicious!  I even substituted ground turkey for the ground beef and I didn't add all the garlic as listed.  It was still full of rich Italian flavor and my Dad (who grew up eating homemade Italian meals including pasta e fagioli) ate 5 bowls of this!

This recipe was fantastic.  I used ground beef and ground sausage to give it an extra kick. (50/50)

It freezes very well.

This is a wonderful recipe. I didn't want to make as much soup as this recipe called for so I only used 1lb beef, 1 onion, a few celery stalks and 1 can of beans. I used everything else about like it was called for except for the consomme. I added a little red pepper and I cut up some fresh tomatoes to add in. I might try using Italian sausage instead of ground beef next time. My husband would highly recommend this.

I roughly halved the ingredients, except for the garlic.  I thought one jar was way too much so I used a heaping teaspoon.  Anyway, it's obviously a personal thing but there was some seasoning that I didn't like.  I'm guessing that it may have had too much thyme for our taste.

Wonderful recipe, and well worth the time it takes to cook! The only modification I made was to cut down on the ground beef- since I made 10 servings instead of twenty, I simply put in one pound instead of one and a half to avoid opening another package of beef. Didn't miss it! I'll have to try putting in navy beans next time alongside the kidney beans.

Made the recipe with minor modifications from other reviews and previous experience. I added the cooked beef along with the stock, tomatoes, and herbs. Also, I added the noodles just before serving so they didn’t get mushy. I don’t believe either modification affected the overall flavor of the soup and it was fantastic!  As others mentioned even better the next day. YUM!  Thanks for a great recipe.

This is a great base recipe, which I did tweak.  I used fresh garlic; I loooove garlic, so it had at least 2 full heads of garlic in there.  

I also found I did not have any straight thyme at home. I felt the amount of herbs called for was too much: I used a heaping tsp of basil, oregano, parsley.  I used 2 tsp of Italian seasoning, as that had the thyme I lacked along with additional oregano/basil and a few others.  

I ended up adding 1 cup of red wine.  I think this would have benefited from either using crushed red pepper flakes or some tomato-based spicy sauce, as the well known restaurant that makes this soup, there is some spice heat to it.

FYI: I did not find ditalini pasta......however in the market I found the right pasta that was called "Salad macaroni," if you are questing for this.  

As my usual, I always look for and use no salt added/reduced salt products, for those that find soups too salty, you won't miss the sodium.

Totally delicious!!!    I put the elbows into the soup too early so they were over cooked.  It did not affect the taste at all.    I have a huge crock pot and this is perfect for a family supper with bread, butter and vegie/dip platter.   I added a splash of red wine but not necessary.

To start off....I halved this recipe! 
I used half broth, half stock and used fresh garlic as other reviews suggested. I also added thinly sliced carrots and some sliced yellow winter squash. 
I felt it needed some salt because I didn’t realize that the stock I purchased had no salt added. However, I rather it need salt than have too much!
I served it with garlic toast and fresh Parmesan.
We all loved it and had some leftovers!
Definitely a good soup recipe!

I do not know any true Italian who would put meat in pasta fagoli. This was eaten during lent. Also I don’t know who uses kidney beans. Cannelloni beans are what is supposed to be used.

I made a half recipe. Reduced garlic to 3 Tbsp. but
Felt it needed more flavor. I don’t use much salt in my cooking but this recipe needed some. I’ll make it again and add some Italian herbs.

Scrumptious!! I’ve never had or heard of this soup! Simply Delicious! I made a whole recipe with Gluten free noodles to add in at the last. I used a whole clove/bunch of fresh garlic. I also added garlic salt and red pepper flakes to add salt and heat. I didn’t have celery so I used 1 t celery seed. Very good! I definitely would make again.

This is very good. I've made it a couple of times. I did reduce the garlic a bit, about half of what was called for.  The 2nd time, I was out of tom paste so I used 2/3 C leftover spaghetti sauce, which was great, also used stewed tomatoes instead of crushed. Used black beans since that was all I had. Was excellent both ways.

My family hates chunky tomatoes so I used a jar of passata tomatoes.  I found the recipe didn’t have enough beans or pasta.  I added extra.  I will also use a bay leaf next time.  I ended up tripling the amount of beans and doubling the amount of broth & pasta.  All in all a good recipe to start from and easy to add to!

In Montana we are having a heavy snowstorm.  Some people are stuck in their homes whiles others are having a difficult time getting to their destinations.  We opted to stay home this week due to terrible weather.  Fortunately for me, I found this recipe.  I’ve never made this dish before, but this dish is unbelievable.  I adjusted the recipe for 10 servings and utilized all ingredients, making no changes except my tomatoes were diced.  No problem there they were basil, oregano and garlic based.  I just crushed them up.  This is a comforting meal.

Love this soup!  Only change I made was to cut it in half and I added a diced red bell pepper.  My husband loves it.

Delicious! All my kids ate it and enjoyed it. The only thing different we did was elbow macaroni because my store didn't sell the one suggested.  Would definitely make it again. You can even freeze some since its such a large batch.

I made it per the instructions just half a batch though as there's only 2 of us in the house and it was AMAZING and so filling. Lots of leftovers that will go quickly with the cold weather we're having but would definitely consider making the whole batch and freezing! Thank you so much for sharing this gem!

This is a lengthy process but do it exactly as it says and you will have an excellent, hearty meal. I added 1/2 lb of ground beef just because I like it meatier and a teaspoon of “Better than boulion” beef flavor and it comes out great.  I have made this three times now, the first time following the recipe exactly and it was great.

Good.  If I made it again, I'd add carrots and possibly some paprika.  But it was good and went well with some homemade foccacia.

This was, at best, an Italian version of chili. After reading all the rave reviews, I was excited to make it but it needed a lot of tweaking, especially to make it a soup. I added about a cup of red cooking wine (would have been great with the real stuff but didn't have any on hand), a couple cups of chicken stock, fennel seed and some red pepper flakes. Salt. It also needed salt! My adjustments made this much more tasty but it was still lacking a zippy element. I'm sad to say I won't be making it again.

This is amazing!! Followed the recipe, but 1/2ed it.  Made it in the crock pot. Browned the meat and put everything in the pot , except the pasta, cooked on low for 8 hours.  Cooked the pasta separately and added it the bowls before serving.  My super critical husband called it "Excellent"! Perfect for the fall and winter months, or anytime you feel like soup!

I have never written a review on this site but I had  to for this pasta fagioli recipe.  It is a hearty dish and my husband loved it. The crowning glory was fresh grated Parmesan and some fresh basil on top to serve.

Halved the recipe and used  only 2 cans of broth instead of 4. Also added fresh herbs, way, way less garlic and a couple cups of water.  Didn't have kidney beans so used rinsed black beans. Yummy, yummy!!

Really delicious. Makes way too much so I’ll freeze the rest. My husband really liked it too. The only change I made was to cook the pasta separately. I’ve learned from experience that pasta can soak up all the liquid in soup making it more like a stew .  Just put the pasta in the bowl when serving the soup.

My husband doesn't like soup but he loved this and wants me to make again! Followed suggestion of not adding pasta till served. Followed close to exactly since I cut the recipe by a third. (Too much for my husband and myself.) Looking forward to making this again!

Made 1/2 of the recipe and added more of the spices than written, in the hopes of avoiding the "bland" taste that others complained about.  I, too, used 2 cans of beef broth and the rest in water and beef bouillon cubes.  It was very good, topped with mozzarella cheese and paired it with a slice of pizza for a fun Saturday night meal.

This is a great recipe!  I have tried several different versions of this soup & this one is the winner, hands down.  Following other reviewers, I added navy beans & some shredded carrots. My only reservation is the quantity - this recipe can feed the neighborhood.  Next time, I am halving the quantities.

This recipe is incredible. I've made it several times.  I NEVER thought I would like this type of soup, but I was OH SO WRONG.  The only thing I did different was to use WAYYYYY LESS garlic.  This has to be a misprint!  Garlic bread doesn't even use this much garlic!  I halved the recipe and then used only about a tablespoon or two of minced garlic.  I think it is perfect like this.  Yummy, yummy, yummy!!

AMAZING recipe.  The only substitution I made was to use hot sausage instead of the beef.  Took it out of the casing and browned it. Wouldn't change anything else about this.  Definitely one of my go-to's from now on

I followed the recipe on this one and found a new favorite. I've eaten and made many variations but this recipe hands down is my favorite. The portion size is great for 5-7 people and pairs well with garlic bread, a nice salad, sweet red wine and Sunday lunch with family and friends around the table.

Very good! Easy to make!  Everyone loved it. The next day it was more like a stew because the noodles soaked up all the liquid,but it still tasted really good

It's delicious and hearty for cold winter nights.  I made a slight change since we don't eat beef.  I use chicken broth and turkey meat.  Also, I put added spinach.  Totally yummy!

Not generally a fan of kidney beans, but I enjoyed this soup a lot and would make it again.  It's hearty and hot for a cold winter day, and makes a nice dinner with fresh buns or bread.

This was good but if I made it again I'd cut way down on the thyme. The thyme flavor was too strong for our taste. I'm hoping it mellows out a bit as the leftovers sit in the fridge. Otherwise very good!

Halved this recipe and used 1 lb lean ground beef and 8 oz ground turkey to save some fat. Followed all other instructions to a "T". This is now on my personal list of recipe favs! Great flavor with all the spices and good comfort food.

This was very hardy soup. I used  Cannellini beans instead of kidney beans. I can say that it doesn't taste like my Italian uncle's pasta e fagioli, however, it was quite delicious!  I will make it again.

Good recipe! Except for halving the recipe, I tried to replicate the recipe (as written). I'll admit,  I was a bit worried about using an entire 4.5 ounce jar of garlic, but it worked out fine, even though pushing the limits. Now that I've made it Ivan's way, I'll make a few small changes next time. I will probably back off the garlic a bit and add a bag of baby spinach.

I love this soup.  I add the soup over the pasta.  This way I can save  the soup  for later and the pasta doesn't absorb all the liquid.

I stumbled upon this recipe when I was looking to use up some ingredients in my fridge/cabinet and I'm so glad I did. It was very good. I did add 1/4 sugar because I didn't feel like the spices were enough. I am not much of a "measurer" so it could likely be my fault that I didn't add enough. It was very good. Next time, if I am not trying to use up ground beef, I will make or add a pound of ground sausage. Will definitely make again soon.

This was outstanding!  I cut it in half and still have leftovers.  The only changes I will make next time are to add a little more beans, and to half the garlic - which I halved already in halving the recipe.  And I am the Queen of Garlic, and never thought I would say that, ha!

Like some other reviewers, this was not what I was expecting. I cut the recipe in half and used about 8 fresh cloves of garlic, which I thought might be too much, but it wasn't. It could have used more. Otherwise, I followed the ingredient list and directions. The taste was a mix between spaghetti and chili. It was just ok for us, but I probably won't make it again. I served it with crusty garlic bread.

My three years old does not eat veggie. Even I chop them very small and put them into pasta sauce, he can still sense them and refuse to eat. But he loved this soup!!! I followed the recipe to the letter, except for replacing half of celery with carrot. I'll make it at least once a week!!!! Thank you Sir Ivan! May you rest in peace.

I was very surprised that this dish is a close twin to chili.  I was expecting a flavor quite different when reading the ingredients.  We will just stick with our homemade chili.

very good warm comfort food, hubby happy and wants on t he menu rotation.  Question for you all:   I don't care much for the texture of frozen pasta......has anybody tried making the full recipe through the point of adding the meat and then freezing half of the soup mixture at that point, with the appropriate amount of pasta and beans to be added and cooked in the soup mixture after defrosting?   ( and of course the matching amount of each of the aforementioned used immediately?  JTOL......

I gave it a 3-star because my husband liked it, but  I was really disappointed! I felt like the oregano took over the dish. I had to use Vegetable bouillon because we have a vegetarian in the house. I made everything else as is, scooped some out for our vegetarian, then threw the meat in our separate  pot at the end and simmered for 15 minutes. Also, canned beans seemed too mushy. I use them all the time in chili and never have a problem so not sure why they seemed that way. Ours got too thick so I added another can of broth. It seemed a little better, but never great. I probably won't make this again.

Accidentally made this same recipe again. Didn't realize until I scrolled down to read other reviews to make sure I shouldn't change anything and saw mine. So, guess I will make it again after all. LOL Anyway, this time I used the exact amount of garlic even though it seemed like a lot. It definitely calmed down the oregano flavor I experienced the first time making this. It turned out significantly better! I split some off for our vegetarian daughter again, and added extra beef broth to our non-veg version since I like the one served at Olive Garden, which is slightly thinner...and more "brothy." Can't to eat it tomorrow night. Beans did not get mushy this time. Yay! Changed it to a 4-star...maybe even a 5-star in it's future.

Yum. My whole family loved this. We used three or four cloves of fresh garlic instead of the jarred, and we added a bunch of fresh spinach as it was simmering. Also, we used low-sodium beef broth. Maybe that made a difference. Ours was not salty like other people have noted. So delicious! Will definitely make again and again.

I added a small can of white beans and some finely minced carrots, just because.  This was absolutely a fantastic meal!

Very good soup!  For my little family of 3 I halved the recipe and have enough for leftovers.  I reduced the meat a little, added a little salt and pepper, topped with a little mozzarella, perfect! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Very hearty and delicious recipe! I halved the recipe and made it with ground turkey, and also used about 2 tablespoons of bottled minced garlic (4.5 oz seemed like A LOT) and it turned out great. Only reason I did not rate 5 stars is because of the beans - next time I will make with no beans mainly because my hubby and I are just not big fans of the texture. Otherwise will definitely be part of normal soup/stew rotation!

This was a very hearty and tasty soup.  I made it almost as written except for reducing it to 8 servings instead of 20.  Also didn't have the  ditalni pasta nor the kidney beans so subbed macaroni and cannellini beans.  Did add one beef bouillon cube because it didn't quite have enough depth of flavor.  It was a perfect bowl of soup for a cold, rainy day.  Will keep this recipe and use again.

I made half the recipe. Used 6 cups of water, only 4 garlic gloves and used fresh basil and parsley. I Followed all the prepering instrucions and put the soup on the crockpot for about 3 hrs before adding the elbow pasta, I left it cook for about an extra hpur after that. The end resul is tasty, next time I think I will cut the dryed spices thyme and oregano in half. Also the amount of soup I made was the perfect amount to fit in my crockpot.

Just made this and it turned out delicious. I can't wait to have leftovers tomorrow. I followed the recipe pretty much exactly as written, the only change was fresh basil instead of dried. I made a slight change in the instructions and simmered the meat in the broth for an hour because my family likes a beefy flavor (my total simmer time was 2 1/2 hrs). The depth of flavor was wonderful. I will definitely make this again.

My family enjoyed my first endeavor at Pasta Fagoli and I enjoyed the ease of making it. I reduced down the portions for a smaller serving and did not use canned tomatoes (I increased the tomato paste and broth proportions instead) and finished it off with Parmesan cheese! I'm actually making again tonight!

YUMMY!  Split the recipe and it make a nice BIG pot of soup.  So good.  Letting it simmer for at least an hour, really brings out the sweetness of the sauce/broth.  Added a few carrots - chopped and a handful of frozen corn (just because they needed to be used up.  Used low sodium beef broth.  Also added a little more broth than called for because the pasta soaks some of it up.  Topped with some freshly grated parmesan.  Perfect for a cold Minnesota day!  Will make again!

excellent.   family loved it.  i also made it with ground turkey and it was great.  next time i'm going to try it using chicken (rotisserie maybe).  simmering the broth for an hour is what makes this a great recipe.

I've never had this before and decided to try it. I made it exactly as the recipe stated and it fed four adults (most of which had three bowls) and two kids, and I STILL have a giant bowl of leftovers. In fact, for the first time in my cooking career, I didn't have a big enough pot and had to split it up. Will half the recipe next time. Delicious.

Absolutely stunning! I didn't go with the kidney beans,  since I dont like them. Also I let it simmer on low heat for 2 hours instead of 1, and it made for a hearty meal. Served with shredded mozzarella and garlic bread.

This soup was fabulous. Made it for dinner with my daughter who has to eat gluten free. Used gluten free noodles and they do not hold up as well as pasta noodles so if using gluten free...do not cook them as well done.

This is unlike any soup I've had before but it was really good. The children ate it pretty well also! I'm sure it will be even better during cold weather! The picture did throw me off when I went to the store for "Ditalini" pasta because it is a straight, very short noodle.
This recipe found a place in my keeper box!

It is very rare that a recipe lives up to the hype but this was amazing! My husband is such a critic and he LOVED this. It tastes identical to olive garden's soup and what's more amazing is that I only added about a teaspoon of salt for a huge pot (half the recipe's amount of soup). His only thing was that he wanted more parmesan cheese but he does that at olive garden too... delicious!!! Thank you thank you!!

Honestly don't think I've ever tasted Pasta e Fagioli -- so I did not deviate from the recipe other than to cut it in half. The house smelled amazing as it cooked, and the flavor is wonderful. We added a little homemade Italian bread and a glass of red wine and it's perfect. Can't wait to make it for friends!

This recipe is phenomenal and my husband and kids, who used to scoff at soup as dinner, love it.  I make it as is, except I add a tablespoon of salt which we all felt it needed.  It makes so much and everyone who has tried it has talked about how fantastic it is!!!  Love, love, love, it!

Made this for a soup contest and won.  It was very tasty and simple to make  Fresh herbs make all the difference.

My husband really likes the Pasta e Fagioli that they serve at Olive Garden and he asked me to see if I could find the recipe for it.  So as usual my go to site for recipes is All Recipes.com.  I found this recipe and followed is exactly except I was unable to get ditalini at my local grocery store so I used mini penne pasta which I did cook separately).  I was hesitant to use the amount of garlic that was called for even though I love garlic.  This soup was delicious.  My husband loved it.  I will be making this often.

i loved it! i made it for the ladies luncheon and it was a hit. Only advise it to have evertyhing cut up already because i browned the garlic while i was chopping and it made the flavor a little strange. i nkow it would have tasted even better if i hadnt done that

Delicious!! We loved this soup. I did make a few changes to use what we had on hand. For 1 lb. of ground beef I used a 14.5 oz can of crushed tomato and a tab of tomato paste, I had to use beef bouillon, red beans, added a jalapeno and some red pepper flakes for some heat, used Acini Di Pepe pasta and added a cup of chopped baby carrots. Than put some Parmesan cheese on top!

My husband and I thought this was good, but not incredible. I strongly suggest that unless you're making this for four or more that you consider halving the recipe; I did, and we had leftovers for days afterward still.

This was delicious! It made the whole house smell yummy! I didn't have celery (& my fam isn't a big fan of it anyways) so I subbed red bell peppers (didn't have green). I also added cayenne powder to give it a little kick :)

Excellent, the whole family loved.  However, on the second day, the meat, pasta, and beans absorbed most of the liquid and so may consider either adding more liquid or putting over more pasta for any leftovers.

This was wonderful.  I actually did mine in the crock pot.  I did everything up to the pasta, let it simmer all day. Then at the last minute I cooked up the pasta, and added it into the soup.  Excellent,  I will make this again and again.

Followed recipe except I halfed it (and used black eyed peas instead of kidney). We ate ours with grilled cheese. We did find it alittle bland so before I put it in the fridge I added more spices, garlic powder, and alittle better than beef bouillon. But even though it was bland it was a very comforting soup.

Fell short on flavor.  I chose thsi recipe because it was recommended on the buzz and I had everything on the list to use up.  I also scaled the recipe down to using 1lb ground beef and followed the rest.  There's plenty of leftovers left and hopefully the favors will be better the next day.

Cut the recipe in half and used 1# ground beef 1/2# spicy sausage.  Added diced carrots; used all crushed tomatoes (no paste) and mostly beef (but 1 can chicken) broth--ran out of beef broth, so added a touch of boullion.  White beans in lieu of kidney beans (personal preference).  Excellent with grated parmesan on top.

We really liked this soup!  Some of the other reviewers said that something was lacking...I think they were right. I had to add salt.  I was using low sodium beef broth and the addition of salt at the table was what it needed for sure...and perhaps a bit more pepper. I think I'll add these during the cooking process next time. 

This recipe was huge! I halved it for my family of four and have tons of leftovers. I didn't know how much a 4.5 oz jar of minced garlic was from fresh and couldn't find it by Googling so I just used one whole head of garlic which I minced and it turned out great. I couldn't discern a specific garlic flavor in the soup, but I don't think you're supposed to, I think it is supposed to be a player in the medley not the main event. Some reviewers said the pasta became overcooked so I added the beans first and then the pasta. When it was al dente I removed it from the heat and let it sit for almost an hour to let the flavors mingle. As the soup rested the pasta absorbed practically all of the broth so I had to add about another 16 ounces of straight beef broth to reconstitute it (like the creator suggested in his synopsis) which worked just lovely. We topped with powdered Parmesan and I ended up ripping up my french bread and throwing it in mine. YUM!
UPDATE:  I had this at 4 and changed it to 5.  I'm addicted!

I really liked this soup. It tasted great and smelled wonderful too. I used fresh garlic and regular macaroni because I couldn't find ditalini pasta. I will definitely make this again.

This was great! I cut the recipe in half, and reduced the garlic, but other than that I followed the recipe as written, and it was delicious. This soup is super hardy and comforting. My boyfroend said "you can make this anytime". Very easy to prepare and very yummy. I will be making this a lot this winter!

This pasta e fagioli is fantastic! I like mine a little less brothy and more substantial, so have added more pasta in the past...there is no need to do that. This is wonderful just the way it is! I feel like recipes should be critiqued on the way they are written, not after changes are made. 5 stars all the way. One bonus...the house smells amazing while this is cooking! I have made it over and over again with the same awesome results. One of my go-to recipes for a cool fall night!

This was absolutely delicious.  I used a bulb of fresh garlic minced in place of the bottled, and used much more of the ditalini and the kidney beans I used were white cannelini.  We loved it!

This is to die for, the smell while it was cooking was just the start of a fantastic soup, I had alot of fresh veges, red peppers and green and some shredded carrots and green beans that needed using and then followed the recipe with the exception of the pasta on the side so it would not get mooshie. Thanks for such a good soup, would like to see some more from Ivan's collection

This was so easy to make and was wonderful. Even though I didn't let the soup cook as long as specified (I was in a hurry), it was amazing. I chose to use fresh garlic, and probably didn't add enough, I would have liked a little more garlicky punch. Served with homemade garlic toast, my family loved it. Instead of using two cans of red kidneys, I threw one can of cannelini beans in and for the pasta, I used the tiny shell pasta. It looked so pretty. I also tried cutting the fat by using lean ground turkey, and I think it was just fine. Thank you Ivan for a great recipe!

Have to say this was Awesome. I increased by 2.5 times and served to my Lions Club for dinner (it was my night to cook) with RAVE reviews. Served 35 easy and allowed for seconds. Only thing I did different was cooked the pasta separately. Perfect meal, thank  you.

This is really good and surprisingly easy. It makes a whole heck of a lot, though, so if you're a household of two like we are, cut it in half or even in quarters. I froze half of the last batch so we'll so how well the pasta holds up!

I actually thought the recipe was good, not amazing BUT my entire family ATE IT UP. And I'm talking some picky eaters including 2 toddlers. Will be making this again, possibly with turkey instead of beef for something healthier.

We thoroughly enjoy this soup all winter long!  I used one can red and one can white (canneloni) beans.  Used one 8 oz can tomatoe sauce and one 6 oz can of tomatoe juice in place of the paste.  Used petite cut tomatoes instead of crushed and sized it all down for us.

I fixed this for an Italian themed dinner and got rave reviews.  Since I only had 10 coming I cut the recipe in half.  Started it on Thursday - Step 1 & 2 plus added the meat back.  Then finished with step 3 on Friday.  Even the leftovers the next day were great.

Excellent!  Tried to make it a bit healthier, used ground turkey and added a bit of fennel to give the turkey some flavor.  Cut way back on the olive oil. Also used low sodium beef broth instead of regular.  Best thing I've made in a while.

I made this recipe exactly as written with the exception of using mild Italian sausage in place of the ground beef. It was way too salty!! I don't know if the Italian sausage alone was responsible for this- but it may have been the beef consomme. I will be sticking to Angela's Pasta Fagioli recipe from now on- I added Italian sausage to that recipe and it turned out perfect.

Excellent meal on a cold winter day!  I was a little hesitant about the large amount of garlic but I added it all anyway and it was delicious!  My only addition was about 1/4c. of red wine.  I cut the recipe in half for four of us and we still have leftovers for the weekend.  My husband calls it "Italian chili", which I think describes this dish perfectly.

Mmmm mmmm good. I use 1 lb of italian sausage and 2 lbs of lean ground beef and add 1/4 cup of red wine. Everyone loves it! Be sure to have the french baguettes ready, they make the perfect accompaniment.

The finished soup was fantastic. The kids and daddy all loved it. I will cook the noodles seperate next time, as it sat in the pot the noodles got overdone, the next day we called it Fagioli Hotdish, but it still got eaten up.

My very picky husband loved this!  I only changed the recipe in one way-I used by slow cooker.  I threw everything but the beans and pasta in and let it simmer on low for 5 hours.  I threw the beans and pasta in for the last twenty minutes and then dinner was ready...great recipe!

This is a fabulous recipe!!  I used hot italian sausage instead of ground beef, which spiced it up nicely and substituted cannellini beans for red kidney beans.  I've made two pots in less than a week because I've let my friends all try it and ended up giving it all away because they demanded more.  This is a real keeper!!

Just FAB. Freezing today and damp in VA and I threw this together. I didn't have consomme, so I used water and beef base. Cooked the pasta seperately, dumped it in at the end. Served with Parmesan. The house smelled wonderful!
Just a note. The Italian kidney bean is cannelli bean, so that is what I used. Next time I think I will use half Italian sausage and half ground meat next time.

Wow, this was really delicious. I made it exactly as the recipe calls for except I halved the recipe because it is just the two of us and I shortened the cooking time a little on the beans because I didn't want the pasta to get soggy. I will definitely be making this again! Oh, and I love garlic. I frequently add more garlic than recipes call for. It is my favorite thing in cooking however even I thought that the recipe calls for a lot of garlic. I added the suggested amount anyway and it really isn't overbearing--it's great. So don't be afraid of adding all that garlic.

Wonderful the day after too!  Added anaheim and ancho (poblano) peppers, mushrooms and carrots and a bit of red wine.  I would classify this as a stew.  A very hearty meal.

Fantastic recipe! I have made this several times making the full batch as it does freeze well...only modification on my last batch was to add some green onion along with the onions and celery... I will continue to make this time and time again, especially in the colder months! Thanks for posting a great recipe...

Many thanks to Ivan for this great recipe which is easy to follow.  I cut the recipe in half, and departed from the recipe in a few areas based upon personal preference.  I used Italian sausage rather than ground beef, low-sodium chicken broth rather than beef consomme, and garnished with fresh grated Parmesan cheese.  I love garlic but balked at using the amount called for - I cut it in half.  I will use more next time, and will probably end up where Ivan recommends.  My wife and I loved the soup.  I served the rest at a pot luck luncheon the next day, reconstituted with a can of broth, and it was quickly consumed with many compliments.

This was an amazing recipe and a fantastic product. Thank you so much for sharing this with us all! I normally do not alter recipes on the first try and experiment on the second time around, but I cannot eat red meat so I had to do some tinkering with Ground Turkey and Chicken stock. It was still great and a lot leaner. Also I couldn't find the ditalini pasta and I used campanelle pasta which was a beautiful substitute. Amazing!

I have made this soup many times.  Its wonderful; and very filling.  I serve it with a garden salald with itilian dressing and make garlic toast,  YUMMY!
Soup needs a little less garlic for us and I also add 1 tsp of tabasco.  Makes it great.  I have to use elbow macaroni could not find ditilini pasta at my supermarket.  I live in Indiana anyone know where you can find this certain pasta????

My husband enjoys cooking and last evening he prepared this recipe for 25 club members and they all raved about it and wanted the recipe.  It is the best we have ever had.  Thanks to JOHND for sharing and if he should read this we whould love to see the recipe for SOS, my husband is a retired military man.

This was great. I used more meat (3 italian sweet sausages and 1.5 lbs chopped meat), added fresh carrots and a can of green beans, and a little less onions and garlic. This made an awesome meal with warm rolls

Not a fan of this soup and this was not what I was expecting. Several people tried it and they all thought that it needed some more flavor. Sure your house smells like garlic but that's about it. I was looking for something with more flavor and consistency, the beef consome didn't cut it nor did the crushed tomatoes.

Excellent Flavor - Unlike some of the other reviews, I loved the garlic.  However, I would add more beans.

My entire family enjoyed this recipe- including our two young children. I added a bit-I got a soup bone and browned it with the ground beef. Then while the tomatoes, consomme, etc. were simmering I added it back in. It added great flavor:)This is a great cold weather meal!

This recipe was very tasty!  The only thing is...next time I will add a little less garlic.  The amount called for makes it a bit too much for me and my husband.
