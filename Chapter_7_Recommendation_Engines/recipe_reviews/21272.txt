Wow! Thanks Jo. This has become our new camping breakfast. I substituted kielbasa for the frankfurters and added some onion and garlic. Yummy!

There was nothing wrong with this, but we all agreed we would have rather just had beans and weiners with the crispy fried potatoes on the side.  The name says it all...after frying my potatoes to a beautiful crispy brown, by adding them to the beans, they simply became mush!

My boyfriend and his old college buddy who was staying with us loved this. Instead of frankfurters, I used half kielbasa, half polish sausage (sliced). Followed the recipe from there.  It didn't seem "breakfasty" to me but the boys devoured this. Thank you Jo.

Loved it!  And it was so easy to do while camping!  We used marshmallow roasting sticks to roast the hot dogs, and cooked the potatoes in foil.  Then mixed it all together in a new foil pack and heated everything together.  Very easy and no clean up!  I'll add some chopped onions next time for flavor

Didn't think this would work as well as it did.  However, since I don't like canned baked beans, I added pinto beans and mixed it all with a brown gravy.

My kids liked this!! I seasoned the potatoes heavily with onion powder and garlic powder. I omitted the salt, as the hot dogs and beans have alot of salt in them already. I served it with corn bread and fruit. A delicious, hearty meal for cold nights.

This was great, and very easy to make. My family really liked it and I found it to be a very hearty, filling and warm, especially in the cold mountain air where we were camping. I think next time, I'm going to use kielbasa instead of the wieners, like someone else on here suggested.

This was a good mix of hot dog and beans with a twist. The boys in the house really liked it. We of course added more hot sauce.
