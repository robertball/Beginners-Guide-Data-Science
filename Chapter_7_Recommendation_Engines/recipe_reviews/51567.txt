Such an easy recipe and I received many rave reviews.  I made the cake one night ahead and let sit at room temperature until it was time to serve - I did serve it with whipped cream and it did add the extra oomph! to polish the dessert off.  It tastes like a moist yellow cake with hints of pineaple here and there - if you wanted to go for an even more tropical taste, you could add add another can of pineapple to the batter - but be sure to drain well!

Great!  i added a layer of 1/4 c.butter creamed together with 1/2 c. brown sugar, 1/2 teas. cinnamon, and 1/2 c. chopped nuts to the bottom of the pans before pouring in the batter. Very very moist, freezes well.
