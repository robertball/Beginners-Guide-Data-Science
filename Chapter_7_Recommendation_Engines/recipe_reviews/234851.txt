We really liked these.  I did not use the sausage recipe, as I had breakfast sausage from pork we had processed.  
20 minutes if you want the yolk a bit runny or 30 for a firm egg.  A pretty tasty breakfast treat.

These are great and perfect for my Keto way of eating. I was looking for a quick breakfast I could take to work with me. These actually reheat really well! I made a half batch since I live alone. Mine ended up taking the full 40 mins. Even at 40 mins they were slightly soft, but how I like them.  I packaged them up in individual plastic containers and each morning I grab one for work. I reheat them on 50% power for 1:45. I will be making these again, tweaking the seasonings slightly. They've very versatile.
