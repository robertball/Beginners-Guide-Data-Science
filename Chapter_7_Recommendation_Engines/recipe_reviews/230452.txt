A bit bland. Switch italian saugage for meat loaf mix. Also added a layer of chopped tomatoes.Keep crushed red peppers on the table for real heat lovers like me!

Lots of steps to this but it was well worth it! I was worried there wouldn't be enough broth left by the time I got to the step of boiling the lasagna noodles but there was. First time I have actually not overcoooked my pasta LOL! Leftovers were great and the whole family enjoyed this. Thanks for posting this very different version of Lasagna.

Something different for dinner and everyone loved it.  The combination of ingredients came together so well.  We used spinach.  Family said to save this recipe.
