I gave this recipe 5 stars but I would make a slight change.  I did add all the extra spices and cut the sugar to 1-1/2c. I felt the Cardamon was overpowering.  Next time I will only use half the suggesteed amount.  It is an expensive spice, but try looking in the "International" aisle of your grocery store.  I have found that the hispanic section has a nice selection of spices at half the cost.  I would also advise using a coffee grinder.  You can only grind a half cup at a time, but it's faster than the food processor.  Thanks for sharing the recipe, it's a keeper!

I just finished making this and am sitting here drinking a cup.  What a great recipe and a welcome change from Russian tea.  I used all the spices in the recipe plus the recommended additional spices in the header.  The only change I made to recipe was to use decaf instant tea and 1 1/2 cups splenda in lieu of 2 1/2 cups of sugar.  Thank you to the person who said the blender was messy and to the person who suggested the coffee grinder.  This worked perfectly. For those of you making gifts, this recipe makes 4 half pint jars.  I am going to suggest on my gift tags that the recipient use 2-3 t. per cup.  Next time I am in the grocery store I will be replinishing the ingredients I used up so I can make another batch for me!!!!!

Got hooked on chai few months ago when had the flu.Was buying bigelow chai tea bags and stash ones .I also got the nurses and aides at my moms nursing home hooked too.Then found this recipe and made now we all hooked on this they say it better then the tea bags.use splenda blend 1 1/2 c. Also add nutmeg,coriander
and allspice. with water is great with milk is fantastic.
**********************
even in hot weather
now that its summertime still make chai mix but now make up a batch a chai tea in pitcher  and have it in fridge as iced chai ,also blend in blender with ice cubes for frozen chai or add to ice cream for milk shake 
**********************************

made this up as christmas gifts with a bag a homemade cookies everybody loved it. found that if i use a coffee grinder for the spices first get them really ground well than i mix it all up and use my bullet to grind it up  it gets done well and no grit at bottom a cup when done drinking it.
*****************************************
another year a Christmas gifts of this in a goodie bag with homemade cookies ,fudge,granola everybody loves this chai
******************************************

even in hot summer again made it up as iced chai kept pitcher in fridgr all summer.

Very good blend of spices.  I made the recipe exactly as stated, except that I left out the instant tea granules.  I'm not a fan of instant tea...  So, I just stick a tea bag in a mug of boiling water, mix in about 1 T plus 1 t of the spice and milk mixture, and let it steep for a couple of minutes.  Delicious!

I LOVE this mix.  It is better than the Tazo Chai I tried at our local Starbucks.  Next time I'll leave out the cloves, because cloves tend to overpower the taste.  I added 1/2 t. white pepper and 1 t. allspice.  I also used decaffienated tea.  I didn't add the cardomom because it was too expensive. My husband and I love a cup made with skim milk each evening.  I gave jars to my girlfriends and received rave reviews and recipe requests from each of them.

I had Chai tea from Tastefully Simple & was hooked!!  The price was much too high.  I was thrilled to find this recipe.  It is fabulous!  Great for gift giving also.  Adding liquid vanilla to sugar & drying is much less expensive than buying the vanilla flavored creamer.  Tastes the same either way.

The best! I first bought some chai tea mix at a coffee shop, and then searched everywhere for a recipe. This recipe matches the taste perfectly (except I cut the sugar back to 1 1/2 cups). Don't be put off by the expense of the cardamom -- it's worth it. If using a blender, mix ingredients with a fork first, then blend only about a cup and a half at a time. Also, be sure to blend it really well (because the spices can get kind of chunky in your drink).

WOW!!! I love this mix! I will never buy another premade chai tea again! 
It is next to impossible to find powdered tea up here in Canada, so instead I brewed some black tea and added the mix sans powdered tea. It worked great!
Try this....you won't regret it!

This recipe is so wonderful!  It tastes just like the mix found in stores (maybe even a little better), is much more cost-effective, and is so easy to make.  I cut the sugar down a third, though.  It was a little sweet for my personal tastes.

This comes very close to the expensive Chai mixes I have found in gourmet coffee shops. I have decreased the sugar by 1/3, to just one cup and in the future I will probably eliminate the french vanilla creamer and just add powdered vanilla ( vanilin). And this recipe, though,  makes a lot more than 16 servings when all ingredients are used. More like 26. Very tasty, though!

I just became aware of this recipe because it was in the newsletter. I'd never heard of "chai tea" before. I was intrigued, but very skeptical. I decided to break down the recipe to make one cup...I'm drinking it as I type this review...it's great! For others who are skeptical, here's the recipe for one cupful. [I had most of the ingredients, but had to substitute a couple things]...

Grab a mug and a measuring teaspoon, you can mix this right in the mug: 3 1/3 t. sugar...2 t. instant tea...2 pinches ginger...2 pinches cinnamon...1 pinch cloves...1 pinch cardamom...few grains white pepper...mix, then add: 1 cup boiling water...4 t. real milk...1 t. heavy cream...few drops vanilla extract. Stir and enjoy! It's really nice to find this new hot drink for cold winter days...thanks for the recipe, Jo!

This is fabulous! I used the suggested additions of nutmeg and white pepper. The blender does a great job to make everything nice and powdery. You must be patient and only grind a heaping cup at a time. The end result is a smooth, clump-free powder. This Chai tea is creamy, spicy and a great "belly warmer". I never thought I'd hear the words "better than Starbucks!"..but I've heard it when I served this spicy tea blend. Try it! Friends will be in awe. Top with whipped cream and sprinkle with fresh grated nutmeg. Be prepared to become addicted!  I've even added this to my homemade vanilla ice cream before putting into the ice cream maker. The ratio was 4 Tbs. to each cup liquid. It makes the most fabulous Chai tea ice cream. Have fun with this mix!!

I can't wait to try this, but can't find the unsweetened instant tea.  All I can find is lemon or raspberry flavored.  Any suggestions?

I absolutely think this is one of the best mix recipes ever made!  Cardamom is not expensive if you can find it in the bulk section of your grocery or natural food store - A tsp costs about 35 cents ($39/lb).  It cost about $.31/6 oz serving and that includes making it with a soy/rice milk base (for those of us who are lactose intolerant) which is a little more expensive than dried cow's milk!  It produced about 3 pint jars (8 servings per pint jar) + a few extra servings.  I would definately add the rest of the ingredients - white pepper, nutmeg and allspice to the mix - it gives it a little more punch!  I'll most definately use this recipe for holiday and hostess gifts this year!

Chai differs in every cafe and every household and so will yours...I drastically increase the spices (almost triple) and use 3 tablespoons of mix per mug. I make a decaff and regular one because the kids love it too.  I did cut back the sugar.  The money saved is incredible and you can't tell the difference.  I saw that some people left out the cardamom.  I could never do that.  This is the signature spice in traditional Chai.

I made this to sell at a church bazaar and had to taste it before I put it into jars!  We loved it.  I made 2 batches of it.  I didn't use cardamon in either, but I did add the allspice, nutmeg, and white pepper.  The second batch I didn't have enough ginger, but it still tasted great.  I did lessen the sugar to 2 cups the second time, because it was just a little too sweet the first time.  We will keep this on hand for those chilly nights in the Midwest.

I made this last night and it was so easy and it tastes wonderful.  I was skeptical and I scalled it down to one to try it.  I also tried the Shemakes Chai Tea and this one was much better.  I didn't use the cardamom (the store didn't have ground).  I also added the recommended white pepper and 1 teaspoon of apple pie spice (I was out of allspice).  This is such a good recipe.  Be sure to do the blender/food processor step it is very important (the single serving size I skipped the blending and the end result was not near as appealing).  One other thing:  I added 1 T. vanilla sugar to this and it really spiked the flavor.  Thanks again for sharing this gift idea. I think I'm now hooked because I'm having some as I type.

Eh.  It was okay, it's just easier and much less time-consuming to make it traditionally by adding boiled milk to the sweetend tea mix.

I think I can honestly say that this is the best recipe I've ever tried from this site... and I've tried several hundred. This mix is absolutely wonderful and tastes even better than the expensive chai mixes you buy in the speciality shops. I took others' advice and cut the sugar down to 1 1/2 cups, which was just right. I followed the recipe exactly other than that, including adding the white pepper, nutmeg, and allspice mentioned in the header. I used a blender, going a cup at a time. Takes a while, you might inhale alot of 'dust', but it's worth it. To ensure everything was a  fine powder, after blending I ran it all through a tiny sifter, then re-blended any chunks. Gave the final result a quick whisk and it was all done, all perfectly blended. I bagged it in treat bags, tied with ribbons, and attached instructions for preparation on a cute gift tag. What an awesome gift for the holidays... now I need to make a batch for myself! 5 stars all the way!

Here's a suggestion
For people like me who aren't comfortable ingesting laboratory-concocted "edible food like substances" like non-dairy creamers, simply heat a mug of milk (I use 1/2%), add a black tea bag, steep for 4-5 minutes, and then stir in 1 Tablespoon of the following mixture (1 cup sugar or Splenda---or more to taste--- and all spices listed in the original recipe. Skipping the dry milk powder, non-dairy creamers and instant tea makes the result healthier and cheaper, with no compromise in flavor. 
Thanks to those who suggested pulverizing the spices in a coffee grinder. It works great and eliminates any grittiness.

This mix is a nice alternative to the $3 cup of chai at the coffee shop. (The real thing still tastes better, but not THAT much better!) The mix does require a small investment in ingredients (with cardamom ringing up at $10 for 1.7 oz.), but the variety of spices is essential to the complex flavor that is chai. I skipped the cloves (don't like them). I made enough for a cup without the optional ingredients and decided to add them. It did make a big difference in the spiciness, and I loved it! Might even double the white pepper next time. Note: This made more than 16 servings, I think. I'd guess I have enough for 25 or 30 cups of tea.

Way too sweet.  Good flavor other than that.  I scaled it down to one serving to try it out, and it made enough for 2 servings, so the whole batch would probably make 32.  I'm going to start with half the sugar, and then add more to taste next time.  Also, I used pumpkin pie spice instead of all the separate spices.

This recipe is very close to Trader Joe's Spicy Chai Latte. To my horror, TJs discontinued their decaf Spicy Chai Latte which left my kids and I out in the cold...until I modified this recipe and made it no fat, low sugar with decaf, unflavored instant tea! My picky son proclaimed that this recipe was more flavorful and tasted fresher than TJs - that's huge!  I did buy fresh spices to ensure peak flavor.  Here are my modifications to the author's wonderful original recipe:
I used 1 cup *fat-free* unflavored non-dairy creamer;
I omitted the french vanilla non-dairy creamer (I don't like the film that too much creamer leaves on the tongue);
I omitted all the sugar & replaced it with only 1/2 cup Splenda blend [it was plenty sweet!] to which I added the vanilla and dried it in a 200-degree oven for 30 minutes;
I reduced cardamom to 1/2 tsp because while I love the dimension it adds, the full teaspoon would have overpowered the other spices; 
I did add the author's suggestion of nutmeg and allspice, however I did not include the pepper because the cardamom is already peppery. 
I used a cuisinart with the metal blade to blend the ingredients all at once [cover feeder assembly with a towel to prevent tea dust from filling the air]. 
The modified recipe filled 1 empty 10-oz TJs chai latte tin. We used 1-1/2 TJ scoops of tea mix for 1, 8 oz mug of hot water.  Maybe next cup we'll try it with hot skim milk.
Making spicy chai at home allows for tweaking the ingredients, controlling the

WOW...this stuff is delicious. This is actually my first time having Chai Tea.  I couldn't have picked a better time to make this...it feels like we are having a blizzard in VA right now. I only used 2 cups of sugar and it was definitely sweet enough. I didn't have any cardamom so I left it out.  And when I went to the store, I couldn't find any...hmmm.  I certainly don't miss it though.  This is definitely going into my coffee/tea rotation.  Thanks a million Jo!!!

Great recipe....as close to borders chai tea as i have ever tasted. I used a coffee grinder instead of a blender and it did a excellent fast neat job.

well this was good, but obviosly no one knows the real chai. what you do is first boil water & then add some eliche [ee lie chee] get it at a indian grocery store & let boil & add sugar as much as you want, then add tea, its called red label tea which again you can find at an indian grocery store then when boiled, add milk until you can know the color of the tea like a brownish & then for a better taste let boil again and there you have it; real indian chai :)

A friend who sells Tastefully Simple (love those Oh My! Chai packets!) sent this recipe link to me...and I am addicted!  What I like the most is, no matter how I've "customized" this recipe, it always turns out great!

I started with the recipe as listed and, thanks to all of the reviewers who commented about the amount of sugar being too high, I cut that down to 1 1/2 cups.  I also used decaf instant tea, since that's what we prefer.

The first batch was great, but we wanted it a touch sweeter.  So, for the next batch, I upped the sugar to 1 3/4 cups and it turned out perfect!

Initially, we mixed it with water (as suggested).  While it was good, we wanted a creamier "latte" factor from our chai.  So we used soy milk instead, and it turned out SO yummy!

Finally, we've recently eliminated dairy due to some family food sensitivities.  So... I had to try to modify it yet again.

This time, I completely left out the powdered milk...with much concern that we'd lose the "latte" factor once again.

Today, I used cold almond milk, a couple of scoops of powder and about 4 ice cubes and put it all in a blender.  It was FABULOUS!

I am so happy to still have a recipe that meets our dietary choices and tastes like the real deal.  When I shared some with my hubby, he said he couldn't tell the difference between what I had made and the expensive brews at any coffee/tea shop.

This recipe rocks!  :)

Thank you so much, Jo!!  You have given me the absolute best chai tea recipe. Poor Dunkin Donuts...they have lost some good customers.  This recipe is even better than theirs (and I used to LOVE theirs).  I look forward to coming home from work and making a tall latte mug of this tea.  I top it with just a splash of vanilla soy milk for extra creaminess.  I have shared this recipe with my co-workers and they all are hooked on it.  I actually double it when I make it and store in a huge container.  The blender step is a very important one.  First time I mixed it by hand...very grainy.  So, Jo, thank you, thank you!   You have a winner here!!!!

I had never tried chai before, largely because I associated it with soy milk (something I don't particularly care for).  Since this recipe made no metion of the soy milk, I went ahead and made some...and am so glad I did!!  This mix has a wonderful aroma and a spectacular taste.  It's a lovely change of pace from hot chocolate.  

I made it using all of the spices called for, minus the white pepper and nutmeg.  (I was out of those two.)  When I ran out of French vanilla creamer, I used regular creamer and added 2 tsp. of vanilla powder to the mix before blending.

This mix will be going in my holiday care packages as well as my pantry!  Thanks for sharing it!

This is absolutely fabulous.  I did change it to a low sugar recipe by using the sugar free french vanilla creamer, and sweetening it with 1 1/2 cups of Splenda instead of the sugar.  You would never know.  It's like sipping dessert!

This mix was delish!  I made it to give to my sister (who is a chai tea afficianado), but being the selfish person I am, I decided to keep this batch for myself and will make another for her...I guess!  I only used 1 cup of sugar and that was plenty.  I also used Hazelnut dry creamer instead of the french vanilla, it still tasted like the chai tea from Starbucks.  I also HIGHLY recommend spending the extra bucks on the cardamom... It's so fragrant and delicious, it wouldn't be the same without it.

WOW!  I am super picky about spices and I do not care for many of the spices in this recipe.  However, I love chai, if made right.  So I decided to try making this cause I'd never know until I tried.  Absolutely FABULOUS!  Definitely better than some I've ordered at some coffee shops.  It's the best treat on a cold night.  My notes: best with milk.  We made a mug of hot milk and added 2T. chai, as recipe suggests.  We also found that it is wonderful making it this way, then pouring it over ice (mix the powder with the HOT milk first, then pour it all over ice, this way the powder will dissolve).  We also made a chai freeze with milk and ice.  Wonderful!

Great.  The combinations of spices are great.  For my taste, I did not add the instant tea and just add a couple tablespoons to my hot tea. I also added more spice.  A keeper.  Thanks for sharing Jo.

Very good!! I could do with less clove as I am not a fan.  Used vanilla flavored coffee creamer instead of the vanilla/sugar mixture and will add more next time.  I found Cardamom in a local store for .99 cents for 1/2 oz. The brand was "Tones". Name brand was 11.00 for a tall size, good saving if you can find it.  Add a little whip cream to the top, and sprinkle with cinnamon.

I added the extra spices (the allspice, white pepper, and nutmeg) and it did make it as spicy as I like, but even after grinding it up twice in my food prcessor, it still left gritty results. I have to let it sit for at least 5 minutes after Imix it with water, or it is like drinking sand. After it settles, it is pretty good. I'm going to try some ways to make it mix better.

This is absolutely wonderful! Five stars PLUS! I have been drinking and buying Chai for years now and this is the perfect dry mix. I added the extra spices except for the white pepper, as the cost was not worth it, and it is perfect without it.  Don't leave out the cardamom! Of note, if you have a Wild Oats or healthier grocery type store they may have cardamom in bulk making it easier to buy a small portion less expensive. I am diabetic and my mom is too (another Chai lover), so I am going to experiment making this with sugar-free french vanilla creamer and Splenda and share it with her.  Thanks for a great and yummy recipe!!

I had never heard of Chai tea until recently and decided to give it a try.  I loved it and was thrilled to find a recipe for it here.  It is wonderful and so easy to make.  I took other reviewers' advice and cut the sugar back to 2 cups.  I still found it to be quite sweet.  Remember, there is already a lot of sugar in the two non-dairy creamers.  Next time I will cut the sugar back to 1-1/2 cups.  People can then sweeten it more on their own, if necessary.  I added the extra spices and it tasted perfect.  I will definitely keep this recipe in mind for Christmas gifts.  Thanks, Jo!

I loved it.  But, you need a mortar and pestle to make the spices so fine to make them actually dissovle.  But, other than that, it was good.  I found adding more cardamom, made it taste more like I have tried.  It is actually a milk and cardamom based tea.

A tip to find cardamom for a lot less than $7-8 or more an ounce:  look in the bulk section of health food stores.  I found it for $20.49 per POUND at Nature's Market in Indianapolis.

I recently discovered Chai and find that it is very expensive and dissappears out of my cupboard way to fast. This recipe is excellent and fun to make. I'm getting married in February and am going to use this to make little gifts for my guests. Thanks

Made 2 batches - 1st BATCH: doubled spices, added all creamer/milk, but no sweetener. YUM!  2nd BATCH: doubled spices, NO creamer/milk, NO sweetener. I have both on hand & if I want to cut down on calories I use the No creamer batch & for full taste use the batch w/creamer. Also, I'm dieting now, so using diet sugar, or add honey or sugar. 2nd batch I can just add a little of creamer (any type) to my beverage. I was spending over +$5 per box 20 Chi tea bags. Now I save money & get the full taste. Purchased green cardamom pods & grind. I think it was 10 pods = 1 ground tsp, save a ton of money. Ground cardamon at store +$10 & only made two batches. Pods $7 incl the s/h, and it will last a long time.

This is okay....needs some modifications. I made it with 1.5 cups sugar as suggested since I don't normally drink sweet drinks. Also used all unsweetened creamer and added the vanilla. This way the sweetness was about perfect. (I shudder to think of how sweet it would be with all the sugar and sweetened creamer!) I liked the amount of spice with the extra spices suggested but the problem I had with it was that I felt it was too watery, and the grit bothered me. So then I put it through a fine sieve, and to combat wateriness I made it using 1/2 whole milk and 1/2 water instead of just water. That really made it much better. So all in all, a good recipe, just needed a bit of tinkering so I couldn't give it more than 3 stars.

This is nice. I cut down on the cardamom by 1/2 tsp after reading some reviews.  I added some of the mix to the center of a vanilla chai latte cake I made today. I'm drinking the chai and my guys are eating cake. Thanks for the recipe!

Still not as good as what you can get at the nearest coffee shack - I felt it had too much of a taste of the instant tea (if that makes sense). Also I love vanilla in anything, but almost thought it was overpowering here. The spices were just right though, I did add the cardamom. Still not bad and it makes a lot.

I tried this and loved it. I have purchased Chai Tea mix from borders book store this taste much better and cost a lot less to make.

Love it! I used 2T of McCormick Chai Spice instead of listed spices.  Perfect.

This was good, but not great. Next time, 
I might increase the spices because this
really tasted more like powdered milk than spice. That's what's great about a mix, you can just add to your taste specifications. It's a good base recipe.

Yummy.  I made it as is, except instead of adding the instant tea to the mix, I brewed the tea separately. Sorry, I just don't like the taste of instant tea.  Then I added the creamer & spice mix to the tea.  I used about 2 T. for a large mug.

I love this recipe. I have made 3 batches now. The 4th batch I made I replaced the 1 cup each of unflavored non-dairy creamer and french vanilla non-dairy creamer with 2 cups IRISH CREME non-dairy creamer and only used 1 1/2 cups sugar. Now I REALLY like this recipe also.  Not to mention my co-workers like the irish creme recipe a little better than the original one. Now the thing is I want to replace the IRISH CREME non-dairy creamer with the GINGERBREAD non-dairy creamer, but it's seasonal and I can't find any.  So if someone would try it and the review it, I would greatly appreciate it. For all of my batches I used the tsp. each allspice and nutmeg but NOT the white pepper.

I love this.  I have already made this several times, and given it away as gifts numerous times to grateful friends.  My mother-in-law loved it camping, it's quick and easy to have a hot delicious drink in the morning.  I personally have cut the sugar to one cup, and am contemplating cutting it to half a cup.  I also add a teaspoon of nutmeg, and I use sugar-free French vanilla creamer.  I might try some of the other sugar-free creamers for a different taste.  I grind it up in the coffee grinder, I think it does a somewhat better job than the food processor, even though it takes longer.  Thanks for the recipe!

O-M-G !!!!!!!!! This is delicious! I used all of the spices including the optional ones. I used 1.5 times the cinnamon called for and 1/8 tsp of the white pepper. I ground this forever in my food processor to make it as fine as possible. There was still a little bit of grittiness in my cup at the end. By the way, I first ground the unsweetened instant tea and then added the rest of the ingredients and ground all together. I used 3 helping tsps for my Longaberger mug. YUMMY! My secretary treats me to a Starbucks Chai Tea Latte when I am having a stressful day; tomorrow I am going to treat her with a jar of this mix! I am going to be sharing this with everyone I know. Thanks for the post!

So warm and soothing!  Followed directions exactly, and my blender worked great for grinding it all up.  I usually use about 3 heaping tablespoons instead of 2 per serving.  The last few sips are kind of gritty, but other than that, it's great!  Highly recommend drinking it on a stressful day to relax.  Note:  Also made this omitting the milk powder for my lactose-intolerant mom, still turned out great!

I made this mix with most of the ingredients listed minus the cardamom. That's a bit expensive. However, I may need to try it sometime because the mix, although very good, seems to be missing something. I just wish it was a little more creamy and frothy like the "famous bread company" Chai Tea. I added a little pumpkin pie spice and nutmeg and pepper. My husband loves it and put it in his coffee for a real jolt. I also used Splenda instead of sugar. I used about a cup and a half of it and it's sweet, but I have a sweet tooth and would like it to be a touch sweeter. I'll probably go for the full two cups of sweetener next time. Thank for the recipe. I think it's a keeper.

Delicious and easy recipe. It is different from the store-bought brands or coffee shop varieties I've tried in the past, but it is really good. Just be careful when blending the mix. My blender started to overheat and burn the powder. Great recipe! Thanks.

My daughter and I were served Chai by mistake in a coffie shop.  We both loved it.  Don't omit the cardamon.  It is an essential ingredient for Chai.  I also used splenda (2 C.) to cut down on the calories for me.  I read all the reviews and took what I wanted to make it my own.  Pumpkin pie spice was a good tip.  Thankyou Jo, for a great recipe to make for yourself, family, or gifts.

My mom paid $18.00 for some instant chai at her local salon/spa.  I found this recipe, and it tastes just like the more expensive stuff my mom bought.  Plus, it's ALOT cheaper!  YUM!  Sit down with a cup of this tea, and a muffin or piece of raisin cinnamon bagel bread!

This chai tea mix is absolutely delicious! It is just what I have been looking for. I used fat free french vanilla coffee creamer and did not miss the fat. I also use decaf tea. Next time I will use less sugar. Thank you Jo for submitting your recipe.

awesome!!!!! i love chaia tea but hated the cost of a small bag of it (over $7.00). My friend found this recipe and tried it with me and I loved it. It is well worth the mess too. When using the food processor it tended to get messy. However, while cleaning up boil some water and when clean up is done you can enjoy a cup. What a reward! I added allspice and honey and it made it even better. I also made a batch and put it in the fridge to have an Ice chai. WOW!!!!!!! it was great in the summer.


Later I also added allspice and honey. Tastes even better

Delicious!  I've been trying to make chai at home and never could get it right, until now.  I left out the cardamom(very expensive)and vanilla powdered creamer.  To substitute, I add a little vanilla flavored liquid non-fat non-dairy creamer in the cup.  This also brings it to just the right temperature for drinking right away.

Have been using Trader Joe's Chai mix but since it's out of the way and I don't often get there, thought I'd try this. Just finished a cup and this is as good, if not better.  Couldn't come up with any suggestions to improve it.

While the cost of the spices can be prohibitive, they'll last a long time....well into spring.

Marvelous recipe....warms the spirit,soothes the soul and tastes like Christmas!  :-)

I have to thank you for reintroducing me to chai spices. I grew up drinking chai made with cardamon, cloves and ginger. I often go for the quick fix and that means ginger, i make my tea with fresh ginger everyday. Once i saw this recipe i decided to give it a try but i don't like vanilla flavour and non-dairy creamers. I  tried it anyway and it is great. 
For everyday use i don't use the mix, I prefer to use just the spices with some cream and a bag of tea. 
I plan to make my own mix of just the spices, thanks brilliant idea.

This was really great... I ground my spices first in my bullet grinder so they would be as fine as possible.  I also left out the instant tea and added it to my hot tea from a tea bag.  This is so great  because you can customize it to your own taste!  Thanks.  Definitely will be given to a few friends at Christmas!!!

I love the idea of making my own tea, and this would make a great gift. However, for everyday use I prefer not to use all that powdered and instant stuff. I mixed the spices listed here and nutmeg as suggested, then added them to some weak coffee with french vanilla creamer. Not as quick and easy, but much more satisfying, as I mistrust "fast food".

YUM YUM YUM!!!!! I had to "Canadianize" this recipe because we Canuck's don't drink unsweetened instant tea for some strange reason.   I love chai latte's from Starbucks but I always find them sweet, even when I tell them to not make it too sweet, because I love my tea/coffee nice and bitter.  I was really excited to find this recipe because I could make it without the gobs of sugar in those expensive drinks.  So here's my slight modifications:  (1) spiced it up with the extra spices suggested.  (2) added an extra teaspoon of cardamom, because ITS SUPER CHEAP FROM THE BULK FOOD STORE.  (3) added french vanilla coffee mate, which I realized had added sugar when I got home so, (4)  left out the sugar entirely.  It's rich and creamy with a very small hint of sweetness from the flavoured coffee mate.  I figured that my boyfriend can always add the extra sugar to his taste.  (5) and finally as we don't have unsweetened instant tea I just stuck the bag in the mug.  HONESTLY THE BEST CHAI TEA I HAVE EVER HAD!!! Thanks!

Absolutely fantastic. My mum got hooked on a local gourmet bread shop chain's chai tea until she found out my sister and I were paying $4.50 a cup for it for her. We tried every ready made chai tea bag we could find, but none came close till this mix. I actually used sugar free French vanilla creamer and generic Splenda sweetener as mum is diabetic and added the extra nutmeg allspice and instead 1/4 tsp white pepper it was more like 1/2 to 3/4 tsp cause Mum likes it really spicy, but finally with this we have a great sub that isnt $4.50 a mug. Warning! Cardamom is EXTREMELY expensive. The little jar I got at Kroger cost $10.88. You only need 1 tsp per batch though so make sure you stick that little jar in the freezer between batches to keep it fresh as long as possible.

This is a great find! I made it with the extra spices as mentioned by other reviews.  I used the vanilla extract in the sugar instead of vanilla creamer.  I ground all the spices together in a coffee grinder, then ran the whole mix in the food processor (1 1/2 cups at a time). This caused it to have absolutly no residue at the bottom of the cup!

This, in small jars with hinged lids, made a great companion gift with the Pumpkin Bread IV from this site.  (I only used 2C sugar - too sweet w/2.5C)Very tasty!

We made this when my daughter came up for a visit. Although a little expensive to start off with, (cardamom) it makes a lot, and is well worth it. We used our Vita Mixer and ground it into a fine powder. Excellent! just as good or better than the expensive store bought. Just don't leave out the Cardamom. It's what makes the Chai tea. And grind it as fine as you can. Thank you Jo!

I used this mix as part of my Christmas gifts last year.  I gave everyone in my family and all my close friends a jar of this along with homemade cookies.  It was a huge hit.  Everyone loved it.  I even had a few people ask me to make more so that they could have some every morning for the rest of the year.  The only thing I think is a little bad about this recipe is the price of some of the ingredients. It cost a little more than I expected. BUT...I did use generic brands for all the ingredients like the tea and the creamer, and it was still wonderful, so don't feel like you have to spend twice as much on the name brands to make it taste good.  It tastes great with whatever brand you use.

Awesome Chai Tea! Although I DO NOT recommend that you use a blender! It creates a HUGE mess, and it is hard to blend fine as a food processer would. Thanks for the great recipe! It's a definate keeper!

Love this recipe!  This is the second winter that I have been making it!  Made a vanilla caramel batch and a hazelnut batch today by substituting those flavors of creamer for both the vanilla and original creamer.  Both were great!  Everyone I give some to loves it and wants more!

Very delicious!  It has a very distinct gingerbread taste, very yummy.  A good drink to make around the holidays!  I used all of the spices called for - even the nutmeg, allspice and white pepper... the only thing I changed was that I only added 1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom instead of the full teaspoon - after smelling how strong it was, I could only bring myself to add half!  And I'm very glad I did, the flavor was perfect.

This turned out great!!! I like my chai very spicy so next time I will definitely add the nutmeg. I dont suggest using a vitamix- I did and found the mix got too hot and seemed to be cooking...Then i had to scrape and break pieces out of the bottom of the vitamix jug to get into my food processer to finish the job.  It is very important for the mix to blended very finely otherwise the spices become kind of "bitty" or like chewy little bits at the end of the cup.  I will always use this recipe! It is GREAT!!

Good recipe, I made it as Christmas gifts. Suggestion for the spices: go to an Indian store in your town, you'll find cardamon very cheap, and also the "real" chai tea mix they use in India (spices only). I used their mix, plus the dry milk and creamer.

Love it! I did not add the extra spices. And I put 3 heaping spoons in my cup instead of 2. Yumm! This makes a ridiculous amount of mix... you could easily cut in half.

This worked great.  I followed the recipe to the letter, following the Footnoted instructions for omitting the Vanilla non-dairy creamer.  To me, this tasted quite similar to the Chai tea I've had many times at Indian restaurants.  I was way too lazy to get the food processor down and put it together, so I used my blender.  It's true that it was a little bit messy - had to open it up over the sink after blending - but cleanup was still pretty easy.  It worked like a dream - I had a fine powder after two minutes of blending.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

We agree that this is far better than the Starbucks version. The only change we made was to up the tea measurement to 2 cups. Next time we may try adding the additional spices. Excellent recipe, however!

Love Chai Tea.  When I ran out of the store bought I couldn't find it anymore.  When I found this recipe a few years ago I was happy.  I use  this blend only and I have given the recipe out.  I always serve this during the holidays!  Wonderful recipe and so easy to make!  You can also add ground orange peel for a bit of a change in taste. Enjoy!

For those of you leaving out the cardamom, you are MISSING OUT! I cut the sugar down to 1 1/2 cups and I used homemade vanilla sugar instead of plain sugar. The drink turned out FABULOUS. I've given it as gifts and everyone I've given it to LOVES it. My kids add a teaspoon or two of this mix to their hot chocolate to "spice it up" I've added it to my coffee in place of my favorite creamer. FABULOUS!! Thank you so much for sharing this, Jo!!!

Great!  Initially I used 1 1/2c splenda and it didn't taste sweet enough so I added 1/2c of sugar.  I only used 3/4 tsp cloves and 1/2 tsp cardamom but added the 1/4 tsp of white pepper mentioned by the recipe submitter.  Surprisingly, I liked the flavor much better after adding the pepper -who would have known!  I ground it all together in a VitaMix blender which ground it so fine that it dissolved completely when mixed with hot water.  Cardamom is pricey but I'll be able to make this SEVERAL times with the one purchase!  Great recipe!

Made this for my son's gf for christmas.  My taste testers (I don't like Chai Team) said it is definitely Starbucks quality!  Only feedback was a little sweet.  I used 2c. of sugar but will probably cut that back even a little more.  Thank you SO much for this post.

This is the best homemade Chai Tea I've ever made.  I too used the additional spices.  One note about the sugar, I used 1.5 cups of Splenda and 1 cup granulated sugar.  It's very sweet. When I make it again, I'm going to cut back to 1/2 cup granulated sugar and 1/2 cup Splenda.  This rivals the best of the best Chai Teas I've ever tried, including the mixes from Pampered Chef and Tastefully Simple.  This one's a keeper and you won't know who to share this with first!  Enjoy and thanks to the person who shared this originally!!!

I made this with no sugar and 1/3 cup Trader Joe's stevia powder instead, and it was great - I couldn't tell it didn't have real sugar.  I also used 2 cups milk powder to 1 cup non-dairy creamer, and that was plenty tasty too.  FYI - cardamom is cheap at International & Asian groceries, around $2, as compared to those INSANE chain grocery prices.

I followed the other reviewers suggestions and cut the sugar by half.  I also increased the cinnamon and ginger by 50% and made sure to add 3/4 tsp of white pepper to add some spice.  This is a very good mix, but when the tea is made up, there is some spice/scum that floats on top and sticks to the edge of the mug.  I still enjoy it though, and it's much cheaper than buying prepared mix.  Also, I like that I control the sugar and fat, by choosing my ingredients.  thanks!

This recipe is a pale, watery substitute for traditional chai.  While it somehwat resembles coffee-shop chai, it lacks strength and depth even when you use double the amount of mix.  It's okay once in a while if you don't have time to make the real thing.  However, if you want a real treat, try a recipe for a traditional chai, and use maple syrup as a sweetener--you'll be amazed at the difference.

Good to have the ingredients and tweak things to your liking.  I made this using coffee instead of tea and it was quite nice.

Would be a five star recipe if it weren't so sweet (and I like sweet).  Came to realize that the vanilla creamer has tons of sugar in it too.  I had to add more milk powder, creamer and tea to it to make it less sweet.  Next time I'll reduce the sugar by about 1/2 cup or use vanilla sugar and skip the vanilla creamer.  Also, use the coffee grinder to grid the spices then add it to the remainder of the mixture.  Much easier and less time consuming not to mention nothing left floating in the bottom of the cup.  Awesome recipe though!!!  Thanks!

Yum! I did a half-batch and it seriously took maybe five minutes at most to make up. I used ½ cup dry milk, 1 cup of non-dairy creamer (regular, not vanilla), 1 cup sugar, 3/4 cup dry tea, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 3/4 teaspoon ginger, and ½ teaspoon cloves. I didn't have the cardamom so I omitted it, and I didn't want to buy two types of creamer for a recipe I haven't tried so I just did all regular creamer. I poured everything into the Magic Bullet blender, and it took about a minute to grind it up fine (stopping and starting and shaking occasionally). It is fabulous. I'm sure the vanilla creamer and cardamom would just enhance the flavor, but it's really good without. I might add vanilla extract to my next mug... Thanks, Jo, for a cheap and lovely recipe!

This recipe is great as is. Made it just like the recipe calls for and liked it a lot.  I then made a cup of the home party "Oh My Chai" and compared. After doubling the milk powder and lowering the sugar to 1 cup white and 1 cup brown i liked it even more. The milk made it a little smoother and the brown sugar added just a hint of caramel flavor.

Delicious and easy.  I make several batches of this each year for our church Christmas bazaar.  I put it in 4 ounce babyfood jars, add a computer-generated label, and sell them for a dollar each.  People come back year after year looking for it.

Best chai tea ever. Didn't even use the cardamom. Mixed with hot milk, so amazing. Just as good or even better than dunkin donuts vanilla chai. Never spending $2.00 a cup again. So awesome.

I think non-dairy creamer is creepy so I make this variant of chai mix.  I give my version 5 stars!

1 packet dry milk powder (about 1 1/4 cup) 
2 1/2 cups white sugar
1 2/3 cups unsweetened decaf instant tea (Nestea)
2 t ginger
2 t cinnamon
1 t cloves
3/4 t cardamom (can skip if too expensive- still tastes good without cardamom)
1 t nutmeg
1 t allspice
1/4 t white pepper

Blend in a food processor. To serve stir 2-3 heaping tablespoons into warmed MILK. (Not water!) Get the milk steaming but do not boil.  (About 2 min in the microwave for a big 16 oz mug). Without the vanilla it's less sweet - the closest commercial products to the resulting flavor are Oregon Chai's Not-So-Sweet chai mix, or Trader Joe's chai mix.

Great!  Too much sugar however.  1 cup of sugar was plenty!  Second time around I used 1/2 tsp cardamom...personal preference.

very good & also pricey to make 1st time.  I had to buy most of the ingredients because I only had ground cinnamon & sugar.  The g cardamon was $14.69. G cloves $8.79.  The total spent on all other ingredients totaled $22.94.  So, $46.42 + sugar/cin costs.  The total made filled 1 qt and 1 pint mason jar.  I have ingredients left over to make another batch[es] sometime soon. I haven't broken down what it will cost per batch yet.  I add 3 T to 2 cups of boiling water and it tastes just like the coffee shop fare. Thanks for this recipe.

Too sweet, terrible afte-rtaste.  I made this with coffeemate, and whole milk powder, as well as steeped assam black tea (There are no instant tea powders in Canada, and i wouldn't trust the processing its been through either).  Also, sugar is something you can always add afterwards, though really it should be sweetened with honey as that's healthier.

If I were to make it again, i would try finding the unprocessed versions of all these elements and use my coffee grinder. The ginger you could grind after you've dried slices of it in the toaster oven.  

Understandably some people don't have the time but sometimes it is just more worth it to not take shortcuts- especially for a chai mix that can be quickly reconstituted at any later date.

I made the above recipe but didn't use instant tea (used a regular Darjeeling tea bag and steeped), and I added dried 1 tsp orange peel, 1tsp white pepper, and 1tsp allspice and cut down the sugar to 1 1/2 cups before blending in a food processor. I agree that a coffee grinder is a better idea. Only thing I will do differently is cut down the creamer; I like a more full bodied tea (almost like coffee!) and this was too blond for me.

This is one of my favorite recipes of all times.  I put it in a jar during the holidays and give it as my favorite present! I usually add more ginger powder and a pinch of fine white pepper for a little tingle on the tip of my tongue.  I also bought a small frother and add nonfat milk.  Enjoy!

Really, really GREAT!  I did add the extra spices as recommended.  I also could not find ANY non-sweetened instant tea mix (does it exist?).  So I just cut that back to 1 cup instant tea and used 1/2 cup of regular sugar (mixed with the vanilla extract, I didn't use the powder vanilla) and it turned out better than any gourmet shop.  ***HINT*** so that everything mixes together well, I used 2 heaping tablespoons in a mug, added just a bit of boiling water and mixed all of that to a slurry, then added the rest of the boiling water.  No floaties in the cup, nice and smooth!  Thank you for sharing!

I especially wanted this recipe for when those late night hungries come calling.  I used decaf tea, Splenda, and SF vanilla non-dairy creamer.  I can now have a nighttime snack for only 1 Weight Watcher point, and it won't keep me awake all night!  (I omitted the cardamom because I refused to pay $10.59 for a small bottle of it!)

This is a great mix!  I added the additional spices from the header and I cut the sugar back to 1-1/2 cups.  It is still a little sweet for me, so next time I will cut the sugar to just 1 cup.  Otherwise, I made as written.  Just drinking my first cup and thinking how good this would be over ice too.  Grinding - I have a large KitchenAid food processor with both a small and large workbowl.  I mixed all the spices and the sugar (abrasive) in the little workbowl with the metal blade and mixed for quite awhile.  Then I dumped that and the rest of the ingredients in the big workbowl and continued to mix with the metal blade until everything was very powdery.  This worked like a charm for me.

I really liked this chai recipe, but I found the spices to be a little expensive to continue to make the recipe. Luckily I found that McCormick made a Chai spice blend that I could get at my grocery store. So in the recipe I make now, I replaced the spices with 2 tbps of the Chai blend. I find it works very well, and can make the recipe a lot cheaper!

This recipe makes an excellent chai spiced tea. I did modify it by using only the spices listed including adding the nutmeg, allspice and pepper.  Add approx. 1/4 tsp to your cup of tea when you add the hot water to the tea bag.( I use 10 oz mugs)  and adjust your sugar and milk to taste. You will have sediment in the bottom of your cup from the spices since they don't disolve. Works awesome in a teapot too!

Yummy- I love pumpkin chai- so here is how I adapted the recipe.  Instead of vanilla creamer I used pumpkin spice creamer from coffee mate and added 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice.  I found cardamon seed (not pod) at an Indian store and ground it- very cheap!! I used 1 1/2 c Splenda and fat free creamer and decaf tea. This made a great sugar free/ almost fat free/ decaf treat! Great for 0 weight watcher points.

Great recipe.  I love being able to control the amount of spice...and I finally found a use for that dorky little Bullet blender!  By the way, I got my spices at a local Asian grocery.  The most I paid was $2.50 for 3 ounces of cardamom.

This recipe probably does not need one more 5-star rating, but it really deserves it!  I made this and gave it to many people for Christmas.  Almost everyone asked for the recipe.  I changed it a little, based on recommendations from others.  I decreased the sugar to 1 1/2 cups, and added 1/2 tsp. ground white pepper.  Once I made it with the 1 cup non dairy creamer and 1 cup French vanilla non dairy creamer, and once I made it omitting the regular nondairy creamer and instead, I added 2 cups of the French vanilla nondairy creamer.  Both were good.  I will use the 2 cups vanilla creamer again next time so I don't have to buy so many items.  The vanilla was not overpowering.

This is a really good recipe if you're tired of plain ole English Breakfast. I make a coffee similar to this and the flavours are wonderful, but you have to like these ingredients to enjoy this tea. Also Chai means tea, so chai tea mix is like saying tea tea mix. Anyway good recipe, will make again!

I love this recipe, I use it all the time! Only thing I change, it was by mistake, was nutmeg instead of cloves. Cloves tends to be very overpowering so if I were to use it I would use 1/4 to 1/2 tsp if at all. Also, bulk spices are well over half the price of the spice isle. Cheers

I really like this recipe. It is a good Chai Tea mix.  When made it I added just a little extra clove. I will make this again and play with the amounts of spice a little more to perfect it for my taste but overall it is a very nice recipe. Also, I know the ground cardamom is a bit expensive but in my opinion it is a key spice so don’t skip it.

I made as per directions and spices are overpowering. I think I will put less cardomon in next time.  It is very strong spice, I suggest put some in and try it then add to your taste.

this is a perfect recipe.  I actually compared it with Dunkin Donuts. Very similar. I changed the spices a little.  Half the ginger, cardamom, cinnamon. Added 1 tsp. of all spice and dry honey (found only online)  I think that was the special ingredient used with D.D.

I only like it iced with extra milk or cream!

I love chai but don't handle caffeine well.  This recipe allows me to use decaffeinated tea and drink all the chai I want.  Yes, there tend to be dregs at the bottom of the cup but I don't really care.  I do REALLY blend the mixture at the highest speed until it looks like flour.  I have made three batches and use all the spices.

Absolutely wonderful!  I skip the cardamom (personal preference) and add the allspice and nutmeg.  Having this on hand is a priority in my house.  My daughter loves this and makes this tea every night.  We have both given it as a gift, packaged in small tins with a pretty mug or cup along with the recipe, as this is always requested.  LOVE IT!!!

this was really delicious, I followed her advice and added the extra spices, the only changes I made were I didnt add andy of the dairy products or sugar.  I just mixed the spices and add the spices to the water, then I mix in whatever dairy product I have available whether creamer, half and half, or milk.  then I sweeten it with either honey or suger, whatever I have available.  I took the advice of some of the reviews and gave the spices as gifts to family and friends and they loved it. my friend it lactose so she used soy milk and it was still very tasty. I just tell people to and milk and sweetner to their own tast and this works for everyone!! next time I think I'll try a chai smoothie with vanilla ice cream>

LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!  The cardamon is one of the main key ingredients and it is well worth the money because you will be making more than one batch of this in the future if you are a hot drink lover.  I made ours sugar-free by subsituting Splenda for the sugar.  The key to not getting any remaining graininess in the bottom of your cup is to make sure you blend it well until it is a very fine powder.  I found it worked better to blend 2 cups at a time instead of 1.  And like others have said, while it is good mixed with water, it is so much better mixed with a mug of hot milk.  I have made this 4 times now because friends and family taste it and I end up giving them a sandwich baggie full to take home with them!  Thanks for a great recipe.

This is an awesome recipe. I was introduced to Chai Tea by my daughter who got hooked on Starbucks. I have doubled and tripled this recipe many times and found some things that might be helpful. I used my blender the first time I made this and the mix was the consistancy of powder (the mixer can crush ice) it had 4 blades on it. I found it worked better if I blended two cups of the mix at a time. I tried this with my food processor and the consistancy was not as fine (more grit). If you are finding more grit in your mix try to switch appliances like I did see which gives you the best product.  I think the cardamon sets off the recipe and even though it is expensive its worth it. I've made this with Equal and Splenda and snuck it in on my daughter, delicious both times and she couldn't tell. It is great with a splash of raspberry syrup (even sugar free) and a dollop of whipped cream. YUM! Dessert in a cup!

I LOVED this recipe! It's even better than store-bought! Since we're having a heat wave, I didn't want to use hot water ot milk to make it, so I used my blender to mix the powder mix with some cold milk. It turned out delicious, creamy, and frothy, like something from an expensive coffee shop. Mmmmmm!

Awesome recipe! Added a tsp. of nutmeg and some black pepper. Like it better than Trader Joe's Chai. Next batch I'm going to add 1/4 cup of cocoa as I loved TJ's chocolate chai the best and the discontinued it. Can't wait to give this out as gifts this year! Thanks.

I really do like this Chai Tea Mix but I only gave it a 4 because:
a) There is a lot of residue in the cup and as "foam" when you make this.
b) The mess!  Grinding all of that in my food processor was a pain - and it was sticky even just "granulating" the powders up.

I did have trouble finding plain tea mix so I used instant iced tea mix.  I couldn't find one without lemon so I had to use it.  Any suggestions on where to find that?  This lemony batch wasn't bad but if I'm going to make it again, I'd want to find the non-lemon kind.

I'm definitely a Chai-a-Holic...and have budgeted a large one at Starbucks every day for the last 3 years.  I am very tired of spending the money.  This recipe is similar to Starbucks and is very, very good.  I like it better than any store bought.  I made it with 2.5 cups of Splenda and used the nutmeg and white pepper as others suggested.  The only change I would make it with 1/2 ff milk and 1/2 water as I like my drink a little creamier.  Thanks for sharing.

This is so yummy! I didn't even add the dry milk and it's fine. I also used splenda instead of sugar. Be sure to add the white pepper and nutmeg. The cardamom makes it very authentic. Thanks for the recipe.

this is an easy and wonderful recipe for chai!  it really does taste like 'real' chai and i must agree with others, the cardamom is ESSENTIAL to achieve that authentic flavor.  i did add the nutmeg, allspice and white pepper and did not find it too spicy.  i tripled the recipe so i could give away jarfuls as christmas party gifts.  i made this and the 'cappucino in a jar', served both to the guests after dinner and of course they were all asking to take some home.  voila, i had holiday bags with a jar of each all ready to go.  french vanilla flavored creamer is quite expensive (to buy in large quantities) so instead i doubled the amount of regular creamer, and then i added vanilla extract to the sugar (decreased to 2 c., perfect sweetness!)and used a whisk to evenly distribute it as noted on the recipe.  i did have a slightly difficult time finding unsweetened instant tea (everything is sweetened lemon flavor!), so if you plan on making this make sure to leave yourself enough time to go to a couple different shops if need be.  it's much nicer made with hot milk but hot water will do just fine.

I made this using the extra spices listed in the title.  I did use 1/2 cup less sugar & it seemed plenty sweet enough.  However it did not seem "creamy" enough so I recommend adding it to milk rather than water or adding a splash of cream after you mix it up.  The flavor is very good, but you may need to add a bit more mix to your liquid depending on how many ounces of liquid you use.  I may experiment adding more spices, especially cardamom.

A very good Chai mix! I've tried several different recipes and this one really hits the mark! For those who didn't add the cardamom because it's too expensive, that's a huge mistake, cardamom is an essential ingredient in Chai tea! So spend the extra bucks and you'll be greatly rewarded with an authentic tasting Chai tea mix. Try looking in the bulk spice section of farmers markets like Sprouts or Henry's to save quite a bit over grocery store prices. It's worth the extra effort! You can also find real vanilla powder (used the same as real liquid vanilla) in the same place if you want to substitute for the vanilla creamer.

Absolutely awesome!  I could not find unsweetened instant tea, so I made it without the tea and added the mixture to a steaming cup of hot black tea.  The only other change I made was to use Truvia cooking blend, 1/2 cup, in place of the sugar.  Best and most inexpensive chai tea I have ever had!

So happy to see this recipe!  I'm saving so much by making this at home vs. running down to the famous coffee chain and spending $4!  And this recipe tastes so much better than theirs, plus you are saving on cal's and can modify your sugar content if you're watching that too! I had to modify the sugar content in this recipe so I implemented the suggestions and I still think it tastes so yummy.  I used sugar-free powdered creamer and substituted 1 1/2 c. generic "Splenda" for the white sugar.  As per another suggestion, I made a cup using a chai-flavored tea bag, then stirred it into that to eliminate having to buy instant tea as I already had the tea bags on hand. I also liked another reviewer's suggestion to use Pumpkin Pie Spice instead of purchasing all those other spices listed.  It worked perfectly!  I added 4 tablespoons of it into the mixture but you many not want yours as savory so add slowly and taste as you go if you go the Pumpkin Spice route.

I've been making this mix for years!  It's one of my favorite winter warmers. It's been given away in jars to rave reviews from friends and family.  If you like a sweet chai, this fits the bill.  However, I do add more mix to my water than called for for a stronger cup.

I'm so happy I stumbled upon this recipe. With a few minor changes, it was perfect. 

I wasn't able to find any instant tea, so I made it without the tea, brewed a bag of orange pekoe, and then added the mix to taste.

Also, as I made it for gifts, I made some with sugar and some with Splenda. 

The sugar recipe was too sweet, so I added about 1/2 a teaspoon more of each spice, 1/3 cup more non-fat dairy creamer and skim-milk powder. I also reduced the sugar to about 1 1/2 cups.

With the Splenda version, I could not use the vanilla flavoured powdered non-dairy creamer, as it was sweetened with sugar. I also found when I added vanilla to the Splenda, it did not turn out too well. So, I added the vanilla to the dry milk powder and let it dry before blending.

It tastes fabulous. Here's hoping it is appreciated by those who receive it as gifts!!!

This is a great recipe. My first cup seemed a little rich, but it's growing on me. It's a very inexpensive substitute for the commercial brand I drink and I'm looking forward to tweaking my next batch to my own tastes. And I'll definitely try the spicier variation in the heading at some point.

This recipe is great, thank you for sharing it! Instead of ground ginger, I always use fresh ginger.

This was a good recipe, although I would increase the actual Instant Tea next time just for my own taste.  I put it in jars and gave it as gifts for the holidays.  It was a big hit.

I made this for my first time, and I only review based on the ACTUAL recipe.  It was good, but even for someone with a sweet tooth like me (bring on the buttercream icing!!), it was a bit sweet.  I did make the recipe with the suggested extra spices.  I also could not find instant tea (where do you find that stuff in Canada????), so I had to make regular black tea and added the mix to that.  I will definitely make this again, but for sure will cut back on the sugar.  I like more spice than sweet in my chai.

I was buying the Oregon Chai tea and wanted to find something cheaper.  This tea is delicious!  I love it and even went back to the other tea I was buying and preferred this one.  I did notice that I have some floaties on the top, must be that I need to mix it finer.

EXCELLENT!! I just mixed some of this yummy stuff up to see how it compared to my normal chai tea I buy, and i say amazing!! I made a few changes, I like mine a bit creamier so I added an extra cup of dry milk, and half cup of creamer. and like other sugestions, I also added extra spice 3 teaspoons of ginger and cinamon, 2 teaspoons of cloves and 1 1/2 teaspoons of cardamom as it has a very strong flavor. I was verry happy with thte results, i think the best part of this recipe is being able to play with it and make it your own!

Very good recipe! Don't skimp out and omit the Cardamom! It's the basis for this flavorful beverage. If you don't have it, buy it- or make a different kind of tea! I made this recipe as written with the exception of adding a little more of each spice and a few dashes of Allspice. Yumm, thank you!

Excellent recipe!  I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and opted to spice it up a bit.  I replaced the French vanilla flavored powdered non-dairy creamer with 2 tsp vanilla extract, and I used only 2 cups of white sugar.  I also added 2 tsp of ground cardamon instead of 1 tsp; 1 tsp of ground allspice, 1 tsp nutmeg, and 1/8 tsp white pepper.  This made such a smooth and delicious cup of tea with the perfect blend of flavors--what a treat!  Thanks so much for sharing.

Loved this! Use McCormick's Chai Spice Blend rather than mixing up the spices myself, works wonderfully. My kids even like drinking it in place of hot cocoa.

I found this to have an unpleasant powdered milk aftertaste. Perhaps I'm just sensitive to that particular flavor because my mom used to give me powdered milk when I was a kid and I HATED it. If I made this again, I would either replace the milk with creamer or make sure I was using fresh powdered milk.   My Indian boyfriend has taught me to like spicy, strong chai. To make this palatable to him and me, I doubled the spices (including the allspice, nutmeg, and pepper) and added between 1/2 and 3/4 cup extra instant tea. It's still very sweet, but now it has a little more kick.

Delicious! My husband and I both loved this mix. I did reduce the amount of sugar to 1 cup and added the extra spices as we like it spicy. Thanks for a great recipe!

This chai is fab-ul-ous but I would like to add a note, due to a diet I was on and the absence of vanilla flavored creamer in the house, I thought I would try the receipe with what I had on hand since I need my CHAI. I found that using the plain creamer instead of the vanilla made little or no difference in flavor. I also cut the sugar in half and found it to not have such a sweet after taste. I think the basic receipe is great and it is possible to twick it for anyone's personal taste. Also I use my magic bullet to mix ingredients together, if you mix the seasonings together first, add it to the mixture and then grind everything together you get a smoother taste BUT that's my opinion and I'm sticking to it.  Thanks for the recipe, I have converted many people to Chai latte.  For a treat, try using coffemate liquid Itialian Creamer, it is wonderful.

All I can say is...MMMMMMM!!!!  This is soooo good.  I made it with all the spices (header included), 1 3/4c splenda mix, FF French Vanilla creamer, & Lite Original creamer since I wanted to try a little "lighter" version.  I mixed it with skim milk and it's absolutely DELICIOUS!!!  Now I can splurge without feeling guilty while on my diet.  I don't even think you can tell a difference from the regular & my unleaded version.  LOL!  This is definitely a gift mix.  Thanks so much for creating this awesome recipe!

I have made this a few times now and it's excellent but I have taken the comments from other reviews and used them.
Firstly 2 1/2 cups of sugar is way too much, cut that in half.  Do not use the Vanilla creamer, do as they suggest with the vanilla extract and pour onto the sugar, make sure you let it dry it takes a while.  Also use a good vanilla extract, one without alcohol.  The cardamons are also a must however they are very strong in flavor and if you don't use the vanilla creamer they can over power the flavor.  Without the vanilla creamer use only half the cardamons it calls for, you can also cut down on the cloves.
I added the nutmeg (ground from whole) and allspice however I keep forgetting to get while pepper, when I do I will add it, these extra spices are a must.
Finally, for taste I use three generous teaspoons when I make a cup and I will only use milk, just not the same with water.

Tastes more like spiced milk than your typical chai tea, but the person I made it for enjoyed it all the same. Thanks for the recipe!

I chose to omit the French Vanilla creamer per the note on the recipe because I forgot to buy it- BIG mistake!  You definitely need to use it.  Also, clove is really strong so you should use no more than 1 tsp.  Now we save money by not buying Chai at coffee shops.  Enjoy!

Good mix. Not quite as good as a coffee shop, but better than store-bought. I used decaf tea to make decaf chai mix.

I have never commented on a recipe from allrecipes before, but I just HAD to comment about this one!  I absolutely love Big Train chai tea, but I have to say that this is equally as good, if not better!  I added all the optional spices, and added vanilla to the sugar rather than using vanilla creamer (as other reviewers suggested).  Just FYI, I found a big jar (3 oz.) of cardamon at Super Target for only $4.49.  This is a WONDERFUL recipe that I will definitely use again.

I love chai tea, and this recipe was awesome!  I cut down the sugar as some of the other reviews suggested.  I also didn't use instant tea, but instead just used one tea bag for a cup.  I found this to be a lot more flexible.  You can decaf chai or regular chai.

This recipe is AWESOME! I am addicted to International Foods sugar free Chai latte and this recipe is a dead on clone of IF's only much cheaper to make. I made mine with Splenda and can't tell a bit of difference. I plan to make chai pudding, chai cookies, sugar free chai breakfast cake and of course iced latte.....Thank you for sharing this!

I use decafinated tea mix and Splenda (in smaller amount) - prefer less sweet and still tastes good.  Great mix that stores well.

Best results with purchased pre-ground spices for even distribution and fewer lumps.  If using Splenda, do not make it vanilla flavored as suggested... results in a gooey clump that does not dry out into a powder.

As other suggest I use less sugar. I don't understand the reviewers who complained about chunks of spices.  To me ground ginger-cinnamon-cloves-cardamon- means purchased as powdered spice, not as whole spices, to be ground.

This is a wonderful recipe! As I live in Mexico, I cannot find instant tea that does not have lemon in it. So I make the powder then use it in a cup of hot black tea. works great!  I have now translated it into spanish for a few of my friends.

After being married for 8 years to a Hindu Indian man and making homemade chai I found this wonderful recipe to be delicious and pretty close in taste to the real deal. I now make this recipe up in bulk for my  ex and his freinds for thier many over the road trips. It is especially nice to be able to take along the dry mix so they can have thier chai on the road instead of being stuck with the usual coffee, hot chocolate or English teas available at most conveinent stores. Just purchase the cup and hotwater if the store insists! As far as the gritty spice at the last few sips, at home you can strain it. Remember too that so many spices are wonderfully inexpensive if you purchase them from a Indian grocery!

This was great!  I always loved the combination of spices in chai...now I know what they're all about.  The cardamom is definitely essential.  I made a few substitutions based on what I had...doubled the dry nonfat milk to make up for the nondairy creamer, used only 2 cups of sugar, and in terms of the spices, I added the cinnamon and extra cardamom and instead of ginger and cloves, I added nutmeg and allspice.  The spice flavor was great, but I think next time I'm gonna add more instant tea, as I like my chai stronger.  Yes, when you mix everything up, it looks like it makes a ton, but after you blend it, you end up getting enough to fill one and a half of the take out Chinese food soup containers (which I used to store my mix).  This is a great recipe...just gotta play around to suit your own tastes!

I would give this recipe six stars if it were an option.  I made this and gave it to friends and co-workers for Christmas.  I am still getting requests for the recipe.  It is better than any Chai tea I have ever purchased.  The cardamom makes this recipe - spend the extra $$ or make a trip to gourmet shop if you can't find it locally - so worth the extra time and $$.

This is great!  I love it.  I doubled the cardamom and ginger and added the pepper and nutmeg because i like it spicy!  I found an Indian grocery store here that sells the spices for MUCH less than the regular supermarket.

This is amazing! My mugs must be big, because I had to use the tablespoons per cup. I added the extra spices, as suggested. I like the kick the white pepper gives. So delish!

really good chai recipe to get a start on also making a sugar fee version. Substitute 1/2 cup of Vanilla Powder and add 1 cup extra of powdered cream, also, substitute Xylitol for Sugar and cut amount by half.

Almost everyone I know loves chai but hates the cost of buying it at a retail establishment. Plus, I wanted to be able to make a quick cup at home in the microwave and also give a mix for New Year gifts. I used all the suggested ingredients.

I followed this recipe exactly, with the exception of reducing the sugar by one cup. The creamers already had sweetener added, and I don't like overly sweet beverages. Next time I will make this with Truvia, but since this batch is for gifts I used sugar. Also, I could only find instant iced tea mix and I assumed instant iced tea mix would work (without lemon or sugar added by the manufacturer). 

I realized as I mixed the ingredients that my blender would not hold them all, so I first poured the full amount into a large pitcher and shook it to try to distribute the ingredients evenly. Then I put half into the blender and blended on mix, followed by whip. I repeated this step with the other half, then poured both halves back into the big pitcher and shook it some more. I wanted to be sure the ingredients were mixed throughout. The results are a very fine powder that mixes well with hot water and tastes divine.

I figure each cup costs about 30 cents to make, maybe less.

As is, this is a good recipe, and good for gift giving.  I don't even like instant tea, but I love this.  The spices are expensive, so it's a good idea to make a small batch first so you can tweak a larger recipe to your tastes.  I do not care for vanilla, so I left it out and used regular creamer. I did not at all find this too sweet and even added more sugar to my final mix as well as triple the spices, including a small amount of nutmeg and black pepper (I love the kick of the pepper, and it is found in many traditional Indian chai recipes). Chai very much lends itself to personal preference, so start out with your basic preferences and experiment from there.

For chai latte, mix with hot milk instead of water - the fat in the milk helps bring out the flavor of the spices and will taste more like the coffee shop type.  I usually fix mine with water but it is good with 2% or whole milk for a latte. 

My only complaint is that I did not make enough :)

The only problem that I have with this mix is the grit I get at the bottom of my cup. I guess I need to find a way to process it finer. I also use more mix per cup as I long it strong.

I just whipped up a batch of this using all of the spices referenced and it turned out great!  I love chai tea but not the expense that comes with it at Panera or Starbucks or the calories. I made this with Splenda, as suggested by another reviewer, and Decaf instant tea.  Low calorie and delicious!  I will definitely make it again.

A fantastic way to make a bulk amount for gifts and the winter season.  The flavor is good, but I haven't gotten the texture quite right...generally get "floaties" film on the top.  Mixing it with a commercial cocoa helps.

Wow, what a wonderful idea!  I'm hooked on the David Rio chai mix so I was really attracted to the idea of making my own mix at home.  It's wonderful!  I followed the recipe exactly except I left out 1/2 C of sugar.  My only thing is the taste of the actual tea is a little strong (for me) and I will be sure to slightly reduce the tea amount next time.  I can't wait to experiment with the nutmeg and allspice as well!  One thing to point out: I had to buy tea, powdered milk and the creamers to make this recipe. I bought the large sizes of each and made a TON. It cost me $13, which is about what I would pay for two cups of chai from my local coffee house.  This is just as wonderful, but a fraction of the cost!

Saw it on FB today, bought all the ingredients and tried it. My husband and I both loved it!!! Thanks for sharing this recipe and thanks for the suggestions using substitute sugar and decaf tea. This is really a guilt-free treat in the evening. I was able to find sugar-free French vanilla creamer and used Stevia to replace white sugar. It wasn't too sweet. Just perfect to the taste. Now we can save $$ not going to the *bucks. :)

Doubled the spices, although didn't have more tea to add. I used tea leaves and processed them in the food processor; while they were processed to a powder, they didn't dissolve in the drink. This left a sludge at the end of the drink, but otherwise it was very good!

Awesome recipe, and the great thing is it handles variation extremely well.  We've done it with and without the food processor, both work, I like the processed better as its a finer powder.  We've done the cardamom and left it out.  My favorite is with cinnamon, ginger, cloves and nutmeg. Next round we will start experimenting with sugar sub for some of the sugar. WELL worth the making of it, thanks for sharing!!!

FYI:  You can buy cardonmen at World Market for $3.99 a bottle.

I always like to make things exactly as the recipe calls the first time.  So, I did.  I agree:  as is, it's just too sweet for me.  I have enough for a second batch...will make that minus a ton of sugar and mix it with the first batch...I bet it will be fine and way yummy.

My daughter and I just tasted this, admittedly skeptical how good it would be.  Wow.  Awesome.  As good as anything I've gotten from any number of coffee shops.  I made the recipe exactly as listed, grinding in small batches in a coffee grinder to get it powdery.  We added 2 heaping tablespoons to a mug of hot milk and it tastes great.  My daughter is going to give some to her friend, who is a chai fanatic, as a Christmas present.  Thanks for the recipe.

Love this chai mix! I omitted 1/2 c. of the sugar since I generally like things a little less sweet, and I found it to be just perfect for me. My Magic Bullet did a great job of making it powdery.

I'm drinking my first mug now and LOVE it.  The only thing I changed was to use only 2 cups sugar.  I know the cardomon is expensive.  It cost me about $11 for the pods but I only used about 1/4 of them.   I will be using this for gifts this holiday.  Awesome.

We sub 2T pumpkin pie spice for the spices. It was more economical than purchasing the ground ginger, cloves, and cardamom separately. We also tried making it with hot milk instead of water and it is very rich and wonderful. This has been part of our Christmas tradition for the past several years, and we make a 4x batch to give as gifts. When the weather turns cold, the kids always ask "when are we going to make that chai mix?".

This is a super delicious recipe and tastes just like Trader Joe's Chai Mix, but unfortunately, it's very high in sugar and chemicals (in the non-dairy creamers).  The first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly.  The second time, I decided to create a healthier (but just as tasty) version.  For the mix:  3 cups of powdered milk, and all the spices listed in the recipe.  That's it.  Then, to make a cup of chai tea:  Make a regular cup of hot tea with a tea bag (not instant tea) and let it steep for a couple minutes. Stir in enough of the powdered mix to taste.  Add liquid Stevia to sweeten, and a little splash of vanilla.  Voila!  Just as tasty, but all natural and low calorie too!

Great starter recipe! I did not add the cardamom ($11 @ Walmart, no thanks). Added a little more non dairy creamer and saw in my pantry some pumpkin spice non dairy creamer which sounded good, so I added a tiny pinch of that and a tiny pinch cocoa powder (not sure what possessed me to do so, but turned out good). 

I like mixing into hot milk for a creamier drink.

Makes a wonderful gift!  Mix 1/4 cup mix with 1 cup hot water for the ideal flavor

THANK YOU! I love Oregon Chai, but I just can't afford to "treat" myself.  This mix is amazing! I used half of the amount of sugar suggested and I used vanilla extract (see footnote of recipe).  It is delicious! THANK YOU, THANK YOU!

WOW!  Made according to the original adding in the white pepper and nutmeg.  Absolutely delicious!  Purchased the ground cardamom from the bins at Winco and it was only 25 cents. Also purchased the powdered milk and creamer from the bins which kept the cost down.

As I write this review, I am sipping a delicious cup of this wonderful drink, thrilled at how much money this is going to save me.  I added the extra spices, only used 1 1/2 cups sugar, and skipped the cardamom and pepper.  Perfect!!

Made this for my husband because he LOVES Chai tea.  Definately need to make sure you add plenty of vanilla creamer!  It totally makes it or breaks it!

I use recipes from this website all the time but this one was SO good it made me sign up just so I could comment on how delicious it is. I followed the recipe except I didn't add any cardamom, I only used 1.5 cups of sugar. I did add the extra ingredients, nutmeg and white pepper. Amazing. I made half a cup to see if there was anything else I needed and myself plus 4 other people took sips and we all agree there is not a thing to change.

Love this recipe!  I added the additional spices recommended and changed the sweetener to 1-1/2 c. splenda.  I also have found vanilla caramel creamer that I use.  Can't ever go wrong adding caramel to something!

Delicious! I completely agree with others that 1 1/2 cups of white sugar makes it plenty sweet. I also discovered a vanilla sugar called "vanilisocker" from IKEA that worked tremendously well in place of the French vanilla creamer. I used 2 tsp. of this instead of having to use real vanilla extract and wait for it to dry.

Absolutely delicious!! After reading other reviews, I only made a few minor changes: reduced sugar to 1 1/2 cups and added the additional spices in the header. Also took other people's advice and ground the whole mixture in my coffee blender so it gets very powdery (hardly any grit in the bottom of the cup that way).  So, so yummy!!

I am a recent convert to Chai tea and happy to have found this recipe.   I added the additional recommended spices in other reviews and cut the sugar by 1/2 cup.   Grind the spices in a coffee grinder, then grind the rest of the ingredients to a fine powder.   Even my husband, who is not a tea drinker or chai fan likes this mix.   Plan to give as gifts this Christmas and made a sugar free version for my brother.

I’ll give this recipe five stars because it’s a great starting point, but I did make some changes. I did use the nutmeg, allspice, and nutmeg as recommended in the description. I also only used 1½ cups sugar based on others’ reviews. The biggest change I made was to double the amount of all the spices. When I tried it using the amounts listed in the recipe I thought the chai flavor was pretty weak and was definitely overpowered by the sweetness of the sugar. I tossed it all back in the food processor and added a whole second round of spices, and after that it came out perfect. If you like a nice bold chai taste, I definitely recommend doubling all the spices.

I make this with the vanilla/sugar option as well as the additional spices.

I've made this a couple times
-one with less sugar (1cup) and soymilk. It was a disaster. I blame it on the soymilk powder
-one with double the spices. Too powerful for my tastes
-less sugar (2cups)

so far I've liked the one with less sugar. I think it's because the tea I get already has sugar in it (called 3 in 1 milk tea which has tea, sugar, powered milk). For those of you having a hard time finding instant tea, go to an Asian supermarket. They sell it in large bags of individual packets and have many different brands of it. For those of you who don't have that option, I have seen it in the ethnic asile at Superstore. 

For those of you concerned with the price of certain spices, try bulk. I got all mine from Bulk Barn and the most I paid for was $3 (which was the cardimum) for a spice. I was able to fill to the top of my reuseable spice jars.

All in all, I love this and have been very addicted to drinking these ever since I discovered this recipe. I highly reccommend to all.

I thought this recipe would be great because of how many great reviews there were, but I have to say I'm not a fan.  Even after being blended in my magic bullet I still found the mix to leave a lot of sludge at the bottom of my mug and my boyfriend found the taste to be watery and not strong enough.  To anyone trying this I would recommend you make a half or quarter batch first as it makes a lot.

Everyone I have given this to or made it for absolutely loves it! I did not add cardamom as I couldn't find it easily, so I just left it out. I'm sure it would be good with it too, but I will continue to make it without :)

I actually have a question: for those who are lactose intolerant, could you leave out the milk powder and use the mix with lactose free milk instead of water?

This is my husband's favorite drink for work.  He takes 2 full thermoses each day.  We don't use instant tea, so I make green tea and add this mixture to make his Chai tea.  He likes his chai very spicy so I use 3 tsp of ginger, 3 tsps of cinnamon, 2 tsp of ground cloves, 2 tsp of cardamon and 1 tsp of ground allspice.  Per 1 thermos (or 3 cups of green tea), I mix in nearly 1/2 cup of chai mix and mix in a small blender till a little frothy.  He loves it!

The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly (a first for me!) I found the mix too sweet and weak. The second batch I made I added no sugar and doubled the tea, combined both batches and it was great. In the end halved the sugar and doubled the tea, definitely best made with milk for an authentic flavour.

I have been dying to try this recipe for a long time, because I am obsessed with chai lattes, but it gets expensive buying them from coffee shops, & the mix that I like is not available at most of the stores close to my house. I whipped this up in about 10 minutes & immediately fixed myself a mug (with milk, so it was like a latte). I am very impressed! It tastes very close to the chai lattes I know & love. The only thing is, one of the spices is a little too overpowering for me, I'm just not sure which one it is (it may be the cardamom, which I am not very familiar with). Either way, it is a delicious recipe, & it's so nice to be able to make a big batch & have it around for all those chai cravings I have! I can't wait to share it with my mom, who also loves chai but is a diabetic, so she can make the sugar-free version. I also plan on giving some away as Christmas gifts, & I'm sure they'll be a hit! Thanks so much for the recipe!

Excellent Taste! The spice mixture blends very well together.  This chai tea is wonderful to warm up to on chilly evenings. Try using decaffeinated unsweetened tea, you won't taste the difference. The ground cardamom is an expensive spice, but well worth the purchase.

This is a very top quality chai tea mix! You get ALOT of mix for the cost of everything. 36 servings for about ~$17 compared to $4.50 a cup at a local coffee shop. I wouldnt change a thing.

AWESOME chai recipe.  It tastes so smooth & has a delicious honey/spice taste.  This chai is a little spicier than what I have normally encountered from a store-bought mix, but I loved it! You do need to be sure that you grind up the mixture very finely to avoid having grounds in your mug.  I gave this as a gift to my mom & a friend & they loved it, too.

When warm weather arrives, a girl's thoughts turn to iced chai lattes...  I love this mix, it has saved me both money and calories by enabling me to skip Starbucks.  I like my chai very spicy and not too sweet, so I only use 1 C of sugar and use heaping measurements of all the spices, plus 1/2 tsp white pepper, 1 heaping tsp allspice, and 1 tsp anise seed.  Rather than using instant tea, I just use a teabag and add the mix after it's finished steeping.

I've never had Chai tea before so I don't know if mine tastes as it should.  I halved the recipe as I didn't know if I would like it.  I haven't as yet run it through my food processor.  I thought it was already fine but maybe I am wrong.  I just tasted like milk with some spices in it.  I didn't cut down on the sugar but it wasn't very sweet anyway.  I went to a health food store and bought the cardamom by the tablespoonful.  It's much cheaper that way and is much fresher. I didn't add the extra spices because on my copy of the recipe which I printed on 3/21, it didn't mention them.  I will try adding them now.

This stuff is amazing!  I gave it as Christmas gifts and received several requests for the recipe.  I made it according to the recipe and it was perfect!  Just the right amount of everything!  Better than the "spiced tea" recipe of the 70's!

I followed some of the suggestions and cut the sugar back.  I didn't have cardamom on hand so made it without and it is very good.  It had an aftertaste, but I think it was the tea so next time I may just make it without the tea and use tea bags instead.  Overall it is very good!
Update:  Made the mix with the cardamom and brewed tea with Darjeeling tea bags--perfect!

Although I have been an Allrecipes member for quite awhile this is my first review!  I just had to rave about this recipe.  I have made it for the past few years around the holidays to give as gifts and it always turns out great. 

 The only change I make is to leave out the Cardamom only because it is on the pricey side and I do not feel the tea is missing anything without it.  I was not planning on making it this year but my friend who I usually give some to asked me if I was going to make some this year....so I think I will!  It makes a large amount which makes it perfect for gift giving.  I even made this to give as favors at my sister-in-laws baby shower a few years ago.  Packaged in cellophane bags which were super cheap to buy online and added a pretty ribbon and tag.  Make this tea you will not be sorry!

This is awesome! It makes a large batch...great for a gift, but I used most of it for myself! I followed the recipe exactly, but used cardamon seeds that I ground on my own. Next time I will use ground cardamon from the store because it left a funky residue in the bottom of the mug...other than that, FANTASTIC! Thank for the recipe!

This recipe is a 5 as is. Here's how I do it. I only add a couple of things. I mix all the spices (including the extra) in a coffee grinder. Then I mix everything in the food processor. Here's another option: Instead of using all sugar I make a mixture of 2 cups total of sugar, pwd sugar and brown sugar. I like the added dimension it gives. I use both water and milk to make it. then I strain it through cheesecloth to get out all the chunks. Even though I process the spices to pieces They still don't disolve. 
I also use the spice mix and put it in biscotti for a chai biscotti.

This is so comfy cozy good.  Perfect for a cold winters day.  The first time I made it I didnt add the extra spices listed in the headline and it was lovely.  This time I added the extra spices and it just gives it a more umph.  I like it both ways.  Will keep this on hand all year round, living in Alaska you need a good cup of something soothing and hot.  Thanks so much for the recipe!!

This is wonderful!! I make it for Christmas gifts, and my whole family hounds me all year round for more. The only change is I cut the sugar in half. It is just too sweet for some, and individuals can always add more if they want it sweeter.

I'M IN CHAI TEA HEAVEN! I had my first chai tea experience this weekend and became addicted. (Believe it or not, it was a cool, rainy AZ weekend!) Rather than spend another $16 as I have over the past few days, I found this recipe and voila! If I were to do a blind taste test, I honestly would not be able to tell the difference between the cup I'm enjoying this very moment or the other "Famous Drive-Thru" variety.
I did spend the extra for the cardamom and cloves and ended up using 4 tsp of pumpkin pie spice since I forgot to pick up the ginger. (Thanks for the tip, BETTYLYNNI; I used the Splenda instead.) I have a feeling that I will go through this first batch of mix VERY quickly!
Try it yourself and enjoy!!

Super!!  Better than Starbucks since I chose to make it Decaf and it tastes just as good!  By accident I found out you don't even need the powdered milk.  I had all the ingredients but didn't want to buy the big box of p.milk as my gr. store was out of the smaller size.  I assembled the rest using only 1/2 the cardamon to start and 1 C. splenda & 1 C. sugar and it is so good as is, I won't even bother to add the rest.  For me, 1/2 the cardamon was enough.  Thank you for the recipe and now I have no need to fiddle with tea bags anymore.

This is GREAT!  Like everyone else, I dropped the sugar.  I used 1 cup sugar and 1 cup splenda.  

AND GUESS WHAT????  Only 1 Weight Watcher Point!!!!  I can even put a teaspoon of fat free half and half in to keep it at 1 point.  Awesome breakfast drink.

Thanks for the recipe.  I've been using it for a couple of years now, but just realized how little in points it cost me :)

I've been making this recipe often by substituting sugar free ingredients to make this low in calories & fat yet not compromising the wonderful taste!  I use Splenda for the white sugar & Sugar-free French Vanilla coffeemate to reduce the sugar content significantly.

OH...MY...GOSH! I'm sipping it right now and this is AMAZING! Better than anything I've bought in a grocery store. And the only reason it's not better than Starbucks is becase I made this one with water. Will try mixing with milk tomorrow morning for that extra creaminess. Yum! (my food processor worked great - don't bother with the coffee grinder)
Changes: I'm trying to cut calories so I used all non-fat creamers (probably also why mine isn't quite as creamy). I also used Splenda instead of sugar. Can't tell the difference! I cut back to 2 cups of Splenda so I could use some honey without it being too sweet. It's perfect! Also added the white pepper and nutmeg. LOVE IT! I will make this as gifts for Christmas it's SO great.
UPDATE: I made this with milk this morning for a Chai Tea Latte - it's great! Nextime I will cut the sugar even further to 1.5 cups - a little sweet when made with milk.

This is absolutely the best!!! I had been buying a Chai tea mix from World Market on the advise of a friend, but this is much better and cheaper.  I've since sent her this recipe and now she's hooked. Thanks so much for a great recipe.

This is by far the best Chai tea mix i've ever had!! Much better than store bought which I always think is too sweet. I did cut out 1/2 cup of sugar in this recipe for that reason but I followed everything else exactly! Delicious!!

Made it for the teachers, coworkers, and others.  To make it more affordable:
1 tsp Cardamon = 1/2 tsp Nutmeg and 1/2 tsp All Spice.

This substitution is delicious! Also, I thought I could get a huge thing of French Van. Creamer at my big grocery store but not in the powder.  I know that I can get a big thing of it at the club warehouse grocery stores and will buy that there too!

This recipe is very delicious.  I made this with a friend of mine and we are giving them out as Christmas gifts.  We made the recipe as directed and it came out great.  We did find that using a coffee grinder rather than a food processor works better.  It takes a little longer because my grinder didn't hold much mix, but it does make the texture more like powder.

Excellent taste!  1.5 cups of sugar is plenty instead of the 2.5 cups that the recipe asks for.  I also added 1 tsp. nutmeg and allspice and 1/2 tsp. white pepper and ground cardamom (instead of the 1 tsp of cardamom) per other reviewers.  I used all French vanilla powdered non-dairy creamer so that I wouldn't have to buy two containers.

This is wonderful!  I finished the first batch off in 2 weeks & made 2 more batches last night.  With one of them I added 1/4 cup coco as suggested above & it was perfect.  Everyone I've given it to has loved it.

Great taste & easy to make.
At first the tea was a bit gritty, but I took only the spices first & ground them up really fine then added the rest of the ingredients. Not so gritty anymore. Using a coffee grinder for the spices is best.

Just made this and we love it!  I followed some other suggestions: used 2 cups instant milk, used 1 cup brown sugar and 1  cup splenda which made it nice and sweet, used the extra spices like white pepper and freshly ground nutmeg.  Sent some to work with my husband and they all want the recipe now!

I made this and gave it for Christmas gifts this year, it was a huge hit. I added the note on the tag of instructions about adding 1t. nutmeg, allspice and 1/4 white pepper if they so desired.  Will be a keeper in this household.

I really did not like this.  I give it three stars because I don't have a lot to compare it with.  Too sweet, not enough tea mix.  Thankfully I cut the recipe in half.  Expensive ingredients for not liking it too well, but followed recipe exactly.  It IS better with milk than water, I agree.
Thanks though, Jo.

I am not an experienced chai tea drinker.  I've only had a few cups in my life, and it was made using a "home-made" mix similar to this one.  I decided to give this recipe a try.  It is pretty good, but I found that the spices were a little too much for my taste.  Next time, I will reduce the ginger to 1 tsp., omit the white pepper, and reduce the cardamom to 1/2 tsp.  This might not make it "authentic," but I think I will like it better.  My recommendation:  If you are trying the recipe for the first time, I think it would be best to make a quarter batch.  See if the spices and tea and creamer ratio are to your tastes.  If not, you've only wasted 1/4 the ingredients that I did!  If I can get up the guts to pitch this out (I hate wasting money!), I will try it again with my revisions and am confident I would rate it 5 stars!

THANK YOU so much to the previous reviewers for all of their helpful remarks. I used Splenda & nonfat or sugar free powdered creamers. I LOVE this chai mix. I would also suggest adding all the optional spices. It takes a good minute in the blender to get the mixture into a fine powder. I especially love the french vanilla flavor to it. This tastes very good with hot milk. Can't wait for the holidays as it will make great gifts!! Thank you so much, Jo!!!

This tastes wonderful. The cardamom was a little expensive, but well worth the price. I gave this in gift baskets as something a little different from the usual jams or cookies and everyone couldn't wait to try it. I skipped the dry milk (don't like the taste)and added 1/4 tsp pepper. In the directions I gave to people, I told them to combine 1 cup of milk and 1 cup of water, heat, and stir in 3 tbsp of the mix. Thank you for the recipe!

Holy Moly this is good! I made 4 batches of this, packaged it up in 3/4 c. (5 serving) bags and sold it at an office craft fair. I sold out AND had re-orders! A definite keeper. Try using Pampered Chef Cinnamon Plus spice blend in place of the cinnamon. It has allspice, nutmeg and orange peel in it. Made it a little more complex.

This recipe is great!  To make this drink more light, try using Splenda instead of sugar, and try using fat-free/lot-fat non-dairy creamers instead of regular creamers.

My teenagers thought it was better than Pacific Chai.  Will make more for gifts. Might add more milk mix and less sugar. Great beverage!

I am very pleased with the outcome of this recipe.  I agree with another post, I would add more instant tea since I like everything strong (tea, coffee, whatever).  It was a little too milky for me.  I also used decaf tea, splenda and lite creamer.  I just want to say that some other posts mentioned the mess it made in the blender.  I had no problems whatsoever.  It really was a breeze.  In fact, I was so into blending it I made it into a veryyyy fine powder.  The flavor is nice and smooth.  I would like to figure out how to make it thicker bodied, not so thin.  Overall, very enjoyable.

This is pretty darn good! The only other chai I'd ever had was the Tazo liquid concentrate. This is almost as good (why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars). I made some minor changes on my second batch - 1.5 cups creamer and 0.5 cups French Vanilla Creamer (I'm not real fond of vanilla) instead of 1 and 1, 0.5 tsp white pepper instead of 0.25. I used pumpkin pie spice (as I saw recommended elsewhere), and - most important - I added 0.25 cup cocoa powder. Voila! Mocha Chai!

Oh, this is just too good for words.   Thanks!!!

I made this low carb by substituting Splenda granular for the sugar.  This is by far better than anything I've gotten out at a coffee shop.  My daughter is hooked.

I think this is a great chai mix.  I used all the ingredients it called for except for the vanilla creamer, I opted to use pure vanilla extract added to my sugar instead (which by the way, I cut down to only 2 cups).  I think it gave it a great flavor but I'm about ready to add more creamer to the mix because I think it's lacking cream.  I also, for the life of me, couldn't find where it said how much white pepper to use, so I used about a teaspoon of it, even though in the back of my head I thought 1/2 teaspoon would be plenty.  I should have listened to the little voice inside my head because this came out kinda spicy, hopefully when I add more creamer the spiciness will subside!  I also added 1 teaspoon of allspice.  Oh and by the way, I found Ground Cardamom at Big Lots for 99 cents a bottle.  I'm not sure how much it is at the store since I couldn't find it at a couple of stores I went to.  I wouldn't skimp out on any of the products it calls for.  I think they are all essential parts of the mix.  After I was done blending it (I used my blender and had no problems), I had about 5 cups of powdered mix.  I'm sure if I would have added the vanilla creamer it would have added just a little more.  (BTW, I would say this is very similar to Tastefully Simple's Chai.)  Thanks for the great recipe Jo!  I cannot wait to pass it on to others!!!

Yum! I bought all my ingredients in bulk to save money, especially cardamom. You can find it in some bulk spice sections and most natural food sections at a fraction of the cost and it is an essential ingredient! I made the vanilla sugar instead of the flavored creamer and added the additional spices. The white pepper adds a little "heat" that lingers on your tongue which I loved. I think you could add hot milk instead of water for a more full bodied flavor and a food processor is way more effective than a blender to grind the mixture! Over all this is wonderful, easy and makes a lovely gift!

Love this!  I substituted 1 and 1/2 cup of sweetener for the sugar, and left out the cardamon (too pricey for the limited amount I need - will add for the next batch).  I also used sugar free creamers as well.  If I did the math correctly - each cup is now about 50 calories.....versus over 300 at the famous coffee place.  WINNER!

This is wonderful, and the spice mix with pepper and nutmeg is PERFECT - one of the best I have ever had. I will make up some of the spice mix to use every day with my own brewed tea. I reduced the sugar as suggested by earlier reviewers, because most Chai mixes are too sweet for me. I made vanilla sugar with one cup of granulated sugar, instead of the vanilla creamer. Rather than try to whir all the powder, instead I used a little coffee/spice grinder and put the spices (including the nutmeg and black pepper) in there with 1/2 cup of the vanilla sugar and powdered it all. That worked very well, and really opened up the flavors and heat of the spices. Two thumbs up!

I've made this recipe a few times. The cardamom is a bit pricey so I used nutmeg instead and the tea tastes wonderful. However, I noticed the taste can slightly vary based on the brand and quality of the ingredients you use.  So, for your same great taste always use the same brand ingredients each time you make it. This is a great recipe!

This is the best mix! I just love it. I've never used cardamum, instead I use nutmeg and I think it's a good alternative.  I mix it up real well and feel blending it in a blender isn't necessary. It's always came out beautifully as it is. This as well as Russian tea will always be my go to drink in the winders!

I usually buy Dunkin Donuts' Vanilla Chai Tea, but lately it doesn't have that chai taste.  It just tastes like sweetened vanilla tea.  After finding and trying this recipe, I'm in heaven!!  I followed the recipe w/o making any changes to it except for cutting recipe in half.  I prefer to make a batch here and there so as not to have the chai tea mixture go stale.  I prepared it with my 'bullet' appliance, and it came out to a nice very fine powdery texture.  I will try it next with a small Cusinart processor to see if there is consistency with the texture compared to the 'bullet'.  Now, I rarely go to Dunkin Donuts to have there mixture b/c mine tastes much better!  Thank you, Joe, for this wonderful recipe.

I really like this recipe. I doubled the batch, so i'm very relieved. I may add a little extra tea for my personal drinks, but i think everyone will love this tea. Also, i'm happy to have a use for my jar of cardamom. It's very expensive and it normally goes to waste because i can't find a small jar.

This is Excellent!!  I made it exactly as written and it came out perfect-just the right amount of spices.  I splurged for the cardamom and I'm glad I did ($12 for a small jar-ouch!). One batch filled three 1-pint ball jars.  My husband insisted that we keep a jar in the pantry at all times.  The only change I would recommend is to use 3 Tablespoons of mix per mug instead of 2 and add a little milk (as you would for regular tea).

I made this mix to give as Christmas presents as I had tried it before without adding the extra spices.
This time I bought green cardamom pods and got the seeds out myself and added a tsp. allspice and pepper corns that I ground as well.
Put everything into the coffee/spice grinder and it only took 5 min. to grind the whole batch down perfectly.
I then frothed my own milk by shaking a half full jar of 2% for 30 sec. and then putting it in the microwave for another 30 sec. 
It was just as good if not better than Starbucks which I love.
I might have a hard time giving it away now that I have tried it. Oh well, I can always make another batch.

Good base recipe for an instant Chai latte to send to my dirt poor sister at college! I'm not a big fan of those non-dairy coffee creamers, so I left them out. Instead, I did use the suggested vanilla-sugar mixture and just some extra powdered milk for creaminess; served with warm milk instead of water. 1 cup of sugar is plenty. I used black pepper instead of white because that's what I had on hand. Adjusted spices to my taste: less cloves, more ginger, cardamom, and pepper. It's still on the mild side. Maybe next time I'll add ground star anise.

My friend had mentioned that she stopped drinking coffee, and she bought a mix of chocolate chai drink. She said it wasn't very good. That's when I decited to make this recipe! It was so expensive to purchase the ingredients, but worth it!! I also used all non dairy creamer because my friend is dairy free. Also coffee mate makes sweetened origional creamer, so I used only 1 cup of that , and 2 cups of original coffee creamer. No sugar also becsuse my friend also is eliminating sugar from her diet. This makes it very enjoyable, and all the spices come through perfectly! Thx!

I have been looking for quite some time for an affordable alternative to the pricey coffee house chai drinks I love so much, so I had really high hopes when I came across this recipe with all the glowing reviews.  One taste was all I needed of this blend, unfortunately.  I think the spices used are good, but the measurements were definitely off.  I couldn't tell if it was the cloves or the cardamom, but either way it was just too overpowering and left a horrible taste in my mouth.  Also, the 2 1/2 cups of sugar was way too much.  I felt like I wasted a lot of ingredients making this recipe and do regret trying it.

This mix is even better when made with milk! I add the nutmeg, allspice and white pepper. I use Splenda instead of sugar to save on calories.  I dump it all into my food processor at once and blend until it's the right consistency. Lovely winter pick-me-up.

I liked the idea of this recipe, but it required quite a bit of tweaking to get it to my taste. There was too much sugar, and not enough spice.  I didn't add the pepper, but I did add the nutmeg and allspice. Also, half again as much of the other spices as called for, 1/2 cup less of sugar, and 1/2 cup more of creamer.  I mix it with fat free milk instead of water.

I was trying to replicate the taste of Trader Joe's chai tea mix, as I love it and can't afford it. I couldn't get the french vanilla creamer, but stirred a little vanilla extract into my drink. My roommate and I are hooked now! It's really nice to come home after classes and have a cup of chai.

Just finished making this and having my first cup. I mixed 1 tablespoon of vanilla with 1 1/2 cups sugar the night before and let it sit all night.

I added some nutmeg to the mix (I'm not sure how much because I was playing with a new spice grinder and it was mixed in with the cardamom) and some star anise. I forgot to get some white pepper so I did add a little black pepper.

I did NOT use the vanilla flavored creamer.

I prefer making this with some hot milk instead of just water. I think it is still plenty sweet with the cutting the sugar. Will definitely enjoy it this winter!

I love this recipe! I made this for Christmas presents last year and it was a big hit. I  keep it on hand all the time, as I am not a coffee drinker.  
The extra spices are essential.  I cut the sugar back by 1/4 cup. I've cut back a 1/2 cup before, and it was very noticeable, i haven't done that again! I add vanilla extract to sugar and dry it, then blend everything in my food processor.  It does create a fine mist of tea in my kitchen, but it's not terrible.  Overall, delicious.

I made half of the recipe using decaf instant tea and all low-fat or no-fat ingredients.  The recipe called for 1-1/4 cups of sugar for 18 servings.  Based on the reviews, I used a little less than 1 cup of Splenda, and it was still too sweet for my taste.  Next time, I will try 2/3 cup of Splenda and add more if necessary.  I liked the spicy flavor of this mix.

first of all this recipe makes way too much...if u don't end up liking it what a waste! second its not that great. If I had tasted it from someone that made it for me I would not ask for it again. It has the spice which is nice but the other flavors aren't working for me, now I am stuck drinking something that is so so.

I cut the sugar down to just 2 cups, used scant tsp. of ground cloves, scant half tsp. of cardamom, and added in about 1/4 cup of organic cacao powder.  The result was a heavenly concoction that even my youngest kids ask for on cold winter days!  Yum!

I love this recipe.  I've been asked for the recipe several times and given it for Christmas presents.  I do think it is way to sweet as written, so I only use 1 cup sugar, which to me tastes much better.

I had Chai latte at the bakery/coffee shop down the street from me, and I was hooked.  I wanted to be able to make it myself (budgets, you know).  This mix is just terrific!  Just the flavor I was looking for.  I made 1/4 of a batch just to check the flavor without a huge investment.  It was just what I was looking for.  Even hubby (who hadn't had chai before) loved it.  Thanks!

Nothing compares to real chai tea with sugar and a bit of cream, in my book, but this is tasty and very simple to prepare. I made this once exactly as directed and found it excessively sweet, so I used just 2 cups sugar the second time around and prefer it. If you leave the seasoning out, it is highly reminiscent of classic pearl milk tea -- I'm going to buy some tapioca pearls so I can make boba tea in my own home!

I ended up using 3 c. sugar total in a triple batch and that was perfect. (I used 2 1/2 c. in the first batch and that was way too sweet, so I made more batchez to make it better.)

Clearly the reviews on this recipe speak for itself.  I make it as directed, adding the allspice but not the nutmeg or pepper.  I also use 1.5 cups white sugar and 1 cup Splenda.  I have made this several times, and once made the dreadful mistake of accidentally using vanilla caramel creamer instead of the french vanilla - yuck!  So take my advice and make sure you grab the right bottle :)  Hopefully the people I'm giving it to for Christmas will love it as much as I do!

Excellent flavor, super easy to make. Went together and in jars in less than 20 minutes. I mixed it in my food processor and it worked fine on the mix setting, but one cup is about all I'd put in at a time. It makes a ton of dust, even with the lid on the chute. My mix yielded about 3 pint jars. One change I did make was 1/2 cup less sugar...I figured I'd try that suggestion and I'm glad I did. It's just sweet enough with 2 cups. I think you could easily make this with fat free creamer and Splenda or a Splenda/sugar combination for a lower calorie option. Next time I may try using vanilla infused sugar. This would make an excellent craft fair product, year-round hostess gift, Christmas gift, or even a get well gift.

I made a sugar free version of this using splenda and along with others, I agree, a bit on the sweet side, definitely will make again, but will cut back on sweetner.  Excellent treat for a sugar free decaf tea!

I'm glad I found this recipe.  We really like it, and it's less expensive than the discs I've bought for our coffee maker. I did not have cardamom so did not add it, but followed the recipe otherwise.  I was skeptical about the food processor step but after realized how important it was. 7/7/12 update-  I made this with hot water, let it cool a little, added ice and had a great iced chai tea!

This is awesome!  I could only find decaf instant tea and even though I put everything through a coffee grinder I still had residue, but I don't care; it was still awesome.  I halved the sugar (used Ideal) and upped the spices half again except for the cloves, allspice, nutmeg and pepper.  It was perfect!  Thank you, Jo!!

This mix is over the top!!  I did not add any sugar and use a sweet and low in each cup.  Check at your health food store for the cardamom.  You can usually purchase only what you need, not a whole bottle.

I love this mix. I tweaked it by reducing the sugar to 2 c. and using other flavor creamers such a carmel, hazelnut and pumpkin pie spice.

This is great we made for gifts for my daughters teachers and friends last Christmas. This year she is in college and wants to take some back with her after the break for all of her friends. Great treat to send to college students who don't have much money for treats like this. Try the gunline coffee too!

Sooo yummy and easy to make! I altered this recipe. I only used 2 cups of sugar and I used a tea bag instead of the instant tea. I also did not use the cardamom because I couldn't find it in our tiny grocery store.

I made a sugarless version of this so I could add my own sweetener.  I didn't have cardamom, but I did have a jar of garam masala, so I dumped in a couple tablespoons of it as well, figuring I'd get the cardamom that way.  Delicious!

i made a container of this for my boyfriend last valentine's day and he's been utterly addicted since. i definitely recommend adding the tsp of nutmeg and tsp of allspice that Jo suggests in the comment at the top of the page, it makes it all the more delicious. i use 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper instead of the suggested white pepper for a bit of a kick.

I love this recipe! I omitted the cardamom after reading other reviews and because its so expensive. I also used 1 cup of sugar and 1 1/2 cups of Splenda. I made this as a gift for my mother in law and my sister in law for Christmas. I think they will love it!

Made a batch of this today...it's awesome!!!  After reading a lot of the reviews, the only spices I made adjustments on were the cloves (not overly fond of it) and cardamom - I only used half the amounts called for.  I also used the coffee grinder...GREAT IDEA!  I made a  cup with the finished product and found that I needed more of a "tea" flavor...so, I just threw a regular tea bag in the mug for a couple minutes and it did the trick!  I almost left out the cardamom entirely because of the price, but I found a jar at World Market for only $2.99.  Walmart had it for $10.  The next time I make this, I think I'll leave out the instant tea and just steep a tea bag in the mug...I also think I'll make it more figure friendly and use Splenda.  I can't wait to give this out for Christmas!!!

I am enjoying a mug of "Chai" right now. :)  I don't used processed foods or dried milk products and can't have caffeine, so I modified a bit.  I decided to just make a Chai spice mix, then I can add to whatever suits my fancy. :)  I used half the sugar (I was only going to make half a recipe at first), then went for the full size on the spices (including the ones in the header) - and blended it all to a powder.  It turned out to be just the right ratio for me.  For the tasty mug I'm drinking now - I dissolved 3 heaping teaspoons of the mix in half a mug of boiling water, and topped it all off with heavy whipping cream.   Very yummy and just the thing for a bedtime snack. :)

used only 1/2 sugar. Excellent!  Loved the spice.  Ignored recommendations to run it through a coffee grinder first and regret thta - had "silt" in the bottom of the mug.  Will do it next time!

This chai tea mix is wonderful. I have made many batches and everyone that tastes it says it is just as good as any store bought brand. Changes I made: Used 2 cups non-dairy creamer instead of one cup vanilla (the vanilla made it a little to sweet), For spice added 1 tsp of Aniseed & 1/2 tsp of white ground pepper. If you want this extra rich tasting try using hot milk instead of water.

A super nice instant Chai Latte recipe.  The first time, I made the recipe exact.  The second time, however, I tweeked it a little based on my own personal preference.  I reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups since I don't like my Chai very sweet.  I also added a little more unsweetened instant tea, ginger and cardamom, then added 1 tsp. allspice and 1/2 tsp. white pepper.  Plan on giving as gifts ~ Yum!

This mix came out excellent - I have tried many different mixes for Chai teas and they are usually not worth the money or all of the dirty equipment, dishes, and silverware.  This is one of the best!  :)  FIVE STARS!

I love this recipe.  I started making if 2 months ago.  I took it to work and now everyone wants the recipe.  Instead of sugar I used Splenda and dried the vanilla in it.  I added 1 tsp nutmeg, 1 tsp allspice and 1/2 tsp white pepper.  I ran all ingredients through my food processor several times. After reading the reviews I am thinking of trying the coffee grinder the next time I make up a batch.  For those like me who should stay away from cafiene, by decaf tea mix.  Yummm I am addicted to this tea.

Made this as a Christmas stocking stuffer for my college age son, so that he would have a fast and easy hot drink available in his dorm.  He can't afford too many Starbucks runs...  He loved it!  Followed the recipe exactly and ground the ingreients in my blender.  Worked really well and made a lot.  I'll be making more with the leftover ingredients soon.  Thanks for a great gift idea!

I made this and it is delicious. I followed as directed except the French vanilla creamer. I use vanilla extract and sugar.. let in it air dry. I did put some black pepper in it.. a couple of twists with the pepper grinder. I use a coffee grinder set at espresso speed to blend the ingredients. It takes a little more time than blender.  It doesn't a tons of stuff at the bottom. Thanks

Ok, I have made this recipe without the powdered creamer idea. I usually use milk and boil the tea in a small saucepan with a cinnamon stick. I usually add some vanilla and use half sugar half honey to sweeten. The first review says cardamom is an expensive spice and to grind it yourself, but they sell it already ground and it's no more expensive than any other spice in the spice aisle of the grocery store. I also use less cardamom than what is usually called for because it is over powering and has a slight after taste. Anyway, sorry I am rating without following this recipe to a T, but I am very excited to try with the milk powder and two kinds of powdered creamer!!

YUMMY! I made this for my kids' teachers for Christmas. Of course I had to taste it first to make sure it was as good as all the raves claimed and now I have to make another batch! I made it just as written with the extra spices (not the pepper though) and sub'd the vanilla creamer with the vanilla/sugar recommended in the footnotes. Brilliant! I am going to be making this a lot! I want to try it with stevia next. Thanks sooooooo much!

I live in New Zealand and couldn't find non-dairy creamer (vanilla flavoured or otherwise), or instant tea. Not even at the international groceries or the bulk food places -- maybe it's just a North American thing? So I worked around it and am really happy with my substitutions! Stir 1t vanilla into 2C sugar until it's completely blended in. If you have time, spread the vanilla sugar out on a baking tray and allow it to dry for a few hours, then crumble it up with your fingers or in your food processor. But in a pinch you can use it immediately, it just might make the final mixture go a little bit stiff. Sift a 50g packet of coconut cream powder into the sugar (you have to sift this or it will come out in lumps). Add 2C full fat/regular instant milk powder (creamier than skim milk powder). Then add all the spices including 1t nutmeg, 1t allspice and 1/2t white pepper (gives it a lovely bite but not at all spicy). Just make a regular mug of tea and add the mixture -- yum! For my taste, you do need at least 2 tablespoons of the mix for each mug of tea.

I love it!  Thanks so much for the wonderful recipe!  I was surprised to find that I liked it better made with water.

Delicious!  This is a perfect cold weather drink.  I cut the sugar down to 1 & 1/2 cups & omitted the cardamom & it tastes perfect to me!  I think I'll whip up a batch for some stocking stuffers while I am at it!

Best ever! My daughter says it's even better than Panera. Made this to share at work. Everyone had to have the recipe. I made mine with sugar free everything and nobody could even tell.

This recipe is fantastic!  I followed it almost as is... I chose to add vanilla to the sugar and omitted the french vanilla powdered non-dairy creamer in order to keep costs down a little more.  Also, in Canada I'm not even sure if you can get instant tea.  If you can, I've never seen it nor do I understand the point of it since tea takes only a moment to steep.  Instead, I did what another reviewer suggested and steeped a cup of tea the old fashioned way and added in the powdered mix.  It was fantastic and considering how much this recipe makes, it's definitely worth the cost of everything involved, cardamom and all.  Will make it again as soon as I run out.

I like the flavor lots just the way it is, but there is way too much sugar in it for my liking (and I like my regular tea sweet) I think that I will cut the sugar down by a whole cup next time and add more from there if I think it needs it. I will make it again, though!

This recipe is fabulous.  With snow falling outside and the temperture in the 30 degree range for the day, this tea just warms the body.  I mixed up a recipe today, following the suggestions above the recipe.  I also added a 1 1/2 teaspoons of pumpkin spice since the coffee shop I visit has a chai that tastes like "pumpkin pie in a cup". Thank you for sharing this recipe.  I no longer have to pay $4 for a mug of chia.

FANTASTIC!!! I was in love with Tastefully Simple Chai Tea Mix, but that could break the bank in a hurry, so I searched for a recipe that would be similiar and this is better! Instead of buying two different creamers I used two cups of the French Vanilla (sugar free) creamer.

WOW~this is REALLY tasty! It makes a bunch so I gave some away to friends. They all raved about it. My hubby and I are trying to replace coffee w/this. I think after trying this recipe, we won't have a problem! Good mixed in water but even better mixed in milk!

I love this mix.  I decrease the sugar by at least half.  Instead of using vanilla creamer, I add vanilla extract to the sugar and let it dry before putting it in the coffee grinder.  I grind all the spices first, to make them as fine as possible, and then grind everything together.  I double the mix and triple the spices to make it spicy enough.  I don't use the cardamom, but I add the white pepper, nutmeg, and allspice.  It's a winter staple, as I detest coffee.  Sometimes I make it iced by filling the cup only halfway with boiling water and adding slightly more mix than for the full cup.  I let the spices steep and then add ice until it is cold.  Just as tasty, but good for a warm day.

I used Splenda instead of sugar and cut it down to 2 cups.  I added all of the spices as dictated by the recipe plus the extra allspice and nutmeg and it was amazing.  I didn't add the pepper as I wasn't too keen on it since it was my first time making it.  I also used fat free skim milk powder and it worked out great.  I didn't have a coffee grinder so I used my magic bullet and it grinded well enough.  The only issue I have is that the tea floats around - next time I will mix everything but have tea bags instead.  Enjoy!

This tastes just like the powdered chai latte mix that you can buy in the grocery store. I changed two things. First, I only used 1 1/2 C sugar. Second, I did not use any cardamom. I didn't have any and did not want to spend that kind of money for a spice. The flavor is perfect for me.

Too yummy. Like many others, we made it as Christmas gifts in mason jars. To save money I did the recommended adding vanilla to sugar and skipped the vanilla-flavored creamer.  I did spring for the cardamom, however--it's just not chai tea without it.

Thank you for the wonderful Chai recipe.  My whole family loved it.  My husband and I even mix it in our morning coffee sometimes.  I did cut the sugar down about a 1/2C per other reviewers suggestions.  We like a lot of flavor and the spice amount is perfect, so be careful not to add too many extras.  I wouldn't suggest skipping the cardamom, I think thats what makes Chai taste like...Chai.  There are other good recipes to try on this site that call for cardamom so I think you could easily use it again.  I made Kulfi(as a dessert with my Indian menu) and it was really good and used cardamom.

What an amazing recipe! I've been to India and had Chai tea this recipe is so close, it makes me think I'm still there! I added the nutmeg, allspice, and white pepper it adds an authentic kick! Make sure you do put it thought the food processor, I didn't with the first batch and did with the second what a difference it came out creamy and oh so yummy! I'm also making it for Christmas presents this year!

My DD has decided she likes chai tea.  She gave this 5 stars and thumbs up.  Cardamon is crazy expensive.... but I thought this would probably still be cheaper (and better)than a store bought mix.

Definitely a hit with everyone! Very authentic and not "powdered-milky" tasting like others I've had. I bagged it up in little cups and packaged it up with homemade cinnamon rolls as a Christmas Breakfast present for my friends!

This is delicious!  I used the extra spices and I followed the recipe exactly.  I did not use the cardamom however because you can't get it in my little town and I was to impatient to wait for it to be shipped to me (via online)!!  But I will be getting some for my next batch.  This does make a lot, but thats good because I like to enjoy 1-2 cups of this a day, mixed with hot milk.  I  am planning on making more to give as christmas gifts too!  Do make sure that if you use a blender, to mix it really well.  I spent a long time mixing it, so it got nice and fine, and it dissolves nicely and is not gritty.

I really enjoyed this mixed with warm milk.  I did as the author suggested and added the nutmeg and allspice.  I plan to add the white pepper when I buy some.  Only down side is that this made a ton and now I have leftover instant tea and dry milk that I'm not sure what to do with.

WOW... I dont even like chai tea cuz I dont really like tea that has a sort of spice flavor to it, but I made it for my friend who loves Chai Tea. I had some left over after gift wrapping it and what not, so i decided to try some...and to my suprise I actually really liked it! This recipe made a believer out of me... I'll be drinking more chai tea, but I'm not going to lie I'll still be hesitant to order it at our local coffee shop. Im very particular about my drinks, but anyways this stuff is AWESOME! Great taste and flavor. Not too overpowering. And I like the fact that by making your own chai you can decide how strong you want the tea or spices to be in your drink.  (I did everything the same except I replaced the vanilla creamer by adding 2teaspoons of vanilla to the sugar and then added 1 cup of regular creamer in its place) Once again this recipe was wonderful. THANK YOU

Yummy!

I altered the recipe to my taste (using decaf tea and half the amount of sugar and cloves) and even though I forgot to buy the cardamom I couldn't be happier with this tea!

Great recipe.  I made it just like the recipe says. This is my first time trying Chai Tea.  I love this stuff and I hate tea.  At least I did until now.  I made some for my mother and left out the cinnamon because she can't drink it and even that was good.  I am going to keep this mix on hand.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This is THE one Ive been looking for. I made it with everything except less sugar ans put the vanilla extract into the sugar. We dont have vanilla creamer in Australia that I know of. We also drink it as a frappe. 2/3 ice to 1/3 skim milk with 2 tablespoons of the mix. Wizz in the blender, top with low fat whipped cream, sprinkle with chocolate and dahdah!!. Just like the cafe only $$$ cheaper and much easier to indulge. Thanks for a great mix.

Awesome... I adore this mix. I do think it tastes better with a bit less sugar and mixed with milk instead of water.

My mother was a HUGE fan of the Dunkin Donuts chai tea.  They recently discontinued this recipe and she has been going through withdrawal.  We just made this version and both agree *as we sit here drinking it* that it is just as yummy as the Dunkin Donuts one...Yum!! Thank you!!!

Absolutely the best chai tea mix!!!  I've made this for numerous people this Christmas season and all have given it rave reviews and asked for the recipe!  I found Cardamom a lot less expensive at a World Market store.
The only change I made to the recipe is that I reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and used decaf instant tea.

I don't think a chai mix recipe could hit much closer.  I TRIPLED the recipe and was able to fill 12 half-pint Ball jars and still had about 2c left for myself.  I reduced the amount of sugar and only slightly reduced the amount of cardamom.  I used an entire 15oz pkg of french vanilla creamer (not quite 3 c) and made up the rest with the regular. Thanks for posting this... it is a much needed addition to my recipe box!

The first time I made the recipe I had to use the lemon flavored instant tea because the store I was at didn't carry anything else. That batch came out sweet and didn't look good because it separated from the water and wouldn't stay mixed. Today I made another batch with the correct instant tea and found it to come out perfect! Although I must say I did use 1.5 cups of sugar instead of 2.5, I had a feeling it would be too sweet for me, and I have to say I think I was right. My husband liked it so much he stole my cup!! And our apartment has a nice vanilla smell :) Bonus!

This recipe is fantastic!  I used slightly about half of the nutmeg,allspice, and white pepper, and it came out tasting as good or better than my favorite brands of chai.  I think I calculated that it cost about $3.00 or $3.50 to make the entire batch, which yields easily 3x as much as those little $4 cans in the store.

This is delicious!  I used about 2 cups of sugar and would use a little less next time.  Also, make sure you like the flavor of the Cardamom before you use the full amount.  I like Cardamom but was surprised at how much you could taste the flavor in the final product.

Excellent recipe.  I love this mix b/c it's much cheaper per serving than any commercial mix and tastes better too.  I did leave out the cardomon due to the high cost, but did add allspice instead and the white pepper as suggested by another member. I also reduced the cloves by half since some members believed it to be a little overpowering.  I figured it would be easier to add than to remove later. I'm storing it in an air tight, decorative cannister on the counter top for easy access.  I also plan to make a few batches to give as gifts for the holidays.  I may even try a batch with Splenda for the diabetics in my family.

My aunt gave this out last year for gifts and once it started getting cold out I couldn't help but make a batch myself.  I make mine decaf so I can have a cup a night to help me relax and warm up!

Wow.  I made this to hand out as gifts and decided to try it for myself.  Pleasantly surprised since I've never had it.  My husband who doesn't like hot teas tried it too and he said it "wasn't bad".  I cut the cloves to 1/2 teaspoon but left everything else the same.  I think the gift receivers will enjoy this drink.

Fantastic, easy, tasty recipe! Plus it's a whole lot cheaper to make it than buy it.  By making it myself, I can use decaf tea which I prefer.  I cut the cardamon in half and added a teaspoon of anise which gives it the scent and flavor I like.  This makes a wonderful gift during the holidays!

This was very good. I just finished my first cup of it. I couldn't find unsweetened instant tea so I just left it out. I used splenda instead of regular sugar, but used the normal  non dairy creamer and the normal french vanila flavored non dairy creamer (not the without sugar kind).  Per mug, I calculated that there are 39 calories and 1 gram of fat- that isn't that bad. The price is suprising- very cheap per mug.

i love chai tea & this recipe replaced my pricey Big Train chai mix. I used less sugar & all of the spices- YUMMMY! 

I make mine ICED CHAI tea- 
Dissolve 3 TBL spoons chai mix with 3-4 oz hot water in a tall glass. Fill with ice cubes and a splash of milk. 
So refreshing!!!
Thank you :)

I used all the spices including the extra ones and I've mixed it hot and cold, with milk, with water, with a mixture of both, and I've even added a bit of chocolate syrup to the cup after it's mixed. It's just fantastic. Everyone at work loves it and lines up at my desk in the morning for their cup of Chai! THANK YOU! This recipe is definitely a KEEPER!

My husband and I love Spiced Chai, but only drink it occasionally because the brand I buy has 140 calories.  With this recipe I was able to use Decaf tea, fat free creamer, sugar free French vanilla creamer, and substituted Splenda for the sugar.  Very good.  We will be drinking more spiced chai and less coffee.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was an excellent mix.  I made it with decaf tea and Splenda.  Any of you in Weight Watchers...it is 2 points for a 16 oz cup.  I also added 1 teaspoon of ground anise.

This recipes is great.  If you are looking for an even faster way to make it, I recommend using pumpkin pie spice (4-5 teaspoons) instead of all the other things.  It really has about all the same things in it. It is an awesome recipe as is though.

I gave this as a gift at Christmas and everyone asked for the recipe.  It is wonderful!  I recommend mixing it with 1/2 water and 1/2 milk so it's a bit creamier.  I'm sipping it even as I write this.  Delicious!

This is wonderful!  I didn't have the regular non-dairy creamer so I used all French Vanilla.  I also added the optional spices except for the white pepper.  I didn't have any cardamom on hand so, instead of buying it at the grocery store, I went to a food co-op because they sell spices in bulk so I could get just what I needed.  The cost difference was $10 for a small jar at the grocery store compared to $.40 at the co-op.

I was very pleased with this recipe! I followed the recipe except for the cardamom, which I didn't have on hand and it is so expensive... so I just replaced with allspice and nutmeg to equal the equivalent of the cardamom. This has a very nice flavor and dissolved well. I may add a tad LESS sugar, but other than that this recipe is PERFECT! Thank you so much.

I found the spices very overpowering and I absolutely love Chai. Perhaps fiddling with the amounts of each spice is the key. Until then I am off to Starbucks for my Chai!

Excellent. I've made it the original way and substituting Splenda for the sugar. Both went over very well with my family and the dozen (or so) teenagers that regually congregate at our house.

I don't think this tastes anything like the store bought Chai, but it is still quite delicious.  The real plus of this recipe is that it can be made diet friendly with fat-free/low-fat/sugar-free ingredients.

I made this recipe to give as a gift.  I purchased a coffee grinder with multiple settings to grind the mix before giving.  I used the fine setting and it worked wonderfully.  There was som residue in the cut, however I didn't think it was much more than I had from my store bought mix.  Today I received a request for the recipe, so now I am sure it was a huge hit.

A friend of mine recently turned me on to Chai tea and I love it. I decided to try out this recipe and compare it to some of the powdered mixes I purchase at the store. I loved it! I did reduce the sugar to 1-1/2 cups however, based on several of the other reviews. Next time I may reduce the ginger to 1 tsp. as it was a bit strong. I gave a container of this mix to my friend at her holiday party and I can't wait to see what she thinks. Great recipe!

I thought this was a great recipe. Gave away a lot for small Christmas gifts and have been asked for the recipe from everyone. Some like to add it to coffee, but most like it "straight"

Wonderful recipe. I'm not a big tea drinker and I made a batch of this with all intentions to give it as Christmas gifts. Since tasting it, I have drank all of my original batch, made another batch to have on hand for myself and have made one batch for Christmas gifts (but I've already drank half of it). I used Splenda in place of sugar, or I would weigh 400 pounds by now. Great stuff!!

This truly does taste like the expensive coffee house chai tea!  And, it tastes identical to a wonderful and very pricey chai tea I've purchased from a home party-plan gourmet foods company.  I'm planning to try blending the chai tea mix with some milk and ice for an iced chai which should be delicious.  DEFINITELY try this recipe!!

What a GREAT recipe and money saver from other brands! A small group of friends get together every few months and make up a few batches at a time. We  double the cinnamon and blend the tea before mixing it w/ the other ingredients and blend again. It seems to dissolve better.

This was very, very good.  I didn't have the French vanilla creamer or non-dairy creamer so I just used 2 cups of milk powder and then substituted 1/2 cup of vanilla sugar for part of the sugar.  I also ground 1 tsp of cardamom when I blended everything together.  Yum.

Following others' advice, I only used half the sugar called for.  The cardamom is definitely a must.  It has the true chai flavor.  It's quite expensive, but luckily I was able to get my 1 tsp from an Indian friend.  I also added nutmeg, per submitter's recommendation.  Mixing  only 1 cup and a half at a time in the food processor was a good idea.  Next time I'm going to try breaking down the spices further with a mortar and pestle.  It seemed like when I actually drank the chai, the spices had a chunkier consistency than the rest of the mix and float to the top.

I think the best way to serve it is with hot milk.  If I had an espresso machine to steam the milk, I would serve it that way.

Since I have all the ingredients, I've been meaning to try making this again.  Still not as good as the chai mix my local coffee shop uses, but it beats Starbuck's excuse for a chai latte anyday!

Fabulous recipe!  I've doubled the recipe and quadrupled it again for gift giving.
I added the nutmeg, allspice and white pepper suggested as an option by the author. Perfect.
Couldn't find French vanilla flavoured non-dairy creamer so I increased amount of regular creamer and included some vanilla sugar in other sugar.
Can't find instant tea here in our part of Canada - so we use the brewed tea option or just put a bag in the cup - either way it's great. Even non-tea drinkers like this drink 1/2/2004.
Update Dec 2018 - I've been using this recipe for a long while now and I'm wondering if there could be an error in the "white sugar" component - because if you use 2 1/2 c. powdered sugar instead it's not only easier to mix in but isn't as sweet as the same amount of granulated sugar.

This was great as a gift... except I could not find unsweeted instant tea mix (I read a similar reviewer state the same, I'm also in Canada so could be same explaination).  Simply instructed to add the mix to brewed tea.  I was thinking about ommitting the sugar next time and instead adding sweetened tea mix such as "Good Host- Instant Iced Tea Mix" and seeing how that turns out.

I tweaked this recipe a bit and it turned out wonderfully! I followed the advice of other reviewers and cut the sugar in half. I also skipped cardamom and ginger powder because I couldn't find any. I just doubled the amount of All Spice to replace those items. It still turned out great!

Thank you, thank you, thank you, Jo, for this recipe. I recently became a fan of Chai Latte -- where have you been all of my life -- and found a delicious brand that I've really enjoyed, but it has regular sugar in it.  I prefer to use organic sugar and set out to find a brand that tasted the same with organic sugar -- nothing came close.  I purchased the ingredients for this Chai yesterday and have enjoyed 4 cups already - so delicious, even better than the brand I had purchased!  I did cut back the sugar a little to less than 2 cups and I agree that slightly less cardamom would make for a better brew.  I will cut it back in future batches for there WILL be many!!

I rarely leave reviews for recipes I try, but this one is worth a review. This tastes great and is really easy to prepare. I used the recipe as is, including the nutmeg, allspice and white pepper. The only difference was, I used a spice grinder instead of a food processor. Thanks Jo for a great recipe. I'm enjoying a cup as I write this review. Yum!

I forgot powdered milk at the store, so I doubled the plain creamer.  I also omitted the cardimom since it was $11 for a small jar.  I added 1tsp. allspice and 1tsp. nutmeg.  I just made a cup with 3tbsp and hot water and it's delicious!!!!

I made several batches of this recipe to enjoy over the holidays and to give as gifts. I've made it before and thought it turned out well, but I made 2 changes this year that were more in keeping with the recipe and were well worth the time and effort. As several readers suggested, I included cardamom. Previously I didn't add it because 1) I wasn't familiar with it, 2) couldn't find it in the supermarket and 3)when I did find it the price was $51/pound. I only needed 1 teaspoon per "batch", so I went to our local Earth Fare and was able to purchase it in as small a quantity as I needed because they have bulk spices in jars and small plastic bags to self-serve fill as needed. I paid $1.07 for a couple of teaspoons. Quite a great deal! The second thing I did was to use my food processor to make a smoother mix which prevents the spices from gathering at the bottom of the mug in crunchy pieces. Makes for a much smoother drink.

OMGoodness...tastes delicious!  Though some of the ingredients were difficult to find, the reward is tasting the finished product...just as good as purchasing a steaming cup from any coffee shop, if not better!  Will make great gift items to any and all!

This recipe rocked! I just finished making a double batch that I've put into 8oz mason jars and I am placing them in my Christmas gift baskets (along with cookies) to my friends this year. One batch makes will fill (7) 8oz jars. In the meantime I enjoyed a cup (or two). It was absolutely delicious!! I made a 3rd batch to keep on hand this winter. I made the recipe as is-no changes-and it was perfect!! Thank you so much for posting this!!

I made this and the flavor was incredible!!!  But when I got to the bottom of the mug, there was a lot of sediment that was pretty unpleasant. I want to love it because the first 2/3 of the mug were awesome, but can't get over the slime at the bottom. I was going to make some to give as gifts, glad I tried it first.  I was able to avoid the residue by placing the mix inside my tea ball infuser....Again I will say the flavor of this mix is fantastic!!!  So glad I found a way to enjoy it!

Pretty yummy. On its own, it is not as milky as I would like. I also wanted more tea in it. I have been preparing it with an extra small spoon of instant tea & some heated milk & that made it as delicious as a Starbucks chai.

I love this recipe. I like my chai really strong though, so I doubled the spices. And I used instant coffee instead of tea so it's more like a latte.

I try to avoid dairy, so I left out the milk powder and creamers and just blended the spices, tea, and sugar, and added it to a steamed cup of soy milk. It turned out really well! I'm not the biggest fan of ginger, so next time I'm going to use a little less ginger and a little more cardamom to add some spice. Thanks for the recipe! :)

My 4 kids loved this recipe!  I substituted sugar in the raw for regular white sugar and added only half of the cardamon.  Makes it and watch it disappear!  Makes an awesome gift.

Next time I make this I won't use the French vanilla creamer and I'll cut the sugar way back.  Too sweet for me but the spices were great. I hate instant tea, but you can't taste the "instant" in this at all. I added the nutmeg and allspice.

I love chai tea and this recipe didn't disappoint. It has wonderful creamy milk and vanilla flavor added to the spices which makes this tea very soothing.  When purchasing the powdered nondairy creamer I noticed that the label said it was sweetened already. This means the recipe didn't require as much sugar. When making a second batch I didn't even bother with the sugar and it still turned out great. Next time I will leave out the dry milk and try almond milk for my guests who are dairy allergic.

Oh my, this is REALLY WONDERFUL!!!  I made this recipe as written and took the authors suggestion on spicing it up and it is beyond WONDERFUL! I love Chia tea and you can't find it everywhere especially at work.  It is such a nice change from the normal coffee, tea or hot chocolate.  Made a double batch that I will give to co-workers for a little Christmas treat.  Thanks so much for the recipe, you can bet this is going in my fav recipe box to be used often. Thanks

I just before I made this recipe I went to the local health food store for my spices. It is cheaper,fresher and you can buy it in small quantities (1 scoop) or more. I usually either bring my empty container to refill or they have bags. Next time I make it, I will cut down on the sugar and add some white pepper. I did add some allspice.

Beyond good.  I added vanilla extract instead of the vanilla powder by putting the end of a clean pump bottle into my vanilla and spraying a fine mist over the ingredients.  I then massaged it in and let dry: So delicious.  This makes a great gift!

We made this recipe and had to add more of the spices and tea to get it right to our liking. I am still not satisfied with what we did. 
We did a unsweetened tea in a jar. Also we had some while we were making it and I thought it was better the next day. We did not use a food processer on it either and I may just do that before I have my next cup of what we made.  
We did not use sugar but added a diet sweetener and they may have been the problem, I am not sure. 
I got hooked on this kind of tea we bought at a craft show and I just could not get over how good it is. I have never had this before.  I only have a little left in that bag and can not find where to buy more of the already premix. 
I am going to try other mixes, like Tazo Chai tea, because I am really hooked.

I really like this mix and it was easy to put together.  I reduced the sugar to 2c and it is still a little sweet for my taste, but probably the perfect amount for giving as a gift since many people seem to like sweet tea. I ran out of ground cloves and didn't have ground cardamon, so I used my coffee grinder to grind whole cloves and cardamon seeds instead.  It made the mix smell fantastic, but did leave a little more sediment in the cup than pre-ground spices would.  I am going to try spicing it up even further with allspice and white pepper (maybe nutmeg... not a traditional chai spice, but then again neither is allspice).

This is really good. I found that if I give the serving I'm going to use a whirl in my coffee grinder right before I use it, I don't get the grittiness some people have stated. Also, for an added kick I do add this to my coffee. Delicious! Thank you for the recipe!!

This is the best recipe I have found on AllRecipes.com by far!  I was buying a lot of Chai Tea mix from my Tastefully Simple friend but it was getting expensive.  Now I can make my own a little more affordable.  The spices might be expensive to purchase at the beginning, but you only use a little each time.

This is was not flavorful enough for me.  I would def suggest a coffee grinder for the spices.  I did not use one.  The blender used did not grind up find enough and that possibly led to  lack of flavor.  When mixed with water, all of the spices came to the top.  I will not be making this again.

I love this recipes! I did cut the sugar as well and i did not use instant tea and instead i put a tea bag of black tea (orange pekoe) in the cup - since chai tea does have black tea in it - and pour that tea into a cup over the chai mix - I LOVE IT and the pekoe is very inexpensive as well - great great GREAT

I have made this several times and given plenty of it away as holiday gifts. Nothing like it on a cold winters night. Suggest grinding 1/2c at a time in coffee grinder; faster than the food processor.  Other reviews suggest too sweet, I cut the sugar by 1/2 cup.  I also add 1t nutmeg, 1t allspice and 1/4t white pepper.

I use Splenda white and some Splenda brown sugar.  Makes it wonderful.  It was already a great recipe.  I use black pepper and all the other spices listed.  Try some yourself. You won't be sorry!

I made a recipe and a half, but halved the sugar after reading some of the reviews that it was too sweet with full sugar.  I think this mix tastes just like Trader Joe's.  And since there isn't a TJ's in Colorado (yet) I'll make this again!

I skipped the non-fat dry milk powder, vanilla-flavoured non-dairy creamer, the instant tea and the sugar. Instead I used two cups of Coffeemate's 'Double Double-mate' which is already sweetened and half cup of brown sugar. For the tea portion I plan on steeping a bag of chai or black tea and adding this mix to it (I don't think instant tea can be bought here in Canada as I've never seen it before). Onto the spices... Many reviews mentioned the flavour being weak so I knew I really needed to spice things up. I used three teaspoons each of ginger and cinnamon, 1 1/4 teaspoons each of cloves, cardamom, nutmeg, allspice and star anise, as well as the 1/4 teaspoon of white pepper. It smells to die for! I will update my review once I taste it. *UPDATE* Don't skip the step of running everything through a coffee grinder until it turns to a powder or you will have bits in your tea (though I still have that problem; will try sifting it). Doubling all the spices made it too spice-y, so really I think you need to go by taste for what you like your chai to taste like. I may try this again just using the spices, then making it to taste with fresh milk and sugar to taste.

Used ground spices from my spice drawer (minus the cardamom, plus allspice), and turned out great!  Fast, easy, CHEAP Christmas gift to give!  Friends loved it!

This is awesome! One of my friends accidentally used Pumpkin Spice Creamer thinking it was Vanilla. It was great that way too. I think I may try the Caramel flavor too. The best Chai mix I have had hands down, better than what you get at the store!

Very good!  I cut the sugar by 1c., also used regular vanilla with the sugar.   I found cardamom at the bulk food store.  (FYI, I get most of my spices there, they are super cheep compaired to the grocery store, just keep you old spice bottles to refill, or baby food jars to keep them fresh.)  I also did not use non-dairy creamer( not a fan of part. hydro. oils)  and just doubled the amount of milk, plus a half of cup...comes out just as creamy.  I've made this a few times and have messed with the spices found I like it best with half as much cloves, more cardamom and added small amount of allspice, and white pepper.  Supper yummy, so much better than buying the mix from Trader Joes at $4 a can!

This is good, but it tastes too much like vanilla.  Next time I'll use less of the vanilla creamer and I'll add Allspice and more cinn. because it wasn't spicey enough.

Yummy! I would HIGHLY recommend cutting the sugar in half though, it may just be my personal preference but I found it to be too sweet. It was very mild- I think next time I will add a bit more instant tea, and maybe a bit more of all the spices. Excellent served hot or cold- I am enjoying a cup right now :) I mix it in with milk because I like it rich. I did run through a coffee grinder on the "extra fine" setting, this worked GREAT. A bit messy, but I think worth it. I will definitely make this again instead of buying from the store. Thanks for sharing this great recipes!

I just made this and it is great! I did however lower the sugar to 1 1/2 cups instead of 2 1/2 as I thought it was going to be too sweet for my taste, although if you like yours on the sweeter side then it should be good without any changes to that. Also, if you don't care for instant tea then a great alternative is to makeyour own fresh hot tea and then add some of the mix. I did this also and it turned out fantastic!

Very good, although I wish I had ground the spices in the coffee grinder before mixing with the other ingredients, as there are little chunks of spice (I think it might be the allspice that needing more grinding).  I cut sugar to just under 2c and thought that was about right.  I'll definitely make this again!

Awesome recipe!  I just made it for the first time (for my chai loving boyfriend for V-day) and it tastes awesome!  I highly recommend blending it in your blender/food processor.  The blender makes it nice and fine and how it's "supposed" to look.  I just added a few teaspoons of mix to my cold milk and that tastes great too!! :)

Great recipe - I used about 1 3/4 cups sugar because we are trying to cut down on our sugar.  Spice blend is just right - it tastes just like the Oregon Chai mixes that I paid $4.97/8 envelopes.

Fantastic! Due to illness and disability, I rarely get to my favorite cafes for a good chai, something I loved. I was a little skeptical, but just made a batch. I love it, and my husband loves it. I can't wait to have friends over and offer them sometimes truly special. I followed the recipe exactly, and loved it, but I also may try some variations in the next batch. Thank you, Jo, for giving me back a lost pleasure, and to the reviewers, who made me give this a chance.

Delicious!  I love having this on hand for myself and family, and it makes a really great gift, too.  I generally don't like using my coffee grinder for anything other than grinding coffee beans, and my little food processor is just too small to do the job efficiently, but the good ol' blender works GREAT!  I put in JUST the powdered milk and spices first, and blend the "bejeepers" out of that.  The better you can pulverize the spices, the better they will later dissolve in your cup.  (One of these days, I will have to buy myself a second coffee grinder just for spices!)  THEN I add in everything else and pulse/blend/stir until it's all well mixed.  Although this is a fantastic recipe as written, I too have sometimes increased/added/substituted spices as mentioned by others (white pepper and allspice are great; and more than once I've mistakenly doubled both the cloves and cardamom -- love it all!).  Thanks Jo!

OK, you've earned the coveted 5 stars! This was great!  I did add the additional spices minus white pepper since I don't like pepper.  I did mix in half the sugar per user suggestions, but did ADD the OTHER HALF ALSO since I didn't find it sweet enough.  The taste is very much on par with Oregon Chai brand. But my usual brand (Mocafe Precious Divinity Spiced Chai) is still head and shoulders above this one.  BUT for the price, you definitly cannot go wrong. Precious Divinity goes for $9.00 for 12 oz. can of powder.  I will gladly use this mix.  Maybe add some madagascar vanilla to it as P.D. does.  As for the spices sinking, I didn't care at all.  UPDATE - I've made it several times now, and YES the Cardamaom makes a HUGE difference when it's in!!

I made this for gifts several years ago and everyone loved it!!  For myself, I'm going to put in a tad less cardamom as it really can be overpowering.  Also using a handheld frother, I add frothed milk which makes it just like Starbucks without the $3.79 price tag per cup!

Have been a chai tea mix drinker for a long time, and happy to try a home made mix that could reduce the cost.  This was very good and although different from the brand I normally drink, it's a nice change.  I will definitely make this for myself, and will probably make it for gifts next holiday season!  Thanks for the post!

It's a little sweet, but tastes just like the 'tea' that my friend from India makes for me.  Yum!  I love that you just need to add water to this - I leave some in my desk at work to have anytime!

Love this recipe.  Have looked all over ND and SD for GM International Chai tea to no availability.  Had the makings for atleast a year and finally tried it.  This is superb to any store brand.  Made with the additions of Nutmeg and allspice.  Also used food processor and then ran through coffee grinder for a finer powder.  Extra work paid off with excellent results.  Made several batches for gifts this year.  Will give out recipe within week.  Have requests to make more for friends that don't cook or "mix".

I really like this recipe, but we "older" people have more diet restrictions, so I use decaf instant tea and a sugar substitute such as Splenda.  I'm not sure how many carbs are eliminated with these changes.

This is a GREAT recipe! My husband is very picky about his Chai Tea and he absolutely loves it! I did use a coffee grinder on the "fine" setting and it worked wonderfully. I substituted the cloves and cardamom for a teaspoon each of All Spice and Nutmeg. Thanks for sharing such an awesome recipe Jo!!! :D

Just made my first batch - ohmygoodness, it's delicious! I'm a huge Chai tea fan, and this is now one of my favorites! Like some of the other reviewers, cardamom was much too expensive, so I left it out. Also omitted the French vanilla creamer and followed the footnote instead. And I took the advice of the  header and added some allspice, nutmeg, and white pepper.

Absolutely perfect.  Simple to make - the food processor ground it up fine.  It absolutely tastes just as good as the Chai Latte from Starbucks, at a fraction of the cost.  Yes, the cardamom is pricey, but it is the crucial spice to make it chai.

I love this mix! Instead of using the vanilla flavored creamer, I tried (and liked) using the vanilla extract idea. Last time, I bought vanilla powder and used 2 tsp. of that instead. It worked great. I highly recommend this recipe. I also used my coffee grinder to grind the spices before mixing in with the other ingredients. I still ran the whole thing through my blender! Dusty but awesome results!

Absolutely delicious and satisfying.  Only changes  I made was 2 c. sugar, 3 tsp. ginger and cinnamon, 1-1/2 tsp. cloves, 1 tsp. cardamom, scant tsp. allspice and nutmeg.  Used an immersion blender to mix -- worked so-so.  Ended up straining the hot tea into another cup -- fabulous!  Will follow directions and ground the spices first,  next time I make this.

There is no longer a reason to buy chai at Starbucks or the Tazo carton.  This is terrific!  I did use fat free and/or sugar free products in my batch, and replaced the sugar with 3/4 cup splenda.  Plenty sweet.  I kicked up the spiciness by using heaping spoonfuls of all the spices mentioned, with a little extra white pepper thrown in for good measure.  Perfect!

It is amazing.  Girls at work are addicted.  We pitch in our money and I make a batch.  When it runs out, I do it again.  I have not tasted any that is better than this.  My sister uses it in her coffee.  It is pretty good that way too.

I must admit, I was a little skeptical that it would as good as the Chai I get in the coffee shops .... it is AMAZING!! I found the cardamom at a small farm market for an AMAZING price and the rest of the ingredients aren't that expensive considering how much you get! I made a half of a batch and it just about filled a large canning jar. I will definitely share this with family and friends for Christmas. TRY IT!

Tastes just like $3.00 chai tea lattes from chains.  I did not add the plain creamer because I did not have it, but it's still delicious.

I love this recipe.  I took into consideration some of the changes suggested and used 2 cups of Splenda and add the white pepper.  Awesome!  Now I don't have to buy it any more.  I just make my own.  Thank you All Recipes.  Socrmom15

turned out great and did mostly the same, until the spices: 1 cup milk, 1 cup creamer, 2 cups vanilla creamer, 2 cups sugar, 1 1/2 cups instant tea  ******spices******** 2 tea Ginger, 2 tea Cinnamon, 1 tea Cloves, 1 tea Cardamom, 1 tea Coriander, 1 tea Allspice, 1 tea Nutmeg.... Made about a double batch.  You do not need to grind everything. Just the spices, as finely as possible. Everything else is designed to dissolve in water. F-ing addictive. Only problem is the spices that settle on the bottom. Anyone know how to make tea bags?

Yum!!  I've tried quite a few home made drink mixes, and this one is by far the best!  Like other reviewers, I only used 1 1/2 cups sugar and I reduced the cardamom to 3/4 tsp.  I think it is perfect!

Spectacular!  Hubby and I have really missed the delicious chai at our favorite Indian restaurant since we moved out of state.  While this chai isn't perfect, it's pretty darn close.  I love the smell/taste of the cardamom and feel it is an essential ingredient.   I priced out this recipe very explicitly using my kitchen scale and exact cost of ingredients. The ingredients minus spices were $3.96.  Allowing $1-2 for the spices, the maximum price of this recipe was $6 (a previous review stating $17 was either highly exaggerated, or the reviewer was paying a whole lot for ingredients).

I love chai tea it's my fave and I was excited to find a chai tea mix. I made it today and tried it. It was good but I think it had to much cream when I make it again I will cut down on some of creamers. I haven't tried it with milk perhaps that might make it taste better. All in all still a keeper :)

I found cardamom in the bulk spice section for a lot less $ .50 for 5 Tbls. This recipe is delicious. I made it with vanilla extract and omitted the instant tea and mix it with black tea or green tea.

I have made this tea mix every winter for several years. I make a huge batch and give it away as gifts at Christmas time. If you want to make a low fat sugar free version using Splenda and lo fat or sugar free versions of the creamers it still turns out fantastic!

Excellent.  I am enjoying some right now.  I didn't have 2 tsp ginger, so used only one.  I did add the cardamom, nutmeg and white pepper as suggested, and also used 1 1/2 cups splenda instead of sugar.  It is tasty!  Not quite as creamy as some, but I'm guessing if I made it with milk, it would be more so...however more caloric as well.  Great recipe!

My pregnancy craving the past few weeks has been chai tea, but it was getting really expensive to keep buying it at the coffee shop. I decided to try this mix and it's WONDERFUL! The only thing I omitted was the cardamon and I didn't notice a difference. I'm so excited to have found this recipe! I will be enjoying chai tea a lot more often now, and can't wait to serve it to my friends!

I LOVED this recipe. I added the vanilla to the sugar, but i still used the 2 cups total of non dairy creamer. I also added fresh grated nutmeg, and skipped the cardamom since i wasn't going to pay $15 for the small bottle, so i just doubled the ginger. Still turned out amazing. I am making another double batch right now.

This recipe looked really good and is well rated, so I took a risk and made it for my friend's birthday. I made up the mix and put it in a pretty jar with a homemade label on the side. Great gift idea! We tried some together and were very impressed, but felt that it needed waaaay more spices! I will be making this again (and she will too!), but we'll be tweaking the spice levels. I'm a Canadian user, so I took a fellow commentor's advice and just mixed the tea into a cup of Orange Pekoe black tea. Worked great!

Ran across this recipe before Christmas and decided to try it. Wow, no more Starbucks for me. This chai is great. The only problem I had is getting everything to dissolve and stay mixed. I have a vita mix blender and ran everything thru twice, still by the time you finish a cup you get grains of tea or spices floating in your mug. Maybe a food processor would do better. It is a bit pricey to make. The cardamom is $10 bucks alone! I bought all the ingredients and it made about 2 1/2 batches.  I ended up making about 6 batches due to the request from everyone who tried it.  I have my own stash tucked away for the rest of the winter.  I will definatley be making, and giving this again next year.  I gave a tin of chai and some Grandma Johnson's Scones as gifts to co workers and neighbors. Perfect!

This recipe is delicious. My only changes were along the same lines as other reviewers - I used half as much sugar and 1.5 times as much of each of the spices, and did not include the tea - I just add the mix to a freshly brewed cup of tea. I've been drinking this non-stop since making the mix! Thanks!

Wonderful! I don't like having the spices floating in the top of my mug so I put the mix inside a coffee filter, tie it closed with a rubber band, and then steep it in hot water like a tea bag. Tastes delicious!

I think this tea is good, but I didn't think it had enough flavor.  Apparently, I missed the extra spices in the header....I bet those would make a difference.  I will try those next time.  I would highly recommend using a magic bullet to grind it up; it worked awesome for this!

just wonderful! though the cardamom and cloves are exceedingly expensive, these spices are absolutely crucial for the full experience of a great cup of chai. i did modify slightly. i couldnt find the instant tea, so i used allison's suggestion below and used a tea bag instead. and i left out the dry milk too. i dont like my chai too creamy, so the non-dairy creamer was the perfect touch. ;-)

I made this with the additional spices(nutmeg, allspice and pepper)recommended and I also followed the advice of others by reducing the cloves by half and the sugar to only 2 cups. I was worried about the taste of instant tea so I did not use the instant tea. Instead, when I gave these as gifts, I gave a box of black tea with it. Then on the tag I just wrote to stir the Chai mix into the brewed black tea. I am personally not a huge fan of Chai but I had my kids do a blind taste test between the mix and the Trader Joe's mix and they actually like this mix better.  Next time I give these as gifts, I am going to do it without the sugar. That way people can use splenda or sugar and sweeten it as much as they want.

The yummiest.  Just like from a coffee stand. I've gotten all my friends hooked on it--some who have never even drank chai tea before.  I used Splenda in place of sugar and was still perfect.

I made this with my sister to give as Christmas gifts. We tweaked it a little to make it to our tastes, but it turned out amazing. We made it in the food processor as others suggested to cut down on the grit and are glad we did. Right from the start we left out the ginger (allergies) and cut the sugar in half. Even for those who like sweet drinks, I would recommend starting with half the sugar. You can always add more in if you want it sweeter. We both like our teas and coffees really sweet, but we agreed that half the sugar tasted just right. We made a cup with water and decided it wasn't quite perfect. We added another 1/2 cup of the vanilla creamer and another 1/2 cup of tea to the mix. The second time around we also prepared it using half milk and half water with the new mix and decided it made it perfect. Our only experience with Chai prior to this was Starbucks, so we had some big shoes to fill, but I think we succeeded. So long $4 lattes!

A AROMATIC PLEASURE. 
This is a amazing tea. The blend of spices gives it a wonderful scent and taste. I did however use only  1.5 cup of sugar and found the sweetness just right. I did not use the instant tea,
just brewed  black tea and added
2 teaspoons of the mix to the cup(it just seem more authentic) . W

LOVE IT! I will definitely make more of this. The only ingredient I left out was the cardamom because I couldn't find it in the store, it's still wonderful without it. 
Great recipe!

I got a bag of this mix from a friend for Christmas and loved it so I had to have the recipe. We of course are Starbucks loving folks, but this is just about as good. I used my coffee grinder (grinding a cup of white rice before and after to clean the grinder!!)  to try to grind the spices finer to avoid the "sediment" at the bottom of the cup, but it didn't make much of a diff. Only used 1 C. sugar and it is still sweet enough. Made with hot water and added a splash of F-F Half &Half and it's awesome! We love it and share with everyone!!! Thanks for a fantastic recipe.

Very good.  I live in a country without instant tea, so i just add regular tea leaves after I blend the other ingredients.  When I make it, I just strain the leaves out with a tea strainer.  It's a little more trouble, but well worth it.  The upside is that cardamom is much cheaper and easier to come by here.  Very delicious!

I substitute powdered soy milk and Splenda and the tea tastes just as good as the original recipe with more protein and fewer calories.  This is a wonderful recipe!

fantastic recipe!  i personally think the cardamom makes the chai tea.  love the smell of it.  i used lite coffee creamer and sugar free french vanilla coffee creamer then used all the sugar the recipe asked for.  still very good!  next time i will try decreasing the sugar by 1/2 cup.  great idea to grind it in a coffee bean grinder.  i will be giving this for gifts this fall along with the iced pumpkin cookies from this website!! YUM YUM YUM. 
thank you!

Sooo very good on a cold day..
I used 2 cups powdered sugar.. left out the powdered milk. Sifted all the ings. I did not use the instant tea. Just added the 2 heaping tbs to my favorite hot tea. I used the powered sugar becaues I was on the hunt for the archer farms chai tea cookies, I think just out of the oven tea cookies rolled in this mixture would be Great !! I will let you know...

There is only one thing to say about this recipe -- IT ROCKS!  I agree with some of the other postings; if you want a richer flavor, it takes at least 3 tablespoons for a large mug.  I am getting ready to make a second batch and I will be cutting the sugar back to 1.5 cups.

I would give this 10 stars if I could.  I am  now starting my second batch of this because I went through it so quickly.  This is better than Starbucks for sure.  Be sure to play with the quantity for your drink...my cups are large and took 4 heaping spoons full.

Very yummy!  I cut back on the sugar because I could only find sweetened tea with lemon in Maine in February - and the lemon adds a nice zip!  Who needs Panera when you have this mix in the pantry?? Thanks for sharing!

YUM!  This mix is sooo easy to make.  I used all of the spices plus 1/2 t. allspice and 1/2 t. nutmeg.  I also purchased whole cardamom pods from World Market and ground them, which was much cheaper than buying it already ground, and I cut the sugar back to about 2 cups.  With hot water this drink is good, but add a little milk and it is absolutely divine!  No more need for the coffee shop!

As good, if not better, than the stuff you pay $5 a cup for at the coffee house! Followed others suggestions & only used 1.5 cups sugar, and was perfect. Gave this out for Christmas to several friends & now I'm getting calls because they're almost out! Love this chai & will keep this recipe.

As written, it's slightly too sweet for my taste. I cut back to 2 cups sugar for 36 servings.  I also substitute Splenda for some of the sugar (or use Splenda sugar blend). Other than that, this is wonderful! Thanks for submitting it!

I made this for xmas & put in the little xmas treat bags with the twisty ties. (each bag 3-4 servings) I also in a seperate bag put 4 homemade choc chip cookies & tied together for teacher gifts. used ground spices from Penzey Spices (so much better than you can get at grocery store & cheaper) I mixed in large bowl & then put in blender to grind.  It is a sweet tea but smells so good with the spices. everyone liked it & asked for recipe.

I loved this recipe!  It tasted wonderful but I did add a little bit of coriander and some nutmeg instead of cloves.  They smell awful.  
There have been a lot of reviewers saying that cardamom is too expensive, but if you're able to find a bulk food store like the BulkBarn chain it shouldn't be a problem.  You can buy spices looses in whatever amount you need.  I got the cardamom for less than a dollar. (Whole, so I had to grind it in a coffee grinder.)
This works great for a lot of spices.

love this recipe I used one cup of splenda and added cloves, left out the caramon. The only thing that I see is that there are quite a bit of settlings at the bottom of the cup. What could my problem be and suggestions would be appreciated.

This is a very sweet and spicey tea. I made it up for Christmas presents and sampled a cup.  I am going to try the suggestions and use less sugar with the back I am making to keep and see how I like it.  I did add the extra spices this time and will with the next batch.

This mix is awesome!  Much better than any store bought mix - or coffee house!  I like it with half milk/half water.  I mix it in my cocoa-latte mixer/dispenser.  It mixes and heats it in a couple minutes and makes a nice foamy top.  You can buy them for $20 - $30 and are very fun.  Great for cocoa too.  I also bought an $8 coffee grinder just for spices.  Grind the spices first - then combine all in a blender a cup or two at a time.  Almost no residue!

OOO!!! This is so yummy! IMO you really need to include the cardamom...it's expensive, but so worth it! I took other reviewers' advice and only used 1 1/2 cups of sugar, which is plenty; and I added the white pepper and allspice which really kicks it up a notch! :P I'm going to give some of it as gifts this year!

I made this tonight to put into jars for Christmas gifts.  I made it exactly as directed and it is wonderful!  I hated to pay $10 for a jar of cardamom, but I'm glad I did.  The aroma is very exotic and relaxing.  I quadrupled the recipe and used my coffee grinder.  The poor little thing worked so hard it started smoking, but it's ok.  Just wanted to warn you to let it cool off if it gets hot.

I just put this in tins for the holidays.  It is addicting and so perfectly yummy.  DO NOT leave out the cardomom!!  It makes the whole recipe!! Also, you don't use that much of it, so you will always have it on hand for the next time you make it!

This is a pretty good recipe; my only suggestion would be to possibly decrease the amount of sugar.  Update: This is probably a traditional chai tea recipe.  I think I prefer the stuff from the retail chains.

This was good, if a little messier to make than I expected.  Several people asked where I bought it so they could get some too.  :)

Followed the suggestion about adding the nutmeg, allspice, and white pepper for a spicier mix...very tasty!  Next time I'll make it without the extra spices to see how it compares.

I had to make without the last ingredient.  Couldn't find in two different grocery stores.  Yet even without it was great drinking.

Love this recipe! Easy to make and produces a lg. quantity for your effort.I did use the coffee grinder as suggested and found it worked great albeit time consuming. I also added a pinch of white pepper to give it just alittle "kick." I enjoy this at home, work and even take it camping in the fall.I also offer it as a nice alternative to tea or coffee when friends and family stop by. It never fails to bring a "yummmm" to the lips of those that enjoy it.I've been asked for the recipe on more than one ocassion.Thanks again.

I drink this all the time.  Alot cheaper that Starbucks.  I will give this away for Christmas gifts. Everyone that tries it just loves it. The only change I made was I left out the cloves.  I don't like the taste of them.  And it still tasted great.

I can't keep the stuff around.I made 2 batches in 10 days. So far I prepared it as a smoothie, and as a hot tea as is. And with a splash of Captain Morgan. Good Stuff!!!

This is absolutely awesome!!  I am on a frozen Chai kick and this much cheaper!  I used Splenda for the sugar, sugar free french vanilla creamer for the creamer (2 cups total). ALL of the spices!!  Ran through the blender.    Wonderful flavor!!  Must try!!

Awesome!  Here in Vermont, I have a hard time finding my Chai Lattes and no luck finding a sugar free mix!  I made this with sugar free creamers and Splenda.  Perfect!  I substituted Pumpkin Pie Spice for the ginger and cinnamon.  Otherwise, followed recipe to a T.  Great made with water.  Next time, I think I will try using a different flavored creamer--maybe hazelnut!  I think I will experiment with adding in a little cocoa too!

This mix is absolutely outstanding when made with 2% or even whole milk!! I made it with 2c sugar rather than 2.5c for the 36serv recipe. Sorry baristas, but my $4.00 are staying at home for the rest of the winter!!

I have never had Chai Tea before so I have nothing to compare this to.  I think it was very good.  I made a large batch of thex mix it and sent to work with my husband.  Several nurses at the hospital have asked for the recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

This is delicious and my family, neighbors & co-workers love it.  Even better is to make a frozen chai tea:   4 ozs of milk, 2-3 heaping T. chai mix, 1/2 C vanilla yogurt & 1 Cup ice in a blender.  Mix until smooth.  Yum!!

I enjoyed making this mix as it's much cheaper to make it myself than buying the mix at the store. I would recommend reducing the amount of sugar.  Perhaps use half the amount suggested?  Otherwise, it's a great drink and it's so easy to make!

i love this mix. i have to admit i was bit of a snob when i first saw this recipe, but out of desperatation i think i found something great! let me tell you...this mix is better than anything you can buy in a store. since i like a little bit of heat in my chai, i've been playing around with different peppers. i also cut back on the sugar, i only used two cups.

I don't drink chai, but I made it for my husband. He says it tastes just like the storebought that he likes. I added the extra spices and ground it in my coffee grinder. I omitted the cardamom. Thanks for the recipe.

So fantastic!  I can't believe how good this is!  It makes tons, so I was able to give a few pint jars as gifts and still have some to keep for me.  I did not have cardamom and wasn't willing to pay $9 for it, so we skipped it.  I'll watch for it to go on sale and try to add it next time I make this!

Wonderful!  I love things sweet, but since reading other reviews I was careful with the suger.  I used 2 Cups and that was plenty.  I followed directions exactly other than that, used my coffee grinder and it is delicious!  I can't wait to share with my best friend who loves chai tea.

Another 5* rating for this one! I had to try it myself before I delivered as gifts to teachers, coworkers, and family. It is delicious. Next time I'll probably decrease the sugar even more - 1.5 c instead of the 2 c I used. In addition, when I affix my labels to the gift jars, I'll suggest water OR milk. It'd probably be even better if dissolved in warm milk (or heated w/ a steaming wand for a delicious latte). Thank you so much! This was exactly what I was looking for: something delicious I could put in a jar  as a gift that would be easy for me to prepare and easier for the recipient to make. This recipe delivered! THANKS!

P.S. As if the recipe itself wasn't good enough, I can't wait to try some of the reviewers' suggestions, particularly using this mix to make ice cream. Gotta LOVE this site!

I am not a chai lover but this is very good and compforting.  I am making it for teacher gifts.  I mix it with milk instead of water for a richer taste.  I put all the ingredients in a large mixing bowl and used a hand held blender to grind the mix. It came out very smooth.

Very Good.  There is residue at the bottom but I even had some from the store bought ones so I don't mind it so much.  this makes alot and i am glad since the cardamom and vanilla creamer are pricey.  I plan on making some as gifts for friends.  thanks for the recipe :D

I was suprised that this made very good chai.  I didn't have any cardamom, so I left it out.  Still, it was quite delicious, but I think next time I'll have to be sure I have all the spices.

So good! I added the pepper, allspice, and nutmeg and a little extra vanilla creamer and powdered milk. I made a batch using Splenda and it was terrific. It's so delicious and much more economical.

Excellent! I love chai, and this is very good. I did add additional cream as I like it creamy. I substituted 1 cup B. sugar and 1 cup slenda and blenda well. Turned out so well, my husband made a cup. He usually doesn't like creamy drinks.  Will be keeping this around!!!!

This is the BEST chai tea.  I make it all the time for my husband.  Made a few slight alterations: I use all non-fat dairy creamer and I mix 2t of vanilla into the sugar instead of using the vanilla flavored creamer.  Also, we mix it up in hot milk versus water....yummmmm....!!!!  The family considers it better than the chai tea you can buy at coffee houses.

It doesn't taste like the Chai tea I buy, but it's a nice replacement when you consider how much it cost to make you're own compared to the store bought kind.
I made a few changes as suggested from other reviewers and it came out wonderfully. I don't like the fact that there's a gritty residue left behind from the spices. Next time I'll process the tea with the spices to see if I can get them a little finer before processing the entire mixture.
This is my favorite recipe. I tried the other Chai Tea recipe listed on this site and it left a lot to be desired and required too much tweeking to get it even close to the taste of this one.
Thank you so much for posting this recipe.

I was originally looking for a substitution for Oh My Chai by Tastefully Simple.  While this Chai is VERY good, it is not the same.  It is not as creamy as TS's but is still I will definately make it again.  I did a few changes per a reviewers suggestions.  I doubled the non fat dry milk powder and substituted 1 cup white + 1 cup brown sugar.  I think I will add the additional 1/2 cup sugar next time as I like the sweetness of TS's Chai.  One nice thing...there is no cup "residue".  Bottom line, if you're wanting an exact match to Tastefully Simple's Chai, you won't find it, but it still SO good...once my TS stash runs out...this will be my standard.

Maybe I lucked out, but I found ground cardamom at a nearby spice store for $1.60 an ounce, so this mix was very affordable to make.  I added the nutmeg and pepper (I actually used black instead of white, since the only difference is the color), but not the allspice.  The flavor is great but the smell is the best part!

This tastes just like the vanilla chai at Dunkin Donuts.  My own changes are to double the spices, and only put 1 cup of sugar in the recipe.  It's still plenty sweet at that level.

I've loved Oregon Chai for years but I don't buy it very often since it's become so expensive.  After reading all the reviews I cut the sugar back to 1-1/2 cups (I've never liked it very sweet) and added the vanilla extract to the sugar.  I just finished my first cup and I think it's great.  I will probably cut back the ginger to 1 tsp on my next batch as I found it a little strong.  I had already planned on giving this as a Christmas gift to several family members.  Now I need to go to the store and stock up while they still have the spices on sale!  Thanks so much, Jo!

I have made this several times.  The first two times, I drank all of it.  However, my husband discovered it the third and I have hardly gotten any of it!  Oh well, I guess I couldn't keep it a secret for too long. :) I don't add the nutmeg, allspice or pepper.  I also substitute fat-free creamers and sugar free creamers for their heavier conterparts.  I plan of using splenda next time.

This is really good.  I was somewhat skeptical that it could be as good as the store-bought instant chai mix, but it is.  I like to add a little milk in the water to make it creamier.  I'm not a huge fan of cloves, so next time I will use less.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Thank you so much for sharing this terrific recipe, Jo!  To cut down on the fat and calories, I used fat free creamers and splenda in place of the sugar.  Because I like to brew my own tea (in my coffee maker) every morning, I also omitted the instant tea.  I just put two heaping TBS of this Chai powder in my cup of tea each morning.  I think your recipe is even better than Starbucks!  Thanks!

This is soooooooo good! I've been making this for a few months now and thoroughly enjoy it.  The last few sips are a little grainy but now I'm used to it and don't mind it. I used to like Borders chai and was looking for something similar I could make at home that would cost a lot less.  This is it! The only difference is that this is better! Thanks, Jo!

I didn't have access to Cardemom but this still turned out fantastic!  I made it as gifts and everyone loved it.  Will definately make again.

I can't give this recipe any stars because I didn't actually try the recipe.  I bought all the ingredients and then I came across the suggestion another reviewer made about buying Chai tea bags to make it simpler.  This allowed me to use Sweet N' Low and the french vanilla creamer to keep the calories down a bit.  Plus, I can make it a cup at a time.

This is great and so convenient. I can have chai anywhere I have access to hot water. I am a chai addict and this definately helps me get my fix. It isn't as good as the liquid mixes you can add milk to (my favorite is oragon original) but I can use splenda and make it sugar free. Definately use ALL of the spices to achieve an authentic flavor.

This is an excellent Chai recipe.  I did use the extra spices.  Even a little extra white pepper.  I use Splenda and just make it with hot water.  Way better than most off the shelf mixes.  Kind of spendy though.

I forgot to add the white pepper and nutmeg, but it was excellent without it.  Otherwise, I followed the instructions exactly, blended using a food processor.  So easy and so fast!  A definite winner.

I've never had chai tea before, but my brother-in-law loves it and it's hard to find where we are. So I mixed it up and was pleasantly suprised! It is sure to be a hit with anyone who enjoys this unique flavored tea. He'll a jar in his stocking for Christmas.

I am absolutely amazed at how good this is!  I LOVE Chai and wasn't sure how good this would be.  I made it with hot water, but will try with hot milk next time.  I added some white pepper as suggested and used decaf instant tea -- it was great!!  I can't wait to give this as gifts. A+++

I was skeptical about this recipe, because I haven't found a good store-bought chai mix that compares well to actual Indian chai, but this recipe was surprisingly good.  I think it might be even better mixed with hot milk to get it really creamy.  I doubled the cardamom since that's the important ingredient, and added nutmeg and allspice, and only used 2 cups of sugar.

Wow...this is an awesome chai tea mix! It was so good that my SO and I had two mugs each and then we were both up until 2am. So, I really wouldn't change a thing, but I'm definitely using decaf instant tea for my personal stash!! Enjoy!

Wonderful recipe!  Great full flavor, just like you would buy at the espresso stand, but a lot cheaper if you make a large quantity and make your own at home!

Very, very good.  I have been buying a cup of my local coffee bar's spiced chai daily along with enough individual packets for my nightly cup of tea while I read and it got expensive. THANK YOU so much for this wonderful recipe. It is identical to the coffee bar chai I get and for only pennies a cup rather then several dollars.

Excellent Chai Tea Mix!!  I docked a star though, because it gets a little gritty in the last 3-4 sips.  I used a coffee grinder to process this and that worked very well!  Very messy to make, but well worth the effort!

Thank you Jo for saving me money, this recipe makes a lot of mix, a little sweet next time I will try with 1/2 cup sugar less, but by far the best Chai tea mix we have tried. I did find cardamom to be pricey but the bottle will make many batches of tea and it is an essential ingredient. If you have high school/college age guests they will be so impressed with your "as close as it gets" to coffee house chai tea.

I made a few batches of this recipe and gave them away as Christmas presents. Everyone gave it rave reviews. It tastes exactly like the chai tea they serve at Hudsons (an Australian coffee shop chain). I couldn't find creamer anywhere but there is a product made by Nestle called Coffee Whitener which seems to be the same thing (it also comes in a French Vanilla flavour). Bushells seems to be the only company making instant tea in Australia. All these products are located on the highest shelf at the supermarket I go to. Cardamom isn't that expensive here and is available in many places- don't leave it out, it's essential to the recipe.

Fabulous! I recommend you go for the cardamom, it may seem pricey, but you can use it in other things, and it really makes the chai taste. I used a coffee grinder and got great results, thanks for that suggestion!
I can't wait to share this with my sister!

I tried this Chai Tea recipe and loved it.  It was very simple and I used a coffee grinder which worked wonderfully.  I used all the spices including the allspice, nutmeg and white pepper.  I wouldn't change anything  My daughter is a pharmacist and she use to make her own chai, hand grinding the spices herself.  This is so much better and easier. I'm giving it as christmas gifts this year!  Thanks so much !

We are addicts, really, now.  This takes me back to my college days and Mr. Toots in Capitola, CA where I first had chai.  My eight year old mixes it up for me when the weather is cold.  Even my toddler likes to drink this stuff from a bottle (when I let her!)  I love this recipe!  I do use two tablespoons per mug, but the amount would really depend on the mug size, wouldn't it?  Experiment to see what works for you.

My only complaint with this mix is that it's darn near impossible to find instant unsweetened tea in Canada. I made this with some that my mom had from a few years ago, but, wanting to make it again, I've been hunting and hunting to find instant tea and can't find any ANYWHERE!! I guess it's more available in the States, but if I could find more, I'd make a whole bunch of it, since it was SO YUMMY...I added it to hot water, but also to hot milk...either way it's great - nice and spicy and comforting on a cold night.

AWESOME. I added the extra spices, but went without the white pepper on the second batch - it leaves a bitter aftertaste. But it's a great recipe - wonderful for gifts!

I've made this several times to rave reviews.  Even did a "blind taste test" to compare to Oregon Chai's instant mix.  This came out better.  One suggestion: mix in a blender at 1 1/2 cup at a time.  For whatever reason it does not get as messy as just 1 cup.

Made a few changes. Didn’t use the non fat creamer. Used French Vanilla and Coffee mate cream dry. I’m not a fan of instant tea but followed the rest of the recipe. When I make my hot tea using a tea bag, I add this mix along with liquid creamer by Carnation. I love this but my hubby was not a fan. To blend the spices, just used a mini food processor.

I'm lactose intolerant, so I subbed powdered coconut milk for the nonfat milk. I also doubled the spice amounts because the more the better as far as I'm concerned. 

I love this recipe with these adjustments!

I love this mix. Used to give it as gifts at Christmas. Everyone seems to love it. I think this is better than Starbucks and so easy to keep. It isn't all that great after two years, but it does keep for a long long time in an air tight container. This year I made some to send to Mexico with my nieces for another niece who couldn't come for Christmas. She loves it and I always try to make sure she has some.

I substituted Stevia for the sugar for a sugar-free version. I don't think it needs as much sugar or sweetener as the recipe suggests or the spice flavors are drowned out by the sweetness. I used only half the amount and it was plenty sweet.

PERFECT! Since my daughter is lactose intolerant, I doubled the non-dairy creamer and omitted the powdered milk!  Sheer heaven when blended with almond milk and ice for an iced latte. Can’t wait to try it hot.

I wanted a chai iced tea. This was great. Since I didn't have powdered milk or creamer and didn't want it, I left those out. I used stevia instead of sugar. When I made my iced tea, I added vanilla almond creamer. Too delicious!

Used sugar free vanilla non dairy creamer for the regular vanilla creamer, and 1.5C of Pyure stevia blend for the sugar.  Turned out delicious!  Definitely a keeper in our house.

I think this mix is really really good. I did follow other users suggestions but cutting down the sugar- I only did 1 1/4 c. And I think that’s perfect. I also cut the cardamom in half and for the other1/2 t. I did pumpkin pie spice. My only issue is all I can taste is the ginger. Next time I plan to cut that in half and I think it’ll be absolutely perfect. Thanks for a great recipe!

I didn’t have the unflavored creamer, so I used 2 cups of the vanilla creamer instead.  I love vanilla, so it was no problem for me.  It’s a bit sweet, but then again I like it that way.  Delicious!

Love love love this. I use Splenda, so lower carb. I used a little more tea, a lot more of the spices, and white pepper is a must. You need to be generous with your serving (HEAPING tbsp per cup)  or it will just be watery, and there will be some sludge... while the tea and milk/creamer products dissolve, the spices, of course, won't.

My daughter & I love this recipe so much! I use less sugar and have replaced it with Stevia. I also used all vanilla creamer because I forgot to buy the plain creamer. It is so relaxing and enjoyable to sip in the morning and evening! I am bottling this up as gifts for the holidays! We go through this recipe once per week! Thanks for sharing this perfect winter beverage!

I make this mix regularly. I passed the recipe along to a friend, along with a jar of the made mix, and two giant cups to commemorate her retirement. She loves it as much as I do. I add all the spices, and even toss in a half teaspoon of ground coriander. Love it!!!

I made it as written and then  tweaked to my taste (other than I did use monkfruit sweetener instead of sugar). I didn't like how much french vanilla creamer was in this, and I added more spices. If I were to make it again, I'd cut the french vanilla creamer altogether I think and make vanilla sugar with real vanilla. It was overwhelming.

I have used this recipe for years.  Made it for our girls to take to college every fall and winter.  They are still asking for it after 8 years.  One daughter is a teacher and had it in her desk for a quick hot drink and other teachers have started asking for it.

To make this diabetes friendly I replaced the sugar with an equal amount of Splenda for baking. I think next time I’ll use 1 cup of Splenda instead. Splenda is a wee tad sweeter than sugar. Another change I made was, instead of the individual spices, I used 2 Tbl. of pumpkin pie spice. 

This recipe is replacing Trader Joe’s spicy chai tea mix that I’m addicted to. Great copy cat recipe. When I want an extra creamy drink I make this with whole milk instead of hot water. Delicious!!! I bet a small amount of Baileys Irish Creme would be good too. Yummy!

Having tried a known brand and found this too sweet and thick, tried this recipe, love it, no thick stuff left in bottom of cup, like the fact that I can spice this up with whatever I have in and to taste, I did use demerara sugar as didn't have enough white in and worked really well, going to try with sweetner next as other half is diabetic and he likes this as well.

Very, very good. I cut down on the sugar (we don't like super sweet tea) and didn't use the ice tea as I prefer to use black tea bags. While the flavor is very good, I think I may add just a touch more spice the next time I make this. Thank you for a delicious recipe. I'll be making this for years to come.

I have tried making this at least 3 different times. Not a fan of the "gritty" left at the bottom of the cup and 2 tablespoons has virtually no flavor. I guess I'll give up and just buy a bag of chai tea mix.

REALLY love this recipe- did make a change- used 2 cups dry milk and 2 cups Vanilla Sugar instead of creamers and sugar. As suggested by others reviewers, I leave out the instant tea and brew a cup of strong tea to pour over the mix- even better, heat up some coconut milk and brew the tea bag in it. YUM! Think I'll go make another now... P.S. you do really need to finely grind everything together. 2 heaping tsp. to 10oz of tea/milk brew.

This is the best chai mix i have ever had, we will never go back to the commercial stuff again!  If you don't like it bold, this is not the recipe for you.  I made the recipe as written, with the optional nutmeg/allspice/white pepper addition, also i used the cooks note of adding vanilla extract to the sugar and omitting the vanilla powdered creamer.

Made this for a Christmas gift for my brother. He loved it.  Although when he opened the package he said "I got a bottle of sand!"  My said  "is it from Florida".  Thankfully he turned the bottle around.  Now to make a batch for myself.   I did add some nutmeg to it.  It is so easy to customize to your own taste with the addition of spices or not .   Thanks for the recipe!

update:   My brother is so happy with his Chai Tea.  I did not add the white pepper to it, but gave it to him on the side in case he wanted it.  He likes it better with he White pepper.  I made a second batch for myself.  Left some at home and brought some to keep at my desk.   Just Love it.

Second update :  just because of time I had let the mix sit for a week before,  It helped  to make this even better, giving the flavors  time to meld before putting it through the blender.

Super easy and I followed the recipe exactly as stated.  I used a blender for the first batch and a food processor for the 2nd one. The blender worked so much better! I made this for a gift for teachers at Christmas.

I reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups, omitted the vanilla creamer, added an extra tsp of ginger and the spices in notes (except for pepper). It was good enough to quell my need to buy the expensive powdered mixes. Next time I would definitely add the white pepper and maybe a little more ginger or cardamom because I like my chai spicier. This really is a good base recipe to play with and customize to your tastes, I'd start by making a quarter batch to get your proportions adjusted to taste. Good as is, but I would maybe use hot milk the next time. This may be due to leaving out the vanilla creamer. Expect a little bit of spice sludge at the bottom of your cup, but not much (just don't drink the last swallow). Really that part depends on the quality of your blender, I think.

I have been making this for years.  Recently I changed things up a bit and added 3 TBS of Turmeric for its health benefits and the taste is amazing!  Great Recipe, every time! Its even nice to add a touch of honey... enjoy!

We like this a lot, but found it to be a little too sweet and creamy for us, so we doubled the tea, reduced sugar to 2 cups and increased spices to 1-1/2 times. Delicious!

So delicious-this recipe makes for a beautiful spicy latte and it stores beautifully. The cardamom is a must. I was on the go today and was forced to stop by Strbks for a chai latte. I immediately ran home, poured the hot drink into a pan, and then added this mix. Tasted so much better LOL. A million thanks for this recipe.

We love Oregon chai and this is even better in my oppinion though I did make a few changes.  I used 2 cups of decaffeinated unsweetened tea,  2 cups nondairy creamer  1 cup powdered milk, 1 1/2  cups vanilla sugar 
( instead of vanilla creamer), and I used 2tsp. ginger, 2 tsp. cinnamon, and 2 tsp. garam masala. So good I too love that this recipe is so easy to personalize  :)

I absolutely love this recipe! Of course, being paleo I had to make a few modifications (stevia for sugar, no dairy) and would just add it to almond milk cold or hot depending on the mood. A little hard to mix at first but once it dissolves, you're in for a treat! Next time, I think I'll reduce the cardamom by half and replace with a little more cinnamon. If anyone is dairy free and wanting a chai fix, this recipe works.

We've been making this mix for years and both just love it  (without the sugar as we don't think it needs it and figure if you want it sweeter you can add a spoonful).  The only complaint I've had is that the spices seem to settle to the bottom of the cup, even though I would use the coffee/spice grinder before adding to the mix to then pulverize in the food processor or blender.  Well, YAY for the suggestion to use the coffee/spice grinder to pulverize the mix as well.  No settling to the bottom of the cup; no stir stir stir as I drink it.  Thank you to whoever came up with that.

Creamy and delicious - better than an expensive coffee shop drink, at a fraction of the cost. This would make a great gift - place some in a bell jar with a cute scoop and recipe card attached.

I increased spices by 1/4 tsp. each and decreased sugar to 2 cups.  For another batch, I used sugar-free French vanilla creamer, and it was delicious! If you make cold Chai, it's best to leave it in the fridge for a day, just as you would when making instant milk per package directions.

My mom and I both really liked this super easy recipe. We added all the extra spices but took out the cardamon and thought it turned out great. I don't like cloves at all but I still loved the final product. I do have a question though: my friend really loves chai tea but we just found out she's actually lactose intolerant. Does anyone have any suggestions for replacing the milk powder or could I just make the tea without it?

Omg I love it!!! I'm a big fan of chai tea and I love this recipe! My moms not a big fan because of how sweet it is but that's because she doesn't like things that are too sweet. I like it the way it is though. If your not a fan of sweet just cut down the sugar by a cup. I'm gonna go drink some more now bye!!

Easy to make.  Excellent flavor.  In light of the other reviews, I cut the sugar to 1 cup and only added 1 - 1.5 heaping tablespoons per mug.  We followed the cook's note to use vanilla extract instead of vanilla creamer.  We tried it with instant tea and added to a cup of brewed tea (before we bought the instant tea).  Both were excellent.

My 6 year old son says "It's awesome" and will give it to his teachers this Christmas.

Sam's Club has quit carrying Mystic Chai, so I gave this a shot. I like it better than Mystic Chai, and it's less than half the price. I made it with the extra spices suggested, and would do it that way again.

I had a request for a Chocolate version by never heard o golf it. I used the recipe as is Except in place of the vanilla creamer I used chocolate. It was just what she was looking for.
When I make it at home I do not add the sugar or powered sugar, I add it per cup, better regulating the sugar consumption. I also do this with the instant homemade hot cocoa mix.

I liked this recipe. I made as is, but added a teaspoon of all spice. This definitely tastes more like a vanilla chai than a spiced chai. Next time I will use more unflavored creamer and cut back on some of the French vanilla creamer. I also plan to add nutmeg next time. Overall, the recipe was tasty and easy.

I think this with extra spices is better than Oregon chai, and that stuff is pretty great! I didn't use non dairy creamer (that stuff is horrible)...I just substituted more nf milk powder and mixed 1/2 cornstarch and 1/2 sugar to make the 1 cup measure....I am in heaven....I am sending my mom and sister in law some!

I loved this on cold winter nights in front of the fireplace! It always makes the room smell good. I didn't use the cardamom because I didn't have any and I also must confess that I made it without the instant tea because I like to add it to fresh hot tea. I will make several cups of tea in the coffee pot and then add the mix to each cup.

This was very yummy.  I did use less sugar and it turned out great.  If you like it sweet, though, I'd definitely use the sugar amount from the recipe.

I haven't made this recipe yet but the only thing that I may do is substitute the sugar for Equal.  I will only add the Equal when I'm ready to drink it.

The flavor in this is so much more than what you buy in the store.  We keep this on our counter every year throughout the winter months.  It is wonderful!  I use soy milk with mine which is delicious!  Thank you for this recipe!

The most surprising thing to me about this was how difficult it is to find plain old unsweetened unflavored instant tea mix! Man o man, I went to about 4 stores before I found it. I don't like cloves, at all, so I subbed in allspice since it's similar but not as strong. I sampled the batch as I made it and found I needed to slightly increase the allspice (instead of cloves) and cinnamon just a little bit. This is really good. I'm giving it to some Chai Tea lovers in my life. Hope they like it.

Good, simple recipe.  The only change I made was to add ground allspice and I did not have any of the vanilla flavored coffee creamer but I didn't miss it.

Oh. My. Goodness.  This is FABULOUS.  I seriously can't believe how good it is compared to all the (tons) of chai I've bought.  I used regular French vanilla and plain creamers because I wasn't sure how the amounts if sugar free would translate, but I used 1 1/2 C. of Splenda (only) and it came out perfectly.  I also cut down on the cardamom (1/2 tsp.) because sometimes it seems pretty "bitey" to me, used 1/2 tsp. cloves (same reason), and added nutmeg.
Great recipe, Jo!

I thought this was fabulous!  After reading the other reviews, I did cut down on the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and added a little more of the spices.  It smells and tates so good.

Speaking as a chai addict- This is good but a little weak. I added more pdr tea and doubled many of the spices. As soon as I can find it I intend to try this with just a pinch anise (found in other recipes for chai mix) The proportions seem good though

This recipe is great! But I did omit the granulated sugar and put in 1 cup of powdered sugar. I also used fresh ground nutmeg. I didn't use any type of vanilla but I use hot water for my tea and add a shot of vanilla soy milk. Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

My father loves this tea SO MUCH that we have to keep it in a huge 44 oz. screw-top container. It's AWESOME. We just keep going through it over again! If you enjoy tea that is either chai or milked tea, try this recipe at least once because it's instant tea and addictively convenient.
If you mix 1/2 boiling water in the glass with the mix then add 1/2 milk and froth it up with an electric wisker it will taste just like Dunkin Donuts Vanilla Chai I swear it does. It is SO YUMMY!

This is the best tasting Chai Tea. The recipe was easy and simple.  I did not use French vanilla non-dairy creamer, but instead used 2C of powdered non-dairy creamer (recipe calls for 1C powdered non-dairy and 1C French vanilla powdered non-dairy creamer).  Also, I steam soy milk instead of water.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

I'm a chai tea fanatic, but I've never made my own till now. I love this recipe! I didn't use cardamom seeing as it's so pricey- instead, I used a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice, because chai has always reminded me slightly of that pumpkin pie flavor. I haven't tried this in hot tea yet; instead, I made a chai smoothie similar to one you'd get at Starbucks, if a little less creamy. I took a scoop of the mixture, a cup and a half of milk (or a mug's worth), and then a few ice cubes, and let it go in the blender till the ice cubes were chopped. YUM.

This is a really good tea.  I didn't have regular creamer so I used 1 1/2 cups of the vanilla creamer and 1 1/2 cups of the dry milk.  You can' buy tea this good, I'm really glad I tried it.  Hint:  I have a vitamixer and mixed it in that, I don't think a regular mixer would work.

This tastes wonderful!!!  I and my children LOVE it!  We are from the states currently living in New Zealand and really missed being able to get our favorite chai tea mix.  This is WAY better and so easy!  To luluweezie...  I found non-dairy creamer in Christchurch at Countdown(Woolworths and Foodtown).  It's called coffee whitener here and it's a "Home Brand" label.  Hope this helps.

I found this recipe to make as a thank you to my group of friends who helped me start a book club and my cousin, who loves chai tea, begged me for a separate batch for herself! One of my husband's co-workers likes to mix it with a cup of hot milk instead of water but this was my first introduction to chai & I can't imagine liking anything better than this! Thanks so much for a wonderful recipe!

Sounds yummy. Cardamom is very pricey though. For a quick light chai I just steep a chai tea bag (from the store) in hot skim milk then add a packet of Splenda. Not very fancy I know but it taste like the real deal.

I love this recipe.  I always add cool milk or cream after I've made a cup, but that is because I don't like my hot drinks "piping" hot.   This is actually a family favorite.

A good Chai tea mix!  Used a coffee grinder to mix/refine all the ingredients.  Reduced the sugar to 1-1/2 cups, but may add a bit more in the future.  Next time, will try adding vanilla extract to sugar and omit the vanilla creamer.

way too sweet.  cut back the sugar by 1/4 the first time, then cut it back by half the second and still too sweet.  i tend to like my chai with a stronger spice flavor (like Tazo)

This recipe has served as the baseline for my own chai mix, but I do not actually use this recipe as is.

Really, really yummy. I used the recommendation to flavour the sugar with the vanilla. next time I might reduce the sugar by a 1/2 cup and add the white pepper and all spice to see the difference. Made as written (wihtout the vanilla creamer) and very good-thanks!

I tripled the spices and think this mix is as good as I get at my favorite place.  I do have a problem though and would appreciate some suggestions.  When my tea sit for too long or gets too cool it turns into mush at the bottom of my cup, actually alot.  Do you think it is low grade podwder milk or the use of ejoyr Stevia powder rather than milk.

I followed this recipe and it was a big hit. By the time I made batch #2, I heard that non-dairy creamer wasn't one of the healthiest ingredients so I tried to get creative... so far without luck. Just wanted to share that powdered soy milk is not a good substitute. Anyone have a tasty and healthy alternative? 
For now, my next batch will be without creamer and just tell everyone to mix it with hot cream or milk.

This mix is awesome!  I made several batches this year and gave them as Christmas gifts.  I got many positive comments and some that asked for the recipe so they could make more.  I also agree that the cardamom is a good addition.  It is an expensive spice, but check your grocery's bulk spices section.  I was able to get about 3 tablespoons of it for $.88.  I also love the flavor of allspice added in.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

This is a fantastic mix as an addition to a good cup of high-quality black or green tea. It also doubles  a spice flavoring for pumpkin or squash cream soups and mashed spiced sweet potatoes. Deeelish!

Has wonderful flavor and is a delicious treat, but I also had the problem of spices "sinking" to the bottom of the cup and so I didn't use it for gifts, as I had intended. The silver lining: a whole batch for me to enjoy all winter. P.S.: any friends I served it to, said the stuff at the bottom of the cup didn't bother them, and it didn't bother me either!!

I just made 5 batches of this to give out to friends/family for Christmas.  I haven't given many out yet, so I have yet to hear what others think, but I think this is a FANTASTIC recipe!    I recently bought Tastefully Simple Oh My Chai!  It was very good, but very expensive for that small container.  I really thought this tasted just like it.    I followed the original recipe exactly, aside from putting my vanilla in the sugar as recommended in the footnotes instead of buying the vanilla creamer.  It worked out wonderfully.  I word to the wise though, on one of my batches, I didn't stir the sugar/vanilla mixture regularly and let it dry for a good day.  I then had the basically chisel it out of the bowl.  So...stir regularly while it is drying!    Also, please, do yourself a favor and DO NOT SKIP the cardamom!!!  It is ESSENTIAL to the flavor of this.  It may seem very expensive, but that jar will take you a long way and this will still be a very economical tea mix.

I have never tried chai before making this recipe so I cannot make any comparisons. I do think this is a very flavorful recipe. I prefer the richness of steamed milk over mixing with just hot water. I added all spices including the optionals; used vanilla extract in sugar instead of vanilla creamer. I prefer spicy to bland and believe the white pepper adds a pleasant warming after taste to this beverage.     Cardamom is a staple in my kitchen. Cardamom is available in the bulk food section of a nearby grocery store for just over $15/lb.; expensive, but for the amount required for this recipe, affordable. Being accustomed to the flavor of cardamom, I feel this recipe would suffer without it.    I will certainly make this again once my current supply runs out.

Worked perfectly for me. I followed everything exactly with the exception of the sugar, I used splenda blend and only used 1 1/2 cups. I did add the nutmeg, allspice, and pepper. Being from a Scandinavian family I always have cardamom on hand, but I did see it was only $10 at walmart so not too bad. and its a great spice for ground beef and soups.   I recommend this recipie to anyone, I did a taste test with a popular coffee shop brand of Chai Oregon Chai and we liked the homemade stuff better!  This has made my Christmas so special as I could not afford gifts so made 6 batches and have plenty of gifts and love to share with friends and family. Thank you!

The taste was good.  I used splenda 1 1/2 cups.  I just couldn't get past the sediment of the spices.  I blended everything through a blender until it was fine, but still ended up with residue.

Sooooooo good. This is the best chai tea mix there is! And probably the best I've ever tasted. I only made 2 small adjustments: I halved the cardamom, and I opted no for the pepper, but I did add the nutmeg. Delicious, delicious, delicious! I prefer and iced chai tea, so I mix up 1 cup hot water, to 2 tablespoons mix, let cool and then whip in the blender. I add some ice, and viola! Instant iced chai tea!

This is PHENOMENAL!!!! So comforting on an icy day. I love it!! Plus it makes a ton so if you are just making it for one or two people it will last at least the whole fall and winter. I have made this at least 2 times in the past year. Everyone I give it to loves it, everyone I give the recipe to loves it. If you are a Chai Latte kind of person definitely try this recipe!!!!

This was great! I have my whole office hooked now.  I added all the extra spices suggested and cut the sugar down by 1/2 a cup.  Also added a little liquid vanilla and let it mix in and dry out instead of buying seperate vanilla creamer powder.  Have made it several times now and so have several of the girls in the office.

This drink mix has become a staple in my cupboards for all time! I cut back the sugar to 1 cup but that is the only change I have made to this recipe. I do process the mix in my Cuisinart but it still is grainy at the bottom of the cup. Never mind! I love this mix, have made it for friends at Christmas time and take it with me when I travel. It is every bit as good as the Trader Joe's Chai tea and I like the fact I can make this decaffinated!

This is a wonderful recipe. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 only because the full amount of sugar is way too sweet. I reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and it is perfect. If you use 1 1/2 cups sugar then this will make 1 full quart jar and just enough more to make yourself a test cup of nice hot chai.

I got talked into making this for a friend on the exchange, Cheesecakemama.  I don't have instant black tea, but I have everything else (except plain non dairy creamer--I just used 2x as much french vanilla non dairy creamer), so I made the mix without the tea and steeped a black tea bag in hot water.  Not a bad mix.  I made one serving and cut the sugar to 2 tspns but I think I'd cut it even more--this is very sweet!  I really taste the cloves and cardamom, so if you're unsure about those flavors, I'd cut them down a bit.  I'd be willing to buy instant black tea and make the mix for friends, but if I drink it myself I'd probably use more of the mix ratio to water--I like my chai thicker.  Thanks for the recipe!

I found the original recipe too sweet - and I like sweet tea. I doubled the recipe but did not double the amount of sugar. I also used the Splenda/Sugar mix and used 1 3/4 cups. Love the cardamon, added the nutmeg. I put in milk and very creamy.

This is the first time I've made this. I didn't add the extra suggested spices. I substituted Splenda for the sugar. I mixed the dry ingredients with a wire whisk before using the food processor. I'm definitely going to try it with milk and use decaf/the extra spices next time.

As stated by someone else,this is JUST like Tastefully Simple's chai.  I added the extra spice in the header, didn't use the vanilla creamer, I just added the vanilla to the sugar and let it dry. timesed the recipe by 4 and now have lovely gifts for teacher's and friends!!! (I put them in small mason jars with holiday fabric on top).  I like it better with 1/2 hot milk, 1/2  hot water; it makes it creamier!!!  Either way - YUMMMY

I just made this without instant tea and 1 1/2 cups Splenda instead of sugar to give as Christmas gifts. Just add to cup of hot tea green or black, and it is excellent. 
Thank you for this wonderful recipe

Very tasty!  Good combination of spices.  I had whole cardamon pods, so I opened the pods and ground the seeds in the coffee grinder, made about 1/4 tsp, and it was plenty (freshly ground spices are potent)!  Actually made the entire mix smell like cardamon so I was a little worried, but it blends in nicely and doesn't overwhelm the flavor when mixed into water.  My cinnamon was not so fresh, so I added some extra.  I did add the extra spices.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out great.  Not too sweet like some brands of the commercial products can be, just sweet enough.  Perfect!

What a wonderful recipe.  I did add the nutmeg and allspice 1 teaspoon of each .  I only made one modification (from other's reviews) I cut the sugar down to 1 1/2 cups.  And I have done it with Splenda before to make it more lo-cal.

Love it! Love it! Cardamom is really expensive, so I added nutmeg, and will try other variations next time.  I'm definitely thinking of making this for all our friends at Christmas time! Makes a GREAT smoothie, too!

What a wonderful recipe.  I went a bit less on the sugar, but still sweet enough.  Didn't add as much cardamom, but the smell and taste were still there.  This is a great recipe for the home Chai tea drinkers and for gifts as well.  I made copies and will keep this one in the recipe book under **favorites**  Enjoy you Chai!!

Great recipe! I live in Japan & could not come across and cardon.. so that wasn't added into the mixture.. But I added pumpkin spice instead. But the mixture still didn't taste quite right, so I added an additional 2 tbsps of cocoa mix to each cup.. MMM MMM GOOD! This recipe makes SOOO MUCH MIX!! Almost 48 oz of dry mix! But I love it! I keep a container at work & one at home!

I made this for my daughter who is addicted to Starbuck's Chai Tea, she buys one almost everyday.  She thought this was actually better than theirs!  Since I made this she has saved alot of money, and we're getting ready to make some more.

I added the white pepper, allspice, and nutmeg it was really good.  The cardamom is a little strong so next time I will only do half of what it calls for.  I also only did 2 cups of sugar and used fat free vanilla creamer.  I like to make mine with water then top it off with milk.  Very very good, compares to Starbucks and Panera!

I made a batch of this to give my friend for Xmas.  She absolutely adored it!

I doubled the amount of spices and used approx 1 C of the Splenda/Sugar blend instead of sugar.  It's just the right amount of spicy, and creamy and sweet without being cloying and overpowering.  

I would definitely make this again!! Yum!

What a great drink mix to have on hand, especially during our cold winter months in northeastern Ohio. Thanks to all the great reviews, I  (1)reduced the sugar to 2C.(will reduce to 1-1/2C. next time)(2)omitted the cardamom and (3)added the allspice, nutmeg and white pepper listed in the header. Thanks for a "keeper"!

Fabulous holiday recipe to have around or give away as gifts. 
I did what another reader suggested - added about 1/2 tsp vanilla to the sugar and blended it separately and only used regular creamer (not vanilla). Also added the extra spices - extra white pepper b/c we like it spicy! I also only used 1/2 the sugar, and those who like it sweeter just add a little honey (or sugar).

This made such a nice and simple presentation for neighbor Christmas gifts in glass jars with ribbon and tags.  The hardest part was refraining from drinking myself.  Rave reviews!  I did add more sugar (3 c.).  Yes, I like it very sweet.

Wayyyy! Too sweet. I decreased the sugar to 1 1/2 cups as suggested in other reviews but even that is too much. Other than that the taste is great. I'd make it again and try just 1 cup. Its easier to add more if you need it. I used all the spices as the recipe stated including optional, but did not use white pepper...didnt have it. Also the only unsweetened instant tea I could find was decaf.

I would really like to make this stuff - but i can't seem to get ahold of the instant tea anywhere?  I live in Alberta, Canada.

Also, i would like to give this as a gift to friends and neighbors for christmas...what kind of packaging should i use?

Too sweet with 2.5 cups of sugar. I used only 2 cups and I will probably use less the next time I make it. Otherwise it was delicious!

I gave this mix as a gift to a friend who loves Chai tea. She loved it as well as her family. She requested the recipe-defeating my ability to surprise her again as a gift! I didn't omit the cardamon, but found some other uses for it in baking. It is a unique flavor to Chai Tea and it should be included.

I used Splenda instead of sugar and only added half of what was called for, it turned out really good.  It's messy to make, but pretty worth it

My teenagers love this mix!  I have to make it several times a year for them.  I made some and gave it as Christmas gifts this year too.  It's always a hit! I made 4 batches before Christmas and I just finished a 5th batch today.

I never had Chai Tea before and I thought this recipe was really good! I liked it better with milk than water. I also found that buying the cardamom bulk at the store (fred meyer)in the health food section was much much cheaper.

Flavor was great, but the tea did turn out kind of gritty.  I made the no sugar variety, and besides all of the spices left in the cup when you drink it, the recipe was good.  Not really too much you can do about the spices though in this recipe, as they are what gives chai it's flavor.

This is a great recipe, even my 14 yodd loved it.  The only thing I changed was I didn't add the non-dairy creamer, instead I added 5 tsp of half & half after adding the hot water.  The only reason I didn't give this a 5 star rating was because even though I "pulverized" the powder mix, (to prepare it) at the end of my tea drink was leftover spices.  I'm not sure how to fix that problem but otherwise it was delicious!

this mix came along just in the nick of time. i usually buy at it sam's, but they stopped carrying it. i can't get over how great this is, and i find it much more flavorful than the canned stuff. i mixed it up in my food processor and i couldn't be happier with the results. thanks for a great recipe and a wondeful gift idea.

This is now a mix I will keep on hand always and worth every one of it's 5 stars.  I took the advise of others and cut down on the sugar by 1/2 cup, added the nutmeg and pepper (I didn't have white pepper so I used black and it worked just fine)and added a dollop of whipped cream on top.  WOW!!  I would suggest to definately use food processor, it cuts down on the gritty stuff at the bottom of the glass.  I sent the Friendship Tea mix last year and everyone was calling for the recipe.  I am using this mix this year and I am going to foward the recipe with the package because I know everyone is going to want to make this one, as am I, over and over.  Thank you Julie

Tastes great - just as good as a coffee/tea shop.  I followed suggestions to decrease sugar...made recipe to my liking.  Spices did make this a little pricey to make but now that I have the spices, I can make it again for little cost.  Doubled recipe so I could share as Christmas gifts.

I made this for gifts without the expensive cardamom and I included the optional spices. I tried it myself and immediately had a second cup it was that good.  I suppose it's not as authentic without the cardamom, but my goodness it's costly, and it makes a good drink without it.

This is so good!!  I had first heard about this when I went to a Tastefully Simple party. I didn't think it sounded good.  I tried it and it was so good!!  I like it sweet, reminds me of hot chocolate.  I think this recipe tastes like the Tastefully Simple, but you save so much more by making it.  When I bought the stuff I didn't realize you were supposed to get the original AND French Vanilla non dairy creamer.  I just had the French Vanilla, so I just used that.  I like it so much, I don't think I will try and make it with the original.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe is terrific!  I used all the spices, including the suggested extras (except the white pepper - didn't have any on hand) and it's wonderful.  I like mine over ice, although it's a little more watered-down if you don't wait until it cools first.  Also, I like to make mine with 1/2 splenda, 1/2 sugar to cut the sugar content.  Not as delicious as the boxed Tazo Chai you buy in the store, but nearly as good at a fraction of the cost.  A real keeper!

Definately a keeper!!  I'm a big chai drinker but have a hard time paying a couple $$ each time I stop at the coffee shop.  This makes it a bit more economical for my budget and I can enjoy it anytime I want.  The spices may be a bit expensive but are well worth the price, without them this wouldn't be a 5 star recipe.  Try "Penzeys" spices..their prices can't be beat and you can get smaller amounts than at a grocery store.  I did make a few changes.  I only added 1 t. ginger and 2 c. of suger. This will be added to my holiday gift baskets!!

This recipe is wonderful.  I've made it twice already.  My daughter is making gift bags of the tea for a party she's hosting.  The recipe is perfect!

Absolutely love this recipe! Just what you need to warm your tummy on those cold winter days! I blended the mixture in my coffee grinder and didn't seem to have a problem with it being gritty at the bottom of the cup. I added pumpkin pie spice, as previously suggested, to my last batch for a great fall flavor!

I just made up a batch of this, using the optional additional spices.  I ground all the spices fresh except the ginger.  It's AWESOME!!!  This will be great to bag up for Christmas gifts next season!

Tastes just as good as the store down the street that sells Chai Tea mixes. I followed the recipe to the T and I wouldn't change a thing.

My husband loved this.  Made it last year for a gift for a friend, and he got to have a drink with the extra.  He asked me if I would make it for him this year!

This is the BEST chai tea, even better than what you can buy pre-made! I drink it all year long.  I have also used the sugar free creamers & Splenda to make it for my Grandmother who is diabetic & now she is hooked!

Fantastic recipe - just what I was looking for!  I used 2 cups sugar instead of the full amount.  It's great to know that Splenda will work, too.

Don't give up on finding reasonably priced ground cardamom, as Tone's spices have it in the small .45 oz. containers (4 to 5 tablespoons) for less than a dollar.

I gave the mix to several friends for Christmas gifts.  My daughter who loves Chai tea, was amazed that I made it, as it tastes as good as the expensive commercial mixes.

Don't be afraid to increase the spices!  I like it spicy and my co-workers are hooked.  Chai lifts the spirit according to ancient Indian beliefs - Amen!

I made this and packaged it as small Christmas gifts.  I really liked the taste, a little too sweet for me...next time I am going to try it with a little less sugar and a little more spice.  Very good!

I love the flavor of this Chai tea. This recipe offers a perfect canvas of individual flavors to work with. I found that grinding the mix until it had the same texture of hot cocoa mix allows the spices in the mixture to disolve evenly in the water. Considering a large Chai at the coffee shop is over $3, this recipe will save me lots of money and the flavor is very comforting.
