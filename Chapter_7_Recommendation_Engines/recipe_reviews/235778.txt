This blew everyone away, made them think I was a genius. And it's SO easy! I used pine nuts for decoration instead of pecans. But the BEST thing about this? There was so much left over after Christmas dinner (five people served the first go-round; start eating from the bottom up to do the following) that I placed the leftover top into a glass container and froze it. End of July, I take it out of the freezer, and it is PERFECT still! The parsley looks fresh, the cheese is creamy. I would not hesitate to serve this as-is out of the freezer, so, if you need to prepare ahead of time, go ahead and freeze! Knowing that just the two of us won't it all before it goes bad, I made potato and onion au gratin with it, parsley, pine nuts and all, adding just a bit more cheddar (making a roux of milk, flour, etc. Use the tree as the cheese in the recipe, see?) . WOW! Delicious and a tremendous save of food. The potato casserole won't last long.

I made my cheese ball with dry (homemade) ranch dressing, and it went fast. Used the decorating suggestions, and it was so much easier than it looked, impressing everyone!!

This went over so well at our Christmas dinner and it was quickly eaten. I added a little blue cheese, too, which gave it a little extra!

I added a bit of asiago cheese to the foor processer to combine and then shaped w/my hands.  Loved  by all...asiago gave it a nice flavor and pepped it up a bit.
