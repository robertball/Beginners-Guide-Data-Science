I have made these and think their great however they are not for the person who wants a "Cinnabon" roll not enough butter and cinnamon sugar but thats why I like them. Also to avoid getting squished cinnamon rolls from trying to cut them if you use dental floss ( by placing floss under roll and crossing it over the top) you will get perfectly shaped rolls every time.

I almost passed this recipe up because I read that it is made the night before.
I didn't like the ingredients in the other recipies (boxed cake mixes, etc)
so I came back to this one.  I made them yesterday and am making them now
as I write this.
I didn't store them, I made them the same day.  I let the dough rise til doubled
and then punched it down and rolled it out.  I then let it rest and rolled it out again
before continuing. The bread is tender.  My old recipe came out as hard and that's why I was searching
for a new recipe.  This is it.  I have no need to look for another cinnamon roll recipe.
I did have to use a larger then 8 X 8 pan.
Thanks Sharon for this recipe.

Best cinnamon roll recipe I've found so far.  I doubled the recipe and added 1/4 cup melted crisco.  I also made the filling x 4. I like it gooey.  Frost with:  Cream together 8 oz. cream cheese, stick butter, 1 tsp. vanilla, powdered sugar to desired sweetness and milk to desired consistancey.  Frost hot. mmmm!  Good job Sharon!

Mmmm...Now these cinnamon rolls are fabulous.  Truthfully, if I were to try these and the cinnamon rolls my mom buys from the Kroger bakery, I wouldn't be able to tell the difference.  They were very light and flaky.  Now, ladies... if your husband is like mine and his weakness is cinnamon rolls, get ready for a fun night!

Hint: I doubled the filling because I wanted a very sweet roll with a strong cinnamon flavor, added about 1 tsp. vanilla (this addition gave it a wonderfully floral after taste), and used white sugar because I didn't have brown sugar, then glazed the tops with 1/2 filling mix and a few Tbsps. of corn syrup.  It was ooey-gooey sticky!!!  Becareful not to overwork the dough...I came close but I was fine.

Mmmmm...SO GOOD!

MY HUSBAND FELL ASLEEP EARLY ON ME THE OTHER NIGHT SO I THOUGHT I WOULD MAKE THESE FOR THE NEXT MORNING.  THEY DID NOT RISE VERY GOOD IN THE REFIGERATOR BUT AS SOON AS I LET THEM SIT ON THE COUNTER FOR ABOUT 45 MINS THEY RAISED RIGHT UP.  THESE WERE THE BEST CINNAMIN ROLLS I HAVE EVERY MAD. I DON'T AGREE WITH SOME OTHER PEOPLE BY SAYING THEY ARE HEAVY.  MINE CAME OUT PERFECT AND MY HUSBAND WANTS ME TO MAKE THESE FOR CHRISTMAS MORNING.

Bake this at 375 for about 15 minutes. 400 is WAY too hot!

With that adjustment, this smells, looks, and tastes wonderful. People RAVED. I used a lot more cinnamon than called for + a sprinkling of nutmeg and cut the rolled log using thread. Also made a cream cheese frosting, which I assume was implied. I had to wait longer than 45 minutes between setting to rise and baking, so they were HUGE and really jammed in there! Next time I'll make "more" by slicing them thinner, lying them loosely, and letting them rise longer.

Even though i am only an elementary student I love to bake. I thought these cinnamon rolls were so easy to make  and really quick. I recommend this recipe to anyone who wants to make cinnamon rolls in one hour and a half. these are also really good, taste just like Cinnabon.

I also changed the temperature to 350 and it worked great.  I also added shortening (1/4 c.) to the recipe because most doughs have some sort of fat in them, this also worked great.  I wasn't sure if the shortening was mistakenly left out.  These rolls seem softer than other recipes that I have used.  This recipe is a keeper.

This recipe was a big hit with the coworkers.  I found that the thinner the dough was rolled, the better.  The sweeter and more sugary, the better!

I was surprised at the minimal amount of ingredients needed. That is why I chose it because I had everything on hand. These were great! I could'nt wait till morning so we had them for desert that night. My family loved it. Thanks for the submit.

Hmm, this was not bad, just not as good as I expected. I'm a fairly experienced yeast bread baker, but maybe I just need to practice cinnamon rolls more. They came out dry - I think 400 degrees for 20 minutes was too long. Surprisingly, the 1 Tbs cinnamon was a little too much (I honestly didn't expect that, because I really like cinnamon, and I realize this is subjective). Also they didn't rise enough in the frig overnight, but they did rise fine on the counter top when I took them out for about an hour before baking. I'm not going to say this was no good, but maybe it needs some tweaking and practice for my family & our tastes. Thanks for the recipe, though! I enjoyed trying it out.

I'm only giving this recipe 4 stars instead of 5 since I did minor changes to it and didn't follow it EXACTLY. I basically nearly doubled the filling so there was more flavor and gooeyness. Also, I didn't let them sit in the fridge over night either. Instead, after they were assembled, I covered them with a towel and let them rise for 45 mins, then baked em. They came out twice the size and were very good.   I also made a simple icing sugar frosting of 1 cup icing sugar, 2-3 tbsp milk, 1/2 tsp vanilla, mix, and then spoon over the buns when they're still hot so it melts. Mmm...

I love these cinnamon rolls! I've been making this recipe for several years. I like it because, in terms of cinnamon rolls, it is very easy and requires few ingredients. I usually don't let them sit overnight, but rather start earlier in the day and let them rise until doubled and bake them for lunch or dinner. It's very important to put the butter on first and sprinkle the cinnamon and sugar on top. A couple times, when I was distracted, I mixed the butter with the cinnamon and sugar and spread that on, and the result was not nearly as good. I cut the cinnamon rolls with floss (slide underneath and cross over). I serve these with a simple glaze of powdered sugar, vanilla, a pinch of cinnamon and enough milk to make it glaze-like.

I really liked these. They were soft and fluffy and baked perfectly. I did substitute buttermilk for some of the water, which gave it a nicer taste I think.

I've made this a bunch of times.  It's one of the fastest cinnamon roll recipes that I've found, and it doesn't take any milk, which is great.  I still add some confectioner's sugar sometimes as a glaze

Perfect! I used all-purpose flour, for more tenderness, and rather than overnight, I let dough rise until doubled and baked them right a way. I added a handful of chopped walnuts to the filling, as a nice option, but this recipe really needs no  adjustments, IMO. However, next time I will bake them in a slightly larger pan, such as an 8x11, or maybe even in a cupcake pan!

Great recipe! I used the vanilla glaze also found on this site for the top. I'm always nervous to work with yeast and this has come out great everytime. I've made it once the night before and once the same day and both times they were yummy. I increase the filling a little bit because I love gooey rolls.

These are so easy to make! I have little cooking experience but they turned out delicious. I put them in the fridge overnight, then let them rise in a 100 degree oven for 15 minutes before baking them at 350. I think 18 minutes would have been better, the brown edges dried out as they cooled. I also made a frosting from cream cheese, butter, powdered sugar and a tad of milk. Absolutely wonderful!

This recipe is quick and easy. Used 2 and 1/4 teaspoons of instant yeast, as that's all that's available today. Baking Is Awesome has a quick recipe for icing... One cup powdered sugar, one teaspoon vanilla, two tablespooons of whole milk. Also added 1 teaspoon of fresh lemon juice to cut the sweetness. I'd make this one again.

this recipe was great! and so easy to make. i threw all the ingrediets in my breadmaker on the dough cycle  and then rolled it outand put the cinnamon and brown sugar in it. a helpful hint: for those of us who buy the jars of yeast instead of the pouches, a .25 ounce package is the same as 1/2 a tablespoon, or 7.39 ml!

This recipe was so simple! I made them the same night and they were lovely. I did add a little extra butter/sugar/cinnamon mixture because I like mine a little extra gooey and sweet. I can't wait to try this overnight and see how they are in the morning. :) EDIT: I also noticed people had said these didn't freeze well. I froze half a batch so I could have one on mornings I work, since the last thing I want to do after work is bake, and they were simply delicious!

Love this recipe! I have been making it and using the same recipe for cinnamon bread, everyone loves my cinnamon rolls/bread. Very easy to make. I personally love cinnamon, so I always add extra cinnamon and brown sugar. Highly recommend it to cinnamon roll lovers~

these turned out great! I added chopped pecans after sprinkling the brown sugar. . I also let the dough rest on the countertop for about an hour before rolling & cutting.

Very good recipe,I used more sugar & cinnamon than called for & next time I will use even more.Also,roll the dough as thin as you can if you want them to be really sweet/cinnamon-y.I think maybe a little crisco or melted butter in the dough would make the rolls a bit more sticky,so I think I will try that too on the next batch.

Very good recipe.  The few changes I used was half unbleached and half whole wheat, raw sugar instead of white, and kosher salt over table salt.  Very good, not overly sweet.  Something that I would give my child over cinnamon rolls you get in stores.

I made these for dinner, and between the four people at home, they were all gone by the next morning!!!!! An easy way to cut these is to use a long thread, put it under the cinnamon roll, bring the sides up to the top and cross them, then just pull, and they don't come ouwt squashed at all..... I hope I explained well!

I added 2 Tbs butter to the dough. I haven't tried it without the extra butter so I don't know about the comparison. Also, mine were ready after baking for 16 minutes. I added walnuts and raisins to the filling. I thought they were fantastic. I was able to have them finished in about 1.5 hours. I used a 9x13" pan as they took up a lot of space. There was no way I could fit them into a smaller square pan.

Very simple, delicious recipe! Just like our favorite restaurant makes them. They did not rise in my refrigerator, though. Also, we added more filling, including chopped pecans. Other than that, followed recipe exactly.

This recipe was really tasty.  My husband loves cinnamon rolls, so I decided to give them a try for his birthday.  It's the first time I've ever made them, so I was a little timid to change the recipe as some recommended, but everything worked out really well.  I added just under 1/4 c. crisco to the dough as suggested.  The bread is so soft!  I also used the suggested cream cheese frosting.  My husband requested chocolate chips, so I added some minis and it was delicious!  Next time I'll increase the brown sugar as I think I'd prefer it a little gooier, but overall it was delicious!

This is the best recipe I have ever found on here, ever. The first time I made them my family were actually in shock as to how delicious they are. My brother ate 7 that evening because they are just so addictive! And the recipe isn't even too difficult!

I had to add MUCH more flour than it called for because the dough was so sticky before kneading! It also didn't rise like I thought it would, but it was Korea-OK'd by the family as a slightly sweet breakfast or snack.^^

Oh wow, these are good. I've made them twice so far, and they turned out better when I used the KitchenAid to mix/knead the dough and when I made the dough the night before. I frost them with cream cheese frosting, and they disappear in no time flat!!

These cinnamon rolls are fantastic.  However, I do use a little extra ingredients to make them extra gooey.  Thumbs up!

At first I was a little skeptical about this recipe as there was no milk or butter in the dough.  However, needing to quickly justify my brand new professional mixer to hubby and not having enough flour for anything more, I made these.  They are great for empty nesters, such as us, as they aren't a large amount.  They 'could' dry out but since it is not a large batch, they tend to disappear rather quickly.  Plus, I can make these rather quickly in the evening (to justify the mixer).  Not too difficult to make and great to make the night before and bake up quick in the morning.

I love these buns. These can also be made the night before and put in the fridge until the next morning. I normally let them sit on the counter about 30 mins before I put them in the oven to bake. I made a different kind of cinnamon roll last week and while I was making them, my husband said "why are you trying a new recipe? The one you always make tastes so good!" You will enjoy these for sure. Thank you!

My first time with Cinnamon rolls and very easy I must say. The best thing I liked about this recipe is preparing it at night and letting it rise in the fridege as I normally don't have time to start from scratch in the morns due to the rush. Thanks.

These are delicious. I followed some advice of the other reviewers and placed them in the oven on warm with the door cracked after taking them out of the fridge. They puffed up beautifully. I'd also recommend a bake time of about 15 minutes. Perfect for holiday mornings!

Absolutely the best cinnamon rolls i've ever made!!! Fantastic recipe! Quite easy and yummy!!! My only advice is, you don't have to limit your rise time to 45 minutes. The longer they rise, the better they will taste. The rising in the fridge doesn't work nearly as well as letting them sit in an airtight covered pan on top of a warming oven. Fantastic recipe over all!

These were great! The best I have made. I used milk instead of water to grow the yeast. I also doubled the recipe the second time because there just wasn't enough for my big family the first. I let them rise on the warming oven for 45mins- an hour instead of in the fridge.

Even though they weren't the best cinnamon rolls I have ever had, they were still really good and I will be making them again.  I added an icing with 2 c. powdered sugar, 1 T butter, 1 tsp. vanilla, and 2 1/2 tsp milk.  My family loved them...

This is a fantastic recipe!!! It's not too rich and easy to make. When I take it out of the fridge in the morning I leave the tea towel on it and put it in 150* oven with the door agar to kick start the rising process, when it's risen I simply remove the tea towel and turn the oven up to 350*

I cook a lot, but I don't bake a lot, and these were easy! Not really really quick, but worth the time.(I made them while playing a game of scrabble! They have to be easy!) I used the oven at 350, and added more sugar and cinnamon to the middle...I love 'em gooey. I topped with a simple confectioners sugar icing with a drop of orange extract, and some cream cheese mixed in. Delicious, and everyone loved them! My boyfriend eats several of them for breakfast, and sneaks them throughout the day... you know it's a success then!

Hi 
I made the rolls and they were good but had to use only 3-¾ cups flower instead of 5 cups, for a double batch. I always use the little sticky and pull away from the side method. 
Also 400 degrees is way to hot for yeast bread I baked them at 350 
But it is a good and easy recipe thank you again

It was alright. I went with this recipe because i didn't have milk and didn't want to use add-ins like pudding mix or mashed potatoes. It's a fairly straightforward yeast dough, and did rise fairly well in the fridge overnight, but it definitely needed some time on the counter to really rise to it's fullest potential before going in the oven. Despite other reviewers saying it was overspiced i used the full tablespoon of cinnamon and was really disappointed-they were terribly bland. Still, it gets points for simplicity, and the dough itself is a good basic dough.

This is a great recipe ! I've tried a few other cinnamon rolls recipes and they all came out really hard. This came out really soft and chewy. I added some raisins because my family likes it that way and that was the only change I made. This recipe is a real keeper ! I have made a few batches of these and it came out great every time !

soft, light fluffy, slightly crunchy on the bottom. Really, perfect cinnamon roll recipe. I made them vegan by replacing the egg with 1/4 cup oil, and I only used about 2 cups flour.  Sooo good, and all my friends ate them up!

This is a good, but do it in a 9x13" pan. I did it in a 8x8" and it is way too much dough for that size and the center did not cook.

This was my first time, ever, making cinnamon rolls. I LOVED them! It was so easy. I will make these over and over again. I made them for someone who is VERY picky about what she eats and she loved them.

Wish I could give it a 5, but it is not of my taste, I have been baking cinnamon rolls using cinnabon clone recipe , but since I bake them for my coffee shop and I wanted to save some bucks by not using milk and butter as the other recipe calls for, so I trie this one.This recipe is good if you want to cut some calories or money but not if you want a creamy buttery taste.My rolls turned out like buns though I had added some butter in the dough but still the rolls were flaky and bready.:(..none of my customers liked it.

The dough rose perfectly and the filling was great too..in fact..I was quite surprised how much it tasted like Cinnabon! The only prob was that the first batch became rock hard on 200 C so the next batch I baked on 125C! heck of a difference!

Not my favorite. The bread was so plain even after my addition of nutmeg that with a different filling it could have been a garlic roll. It did not taste like a sweet roll dough.

We make these every year on Christmas Eve and eat them on Christmas morning. They're very easy to make and sooo delicious! The only thing we do differently is that we mix the butter, sugar, and cinnamon together and them spread it onto the dough. After they bake, I add a vanilla glaze - what a treat on Christmas!!

I made these twice but only baked them for 10 minutes the second time (instead of 20) because they got a little too brown and crispy on the outside. 10 minutes worked out much better.  Other than that, it was a delicious and simple recipe.

these cinnamon rolls were ok. I made them precisely to directions, but found that they were not quite what i wanted.  It wasnt bad, but just a bit too dry for my liking- which is a soft, gooey roll. If i use this recipe again, i'll use more butter and sugar in the filling and cook them for 10 mins less.

Quick simple recipe, I did substitute several things for my benefit.  1) I used organic maple syrup instead of white sugar 2) Whole Wheat Flour instead of white flour 3) Sea salt instead of regular salt 4) One cold vegetarian egg 6)Olive Oil instead of butter 7) Raw brown sugar instead of granulated  I also doubled the amount of cinnamon.  It was delicious and they swelled out large. I did add a bit too much brown sugar so it was very sweet with some icing I made from another recipe. All in all this is a great recipe and I do intend to make it again in the future.

These were fantastic and quickly gobbled up!  I added two tablespoons of melted butter to temper the egg and add the fat that others commented was lacking.  I also added some candied walnuts (toast them in a pan and add maple syrup at the end)to the filling.  I didn't have bread flour but a mixture of regular and whole wheat was just fine!  Add some cream cheese frosting and it's the most magnificent rolls you've ever had!

After reading the other reviews, I made the following adjustments and found that it made them excellent.  I cooked them only for 16 minutes.  This meant that they didn't harden later, they stayed soft throughout the day.  I also iced them using the basic cream cheese frosting, which may have also helped keep them soft.  I let them rise for 2 hours and used a 9x13 pan, which was needed.  I can't imagine them fitting into an 8x8 pan.   I also doubled the cinnamon filling, but found it was way too much, and threw a lot out, so I would have stuck with the original portions for that.  All in all a quick and easy recipe.

It's pretty good except you have to make sure that you don't roll the dough too thin or else it won't be soft..it will come out rubbery and hard. And don't cut down on any of the cinnamon or else you won't taste it.PS refrigerating it does NOTHING!!..It's better to leave it for an hour to rise.

The texture was perfect. I couldn't have asked for a better one.  I didn't have any eggs on hand, so I used about 2 1/2 tbsp of oil as a substitution. I cooked them in a 10" spring-form pan. I washed the tops with a little oil since I had heard that they cook too much.   I didn't measure the filling. I just eyeballed it. Mistake. The brown sugar and cinnamon flavor was a bit faint.  I will save this recipe and try again. I imagine this is a great recipe if you put the right amount on filling in.

These are delish'!! I made them the "same day" way and did the filling by eye instead of by the recipe, but I bet I used quite a bit more brown sugar and cinnamon than the recipe calls for. This was also my first time ever making cinnamon rolls and they turned out perfect, very easy! Next time I may try half whole wheat....I'll let you know how it goes :)

These were FANTASTIC!!!!! I was drawn to this recipe as there was considerably less butter in this recipe compared to other ones on this site - so I figured I would give it a try! I actually used some dough that I had from a huge batch of challah that I made and used the dough for this recipe. Instead of butter, I used smart balance - reduced fat margarine and to my surprise it came out great! It was so sweet - it did not need a frosting! I baked mine at 350 for about 20-25 minutes -as I did not want it to brown on the top or for it to get too well done. I brushed the top with an egg wash to make it nice and shiny! They turned out great! The end result was a moist and delicious cinnamon roll! My family can't wait till I make this again!

Man!  These were amazing!  My first time cooking with yeast, & it was too easy.  I would definitely double the quantity next time though (just could've eaten more!)  and I would put the oven down just a little lower than 200 degrees...might just be my oven, but they browned a little quickly on top & I had to turn it down during cooking.  Overall, a winner; sweet, cinnamon-y, fragrant, I am cooking these again!

Very good recipe. Although, I went with recommendations and doubled the filling. I also made a cream cheese icing.I found that 15 minutes was plenty of time. I will make again, next time, adding chopped nuts.

I served these at a brunch I had yesterday here in Brazil, so they were a novelty for my Brazilian friends and family and they were a huge hit! This was my first attempt at cinnamon rolls, and they turned out perfectly. I took the suggestion to add 1/2 cup of canola oil and I think it made quite a difference. I also made some icing by quickly mixing together some cream cheese, butter, vanilla extract and powdered sugar (eyeballed the amounts). Can't wait to make them again!

I make a lot of bread (a LOT) but haven't been satisfied with my version of cinnamon rolls.  Well, this is my new 'go to' recipe for cinnamon rolls.  Call me unable to change but I just had to replace some of the water with some milk and threw in some melted butter but ...oh and doubled the filling but these were perfect.  The whole pan is gone and I doubled the recipe (hey, I have 8 kids, what can I say?).

This recipe did not turn out well at all for me - the dough was far too moist to begin with and they didn't rise at all.  The sugar / cinnamon melted with the butter in the oven, making the rolls spring apart and well.. I just ended up with a huge sticky (but reasonably tasty!) mess! 
Will try a different recipe next time, but make sure to roll the dough out very thin so that I can roll the dough up a good couple of times.
Also, 20 minutes was much too long for me - mine were slightly overcooked even at 15 minutes.

These were "ok" to me, but probably not the best. Just maybe "happy-medium". They were just a little too gooey and hard (and I even reduced the cooking time). They didn't turn out quite as good as other recipes I've tried - even though they were really "pretty" when they were done.  My son is a "cinnamon roll lover" and he wouldn't eat these. Based on that, I probably won't make again.

Very good cinnamon rolls. Made icing to drizzle over the top and the family loved them. Dough was not the best, as it was kind of bland and not as flaky as others, but we would make again since they were easy and could me made ahead of time.

The problem with these cinnamon rolls are they are very plain and average.  They are like a quick fix roll. They are not great in texture either. If you have made bread for as long as I have try another recipe because you will feel like you wasted your time.  I have made much better rolls and used more quality roll recipes.

I know enough about cinnamon rolls to know that the ones from this recipe sitting in the fridge will be great. (And the ones rising for me to cook now ^.^) I was going to make icing for them, but in the absence of confectioners sugar I played with some brown sugar, butter, milk, and cool whip. I'd put amounts on here, but it was pretty much a taste-test built recipe.

These were very tasty. I added a bit more brown sugar and cinnamon. They could have been a bit more gooey but overall pretty good rolls!

AWESOME recipe!! at first i thought that these might not work out, because of all the butter and sugar i had to lather onto the dough. but they turned out great! even my father loved them (he hates cinnamon)! i totally recommend this recipe to anybody, since they are easy as well. and i decided to follow the suggestions posted by others and set the oven to 350 degrees F.

I bake a lot of sweets and had an excellent recipe for cinammon rolls but misplaced it.  This one had wonderful reviews so I gave it a try.  I followed this to the letter and the dough did NOT rise and it tasted like an old shoe.  Will NOT be making again...

These were great.  My hubby & kids loved these.  I don't normally bake, especially anything that requires yeast, but I got the idea to make some rolls this morning and decided to go for it.

This recipe was easy and the only problem I had was I didn't let them rise long enough and they weren't very fluffy.  I'm sure I'll do better next time.  Also, next time I make them, I'm going to put some of the butter, cinnamon & sugar mixture in the bottom of the pan, so there's a bit of the mix for an icing.

My 14 year old made this last night as her first ever attempt at cinnamon rolls. She was unhappy with the result, but I loved it! They were chewy but not doughy, not heavy, lovely flavor. She wanted something lighter but for a first try these were perfect. We doubled the filling portion, and she thought the string cutting method was a pain. It was a little chilly in the house so I put the oven on low (200 degrees) and set them on top to rise. The glaze/icing didn't work out at all. Was thin as all get out. Still. This is a keeper, even for my perfectionist baker daughter.

From one Home Economics teacher to another, these cinnamon rolls were awesome!  I made them yesterday and let them sit in the fridge overnight.  I did make a few slight modifications to the recipe.  I kneaded the dough and placed it in a generously oiled bowl and set aside to rise.  I was worried at first when the dough did not seem to be rising.  I let the dough rise for a little more than an hour, and it did double in size.  I then punched it down and let it rest for 10 minutes.  When the resting period was done, I rolled out the dough, let it rest for about 10 minutes, then continued to roll out the dough.  I mixed brown and white sugar with the cinnamon for the filling.  I am not quite sure of the proportions because I just kind of eyeballed it!  The rolls were placed in the fridge and left overnight.   When my husband got up to go to work, I took them out of the fridge and left them on the counter to rise (about 2 hours because I went back to bed!).  The (12)rolls were double in size and filled a 9X13 baking dish.  When the kids woke up, I popped them in the oven @ 350 degrees and baked them for 17-19 minutes.  We made a cream cheese icing and they were delicious.  My oldest son said I am no longer allowed to buy cinnamon rolls from the store!  This is also a perfect recipe for a home economics class.  It allows students to prepare the dough one day and bake the next.  It is very hard to find recipes that can be prepared and eaten in 50 minutes.

These are really great.  The King Island Dancers came to our school and I wanted to bake something for them.  I made them the night before and took them out an hour in advance.  I was slightly worried because they didn't seem to be rising enough.  I waited about 65 min and put them in.  I turned the heat down to 350 as mine were starting to get a bit too dark.  They were soft, moist, nicely sweet, big and impressive looking.  These are great because they're not overly sweet but they're not dry either.  I added a bit of vanilla and cinnamon to the dough, but other than that left the recipe as it is.  Thank you so much.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

I've made these twice now and they are great!! I bake mine in a 9x13 in. pan so they don't come out looking "funky" or all stuck together. I only give 4 stars because they don't rise at room temperature. The first time I just thought my water wasn't warm enough when I added the yeast to it, but the second time I used almost boiling water and had the same issue, so I will put them in the sun on a warm day or in the (turned off) oven with a bowl of hot water underneath (like you do for bread). Other than that one flaw, this is a fantastic recipe!!

These tasted good, but something went wrong and it's got to be my fault. I'm not much of a baker so I'm hoping someone can reply and help me out.  First off, when I let the dough sit for the 10 minutes under a damp cloth, it didn't rise...was it supposed to?  Also, I didn't want to wait overnight, so I let it sit covered for 45 minutes...again, it didn't rise. Not sure why.  I think this is the root of my problem.  When they were cooked, the dough was dense, not light and airy like you imagine a cinnamon roll to be. I wouldn't necessarily call them heavy, but dense.  Any ideas why my dough didn't rise up? I would love to make them again.  I followed the recipe to a tee.

The best cinnamon rolls I've ever made. We have them on special occasions and they never get old. (Christmas morning, easter, mothers day, birthdays, fathers day, etc).  Be sure to bring the rolls to room temperature before baking to ensure an even batch. Drizzled with a simple powdered sugar icing makes them more divine! Good luck. =)

Very good recipe.  As suggested, I added a bit more cinnamon as I really love it.  This is not a over sweet dessert, just right for our taste.

i think it was because i was using a different, heavier flour, but these didn't rise as much as i had hoped. I also added extra fats in the form of milled flax seed which made it seem a bit "bran muffin-ish", all in all, an effective recipe, a little time consuming but i look forward to trying it again!

This was pretty good.  The recipe doesn't really say how big to roll this out to, I rolled it out to about 11x15.  I didn't read this recipe as carefully as I thought I had.  I started to spread 1/2 cup of butter over the dough, but thought that was too much, so I ended up probably using just over 1/4 cup (the amount called for in the recipe).  Plus I didn't see any way 16 rolls would fit into an 8x8 pan, so I used an 7x11 pan.  Even so, I don't see how 12 rolls can fit into an 8x8 pan.
I baked at 375 for about 22 mins.   I would probaly make it again.....but read the recipe a bit more carefully next time!

I also had a problem with the original recipe--came out a bit hard and dry. With these adjustments, it was moist and gooey and a real big hit at work. I left it overnight in my fridge where it rose pretty well, but also warmed up my oven a little to let the dough rise for another 40 minutes before baking it.  Add 1/4 cup of shortening to make the dough softer and moist. Also used 1.5 sticks of butter for the glaze. As I was rolling the dough into a log, I kept brushing the dry parts of the roll with the extra butter. Use a cream cheese frosting (1/4 cup of butter, 1/4 cup of cream cheese, 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, 2 cups of confectionery sugar) to really make it extra sweet.  Great easy recipe, will use it again.

Mine didn't rise much.  I doubled the brown sugar and mixed it, the butter and the cinnamon together and spread it on the rolled out dough before cutting and baking.  I only cooked the rolls for 15 minutes and I'm glad I did... because they were already pretty brown.  Pretty good recipe.

This is an excellent recipe and very easy. I am careful to read the recipes I choose to make and so far I have not made a bad one.Thee were so simple my grandson was able to measure and help me. Perfect. The only change I made was we made pull aparts out of the dough and rolled the doughballs in the cinnamon suger and put pats of butter within the rolls. We were both extremely happy with results and he was so proud as he presented them to the rest of family. Definatly a keeper. We used my bread machine for the dough. Easy Easy Easy!!!

These were pretty good cinnamon rolls, I liked that they didn't have to be glazed with sugary icing and they weren't all soft and gooey. They were the texture that actual cinnamon rolls should be. The reason it didn't have 5 stars, is because some fo the directions are a bit vague and the very first instruction - I found to be confusing. I have been using yeast for a while & never found it to be "creamy" - not sure the interpretation of "creamy" is supposed to mean but I ended up spending extra time trying to create a "creamy" yeast mixture. FYI - doesn't have to be creamy, it should be dissolved well.   Overall, the cinnamon rolls turned out delicious!

These were just not the rich gooey cinnamon rolls that I normally make.  My ex-husband got all my favorite recipe books (not like he cooks either) and I couldn't find my normal recipe and I made these for Christmas morning.  The kids and my fiance enjoyed them, but they're not especially picky (at least about sweets).  I think they could do with more rising time before you put it all together.  It was worth a try, but I'm still on the lookout for the perfect cinnamon roll recipe.

Best cinnamon roll recipe I've ever tried!  Didn't let it sit overnight and it was still delicious.  I prepared the dough in the bread machine, then after it was made into rolls, let it rise for 1 hour before baking.  I baked it at a lower temp though, as I though this would help it rise more since I hadn't the patience to let it sit overnight (my son wanted one ASAP).  It was super moist and delicious!  It was sweet enough to not need icing.  This recipe's a keeper for sure.

These are excellent.  However I found when I made them overnight by leaving them in the fridge to rise it was difficult to bake the inside  before overbaking the outside.  The inside was doughy while the outside was brown.  The second time I made them overnight I let the pan warm to room temperature before baking.  The results were better but the buns still had some doughy parts.  To make a long story short, I wouldn't make these overnight again.  I would just make them all at once with the 45 minute rise at room temperature.  This method has had the best results for me.

These are great! I am a rookie baker and the _second_ time I made them they worked.  The second time I used a 9" round glass (vs. 8" square metal) pan and let them rise for the 45 minutes (vs. over night in the fridge) and made 2x the 'filling'. Perfect!! :)  The other thing that I did was to melt the butter and mix the brown sugar - cinnamon in a small bowl until smooth and painted it on the rolled out dough.    I'm sure the experienced bakers will chuckle over this one, but the second time I used a thermometer for the yeast/water mix and it turned creamy just like the instructions said it would. The first time... well, not so much.  Thanks!

OMG. These were sinful. I did add my own tweaks based on some of the other user comments:  1. I measured out the 1/4 c sugar for the dough and from that I added 1 tsp to the warm water for the yeast. The sugar will help the yeast bloom. 2. I added 2 T Crisco to the bread dough. 3. I doubled the filling mix and added 1/2 c chopped pecans. 4. Used a 9x13 pan but will use a cookie sheet next time. 5. baked at 350 for 20 minutes.  I finished them off with a Brown sugar caramel: 1/4 c butter, 1 c brown sugar, 2 T skim milk, 1 tsp vanilla. Melt the butter and sugar in a heavy sauce pan. Stir constantly, and bring to a boil. Turn off heat and drizzle in milk and vanilla. Turn heat back on low and cook until sauce thickens. Turn off and let cool and the sauce will thicken more. Spoon over the hot rolls and let set for about 5 minutes....it's heaven!

These were wonderful.  I like to add a little more filling and top with icing.  The icing is just 1 cup confectioner sugar with 1 tablespoon milk a 1/2 teaspoon vanilla mixed together.

I just made these cinnamon rolls, they are very easy to make and  delicious! I did add the 1/4 cup of melted Crisco and tripled the filling, but did not let them rest over night in the refrigerator.  After rolling  and cutting   place them in the baking pan then wait  almost an hour before  baking them. They will turn out wonderfully!  These are so good that my family wants a second batch pronto!!

This is only my third dough that I've ever made and this was so ooey gooey that a lightly floured surface was not enough.  I think I probably added at least 1/2 cup of flour while kneading. I voted 5 stars because I didn't want my lack of experience to affect the rating of this recipe.

5 BIG stars!  This recipe is PERFECT for small households which is a HUGE plus for me.....OR if you don't want a big pan of rolls to tempt you.  The dough was ultra easy to mix/knead with my Kitchen-Aid mixer and as for the filling?  I did NOT follow the recipe.  I can tell you I used MORE butter then called for and eyed the cinnamon and used brown sugar and chopped pecans.  I was craving cinnamon rolls and these fit the bill.  I WILL be sharing this recipe with friends and family. THANK YOU for posting this simple, yummy recipe.  OH BY THE WAY.....after the dough was kneaded I let it sit for half an hour and made these right away/same day.....so the overnight thing is optional since mine turned out great.

These are absolutely excellent!  I made them for my 11-year-old brother and he had 4 (as did I)!  We like ours a little gooey-er, so I added more butter, sugar, and cinnamon, but the dough itself was amazing.  Since I used so much butter, I poured out what was left in the bottom of the pan and added milk, vanilla, and powdered sugar - it made a great icing!  I will definitely use this again.

These rolls were wonderful!   I will definitely be making these again.  I added a 1/4 cup of shortening and doubled the cinnamon topping.  Also I only cooked them for about 10 mins.  I did set my rolls out in the morning for about 45 mins in a warming drawer on my stove.  I used two round pans for the rolls.

This was my first time making cinnamon rolls, and this recipe was very easy. I didn't have any issues. I did take the advice of other reviewers and double the filling. I'm glad I did because even doubling it, the rolls were still a little dry. Not as gooey as I hoped for, but good tasting. I will definitly try these again and hopefully practice will make perfect! These rolls were good but not perfect, even with some adjustments.

I used all whole wheat flour and subbed honey for the sugar. They were SO good! I didn't use but half the butter it called for inside, I used the rest of the butter for the cream cheese icing. They would have been moist without the icing, will definitely make these again!

These turned out being some of the best cinnamon rolls I have ever eaten.  Mine needed about 25-30 minutes to cook because the center was still a little doughy.  I think cooking these in 2 pans would be better to allow the rolls to spread out more and look more professional, but either way, they taste great!

I didn't have time to make dough, so I cheated and used the Rhodes frozen dough.  This worked great!  I also added a creamy sugar topping.  Just add milk and powered sugar together and make a paste.  Spread it on so that it melts into the bread.  Easy and simple!!

I followed the recipe almost exactly except I used more of the brown sugar cinnamon mixture. the dough was not the best.I also agree that 400 was a high temp to bake at they browned too quickly

Took me awhile to get the perfect batch but I loved them! Wow. Who knew the power a few cinnamon Rolls had? Now I'm off to make bread! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

These were nice, but 400 was too hot and they ended up a bit crispier than I would like...next time I'll lower the temperature. Taste is lovely but I added some raisins as well.

OOey and gooey goodness. I halved the white sugar, doubled the cinnamon, and added 1 tsp nutmeg. These smell great in the kitchen while baking.

Yum yum yum yum and YUM. Didn't have any bread flour so just used AP. Maybe that's why I had to increase flour to almost 4 cups. Used soy milk in place of water. Used only 1/2 the butter. Next time I will increase the cinnamon/sugar mix. Can't wait to make again.

There were really good. I started to make them for breakfast but then had to leave before I could allow them to rise so I put them in the fridge to make the following morning. They tasted good but I wished there was more filling and the tops of the insides seemed to get a little hard, not sure if that is because they were in the fridge too long or what. We did enjoy them though and I will be trying them again.

I thought that was wonderful, I did add frosting ( the standard butter, powdered sugar, vanilla...), other than that, these have been made over and over and over again in my home, and the minute they come out of the oven, they're gone! Whoever put this recipe up, WAY TO GO!!! Thank you soooo much!

These were alright. You def have to add more of the gooey stuff, and the dough was not as sweet as I would have liked, but it was edible.

Pretty good recipe. They tasted very nice when warm and very visually appealing. If i made them again I would cut the slices a bit thicker, maybe an inch and a half tall, and make it more like a square instead of a rectangle.

Pretty good. I followed the recipe except for the butter/sugar/cinnamon part - I just eyeballed that, but in hindsight I should have probably gone with the actual quantities, because my cinnamon rolls were not as sweet as I'd have liked. I liked how this recipe is really easy, and the making rolls from the dough is so simple. I did the 45 minute rising verison instead of overnight in the fridge. I'd make this again but follow the quantities for cinnamon and sugar and also perhaps do a frosting.

I tripled this recipe and made bread out of two thirds of it. The bread was excellent and the cinnamon rolls were fantastic. My 25 year daughter happened to stop by just about the time everything was done. The next time I fix this I think I'll have to go times six.

I just took these out of the oven and ate one immediately--sooo good.  So I had a 2nd roll:)  After reading many reviews I added 1/3 cup of canola oil and 1/2 tsp of almond extract to the dough.  Then I made a cream cheese frosting using 1/3 cup of R.F. crm chs, 1 TB of butter, 1 tsp of van and then mixed in powd. sugar until it was the right consistency. Oh yes and I also doubled the filling.

I have made 3 batches of these in the last month. My husband can not get enough. Would still like more in the middle I keep adding more butter and brown sugar and cinnamon. Am still looking for a little sweeter and fluffer bread dough but this one is delicous.

First time the dough seemed a little bland.  This time I added 1 cup whole wheat flour (plus 1T gluten) for first cup, then white for 2nd cup (skip the additional 1/2 cup).  I then kneaded and gradually added whole wheat flour to right consistency.  I also used turbinado sugar instead of brown, and it helped prevent clumping.  My family loved this version, and it was much more healthy!

Just made this for Christmas morning. The recipe was very easy. I doubled the filling and added some raisins to the mixture. Once it was done in the oven, I flipped it out on a cookie sheet so that all the melted sugar would top the rolls. The rolls aren't as soft and flaky as I would like. I think the dough does need some more salt and maybe something to keep them softer at room temperature. :) I think I would make this again but tweek it a little.

Great recipe.  I cooked my first batch for 20min and they came out a little hard.  This is what you can do to correct this.  Spray the tops with water when they first come out of the oven.  Let cool slightly and place in a freezer bag or air tight container.  This will help add a little extra moisture to them.  You can also bake them for a little less time.

Wow! Not only were the rolls delicious, they were so much fun and easy to make. I used a technique mentioned by another reviewer- a piece of string to cut the dough into rolls (by placing string under dough, crossing the ends at the top and pulling tight). The dough rose beautifully in a 75 degree celcius oven for 45min. I only needed to bake them for 12-14 minutes instead of the 20 minutes recommended. The smell through the house was heavenly and we couldn't wait for them to cool before scarfing down two each. They don't even need frosting. Simple, fun, delicious.

I have made these quite a few times now and these are great! The last time I made these I used a large sheet pan instead of the 8x8 pan. The rolls were easier to remove from the pan.

Love this recipe! I have made it about 5 times already and my kids are always asking for more! I make a batch and freeze the rolls (before baking them). That way, I can just pull out a few of them at a time, let them thaw and then rise in a warm place for about 30 to 45 minutes before baking them. Turn out as good as the freshly make ones. Thanks for sharing.

These were, per my kids, "delectable". I actually, as others suggested, doubled the amount of 'filling' (and spread some on the bottom of the pan).   I made 16 of these and put them all in an 8x8 pan.  I let them rise for about  1.5 hours (though the 45 minutes would have been sufficient).  I baked it at 350 per others' suggestions.  The only other unusual thing I did was that my brown sugar was hard as a rock.  Not knowing any other special trick, I threw a few tablespoons of water on it and microwaved it for 30 seconds.  Unfortunately, my brown sugar somehow turned into a liquid in that amount of time.  I used it anyway, spreading the liquidy brown sugar and cinnamon on top of the butter.  The rolls came out VERY moist, and I wonder if part of this was due to my added water to the brown sugar.  I baked them for 25 minutes and it was perfect.

I made these Christmas Eve for breakfast Christmas morning as I was specifically looking for a make-ahead cinnamom roll.  They did not rise overnight, but I put them on the countertop for about 45 minutes; between that and the baking they rose nicely.  Based on prior reviews, I changed the oven temp to 350 (which worked nicely) and doubled the butter and sugar/cinnamon (too much for my taste).  Next time, I will use 1.5 times the original recipe amounts of these and add pecans.  But still, they were very yummy and exactly what I was looking for.

I enjoyed this recipe, and everyone raved about it, but I personally wanted a little more gooeyness.  Next time I will follow suggestions and put a layer of brown sugar and some butter on the bottom of the pan before I put in the rolls.  The carmelization on the bottom is the best part and this recipe makes very little of that and is dryer than I would like.

Excellent! I made them all at once as well. It was definitely a very soft and delicious dough! I added a 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts to the filling, we've a young nut lover here. ;-)

These were more like caramel rolls instead of a cinnamon roll.  They were excellent.  I took other peoples advise and doubled the sauce you put at the bottom of the pan.  It did take approx 2 hours for my rolls to raise.  They were well worth the wait.  Thanks for the recipe:)

I made this for my fiancee who is a cinnamon roll addict.  He absolutely loved it.  The only changes I made was added a tad more butter and cut the rolls a bit thicker and placed in a bigger pan.  Delicious.

This is a excellent recipe.  It's simple and doesn't require a lot of ingredients.  The only thing I did was reduce the butter a little bit and add a powder sugar icing.  The recipe is also low fat.  Jaime

I really like this recipe.  I enjoy making bread of all kinds, and especially bread that rises in the fridge overnight!  I made this on a recent cold day for breakfast, and my husband raved about it all day long.  Definitely one I'll make often.

I have been making my own bread for years and this is the easiest and best Cinnamon Buns I have found. The only thing I have done differently  is I cut the dough into 12 portions and place them [6]in 2 small cast iron frypans. I then drizzle a mixture of icing sugar and milk over them when I take them out of the oven. We own a Bed and Breakfast and these have become a speciality of the house.Our guests usually leave with recipe in hand. THANKS!!!

I loved them. Because they can rise overnight in the fridge, I serve them hot out of the oven the next day without having to get up early and make them. My friends want me to make lots more. I knew I could trust a home economics treacher's recipe!

I have made this recipe twice now.  I found dough was too firm for the ingredient proportions listed.  Also would not recommend letting them raise at room temp for 45 minutes.  They did not rise very much for me.  
Once I baked the recipe a second time allowing the dough to rise over night, I felt they were improved.

As a last minute idea, these turned out very well.  Thet were easy to make and  tasted great.   Since I did not ice them, I might make the dough just a little bit sweeter next time.

These are very good. I added a little to this recipe. I took one apple and diced it up. I sautéed it in 1/4 cup of butter, 1 tsp of cinnamon and 2 tsp of sugar. I added this on top of the cinnamon/sugar and then. rolled them up. I frosted them with cinnamon icing.

I made this as directed in the Dec/Jan 2019 issue of Allrecipes Magazine, which turned the recipe into a supersized cinnamon roll. (Using the same recipe but slightly different method.)
I made no changes. This was delicious and my kids and I had a lot of fun making it together.

They were okay.  Not very good the second day though.  Personally, it felt like I was eating a dinner roll with cinnamon sugar on it.  I definitely prefer a lighter, flakier cinnamon roll.  This was just too dense.

so tasty! I mixed the sugar and cinnamon before sprinkling to ensure even coverage with both. I also melted the butter and brushed it on. Easier than spreading. Turned out perfect. The bottom caramelized a little and that was awesome!

I am new to baking with breads so I chose this recipe because it seemed very simple; which it was. However my rolls did not rise very much at all. I am not sure if it was the yeast or if the water I added to the yeast in the beginning was either too hot or too cold. I am going to have to continue to work on that. Otherwise the recipe was straight forward and easy to follow. For icing I just mixed half of a stick of butter with two cups powdered sugar and two tablespoons milk. And presto my rolls were ready! Thanks for the recipe!

I just finished making these tonight and I must say they are really good.  I didn't want to wait til the morning so I let them rise for the 45 min.  At first I didn't think they rose much, but once I put them in the oven, they rose beautifully.  My husband has ate about half of the pan.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this with dough that I had frozen and thawed and I feel that it tuned out very well. My rolls did not rise while they were on the counter but on the other hand they did rise in the oven. Either way they were delicious and I will be making them again.

I'm not one to follow a recipe but since I've learned that's a bad habit when dealing with bread recipes I tried these cinnamon buns and stuck to the notes. The result: picture perfect cinnamon buns.   What I did change is lessened the butter and the br.sugar in the spread but that's my personal preference. I also upped the cinnamon content, threw in 1/2 t of nutmeg and added raisins that I soaked in vanilla. Mmmm so fluffy and the spreading got chewy as it baked...now to find a nice glaze to go with!?

PERFECT!  DELISH!  AWESOME!  The kids gobbled these up, and I will no longer be buying the pre-packaged ones again!!!  I read a lot of the reviews to see if I should make any changes.  The ONLY thing I did was use all-purpose flour since that's what I had on hand and I doubled the filling.  No need for icing!!!

They were very good. Soft, with great cinnamon flavor. This was perfect for my husband and myself. If I were making them for company, I'd double the recipe. Thanks for sharing it! Husband loved them!

These rolls were really good! I used the cream cheese frosting from another recipe to sweeten them up when they got out of the oven. It was a quick and easy recipe. My first time making cinnamon rolls, and I thought it went really well.

I thought these were simple and very tasty! I made the dough in my bread machine and I formed the dough into a tea ring. Baked at 350 and added some icing. Very yummy and made the house smell soooo good!

Simple means perfect.  I made these recently using a simple milk, vanilla, and powdered sugar glaze.  I recommend a glaze similar to a glaze doughnut, adding it with a cooking brush.  4 year olds make the perfect helper when adding glaze.These are too good to pass up.

Great recipe :) Very delicious. I took Melissa's advice and doubled ingredients and used her topping advice. They are sooo nice I cannot stop munching on them. I didnt leave them overnight, just let them sit in room temp for 45 mins. Wonderful .... Yum !!!!

These are awesome!  I have never made homemade cinnamon rolls so I was sceptical on how they would turn out.  I got up about 20 minutes early and they were ready for the kids before school.  My husband and kids really loved them.   I didn't have bread flour, but they turned out great without it, so will try bread flour next time and hope they are even better.  I also put icing on ours.  I used the vanilla glaze recipe on this site and it was awesome too.

This was a super east recipe to follow and great to make with the kids.  We started after breakfast and the rolls were ready for a late morning treat.  We followed the recipe as written and let them rise for an hour.  They came out perfect!  Not heavy or too sugary - just right with a glass of milk before the bus :)

This was a super easy and super yummy recipe. I doubled it and did add more for the filling just because we like ours with a lot of cinnamon and sugar. My husband took some to work and now I keep getting requests from his co-workers to make more! I love the fact that you make it the night before since I don't personally want to get up at 4 am just to make homemade cinnamon rolls and wait for them to rise, etc.

This is the first cinnamon roll recipe that I've ever tried and the family and I like it so much that I will surely stick with it. I've already baked it twice in one week!   The texture of the bread is very pleasing. It's soft and chewy enough without being overly so.   I made a few adjustments to the recipe because we don't eat eggs.  I used "Egg Replacer" to replace the eggs, I added about a tablespoon of maple syrup to the dough for a slight hint of sweetness, 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and a tablespoon of french vanilla non-dairy creamer for a gentle whisper of vanilla in the dough.   I also added about a cup of nutritional yeast flakes and 1 tablespoon of vital wheat gluten and placed that in the dough. To the center sugar mixture  I added about a half cup of ground flax seeds and mixed that in with the sugar that was sprinkled in the center to try to boost the nutrition a little.   I used Smart balance in place of the butter which worked fine and I also rubbed some smart balance along with a little sugar on the top of the loaf which gave it a nice light brown lightly crispy top.  This cinnamon roll came out really yummy. I have a new favorite recipe!

Haven't made cinnamon rolls in 30 yrs, thought I'd try this recipe - I also added 1/4 cup butter flavor crisco - they were delicious.  Wish now I'd have doubled the recipe, but as easy as they were - I'll make them again very soon.

I've been searching for the perfect cinnamon bun recipe, not too heavy, not too sweet, not too syrupy...  These were tasty but in my humble opinion, too much yeast.  If I try this again I will double the recipe with the same amount of yeast.  They came out like rolled white bread.

These rolls were wonderful. I used only two teaspoons of cinnamon rather than the full tablespoon as directed. I used my bread machine on the pizza dough setting to knead and rise the dough, then placed the cut rolls into a greased 9x13 pan in the fridge overnight. They were done in 15 minutes! For the frosting I used melted butter, a little light karo syrup, powdered sugar, a tad of vanilla and a little real maple syrup. Yum!! Much better than cinnamon rolls from a can and just about as easy. Thanks for the recipe.

This was fabulous recipe in addition to using the yeast I also added baking soda which help them rise.  I also used an apple glaze that was precooked and cooled before applying(delicious). I also used some jam out of the refrigerator and that worked well also. Anyhow overall this recipe was successful!  Thanks

Delicious.  Not gooey like a Cinnabon and exactly what I was looking for.  I put the Cinnabon cream cheese frosting on top.  Made it Friday night for the perfect Saturday morning breakfast.

Mmmmmmmmmmmmm. Perfect cinnamon rolls that my family inhaled. I started the night before, and once they were rolled and cut, I put them in a baking pan (I needed a 9x13, and it was crowded) and covered in the fridge. In the morning, I let them rise for about 45 min, then baked. I made buttercream frosting, and they were to die for.

I had to substitute dairy and soy free butter, but other than that I made no changes. They were delicious! The only negative thing to say is that they became stale quickly, but they still tasted great!

Easy, yummy and fast! Not only will this recipe give me a quick-fix those mornings I want dessert for breakfast but also has an overnight option for those rare times I'm organized enough to plan for the next day's baking. I didn't have issues with it being too dry after being out of the oven a couple of hours - my roommate even commented that it was possibly better cold than fresh out of the oven. I'm making this recipe tonight for breakfast tomorrow! Thanks, Sharon!

This recipe is worth a try! I have made these cinnamon rolls every weekend for the past month. They are fairly simple to make and come out very nicely. They have enough stuffing to be sweet and the dough comes out short and chewy, just the way I like them. I disagree with the reviewers who say they aren't gooey enough. They're about middle of the road--potent and a little wet, but not soupy.  I haven't changed anything, except one time I increased the butter to a half cup. This didn't really improve the recipe, so I abandoned that innovation. Also, I have just been letting the buns rise for 40 mins, then cooking them, rather than refrigerating them the night before. (I'm impatient!) Once they are cool, I slather them with vanilla icing.

My whole family absolutely loved these, my mom said they were the best she'd ever eaten.  I didn't read the recipe right so I let the dough rise an hour *before* rolling it; after cutting the rolls I let them rise a little longer before baking.  I added about half a cup of crushed walnuts, and half a cup of soaked raisins, and they were yummy!

This was an ok recipe, I will make it again. However, I doubled the butter/sugar mixture to put inside. I wish they would have risen a bit more, and I had to find another recipe for a glaze. Good thing I had one in my recipe box already for an angel food cake!

I reduced the temperature to 175C and added raisins and walnuts. They turned out good and soft but a bit dry. I was going to ice them but found my cream cheese was used for other reasons, I think an icing would of helped. I would make them again but looking for a better recipe.

I have searched for years to find a recipie that would compare to our Granny,s cinnamon rolls this one is hands down the best ever....I'm so tickled I found it.  I didn't use all the brown sugar filling but they are so wonderful.

I thought this recipe was GREAT!  Much easier than the one in my cook book.  I doubled the filling after reading the reviews, and thought it turned out great.  I made cream cheese frosting to go on top, and they turned out wonderful.

This is now my favorite recipes. I did add a little cinnamon and brown sugar into the dough mixture - not too much - maybe a quarter cup of each. I almost double the cinnamon/brown sugar filling. And I am a cheater, and I use Country Crock or some sort of easily spreadable butter,  I actually use my hands and just smear in generously over the rolled out dough... I have never actually measured it - just used what I needed! Turns out fantastic! By far - my most favorite thing to make! The only problem -I cant stop eating them!

They smelled wonderful and tasted good, however my dough never raised. I am wondering if it is because I used bread machine yeast and put it in the warm water like the recipe calls for. I will probably try again without soaking the yeast next time. They were still edible, and reminded me of pecan spins.

I tried making these and even though the taste was great, the dough never raised, so I ended up putting them in the oven when they were still flat... :o(  so they obviously were hard as rock... it's the first time I'm making this kind of dough from scratch...  I'm wondering if it has to do with the fact that I'm in Brazil... maybe I should use more yeast.

I liked the fact that for half an hour or so work in the evening you can have cinnamon rolls for breakfast. I kept the filling measurements as written and found it just right for us. I did reduce the baking temp to 350 as suggested by other reviewers and they came out beautifully soft. I'll be making these again tonight. Many Thanks

This was a great recipe...but I did add a powdered sugar, milk, vanilla extract drizzle to the top.  I also did this under a time pressure...so I put them in warm oven to raise.  I will make these again and put them in the fridge the night before.  This will be a crowd favorite in my house for some time to come!

Great recipe. It takes some effort, but they're very good. I added finely chopped pecans when spreading the dough with the butter, cinnamon, and sugar. They did get a little overdone. I think next time I'll bake them at 350 instead of 400. Thanks for the keeper!

The temperature was waaaay too high. I only cooked the buns for 15 at 380 degrees and they were already slightly burnt. They were pretty good warm but once they cooled they were hard as a rock.

Cinnayum! I really like this recipe, though the rolls came out a little bread-like with crisp edges. Not bad, but not all soft and sticky-greasy like some. I doubled the filling and can't imagine putting in any less. I should have let them rise a bit longer and maybe added some butter to the dough but overall a very nice recipe with not too many ingredients. Although I'm an experienced cook, I've never made cinnamon rolls before so I think they were pretty good taste-wise. However, I used a knife to cut them..not smart because they smushed and I had to reshape them but then the filling spilled out so it got messy. Once I topped the rolls with Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site all was good. The frosting covered up the weird shape and uneven filling! Overall, this is a good recipe..give it a try!

I've tried several different cinnamon roll recipes and this was by far the best.  I added just a tad more sugar (1/3 cup instead of 1/4) and I used natural turbinado sugar instead of white sugar to cut down on our use of refined sugar.  I found that I had a little brown sugar cinnamon mix left over that I sprinkled on the top of the cinnamon buns which gave them a more crunchy, sweet top.  I am already making my second batch and will stop looking for another recipe, as this one is really the best I've found.

Start of a tradition! I made these Christmas Eve after the kids went to bed. Then Christmas morning I promptly put them in the oven as soon as everyone woke. First time using yeast and it  went well. I had always been afraid to try it. 
Next time I will add additional cinnamon, brown sugar and butter as other reviewers suggested but I always like follow directions exactly the first time I make a recipe and then tweak it to my family's taste in subsequent preparations.

Made these for Thanksgiving morning.  Came out great.  I googled Cinnabon cream cheese icing and found a recipe for the icing.  I found no need to double the filling recipe.

I've made these three times, now, and they're awesome. My notes:

 * Mine were done at 15 minutes, so keep an eye on yours the last 5 minutes of cooking. 
 * For icing, I did 1/4 cup of cream cheese frosting (from the can), microwaved for 30 seconds, then poured over the buns.

The dough isn't sweet, but if it were, it would be overkill. I add a lot of brown sugar and cinnamon to mine, so they're extra gooey.

Very good and very easy.  I usually can't get anything to rise but this worked great.  I also didn't have brown sugar but used white sugar mixed with cinnamon and turned out just fine.  Not as gooey but I can deal with that.  Still tasted great.  Thanks

Our oven cooks a bit hot.  They came out dry and hard the first time.  Once I lowered the time/temp, it was quite yummy.  My family especially loves them with an egg white/powdered sugar icing!

I changed this recipe quite a bit, but was happy with the results. I didn't use any egg, used raw sugar, and used about a 3:1 mixture of brown sugar/raw sugar for the filling, mixed with margarine. I also used whole wheat flour. The rolls didn't rise very well, I would probably add the sugar into the yeast/water mixture for the first ten minutes next time and add 1/2 a mashed banana to the dough.

Really fantastic! Myself and my friend have made this twice and both times we left the mixture as a loaf rather than cutting it up so we had cinnamon loaf!

Really delicious, always makes you want more!

Not the best cinnamon roll I've ever had but it's up there on the top of the list.

I tried this recipe and the rolls were nice. My only problem is that they did not rise as much as I felt they should have. However, I added raisins and they were really tasty.

This recipe has become one of my staples, I make it regularly.  I did find  that it is important, if you are impatient like me and not willing to chill them overnight, make sure the butter is not too runny, otherwise the filling will run down to the bottom of the pan when you bake them.  Also, I usually add more cinnamon than called for (blanket the dough surface).  Also, my oven tends to be a bit hot, so I find the optimal baking temp and time to be 350F for exactly 16 minutes.

These baked up beautifully, even in the weird heart-shaped pan I had to squash them in!

the cinnamon sugar part was great. Slightly doughy but not too bad. Kids loved them.

mmmm! I just made these tonight, and oh my... one bite, I thought I had died and gone to cinnamon heaven. We'd a young cinnamon lover riight here =D Okay, I did make some pretty DRASTIC changes to the recipe... didn't have bread flour, so just used 1 and 1/2 cups all purpose and 1 cup of cake and pastry flour since I was afraid the rolls would turn out hard b/c there was no fat in the dough... but that's exactly why I chose this recipe, it's lower fat. Roll was nice and soft.. I must have only used 2 tbsp of margarine or less for brushing the inside, seemed enough to me, plus it still tasted great. I don't get how they wouldn't brown in the oven, even though I had brushed a bit more margarine on the tops before baking. Plus, I only got 8 small rolls out of this recipe, even though it says 16 servings?? Could have been my own fault, I'm pretty sure I killed some of the yeast by adding cold milk to take some of the water's place. And I only used half of the filling, doubled the cinnamon, and it was great. Made a little glaze to go with it: 1/2 cup confectioners' sugar, 2 tsp milk, 1 tbsp cream cheese, 1/4 tsp vanilla. Drizzle probably sweet enough and ended up making up a bit for the reduced sugar. Conclusion: feel free to tweak this recipe, I didn't follow the instructions at all and it was wonderful. Will definitely make again!

pretty good.  i didn't expect them to actually rise in the fridge, but they did and then they got even bigger in the oven!  i poured a lot of extra cinnamon/sugar/butter mixture over the buns before baking.  after they were done, i drizzled a very basic icing on the top (1-3 tablespoons of milk with a cup of powdered sugar). the  only problem is that after a couple of days they got a little stale.

These came out great! I used egg whites in the place of the egg, and the dough came perfectly. I mixed it by and in a bowl, which I believe yields better results. With the filling, I omitted the butter and used cooking spray (strange but works) and I used less sugar. Also, I added cloves and nutmeg. When rising, I put the rolls into a warm oven first, then into the preheated one.

Good and basic recipe.  Made 9 rolls (2 barely rolls) in an 8x8.  Not gooey enough.  Didn't have to lick my fingers.  More butter?  Flavor was ok but I wanted sweeter.  Over all good, just not Grandma's.

This recipie has become a christmas must with my family.  They absolutely love them.  Once you get the hang of working with yeast it becomes easy and fun. (Especially when kids help!)

I agree, for an electric oven 400 degrees is too hot but a successful recipe regardless. What American kid doesn't love sugar when combined with bread, cinnamon and butter!  The kids loved my first efforts and Jon and I are certainly kids at heart! This recipe is sure to be a weekend breakfast favorite because of the make ahead suggestion. Thanks for the submission.

We loved these rolls. Very easy to make, our 4 year old helped and had a great time.  We added raisins and made a orange glaze to go over them. Thank you for you recipe Sharon.

The dough was really heavy, and the 400 degree oven was too hot and burned the top of most.

This was my first try at making cinnamon rolls. Very easy, very tasty. The family loved them and can't wait for me to make more. I made a thin icing with conf. sugar, vanilla and milk to put on top after they cooled a bit and all that did was make them even better. Highly recommend!
