This recipe was awesome! Both my husband and I really enjoyed it. I did end up adding another teaspoon of the vinegar and seasoning with salt at the end. YUM!!!!

Very good. I added some fresh mushrooms and seasoned the dish with fresh thyme.  I didn't use strict measurements so probably ended up using a little more vinegar than the recipe stated.

This recipe calls for 1/4 cup olive oil, divided; it never tells what to do with the other 2 tablespoons. It was good, though!!

This was good! I left out the cayenne (for my mom) but changed nothing else (though I did just eyeball amounts). I will be making it again!

I thought this recipe was okay, but nothing special. I found the vinegar taste a little out of place and though I ususally love the kick of cayenne, it didn't work for me in this dish. I prefer to saute the onions, garlic, and zucchini in butter, then simply season with salt.

With such good reviews, I was surprised at how much I disliked this. The vinegar gave the zucchini a sharpness that was most unpleasant.

the vinegar gives this a funny taste.  Would have been better had it been left out.

I have used apple cider vinegar in other vegetable recipes but for this one, it just did not taste good. Thanks anyway.

My neighbor brought me over 3 small zucchini so I searched the data banks and came up with this one.  Easy and flavorfull.  I thought it was great.

Very simple and tasty - might leave out the cayanne pepper next time - not a big fan of spicy.

MemaRie's Zippy Zucchini Haiku: "Why yes, it's zippy! Zippy taste, zippy to make. Far from tasting 'zzzzzz.'" Followed the recipe exactly as written, served w/ grilled steelhead trout and basmati rice - I like the cider vinegar and cayenne pepper additions. A fun, and zippedeedodaa way to change up my normal steamed w/ butter 'zukes.

This was good.  I used just a very light sprinkling of cayenne but I liked it.
