I did not have many of the ingredients, but this got me going with the ham.  While I loved the way mine turned out (5 stars), the kids did not.  My version:  Ham, fresh zuchini, fresh celery, a little swiss cut up and parmesan.  I did not have onion or anise. But this seems to be a very versital recipe once you have the basics.  So for me Great!

This was excellent.  It can be adapted to use other vegetables such as grated carrot or spinach. The cakes can be frozen and taken to work for a quick lunch, heating them up in a microwave.

Wow, way too much anise seed!  The flavor of anise overwhelmed everything else, which is unfortunate when these are supposed to be HAM cakes.  On the plus side, they cook up nice and crispy, and are not difficult to make.  I would suggest chopping the broccoli fairly fine so the cakes hold together better.  The recipe has possibilities, but the anise seed has to be removed from front and center.

I'm giving this a four for the idea and the flavor, although I did leave out the anise and the onion. I ground up my ham with all of the ingredients except the broccoli, then mixed that in by hand. The problem was, they fell apart really easily. Definitely use a non-stick skillet, because I didn't at first and had to switch since they were in pieces by the time I got them flipped over. I think it's a really good idea - they just need to be a little more cohesive. I may try them in the oven some time.

Yummy!  My grandma gave us a 1/2 ham and our little family didn't know what to do with it all, you can only eat so many ham sandwiches, you know?  These are really good-even our 5-year-old said they were "awesome" like 3 times :-)  I used shredded Parmesan, only 1/2 an onion, cooking spray, and omitted the  anise-delicious!

Quite tasty. Minor changes.. using a mix of red pepper and onion instead of all onion as I had some leftover and cooked with non stick spray instead of oil. I served with a honey mustard sauce.. yum

I tried to be true to the recipe, except for using turkey ham and leaving out the anise, and this mix did not work for me. Why a 4 rating? Because it was delicious and I think it was my fault. I had pulsed the broccoli and onion in the food processor (but not too fine), and I think I should have spent some time squeezing/draining them before adding to the ham. The mix was so wet I decided to fry a trial patty and ended up with ham hash. To salvage the mix I dumped in a bunch of bread crumbs and wheat bran. It was still pretty loose, but I found if I made the patties very thin and cooked over low heat so they could firm up enough to be flipped without burning I ended up with a really nice texture. I suggest not adding salt at all until you've tasted it, ham is usually very salty already, as is the cheese. When I make these again (and I will) I'll make sure to drain the veggies as a separate step. Served with a mayo/honey/mustard sauce I just winged, plain green beans and Kettle chips.

these were awesome! we had a lot of easter ham left over and i was looking for an interesting way to use some of it up. i would chop the broccoli up a bit smaller, though - the large size made it hard to keep the patties in tact. but my family loved them equally simply as a big mess on their plates.

This was EASY, FAST and delicious. I had to use parmesan cheese because that's all I had. Mixing and forming with your hands is essential. They are even better left over and re-heated!

Excellent recipe. I eliminated the anise completely. Use all three eggs- you need them. Equally good with gruyere or swiss cheese. Let them cook for the 3-4 minutes on one side before flipping them. I also like to soften the chopped onions in a pan before adding them to the mix. If you form the patties quite small they also make nice appetizers!

These actually turned out better than I thought they would.  I used a 10 oz. package of frozed spinach and thought it was a bit too much.  I think with broccoli it would be awesome.

We did enjoy this recipe but I will keep playing with it.  Use half as much pepper as 2 t. is too overpowering.  Any more and they'd be inedible.  Also, the patties are quite loose.  Next time I'm going to try using paper towels to wring out the broccoli so it's really dry.  I did press it in a colander but that wasn't enough.  Also, I think dusting the patties in cornmeal just before placing them in the pan might be a good tweak to give the exterior a nice crunch.  My substitutions: fresh chives for onion; no anise seed; oregano for basil; 1 t. granulated garlic for cloves; and cheddar/jack for asiago cheese. Also I added three chopped artichoke hearts, a couple of dashes of red pepper flakes and 1/2 c. bacon crumbles. PS - these are quite filling!

Followed the recipe, except omitted the anise as all reviewers seemed to suggest. Kind of blah. After his first bite my husband went to the refrigerator and brought out 5 different condiments to try on them, mustards, salsas, etc. Couldn't eat them plain.

I'm leaving a neutral rating for the following reason: the ham I used was kind of tough and stringy, and I did not have a way to grind it, so I finely chopped it.  That may have contributed to these not turning out well, so I'll give it a better rating than they actually earned.  They did not hold together well to fry and came out very dry; also the flavor was predominantly onion.  Would not make again.
