I really wanted to love this because I am a fan of anything caprese, but, unfortunately this wasn't a winner for us.   I thought the cheese was heavy for the delicate fish and I wasn't a fan of the cooked basil.  The basil became a little bitter.  The fresh sprinkled on top was much better.   I also did one layer instead of two because it would have been way too much for the thickness of my fish.

I made this recipe exactly as described and it turned out great.  My husband, who is not much of a fish eater, consumed his piece with minimal grumbling.
