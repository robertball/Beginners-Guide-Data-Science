I used a frozen pre-made crust, so I spent a total of about 5 minutes. I thought it was really good, easy to make, and you could definitely play around with the fruit, as cream cheese goes well with so much. But cherry does taste delicious :)

AMAZING! Last time I made this pie, I couldn't  wait to eat it and didn't let it completely cool; the filling went everywhere!  Make sure you go through the whole cooling process to avoid this.

I cheated and used a premade crust I had in the freezer.  This was a huge hit and surprised me that everyone loved it.  I will be adding this to the favorites for quick and easy.  Thanks for a quick, cheap, simple, and yummy recipe!

The filling for this pie was absolutely heavenly! I used strawberry filling instead of cherry because its what my hubby prefers. I would have given it a 5 star rating except I wasnt too thrilled about the crust. I think next time I will stick with a graham cracker crust. Definately simple though, and delicious!

This was GREAT!  My teenage daughter (who dislikes cherries) almost ate the whole thing! What makes this recipe is the short-bread/cookie crust. If you use a regular crust you will end up with a nice pie, but it won't be anything special. I have also made this with blueberries and it was every bit as wonderful. Also as others have noted be sure to let it cool completely before cutting into it otherwise you'll end up with something more akin to a messy but tasty cobbler. Thanx Cindy!

This turned out very well. I used no sugar added cherry pie filling and fat free cream cheese and splenda in place of the sugar yet it came out tasting very rich and decadent.I also added just a 1/2 t. of lemon juice to the cream cheese mixture. My husband has already requested I make it to take to family dinner because he knows his father who is diabetic will love it. The one thing I'll do different next time is increase the recipe for the crust, it barely went up the sides of the piepan, the crust itself was very tasty and quick to make!

I agree that this recipe was very good! BE SURE TO LET IT COOL! I made it the first time and didn't wait as another has said and had a mess on my hands.  Make it ahead and let it set.  Thank you so much for the recipe!

Terrific and so simple! Cheated and purchased a graham cracker crust, made both a cherry and a strawberry one.  Very good!

This was super easy to make a quite yummy!  The pie filling had a bit of a funny flavor which detracted from the pie a bit, but that is my fault not the recipe.  I agree with another reviewer that making the crust as stated is key...it is really yummy and much different than a store bought.  Takes only a minute too, so glad I didn't opt for the premade I had in the fridge.

This has become my go to pie recipe with my home canned cherry pie filling. Everyone loves it! I have made it as is and I have used frozen pie crust as well. Both are awesome and always gone in one sitting. Thank you so much for an easy but yummy recipe.

This is so easy to whip up. I have used both a home made crust and a ready made chocolate graham cracker crust and they both come out great. This is one of my husband's favorite pies.

Spreading the cheesecake topping can be a little tricky.  While I haven't nailed the aesthetic eye appeal of this desert just yet the flavor of it does not disappoint!  A truly a delicious gourmet treat made with no hassle.

This recipe was SO EASY! This is the first pie I've ever made (and first pie crust from scratch) and it was delicious. 

If I had to change something, I'd make the cheese topping more fluffy. It was a tad dense but now I'm just nitpicking.

Very easy and really refreshing! I made it twice now as directed and I wouldn't change a thing! Mine did take longer to bake than stated, about 45 minutes. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Update: I make this so much at my families request. Everyone loves it! Try with blueberry pie filling for a yummy change!

This was an amazing pie. Next time I think I will make it with canned blueberries since my male counterpart doesn't always care for cherries. But wonderful nonetheless.
