This was the first time I cooked for 40+ people so I used this recipe and changed the serving size. I made enough rice for 50 and I must say they all loved it, especially my friend whose mom makes authentic mexican rice said it was delicious. I'm definitely making this for every taco or enchilada night! The only addition I added was chopped white onions to it.

This is very good! I used olive oil to fry the rice for health reasons. No other changes made and we really liked this rice recipe. It is not like any other I have had so don't try to compare it with the recipes that are spicy. There are no peppers or cumin, just a mild but flavorful rice.

Made exactly as specified & it was almost exactly what I was looking for.  This was extremely easy to put together.  Next time however I will add sauteed onions & fresh garlic instead of the powders.  I'm trying to find a replicated recipe of my favorite Mexican restaurants rice but having a difficult time.  This is so close.  Will make again and continue to tweak it.

Made this recipe and it came out very nicely.  Since I didn't have the tomato bouillon, garlic powder, and onion powder I substituted with salt, tomato paste, and adobo.  I kept tasting with a teaspoon to see if the seasoning was fairing well. Came out Good.  Best thing about this recipe is that it gave you the CORRECT instructions on timing the absorption rate. Most times you either under cook or over cook the rice, this one was perfect. Best tip I can give with rice is use a clear top pan. Lets you see what's going on inside.

We really like rice done with the tomato-flavored bouillon powder.  (You will find it next to the chicken bouillon at the market)  I can't speak to the ratio of water to rice as I used my rice cooker.  Frying the rice in a bit of oil in the rice cooker and then adding the water to the correct line and the tomato bouillon.  Very nice rice.

This is exactly the recipe I've been looking for! Tastes like the rice served in my favorite Mexican restaurant. Nothing fancy, just simple & good! And so easy! For those who are wondering, the tomato-chicken bouillon is called Caldo de Tomate by Knorr. It's by the regular bouillon in my store.

I made this as a side. Rice was well done, surprised since I can't cook rice at all.

10-22-19 ~Admittedly, I chose this recipe for Mexican rice because of its simplicity (and because I had this tomato-chicken bouillon powder on hand and was happy for the opportunity to use it).  I know there are “better” recipes out there, with a more complex flavor profile because of additional ingredients, but in this instance, I just wanted quick and easy.  Hubs was out of town and I needed just a bit of rice to go with a piece of halibut I baked for myself.  This really fit the bill, and I made it even easier since I started off with already made, Chinese take-out rice.  For a half recipe, I simply mixed ¼ cup of water with the bouillon powder and onion and garlic powders.  After heating the cooked rice in butter rather than oil, I added my tomato mixture and let that simmer until the consistency I desired.  This was subtly flavored, a great supporting rice dish that didn’t compete with the main entrée.

Awesome recipe!  Easy peasy, fluffy and delicious.  My husband and I just loved this.  My new go-to for authentic Mexican rice.  Be sure to use the Caldo Tomate by Knor--I dissolved it in the water to make it easier, other than that, followed the recipe exactly.

This has become our go-to rice for serving with Mexican dishes, after trying many, MANY recipes. We like that it's got a mild flavor that doesn't overwhelm the other food, and I like that it's an easy preparation and I can keep the ingredients in the cabinet and they don't take up much space so I nearly always have everything on hand. Cheap, easy, tasty, what's not to like? Sometimes if the other dishes are very flavorful the rice seems like it's actually a bit too mild, but a grind or two of salt or some additional garlic or onion powder easily take care of that.

one of my Mexican  friends taught me how to make rice & it was just like this recipe. I pull it up every time I make it just to make sure I get the measurements right. One thing my friend suggested, and I usually do, is use chicken stock instead of water in this recipe. Takes it from an 8 to a 10.

I make this rice following the recipe almost exactly as written and it is FABULOUS!  The only deviation was I used Knorr's Tomato Bouillon Powder with Chicken Flavor instead of straight tomato bouillon powder. Great texture, just the right amount of salty deliciousness. It was a huge hit at our table - even the kids loved it (which says a lot!). Super easy to make!

This was fantastic! I can't believe I am gushing this much about rice. I made it for 32 people in 2 pots and it turned out perfect as written. I will never make another Mexican/Spanish recipe for rice than this one.

I have been looking for a recipe like this.  It's so good! It took 3 stores to find the tomato bouillon.  That's the secret ingredient.  I didn't even know it existed.  Reminds of Tex mex rice at restaurants.  I make it as is.  My 3 year old loves it.  So happy I found this! Thanks for sharing.  This is a keeper!

Really good! I  didn't have the tomato bullion, so I substituted 1 tbsp of chicken bullion and 1 tbsp. Tomato paste.  It did need a little salt though, in my opinion.  Overall, a total keeper, and the most like restaurant  rice that   I've found yet!

I cook everything from scratch. I make rice all the time and have hundreds of great recipes I have created or copied, yet none of them made us happy when it came to complimenting mexican food. I have spent countless hours researching and trying recipes. Mexican food of all sorts is my family's absolute favorite and I have never  in 40 + years been able to find the perfect rice to go with it all This was absolutely perfect! Amazingly simple- yet still absolutely perfect! I have a huge family and  feed about 50+ people almost every weekend for some event or another. All of their compliments puts this at a 250 star recipe! Thank you so much for sharing!

My kids love this.  I've been making this with jasmine rice instead (just following the cooking directions on the rice bag) with no issues.

I found this recipe to be very bland.  I needed to add salt and more tomato seasoning.  I think cooked onions would benefit this recipe as well.

Okay, I have been searching for a authentic Mexican rice recipe for years, literally! My husband is from Arizona and I lived there 11 years. We now live in Pennsylvania so any decent Mexican food is prepared at home. This recipe is perfect! I did add fresh garlic, onions instead of powder and jalapenos because we had some. Thank you, thank you, thank you!

I loved the flavor. I used less of the tomato bouillon since it already tasted pretty salty.

Love it! It was a hit for the party and at home... I actualy tripled the recipe and still didn't have leftovers! Only tweak was using fat free low sodium chicken broth instead of water.

This turned out great! Other recipes have you rinse the rice forever, not this one. Be patient and make sure you cook the rice until golden brown before adding the liquid! I may add a little less liquid. I used a  Knorr tomato chicken bouillon cube also added dehydrated onion..yummy!

Turned out fantastic, just what I was looking for. Husband loved it and tasted great reheated. I used normal white rice, not the long grain.

This is so close to restaurant style Mexican rice. I found 1 1/2 TBSP was way too much boullion for 1 c of rice...Too stong and salty.  I made it again with 1 1/2 tsp. The tomato flavor is still a little strong so next time I will cook with 2 c rice and see how it turns out. Will continue to make as a side dish. Thanks for the recipe.

This rice was perfect for the diner I made.  I have never used tomato bullion before.  I found some Knorr  tomato with chicken bullion.   I did use half the water and half chicken broth, I also saute'd sweet onion and garlic in oil then added the rice to the oil to brown.  I did also sprinkle some of the onion powder and garlic powder to taste.  
Went really well with the Salsa Chicken from this site.

This rice recipe is great and easy.  I didn't have the tomato bullion so I just used chicken bullion and added 2 tbsp of ketchup and some chipolte pepper sauce... I also added about 1/2 cup of cooked kernel corn... You could also use salsa or fresh diced tomatoes if you don't have tomato bullion...

We like it a lot.  I don't pre-fry the rice though.  I just mix it all together and cook like I would normally cook white rice.  It's also delicious to make a full meal by browning ground meat and diced onion and/or corn In the pot before mixing all the ingredients and then cooking as you would normally cook rice.
