I made this pie for a 4th of July family reunion of 35 people. 
Instead of making the crust I got a ready made Oreo pie crust but followed the rest of the directions just like they are shown & it turned out great.
I also made a second one & added butterscotch pudding to the cream cheese & sweetened condensed milk mixture that came out well also,The pudding made it very thick but once everything else was on it & chilled for 3 hours .....well both of them within 30 mins. of putting them on the table, were gone & I have requests for more.I wonder if the people that said it wouldn't set, use evaporated milk instead of the sweetened condensed milk?
I know that I almost made that mistake.
Just a thought.

I did an experiment after reading so many "filling not setting" comments: I put it in the refridge for a couple of hours BEFORE pouring into the crust.  Surprize! Mine was set so that it was the same thickness as the cream pie filling you buy at a store!  I was so creamy and sweet!  I actually folded some melted cholocate in the half of the filling, and it was delicious!  You just need to make sure you are using a can of SWEETENED CONDENSED MILK, not evaporated milk.  I agree with the previous reviewer - I think the people with "filling not setting" made a mistake using evaporated milk.  I will make it again!

Make sure the sweetened condensed milk is made with whole milk. The reicpe does NOT work with lowfat or nonfat.

I made this pie, refrigerated it for 7 hours, and it still didn't get firm.  I had to serve it like mushy ice cream, and it was very embarressing for me.  I think an ingrediant must be missing.  It was almost too sweet too.  Very disappointed.

I agree with some of the other members' reviews. There's an ingredient missing in the recipe that will serve to bind the cake together. I also had to resort to freezing the cake just so that it would set. Also, I recommend omitting the sugar, since the cookie crust is sweet enough without it. Lastly, there's too much condensed milk called for here, which overpowers the cream cheese.

I have to agree with everyone!  This pie never firmed up.  I think if someone could figure out how to make this pie firmer it would be pretty good.  I did taste the sagging pie and it wasn't bad, but I too was embarrassed and dissappointed.
I will admit it was very easy to prepare, but with no satisfaction.

There must be an ingredient missing in this recipe.  It never did set up.  Great flavor but had to serve it in a bowl.

I love sweet stuff, but this was extremely sweet.  I made it for a birthday celebration and ended up throwing most of it away.

Refrigerated overnight at nearly freezing temperature & still did not become firm.  Extremely rich & sweet.  Left out the sugar for the crust and it was still too sweet to enjoy.

I added a little rum extract to the filling and a small package 3 oz of instant vanilla pudding to the filling.  Also the cream cheese was room temp and the Sweetened Cond Milk was cold.  I mixed in the pudding mix and rum extract to the cond milk and whipped it really well before I added in the cream cheese - and then whipped it for 8 minutes.  Mine set up really well.  The filling tasted like the king Edwards pie.  I also used the carmel and choc magic shell to drizzle over the top of the pie and then topped it with whipped cream and sprinkle toasted pecans and more of the toppings then chilled it over night.  It was great.  It seems like the rum extract took some of the sweetness away from the filling.  Don't use fat free products or it will not set up . Use the real thing.

Pie is exactly as it should be and the filling does set if you follow recipe.  I had this at a restaurant in FL and came here to find a recipe like the pie I had!   Fantastic!!!   Thank you for recipe.

I made this pie for a bar-b-que and it was just wonderful.  I think those who had trouble with the filling not setting might have made one or more of these mistakes:  1 - Use only Sweetened Condensed Milk made with WHOLE MILK ONLY  2 - Only ORIGINAL cream cheese will work, don't try to save calories or fat content here!  3 - The SOFTENED cream cheese (remove from refrigerator AT LEAST 3 HOURS BEFORE USING IT) and the Sweetened Condensed Milk MUST BE WHIPPED with an ELECTRIC MIXER on HIGH for the FULL 8 MINUTES required in the recipe.

This is one of those unforgiving recipes.  You will be punished if you don't follow the directions EXACTLY AS THEY ARE WRITTEN!  Please try it again if you had a bad experience the first time.  This is just DECADENT!

I thought this tasted pretty good, but it didn't set up at all.  We put it in the freezer and ate it anyway, but it just didn't turn out like it should have.  I think I will try to make it again, but I will use WAY less milk-- I'm thinking about 1/4 of a 14 oz can should be plenty.  I will probably use more caramels too, as the brown sugar caramel sauce was pretty tasty.

I made this pie for Christmas.  I was disappointed that I used so many fairly expensive ingredients and got the results that I did.  I wish I had read the other reviews BEFORE I selected to make it!  Very disappointed. It never firmed up.  A lot of time and effort to get the results I got.

This is a VERY rich pie, and it turned out runny after refrigerating overnight.  I would suggest freezing it instead of refrigerating it.  Also, put the chocolate on first and then the pecans and caramels- it will look nicer.

The flavors were great, but the 8 oz of cream cheese and 14 oz. can of sweetened condensed mil NEVER set up. It was Turtle Pie Soup! I chilled this thing for 7 hours.  What a waste of my time and the cost of the ingredients.

The idea of it was great, the toppings were great and it tasted good, but the texture did not work out very well. I refrigerated it overnight, then put it in the freezer for about 5 hours before serving and it was still a little runny and very sticky in texture. I would probably put more cream cheese and less condensed milk in. Or maybe use a no-bake cheesecake recipe with cream cheese and cool whip. I also thought there was too much butter in the crust, I had to add more Oreos and blot it with a paper towel to absorb some of it.

Wished I had read the reviews first.  Didnt set at all.  Sure wish Allrecipes would test the recipes before posting them.  No one likes a failure!  1 star for the taste.

Try adding 1/2 cup - 1 cup of vanilla icecream to the mixture.  This should harden it up if you then put it in the freezer.

I have to agree with the majority here.  I made this for our Christmas dinner and made it last night hoping that would make a difference....nothing!!  It's not set up...it about ran out of the pie crust.  I DID use sweetened condensed milk and not evaporated milk.  I will never use this recipe again.  I'm embarrassed that I will be serving this pie.  This is the first time I have made this kind of pie and this happens!!
