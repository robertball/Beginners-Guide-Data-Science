The concept of this recipe is great.  However, I made the following changes so that I wouldn't have to deal with the batter being too runny:  Mix together with a beater 1 cup sugar, 1/2 cup butter, 1/3 cup milk, 1/4 cup lemon juice, and 1 egg.  Then add 1 3/4 cups flour, 1/2 tsp baking soda, 1 tsp cinnamon, and 1/2 tsp salt.  Fold in chocolate chips at the end.  This makes it so that the recipe is really a drop cookie recipe.  The flavors actually do blend well together ( I have to admit I was a little skeptical at first).  Thanks for the idea!

Makes a runny batter.  They were as flat as a pancake (I actually have had thicker pancakes) and were tasteless.

wonderful!  Needs a lot more flour, though.  I also added 1/4 tsp salt and a packet of instant lemon pudding mix.  I also used both white and brown sugar.  Wonderful flavor, I didn't need the frosting, the cookie has enough flavor by itself.  Somewhat similar to pumpkin cookie in my opinion.  I found the cookie to be just a bit dense too, but it didn't hinder the wonderful flavor.

I highly commend you on your flavor combination - it has some of my favorite flavors together, and they really work! But this recipe is WAY too heavy on the liquids. I tried adding an egg to help it set... but it was still like a pancake, as some other reviewer mentioned. It needs leavening and a more balanced dry-to-wet ration. I will work on this recipe - it's worth tweaking to get it right! Keep experimenting!

Sorry, but I found the batter was very runny.  I had to pour it into a pan and try to bake as bars instead of cookies.  But, the batter never fully solidified.  Plus, I got a small taste of the batter (after it had cooked for what seemed like forever) and it didn't taste very good.

The recipe as followed made a very runny dough unsuitable for drop cookies.  Definitely needs more flour.  Very disappointing!

After reading the reviews I decided to go with one of the alternative recipes listed in the reviews. They came out so good! I wish there was more of a lemon flavor though.

Way too liquidy. They just melted into nothing while baking. I will be using what is left of these cookies as a pie crust instead.

I wish I had read the comments about adding more flour. The taste is great, but they are so thin they fall apart. I should have known better from the texture of the batter :(
