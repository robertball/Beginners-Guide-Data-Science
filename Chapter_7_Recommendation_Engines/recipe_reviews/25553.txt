Excellent but the printed recipe is a little too moist.  I made it to a T the first time, and the cake was good but a bit oily.  The 2nd time, as suggested by others, I did 2/3 cup each of oil and applesauce, and it was so moist and wet, like a pudiing cake.  The pineapple adds a lot of moisture, so decreasing the oil is ok.  So ever since,  I've used 1/2 cup oil, 1/2 cup applesauce.  Whatever you decide to use (oil, applesauce)just decrease the overall amount to 1 cup. I bake it at 350 degrees (instead of 325) in two 9" cake pans for exactly 30 min.  Turned out perfect.  I use ALL light brown sugar. Drain/squeeze out all of the pineapple juice before adding to the batter.  (8 oz. pineapple = 1 cup)  Will definitely make again.  Super moist!  (4 star original recipe, 5 star with very slight change)  Will be my master recipe.  Use Cream Cheese Frosting II for a layer cake.  If you like heavy frosting, you might need to use 3 packages of cream cheese.

THIS IS AWESOME RECIPE FOR CARROT CAKE, THE BEST I'VE EVER MADE, BUT I HAVE TO SAY THAT PUTTING IN THAT MUCH OIL IS NOT NECESSARY.  INSTEAD I CUT THE OIL IN HALF AND ONLY USED 3/4 C. AND THEN ADDED 3/4 C. OF UNSWEETENED APPLESAUCE.  CAKE TURNED OUT MORE FLAVORFUL AND MOIST BESIDES LOSING ALL THOSE CALORIES AND FAT.  WILL DEFINATELY MAKE AGAIN.  HOPE THIS HELPS.

I have made the cake so many times since I found it.  My family loves it.  My boyfriend takes it to work on the construction site and the guys just love it.  I can never have enough in the house. It is so good you don't even have to use the cream cheese topping. I think the next time I make it, I will cut the oil back by 1/4 cup to see how it comes out.  Even though this recipe is excellent, I do find a bit oily.

This Carrot Cake is the Best I have ever eaten. my husband likes spice cake so I added 1/2 teaspoon of cloves and 1/2 allspice I also added 1 cup rasins because I had them on hand , but would be just as good without them. When my hasband ate a piece of this cake he says " WOW this is the beat cake you have made in 45 years " That says alot for this recipe ,as over the years I have baked alot of desserts. Allrecipes.com is the best site for recipes. Thanks for the Moist Carrot Cake Recipe

This is a very good recipe for carrot cake.  I was looking for one that included pineapples, coconut, and nuts.  I used pecans because I have them readily available.  The only modification that was made was that I added 1 tsp. of vanilla to the cake batter.  The cake was very moist and I made a cream cheese frosting for it that consists of 4 oz. of cream cheese, 2 tbsp. butter, 1 tbsp. of milk, 1 tsp. vanilla and 2 cups of confectioner's sugar.  Make sure that the cream cheese and butter are soft when mixing.  I got rave reviews from everyone for this cake and I will definately make it again.

This cake was delicious. I used 3/4 cup of oil & 3/4 cup of applesauce and cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cup to cut down on calories.  It was very moist and will make again.

this recipe was really good but, it was a little too oily for me.  i think next time i'll put 1 c of oil instead of 1 1/2c.  it did take longer to bake as said by other reviews. i baked mine for 15 min. longer.

This was a good basic recipe.  I like many others here don't care to use so much oil so i used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup of apple butter.  I reduced the sugar to 1-1/2 cups and omitted the walnuts and coconut from the cupcake.  I made a coconut flavored cream cheese frosting and toasted some unsweetened coconut to decorate.

I brought this cake to work for a birthday and was told this was the best carrot cake ever!!!In fact, the birthday girl, who never eats cake, managed to eat a large piece.  I will definitely make this again--thank you for sharing.  Also, I added a tsp. of vanilla to the batter and made a fabulous cream cheese frosting.  Please note--it is now 2009 and I continue to bake this carrot cake.  The only changes I would make (not previously pointed out) would be to reduce the oil to one cup (or less) and to bake the cake at 350 degrees for an hour.  Make sure to test center of cake for doneness, or it will fall in the center or not bake thoroughly.

My co-workers gave me five stars! One said that it was absolutely delicious and another said that they were fighting over it. She loved how moist it was. I did make a few changes, based on what other reviewers said. Instead of vegetable oil, I used 1/2 cup melted butter and 1/2 cup of applesauce (so the cake was moist and had a nice butter taste). I used 3/4 cup white sugar and 3/4 cup brown sugar, which turned out just sweet enough. I messed up by buying diced pineapple, but crushed pineapple would have been better in providing a more even texture. Definitely squeeze out the excess pineapple juice! I also added a small package of raisins, which I soaked in water for about 5 minutes (maybe next time I will try soaking in the leftover pineapple juice). To the dry mixture, I had also grated a dusting of nutmeg. Also added 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla. For frosting, I combined one 8-ounce cream cheese and 1/2 cup butter (both room-temp) with 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla and 2 1/4 cup powdered sugar. Thanks so much to Koribear and other reviewers for the recipe!

So I made this cake because everyone said how great it was. However, I never got to try it because it was like soup in the middle. I cooked it for 40 min and it was nowhere NEAR done. I followed the recipe exactly.. and even didn't put as much oil in like everyone was saying. Is the baking time way off on the recipe?

that's what i've been looking for since i came back from ireland. i've tried at least 7 different recipes and this is going to be the last one. it's brilliant! of course i changed it a bit :-) i added more spices - lots of grated ginger, some nutmeg, allspice, cloves, orange zest and instead od half cup oil i put half cup orange juice, changed white sugar to brown muscovado and instead of walnuts and pineapple i used raisins but all the rest (don't be laughing - theese are just small changes ;-)) it's absolutely fine including time of baking. well, of cource i covered it with cheese frosting. that is a must. anyway: big thanks!!!

This cake is amazing. Your guests will LOVE, love, love it! Sometimes I substitute 1/2 the oil with Applesauce, sometimes I don't. Either way, it's a fantastic recipe. Many thanks to Koribear's co-worker :).

I made this cake for the first time two nights ago and my husband and I finished it this morning. Per the suggestions of some of the other reviews, I made these changes: 1/2 c. less sugar than original recipe 1/2 c. oil only 1 1/4 c. applesauce - no pineapple 1 tsp. nutmeg (I tried adding clove too, but I only had whole cloves and trying to grate them didn't seem possible. 1/2 extra cup of shredded carrots (combined with amount from original recipe) 1/2 extra cup of nuts (combined with amount from original recipe) It was baked in a glass 9 x 13 pan and came out ready at 25 minutes. It was super moist, so moist I think next time I might try getting rid of a little more of the oil for applesauce, plus I made a cream cheese frosting (3 tablespoons freshly squeezed orange juice, 12 ounces light whipped cream cheese, confectioner's sugar to taste: 1-3 cups) which was also very moist, so I don't think it would be a problem to do less oil and more applesauce. Thanks for the recipe!

This is the same recipe I have used for years.  Although my recipe calls for coconut I do not use it because of personal preference.  This cake gets rave reviews everytime I make it and I have been asked for the recipe more times than I can count!  I am very confused about some of the other reviews that say the cake is too oily.  I have never had that thought.  Baking in 3 round cake pans will allow a shorter cooking time so that the cake will remain very moist. I always ice the cake with homemade cream cheese frosting.  When taking this cake to church gatherings it is usually the first dessert to go and I rarely ever have leftovers!

Delicious! Very, very moist and flavorfull. Every forkfull fills your mouth with distint (yet light enough to not overwhelm one another) flavors of coconut, pineapple, nuts, and cinnamon. I omitted the cream cheese icing - didn't want it to mask such delicious flavors. Also, I used BRAZILIAN NUTS(castanha do Para), adding a tropical twist to the cake. This recipe now ranks as my favorite carrot cake recipe. NOTE: it is moist enough to make allowance for overbaking time errors. (The first time I made this cake, I left it in the oven 20 minutes longer than called for. To my surprise it didn't burn. Instead, it formed a delicious, sticky/sugary golden crust around the entire cake (top, sides, and bottom)).

Super yummy!!  I don't understand the reviewers complaining it's too moist, what do you expect from a recipe called moist carrot cake?  I did do a few changes mainly because of a lack of ingredients.  I used half oil half applesauce, I used trail mix instead of walnuts and I used pineapple tidbits since I had no crushed.  Went over so well I didn't even get a chance to frost it before it was all eaten up.

The cake was delicious. My deviations were: I added 1 cup of oil and 1/2 c of applesauce. I also used raisins instead of coconut.  I will use this recipe always.  I made best carrot cake in the world, also on this site, was dry.

It should be moist, it has 1.5 cups of oil in it. And it tastes like it.

This cake is fabulous!! Instead of the one and a half cups oil, I used half buttermilk. Also I did not drain the pineapple. Much better tasting the next day.

It's become my favorite carrot cake recipe although I have to leave out the coconut due to someones allergy.  I double the shredded carrots instead and it works out great.

Cake was very moist however it takes at least 45 minutes cook time.  When checking it at 35 min. the center was not done.  Very good and will make this again.  Big hit at Easter dinner.

This was absolutely delicious. So moist, even the second and third days. I substituted 1/2 cup of oil with unsweetened applesauce and added raisins. It turned out perfectly. I got rave reviews at work and a party. I made them into cupcakes and baked for 20 minutes.

I recently purchased a juice extractor and found that this is an excellent way to use the pulp that is left when juicing carrots.  As recommened by others, I reduced the oil to 3/4 c. and added 3/4 c. of unsweetened applesauce.  I also reduced the white sugar to 1 c. and added 1 c. of brown sugar as well as ommitting the coconut (personal preference).  I baked it in two 9 in. rounds, layered and frosted with Cream Cheese Frosting II found on this site.  Even my two year old loved it.  This recipe will definitely be used again.

I made this cake for my husbands 30th birthday and brought it to work for him......In my opinion, I BOMBED the recipe.  I didnt have canned pineapple, and wasnt exactly sure how to measure 8 oz, so I decided to use the fresh pineapple I happened to have.  I crushed the pineapple, and forgot to drain it.....I used about one cup with the juice, and added 1/4 cup more flour when I realized how thin the batter was......
However, everyone at work thought it was great (while I was embarassed to hand it out).  I thought it was a little heavy due to the pineapple juice....but everyone else was impressed....Someone even asked for the recipe, so guess it was good!

Very moist! It's a hit with my neighbours, especially with one of them who doesn't like butter. I added 1 teaspoonful of vanilla essence and put in one & a half cup of brown sugar instead of the white sugar. Have bake it quite a few times and would definetly do it again.

This is the best carrot cake I have eaten in a long time.  Most cakes I have tried are not as moist.  This is a very moist cake and I definitely will make it again.  I took several pieces to my parents and they enjoyed it, too.

Following are a few changes that I made.  It still came out quite tasty.

Alterations made to carrot cake:
2 cups & 4 tablespoons of cake flour
1 cup vegetable oil
3 cups shredded carrots
1 cup chopped walnuts
Add 1 teasppon each of nutmeg and allspice

I think I may make this one again for our family Thanksgiving dinner.  Yummy!!

This is an excellent moist carrot cake. I've tried some other carrot cake recipes, but they have turned out dry and crumbly. This is a truly moist carrot cake. I bake for friends, family, and coworkers, and my coworkers raved about this cake. One, who really loves carrot cake, told me it was the best she's ever had. Another, who really loves carrot cake, said she only eats them from one of the restaurants in town, because they're the only place to get it right. She said this rivalled that cake.  I made these into cupcakes using the recipe as written, and the only word of advice I have, is that if you make cupcakes, only fill your papers half full. The cupcakes tend to grow beyond the paper if you fill to the typical 3/4 full. I also used a cream cheese icing with marshmallow fluff in the mix. I think the combination of the unique icing and this moist cake is the bomb.

Good, but......too oily, cut back on the oil, and you've got yourself a yummy cake, cut down to 1 cup and it's just as good.  Thanks for sharing.

We loved this cake. We've had a few bad carrot cakes before because their to dry but this one was perfect. The only thing I did different was I added Sharon Lugdon's Cream Cheese Frosting (off this site) to my cake while it was still warm and it gave it nice glaze instead of a thick frosting so it added to the flavor without taking the focus off the cake.

I've made three of these cakes this week!   I did three 9" layers instead of a 9x13 pan and used cream cheese icing between and on top of the layers only.  Topped them with some chopped walnuts and they were beautiful.  My husband says it is the best carrot cake he has ever had. Everyone that has had a piece has loved it.

A Bit of work, but WOW!  I brought it to work and it barely lasted the day!  I omitted the nuts, and it was still great.  VERY moist!  It did seem to take a long time to cook though...I kept thinking it was going to burn; it took about an hour.

This was the first time I baked a carrot cake. It turned out really great. Next time I do this cake I will skip the coconut flakes as my family is not really big on it.
Thanks for the recipe.

I have been baking cakes for a long, long time, and I have made a lot of carrot cakes, this is by far the best I have tasted. It is very moist and just the right amount of sweetness. My family and friends all asked for the recipe.

OMG!!!  The best carrot cake I have ever had.  I wanted to make a carrot cake for my mom's birthday, but had never made one before.  I came across this recipe and decided to try it.  I read the reviews ahead of time and saw where most complained about too much oil, so I cut back the oil to only 1 cup (didn't have any applesauce to substitute).  I also added raisins, other than that I followed the recipe to a T and it was better than perfect.  SO MOIST, full of flavor and goodness.  Really easy to make too!!  I used the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe for the final touch... it's what heaven tastes like.  :)

Tried it, and love it!! "Moistness" promised and delivered.  I substituted 3/4 cup of raisins for the walnuts, and would suggest if you you use the sweetened coconut flakes, reduce the sugar by 1/4 cup.  Looking forward to sharing this recipe with my baking-buddies.

Have made this many times now and have even baked two cakes in the oven at the same time on the middle rack at 325. I follow the recipe except I omit the walnuts. Whether or not I make one cake or two at a time, I have found it takes more like 55 min. or more to be fully baked and set in the middle. I always get many compliments every time I make it. I am still trying to perfect the frosting and am always looking for a frosting recipe that is a keeper as well. Highly recommend this.

I was excited to make this cake as my family loves carrot cake until now.  This was was indeed moist because of all the pineapples, it was borderline mushy.  I would make this cake with less raisins and definately less pineapple.

I made this carrot cake for Easter.  After reading reviews, I decreased the oil to one cup.  I don't like coconut so eliminated it completely.  It took more like 50 minutes to bake in my oven but it turned out amazing.  It's the best carrot cake I've ever made.
Next time I will try 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup oil and cut down the sugar to 1 1/5 cups - I'll be curious to see if I notice a difference.

I loved this cake, I listened to the other reviews and did 3/4C of unsweetened apple sauce and 3/4C of oil, and I also halved the sugar as well (I used one cup). It really is a delicious, moist cake - even after a couple of days!

Absolutely delicious.  This cake passed the taste test of our son-in-law who was ready to spend $50 for a 9" round layered carrot cake; we thought too much and decided to bake out own following this recipe.  Moist, tender, but held together well.  wonderful combination of textures and flavors.  We'll make this again and again.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This is the same recipe I have been using for years -- everyone raves over it.  People swear it is the best carrot cake they have ever had.  I got it from my mother, who got it from her father.  Mine calls for pecans instead of walnuts.  Other recipes don't include the can of crushed pineapple, but it makes it so moist.  I use a bag of grated carrots from the store which makes prepping super easy.  Also fantastic for cupcakes with lots of cream cheese frosting.  Incredibly rich.  Even people that don't like carrot cake love this!

I needed a great recipe for making Carrot Cake for my parents 50th Wedding Anniversary celebration.  I made 7 of these cakes, modifying the recipe to reduce the oil to 1 cup and the sugar to 1 1/2 cups.  I also added raisins. I made them a week in advance, froze them and the day before I finished them with my own cream cheese frosting recipe, but the cake was a huge hit, with all 112 servings gone!  It was a very well liked.

AMAZING. I'll make this again and again. The only change i made was less oil. I used 1/2 cup veg. oil, 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup yogurt rather than the 1 1/2 cups of oil. I made this in two loaf pans so I could give half to a friend and keep the other half for myself. Don't forget the cream cheese frosting!

This was a great recipe with a couple alterations as suggested by reviewers. I used 1/2 c oil and 3/4 cup unsweetened applesauce. It turned out very moist and was a major hit in my family, my great nephews were over and they loved it so much that the 14yr old asked me for the recipe so he could make it when he got home. Used cream cheese frosting and that topped it off beautifully. Thanks.

Really great carrot cake! I did use 1/2c applesauce and oil. I also, reduced salt to 1/2 tsp and added 1/8 cloves, 1/8 tsp allspice and 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp vanilla. Baked in two 8 in cake pans at 325. I add 3 tbsp sour cream to cream cheese frosting.

Made this for Thanksgiving this year for the first time. What a hit. Excellent and actually very attractively presented cake, with the bright color from the carrots so vivid. I followed some of the suggestions of others, and reduced the oil, adding applesauce instead, and also added some finely chopped mixed dried fruit (about a half a cup) and instead of all white sugar, substitued equal portions of honey and brown with the white, equally 1-1/2 cups instead of the 2 cups in the recipe. I did not even notice the lack of sugar! I did add cloves, cinnamon and allspice (1/2 tsp each) and 1 tsp vanilla. Also, I used half of the amount of powdered sugar in the recipe for cream cheese frosting, and it came out fabulous. I have requests from my 17 year old daughter to make this every year on her birthday. (She ate 1/3 of the cake by herself!) I think next time I'm going to add some diced mandarin oranges. This is a really fun recipe, because you can play with it and it is very forgiving!

Great! A little lacking in that traditional carrot cake flavor... too much pineapple I think. But otherwise delicious.

This is about the best tasting carrot cake I have ever had. I made it for my hubby's birthday, who is a health nut. He actually had 3 pieces (so we could get it out of the house, haha). I used brown sugar instead of white. I noticed that some of the reviews said to cut back on the oil. I cut back to 1 cup, but it still may have been a little much as the cake was mushy in the middle. So I cooked it about 50 minutes, almost too long. Next time I will use 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce. Great recipe with a few minor changes.

Baking and sharing with friends and family is my hobby.  After making this cake, I have had numerous people begging for the recipe.  I've made many carrot cakes over the years, but this one is by far the most rich and moist.  Throw out all those old carrot cake recipes and keep this one instead!  Happy baking!

I was at work and decided to pick up ingrediants for a carrot cake.Later that afternoon my husband called t o say he found a carrot cake recipe that we could make tonight. Well it was back to the store for the pineapple and coconut but it was worth it. This is a wonderful cake the only change that we made was to substitute some of the oil for applesauce and it turned out fablously. Will be making this again and again.

Yum! I was searching for a carrot cake recipe since store bought ones taste like plastic. This is it! Rather than using all white sugar..I reduced the total amount (don't like desserts too sweet)and put in 3/4 cup white sugar and 3/4 cup brown sugar. I also replaced half the oil with unsweetened applesauce. I added raisins but next time will leave them out. Extra cinnamon and some nutmeg really made this cake full of flavor. The Cream Cheese II frosting was easy and balanced the cake flavors perfectly!

Although i am not a big fan of carrot cake,this cake was devoured at my husband's work place. They said the best part about the cake was that it was really moist and not overly sweet.I did take a note from the other reviews and decreased the oil to a cup.Thats all it needs really.Oh,and I left out the coconut,just didnt have any.This should do really well with carrot cake lovers.You wont be disappointed.

Fantastic cake! Easy, delicious and enjoyed even by those who normally don't like carrot cake. The only thing  I found, was that I had to bake it for about 15 minutes longer than stated in the recipe. Otherwise - ace!

I found this to be my all time favorite carrot cake.....Most of all I found it to be very moist as well as a lg cake my mother whom is queen of all desserts told me it was the best carrot cake ever and of course I had to give her the recipe...the only changes I made in the recipe was that I put 3 cups of carrot instead of 2 3/4 . I bought betty crocker cream cheese icing which made it mouth watering....try it you will love it.

Tried many, this recipie works! The extra oil and eggs make this deliciously moist.  I used a tablespoon of cinnamon.  Also, I get cream cheese filling from the cake decorating store and use that as a topping  - yummy!

Was ok to much oil needs something else other than that. Needs some pecans. I would not make again would try another recipe looking for something a little lighter on the fork too dense.

This cake is FABULOUS!!! My son wanted a carrot cake for his birthday party, and I didn't have a recipe for one. So glad I found this! I loved all the ingredients (pineapple, coconut, nuts, etc). It so moist. I, too will cut down on the oil next time, as it took over an hour to bake in order to get the middle done. I added a teaspoon of vanilla, and almost a cup of raisins, as suggested by others. I frosted it with the cream cheese frosting. Everyone loved it. Allrecipes.com is the best place to find fantastic recipes!

THIS CAKE WAS GREAT, MOIST, AND A BIG HIT AT A CATERING JOB I HAD.  I MAKE TWO LARGE SHEET CAKES AND HAD OTHER DESSERTS.  ENDED UP SAVING ONE CAKE AND DROPPED OFF AT THE COUNTRY CLUB FOR THE STAFF AND WHOM EVER ELSE.  NOTHING BUT GREAT REVIEWS FROM ALL.  WILL MAKE AGAIN AND AGAIN.  NOT HARD TO MAKE EITHER!

Excellent carrot cake.  Very moist.  I only used 1 1/4 c. oil.  I had to bake it about 45-50 minutes in order for the center to cook through.

It makes me crazy when people change the recipe then review their own. I followed this recipe exactly but used just 1/4 less oil because it seemed like a lot. It's a delicious, wonderfully moist cake but was still far too oily. Next time I will use only 1 cup oil or maybe less. And I used the "Basic Cream Cheese Frosting" recipe from this site. Very good.

I found that this cake was nowhere near done at 40 minutes. I must admit that the smell wafting through my house as it bakes is making me drool! :)

Thank you, thank you! Yuuuummy! Did cut back on the oil a bit, but still, the best carrot cake ever. I must say, I am kind of bored of all the compliments I get, though!

Amazing!  I cut the oil to 1/2 cup but included 1/2 cup apple sauce.  I also used more coconut because I had extra and walnuts because I like them!  Loved this and will make it again!

Delish!

I used 1/2 C applesauce in place of the same amount of oil - as many reviewers said the cake was too oily. I added a handful of raisins, a dash of grated nutmeg and about 1/4 tsp cloves. I think I mistakenly omitted 1 C of the sugar - my kids were all over me when baking-so it wasn't very sweet. Not bad but a cream cheese icing saved it.

Next time I will add nuts.

When checked at 35 minutes the middle jiggled like soup so I added 10 minutes cook time.

I have to say this was the easiest way to make carrot cake from scratch.  This was so moist and delicious. I made it into four layers and mixed cream cheese with an already made canned white cream frosting from BC.  Totally the best and I will make this again for anytime.

Even without the frosting, this is super yummy. Based on what I had, I exchanged the pineapple for raisins, the nuts for pecans and it was absolutely delicious. Thank you! :)

OMG I have made Carrot cake before but not like this !! WoW.
But I have to agree with MommyFromSeattle. Cut back on the oil, but dump a 14 oz can of Pineapple(drained),and add 5 to 10 min to bake time(check with toothpick). And Perfection.

What a gorgeous cake, so moist and tasty. I accidentally forgot the pineapple, but  the moistness was perfect. Very sweet topping but scattered a few more chopped nuts , which solved that problem. I didn't have the tin size stated so used two 1lb loaf tins instead so one cake for me and the other for my mum and dad. I am Welsh, so not clever with the 'cup' weights but the conversions  must have been spot on because the result was perfection!! This cake has already become a family favourite.

This carrot cake recipe is the best. Ofcourse I adjusted it a little to make it more like my Jamaican Carrot cake. I used 1c coconut oil, a handful of raisins and a tsp of Jamaican Mixed Spice for baking. My husband enjoyed it and it was all done so fast. Oh I also used fresh pineapple and chopped it rough. It doesnt taste oily but you can see the oil. Made cream cheese frosting to go along; I use my own mix, cream cheese, condensed milk, vanilla extract yum yum.

This carrot cake is fantastic!  I have made it several times.  My only adjustment has been to add 1 tsp of vanilla and to cut back on the sugar by a half cup.  LOVE IT!

Upon reading the reviews, I hesitated with the oil and sugar and did a 50/50 oil and apple sauce.  Plus, I also cut the sugar by half.  The result was not that pleasant.  The cake looked gorgeous - (just like the picture), but it lacked sugar and had a 'bread pudding' texture in the centre.  Next time, i'll still reduce the oil by about 1/2 cup - but no apple sauce and putting in all the sugar!  Will keep u posted! :)

This is a really a divine tasting carrot cake, very moist and had people coming back for third helpings! I also changed it a bit, instead of adding shredded coconut I added half a cup of coconut cream and only used 1 cup of oil instead of 1.5 would recommend this recipe to anyone looking for something easy to make and delicious to eat. This cake also keeps well for about 5 days.

This is an excellent.  I used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce.  I added 1/4 tsp cloves and 1/4 tsp nutmeg.  Next time I will try using less sugar.

I followed the advice of other users... I used 3/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup apple sauce.. I also used crushed cashews instead of walnuts. I needed two pans for this cake batter... and I made a double layer cake with icing between the layers. It was my first attempt at a carrot cake and it turned out well, my guests enjoyed it. I used the "cream cheese frosting II recipe" from this website as well.

I've made this a few times, and each time I am told that it's the best carrot cake ever!  My friends now ask me for some all the time!
I use always used rice bran oil rather than vege oil, and it's gorgeous.
Thanks to whoever posted the recipe - indulgent, but a delicious treat!

Love this! So moist and flavorful. I generally leave out the walnuts (I'm allergic) and flaked coconut (dislike the texture), and add 1/2 cup of vanilla pudding instead... which makes it even creamier! Mmmm.. maybe I'll go make one right now!

This was great!  I was going to sub in applesauce for half the oil like some reccomended but then while cooking I forgot but it turned out awesome.  They aren't joking that its moist, even after several day's in the refrigerator it was still great.  My mother in law told me it was the best carrot cake she had ever had!  I used the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipie and it was amazing!!  I added walnunts in between the layers with the frosting and on top beucase everyone loves them so much.  Overall amazing cake :D

I had to make a few changes to this recipe for it to work.  There was way too much oil and wasn't cakey enough.  I changed the oil to 1/2 cup oil and added 1 cup applesauce, increased the flour to 2 1/2 cups and decreased the sugar to 1 1/2 cups.  Baked in my gas oven for 45 - 50 minutes in a bundt pan.

Made this and it came out extremely delicious. It was a tad oily so I would use a little less oil next time around. But got a lot of wonderful compliments on it.

I made this for a 9" cake tin, approximately halving the ingredients as described and using MommyfromSeattle's suggestion of replacing about 2/3 the oil with applesauce (and thoroughly squeezing the crushed pineapple). Finished it with a Cream Cheese II topping. The cake was very moist but not soggy and I've been obliged to make again (twice) in the last two months. For someone who's a novice it's straightforward to make and I was able to produce a consistent result over three attempts.

Took this to a going away party and everyone said it was great!  Even people who didn't usually like carrot cake said so!  Very flavourful and moist...much better than Carrot Cake III.  I used 3 large eggs, 1 3/4 cups sugar, dash of ground cloves, 3/4 cup veg. oil, 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce, 1/4 cup buttermilk, 1/2 chopped toasted pecans and 1/3 cup sultana raisins.  After I frosted it with cream cheese frosting I topped it with toasted sweetened coconut.  Next time I'll try a few adjustments with different spices.  Easy to make and tastes great!  Thanks for sharing!

This carrot cake is delicious. It was gone instantly and everyone asked me when I will make it again. I did not use the 2 cups of sugar I used 1 1/4 cup. Thanks for the great recipe.

I absolutely *love* this recipe!! I made a [stand-up] doll cake with it for my daughter's 30th birthday -- it took three tries to figure out how long it wanted to bake in such a deep pan, but it was definitely the hit of the party :-) !!   When I announced that it was another wonderful allrecipes.com recipe, the "other mother" in the room agreed "isn't that just the best site?!"

This was the best carrot cake ever! i read the reviews and tried 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup of apple sauce. And i ran out of sugar so i ended up with 1 cup of white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup cane sugar. I didn't have coconut or pineapple so i just added the carrots and walnuts. Still the best tasting cake ever!!

By far the moistest carrot cake!  I made this cake and baked it in 2 9 inch pans.  I had to leave but one layer wasn't done so I turned the oven off and left it in for about 2 hours; it still came out unburned and moist!  This one is a real keeper, thanks!!!!!

An absolute favorite recipe of mine now. I was surprised by the ingredients of pumpkin & pineapple, but it definetely improves the flavor of carrot cake immensely and it is indeed moist. Try it & you'll love it too

Great with cream cheese frosting. Cut down the sugar to 1 cup. It's the best carrot cake recipe I've tried. All my family loves it especially my husband. He kept requesting for the cake again and again.

I printed this recipe off on 12/17/2007 and have made it several times for work.  It is usally gone before noon!! Everyone loves it.  I do at times substitute ingredients such as applesauce for oil, eggbeaters for eggs, and splenda for the sugar.  It still taste great!! Thanks for sharing!!

I've tried other carrot cake recipes and this is definitely the best. Very moist and my hubby said it was better than his Mom's! Only thing I changed was to add raisins for the raisin lovers in the family. Thanks so much for sharing the recipe.

This makes a super-moist, chunky cake of love!  I've never had anyone not like it, and my daughter has wanted it for her b-day every year since age three.

This is extremely close to my recipe with the following differences:
   no baking powder
   2 teaspoons baking soda
   3 eggs
   2 cups shredded carrots

I make cream cheese frosting.

I've made this cake recipe twice,following the recipe and it takes way longer to cook than the 30-40 minutes at 325!  I baked it in a 9x12 pan.It comes out really well if I bake it for almost twice the time given.I take it to my mothers senior living center and they devour it!

Excellent recipe!  I have made this cake at least five times in the past year, and everyone raves about it!  The only comment I have is when I bake it in a 9 x 13 pan, I must increase the bake time by 10-15 minutes, and my oven is not off.  Just a word of caution if making this cake for the first time.  It is delicious, and you will receive many compliments!!

I've made this recipe 3 times. Two out of 3 times the results were outstanding, but once it turned out way too heavy... I haven't figured out yet what might have happened. The only tweak I make to this recipe is that I use a little less oil and I add about a third of a cup of raisins.

This is the best carrot cake I have ever had. I like to put the batter into two 8" round pans instead and cook them about 3-10 minutes shorter. I find that it makes a better presentation.

My family and I really enjoyed this cake.  I put 1/4 cup less oil and used pineapple juice instead, as another user suggested.  It was really yummy.  I also used three round tins and baked for 35 minutes. I also made this when I didn't have pineapple, I substituted with 1 cup of unsweetened applesauce, and a 1/4 cup less oil, it was really nice.

This was incredible! I didn't drain the pinapple juice and used 1/4 cup less oil and it turned out soooo moist! I omitted the coconut flakes (personal preference) and added raisins instead. If you do add raisins, remember to coat in flour first so they don't stick together in the batter.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is the BEST carrot cake I have ever had!!!  It is very moist and a hit with anyone who tastes it.  I have made it for birthdays, holidays, etc.  It has become my trusty recipe.  Whenever I am told to bring a dessert this is old faithful.  It is a large cake and always turns out perfect.  I have even had people draw straws for who gets the last piece!!  I sent one slice home with a couple and they later told me they fought over who got the last bite!  THIS CAKE IS GREAT!!!!  And easy to make!!

Love this cake! Made it as our Easter dessert and it was fabulous. I rarely bake, but carrot cake brings back fond memories from my childhood and is one of my husband's favorites. Since I'm not a huge baker, I didn't want to go TOO far from the recipe, but so many people suggested cutting back on the oil, so I did as well, but used 3/4 cup, not 1/2 as some suggested. I think it was just right. Dense, but not overly oily. I also made a 2-layer 8" cake and frosted with a double batch of the Cream Cheese Frosting by Sugar from this site and decorated with mandarin oranges. Biting into one of those along with the cake gives you an instant juicy burst...delicious! Thanks, Koribear, for a great recipe.

Ok so here’s the tea I particularly didnt like it, it wasnt moist enough for me. So when I finish making them I didnt put icing on them bc like I said I didnt like it BUT my two children LOVED IT they ate both of them without icing and they enjoyed it! So I guess it just depends on preference

I’ve made this cake twice. The first time it came out good, but the second time it came out AMAZING! I had to tweak it to make it a tad bit more moist. I did use a mix of oil and apple sauce (had to tell myself it’s a healthier option so I wouldn’t feel so guilty). I did layer it with two 9in pans and baked for 30min. Pure heaven ladies and gents...... pure heaven.

Like many other bakers suggested, I cut down the oil to only 1 cup, and I used coconut oil for veggie oil, why not add some extra tropical flavor? I omitted the nuts and pineapple, I don't like pineapple in my carrot cake. But I added ground allspice, ginger and cloves, I love the extra zing of warm spices! Instead of a 13"x9" rectangular pan I used two 9" round pans to make a layered cake. Baked for 35 minutes and it came out beautiful!

I’ve made this carrot cake multiple times now.  It’s always a hit. I’m one to alter recipes to how I see fit. The only thing I do differently to this recipes is I grate fresh coconut and I use  1 cup coconut oil, as opposed to the 1.5 cups vegetable oil. Other than that, I make it to a T and it’s always a hit. Thanks KORIBEAR for this recipe! It tastes great with the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe found in this site as well.

I took note and decreased the oil amount, i used 1/2 cup unsweetened apple sauce, 1/2 cup oil. I omitted the raisins as my husbands hates them. I had fresh pineapple i used and strained. I cut back on the sugar as we like less sweet. I used cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice combo for my spices. I used the small snack carrots and chopped them in the blender. It came out nice and moist, with lots of flavor. Will be making again.

I followed the recipe as it was. (I read the too much oil comments after). We all liked it. I added some raisins to the batter and it was good. I made cream cheese frosting and topped it with the rest of the coconut. Everyone loved it.

This recipe is the best carrot cake recipe I have ever tried.  It is so moist.
 Just a warning; one slice is NOT enough....I topped mine with a lemon & Phily Cream Cheese topping.

First carrot I ever made, I used two drops of Clove and ginger essential oils, I made one with ginger and cinnamon essential oils both were so good. My kids ate it up fast.

The only change I made was cutting out 1/2 cup of oil (I used 1 cup) and adding 4 oz more pineapple with juice. It still came out very moist without all the oil. Taste was wonderful. I will make this again.

Very moist!  Took the advice of other reviewers, and reduced the oil to a scant 1 cup.  I also subbed about half of the sugar with puréed fruit (pear and pineapple), and added some allspice and vanilla extract  to give it more flavour (first time making it  I did not change the flavourings and the cake tasted okay but lacking something).  The result was a tasty carrot cake! My third attempt will be to reduce the oil again, try 1/2 cup oil and 1 cup apple sauce?  This cake recipe tends to be on the oily moist side, but it’s worth playing around with the ingredient proportions; everyone enjoyed the cakes, with or without the cream cheese frosting !

I have made this cake so many times, it is fantastic and delicious! I get consistent results with the moistness of the crumb. I have doubled and even tripled this recipe to make beautiful decorated sheet cakes for parties or birthdays. I did make two small changes in the recipe to suit my taste. I added a 1/3 cup of raisins, and also reduced the oil by a 1/4 cup. I still get outstanding results, with a lot rave reviews from all.

Very moist and flavorful cake! Like with any cake, it is better the next day. I did not drain carrots like others had said, however I drained pineapple and only used half the juice. I doubled the cinnamon because we love the spice and used lemon in my cream cheese frosting. I will keep this recipe forever!!!

I used flax eggs instead and I don't know if that made a huge difference but I didn't like it, too much oil also. Maybe next time I'll do something different less oil definitely

Instead of oil I used 1 cup melted butter, and applesauce about 4oz. I didn’t shredded my carrots too small I used the 10oz shredded carrot package from Walmart. I love that I can actually taste the carrots!!! It came out great and moist. I think next time I’ll try it with some vegetable shortening!!

Really good carrot cake. I made this in round pans. I used 2 but 3 would have been better. The cake was moist and very tasty. The pineapple and coconut were just right. I don’t like raisins but I used then anyway. I used the white raisins as they are easier for me to eat. The cake was devoured. Will definitely make this again. I made the cake exactly as listed. The one thing I may have used 3 cups of carrots because it was hard to tell if I had 2 3/4 or 3 so I erred on the more side.

I made a couple minor changes to the recipe that cut significant fat and calories from the cake and I do not think it had any negative consequences.  I used a food processor and finely chopped the carrots... saved a ton of time and the results were near perfect. Instead of oil I substituted unsweetened applesauce.  I believe it added a slight change to the overall flavor profile and I KNOW it reduced the fat and calorie count substantially.  I also added 2 tsp of vanilla extract, because vanilla extract goes well in almost any cake recipe, right?!  Rave reviews from everyone who tasted it.  I also added 10 minutes of cook time, which I “think” may have been due to the applesauce instead of oil.

I cut the oil to 1 cup, sugar to 1 and 3/4 cups and I used light brown sugar on recommendation of others. 

I found the flavour of this cake to be nothing special. It lacked structural integrity and so didn't slice very cleanly. I think this is clear from other people's pictures as well.  I served it with cream cheese icing and it was just too rich and sweet for the cake. 

Pineapple sounded like a great addition but I could barely taste it or find it in the cake and so I think more pineapple might have helped to make the cake a bit more interesting.

I might have enjoyed it more if I followed the recipe to a T but nonetheless, would not make again or recommend.

Love this recipe. This cake is so moist! I prepare it as directed, however, it does take a little longer than instructed.

Excellent recipe. 

I didn't include the coconut; but I regret that and will add coconut next time. I used /4 cup less oil and 3/4 cup less carrots.

Awesome Cake. I changed the recipe a bit. Used melted butter/Margarine instead of oil and reduced the quantity to 1 cup. I did not use pineapple and walnuts. I used Cashew nuts instead and it gave a great taste. With cinnamon I mix half a teaspoon of cardamom powder, which gives nice flavor and aroma. I used freshly scarped coconuts as it is readily available in Sri Lanka and it gave a awesome taste and texture. Everyone loved the cake and I feel very happy every time I make it.

This is the best carrot cake I've ever had. I've actually tried the recipe three ways now, and in my opinion, the original printed recipe with 1 1/2 cups vegetable oil (I used canola/olive/grapeseed blend) is the best way to make it. My grandma said it's the best she's ever had! Even better than one of our favorite restaurants that is known for their scratch carrot cake. I tried the 3/4 cup applesauce, 3/4 cup oil version, and it wasn't bad, but the texture was too wet, not "moist" in the right way. And the applesauce flavor came through a bit making the cake taste kind of fruity. If you do the half applesauce version, I would recommend cutting the sugar down a little. The all oil version is also SO moist but also tender and rich. I also tried half melted coconut oil and half vegetable oil, but it actually wasn't as moist as all vegetable oil. Just stick with the printed recipe! Unless you plan on sitting down and eating half the cake to yourself, it really doesn't make THAT much of a caloric difference per piece. I mean, c'mon, it's carrot cake, I don't expect it to be diet food! :) I've baked in 2 9inch round pans and also a 9x13 - both good just increase the baking time.

Would def make again. Here are my changes: I've made it twice and liked the 2nd time better.
Used GF all purpose flour (Better Batter Brand)
For 1 1/2 cup oil, I substituted:
1 cup apple sauce
1/2 cup coconut oil
1/2 cup sour cream.
My can of pineapple was 20 ounces. I used the whole thing.
For the carrots, I didn't measure; I just shredded 3 large carrots and it looked "about right" and I tossed it in.
I also added 1/2 cup raisins
It was so moist, it doesn't need icing. I just put a little glaze on top to seal it.

Super easy to make. I will reduce oil/use apple sauce next time like others suggested. Also, will reduce coconut and increase pecans (did not use walnut) for the crunch, and maybe add raisins (need to figure out the right amount). This one is  a keeper. Thanks!

I made a few minor changes, I cut back 1/4 cup of oil, 1/2 cup brown sugar, and 1 1/2 cup white sugar, I also soaked my raisins in pineapple juice. I made this cake every thanksgiving, and everyone loves it.

Very good but I  cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup and and I used  1/2 cup coconut oil and 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce in place of all the oil and I added about 3/4 cup raisins turned out very good and very moist. I didn't use the coconut as the coconut oil gave it the the coconut flavor that flakes would of but you have to watch what oil you use as some have no flavor of the coconut I use Carrington Farms pure refined cold pressed 100% organic extra virgin

I used a bundt pan for this, which was a limited success. It was very full and took almost twice the baking time, but was a really pretty presentation.  My family aren't fond of walnuts, so I used pecans instead, which was excellent. This is probably the best carrot cake recipe out there!

I decided to follow this recipe rather than substitute some of the oil as others had.  It did seem like a lot, but I went with it anyway.  The cake is delicious!  Very moist and wonderful flavor and texture.  I didn't find it to be "too moist", as others had said.  My only complaint is it took much longer to bake in my oven for some reason.  After the recommended baking time my center was still very much uncooked.  I baked it another 20-25 minutes.  Best thing about the cake is it gets more delicious the longer it sits.

This makes quite a large cake, I didn't read the ingredients before I decided to double it... Now I have THREE of the most delicious carrot cakes! I don't think I'll have any trouble disposing of them ;) Haha. I didn't read any of the earlier reviews about decreasing the oil either, so I used the full amount but I don't think it's as oily as others have said. Next time I will half the oil quantity anyway just to cut back on some of the calories, but otherwise it's THE perfect carrot cake! I was also impressed that it rose so perfectly, very nice and even so it presents beautifully frosted with cream cheese icing :)

Great recipe!!! We've been juicing and the dry carrot shreds from carrot juicing were used here (great to dual-purpose =).

We've also been baking gluten-free and this recipe turns out *wonderfully* using the gluten-free All-Purpose flour recipe on AllRecipes (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/gluten-free-all-purpose-flour-mixture/).
We always cut down on oil in recipes, so we used 3/4 cup oil, and 3/4 cup unsweetened applesauce. Everything else as the recipe lists (did have to bake just a bit longer but one's oven is never the same as another's, so nothing abnormal).

YUMMY, YUMMY, YUMMY!!

This cake turned out great. I used pecans in place of the walnuts. Used 1/2 cup of oil with 1/2 cup of apple sauce. Baked it for 25 minutes at 350 in two 10 inch spring form pans. It turned out great.

Best carrot cake ever!  I made recipe as is and did not think it was too much oil.  I was a little worried after reading other reviews but I loved it.  It wasn't too sweet.  I did have to bake it for 50min and it was great.  Made cream cheese frosting with 8oz cream cheese, 1 stick salted butter, 1 tsp vanilla and 1 cup powdered sugar.

I made this cake.  I made the changes that most people recommended by cutting the oil to just one cup.  Followed everything else exact.   I took the advice to make two layers in 9 inch round cake pans so that it bakes better.  Still had to bake it an extra 10min or so.   Used a rum cream cheese frosting and people raved how great this cake was.  It was moist and flavorful and not oily.  I have to make another now due to demand.

I have never made Carrot Cake before. I have tasted some massive home made Carrot Cakes before and wanted to see if I could make one. Well I did with this recipe. It was really moist. As a matter of fact it was so moist we had trouble icing it. Oh well, if I'm going to have a problem, I can deal with a problem of being too moist. My wife doesn't like Carrot Cake but she does after eating this. Wow ! This cake was excellant. I can not say enough good things about this recipe.

Will definitely make again. Everyone that tried it LOVED it. Followed these adjustments: less oil (1/2c oil, 1/2c unsweetened apple sce,) used half n half brown sugar/wht sugar each measuring scant, added a sprinkle or two each of Nutmeg, Ginger (generous), Cloves. Used fresh prev cut pineapple that was getting a tad brown sitting in fridge chopped finely and smooshed the juice out in a strainer. Also i Finely grated the carrot. And Did Not use any nuts --don't like them. Baked at 350 in a 9x13 metal pan abt 40-50 mins (cannot recall exactly). Till toothpick came out clean in centre. Super-duper moist delicious recipe!! PS made a quick creamcheese frosting from one of these carrot cakes reviews - was yummy but a bit runny

I make this every year for the past 3 years for my friend who loves a good carrot cake. I use 1/2 C OF STEVIA rather than sugar, and 2T. of cinnamon, 1 c. Oil, and a whole bag of pressure cut shredded carrots microwavedo for 3 min. to soften, and a cup of walnuts. Then I frost with a nechatall cream cheese and honey mixture.

This recipe made the best carrot cake I have ever tasted.  It was loved by all who tasted it. In fact it was three quarters gone 4 hours after it came out if the oven.  I only made one addition, 1 tsp of vanilla to the batter.  I did not think the cake was oily, as some other reviewers  did. It was very moist and packed with flavor.

Made it today. Came out great. I did cut down the oil to 1 cup as per other reviews. Cake came out super moist. Also added about half a cup of raisins. Added cream cheese vanilla frosting and it was a hit. Thanks for the recipe.

This was the best carrot cake I've ever had, and it didn't hurt that I made it myself.  The only changes I made was substituting a bit of the white sugar for brown sugar, and using golden raisins instead of coconut.  My husband, who is a very strict critic, had a HUGE piece, which is all I needed him to say.  I used three cake pans for a layer cake instead of a sheet cake.  I will say the cake was so moist, it was a bit difficult to cut.  Next time, I'll either go with the sheet cake or only two layers. I would definitely make this again.

I love this carrot cake! I must say this is the most moist cake I have ever had. I will make this cake over and over again. It was simple and perfect to me! Some might find it difficult to stack in layers because of the moistness but I made it in a 13x9 pan and cut it out into a cross for Easter. Using a spatula I had no issues. I love this carrot cake, did I mention that?

This is a very solid recipe, but it needs a few mods. After reading some of the other reviews I decided to reduce the amount of oil to 3/4 cup and added 1/4 cup of apple sauce. Also because I used sweetened coconut and cinnamon applesauce I reduced the sugar to just over a cup so it wouldn't be super duper sweet. Also I didn't have crushed pineapple, only pineapple rings, so I put them in a food processor to make it pretty much a puree. Recipe came out super moist and is delish! Lastly since the 9x13 pan I have is very shallow, I decided to bake in two batches (reduced bake time to 25 mins) and make a layer cake with cream cheese frosting and coconut in the middle. YUM!

Top Tip: Bake 1 to 2 days before you intend to serve it as the flavors marry and intensify over time to give an even richer flavor.

Great recipe. Yes could be too oily if you use vegetable oil. Use 1 to 1.5 cups of melted and clarified butter instead. Generally, always replace vegetable oil with clarified butter in any recipe and you will get much better results and flavor.

This is my go to carrot cake recipe. The only changes I made were to use organic ingredients and whole wheat pastry flour, and I bake in 2 9" rounds for a layer cake. I have made many carrot cake recipes over the years, but the moistness and texture of this one tops them all.

Great moist cake. Made this for my brother's birthday. Almost didn't get a piece. This recipe should be baked in a larger pan (14"x10") would work better.

I thought this recipe was awesome! One of the best I've ever made! However I never use vegtable oil or shortening so I substituted the 1 1/2 cup of veg. oil with butter, mayo and olive oil half cup each. It was wonderful! Will use this again, Thanks!

Made this last night as a birthday cake and everyone loved it.  I replaced the can of pineapple with 4 overripe bananas that I had in the freezer and followed other people suggestions on 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup apple sauce with only one cup of sugar.  Taste was great and cake was very very moist.  Would definitely make it again.

I was disappointed, but by following other reviewers. I omitted the 1/2 cup oil and then used 1/2 cup each of oil and applesauce, but kept everything else the same. Too dry! Aterward looking at this photo and remembering my Mom's carrot cake, a good carrot cake is supposed to be slightly oily. That's what makes it good and moist. Next time I will just use the full amount of oil and see if I can give it 5 stars.

The best! I had never made scratch carrot cake and this passed the test with both of my octogenarian aunts. I did substitute half unsweetened applesauce for half of the oil, drained the pineapple well, added pecans instead of walnuts and covered it in cream cheese frosting.

Like others, I lowered the oil and substituted applesauce for part (1/2 c. oil and 1/2 applesauce). I skipped the coconut. With those alterations, 5 stars!

Delicious! This was my first ever carrot cake, and I am sticking to this recipe. Reading the reviews, I made some changes: I juiced half of the carrots and used the pulp only, so it was not too moist, but perfect, and I didn't add the coconut flakes. It was easy to make, too!

Oh my it was amazing and very easy. Mine took twice the time to cook as I don't have fan bake so after 40min I covered with tin foil to avoid the top burning. My whole family loved it and wanting the recipe!!

Made this cake late last night to get rid of leftover carrots and pineapple. As I rummaged through my pantry, I realized that I only had 1 cup of sugar,  1/2 cup of sweetened coconut and 3/4 cup oil, but decided to make it anyway.  I started out by pureeing 1 cup of pineapples, and followed the rest of the directions accordingly.  Baking took about 50-55 min.  I told my husband that he would be taking the cake to work as I was not expecting it to turn out due to my shortage of ingredients.  To my surprise, the cake turned out!  It was SO moist and SO good that my husband volunteered to run out (it was 12AM!!) for cream cheese and butter so I could make the Sprinkles Cinnamon Frosting (one of our fall fav's from food.com).  I finished frosting the cake around 1 this morning.  We had a couple slices before bed and packed some for lunch.  Guess this cake won't be making it into the office!

This cake is great, my new favorite. Everyone loved it. I used the 1/2 cup oil, 1/2 cup applesauce version and it was moist and tasteful. i also used 1 cup Splenda sugar blend in place of the 2 cups sugar. This along with my cream cheese frosting it is a new Easter favorite.

I amde this cake with a slight veriation to the frosting.  I added Almod Extract to the cream cheese frosting as opposed to vanilla extract.  The cake was very moist and all my guests came back for more.  No veriation  to the cake recipe for a super moist 2 layer cake with cream cheese icing in the middle

Delicous cake...very moist and flavorful!  The only change I made was substituting 1/2 of the oil with applesauce (and omitted the coconut b/c we don't like it).  I wanted a layered cake so used 2 9-inch rounds instead of the 9x13.  Yum......

I made this cake for my husband's birthday and we were fighting over the crumbs! I used store bought cream cheese frosting since I am so busy and it didn't matter one bit. I also pressed chopped nuts on the side. Watch out Zingerman's, you've got serious competition.

Dense and full of flavor, the colors and textures are just right. With the cream cheese frosting I found that this is a highly satisfying cake one piece was too much for me, really rich and dense but not too dense because the add-ins provide enough texture to give it volume. My fave recipe for carrot cake to date.

This was the best cake that I have ever made, hands down!  It was easy to make, but with the cooking, I had to leave it in the oven for another 15-20 extra minutes to get it to cook fully.  Man, what a great cake recipe!  I want to share it with all of my friends!

I'm not sure what happened to my cake. I made this cake, because we love moist cakes, and this was not. The taste was good, but not what we were hoping for. I thought that since the recipe name was Moist Carrot Cake that it would be.

With a few slight changes that have already been posted - this cake is amazing! I've never been this lucky with a recipe - everyone LOVED IT and I've had 5 requests since Easter to make it. Made it with Cream Cheese II frosting recipe.

By far the best recipe I have ever tried for carrot cake.  I took the suggestion of decreasing the amount of oil to 1 cup. Because I don't like alot of carrots and coconut in my carrot cake I decreased the amounts on those as well.  It turned out FABULOUS!

I just made this cake for my family this past weekend; everyone could not stop eating it!  I did modify it a little per other commentors advice, like more spices (ginger,nutmeg,allspice)the flavor was outstanding.  I did however use the advice of using 1/2cup oil and 1/2cup applesauce although it was still moist I think next time I might use a whole cup of oil and 1/2cup applesauce I prefer it extra moist :) I iced it with cream cheese frosting adding 1/2tsp ground ginger and 1tsp ofcinnamon yum!

Like others advised, I cut oil back to 3/4 c. and added 3/4 c applesauce.  Didn't have any on hand so I peeled, sliced and simmered 1 med apple then put in food processor.  it made a little over 1/2 cup.  Also added nutmeg, allspice, fresh grated ginger, and raisins.  Turned out excellent.  Will definitely make again.

This is such a delicious carrot cake!! I've made it over and over and am making it again tomorrow. I used cake flour instead of all purpose adding 2 tsp cake flour for each cup. I substituted butter for the vegtable oil and use 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar. YUM so good!!!

We made this cake for Easter.  My kids had a great time shredding carrots and mixing everything up.  I reduce the oil as suggested by another review.  I made a cream cheese icing from Better Homes and Garden and added a tsp. of cinnamon to it.  Everyone raved about the cake and wanted to take ALL the leftovers home.

wow!!! i made this recipe and it was amazing. i used two round cake pans. 8/12 inch. also, i only did 1/2 cup of oil and 1/2 cup of applesauce. everything else i kept the same. it was incredible!!! everyone loves it and keeps raving about it. i didn't have to cook it for a full 40 minutes either. it was pretty much done after 25-30. but that might just be my oven.

thanks so much! yummm!

Thank you Cimmy and Peggy Ann for the alterations to this recipe.  I tired this moist carrot cake for the first time yesterday and it was excellent.  I am from a tropical country so I used fresh pineapple instead of canned.  I also used sweetened applesauce and cut the sugar to 1/2 to 2/3 of a pound, depending on whether or not you intend to use a frosting (which also has sugar).  The cake is moist.  I too some to work for me colleagues and it was a hit.

My family really liked this. 
It was gone in no time, but I didn't find it as moist as I was hoping.  I certainly can't imagine not puting in all the oil mine would have been dry.  I did have to bake it about 20 minutes or so longer to get the middle done.  Maybe I baked it too long.  But it definitely wasn't oily to me at all.  I will probably make it again, and maybe cook it a little less.  I put a cream cheese frosting on  top and it did add a lot to the cake.  Overall, it tastes very good.

I love this recipe.  I'm a beginer and made this for may family this Thanksgiving. I looked more like a pro. I did let  the cake cook closer to an hour and it was still very moist.

This cake was very good, however I think next time that I will cut back a little on the oil. No one complained but I knew how much went into the mixture. I will definitely make it again. Also, I made a smaller verison by using a loaf pan and I put a little too much batter in the pan and yes it did overflow (thank goodness it was on a cookie sheet), baking time was alot longer and I thought that it was going to be a total loss.... but it came out fantastic!

I made this for Easter and everybody seemed to like it. Next time I might add brown sugar and raisons. Maybe less oil. Cream cheese frosting is a nice touch.
