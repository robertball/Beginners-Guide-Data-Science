Frozen solid when it came out of the freezer, but it softened pretty quickly sitting at room temperature.  I like all of these flavors, but it was just a little too sweet for me, so I'd cut back on the sugar the next time.

I made this for a brunch dessert yesterday and it was fabulous.  I might have gone a little heavy on the fresh ginger but we all loved it.  Served it with fresh strawberries and mango slices on the side and mint sprigs on top.  Grogeous and delicious! Thank you.

I live in mango country (in West Africa), and made this today from windfall mangoes, soft from their fall in a windstorm, and blended, rather than using mango juice. It is delicious! I have lime juice available, not lemon juice, so used that. And I don't have lime zest, but it wasn't needed. The flavor is rich and the texture great.
