I am the submitter and I wanted to give a few important tips here.....cover tightly or wrap the brisket tightly with foil and do not be tempted to check the status during the long braise.  You will lose too much steam and your brisket will dry out.There is very little water in this recipe because corned beef briskets are brined and have soaked in alot of water which will release during the cooking process. I cook a smaller brisket for at least five hours with the same terrific results. Another tip for those who find their brisket salty. Corned beef briskets are brined in salt water by the meat producers. The brining can vary depending on the salt solution and the length of time the brisket sits in the brine.  I have been fortunate to not find a too salty corned beef, but to be safe, you could soak the brisket in fresh water (refrigerated) for a couple days to extract some of that salt. Finally, for those who question the term braise and the small amount of liquid here......https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/braise  I hope you enjoy this as much as we do. Luck o' the Irish to you!

Awesome recipe - Easy and so delicious! Thank you Mauigirl. This is a keeper for sure. After searing I placed the corned beef on a rack above the little bit of water - followed the instructions as stated - the wonderful aroma of this braising was not to be believed. I offered to set some aside for my daughter to take home to her corned beef hating husband and he absolutely loved it. I will have to make more tomorrow. Thank you! UPDATE I made this again last night. I got a really nice flat cut corned beef at Costco - very lean. I used about a tablespoon of the browning sauce. I triple wrapped the corned beef in heavy aluminium foil on a baking sheet. It cooked for about 5 hours at 275. We ate some for dinner and then I used a slicer to thin slice the rest for sandwiches. Perfection!

Out o' Sight brisket recipe, Jules! I copycatted your menu exactly and oh what a treat! Like Baking Nana, I bought my flat cut brisket at Costco, followed your directions to a "T" with one tiny addition of more sliced garlic and onion just because onions and garlic are in their own food group at Cathy Myers' house! Flavorful, fork tender - the very best we've ever had! I will NEVER return to yukky boiled meat again! I found myself cutting off  chunks of the leftovers for a protein snack! Couldn't help myself! Randy got his Reuban sammie fix that's for certain! Thanks again for sharing, Julie!

Very delish recipe. I've never made a corned beef with this technique before. And it turned out soo well. I followed threw with braising and then utlizing my crockpot to bake in, only for the simple fact, I needed to bake other things at a higher temp then this recipe in my oven and didn't want to complicate matters. The crockpot worked out very well. The only thing I did slightly different and it wasn't really much. After braising the meat in the pan on the cooktop, I took the water and deglazed the pan and then added that deglazed mixture to the crock pot over the corned beef and followed threw with the rest of the directions. Added a head of cabbage during the last hour and a half, it was very flavorful. My beef was extra tender and was falling apart ;-) Will make again.

OMG 10 stars! The best corned beef I have ever made. My husband who has had ALOT of corned beef in his life said it was hands down the best he ever had. My brisket was 3.25lbs and it was fork tender after 5 hours cooking. I love how it looked after browning it. I just used lots of pepper instead of the browning sauce. I cooked it fat side up and scraped the fat layer off and let it rest for about an hour before slicing. Still was piping hot. I put the slices back in the juices and served with my version of colcannon. Hubby said it was the best dinner he had in a long time. Thank you so much mauigirl for sharing this fabulous recipe. I don't understand the reviews that still prefer the boiling method. I can't wait for ruebens tomorrow!

We sat down to eat, my husband took a bite and said "yummmmm". Then he looked at me and asked "corned beef isn't usually this tender, or tasty". He didn't even put mustard on it! Simple very tasty way to cook corned beef. I made a colcannon with saute cabbage as the side. I didn't have any kitchen bouquet, so I just lightly peppered it. I have another corned beef in the fridge, this is how I will cook corned beef from now on. Thanks for sharing.

I added about a half cup of water to the pan before sealing tightly. After cooking, I removed corned beef and added several red potatoes, sliced in half to the pan drippings, covered with the foil and cooked until tender, about 45:minutes.  I sauteed my cabbage in butter and a little water until tender, then added the potatoes and drippings to the cabbage  and served with the corned beef.  Best corned beef and cabbage I ever cooked!  I was amazed how lean and tender the corned beef was.

This is a wonderful method for corned beef. I cooked the corned beef the day before then crusted it with dijon mustard & Brown sugar and put it back in the low oven just to warm it through and set the crust. It was perfection. Thank you for sharing.

I rinsed and patted dry the flat cut corned beef brisket and coated it in Kitchen Bouquet, browned on both sides for 5 minutes each side.  I laid a sheet of heavy duty foil out flat and then placed another sheet crosswise.  I laid the browned brisket on top and added the onion, garlic, and 2 T. of water on the fat side. Making sure to keep the fat side facing upwards,  I closed the foil tightly and placed another piece of foil over the top of the brisket.  I placed on the rack of my preheated roaster oven and roasted for 6 hours.  Did not peek, turned oven off and allowed the corned beef brisket to sit for 30 minutes. Lifted the rack out - not a drop of the broth leaked out.  Delicious, moist and fork tender.  Loved it and very deserving of 5 stars.  I will never ever buy deli corned beef again!  Thank you, Mauigirl for sharing this keeper!

Hands down, THE BEST corned beef that I have ever made or eaten, and everyone agreed! I have to Thanks Baking Nana for her help on the Buzz, letting me know how to make this in an electric roaster...After searing the beef, I put it into a triple layer of heavy duty foil, topped it w/ the onions and garlic slices, and wrapped it tightly. I placed it on the rack in the roaster and cooked it for 6 hours on 250 degrees....moist, tender perfection! Even the corned beef haters raved over this! I was hoping to have enough leftovers for dinner tonight, but it was all gone :( This is definitely a 10+ star recipe! This will be the only way I will ever prepare a corned beef brisket again. Mauigirl, Thank You so much for sharing this WONDERFUL recipe, and again, Baking Nana for all your cooking help...I was a rock star w/ this recipe~YUM!

Made two corned beef roasts for a family dinner - one traditional boiled, and this one.  Everyone preferred the taste of the traditionally cooked beef, and this one was a little dry - even though I watched and checked it regularly while cooking.  I agree with another reviewer that 2-3 tablespoons is too little water for "braising".

We absolutely loved this! I used my Dutch Oven from Food Network and didn't use a rack, or wrap the beef or pan in foil. It's a great pan with a snug fitting lid. I followed the recipe as Mauigirl submitted it. I cleaned and cut cabbage, potatoes and carrots before the corned beef was done. As soon as the meat was done, I wrapped it in heavy duty foil and set it aside. I added about 2-3 cups of water and the spice package to the juices in the pan. I added chopped carrots and  cabbage wedges. Then a few minutes later, I added potato halves. I cooked them all on top of the stove. When the vegetables were almost done, I used my bread knife and thinly sliced the corned beef and the meat was so tender, it was like slicing bread. The flavoring from the packet worked well on the vegetables. The meat was still hot when I unwrapped it. I read one complaint about a reviewers meat being dry and crispy on the outside. Although my beef was a rich deep brown, it was as tender as can be. I think the Kitchen Bouquet is an absolute must. With a snug fitting lid, I couldn't see wrapping the meat in foil as others did. My search for the perfect corned beef is over. Thank you Ms Maui!

Awesome! I used a little brown sugar, worcestershire, and apple cider vinegar as browning sauce. Garlic powder on the roast before browning, topped with onions, on a sheet pan with foil covering. Only cooked about 4 hours, turned out scrumptious! Thanks Mauigirl!

I too added 1/2 can of beer to the bottom of the pan with the spice packet and did the glaze w/ mustard and brown sugar.  So much better than the boiling method.  Though very popular in the USA, you won't find corned beef on the menu in Ireland St Paddy's day.  Not a traditional dish for them.  Who knew?

So delicious; the meat was incredibly tender and tasty!  The smell wafted through the house and tempted us for hours. I will never boil corned beef again.  I followed the recipe exactly...even the 2 tablespoons water which doesn't seem like it's enough, but it is.  Thanks for the recipe.

I am always looking for another way to cook corned beef without boiling, but had never found anything that worked without drying it out.  This, however, was wonderful.  A couple of changes, but only because of my available ingredients:  my roast was smaller, so I cooked it for less time (4 hours); I didn't have Kitchen Bouquet, so used nothing; I didn't have fresh garlic, so spread a small amount of minced garlic (from a jar) over the top.  Even without the Kitchen Bouquet, this was very tasty and very tender.  My husband asked that I cook it this way from now on.  My only concern was how to cook the cabbage, carrots, and potatoes, since there was no boiling water.  So what I did was to wrap the corned beef in foil (after it was done with the braising) and put it in the warming oven.  I then prepared the veggies, put them on the rack that had held the corned beef in the roaster pan, added some more water to the bottom of the pan, put the lid on and baked/braised them at 400 degrees for about an hour.  They were really flavorful from the steaming with the beef juices. Excellent!

Tried this with an extra corned beef brisket (I buy loads to freeze when they're on sale for St. Paddy's Day) because I was curious how baking the corned beef would turn out.  All I can say is that I'm glad I only used one brisket.  First, "braised" means it is cooked in a small amount of liquid but 2 tablespoons of water for a 5-lb brisket doesn't begin to qualify as braising--the ratio is just too far off.  I regularly make braised short ribs and every recipe I've ever seen or used calls for 2-3 cups of water for 5 lbs of meat.  In addition, none of us liked the flavour imparted by browning the brisket and it wasn't nearly as tender and tasty as the recipe I've been using for years (Slow Cooked Corned Beef for Sandwiches).  Sorry, but I'll continue to keep that one as my never-fail corned beef recipe.

Fair warning: this does NOT work with home-cured brisket. While the flavor is good and the browning is a nice, tasty addition- it was horribly dry. I should have realized this would be the result since the mass-produced corned beef is up to 50% added water. There simply wasn't enough moisture or fat on my brisket to keep it succulent. I am looking forward to trying this method with a store - bought brisket. I'm sure it will be delicious.

Tough corned beef is NOT GOOD.  I followed the recipe exactly even when it didn't look like enought water and I even went out and bought the browning sauce especially for this recipe.  I timed it as the recipe said and ended up with a dry, tough piece of beef instead of the moist and delicious corned beef I have made in the past. I am just glad I bought extra corned beef on sale and we got to have a good meal the next day.

I made this recipe last night and followed the instruction exactly and planned to serve it for dinner tonight.  My hubby just sampled it and asked me to make something else for dinner (and this is the man who L-O-V-E-S his corned beef).  He asked me why I didn't make it the way I have the last few years and all I could tell him is this one got lots of great reviews so I wanted to try it.  It is tough and salty and just isn't what I am used to.  I wanted a recipe that makes tender moist corned beef and this just isn't the one.

Wow!  I will never boil again.  I had been looking for a crock pot recipe when I stumbled on this recipe, and thought I would try something new.  I kept reading the recipe over again because it seemed too simple.  After browning with the Kitchen Bouquet, I deglazed the pan with about 1/2 can of beer I had in the fridge from another recipe.  I wrapped the brisket in foil, leaving a small  opening in the top to vent. I poured some of the juices over the onion and garlic topped fat side; and poured the rest over a pan of raw carrots for later baking.  I then loosely wrapped another piece of foil over the top of the brisket.   Baked at 250 for 5 hours, putting the carrots in for the last hour.  It smelled delicious baking and the beef sliced up tender and juicy after resting for about 10 minutes.
I made Diane's Colcannon (without the cabbage, didn't have on hand) as a perfect side to this dish.

This recipe is absolutely wonderful. So much better than steamed or boiled brisket. A must try. Easy clean up. I do carrots, potato's in foil 1-1.5 hours prior to brisket being done.

I love corned beef ‘n cabbage.   My husband, not so much.  He doesn’t care for the spices in the seasoning packet.  When I saw this recipe, I knew we could reach a happy compromise.   This recipe is absolutely perfect!  The meat was so tender and juicy that you could cut it with a fork.  The flavor was out of this world!   You can do anything with this like Reuben sandwiches or use in other recipes that call for corned beef.  That ‘s if you are lucky enough to have leftovers.  Since I love corned beef ‘n cabbage,  I cooked the cabbage in the drippings from the roasting pan and added the sliced corned beef.  This was much better than the traditional cooking methods.   Thank you, mauigirl!

I've been boiling corned beef for decades! Never again!! This was by far the best corned beef I've had. I didn't have kitchen bouquet but I don't think it was needed. I also did not throw out the spice pack but put it in a large dutch oven with all the veggies and that gave my veggies a good flavor. I use onion, carrots, pototoes and rudabagga-may not have spelled that correctly and of course cabbage. For those of you that have never tried rudabagga now is a good time to taste it, I personally think it tastes like a cross between a potato and a carrot. Let me know what you think.

Very good! I usually cook mine in the crock-pot & I really like that to along with red potatoes, carrots, onions & cabbage. With this recipe I add the vegetables in the last 2hrs of cooking, then I removed the meat and took out the rack so that the vegetables could cook in the broth for another half hour which gives them lots of flavor. I also cut quite a bit of fat off before searing. Would make again!

Supper yummy! I'm not a fan if corned beef but after reading reviews and hearing folks rave in the buzz, I decided to make this for St. Patricks day. Do glad u did! I rinsed my roast, dried, and painted in the bouquet, then browned per instructions. I took Baking Nana's suggestion and wrapped in foil a few times. Mine leaked so I was glad I had it on a tray. I smelled burning, but didn't realize it had leaked so I stopped cooking at four hours thinking it was burnt. Let sit in oven after turning it off for about an hour and holy smokes was it good! DELICIOUS! I guess I can't say I don't like corned beef anymore. Thank you Mauigirl! Fantastic!

I made this recipe recently.  I love slow cooking corned beef instead of boiling.  I roasted this in my roaster at 250 degrees.  This was delicious.  Thanks Mauigirl!   UPDATE:  I baked a 2.5 pound brisket for about 3 hours until the internal temp was 210 degrees and it came out perfectly.

Very delicious recipe! I have always fixed corned beef in the "traditional" way and (for me) it always felt as if it needed something extra. I used this recipe, for the first time, on New Year's Day 2014 and right now have another one in the oven. My family loved the flavor and texture of this "newer" recipe. After reading other reviews, I was hesitant the first time I fixed it and nervous that it would be dry - it was wonderful! I have to say I do not side in with any critics against this recipe. It is my #1 favorite corned beef recipe!

Sorry, but this is dry dry dry meat.  Take a look at the photos and you can see how dry it turns out.  I wish I would of checked them before I tried this recipe.  Baking it just intensifies the saltiness so it is way saltier than your deli corned beef.  I tried it because of the high rating but I don't know how it rates that high.

This is a great meal and recipe, my only criticism is about browning the meat before you put it in the oven. I did that and it came out crispy. Good if you like crispy but this is not usually eaten with a crispy outside. Next time I am not going to brown the meat before the oven.

mauigirl - this is the BEST corned beef that I have ever prepared!  It was so moist and tender and the flavor was incredible.  I sliced and froze the leftovers, and have 2 more corned beefs in the freezer to make this again.  I served it with 'Cream Cheese Colcannon' 'Buttermilk Slaw' and 'Irresistible Irish Soda Bread' all AR recipes.  Everything was delicious, but the meat stole the show.  Thanks for submitting your method.

I now understand why this recipe is rated 5 stars…yes, it's that good.  I haven't made corned beef in several years, but we had the taste for it (well, my husband ALWAYS has the taste for it).  I bought a very lean flat 2 lb corned beef at Costco and followed the suggestions of some of the reviewers.   I doubled wrapped in heavy duty foil, put it in a baking pan, cooked for about 5 hours, and there was no pan to clean.  It was fork tender, moist, and its presentation was very nice.  Had enough left over to make a nice corned beef hash, and I know that will be delicious, too.  No more boiling corned beef, braising now is my go-to method.

Jumping on the band wagon to say this is the BEST corned beef I’ve ever had. Now I have to admit that I tweaked the recipe a bit—but that’s in my nature. I just about doubled the garlic and onions because my family loves them. I also sautéed the garlic and onion in the pan I braised the corn beef in. I then deglazed the pan with apple juice and used that as my liquid instead of water. I cooked for 5.5 hours then pulled it out of the oven and let it sit for about 45min. This stuff tastes even better the next day!! I will definitely make this more often! I would suggest making this the day before you need it, or put it in the oven first thing in the morning if you will need your oven for other things. Also don’t peek at the corned beef while it’s cooking, you don’t want to risk drying it out.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE, I DIDN'T HAVE ANY BROWNING SAUCE SO I COVERED IT IN HONEY MUSTARD AND ADDED PEPPER AS OTHERS SUGGESTED, DOUBLE WRAPPED IN HEAVY DUTY FOIL WITH THE GARLIC AND ONIONS, MY DAUGHTER STARTED PICKING OFF OF IT BEFORE IT WAS EVEN SERVED.  THANKS FOR THE RECIPE.

This recipe is to die for!  It is one of my husband's favorite dinners.  I was skeptical, as I didn't really care for corned beef (too salty, and I like salt).  However, after I made this, I am in love!  I follow the recipe as written, only I add a little more water (maybe 1/2 cup) to keep the drippings from burning.  I steamed cabbage in some chicken broth to have on the side.  Every year around, or just after, St. Patrick's day, we stock up on the corned beef that is on sale in the store and freeze it.  I made this with a brisket that had been in the freezer for a year and it was still delicious!  Give this a try!

STOP THE PRESSES!  This dish is now one of my go-to dinner meals.  Thank you mauigirl!

There is NOTHING to change about this recipe.  I did as is and it was delicious.  I had a smaller roast and it was almost gone.  I had a gigantic smile when my kids were asking for seconds.  It was fantastic for nice sandwich lunches using the leftovers.

So to recap:
•	Yes, brown the brisket.  It creates a nice bark
•	Yes, only two tablespoons of water.  You will be floored how much liquid gets generated
•	Yes, tent the whole thing; that is the roast sitting on a rack in the roasting pan all wrapped in foil
•	USE A MEAT THERMOMETER.  My roast only took 3 hours to get to 170 internal temperature and it was moist and juicy
•	DO LET YOUR ROAST REST.  Take the roast out of the oven and let it rest wrapped in the foil for 45 minutes to keep its internal juices.
•	That roasting pan will be a treasure-trove of delicious juices.  Your imagination as to what veggies you can roast/cook in the liquid is all up to you

By far, the best recipe I've found for corned beef. Personally, I prefer to use a point cut brisket over a flat because it has more fat and gives the Browning sauce more to work with.  I also make my own browning sauce (food.com has an easy recipe that works great) instead of using Kitchen Bouquet.  This recipe has become a family favorite at our house.  It's delicious.

I followed this recipe exactly.  This was the best corned beef I have ever cooked; no more boiled beef for us. When my husband says "this is really good" after a few bites then I know I've got a keeper.  The juice tasted really good too.  Next time I'll try cooking the cabbage in this juice.   Everyone should try this recipe!

5 Star Love It! Fabulous recipe and cooking method that baked in so so much flavor that is hard to believe from so few ingredients. My brisket was 2.5 pounds but I still used a whole medium onion and 4 good size cloves of garlic. I couldn't wait for this to come out of the oven it smelled so good and when it did I must have "tasted" 1/2 pound, I couldn't stop picking at it. Looking very forward to sandwiches with the leftovers. Thanks mauigirl for also sharing your helpful hint to bake it fat side up and when it's done baking to simply scrape the fat away. Love, love, loved it!!

Made this for St Patrick's day dinner and everyone LOVED it.  Only alteration I made to the recipe is I used 1/2 bottle of beer in the pan instead of water.  As we were cleaning up my brother tasted the drippings and said "OMG that is off the hook."  Lets just say I will be serving the drippings next time.

Wow! This came out really good. I was a little skepticle ..but I followed the recipe and I must say this is a new way for me to cook corned beef. I had to use my cast iron grill pan and it worked like a charm. Mauigirl thanks for the recipe...great job!

Made this tonight and it was wonderful.  I totally wrapped the brisket in aluminum foil and baked it at 275 degrees (5.75 lb) for 6 hours.  I put it on a rack in a roasting pan and covered the pan with foil also.  I added a little water and  balsamic vinegar to the pan and cooked the potatoes, carrots and cabbage in the pan with the meat (about 1.5 hours).  I removed the veges to a separate pan and just kept them warm so they would not overcook.  Everyone raved about how tender the meat was.  This is how I will cook it from now on.  I did not have browning sauce so I just browned the brisket in hot olive oil and then peppered it before wrapping.  Thank you for a great recipe.

BEST CORNED BEEF recipe EVER! We have tried year after year to make the perfect Jiggs dinner, but the recipe we tried always left us sighing...maybe next time.
We followed the recipe searing the 3 lb. brisket with Andria's Steak Sauce. Added extra onions and garlic on top and underneath. Used two tablespoons of water and sealed tightly in two layers of heavy duty foil and cooked for five hours at 270 degrees.  The brisket was so tender it broke in half when it was removed from the foil. The juice was amazing which we poured over the brisket. We made the veggies in a separate pot seasoned with the packet from the brisket and someadded spices. 
YUM! Will never make corned beef any other way. This recipe is a keeper. Thanks Mauigirl!

Oh my goodness this was outstanding! My partner of 14 years, usually cooks corn beef, potatoes and carrots in the slow cooker every St. Patrick's Day as part of her Irish heritage. While this her tradition, it isn't usually my favorite meal. The potatoes are okay, but I usually don't like the chewy and stringy corned beef.

This year she had to work and I decided to see if I could find a better way to cook the meat. I found this recipe, made it with Worcestershire sauce instead of browning sauce. I put in a quarter cup bit of red wine , and quarter cup of water in the bottom of my Correlle stoneware dutch oven and put on the lid.

I had a smaller cut of meat, about 3 pounds, and a little more time before we could eat dinner, so I cooked it at a lower temperature 250F, and it was done in in 3-1/2 hours, there was about 2 inches of liquid - more than the water or wine I added. After this I turned the oven down to 170F (the lowest setting) and let it sit in the oven for another 2 hours while I ran some errands.

When I got home I there was still a couple inches of liquid, but I was worried the inside had dried out. When my knife touched the meat it fell apart easily because it was so tender and moist. Then I tasted it and oh my . . . it was melt in your mouth delicious! Even my finicky five-year-old who doesn't like meat all that much and eats like a little bird, cleaned her plate.

My partner wants me to cook corned beef this way from now on.

I would have never thought to do a corned beef this way. But after seeing this recipe, I had to try it. After searing the brisket on both sides with the browning sauce, I removed from the heat and coated again with more browning sauce, then covered the top of the brisket with the chopped onions and chopped garlic. I then used a cookie sheet lined with foil, added a little water at the bottom of the sheet put the brisket on there, and spread remaining chopped onions and garlic around the brisket. I then covered with foil and put in the oven. 6 hours, 45 minutes later I took it out. The onions and garlic caramelized and the brisket was so tender, I could pull it apart with a fork and was absolutely delicious. I WILL NEVER EVER COOK THIS ANY OTHER WAY. Thank you for this delicious recipe!!

I saw other reviews state they would never boil a brisket again. I too am of that mind. I used the recipe as a guideline. I had 3 2.5 lb briskets so I cooked at 235F for 6 hrs...perfection. The whole family loved it. I've never had a brisket this tender and juicy.

I made this tonight along with a brisket done the traditional way.  While both were very good I think the braised brisket beat out the boiled one.  It had a much more beefey taste.  To seal the pot I used a roaster with a piece of tinfoil on top then placed the lid on.  The tinfoil acted like a gasket making a tight seal.  I never peeked and cooked it for 5 hours.  Also I added about 3/4 cup water.  Will definitely do this again.

We both loved this so much!  I triple wrapped and placed the brisket on a rack but instead of water I used a bottle of beer. Served with Diane's Colcannon by DianeF.  Thank you for such a great recipe mauigirl! Will definitely have this again and again.

Yummy!! I will never go back to cooking corned beef in water.  This was wonderful.  I made this and used it to make Deluxe Corned Beef Hash on this site.  We ate every bit of it.

I will not be ordering from the Kosher Deli any longer!  My house smelled wonderful all afternoon and we were not disappointed when we sat down to eat.  This was the first time I ever cooked corned beef without the cabbage and potatoes.  My MIL cooked her briskest this way, but even she never did it with corned beef.  Thanks, Julie, this is a keeper!

I will never boil my corned beef again!  Made this recipe for St. Patty's day this year, and it is now THE corned beef recipe in my St. Patrick's Day Menu! We had our friends over, and everyone loved it.  I got a late start getting this into the oven (I had two briskets on a half sheet pan), and was a little worried that it wouldn't be done in time.  I put the oven on 300 instead of 275 because of this.  I put it in at 3:30 p.m., and by 7:00, it was nice and tender (only 3-1/2 hours).  The only bad thing I can say about this, is that we didn't have any leftovers for reuben sandwiches!

Absolutely delicious! The only thing I changed was to use the onion and garlic along with a chunked up carrot as the rack for the meat rather than use a regular metal rack. I will never boil/simmer a corned beef again!
NILELU - Colcannon is basically Irish mashed potatoes. You add thinly shredded, sauteed cabbage, scallions and leftover bacon or ham to VERY buttery mashed potatoes. Serve it with an extra pat of butter on top and you've got delicious, albeit not all that healthy, Irish potatoes. Hope that helps!

I traditionally make corned beef for St. Patrick's Day and tried this recipe this year. My partner and I agreed this the best corned beef we have ever made! I used 3 tablespoons of water total and used a cast iron dutch oven with lid for a single pot meal. I included the packet of spices sprinkled on top of the meat. With about an hour left of cooking, I added baby carrots to the pot. We did not find this dry at all, instead it was fall apart tender and so so good!

I made this using a 2.32 lb corned beef brisket. Followed the directions exactly as stated other than reducing the cooking time.  I cooked mine for 3 hrs. due to the smaller size  PERFECT!
Super super moist.  I cooked mine in a dutch oven and placed a layer of foil underneath the lid.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

This was the absolute best corned beef I've ever had! I usually pass when invited to a dinner where this will be served or only take a tiny bit if it's served and I didn't know but I had seconds of this recipe! The amount of cooking time is perfect for my schedule as well. I roasted cabbage, carrots, onions and Brussels sprouts tossed in olive oil and seasoned with just salt and pepper on a sheet pan to go with it and even our picky kid wanted more! Thanks so much for this recipe!

I cooked 18 of these yesterday for a Saint Paddy’s party last night.  Every morsel was quickly eaten, and everybody loved it!  Here’s how I did it:  I seared the briskets three at a time on a grate over a wood fire.  Then I put the briskets in an aluminum roasting pan (3 per pan), smothered each with sliced garlic and red onion, added 1/2 cup of water, and double wrapped each pan with heavy duty foil.  I braised 6 pans on a pull-behind cooker, trying to keep the temperature between 275-350.  After 5 hours, internal temperature was 150-160, so I took them off the heat and put the still-sealed pans in coolers until serving time.  This is a “best I ever had do-again meal!”

Nom! This was fantastic. I made this yesterday for St Paddys day . Husband loved it, but even more surprising was my picky 11 year old did too. I used a 2.75 lb Costco Kobe style corned beef, a 2 inch deep disposable aluminum pan, and covered the pan in a few layers of tin foil, wrapped tight around the edges for a good seal. Because the piece of meat was under 3 lbs, I cooked it for 4 hours, and turned the pan around once for even cooking, but didn't take off the foil. -I probably could have cooked it for a little less time, but it came out fall-apart tender and wonderful. I will exclusively use this corned beef recipe moving forward.

This was fantastic.  I followed the recipe exactly, but cut back on the roasting time because it was a smaller piece of meat.  I went out and bought a roasting pan just for this recipe, and wow was it worth it.  Yummie!

Stop the press!  This is one amazing recipe.  I followed it exactly except I added 3 Tbsps of water instead of the recommended 2.  It certainly did not need it.  I covered the corned beef brisket over the roasting pan with 2 layers of heavy duty aluminum foil and made sure there were no openings where steam could escape.  The result was an amazingly tasty and moist brisket with at least 2 cups of gravy left over at the bottom of the pan.  The brisket itself has a significant amount of water inside of it and as long as you cover it during cooking, the liquid will not evaporate and will turn into gravy (about 2 cups worth).  I will make this again however, next time, I may decide to soak the brisket in water for a day or so in order to reduce the salt content.  You cannot go wrong with this recipe.  Don't listen to the people who wrote about a dried out  / hard brisket.  They obviously didn't cover it properly during cooking.  Enjoy!

The only way to make corn beef brisket, had almost given up trying. After multiple attempts in a slow cooker which always yielded moist but chewy corned beef, I finally found this recipe.
  Be sure to do as other reviewers have suggested add the little bit of water then wrap entire corned beef with heavy aluminum foil and seal edges tight. Comes out moist and melt in your mouth tender. Thank you, Mauigirl.
   UPDATE:  Do NOT PEEK or check during cooking use a meat thermometer if necessary. One reviewer gave this three stars after saying it was dried out " even though I watched and checked it regularly while cooking" It will dry out if you let the steam out!

I don't review often, but I absolutely had to with this recipe!  I make corned beef quite often, and learned from my mother, to always do the boil method.  I have tried using some other baked method, but decided to try this one.  It simply the best corned beef.  There is no other way to get the infusion of the garlic and onion in the beef than this slow  and low method.  I made it exactly the same as the recipe,  including using a roasting pan for a 5 lb corned beef and I convection roasted it for 6 hours exactly.  It was perfect.  The browning method is really key.  Use the browning sauce, whatever it does, its amazing.  Throw away the packet and never use it again!
This is a keeper and my corned beef eating husband and teenage boys agreed!

Thought i'd try something different. Hubby doesn't care for corned beef. Mom gave me a 3.5# and when I told her I decided to try this recipe she poo-pooed it on all levels: "it will be too salty; it will be tough; a waste of gas cooking so long (I have electric ovens Mom!) and on and on she went. So I Followed recipe exactly, didn't peek for 4 hrs. then turned off the oven and let it sit there while I shopped for my reuben fixin's. Came home to the smell of wonderful! This was so moist and flavorful hubby couldn't stop picking at it while I made sandwiches. He said never boil again! It was fantastic, moist with beautiful deep dark bark. Can't wait to see my mom EAT CROW! Thanks for opening minds! Boiled meat out, braised meat IN. Mom WRONG, me RIGHT ON!

This recipe made the best corned beef sandwiches ever!  I only made 2 little changes: an extra tablespoon of water because we live at higher elevation and I wanted to be sure it would be OK, and I twisted the peppergrinder over the brisket a few times before adding the onions and garlic.  I used my dutch oven because I figured the lid would help keep the foil down tightly.  Thanks MauiGirl, this is a "must-try -> keeper" recipe!

Way too salty! When you boil it, the salt used in the "corning" process leaches out into the water. Baking it just intensifies the salt. This was inedible. (I followed the recipe exactly.)

I've been trying for years but have never been able to make a great brisket. I liked how simple this was, so I thought I'd give it a try in the pressure cooker. I sauteed onions and garlic, then seared both sides of the brisket. I poured in about 1/8 cup of cider vinegar to keep it moist and help break it down and then added the spice packet. To make it a meal I added 1/2 small head of cabbage, 4 red potatoes and 1/2 pack of baby carrots. It was cooked on high pressure for 55 minutes, and it came out fantastic. Thanks for sharing! I hope this helps anyone looking for a shortcut method.

I've made it this way several times and again today for Saint Patrick's day. It's so good!! Save the spice packet from the corned beef and throw it in with the water you use to cook the potatoes, cabbage and carrots.

I found this recipe on line when I accidentally picked up a corned beef brisket vs. a regular beef brisket.  I had never cooked corned beef brisket before.  I made this exactly as specified although I did take the advice of one reviewer and added my water to the pan after browning the roast to get all the good juices and spices.  Then poured this over the roast (fat side up)--sprinkled generously with black pepper and sliced up the garlic and onions.  It turned out GREAT.  DELICIOUS!  Thanks for sharing!

I made this for St.Patty's Day. I was a huge hit, I will never boil corned beef again. I have to double the recipe so there are enough leftovers to make my husband happy.

This was really delicious. I used brown ale instead of water, about half a bottle of Newcastle. I also took a lazy shortcut and used jarred minced garlic, I didn't measure, I just smeared it all of the 'fat cap' after browning in Kitchen Bouquet. I covered the bottom of my foil pan with quartered onions instead of using a rack. Next time I will rinse the brisket first, it was a little too salty. It was really really good, this is a keeper!

The only reason I'm rating this 4 stars is that a 5 lb roast was not fully tender in the 6+ hr time range - the thinner parts were perfect but the thicker ones were still a bit tough.  Cooked another hour to hour and a half and was perfect.  Like many others I used beer instead of water and highly recommend that as well as fully rinsing and drying the corned beef before browning.  No need to use browning sauce if the roast is browned properly.  Served with Diane's Colcannon and had a wonderful meal. Update:  We had this yesterday and it was definitely a 5 star meal!  This time I had a mostly uniform piece of corned beef, double wrapped it in al foil and the 6 hour cook time with a rest of 45 minutes (waiting for people to arrive) resulted in the best corned beef I have ever prepared. This will definitely be our go to recipe.

OMG just made this and this is the BEST corned beef I've ever made or eaten!! My husband loved it too!!. I used bacon fat, not vegetable oil. My roast was only 3.5 lbs so I adjusted cooking time. 2.5 hrs on 275, then 200 for 1 hour, then 170 for 1 hour, then off for last 30 minutes. Total 5 hours. LOVED IT. THANK YOU!!! I plan on using this recipe for all kinds of roasts!!

My husband and I loved this recipe, I did make it in the crock pot. My question now is, when I went to make it a second time, I didn't realize that I purchased a "point" brisket. Can I use it the same way?

I must agree this was the best corn beef I have ever tasted!  I did take some advise and added Dijon mustard & honey mixture to the top after it was cooked.  It was a HIT this St Paddy's day.

My sister wants to rename this "Effing Delicious Corn Beef". Based on the picture I posted, you can tell it was "tasted" a few times before it made it to the table. Sadly, I didn't make this, my mom did. The only changes she made to it was with the water and oil (water pushed to 1/4 C and oil was about 4 T). Very amazed, I didn't think I liked corn beef due to rubbery boiling, but I inhaled this. Sooo good. (Mom also said it got a little browner than she wanted)

Made this last night!! Delish!!!  I normally boil my corned beef but will never do that again!!  Our friends loved it too and asked for the recipe!  Followed the recipe to a T.   I also boiled cabbage, red skin potatoes, carrots, onions, and a couple slices of bacon cut up in some chicken broth to go along with it.  Also very good!!

This method was fool-proof. I used to boil my Brisket, but now I am never going to do it that way. My adult son told me about braising in a low temp oven, and WOW, what a difference!

Followed the recipe to a T. Delicious ! The only thing I did different was cook it in a crockpot. And I don’t think that changes anything. Very simple and easy recipe and very tasty.  My girls loved it and want me to make it again and I will it’s awesome. Good job Mauigirl

WOW!  If I could rate this higher I would.  The best I've ever had.    Never boil again.  Had a 3.20 corned beef and baked 5 hrs.  Made no changes.  Will definitely do again.  Thank you Thank you.

Welp.  I have a new way to cook corned beef!  This method was absolutely delicious!  I'll admit, I was skeptical of adding only 2 tablespoons of water, but it turned out great - juicy and tender.  I've already printed it off and put it in my "keeper" file!

I made this for dinner tonite, OMG was it ever delicious!  Melt in your mouth and the flavor was amazing! I used a 3 lb piece of corned beef instead of 5 lb so it was done in 5 hrs.   I will never cook corned beef in a pot of water again!! Thank you for the recipe!

I've eaten boiled corned beef all my life because that's the way I was raised so I was a bit skeptical about making it in the oven.  Let me tell you that I'll never boil another corned beef again.  It was so moist and flavorful I couldn't bevieve it.

This was hands down the best corned beef I’ve ever eaten. I didn’t have any browning sauce so I just “browned” in oil in my cast iron Dutch oven, added the onion and garlic and then added water. I did add 1/4 of water and I’m glad I did. When I removed from the oven, no liquid was left but there were some nicely carmalized onions at the bottom. I scraped the remaining onion and garlic off the meat into the bottom of the pan and then added that to the sauerkraut cooking in another pan. Made it really rich tasting. Than you so much for this. I will never make corned beef any other way!

Boy howdy!!!! This recipe was spectacular! I’m never making it in the crockpot again. I followed this recipe exactly (my beef was almost 4lbs and came from Costco so I cooked it for 5h 15m) and used the suggestions made by MarySunshine1 becs I too used my Dutch oven. Once the beef was done, I took it out and wrapped it in heavy duty foil and set it aside while I added my chopped cabbage, carrots + quartered potatoes to my Dutch with 2 cups of water with the seasoning packet that came in the corned beef, and cooked it all on top of the stove until the potatoes and carrots were done. It came out amazing and my family loved it! This is definitely a keeper for sure!

Changed nothing to the recipe except made two briskets instead of one  for St Patrick’s day celebration. My guests loved it! Served with Debbie’s colcannon, scotch eggs and Dublin coddle, and enough beer to drown a leprechaun!

Wow! After decades of being disappointed with the texture and flavor of traditional boiled corned beef, I tried this. Perfection!! Beautiful color, tender without crumbling, and great flavor, unadulterated by that god forsaken pickling spice. Thank you—I’m a convert to this braising method now!

Made one boiled and one braised. The braised one was gone before I was able try it. Next time I will play the role of the guest and not the host so I’m first in line. Must have been good.

OMG... this method is AMAZING!  I've made it several times and I think I've since perfected it to my taste. First of all, I use a browning sauce - liquid smoke mixture (about 2 tsp of each). I use olive oil instead of vegetable to sear the brisket. I put the meat on a rack in the roaster to keep it off the bottom  (my turkey roaster is perfect as I always make a large brisket to have leftovers or to entertain). I use the seasonings - I don't throw them out. I simply sprinkle them on top of the fat-side of the brisket as I traditionally would. After browning the meat, I add the onions and garlic  to the browning drippings left just to coat them in it before topping the brisket with them. Then instead of water, I add an entire can of a dark beer (Perrin Black is my go-to) to my roaster. I use my roaster lid instead of aluminum foil leaving the vents closed and roast until brisket temp reached 120 degrees. It is tender as can be with mouth-watering flavor!

I loved this! Just an FYI I didn't buy browning sauce but used a sprinkling of Worcestershire sauce and brown sugar and it turned out marvelous. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I've tried so many recipes for corned beef and cabbage, mostly boiled, and this is by far the best.   I won't make it any other way.  I didn't have the  sauce, just used pepper as others did.  It was so flavorful and tender, blown away.

This was EXCELLENT! I just moved and couldn’t find my pan and rack, so I just wrapped it up tightly in foil and baked it with the onions and garlic. About an hour before it was done I put cut up potatoes and carrots, tossed in olive oil with a packet of Lipton onion soup mix on the bottom rack and let them roast for the last hour, turning them once. I let the roast rest about 40 minutes after i took the beef out of the oven, then cut it up and served w potatoes and carrots. This is now the only way I will make my corned beef from now on! Oh, I had already purchased the cheaper corner cut of beef, not the flat cut that it said to use, so I was a little worried it wouldn’t be as good, but it was amazing! Make this, you won’t regret it! And DONT CHECK IT WHILE IT COOKS! Just leave it alone.

I paid $21.18 for what was not quite 5 lbs of corned beef brisket. I cooked it exactly as written and when I took it out of the oven, it was not even 1/2 the size of the piece I put in the oven.  Way overcooked and really not very tasty.  Hubby says it was better cold the next day but either way,  I won't be repeating this one ever.

Haven't tried it yet but plan to do so in the next week or so.  I've been looking for a recipe that sounds like the way my Armenian grandmother cooked hers, in the oven.  This looks similar to what I remember hers looking like so I'm excited to try it.  It's too bad that I didn't write down family recipes.. and it's too late now.  But looking forward to trying this one.  I realize I can't post this without a rating so I'm going to give it 5 stars which I feel it's going to be.

This is wonderful way to cook corned beef!. Moist tender  intense corned beef flavor.  I patted the corned beef  with paper towels once out of its packet,  brushed with  kitchen bouquet, braised it snd added a sliced onion and some garlic plus two tablespoons of water  per the recipe....Then I tripled wrapped    with HD foil set on a rack on a cookie sheet and cooked the 4.64 pound brisket for 5 and 1/2 hours at 275.. The result was spectacular!! ultra tender and very favorable... In other words I followed the recipe with A+ results.

If one is careful opening the foil there is a good amount of juice which adds to the meal if saved. 


The corned beef was served with colcannon and steamed carrots.

Thank you to the  submitter...

I made this exactly as instructed. It was the best corned beef I have ever served!  I have always made traditional corned beef and cabbage but this has changed my mind. I cooked the carrots, potatoes and cabbage in the pan I browned the corned beef in. I simply added water to the pan   Covered and cooked the vegetables for a half hour after bringing to a boil .

Absolutely fantastic recipe!  I have tried and tried to make corned beef that didn't come out tasting like a salt-lick, or tough as shoe leather.  Easy and great.  I wouldn't change a thing!

I've been making oven-roasted corned beef for years, and there's just no comparison - boiled meat is awful! If people think they're adding moisture by cooking in liquid, they need to try this recipe - it's the most moist & juicy method ever. My time-honored method isn't exactly like yours, because I haven't used Kitchen Bouquet for years, but the technique is what yields the stunning results, so people? Slow roast your CB roasts and you'll never go wrong. Be careful to get a flat cut or the whole brisket, and don't fall for the cheapest price - you could get the toughest saltiest meat ever. Choose carefully. 

I always thin-slice my CB roasts so we can rustle up a reuben right quick, or just grab a coupla slices for a low-carb snack. You'll never go wrong with this slow-roasted no-liquid method!

Oh Mauigirl, I think I love you.  This brought me back to the Jewish neighborhood in north Chicago I grew up in.  It was splendid, better than 5 stars.  Any dry people... keep the oven closed and top sealed and LEAVE IT ALONE.  Mine  was 4lbs and cooked just as you said, 6 hours.  I let it sit in the turned off oven 30 minutes and another 15 still sealed on counter before opening my tightly foil sealed roasting pan.  It was a smash hit with all here, none of us will ever boil or slow-cooker another corned beef ever.

Thank you! JimBob_Brisket - Sacramento, CA

03.19.2017 - I made this several years ago with a small roast approximately 2 lbs. I followed the directions exactly. It didn't fare so well. I made a couple mistakes - my pan was way too big for the size of my roast, I covered my roasting pan with one layer of foil, I left the roast in the oven while I left the house. Needless to say, it was way overcooked and all the juices had evaporated and my brisket was a little burned. It was edible but.....Fast forward to today, my 2nd attempt. I started with a 4 lb. roast and soaked it in water for about 1/2 hour in hopes to help with the saltiness. I then browned with the browning sauce as directed and followed the advice of others and triple wrapped it in foil after adding the onion, garlic and water. I then placed it on a baking sheet and roasted for 5-1/2 hours at the recommended temperature. The second time was a charm! It turned out so juicy and tender! I used some of the juices in braised cabbage and it was delicious as well. When I make it next time I will follow Mauigirl's advice for salty briskets and soak for a day or two ahead instead of just 1/2 hour.  When I can get my very picky hubby to eat this that says a lot! This is a keeper! Thanks Mauigirl!

Browned the corned beef as suggested and placed the beef on heavy duty foil with sliced onion and garlic on top and bottom.  I wrapped the beef tightly and put it in my slow cooker; no water at all.  After 5 hours on low, it made plenty of broth and I took it out and let it rest for 15 minutes.  It was fall apart tender and very moist.  I'll make this again for sure!

I don't have kitchen Bouquet so I sprinkled brown sugar instead  before searing the corned beef . Mix honey mustard and brown sugar and glaze it on the fat side of the meat . Add one bottle of bud light 6 ounces - coz that what I have for a 6 lbs corned beef . Add the sachet seasoning . Fat side up in the pan . Cover tightly and bake at 275 degrees . After 4 hours . I remove some juice out . In a separate pan add juice and potatoes , carrots then cabbage last . Bake them all for another hour Til all done . Tender and yummy !

This recipe is off the charts. Made it for first time today after years of boiling. Browned beef well with nothing on it. Put a couple onion slices and a little chopped garlic on top. Wrapped it 4 times with heavy foil. Put in pot with foil balls so it wouldn't sit in the water(1/2-1 cup). Baked at 275 for 1 1/2-2 hours per pound and ate the best corned beef ever. Tender and moist as can be with great flavor. Thank you, mauigirl!

This will now be, without a doubt, my go to corned beef recipe...I've boiled or used a slow cooker for years, but tried this out for something different and the difference was incredible...The meat was juicy and fell apart at the touch of the fork. That coupled with the browned crust from searing in the frying pan before roasting, took this meal to the next level and rivaled corned beef I've had at many of the best NY pubs.

Hands down the BEST corn beef brisket I have EVER had!!! I followed all the directions except using the oven. I tightly wrapped my prepared brisket, two tablespoons water with the onions, garlic & I added sweet peppers in two layers of heavy duty foil. I placed the wrapped brisket in my large crock pot, set it on high for 6 hours. BEEF BRISKET PERFECTION!!!!!! We can't wait to make it again!

I'm not the most skilled of cooks, but wanted to make this for St. Patrick's Day. I followed the recipe to the  letter. My corned beef was 3 pounds, so I adjusted the time accordingly. This was AMAZING! After removing from the oven and not opening the foil for at least 30 minutes, it turned out so moist and flavorful. I took the onions from the top of the roast, put them in a frying pan with some butter to caramelize. I then added my cooked cabbage and carrots to the pan for a quick browning on high heat before serving. My guests actually thought I could cook! THANK YOU for posting!

My guests LOVED it! Said it was the best ever!  I forgot to buy the browning liquid, so I left that part out...don't think it was missed at all.  My suggestion:  After the corned beef is cooked, pour the liquid (there'll be a lot) into a pot, put in cabbage wedges, and cover with water.  The cabbage will be fantastic, too!

Over the top...great! Just finished dinner! I read most of the reviews and was concerned about the amount of water but far too many other people made the recipe exactly with the ingredients listed so I did too.I used Gravy Masters browning sauce and seared the meat about 6 minutes each side, and placed on a RACK inside a dutch oven. I covered the pot with  two pieces of foil and put the lid on for a tight seal. My corn beef was only 3.25lbs so I baked it at 275 for 4 1/2hrs and rested for 30 minutes outside of the oven before  removing the foil. I had about 6oz. of juices in the bottom of the pan. My onions and garlic were still on top of the meat so I took the juices with the garlic/onions and pureed them to make a sauce. The sauce was a tad salty so I added about 1/2 cup water to it to take away some of the salt taste and it was excellent. The best corn beef I have ever made an by far the simplest recipe I have used.. This will be my go to for corn beef. I'm wondering for those who had tough dry meat or burnt, if they didn't use the rack or didn't have a tight seal. We loved it, thanks for sharing!

I cannot say enough about how wonderful this recipe is!  We absolutely loved it!  I followed the recipe exactly and the corned beef was tender and juicy in exactly 6 hours.   I will never make it another way again.  Thanks, Mauigirl! UPDATE: I made it again today using two (2.5 lbs) briskets because I couldn't find a large one.  Based on a suggestion from Mauigirl I cooked them 5 hours instead of 6 hrs and it was perfect!

This was amazing. I used the juices from browning in my pan instead of water. I wrapped the pan alot in tin foil. Fell apart when done. So easy.

THE very BEST tasting corned beef ever!!  I will never boil it again. Delicious, tender and so flavorful.  You must try it.  I didn't use browning gravy and it was still great.

Followed recipe exactly! Making this again for the second time. I will never make the typical crock pot/ boiled corned beef again! This is amazing straight out of the oven and leftovers make one heck of a sandwich. Thank you!

2nd time I've made this now and this time was better that the 1st. I double wrapped it in foil this go around and the end result scared me a little at first. I didn't open it to check until after the six hours were up and it had shrunk quite a bit and looked a little dry. WRONG! SUPER moist and flavorful. I wouldn't change a thing. My former go to recipe was a crockpot recipe and even though it stayed moist and tender too, the end result was shredded and there was no slicing. You gotta have slicing if you want to turn the leftovers into a Rueben! This is my go to from now on out! Thanks mauigirl! XOXO

I bought an extra corned beef brisket on St. Patty's day when they were on sale to try this recipe later for sandwiches.  I was afraid it would be too salty, but was very tasty, tender and easy to slice thin the next day.  This made a very good grilled Swiss cheese, mustard and corned beef sandwich.

Another stellar review for this easy and delicious method of making corned beef! I decided last minute I had a craving for corned beef, knowing I really wanted a Rueben later in the week, so I wasn't prepeared with the browning sauce. I used a some A1 Bold I keep on hand for marinades and it was a nice sub. Other than that, I followed the recipe. At the end, I took the meat out, wrapped in foil and let rest. I added big diced potatoes and baby carrots to the liquid (yes, there will be quite a bit of liquid!) I took the meat from, rewrapped and put back in the oven at 350 for 35-40 minutes. Meanwhile, I sliced the corned beef rewrapped and put back in the oven to rewarm for a few minutes as the potatoes finished. It was heaven and I look forward to a Rueben for lunch tomorrow! Thanks, Julie! This will be my go-to method in the future, so much easier and more flavorful than keeping an eye on a boiling pot!

This turned out really good, like others I wrapped it tightly in foil.

I do have one complaint.  I don't understand adding Kitchen Bouquet prior to searing it.  When searing it the juices from the meat come out and the Kitchen Bouquet covers the searing pan.  Then it just burned, smoked, and smelled terrible.  It also ruined the pan I was using.  Next time I'll sear first and then coat it with a little Kitchen Bouquet. 

In the end it was still delicious.

This recipe, plus GeoCarter's comment gave me some good ideas!  
The day before St. Patrick's, and after I got home from work, I cut off most - but not all - of the fat from my flat-corned beef brisket, put on top of 2 Tablespoons of coconut oil (you can use olive) in my 8 qt. pot, covering it with water.  Brought water to boil, then turned-down to low simmer for 90 minutes per lb.  After that, I simmered it another 30 minutes with clean, red potato wedges and peeled and chopped carrots.  Then, I added the chopped cabbage and simmered it another 15 minutes.  Turned off the stove and left it there, covered tightly, overnight. I did this because my husband prefers well-cooked veggies, so I wasn't worried about them being too soft.  On St. Patrick's Day and after I got home from work, I spooned out the veggies (that WEREN'T over-cooked or falling apart) in a separate 3 qt pan, placing brisket in a buttered 9"x 13" glass pan, fat side up.  I made a topper for it consisting of:  1/4 cup of spicy-brown mustard, 1/4 cup of dark-brown sugar, 1/4 cup butter, 3 Tablespoons of creamy horseradish, 1 Tablespoon of red pepper flakes, 1 teaspoon of black pepper and 3/4 cup of Panko bread crumbs.  Spread that over it, spooned the veggies all around it with about 1 cup of the broth, and wrapped it over with little "tent" of heavy-duty foil.  Baked it for an hour and a half at 300 degrees F.  My husband and son said it was the best they ever had!  Save the extra broth to cook more veggies.

This recipe was very easy and made for a deliciously moist corned beef brisket! The brisket I had was just under 3.5 lbs, so I only kept it in the oven for 5 hours instead of 6. I had also wrapped the brisket, onions, garlic, and water in aluminum foil, then put it in a casserole dish. After I removed it from the oven, I let it sit on the counter for 30 minutes or so. It cut beautifully and easily, even falling apart in some places. Absolutely delicious!! Can't wait to have some grilled reuben leftovers tomorrow!

This became a big hit at first taste for everyone. The preparation was a snap 1,2,3 and in the oven it went. I made a 3 1/2 lb brisket and cooked for 5 hours @ 275° with no peeking. I have never made corned beef before, and glad I choose this recipe, and was asked to make again. Thank you for your recipe mauigirl, and the help you gave on the buzz.

I purchased at 4.65lb Brisket...that's the biggest one I could find. I thought it would plenty for just the two of us! WRONG! As Bdweld said, "buy two, because the first one will go fast." He was right. We ate it all, but about 1/8 of lb. No sammies for us tomorrow. This recipe for Corned Beef is the best we ever had. It was easy peasy too. I put it in the oven at 9:15am and took it out at 3:15pm. I didn't peek once, although it was really hard not to. It came out moist and falling apart tender. We didn't even make a sauce out of the pan drippings. I used it for my skillet fried cabbage. Now I need to go back to Safeway tomorrow and buy another one or two so we can have Corned Beef Sandwiches. Thank you Julie for a great AND easy recipe. We will for sure be making this one again.

Yummers!  I prepared this exactly as the submitter instructed, and it turned out beautifully.  It was a big temptation to peek inside the foil as it baked all afternoon, but I resisted!  I was rewarded with a juicy, tender roast, with some great drippings to add to my roasted potatoes and carrots.  I also prepared Baking Nana's braised cabbage, which rounded out my very satisfying salute to St. Pat!

This was my first time ever making corned beef. It was awesome. The meat was soooo tender and flavorful. My son and husband said that they don't like corned beef (even though they never had it before). Well, they both went back for seconds and thirds lol.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  I'll be buying another before the sale ends.

After all my years of cooking I finally made a corned beef brisket!  Why did I wait?  I didn't think I had any takers!  And probably had I followed any other recipe that would have been the case.  I followed the triple-wrapped method, and it served us well.  So well that I picked up another brisket for my freezer so that in the summer we can enjoy some more of the yummy sandwiches that we had!  Thanks so much, mauigirl!

I have been cooking corned beef for over 50 years.  Thanks, Mauigirl, this is by far the best I have ever made.  Used Baking Nana's method of triple-wrapping meat in heavy foil.  Not only was the corned beef wonderful, the clean-up was so easy.  I had a lean piece of meat from Costco that was perfectly square so it cooked evenly.  I poured the broth into a gravy/fat separator.  I was surprised how little fat came to the top. I will be making this again and again.

Really good also on sandwiches the next day.   I didn't have Browning sauce,  so I just added a honey mustard mixture to taste on top before cooking.  I also added some celery and carrots the last two hours of cooking.

I followed your recipe exactly. I was very concerned because it was very tough going in. The kitchen smells amazing while it cooks. When it was done, I could've cut with a spoon! It tastes amazing and I will do this again. I wished I would've tried this sooner.  I served it with a potato casserole.Thank you Mauigirl. This is a keeper.

Fork tender, melt in your mouth goodness. No doubt this recipe will rise to the top of the charts. No more boiled corned beef for me. This is such an easy foolproof recipe that anyone can make it and look like a star in the kitchen. I did follow Baking Nana's advice and triple wrapped it in heavy duty foil.

Excellent method for cooking corned beef.  I made this yesterday and was not sure about brushing the beef with the browning sauce and using all that garlic, but I wanted to try the recipe as written.   I'm so glad I didn't change anything.  This was the best corned beef I have ever made -- and I've made plenty in my 50+ years!  My husband and son loved the taste and texture.  It was really moist and held together.  I'll never use the boiled recipes again.  Thanks for the great recipe, Mauigirl!

Neither my husband nor myself is crazy about traditional corned beef, but both of us loved this.  I took a suggestion about cooking potatoes in the broth, adding carrots & cabbage.  It turned out great.  I will be returning to Costco for a couple more pieces of meat to put in the freezer.  And, I love corned beef hash; which I will be making with the scanty leftovers.

I made this last night for 15 friends and everyone just loved it.  I will make corned beef this way from now on.  It was absolutely delicious!  I didn't change (and wouldn't) change a thing!  A year later and I made this corned beef again for a different 15 people everyone just loved it.

As an Irishman (ok, woman!), a cook and a fan of corned beef, I have cooked it many ways over the years.  This was truly outstanding and the best I have ever had.  Even my Italian husband went back for 3rds! There's not even enough left for a healthy sandwich :-(  
My piece was 2.5 lbs but still used the 6 cloves and full onion (as i said, hubby is Italian) and had no Kitchen Bouquet so just used some pepper as suggested by another review.  As others have said, I will never go back to the crock pot or stove top again. 
Thanks for sharing,  Mauigirl.

Absolutely the very best corned beef.  I will never boil again and will never buy deli cb again.  It had the best flavour and was tender and moist.  Made it especially for hot corned beef sandwiches and everyone ooohed and ahhhhed.  So yummy! I made it exactly as described!  In my calphalon Dutch oven with tight lid and never looked until done.  PERFECT!  Thank you very much!

This is the only way my husband will eat corned beef. I did make some substitutions. I poured Guinness beer over it for the liquid and used the spice packet in the bottom (didn’t want to waste it) and added carrots for sweetness. Turned our great.

Hands down the best I've ever made.  Followed recipe exactly and cooked for about 6 hours.  We made Reubens with it (husbands favorite) and they were excellent.  Thanks for sharing such an awesome recipe.

I’m an Italian girl and I made this recipe and it is truly the best corned beef I ever made. I will never make the traditional way of just boiling it again. Excellent! I made hash with leftovers and that was fabulous also.

I've made this 4 times.  The only change I make to the recipe, I use a large onion and slice in 1/2 thick rounds and layer them in the bottom of the roasting pan.  I lay the brisket directly on the onions.  I sprinkled the chopped garlic directly on top of the roast pour liquid over the top of the roast, cover tightly with foil and roast for 5-6 hours.  
Twice, I've taken the roast out after 3-4 hrs, add small new potatoes and Brussels sprouts then TIGHTLY  cover again and put back in.  This did not change the juiciness of the meat.   My family loves this recipe!

Follows the recipe except I used a 3 lb  corned beef and adjusted the time, allowing for 1:10 per pound anc used about 1/2 cup of water.  I also made my own bowning sauce from brown sugar and beer stock and a dash of balsamic vinegar.   Everything else was the same and the and the result was incredible.  Real deli style corned beef and real easy to make.

I made this for a group of friends on St. Patrick’s Day. It was absolutely delicious and exactly as described, the most tender, juiciest corned beef I have ever cooked. And I’ve cooked a lot of them over the years. All of my guests said what everyone else’s said “the best corned beef I’ve ever had. I followed directions exactly as given, using a 3-1/2 # and a 3# flat cut corned beef for 6 hours. Only way to cook them.

Like the narrative said, I will never, and I do mean ever, go back to a boiled corn beef.
We got a Kobe beef, which we got from Costco, and the rest is gold.  Absolutely incredible!  
You really should try it.  
We're doing it again this Sunday for Saint Patty's Day!
Happy cooking!

This quickly became our whole family’s  go to recipe. Everyone who tries it asks for the recipe. This is a long shot since the recipe has been here for so long but,  I would like to make a smaller one, about 3 pounds. Do you have any suggestions for how long to cook it?

We do tweak it a bit. We add potatoes, carrots, cabbage wedges, celery and sometimes fresh green beans during the last hour and a half. Making sure to keep them on top of the meat or on the rack otherwise they can be very salty.

Stupid easy, and STUPID GOOD. I will never make corned beef any other way. I follow this recipe exactly. Leftovers cubed and fried up with potatoes and shredded carrots make a mean hash.

Great corned beef!  I won’t boil it again.  Made per the recipe, and double wrapped in foil and placed in a foil covered roasting pan.  I made sure my juices couldn’t escape.  There was plenty of juice in the foil after 6 hours and it was so tender.  I did rinse it and patted it dry before browning.  The onions and garlic add a great flavor to the corned beef and I probably used a little extra.

Great recipe! I did make a few changes: 1. Keep the flavor pack, add more mustard seeds, and your favorite roasting herbs, grind all in a matate. This mixture goes under the roasting rack with added water.  (enough to almost touch the underside of the rack) 2.  Surround the brisket with one layer of baby potatoes, or little taters cut into golf ball size chunks.  (i guess you could add any tuber  or underground veggie here) 3. Aluminum foil cover is mandatory to keep things moist and fall apart delicious. 4. The drippings with added herbs and spices makes a very flavorful gravy and the taters, if any are left over, go into tomorrow's corned beef hash! As Chef John says "...and as always enjoy."

All I can say is....WOW!!! Not usually one to leave a review.. but this was probably one of the best meals of my entire life!! The corned beef was saltier than I prefer... but I made a baked potato with sour cream and chives which balanced it perfectly.. green beans with almonds on the side.. I can't wait to make this again!!

The absolute most outstanding corned beef recipe by far!! I can’t say enough about it- life changing. So simple and beyond any other recipe out there... melts in your mouth. I can’t believe people are still eating boiled or crock pot corned beef- so sad... there should be a PSA to save them.

I have never had braised corned beef! OMG!!! I will never boil it again. I also have never used the browning bouquet. I followed the recipe exactly & I mean I have never had such good corned beef! And my husband raved and wanted me to make another the next day lol! I have one in the oven right now & am going to have sandwiches with the matzo ball soup I'm going to make! Thank you for such a wonderful recipe!

I just made this in my Instant Pot and it came out spectacular! So tender and juicy. I brushed on the browning sauce, seared the sides and tossed onions, carrots, potatoes and water into the IP. For 3lbs of corned beef, I set it on pressure cook for 70 minutes with natural release of 20 minutes.  The veggies were over cooked and mushy but the corned beef came out fab. My husband and kids loved it!

I’ve always boiled corned beef w/potatoes, carrots, onions, and cabbage...what we call “New England Boiled Dinner”.  My family always expected it for St Patty’s Day. HOWEVER, I made this recipe (in a crockpot) the other day and it is hands down the best corned beef we’ve ever had! My husband and sons agree. I could make this every week and they would love it!  Thank you for sharing your recipe. It’s the bomb.

Made this exactly as outlined in the recipe, turned out excellent.  Make your cabbage, carrots, and potatoes separately.  The two tablespoons of water is plenty of liquid for this slow cooked braising method.  Don't fall to the temptation of checking progress by pulling it from the oven and pulling off the foil, you will ruin it.  Prepare it, put it in the oven, then go away.  Drink some beers and be patient.  One tip...after you take your corned beef out of that plastic wrap, rinse it thoroughly under cold water and pat it dry with paper towels before browning.  That liquid in the bag is bad nasty salty stuff.  Also pay a dollar more for the brisket flat instead of the point.  You can thank me later.

This is amazing. I follow the recipe exactly. My first attempt was such a hit. Even changing the mind of a at husband who had nothing but bad memories of dried out corned beef celebrating St Patty's Day at an overcrowded bar and went into this meal sure it was going to be mediocre at best. Oh my goodness.  He converted on the spot. Tender, juicy, remarkable flavor. Yes, yes and yes.  I've now made it three times and we typically consume the bulk of the dish the first evening. I have also shared this with a few friends who just love to braise meat and they have all have left the traditional boiled way for this version. It is that good.

I just made this tonight. My wife and I loved it and we will be making again soon! We followed the recipe exactly except I reduced the cooking time to 5 hours since my corned beef was just under 4 lbs. It was perfect!  We made sandwiches on marble rye with Swiss, 1000 island dressing and sauerkraut.  A few minutes in the panini press and Bam! Sandwich perfection!!! This is a keeper!!

This came out "Deli" perfect and the aroma was wonderful. I don't eat corned beef but it sure made me start thinking about changing my eating habits. Hubby loved it. Very easy to make.

Absolutely perfect. Followed directions as written, making sure it was securely sealed because so many negative reviews said the 2 Ts was not enough liquid.  

It was moist and very flavorful. Love it! This will be my new go-to recipe for corned beef.

Let me start by saying I do not like Corned Beef.............until now. That recipe knocked my socks off, and my grown children. OMG, there wasn't a speck left on the serving dish. It was a small one, 2 lbs. Today I making another one (2 weeks later) by daughters request. Bought a 5 and 1/2 pound one this time! The only thing I changed last time was I added a bit more water and then halfway through, I put in 1/2 bottle of Guinness Stout Beer. (even though I wasn't supposed to peek. lol)

No changes made here as far as the recipe. I did use a rectangular roasting pan with a raised rack. I felt this made a big difference as far as the saltiness. OMG it was fantastic. This will be my go to for now on.

This recipe is INCREDIBLE!!! I have made it 3 times and both my corned beef snob husband and his mother LOVE it. After making this recipe I made my usual corned beef and cabbage recipe for St. Patrick’s day in the crock pot and found that it now seemed terrible in comparison. You really can’t go wrong with this recipe it’s perfect!!! I used my roasting pan and covered it tightly with foil. Thanks for sharing!!!

I made two of these, followed the recipe exactly.   One in a regular roasting pan and the other in a Dutch oven.  The one in the Dutch oven looked like a black rock but thankfully was still moist inside!  The other one was delicious!  Cooked for 12 people and they all said it was the best corned beef they've ever had!   Definitely doing this one again but not in a Dutch oven!

I made this recipe almost as written. I did not have a Dutch oven, so after reading the reviews I wrapped the corned beef in heavy aluminum foil and then put it into an aluminum half steam table pan with a lid.  My family totally loved the results. We will never go back to boiled .

I had only ever made corned beef in the crock pot and I decided to try this recipe for something different.  I will NEVER make it in the crock pot again.  This recipe was easy and had so much more taste in the meat I couldn't believe it.  I had to come back to rate it after receiving a phone call from our dinner guest asking how to make it this way.  Wonderful, thanks for sharing.

What an easy and wonderful recipe.  My brisket was 3.5 lbs. and I braised it at 275 F for 4.5 hours, perfect.   Made wonderful Reuben sandwiches .

I added enough water to pan to keep from scorching but to no avail. Next time I'll line pan with tin foil. Apart from that, this was the first time I've ever braised meat and I am not disappointed.  This was so good it was amazing.  Highly doubt I'll ever boil this meat in water again.

Followed directions almost to the letter, just made slits in the brisket to stuff half-cloves of garlic in and dusted it with peppercorns before putting it in the oven. Came out perfectly, and I can't wait to try it again.

I did not make any changes. No changes are needed- this is the BEST way to cook corned beef. Wish I’d bought a larger cut- there were no leftovers. Thank you for a great recipe.

This was superb.  By far, the best corned beef we have ever eaten. What a difference, cooking the beef separately from the vegetables!  Using a 3.6 lb flat corned beef from Costco, I followed the recipe as written, including the tablespoon of Kitchen Bouquet, but did not brown the meat. After 5 hours, the meat was firm and easy to slice.  Sautéed the cabbage with carrots and onions.  Yum!

As suggested, now that I've had corned beef prepared using this recipe, I will never go back. We used a roaster with a tightly fitting lid, and the meat was tender, juicy, and had a beautifully caramelized layer of onions on top. I used the seasoning packet that came with my brisket to season cabbage wedges, carrots and potatoes that I roasted instead of the usual boiling. Fabulous combination. Thank you for this recipe!!!

I didn't have browning sauce.  I used sauce of brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce and red wine vinegar to baste the brisket.  
Absolutely delicious.   I used 1 1/2 inches of water in Pan.  Sprinkled seasoning pack on top.   Put sliced onions and garlic on top.   Covered tightly and braised.  Because my pan not big enough for all the vegetables, I removed some liquid from pan last 30 minutes of the braise.   I had to dilute that because it was salty.  Cooked my vegetables on the stove top in that liquid.  Final brisket itself and the vegetables were not salty.  This recipe is a keeper.
I used the point cut.  I don't care for the leaner flat cut.

When I saw how highly rated the recipe was, I knew I had to try it.  I looked up how to make my own browning liquid, which I did by cooking down sugar and adding beef broth. (with how salty corned beef is, I probably should have used low sodium!).  That said, this recipe turned out the most tender corned beef I've ever made!  I wouldn't change a thing.  Simple and delicious.  I little mustard for dipping and the boys and I were happy campers!

I have never tried cooking corned beef before, so I was excited. I found this recipe and it looked so good. The braising is what really sold this for everyone. Cooked with roasted garlic, baked low and slow. So tender. So yummy!

I made this as written and agreed with a comment made by the original submitter.  How salty it is rests with the individual corned beef.  I have probably made corned beef 50 times and always did the boil first.  I will do that next time because it was like a salt-lick.  A waste of a good piece of meat.  
I thought the browning sauce was an interesting idea and it was very tender...but boil first then bake and then glaze under broiler.

Followed the directions exactly and it was super moist and delicious!  If you are feeding adults I would recommend more than 5 pds because it cooks down a lot!

Made this as directed in the recipe except substituted 1/4 cup Guiness for the water. My corned beef was 3.70-lbs and it was moist and tender after the 6 hours with delicious juice. I wrapped twice in foil as suggested by a reviewer;  Easy clean up. I used 1/2 of the juice, added 1/2 can beef broth, the seasoning packet, and a little more Guiness to a covered pan along with halved baby red potatoes, baby carrots, and large cut cabbage. I steamed the veggies for about 45 minutes, stirring periodically. They were delicious too! Thanks so much for posting this recipe. It will be my new go to recipe for corned beef.

Made exactly as it was printed.  I have never had such good corned beef.  Had friends and family for dinner and not a bite left for reubens the next day.  Bought and cooked another one for sandwiches.  Fantastic, don't change a thing!!!

I literally just created an account so I could leave this review. I've had my fair share of amazing corned beef and less than great corned beef, both usually traditionally boiled. This was THE BEST. I reluctantly followed the instructions exactly (except my rack is missing so I set the meat on top of the onion). I was especially leery of the browning sauce which I purchased for this recipe, after reading the ingredients I decided to go with it. My brisket was flat cut, 3.27 lbs so it was in the oven for 3 hours 55 min, in a Dutch oven wrapped tightly with foil. When it came out I sealed it up in foil to rest for 30 min while I boiled potatoes and cabbage in the braising liquid with a few cups of water added. Perfection. I don't think ill ever boil a corned beef again.

Fantastic way to make corned beef! For many years I either cooked my corned beef on the stovetop or in a crockpot.  My daughter and I love it and I’ll make it throughout the year.  However, sometimes the meat was a bit dry, tough or just average.  That is until I tried your recipe.  I follow your directions with the exception of adding a half cup of water to the bottom of the pan.  This recipe is full proof.  Tender, delicious and easy.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!!  Even my husband enjoys it now!

Beauty!  So much better that the boiled in the crock pot version.   I did include the seasoning packet...it seemed almost against the law to not use it after all these years.  Like taking the label off a new pillow for the first time.  :-)

5 STARS!! Amazingly tender. Wrapped two times in foil. Cooked on 275 for 5 hours. The 2 pound cut came out perfect. Didn't use the browning sauce this time. Used black pepper instead searing for a few minutes on ALL sides in olive oil. Also added more water to bottom of pan as I was using a big roasting pan. Don't remember if  I used the lid on the roasting pan or foil to cover the top. the first time. Cooked fat side up. Would probably be good to let it rest after taking out.**update: didn't like the browning sauce.  will go back to searing with salt and pepper**

I cooked this corned beef exactly as instructed and it turned out to be by far better than any version I've had. This is so full of taste, very tender and moist. I cook a lot and have been fascinated from very early on with preparing and enjoying all kinds of food. I'm not looking for any more corned beef recipes. This is it.

This was the best corned beef I ever made.  I did use gravy master because that is what I had.  There isn't a huge difference between that and kitchen bouquet. It was tender and very flavorful. Followed the directions as written. So easy.  Will definitely use this recipe in the future.  I served it with Diane's colcannon recipe on this site and I had an excellent family dinner.  Recipes for both requested.  Thanks for the recipe.

Made for my sweetie  because he loves corned beef. I’m not a fan of the boiled method but I loved this recipe and so did my family. Will never boil it again!

I had never made corned beef this way before; now I think this is the ONLY way I will make corned beef!! it came out delicious, juicy, caramelized, and had a really rich complex flavor! Absolutely making it again, and SOON.

This is the only way I make corned beef now. Husband loves it!  No changes!  Be careful how you wrap the aluminum foil.  Water came out under the foil to the bottom of stove!  Just be sure to seal the edges around the rack!

This was tender and tasted okay, a decent recipe but not for me for several reasons. Foremost is that I trashed one of my favorite baking pans. I searched for one large enough to hold a baking rack and came up with an aluminum baking pan. DO NOT USE an aluminum pan. Looking back it makes sense but didn't occur to me that the briney splatter would pit the pan! (And yes, I soaked the beef to remove salt.) Additionally it was kind of a mess to clean the pan and rack and I'm smell sensitive so didn't enjoy the long period of cooking smell. A minor point I know. I also bought Kitchen Bouquet just for this recipe and should have followed earlier suggestions just to use pepper.  I wasn't fond of that either. Just my opinion tho. ....  But overall, I far prefer a recipe I tried from Pinterest of cooking the corned beef in the Instapot. I know it sounds wrong but it was good, quick and less smelly. I will go back to that.

This recipe was easy and the end result was delicious. I used a smaller brisket, so I adjusted the cooking time. My husband loved it.

Amazing recipe! My family RAVED that this is the best brisket EVER. I am unfamiliar with browning sauce so I skipped that part and simply sprinkled the brisket lightly with granulated onion and granulated garlic. Absolutely delicious and impressive for a stunning piece of meat that requires minimal prep. Can't wait til they go on sale again!

This is absolutely the best corn beef. It is so much better than boiling. My husband's part Irish and he grew up with Corn beef and he said never fix it another way. I used Diane's Colcannon from this site to go with it... superb. I'm fixing it again today and it's no where near Saint Patricks Day.

This recipe rocks! Can't believe we boiled our corned beef brisket for so many years, well... not anymore. The brisket was a smaller one (2-3 lbs) and I let it cook for a little over 5 hours but it was well worth the wait. Can't wait to make this again. Thanks mauigirl!

Search no more! After trying this recipe I fell guilty and had great remorse for the cuts of beef I have destroyed and wasted in the past. (I was a boiler). My husband cringed when I mentioned Saint Patrick's day as two years ago the meat was so dry I had to perform the Heimlich maneuver. Thank you for submitting this recipe- you saved St Patrick's Day!! Flawless, tender and amazing! Forever greatful.......

I fixed this braised corn beef brisket as the recipe is in the the instructions. I had three people over for dinner and they all said they would give it a 5 Starr  rating.  I asked my husband and  he preferred it this way  over the way I cooked it before and he said he would give it a  5 star rating.  My husband even gave the recipe to his fire dept  buddies for them to try.

I followed the recipe, but used a bottle of Sam Adams in place of the water.  It came out so tender and delicious. My husband said it was the best meal I've ever made.  I boiled the carrots and potatoes when there was about 1/2 hour left on the roast, nothing special.  But I made the cabbage on the stovetop with bacon, and that was a big hit as well.  I also made a gravy with the drippings just to try,  and that was great. I'll never boil again.

So delicious!  I had 2 2.5 pound roasts, so I adjusted the time a bit (to 5 hours) and they were perfect!  I'm never going back to crock pot corned beef.  This was amazing!

Best corned beef ever.  I don't use kitchen bouquet, so I added 1/2 bottle Guinness as others suggested.  Had always boiled the meat before this, but never again.  Everyone loved it.

Ah-mazing! Hands down the best corned beef recipe I've ever made and our guests all agreed. They were even talking about it the next day.  I made it exactly as written, except I made two briskets at once. Cooked for 5 hours, did not peek, turned oven off and left them in the oven until ready to serve. Seriously, so good.

The five star reviews were right!  I bought a 12 pound (yes it was huge) corned beef, cut it in two so I could brown it, and pretty much followed the recipe exactly as posted.  I browned both pieces using Kitchen Bouquet (found in the gravy section), wrapped each one in two layers of heavy duty aluminum foil (I should have used three - it leaked a little, but did not dry it out. There was still LOTS of liquid left - it just made a mess of my oven.)  I served it at our dinner club of ten good cooks for St. Patrick's Day, and everyone, to a person, said it was the best corned beef they'd ever had.  I will say, though, that I think the SIZE helped - instead of the little one inch thick piece that you can buy at your grocery store, this one was a good 4" thick, and oh, my, was it wonderful.

I will never boil another corned beef. The flavor and tenderness that this recipe produced is unbeatable not only for traditional corned beef and cabbage, but for sandwiches too. Used my 50's vintage Griswold dutch oven with a very tight fitting lid, the trivet and a cup of water. Perfect. Thanks for posting!

I've been making this for several years off this exact recipe, and it's fantastic. I read a couple reviews saying the meat was tough, and my theory is this: one time I accidentally put it into roast with the fat cap down, and it came out tough because it didn't have gravity to self baste the meat as the fat rendered.  Always roast with the fat cap up after the seating step, and it will be fork tender. Also, if it's already roasted for 6 hours but you're not ready to eat, leave it alone in the oven at 170F and it can Cruise for a few more hours with no detriment; just turn it back to 275 for a few minutes before pulling it out and carving. We roast with potato chunks, baby carrots, onion, celery, and minced garlic with brussel sprouts roasted roasted on. separate pan. The best corned beef, indeed!

This was phenomenal! I wrapped it in several layers of foil instead of covering the roasting pan. I could have carved it with a butter knife! Very tender and delicious.

I have always believed that "boiled" anything loses much of it's flavor in the liquid. It seemed logical to me that this would be a more flavorful method. BINGO!!! It is awesome. I used the original recipe. I did, however, cook it in a cooking bag with the carrots, onion, and celery. It has so much more flavor, you would not believe. Do it! You won't be sorry.

I'm not one to leave reviews but I absolutely feel compelled to rate this dish.  This was the best corned beef I've ever had! My Husband said it only took me 32 years to get it right!
I bought low sodium corned beef, and took the advise of others and brushed with brown sugar and brown mustard. 
So far this is the best recipe I've found on Allrecipe.com and I've tried many....

I don't believe I will ever make corned beef any other way again! I followed the directions exactly and the results delighted everybody including my Irish wife. The brisket was very tender and moist but did not fall apart when sliced, making perfect slices. I used the same roasting pan I use for turkey that has a tight fitting lid. That kept the moisture in the pan very well and eliminated the need for aluminum foil. This recipe will be my standard for corned beef from here on.

I made this in the slow cooker, on low  (6-8 hrs depending on size of cut), and I loved it.  Much better than traditional boiled versions.  I trimmed all the fat I could before browning.

This recipe was simple and SUPER delicious. I will fix my brisket this way every time. My tweak to the process is to add more water to the bottom of the pan, because the pan started to burn during the last hour and a half or so.

I am a lover of corned beef and cabbage.... but I found this recipe.  I thought I could not go wrong since  I have been boiling it for years.  I tried this recipe .....the only thing I did different ...as other reviewers I wrapped the corned beef in foil after I browned it on both sides. It was AWESOME....so tender... I did not have any left over for sandwiches. Will be braising it AGAIN.  Thanks. Mauigirl.

This is a death row last meal corned beef! And growing up in an Irish household, to say I was skeptical of a braised corned beef would be an understatement. 
But hold onto your kilt or your yarmulke, because this was by far a home run! 
There are only two types of people who wouldn't like this recipe,  "the dead, or the gastronomicaly challenged.

This was my first try ever at corned beef brisket. Wow! Fantastic taste super moist, and tender! This is a 5 star plus recipe. I won't ever make it another way. My entire family, even the grand kids, loved it.

this was absolutely amazing. I did not use the browning sauce due to sodium levels. also I might have bought a brand that was extra salty. I had 2 three lb briskets and followed the recipe (no browning sauce) and these came out so tender and flavorful. amazing!!! thanks for this recipe.

Only one slight change, I used Guinness instead of water   in the pan.  Would definitely make this again.  Probably the BEST corned beef I have ever had.  Everyone was surprised at how tender and delicious this turned out.  No more boiled CB for me!

Thank you for a fabulous recipe, mauigirl!  I had always been afraid to attempt corned beef, thinking back to the icky, slimy boiled meat I recall from my childhood.  Then I once saw my aunt put her corned beef in the oven, and I begged for the recipe.  Sadly, she said no (secret family recipe), and here I am now, years later.  I finally got up the courage to try, and I'm so glad I did.  I followed the directions, but I also put the meat on a rack in my roaster.  Not much later, my house smelled like heaven.  It was ready in 5-1/2 hours, and was fork tender.  Everyone loved it, and my daughters went back for seconds.  Even my finicky son, who has sensory/eating issues, said this is his new favorite food!  No better testament than that.

I used the onions and garlic, and the long slow braising time, and it was the best corned beef ever. I  had to make do with what I had on hand, because I found this recipe at the last minute. No browning sauce, so I skipped that. I compensated for a loose-fitting pan lid (no foil) by adding a bottle of hard cider. I'll do that again. 
Even my elderly mom, who for 90+ years has barely tolerated corned beef,  asked me to fix this again soon.

Wow. I have never been able to make a corned beef this fall apart tender. Followed the directions exactly and I was not disappointed. After the meat was done I added some water to the drippings and cut up some red potatoes and put the pan back in the oven until the potatoes were tender. I almost ate all of the meat while waiting for the potatoes. It was that good. I will never boil another corned beef.

I followed the recipe as stated except that I saved the little packet of spices and added it to 4 C beef broth and cooked my onions, potatoes and cabbage in that for flavor.  I also poured just enough beef broth into the bottom of the corned beef pan with the onions and garlic to cover the bottom.  I had a 4.3 lb flat cut so I only cooked it 6 hours, and the meat came out so tender, I was so pleased.  I didn't start cooking the veggies until about 45 minutes before the meat was ready and then I poured the cooked broth from the bottom of the corned beef pan into the veggie pot for flavor when the meat came out of the oven.  I have never had success with the boiled corned beef in a slow cooker crock pot way and this was a perfect alternative, will definitely cook this way in the future.

This turned out great! It was moist, tender and delicious.

As the submitted noted in a later comment, make sure it is tightly covered and DON'T CHECK IT! I suspect some of those reporting that it came out tough and dry either didn't cover it well or checked on it too often.

5 Star!  I have been making corn beef for St. Patricks Day for 30+ years, and most of the time it has been a TOTAL BUST!  This is the best recipe I have ever made!  The searing of the corn beef is a little messy, however it is well worth it!  I cooked a 3.5 pound corn beef for about 4 hours, it came out so tender, you could use a plastic fork to eat the meat.  YUM, YUM!!  I  will never ever make corn beef any other way then this, a fabulous recipe!!

I just made this tonight for St. Patrick's day and it was delicious!!! I will never make corn beef any other way again. Even my teenagers had seconds.  I didn't know what kitchen bouquet was but looked it up and substituted with lager beer, brown sugar, Worcestershire and water.  Worked beautifully.

Wow! This was amazing!  The meat was so tender and flavorful. I added a cut up onion, baby carrots, thinly sliced potatoes  and shredded cabbage along on the rack with the brisket, I added a cup of water to the bottom pan, covered the whole thing with aluminum foil tightly and cooked it on 275 for 4 1/2 hours. My brisket was only 3 lbs. though. I am so happy I found this recipe. Thanks for sharing it!

I will never make boiled corned beef again!  After browning, I spread Dijon mustard on top of the meat and a good couple of shakes of Worcestershire  sauce.  Then piled on the onion and garlic.  I added 1/4 cup liquid to roasting pan.  Had a 3 lb. beef and baked for 5 hours.  Do not open oven or foil.  Absolutely delish!  I have potato and cabbage for sides.  New way of cooking and I thank you for sharing.

Perfect as written, no need for any changes!  The ONLY way to prepare corned beef!  Thanks Mauigirl!

Okay, I have made this several times now, but I just made it again this week and I can tell you, it is PERFECTION!  Don't change anything, just follow the recipe and you won't, you CAN'T go wrong!

This was exceptional!!! Made it today and I did tweak it a bit. I cooked it in a Dutch oven at 250° for approximately 8 hours. I used a can of Yuengling and a can of beef broth and it was almost covered with the broth!!!!!! Tender...  tasty... moist... oh my, I was looking for my mama so I could slap her ;-) lol. Going back to the store to get another... it'll be slightly bigger this time :-)!!

I will fix this again!!! I won't ever boil corned beef again, this is the best corned beef I've ever had. Very easy to fix and it was so moist and delicious. I will add a little extra water the next time, other than that I wouldn't change a thing in this recipe. I cooked a 3 lb. corned beef for 4 hours and it was very tender and juicy. I browned mine using Kitchen Bouquet, and the onions literally melted down into the liquid, so darn good, lol... Can't wait to fix this dish again.

An addendum to my first review 
I did boil with the seasoning pack out some of the salt solution for 20 min.I followed everything else BUT used a 16 ounce Heineken,with a 1/4c of the boiled water because my pan was kinda big.Your MUST  double wrap if using anything other than HEAVY DUTY FOIL! SEALING the pan completely!
DO NOT CHECK THE OVEN OR PAN FOR 6 hours.No fail!

Followed the recipe except for using a 3.5 pound corned beef and cooking it in an electric roaster for 5 hours, and it came out great!

I made this exactly as the directions recommended and it was AMAZING!  Hands down, the best corned beef I've ever made.  My husband and 21 year old son LOVED it.  I'm never making corned beef any other way again.

Family loves this recipe.  I had to use a slow cooker on high for 5-6 hours and I put tin foil over top of opening before put lid on and did not peek until done.  Made this twice and it was so tender and tasted great.   Thanks for recipe.

This was outstanding.  This is our go to recipe for broiling corned beef now.   I'd say it's a bit non-traditional.  Almost has a more "meaty" flavor.  It was so tender that even after resting for an hour it shredded when I cut it.

If you're not crazy about corned beef (like me), but your husband loves it, you'll be thrilled with this recipe. I don't change anything and it really is good and my husband just loves it.  It's also great for sandwiches.  I've made it a number of times and will NEVER go back to boiled corned beef again.  I gave it 5 stars because, while I still don't care for corned beef, at least this is one recipe I will at least eat and hubby is crazy about it.

Amazing! I bought my first corned beef a while back, and did the typical boiling method. We were all disappointed. I decided to give it one more shot with this recipe and WOW! My family ate every last morsel. I threw in a few more onions (you can never use too many onions I believe) and about 1/3 cup water to create a nice gravy. Thanks for a winner!

I made this recipe instead of my usual one.  The old one is good, this one is great.  The cut of the corned beef is especially important.  I purchased the flat cut and with this recipe A1.  
              Enjoy   California

Excellent!  I made it with a slightly under 4 pd corned beef brisket.  It turned out super delish and extremely tender. Great corned beef brisket recipe.  Kudos to the chef ;-)

Crazy fabulous. Like one other reader I used to Dutch oven. Seared it only three minutes on each side to avoid the complaint of others that it was"crispy". Only had 3 1/4 pound beef so I adjusted the time down to four hours. I also added a half cup of beer to
the container. 
was extremely hot and evaporated some liquid on contact.. Some people ask how do you cook the rest of the vegetables? In my case I lightly steamed them. The corned beef has so much flavor.... also there is a great amount of sauce with this method....dream something!

I had 2 sandwiches from this and then it was gone...eaten by the teenager. And so you know how successful this was: I eat a corned beef sandwich maybe once every 2 or 3 years. Until this. I don't have roasting pan so I just used my cast iron Dutch oven and a cooling rack. I used Newcastle for the liquid and a bit more than called for. My brisket was grass fed and cured in-store and had less liquid, so this worked well. I also used Dale's seasoning instead of kitchen browning sauce...just what I had on hand. Very tender and much more flavorful than traditional corned beef. I have already purchased another to cook tomorrow. Thanks, Maui girl, for the great recipe!

Best corned beef.  Making it for the 3rd time tonight.  Never liked corned beef until I found this recipe.  After cooking last time in foil, I put the corned beef and all the juices in a large slow cooker and cooked the cabbage on top.  My guests loved it and said it was the best corned beef they had ever had.  All volunteered to come back the next time I make it.  (They are not invited tonight, I want some leftovers!!)

I have to admit I was not going to get a corned beef this year.  The last several years I have boiled, or crock potted them with less than desirable results.  Always came out dry and stringy. I saw this recipe and reviews and thought well I’d give it a try.  Oh my!! It is the moistest flavorful corned beef I have ever had! Outstanding! I did get a quality flat cut 2lb roast, browned it, no browning sauce, heavy on the ground pepper, lots of garlic and onions, ¼ cup water in a flat covered dutch oven. Cooked 4 hours at 275 and was perfect! Sliced like a dream, moist and so, so good. Thank you for the great technique to make fantastic corned beef!

Wow, this is the first time I've ever attempted to make corned beef brisket and this recipe is fantastic!  Our neighbors have an annual St. Pat's party and my husband loves corned beef so I thought I'd try my hand at it even though I'm not a fan. This is the best corned beef I've ever had and my husband agrees.

Perfect! Tender and juicy. No more boiled meet for us. I was concerned about browing the meat first so I only did about 4 minutes per side. Next time I will do 5-8 minutes as written. I used 3-4 Tbsp of water because I was concerned 2 Tbsp was not enough, and it was plenty. I did not have browning sauce so I used black pepper as others suggested. I also added half the season packet to the bottom of the roaster and the other half on top of the meat/onions/garlic (fat side up). I did not have a rack, but it wasnt a problem. I put 2 layers of tin foil over the roaster and sealed it tightly then added the roaster lid. As the recipe submitter mentioned in a rating comment "The trick is not to peek" let your 5 lb corned beef cook for 6 hours, remove from oven and let it sit coverred for 30 minutes.

I just made it today as we are celebrating St Patrick's Day early. My husband said it's the best corned beef that I have ever made....and we've been married for 32 years. And it was so easy that I was afraid I must have been doing something wrong! I only had gravy master so I used that, and I used a pan with a lid and no foil. It sliced beautifully, held its shape but was still fork-tender. The only different thing that I did was to soak the meat in cold water for a couple of hours to get some of the salt out.I will NEVER boil a corned beef again!

This is the best corned beef briscuit I've ever had. Added a touch more water, used beef Better than Boullion for the browning agent and roasted garlic/vidalia onion slices for topping. Moist and tender. Absolutely amazing!

I made this today!  I actually cured a beef brisket myself in brine and spices over the past week, and this morning I looked up how to cook it, found this recipe.  Braising is MUCH better than boiling!  I will never boil another brisket.

Amazing!   Follow these instructions and you will be pleased.  I did add a few touches to it, used a couple tbsp of beer and merlot in place of the water. Also I threw in some potatoes, carrots and celery just to add some ready-made veggies with it.  The meat falls apart and tastes incredible.

OMG!!! as my kids would say, this dish was AWESOME! Corned beef has never been on the top of the list for my family but I found one on sale and thought I'd give it one more try. I'm glad I tried your recipe, I usually braise my chuck roast never tried corned beef, glad I did. The flavor was outstanding and oh so tender!! Thank you for sharing :)

No pot, so seared it in the oven. No rack, just laid it in the pan. No time, so did 350 degrees for 4 hours. Still perfect and amazing.

This was great. Don't waste your time boiling again. It's easy, low mess and very foolproof. That makes this a real winner.

I made this a few days after St. Patrick's day and enjoyed it very much!  I love how flavorful and tender it was.  Also, it was quick to throw together!  Will definitely make it again!  Both my hubby and son liked on a pretzel bun!

Our family loved corned beef and we always make it the traditional way of boiling it. I will never boil it again. This was the best tasting brisket we have ever had. There were no left overs for sandwiches or anything! I made it for St. Patrick's Day and it's a couple of weeks later and we have one in the oven again right now. I can't wait to eat! Thank you so very much for sharing this recipe! A new favorite in our house!!

Most awesome! Made exactly as directed. Even with the 2 tbsp. of water, which was a bit scary. It works people. For those who found it too dry, I assume it was not tightly covered in foil. A must to keep in the steam. Kitchen Bouquet. Who knew they still make that? Reminds me of Mom in the sixties. It made stuff "fancy". :) This is melt in your mouth, falling apart goodness. I roasted potatoes for the last two hours being the temp was so low. Just olive oil and herbs de provence. And shredded brussel sprouts with bacon. Yum.

I wasn't sure about this because some said it was dry. So I was scared because my "flat" was only 3 pounds. I followed the instructions except for the time, I only cooked for 4 hrs. and checked at 3 hrs, and tasted it at 3 seemed ok but let sit in the hot oven ( shut off ) for the last hour. OH MY was it good. I don't know if it was the method or the kitchen bouquet but I was very impressed  and my husband ( who really doesn't like corn beef except on sandwiches)loved it! so did my friend who had dinner with us. No one used any mustard and there were no leftovers! I wanted to try something different and I'm glad I did! I also did Colcannon.

I was worried about trying a different method to cook Corn beef because I was perfectly happy with the traditional method.  However, based on all the excellent reviews I had to try it.  I am glad I did!  Easier than boiling, if that is possible.  I didn't have a roasting pan, so I did the triple aluminum foil method.  After braising in the pan, wrapped it in foil three times and laid on the baking sheet.  Baked in the oven for 5 hours at 275.  The meat was amazing, so so so tender.  My kids even loved it.  As for the side vegetables (cabbage, carrots, potatoes.  I saved the juice and seasoning packet from the meat and added it to a large pot of boiling water.  Added the veggies and cooked for about 20 minutes.  Not the best way, but still very good.  Clearly the meat is the shining star in this dish!  I will certainly make Corn beef more often because it's just so easy and really the best tasting!

This is a wonderful recipe and I am so glad to have found it! I, too, did as some others and added 1/2 cup water instead of only the 2 Tbs. 
After the roast cooked about 4 hours, I checked it and tasted it, finding it was pretty salty. So, I removed and discarded the large flap of fat and removed the roasting rack from the pan, setting the meat directly on the bottom.
Then, I cut 6 red potatoes in half and tossed them inside along with a bunch of peeled and halved carrots. 
I then added enough water to cover everything about 1/2-way.
I recovered the pan with foil and returned to the oven, but lowered the temperature to 250 degrees.
After two hours, I pulled everything out and placed in a serving bowl. I poured the broth through a sieve and poured it into a fat separator. I poured the defatted liquid into a large pan and put my cut-up cabbage in it to cook, which gave it a lot of flavor.
I really did enjoy this wonderful meal and am going to give some to my neighbor. Thank you for sharing this amazing Irish dish! It's a keeper!

Very flavorful and very moist! So delicious, I did follow the recipe except I tripled wrapped the corned beef in foil after searing it and placed it on the rack. I will be making this  from now on instead of boiling. Thanks a lot for sharing this, mauigirl!

This is my first time making a corned beef brisket and I'm happy my friends from the buzz recommended this recipe.   I followed Baking Nana's advise and triple-foiled the brisket.   It was fork tender and tasted wonderful.   I had a small brisket of 2.5 pounds and this was done in 4 hours.   I don't think you could over-cook it using this method.   Thanks for helping make my first brisket perfect!

EXCELLENT!  I knew a snow storm was coming so I purchased a corned beef brisket to make as a comfort meal.  The snow storm came but I had forgotten to get "Kitchen Bouquet" and aluminum foil.  As there was no going to the store, I substituted Yoshida's Original Gourmet sauce.  I wasn't sure whether to go with my clay pot or slow cooker since I didn't have any foil.  (They both have lids).   Searching through the reviews, I saw that mis7up had success with the slow cooker so I chose that.  (thank you mis7up!)   It certainly couldn't have turned out any better.  I also sliced the corned beef thin with my electric slicer so I can use it for sandwiches.  Thank you Mauigirl for such a wonderful EXCELLENT recipe!  It's a keeper!!

I don't have a good roasting setup so tried the triple wrapped foil. I wasn't sure about the method so I split a 4lb brisket in half and did 2lb for this and 2lb easy homemade pastrami. I wasn't sure how long to leave them in since the size was so small but 3.5 hours wasn't done enough. I wasn't counting on it taking the full time and had to run an errand. I turned off the oven and left the briskets for about 45 min then turned it back on and continued cooking (the oven temp had gone down to 150). It was in the oven for a total of 6 hours and very tender. Bad timing on my part but good results for us. Other than the addition of garlic flavor, I'm not sure I could notice any difference than when I use the seasoning packet and using other methods. I had to slice it sooner than I'd have liked so it just fell apart, no slices. The other brisket sliced fine after resting in the fridge overnight.

delicious. I rinsed the beef very well and used garlic powder, salt and pepper before browning.  Added 1 C of water,onions and garlic and covered with foil before cooking @ 300.  The best corned beef I have eaten.

All I can say about this recipe is AWESOME!  I have never liked the boiled corned beef... (I love corned beef) and have always done it in the oven, but this is the one that tops the charts!  I did not have any browning sauce, so just peppered it as some reviewers said, then after browning the brisket, brushed some horseradish mustard with a dab of honey mixed in on it, scattered the onion and garlic slices on it, covered it tightly and put it in the oven for 3 1/2 hrs (only had a 2 1/4 lb flat cut brisket).  It turned out to die for!  Will never do corned beef any other way again!

I didnt have Browning Sauce so used about 1/2 T of vegetable base on each side and lots of salt and pepper before browning. Added carrots last hour.  It was amazing! Will never boil again!

I didn't have the Kitchen bouquet so I used black pepper as other reviews suggested. Everything else was followed exactly. This meat was so flavorful and tender there was very little leftovers. Made with Diana's colcannon recipe from this site and it was comfort food heaven!

This is the first time writing a review, I made this dish for hub on St. Paddy's day. I added veggies and cabbage last hour of cooking. He gave me a big thumbs up and asked me to cook another one for hash. I will never boil corned beef ever again. Thank you Mauigirl for a great easy recipe!!

I don't cook a lot of corned beef and I'd never used browning sauce before, but it was easy and turned out well.  I threw in carrots and potato's the last 2 hours and then made a grayvy for them with the beef drippings.  The family was happy and some of them LOVED it.

I made this today and I have to say this is the best corned beef dinner I have ever had!  It was so tender and tasty, I made 2 and we didn't have any leftovers for sandwiches. I'm sorry for all the years of boiled corned beef...never again!

I follow this recipe to a T. It came out  tender and very juicy. I did not use the seasoning packet that the corn beef provided. All I used was the browning sauce in a cast-iron skillet. I seared it on each side for 6 minutes. Then I used a roasting pan filled the bottom with water just until a little bit below the rack. I wrapped the whole pan with aluminum foil 3x.

I made a 2lb Cornbeef brisket using this method/recipe.  It was exceptionally good.  I only braised it for 4 1/2 hrs due to the small size.  Will do this again!

I made this corned beef brisket, today, exactly as the recipe stated to do, but used a 4lb brisket and cooked it for 5 1/2 hrs. The meat was incredibly tender and done to perfection! We used the meat for Reuben sandwiches; they were incredible!

PERFECT! We have tried this recipe many times and have changed it to fit our likes, but that doesn't mean to change it- because it really is superb. We stopped using the onions or the garlic  (I am on a FODMAP Diet) and this comes out amazing.  This is such an excellent option and a much leaner version than cooking corned beef in water (Which tends to be extremely greasy). I grew up where everyone threw everything in one pot and let it all cook together. We cook everything separate now (We do not like our cabbage and carrots tasting like greasy corned beef water). After being diagnosed with Irritable Bowel Disease I had to change a LOT of how we cooked and what we ate. This is a great recipe that I didn't have to tweak too much. SLAINTE!

Two tablespoons of water isn't enough.  I made the recipe once with that amount of water and the corned beef was dry.  The next time I put in half a cup of water and had tender, moist beef.  That corned beef I would rate at four to four and a half stars.

My new go to for corned beef brisket.  Delightfully moist and flavorful. I soaked brisket overnight in water, changed water and soaked all day before drying off and following recipe. Took extra saltiness away and left a very flavorful instead of one that is too salty.

Wish I could give this 10 stars!! I have NEVER been able to pull off a corned beef...ever!  I’ve tried pressure cookers, crockpots, stovetop, instapot...but no matter how high the recipe was rated, the meat always turned out chewy, dry or rubbery.  Didn’t matter if it was flat-cut, point-cut or if I sliced it with or against the grain....it just always sucked.  I’ve been so disappointed by this meat so many times that every year,  I swear off trying it again...until the next year lol.  Just couldn’t accept the fact there was a dish I could NOT make and it baffled me at how awful it would turn out no matter what I tried.  

SO glad I tried again this year and that my 10+ year search is finally over with THIS recipe!!  All the recipes I’d tried used a lot of liquid (water/beer/broth) because that’s how I thought you were “supposed” to cook corned beef, but now I realize that THAT was the problem.  The difference in the flavor and the TEXTURE of the meat when you don’t “boil” it is remarkable. 

I followed the recipe exactly (except I didn’t measure the Kitchen Bouquet or water).  Seared it in a big dutch oven, put a small rack under the meat, added a little water, threw in the onions & garlic, put the glass lid on tight and didn’t touch it at all for 5 1/2 hours (3 1/2lb flat cut on 275*).  

UNBELIEVABLE!  Could not believe that I made it OR that it was such an easy recipe.  It came out fall-apart tender, flavorful, moist...just amazing! Served it with the Colcannon Bake recip

Just made this for dinner, and I will NEVER make it any other way!  I didn't have Browning sauce, so brushed the beef with some worsestershire sauce.  Other than that, I made it exactly as written!  We had a small brisket, almost 2 lbs.  Cooked for 3 hours, and I didn't need a knife to cut it once on my plate!  Thanks so much for this recipe...easy, peasy!

I've never had a corned beef that tasted this good. I followed the recipe exactly, but my beef was 2.5 lbs instead of 5.  The beef made good sandwiches too. The corned beef did not have that "watery" taste that I'm used to from cooking it in tons of liquid in the crock pot. Very flavorful., and cooked texture was much better then liquid cook type. This is my new corned beef recipe, and so easy to make. Thank you Mauigirl!

This was by far the most tender corned beef I've ever made, and the searing really helps with presentation, but I found it too salty. I'm guessing braising the beef doesn't remove as much salt as boiling does... next time I make I'll desalinate in cold water as I do when smoking pastrami. Then it will be a 5* dish.

This recipe was great. The flavor the Kitchen Bouquet gave was on point. I made this in my fave cast iron, which I found to be great for temp evenness andbamazing browning. 
Slight alterations: Deglazed meat after browning with 1 cup beef stock to aid in braising.

The flavor was delicious and so tender. Not at all dry.

I whipped up a banging Pan Jus with the meat drippings, beef stock and fresh herbs. 

Will DEFINITELY make again.

I followed the recipe as stated except I had a 6 lb. roast. I cooked it 6 hrs, again as stated and it was pretty much shredded. We were unable to slice it. That being said, it was a very tasty roast and I would do it this way again, although I might cut back on the time by 1 hour.

Best ever!!! I never liked corned beef until I tried this recipe.
Yes, I did make some changes.. I soaked the brisket overnight in water to reduce salt. I didn't have kitchen bouquet so I used Lawry's seasoned pepper. I put onions, garlic cloves, carrots and no salt chicken bone broth in a dutch oven with the corned beef and baked at 275 for about 6 hrs. It came out perfect and delicious!

If you want concentrated flavor, this recipe will give it.  The meat was tender-- not soggy as with boiling or crock-potting it.  Delicious!

Oh wow this was the best corned beef I’ve ever eaten. Didn’t have browning sauce so I used Worcestershire sauce and pepper. Browned in a Dutch oven on the stove. Then removed roast and placed a whole diced onion and 8 cloves rough dice garlic in the Dutch oven. Sautéed a little then put the roast back in on top of the vegetables. Placed cover on Dutch oven and cooked 3 pound roast for 4 hours. Absolutely scrumptious!!!

Remove brisket from oven and put on a plate.  After brisket cools for ten minutes, cover to keep warm.  Pour braise liquid into a  cast iron skillet-add potatoes and carrots-cover and cook at 400 deg. for 30 minutes. Add cabbage to the top and cook 30 minutes more. 

I used small red potatoes.  Yum.

We made this for St. Patty's Day yesterday and it was, without question, the most flavorful, moist and tender we've ever had -- at home or from a deli. No kidding. We made two slight adjustments to the steps. 1) We soaked the corned beef in cold water for 24 hours in advance of the braising, hoping to pull out some of the excess salt.  And 2) Because we had just a 2.75 pound cut, we roasted at a slightly lower temp: 260. Braised in the oven according to the recipe - tightly wrapped under two layers of foil and left untouched for five hours.  It was perfect!

I've been making corn beef and cabbage for years. Usually boiling or by crock pot. After this recipe, I'll never go back. This was the most awesome corn beef we have every had. Super moist and flavorful! At the 3 rd hour I added potatoes and carrots. At 4.5 hours I added quartered cabbage.  All of it turned out perfect!! Thank you for a great recipe!

A+++, couldn't find browning sauce, so tried A1 steak sauce and Worcestershire sauce, neither of which did a great job at browning the meat but did season the meat. Used Guinness Stout instead of water. Didn't have a roasting rack small enough for for my pot, so I used balled up aluminum foil to keep the meat above the liquid. I trimmed the fat ahead of time and put the fat on top of the brisket/veggies during cooking. Totally awesome! Lean and tender. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Excellent! Moist and tender! The slow cooking did the trick. I have made corned beef for many years, but have had problems with it drying out by the time it is tender. This was perfect! Used a 3# flat cut corned beef and cooked it as directed at 275° for approximately 4 hours. Added the cabbage and carrots in the last hour. Great flavor!

Made as posted and it came out tender, juicy and full of flavor. Only thing I wished I could of fixed was the saltiness of it. That’s the one advantage of boiling it with the cabbage and potatoes as it’s absorbed by the veggies. Will definitely make again. 
I wrapped beef in foil and saved the seasoning package and broth from beef (>4cups) to add to the veggies and boiled separately.

Oh my!  The best corned beef I've made!  I have boiled, baked and pressure cooked.  I didn't have Kitchen Bouquet so I made my own, but this turned out great!  I served with colcannon, braised carrots and sauteed cabbage.

This is my new favorite corned beef recipe. Delicious food!  I didn’t change much of anything. I did not use a browning sauce. Spices work well. Low and slow is a perfect way to get a great result.

Not CORNED beef.  This was brisket.  Silly me for thinking that somehow this was going to become corned beef.  I make a great brisket, I've used the recipe for years and it calls for all kinds of flavors, mostly from Heinz 57 sauce & Worcestershire sauce.  This was plain, plain, plain brisket.  Any taste came from the onions and garlic.  I'll stick with my recipe and when I want corned beef I'll use pickling spices like corned beef is supposed to have.

I trimmed off most of the fat and then made it exactly as given except I wrapped it tightly in two layers of heavy duty aluminum foil and placed it on a baking sheet. Hands down the best corned beef i've ever had! My fiance', who isn't a big fan of corned beef, not only went back for seconds, he's been snacking on the leftovers all evening. I'll never make corned beef any other way.

My family loved this! I wasn’t able to sear the meat, so I just threw it a casserole dish, brushed on the browning sauce and added the onions and garlic. I didn’t have a rack to fit the dish, so I didn’t use one. I put on a tight-fitting lid and popped it in the oven for about five hours. It was moist, tender, and incredibly delicious!

This is my new preferred corned beef cooking method. It was awesome! so tender and flavorful. Small tweak...I threw some baby carrots and quartered red potatoes in the mix. Next time, I am going to soak it for a bit as suggested because it was a little salty. After it was done, I used the liquid, chicken broth and water (1/3, 1/3, 1/3) to cook some cabbage. Best St Patty's Day meal ever! Thanks for the terrific recipe :)

I used spicy mustard and brown sugar instead of browning sauce.  I also used about 2 cups of water.  My family was going nuts for it and they want it again later this week.

So flavorful.  Made it today (St. Patrick's Day) for the first time.  Made 2 of them using this recipe and the third was made the traditional way by boiling with potatoes, cabbage and carrots (just to get some added flavor into the veggies ).  The ones made with this recipe were a hit.  Flavorful, easy to make, and oh, so yummy.  Meat wasn't stringy or chewy.  Will definitely use this recipe any time I make corned beef again.

Fabulous! Yes, I made a couple of tweaks out of necessity.  But wow!  First I didn’t have Kitchen Bouquet but I had some Picka Peppa - Jamaican pepper sauce. Brushed that all over the brisket before browning.  Gave it a great flavor. Second, my garlic had seen better days so I substituted some jarred minced garlic. Rubbed it on top of the brisket then laid the onion slices across the top before putting in the oven.   Served it with Brussels sprouts - hey, they’re like baby cabbages.  Like I said, WOW. This is going to be served more than just St Patrick’s Day. Yummy!

I couldn't find an affordable 5 lb brisket that was in my preferred cut. So I used the biggest I could get. 3.25 lb. 
I made some brown sauce and rinsed off the brisket.
I don't have a roasting pan, so I used my Dutch Oven. Which? Possibly the best idea, no need for the foil!
I drizzled about half of the oil on the bottom of the pan.
Then put down a bed of onions
Placed the brisket, drizzled the brown sauce until the entire brisket was coated and flipped it to put the fat cap up.
Then I sprinkled the roast with the seasoning packet *it's just not the same without the coriander...*
Placed more onions on top of all of that.
Set it in the oven for about 4 hours.

 I placed the thermometer and it registered at about 200 degrees. Clearly it was done.

Now I swear to you, this was the most succulent, most tender, most flavor packed brisket I had ever had in my ENTIRE LIFE! SWEET 6 POUND 8 OZ BABY JEEBUS! 

I can't recommend this recipe enough. Boiling is out!

By far the best Corned Beef recipe I’ve made.  Very simple and delicious!  I could have sliced it with a butter knife and it was fall apart tender.  The caramelized onion and garlic was a bonus.  This will be my “go to” recipe!

Absolutely delicious.  If you want to add an extra element of depth, substitute bacon grease for the veggie oil.  (I used the same griddle I previously baked bacon on). Yum!!!!!!

We made this to go in our home made Zingerman's reuben sandwiches.  Wow!  Never have we ever had corned beef quite like this.  As my wife sliced it for the sandwiches, soft tender juicy pieces kept falling off and we couldn't stop eating them.  She prepared it exactly as the recipe called for.  She wrapped it in double foil (with the kitchen bouquet,  onions, garlic and 2TB water) and placed it right on the oven rack.  It was a 5lb roast and we cooked it for 6 hours.  Turned the oven off and kept it in another 15 min.  Took it out and let it set for 10 minutes.   We expected it to be good after all the rave reviews, but somehow it was still shocking when we tasted it.  The reuben sandwiches were the best we ever tasted.  Thanks for posting.

Most flavorful corned beef brisket I’ve ever made.  No more boiling. I used some of the juice to flavor the water in which I boiled the vegetables: unpeeled potatoes, carrot, cabbage.

I washed the brisket well and used a Memphis style BBQ rub for seasoning. Icooked it to 195 and it was awesome.

I have made this a few times now. I usually don’t have all the correct ingredients. However, just the way of cooking this makes it so much better than the regular boiling method. This turns out a super tender, well flavored beef!

I made this for dinner last night and LOVED it.  This will be the only way I do corned beef forever.   I browned the corned beef (but didn't use the kitchen bouquet) and put the meat, onions, garlic and about 6 tablespoons of beef broth in foil and tightly sealed. I added another piece of foil across the top to make sure of a tight seal.  Put in oven and didn't open until after 6 hours.   Took meat out of foil packet - put on cutting board and covered with a foil for about 15 mins before cutting and it was perfect.

This was fantastic, if a bit overly salty.  Next time I'll try soaking it in water first. I made sure to cook it fat cap up. It sliced well for sandwiches the next day.

I will definitely make again. I think I forgot the added water. It was a little crispy on the outside and surely on the bottom. Leftovers were great for corned beef melts on sourdough. Start it early enough and it could actually be the plan.

Used a sous vide torch to brown it. Sprinkled the peppercorns on top. Increased heat to 325 to speed up things.

Turned out great. Very tender. Unfortunately the brisket was so salty we could not eat it. Will try again but will soak brisket for several days in the refrigerator.  Cooking for 5 hours made the house smell yummy.

This is the best recipe for corned beef ever!  It is my go to because it's so easy and so darned good!  My only complaint is that there is never any leftover to make corned beef hash, it's so good my husband eats half of a brisket while he is slicing it!  The only changes I have ever made are that sometimes I cook in a dutch oven or double wrapped in foil.  Don't mess with this recipe, it's perfect!!

I followed everything as instructed except I baked it for 8 hours. It was very tender and juicy. I did not remove the foil until it was done and that really helped.  I added water to the bottom of the pan too. My husband and 15 year old son really enjoyed it. They both ate themselves into a corn beef coma. Smh!

Very good. I rubbed each side of a 3.15 lb. corned beef with about a tap. of Kitchen Bouquet and  brazed it in my Lodge cast iron roaster, 5 min each side. Added rack, onion, garlic and 1/4 cup water. Covered tightly with heavy duty foil and secured lid tightly. I cooked it at 275 for 4 1/2 hour.  If I was to cook a smaller piece of meat I would only cook for 4 hours. 
In my crockpot I used the seasoning packet with chicken broth. I cooked the  potatoes and carrots for 1 hour then added cabbage and cooked for an additional  2. It all came together beautifully and the corned beef was amazingly moist and could be shredded  with a fork.  I think covering it tightly and cooking it for the right amount of time per pound is key here to a moist outcome.

D-freakin' licious!  Okay. So my first attempt at the "crock pot" version of corned beef was an epic fail, I had to redeem myself. The corned beef was non-edible, in the trash it went. Then I found this recipe. I learned the hard way corned beef needs low and slow to break down the fibers. I had a 2 -1/2 lb roast so I started with three hours at 275, then for the last hour I raised the temp to 300 and it was PERFECTION. I didn't have a rack the size of my pan so I made a rack out of sliced onions and placed the roast on top. It sliced like butta and the taste was superb!  I will NEVER again boil corned beef. Grazi Mauigirl!

It is good but seems to need something more. I remove the fat cap on the meat before cooking. Keeping it lean.  I will play with it until I find a spice that works. Nice start...

The corned Beef was quite tough.
We were able to slice it, so dinner
was not a total failure.
I followed directions, but it just
was tough and dry.
Will not use the recipe again.

Not impressed.  Cooking time was too long; meat was burned and dry.  Any juice that might have been in the beef to begin with was a blackened mess at the bottom of the pan at the end.  Will not be making this again.

This is exactly what I was looking for.  Although ihave to agree more water is needed at the very least you must check it after 3 hours,. It was Delish the first time my bf was bummed when we ran out. So I purchased another one and cooked it today! He said it was the best he’s had and it was the first time I cooked corned beef. So simple too!! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

Amazingly delicious. Followed recipe exactly. Because i had a smaller piece of  corn beef (about 3lbs) I reduced the cooking time to 4.5 hrs and left it in turned off oven for another 30 minutes. Perfect outcome. Never going to cook corn beef any other way!

I used a flat cut (now the ONLY cut I will buy) and baked in my Le Creuset for 6 1/2 hours and it was delicious! Just had the sliced corned beef as Ruebens and was one of the best Ruebens I’ve ever had! Will definitively only used this method from now on!

Without a doubt, the best corned beef my husband and I have ever had.  Absolutely no need to change this recipe unless you have a smaller roast, then just cut down the time.

This is the only way to make corned beef! After years of dried out flavorless slow cooker corned beef I wanted to try something different. This recipe is easy and perfect. Don't change a thing! The meat comes out so incredibly tender, juicy, and flavorful. It just fell apart as I sliced it. And the leftovers make amazing sandwiches. Tips: I placed the meat fat side up on rolled up pieces of foil instead of a roasting pan and tightly covered the entire pan with foil. Do not check it halfway through! Keep it sealed. Before slicing, scrape the fat layer off the top unless you like it extra fatty.

Excellent Corned Beef recipe! I added onions,  carrots, celery and red bell peppers. Also added a little cornstarch slurry to thicken the gravy a bit. It was fantastic over mashed potatoes!

I thought browning it brought out a lot more flavor, but 6 hours was too long in the oven. Fortunately I caught it before it dried out totally.

The corn beef was very tasty. Definitely will be using this recipe moving forward. Why the 4 stars...it was very salty. Bought the corned beef from Costco. Never has it tasty salty but probably since I was using a crock pot recipe with potatoes so the potatoes soaked up the salt. I will have to follow the suggestion from original post and soak in water for a couple of days to hopefully help with the salt content. Otherwise, it just fell apart and melted in your mouth. When mixed with the mashed potatoes, it was perfect.

I've made this twice. Once by covering the roasting pan with foil and the second time by wrapping the meat in foil as instructed in the follow up tips by the submitter  Both were equally great. Less mess with wrapping the beef. Meat comes out tender, but firm enough to slice. which we like better than when it falls apart. I didn't use browning sauce because I don't use it. Baking is definitely our cooking method now. 
I decided to roast my cabbage, potatoes and carrots while the meat was resting for about 40 minutes. I left the wrapped meat in the baking pan and covered the whole pan with foil and the meat was still hot when we cut it to serve. Thank you for the super easy and great recipe!

This came out fantastic.  I didn't have the browning sauce so i just seared the beef in beef stock.  I cut some potatoes in half and put them under to support the beef. (The potatoes came out great and served them as well.)   Cooked for about 5 hours (had 5 lbs)  and it was ready.  Had to transport it to family dinner at my dad's so i took the suggestion of another reviewer and put  mustard and brown sugar on it and stuck in 200 degree oven when we arrived.   Kept it in for about 45 minutes while i made onion,cabbage, and noodles (my Hungarian recipe).    The mustard and brown sugar gave it a nice dark color and tasted fantastic without over-powering the flavor of the meat.   I will make this again and again.

I will never make corned beef any other way!  Like others, I didn't have Kitchen Bouquet, so rubbed it with pepper.  I used about 1/2- 1 C of water and when beef was done, took it out and covered loosely with foil then added potatoes.  After about 1/2 hour, added cabbage for about 15 minutes.  Delicious...thank you for sharing. Bought a big aluminum roasting pan and used one of the toast oven racks.  NO cleanup!!

Delicious!  If you follow the directions the corn beef will turn out perfectly! This was a new twist on corn beef and truly the best version I’ve had in a long time. The corn beef was tender and very flavorful.  I can’t wait to have the leftovers tomorrow!

This was the best corned beef I ever made. ! It was juicy and tender and the flavor is amazing! What a difference from boiling where the meat would get tough and stringy.  I will never boil corned beef again!

I followed recipe exactly except for one change which was removing the brisket about 20 min earlier(5hrs 40 min) but it probably wouldn’t have made a difference.  Best I’ve made and will always use this method.

I made two, 2 1/2-3lb, in one roaster. No modifications, except to add potatoes in the last half hour or so, and more onions and garlic because mmm. It was great! It was supposed to last the whole week for dinner but we finished it in a couple of days so I had to go back to the store and get two more. Made it again during the week. I added some celery and carrots with the potatoes the second time. Oh, and a little bit of allspice. I froze one for a future dinner. I will never boil a corned beef again!

I was a bit uncertain about this recipe but took a chance anyway and boy am I glad!! The kids loved it and they usually just barely touch it. It was tender and not a bit stringy. Great flavor ( I worried about not using the seasoning packet). It was delicious!! I did wrap it three times in foil to hold in the juice and flavor .I had at least 1 cup of juice in the foil so no worries about dry . Everyone voted it the best they had ever had and please to use this again. By the way  cooked it in an electric roaster for 4 hours turned off the heat and about an hour after that,  sliced it. Still very warm. Also no juice in the roaster so no clean up!! Bonus.Thanks for the recipe never would have tried it but for the rave reviews that were well deserved.I made it as described.

Excellent!!!  For those “complainers” a couple of tips - Soak the brisket in cold water to cover for a day or two in your refrigerator, changing the water a couple of times to draw out the excess salt.  I didn’t have browning sauce so rubbed a small amount of brown sugar on each side of the brisket, along with fresh ground pepper, before browning, worked like a charm.  Sprinkled the pickling spice on the bottom of the roaster along with a1/2 cup of water, a few slices of onion and garlic, with more garlic and onion on the brisket.  Placed the brisket on the roasting rack, covered the pan tightly with a double layer of foil to seal in the steam.  Cooked at 275 F for 5 hours and NEVER peaked, absolutely perfect, sliced so well and was super moist.  You keep checking it and opening the oven and it’s going to be tough and dry.

EXTREMELY tender and it would’ve garnered 5 stars if it weren’t sooooo salty.  I didn’t read the notes about leaving it t in the fridge in water for couple of days.  Had I done so, I bet it would’ve been perfect.  I will definitely try to again but this time soaking in water first

Unbelievable!!! Wow.  Don’t change a thing, she is the master of corned beef.  I put it in the oven at 275 Deg closed the door and opened it 7 hours later!  Perfection at its finest!  I took others advice and wrapped it 3 times in foil (the roaster) turned out the best!  My husband loves corned beef and said it was by far the best he had ever had.  Thank you!

Awful, at least mine was. Cannot figure what went wrong, I followed the recipe and the oven works just fine. It did not even taste as if it was cooked !  I am glad that it turned out well for others, I was so disappointed but I will make another one this weekend, doing it my old way boiling or crock pot.

I have made this many times and is far superior to the boiled dinner.  It's fork cutting tender.  The only thing I did different was cut the cooking time to 3 to 4 hours because I use a smaller cut of meat.

I've been following this corned beef recipe for 2-3 years now. The best ever! If you're making it for the first time, don't change a thing. Has anyone tried this in a pressure cooker/ Instant Pot?

I followed the directions as written except I omitted the garlic. It turned out moist and tasty. I purchased my 5 lb corned beef brisket from Costco. I rinsed it before browning but it still came out pretty salty when it was finished cooking. I think brushing it with the kitchen bouquet prior to browning is unnecessary. This is easy to prepare and pretty good. If I do another corned beef brisket again I would use the boiling method.

My corned beef turned out too dry, too tough, and too salty. I wondered if  my salted New England gray corned beef versus everyone else's red (salt and nitrate) cure factors into this. I didn't have days to soak my beef, as mauigirl, the recipe creator, suggested in a comment to those concerned about salty meat. I did let it sit in water for a couple hours today and drained and refilled it, but that clearly wasn't enough.

I'll stick to the crock pot, I wanted to try this prep after all the glowing reviews.

This recipe is delicious, but not truly a "corned beef".  Corning involves  "curing"  the  meat during the cooking process with numerous and strongly spiced water.   

I will try this recipe adding onion, garlic, black peppercorns, bay leaf and whole cloves to the braising water at the beginning of the cooktime.  I'll get back here with an updated review when I have experimented with this process. 

Thanks for a good recipe.

This recipe is great just as submitted. The me at was so tender and juicy I had to use a spatula to remove it in one piece. I will definitely make this again.

I have now made this dish several times, and each time it is as successful as the first. I have even used beer instead of water in the pan. It's still delicious, and moist, and delicious, and tender, and delicious. I haven't had one negative comment from the many family members and/or friends who have eaten it. Thanks!

Delicious recipe. The only problem is, is that the whole house smells really good for 6 hours while it’s cooking. Very tender and moist.

The BEST corned beef I've ever made, I will never make it any other way again.  My husband said he never tasted corned beef with this much flavor before....I've made it a couple times now and wouldn't change a thing.  Thank you for sharing this amazing recipe.

I used a 3 lb brisket and cut down on the others ingredients accordingly. I cooked as directed. Hands down, the best corned beef that we have had.

After many times boiling, I think this comes out slightly better and more consistent, but my favorite thing is the lower work load.  I bypass the braising and hot oil and I just put 1/2 cup of water in and heat oven to 300 and that's the entire thing.  Comes out great and so so easy to do.  Make sure that tin foil is air tight most important thing.  BTW soaking the corned beef in a pot of water for 24 hours gets rid of the excess salty taste and is closer to restaurant taste.

Wish I would have taken a picture because it was beautiful. It was very tasty. I would have given it five stars except that for some reason it was not falling apart as I would have expected after a full 6 hours of roasting on top of braising. Still, it was delicious and a million times better than the usual steamed version with the spice packet. The only thing I did different was to double the recipe and use red wine instead of water (a chef once told me never use water unless you want to water down the flavor). The taste was sensational! Brought ten pounds of it to a pot luck and came home with nothing except compliments!

I followed the recipe and surely would not prepare this again. I thought it was on the tough side. After browning  I double wrapped a 2.5 lb. corned beef then placed this a rack in a casserole pan. I placed some carrots and taters around it, added some beer in the bottom of the pan then covered the pan with foil. I baked this for 3 hours at 250 degrees and it came out tough, not tender at all.

I've made this recipe several times but I do it with a few small changes.  I like to put a few small new potatoes. carrots and a piece of celery into the water along with a seasoning of 1/4 tsp of herbs de provence, a dash of tyme and caraway seeds.  Absolutely delicious.

Great recipe.  I usually simmer corned beef and this was way better.  Followed the recipe exactly except adjusted the time because my corned beef was only  2.5 lb.  I cooked it about 3 1/2 hours without peeking and it was delicious! My husband said it was the best corned beef he ever had & he wants me to go buy another bigger one so we can have left overs the next time!  Will definitely make again.

This is a wonderful technique for corned beef. Love the recipe as it is. I've made it several times and it's a huge hit. Changed up our St. Paddy's Day meal to Reubens . Corned beef and cabbage but more delish.

This turned out great! I was afraid it wouldn't taste the same because of not using the spices but it was perfect. I used an oven bag in a roaster pan and covered it with foil as well. It produces so much liquid that I cooked my cabbage in it too. Awesome! Thank you for this recipe.

Made it for St Patty's day and it was a big success. I did triple wrap it in aluminum foil after I browned it and then topped with the garlic and onion. I also added the 2 tablespoons of water to the bottom.  I cooked it in my electric roaster at 250 f as others had mentioned. When I opened the foil, there was a lot of fluid in the package. I guess the water that it had been brined in cooked out. Anyway, it was not dry at all and almost fell apart,  it was so tender. There was very little left over, so I will be making it again just for hubby and me.

Fantastic!  We all loved it including my (not much a corned beef fan) husband.  This will be the only way I cook corned beef from now on!  I tried an experiment with the red potatoes, carrots, and cabbage which was to use the spice packet with 2 cans of chicken broth in a pot with a bit of salt and slow simmered them adding the cabbage for the last 20 minutes the roast was in the oven.  The vegetables turned out very flavorful.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe and so glad I came upon it!

With all those stars I gave it a try. Well it was the toughest corned beef I ever had. I did get a point cut corned beef instead of flat. Maybe that was the trouble. Next time I will use my crock pot as always.

Don't think about it, just do it. I made 7lb (uncooked weight) and we ate 5/7 of it between my Kiddos and the X. So much better than nasty boiled meat. I also roasted the cabbage and carrots but boiled and buttered the potatoes. 
The BEST St Paddy's meal I've had. So much so I'm thinking of changing my last name to Keller from Kelarjian, LOL!

I will never boil this brisket again.  This recipe is exactly perfect.  I actually took the briskets out of their packages and soaked them in paper towels, at room temperature for a couple of hours to get them dried before I seared the meat in a cast-iron skillet.   I oven- roasted sliced carrots and Yukon gold potatoes with cabbage and onion wedges.  I put veggies on sheet trays with oil, salt and pepper, garlic powder.  I strained the meat drippings, heated them up, and sparingly drizzled over the plate of meat and veggies.  Positively divine!

I really wanted to like this recipe - prep and clean-up are so easy. But the meat was very dry, and the veggies cooked in the drippings had such an odd taste that they were inedible. Don't know what I did wrong. I may try using the recipe again, because clean-up was *that much* easier.

Loved this way of braising the corned beef! The only tip I would add to this recipe is to soak the meat a bit before cooking to release some of the salt left from the brine. I rinsed it but it was a bit salty for me.

I had a 3lb corned beef. I followed directions exactly except I added more water as previous reviews suggested. I had a huge roasting pan so I added 1c of water. Came out fantastic! Do NOT peek or your meat will end up tough. I did not peel at all and it came out nice and tender like pot roast. Mine was done in 5 hours since it was smaller than recipe called for. I roasted cabbage, pot, and carrots separate.

Excellent.   I followed the recipe and cooked it in a cast iron Dutch oven with aluminum foil and lid to seal it well.   At five hours I added cabbage, potatoes,  carrots and another 2 T. water to the pot and an hour later the meat was tender but vegetables were not cooked.   I wrapped meat in foiled, added about 1cup of water and finished the veggies on the stove.  When done, I tossed veggies in the sauce and served it with the (still hot) meat.    Downside: we each had an extra serving.  Tomorrow I am buying corned beef for the freezer.

I was suspicious about "6hrs @275" but followed the directions and out came a 'corned-beef-log'.  I'm assuming I did something wrong, but can't figure out what. Oh well, back to the drawing board!

Turned out great.  I took the cover off and baked a half hour longer.  It's better than my boiled recipe because it slices nicely.

I brined the beef first for a couple of days, according to a different recipe.  It turned out a little too salty, but the meat itself  was incredibly tender and with the browning sauce after braising all day the flavor was fantastic!  I will have to try it without brining next time to see how much of a difference that made. The answer may be to either not brine it at all, or to dilute the solution since I only had a 3 pound piece of meat but used a recipe for 5 pounds.

I was having friends over on St. Patrick's Day to watch our favorite team in the NCAA basketball tournament.  I had already put two corned beefs in a slow cooker (the way I usually make it) when I thought I might need to cook two additional ones in order to have enough for the crowd I invited. Problem- Not enough room in the slow cooker.  I decided to try this recipe and it is a winner!  I will cook it this way from now on.  I asked my guests to try a piece that was cooked in the slow cooker and a piece cooked this way.  We then voted on our favorite method.  While the flavor was the same, the texture of the corned beef cooked this way was preferable.  It also was more pleasing to the eye.   My guests now want me to forward the recipe.

This meal turned out great. I wasn't able to find a 5lb brisket, instead I cooked a 3 lb for about 3 hours. I wrapped it in tinfoil as was suggested by the original author in the comments section. This is how corned beef will be cooked in our house from here on out.

Although I was a bit skeptical discarding the spices and juice from the packaging, this Was by far the best corned beef I have prepared. Following directions almost to the "T" I will use this recipe again. I had two corned beefs that I cooked (aprox 6#'s total). I rested the roasts on a bed of celery stalks and deglazed the pan and added aprox 1 cup of the liquid and covered tightly with foil. After 4 1/2 hrs I checked the roasts and found they were done, removed them and wrapped them in foil tightly and added my cabbage, carrots and potatoes and completed the baking, aprox another hour. 
By far the best I've made, not too salty. Wonderful, Wonderful!!

This is crazy delicious. There are a couple of tricks to make it a success. You need to use a cooking vessel that's not too large. You're only using 2 tablespoons of water so It will dry out in huge roasting pan. You also need to let it cook for the full amount of time. I took it out an hour early. The smell was so tempting I just couldn't wait, but it wasn't tender. I put it back, let it finish cooking and it was melt in your mouth good. 

Do yourself a favor and make a gravy with the drippings, some flour or corn starch and a splash of Gravy Master or Kitchen Bouquet.

My corned beefs have always been hit or miss which is why I took to allrecipes.com to find a new way to make mine for St. Patrick's Day.  In the past I've tried various recipes including inthe crockpot but it always involved boiling the corn beef in someway with the little spice packet.  I followed this recipe exactly and it came out amazing. I read many reviews including the follow up where Mauigirl says not to open the foil at all. I resisted the urge and kept the foil tightly closed. I poked a meat thermometer through the foil around 5 hours in & it was 210 degrees.  I cooked two 3 pound corned beefs and they were done in the 5 hrs. They were so tender it was unbelievable. My husband said it was the most delicious corned beef he's ever had. You didn't even need to use a knife at the table, it cut like butter with a fork. I can't say enough about this recipe, it was beyond fabulous.  I'm so glad I tried it, I would give it 10 stars if possible. Thank you!

Soaked a 4.5 pound corned beef brisket in cold water changing out the water every 45 minutes. Did this three times to pull some of the salt out. I then proceeded with the recipe to the letter.  Dried it off with paper towels; brushed all sides with Kitchen Bouquet; Browned on high heat on all sides; placed on a roasting pan rack that was inserted into a foil lined pan; covered the top with sliced garlic and onions; covered with foil and baked for 5 hours on 275.  Came out absolutely perfect. Not over or under cooked and sliced beautifully. Made a sauce from the dripping by adding peach jam and cooking down until slightly thick and poured it over the roast.  I'll never boil again!

It's amazing.  I was afraid to put just two tablespoons of water in but I followed the directions.  I can't even cut the meat because it just falls apart.  Beats boiling any day.

Delicious corned beef!  I had almost given up on making corned beef because I thought the only way to cook it was to boil it.  Was I wrong!  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out wonderful.  Easy to slice - I can't wait to make Reuben sandwiches!

Fabulous!!  I sliced it cold, and to reheat i  wrapped the beef and some  reserved cooking liquid tightly in foil, and then put that in a foil pan with a little water and covered it tightly  and then it steamed nicely in the oven, retaining its pink color. A hit in my house!

Makes an excellent corn beef, but ... 6 hours in the oven is a bit excessive as the beef crumbles apart it's so over-cooked.  Secondly, I wish someone would have warned me about the burnt on crust from onions and juice that's left on the roasting pan after baking.  It'll take an hour of soaking and scrubbing to clean it, when lining the pan with foil would have saved me the trouble.!

Made this last St. Patrick's Day for a large group of coworkers, they devoured it.  It was so tender & absolutely delicious.  They have been asking me since before Christmas if I was going to make it for them again this year. I marinated mine just because I marinate everything & I didn't use the browning sauce...didn't have any.  Can't wait to make it again.

So, it's been said by others, but I'll say it again, because it needs to be said: You can't "braise" anything with 2 Tbs. of water.

A braise involves searing whatever protein you're cooking, and then covering it over somewhere between 2/3 and 3/4 with hot, flavorful liquid. Then you cover it tightly, and cook it until it's cooked. 

This seems like an attempt at a self-basting roast, but 2 Tbs. of moisture is NOWHERE near enough to keep the meat moist and juicy by the time you've gotten it tender.

You could baste with a dilution of the browning, I suppose, though at 275 you're going to add a couple more hours to your overall time with all the opening and closing of the oven. 

Bottom line: I run a scratch kitchen in a competitive market out in Colorado - if you want fast-twitch, aerobic muscles to loosen up during cooking so the end result is a beautifully moist, tender, juicy and flavorful piece of corned beef, braise it. By that, I mean actually braise it. Don't do whatever it is that's happening here, because the result will be flavorful, but drier than it could have been, which would be sad. :(

This is a fantastic recipe I have made several times.  You need to brown the beef first.  You can do it in oil, butter or anything appropriate you have on hand. I like to place halves of 2 yellow onions on  top as well as several cloves of halved garlic and a bay leaf.  You need a bit more braising liquid.  I have used broths, white wine, red wine, beer.  Add your vegetables in large chunks, seal and enjoy several hours later.  Also gives a wonderful aroma in the house unlike boiling.

I would have been this recipes 10 stars if I could have.  I will never use another recipe again when making a brisket.  The only thing I did differently was omit the browning sauce.

Used chicken stock rather than broth to enhance the recipe.  First time I have ever made brisket and got rave reviews from my family.  No need for knives using this recipe.  The meat is fall apart tender and flavorful.  

Post another recipe this good and I'll convert to Judaism.

Made this today.  Used brown sugar, Worcestershire and vinegar as browning sauce (as another review suggested) added 1/4 water.  Wrapped tightly in heavy duty foil with garlic and onions.  Wonderful texture and taste.  Served with cabbage and black-eyed peas. Yummy.  Looking forward to Ruebens and corned beef hash!

If you follow this recipe you will make the most delicious corned beef EVER.  My suggestion is to make your own browning sauce. It's sooooo worth it.  My family was always the boiled dinner type...thanks for showing us the light! So delicious!

This was so good! By far the best way I've cooked it. I have had a corned beef in my freezer for almost a year and have been dreading the day I would make it because of the fight I would have to have to get my kids to eat it. Well today my 3 & 5 year old boys gobbled it up- no fighting at all! They are his better and faster than chicken! It was super tender and moist. Not dry at all. I was confused if I should wrap the beef in foil or the the whole pan or wrap both. Ultimately I roasted it beef covered only which turned out great. I had 3.5lbs and cooked it 275 for 5 hours. Internal temp was perfect ... slightly over 140 when I finally took it out. Next time I might cover the roast and the pan with foil and see if that makes a difference- not that I need it to but awesome recipe! Def will make again!

This recipe is super simple and easy! It doesn't take much prep time and came out delicious! I only had enough time to cook it for 3.75 hours, yet it was tasty and pretty tender. I can't wait to try it again when I have more time to let it slowly roast.

I use a locally prepared corned beef which is made from the best cuts of beef. This method is guaranteed to give you tender meat every time or you have a bad cut or beef which forever cooking will not remedy. This recipe provides moist onions and garlic to spread on your meat after cooking to give wonderful flavor. I have substituted beer for water just for fun. I also prepare my own browning sauce from coconut palm sugar. Nice touch for maximum browning.

Wonderful recipe. I did twek a little because the corn beef brisket it self can be too salty. I boiled on stove and dumped water off twice.(all the sodium goes to the top when you do that.) Then I inject with the flavors I like. Just like another person mentioned I don't use the seasoning that comes with the brisket. (I mixed a little soy,oyster,Toni seasoning,sazson seasoning and salt and pepper. I put the onions and garlic around the sides of the meat and wrapped in aluminum foil. ( I do recommend Reynolds non stick foil it works great. Thanks for the extra tips.

I was hesitant about trying this recipe as i was going to do it in the pot but thought i'd give it a try and i am soo glad i did! My family and I all LOVED this dish so much that from now on, this is the way i will make it! The only thing different i did was put 1/2 a bottle of Henry Blue Boar beer in the bottom of my roasting pan, then i put the meat in heavy duty aluminum foil (after i had browned it with the browning sauce etc) and i threw my onions and some garlic/onion powder on top of the meat then i wrapped another piece of foil around the top but left a vent. The meat was actually sitting on top of the roasting rack, in it's foil house, all inside the large roasting pan. I cooked it at 275 for about 3.5 hours. This was for a 3lb brisket. I did NOT use the seasoning packet that came with the meat. This was absolutely the best! Extremely juicy meat, very tasty and easy clean up. LOVE IT. Thanks for sharing!!!

Made this today and loved it. Had family  over for dinner & they said it was the best they ever had. As another reviewer suggested (Melissa Goff), I cooked it in my crock pot. I braised the corned beef stovetop in 1tbsp. of olive oil about 4-5 min./side with kitchen bouquet as directed. I put it in my crockpot along with the sliced onion & garlic cloves. I deglazed the braising pot with half a can of beef broth and about 12 oz. water  I poured this over the corned beef. The corned beef was only about 1/4 or less immersed in liquid. I sprinkled about half the packet over the corned beef & liquid. Cooked on high for about 2hrs and then on low for 6 hrs. more. In the meantime I prepared my cabbage & carrots. I removed the corned beef and added veggies to pot, covered and cooked. I peeled and cut potatoes into wedges & nuked them till almost done. When veggies were near ready, I mixed in the potatoes & set the corned beef on top, covered & cooked half hour. I have an old huge crock pot. It was delish. super moist but not falling apart and didn't taste like pickles, did not taste bland or dried out. A little extra work but well worth it. My sister suggested cooking the corned beef a day early, refrig,. overnight & doing veggies next day. Sounds like a plan to me. BOO HOO   NO LEFTOVERS !!!!!!

This dish certainly was easy to prepare, and was packed with flavor, though too salty.  I will make it again, but I will soak the corned beef for 24 hours in cold water. This should reduce the sodium content considerably. Otherwise, this recipe is "a keeper"!

This was delicious! My brisket was only 3.6 lb, so I cut an hour off the roasting time.  I should have decreased it a bit more, as it was so tender and moist that it fell apart when I sliced it. The scant water quantity made me leary, so I used about a cup & was glad I did.  It was almost completely gone at the end. I roasted potatoes & carrots in the drippings after removing the meat (30 mins @ 400) and they were so tasty. I agree  with the others who say they will never boil corned beef again.

Absolutely loved it! I added carrots and cabbage though, and I subbed in 2 bottles of Guinness for the water (with extra cooking time, of course). Turn out great.

This recipe exceeded my hopes and expectations.   After searing the corned beef I placed it on the rack and covered it with the onions and garlic.  Then I added quartered pieces of a cabbage head around the edge.  I put  a little bit of brown sugar on the cabbage.  I covered the whole thing with tin foil and let it slow cook for six hours.  The result was out of this world.  Not only was the corned beef and cabbage amazing, but the au jus left at the bottom of the pan was divine.    All of my guests loved this meal .. this recipe is awesome!

Made this exactly as shown.  ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE!!! .  Far and away the best corned beef my wife and I have ever tasted. We tried it on a sandwich, and we tried it with our favorite homemade horseradish sauce, but it is much better by itself, with nothing on it.  We will be making this extremely easy recipe many more times.

I always cooked a brisket in my pressure cooker, which I no longer possess. This is the first recipe I've tried otherwise and it will probably be the last. It's a keeper because of the ease of prep and delicious results. I did not have the browning sauce so I substituted Better Than Bouillon roasted beef base, using the concentrate instead of diluting. That was a mistake. Too salty. I also added an extra 2 Tbs of the broth I rendered from the browning pan because I didn't trust the directions, but that was not necessary.  I didn't have a roasting rack so I used celery ribs to elevate it and that worked well. This will be my go to recipe.

This came out horribly salty. I followed the recipe with the exception of using a roasting pan with a lid instead of foil. I followed the instructions about tossing the seasoning packet, used Kitchen Bouquet as the browning sauce.

I wanted to prepare my St. Patty's day corned beef in a different way than the traditional boiling method and chose this recipe based on reviews and the ease of preparation.  I made my own browning sauce and used coconut oil to brown the brisket.  I used 3 tablespoons of water instead of 2 and placed my 3 lb brisket on a rack in a shallow roasting pan, fat side up, topped with the sliced onion and garlic and tightly sealed the pan with some heavy duty aluminum foil.  I baked it in a 275 degree oven for 5 hours.  The corned beef was tender and very juicy!  I used the juices from the bottom of the roasting pan to cook my cabbage, onions and carrots on the stove top while the corned beef brisket was resting.  I served all of this with a side of Colcannon (mashed potatoes with cabbage and leeks - a recipe from this site).  I will be making all future corned beef briskets using this method from now on!

I bought two Harrington's flat cut corned beef briskets just to try different cooking methods. I followed the recipe as written and it was good--richer in flavor too. The meat was definitely tender and no fuss to make! However, while we liked the corned beef, we prefer the taste using the boil method.

Best corned beef I've ever had!  I forgot to make the cabbage, but we didn't even miss it!  I love the potatoes and carrots soaked in the juices.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I loved this recipe. I made 2 corned beef roasts. I boiled one and braised one. The braised roast had a much richer flavor and better texture than the boiled one.  I added about twice the liquid. I was a little late getting it in the oven so I covered it very tightly with foil and set the oven at 300 F and braised it for 3 hours. Once I put it in the oven I never touched or peeked until I was ready to get it out.  My roast was only 2.5 lbs however. So delicious, everyone loved it!

My first Corned Beef Brisket ever - (32yrs of marriage) and this was STELLAR!  I've never been a big fan and this has me wanting to get another slab of meat ASAP.  I did the triple foil  wrap after browning in oil, set it in the center of my dutch oven, poured 1/2 bottle of Guiness Lager and the seasoning packet in the bottom of the pot with the juices and oil from browning. Since cabbage and I don't get along, I added several quartered potatoes and carrots as well as sliced garlic and onion, S&P. Covered my pot with foil and placed the lid over that. into the oven at 300 for 3hrs (my roast was only 1.75ibs).  NO PEEKING.  PERFECT! Opening the foil and to my great surprise  the beef was sitting pretty in its own juices and was very succulent!

Made this tonight and it was perfect. I have already been sharing the recipe. I did add 1 cup of Beef Stock to the bottom of the pan while braising. Moist and delicious.

This was very tender & flavorful. I wasnt sure how long to cook mine since it was only 2.5 lbs but 3 hrs was perfect. I bought a store brined corn beef & followed the recipe but cut everything in half, excluded the browning sauce and used 1 c of water. I put the browned beef on a rack in a glass pan and covered it with foil. I then wrapped the whole pan in heavy duty foil and sealed it & did not open it the whole time it was cooking. Meat was flavorful & tender. I do think, however, that this is more salty than the traditional boiled recipe but much more tender. Will make again.

Was afraid to deviate from usual boiled/slow cooker method, but glad I gave it a try, because we loved it!  I went with few suggestions from reviews....added bit more water and little bit of beer, along with the seasoning packet to pan, under rack.  Covered with foil & cooked 275 for 4 hours (cut was less weight/3.5 lbs), without opening oven;  turned oven off, and left in for another hour (meat was still hot after the hour, and very moist and tender).  Sliced the cabbage & sautéed with little butter/olive oil/S&P/garlic powder, and after 10-15 mins. added some of the broth/onions/garlic from the pan, and it was great...much better than boiled cabbage!  Baby potatoes and carrots were roasted :)

This is so good it's sinful. But you have to put more water than two tablespoons or the fat and onion that hits the bottom will burn and stink. I'm sure it was a typo and they meant two cups.
Perfectly done though. So tender and juicy. Makes a hell of a ruben with the leftovers, if there are any.

I've lost count of how many times I've made this recipe since first discovering it. The first time I made it, I followed all the instructions but since then, I've skipped the browning process. Also, once prepped, I wrap the beef in heavy-duty foil and let it sit in the refrigerator for up to 12 hours before putting it in the oven to roast low and slow.

Mauigirl thanks for sharing this excellent recipe.  Never made this meat before so  tried it with a 3 1/2 pound brisket, reducing the amount of time in the oven of course.  Meat was tender and delicious.  Pureed the onion and garlic with meat drippings which made a wonderful gravy.  The tip at the end of the recipe was priceless...I definitely would have peeked!

This was the best corned beef recipe out there. I made this for my husband and he loved it. My mom also agreed it was the best she ever had. I will be making this over and over again.  I followed the recipe exact except thru in some small potatoes so they can also cook in the juice. Next time I will add cabbage with the potatoes to see how it turns out.

We cooked this today. I thought it was better than boiled. More beefy flavor. My husband said he likes it both ways... boiling it of course is much simpler. Well cooking it in the slow cooker.

Absolutely fantastic!  I made this for my husband for St. Patrick's Day this year.  It was super easy and tasted wonderful.  I prepped it the night before and had him put it in the oven the next day.  Best corned beef recipe I've ever made!

This was the best recipe for corned beef I have ever had.  I have been making corned beef the same way by either boiling it or putting it in the pressure cooker.  I think the onions and garlic gave it so much flavor and the meat was sooo tender.  What a wonderful recipe. THANK YOU! I prepared it exactly as directed with only 2 tablespoons of water and when it was done there was plenty of water/gravy in the pan. It probably could have cooked for 5 or 5.5 hours. Everyone loved it and it was so easy.  The color of the meat was so nice. It seems like when you cook corned beef in water, it loses color and flavor.

I'm not a corned beef lover...until now.  I didn't have Kitchen Bouquet, so I used  a teaspoon of Better Than Boullion vegetable stock base, and brushed it on the beef.  It was so tender that I had to shred it! I took a tablespoon of the drippings and roasted fingerling potatoes in them, and made brussels sprouts (also with a tablespoon of the drippings) and it was spectacular! Now I need a nap.

Mom and I really enjoy this! I follow Baking Nana's suggestion of triple wrapping it in heavy duty foil. I also lay a sheet of heavy duty foil on my baking sheet to catch the juices that leaked - quick and easy clean up! Thank you, mauigirl!

This turned out great! I didn't add a lot of water and the drippings in the pan were burning but it gave it a smoky flavor and it was delicious. Next time I may put some beer in the bottom of the pan or more water.

Glad I read the review on letting it cook without checking on it. We will never eat corned beef any other way. No knife required to eat it. Simply awesome, thanks

Perfecto!!! I didn't have an AR account but I made one just to rate this recipe - turned out that delicious!!!!   I substituted half Apple cider vinegar half brown sugar for the browning sauce as I avoid caramel color and other processed products.  Also added lots of freshly ground black pepper.  After searing I placed in a packet of foil with the recommended 2tbsp of water - which was plenty by the way! Turned out divine! I cooked it in my nesco roaster for 5-6 hours removing and letting sit for 45 minutes in the foil while I cooked the cabbage, carrots & potatoes in the juices.  Served with spicy brown mustard and acv! Thank you.

Followed exactly as listed.  My wife said "Well, last year your corned beef was dry (I did it in the slow cooker), but this is perfect!"

I made this recipe on SUnday march 15, for our St Patricks day parade it was wonderful.  Then on march 17 for St Patricks day I baked another corned beef in a more traditional manner.  Hands down everyone loved this dish more.  No more testing the waters, I'm sticking with this winner!!!!!

This is ridiculously good!!  Who would have thought that lowly corned beef would have guests vying for the last bite! Easy,followed directions exactly but added 1 clove more of garlic.  This earns the 5 stars. The search is over, I will only make it this way!

I had 2 corned beef briskets each a little over 3lbs, placed in the roasting pan surrounded by potatoes (I prefer Klondike rose potatoes)and carrots right from the start. I used more water about 1/2 of cup and placed the packet of spices that came from 1 on the briskets in the water. Covered with multiple layers of foil and started the over at 300 degrees for the first 2 hours since I was running late on time, at 6 hours 15 minutes shut the oven off.  The vegetables turn out great with tons of flavor and not dry, the garlic and onions are amazing, I used 2 large onions and a full head of garlic, and the corned beef is amazing.  This is my second year making it this way and will never go back!

I couldn't find the browning sauce so I just rubbed the brisket with a Dijon mustard and brown sugar mixture then I wrapped it in foil and cooked it for five hours. It turned out so tender and yummy I am buying another brisket to cook this way!

Excellent!! I only added more water because my roasting pan was larger to accommodate a rack, but could put potatoes, cabbage and carrots in liquid for an hour at end.  Tender crisp and delicious.

I made this for St. Patrick's Day.  It was simple and the meat was so juicy and flavorful! I want to make this every year for our family.  My husband, bbq master, brisket critic, said that he could not believe I did this in the oven, and my very picky 7 year old tore this up! I can't wait to make corned beef hash with our leftovers! Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I have always boiled corned beef (and was glad it was only once a year meal~ blech) now I will  definitely be making it more often. Followed recipe almost exactly, I doubled the water bc I just couldn't imagine it would be enough..didn't peak, although it was hard not to...and in 5.5 hours it was done perfectly !! Deeeelish !!!Not dry at all but totally fork tender... Even the roasted onions and garlic were super tasty !! Thanks so much for sharing mauigirl  !

It came out perfect! I picked out 2 lean cuts of corned beef.  I didn't have a rack for the roasting pan so I used a flexible silicon bake-ware and put the corned beef on top of that. I put a small amt water in pan and sealed it with foil.  After cooking, I removed all layers of fat that I could and let it chill.  I was able to cut it very thinly, then placed into serving dish, and added a cup of salt free veggie broth. (Corned beef is salty enough!) This kept the meat nice and moist.  All 30 members of my family (at my brother's party) said they had never tasted corned beef as good as this.  This is the recipe to go with!

I made this for my Mom and I, so I had a small 2-1/2 pound brisket.  I made it exactly as instructed, except I baked it only 3-1/2 hours (and resisted the temptation to peek).  We both wished we had more leftovers!

This corned beef rocked!  I was curious about some reviewers saying they would never go back to boiled, and they were all sooooo right!  I'll never boil again!  I made exactly as the recipe stated (using Costco package) although I was worried about not having enough water to steam with 2 Tbsps, so I doubled the water, but you do not need to, the corned beef has plenty of juice.

This was delicious!!  Moist and flavorful, and most importantly it was very tender!  Way better than the boiled/crock pot version we always made.  Will never go back to boiling!  This recipe is a keeper.

Made this today and it was outstanding! Flavorful, tender - in my opinion a much better approach than boiling. I cooked a 5 lb piece of flat cut corned beef on a rack in the slow cooker. Deglazed the pan that i used to sear the meat with about a cup of Guinness, cooked it down by about half, and used this for the liquid in the slow cooker. It cooked for about 6 hours and was perfection at that point. Roasted the rest of the meal (potatoes, carrots, onions) and sauteed a head of cabbage thinly sliced in some of the pan drippings from the corned beef. I always enjoyed the boiled version of this meal, but this recipe has moved to the top of the charts for me. Try it - you'll be glad you did!

Oh My Goodness!!!
This is the BEST Corned Beef I have ever tasted!!!Removed corned beef from pot and kept warm in 175 oven tightly wrapped in foil.
I added carrots and potatoes and chicken stock to drippings and let cook for an hour. Added cabbage 15 min at end of cooking time.
Everyone raved about it.

This was really very good.  I'll never boil corned beef again.  I had a 4 pound roast and it was fork tender at 5 hours.  I kept it tightly covered while I roasted potatoes and carrots and then served it with coleslaw. We used the leftovers (with a little of the liquid from the roast) to make an awesome corned beef hash.  Thank you for the recipe.

This was my first corned beef I had ever cooked and I enjoyed this recipe thoroughly. My boyfriend sadly did not. I will not attribute his dislike to this recipe, but to the general fact he doesn't seem to like the beef itself (just moved in together and I'm learning I have a wicked picky eater on my hands). I didn't have browning sauce so I used a brown sugar syrup instead and used beef broth at the bottom of the pan. Within two hours I had an amazing corned beef, with enough juices to serve on the side. It was simple to prepare; brush with the syrup, fry on both sides, throw in preheated oven and pull it out two hous later. Wonderful!

Absolutely delectable! Juicy, tender, and melted in my mouth! Even the ones who dislike corned beef were fighting for the last piece! I had about a 4 pound brisket added some Guinness to the bottom of the pan along with the water. Nice and flavorful! Wish, for once, I had leftovers! Thank you for the recipe.

Delicious!!  I will always cook my corn beef this way for now on.  My family and guest loved this recipe. I followed the recipe with one change. I used 1 bottle of Guinness Beer in roasting pan instead of the 2tbl of water. The dripping from the cooked  meat and the beer mixture  made good juice for spreading over meat and vegetables. I will definitely keep this recipe and will used for now on. 


Thanks for sharing.

2018/ I am making this corn beef today, St Paddy Day. My family and friends love this recipe. I also make the Colcannon by Chef John. It goes well with this braised corn beef.
Also for those who wanted to know what happens to the carrots and cabbage? I took the packet from the corn beef and put it in pot , added water. Cut cabbage in 4 peices , and added carrots . If you like , add new potatoes to pot. I made colcannon instead of the boiled potatoes. For dessert,  I will try the Irish tea cake.

Made this tonight and it was super good . I added carrots, parsnips and cabbage with the roast. Much better than boiling. I would suggest using  the flat cut not the point cut of corned beef it is more costly but so worth it.  I did add more water than was called for in recipe

The only change we made was to swap out the water for half a can of Guiness beer. This recipe was very good and provided much more flavor than just boiling the corn beer in water.

Best corned beef ever.  Will never make in the crock pot again.  Used my dutch oven, removed corned beef and wrapped in foil while veggies cooked in the pan sauces with a bit of chicken stock added.  Amazing!!!!

This is perfection.  My first time making corned beef.  Gee, why did I wait so long?  I seared the brisket well on both sides in my cast iron skillet. I did not have Kitchen Bouquet.  Put onion and garlic on top and covered tightly with foil.  So moist, delicious and easy to slice.  Thanks mauigirl for sharing your recipe.

This was delicious. Forget boiling. I used my dutch oven pan, and inserted the grate from my pressure cooker after browning it before putting it in the oven. I used the 2 T of water with a 2.75 lb brisket. I turned it down to 250 for the last 4 hours because I was going to be gone and wanted to be safe in case I was late. Best corned beef I've ever had. I don't understand the people who say it was dry, except maybe they didn't cook it in the right type of pan. Thank you!

Easy and delicious.  I did add a bit extra water and I didn't have browning sauce.  I had two briskets so I doused both in pepper and one in worchestershire sauce after browining.  Both were great. Only problem was waiting for them to finish!

This was AMAZING!!!  I have never made corned beef before but I will be making it again this way!  It is so moist and cut with a fork tender!!!!  Used Baking Nana's method of tripe wrapping in foil, other than that, followed the directions exactly!!!!

Only tasted a bit that I just pulled off what I took out of the oven.  If the rest of it tastes as good we've got a real winner here. The house smells heavenly and this was soooo easy to prepare, no more cooking the old way for me!  My only concern was that  the recipe calls for a 5 lb cut, and mine was only close to 3..I cooked it according to directions anyway and it is not dried out, but nice and tender and moist.  Thank you so much.

I wasn't able to find browning sauce so I combined soy sauce with maple syrup and a little bbq, it worked well.

Fantastic.  I used my Nesco Roaster to free up the oven.  I triple wrapped it in foil and placed on the rack.  It took about 6 hours for my 6 pound (ish) brisket, which I brined myself.  This is the way I will make corned beef from now on.

AMAZING!  This was the best corned beef I have ever had! Served it with potatoes, carrots, and cabbage. Only change I made was after browning the meat, I deglazed the pan with about 1/2-3/4 of a cup of good German beer.  Then once the onions and garlic were on top of the beef, I poured the contents of the pan over everything and used that as the cooking liquid instead of water, dropped an extra clove of sliced garlic in the bottom of the pan, then covered with foil and put it in the oven. When everything was finished cooking, the meat was fork tender and the drippings made a gravy that put the whole meal over the top! I will never make another boiled or crock-pot corned beef again.
