This is delicious! That being said, there is one flaw in this recipe; corn starch should be used for thickening in the topping instead of flour, probably about 2 TBSP would work. There is a flour taste to the topping and it doesn't have the smooth, pleasing texture it should have. I followed the recipe except used a whole cup of whipped cream in the topping. I will definitely make this again, using corn starch as the thickening agent.

A very good summer time recipe. I don't understand the ones that bought another can of pineapple juice or used orange juice--there is plenty of juice from the draining of the can of pineapple. I agree with using cornstarch to thicken and the toasted coconut on top. I used crushed Nilla cookies instead of flour in the crust and used coconut instead of almonds.

I have been making this recipe for years now. It is great, takes a little time but its worth it! Make it in the evening for the next day. It tastes very fresh and fruity - great in the summer too! You can also use margarine and chopped almonds or no almonds at all. Sometimes I also use only 1 pck. regular cream cheese and 1 pck. low fat. But this cake is worth every calorie in it!!

Instead of buying pineapple juice I just used orange juice in the cream cheese layer.  It worked wonderfully.  This dessert was great - took it to a church pitch-in and they raved.  Make it the day before and let it set overnight before serving.  I am not a huge pineapple fan, but I even enjoyed it!

Have made this recipe for two groups and was asked for the recipe many times.  However, the only thing I had a problem with was the extra pineapple juice in the cream cheese.  Seemed a shame to buy a whole bottle of pineapple juice just for 2/3 cup.  Would definitly recommend this recipe.

Another WOW! from my family.  This was so easy.  Yes, it is a few steps, but who's counting.  I used whole graham crackers placed on the bottom of a 9x13 pan.  They made a wonderful crust without the fuss.  I will definitely be making this dessert again.

This recipe is delicious!  I made it the first time for a summer baby shower, and the light, fruity taste was a perfect treat in the hot weather!  Everyone loved it, and there were only crumbs left behind.

This was really good.  I ended up doubling the topping recipe, so there was more pineapple.  And I did use cornstarch instead of flour in the topping.  Had a girls get together and everyone loved it.

A really nice, not too sweet dessert! Loved the almonds in the crust, but I wished there was more cheesecake in the middle layer! I could see trying this with other fruit and juices as well.

Yum,  I didn't make bars but combined this recipe with the Pineapple Cheesecake recipe to make it more like a pie.  Used a pre-maide crust and it was delicious!!!  Used 3 8oz cream cheese packages for a 9 oz grahamcracker crust.

The filling and the topping were both excellent, but I found the crust to be too thick and floury-tasting. I will make this again, but will probably try a graham cracker crust with a layer of sliced almonds.

I only made the filling, put it into a ready made graham cracker crust and topped it with some drained crushed pineapple mixed with a couple of tablespoons of brown sugar...loved it!  A very nice, creamy pineapple dessert.

One of my favorites.  I use graham cracker crumbs instead of the flour to make a graham cracker crust-sooo delicious.  I put it into a smaller pan so we can have a thick crust.  I really donâ€™t like the cream cheese cakes with a thick cream cheese layer and no crust.  But be careful to not overcook the crust, because it will turn out very hard.  Thanks for sharing.

Delish!!  Couple Notes: I used cornstarch and 1 cup of whip cream in the topping. That amount worked perfectly to cover a 9*13 pan. I didn't have almonds; I substituted finely chopped walnuts.  Guests requested that next time, I use graham cracker crust; that sounds just as good, though I liked the taste of the regular crust.   The cheesecake flavor is very mild; the topping has more of a pineapple sweetness-- it definitely keeps the dessert very light and not overwhelming.   The layers were distinct enough for me, though it tastes so good I'm tempted to double the recipe.  (It's almost gone as I write this!)

I love this cheesecake. I used chopped walnuts the first time and chopped almonds the 2nd time....both were great. I reduced the flour a little the 2nd time that I made it. I also used Cool Whip instead of whipping cream.

This recipe is absolutely scrumptious! I added a few roasted almond slivers to the top for presentation, with the coconut, and it was a huge hit!  Spectacular!!

I've made this recipe many times and it's very good, but instead of heavy cream try using frozen whipped topping, it works just as well and less time consuming. As for those who had a  conceren about the pineapple topping, you will get 1- cup of pinneapple juice from the can if you let it strain for about 15 mins. but you will need a small can of pinneapple juice for the cheese cake part, hope this helps.

This was a tasty pineapple treat.  One warning though, do not overbake the dessert.  I cooked the cheesecake part longer than the recipe called for, because it was not done in the middle.  Doing this made the crust very hard, the dessert was more like a cookie bar than cheesecake.

When I made this I followed another members idea and made a graham wafer crust with the almonds & used 2 Tbsp cornstarch as the thickener for the topping.  I didn't have any pineapple juice except for what I got out of the pineapple so I used freshly squeezed orange juice. This recipe is absolutely scrumptious even with the change in juices. You can still taste pineapple & not the juice.  I can only imagine how great it would taste with pineapple juice.

This was good..It was a change from the usual chocolate desserts I tend to make. I think next time more cool whip with the pineapple. But all in all it was very good.

Everyone at church loved this.  I used orange juice instead of pineapple in the filling so I would not have to open another can of pineapple.  The pineapple juice in the can is plenty for the topping!

I did thicken with cornstarch and it turned out great!  Additionally, I added another layer to the top to finish... Fresh dairy whipping cream whipped with a little sugar... Spread on top of the crushed pineapple layer.  Garnish with toasted, slivered almonds. Yum!

This layered chessecake-style dessert is good, but not exceptional. I made it for dessert last night, and I couldn't wait the suggested 4 hours before trying it. After 2 hours in the fridge it was o.k., but the crust was crumbly and didn't hold together well. I had another piece today and it was much better. The crust absorbed some moisture from the other layers and was much more tender and solid.      The only other complaint I have with this dessert is that the cheesecake layer and the pineapple/whipped cream topping layer aren't that distinct (like the photo suggests). I followed the recipe, but maybe a longer cooking time for the cheesecake layer would create a more definitive layer.     My mother also mentioned that she misses the dominant creamcheese flavor of most cheesecake-style desserts. There is a hint of creamcheese flavor in this, but it mostly hits just a creamy, pineapple note. Good, but not great.

Great recipe. I used a graham/coconut crust instead, but both are great.

This recipe is easy...not that many steps.  It was easy because as you bake the bottom, then you make the cheesecake mixture and then bake that off without even shutting off your oven in between.  They are a hit with my husband's employees and I make them for family get togethers.  Try them and you will see what I mean.

Made this with fresh Maui Gold Pineapple and it just didn't work. If I didn't always plant my pineapples on the lanai it would have been a total waste and I would be grumpier. 

Use the canned fruit. 

There are way better ways to use a fresh one.

So good for something so easy to make (I almost feel guilty, like I cheated on a test) :) It went over very well at work, and I must admit,  it beats everything else I've made. I made a couple changes: using a readymade crust and using a sugar substitute. I also chopped the pineapple chunks into very small pieces and mixed it in with the cream cheese, rather than on top. I used a graham cracker crust and an oreo crust (which was the better of the two in my opinion).  Using the amounts listed in the recipe, there was enough to fill two pie crusts.

I love the pineapple flavor.    The only thing I changed with this recipe , is I substituted coconut for the almonds.     Next time I make this, I will half the crust.   Was a little thick there.    But, I will def make again.

The crust was way too think on the 1st go round.  I will be making it the same, just cutting the crust ingredients in half, it still completely covers the bottom of the baking pan.  I made it for Easter and it was a big hit!  LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!

YUMMMMMMM........We loved this. The only thing I did different was that I ground my almonds in my processor,  reduced the sugar in the cheesecake portion to 1/3 and topped with an additional 3/4 cup heavy cream whipped. I can't wait to make this again.

EXCELLENT!!!  Wish I could give this 10 stars.  Made for the first time on 3/21/10, eliminating the almonds which I don't care for.  The topping wasn't that bad using flour since the pineapple and juice had been added but next time I will try the cornstarch.  Gave some to my neighbors and they loved it!  Thank you for sharing.  Delicious! Carol

This was just "alright".  I liked the nutty flavor in the crust but sort of bland.  I used the heavy whipping cream as the recipe called but it would have been better with pre-made cool whip.  Ended up throwing half the pan away.  A few changes would make this better.

This was a fab recipe.  I would, however, make the suggested change by previous reviewer, Kaye Lynn, subbing flour for the cornstarch -- would have perfected this recipe to 5*.  That said, there were no complaints by anyone who sampled this square.  Received raves from both sides of the fam.  Thanks for another keeper!

This was pretty good but I thought the crust was too much & there was too much pineapple on the top layer (might cut that in 1/2 if I make again.

Y'know, this was good, but it came out a little soggy for me.  So it was good, but a bit messy.  If I was having a guest that really liked pineapple and cheesecake, I might make it again, but otherwise probably won't.  Didn't have a good 'shelf life' either.
