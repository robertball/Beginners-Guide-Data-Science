I had an overabundance of apples and was also so pleased to see that there were cranberries in this, as I also had a package of cranberries in the crisper from thanksgiving that needed to be used.  I made both bread and muffins(doubled the recipe) and they were sooo moist!!!  After reading other reviews, I read the proportions of ingredients and was quite perplexed as to how this was going to turn out.  There did seem to be a bigger proportion of dry ingredients to the liquid.  The adjustments I made were:  I added the sugar and salt to the apples first to leech out the juice.  I also added just a splash of orange juice (maybe two tbsp) and grated some orange rind.  I immediately wrapped the bread when it cooled and put in fridge and put the muffins in a plastic container with lid.  I couldn't resist the muffins so tried them about an hour later; the bread in the fridge until the next day.  Both were so moist and there was no crumbling at all.  I think alot depends on the type of apple.  When I started slicing into what I had(red delicious) they were quite juicy so I am sure that helped.  I also added a bit more cinnamon and a half tsp of nutmeg to the DOUBLE batch I made; would use a quarter tsp. to the single recipe. I also added a tsp of vanilla.  I have this bookmarked as I will be using this one again.  Presentation is also beautiful with the whole cranberries and chunks of apple.

Hi Teresa. Great recipe! I couldn't wait overnight to bake this bread. Baking at the time of mixing, it turned out perfectly. Very flavorful and attractive presentation. I'm not sure what the reviewers are doing wrong who believe it needs more liquid. This recipe makes a very stiff batter rather than a soupy one, but coming out of the oven, it is perfect! Next time I'm going to try a little extra cinnamon and about 3/4t salt. But that's just my experimental nature! :-)

I have to agree with the reviewer who only got crumbs.  There is not enough liquid in this recipe to make a batter.  I had to add more, and even then, there was way more fruit and nuts than "batter."  Perhaps the secret lies in letting the apples sit in the sugar for a long time, thus drawing out their juices?  Maybe that's the secret, and why it works to freeze this recipe before baking.  That would give enough time for the apple juices to saturate the flour mixture.  Definitely a wierd recipe.  The bread itself tastes fine, but doesn't hold together all that well.  I still only give this recipe one star, if left as is.  If somehow more liquid were added, or instructions were added to let the apples and sugar sit for a hour or so, I'd give it more.

Did I do something wrong??  I followed the directions and came out with batter that didn't have enough liquid...crumbly dry.  Tried to press it into my bread pan and bake but didn't rise like bread or anything!!  Had to throw it out..maybe I did something wrong, though.

I LOVE this recipe!  I made it for a Christmas party this year and everyone loved it.  It was so good I ended up making some for gifts.  For a pretty variation, I doubled the recipe and put it in my springform bundt pan.  After putting it on a pretty serving plate, I drizzled a confectioner's sugar glaze over the top.  Everyone raved about this new holiday "cake."

I used a mixture of pears and apples since that is what I had on hand and it got rave reviews.  I liked making the batter ahead of time, then thawing and baking it like Teresa suggested.

My boss served a yummy Cranberry Apple bread at a recent luncheon. I raved about it, but it was clear she wasn't going to share the recipe. Instead I visited this site and was not at all disappointed. This bread is moist and delicious! It was not dry during the prep or the eating! (I used Courtland apples which I find to be nice and juicy for recipes.) Thanks for a great recipe, Teresa S!

so good my family loved it. I doubled the recipe and included the juice from apples. I added a cup of Craisins since I didn't have fresh/frozen cranberries. It was great and so easy.

I made this bread for Christmas dinner, and had rave reviews.  In fact, my grandmother _told_ me that I would be making it again today for her to take home.  It was a very moist and yummy bread.  Our family loves the tartness of cranberries with the sweetness of the bread.

After reading previous reviews, I let the apples and sugar sit while I mixed the dry ingredients, and then added the oil and egg.  Also, I added a little extra cinnamon, and some nutmeg.  

Wonderful recipe!  Will be making this often.

This is an excellent recipe.  I would probably reduce the sugar a little the next time I make it.  I had no trouble with dryness, I suspect the others did not chop their apple finely enough.  Great way to use leftover cranberries and apples.

There was not enough liquid to hold it together.  I added milk the first time but I think I am going to add apple juice the next time.  It tasted wonderful and everyone loved it.

This was very different. The cranberries make it sour, and the apples and sugar make it sweet. It was too dry for me, it fell apart when I took it out of the pan. Won't make this again.

Great receipe. I added a few tbsp of almond milk because the batter seemed too dry to me. Also used dried cranberries because that is all I had. I used stevia instead of sugar and used half whole wheat flour to make it a bit healthier. It turned out great. Wonderful way to use up apples that are a bit too soft to eat raw!

I keep going back and forth on this one, so it's hard for me to rate.  First, like other reviewers, my batter was very crumbly, but I knew that with the amount of added fruit that moisture probably was not going to be an issue - the apples would release some juice as they baked.  I was right - I ended up with an extremely moist loaf of bread.  It smelled wonderful while baking and when it first came out of the oven, but something about the flavor was a bit off - as much as I love cranberry breads, the tartness of the cranberries was a little too much for me.  I think I would have liked more bread, and a little less fruit, so to speak.  One thing I will mention is it tasted better after sitting a while, so maybe tomorrow I'll enjoy it a little bit more.

Make this only to make your kitchen smell good, but don't feed it to anyone. It was so terribly bland and the fruit didn't mesh and taste the way I thought they would. This needed a lot more sugar than the recipe calls for. Also, the inside of the bread fell away from the crust when I checked for doneness. All in all, just awful and a waste of fresh cranberries. I will never make this again.

I read all 78 reviews, and was intrigued by how the recipe worked for some but not others. I made the recipe as written.  My apples and cranberries did not give off any liquid, so the batter was literally like a crumble topping. I hoped the fruit would give off liquid while baking, but it didn't...very disappointed. Skip this recipe! Seriously, if the recipe is this controversial, choose another recipe...I wish I would have!!!

I really like this recipe, and have made it several times now.  It works well with all sorts of apples, including mushy ones.  It is terrific for using up apples that my family won’t eat as hand fruit.  Some reviewers have complained that the dough is too dry.  I find that much of the moisture in the recipe comes from the juice of the apples.   The overall moisture level of the dough will depend on how juicy the apples are, how small the apple chunks are and how long you stir them in the sugar and oil.  The more you stir, the more moisture is drawn out.  The recipe still comes out fine, even if the dough is very stiff.  If you are looking for a fine-grained bread like a banana nut bread or zucchini bread, cut the apples to 1/8 to ¼ inch cubes, and coarsely chop the cranberries.  I pulsed them briefly in a food processor.  (I only recommend chopping the cranberries if they are fresh and firm.)  The dough will be moist and pourable if you go this route.  If you want something with big, moist chunks, leave the cranberries whole and cut the apples to ¼ to ½ inch cubes.  In this case, the dough will be stiff and you will have to spoon it into the pan.   I usually double the recipe, so that I can use an entire bag of cranberries.

This bread smells and looks wonderful. I did not have any apples because I had just made homemade chunky applesauce the other day, so instead of chopped apples, I used 2 cups of the apples sauce. It turned out wonderfully!!! The mix of the tartness from the cranberries and the sweetness of the apples are a great combination!

I just made this and it was wonderful! I replaced white flour with whole wheat. That is the only change I made. For those that complained about the mix being too dry...it is BREAD not cake! So don't excect it to have the consistency of cake batter. Also you should use very ripe apples not the green ones. That will make the moisture just right.

I used a lot of information from earlier reviews...such as waiting to mix the apples with the dry ingredients so they'd give up some of their juices, except I didn't wait 15 minutes, it was more like 5.  This has a really good flavor.  I'm glad I chopped the apples up pretty small or I think it would have been harder to cut.  I added a touch of salt like someone else suggested but that might make it brown too quickly on the outside because that appeared to be a problem.  This is definately better than fruit cake.  It would be perfect if it stayed together better.

This bread was fabulous.  Made it for a church function and it was a hit. I made the following modifications:
2 whole chopped apples (peeled and cored, of course) rather than just 2 cups.
1 and a half cups of cranberries (for that extra kick!)
Splenda for baking, which is half splenda, half sugar. 

The moistness and the sweetness come from the apples.  I love that there is so little fat in this recipe.  This is a keeper!

After reading the reviews-I decided also to add orange juice to the batter-juice and zest from one orange-also added 1 tsp vanilla-and doubled the sugar-when done I poked holes in top of {cake} and poured on a hot orange syrup which made it so moist-was wonderful- the orange syrup I just cooked on top on stove-1 cup sugar and juice and zest of one large orange,cook about five minutes and pour on warm cake-also chopped the cranberries before adding to apples-thanks for a good one!

Having read the other reviews, I was not surprised to find the batter VERY dry. The addition of about 1/2 c water a T at a time was necessary. I really didn't measure my cinnamon, just added it until it looked good. The end product was a FANTASTIC full-flavored moist muffin. I took them to a family Thanksgiving dinner ad the raved about them. the cranberr/apple combo was glorious. No additional sugar was required and the cranberries were a pleasant contrast to the sweet Empire apples. I will use this recipe again and again!

Excellent recipe. I went a bit heavier on the apples and used half whole wheat flour. Left out the nuts. Came out great--moist, crunchy on top. Would also be good as muffins.

I am not a very experienced baker, but I love cranberries, so I decided to try this bread.  Thought it was a little odd that there was barely enough batter to stick the berries, apples, and nuts together.  But it came out great!  Not too crumbly (or not any more so than you'd expect).  I made it once using frozen cranberries and another time using dried ones that I soaked for a while to rehydrate them; the dried cranberries made it a little sweeter so it might be best to use those if you don't like the tartness of fresh ones.

The dough was moist enough, but biting into bitter/tart cranberries was very unpleasant! Maybe chopping them would help.

I want to make this to take into work on Christmas Eve so this was a test run. I omitted the walnuts as a couple of my colleagues are allergic and I wanted to make sure it would work without. I also shredded the apples and let the wet ingredients stand for 15 minutes. The batter was quite stiff but not dry. It slices well and is very moist looks lovely too.The only thing I may do is add a little more cinnamon but I will defnitely be making this for Christmas Eve. Thanks

Great!  The batter seemed a bit dry so I used about 2 big tbsp of plain yogurt (had no juice or milk but this worked perfectly).  Used 1/2 cup brown sugar and a tbsp or so of white sugar (all the sugar I had on hand).  Came out moist and not too sweet.  Definitely more cinnamon next time.  Thanks!

Having read the reviews, I modified this bread. I mixed all the wet ingredients together, and added 1 extra egg and 1/4 cup extra canola oil, as well as about 1/4 cup almond milk. Then I mixed wet into dry and folded in the fruit. I also upped the cinnamon to 2.5 teaspoons. I finely chopped most of the apple with some coarser chunks. I baked for about 1 hour, and it came out very well. This bread is not too sweet and not too tart, which is great!

Tasted great but I changed things 
And added things.  First I used 1/2 cup of dried cranberries 1/4 cup raisins soaked them in 1/2 cup of juice. Added 3 tablespoons of applesauce in with the dried cranberries n raisins  beat 1egg into that fruit mixture. Chopped 2cups of apples and added the sugar to it and stirred all.  In a large bowl added 1 3/4 cups of flour with cinnamon cloves  nutmeg n salt with the baking powder baking soda. Added 2 1/2 tablespoons of cooking oil to the apple sugar mix. One cup of chopped walnuts. Baked it for 55 minutes.

I loved this!  I made the following small changes--added 1/4 t salt, 1/2 t vanilla, and 1/4 cup applesauce (mostly because my egg was so small).  I only had one apple, so I put in a few extra cranberries.  Mine was finished in about 30 minutes.  The batter is very stiff, but the loaf is really moist and flavorful.

It's midwinter and the air is very dry. I heeded the not enough liquid and added 1/4 cup milk, 1 tsp vanilla and and extra half T oil. Everyone loved it. Crisp sweet crust, moist inside. The 1/4 inch apple chunks were like apple pie. Next time I'm going to try half brown sugar.

I really liked this bread, but my hubby wasn't a big fan.  Luckily the rest of my family enjoyed it.  It's really sweet and the cranberries add great color!  I grate my apples to make the bread more moist.

I think I might have used too many apples, but my loaf was overly fruity. I used the amount of fresh cranberries that it called for though, and I think that was a bit too many. Very very tart. As for overall flavor, great, and I didn't have any of the troubles others had with it being to dry, but I guess I did allow my apples and sugar to sit a bit while I measured out my dry ingredients. Great recipe though, thanks.

This is very good!! I did add a tsp of vanilla for flavor, then a splash of milk and also a splash of cranberry-apple juice that I ironically had in the fridge. The dough was sticky, but it baked well. I baked for 35 minutes. And I tripled the recipe to make one loaf of bread and some trays of muffins. Can't wait to bring these to the family on Thanksgiving! Thank you for sharing!

Very tasty!  The batter is thick like a cookie dough, but I wasn't scared and went ahead and followed directions.  Came out wonderful!  Didn't change a thing and I'm glad.  I will definitely be making again
One note: when I cut into it, it wasn't done.   Needed more cooking time than stated.

I double all of my recipes and I have found that if the batter seems too stiff I add a couple more eggs. This is what I did with this recipe and it came out beautiful. Another plus to this recipe is that it only takes a scant half four to bake! It is a eco friendly recipe.
My family loved it as I am sure yours will too.
Also If you use graham flour or whole wheat flour sometimes your recipe will be crumbly and dry. So maybe you should use white or add an egg or two like me.

I agree w/other reviewers - quite dry and crumbly at first.  I soaked the apples and cranberries in 1/3 c. apple cider and when I added it to the mix, crumbs became batter.  Very very fruit-laden batter.
Also, baked for about 50 minutes.

Followed this recipe to a T and it was drier than a bone. The apples were not soft and the top of the bread was brown, very tasteless to boot. I used Granny Smith apples. Dont know what the problem was but I definetly won't be making this again, threw the whole loaf in the garbage.

Delicious -- but I did have to make a few changes.  Like others, I found the batter too dry so I added 1/3 cup of milk.  Also, I baked it in muffin pans and got 12 good-sized muffins from this recipe.  Next time I make it (and it will be soon), I will cut down on the sugar....I think 1/2 cup would be more than enough.  All said, this recipe is definitely a keeper!

The dry ingredients barely coated the fruit. There was no batter to speak of, just fruit cakes in flour. Strange recipe. I would not recommend it.

Mixing it together it doesn’t seem to have enough batter but it ended up being fine. General review from my family and I agree, it’s a bit wet and mushy. The cranberry is a bit much. If I make this again I’ll personally cut back on the cranberry. It would probably be less wet and less tart. I love cranberries btw, just not in this recipe

Doubled the cinnamon and added some vanilla. It took 55 min to bake in my over though, and it usually runs a bit hotter. Not too sweet, perfect for breakfast!

Great taste after adding 1/2 cup applesauce.  The batter was so dry, I thought it needed more moisture.

Needed about 15 minutes more baking time but I am at over 3500 feet in altitude.

This was very good and moist. I used gala apples and pecans because I didn't have walnuts. I followed the recipe as it was written, which is unusual for me.  I'm glad I didn't read the negative reviews before I started because I probably wouldn't have made it. It was a little difficult to mix because of the small amount of liquid but I'm glad I didn't change a thing except the type of nut. I'll make this again. Everyone I shared it with loved it as well.

This bread is a winner!  Moist and packed with crunchy walnuts (ok, I may have added a few extra, lol), sweet apples (I did leave the peel on mine), and tart cranberries.  So easy to put together, this recipe is going in my binder of favorites!

So I had the same issue with not enough liquid. I just poured water into the batter (probably about 1/3 cup, but I'm not really sure). I just made it a batter-like texture. I then baked the bread for 55 minutes, and it turned out great!

Loved this! I left out the walnuts, which may have made the bread more moist. I noticed that other reviewers were saying that this recipe is too dry and their bread turned out crumbly. I've never tried MS_TERESA's suggestion of leaving this bread overnight and baking in the morning, but in my opinion if your dough is dry right before placing in the oven then there's a good chance it will dry and crumbly when baked. My dough was moist and sticky before placing in the oven and came out great, but I didn't add walnuts which likely soak up some liquid.

I made the recipe as is.  It was nice and moist.  I made it in a loaf pan and found that it needed more than 35 minutes.  I actually baked it for 45-50 minutes.  I highly recommend this as a healthy treat.

The cranberry bread was delicious.  When I make again I will not add sugar cinnamon topping.
The bread is favorable without it.

It sure didn't seem like it was going to work but it DID! I made two  loaves. One exactly as directed and one I added a tsp of vanilla. Both were yummy and moist!  We love it warmed and buttered also! Thank you.

This is the best Cranberry bread I've ever tasted!  It's our NEW favorite!  The recipe is perfect as is given. But, because we LOVE cinnamon, I used 2 tsp. of cinnamon rather than 1 tsp. and omitted walnuts, due to allergies.  It was still as moist without the nuts.  Also, it freezes well.  I wrapped the cooled loaf in plastic wrap, then aluminum foil, and put it in a plastic freezer bag.  It tasted as good thawed as it did fresh.  Great recipe!

Dry! The mixture came out like crumble for Apple crisp.

To try to save it, I also added:
1 egg, 1Tbsp oil, 1/4 cup Apple cider
This got it to the right consistency. Cooked 40 min at 350. 

Turned out great! Rated for my version, not original.

I was making for a crowd so omitted nuts
Used dry cranberries and fresh apples
I don't use eggs
Substituted ground flax seeds
Was concerned it would be moist enough added bit more water to compensate
Came out nice!!

i'll definitely make this again. i felt it needed a little more liquid so i added 2 tbsps. of veg. oil to it. i couldn't find my loaf pan for some reason so i used the little ceramic loaf pans you get at Christmas tree shop. it came out terrific. moist and tasty. i froze two of the loafs and they reheated beautifully in the microwave. thanks for the recipe!

It was good but after I tasted it I decided it could use some salt to enhance flavors. Very moist and tasty. Great combination of apples and fresh cranberries, too.
Will make it again  with addition of  salt [1/2 tea.]

Double the eggs and double the oil adds the required liquid to make it less crummy and more like a batter. It also makes it ride more like a loaf of bread.

I made this but instead of using cranberries I used strawberries. Because I didn't have cranberries on hand at the time. Then I made a glass to put across the top when done. My family loved it. Thank you for sharing.

I made the recipe as written except for adding a splash of apple juice, probably less than 1/4 cup.  It was very moist and tasty. My husband loved it and wants me to make a double recipe next time. I plan to make it for Thanksgiving. Definitely a keeper!

I added a single serve of unsweet applesauce,  1/8 tsp nutmeg, 2 tsp vanilla, 2 TBS orange juice, reduced the sugar a little, and did 1/2 of the sugar as brown sugar. I also used whole wheat white flour and had to cook for 50 minutes. Came out great!

I made this bread and it turned out amazing. I actually made it in 3 small loaf pans and it was perfect.  Moist, not too sweet, great combination with the apples and cranberries!

I read other reviews so I added about a half cup orange juice to the mix. I had to bake it almost an hour as a result. It was moist and the outside slightly crunchy which I liked. The taste was great, the tart and sweet are great and the bread itself is not too sweet. I did double the cinnamon, just because I like it. It smells wonderful while baking, too.

I let the sugar sit in the apples for about an hour before I made the recipe and it turned out great. I did make it in a cheesecake pan just because I like to cut the bread in pie slice shapes when I am taking to work.  Everyone really enjoyed this, I had to take the last piece before lunch time so I could share it with my husband.

Delicious! I had more cranberries than apples so I used 2 cups berries and 1 cup apples. Don't add any extra liquid. This recipe works- just be patient. Once the egg is stirred into the dry ingredients let the batter sit for a few minutes and the ingredients will moisten, then stir again. The batter has more of a dough-like consistency.

although I made a few slight alterations this was fantastic. so happy I tried it. I cut the sugar in half and used brown sugar instead, used 1 1/4 c flour and 1/4 c ground flax seed. baked perfectly at 40 minutes.  planning on making mini muffins for Christmas morning :)

I didn't have any trouble with it at all.  I didn't cut the apples particularly fine, and the moment that I put the oil and sugar together there was a lot of liquid.  I did beat the egg well before adding it.  I can't find cranberries - fresh or frozen so I used dried ones.  The apples I used were Canada Gris.  It was pleasant, too much fruit and not enough cake.  I don't think I would bother making it again.

Excellent recipe. Fresh cranberries made it just the right tartness. I also substituted 1/2 cup pears and 1 1/2 cup apples and a little extra oil.

I have been using this exact recipe since 1996 - from a woman I had worked with.  It is a 'dry' batter, but it comes out so moist and delicious.  I do not change or add anything at all to the ingredients.  However, I do bake it in my stoneware loaf pan, reduce the temp to 325 degrees and let it bake for about 1 hour and 20 minutes, checking it after an hour.  So good!!!

I made this on Thanksgiving morning and brought it over to my mother's house since she enjoys the breakfast bread from Publix. She absolutely loves it. She has requested for me to bring it every time I come over now. After hearing a few people's problems with liquid, I let the apples and sugar sit for an hour to bring out the juices. After that, I continued the recipe as directed, with the exception of chopping up the cranberries in a food processor. It was moist and delicious. I actually had to bake the loaf for an extra amount of time because the dough was so wet. Love the recipe!

I just made this and took it out of the oven.  Noticed right away no liquid was listed in the recipe and I added 1/2 cup of orange juice since 3/4 cup is called for in the standard cranberry bread recipe which has more sugar and flour and no apples.  It looks good, a little brown as it took a while to bake through since it is very moist.  I made a small one with excess batter and will use a 9x11 pan next time - the moistness of the recipe makes it slow to bake through in my convection oven without browning on top too much.  Anyway, it's tastes delish but 3 stars only because of the error in the recipe!  Tried to add a photo but it didn't work.

Loved it!
  I poured the apple mixture into the flour and it started looking wierd and crumbled. So I quickly stopped and poured the flour into the apples (like the recipe says too) little by little. This made it gooey and thicker sugur liquid to paste. Instead of using veggie oil I used extra vergin olive oil. I also doubled the cinnamon (to flour mixture) and added a splash of vanilla extract (to the apple mixture), and a splash of milk (mixed together)before adding the  fresh (not frozen) cranberries and nuts. Cooked the full 45 min.

I am sure that this recipe works for the submitter, but most of the people who rated this highly added liquid or did something not called for in the actual recipe.  The taste is fine (not outrageously good, but fine), but the texture is crumbly and difficult to slice.  My dog definitely would give it 5 stars, since a fair amount has ended up on the floor with two kids trying it.  I think that there has to be a more flexible, easier recipe to try for the same ingredients.

This is a awesome recipe. I tripled the ingredients to make three loaves at once. I used my food processor to chop the apples and it gave plenty of moisture for the batter. I would not say mine was like cookie batter as others have stated but more like a brownie batter. I also used 1/2 times more cranberries and just cut up three apples into small pieces an added it to the batter.  It is WONDERFUL!!!

This bread has been quite popular! The only changes I made were to use unpeeled Red Delicious apples and I omitted the walnuts as I didn't have any. I was very impressed at how cleanly this came out of the pan, and just the general presentation of it is beautiful. The batter is extremely thick and you really do have to spread it in the pan, but the bread comes out nice and moist from the fruit. I had no issues with the moisture nor the bread falling apart.

This bread is delicious.  I agree with the previous reviewers that the batter is really thick and a little tough to mix, but once it's baked it's delicious.  I had a few apples that needed to be used up so I made a double batch.  I took another reviewer's advice and put it all in a bundt pan.  I had to bake it for close to an hour, but the results were great.  I will definitely make this again.

By the time I had the bread mix in the oven I began to read over the reviews on this recipe and thought, "oops I should have looked a little closer".  But surprisingly the bread came out GREAT!  It's very similar to an all natural bread that i find in the freezer section at WholeFoods.  I used a whole wheat flour and an Oster electric hand beater.  No need to add additional liquid when the beater is used.   Thanks All Recipes!

This is a great quick bread recipe.  I leave out the nuts, increase the cranberries a little and bake it in mini loaf pans.  Great grab and go breakfast bread.

This is a delicious bread. I'm not sure why others were having issues with the dryness of the batter, but I made it just fine, wasn't dry at all. I used Empire apples, maybe a sauce or pie apple is the key here. Also, following the directions exactly may also be a factor. Mix the apples, sugar, egg and oil in one bowl, then it sits while the dry ingredients are mixed. I think while the apples sit it helps with the liquid. Either way, I made it, it was delicious and will be making this again often!

I didn't find any problems with the batter.  It was perfect! I used 2 ripe bananas instead of the oil which might have helped with the moistness of the batter.  I made this as a quick breakfast for my household and everyone loved it! It was gone by the next morning!

I like this recipe very much.  It doesn't make a typical batter...pretty thick & needs to be spread out in the pan, but I didn't alter the recipe at all & the end result was very good.  I LOVED the texture, very moist & dense & loaded w/ fruit & nuts.  The cranberries make it pretty for the holidays & I think it's a great alternative to fruitcake.  It does need a little "something", however.  Next time I'll try adding 1/4 - 1/2 t. of salt & maybe a little vanilla.

Tried this for the first time this holiday season; it is delicious!  Gave it as mini-loaves to teachers, etc., and got rave reviews.

Yummy flavor but it didn't stay together well.  I had to serve it in pieces instead of slices.  No one minded it though because it was very tasty!  :)

This was a hit at Thanksgiving dinner! I followed the recipe as listed (omitting the walnuts)and it was perfectly firm and moist.  I let the wet ingredients set together for about 15 minutes before I mixed everything together and though sticky, the dough was not at all dry.  This will be a holiday staple in our family.  Thanks for the recipe!

Taking the advice of others, I added about 1/4 cup apple juice to the recipe. The bread smelled great while baking and looked beautiful before I tried to cut it.  When trying to cut it, it just fell apart. And, there wasn't as much flavor as I thought there should be, even with additional cinnamon added when mixing the dough.

Given the cut appearance (a mess!) and lack of flavor, I probably won't make this again unless someone can give me suggestions on improving it.

After reading the reviews of others, I was skeptical of trying this recipe.  I changed it a bit by chopping the fresh cranberries, adding 1/2 tsp. salt and 1/4 cup orange juice. It took 55 minutes to bake through.  I'll probably not make this recipe again because there are other cranberry nut bread recipes I like better.
