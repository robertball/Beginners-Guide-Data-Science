I followed this recipe to the letter and needed 2 more tablespoons of lemon juice for the glaze, 3 if I wanted to drizzle instead of paint it on. These cookies are NOT dry if you don't over-bake them, they are wonderfully cakey, moist, tangy cookies. I baked them on ungreased parchment paper for exactly 8 minutes using convection. I left them to cool a little before transferring them to a wire rack. Using a teaspoon to drop them, this recipe made exactly 4 dozen cookies, down to the last scrape of the bowl. Wonderful recipe, thank you so much for sharing!

Simply the BEST Cookie I have ever had!  I did have to do some minor tweaking to the recipe - But that doesn't stop me from giving 5 stars!  I used about 3 teaspoons of lemon zest and I added a 1/2 cup of white chocolate chips (because some one mentioned white chips in their review - my daughter believed we should add them!!)  These were amazing!  They had a cake/brownie consistency and our stayed together very nice.  We did find that the 2 Tablespoons of lemon juice just wasnt enough to make a drizzle so we did 4 Tbls lemon juice and about 2 tsp of milk - the glaze makes these cookies - Thanks for an amazing cookie recipe!

Delicious cookies! My kids really loved them too! A really nice tender cookie.  I didn't experience the dryness other reviewers spoke of.  I think if they try them with the icing it helps them to not seem dry.  I might try adding some lemon juice to the dough next time to amp up the lemon taste, but there's sufficient lemon in the icing to give a nice light lemony taste.  I found I was able to halve the icing recipe and had just the right amount for all the whole batch.

I measured a very generous cup of zucchini which made the batter too wet so I added 3/4 cup of oatmeal and refridgerated the batter about 2 hours before baking.  I also substituted dried cranberries in place of the raisins.

These cookies were really good. I would make these again but I would put more lemon peel into the batter. They were even better than zucchini bread because of the lemon and frosting.

these are great! I skipped the glaze to reduce the amount of sugar we eat and I'm not disappointed with the results. They're just slightly sweet and have a wonderful texture.

I was trying to duplicate a cookie that I recently had on vacation and this cookie recipe did the trick. I omitted the cinnamon and raisins.  I used 4 Tabl. of lemon juice for the glaze.  Next time I will use 3 Tabl. and spread the glaze like frosting on each cookie because a good bit of the glaze ran off and ended up on the waxed paper.  I will also use 1 cup of nuts (I prefer pecans) because 1/2 cup was not even noticeable. Love these cake-like cookies!

This was a tastey cookie. I think my only complaint was that the cookie came out pretty flat and it fell apart when you grab one off the plate. It had a very impressive flavor and who cares if it falls apart-- it falls apart in your tummy anyways! ;-) Give her a try!

I didn't have a lemon so subbed lemon extract. Using a fine grater my zucchini looked much like applesauce. I added a little more flour because the batter was more like a cake mix. It's all about the grater folks.

These are very good. They are cake like and very moist. I had no trouble with them being dry at all. The only reason I give 4 stars is the cookie itself is a little plain. I'd like a little more flavor to it, but the icing did add a nice lemon flavor. I do recommend these. I did enjoy them! Don't overbake.

Very good and easy to make! I used the dough in muffin tins and made delicious muffins! The icing is not for those who don't like tartiness and is not really needed. Thank you for posting!

Amazing. I didn't add raisens or walnuts - didn't have them on hand. The cookie itself is super, but topped with the glaze, it's like a party in your mouth!

These are awesome!! I have made these several times. One important thing to note is to put the icing on AFTER they are cooled. I got into a hurry once and put the icing on when the cookies was still hot and it made the cookies sticky.

Very light delicate cookie.I omitted th raisins and nuts were not big on either of those items, would of added cranberries if i would of had some. I did add 2 teaspoons of fresh from the garden lemon verbenea, i cut it up very fine, it gave these cookies even more lemony flavor.

Not bad, I too thought it was too moist so I added a little extra flour and some oatmeal.  First time trying Zucchini Cookies and I was pleasantly surprised.

These cookies tasted like bite size zucchini breads! I think the raisins add alot to the taste and texture of these cookies. To make them slightly healthier, I omitted the glaze topping and sugar in the batter. I and replaced the sugar with about 3/4 cup honey. Honey is sweeter than sugar so you can use less and still get sweetness. I also used oat flour instead of all-purpose- it adds a homemade quality. These were so flavorful!

Light and sweet... not your typical flavor of cookie, but all of us enjoyed and everyone wanted more. I followed the recipe as is, with the exception of dried cranberries instead of raisins and adding zest to the glaze as well. A great use of the extra zucchini at this time of year!

not too crazy about these cookies. Something was off in the taste, almost too much flour taste? If I try them again I'll add more spice and lemon.

These are delicious. Very interesting combination of flavors. I left out nuts as it was a party with kids and someone had allergies. Thought the already interesting combination of flavors would have been even better with the nuts. Mine came out a little flatter than I was expecting, but really quite tasty and a lovely light cake-like texture. Loved the lemon icing, though I added a bit of extra lemon.

If I could give these more stars I would!  I absolutely love the way these taste and they were so easy to make!  I didn't have nuts, so I made them without nuts.  I can't wait to make again, this time with the nuts!

I left out the nuts & raisins, & left off the glaze. My husband said these were the best cookies he's ever eaten. Tried some with the glaze but the lemony twang took away from the cookie, in my opinion. Great way to use up some zucchini.
