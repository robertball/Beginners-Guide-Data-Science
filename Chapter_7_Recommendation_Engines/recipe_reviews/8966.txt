My husband and I thought these were outstanding.  As good if not better than any I've ever had at authentic Mexican restaurants - and I consider myself an enchilada connoisseur.  I used half of a large poblano chile pepper which are very mild in flavor and heat.  You will not need a full 1/2 pint of cream.  A lot of it went to waste.  I had much more than 2-1/2 cups of liquid in the end so I measured 2 cups for the bottom of the 9/13 pan and dumped the rest.  For me, the recipe made 9  enchiladas, stuffed to the hilt.  My husband called me at work today to tell me how good even the leftovers were and asked how soon could we make these again.  Thanks Gerry for a definite keeper.

This is one of the greatest Sunday night dinners; well worth the lengthy prep(easy though).  I marinated the chicken in a fajita sauce (powder packet), and it tasted great.  Spicy enough to satisfy the boyfriend, and mild enough so that I could eat it.  My boyfriend hates tomatoes, so I processed the tomato/chile mixture, and that worked out great.  What I do is boil the chicken for 15-20 minutes, then shred it with two forks, then I pour in the fajita seasoning with water, leave for several minutes, the pour out the excess.  Then I follow with the mixing (no cooking, just baking).  THANKS GERRY!

This is the best recipe for chicken enchiladas I have found so far.  Simmering the chicken in tomatoes, chile peppers and creamy soup adds so much flavor to the traditional chicken enchiladas.  My husband and I have had this twice so far and the second time I used hot enchilada sauce and it made it extra spicy!

Absolutely fabulous!  We love it!!  For the chicken marinade, I use the juice from two limes, 4 cloves garlic chopped and 1/2 t kosher salt.  I also used canned Ortega diced chiles in place of the 10 chiles.  Flour tortillas make a nice replacement to dipping the corn tortillas in cream and saves some time as well.  Thanks for sharing.

This recipe is GREAT!!!! I did make a few changes, though. I followed the recipe through step 2 minus the chicken broth. After removing the chicken I chopped it up and had plenty of the stewing liquid, which I blended with my immersible blender and used this for the sauce.(It is just that good!)I did reduce it some. I also microwaved the tortillas, so I didn't need the cream. I also left out the can of enchilada sauce, and the chicken broth. With the few changes this recipe can be made often and in little time. This is definitely a favorite. Thanks for sharing, Gerry!

Yes a fantastic enchilada recipe.  I made this as a special dinner for my girlfriend.  She absolutely raved about how awesome they were. She proclaimed that these were the best chicken enchiladas she has ever tasted.  They make rather large enchiladas so there were plenty of left over.  I sent some over to my mother and she called back the next day saying they were great and that she had already ate them all up.  I substitued a small can of mild green chiles instead of the optional fresh chiles and still got plenty of chile flavoring.  A food processor would have helped with shredding up the chicken.  These are truly Chicken Enchiladas of the Gods!! Thanks Gerry :)

I have made these enchaladas for a couple of years now and am told EVERYTIME that these are the best enchaladas in the world by everyone who tries them.  I don't know what a "small" chili pepper is so I use 3 jalapenos.  For the marinade I suggest Lawry's Havana Garlic Lime (I even pour the remainder of the marinade into the sauce)  I also use verde enchalada sauce to top.  Wonderful recipe!  I want to give Gerry a HUGE hug.

Oh Wow...I made these for lunch today.  I was the only one eating on them since hubby is at work and my 4 year old wants pizza.  These were very good.  Tasted just like I ordered them from a Mexican restaurant.  I left out the chile peppers, but added a small can of chopped black olives.  I used flour tortillas and zapped them in the microwave instead of using the cream.  I topped them with cheddar and mozzarella.  These will definitely be made again.  Thanks Gerry

I didn't have some of the ingredients, so I had to do some substitutions and I think that's what made it taste not bad, but not great either.  Anyhow, I don't get the part of cutting the chicken and then having to shred it afterwards.  Next time if I make it, I'd just marinate it whole (poking holes in the meat with forks) and then shred it after it's cooked.

Need time to prepare this very worthwhile though.I liked it and will make it again. The use of (12) chile peppers makes it far too spicy for kids. I will make it in two batches next time.

Restaurant quality!  These are the best enchiladas I've ever had and my wife and kids agree.  I made only a few minor changes.  I did not marinade the chicken, but sprinkled seasoned salt on the meat once it was shredded.  I used green pepper instead of chile peppers to keep it mild for the kids and did not coat the tortillas in cream to cut the calories.  I added about 2 oz cream cheese to put the calories back in!  I used homemade flour tortillas because once you go homemade, you never go back!  I used Rotel or the diced tomatoes w/green chiles which adds a little cilantro and lime.  I definitely recommend cutting the chicken into larger pieces to make it easier to shred.  I cut each breast into 4 pieces and may try keeping them whole next time.  I also highly recommend adding cream cheese to the meat filling.

LOVED THIS RECIPE! I did make a few changes: 1) I used 1/2 of a poblano pepper(diced) instead of chili peppers. 2)used flour tortillas instead of corn and did not dip them in heavy cream.  3)marinated chicken in 1/4 cup lime juice, 1/4 cup soy sauce, 2 cloves minced garlic. 4)used red enchilada sauce, as recipe did not specify red or green. 
I served w/ mexican rice and sour cream on the side. My family LOVED these - my son was disappointed there were no leftovers for the next day!

Recipe was very authentic tasting and delicious.  I cut down the cooking time by using Superior Touch brand "Better than Bouillon" chicken base instead of the chicken broth. (I like this bouillon brand because it's not super salty like some brands.)  This allowed me to replace 14 oz of chicken broth flavor in about 6 oz. of water.  I just doubled the amt. of bouillon for an 8 oz. serving and mixed it into 6 oz. of water.  It worked great and I don't think the flavor was compromised at all.  
  You can cut down the fat by only putting cheese on the top and not on the inside - it was plenty and I used just less than 2 cups of monterey jack/colby blend.  Top with black olives.

Very tasty.  Used mild rotele tomatoes with peppers instead of adding the chilis.  They gave just enough spice.  Reducing the liquid took a long,long time.  I will definitely make it again,  but not too often due to the time required

Besides skipping the heavy cream part , made as directed and they were the bomb. I used the ten minute enchilada recipe from this site. My husband loved them! It made 9 enchiladas using 2 huge chicken breasts.

We loved this recipe.  Be sure to add the yello onion, not the green onion in step one [like I did ;-]

When I made mine, a 9x13 pan wasn't big enough, so I used another pan.  It made 6 huge enchiladas for me.

This is a great recipe that is really saucy;  definately a comfort food recipe.

I was very hesitate at first to make this recipe.  Not use to cooking from recipes, but wanted to try something new.  It was definitely worth it.  The Enchiladas were great!!  Plan on making some for my next family gathering I host.

Wow!  Wow!  Fantastic!  This was a lot of work and took a long time to prepare (the reduction of the mixture was the reason)...but boy was it worth it.  My wife, one week later, begged me to make these again and suggested we take them as a "side dish" to a friend's house for dinner.  The only change I made was that adding one can of whole, peeled ortega chili peppers that I had diced up.  It was very spicy (which we both like) but surprisingly, the next day when it was reheated, most of the "kick" was gone.  Lastly, I suggest finding a Mexican restaurant that makes homemade corn tortillas and buy them there.  Nothing beats the fresh taste.  This is, perhaps, the best recipe I have found on this site. Thank you Gerry!

This was an outstanding recipe!  The flavor was just so good that everyone had seconds & hubbie & kids took 3rds for lunch today!  Thanks Gerry!  Now, here's the few changes I made:  I was using leftover turkey, so I marinated it in the Rotel & mexican stewed tomatoes all afternoon to give it some zing.  I used 4 real small poblano's & forgot the jalapeño (oops).  Since I didn't have any cream, I simply heated the tortillas in the microwave between damp paper towels for about 20 seconds.  The recipe ended up making a dozen enchiladas with only one leftover.  Guess who gets that for lunch!?  Thanks again Gerry, it's a GREAT recipe!

I decided to edit my review since I have made these a few times now and made some changes. I brown the chicken in a skillet, meanwhile in a large soup pot I add the rest of the ingredients (tomatoes, soup, broth etc) and puree it with a hand blender, thne once the chicken is browned I add it to the soup mixture - this makes it so much easier to get the chicken out to shred, only down side is not getting the nice chunks of tomatoes in your enchilada. I also didn't soak the tortillas, and used flour instead of corn. Turned out great!

My family really enjoyed this dish.  I made it for my husband's birthday.  I plan to make it for an upcoming potluck dinner as well.  It was labor intensive, but there are shortcuts you can take.  I did not marinate the chicken or cut into small pieces.  Also, I used flour tortillas, and didn't need to use the cream.  To cut down on the reducing time, I omitted the chicken broth.  Instead of the 12 chile peppers, I used a small can of green chiles.  I also pureed the sauce, because my family doesn't like 'chunky' vegetables.  I served spanish rice, refried beans and salad with guacamole, sour cream and taco sauce on the side.  Very good and satisfying!

These turned out just fantastic.  For ease, I cooked my chicken in the crockpot with the tomato mixture for several hours - it shredded like a dream.  I also used store bought enchilada sauce.

I love the recipies on this site. But with that said, this recipie is by far and away the best thing I have made. It is simply delicious. It is that good.

It takes longer than the prep time indicates- reducing took forever. But it is not a difficult cook, every step is easy and not time consuming. It just takes a good while between steps. But the payoff is worth it. I loved it, my wife loved it, and so did the kids.

These were very good.  Instead of the fresh chiles, I added a couple of canned chipotle chiles...gave a bit of a smoky flavor.  I also used flour tortillas since we don't care for the corn tortillas.  Yummy!

This is the most amazing dish I have ever made. Try tossing some shrimp in there, not to replace the chicken but on top of it. The more meat the better. Also try it with some of the really hot chili pepper (tiny red ones)

Although this is not a quick recipe (but I can't think of an enchilada recipe that IS quick!), it is absolutely the best enchilada recipe out there!

It is so good that when I brought the enchiladas to work, for WEEKS afterwards, people were begging me to bring in more.  Just this past week, two different people from work have paid me to make it for them!  

You must try this!

Just made this and it was fantastic.  I have never made Enchiladas before.  I cooked the chicken all day in slow cooker with 1 can enchilada sauce and 1 can spicy diced tomatoes to give the chicken more flavour.  Instead of dipping the tortillas in cream I fried them in hot oil for just 5 seconds a side.  Very good recipe.

This is a tricky one to review. It came out good, but not great. I think the prep and effort involved was not worth the end result and that's why I only rated it 3 stars. I felt there was a lot of steps I could have left out and it would have ended up just as good. I followed the recipe exactly and did not add the optional peppers. If I made this again I would leave out the stewed tomatoes, use flour tortillas just because the corn ones were awful to work with, and season the chicken and/or sauce. Maybe this was stupid of me but I did not drain any of the tomatoes either because the recipe did not specify to do so. I think this may have been why my sauce came out thin and never reduced. So this wasn't great for me but I would attempt it again with a few changes.

The best enchiladas ever. The only ingredient that I will skip next time will be the heavy cream, I will just moist my tortillas with some water there is really no need to add the extra calories when the water will do the trick. Besides that these guys are keepers!

Excellent enchiladas. I looked everywhere for an authentic recipe and this was it! Give yourself a few hours to prepare them because they take a long time. Also, don't add all the chicken broth that the recipe calls for. I ended up wasting half of my juice because there was too much. Also, make sure to soak your enchiladas in the cream for 30 seconds or so. If you don't do it long enough they will rip and it's hard to fold them. These were delicious!

Best enchiladas ever!  I did not marinate the chicken.  But I will keep the breasts whole the next time because it was a pain picking all the chicken pieces out of the stew like mixture. You can just brown the outside of the chicken and then add the other stuff no need to cook all the way thru on the first step.  They were a little time consuming but well worth it.  AWESOME!  They were so good my wife made me make a second batch, 2 days later.  Did not marinate the chicken.  Did not use cream on the shells, just heated in microwave to make soft and pliable. Left the chicken whole and it was easier the second time. This will be a weekly meal.  Also used smaller tortilla shells just rolled more.  THANKS GERRY

Great recipe.  I've used it many times now and it's my "standard" enchilada recipe, although it does take time.  I always seem to use far more than 6 (6 inch) corn tortillas.  It turns out quite well, but has anyone else had that experience?  Six small tortillas don't really fill up a 9X13 pan.

This recipe took a while to make, but it was worth it - I had six people for dinner and I have never had such rave reviews of a meal.  I made my own enchilada sauce but apart from that, didn't change a thing.  The sauce takes quite a while to boil down so give yourself lots of time because you need to stir it a lot or it will burn.  I will make this again and again, my kids loved the leftovers next day.  I just served it with Mexican Rice and salad - it was perfect.  Thank you so much.

These enchiladas are pretty good as everyone has stated.  I did have a preconceived notion that the reviewers who complained about the time it took to make these enchiladas might be just a little whiney!  I enjoy a long leisurely Sunday cooking project, but this WAS long!  :-)  By chance, I began cooking this dish around 11am on Sunday, for which I am grateful, because it was ready by 5pm.  It took about 3 hours to reduce the sauce; and I got it down to only about 4 c by then.  1.) I used no-sodiumno-MSG chicken broth and no-sodium cream of chicken soup and it seemed to taste just right.  2.)  Rather than using a 9x13 pan, I used two 9x9 baking dishes and made one pan with red enchilada sauce and one with green enchilada sauce.  Both were equally good.  3.)  I used corn tortillas and flour tortillas in each pan also and both were good and I'm not a big corn tortilla fan.  4.) Oh and I seasoned the chicken in Montreal Chicken Seasoning (made by McCormick's; bought at Costco). I wouldn't make them again; took WAY too long!

This took a long time to make, but turned out GREAT.  I brought it to a Mexican buffet dinner tonight and everyone RAVED about it!!  I added a small can of diced green chili peppers and I layered the corn tortillas lasagna style instead of enchilada style.  It was really perfect.

These were great.  Even my little one, who dislikes tomatos, not onlyhad two helpings at dinner that night, wanted more for breakfast the next day.  At last a recipe that both kids enjoyed, not to mention myself.  This is a keeper.

Wow!  As good as any restaurant.  I followed some of the recommendations.  My teens pick at tomatoes, but by blending them with my hand-held food processor, it was perfect!  Didn't have chili peppers on hand so I used a small can of diced chilies.  Although I like fresh, this is definitely the way to go.  Heavy cream not necessary.  I warmed up a pinch of non-diary creamer and it was just fine.
    This recipe is a keeper.  Whole family loved!  Thanks Gerry.

This is a 10 star recipe!!! I add 1 can of cream of mushroom soup & sour cream to the enchilada sauce so it's not so tangy. Also added 8 jalapenos. DELICIOUS!!! I have been told by many people these are by far the best enchiladas they have every had. Well worth the time they take!

The mixture for inside the shells was very runny, probably could do without chicken broth, but overall really liked all the flavor! My husband went back for seconds which is unusual with enchiladas:o)

I make this for company and for my boyfriend. i have never had anyone not love this dish. I like to add chipotle bullion cubes to the chicken while simmering and also sprinkle on top. I also omit the hot peppers and replace it with a small jar of Very hot salsa or even better--chopped chipolte peppers.  Also prefer diced tomatoes to stewed. Stewed are just too big. I have also done the Chicken simmering in a crockpot and it turns out great! This is the best recipe I have found on this site. Absolutely Love It! And so does everyone else!  I have become famous for this dish.

I did what most people suggested on here.  My suggestion ADD a bunch of fresh finely chopped Cilantro to the tomatoes, peppers, soup and broth to create more flavour. Awesome!

Superb! Worth the time & effort & it's definitely time-consuming. Took much longer than stated but oh well. Because it was taking so long I decided to serve this for dinner the NEXT day - I finished everything including baking it & then reheated it. Turned out great. I followed the recipe as is except didn't use cream, instead heated up the tortillas until pliable in a non-stick pan (no oil nec.) & my hubby, the prince, said to NOT CHANGE A THING (he said they were the best he's ever had). I might try a different marinade (I used a chipotle one) cuz mine had a strong flavor but it was still awesome. This made 9 or 10 'chiladas. Might try using the crockpot next time too. Thanks - a keeper for sure!

This has to be one of the meals I've received the most praise from! I've been making it for quite some time now, and although it still takes a while, I'm getting better at cutting down the time. I use about a half of a bag of frozen chicken tenders you can buy from HEB or any other grocery store, and don't use the chile peppers, as it is just perfect for my taste without them. Instead of reducing the sauce I use it all, splitting it between two pans of enchiladas - since I use more chicken I always have enough for two batches, which ends up being perfect for the amount of sauce made. Also I have always used flour tortillas when making this recipe and wouldn't go any other way. I've also used this recipe to make chicken tacos instead of the enchiladas, which are great as well.

This was wonderful....The only thing I did differently was marinade in a chipotle sauce found at the supermarket where the barbecue sauce is. One more thing dont preheat your oven so soon!!!GREAT RECIPE!!!!

This is now my favorite thing I've made.  I loved it and my guy did too.  It is definitely all together a 2 1/2 to 3 hour project and I was pretty exhausted after but well worth it!  I had them for lunch the next day and they're just as good reheated.  I didn't use the green onions though.  You really do need a big skillet to do this.  Thanks Gerry!!!

This was okay.  I was so excited about this recipe because of all the wonderful comments, but I was not thrilled with the results.  It also was messy and time consuming.  The guests I made it for enjoyed it though...so maybe it was just me.

This recipe is time consuming, but at the end what you have is delicious, perfect enchiladas.  They even LOOK perfect.  Amaazing, delicious, and I'll make them again someday when I have the time!  Great for a Sunday dinner ;-)

I, a Texas-born and reared Mexifood-aholic, now living overseas without a "fix" in sooo long, would like to THANK Gerry Graham from the bottom of my heart! My husband and I just KNOW there must have been a TexMex Kitchen Angel hiding in the cupboard or something... These enchiladas are absolutely fabulous.  Just prepare yourself for a lengthy time getting the sauce to reduce.  Believe me, it will be a labor of LOVE!

WOW!!!  I've never made enchiladas before and how lucky I was to pick this great recipe!  I will need to plan this for the weekends, since it took a bit longer to prepare, but was totally worth it!

Thank you!

Oh my goodness!!!  These are the best enchiladas; I made them for a small group of people (I doubled the recipe) and they disappeared in 5 minutes.  They take a long time to make, one of those once-a-year meals, but the end result is excellent!!!

My new favorite enchilada recipe!  Next time I'll cut the chicken into bigger chunks instead of strips so they don't take so long to separate out.  The enchiladas were well worth the work!  Thank you!

I served this dish to my pokeno group and they absolutely loved it!  I warned them about the lengthy prep time, but they agreed that as long as they had the time to devote to it, this dish would be well worth the extra effort required.

I have made this twice and loved it. Instead of a jar of enchilada sauce I used a recipe from this site and made my own. Enchiladas are made with corn tortillas and that is what I used. Followed recipe exact except to add a little Cumin to the skillet while cooking the chicken. Really good stuff here.

When shredding the chicken, all you have to do is boil the chicken in water putting your seasonings in it. Once the sauce is made you can add the chicken in and it works and taste the same. Hope this helps anyone....

Very Very good, did not have chicken broth, added a half a can of water and it was fine.  Not sure I really needed to buy the cream and dredge the tortillas in them.  I would make this again.

I made this the other night, the only thing I did different was to omit the heavy cream and corn tortillas, we prefer flour. And the marinade I used was a chipotle pepper. They were so delicious! This is my chicken enchilada recipe from now on. THANK YOU!!

This was maybe a tad labor intensive and time consuming but the end result was so worth it.  I scaled it up to 8 servings because the package of corn tortillas had 8 in it and we are feeding 5, some of whom are young men who consume massive quantities of food.  The "6" inch tortillas seemed too small, I went with the 8 inch.  I probably didn't need to scale it up to 8 servings because this recipe produces quite enough filling to OVER stuff 6 tortillas, or adequately stuff 8 - 8 inch tortillas.  There was plenty of filling.  The only thing I did differently was to add 1 cup of shredded queso fresco to the 3 cups of cheddar cheese, we like things a little cheesier with the queso flair to it.  It was perfect.  We served it with refried beans and I didn't have time or space on my stove top for the Mexican rice I usually make, but it would have been awesome at soaking up the sauce from the enchiladas.  Will make this again, there are some things I can do ahead to make this easier and less time consuming.  The end result was completely worth the effort.  YUM.

I have been using this recipe for years, and always get RAVE reviews on how amazing these enchiladas are! I follow the recipe exactly as printed, but I don't marinate the chicken simply because I don't think it needs it. To cut back on time, I use a food processer to get the chicken mixture all whirred together to make a fabulous filling. My husband is always begging me to make this! Thanks for the great recipe!

First words out of my husbands mouth after the first bite, "WOW! this is just like a restaurant...only better!" Even better the next day.  I tweaked a few things ONLY because I can't do spicy (so I omitted the chile peppers, but husband used Sriracha sause on his servings). I also used flour tortillas so I did not use the heavy cream for softening.  The real secret to this recipe is letting the sauce condense into liquid yummy-ness!  I had the time, so mine simmered for 1 1/2 hours.  It tasted so good, that I did not use store bought enchilada sauce drizzled on the top, but the sauce that simmered instead.  Instead of using 2 cups on the bottom of the casserole pan, I used slightly less and then drizzled the remaining over the top, then adding cheese and baking.  The sause is soaked up by the flour tortillas and is just so awesome!  I'm can't wait to try this with pork or beef!

I thought that this receipe was pretty good, my family liked it.  With kids I don't make it too spicey, so I just did some peppers. Also, to make it alittle easier, I slow cooked my chicken all day and then did the sauce with the chicken without the "cooking time".  Turn out great.  I slow cooked with some chicken broth, taco and enchilada seasoning, tomatoes for sweetness alittle Cream of chicken  soup, used the rest later.

Delicious!!! I used a mandolin to slice my onions really thin. I also strained a lot if the onions and tomatoes out and mixed them with my chicken to keep it extra moist - this also helps stretch it a but! I had some left over sauce that the chicken cooked in and used that as some liquid for my rice - it was extra tasty! I also just warmed my tortillas in a hot skillet per package instructions to not add extra fat IR calories.  I will definitely be making these again!

Delicious! I use flour tortillas instead and microwave each for 10 seconds before filling.   And - don't dump the extra tomato/soup mixture! Pour over white rice for an excellent side dish to serve with the enchiladas.

I've been making this recipe for a long time now. I absolutely love it. However, you can DEFINITELY simplify it to where it really isn't a chore at all, if you don't mind chopped chicken rather than shredded:  1) dice the chicken 2)saute the chicken in a large skillet 3) dump in all the remaining ingredients and simmer until it is reduced and not too watery. Leave out the broth. 4) build your enchiladas and cook!  It tastes just the same as the long method and is super easy!

This was good, but only good. Did not feel it was worth all the effort. I did like the idea w/ soaking the tortillas.

While I often do not change the recipe much, with this I omitted a few things. I didn't marinate the chicken and I'm glad I didn't! The flavor that the chicken gets from the tomatos, onion, and green chilies is awesome. I also didn't dip my tortillas in heavy cream. When the directions called for Cream of Chicken Soup I was a little worried. I wanted to make a very authentic type of enchilada and that concerned me, but honestly it didn't take away from anything. I do feel it's a necessary ingredient though because it makes the sauce not so thin. As for the sauce, it takes FOREVER to reduce. When adding it to the chicken know that it will not be a 'paste', and truethfully, do you really want a paste?! When putting the sauce in the bottom of the pan I just strained out the tomatoes, onion, and chilies and laid them all on the bottom, then I rolled up the tortilas and poured more of the cooked sauce over them. Why add a pre-made generic tasting 'Enchilada Sauce' when you have this awesome sauce YOU MADE?! I added a small amount just because I bought the stuff, but next time it's a big ol' NO. Very time consuming recipe but VERY VERY WORTH IT.

UPDATE: HAD TWO ENCHILADAS AND MY LEFTOVER RICE FOR LUNCH YESTERDAY. I ACTUALLY PREFER THESE AS LEFTOVERS. THEY WERE A BIT MILDER & NOT DRY AT ALL! These were just "OK" for us. Made 6 generously stuffed enchiladas for my bf & I last night. I enjoyed the 'bite' (I used 12 serrano chilies of varying heat & marinated my chx. in a packet of McCormick chx. taco seasoning mix. as directed - i.e. w/ 1/2 c. H2O). I do have a few gripes though: a) there is WAY too much sauce (despite red. to 2 1/4 c.), b) mix. 1/4 c. sauce w/ my chx. didn't produce a "paste" (I needed a tad more), c) I didn't use all of the cheese called for (there is NO WAY that I could stuff 6 (6 in.) tortillas w/ all that shredded chx. & 1.5 c. cheese - and I even used only 3 breasts!), d) using a full 10 oz. can of enchilada sauce & an ENTIRE bunch of green oninos is OVERKILL IMHO & e) there is NO WAY you need 1/2 pint of heavy whipping cream (my God!). My enchiladas turned out VERY soupy, even after cooling for 15 min. I did make 1 change that may have contributed to this.... Instead of dipping my tortillas in cream, I dipped them in warm chx. broth & then poured 3/4 c. cream over them b4 topping w/ (red) enchilada sauce. I've done this b4 (Whit's enchilada recipe) w/ AWESOME results, so I thought the same would work here. Served w/ fiesta rice, tortilla chips & Jarrito's Mexican pop, this was perfect Sun. dinner fare. I'm glad I gave this a try, but I still like Whit's recipe much better. Thx. anyways :)

These were great! My boyfriend eats with me and my family almost every night and never once until now has he asked for the leftovers. I almost fainted when he asked if he could have them for work the next day. He said these were the best enchilada's he's ever had. He even forgave me for asking him to pick up the ingredients for the recipe at the grocery store! My youngest daughter loved them as well. I followed the recipe except I added half a poblano pepper instead of chili peppers.

These are yummy. I kinda messed up the first time and they were still good. I used the extra juice and put it over rice, it was delicious. Also, I have made this as only cheese enchiladas, no chicken....just as good. Great recipe!!!! Thanks for sharing.

Quite delicious and creamy!  Do yourself a favor with these:

-Drain the water from the pan after you cook the chicken and onions.  Only use half a can of chicken broth.  Drain your tomatoes as best you can.  And leave the lid off the skillet for the entire cooking time.  Don't be afraid to turn the heat up a little.  This will make the thickening/reducing go a LOT faster and it still tastes great.
-I use the diced tomatoes with green chiles that are labeled "Hot" and throw in a large anaheim pepper, chopped fine.  That makes this recipe flavorful but not spicy.  Use peppers hotter than anaheims to kick it up a notch.
-Marinate your chicken in whatever you want - I use fresh lime juice, cumin, salt, and fresh garlic.
-Add chopped cilantro to the chicken mixture if you like cilantro - yum, whole new level of flavor!
-Let your corn tortillas soak for a good minute or more in the pan of hot cream.
-If you have a helper you can pull this recipe off in 2 hours, start to finish.  If you don't, it'll take more like 2.5 hours.  The first time you make it is a learning experience.

I make these enchiladas weekly for my family and they cannot get enough of them. I do however skip the heavy cream and just microwave the tortillas for a minute three at a time to soften them up. It seems to work better and it's healthier.

Oh so yummy! We marinaded the chicken in tequila, lime, seasoning salt and garlic. We use the remainder of the skillet mixture to make spanish rice. Mix in with 1 cup of prepared white rice. Makes for an awesome side dish.

Fantastic!  I made a couple changes to the recipe as I had some extra time, it came out so delicious!  For the Chicken I put four breasts in 1 can of Tomato Sauce, 1 can of Stewed Tomatoes, and Bill Echols Taco Seasoning I and Slow Cooked it for about 8hrs on Low.  I added the shredded Chicken to the skillet mixture and used the sauce it cooked in to top the enchiladas.  SO good!

Very authentic tasting! Great with sour cream on top and cornbread on the side:) The only change I will make next time is using flour tortillas in place of corn.

Yes, these are time consuming, but soooo worth it.  I use a rotisserie chicken to save time (I buy when I feel like it, shred it and then freeze, then when I'm ready, it's there.) I have shared this recipe with others and everyone has loved it. It's great and are requested often.

Very good, instead of heavy cream I left a little sauce in the pan and heated the tortillas on it one at a time, then put the remainder on top. I also added olives on top and inside the enchiladas and a mixture of cheddar and monteray jack cheese.

These taste delicious!   After reading so many posts about the preparation taking a long time, I decided to try and do it shorter and was successful!  It took me maybe an hour and a half - and I made boxed Mexican Rice while I was at it.  :-)  

I cooked the chicken and onions in oil.  While sizzling, I poured all my canned stuff into a larger skillet (I used a wok) and started heating.  When the chicken was mostly done (maybe all the way?) I added it all to the sauce.  I didn't lower heat and simmer... I basically boiled the sauce, stirring every couple minutes.  Meanwhile I made rice and preheated the oven.  

When I knew the chicken was done, I picked it out with tongs (cut the chicken in big chunks) and let it cool while the sauce continued to simmer.  It was actually "simmered down" by the time I was done shredding the chicken.  Maybe I didn't do a good job of shredding... but it was enough.  I used flour tortillas and green sauce.  Oh, I also used half a can of diced jalepenos instead of chile peppers.  It was great!  I froze half of what I made and will definitely make again.

Excellent!  These were pretty easy to make - and the flavor was great.  I wanted to make them slightly heathier so my changes were to not use the cream, use the "healthy" cream of chicken soup, and only 2 cups of 2% shredded cheese.  I also got 12 enchiladas out of it - not 6.  Thanks for the recipe!

Awesome!  I used the 10 min enchilada sauce on this site to top it off.  It was great!  I made seven enchiladas and used about half as much chicken as the recipe calls for.  They made for a very flavorful dinner.

We recently moved from Texas to another state.  Needless to say, we have been unsuccessful at finding good Mexican food.  So I decided to make these for my family.  Oh Wow!  They were awsome.  Well worth the extra time it took.  I did make a few changes.  I used a package of chicken tenders and marinated them in the McCormick Southwest marinade (dry mix that you add oil and vinegar to) as per someone's recomendation.  However, I ended up wiping most of it off because I was worried it would overpower the taste.  I did leave a little on and it seemed to be just enough.  I also left out the chilis because I wanted my kids to be able to eat it. (with the marinade, Rotel and ench. sauce it was plenty flavorful.)  I put my stewed tomatos through the food processor for a smoother texture and I was out of green onion so I just left that out and had no problems.  If you do decide to make these, DO NOT SKIP the warming of the tortillas in the cream.  Not a fan of corn tortillas myself, I had never tried this technique so I gave it a shot.  You will be amazed at the difference.  Just make sure you let them get really soft.  After I had them all dipped, filled and rolled, I took the rest of the skillet mixture, combined it with equal parts canned enchilada sauce (Rosarita) and spooned it over the top.  Then I added the rest of the cheese, popped it in the oven and seved it up with some black beans and Mexican rice.  We will have these again soon!!! Thanks!

I have varied this recipe based on what ingredients I have and on how much time I have to cook, but every time I get rave reviews! No one can get enough of these enchiladas! I prefer corn tortillas and my husband likes flour, so I usually make some of each in the same batch. I reccomend using the recipe for Tequila Lime chicken from this website to marinate the chicken before cooking.

This recipe was good but not great.  It might be better if made with flour tortillas instead of corn.

Wow these took forever to make. They were pretty good, but not worth all the work and the cleanup (you use soo many dishes and pans). 
As for the recipe itself, I was pleased for the most part although I had a hard time getting the sauce to thicken and it made it pretty runny. I made the enchilada sauce using the recipe from this website and it was a nice touch. I used half corn tortillas and half large flour, and my husband preferred the flour tortillas saying they held together better (it was hard to fit much filling in the corn tortillas) although both types tasted good.

Wow...these are some of the best enchiladas I've ever eaten.  Since my husband prefers flour tortillas, I used them instead of corn.  I made this dish with the Red Enchilada Sauce that I also found on this site.

This was a wonderful enchilada recipe and I've tried many.  My only suggestion was to place the sauce ingredients in your blender or food processor.  I preferred the sauce to be less chunky.  It didn't affect the taste, just changed the texture.

I followed the recipe to a "T" and they came out great. I was asked for the recipe, and praised often for this one. 
O.K. so, it almost seemed as if the author, bless their heart, was trying to think of extra steps as I went along following the recipe. For instance, why simmer the chicken with the enchilada stew mixture and then have to dig it out? Well, I did it according to the recipe, all I can figure is that the acidity of the tomato mixture helps to break down the chicken to make it shred up real nicely. I bought hatch red chile enchilada sauce, the hot version, and they were still not hotter than they should be. The only thing I would try differently, though I did it the way the recipe said to do it, would be to try making it with the corn tortillas in oil instead of heavy cream, only to save a little money on a step that might be uneccesary. If you want them to turn out perfect though, follow the recipe the first time and then do what you want after everyone tells you what a wonderful cook that you are.
Yummilicious!

I went about making this with confidence based on the reviews, but was extremely disappointed.  Perhaps I should have used another reviewer's suggestion and omitted the chicken broth, because my mixture never reduced, and I let it simmer for an hour and a half.  Plus, it was very time consuming.  I ended up making up my own recipe, (all with stuff I had on hand) which actually turned out fabulous, according to my husband.  He said they were the best enchiladas he has ever had, this a high praise from his being used to Texas cooking.  (See "Angela's Awesome Enchiladas" once it appears on this site if you want to try.) Shredding the chicken is a must though for authentic enchiladas, no matter what recipe, it is worth the effort.

very good. i made it as written, except i also left the chicken breasts whole to cook in the sauce. i didn't let the sauce boil down to 2 1/2 cups, but that was fine. it made wwwaaayyyy more that 6 enchiladas! i stacked them up, so i guess it was good i didn't boil the sauce down! i didn't think it was that time consuming to prepare.
i added some jalapeno for more spice. i like the one reader's suggestion of cooking the chicken in the crockpot with the sauce. will do that next time. i will also try it with chicken from rotisserie chickens from the grocery store.

these were so good!! I am not a fan of corn tortillas so I used flour and they were wonderful! I prefer my mexican style food a little spicier so I added 2 habanro peppers and omitted the extra can of tomatoes!  Yummy I am making this for dinner again tonight!

This is awesome.  I ended up with a 13"X9" pan full of enchiladas.  I read a few reviews and took a cue from them.  I did not cover the dish as much so that the sauce would reduce.  We had leftovers on the 2nd night and it was even better than fresh.  Prep time was not too bad.  About 3 hours from start to eating.

GREAT RECIPE!!  Just a few comments.  First of all, you do not need to preheat your oven at step 2 because, as other reviewers have mentioned, this recipe takes a while to prepare.  I preheated my oven just prior to assembling the enchiladas.  I was going to omit the dipping of the tortillas in cream, but glad I didn't.  Those corn tortillas can break so easily.  Also, the recipes says to cover and cook the chicken for 20-30 minutes.  No need to cover, actually.  Without the cover your sauce will reduce quicker!  I used an electric frying pan and it turned out GREAT and I didn't have to wait forever for the sauce to reduce.  I did not include the optional 12 chile peppers and our enchiladas still had a nice kick of hotness.  Thanks for sharing!!

I tend to agree with most everyone that it's a pretty good dish, but she's not kidding about how much time it takes. Yikes. Things I would consider changing: definitely less liquid! The chicken was done and I still had 3+ cups of soupy stuff on my hands.  Most of the time spent was waiting for that to reduce.  I didn't even add the enchilada sauce because I had too much of the broth/soup mixture that would have gone to waste otherwise.  I would consider skipping the broth altogether and adding a little water instead.  If I ever make this again (which will most definitely be on a weekend, not weekday, night) I may consider using canned chicken instead because it's already cooked *and* shredded.  Lastly, I found that the leftovers were kind of soggy.  I might just try warming the tortillas in the toast-r-oven rather than dipping them in the cream.

This was A LOT of work, but very good in the end. I'm giving 5 stars for taste, but I just don't know if I'll make it again because there has got to be a faster, less arduous way of making something similar!

I tend to raise an eyebrow when a review here is rated 5 stars despite heavy alterations to the base recipe, but this one is king as far as I'm concerned.

Following the recipe exactly, this one has me coming back time and time again. While I love to experiment with recipes most of the time, Gerry's Chicken Enchiladas are sacrosanct.

Have you ever found a recipe on this site, forgot to mark it, and struggled to find it some time later? This one was worth digging for again. In my opinion, the other enchiladas recipes on this site (while good!) don't compare to Gerry's. 

This might not be the right recipe if you're looking for something quick and easy after work. The prep is  longer than some of the simpler Enchilada recipes. If you can afford the time, it's worth the effort here. It pairs wonderfully with the budgetbytes Enchilada sauce recipe in my experience.

While I bookmarked this recipe now, when looking for this recipe,  "Gerry's Chicken Enchiladas" has become almost muscle memory to type into the search bar when the family says, "Let's make those really good enchiladas."

we did not like these after following this recipe, and then my wife pointed out that using canned soup along with boneless, skinless chicken breasts made for a lack of taste. she suggested making a roux in place of the soup and using chicken legs and thighs with bones and skin. both those recs made huge differences.

This  recipe was great. I doubled the recipe. I did not have any enchilada sauce, so I made my own using  a can of tomato sauce, garlic, water, cumin, chili  powder, parsley, and  oregano. I also used condensed cream of chicken soup, so I just used an entire  32oz box.  . I added a can of sweet corn and a mixture of green and black olives. I blended it all together and let the liquid simmer down. I only had chicken drumsticks, so I marinated it in a pineapple juice and chili sauce with some spices for a couple of hours and then added onion to it and cooked it in the oven at 400 until it was done. As the chicken cooked, I reduced the sauce. Then I shredded my meat and followed the rest of the recipe exactly.

After the chicken marinades (we use Lawry's Santa Fe), it only takes about an hour to cook, and only 20 minutes (maybe less) of us actually doing anything. It's easy, with simple ingredients, and even though it's all from a can, it tastes great! I've never had a better enchilada, not even an authentic one from a Mexican restaurant. We usually use vegetable broth instead of chicken broth, which, in my opinion, makes it taste about a thousand times better. Thinking of trying this with fresh ingredients! I'm also trying to find a way to make this recipe vegan or vegetarian. Maybe I'll update this when I figure it out!! 

EDIT: Putting the tortillas in the cream isn't really the best idea, as I've found. Sticking the tortillas in the microwave between two paper towels gets them soft and they fall apart a little less. I've also found that using blue corn tortillas is about a million times easier and tastier. 

Oh! And! The amount of filling you put into the tortillas for this recipe is way too much. We can make up to 12 enchiladas with this recipe, so I recommend cutting back on the chicken. 

I would also recommend putting more of the sauce into the chicken to get a more flavorful taste. It doesn't really turn out very paste-like, but it's so delicious, my boyfriend and I can just eat it straight.

These turned out very good. I followed others suggestions and cooked my chicken breasts whole with the skillet mixture in the crockpot.  I browned the chicken in oil but I think it was unnecessary. I shredded the chicken and put the skillet mixture in a sauce pan and cooked on med high to reduce. I also used an immersion bender to purée. It took about 20 minutes to reduce.  I was able to get a dozen enchiladas out of my 4 breasts and sauce. Next time I will probably skip the heavy cream step to soften the tortillas and just layer the casserole lasagna style.  Served with homemade guacamole, sour cream and Spanish rice.  Thanks for a great dinner Gerry!

This is a messy one! My kitchen looks like a tornado went through it. I added cilantro and used low fat/low sodium ingredients for this recipe.  It was very good! I'd make the enchiladas again but perhaps I'll do it in a more streamlined manner.

Tasted wonderful!  Like it came from a good Mexican restaurant.  However, I only gave it four stars because it took forever to make--the chicken was difficult to shred and the sauce took much longer to reduce than anticipated.  But then again, I'm kinda slow.  Give it a try on a Saturday when you've got time to spend on it.

wow!  So yummy.  I didn't marinate the chicken but I can't wait to try some of the suggestions on here.  It did take a long time for the liquid to reduce.. but I'm glad I didn't alter the recipe at all.  It was amazing.  Thanks!

I did a few things different on this recipe to make it my own! I used left over chicken that was seasoned with taco seasoning and then added a chopped red and yellow pepper. I also mixed chopped green onions in the chicken. I also added a bit of the cream and a small brick of Velveeta cheese the chicken. I cooked Spanish rice to it as well. I then filled floured tortillas with mixture and shredded taco cheese.  I do have to say that putting the tortilla's in the cream made them so moist and tasty! My whole family loved this recipe!

This recipe was delicious.  I only changed some things like using olive oil and wheat flour tortillas.  I cooked some instant spanish rice before rolling the enchiladas and putting them in the oven.

These are the best chicken enchiladas I've ever made, and I've tried a handful of recipes. Absolutely worth the extra time and effort. I don't marinade the chicken, I just sprinkle it and the onions with cumin, salt and pepper while they brown. I usually just have diced tomatoes on hand so I use a big can of those, and then add a small can of chilies. I don't add the extra chilis to keep it mild for kids. I use flour tortillas because that's just what we're used to, and no enchilada sauce on top. It doesn't need it since everything is so moist between being cooked in liquid and dipped in cream, and I'm not going to ruin a slave-over-the-stove recipe with a pre prepared sauce. Sometimes I'll add olives on top with the cheese. Always a hit and an all around favourite.

These are FANTASTIC! The only change I will make is next time I will use 1/2 can of stewed tomatoes only because we are not big tomato eaters. This is a great recipe for kids to help with since there are so many steps involved, my 4 yr old had a great time. Thanks Gerry!

Delicious!!!    Followed recipe exactly, however I did use an emulsion blender to finish the sauce at the end.  Mine made 10 enchiladas using 6" corn tortillas.  My teenage son ate 4 of them!!  Definitely will be making again.

Made these exactly as the recipe stated and they were fabulous!! Next time I would leave the chicken in bigger pieces while cooking in the sauce only because it was a bit difficult to fish the smaller pieces out. Overall an EXCELLENT recipe - thank you Gerry!!

Fantastic!  I used two cans of diced tomatoes instead of one can of diced and one can of stewed, I marinated the chicken in a packet of fajita seasoning and I served them with spanish rice.  I opted against corn totillas and used flour because my mom and I don't like corn tortillas very much, and flour tortillas were easier to work with.  These took a loooooooong time to make (from marinating the chicken to serving took me almost two and a half hours), and I don't think the chicken mixture simmered for me as much as it should have, but it still came out tasty and I'd say the extra time was worth it if you have a free evening and want to make something special.  My mom and my brother both loved it and want me to make them again.  Major props, Gerry.

Not the best enchiladas I've ever eaten, but they were good and my husband and I cleaned our plates and have been eaten the leftovers for lunches. Next time I am going to use flour tortillas and add a little cream cheese to the chicken. Thanks for the recipe!

My husband loved these.  I didn't think that they took all that long to make like some other reviewers stated and I thought they were very easy.  I bought chicken breast tenderloins which were very easy to cut into one inch strips.  I then put them in a plastic zip lock bag and marinated them with a packet of Mccormick enchilada seasoning, 1/4 cup of water, and a little lime juice for about an hour and then browned them in the skillet with the onions for a couple mins.  For the sauce I used two cans of diced tomatoes with green chile peppers instead of one stewed as I thought the stewed tomatoes would be too big.  I also added one chicken bouillon to one cup of water and added that in instead of a whole can of chicken broth.  The only other thing I did differently was I used flour tortillas as they did not have corn ones at my grocery store.  Instead of cream I just popped them in one by one into the microwave for about 10 seconds each and that worked very well.  This was great and I will definitely be making again!

Husband raved, the kids liked it and it reheats well! I followed the comments and boiled the four chicken breasts in taco seasoning (you can use fajita as well). I also used flour tortillas instead of corn (I didn't want to dip them in cream.)I threw the diced tomatoes and a can of chopped green chiles (no fresh) in to the food processor--this worked out well. I also used a can of "regular" diced tomatoes (without chiles) instead of stewed tomatoes, as I didn't want the large chunks. I didn't put any of the filling at the bottom of the tray, just the tortillas seam-down. Then covered with a can of enchilada sauce, cheddar cheese, chopped green onions and chopped olives. This recipe is a LARGE serving--I ended up with eleven packed enchiladas! I froze an entire tray and had some to spare for that night. I will definitely add this to my recipe book and make again!

Made this last night, and after 2 hours of cooking, it was finally done. My boyfriend LOVED these. I wish I was joking when I tell you I caught him licking his plate. I asked if he's been taking manner tips from the kids lol. He took more for lunch today.

This is the best Chicken Enchiladas recipe I have found.  My wife and I are very picky when it comes to Mexican, but we are very satisfied with this recipe.  I don't make many changes.  I chop the chicken instead of shred to save a few minutes.  Also, I put the tortillas in a hot skillet instead of the cream to soften them up.  If you can get fresh made tortillas at your grocery, that is the best.  Also, I prefer corn enchiladas over flour.  You can also add the peppers when rolling only to half, if you want to keep some mild for the kids.  Takes a while, but it is worth it.

I thought these were pretty fantastic! They really tasted like enchiladas from a restaurant! The chicken soaked overnight in my fav. chicken marinade: a package of spicy taco seasoning, about 1/3 cup of water, a bit of oil, and about 1/4 cup of salsa all mixed together.
I didn't add any seasonings or anything (which I usually do) and I followed the recipe for the most part, except that I couldn't find chile peppers at the store so I substituted with 4 chopped fresh jalapenos. I also added one can each of corn and black beans and omitted the can of chicken broth as my pan was looking quite full and there was plenty of liquid. I actually had to drain some of it (mostly tomato water). My 9x13 pan was stuffed to the brim and I had lots of leftovers. I got 8 enchiladas out of this, but I also kept a lot of the sauce (There was way more than 2 1/2 cups left but it was all the good stuff so I didn't want to throw it away). The only thing is that everything kind of turned to mush so it's not really 'enchiladas' anymore but I'm sure it's something I did. It doesn't matter anyways, because they were great!

I didn't have time to read many of the detailed reviews so apologize if I am repeating.  First - this was SO DELICIOUS!  Wow.  I am not a fast cook... so when I hit the 1.5 hour point I started to wonder if it was possibly worth the time. (They took me 2 hours to make including the baking time.) But now that I have leftovers for 2-3 days, I think it is!  

Minor modifications I made are below.  I think following it to the "T" would have been just as delicious though.  
- Used a 4 oz can of green chile peppers instead of the fresh ones.
- The enchilada sauce I chose was "medium".  I would have added 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper if it wasn't already medium.
- I used chicken tenders instead of breasts.  I did not marinate them first.  I don't think this would add much.  They simmer for so long - they are going to take on those flavors anyway, and be very tender from all the simmering too.  
- I only used about 1/2 the broth, and even then it took a LONG time to reduce to 2 1/4 cups.  In fact I gave up when it got to about 3 cups as it seemed thick enough.  
- I mixed the cheese in to the chicken and sauce mixture so it didn't have to be added seperately when stuffing the tortillas.
- I didn't have any green onions so left them out.  I'm not sure they would have added much, it is absolutly delicious without them.  

This made 11 large enchiladas for me.  Hubby and I ate 2 each at dinner, so I have leftovers for days!

Wow!!! These are so good.  I roasted 2 poblano peppers and chopped them and added them.  I didn't dip the tortillas, i just warmed them up slightly.

This is a terrific recipe!  I didn't even follow it exactly and it turned out great, and really didn't take too long. I marinated the chicken in the juice of a lime, salt, garlic, and fresh chopped cilantro. I sauteed onion and green pepper, then added the chicken, cooked the chicken until it was done, then added the rest of the ingredients (I used 2 cans of tomatoes with chilis instead of a can of stewed.) I simmered it for about 10 minutes, then pulled the chicken out and let it boil on med/high heat for about 20 minutes. I used a handheld salsa maker to shred the chicken, skipped the cream step (I used flour tortillas and they were nice and soft), and they turned out awesome! I also took other's suggestions and only used a half a can of chicken broth. This is definitely a keeper!

These were fantastic!!!!  Being that I made these during the week and I know enchiladas take awhile to prepare, I did a few things differently.  I used leftover chicken that I shredded and had sit in some margarita mix, tequila, cilantro and cumin for flavoring; and I put the tomatoes, chiles, some spices, a can of black beans and some corn into the crock pot and let it sit on low for a few hours (I left out the broth entirely).  Used corn tortillas that I fried up a bit before using the enchilada sauce to warm them up (why cream?  Use enchilada sauce and then pour what's remaining over the enchiladas before they bake).  Was a great dinner and went perfectly with the cornbread I served with it.  THANKS!

Wonderful flavor and wasn't as time consuming as other reviews have said.  The things I changed:  left out chicken broth completely, used evaporated milk to soak tortillas, used flour instead of corn tortillas.  Will definitely use this recipe again!

I really like these enchiladas (but I haven't really tried many others, so I can't say if they're "the best" or not...) WHAT I DID DIFFERENTLY: I used 8-inch flour tortillas instead of corn and managed to fill 8 of them. So I'm surprised the original recipe only calls for SIX 6-inch corn tortillas! Also, I used 2 8x8 pans so I could serve one for dinner and freeze one for later. So 4 enchiladas in each. NEXT TIME: I'll try the suggestions of skipping the chicken broth, or just adding half of it. Like others have already said, it took a LONG time for the sauce to reduce; simmered for almost 2 hours but still measured at slightly over 3 cups when I started assembling everything. But at that point, at least it was already thick enough. Will also try using just milk to heat/coat the tortillas instead of heavy cream...

AWESOME!!!
Followed previous reviewers suggestion to marinade chicken in lime juice,garlic and kosher salt and use a can of chopped chiles.
Cut the chicken broth in half,sauce reduced down in an acceptable time.
It does take a little longer than posted to make but the resukt is worth every minute.

Only used one can of stewed tomatoes and still yummy! And I mean REALLY yummy! Make sure you have sour cream on hand, it really makes this dish with just a small dollop on top. Also, make sure your not on a diet - your going to want to go back for thirds!

These were really excellent -- my mother asked me for the recipe, which is about as high as praise gets.  I ended up with enough filling to make twelve enchiladas instead of six, which was terrific as my family turned into ravenous pig-beasts over these.

This is the 5th time I have made these.  My fiance, who is Mexican, prefers this over his mom's recipe. Always a hit.  I actually simmer the chicken longer because I think the chicken absorbs more flavor and gets more tender.

This was a great recipe.  I used flour tortillas instead of corn; dipping them in heavy cream is a stroke of brilliance and results in a great texture.  I didn't find this recipe exceptionally time-consuming, particularly when you consider the wonderful result.  Next time I will add more chili peppers for greater heat and sprinkle some on top before baking as well.  Fabulous!

YummmmmY!  These were the BEST chicken enchilads.  Even better than the ones we get from the restaurants, a whole lot better.  I did make some teeny tiny changes.  I used flour tortillas because that's all I had and I'm glad I did because they made this dish perfect.  I didn't use black olives because I don't like them.  Didn't have stewed tomatoes so I used a can of diced tomatoes.  Didn't have any chili peppers, I sprinkled cayenne instead, We like it spicy.  These did not take as long as some of the others said.  My husband sure did love them, he commented several times how good they were. I most definately will make these again real soon, the sooner the better!  I think they're worth 10 stars.

Thanks Gerry for a wonderful recipe.  The only thing I changed in this recipe was I didn’t add the black olives that were in the photo and I used flour tortillas because I don’t particularly like corn tortillas.  I did cut down the calories a little by using half-in-half.  I think the recipe would be fine using regular milk.  Someone on this site recommended microwaving the tortillas for 5 seconds before dipping in the milk to soften up the tortillas a bit.  I did this and it worked out great.  I also found a wonderful marinate in my grocery store that was a little pricey but worth it.  I comes in a bottle and is called "The Art of Chipotle".  It comes in several different flavors.  I got the Smokey Red Sensation. I didn’t think it was all that time consuming like others suggested on this site.  Most of the time was to cook down the sauce.  I didn’t really have to watch all that much.  That gave me time to enjoy some margaritas.

Gerry, THANK YOU!!  Everyone at my Mexican Fiasco....ahem, Fiesta requested the recipe on this!!  I used "red Gold petite diced mexican fiesta" tomatoes, with lime and cilantro juice....didn't drain and I browned the chicken and threw it in the crock pot with the soup mixture for a few hours, the chicken shredded nicely and was incredibly tender.  Excellent, Thanks!

I was thinking this better be good with all the time they took to cook. It paid off. I don't recommend if you work to try and come home and make these. I didn't get done cooking until 9:30 pm. I decided to leave the uncook enchiladas in the fridge and cook them the next night. They were excellent !!!

I used flour torts dipped in milk rather than corn dipped in cream.  I also added 1/2 tsp chili powder and 1/4 tsp cayenne.  They turned out quite delicious.  The only mistake I made is reducing the sauce too much - I wound up a little short.  (I think this recipe would be equally good if not better with lean ground beef as well.)

This may very well be the longest rating I've ever done.  First, what a pain in the rear to make.  I recommend heating the corn tortillas up in the microwave for a minute or so before you even bother with the cream.  I'm not sure what the cream did for this, but whatever.  I'm guessing that I didn't let them soak long enough and so they broke up which is why I heated mine up.  Second, it's totally worth it!  I marinated the chicken in one cup margarita mix & ground pepper.  I used a poblano pepper for it's mildness.  I drained the tomatoes and onions out of the soup to please the children.  I made 4 with only the wonderfully seasoned chicken a small amount of cheese, topped with Hatch's Enchilada Sauce.  I made 6 with all the fixings, which I added back into the chicken.  I found I still had another 4 enchiladas to make and no soup left, so I rolled them up and topped it off with the half a can of enchilada sauce that I had left.  I can't believe these annoyingly long-to-make enchiladas were worth the time and effort, but they were.  Thank you, Gerry.

This was really good. I followed the recipe as close as possible but I cut down the work by not marinating the chicken as it gets flavored from the sauce anyway. I also shredded the chicken in the food processor by slowly pulsing until it was all shredded. I added canned green chiles and also added about 1/4 or so of sour cream to the chicken mixture. I didn't soak the tortillas and it worked out fine for me. Tasted like the ones at restaurants. Thanks for the recipe!!

Doubled the recipe. Used a Baja chipotle marinade.  As with pretty much every recipe, I added fresh minced garlic.  Changed the onion to a shallot & added onion powder.  Used a can of southwest pepperjack soup (was going to use two and realized I hadn’t bought enough so ended up using cream of mushroom instead – worked out great).  Also added some chipotle into the sauce while it simmered.  Used flour tortillas (personal preference) and made the red enchilada sauce from AllRecipes.  My friends couldn’t get enough – thanks Gerry!

Excellent recipe! You could sell it! I made it with the Red Enchilada Sauce recipe by Sara, but I think canned would work fine also, and I marinated the chicken with Southwest marinade. Warning: this recipe is a lot of work!

Well, as other people have said, it was very time consuming but worth it in the end. Everyone loved these. I think next time I'll use a stewing hen or chicken legs to cut down on the cost. I made the 10 minute enchilada sauce found on this site. It went with it quite well I thought. For some reason I got double the amount of enchilads even though I followed the recipe, which was great since everyone got their fill. I will definitely make these again.

I have been making this same recipe for years. It is time comsuming, but well worth it. I always double it, because I usually make it for family get togethers. I use a Southwest marinade (I think it's McCormick's powdered one that you add oil to). It is the BEST enchilada recipe I have ever made. Whenever I find a faster one to try, it's never the same. I will never use another one. One tip...I put the chicken mix in fridge to cool, and this is when I do clean up to start on next steps.

These are great and a nice change for enchiladas if you're tired of the same old everyday enchiladas.  The sauce has a great taste.  Only changes were using canned chiles instead of fresh and I added cilantro and olives to the filling.  I thought dipping the tortillas in the cream was a strange and unnecessary step.  However, the first time I didn't use it and the second time I did...it really makes a difference!  This recipe does take a while, but it is not at all labor intensive, most of the ingredients are canned.

I made these for a surprise dinner for my boyfriend over the weekend (we both love mexican food) and he loved them.  The only thing that I changed in the recipe was the 12 small chili peppers to 4 small chili peppers.  Everything else was okay.  
I made 5 giant enchiladas, and within 2 days, my boyfriend had eaten all of them.  
Thank you very much Gerry.  Very good recipe.

Towards the end of preparing these enchiladas I was cursing.  It definately takes alot of steps and is very time comsuming.  But when my husband, my son and I sat down to eat them, I realized all the work was worth it.  Quite delicious! The green onions do not need to be added.  I made some with and some without  and the consensus was they were better without.

Excellent!  I used canned chopped chilis instead of the fresh, used chicken tenders and kept them whole while cooking, they were much easier to remove that way.  I also didn't go overboard with the green onions, though that's a matter of preference.  I do feel dipping the tortillas in the cream was a good step - it really made them moist.  (Also used flour ones by the way)  I also added some fresh chopped cilantro at the end in the filling, really added to it.  Mine took roughly 2.5 hours start to finish.  VERY Good.  Even my husband and 17 month old loved them.

Hold on, let me wipe the drool off of my face. These are so deliciously genius! I have made vegetarian versions of this as well as the real deal, several times, in large batches for groups. At first I thought there was too much liquid that was being unused, but I find lots of uses for the extra sauce now, like flavoring for rice as a side.

I made this for my niece's birthday dinner and it was fantastic.  Everyone loved them and asked for the recipe.  There is a lot of work in it, but I also made my own enchilada sauce which I found here on Allrecipes.  I will be making this again and again.

This recipe tasted good, but wasn't worth the time it took to create it.  I realize that the person who submitted it acknowledged that it wasn't easy, but it took an entire afternoon to get these ready.  If you live near a decent Mexican restaurant, you could be there and back before these are ready...I'm sure there's a better enchilada recipe out there for me.

oh my goodness!  These have got to be some of the BEST enchiladas I have ever had.  My enire family loved it and the leftovers went before I could get to them the next day.  My mexican mother said that she liked this enchilada better than her own (a very high compliment since I think hers are great.)  Anyway, I slow cooked the chicken all day with rotelle tomatoes and chili and all the other ingredients that go in there too.)  It comes out so moist and flavorful.  Delicious!

Fabulous recipe.  I am hard pressed to find better enchiladas than these in Texas restuarants.  These are a bit of work, but they get easier every time that I make them.  When I made them on my electric stove it took FOREVER for the mixture to reduce.  On my gas stove, it's no problem.  If you're in a rush, leave out the chicken broth.  It saves a LOT of time -- just be sure to watch the mixture -- it needs a little more attention for the short time that it needs to cook.  I also use flour tortillas warmed in the microwave -- I'm sure that saves some time too.

Without this recipe, a Texan would have had to survive without good Tex-Mex in Minnesota.  Thanks!

Yum! I made largely according to the directions, although had to fiddle a bit with the ingredients--my small Toronto grocery store was not well-stocked. This was delicious, and I didn't find the work involved to be too bad, especially since most ingredients are canned. Served with some steamed veggies for a bit of health, and cornbread to sop up the extra sauce!

Absolutely delicious... time-consuming, yes, but rich, flavorful and extremely popular at my house! I made a couple of meatless enchiladas filled with just plain refried beans for my vegetarian sons and tucked them into the baking pan alongside the other enchiladas. The delectable sauce infused even these plain-jane versions with spicy flavor... and of course, the "real thing" with braised shredded chicken was even better! My husband said these were better than my mom's enchiladas, which is the highest praise imaginable. :)

I've made this recipe at least five times in the last month--these are the best enchiladas I've ever had!!!  I don't even like corn tortillas, but the combination of soaking them in the heavy cream and baking them on top of the sauce makes them wonderful.  I marinate the chicken in margarita mix with a little extra lime juice and use a can of diced chilis--I plan on making these for my family in Texas when I visit soon--I know they'll be a hit!

Like others suggested, I did not use the diced chili peppers. I also made my own "Red Enchilada Sauce" from this web site.I also used pre-cooked mesquite chicken from Costco. These were "So Terrific!" I have only one thing to add! The longer you soak the Tortillas in the warm cream the softer they become & the easier to work with!

Wow! We are from Texas and have eaten MANY enchiladas, but this one surpasses them all! I have never eaten enchiladas so quickly. They were so delicious! My husband, who is a native Texan couldn't get over them. He said they were far better than any restaurant. It took 3 hours to prepare them, but like everyone else has said, well worth it! I followed the recipe, except adding a can of green chiles instead of chopping 12 of them myself. I removed the lid the entire time the skillet mixture thickened. This is the part that took the longest (at least an hour on medium-low heat), but I just did other things around the house, returning to occassionally stir the mixture. Although it takes a while to prepare, it is very easy to make. I can't wait to eat the leftovers! And yes, we were able to fit 9 enchiladas in the pan and there was plenty of chicken to fill all of them using only 3 chicken breasts. Thank you for this recipe!!

Mmm, this recipe was wonderful!

However, the corn tortillas didn't play nice- when dipped in the sauce they quickly became too soggy and fell apart, and when not dipped they were too brittle and broke. I suppose in retrospect I could have microwaved 'em, but I instead layered them flat and the dish turned out like a quasi-quesadilla-lasagna type thing.  It was great!

I took the leftover corn tortillas and cut them into pies, making some corn chips that were instrumental in sopping up the delicious sauce.

This recipe is a keeper.

Excellent! Excellent! Excellent! There's not much more to say! They are time consuming, but well worth the work. I used shredded chicken that I already had on hand and threw it all in the pot together.  Also, this turned out to be more like a casserole than individual enchiladas. What a fantastic recipe.  Thanks!

This was an excellent recipe!  It didn't take as long as I though it would after reading all of the reviews... it did take a while, but was well worth it!  The flavor is so good, it's obvious that you spent some time preparing it.  I'll be making this often!  Thanks Gerry :)

These enchiladas are awesome!  I hate corn tortillas but I loved them in this recipe.  I don't usually like canned enchilada sauce but combined with all the other ingredients it makes a great sauce.  It only took about 2 1/2 hours so that was a nice surprise after reading all the reviews.  Thanks!

The enchiladas have a good taste, but the next time I'll substitute the stewed tomatoes for some Mexican diced tomatoes. I didn't add the chile peppers since they were optional....I wanted to see how spicy it was the w/o them the first time. I may try 1 or 2 the next time, but definitely not 12. The dish was not nearly as time consuming as I thought it would be. The only problem I had was the corn tortillas kept breaking open before I could get them in the dish. Good recipe overall.

Although it takes a while to make these - it is well worth it!  I marinate the chicken in margarita mix for the day & it give the chicken a great tang.  I can control the heat by adding hotter chilies or mexican style tomatoes.  It is nice to have a recipe that is not based in cream cheese or velveta cheese, but actual mexican fillings.  Great recipe.

Although this entree **did** take a lot of time to prepare, the ending result was truly authentic and fabulous. This is better than anything you would taste in a restaurant. I really recommend that you try this one-- you will not be sorry in the least. :) Overally grade: A+++

This was really excellent, everyone liked it. However, make sure you have time to make it, it does take quite a while. Also used mexican style stewed tomotoes and garlic and onion diced tomatoes and then left out the green chilles. Really good with just the right amount of heat.

Wow- these were good. I always try to strictly follow recipes I rate, but had to cut corners on this one- not a good weeknight recipe for a working girl. It took a little over an hour to prepare my way, but I guarantee that this would be a five star if you follow the recipe to a "T".
My changes included not dipping the corn tortillas, but rather warming them first. Also, I only used 1/2 c. of chicken broth and I used a fajita seasoning mix to cook the chicken in. Finally, I added sour cream to the chicken/sauce paste mix just because I like creamy Mexican things. Yummy, very authentic. Thank you so much!

Very good Enchiladas.  Because I left out the chili peppers ( I was too chicken ;) I would add some cayenne pepper next time.  I marinated in buttermilk.  As was another reviewer, I was a bit sensitive to the saltiness of the sauce; but I love the idea of another reviewer who used the sauce in place of the Enchilada sauce, Fabulous idea.  When I removed the chicken for shredding the sauce reduced perfectly and in only as much time as it took to shred the chicken.

the flavor was very good, excellent, but it made way too much of a sauce, my husband thought it was more like soup. i'd half the sauce ingredients for the amount of enchiladas it makes.

These were very good except they were very salty.  I am a bit sensitive to salt, so take it with a grain.   I will use all low sodium ingredients next go around.

GREAT STUFF...to repeat all the other reviews.
Takes a while to make but worth the effort. I took out the green onions because i'm not a fan, but this did not detract from the taste.  I could start a restaurant with this stuff.

Always judge my cooking on if I’d be happy if I had ordered it from a restaurant. This was a more complex recipe than I expected looking at the ingredients. But wow, I would have left that restaurant happy. I didn’t have the onion for the recipe and it was still delicious, will make this again!

Really good enchilada recipe. The base sauce is delicious and tastes great together with the enchilada sauce (which can be too rich on it's own).  

A couple of things: I used chicken tenders in order to speed up the marinating process (I used time, chicken broth, salt and some cumin).  They cooked in about 20 minutes once in the skillet and then broke apart nicely once I transferred them to a bowl.  Also, so many people complained that it took too long to reduce the sauce. I had no problem doing so; just make sure to cook it so there is a good simmer with bubbles (medium low). Also, I used an immersion blender while still in the skillet in order to break up the tomatoes. This helped to thicken up the sauce, too.

I split the recipe in half: in one dish I made the enchiladas with corn tortillas (homemade from the grocery store) and topped them with red enchilada sauce. In the second dish I used flour tortillas (homemade, bought from the fridge section of Costco. Prepare the tortillas, let them cool, then stuff). Those I topped with green sauce.   I did not dip the tortillas in cream or fry them in oil first.  Many recipes call for this in order to keep the tortillas from falling apart once you roll them up...The enchiladas turned out delicious and were not at all soggy (I think this was because the tortillas were homemade)! 

I used about 2 pounds of chicken and I had just enough sauce. For the chilies I used a small can of diced instead of whole ones since my kids were going

Am I the only one who was confused about the skillet mixture being put in a 9x13 dish at the end of the the 4th step? After the chicken is taken out and shredded? I kept reading it over again and could not figure it out. Anyway, this is maybe my third or fourth time attempting to make enchiladas. How one makes enchiladas right is beyond me. I’m guessing this recipe is great but the way it turned out for me was-edible-but only chocked up to a “casserole” to put it nicely. I also used a lot of dishes so be prepared for that. I don’t see how 4 chicken breasts and all the rest of the ingredients is supposed to make only 6 enchiladas...I fit and made12 so I have no clue how the ratio originally worked for this recipe creator. I probably had a bad brand of corn tortillas, they tore immediately when handling them in the cream and assembling. I feel like it may be just me...but this recipe did not work out.

Used flour tortillas, added garlic and cumin to the skillet tomato sauce and cilantro to the chicken mixture. This turned out amazing!

Im Hispanic so I’ve had my fair share of enchiladas, and nothing remotely close to this. As I was reading the recipe I said that sounds weird but I said what the hell and tried it. The best chicken enchiladas I’ve had in a while! definitely the best home made though. can’t wait to make them again!!

My new enchilada recipe! Even picky eaters loved it! Definitely a labor of love though because it takes time to put together. Only used a 1/4 of the cream. I boiled the chicken

The only thing I really changed was I used water instead of broth.  Between the sodium in the canned soup and the rotel, I didn't want any more salt!
It was just an okay recipe, I ate it, but wouldn't make it again. 
Tje biggest thing was that the recipe called for the chicken to be cut into strips, then allowed to simmer in the "stew".  That's all fine until it's time to shred the chicken.  Trying to fish out all the strips was was more work than it was worth.  If you wish to try this recipe, I would suggest keeping the breasts whole, or at least in big pieces while it's cooking  so it's easier to remove to shred.  
Also, the broth/water was unnecessary.  You end up having to reduce it down as if it had not had broth added, so what's the point in that?  If it's the flavor, you could just throw a bouillon cube in it and same difference.

I made this for a group, I reduced the number of chili peppers from 12 to 8.  I knew this was an authentic recipe due to my time living in the southwest.  In the Midwest though, Nobody had seconds, although everyone liked the flavor.  It was a delayed heat impact.  Seriously, 12 chili peppers should be changed to 4. Beware of the heat.

These enchiladas were superb. I think the only thing I did differently was use a pre-cooked rotisserie chicken as a shortcut. And I used 8" flour tortillas instead of 6" corn; just a personal preference. Will make again!

These were delicious and I will definitely make them again!  I did make a few changes, though, because I didn't have all the ingredients. I cooked the chicken and then realized I would not have time to cook this dish that night, so I finished cooking the chicken, shredded it, tossed it in salsa seasoning spices and put it in the fridge overnight. I didn't have a lot of time the next day, so instead of making the tomato and soups mixture separately, I mixed them in the pan with the chicken that I was heating through from the night before. (Also, my husband offered to help and opened the cans of soup, and while doing so, he thought the broth can was corn, and proceeded to "drain" it. I realized too late what he was doing, so I didn't use chicken broth in making this. Still tasted great.). Based on other reviews, I used flour tortillas and skipped the heavy cream steps. I cooked the chicken/tomato/soup mixture to reduce the volume of liquid, and used the mixture in the rolled tortillas.  I also lightly greased the baking pan to prevent sticking. This made a ton of chicken--I saved half of what I cooked for a second dinner this week. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was very bland and had too much liquid in the enchiladas. I used the red enchilada sauce that was recommended in another review, but still found these very boring. I would not make these again.

If I was to make any changes to it, I would add less chicken broth and add some spice to the mixture like tabasco sauce and a little enchilada sauce to the mix.   Otherwise, it was really good.   And if you use really soft corn tortillas, you don't have to dip them in the warm heavy cream.   I will be making this again.

Really good!  I didn't have cream of chicken soup, so I used cream of celery and it still tasted great.  I also didn't have canned tomatoes, so diced a beefsteak tomato and added some Hatch chiles to substitute.

Oh my goodness! This was by far my favorite enchilada recipe! I diced up the chicken before cooking and didn't worry about shredding it later. I also left out the chicken broth because this was plenty liquidy without it. I only covered the simmering pot for 15 mins and uncovered the rest of the time so it could reduce. (I may not cover at all next time.) I had a bit of left over chicken mixture after filling the 6 tortillas and just poured it on top with the enchilada sauce. Also, I used 10 in flour tortillas and left out the heavy cream. Yum!!

This was a hit in our house.  Served with Guacamole and chips and done.  I had to do some substitutions as well since I didn't realize I didn't have the can of stewed tomatoes.  Instead, I used.2 cans of rotel.  One with Habaneros and another with mild chili.  It added enough spice for my husband but not to much for the rest of us.  Prep time is a bit long but nothing complex and very much worth it.

OMG! This is definitely restaurant quality.  The only time consuming part of this recipe is cooking the tomato mixture down to thicken.  I cooked everything one day, allowed to season overnight and then put together & served the next day.  Heated four shells between damp paper towels for 30 sec. and made my own enchilada sauce from this website.  I love trying new recipes as good as this one.
Marinaded chicken in Lawry's Santa Fe Chili w/lime and garlic marinade.

Made it as close to recipe as I could. Marinaded chicken in lime juice and pico de gallo.   I would definitely make it again.  
Family comments:  very delicious and was like what you would order in restaurant.  
Was a winner for son's birthday dinner :)

We really liked these enchiladas. Followed recipe but mixed in 2 oz.  cream cheese with the chicken. Time consuming but will make again.

I made a few adjustments to the recipe since I live in Canada and had to convert ounces to millilitres.  I could not find diced tomatoes with green chili's so I used diced tomatoes with chili seasonings in them, and then purchased a can of chopped green chilies.  I wasn't sure how spicy this was going to be so I opted not to add the chili peppers to it.  It turned out awesome, my husband and I really enjoyed it and I will definitely make it again.  I also used regular tortillas as I could not find corn tortillas.  I recommend this recipe.

Did not make any changes, considered using monteray and jack cheese but used cheddar.  My family loved it will definitely make it again. I think soaking the tortillas in cream are a real great thing.

Very good flavor. I did not put the 12 chili peppers, instead I chopped up a jalapeno. This recipe makes a lot of sauce so I recommend making this in a larger than 9x11 pan.

Finally, a good home made chicken enchilada! The taste is at least five stars, we loved it. The prep could be easier. Brown the marinated chicken with the onions and peppers. etc. simmer a bit. Remove from heat, cool, then mix up the tomatoes, soup, chicken stock. Add the onions and peppers and simmer that for a bit. Shred the chicken, add some of the sauce as the recipe states. Proceed as directed. Rinse your skillet, add a small amount of cream (don't skip this step, it really adds to the overall taste). Then again proceed as directed. Just made it the same  it a little easier. Less mess. Even if you follow the directions exactly, this recipe is worth it!

To me, recipes are mostly guides to cooking creativity and this one was perfectly for that. So, it was changed to suit the ingredients on hand and my personal preferences, using dried New Mexico chili powder, 2 cans cream of chicken soup, the diced tomatoes, broth, sour cream, etc. for the sauce.
I cut the chicken in strips and stir-fried it until brown, seasoned, then pounded to shred. Mixed some sauce with chicken to moisten. Softened tortillas in oil, filled with chicken and some Queso Fresca, top with sauce, onions and cheddar. Bake according to instructions. Thanks for the recipe!

While the chicken mixture had a wonderful flavor, I would not make this recipe again.  Two issues - the amount of chicken filling is much too large for six 6" corn tortillas and the tortillas are very easy to tear during assembly.

I used flour tortillas and skipped the heavy cream. Also added chopped black olives to the enchilada filling and slices of it atop. Served this with black beans and rice and company raved! Will definitely make again. This recipe made 10 small enchiladas with stuffing left over. I will use larger tortillas next time I make it.

I thought the recipe was EXCELLENT!  Lots of prep but well, well worth it...everyone loved this dish.  I just need to ask a question....I ended up with a LOT more sauce than 2 1/4 cups.  Did I not let it simmer long enough to reduce?

Honestly, I tried a bite of the chicken before I shredded it and I was a little suspicious of the fact that it seemed a little bland. But holy taste buds batman, when I pulled them out of the oven and we ate, I was seriously blown away at the taste. These are perfect. I added some medium spice corn salsa to our plates, and some hot peppers from rthe garden to the broth mix. So good. So good that this is the only enchilada recipe I will ever make again. Give it a try and follow the recipe the first time. I promise you won't be disappointed.

These were really great, but I thought it took way too long, and there were just too many steps to make. I have used another recipe from this site that is quicker and just as good. For those who love to cook this is perfect. I am a good cook, but tend to stick to as few ingredients as possible. I rated this a 5 though, because it IS good. Thank you.

Love this recipe and use it as my "base" when trying different tastes.  No matter what I am trying, Gerry's recipe is still 'home'.   Wonderful!   Best mod I've tried is marinading chicken in Tobasco Chipotle sauce and grilling the chicken.  Thanks, Gerry!!   Mmmmm!!!

I have made this recipe for about six families in varying spiciness by adjusting the type and amount of peppers I use. A great marinade is just simply any salsa you have laying around. And I have discontinued the use of the chicken broth due to the fact that it takes a little long to reduce. But, if you like it thinner chicken broth will do the job. This recipe works with flank steak, pork and also lamb.

The sauce for this enchilada dish was amazing!  The only thing I left out was the chicken broth only because my husband has to limit his salt. I didn't even marinade the chicken first.  Will definately make this again!

Do not use previously frozen corn tortillas as they will fall apart (my mistake).  This is a great recipe.  You don't necessarily need to "marinate" the chicken, just add the spices you like.   And don't be confused where it says fry the chicken 'til brown then tells you to boil it until juices are clear.  All he wants is for you to just make sure the chicken is not raw....

I loved this enchilada recipe.  We had a few friends over for dinner and all of them said they were the best enchiladas they have ever had!  I used Lawry's Baja Chipotle marinade with chicken breasts in a slow cooker and then shredded the chicken.  This was fast and made the chicken very tender and easy to portion into each tortilla.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and I will absolutely be making them again!

Very good. Finally an enchilada recipe with corn rather than flour tortillas. The only change I made was I didn't saute the onions, rather quickly blanched them where they have a little crunch.

Excellent and easy. I omitted the green onions and chicken broth and used two chicken breasted marinated in 1/2 packet of taco seasoning for 10 minutes. Next time may add sour cream to sauce mixture.

I think I could make this every night and my husband would be the happiest husband in the world!  I love this!  Sometimes I use flour tortillas, depending on what I have at home and I love olives, so I add sliced olives on top before I bake it.

A delicious recipe!One thing I would add is to lightly warm the corn tortillas in a little bit of oil before dipping them...otherwise they will indeed fall apart!

I made this with the leftover "Slow Cooker Turkey Breast" from the AR website.  I shredded the turkey breast and proceeded with the recipe. I did not follow this recipe to an absolute T.  I used far less chiles because I was making these for my Mom and she doesn't like chiles.  She also doesn't like corn tortillas so I used floured ones.  I warmed the tortillas in the microwave so I could avoid dipping them in the heavy cream.  Turned out delicious. I had to add a can of black beans (drained and rinsed) and a can of corn(drained and rinse) to the mixture because I needed to make alot of these and I didn't have enough turkey.  Thanks for sharing.

Just made these for a Cinco de Mayo dinner and they were FANTASTIC!!  They are just as good...if not better than any Mexican Restaurant I have ever been to.  Even my husband (who does NOT like Mexican food) cleaned his plate! Thank You Gerry for sharing this outstanding and delicious recipe with us!!

I don't know what I did wrong....but when I dipped the corn tortillas in the cream they tore when rolling them up....what a mess.  Had to go get flour tortillas and start over. Will never make again.

The Best Chicken Enchilada recipe I have tried yet! The only changes I made were that I used canned green chilis instead of hotter chilis because I can't handle the heat. And I used two cans of diced tomatoes and chilis and a small can of tomato sauce because I didn't have any stewed. My family loved loved loved the taste and requested that I write a review. So Thank you Gerry they were fantastic! Do yourself a favor and make this recipe.

This is a great recipe. I had it done in no time because I prepared the sauce, and took cooked chicken (I had leftovers from a chicken I roasted for soup the other night), seasoned with chili powder and cumin, and added it once the sauce had simmered a while. Also, I just used plain tomatoes and one can of diced chiles (not big on heat in this household). Once the chicken heated through, I made the enchiladas. I really liked this recipe, and thought dipping the tortillas in the cream was a nice touch. It was a snap to prepare this way.

Brilliant! Gerry I could kiss you! Every one that has tried them loves them! I have made these 3 times in the past 30 days. The best advice I could give any one who is thinking about trying this recipe would be, go for it! I used half a 4.5 oz can of chopped green chiles because I couldn't find them fresh and the flavor was amazing! It was spicy but not too spicy, I can only describe it as flavorful spicy. I made it once with jalapeño rings and used one measly little ring made  it to spicy and ruined the flavor. I preferred corn tortillas. Better texture.

I made some slight changes to this recipe mainly because I did not have all of the items and did not feel those items were necessary, but I still gave it 5 stars because it was the best chicken enchiladas I have ever tasted. I did not use the heavy cream to soften the tortilla, I used the skillet mixtrue instead. Also, I made twice as much of the sauce (using same amount of chicken) and took 1 cup of the sauce to add to 2 cups of rice that was quickly sauted with 1 chopped onion, added 1 cup of water and cooked in the rice cooker to make the best spanish rice ever. 2 dishes in one. My husband and 9 year old loved the enchiladas and the spanish rice as well as my co-workers. This recipe is definitely a keeper. Thanks!

Perfect!  My husband and I both thought these tasted just as good as those at our favorite mexican restaurant.  Instead of dipping the tortillas in heavy cream, I used the sauce the chicken was cooked in.  Tasted great and I needed one less ingredient and pot.  I also used canned green chiles (mild) because I had some to get rid of.  They added a great flavor.  This one will be a staple on my menu.  Thanks for sharing it.

This recipe is fantastic!  I think these are better then the enchiladas we get out at restaurants.  I make only two changes to the recipe.  I marinate the chicken in fajita mix before cooking & I do not use the cream on the tortilla wraps.  I don't miss the flavor & who needs the extra fat?!

My fiance and I absolutely loved this recipe. This is a very easy recipe to modify, add extras to and have some fun with. The only thing I want to do different next time is find a less messy way to soften and stuff the tortillas.

I'm rating this 5 stars even though I changed it up a bit.  I'm sure the original way would be delicious, but I was short on time and a few of the ingredients.  I boiled a whole chicken.  While it was cooking, I simmered the sauteed onions, tomatoes, etc.  After the chicken was done, I shredded the white meat and added to the simmered tomato mixture.  It had a wonderful flavor even though it had not marinated beforehand.  I also used flour tortillas instead of corn.  My family LOVED this!!

I give it 4 and a half. It was really really long, but I was determined to make it! It turned out good, and I took everyone else's advice on this recipe about the liquids. The only thing was I couldn't find corn tortillas at the grocery store, I've looked many times, am I missing something? Well even with the flour ones, it was good, I just wish I had the corn instead.

This was a great recipe to change, and I'll have to post what it became in our house because they now get requested all the time. Thanks for giving me the idea.

We liked these a lot!  Used shredded chicken that was already in freezer, and the recipe took no time at all.

Everyone who tried these loved them. Yes it was a bit time consuming but worth it. The only changes I made was to add a minced jalapeno and a can of diced green chilis instead of 12 green chilis. It had plenty of heat as I left half the seeds from the jalapeno to cook with the sauce.  I also pureed the tomatoes in the food processor which helped thicken the sauce faster. I skipped the heavy cream and the enchilada sauce because the sauce was perfect without it. I also used colby jack cheese. They were outstanding.  The chicken was moist and delicious. I marinated in lawrys Tequilla lime marinade. I served with a sweet corn cake, like they serve in a lot of Mexican Chain restaurants. I will definitely make these again.

Wow!  This recipe is great!!  I agree that it is very time consuming but I think if I follow others' advice on the liquids it will lessen the time. This is definitely my boyfriend's fave meal I make him! We end up eating it for 3 days but it never gets boring! Thanks so much, Gerry!

I agree that these are time consuming to prepare, but WOW are they worth it! Absolutely delicious. My mom said it was the best enchilada she'd ever eaten. I boiled the chicken in garlic, onion, water and chicken bullion (from the recipe "Poblano Chile Enchiladas a la Gringa"), then let it simmer for 40 minutes. After it cooled, I shredded the chicken and  added it to Gerry's sauce. Maybe it was  because the chicken was already cooked and shredded, but it only took a few minutes for the sauce to thicken and reduce. I substituted one cup of broth from my boiled chicken for the regular broth in the recipe, and did not use a full 14.5 ounces. YUM! I want to eat more right now. Thanks for the great recipe!

I have made a variety of enchiladas.  This one was so-so. It was relatively bland vs. using fresh ingredients.  It was eaten not to waste but not a receipe, I would make again.

I must have done done soemthing wrong becasue my sauce didn't thicken at all and ended up making the whole dish a bit soggy. For me it was too much work for what turned out to be just OK. I will look for somethign easier that's not so watery.

This is a great base for a recipe.  It is very time consuming, however.  It is definitely a weekend meal.  I would recommend marinating the chicken in some sort of fajita marinade before cooking.  You definitely have to cut way down on the liquid - mine were pretty soupy.  Other than that, great recipe.  This was the first time I have ever made this for my family.  Kids loved them.  You can definitely tailor the recipe to suit your family's likes and dislikes.

These were fantastic!  I'm not normally a huge fan of enchiladas, but my family likes them so I thought I'd give it a try.  I marinated the chicken in a can of chipolte in adobo which gave the whole thing a smoky flavor and a nice heat.  Loved them!

These where really good. Time consuming but easy & well worth the effort. I opted not to add the sm. chili peppers...with the enchilada sauce I thought it was hot enough. I made half with corn tortilla & half with four tortilla (my kids only like flour). I thought the corn was much better...but, kids still loved the flour. I used the Red Enchilada Sauce recipe from this site. Topped with a dollop of sour cream and cilantro. This is a keeper!

These enchiladas were fabulous! The only change I made was to use diced tomatoes with chipotle instead of the diced tomatoes with green chilies. Thanks again for a great recipe, this will be a regular in our house!

I loved this recipe....its true it was time consuming, it took me about three hours to from start to finish, but in the end it was worth it.  My family loved it and even my little brother, all he eats is chicken fried steak, so for him to comment on the chicken enchiladas was great.  I will definitely make it again!! thanks a lot!

I wanted to give these 5 stars but couldn't. I wanted to really like these but didn't. We're a big cheese enchilada family but I thought I would make these for something different. They were a lot of work and just tasted ok. Probably won't make these again.

Wowweee!!!! Scrumptious!!! Thank you Gerry! I was so pleased that I made something so delicious. My daughter wanted chicken enchiladas for her birthday dinner. I am so glad I used this recipe. I ended up with way more than 6 servings and had way too much juice but still fantastic. I made both corn and flour tortillas and personally felt the corn was way better. This recipe is defenitely worth the time. Better then the restaraunt!!!

My husband and I really enjoyed this dish, although it did take a while to prepare. I made a few modifications - marinated chicken in lime juice and minced garlic, added only 3/4 an onion at step 3, used canned chili peppers, and less chicken broth (maybe about 3/4 the can) as suggested by other reviewers. I also didn't have the patience or time to wait for the sauce to completely reduce - I'm not sure how that changed the recipe, but it tasted great to us! Finally, I used flour tortillas instead of corn, and omitted the heavy cream. Tasted great - thanks!!

These Enchiladas are wonderful. I have made them at last 3 time now and everyone in my house loves them. My husband is very, very picky and he loves it when I say we having enchiladas for dinner. I don't think I will every try another recipe besides this one, we love it so much.

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!  I don't know what it is - I guess the "complexity" of the ingredients together, but this is fantastic!  I marinated the chicken in Lowry's bottled Baja Chipotle marinade, and it was great, too.  Definitely a recipe to be repeated over and over.

MY husband's favorite.  I use a can of chipotle chilies with adobo sauce to marinate the chicken.  It definitely spices the dish up quite a bit.

Very good recipe. I cooked the meat with the sauce ingr. in a slow cooker instead of on the stove. Was so good and family loved it even my husband who doesn't like recipes with cream of something soup in it!

This definitely isn't a last minute recipe, but it is sooooo yummy!!! Fills the house with a great smell. I've made it for company and there was none left. The leftovers are great - if there are any! It's the only chicken enchilada recipe I'll make from now on.

A little time consuming, but totally worth it in the end. This dish had the perfect blend of spice and flavor. 
The quantity that this recipe makes is a little off. I was able to make approximately 10 enchiladas. No problem...they make great leftovers

My husaband and I really loved this.  A litte spicy hot for my three and one year old.  I only used two large chicken breasts, which gave me plenty of meat filling. I skipped the step about dipping the tortillas in heavy cream and it came out perfect.  Would certainly recommend this recipe.

Great recipe!  It isn't exactly what I was hoping for, that is why I gave it a 4 star rating.  I made it exactly like the recipe except that I didn't use the optional chilis.

There really isn't anything wrong with the taste of this recipe - it is very good. My husband and I just found it to be more time consuming than we would have liked. There are other enchilada recipes we have tried that we like just as well - yet take less time. We've got two small kids and every night is a mad rush to get dinner on the table!

I have been making this recipe for a few years and everyone loves it. My sister lives in Texas and sometimes calls just to mention the enchiladas and tell me she is thinking about them. Yes, if you want to make them they are a little time consuming but it is the perfect recipe to make while talking to family and friends. I always use a little more cheese and flour tortillas. Sometimes I add cilantro in addition to the green onions...but this recipe is fabulous as is. Thanks Gerry for these killer enchiladas!

Very tasty.  I only used 3 chicken breasts, and ended up with 14 enchiladas!!!  I added cilantro, jalapenos, and garlic.  I also only used half a can of chicken broth as suggested by others.  I marinated my chicken in Lawry's Havana Garlic and Lime 30 minute marinade.  It's a keeper!!!

Yum, yum, yum, yum, YUM!!!  This recipe is excellent and is always a hit with my family.  I leave out the heavy cream and warm the tortillas in the microwave.  Sometimes they still break while filling, but that's okay, it tastes the same and without the extra calories.  Thanks so much!!

AWSOME!  This meal is fantastic. My mother is going for a bypass next month and this was the one must have before surgery. It's a mess to clean and it takes a lot of work, but it's so worth it!

These were SO GREAT! In our house they are known as "tcbg" enchiladas, meaning time consuming but GOOD! The only changes I made were to add 1/2 the amount of chicken broth, 1/2 can of chopped green chiles, and I used Lawry's Baja Chipotle w/ lime marinade for the chicken. I ended up with 5 good-sized enchiladas in a 9 x 13 pan. I served ours with a Santa Fe rice mix that you just pop in the microwave and some refried beans. Our plates looked like something you'd get in a good Mexican restaurant and actually tasted MUCH better. Definitely a keeper recipe and I can't wait to have it again even though we just had them last night.

This is a wonderful recipe - the enchiladas taste like they came from a fine restaurant.  The only drawback is that this recipe is quite time consuming.  I have cut a few steps here and there to save time, but then the enchiladas do not taste quite as good.

YUMM! I have been looking forward to this recipe ever since I found it.  Finally got around to making it yesterday.  I didn't think it took all that long to make as some other reviewers commented, I expect to spend time on a home-cooked meal.  I did think it was just a tad spicy for the kids' tastes though.  What marinades has everyone been using?  I used McCormick's southwest, this could have added to the spiciness? I did not add chile peppers as we don't like them and used diced tomatoes instead of stewed.  I did use all of the broth and didn't have any trouble with it being too soupy or really taking that long to cook down.  I did puree the sauce to get rid of tomato chunks but I think next time I will leave as it.  I made some with flour and corn tortillas and the flour ones went over a lot better, the corn tortillas turned to mush-YUCK!  Thanks for our new favorite recipe. My husband said this one is a keeper, that is a huge compliment from him!

These enchiladas tasted so good. I have been looking for the perfect recipe for enchiladas and this is it! The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it takes alot of time to make these. The simmering sauce took the longest. Next time if I make these I will start in the morning. It took me about a day total to make these.

wow! these were the BEST enchiladas i've EVER tried before!!! it did take a long time to make but it was well worth it. what i'll do next time is instead of putting the tortillas in cream to soften them up, i'll put 3 at a time in the microwave for 15 seconds. that's how i do it when i make cheese enchiladas. thanks again 4 the recipe!!!

I loved these!  I didn't have all of the ingredients so I changed a few things.  I used olive oil instead of veggie oil, used 2 cans of diced tomatoes (and didn't use the stewwed tomatoes), added 1 can of green chiles, didn't use the fresh chile peppers, cut the broth in 1/2, didn't use green onions, used milk instead of cream, and used flour instead of corn tortillas.  So I did a LOT of things different and they still tasted great.  So if you have all of the ingredients or not they will taste GREAT.

This took me close to 3 hours to make, including the simmering and the half hour it took to shred all the meat. (i'm new to cooking) But it was well worth it. My family loved it. I switched it to flour tortillas and made 6 HUGE enchiladas then ran off to class. When I got back there was only one left for me.  This recipe is a keeper.

Great!!!  Here is what I did differently.  I used diced green chiles instead of hot peppers for a milder flavor.  I didn't bother to marinate the chicken and I really don't think it needs it.  Instead I seasoned it while it was cooking with the onions using some chili powder, garlic powder and cumin.  After I removed the chicken to a bowl, I placed the cooking sauce in a blender and processed it till smooth.  I used flour tortillas and softened them a bit first in the microwave then dipped them in lowfat evaporated milk instead of heavy cream.  I used a combination of the pureed cooking sauce and some enchilada sauce I prepared from a packet (McCormick) both underneath and to top the enchiladas.  I baked covered with foil for about 25 minutes then uncovered, topped with green onions, sliced olives, and shredded cheese and baked another 5-10 minutes till bubbly and melted.  They were fantastic.  I got 10 enchiladas.

This takes forever to make!  However, it tasted great.  I should have read through the reviews because a couple of hints would have helped. Reduce the amount of chicken broth otherwise you'll be wating an hour or two for the mixture to boild down.  Also, soak the tortillas in cream for several minutes otherwise you'll be breaking them when folding.  My husband and I both thought they were wonderful.  Next time I'll make a double batch and freeze the left overs to save some time.

This recipe is GREAT!  It IS a lot of work but these are enchiladas.  If you don't have the time, make a caserole instead.  I used thighs instead of breasts, cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken, cause that's all I had.  And I did not use any broth.  I had the feeling it would be way too much liquid and I was right.  In that case, I did not drain the meat before I added the rest of the ingrediants.  They were SUPER.  We ate LATE that night but now I know...sour cream would've have topped it off real good too.

This recipe didn't turn out right for me, but it was still very good.  It might be my own fault it didn't turn out because I tried to triple the recipe due to big eaters in the house, and wanting leftovers.  I first used Marinade For Chicken by Jill off of this site overnight.  I then pressure cooked the chicken which shredded perfectly right out of the pot.  I forgot to use the chopped onions, but didn't even miss them. I then cooked all the sauce ingredients together.  I tried forever to get the sauce to reduce with no success.  So, I used cornstarch to thicken the sauce up a little, but not alot because I was afraid of putting to much in.  I ended up having about 6 cups of sauce leftover which I froze for later use.  Now, I couldn't get the tortillas to soften up in the heated cream.  So, I microwaved them then I dipped them, and this worked.  I ended up having alot of cream leftover.  I also had about 6 cups of chicken mixture leftover which I also froze.  I also added olives on top.  When done I thought it was so good I licked my plate as did everyone else except my boyfriend.  He used to be married to a Mexican woman so he ate authentic all the time.  He said it was good, but not like the real thing.  Oh well.  I think I'll be making alot more of this recipe.  I'll just freeze the leftovers for later use.  Yummy!

This recipe is excellent and my family really enjoyed it. I would make it again in a heartbeat, and wouldn't hesitate to serve it to company. I used McCormick's Grill Mates Southwest Marinade for the chicken and added a can of diced green chilles. Outstanding!

My family liked the enchiladas, but I think it was too time consuming.  Only try if you have a lot of time.  The sauce that the chicken cooks down in is great.

Thanks for a wonderful recipe, Gerry. I am always looking for ways to economize, so I used chicken thighs (saved over $2) and boiled them for the broth so that I didn't need to purchase chicken broth. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly, and they came out just wonderful. I did not add the chile peppers, and for me the "heat" was just right, but I like mild. My family loved this dish.

I've never made enchiladas before but I do love a good mexican dish.  This was fantastic.  I doubled the recipe for 10 people and we did have a few left overs but everyone raved.  I cooked the chicken and the sauce in my crock pot for 6 hours then simmered it to reduce.  Reduction didn't take as long as I suspected (considering comments made in other reviews).

These were wonderful.  My fiancee doesn't like corn tortillas, so I tried this recipe.  I added black beans and corn.  I also used green chile enchilada sauce instead.

This put a stop to my chicken enchilada craving!!  I cooked the chicken in the crockpot with water and taco seasoning overnight. Used the broth from the crockpot instead of the canned chicken broth.  Also omitted the heavy cream, but used fat free sour cream and cream cheese in its place.  Instead of the canned Enchilada sauce, made my own from a recipe found here, Red Enchilada sauce by Sara.  Excellent recipes! Will make again!!!

These are the very best enchiladas!  I loved your recipe.  I did however skip the cream and all the folding.  I also added a tiny can of chopped red jalapenos and layered everything!  Huge hit.  Add some Sangria and you have a party!  Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

Gerry, I just wanted to say thanks so much!  I was looking for a good chicken enchilada recipe and yours is the first one I tried.  I'm serving these tomorrow for Sunday Dinner, to a big group.  Today, Saturday, I cooked everything up in my Crock Pot.  My whole house smelled wonderful by mid-afternoon!  It was like walking into a good Mexican Restaurant!  Once the chicken and other ingredients had simmered all day, I pulled the chicken out and shredded it.  I reduced the sauce on the stove, reserved what I will need to add to the chicken tomorrow, and pureed the rest in the blender (my family doesn't like "chunks" in their food).  The pureed sauce came out so delicious that I'm going to use it as the Enchilada Sauce.  This recipe is time consuming, but I can already tell it's going to be fantastic!  I'll write a full review after my dinner guests leave... but I just couldn't wait to tell you thanks!

Instead of wrapping tortillas, I served the chicken mixture over rice.  The family (3 kids and DH) raved.  Nice when being lazy turns out so well! :-D  LOVED the recipe both ways.

This was a great recipe and my family - even my two young kids - loved it!  I did two things different - I planned ahead and made double the recipe of my crockpot salsa chicken yesterday saving four breasts for the enchiladas I made today.  Worked out fine and saved 1/2 the prep time.  I also made eight enchiladas instead of six.  Eight fit the casserole dish better than six and made a good portion size for the kids.  Yum, yum.  This is definately a keeper!

i have no complaints on this recipe...only a few opinions.  i agree with the review of NOT using a marinade for the chicken beforehand.  i fried the chicken in a bit of vegetable oil, then shredded it for later use in the recipe.  i combined all the ingredients in the pan and let it simmer and reduce.  the only thing i did differantly was i used flour tortillas instead of corn. this ommited having to use the heavy cream, because the flour toritillas were much more pliable and easier to use than the corn ones.  this also cut down on time.  above all, follow the recipe to the T...it is perfect.  thank you so much for sharing this Gerry!

I'm never happy with enchiladas I get in restaurants, but these were PERFECT.  Great flavor.  I also simmered with the cover off and it didn't take very long to reduce at all, by the time I was done shredding the chicken it was ready.  And I microwaved flour tortillas, didn't need any cream.

This is an excellent recipe.  My only suggestion is don't use strong marinades, because they take over the flavor.  It still turns out very tasty but takes away from enchilada flavor, so I would stay with very mild marinades.

Very good. I had to play with the ingredients since I did not have all of it. It worked great and the family loved them. Have already made it twice.

Excellent, but time intensive.  Makes a good Sunday dinner.  Will definitely make again.  Depending on choice of peppers, can be very spicy!  Be careful if you're not a pepper head.

Wonderful recipe and very eay to make. I think throwing it in the slow cooker and using canned chili peppers will make the recipe much easier. Will definately make again!!

I added a little more cheese... OMG, was this good. Took me about 2 hours to finally get everything made and in the oven. But it was well worth it.

I didn't know if I would give it 4 or 5. I will give it a 5 because my husband raved about it. He is a chips and salsa kind of guy, I guess that's why he liked it so much. The directions were hard and too long to follow exactly. I took some shortcuts. Took 1 1/2 hours from start to getting it out of the oven. Did not marinade the chicken. Preheated oven only at the end, cause the sauce takes about 1 hour to cook. Boiled the chicken first for about 15 minutes in the broth/dried onion combo only , and then got it out, and shredded. That way I did not have to pick up the pieces one at a time. I used 10 6 inches tortillas instead of 6, and was able to fill up 2 8X11 pans. They were a little crunchy on the ends, but still good. Did not use heavy cream, just half and half, but that did not make a difference, the tortillas still broke when I was not careful. My husband asked me to make it again. This was my first enchilada attempt. I will try experimenting with some other recipes too, and maybe use bouillon instead of broth, that will make the sauce cook faster.

This was excellent.  Everybody in my family loved it.  As mentioned previously it does take a lot of work, but is worth it.  I doubled the recipe, so that I would have plenty of leftovers.  As a suggestion, in addition to the cheddar cheese, add some pepper jack cheese.  The combination of the two cheeses really gives it a great flavor.

Absolutely wonderful!  It wasn't that difficult to make either!  The cream for the tortillas is a wonderful idea for softening them.  It made them very pliable.  My past attempt have been extremely messy, but these turned out perfect.

YUM - I did change a few things - I didn't understand that marinating business, so I just pan fried the chicken breasts a few minutes on each side, added 2 cans of Rotel and 2 C chicken broth and simmered 30 minutes, removed the chicken and added the soup and cooked down.  I pureed that mixture with the enchilada sauce to make a sauce for the bottom of the dish as well as the top.  My 9 year-old daughter (who loves enchilada's anyway) thought these were the BEST - if a bit spicey   - Thanks Gerry!!!

This recipe is a time-consuming but not difficult to make and the results were definitely worth the time it took to make.  I think the half pint of cream is excessive and used much less.  I used one good-sized jalapeno in place of the 12 small chile peppers and added a small tin of green chiles because I couldn't find diced tomatoes with geen chiles.  Great dinner and really great leftovers!

It seems like there are so many variations on enchiladas...but this one is pretty darn good. I didn't alter anything except omit the extra can of stewed tomatoes. I also just cut the chicken into chunks and didn't shred it (it seemed an unnecessary step). I served it will yellow rice and everyone had good reviews.

I LOVED this. The only thing I changed was instead of 12 chili's, I bought one of those tiny cans of green chili's. (I also blended all the tomato stuff in a blender since my family won't eat chunks!)  But my son and I loved it.. great flavor. He added tortilla chips to his. Thanks!

I made it for my husband coz he loves spicy foods.  He described it as intense and extremely delicious!  I don't like eating spicy things but this one was real good.  I used a powdered fajita seasoning and marinated the chicken for 2 days.  I also did not need the heavy cream to dip the tortillas in...I just microwaved them and they were fine =)..Thank so much for posting this!

Absolutely LOVED this recipe!  Even my 12-year old son who loves tacos (with beef only)LOL devoured these!  They definitely are time consuming, but worth it!  I marinated my raw chicken in a package of Old El Paso chili seasoning which I mixed with 1/2 cup of water.  I put it all in a ziplock bag and refrigerated for a few hours.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I added an additional can of diced tomatoes.  I highly recommend this recipe.

I have definitely found my new enchilada recipe. I used chicken breasts that I had in the freezer that were already marinated, then thawed them in the fridge for about two days. The chicken breasts I used were also very thin, perhaps this made a difference because I didn’t spend as long making this dish as other reviewers did. (I started at around 2:30 pm and had this out of the oven around 5:00.) I was able to fully cook the breasts in the oil in very little time without slicing them. I let them simmer in the sauce for about 10 minutes, then sliced them, and since it had marinated so long (7 days in the freezer, 2 days in the fridge) the meat fell right apart. My husband and I can’t eat overly spicy foods, so I didn’t add the chile peppers. I simmered the sauce over medium heat the whole time, then reduced it to 2-1/2 cups and added 1/2 cup of sauce to the chicken, and just added the cheese to the mixture rather than sprinkle it over each tortilla. Also, I was able to make 8 enchiladas from this. Next time I think I may reduce the amount of cream since 1 pint seemed a bit much, or just mix it with the canned enchilada sauce for a creamier taste. While it was in the oven I was able to throw together some Spanish rice and refried beans and it gave us a VERY nice dinner. We all loved these enchiladas, and my husband couldn’t stop eating them even after he was full! Thanks Gerry, this will definitely be going in my favorites!

I changed just a few things: I left out the stewed tomatoes, used 1/2 a can of the cream of chicken and pour enchilada sauce on the bottom of the pan instead of the mixture. It was very good and my family loved it! The spices were just right and it was great as leftovers!

You guys weren't kidding -- this recipe takes forever! I started prep for it at around 1:00 in the afternoon and didn't finish until 5:45 or so. I must admit, however, that it's definitely worth it. The enchiladas were so hearty that my boyfriend and I could only eat one each, but they were absolutely delicious. Paired with Spanish rice, this dish was the best I've made in a long time. The leftovers tasted great too.

These enchiladas are AMAZING.  While they do take a while to make, you will find: the more you make them, the less time they take.  I've made it 5+ times now and it no longer seems very arduous.

I can also usually get about 8-9 enchiladas (perhaps I don't stuff them full enough?) from each receipe.  My husband, who is not a corn tortilla or an enchilada fan absolutely loves them.  

This recipe is a keeper!

I gave it four stars for flavor and one star for time! Very long time to make this but in the end you have a wonderful enchilada dish that tastes great!
