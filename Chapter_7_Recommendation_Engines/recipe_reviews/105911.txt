I don't really have a grill so i pan fried it.  a lot of juices came out so it basically just cooked in its juices which made it REALLY tender and tasty.  Overall the recipe was very simple and easy.  i'm not sure if its exactly thai food and stuff but it was very enjoyable.  :D  

oh and i didn't use canola oil, just vegetable.  and i only used 2 chicken breasts.  :)

In my opinion, most marinades need longer than 20-30 minutes to really yield a deep flavor.  This surprised me! It was delicious with only 30 mins time.  I also added lime juice and some extra "Schezuan Seasoning".  I would not call this Thai food, but the flavors were heading that direction.  It was perfect for a quick weekday meal with some "Thai Kitchen" rice and garlicky green beans.
