I pureed about 2/3-3/4 of the vegetables and then mixed everything together as the recipe called for. I added chopped up avocado before serving. Excellent!

I made this recipe with no alterations, even though I thought some of the spices sounded funny together, and it turned out wonderfully. It went well with French bread dipped in garlic olive oil.

The flavor of this is good but the somewhat chunky texture was more like a salsa than a soup. I really think a portion of this needs to be pureed. I used roma tomatoes  & I used spicy bloody mary mix instead of the tomato juice so I omitted the hot sauce. I used a lite flavored olive oil to avoid a heavy, oily feeling. I didn't have celery so I used celery salt in place of the regular salt & I used fresh parsley & basil instead of dried.I served this w/  spaghetti squash w/ butter, parmesan & bacon bits & Diana's suggestion of the french bread w/ infused oil sounded so good that I went w/ that as well. Thansk for the recipe...it was refreshing.

This was awesome!  I followed the advice of several others and put 3/4 of the mixture through a food processor before adding back the remainder of the veggies.  I also added some additional tomato juice to make it more soupy. By the following day, everything came together great.  Highly recommended.

I made this last night because I had tomatoes from my garden to use.  Considering it's cold vegetable soup, it's good.  It's very healthy and it does taste good but I think it's more of an acquired taste.  People who may not like "different" stuff might not like this.  While I'll eat it, my boyfriend said he'd rather just dip his chips in it. :)

I made this soup for a 4th of July cookoout.  Guests could not stop raving about it.  I did change a couple of ingredients.  Instead of hot sauce, I used a 1/2 of a jalapeno pepper.  And I used V8 juice instead of tomato juice.  Just a personal preference.  Thanks for a great recipe.  Will continue to look for you for more delicious recipes

I made this over the weekend both my husband and I thought it was very good.  I used V8 Spicy and V8 Original (doubled the recipe).  I will definately make it again.

Changed vinegar to red wine vinegar and increased to 1/4 cup.  Also increased the olive oil to about 1/2 cup.  The addition of the beef broth makes this so good.  I also put about 1/2 of mixture through the food processor - nice texture and good flavor.

This is fabulous! The beef stock, balsamic, cumin and Worcestershire sauce added a depth of flavor usually missing in gazpacho. Nice job! :o)

Fabulous!  I've been making this soup every summer since 2006 and I've always added corn for color contrast and it works well in the medley of all the other nutritous summer vegetables!

This was great.  Even my kids (13, 10, 5) ate it and commented "this must be at least a full serving of vegetables".

Great recipe: easy and very fresh.  I pureed the garlic in some of the liquid so it would be evenly distributed and put the rest of the soup briefly through a blender- just long enough to make it a little less chunky.  Perfect!

Excellent taste and easy to prepare.  We made this twice so far this summer to great reviews. One suggestion - if the local tomatoes are not really good, use canned diced tomatoes. They work really well.  Also, if you have home grown basil, put in a LOT, chopped fine. Tastes like summer!

This was pretty good.  I tend to like my gazpacho a bit spicier.  I followed this recipe exactly and found it a little bit bland, but still very good.

YUM! Cold soup never appealed to me, but thinking of this as a liquid salad made all the difference. Due to allergies I left out the celery, but added green bell pepper and spinach and a few more seasonings. I just whirled everything in the food processor and kept adding tomato juice until I had a more soup like consistency. I took Seansgirl's  advice and added some sliced avacado. Absolutely delicious, so healthy and very refreshing on a warm summer day. Thank you so much for a great recipe Nance!

I adore this recipe. I make a few small tweaks, though. I use canned diced tomatoes with garlic and onion instead of chopping fresh, not for the time savings, but for the texture. I also skip the food processor and serve the finely diced pieces whole. Many folks prefer the crisp version.
