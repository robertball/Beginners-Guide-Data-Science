This pie is AWESOME!! You can make it in about 10 minutes flat yet tastes like a peanut butter pie you might get in a restaurant. Because my family is vegan, I used soy milk and marshmallow "fluff" instead of the mini-marshmallows (the Wal-Mart brand of fluff doesn't contain gelatin like marshmallows do) and it still came out perfect. I also drizzled some melted peanut butter on top after the pie cooled and it looked and tasted great. Thanks for this recipe, it is now a family favorite!

This pie is outstanding! I took the advice of previous listers and increased the amount of peanut butter to 3/4 cup. The balance of chocolate to peanut butter was perfect!

I made this pie with a chocolate crust and I also used the peanut butter and added about 1/3 C of the chocolate mix to the PB and first layered that one the bottom. Then I poured the chocolate over the top of that layer.  This way the peanut butter flavor wasn't lost in all the chocolate.  It was AMAZING!!!!! It was the only pie at Thanksgiving that disappeared with absolutely no left overs.  I highly recommend this pie to all the chocolate lovers!!!!

Very easy, very quick.  Next time I would put in more peanut butter though because I could not really taste it through the chocolate.

Super Fast and Super Easy. Taste was good. I used a Heaping 1/2 cup of peanut butter (probably close to 3/4 cup) due to reviews of needing more peanut butter flavor. This worked out great. This is a very, very rich dessert, which we all liked. The texture is a little thick but we would make it again. Thanks for sharing!

I brought this to dinner at a friend's. We all loved it (too many calories for everyday!) I made my own crust, and subbed marshmallow fluff for the marshmallows ('cause it doesn't contain gelatin.) I used almost a full cup of peanut butter, and the flavor was perfect! SO good!!

This pie was easy to make but the texture was a too thick, I made it twice and both times had the same results. OK, but not my favorite.

Ohhhh my goodness....really good,  definitely take the advice of the earlier reviewer to add some of the melted chocolate mixture into the peanut butter, mix well then pour that layer into pie shell before pouring in the rest of the chocolate mixture, it really distinguishes the peanut butter flavor. Also, I increased the amount of peanut butter to 3/4 cup. Rich and decadent?? Yes!!! but worth the splurge.

My Husband and I didn't really care for this recipe.  It's edible, but not that great.  The amount of chocolate REALLY overpowers the taste of peanut butter.  It is better if you serve it with whipped cream, but still nothing I would ever make again.

If I were rating this as a chocolate pie, I would have given it five stars, because it got a lot of compliments.  However, as a chocolate peanut butter pie, I had to give it three, because you can't taste the peanut butter.  I may try it again and adjust the ingredient amounts, also I put it in a chocolate crust rather than graham cracker.  Like I said, it was tasty, just not peanut buttery.

Wow, I was really skeptical because it was cooked in the microwave and I didn't think the pudding would come out smooth.  I didn't change a thing and it was amazing!  My husband said it was a little rich.  (That's a good thing)  I drizzled chocolate syrup on the plate, and topped the slice with whipped cream, delicious.

I love this pie!  Just wanted to note that I used vanilla soymilk instead of regular milk and it came out SO good!  I also used a vegan pie crust and my family members (who are not vegetarian/vegan) couldn't tell the difference!

This pie was very thick and rich. The flavor was good and it was easy. I think it really didn't need the marshmallow. I the recipe and didn't tweak it.  I need to think about making it again. Thanks, Happy Cooking!

This recipe deserves 5 stars on so many levels!  It was super easy to make.  I had to make a dessert somewhat quickly and this fit the bill.  I let it chill for 3 hours exactly but it is definitely better the next day.  The ingredients were in my pantry so I didn't have to go out to the store for anything.  DEFINATELY increase the peanut butter to 3/4 cup.  The balance of the chocolate and peanut butter was perfect.  I used a ready made graham cracker crust.  Delicious.

I didn't like it, but my guests did.  Too chocolately for my taste.  I'd add more p.b. next time.

I'll say three and a half stars. It tastes fine but just isn't that special. Not really worth the calories! I will give it props for being super fast to prepare, though. Good for a quick fix.

I use evaporated milk for half my milk.  I have also made this using white chocolate chips, leaving out the peanut butter and using coconut instead. Big hit. Love this recipe. I keep this ingredients on hand and whip this up quickly.

I tried this recipe and I was amazed at what a fabulous pie this was and how easy it was to make. Who would ever dream that this pie took under ten minutes to prepare? I usually do not tweak recipes but after reading the comments, I cut back the chocolate to twelve ounces and upped the peanut butter to three quarters of a cup. My company gave it rave reviews. Luckily, the dessert was very rich so a small slice goes a very long way. Both the chocolate and the peanut butter were very discernable. After laboring over a large Christmas dinner it was a pleasure not to spend an inordinate amount of time on dessert. I have a feeling that this will be a dessert we will enjoy in Christmas Futures.

Where can you go wrong with Marshmallows, Chocolate and Peanut Butter? I added a 1/2 cup of crushed peanuts and my family loved it! It was even better the next day after refridgerating over night!

AMAZING. I've made this pie again and again for all kinds of events and people. Not one person has ever said to me or anyone else anything but "AMAZING". This pie is perfect for any occasion. The only correction I've made to this recipe, is to add more peanut butter-- 1 cup or more. Personally, I really like the peanut butter, chocolate taste and with just 1/2 cup the peanut butter is a bit lost in the chocolate. In addition, I add a few more marshmallows as I like to it be thicker and more fluffy. ENJOY:)))

This pie turned out perfectly! Very smooth and creamy (I microwaved the milk for 6 min). I tweaked it a little (don't we all?) and used 3/4 c PB. It was the perfect amount- don't skimp here! One tip I have would be to add the marshmallows to the milk mixture first. I added them last, and they stayed a little too firm for my liking. It would have been better if they were softened more while the milk was still very hot.
I topped mine with roasted peanuts and it gave a wonderful texture contrast!
The fam could not get enough of this one!

Excellent, I only gave 4 because I followed other suggestions and added extra PB. I also tried with almond extract and mashed cherries. This recipe is very versatile

This is THE BEST pie ever! It's SOOOO easy! I could make this every week but I'm sure my waist line wouldn't appreciate it. Top this with some cool whip and you're in chocolate peanut butter heaven!

It's ok....I increased the peanut butter to 3/4 cup as others suggested and I found it tasted too much like peanut butter and hardly like chocolate. I will try another time, leaving the ingredients as is.

The taste was good, but for some reason I had these rubbery chunks in it. I think it had to do with the milk, cornstarch etc microwaved mixture.

It was very easy to make but the texture was too thick.

I give this a 3 stars it's not the best pie I've ever had. It's so rich. My three year old dosen't like it. It tasted a little better with whiped toping. I'll try it again with less chocolate chips.
