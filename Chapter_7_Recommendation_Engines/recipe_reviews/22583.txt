Super easy! Love the chocolate/orange combination.
If you line the pan with enough parchment paper to cover the sides and bottom with a little extra to fold over the pan's edges, you can easily lift the fudge out of the pan when you're ready to cut it into squares.  I cut it with a pizza cutter which made it very easy, and the pan didn't need to be washed!!

This was good but not the best fudge I've had.  It was simple to make.  I would add extra orange peel to the recipe because I really like the taste of orange and chocolate mixed and it the orange taste wasn't that strong.

This is awesome fudge!  It tastes like a Cadbury Chocolate orange!  I added a tsp vanilla extract, a 1/2 tsp orange extract and 2 Tblsps of butter.  Delicious!

Orange chocolate flavor combination is wonderful.  It literally took me about 5 minutes to make this fudge last night, and this morning, it was set and ready to devour.  I added 1/2 teaspoon orange extract to up the orange flavor, and it was perfect.  I also skipped the pecans.  This was so easy and so good, I will for sure be making it again!

Thsi is a very easy and almost always 'goofproof' way to make fudge. I added orange extract (1 tsp) in addtion to the zest as I found the orange flavor a little weak. Orange and chocolate together are heaven! It's best the next day so make it ahead, wrap in wax paper and refrigerate.

My kids new favorite recipe- they can make it without help, and so quickly that I don't even notice they just used all the chocolate chips!  They made only half a recipe, but used the whole amount of orange zest.  It's a delicious combination of flavors.

Omigosh, this recipe is ridiculously fast and easy.  If you need a quick dessert for a work party, a bake sale, whatever, THIS is the answer!  I added a teaspoon of orange extract for more orange flavor and used very high quality chocolate chips.  I also left out the nuts.  It's creamy and delicious!

I have made this recipe dozens of times!
Always received well at any function I have taken it to including my daughter's school and to work.  My daughter loves it without the nuts or orange zest.  Most people who have tried it love the zest in it.  It is one of my 'keeper' recipes!

Both my husband and I love this recipe, in fact he requested that I make it weekly! Chocolate-orange is my favorite combination. I doubled the orange zest and the nuts (pecans) and found it to be a perfect blend - not too much orange, not too much chocolate. My husband loves it because it is not excessively sweet.

I used fresh orange zest because I did have grated orange peel, and didn't know where to get it either. It turned out very well. Very simple and tasty. It is a little stickier than traditional fudge though, so becareful.

Made some minor changes to this recipe and it is exquisite.  I added part milk chocolate chips, increased the pecans to 1 cup and orange rind from one orange which may be a little less than 2 teaspoons which sounded like a lot.  Easy and very nice!

i found the orange flavor to be a little overwhelming, kind of burned the tongue in the aftertaste.  Maybe I just got a flavorful orange or didn't do it right.

This recipe is very easy to make, and the final result is deliciously moreish. We smashed up big bars of 55% cocoa chocolate instead of chocolate chips.

Easy, easy, easy!   This is a nice twist to an old favorite.  I didn't have any oranges so I used tangerine zest.  The whole family raved over this fudge.

Great, easy fudge! I often make it when I want to bring/share a dessert at an event or with family (especially on shorter notice). As an added touch, I will often candy some orange peel to top the fudge, which seems to be a hit.

I would not make this again.   The simplicity of the recipe overshadows what you would be rewarded from  making a cooked fudge

This fudge is wonderful! I love that it is so easy.  I didn't put in the pecans, and I added a teaspoon of orange extract for more flavor. I will definitely make this fudge again.

Love the flavor from what was left in the bowl, so once the fudge sets and flavors meld, I'm sure it will be fabulous!  I added a 1/2 tsp orange extract just for a touch more orange flavor and macadamia nuts instead of the pecans.  Will definitely make this again!

The flavors are great. I used the zest from two full oranges and the chocolate and orange together are fantastic. I didn't love the consistency of this fudge. It's a little bit more sticky and chewed than I would have liked. Overall good!

first time making fudge and this was so easy. I used probably about 5 teaspoons of orange peel. And just over a 12 oz package of semi-sweet chips.

A very versatile recipe! I've made vanilla fudge with oreos mixed in, peanut butter fudge, rocky road...such a simple technique!  

When making in the microwave, I found that my batches had a tendency to burn unless I pulled them out every few seconds and stirred the mixture.

This turned out good but I expected more orange flavor.  I doubled the zest and still didn't quite get the flavor I expected.  I'm thinking to maybe add some extract next time.  It was still very good but I wanted to really taste the orange and it was lacking.
