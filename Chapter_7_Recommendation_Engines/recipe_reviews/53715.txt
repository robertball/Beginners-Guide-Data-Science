I also got a "don't bother" and several turned up noses from my family when I said I was making this dish for Thanksgiving.  Everyone loved it, including a picky sister and my even pickier two year old.  Since then we have served it at 3 dinner parties.  The people that try just a spoon to be polite always go for seconds.  We end up sending the recipe home with everyone.  Contrary to what some say, I think it is great the next day.  My advice is to cook the bacon and do the shredding ahead of time.  Then it's much easier to throw together at dinner time.  Even if you're skeptical, try it!  You won't be disappointed.

This recipe is definitely 5 stars!  Helpful Hint:  Try soaking these lovely little veggies in salt water for an hour or so prior to shredding them.  The salt water helps dispel the bitterness!  This recipe was so, very, very tasty!  Didn't change a thing and the recipe didn't need it.  Excellent!!!

Really good.  Not a fan of shredding them since it looks sloppy & overcooks easily that way, so I quartered/halved them.  Turned out to be very tasty.  I even used pre-crumbled, pre-drained bacon, so it was less greasy/fattening, but just as delicious!

This is a very good recipe, but as written, it could use a couple of adjustments. The butter content could be halved, as the dish is a little too rich/greasy. Also, I'd recommend the cooking time be reduced to about 7 minutes. The finely shredded brussel sprouts come out much nicer if there is still a little bite in them--there's no risk of mush that way. I substituted turkey bacon for regular bacon. It was a big hit at my Thanksgiving dinner. I will make this again.

Halved recipe.  Used 3 slices pre-cooked bacon, 1 tsp. butter (for flavor) & 2-3 Tbsp. olive oil (since didn't have much bacon grease).  Subbed pecans for pine nuts.  Did not core, just trimmed ends before shredding.  I like the flavor of roasted sprouts, so after cooking in a skillet, I finished cooking by roasting sprouts on a cookie sheet (400 degrees-15 min.) to give that "nutty" flavor.  Everyone really enjoyed & will be making again soon!

I didn't find this recipes time intensive at all.  I used my food processor to shred the sprouts and it worked great.  Once the bacon was cooked, it went very quickly.  Excellent recipe!!!  Rave reviews and request for recipe by all!!!!

*****If you even like brussel sprouts, you will Love this dish.  I'm so glad I decided to make this at the last minute last night to go with my full blown turkey dinner.  I doubled the recipe as another reviewer suggested for leftovers since I love brussels, and i left out pine nuts because no one but me in my family of 5 likes nuts at all and do not feel like we missed a thing.  This is awesome!!  3lbs of spouts seems like a lot at first but they do cook down and you will want some the next day.  As I am typing this, I'm having a bowl and it's only 9:25AM!!!  Yes, it's that good! oh, and use your cuisinart or whatever you have to shred them.

This is the recipe that finally got me to eat brussel sprouts AND like them. Instead of shredding (like cabbages for cole slaw), I peel and separate each leaf from the "head" (like pulling petals off from a flower) and saute until wilted and not mushy. I think it looks nicer this way. I also like to add some thin slices of garlic to the oil for extra flavor, and so those who don't care to eat the actual garlic can pick them out easily.

Very yummy! Didn't shred the sprouts, quartered instead... the bacon added a great flavor, and we loved it. Thanks for the recipe-- will definitely use again!

I've never made brussels sprouts before, but this recipe was totally easy and yummy! I did skip adding the pine nuts(as they are not my fave), and only cut the sprouts in halves. Also, I added bread crumbs to the topping of bacon. I served this dish for Thanksgiving, and EVERYONE LOVED 'em.

I found this recipe 2 weeks ago and (after not EVER making brussels sprouts in 15 yrs. of marriage) I've made them 3 times for dinner and several times for my breakfast.  My kids LOVE them and I can't get enough.  Shredding IS THE KEY..I think the brussels sprout taste that everyone hates is hidden in the compact center.  Opened, shredded & toasted and that taste is gone, replaced with nutty, sweet, salty, toasty goodness!!  I use pecans to save $$ & I love them..I also toast with just e.v. olive oil, pecans, kosher salt & pepper under the broiler (stir often) to save washing a pan & calories.  VERY high in Vit. C, low cal. (no bacon) high in protein, and a cancer fighting veggie!  LOVE this recipe!!  :o)

This was flavorful and colorful but there was way too much pine nuts – half the amount would have been more than adequate.  We found ourselves dancing around them with our fork, and that disappointed me because pine nuts aren’t cheap. I felt it was an unnecessary waste of an expensive ingredient.  I added garlic just because, and I quartered rather than shredded the Brussels sprouts because it would be a shame to shred them and totally get rid of their cuteness.  Other than my disappointment with the pine nut overkill, Hubs and I both enjoyed this.  Just be careful not to overcook these – that could change everything!

OMG!! Who would of thunk?  This recipe is totally awesome.  I believe in making a recipe exactly as written, the first time.  Afterall, it's only fair to make  a rating only when the recipe is followed. Anyway, this recipe is one of the BEST I've tried. I found myself taking forkfulls as it was cooking.  Couldn't even wait until it was finished.  In addition, I couldn't stop myself from having a little for breakfast the next day even though I planned on having it for lunch.  Yes, it's that good! I used my food processor to shred, so the consistency was perfect.  I wouldn't change a thing Can't wait to make it again .

I am always looking for new ideas and this recipe really intrigued me.  Brussel sprouts are regarded often as a vegetable of last resort, so I was looking for something different and this recipe came through with 5 stars.  Excellent taste, good presentation and just a lingering of the earthiness of the sprout.  Instead of pine nuts I added almonds (cheaper alternative).  It could use a little colour, so diced red pepper would be nice.  A very good recipe, thank you.

Awesome. My girls have always loved brussel sprouts, but this recipe is like brussel sprouts on steriods! I never have pine nuts around, so I have substituted grated carrot. To cut back on the fat, I also use olive oil in place of the bacon grease. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

I've made this three times in the last few weeks. Incredibly delicious. I've tried using only the the bacon grease, only butter, and a combo of both like the recipe states. The consensus was that the bacon grease was a must. Butter is good, too, but not absolutely necessary. Pine nuts were the best option, but they can be pretty expensive. You can skip them all together and still be ok, but you can also swap in chopped pecans or walnuts. Just something to add crunch. I didn't know how to shred the brussel sprouts (and was too lazy to figure it out), so I just quartered them.

This is the 2nd Brussels sprout recipe made in my quest to place these little gems in the spotlight where they belong. This was easy to put together and made for a hearty and attractive side dish. The pine nuts added a unique texture and hint  flavour. I received a few "not bad" nods from those who, at times grudgingly, tolerate this veg. but those haters warding the sprouts off with crossed fingers didn't get past the first bite. The consensus is that if you really don't like the flavour of this unfortunate scorned morsel, it's unlikely that you will be wooed.

Here's what I did differently.  Our family loves brussels sprouts, so it wasn't a hard transition for us.  I quartered them, cooked the bacon and drained all the grease except 1/2 tbsp and only put in about 2 pats of butter.  I halved the amount of pine nuts, added a bit of minced garlic (maybe about a tsp or so), then added the sprouts, cooked for about 8 minutes total topped with the crumbled bacon and freshly grated parm.  It was exceptional.  This is a good base recipe that you can change to your taste.

Delicious!! A more coarse shred works better than a fine shred, bacon seals the deal. I make this every Christmas. A favorite.

I didn't find it rave worthy.  It was a decent dish, but not more so than my usual roasting of the brussels sprouts with seasoning and olive oil.

I liked this recipe.  We grow brussel sprouts in our garden and I am always looking for new ideas.  I used a mandoline to grate the sprouts.  I added chestnuts instead of the pine nuts and a bag of steamed brown rice and this was a great supper!

After reading the reviews, I used less pine nuts and threw a little EVOO in.  I also threw in some red pepper flakes because I like spice, more salt (1/2 tsp is not enough for my taste buds) and used turkey bacon.  The easiest and best way to shred the brussel sprouts is to throw them in a blender on the lowest setting, about 5 at a time.  I kept eating them as I was cooking them so that must tell you how delicious they are!

I make something similar but I love the pine nuts in this and shredding the brussel sprouts adds an extra...something good. I really enjoyed this as did the family! And this will be a new favorite side dish. Thank you!

Wow- this recipe is awesome! I have made it twice now- shredded the sprouts the first time, the second time I quarted the sprouts. I much prefer the texture when they are quartered. My DH, who proclaimed he was "not a fan" of brussels sprouts loves this recipe. When the sprouts are quarted, they are just as good the next day (I just had them for lunch!)

We left out the bacon grease because we have leftover bacon and replaced the green onion with a little finely diced onion and it was fab! This was the first time my kids tried brussel sprouts and one declared hem their favorite veggie and the other said it was good.

Love this recipe. I used to be among those who hated brussels sprouts, but this recipe has made a believer out of me. Shredding the sprouts very thin with a good, sharp knife and getting the pine nuts a bit toasty made the recipe. My husband keeps asking me to make it again! Another plus is the short ingredient list of things I usually have on hand.

If you typically steam or boil Brussels sprouts, you are going to love this recipe! I usually season them and saute in a butter/olive oil mixture; and for me, I didn't feel the extra time to crisp bacon, toast pine nuts, and chop onion added a significant dimension to the flavor, compared to that method. I enjoyed trying this recipe - thank you so much for sharing it!

I was told that this recipe would make the non-brussel sprout lovers in my house love them. Didn't work.....at all, but it was very well liked by the brussel sprout lovers. Thank you!

Previously have tried brussel  sprouts twice and have hated them! Could barely swallow one.  This recipe sure changed my opinion.   I loved these and so did my husband. I will definitely being making this recipe over and over.  I made it exactly as recipe called for.  I didn't know how to shred so I used a sharp knife and sliced very thin.

What a great way to cook brussels sprouts! I made this for a family dinner, and even my brother-in-law and nephew (who are extremely picky) enjoyed it. Don't be fooled by the seemingly small amount of brussels sprouts- this recipe makes plenty! As many said, I went a little lighter on the butter, and they were still quite rich.

The shreadding is very time consuming.  I did it the first time I made them but now I usually just quarter them.  Other than that this is a fantastic recipe and we serve it quite a bit.  I also leave out the pine nuts unless I have them on hand.  I don't really think it adds a lot to the recipe if you would like to leave them out.

I made these for Christmas Eve dinner this year and they were a hit! My mom who claimed to HATE brussels sprouts had two helpings! This recipe is fantastic! I really love roasting brussels sprouts in the oven with garlic and olive oil but I'd never tried them prepared in a skillet. So easy and quick! Pairing them with the rich flavors of the bacon was amazing! Many thanks for this recipe! Its going on my "to make again" list!

Excellent change of pace. Recipe as written is excellent. Have also modified it to fit available ingredients and pretty much any type of nut is delicious (pecans are especially nice substitute for pine nuts). Reduced the amount of bacon and butter by half (to reduce calories) and flavor is still exceptional.

Nope...and I love brussel sprouts, but this just didn't make it for me. I ended up adding quite a bit of golden balsamic vinegar to try to counteract the bacon grease.

Everyone loves this!  I've tried many recipes, none of which are nearly as tasty.  Brussel Sprouts are often bitter or not very flavorful.  This recipe has fantastic texture and flavor.  I made it for a teachers appreciation luncheon and the teachers all loved it and wanted the recipe.  It's a pretty dish and I am actually making it this year for Thanksgiving in lieu of the high sodium, mushy canned green bean casserole which no one seems to be able to do without.  This, to me, seems like a fabulous alternative, much tastier AND healthier.

I have made this dish many times.  Most times I don't even add the pine nuts and it is still amazing.  Most recently I added a bit of shredded parmigiana and it was super delicious!  Love this recipe.

Very good!  I sliced frozen sprouts instead of shredding fresh and found it worked very well, but it was quite "fiddly" to prepare.  I would make it again.

I brought these to Thanksgiving dinner at my mother-in-laws and was just asked to bring them to Christmas dinner. I left out the pine nuts and cut the brussel spouts in half instead of shredding them. Delicious!!!

Wowzer- who knew Brussels Sprouts could be so good! I have big plans for playing with this recipe. I did cut oil WAY back. Hubby thinks it would make great egg rolls. I'm also going to try adding a little heavy cream and serving it over pasta with grilled chicken. Delicious!

These were delicious and a huge hit!  We quartered the sprouts instead of shredding them.  Just cooked them a little longer.  We used 7 slices of Boars Head pre-cooked bacon, but crisped it in the pan quickly so we still had a little bacon fat.  Make sure you use fresh brussel sprouts.

Woohoo, finally a recipe that convinced me that Brussels Sprouts aren't evil! The Pine Nuts were worth the cost, but I might also try a different nut next time, based upon requests from my family.   I didn't shred, I quartered. If you haven't enjoyed Brussels Sprouts in the past, but are ready to give them another try - check this recipe out!

Wow, I would have been buying Brussels sprouts all along if I had this recipe. It's been years since I had any because I didn't think I liked them... I was wrong, I love them. I added mushrooms and wouldn't change a thing.

These were awesome.  I added some water chestnuts which I halved.  I also cut my brussel sprouts in half instead of shredding them.  Great recipe!  I substituted almonds one time when I didn't have pine nuts...this was great, too.

Didnt have a few of the ingredients. So I opted to cut the sprouts in half, add the oil, onions, salt, pepper, garlic powder, Lawsons seasoning salt, and some pre-cooked bacon i had. Put everything in a sealable bag. Then tossed on a baking pan for about 30-35 minutes. Until they were dark as recommended.
This was very delicious. Definitly will try again with the exact recipe next time.

Absolutely delish, the only thing on the Thanksgiving table that had no leftovers.  I quartered the brussel sprouts as others suggested, added about 1-2 tbs. balsamic vinegar while cooking on the stovetop and then finished off in the oven for about 10 minutes for a wonderful nutty flavor.  This will be our go-to holiday recipe.

This dish  got RAVE reviews from all who came toThanksgiving dinner. Everyone thought is was such a great idea and loved the flavours and that they were shredded! Brussels sprouts are a staple at such occasions so when I saw this recipe I knew everyone would love them (even those who usually don't)!. This recipe made plenty for the 8 that we had could easily been good for 12 with other the food that goes with a turkey dinner.  Have left over brussels this time is a treat. Doing the sprouts in a food processor is a must though the shredded consistency was great and so quick. Thank you for this one! :)

Went looking for a new way to prepare brussels sprout...So glad I did! I did sub pecans for the pine nuts, as that was all I had and used a jar of real bacon bits as a time saver. Both worked out great. When I warmed the leftovers I threw in a handful of golden raisins...so yummy! For those who find brussels sprouts too bitter, try a light sprinkle of red wine vinegar added just before they're done cooking. Thanks for a new easy family favorite!!

YUM! My family will not usually eat Brussel Sprouts. My kids at least ate these and my husband had seconds! They were very good.

Just made these for myself b/c no one else likes them and they are FANTASTIC! This was a last minute decision, so I used a bag of 'steamfresh' brussel sprouts, cooked them according to the pkg. and then just quartered them and proceeded w/ the recipe. This is seriously one of the best ways I have ever made/eaten brussel sprouts...a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

My dad and I finished off a pound of sprouts like they were going out of style. So good. Be careful that you don't let the pine nuts get too dark before adding your sprouts, I did, and they were almost burnt when I was done. I also didn't shred my sprouts, but cut them in half, and then each half into 4 wedges. 
Made these again, and sub'd 1 yellow onion for the green onions. I added it to the pan with the pine nuts, about 1 minute before adding the sprouts. The green onions got lost in the sprouts the first time, the yellow onion added a little bit of sweetness that I think the dish greatly benefited from.

I used Chicken Itallian Sausage instead of bacon. I used my food processor's thinnest slicing blad to shred the brussel sprouts. This was delicious!

Well, it's definitely not lowfat, but this was an excellent holiday side dish.  I just sliced up the brussels sprouts two days before to save time, and sliced the bacon in little pieces and just cooked until i felt I had enough bacon fat.  Put the chopped bacon on a couple of paper towels and cooked for a few more minutes in the microwave to crisp.  I also didn't really measure how long the brussels sprouts cooked, but I know I didn't cook them more than 10 minutes ... nice flavorful and good the next day warmed up.

Better than I expected.  Give these a shot and you will be glad you did.  I trimmed the ends slightly and just cut them in half lengthwise.  Cook the bacon, then add Brussels Sprouts.  Yum!

I did not care for this dish.  I did make some changes as other reviewers had suggested - cut down the butter, quartered the sprouts vs. shredding and I used slivered almonds vs. pine nuts.  I don't think these alterations made a significant difference in taste though.  The recipe is just okay.  Nothing to rave about.  I will  never make it again.

Unbelievably delicious and the colors of this dish while cooking are vibrant.  I used Canadian Bacon and it worked as well, although didn't provide the fat, so butter worked.  I sliced the sprouts thinly and loved the added flavor of the pine nuts as well!

Yum!  I'm just sampling from the pot as they are cooking, and I can already tell that they're fantastic!  The only change I made was to use walnuts instead of pine nuts because that's what I had on hand but left everything else the same.  

So far I've only been able to get my husband to eat brussels sprouts if they are roasted and slightly charred, so I'm anxious to see what he thinks of these.  I guess I'll know in about a half hour when he gets home. :-)

Thanks for posting!

I made this once for Christmas Eve dinner and every year it is requested. A little labor intensive (it takes forever to core and shred sprouts) but worth it in the end. I have also substituted slivered almonds for the pine nuts. You can make it ahead of time and reheat in the oven, just don't add bacon until the end and saute the sprouts for less time.

So worth the time and effort...time and effort being that I "shredded" them by hand, cutting them very thinly with a knife after halving/coring.  They tend to be a bit greasy, so be sure to drain some of the bacon fat and use less butter.  The pine nuts add SO much flavor.  Oh, and the recipe DOES freeze well, assuming they're not overcooked to begin with.

My family really liked this, but we are brussel sprouts fans anyway.  I quartered the sprouts, left out the butter and pine nuts.  (We were having nuts in another dish.)  Good and simple to make.

A little time consuming...but worth it. I used white sweet onion in stead of green and totally omitted the pine nuts since the jar I had seemed to have gone rancid. Hubby is s huge brussel sprout fan and really liked this dish. Made the day before and had no problems re-heating and eating on Turkey Day. Thanks for a yummy brussel recipe!

Oh wow!  These have made me a total brussel sprouts lover.  Even my little guy loved them.  The blend of flavors is awesome and the pine nuts just put it over the top.  The next time (and there is definitely going to be a next time) I will reduce the butter by half, because it was a little much with the bacon grease.  Overall I would give this recipe 100 stars is possible.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!!

I gave 5 stars because if I had used bacon I know it would have been out of this world. I am a vegetarian though, so I omitted the bacon. It was good for a regular dinner but no wow factor (I served for Thanksgiving).

This recipe was ok...I shreaded the brussel sprouts with food processor.  My daughter though it was cole slaw.  I don't know if I didn't do something right, but did not feel it had a ton of flavor.  I love Brussel sprouts, but  I think I will just make them as normal next time.  Too much work this way.

I take this to family gatherings around the holidays and it is always a big hit. Exspecially when the kids eat it and don't realize its brussel sprouts!

Fantastic recipe: great combo of salty/bitter/sweet flavors and crunchy, chewy textures. How could this not be good, with butter and bacon and pine nuts? I may try again sauteeing in olive oil & omitting the butter and bacon. It won't be the same, but at least we can eat it more often.

Very good. Nice flavor and texture. I don't eat bacon so I used olive oil instead. Next time I will use less pine nuts. Overall, I would make again.

The brussels sprouts are AWESOME!  I didn't have time to shred the brussels so I just quartered them.  I substituted slivered almonds for the pine nuts.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I had to use frozen baby brussels sprouts (the frest just didn't look good!). I defrosted them a little and then processed them whole in the food processor. I can't eat onions, so I increased the seasoned salt slightly, and they were excellent. Thanks for the great recipe!

I've never eaten Brussel sprouts in my life. Couldn't stand the texture or smell. Was FB'ed this recipes and decided to be a big girl and eat my veggies. Can't get enough!!! Not a huge fan of onion, so I substituted celery, and didn't have pine nuts, so I used almond slices. Thick cut smoked bacon made it that much better. Had seconds my first go round, and made it again for lunch today. I'm hooked!

i don't like sprouts. I can count on 1 hand how many times I've eaten sprouts in the last (ahem) years, and have fingers left over. I loved these. I only made a pound, and I added garlic, but I ate them all. Every. Single. Bite. Can't wait to make again!

I made this last year as our veggie side dish for Christmas dinner. I was tired of the typical green bean casserole and wanted a dish that wasn't the same "mushy" texture as everything else on the table (stuffing, mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce, etc.). I knew it was a risk because brussel sprouts are not popular in my family, but this sounded unique. It was a HUGE hit! My now 12 and 9 year old sons have specifically requested that I make it again this year, and they have asked for it several times during this past year. The only changes I made were quartering the sprouts instead of shredding them and I used slivered almonds instead of pine nuts due to the expense. HUGE, HUGE hit with everyone!

This is probably the best brussel sprouts I have ever had and my husband even complimented the dish (which is a big deal, since he usually chokes brussel sprouts down when I make them).  I just used some bacon pieces rather than cooking my own and added a big handful of craisins too for some sweetness.  Otherwise cooked as directed.  Great recipe!  I will definitely make this one again!

Mixed reviews from last night's dinner.  My husband and mom would have preferred our traditional recipe: steamed Brussel Sprouts with salt, pepper, butter, and nutmeg.  I liked this - not sure it's worth the extra bother, though.  One guest who doesn't typically like Brussel Sprouts enjoyed these.

Easy to make, smells good.  Added 1T vinegar and 2 tsp sugar.  No pine nuts on hand.  1 sweet onion instead of green onions.  Can't wait to see how the family likes it.  :)

This has become a favorite in our home. Great texture and great color in this recipe. I have made this with pine nuts or with slivered almonds when pine nuts weren't available. This recipe also travels well to holiday dinners and potlucks, as long as you can keep it warm. However, it is so popular at our house that my daughter will eat it cold the next day from the fridge! Leftovers microwave decently, too.

Tried this tonight and it was fabulous. I just  cut each sprout into sixths, used cooked bacon I had in the freezer. Warmed the bacon first in the pan, removed added 2-3 T butter and about 10-12 sprouts cut into sixths.   I put in one green onion, 2-3 dashes of pepper and 2 dashes of season salt, 2 dashes of salt.  I didn't have pine nuts.  Still turned out great!

We've made this a few times now. I don't care for brussel sprouts but my husband loves them. I've finally found a recipe that we both LOVE with brussel sprouts! Thank you! It's a special treat for us. BTW Trader Joe's has brussel sprouts already shredded - save your knuckles ;-)

good recipe, I quartered brussels sprouts, too lazy to shred. and had no pine nuts so I used sliced almonds. Took a little longer to cook because of sprouts being larger.
Everyone like it, will make again when time allows. I usually roast me sprouts, I find it easier than standing over a pan.

Made this last year for Thanksgiving and they were a HUGE hit. My brother, who despises brussels sprouts and only took a bite because I wouldn't stop nagging him, actually LOVED them and ended up eating a huge serving. I couldn't believe how well these went over. In fact, my family requested I cook them again for our holiday meal. I made these exactly as called for in the recipe and wouldn't change a thing. Perfection!

Miraculous, this recipe actually makes Brussel Sprouts taste good. I think it is the pine nuts which do the trick. Of course, anything with butter and bacon has a fighting chance :)

Looooove this!  It's now one of my favorite side dishes ever, and I have made it several times.  I make it exactly as the recipe calls for.  I had never shredded Brussels sprouts prior to making this recipe, but the shredding is what really makes this special.  I just use a mandolin, so it's pretty easy.  Just takes a little time, but it's worth it to shred them.  The texture with the bacon and pine nuts is just perfect!  So sooo good!

Love this!  Its a great way to eat brussel sprouts!  I don't have any pine nuts on hand so I omitted those.  I also used the bacon drippings only - no butter and a bit of chicken broth so they cooked without getting crispy and remained healthier than the butter method. I also used minced onion and garlic but only because I didn't have any green onion.  I would love to try it with the green onion though!

Just tried this out for the family tonight in hopes that they would like it enough for me to bring to this years Easter dinner. It did not disappoint and it was what everyone said it would be....delicious!! My daughter's boyfriend said that his mom makes a similar dish with Pancetta instead of the bacon...sounds good too but I think the bacon grease is needed and not sure if the flavor of the Pancetta would suffice without it.
  Okay, one dish down, another one to go! I love this website!

Wonderful!!  I roast brussel sprouts all the time and love them.  Though, I think this recipe has now become my favorite way to eat brussel sprouts.  Not to mention that it is a lot faster than roasting them!

Although, I did take them off the stove after cooking for a little less than 10 minutes.

This was a HUGE hit with my family.  My kids have never shied away from vegetables, but brussel sprouts were my son's arch nemisis!  lol!  But he loved it!  And my 3yr old finished her whole plate!  This will def be a weekly thing in our house.  Especially since we started following the Paleo Diet.

I have had this dish since I was a child except instead of using Brussels sprouts, my grandmother and mother used fresh spring lettuce right out of the garden, plus fresh spring onions, green tops and all. We knew it as " Wilted Lettuce". I make it for my family still, the only difference is I don't have a garden. Thank goodness I can find the lettuce and spring onions in my local grocery store almost year round.

Excellent recipe exactly as is.  If you try cutting the butter and/or bacon grease, you WILL lose out on much of the wonderful flavor.

I made a vegetarian version of this recipe, using Morningstar Farms soy "sausage" patties in place of the bacon, and chestnuts in place of the pine nuts.  I also cut the amount of brussels sprouts in half and used an equal amount of cauliflower instead.  Absolutely scrumptious!

Shredded them in the food processor, otherwise followed exactly and PERFECT.  If you think you don't like brussels sprouts try this recipe.  You'll change your mind.

excellent!  husband who turns up nose at brussel sprouts actually went for seconds.  I've cooked similar recipes (with bacon, chicken broth, ect) but using whole sprouts...so I think having them shredded was really the ticket...flavors able to get to every piece of sprout.  I liked the pine nuts in here too.

This is fantastic for Brussels sprouts. I had some skeptical looks but they were really good. Thanks for the recipe. I did microwave the frozen sprouts for about 2 minutes before putting in the food processor & used some precooked bacon bits. Worked great!

What a cool way to make Brussels Sprouts! They were in disguise...great for the kids. Everyone loved them including the Sprout detester in our house. I wish there was a good way to rewarm them for leftovers (there was so much, and I cut the recipe in half!). I'll be making it again.

I make this recipe often, however I add a half cup or so of chicken stock. It smoothes out the bitter taste.

I have made this using pancetta as well and it is just as delicious.  For leftovers, I added to a potato salad I made using olive oil, new potatoes, spring onions, the leftover shredded brussel sprouts and added more crispy pancetta.  A little white wine vinegar salt and pepper and you have a new version of potato salad.

I made this for thanksgiving and everybody loved it.  My boyfriend does not eat brussel sprouts, but took two big scoops and finished it all.  He said they weren't bitter at all.  I did change it a bit as per other reviewers.  I halved the sprouts and after lightly browning for a few minutes I added a few tblsp of chicken broth and covered.  Total cooking time was only about 6 minutes.  Fabulous and will definitely make again!

Very good recipe. I cored the brussels sprouts and quartered them, they naturally shred themselves. In the future I may had a few dashes of balsamic vinegar in the final stages of cooking for added flavor.

Never shredded brussel sprouts before and I have to say I really enjoyed it. I made seasoned salt from the King's seasoned salt recipe on this site and I used sausage instead of bacon because thats what I had. Would make again.

These were surprisingly good.  I have made several times with other chopped nuts I had on hand....almonds, walnuts.  I recommend quartering instead of shredding the sprouts.

We loved this. I have been wanting to use pine nuts, and I had just bought fresh brussels to try this out. The roasted pine nuts make an excellent addition. I cheated and used bacon I had previously cooked from the freezer. Added some bacon grease (I save it) out of the frig, worked out fine. I just added bacon in at the end of the cooking time to get it hot and served. So good. Thanks Momzright for the recipe!

These were a very festive way to serve brussels sprouts and everyone liked them. I used soy nuts instead of pine nuts. Take care not to overcook them because the flavor changes (which is the one most people hate).

This recipe was an absolute his with my 18 guests for Thanksgiving this year.  The taste, texture and color of the dish is terrific.  I used turkey bacon. I will be serving this often.   Many thanks for a great addition to my recipe collection.

My Husband loved Brussel Sprouts, and I myself can take them or leave them!  This was a very good way to prepare the little rascals, and avoid the "strong" flavor often associated with the veggie.  We shedded them by hand, and followed the recipe as is...right down to the bacon and pinenuts. Yummy..not alot of leftovers.  Next time I might add afew cloves of garlic and double the green onions.

I love Brussels Sprouts already.  Wanted to try something new with fresh examples.  Tried this recipe; absolutely fantastic.  Came out wonderful and was very easy to make.  Will make again and again.

We love our brussel sprouts so I was worried about messing with them, especially on Christmas Day, but not only were they relatively easy to make but they tasted GREAT and everyone loved them ... my husband even asked if we could have them every week!  I followed other's advice and quartered the sprouts and I used double-smoked bacon.  I didn't have green onions and didn't miss them.  I'll definitely make them again.  Thanks for a great addition to my favourites!

Took this recipe to Thanksgiving dinner and got rave reviews!  Everyone wanted the recipe!  Thanks so much for sharing!  I used a little more bacon grease, quartered the sprouts (instead of shredding) and went a little heavy on the nuts and salt.  Yummy!

Delicious!  I love brussels sprouts anyway, but my husband doesn't and he really liked these.  Shredding the sprouts was a little labor-intensive, so next time I'll probably use my new food processor (I keep forgetting I have one!), but we both deemed this a "make-again" recipe!

This is the best recipe by far that I've ever had for brussel sprouts.  My husband request these often, and I do not hesitate to add to any company meal.  This recipe is a hit with guest who do not care for brussel sprouts.  Thanks so much for this post!

These are awesome!  I made them for Thanksgiving, thinking only the two brussel sprout fans in the my family would partake.  Even some of my anti-vegetarian family members "tried" the brussel sprouts and had to admit that they were very good.  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  hint...pine nuts are a little pricey---some markets that have a bulk food section carry them in bulk.  This will save you some $$.  If you make this recipe ahead of time, add the crumbled bacon just before serving, so it doesn't get mushy.

This recipe was pretty good. The sprouts seemed somewhat dry though. Next time I make this I will use some vegetable broth to moisten them a little. I used slivered almonds instead of the pine nuts because I can't eat them. Thanks for posting this recipe!

This was not a hit at our house. My husband complained that it still tasted too much like brussel sprouts. I like brussel sprouts but found it too greasy to feel healthy. The butter and bacon alone cancel out the nutritional value. Do yourself a favor- don't do the work and make broccoli or cauliflower instead.

This recipe was great. I am a vegetarian so I used fake bacon, eliminated the butter (used olive oil insted), used chopped almonds instead of pine nuts (I didn't have any pine nuts).

This is an excellent recipe.  Really different - really good.  I used my food processor to slice the brussel sprouts and it went really fast.  The texture of the sprouts are great - not your typical texture of boiled brussel sprouts.  Will make again and again.

I was looking for something different, and purchased brussel spouts at the store - I ran across this five star recipe, and thought I better give it a try!  It's a definite keeper!  I loved it!  I used Lawrey's Seasoning Salt in place or regular salt - Everyone cleaned their plates!

I tried this recipe because I was looking for something out of the ordinary.  This was a simple recipe that indeed makes brussel sprouts "fantastic."  Even my 19 year old son who would rather walk over hot coals than eat a brussel sprout LOVED them.  He asked that I make them at least once every two weeks so that he can take them back to college with him.  It's a miracle!!

I must admit I didn't pay attention to the quantities of the ingredients, just their combination in this dish. I used a bag of brussel sprouts (quartered instead of shredded), 3 pieces bacon, 3 scallions, 2 tbsp butter, not quite 1/4 cup of pine nuts, healthy grind of pepper and just a dash of seasoned salt since the bacon is also salty. This was so delicious- I think the butter enhances the flavor of the sprouts more than my usual roasting in olive oil. Definitely making this at Thanksgiving!

Pine nuts + bacon + brussel sprouts = taste bud heaven.  It took about 30 minutes to core and shred the brussel sprouts, so add that to the prep time.  Love this dish and will enjoy it often in the future.  Thank you so much!

I will keep this recipe. I did replace pine nuts for pecans (money saver) and purchased brussels already shredded to save time,added garlic per another reviewer (as I love garlic).  This will be my brussels recipe side, replacing others!

Hubby and I really liked it. I sliced the Brussel sprouts but Will try the food processor next time. Didn't add any nuts but next time I'll try that or chopped water chestnuts might be very good too and add some crunch. I did not have much bacon grease so I added 2 teaspoons of garlic evoo and 1tablespoon butter.  This is a keeper.

I loved this recipe, it had a nice melody of flavors with the bacon & pine nuts (plus my addition).  I wasn't sure exactly how to shred the Brussel sprouts so I just cut off the stem end and then sliced them.  Also, one thing that I did that improved the flavor was that I took a nice sized Vidalia onion (sliced) and caramelized it in some butter.  This took more time (it does if you do it right) but I think that bit of sweetness from the caramelization really added something.

I made this recipe to go with Christmas dinner. It is so good and definitely a keeper! The only changes I made were chopped almonds instead of pine nuts and I chopped the brussel sprouts instead of shredding. Great flavor!

Loved this recipe, as did everyone who has tried it. Trader Joe's sells shredded sprouts, which makes it even easier.

Wonderful recipe! I get rave review from guests every time I make this dish. For a healthier option, I sometimes use olive oil and skip the bacon part. Also, some grocery stores now have bagged pre shredded Brussels...makes the prep work a breeze!!

I substituted the pine nuts with pecans and quartered them instead of shredding, but otherwise followed the recipe.  Everyone liked this, but next time I'd try soaking the brussel sprouts in salt water as another reviewer suggested, as I still found them to have a slight bitter taste.

Loved this!  My husband detests brussel sprouts; I'm on the fence, but determined to find a recipe that was good.  This one hit the mark.  We both loved it.  Thanksgiving is day-after tomorrow.  I'm planning on bringing this dish as our contribution.  Fantastic.

I cut back on the bacon grease and mess by heating up precooked bacon and I also used less butter and this was still DELICIOUS! It is a favorite of my husband now.

This recipe is kind of insane, in a good way. Brussels sprouts are one of my favorite vegetables, and this just might be my new favorite way to prepare them. Coring and shredding the sprouts is a little time consuming but the results are well worth it. I prefer to omit the butter and *not* drain the bacon grease; I find the bacon fat more flavorful than butter.

We love this recipe so much - even the kids - that we have moved it to one of our sides for Thanksgiving dinner [requested by the kids!] ONLY caution is making ahead [except for adding in bacon] & re-heating without over-cooking - the stove area is too crowded to be sauteing right before serving this big feast!n Would love any suggestions.

I'm always trying to find a recipe that will turn me on to brussels sprouts... have not yet any success yet.  If you like this vegetable, then this is the recipe for you.  But if you are like me and don't like them, don't expect this recipe to win you over.

I halved the recipe, followed instructions except left out the pine nuts ( we don't care for them ) and added extra bacon for the bacon lovers here.  Very tasty. Thanks for sharing.

I omitted the bacon and used Olive Oil and just 1 small pat of butter, and also added julienne carrots (add the carrots to the skillet about a minute before the sprouts)  and it was awesome!

I cooked this dish for my husbabd, knowing he would turn his nose up at eating "brussel sprouts.". I couldn't have been more surprised when he went back for seconds and told me I could cook this "anytime!" it really is extremely tasty and will appear as a regular dish on our table.  Thanks for the recipe!

Again, like the other reviews said, I made this for my husband and he doesn't normally like brussel sprouts, and he loved them. I just cut the ends and halved the brussel spouts. I didn't use bacon and I substituted pumpkin seeds for pine nuts and red onion for the green onions.

Cooked this tonight. Both my boyfriend and I loved it. I will definitely be making it again. Also, I'm from the south so I LOVE BACON- but it's not the dominant flavor here. All the ingredients work really well together

This was very good; I did make a few adjustments based on my preferences and also recommendations by other reviewers.

I skipped the butter & pine nuts.  Used 2 tsp. of bacon grease and about 1/2 cup of chicken broth with some minced garlic with a bit of sea salt & black pepper as my sautee liquid.

Cooked over medium heat for 7 minutes, and added 2 pieces of crumbled bacon.

Delicious!

Excellent flavor although I used only 1 Tbsp. of bacon grease.  It's hard for me to justify adding saturated fat to vegetables.

These were fantastic!  I made them for Thanksgiving and they were all gone, which was a major shocker.  Even my husband ate them!  I made them a second time a week later, this time I quartered them and used almond slivers instead of pine nuts.  Next time I'm going to sprinkle in a bit of gorgonzola (stealing this from Match Box in DC China Town) Yummy!

EVERYONE loved it! Once it was not in it's normal form no one questioned that it was a brussel sprout and asked for more. I made it again and added some leftover chicken, it was a big hit AGAIN.

This was delicious-- even those who don't like brussels sprouts liked it!  The pine nuts gave it so much flavor.  I didn't put in the bacon crumbles-- the flavor from the drippings was perfect.

Excellent way to serve Brussels sprouts. I used walnuts instead of pine nuts with success. I even left nuts out completely and it was still super. The bacon is a must though. :)

I really enjoyed this dish.  I have always enjoyed brussels sports and this was a fun way to work with them.  The pine nuts were expensive to purchase but definitely worth it.  The only complaint is that it was a little too buttery!  I followed the recipe exactly but might use less butter next time.

I've been making this recipe for 4 years now, and I haven't changed a thing from the way it's written.  A great recipe that's been asked for by others several times!  Everyone who has ate it, loves it - even those who don't like Brussels Sprouts!  A couple years ago I found that lightly chopping the sprouts in a food processor really saves some time - I would spend a great deal of time chopping the sprouts before - so that might be the only thing I'd add to this recipe as a helpful hint.  Oh, and you need a big pan (a big soup pan, preferably) - the sprouts will wilt down, but when first added, they take up a lot of room.

Wonderful way to cook brussels sprouts.  I did halve the amount of pine nuts because they seem to overpower the dish.

I have fixed this for years, but I found if you quarter the brussels sprouts it doesn't look as messy and makes it more favorable. This is a must at holidays.

Absolutely Delicious!  I shredded the brussel sprouts ( which took a while to do), but I love the light fluffy texture, so well worth the time. The smoky bacon flavour really added depth and interest to this dish!  I still prefer "simple" brussels sprouts.. However, to all the brussel sprout haters at my Xmas dinner party, THEY LOVED THIS RECIPE!  Very lovely accompaniement for a dinner party!  Beware.. pine nuts burn quicly so you have to watch them constantly while browning them ;) Every thanksgiving, Christmas, they are requested by many and a real fan favourite!

My family loved it.  I did use Turkey Bacon to cut back on the fat content, but I think I would use real bacon next time to help with the flavor.   We are not big Brussel Sprout fans, so this was pretty good for being an unwanted veggie!

I really like brussel sprouts but for those of you who do not share my fondness for them, I bet you will after you try this recipe. These are so good.  The only thing I did differently was that I quartered the brussel sprouts instead of shredding them. Other than that, I saw no need to mess with a good thing! :)

My Boyfriend and I have been on this kick where we try new veggies, last night was the big night for the Brussels sprout. He said he had them b4  they were bitter. I remember eating them as a kid thinking YUCK never again. I grabbed a bag of them from my local farmers market and gave'em a whirl last night . They were FANTASTIC!!! The only thing I did different was I did not have pine nuts so I used pecans.  I will defiantly make them AGAIN!!!! YUMMY!!! YUMMY!!! YUMMY!!!

My daughter and I share a bountiful basket weekly and this week one of the items was brussel sprouts - yuck!  But, I found this recipe so thought I would try it.  Another item in the basket was persimmons.  We did not even know what it was  - thought it was a tomato until I cut it.  It was sweet and I decided since I did not know what to do with it, I would shred it with the brussel sprouts.    There is none left.  It was fantastic and we will surely have it again.  (I used two persimmons to the brussel sprouts.)  Good luck!

I changed this recipe just a little so there wouldn't be as much calories. I used Turkey Bacon instead of regular bacon. When cooking with Turkey Bacon there really isn't any grease so I just added the butter to the pan that I cooked it in & continued with the recipe without the grease. My boys loved it & I was surprised to find myself liking this as well.

Its always a good sign when everyone wants seconds of their vegetables! Halved the recipe and omitted the green onions (because I didnt have any one hand). Was incredible! We never really ate brussels sprouts but will be now! Thank you for this recipe!!!

AWESOME! I just finished making this recipe (with a few modifications..i didn't "shred" the brussel sprouts, just peeled the leaves off, and no nuts, also used regular onions) for Christmas dinner. There is only one other brussel sprout fan aside from myself in the family, but after tasting the finished product (at 7am) I am SURE a few others might convert today! The taste is fantastic, and though it's not exactly the healthiest way to eat veggies, at least their in there somewhere!

Just like the description says...this recipe was FANTASTIC!!! Even my picky son ate them and the rest of the family who like brussel sprouts loved!! I would follow the recipe exactly but what I would change that I did is I thought it would be more favorful if I left all of the bacon grease and it was a little too greasy so definitely only reserve 2 tbsp like the recipe calls for.  I will be making again!

Fabulous!  I threw this together tonight in a last minute thought with the fresh brussel sprouts I had. I just quartered them.  It was easy to do, looked spectacular and It was delicious!

the only thing i did different was to just cut the brussels in half or quarters, depending on the size, just cause i didnt feel like shredding.  this is a VERY delicious dish!!!!!!

This was really good.  My wife (who doesn't normally like Brussels Sprouts) gobbled them up! She's a big fan of anything with pine nuts.  I followed the advice of another reviewer and used the cuisinart to shred - which I regret.  The texture was too fine and the dish didn't have a great deal of plate appeal.  So I'd either shred by hand or just quarter.  Will definitely be making again.  Thanks MOMZRIGHT.

If you're not sure how to prepare brussel sprouts- this is it!  These were so delicious!  I really think just about anything would taste good cooked with pine nuts and bacon, but the combination truly did complement the sprouts well.  I didn't substitute any of the ingredients.

I didn't think I liked Brussels sprouts, but with this recipe, I found out that I do like them!  I made this recipe for only two servings (there's no way my husband would eat it), and I left out the pine nuts.  This is a delicious recipe, though!  I'd found a recipe similar to this for cabbage and didn't like it much, but the flavors mesh perfectly with Brussels sprouts.  I will definitely make this again!  I think I'll try it at one of our Sunday suppers too, and see how it goes over :)  Thanks so much for a great recipe, and making me realize that I don't hate Brussels sprouts.

Our favorite Brussels Sprout recipe by far!!!  I have made these a few times and they are much better just rough chopped instead of shredded.  The bacon gives it a great taste.  I cooked mine until they were pretty browned too.  I also used roasted slivered almonds.  But we had them without any nuts and they were just as good.  Mmmmmm Mmmmmm good!!

my friends and i had brussel sprouts cooked this way at a local restaurant during the holidays. we've been trying to find the perfect recipe since then. THIS IS IT! only change i made was to add half a can (~8 oz) of chicken broth to simmering sprouts. i also cut mine instead of shredding them (cut stem ends off Brussel sprouts, discard discoloured outside leaves. cut in half lenghtwise, then slice crosswise to make thin strips)

This recipe is fantastic.  I have converted numerous "Brussels haters" into "lovers".  I do usually omit the pine nuts, and add some chicken broth while the sprouts are simmering.  This receipe really makes the vegetable quite mild and tasty.

We really loved this recipe as written. I later made a variation where I cooked down some sliced onions, then added the shredded sprouts, then some aspargus cut in pieces, and finally some halved cherry tomatoes.

A great way to dress up brussel sprouts for Christmas Eve dinner. I quartered the brussel sprouts instead of shredding though. Even those who didn't care for brussel sprouts tried this dish and complimented.

These were great!   I used walnut instead of pine nuts.  Even my dad, who hates brussesls sprouts, liked theses.  Not how I would fix them for eery day (not too healthy), but good for a special dinner.

Cut brussels into quarters. Used walnuts instead of pine nuts (allergic). Everyone liked them. I thought they were a little greasy.

We really enjoyed these.  Not bitter at all.  We only used about a tablespoon of bacon grease so they ended up a little dry.  Next time we will use more grease for consistency and flavor as the were a little bland without it!  Basically next time I'll follow the recipe instead of trying to make it healthier with less grease.

This is a terrific recipe! I don't think I cooked it long enough because the brussels sprouts were a little crunchy, but the flavors were out of this world. You could make easy adjustments to get some fat and calories down, but this is a winner. BTW- I normally hate brussels sprouts!

I tried this because I got Brussels Sprouts as part of a Community Supported Agriculture vegetable share.  I've never eaten them, but my boyfriend warned me he didn't like them.  I quartered the sprouts instead of shredding them, but otherwise followed the recipe.  I thought the flavor of the bacon and pine nuts would disguise the sprouts but nope.  I ended up eating the whole batch (not an entirely pleasant experience) The seasoning for the sprouts was heavy and oily, and didn't compliment the vegetables well.

This was delicious.  As a previous reviewer suggested, I cut the cooking time a few minutes short and transferred the pan (oven safe) to a 400 degree oven to roast the sprouts.  Out of preference, I used pecans rather than pine nuts.  Will definitely make this again!

I get requests for this all the time. The only thing I change is the pine nuts.. I'm pregnant and for some reason they gross me out now.. This is a great way to get Brussels sprouts-haters to eat them with a smile on their face! :)

This is a great recipe! I didn't shread the sprouts, just cut them in half and they still turned out great. Even my Father, who is a chef, loved these!

I left out the bacon and bacon grease because one of my guests did not eat it.  Intead, I substituted olive oil for the grease.  It was sensational!  One of the nice things is that some people find the flavor of brussels sprouts overpowering, but when they are shredded, it softens the flavor.

I made this recipe last night, except I didn't have pine nuts, so chopped up pecans and put them in a skillet to heat up and get the oils going, then made as directed.  This is definitely a keeper...yummy!  Will definitely make again.

With the Brussels Sprouts shredded it just picked up too much of the grease.  I will try this again just cutting the Brussels in half and add some garlic.

This is a keeper!  Didn't have green onions or pine nuts (not that I would use the pine nuts), so I added some chopped red onion & about 1 tsp. chives.  I also added 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes w/ the brussel sprouts & onions & some grated Parm. Cheese when I served it.  It was excellent.  My picky 5 yo really liked these.  Don't be afraid to try them even if you *think* you won't like them.

I used turkey bacon so theres no extra grease to drain and I sliced my brussel sprouts in circles. This dish tasted wonderful. There were none left over.

We made this for Thanksgiving. I  quartered the sprouts and left out the pine nuts.  My sprouts were a bit bitter - the fault of the sprouts, not the recipe.  I added a small splash of vinegar and this solved the bitterness problem.  Since we are not fans of so much bacon in our vegies, I am giving this recipe a 4.  Bacon lovers should consider this a 5.

as a former chef who loves brussel sprouts, I am always looking for new recipes.  This one was very disappointing.  Very greazy and I didn't think the flavors complimented the natural sweetness of brussel sprouts that are cooked properly.

This deserves 5 stars plus! Prep time took awhile, but so worth it. Next time I would core and shred the sprouts the day before serving for quicker prep. Even non brussel sprout lovers WILL love this. The hit of the meal!

This is the best brussel sprout recipe ever!!
It is such a pretty dish, very summery and green, the pine nuts look so pretty in there! 
My whole family loved these, even my super -picky brother.
The only thing was we had to core and shred all the brussel sprouts by hand! That took a little while!
We will make these many more times!!
 Thanks:)

I served this without telling my guest what it was and watched them devour it. They couldn't believe it was brussel sprouts. It had no bitter taste due to the coring of the sprouts before shredding. We loved it!

Shred these in your food processor to save time, as I did them by hand and it took some time, Deelish!

Overall, a good tasting dish. I think we may have accidently added too much seasoning salt, which was our fault, but the rest of it was delicious. We also left out the pine nuts and it still tasted great. Just the right blend of a vegetable and a meat.

Loved it!  I make it all the time now pleasing even the kids and teens. I always look for brussels when I grocery shop -  just so I can make this recipe.  I use it to impress and win over former "brussel sprout haters".  Only problem is that I never make enough.

This was a great way to get everyone to eat their brussel sprouts! It was VERY tasty which makes up for the fact that it can't be all that healthy with the bacon and butter.... :o) 

I will definately make this again, it was quick, easy and very yummy. I made it according to recipe but I did cut back on the butter.

If I make this again, I will just core and quarter the brussel sprouts. The shredded texture just didn't do it for me. Also, I will omit the pine nuts. I don't care for those flavours together. But sauteed in butter and with bacon, these sprouts just might be tasty.

Very tasty, but kind of labor intensive for sprouts.  I didn't have pine nuts and I used turkey bacon.  I like brussel sprouts but my husband and kids don't like them.  Hubby was pleasantly suprised and liked the recipe.  I thought that this recipes would trick the kids and they would not know they were eating brussel sprouts.  Guess there is no tricking those crafty kids, they just turned their little noses up.

My household is already a fan of brussel sprouts, but boy this recipe really made these good.  I'd only boil brussel sprouts before, but now we have an alternate way of cooking them.  5 Stars for sure on this recipe.  I've never been a fan of cooking with nuts, but the pine nuts really do add to this.

I have to say, I have never had brussel sprouts, nor have my kids, but I wanted something different at the holiday table, so I searched for a brussel sprout recipe that had a good rating, and I definately found it in this recipe. Not only were my kids asking for more, but people who don't even like brussel sprouts. It is a little bit of work, but worth it, I will definatly be making this again, I have already been asked for the recipe...pretty good for brussel sprouts. Thanks for making the first experience a good one for me and my kids and offering a different version for the people who have had bad experiences with them in the past..hehehe.This is the only way I will make them from now on...tons of flavor.

Fantastic taste with equal presentation appeal. Guaranteed to be a hit eith family or company and will forever change their disposition on brussel sprouts. Out of the 40 or so 5-star recipes from allrecipes, this is the best.

My brother and sister-in-law DETEST brussels sprouts and made all sorts of snide remarks as I was preparing this dish for our Christmas dinner. 

Much to everyone's shock and amazement, (especially my own), they asked for second helpings, then third's!  Who would have thought?

This was superb! I substituted pecans for the pine nuts and instead of the green onions, I used grilled onions. (As a working mother, I always keep a supply of grilled onions in my freezer to quickly add to any dish or baked potatoes.) Thank you for the excellent recipe.

This recipe was very easy to make and very good!I used fresh brocolli and simmered for about 20 minutes on low.
Absolutely delicious!
"I" had never had broccoli but my fiance had.We both enjoyed it and
wouldn't hesitate to use this for a special dinner with company any time of year!

Delicious! I was a little nervous about bringing something to a holiday gathering without making it at home first. I received many compliments on it and hostess asked if i would mind sharing the recipe, so i sent her the link to it.

This tastes amazing and one of the best ways to eat Brussels sprouts. I didn’t have any green onion on hand so that’s the only difference.

To make my cooking life more interesting, each Thanksgiving season I try a new recipe for everything - stuffing, rolls, brine, desserts, and brussel sprouts. This one is so good, I may stick with it next year. Sprouts + bacon + pine nuts = bliss.

Love this recipe! I cheated and bought a bag of Brussels sprouts already shredded. I left out the butter - not necessary for flavor. The only other thing I did different was add about a 1/4 to 1/3 teaspoon of sugar which helps with any bitterness. The balsamic vinegar was excellent to finish it off. I always add a little sugar to all of the greens I cook - turnip greens, collard greens, kale, etc - always helps with flavor or bitterness.

These were great.  The only thing I did differently was cut back to about 1/3 cup of the pine nuts, and after tasting it I decided to add about 1T of balsamic vinegar.  And I do like them a little crispier so I threw the pan in the oven and broiled them for about 5 mins.  The recipe as is is delicious-I just decided to add my own pizzazz to it.  Brussel Sprouts are good with shelled pumpkin seeds too so I may try that next time.

Hubby and I really enjoyed this dish, it has great flavor. Only thing I'll do different next time is use my food processor to shred the Brussels, they were challenging on a stand up grater. This dish has great texture loved it.

Fantastic! I accidentally added too much seasoning salt so through a couple of raw potatoes in to try and soak it up and added a little bit of maple syrup to even out the saltiness and it was delicious!

OK,  whenever asked about foods I do not liked my answer has always been "liver & brussels sprouts".  Now it will be "liver".  I was asked to bring Brussels sprouts to Thanksgiving dinner yesterday (Canada).  I though oh no.  I have never cooked them before but I was up to the challenge.  Searched my trusted Allrecipes site and it did not fail me.  This recipe was a hit!!  One thing I did do as another suggested was soak them in salt water for 1 hour to take away bitterness.  I did then made the dish exactly as the recipe stated. It is going in my keeper file!!!

I omitted the green onions because I didn't have any on hand, and  I added more seasoning salt.  My whole family loved it.

This was so so good. I served it the next day at room temperature and it was even good then! I didn’t have pine nuts so I added pecans. This is definitely to be a favorite.

Very nice! I didn’t have pine nuts so I used peanuts, cashews, and pumpkin seeds mix and then at the end I added dried sweet cherries.

Everyone loves this dish...fresh or dried garlic both work. The roasting is what makes the texture of the sprouts so great. One of my favorite side dishes!

This recipe was REALLY great.  My husband who does not like Brussels Sprouts actually enjoyed them.  I didn't have pine nuts so I used slivered almonds instead.

I used pre-cooked bacon, only about half the butter, had no pine nuts or green onions...and they still turned out very nice! I went back for seconds. This is my new go-to recipe for Brussels sprouts.

I usually avoid Brussels sprouts but decided to try this recipe based on the high reviews of others. I was not disappointed. The only change I made was swapping out pecans for pine nuts because that’s what I had. Loved the crunch the nuts and bacon add to the dish

I usually don't like Brussels sprouts, but this was a hit. Of course I changed it up... I felt like it needed a little salt at the end of the cooking time, so I had the idea to use soy sauce. It was great, and would be even better with some of those crunchy wonton noodles.

I loved everything about the recipe except the pine nuts. Was not a big fan of the taste or texture. However the sprouts were fabulous. I now make it with pecans or almonds . If you like pine nuts I am sure the recipe is great as is. This was just a taste preference for my family.

This was good. I'm not sure I put enough bacon in it. I also didn't shred the Brussels sprouts, I cut them in half instead, so it took a lot longer to cook. Next time I would cut the recipe in half, because it was a lot for two of us, even with leftovers.

Brussels and bacon ..what's not to love. I did omit the pine nuts (personal preference).
I used turkey bacon..and only 2 tbsp of butter just because I am eating healthier.  It was very tasty..and I really didn't miss the extra fat.

Bacon and sprout, always tasty and popular in my house. If I made it again I would NOT "shred" the sprouts (too fine, hard to cook well) and would either slice them thinly (food processor) or quarter them.  Evcen the photo with the recipe shows quartered sprouts. Huh?

This is such a yummy recipe.  I've made it  several times.  Usually use less butter than called for and have used reg. onions when out of green onions to no detriment.  Always a hit and some don't even know the base is Brussel sprouts.  Reheats well too!

Deserving of a Video. As another reviewer stated: Make as instructed to rate appropriately b4 changing. Omit Pine Nuts if too $ but butter and bacon grease, etc.  Excellent!  I did garlic second time but for dinner only. No garlic for breakfast; with white cheddar omelet, OMGoodness! Roasting(?) pine nuts in fat fixes it for those who do not like them just like it fixes Brussels tendency to be bitter. If you buy baby Brussels in frozen section, purchase Hanover only!(!) as they are truly tiny; no cutting or shredding and finished quickly(thaw and squeeze out water with paper towels)! At times the store has huge Brussels that require peeling quite a bit as they're bitter regardless of this wondrous recipe!  TY TY TY

I'm not big on sprouts but this is a good recipe! You can't go wrong with butter and bacon in the mix. The combination of these with the sprouts are the keys to this dish in my opinion and the addition of the pine nuts is a nice touch.

Delicious! Just what I was looking for rather than simple roasted Brussels sprouts.  I used sliced almonds when I realized I was out of pine nuts and the recipe was just as good. This will be my new favorite stand-by Brussels sprout recipe.

Perfection! You can just dump everything in the skillet at once. You can reduce the butter a touch but please don't change the recipe.  What a fantastic recipe. I will make this all the time. Use fresh Brussell's sprouts. Huge difference.

Wow! This is delicious! The only thing I changed was that I quartered the sprouts instead of shredding them and when I put the sprouts into the pan, I added a little bit of water (barely covered most of the bottom of the pan) and put a lid on the pan so the sprouts can steam. I then removed the lid so the water can boil off. I love brussel sprouts and this recipe is hands down the best I've tasted! The sprouts were nicely golden brown once cooked. I will make this again. I may next time, reduce some of the fat by splitting it with broth...we'll see.

I didn't shred them because I had some 'baby sprouts' that were small already. I confess...I didn't eat any. But my hubby who usually disapproves of Brussels sprouts but loves bacon decided these were acceptable. My 4 year old nephew still spit them out. My mom & sister both really liked them though. That was enough good response for me to save this recipe for another time. Maybe I'll even be brave and try them, too.

I followed the recipe nearly as written. The only change  made was to halve or quarter the sprouts and not shred them, as many others have recommended. I am always surprised how quickly pine nuts go from not brown to burnt. Luckily, I did nt burn the pine nuts this time, but it was a close call. The Brussels sprouts were fantastic. Even the five year old ate them up.

Made this for christmas dinner and it went over great!  Got lots of compliments and didn't have any leftovers, which is the true test.  Ended up just quartering them after my food processor died that morning and I left out the pine nuts for a family allergy.  I just added a little more bacon to make up for the crunch.  My family generally isn't big on veggies so I was very happy with this recipe.

We made it with 1 lb Brussels Sprouts (cut into quarters) four large strips of crisped up and diced bacon some onion powder a heaping teaspoon of garlic, then slowly sauteed all of that in about a tablespoon of bacon grease and about a third stick of butter. Very good!

It was an okay dish. The high points were bacon and pine nuts, but that's mostly because my family likes bacon and pine nuts not matter what they are in. I listened to the other reviewers and cut the amount of butter and fat in half. If I had added that much the sprouts would have been swimming in butter and grease. We liked it well enough, but will probably try another recipe for Brussels sprouts next time.

I made this for a Christmas side dish. I quartered the brussel sprouts instead of shredding them and we really liked it that way. This was a winner and will be making it again.

I loved this recipe. In order to make it a meal in itself I added a bit of cream to finish and then tossed it with penne pasta. Out of necessity, I used Speck instead of bacon, adding a little bit of pork lard to make it fatty enough. I also substituted with clarified butter.

This recipe is definitely going to enter my regular rotation. Thank you so much for sharing!

This easy recipe was a good first one to introduce Brussels sprouts to my family.  I changed the recipe to 4 servings (half the original) and omitted the butter.  In place of the butter, I increased the bacon grease to 3 T. and added olive oil as needed while cooking the sprouts.  I quartered the sprouts rather than shred them and that worked well.  My 3-star rating is more due to the fact that I will eat Brussels sprouts but don't love them rather than anything "against" the recipe.

Excellent!  I cheat and use frozen bacon fat that I saved, and use Real bacon crumbles or bits.  I also add dried cranberries (craisins), and quarter the sprouts.  Everyone loved them.

Good recipe. I didn't have pine nuts and still came out tasty. Also, next time I would just cut the brussel sprouts instead of shredding, took too long.

Absolutely delicious!  Everyone raved about them.  One of my guests had 3 helpings and does not even like brussell sprouts...:)  She even asked for the recipe and made them about 2 weeks later when having family over for dinner.  Thanks for sharing.

I brought this dish to Easter dinner and it was a big hit.  It was easy to make ahead and travel with by cooking most of the way and reheating quickly when I got to my parents' house.  Very easy to make, takes only a few ingredients, and everyone liked it.

Ive now made this several times. The recipe calls for bacon, well I use applewood smoked. The key ( to me) is to only take the leaves down to where the white of the core starts.

Yum!  Normally I just steam Brussel sprouts, but I decided to try something different and I loved these.  Made exactly like the recipe- I did use  a little less butter since I'm always on a diet, but they were great.  I think a person could use almonds instead of pine nuts, since they are so expensive.  I've got Xmas leftovers that I'm looking forward too- these most of all!
I'll definitely make these again.

Really good! I used my food processor to shred them which made it super easy. Also, prior to that I trimmed the ends and soaked them in salt water as suggested by a previous reviewer. Excellent!

We didn't love it. It needed a flavor boost so we added a little maple and that helped a lot. Also, shredding it didn't do much except add kind of an odd texture. I prefer cooking them in halves, and that opinion was supported by this recipe.

You know you have a winner when your pickiest child comes in the kitchen asking what's for dinner, and gives you a "YES!!!!" when told it's brussels sprouts (and couscous).  This is so easy to make, and so good.  I simply sliced off the ends, and threw the brussels sprouts in my processor to shred.  I sometimes substitute sliced almonds for the pine nuts, if I don't have any handy.

Made for Xmas side dish last year with thawed bags of frozen of Brussel sprouts instead of fresh but my family loved it all the same! I kept the recipe otherwise the same. Will make it again this year!

A great recipe that goes well with any protein. It's a great combination of ingredients. I core and shred the sprouts, and sometimes use lemon olive oil in place of the butter, or just squeeze fresh lemon juice. It adds a great burst of flavor.  I also sauteed these for only 2-3 minutes until they are bright green.  My husband loves the texture  and I'm making them for my mother in law tonite, who scrunched her nose up at the mention of them!

I have never had Brussels sprouts in my life but I gave this recipe a try.  Fantastic!! The only thing I changed was I used pre-cooked bacon slices for ease.  My kids loved it too.  I will definitely make this again!

I loved the mixed textures and flavors. I will definitely make it again. I quartered the brussel sprouts, rather than shred, just my personal preference.

Made without bacon and it was still well received.  Quartered instead of shredded. Chopped the loose leaves and stems with garlic and added them toward the end.

I shredded as instructed and I think it would have been better with bigger pieces like the photo. The flavor is really good and interesting. Next time I will add a little chicken stock for a wetter finish.

Made this for Thanksgiving the last two years and the serving bowl was empty when dinner was over. Most of the folks wanted the recipe. When I make it at home it gets eaten in a hurry. Want to know what to do with the left overs - make an omelet. Yummy.

I think part of the problem on my end was too much bacon and not enough sprouts.  Not tasty enough.

Fantastic!  I followed the suggestions to just quarter rather than shred the sprouts and used scallions (only 2 T) because I had no green onions.  I have always been a fan of brussel sprouts and love these more than any other receipe I have tried since they got "trendy."  Ate way more than my allotted portion,

I have a shortcut, when I make Bacon I save some bacon grease in a jar in the refrigerator and it stays good for months.  I start with a Tablespoons or two of the bacon grease in the skillet, and just a tablespoon of butter.  I'll add whatever nuts I have on hand, last night I used slivered almonds which were great.  I'll skip the green onions if I don't have any.  I'll add another tablespoon of butter as needed if the brussel sprouts start browning.  Lastly, I add about 1/4 cup of pre-packaged Bacon Pieces when I take the skillet off the heat.  This dish is always a hit!

Really Really Really good when served right away! I kept the sprouts whole but next time I'd quarter or half them. The pine nuts would incorporate into the dish better.

I made this recipe several years ago for a family Thanksgiving.  My family loved them. My niece who is now 13 (she was probably 7 or 8 at the time and didn't eat them, much less anything else) now loves them when her Dad makes them for her.  Thanks to me for cooking out of the ordinary food.

Taste good, but not worth all of the effort cutting up the brussel sprounts. You could substitute a head of cabbage and get the same effect.

I had never had brussels sprouts before, so I don't have any thing to compare to.  My husband and I liked them very much.  I cut them in half versus shredding them, but feel that shredding would be worth the effort next time.  The pine nuts were great as it gave some crunchiness and a great flavor to the brussels sprouts.

I prepared this dish for the first time last Christmas Eve and my grown son literally wrinkled his nose when I told him the vegetable was going to be brussel sprouts.  I've always loved them, he's always hated them.  We all loved this recipe and he even asked me to make it for Thanksgiving this year.  It's a really flavorful dish and even if you aren't crazy about sprouts it's worth trying.

DELICIOUS! I made it exactly and it was wonderful. I kept sneaking forkfulls from the stove as I was getting the rest of dinner together.  I was making this to "test" before Thanksgiving and I think it made the cut!  Thank you for a great recipe.

LOVED them!!  Kids didn't care for them, but I am not usually a fan of brussell sprouts either.  Best thing about it, you don't have to measure ingredients exactly, make it to fit your taste.  This will become a new regular on my dinner table.

This was SO good.  I actually made it for Thanksgiving last year but forgot to rate it.  Everyone loved it!  Even those who don't care for sprouts too much :)  We do not add pine nuts due to a nut allergy.  Divine!

This was good, received a thumbs-up from the husband. I had to make a few adjustments based on what I had on hand, but I don't think it changed the overall taste of the dish. I like this, but with the fat content, I think I will only make it occassionally and stick with my favorite way of cooking brussels sprouts- roasted w/salt, pepper, and olive oil.

I followed the recipe to the T everyone really enjoyed except for me it was awfully but what the heck I don’t like Brussels sprouts. But I like to cook and try new recipes at least every other day. I gave it five stars because it tasted just like others said it would and everyone liked it.  It had a light nutty flavor with bacon. A little bit of a bitter taste of the sprouts It looked really good and very easy to make

This was alright. I had to make a few changes. I don't eat pork so I used turkey sausage instead. Used vegetable stock to compensate for the bacon grease. By mistake I got a regular onion instead of green onions. And it needed more seasoning salt than recommended... And the prep took longer than 20 mins... It took like 40 mins to cut the br. sprouts... But even the 5 yr old liked it...

I didn't try these, as brussel sprouts taste like cabbage to me and I'm not a fan of cabbage.  Bf, however, is a fan of cabbage so I made these for him.  I cut the servings size down to 2 since I only had a 1/2 lb, and he ate both servings with lunch.  I subbed already cooked cheddarwurst for the bacon and left out the pine nuts since he's not a huge fan. Definitely a success; like I said, he ate every bite and then went back for seconds to finish off the pan.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made these for family Thanksgiving - almost 4 lbs!  They were wonderful!  I made my bacon in the microwave.  I used butter and olive oil and omitted the bacon grease.  I did not use Green Onion, but instead 2 sweet onions.  Even my M-I-L who originally had turned up her nose at my volunteering to bring Brussel Sprouts to her Thanksgiving dinner admittedly said she really liked them!  And, she wasn't the only one.  Several people took home leftover Brussel Sprouts with them!

Very tasty dish!  I used my new mini-food processor and the sprouts were shredded before I could say "I hate to shred brussels sprout".    I substituted pecans for pine nuts with good results.   This will be a recipe that I come back to often.  Excellent side dish.

I served this as a warm salad at a dinner party last night and it was a huge hit.  If you chop the sprouts by hand, this is a bit of work, but it's totally worth it...absolutely delicious! My only modification was doubling the butter. Also, 1 pound of shredded sprouts easily served 6 in my case. I was left with a lot of extra uncooked sprouts. Guess I'll just have to make more! ;-)

Excellent combination of flavors!  My husband loved this dish so much he couldn't stop gushing about it.  Rather than shredding the Brussels sprouts I quartered them.  I also didn't agitate them much in the pan thus a yummy brown crust formed on the sprouts.  Very delicious.

I made this for Thanksgiving. Could not find FRESH brussels sprouts (disappointed!) So I had to use "fresh frozen". I was worried about the quality of the sprouts more than anything. No worries, it turned out great! I started not to use the pine nuts because I do not cook with them often but I am so glad I did include them. EVERYONE like this dish. I made a double recipe for seven diners and just had enough. I will be making this again, it was simple and delicious. Hope I can find fresh sprouts next time. Thanks for the recipe!

The flavor of the recipe was very good.  Unfortunately, I used my food processor and it turned the Brussel sprouts to mush.  I will quarter them by hand the next time.

This is an excellent side dish for your Thanksgiving dinner.  I have tried many other Brussel sprout recipes from this site and never have I had the compliments that this one garnered.  As others recommended I quartered the sprouts rather than shredding.  Next time I will take the time to shred which could only make the dish tastier.  I did sub slivered almonds for pine nuts just for convenience and will probably cut back to 1/2 cup next time.  This recipe will definitely will show up on our table again.  
Update - I have made this recipe more times than I can count.  It has become a family favorite.  Sometimes I shred, sometimes I quarter and when I have small sprouts like today I just halve.  Always remove the core and pine nuts work out the best with this.  I also add a touch of red wine vinegar right at the end of the prep to give the dish a little zing.

This was the perfect recipe to get my super picky family to eat brussels sprouts.  The first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly.  Next time around, I was out of pine nuts so substituted slivered almonds.  Just as good.  Excellent mixed in rice.

I am a lifelong lover of Brussels Sprouts and I really liked this recipe.  I used prosciutto instead of bacon and omitted the green onion and it was very good. My 8 year old said that they were great and even the 5 year old managed to finish his serving (though not as enthusiastically as his big brother)

Excellent dish. I didn't shred the brussel sprouts, just cored and then quartered. I think this would be a great dish for people who don't like the taste of brussel sprouts on their own. It has an almost smoky, nutty taste to it. Try it once and you'll love it.

Delicious and I am not a sprout fan. Friend's mother peels the layers of brussel sprouts instead of shredding/quartering (keeps vibrant green of spouts when cooked), cooks in bacon grease and garlic. Services with chopped bacon bits. I will never eat brussel sprouts covered with cheese again!

I loved these.  I used bacon grease, but I didn't have bacon or pine nuts.  I used margarine and white onions, because that's what I had on hand. This could only be made better by adding the nuts and bacon.  I ate almost the entire pan myself. Yum!

This recipe was delicious.  I did as others suggested and quartered the large Brussel sprouts and halved the smaller ones, instead of shredding them.  We even ate the leftovers cold, right out of the fridge.  Add pine nuts and Brussels sprouts at the same time.

These were alright, some reason they were bland though. We had to add a lot of salt, and it still tasted like something was missing.

Just made this recipe and had to review!  All my life I have hated Brussel Sprouts.  On a whim I decided to give them another try and stumbled upon this recipe.  Oh my goodness!!  These are delicious.  I only made 1/3 of the recipe because I didn't have enough Sprouts.  I used my mandolin to shave the Sprouts which resulted in very uniform very precise cuts (and wasn't too messy).  My only complaint with this recipe was the greasiness.  I think in the future I would try cutting back on the amount of "oils" I used.  So yummy!!  Must try.

I made these for Thanksgiving and they went over great. I quartered instead of shredding and I substituted a cup of sunflower seeds since I forgot the pine nuts. Turned out great (didn't need the sunflower seeds though). My sister who hates brussels sprouts had seconds, I gave her a hard time because I had to coax her to even try them.

I fixed this for Thanksgiving at my house. It was a huge hit.  I didn't shred them, though I quartered them. I used walnuts instead of pine nuts only because I forgot to add pine nuts to my last minute grocery list.  Wonderful recipe.  Thanks!!

Wow!  I've always like Brussels Sprouts, and this is just one more awesome way to serve them.  The fact that almost anyone who doesn't usually like sprouts will eat them too is a huge plus.  This has become my standard 'side dish' to bring to large gatherings.  The only downside is there's never any leftover for me to take home!  :)

People who do not normally like brussel sprouts love this dish when I cook it.  Most complain of the bitterness of the sprout.  So when I shred mine, I leave out the core.  I would recommend this to anyone who is looking to try something new to add this vegetable their menu.

I've grown to like brussels sprouts over the years, but THIS is my new favourite recipe!  I only cooked them for about three minutes... the sprouts were still nice and crisp-tender.  They were so, SO good, and this is so easy to make.  Definitely making this again. And often!

I recently got married and there are 5 children between us. My husbands children have issues with anything green.  I made this dish for Thanksgiving, and everyone out of 16 people who were at dinner loved them.  This recipe is going to be a new Thanksgiving tradition.  Thank you for sharing this with all of us at allrecipes!

Ok, let me just say that I am a HATER of brussels sprouts. But I found this recipe and decided to make it for members of my family who love them, for thanksgiving dinner. As I was making them I was intrigued by the smell, and then decided to taste them at dinner. WOW! is all I can say! These are so tasty and dont even taste bitter or like brussels sprouts normally do. I used fresh baby brussels sprouts and instead of shredding them I halved them. Other then that I followed the rest of the recipe exactly as it stated. Tremendously good and this is coming from a former brussels sprouts hater!

I made this recipe for thanksgiving and everyone loved it!.  I was supposed to make the recipe for 15 people but because I didn't think it was going to be a hit, I only made it for 8 and boy what a mistake it was!....by the time it made it to the end of the table only a few pine nuts were left!  Will definitely make again....very nutty flavor.

I never would have thought brussels sprouts could be so yummy - I guess bacon makes everything tasty!  My husband and I both enjoyed this and I look forward to keeping it in my repertoire.

Shredding the brussel sprouts was a lot of work! Seemed like a good compromise between those who love and those who hate brussel sprouts, but as often the case with compromises, no one was especially enthusiastic.

Made this for Thanksgiving and the people that don't even like brussel sprouts had seconds.  I quartered rather large sprouts which necessitated my having to add some chicken broth so they would cook tender done.  Next time I will half the recipe and cut the sprouts into sixths instead of quarters.  Well worth the time and effort.  I had no probem with them being greasy.  Probably due to the addition of the broth.

Very good! I quartered instead of shredding & didn't bother coring them. Takes longer to cook that way. Probably try shredding next time. Leftovers the next day were great.

I am a brussel sprouts fan.  My husband does not like them at all.  His daughter had never had them.  I made this tonight and we all liked it a lot.  It didn't hide the taste of the sprouts for me; he thought it tasted like broccoli (which he does like); and his daughter thought it was very good too.  Thank you for the recipe!

This was really good. My husband liked it and he does not like Brussel sprouts. I had never before eaten or cooked them so it was very favorable for a first try. I used turkey bacon instead of pork and I did not have the pine nuts. I think adding them would have made it even better. Now I can't wait to try more Brussel sprout recipes! Thanks!

Yum, Yum!  We loved this recipe.

I modified some of the ingredients to what I had on hand--4 slices of bacon instead of 1/2 lb., 1 leek instead of green onions, sea salt instead of seasoning salt, 1 TBSP of thyme instead of pepper.    I did not cut the cores out of the sprouts, only the end.  I put the sprouts and leeks in the food processor to save time.

This was a breeze to prepare, yummy tasting and good for you.  We are refrigerating the leftovers and adding chopped cheese for a quick lunch.  Yum, Yum!

A unique way to cook up brussel sprouts! Eat 'em while they're hot because, it's just not quite the same the next day. If you expect leftovers (and you should because this recipe makes quite a lot), set that amount aside and don't add the bacon pieces until after you reheat them again.

Most people liked it at our Thanksgiving dinner, but it was kind of greasy.  I actually prefer brussels sprouts chopped in half and simmered in chicken broth- I'll probably just make them that way next time.  Some people thought the bacon tasted funny with the brussels sprouts.  I expected it to be so delicious, but was disappointed.

This is a delicious recipe. I made it for guests last night, and they raved about it...even the ones who don't normally like brussels sprouts!

This was a hit with my parents. It was a first-time brussel sprouts experience for me and it was pretty good.  I cut the pine nuts to 1/2 cup...next time I will limit them to 1/4 cup. Overall, glad we tried it.

Good flavor, but the grease kind of overpowered the dish.

Very good taste, but a pain to make. I like it but probably would not make it again because of all the work.

I made this according to the directions and although it tasted good, it was very unappealing to look at.  The kids didn't eat it(no surprise) and my husband thought it was ok. Probably won't make this again.
