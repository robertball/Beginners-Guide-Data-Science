I added Feta instead of tofu and loved it!  I can't wait for my garden to get going and use this all summer!  Great recipe to take for family picnics!

Fresh and different!  My husband loves this!  I didn't have kidney beans so I drained the ranch style beans that I had in the pantry and used them.  I ate mine over a bowl of romaine and made it a healthy lowfat meal while my family had sloppy joes with this as a side!!

Great, simple and very filling alternative to a standard salad. I used plain balsamic vinegar as opposed to the vinaigrette and still thought it was great. The tastes are very complementary.

We liked this alot.  I used feta like many others have done and left out kidney beans because I didn't think they would add much.  I tried a small bit with Balsimic Vinegarette but didn't like it so I used greek salad dressing.  The greek dressing went great with the feta.

This was a very good salad for a light summer meal.  I didn't have tofu so I doubled the kidney beans.  I served this as a main course with home baked whole wheat bread.

Lets face it, this recipe like all salad recipes is very flexible, but this is a good basic dish.  Keep it cold.  Dressing seems to come up often in the other reviews.  Dressing is as you like it, if you want zip and pizazz... go to Zesty Italian, if you want it subtle and clean, go with the Greek. If you go with the original recipe the only thing that disappointed me was I chose a subtle balsamic and would have liked a little more pep.  I liked the Tofu and I liked the Kidney Beans, but understand if you want to go with Feta.  Thank you, a good clean starter, with room to move

Was OK.  I think the advice about letting the salad marinate is good.

Absolutely freakin fantastic!  I am NOT a tofu lover, by all means, only second try, first wasn't so hot.  This dish is fantastic!  Smooth, crunchy and a perfect dressing to boot!  I will definately make this more often.  I think it's best eaten right away, but also tried it a few hours later, the tomatoes were soggy, but otherwise even better flavour! Thanks!  I'm a tofu lover now!

Very good.  I'm not a gardener, but had homegrown tomatoes from a farmers' market and was eager to try this recipe.  Made the following subs based on what I had on hand:  feta instead of tofu, garbanzo beans instead of kidney, and dried basil instead of fresh.  Also, I THOUGHT I had balsamic vinaigrette, but when I went to the pantry, what I had was Ken's Steakhouse Lite Olive Oil Vinaigrette, so that is what I used.  I put the cut-up veggies, feta, and dressing (mixed with the basil) into separate containers and brown bagged.  Combined just before eating.  I wish I had drained the veggies before adding the dressing and cheese.  (Hindsight:  what a wonderful thing!!)  But, the result was still very good.  This recipe is a keeper.

This was so good...the beans and tofu make it a hearty salad.  I've made it twice now, and served it instead of rice or potatoes.

I found this receipe last year and when wanting to make it this year found that I had lost it.  I am really glad to see that is here again.  I really really like it especially on these hot days.  The basil gives it a very nice flavor.  Thank you for sharing it.

Very fresh tasting.  I had it without the vinagrette.  I think feta cheese would have tasted good with it.  Next time I wouldn't put any onions in it, the taste is too strong.

Very refreshing.  While I was cutting the basil, my husband walked into the kitchen and said it smelled like summer.
I subbed a 4oz block of feta for the tofu, and used greek dressing.  It was yummy.  My husband added some canned chicken to his, for more protein.   It would also be good without the beans.

Delicious! I didn't add the tofu but I would have liked that in this salad as well.  The only change I made was adding 1/2 cup of kidney beans and didn't add any salt.  I used Newman's Own Light Balsamic Vinaigrette for the dressing. Reliable and light recipe!

An easy salad to put together and quite good! I was hesitant about the kidney beans beings they aren't my favorite; they added a nice 'crunch' to the salad. Quite enjoyable. Didn't have tofu, so didn't use that and only had dried basil. Made the Balsamic Vinaigrette from this site to go with it. A nice complement!

Fantastic.  I used feta rather than tofu, and greek dressing as others suggested.  It was inexpensive, fast, and delicious.  Thanks for sharing.

I made this without the Toufu. It was very easy and very delicious. It is actually better on day two. Very economical and a great side dish for those summer days or when you're looking for a good cold side dish to break up from eating a warm side dish. Yum

Super easy to make - I used two cucumbers, four tomatoes, 1/2 red onion and instead of tofu, used herbed feta cheese. Drizzled Newman's Own Balsamic Vinaigrette over the top and tossed. I was unsure about the kidney beans but we tried it and was a hit! Might also try kalamata olives next time for a more Greek-style salad with the feta.

We enjoyed this a lot.  It was light, but also addictive!  The only changes I made were to use a Greek vinaigrette and a whole can of beans drained and rinsed because I didn't want to waste them.  Thanks for the recipe.

Really nice fresh summer salad. There should be a link to the vinaigrette recipe on this website. Didn't have fresh basil unfortunately but still very good. Remember to season well with salt & pepper as there's a lot of water in the cucumber.

This was really great, I left out the kidney beans and basil because my family doesn't like them and I didn't have any tofu but it came out just wonderful, my 3 year old daughter and I kept going back and picking at it after dinner. Next time I will try it with the tofu. Thanks Tigrgrrl!

This was very good. Very refreshing and just tastes like summer with home grown veggies and basil. I used the feta and red onion and a red wine vinegar dressing. Am anxious to try the Absolutely Fabulous Greek House dressing on it. I think that will be fabulous!

This was a good salad, although I omitted the tofu. I made it with 4 small tomatoes, cut off the tops and scooped out the seeds, and filled the cups with the salad mixture.  The filled tomatoes  looked nice with a fresh basil leaf tucked in at the top.  (For 4 tomato cups, I made about half the recipe, and still had some salad ingredients leftover.)

Love all these ingredients separately but for some reason this recipe was just OK.

I made this salad according to the actual directions. It was refreshing and light!  However, when I make it again I will delete the kidney beans!

Perfect light summer salad, using garden produce!  I used Feta, not Tofu.

This was a simple yet delicious salad.  Due to ingredients available in the fridge, I used feta instead of tofu, black beans instead of kidney beans, and cilantro instead of basil.  The only mild negative would be that it doesn't need so much dressing, but that is obviously a personal preference and easily correctable.

This was great and super easy.  The first time I made it, I didn't have tofu or feta like others subbed in, so I put in cheddar.  It was really good.  But I made it again with the tofu and that was super good.

I added Greek dressing, feta, and kalamata olives to give it a Greek flavor. We had ripe avacado so I threw that in too. Everyone in the family loved it.

Great quick and light salad.  I basically made it like a caprese by adding fresh mozzarella.  I didn't use the kidney beans or tofu.  It was delicious, light and refreshing. It also tastes even better the next day when the flavors have really had a chance to marinate and meld over night.

Took the lazy way out and used a container of grape tomatoes, cut them in half, also used an English cucumber (love the flavor and you don't have to take the seeds out).  Did what other people had suggested and used Feta cheese instead of tofu and also used chick peas instead of kidney beans. For dressing used Italian dressing, it was delicious and even better the next day, would definitely make this again...thanks.

I substituted more beans for the tofu. Seeded a jalapeño and added some fresh cilantro from the garden the second time I made it. Very fresh and easy.

Very good. I substituted mozzarella cheese for the tofu since I did not have any tofu on site. Made my own balsamic vinaigrette. Since I did not have fresh basil today I used dried.

So simple and yet so yummie. My fiance isn't a fan of vegetables, especially tomatoes... 
I made it the night before and let it marinade overnight in the fridge. He took it to work for lunch along with some baked chicken and he absolutely loved it! Said it was like a tease cause he wanted more..lol. Brownie points for me and a healthy choice for him :)

Fantastic salad.   I followed it as written, including the tofu, but I did add in some shredded Parmesan as well.   I made my own balsamic vinaigrette using infused oils and balsamic vinegar and salt.   I will definitely be making this again.
