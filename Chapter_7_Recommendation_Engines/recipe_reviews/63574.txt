After reading all the reviews I made a few changes.  First was adding more cloves of garlic.  Next I substituted the fat free soup for the regular version.  Instead of using the uncooked noodles, I could them a little less than al-dente and baked it for less time, approx. 20 minutes.  I know it's less "cassorole like" that way, but it came out pretty good.  I also used fresh cracked pepper instead of regular!

I'm always wary when a recipe calls for uncooked noodles.  This recipe definitely needs pre-cooked noodles or you'll end up with a crunchy layer of dry noodles on the top of your casserole.  Very spinach-y tasting which can be good or bad, depending on how much you like spinach.

It had too much spinach for us.  I don't think I'll make this again.

After reading the reviews, I added extra milk (for dryness), cheese, and fresh ground nutmeg (for flavor).  I also stirred halfway thru to keep the top layer of pasta from being hard.  Worked fine.  Decent quick meal.

if you want the noodles fully cooked and not crunchy, cook a little ahead of time.

This is something I don't plan on making again.  The noodles should have been precooked, and there needed to be more spices or something, a very bland meal that my family did not enjoy.

Not sure if the recipe has been updated since some of the other reviews were written, but this was neither bland nor dry for me. Tasty, easy meal, but not beautiful. Per the reviews, I cooked the noodles  slightly (not completely al dente). This seemed to work out well.

very easy to make and my family loved it.  For the adults, it is even better with some hot sauce on top.  a good way to sneak  in some vegetables.

I really enjoyed the texture of this recipe.  It was a little bland, but I added some garlic powder and it helped a lot.  Maybe if you could incorperate some cheese inside the casserole, it would really help to add some flavor.

This was just a really bland tasting recipe.  It really needed something to spice it up.

I took this to a big dinner thing and all the guys loved this dish.  It didn't get as high of a review the gals, though.

Tasteless.  Needed to add lot of salt.
