We really liked this coleslaw.   The bitter was just enough to offset the sweet.   The only thing I would change would be to cut the amount of sauce in half.   It was too much sauce for that much slaw.

The recipe's name is correct, but the horseradish helps balance out the sweetness. I didn't use coleslaw mix, just shredded the cabbage and carrots in the food processor, and used "light" salad dressing and Splenda for the sugar.  I liked it, probably would cut back a little on the sugar/Splenda next time, but wouldn't hesitate to make again.  Thanks, Rick, for sharing your recipe.

My spouse and I love this, one slaw we can agree on. I add a little fresh ground pepper and orange zest.

Cooking for a diabetic, and even the non-diabetics in the family thought this was way too sweet. Cut the sweet to 1 scant tablespoon of "Sola" brand sweetener, and it was perfect. Also skipped the poppy seeds (none on hand) and chopped the (purple and green) cabbage and one large carrot in my processor instead of buying the more expensive pre-chopped. . With those modifications, I will make this many times again. Thanks for posting the recipe

Too sweet! Next time I would use only 1/4 cup of sugar and maybe even less.

Skipped the poppy seeds (none on hand), used spicy mustard instead of horseradish. Good stuff!

I love coleslaw and this recipe stood out to me because if it's simplicity I did however omit 2 ingredients (horeseradidsh & poppy seeds) not a fan!
|I also use less sugar instead I added a snack size apple sauce puree and some diced apples for  texture.
Everything else stayed the same. 
I love it, my family loves it in face I've made it several times but just posting  a review now ---better late than never. 
What prompted me to post was my 8 year old daughters' reaction when I told her I was making my favourite coleslaw salad and she jumped up for joy.... ENJOY :)

Excellent recipe...loved the horseradish!!!! i did substitute celery seed for the poppy seeds because my memories from my mom's coleslaw always contained them.

I originally made this to top pulled pork sandwiches and have made it at least 5 times since. This is delicious and I've never even been a fan of coleslaw. I'd eat it this plain! I omit the horseradish on account of the kids don't like it but they loved this, otherwise. Thank you very much for sharing!

I leave out the horseradish and use 1/3 cup Miracle Whip and 1/3 cup Real Mayonnaise.

We serve this cole slaw often. The horseradish gives the slaw an unexpected kick. We prefer it a little less sweet so I only use 1/2 the sugar. Excellent recipe....better than deli slaw

Really good!!  I added a dash of milk, and used olive oil instead. The horseradish was the key ingredient!!

My family thought this was very good, although sweet. I added lemon juice to kill the sweetness. Next time I'll adjust the sugar as I make it, so it's not as sweet. Served this with crab cakes and homemade french fries.
