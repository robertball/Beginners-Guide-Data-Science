I've made this several times now.

It's delicious as-is, using an apple rather than apple sauce.

It's also good with turnips and/or winter squash.

It's better with a little tarragon or savory, depending on what is in the main dish.

The flavor of the maple and cider didn’t come through very well, and the cayenne was too strong.

This was just “ok” for us. It lacked flavor and turned out to be a bit dry. Next time, I might double the wet ingredients and add some seasonings. The parsnips helped quite a lot in adding flavor, but it needs something else to make it extra tasty.

TERRIBLE! Did All Recipe cooks even try this? Dry, stringy, tough, and way too much apple cider vinegar.  Threw it away and opened a can of green beans. BAH
