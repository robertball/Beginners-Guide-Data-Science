I figured I'd better make an addendum to this recipe seeing as how they edited out a few important details. Make sure your tomatoes are very firm, not quite fully ripened. The baking will cause really ripe tomatoes to just fall apart.  Also, if you can stand it, make these up, cool them and refidgerate overnight. These are even better warmed up.

Wow, I'm impressed!  I was so tempted to add extra seasoning and I'm so glad I didn't.  The shrimp cooked perfectly, the flavor was awesome.  I used vine-ripe homegrown tomatoes so I was concerned they might fall apart, but my fears were unfounded.  This is definitely a keeper!  Subbed red bell pepper for green.

Pretty tasty.  I messed up by not reading the "cooked rice" part, so I had to cook some rice & it pushed the meal back a great deal of time.

The end result was super tender, but a little soupy inside.  I'd recommend not adding the juice from the tomatoes, just the chunks.  Or maybe setting them upside-down on a rack to drain some additional juices.

Solid flavor, no matter how wet it was :)
