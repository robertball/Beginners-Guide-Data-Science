Can I give this 10 stars?!?  

My son LOVES donuts and I promised him donuts for breakfast this morning...however, we awoke to a terrible rainstorm and I didn't want to drive 11 miles to the closest donut shop.  I found this recipe and was apprehensive because we are donut snobs and the thought of heavy 'biscuit' donuts just didn't appeal to me, however, I thought I would give it a try.  I found that I only had "Reduced Fat Flaky Layers" type of biscuits so I was worried, but OH MY LORD...they were absolutely wonderful!  They puffed up beautifully and were light and airy inside and crispy on the outside.  They were amazing!  My sons eyes lit up when he took the first bite and the magic words came from him mouth...'Mom, these are the best donuts I have ever tasted"...ahhhhh success!!!  I made vanilla and chocolate glazes and they were great and also did a few with cinnamon sugar...YUMMMMM.  I melted a chocolate truffle and added it to the chocolate glazeâ€¦that shot the taste into outerspace!  My son can't wait me for me to make these again, but my husband has begged me not to ever make them again...because he ate 3 of them!!  I hit it out of the park on this one!

My grandma used to make doughnuts like this too.  I love them.  She made a glaze of confectioner's sugar and milk and pour over them - YUMMY.

Not to get all TMI on everyone, but when it's "that time of the month" I crave apple pie like nobody's business!  So I make these donuts, using a baster to add apple pie filling to the center instead of cutting a hole in the middle.  While they're draining, I sprinkle generously with cinnamon and sugar.  The result is Apple Pie Donut Heaven.

I learned this way of cooking donughts in middle school in 1963.  You do not need that much oil.  Just enough to put about 1/2 to 1 inche in a frying pan.  Turn them half-way through.  We used cinnamon and sugar combined in a paper bag and tossed them to coat.  The biscuits will float when they are cooked through.

The whole family (and our neighbors!) loved these. We put the powdered sugar in a sifter and let the kids "snow" the doughnuts. We also had a bowl of holiday-colored regular sugar and cinnamon to dip them in too. Great with milk! I know this wil be a special request from my daughter for years to come! Thanks for sharing!

I have been making these doughnuts for years, and it really doesn't get any better for a fast, good breakfast treat (or anytime treat) that everyone likes.  Try adding cinnamon to the powdered sugar, or even a little nutmeg too for an old fashioned taste.  Just remember to make plenty..they are addictive.

These were quick, easy, and yummy!  I can whip up 6 doughnuts (and doughnut holes!) in no time!  :-)  I love them with chocolate glaze; my kids liked them better with powder sugar.  A keeper!

My mom used to make these and I have made them just like this a few times.  They're fine but they always still have that refrigerator biscuit flavor.  that is the reason for the 3 stars.  A doughnut made from a real raised doughnut dough doesn't have that slightly weird flavor and would earn 4 or 5 stars.  Frying canned biscuit dough really isn't a recipe so much as it's a technique.  The recipe part happened at the factory that made the biscuits.

Why is this considered a 'recipe'??  Open up a can & fry isn't a recipe.  There is nothing new here which is noted by the sheer number of people posting they've made these for years.  I learned to do this in 7th grade Home Ec class 45 years ago.  They aren't very good either. Not even when baked at biscuits!  I was looking for a good old fashioned Grandma recipe I'd be proud to serve.  This certainly isn't it.  I'm very disappointed that it's even been allowed to be posted.

I have made these by just punching a finger through the middle to make the hole and frying them in1 1/2 - 2 inches of oil.Covered with cinnamon and sugar they taste great as long as you eat them hot, but after they cool they taste more like fried biscuits instead of like doughnuts.

This is absoutely amazing! I had no idea that you could do this! I also tried using cinnamon roll dough. They came out really well, and we used the icing in the package on top. You have to try using crescent roll dough! You just fry it unrolled, and it tastes like an elephant ear! Just make sure your oil isn't too hot. They fry rather quickly. This was by far my favorite! My 3 year old loved decorating these. We did powdered sugar, chocolate (I used the chocolate ganache recipe on this site) and a sugar glaze made with powdered sugar and milk. I will be making these again on Christmas morning for sure!

These are "emergency" treats. Got unexpected company at 10 am or pm? Make these. Kids need an after school snack? Ditto. I gave these to the men who installed our gutters on a freezing March morning and they begged for the recipe. I use lemon juice to make powdered sugar into a glaze that friends dubbed "Lemon Lorraine". These are fun quick treats but eat them up fast because once they cool completely they get hard as hockey pucks. Are they gourmet fare? - no! Do most people ask for more? - absolutely. I always keep a can on hand for emergencies. We all need a selection of fast, easy recipes for days when we lack the time, energy or appliances to cook up some "real food".

I have used this method for years and it works well and they are good.  BUT...2 quarts of oil for a package of canned biscuits is a bit much.  You can just put a couple of cups in a frying pan and do the same thing.

My mom used to make these all the time when I was growing up...usually as a late night snack.  I found this recipe on here and was so excited...I only changed one thing.  Instead of rolling the doughnuts in the sugar I made it into a glaze by adding water to it and putting the glaze on it.  Delicious.  Thanks so much for a great memory.

I have made for many years and always put the powdered sugar in a paper bag or baggie and dropped "doughnuts" in and shake for even coverage. Have also made with my own biscuit dough which I sweetened slightly. I also mixed powdered sugar with a little milk and drizzled over the doughnuts while warm.  My 5 children loved them and now grandchildren and grt grandchildren.

Why did I ever buy bakery doughnuts? These are amazing - and almost a dozen (including holes) for less than $1.50! I use a medium-sized saucepan so I can get more of a "deep-fry" effect without using as much oil. It takes a little longer but it saves on oil. Cinnamon sugar rocks!

Made these treats for breakfast before church today.  Our 10 & 13 yr. old granddaughters are with us for the week & they loved these doughnuts.  I sprinkled some with powdered sugar, cinnamon & sugar & also dipped some in a vanilla glaze.  Nice to be a Nonna still learnng new tricks to impress my bambinos.   This is a keeper...thanks Tiffany!!!

Love this recipe!  We used a really cheap brand of some butter flavor Texas biscuits.  The doughnuts turned out really amazing.  We whipped up a glaze and dipped the doughnuts in it after they cooled for about a minute or two.  Talk about melt-in-your-mouth.....  Oh my goodness!

We made these back oh 50 years ago, we would do different sugars, powder and granulated and lightly shake them in a brown paper sack.  We used a washed ketchup lid as the perfect hole.(back then) What a decadent treat these are.

Very good! Easy, and delicious. Make sure to even them out, flatten them a bit, otherwise they will be raw in the middle! Trust me :) lol. Oh and if you put powdered sugar on them, wait until they cool first, otherwise the sugar gets moist and doesn't stay powdery.

Easy peasy doughnuts! The only problem with this is that the biscuits have that particular  taste that a certain brand of buscuits have. Maybe it's me that tastes that bit of bitterness in the biscuits.

My kid engulfed the doughnut holes, & my neigbor thought they were awesome. I used sugar & cinnamon since I'm not a fan of powdered sugar  doughnuts. 

You have to watch them carefully because if they turn dark brown the taste wasn't very good.

Really easy for a quick fix when your family wants something sweet!.. I found that the outside cooked fast and inside was raw so I had to turn my temp. down to med/low heat.  I just placed them on some paper towels a few minutes to drain;I made a maple glaze and dipped while warm.   They were as good as a donut shop (hubby says).. :)

I've been making this years too.  Just want to mention that our families favorite way to make them is to fry, let them drain on a paper towel lined plate & then shake them in a small paper bag with plain white sugar.  You can use a brown paper bag like you can buy for making lunches or what I LOVE to use is the left over sugar bag.  It is a bit thicker.  And why not repurpose the sugar bag if you can?!  Hey, I like being green when I can.  ;)

Really very good, much better than I thought it might be. I would rate the taste a 4, but the easiness of the recipe makes it a 5. A couple tips: I made two batches. The first batch I used a small tube of bicuits and the second time a big tube - like grands size - to make regular sized doughnuts. The small biscuits work MUCH BETTER than the big ones. The glaze that I put on them really balanced the biscuit taste so that it tasted much more like a doughnut than the second batch, which had a way too high dough-to-glaze ratio. Also, the big ones were doughy unless fried for a much longer time, and tasted a little too done for my liking by the time the insides were done.

This was wonderful. I messed up though, i didnt realize that i bought the buttery donuts, and it gave it a salty taste. But i did it again the next day with regular buttermilk biscuits, and mmmmmm, yummy, i did half powdered and the other cinnamon sugar...

I made these with cinnamon sugar instead of confectioners sugar.  I have a 50/50 success rate.  I've been trying to find the balance between not too done on the outside and not doughy on the inside.  It seems like if I make these to my preferred brownness on the outside, they are doughy on the inside.  If they are done on the inside, then they are too brown on the outside.  I'm sure it has something to do with the temperature of my oil, but I just can't seem to get it right.

Good and simple.  Keep an eye on your oil temp, otherwise you end up with a beautifully browned donut with a doughy center!

Love love love this recipe. So easy! I couldn't of even gone to the doughnut shop that quick and they tasted better. I made a glaze out of powder sugar and did some with Cinnamon and sugar. Then shook the holes in a paper bag with powder sugar. YUM

Hubby has been making these for many, many years. I was skeptical at first, but that leaves when you taste them. 
 We just cut the biscuits into fourths (in half, then each half in half), making donut holes.  We've tried them with the powdered sugar, and a mix of granulated and cinnamon. It's all good! So quick and so easy... in fact, we keep biscuits around just for this snack attack now.

I used to make these for my kids when they were little. It was always a favorite. I didn't have a deep fryer so I just put some oil in a skillet. We would roll ours in a sugar, cinnamon mixture. These taste best when warm.

I HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR YEARS. I FIND IT EASIER TO LET THE DOUGH GET SLIGHTLY WARM THEN FLOUR YOUR COUNTER TOP OR BOARD LITELY. PAT EACH BISCUIT OUT A LITTLE AND CUT THE CENTER OUT. DROP IN OIL AND FRY TILL LITE BROWN. I TAKE THEM OUT OF THE OIL AND DROP THEM INTO A MIXTURE OF SUGAR,CINNEMON AND BROWN SUGAR IN A PAPER BAG,SHAKE THEM AROUND AND THEN PUT ON A PLATE TO SERVE. MY FAMILY LIKE THIS BETTER THAN THE POWDERED SUGAR. YOU CAN ALSO USE SPLENDA BROWN SUGAR ON THEM INSTEAD FOR THE DIABETICS OUT THERE.

I have made douhnuts like this many years ago and learned from an aunt that you do not need to make "holes" just punch a hole in the center with your thumb and stretch it out to make perfect doughnuts. I had forgotten about this recipe so thanks for bringing it back to me.  I will be sure to try them with the flakey biscuts also.

Used to make these when my sons (now in their 30's) were young and would come in from skating, playing in the snow with all their friends.  They are good, quick and easy.  I used to make them, fill zip lock bags with confectioner's sugar and another with cinnamon and sugar and let them shake their own. They are not as wonderful as homemade, but still very good.

Easy and delicious!  My dad was sceptical, thinking they'd just taste like biscuits, but they really tasted like doughnuts!  SO GOOD!  Next time, I think I'll try it with a glaze, but powdered sugar was quick, easy, and yummy.

I was suprised of how great these donuts taste.  So easy and a lot of fun to decorate.  You can be quite creative with icing flavors, fillings and shapes.  The texture of the donuts resemble beignets to me.   When I tasted one with powdered sugar, I thought I was in New Orleans at Cafe Du Monde.  I can't wait for my 6 year old niece come for a visit.  She loves donuts.  I will be the best aunt in the world in her eyes.

A guilty, guilty pleasure. I prefer mine with cinnamon sugar rather than powdered sugar though. No, it doesn't taste exactly like a real bakery doughnut, but it does taste GOOD!

I made these last night, and they were amazing! My boyfriend came home from work and asked, "where did you get those fluffy doughnuts?" When I told him I made them, he didn't believe me. I made some with powdered sugar, cinnamon sugar and some with a chocolate peanut butter frosting. He ended up eating five doughnuts by himself! These are an amazing quick fix when you're craving something sweet. Thanks for the easy amazing recipe.

Very good.  Make one at a time in small pot.  Check temp. and make sure it is 375 and not hotter or outside of donuts cook too fast before inside is cooked.  Cover with chocolate frosting (heat in microwave 15 secs. to thin)

These were so easy and very professional looking due to a variety of glazes and toppings: chocolate glaze with chopped peanuts, coconut, or sprinkles, etc. However, they really need to be eaten right away! The ones that made it to the next day looked awful and tasted terrible.

I'm one of those grandmas now, but when my children were growing up my mother taught me how to make these and even now have been told by my grown nephews and nieces one of their fondest memories when they stayed overnight at my house we sometimes had these for breakfast. Thanks for the memory!!

I have been making donuts like this for years. The kids and I make an event of it, I fry them up and they get to glaze and decorate them. We also always fry up the centers that we cut out and make donut holes. Delicious, fun and quick!

I love this simple recipe and the doughnuts taste great! I have also done these with raspberry filling and then done the powdered sugar on top. Pair with a great cup of coffee and you have a great start to your morning!

This one get's 5 stars for the memories alone. Like another reviewer stated, I thought this recipe was my mom's secret, lol. 

We have some wonderful, family recipes that have been passed down by my Swedish great-grandma but this simple, quick snack that was introduced by my mother when we were kids and continued by myself with my kids and grandchildren is very special. My daughter has made them on occassion as well.

 Nothing fancy but is such a memorable experience for children that make's them feel like top bakery chefs :)

My mother showed me how to make these when I was a little girl....she would make a glaze of confectioners sugar and evap. milk...really good hot and with a cold glass of milk! 
note...even the cheapest brand of canned biscuits will work....I don't cut holes..I just pull a hole in the middle by stretching the dough a little..maybe not as pretty but still looks like a doughnut!

I made these many years ago when my adult children were little. The easy way instead of cutting a hole in the middle is to poke my clean finger through the center of the purchased can biscuits and whirl it around my finger. The fun of this is to let the children do it then when you have cooked the donuts I let the children shake them in a bag with either powederd sugar or cinnamon and sugar or just plain sugar. Kids had a great time and I had fun just watching them. They have passed this on to their own children.

I've been making these doughnuts for years for camping trips. I use the inexpensive, thinner canned biscuits and just tear a hole in the center. My Dad used to make a sugar glaze for his that was good, but for camping we just drain them and sprinkle - or douse - them with confectioners sugar. There are perfect for camping.

These are a fun tasty treat, but I have to give it 3 stars because it's not a real recipe. I have found the same directions in a family magazine along with craft ideas. these are not really doughnuts just deep fried biscuits. Albeit tasty.

In N Carolina they call these "puffs" and serve them with a drizzle of honey instead of sugar. Restaurants bill them as Puffs and Honey. They certainly are not doughnuts but they are delicious.

I made this doughnuts, and they came out great. I made a few changes: Instead of using confectioner's sugar, I made a cinnamon sugar instead.

they looked nicer than they tasted. No matter what topping is put on them, they are still just a glorified biscuit.

This was easy and delicious.  I used a tall shot glass to make the doughnut holes.  I may try stuffing them with a baster using pudding next time.

We really liked these!  The only problem we had was that when I fried them they did not cook all the way through (don't have a deep fryer so I think the oil I heated in a pan on the stove may have been too hot) so we had to bake them in the oven for 10 minutes.  Other than though, they tasted great and we will be making these again!  As a tip, I used the glaze from the "Crispy and Creamy Doughnuts" recipe on this site and it was awesome.  Thanks for the recipe!

I've been making these since I learned how to make them at Vacation Bible School. Not only do I love these for the memories that come back when I eat them, but now my kids love to make them and eat them, too. Very fun!

What a delicious, easy treat! I used large buttermilk biscuits, and the cap off a soda bottle to make the holes. They really puff up nice and big! Just be careful not to over-cook them, they will taste greasy. Besides dipping cinnamon-sugar and powdered sugars, I dipped some in "dipping chocolate", let it sit in the fridge till it hardened, and man, was that good! I'm making some again this weekend!

My Mom made these when I was a child and I have made them for my kids.

She would use the cap off the vanilla bottle to make the holes.

We would shake some in cinnamon and sugar or powdered sugar or frost with white or chocolate frosting and then sprinkle with nuts or coconut or sprinkles.

It was great making the doughnuts with my Mom and will always be a treasured memory.

This is exactly what I was looking for! Perfect with cinnamon & sugar. Without a topping/coating, they taste like a fried biscuit. But with the cinnamon & sugar they taste just like cider mill dougnuts - very pleasantly surprised. I'll never make doughnuts from scratch again!!

These are delicious!  They are also great with a glaze - just mix powdered sugar with a little bit of milk and glaze each donut.  I've also just rolled them in a cinnamon sugar mixture.

These are great! I liked the Pillsbury buttermilk biscuits the best, rather than the cheaper brand flaky style. I rolled some in cinnamon and sugar while still hot and some I frosted with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze recipe after they cooled. Try the frosted with a sprinkle of coconut. Yum!

There were really good! It was my first time making doughnuts at home and they taste fantastic! We did the doughnut holes for our daughter. I was a little nervous because I haven't fried much and I've never done doughnuts. That's part of the reason I went with this recipe. I didn't want to do a ton of work just to have the recipe flop. Plus, I'm a mom...having staple recipes of quick and easy favorites is a must! We heated the oil over high in our wok. I cut the holes out and put the doughnuts in the oil 2-3 at a time. My husband monitored/flipped them. When they came out, I rolled/sprinked them with powdered sugar while he worked on the next batch. We did doughnut holes last. VERY tasty. Might try them with a glaze next time, but we will definitely be making these again. I will say, though, that it was helpful having someone else who could monitor another batch while I rolled the still hot doughnuts in sugar. Do-able for one person, but easier with two, I think.

Fantastic recipe, thanks for sharing.  I never keep packaged biscuit dough because I like to make them from scratch using the "Kentucky Biscuit" recipe also found on Allrecipes.  Oh my, what a fantastic combination of two recipes, these donuts just melted in my mouth!  I'll have to exercise more thanks to you two!  =)

Delicious!  I would lower the temperature to 325-350, because mine were overdone on the outside and underdone inside.  If you don't cut a hole in the doughnuts, try cutting the biscuit dough in half to reduce the thickness (came out PERFECT every time that way).

I have made these before but I roll the biscuit out and place a marshmallow on top and fold the biscuit over. Pinch sides to seal. They are soooooo gooood!!!!! Just as the others have mentioned, make sure the oil is not too hot. They will brown on the outside and doughy on the inside.

These are good for what they are, but a fried can of biscuits will never be as delicious as a real donut...

Tastes more like Italian Zepoles which we happen to like.  Be sure to cook it until golden brown then really drench it in powdered sugar for full effect.

In our cafe we used to roll the biscuit to a round shape and then deep fry.  While still hot shake them in a paper bag with sugar and cinnamon.  For some reason we found that the cheaper brands worked better for this application.

GREAT! We've made them this way since we were kids. I'm sure they have easier ways, but we always used a (clean) medicine bottle to make the doughnut holes & fry them up also. If you like a little frosting/icing on the doughnut, we like to mix a small batch of conf. sugar, evap. milk & vanilla to dip the doughnut & holes in...yummy, but fattening. :)

My mom used to make these when we were growing up, and now I make them too (not very often, though)...they are GREAT! I don't always roll the doughnuts in the powdered sugar, sometimes in cinnamon sugar, or sometimes I'll make a chocolate or vanilla glaze and top w/ sprinkles. Don't forget to fry the doughnut holes too! These really are super easy and a lot of fun to make! :)

My Nana would melt a T of butter and mix with a half cup of confectioner's sugar, stirring in a tsp of water at a time until a perfect glaze formed for the doughnuts.  Thank you for posting this!  Brings back memories.

I used to make these when my children were young. But we would stretch the biscuit into a rectangle and fry. Then we put already made cream cheese frosting on them. They were kind of like the longs johns you get in the bakery. Very yummy

This reminds me of years ago when we use to take a can of bisquits, cut a hole out (I think they liked the donut hole better than the rest of the bisquit) deep fry them. We made all kinds of frostings to top them with. Our kids enjoyed getting in on the fixing. Such good times.

My mom always made donuts this way and I've continued with my kids.  They can be just as easily fried in a frying pan if you don't want to mess with your deep-fryer.  I gave them four instead of five stars only due to the high calorie/fat content, not taste...everyone loves them!

Wow, I thought my grandma was the only one who ever did this. Mine taught me this shortcut to making doughnuts when I was nine years old. I loved them!! We made them almost every weekend. When I got this recipe in my email it brought back so many memories. Thank you for sharing.

Made these this morning!  Easy and delicious!!!  I rolled half in powdered sugar, half in cinnamon sugar.  My only other comment, not really a negative, but the buttermilk biscuit dough is definitely not as sweet as a donut from an actual donut shop (cake donuts).  But, in a way them not being quite as sweet was a nice change, and my husband actually said he prefers these to those from a donut shop.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, we really enjoyed it!!!

My dad used to make these for us growing up. Press the mouth of a water bottle into the middle of the biscut to make the holes, and throw them into the oil for some donut holes as well!  My dad would make these "Shake Your Donuts" as a treat whenever we had slumber parties.  He'd fry the donuts, put them into a tupperware container with cinnamon and sugar, and we would get to shake it to make our donut.  Tons of fun!!

I'd never made doughnuts before, so I couldn't believe how easy it was. I made these in a deep fryer and it took about 30 seconds to cook them two at a time.  Our favorite was just plain glazed, but we also made chocolate iced and powdered sugar ones. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because they weren't all that great unless you ate them right away.

Okay this was a late night sweet tooth episode my husband and I had and it was super dangerous because they are SO GOOD!!!! But, I do suggest 350 degrees because they brown up quick. Also, I made a chocolate glaze using milk chocolate and semi sweet chips with a little milk. Super yummy!! Oh the doughnut "holes" were delicious with cinnamon sugar. Thanks for the recipe.

These were great. I had to adjust the oil down a bit. The first batch of donuts came out a little over browned and doughy on the inside, but still tasty. With the second batch with the oil temperature adjusted, they came out great. I also tried making these with the honey butter biscuits and they came out with even more flavor than the buttermilk type. I used a lemon glaze glaze on the honey butter donuts that complimented the richer flavor. Thanks for the recipe.

Great idea!  I used the small buttermilk biscuits and fried at 325 degrees. I didn't bother to cut holls.   Rolled in powdered sugar and they were divine.

Maybe I used the wrong dough??? Pillsbury homestyle buttermilk biscuit dough. I could only find a 14 oz or a 7.5oz container. I bought the 14oz which worked fine for my donut cutter. The flavor wasn't good at all and my husband and son didn't even eat them up. They tasted like a fried biscuits and no real donut flavor. Any ideas what went wrong? Next time I will just make the dough as nobody cared for this at all!

5 stars for ease and speed, 3 stars for taste = 4 stars for a nice idea when you're short on time. I wouldn't serve these to company, but I'd make it for breakfast or snack for the kids. It took ALOT of powdered sugar to make it taste like anything but a fried biscuit. Still, they're all gone 10 minutes after I made them!

These were ok & good if you need something super fast. Tasted too biscuit-y to me. I like the dough of the doughnut. I will continue searching for a bakery like doughnut recipe.

Yup - these are good!  They still taste kinda like a biscuit, but if you put some glaze on them, they are just sweet enough.  I too used reduced fat, grand sized canned biscuits, and made some vanilla glaze.  Then I got creative and added chocolate syrup to part, and strawberry syrup to another part.  They all tasted yummy - my 4 yr. old raved!

These were great. Just like the doughnuts at the cider mill. Dipped in cinnamon sugar. These will burn very quickly. Fried at 300 degrees.

It has been 20 years since I have had these!  My mom used to make these on the weekends when I was really small.  Do not go into this expecting to turn out with bakery style doughnuts.  These are a breed of their own, and are very good in their own simple way.

My mom made this and taught me this trick; cut the center out with a bottle cap (they used to be made of metal and that works better, but a plastic bottle cap still works).  These are a very guilty pleasure, but if you don't have a heart attack and drop dead on the spot- you will want them again in a week or two.  They taste great within thirty minutes, then not so good.  The never have lasted 30 minutes in our house.  We drain them on brown paper bags and then throw them ( 2 at a time)into another paper bag filled with powdered sugar and shake. These should come with a warning label.  They are good though!

This is a wonderful recipe, also passed on to me by my mother!  It is a favorite of my children, the whole youth group at my church and every young guest that ever spends any time with us.  We always use cinnamon sugar, but we have tried chocolate frosting and it is a wonderful gooey and messy treat!  Thanks for sharing.

These are pretty good.  Especially as they are fresh.  Very fun to decorate with the kids.  We used dipping chocolate, nuts, Easter sprinkles, coconut, powdered sugar and cinnamon & sugar.

This was my Mom's "recipe" too!  Except we use the regular Pillsbury biscuit cans that come in a four pack.  They're great!  When we have guests I make dozens of these and serve them with a buffet of toppings... confectioner's & regular sugar, but also a cinnamin/sugar mix, apple butter, a sugar glaze, icing, and whatever homemade jellies or jams I have around.  It's always a hit!  Plus the kids LOVE to flavor their own doughnut holes!  Oh yeah!  If you cut them in strips & twist them they flip on their own just like the holes do!

If i could give this recipe more stars i would! Lets start with the easiness factor. I decided to make donut holes so i just cut the biscuits in half and rolled the halves in to balls. Tossed them in to the frier and thats it. Now for the taste factor I warmed up some strawberry jam for dipping and my guests couldn't get enough. This is a quick, delicious and versatile recipe! I love it!!

I looked at this recipe and thought, "Biscuit dough? There's no way that tastes like doughnuts."

It tastes like doughnuts.

I am converted.

I've used refrigerator biscuits to make doughnuts for many years, but I don't use a deep fryer.  I use a  cast iron skillet with 1/2 inch oil. It works just fine.

These were amazing.  I didn't have buttermilk biscuit dough, used the country biscuit dough... and I can't imagine them any better !  I brushed melted butter on them, then rolled them in a sugar/cinnamon mixture.  I rolled the doughnut holes in powdered sugar.  Very easy, and you can do so many things with them.  I highly recommend them.

Ironically, my son's girlfriend mentioned making these with her grandmother the day before this recipe arrived in my e-mail.  Obviously, we were meant to make these.  They are so easy and even yummier than I expected.  Toss them in a bag with granulated sugar or sugar and cinnamon for an additional "yum" factor.

These are very tasty. I made them for a party and everyone just raved over them. I served them hot and made a "thing" about cooking them up in different shapes. I even stuffed some with my homemade strawberry preserves. That brouhg out the "ooh's" and "Ahh's". messy and gooey and delicious! I'm only giving four stars just because I am a big fan of yeast donuts. But, these are certainly in a class that is to be enjoyed.

tasted nothing like donuts. Too much like bread, and not enough "cake" taste. Tasted more like dumplings (even with the sugar coating/glazing).

AWESOME!
We used to make these in Girls Club. They are just as good if not better (because they are fresh & warm when you eat them) than getting them at the "doughnut shop".  These were always fun to make and dip them in powder sugar or cinnamon sugar. LOVE THEM   :)

I have made these for over 30  yrs.  It's so easy and I love the little donut holes too.  I use the powdered sugar but might try to make some glaze for them.  I have to be very careful when alone tho as I crave them and make them and eat them all myself.

I had almost forgotten this recipe. My mom used to make these for our family when I was very young. (Yes they had canned biscuits way back in the stone age.) (Before that she made them with Bisquick mix.) They are quick and easy and TASTY!!! Thanks to Tiffany for reminding me of this great memory.

I volunteer teaching an after schol cooking class at a local public charter school.  This looks like a very easy and inexpensive recipe.  I'm sure they will enjoy it as snack.  Not for breakfast though.

I learned this recipe while on a boyscout campout with my brother and the rest of the family. It's so easy to make even in the middle of the woods. We don't go on campouts anymore since he made eagle but making these doughnuts is now a christmas routine in our house. So easy and so yummy!!!

Another way to make them is using Pillsbury pizza dough just leave it rolled up and cut it using a string once cooked top it with your favorite glaze or topping. They are great!!

I used to make these for my kids and forgot about it. My kids use to love making them. I cut the biscuits in half and twist and pull, seal the ends together to make a small donuts.  In separate baggies I put powdered sugar, cinnamon and sugar, cocoa powder, and in a small bowl melted chocolate to dip in. I let the kids do it and we get a variety of flavors.  Good for a small snack and don't have to eat a "big" one. Thanks Tiffany for the refesher.

I have been making these for years. I also leave the biscuits whole and after frying I fill them with jelly or  custard or a white cream filling. Then for even more special donuts after filling I glaze them with either a white or chocolate glaze then put sprinkles on them . Yummy

Really good!  They do have the "biscuit" taste to them but when you add frosting and sprinkles you can't tell too much!  This was a hit with my kids!  Easy to make as well!

I made these doughnuts with my nieces who are 3 & 4 years old.  They helped by making the doughnut holes and decorated them. And I did the frying.  Everyone loved them.  The powdered sugar one tasted just like a beignet.  We topped the donuts with powder sugar, cinnamon sugar, chocolate and vanilla glaze.  This was such an easy recipe.  Great for kids too!!

Delightful and easy!  My family was impressed.  :)  We dipped some in cinnamon/sugar and the rest in a powdered sugar/milk glaze.  Not sure which was the best, but both were scrumptious!!

Oh, I had forgotten about these.  My mother made them for us, I made them for my children, now I am making them for my grandchildren.  My only difference is the use of sugar instead of confectioner's sugar.  And just like my momma, I make the holes with the lid from my vanilla bottle, which makes the perfect donut holes to fry :-)

These are AWESOME!  I fried the doughnuts and immediatley (without letting them drain briefly) rolled them in cinnamon and sugar.  I can't even imagine buying doughnuts ever again from the store or bakery.  These are so easy and taste spectacular, they don't taste like a biscuit at all.  Next time I will dip them in a chocolate frosting.  Oooooh!

Surprisingly good and easy!  Use coconut oil to fry them in and they are light, fluffly and not overly oily/greasy.  We tried sugar glaze, chocolate, strawberry, etc.- fun to make!

A couple of tips: use one of those cheap wooden shish kebab skewers to make a hole in each one and to gently slide into the grease. The first time we made these, they stuck to the basket and/or didn't cook thoroughly in the middle. Also, the second time, I drained them on paper towels, then put them in a paper lunch bag for a half hour before glazing so they weren't so greasy. I made a glaze out of powdered sugar, milk and vanilla and my son didn't believe they were homemade!

This was so easy.  My kids loved them.  They could not stop eating them.  I think they tasted more like a funnel cake but just in the shape of a donut. I will make them again for the kids.

Mmm, mmm, Awesome! It took less time to make these than it does a batch of pancakes! I used the side of a cup to flatten the Pillsbury Grands biscuits I used. My 8yo used tongs and a spoon to powder the donuts. About half way through, we added 2 Tbs white sugar, and 1-2 tsp cinnamon to the remaining powdered sugar. I don't have a fryer so I used a deep 12 inch pan using about 3/4 quart canola oil, and kept the temp around 360*.Be sure to keep space between the dough. Thanks for a quick & easy change to a weekend's breakfast!

For what these are, they're great.  I just quarter each biscuit and fry in about 325 degree oil.  It's a lot easier than cutting out shapes.  They kind of taste like funnel cake.  They must be eaten fresh!

I made these this morning before school. It was so easy, and I got a "mom, you're the best". I will be making these all the time with different variations from other reviewers. I can't wait.

So easy to make.  I still thought they tasted like a fried biscuit with powdered sugar on them (not a doughnut) but my kids LOVED them - and afterall that is really what counts. Actually, its better for me that i didn't care that much for them, LOL

These were very easy and very quick. They were a little too sweet to eat more than a few bites though. Best right out of the hot oil. I rolled mine in cinnamon and sugar.

I made these this morining for breakfast since I had a few can of biscuits in the fridge.  These were pretty darn good!  My 7 year old son and 10 year old nephew loved them!  They said they tasted like churros.  I used cinnamon and sugar for the topping.  Not like doughnut shop doughnuts but very good in thier own homemade unique way.

I was skeptical about this recipe but after I finally got the temp just right, they were great! My kids loved them!  The key is NOT to let your oil get too hot.

These were pretty good but recipe didn't specify what kind of oil to use so I thought I'd try canola oil. It sure smelled the house up. Next time we'll just stop at the donut shop ... that's easier.

Very Good Recipe! Making Donuts with Buttermilk Biscuit Dough? Weird But it works. It adds a more buttery taste then typical donuts but still good. They should be eatin directly after frying when they sit out for a while they don't taste as good. Add some sugar and cinnamin and there you go! Great Recipe and extremely easy!

I was skeptical going in, but since I had very few ingredients on hand and a craving for pastry, I tried it. Wow, was I impressed! It's so simple, yet it tricks your brain into thinking it's so much more. Big 5 stars for this one. =)

I have been making these forever! I think I was about 12 when I made them the first time. (not gonna divulge my age but I got grandkids LOL) I prefer them w/ regular sugar w/ a bit of cinnamon mixed in. We don't eat fried foods much anymore but maybe I'll make a batch up for old times sake.

My mom use to also makes these for us when we were kids as "special treats".  To make them even more gooey--mix a glaze of powder sugar and milk and pour over when hot!! SOOOOO GOOOD! Melted chocolate chips are good also.

This recipe is so easy and simple, that I didn't have much hope for it turning out really tasty.  Well, I was WRONG!!  LOL  These donuts turned out really yummy tasting and hubby and son polished them off.  What a great alternative to having to buy donuts and it is so easy and quick to do!!  Thanks!!

So easy. My mom suggested I make doughnut holes instead and they were just as great. I used regular sugar also as a topping, and it tasted very good. I loved this recipe and will make it many more times. I did not have a deep-fryer so I used a deep skillet.

These are very yummy and certainly worth a try!! I made some doughnuts and holes and then quartered some of the biscuits and rolled into balls for plain holes. I also have found that if you flatten out a whole role it will turn out perfectly for a filled doughnut. Rolling in powdered sugar gives it a pastey look while rolling in plain granulated sugar has a better appearance. All taste great. Oh and I fried these in my little deep frier. Thanks!

I grew up with my mom making these for us on the weekends. I love them and can't wait to make them for my kids. I think the name "doughnut" is a little misleading. I am from Baton Rouge and this is really a quick way of making beignets.

The sweetness for this doughnut comes from the glaze.  We double dipped them to make them sweet enough for us.  This is a great recipe for people who like quick homemade treats with little clean-up!

I didn't know you could use biscuits to make donuts. This was a first for me. I made this for my son and he liked them. However, they are very filling and the key is to eat them while they are hot. I like to make doughnut holes with cinnamon sugar or powdered sugar, but you have to make sure you have a lot of people to feed, so they can eat them all up while still warm. Don't forget to have plenty of cold milk on hand.

To all of you whining that this is not a recipe, just stop...nobody forced you to click it. If you don't like it then just move along, nothing to see here! There are plenty of homemade "from scratch" donut recipes if this one is not your cup of tea. This is for somebody with a spare can of biscuit dough in the fridge who wants a fresh HOT donut RIGHT NOW! 
If that's you...this recipe is PERFECT!

I made 1 batch and will definitely continue to make these. My kids loved them. I made them mini sized perfect for little hands. I could not find a small cutter for the hole part on these mini donuts so used the cap from a permanent marker. Perfect!!

These are pretty tasty and a good way to settle the tummy when it needs to tame a donut craving. Will make these again. Fun and easy when trying new toppings and fillings. And way less $$$ than gourmet donuts.

These were quick and easy but the taste was disappointing. Even tossed in cinnamon sugar, they were blah.   I won't make them again.

Amazing, but little tip replace the shortening with Canola oil for a better taste and better health and add cinnamon to the sugar for a cinnamon donut!

I love these! They are the perfect recipe for a busy mom on the go.  If someone didn't post these then us 20 and 30-year-olds would not know about them. So thank you for posting! These are quick, easy and I can make all different coatings.  Plus I can't eat dairy so being able to make yummy donuts with biscuits that don't have dairy or butter is a fantastic!

We loved these! Quick and fun! They floated as soon as they were put in the oil so I just waited until they were a dark golden brown on one side then flipped and waited until dark golden brown then removed them. You could use half the amount of oil if desired. I cooked these in a 3qt pot 3 at a time. They came out perfect. Going to make these for a P.J party this Fri!

These were a great way to try out the new deep fryer Santa brought me!  I used the not-so-grand size of canned biscuits, then went a little crazy.  I used a turkey baster to inject them with whipped peanut butter frosting, dipped them in chocolate glaze, then added chopped PB cups to the top.  My husband didn't believe they were homemade until he tasted how fresh they were.  I have seen that trendy restaurants have been adding fresh doughnuts with a variety of dipping sauces to their dessert menus, and I think I will be doing the same thing.  Everyone loves a doughnut!

wow who knew doughnuts would be so simple.  They turned out great.  I used small biscuits and made the holes by just shaping it with my fingers.  I made glaze with powdered sugar and milk and also the chocolate glaze on here, will make again!

We made these today with cinnamon bun dough.  I made each bun into three balls and we fried them up to serve with brunch...they were a hit and so easy.  We sprinkled them with confectioner sugar.  What fun!!

I have always made donuts like this and have many variations like lots of the other reviews. Great for camping out too! We always fry up the donuts, drain them, and then give them a splash of OJ before shaking the powdered sugar on. MMmm good!

My mother used to make these doughnuts for me like this when I was a little girl. I now make them for my children. They love them as much as I did. Sometimes I use powder suger to make a glaze and drizzle over the doughnuts.

I've been making doughnuts this way for years, though I generally skip the sugar and just eat them plain. Always been a family favorite. And I must confess, there are times we fight over the doughnut holes..... sooooo good.

I was still in high school when I first learned you could make donuts this way.  That would make me about the same age as most of your grandmothers.  We never cut a hole for the donut, just made a hole with our fingers, worked great and no little pieces to get burnt.

We used to make these years ago over a fire during Girl Scout camp outs. We heated the oil in coffee cans. So yummy!

I also have been making these for years. My children are grown and starting families of their own and I can't wait to make these for my grandkids. I put powdered sugar and cinnamon and sugar mixture in separate ziploc bags,drop doughnuts in and shake them up. Great way to have kids help!

I just made them and they turned out so good. They are very easy and barely made any mess and tasted just like the ones that you can buy. They taste good with cinnamon sugar on them.

These were fabulous.  Just as described.  I made mine by cutting each biscuit into thirds or fourths and then rolled in cinnamon sugar.  You can't ask for anything easier.  They were great for just my husband and I, but I would also love to fix them for company.

These doughnuts are just delicious.I've been eating these since I was a kid.It's hard to believe that something so simple could taste so good.Instead of the powdered sugar we always make a warm vanilla glaze to dip them in and they are out of this world!

I was a total skeptic about this recipe but I had a can of biscuits in the fridge & a major sweet tooth so I tried this.  After frying, I rolled them in powdered sugar that was mixed with a little cinnamon.  I was very surprised at how unlike biscuits these were!  They reminded me of Indian frybread & maybe that is a better description - but in a pinch these will satisfy a donut urge :) Make sure your oil is the right temp, some of mine cooked too fast & they were a bit doughy inside - they still got eaten so I guess it wasn't too tragic!

These were super yummy & oh so easy to make!  So I'm giving it a 5. However, & this is just ignorance on my part since I don't really make a lot of desserts - I made them before we left the house to go out to dinner, thinking we could nibble on them when we get back.  They're weren't quite the same after sitting for a few hours. At least we got to taste the donut holes before dinner! Next time, I will make these knowing we're gonna eat them right away, or cut the recipe down since there's just 2 of us.

Great recipe!  So easy to make.  My 7-yr old had fun making the donut shapes and I had fun cooking them.  We used a bit of powered sugar and milk as a glaze.  Our local store doesn't carry the buttermilk bisquits so I used regular - they still taste delicious.  Thank you so much for the easy recipe!

Fantastic! These were so much fun to make! They did sort of taste like a biscuit...but not in a bad way! Our favorites were the ones we left whole and filled with cheesecake pudding, then were rolled in cinnamon sugar!

These are pretty good.  They taste exactly like what they are...biscuits with sugar on them.  My husband and son thought they were wonderful.  Me and my daughter were on the fence.  However, they are a quick easy treat that are not to sweet.

These were good and super easy given what they are.  We had "donuts" inside 20 minutes or so.  They're not as sweet as a regular donut, but they do in a pinch.  Thanks for such a clever idea!

We weren't really crazy about these.  Very simple recipe, but just not to my liking.

These are my go-to for a donut recipe.  Quick easy and fun for the kids as well!
We use glaze, cinnamon & sugar and the powered sugar for options!  All Yummy!

This is great if you are looking for something sweet and you haven't been to the grocery store in a while.  Canned biscuits, oil, and sugar and you are good to go!  Good and simple!

Good, but only right after cooking.  I used chocolate frosting.  My kids love them.

Classic! My mom used to make these when I was little and I wanted to find the recipe but didn't know how and I came across this and it's exactly the same! I love it! They turned out great, my mom used to make them on the stove with a pan of oil but I used my deep fryer and they were perfect. We make them with both cinnamon and sugar and also some with powdered sugar, very tasty!

So incredibly easy.  I thought they would be terrible but they weren't and they instantly hit the spot for a doughnut craving.  Will definitely make again!

These aren't really like bakery doughnuts, but easy and inexpensive to make and they did taste good.  I rolled mine in a mixture of brown and white sugar since I didn't have any powdered sugar.  And don't forget to use the dough from the middle to make doughnut holes! =)

These were good and so easy.  I love fresh doughnuts, but they are a lot of work.  This is a great short cut to satisfy a craving.  Thanks!

This is a recipe that was given to me by my mother years ago and I've just recently made these for my husband and he says they are better than the ones you buy at any store!  I love the fact that it's so easy too!

My mom made these for me when I was young and now I make them. Absolutely some of the best doughnuts!!! You wouldn't think so because they're so easy. I just roll in regular sugar. Try that way too!

I was craving something sweet and I remembered seeing this recipe a while ago.  I dusted them with a mixture of granulated sugar and cinnamon since I didn't have powdered sugar on hand.  They were good, but nothing special.  Definitely took care of my sweet craving though!

These were so delicious.  I used Bisquick to whip up a batch of fresh non-buttermilk bisquits and I was quite suprised at how good they were.  

I agree with the other people about cinnamon and sugar being the best topping for them, but the powdered sugar is great, too-it's just better to eat those fresh off the fryer.

These were called "First Snow" doughnuts when I was growing up.  Every year, the first time it snowed and school was closed, my mom would make these for us.  Boy do I remember then tasting good!  I've made them since then to share my fond memories with my husband.  What they may lack in taste is made up for in sentimentality

I've made these before and liked them just as much as I did in the past.  I wish I had used granulated sugar and cinnomon instead of powdered.   The powdered suger turns to paste.  You can also frost these, ice them, put sprinkles on them etc.
This is one food that I tell all of my clients (I'm a personal trainer and group fitness instructor) to never put in their bodies.  It has no nutritional value at all!  I love them though.  Don't tell!
