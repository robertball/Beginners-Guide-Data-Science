I love this!  I took it to an office party, and everyone else really liked it, too.  I wouldn't change a thing.

Pretty good! I did an ingredient search & this popped up. I thought it sounded like a yummy hot dip. So I melted everything together. That was good, but the leftovers straight from the fridge was good too. So it can go either wayy.

I used fresh chopped spinach instead of frozen (husband preference) and even though I hate this cheese and wouldn't eat it...hubs loved it! I thought it might need an herb or more seasoning but he said no. His rating is perfect as written (fresh spinach instead though).

An hour didn't  seem long enough to firm it up.  Spinach wasn't chopped up enough, made it difficult to eat
