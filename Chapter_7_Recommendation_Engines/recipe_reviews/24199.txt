Let me start off my saying I hate when people review a recipe then say all the things they changed.  I didn't exactly do that.  Here it goes!  I made the pie filling and just baked it without the crust (too lazy to make crust) or meringue.  I followed the filling recipe to a T and it turned out AMAZING!  The filling is rick and creamy and the allspice adds an element of spice.  Once the filling was baked I let it cool for a little bit then served each serving with a huge spoonful of Haagen-Daz Rum Raisin ice cream!  HOLY COW!  I will definately make this again!  Thanks!

My Grandmother made this pie when I was a child. It was the most wonderful pie ever! I recently started looking for her 'amber pie'. I didn't think I'd ever be able to find it again. Turns out, everyone else calls it amber pie, too.  It was wonderful.  Thank you

I used a walnut pie crust which was great with the raisins- great filling recipe- I didn't use the meringue.

OMG, this is way too sweet for me!  Really wouldn't need that much sugar, raisins are so sweet already... I won't make again. If you like sweet desserts and raisins, this is probably a good one for you.
