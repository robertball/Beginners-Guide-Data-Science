Great idea, Thank you! - It never occurred to me to mix Quinoa with Tuna.    Also- make sure to rinse the Quinoa a few times before cooking to ensure there is no bitter taste.  It has to do with a protective coating/residue called saponin.

This is a great recipe to play with. I changed out several ingredients, except for the tuna, quinoa, lemon juice and mayonnaise. I didn't have any wasabi powder so I added grape tomatoes, shredded apple and carrots. I didn't have celery either so I used some celery seed, which was tasty. Then the best addition, I chopped a small handful of walnuts and threw that in. It all tasted wonderful together! I find that quinoa is becoming a staple in my kitchen and this is one more recipe I will add to my list.

Awesome, delicious, imaginative, different, flavorful...the list of adjectives goes on.  This is truly a great tuna salad recipe.  I cooked the quinoa traditionally, boiling vs. microwave.  Because hubby and I like bold flavor, doubled the wasabi and upped the lemon a little.  Absolutely incredible...makes me want to play with chicken salad with a dash of wasabi...etc.  Many kudos and thanks!!!

HATE Wisabi...that aside this was an awsome idea.  I added a few shakes or cayene pepper, doubled the onion and celery, added 1/2 c shredded carrot. Left the Mayo the same, but used the juice from a whole lemon from my tree (would be awsome with lime too) Used this to stuff low cal pita halves for lunch.  With the extra veg I get a bit healthier meal and stretch this to 3 or 4 servings rather than just 2.

OMG, this was so good. Didn't have Wasabi powder, no celery and can't eat onions, but I sauted julienned zucchini and chopped carrot, adding in onion powder and the other ingredients.  Served it hot, not cold.  Wow!  Was soooo good and filling.

This was awesome... tastes like a great pasta salad, but healthier!! I didn't change a thing and don't think it needs anything more or less.  I always use the olive oil mayo, as it is fairly low in fat, but still has a good mayonnaise taste. Thanks, Caron.  I never would have thought to put this together!

I thought this was a delicious recipe. I used double the tuna and a little more mayo to moisten. Plus I added some dill weed, which I always use for tuna salad. It was fabulous and tasted just as good, if not better, after a couple of days. I used stuffed in a pita with sprouts and diced tomatoes. Yummy and very filling!

I followed the recipe exactly as written.  Something about this just doesn't work - it might be the combination of lemon juice and the wasabi powder? It was a little better after sitting overnight, but still tasted like something a very inexperienced cook might concoct with whatever is on hand.

The wasabi was a BRILLIANT idea...I'm constantly looking for different quinoa recipes (this superfood is extremely understated)...thanks Caron, I'm now able to add another great quinoa recipe to my arsenal!

I used wasabi paste and thought it was great. I didn't have celery on hand, so I used some cucumber and zucchini and it was delicious!

This was pretty good.  I've been trying to incorporate more whole grains (although quinoa is a seed, it still counts) into my diet and this really helped.  Although my wasabi powder is brand new, I couldn't really taste it so I had to add more.  I also added a chopped dill pickle and some Worcestershire sauce.  I took this to work to eat at my midnight break instead of going to the employee dining room and being tempted by all the (free) desserts.  I really enjoyed it.  Thanks, Caron!

I cant figure out what is wrong with this recipe--  something just doesnt taste right-- i think regular helmann's may be a better choice. I'll try that next time.

I'm not sure how to really rate this recipe.  Based on the reviews, I should have really loved this one but to my disappointment, it wasn't that good.  My dish turned out with a very bitter taste and that was BEFORE I added the quinoa.  Now, I know from cooking quinoa before that you have to rinse it well before you cook it so it doesn't taste bitter (this recipe should have stated that) and I did rinse my quinoa but my dish was bitter before I even put the quinoa in!  By the way, the quinoa itself was fine, it wasn't bitter.  I decided maybe I should add more wasabi powder as some of the reviewers suggested but before I did, I tasted the wasabi to see how much of a kick it had and UGH!  It was horribly bitter!  It was a brand new container and I had just bought it an hour before at the market.  I Googled wasabi powder and discovered that it can go bad and when it does, tastes bitter.  SO, I went back to the market and bought a tube of wasabi paste and added it to my recipe hoping that if I added enough it would disguise the bitterness.  I'm not sure how well it will work.  I will let the dish set overnight and see.  Seems to me this recipe should taste good based on its ingredients but just be sure you RINSE YOUR QUINOA BEFORE COOKING, AND HAVE FRESH WASABI POWDER!  I think the recipe should be clearer on these two things because it can ruin the whole dish.

REALLY liked this!  That said, here's what I did: First and foremost, RINSE the quinoa so it isn't bitter.  Second, please DO add some ginger to taste, as some reviewers said--it makes this even more fantastic.  I used about 1 tsp. of ready-made wasabi paste from a tube.  The photo here shows this salad in a tomato shell, but I didn't want to do that so I diced nice vine-ripened tomatoes for a base that I spooned this salad over.  I used a small jar of my mom's home-canned albacore which had more than enough salt in it so if you do use that sort of thing, watch the added salt. Hubby and I both thought it was a little dry so next time, I'll add just a touch more mayo (not low-fat--ick) to it.  Thanks, Caron--this rocks!

I took this to a group dinner and most everyone liked it alot. I had to add much more of the wasabi powder, maybe it was because I had this in my pantry for quite some time and it has lost it potency. I added carrots that I chopped in the food processor and wanted to add cucumbers just before serving , and ginger,but forgot. Also added a little soy sauce. I'd like to try it again using wasabi paste,the cucumber and ginger.

Wow - I just made this for my husband and I and we loved it.  We made the recipe exactly like it's written, except that I forgot the lemon juice.  Served over a bed of greens.  It seems like such an odd combination with the wasabi powder, but we both loved it.  I'll make this again for sure!

It was just alright. I will try cooking the quinoa on the stove-top next time for better water absorption and texture instead of the microwave method. Opted not to use the wasabi (didn't have any anyway) and used a dash or two of cayenne powder. I highly recommend Hellman's mayo (I used Kraft mayo and I think that's why it didn't turn out so well)and adding other veggies like shredded carrot and cabbage.

A fantastic and tasty recipe.  The first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly and it was great.  Today I switched the wasabi for dijon mustard, and the tuna for canned turkey breast meat.  Also tasty... just goes to show that you can basically put in any meat and/or veggies you want and it will work out.  A nice way to learn to use quinoa in cooking.

Cooked the quinoa in vegetable broth instead of water. Used fennel instead of celery, but did sprinkle with celery seed. Also added 1/4 cup green bell pepper. A hit!!

A great way to use ordinary old tuna.   Wasabi powder can be reduced to taste and, in my case, had to end up using some horseradish.  That is the only change.

Delicious!  I used red quinoa when making this, and it takes about 30 minutes tp cppl on the stove top as opposed to a shorter time in the microwave.  Wasabi tastes great with the tuna and quinoa.  I would not have thought of that if it had not been for this recipe!  I'll be making this again!

This was a delightful flavorful healthy side dish or next day on crackers or toast.  My husband liked it as well.  I tasted before putting in the tuna and it was just as good, maybe better.  I doubled everything except the tuna for a bigger dish.

I thought the name of this recipe was a little over the top, but now that I have tried it, WOW! Tuna has been transformed.  I doubled it and thought that it still needed a little more wasabi. That is a matter of taste. I did read other reviews that added different ingredients. I have no doubt  they would be great, but for now, I am so happy that we have a great, low fat, nutritious version of tuna salad. Try it. You will like it!!

After reading suggestions I did make the following changes...I sauteed 1/4 cup each of cucumber, squash, zucchini, onions and celery for a couple of minutes in olive oil and added just a dash of dill weed. I didn't use the wasabi powder because I didn't have any on hand but added 1/2 tablespoon of Paula Dean's seasoning (salt, pepper, garlic powder). I also added just a small handful of colby/monterey jack shredded cheese and 1/4 cup diced Roma tomatoes. This is delicious warm or chilled the only suggestion I would offer is to cut back on the lemon juice its a little overpowering.

I like this. Always looking for new ways with quinoa. I cooled the quinoa quickly by rinsing it under cold water, then draining. I had to double the wasabi in order to taste it. I only used a 5 oz. can of albacore, that was all I had. I added some cilantro and diced red pepper. I think this will be even better tomorrow after it sits.

I love this! I did not have any tuna so used a can of salmon and also had no wasabi powder so mixed some creamed horseradish with the mayo. It was wonderful. I will be making this often!

I tried this recipe for my husband that does not eat fish and was hoping to get him to eat tuna.  It worked!  It was a huge hit and a great 1-2-punch on the protiens and complex carbs.  perfect athlete meal. *** I added some ground ginger and it totally made it AWESOME!

I doubled the recipe and used high quality tuna from 
American  Tuna, one can smoked one can regular.

We too are not into spicy so I added a small amount of cayenne pepper to the mix, as well as lemon and rosemary essential oil to the mayo mix.

We are also not big fans of raw onion so I cooked it in some butter so we got the crunch!

This was delicious and we will absolutely be making it again.

Great go to.  Excellent for tuna melts.   For variety try parsnips and green peppers.

Used carrots and raw broccoli florets as an alternative to the celery and onion and halved the water with beef stock.  The meal was surprisingly  tasty.

The wasabi doesn't stay "kickin" as it gets older. Add when you want to serve. Wasabi in the tube works better than the powder.

All of us (guests and kids) really enjoyed this! I like this new take on tuna salad. It would have been great as is, but I always end up modifying a recipe, so here goes: I added spinach (thawed frozen) to get some more super foods in. We were out of wasabi (DARN!), so I added dijon-style mustard and left out the lemon juice this time. I used only a scoop of mayo for that flavor and the rest was plain yogurt (no one can ever tell that I made it lower-fat - in any recipe using mayo). Thanks for the recipe, Caron! :o)

Another great quinoa recipe.  I modified the recipe since I was lacking some ingredients.  Did not add Wasabi powder or celery.  I did add extra onion, peas, 2 tsp of horseradish and doubled the quinoa.  This recipe would be great with any vegetables you have on hand.  I will definitely make again.

Just made this tuna salad, and it was wonderful. We ate over salad greens and drizzled with sesame-ginger dressing. Tasted like sushi salad. Thanks so much for this recipe!

Made this tonight for a quick dinner, as I had to go back to work for the night shift.  Very easy and fast to me.  Not sure if the hubby liked it, but he ate it.  Will make again.  Didn't use wasabi this time.  Not sure where to buy it, but will try it when I do find it.

This is so easy & tastes wonderful!  I would definitely suggest running the ingrediants through to count your own nutrition info as (with many quinoa recipes,) the calorie count appears to be for the same amount of uncooked quinoa as opposed to cook.  (Dramatically reduing the calories in this yummy-ummy dish!)  Enjoy!
