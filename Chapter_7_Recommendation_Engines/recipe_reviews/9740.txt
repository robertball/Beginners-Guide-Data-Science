I found this cookie to be quite elegant and tasty!  The almond flavor bursts out.

I did not find this an easy recipe to make.  The first two pans the cookies were fused to the pans  I did manage to get cookies off the pans when I switched to my coated pans and greased heavily.  The cookies were crisp on the edge and very soft in the middle therefore "tearing" in the center.
Unfortunately I will not make these again.

The cookie tastes great, but to get them off the cookis sheet, you should VERY generously grease the sheets.  The flavor is excellent, though.

Delicious! I didn't have any brown sugar so I used white sugar and about a tablespoon and a half of molasses- that may have changed the consistancy because I didn't have as much trouble getting them off the cookie sheet as previous reviewers. If you let them sit about 30 seconds before trying to get them off and only make about 6-7 cookies at a time, you shouldn't have a problem. Thanks, Deb!

Very yummy if you love almonds! I also added 1/4 tsp of almond extract to give an extra kick of almond. They were very easy and quick to make

Taste was good but they were hard to work with.
