This was pretty good, it's almost as good as the real thing.  I did have to add more chocolate chips to get the flavor I was looking for.  The kids are really excited about getting chocolate crepes and having it on toast.

Too much hazelnut taste, and not enough chocolate taste.  Plus, I tried adding more oil, and it just didn't get a good creamy texture.

I used sugar free chocolate chips, and about 1,5 times as much as the recipe called for. It's SO much healthier than Nutella!

This recipe was ok, the flavour wasn't great and it is far more cost effective to buy hazelnut spread.
