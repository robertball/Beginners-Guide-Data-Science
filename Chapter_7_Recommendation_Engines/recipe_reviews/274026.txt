These were easy to make and so good! Didnâ€™t change the recipe and liked adding the grape seed oil to make a nice brown top. Make sure all the apples are sealed inside. Yum!

I used 5 tbsp brown sugar because I try to cut back on sugar if I making something myself. I did not have grapeseed oil so I lightly brushed olive oil. Overall, very good dessert.

I didn't have premade crust and just used my normal 1-crust recipe with butter instead of shortening.  I also halved the recipe, but I did end up with too much crust.  Next time I think I will still halve the recipe but divide it into 4 smaller pies (not that any went wasting), maybe using a larger apple or 2 small ones to get a bit more sauce, I didn't need any cornstarch to thicken.  It was very yummy with ice cream. It really does cook in 8 minutes, at 390 (I don't have 385 option on my air fryer). I also didn't use the glaze, it was tasty without since my pie shell recipe is buttery.
