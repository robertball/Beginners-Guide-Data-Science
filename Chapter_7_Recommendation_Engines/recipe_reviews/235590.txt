We had two different opinions of this recipe in my home. I gave it between 2 and 3 stars and the man of the home gave it 4 stars. I followed the recipe exactly. He said "put some ketchup or hot sauce on top", which I ignored.  (He puts ketchup on his glazed ham at Easter!!!) He loves meatloaf of all kinds and has been known to request it as his birthday meal. I feel this meatloaf really needed additional seasonings. I found it too bland. Maybe salt, pepper, onions, garlic and some mustard powder. I could not detect the 'brand' name fried onions at all. When I removed them from the muffin tin, they completely fell apart. Sure, that won't affect the taste but it did lose the visual appeal of a "mini meatloaf" I might make this again, but I would definitely add more seasonings.

We have used this recipe several times and we really enjoy it. As a family we like to "tweak" recipes so we have substituted cream of chicken soup for cream of mushroom (due to allergy issues) and we top the mini meatloaves with BBQ  sauce instead of soup. We also added more Worcester sauce, more french fried onions, and 2 tbs Siracha to the meat mix. As a bonus, if you make these for dinner, they reheat very well for lunch the next day. Next time we use this recipe we plan on adding diced uncooked bacon to the meat mix. Enjoy!
