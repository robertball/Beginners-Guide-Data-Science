I didn't wait for the potatoes to cool, but added the arugula and dressing while still hot.  This sort of wilted the arugula and caused the potatoes to soak up the dressing.  It was delicious!

My 5-star rating for this recipe speaks for itself as to how much I liked this salad. It's so refreshingly different and really delicious.  This is something I'd expect to find in gourmet delis for a bazillion ridiculous dollars a pound. It lends an elegant, unique touch to the table and wakes up the same old cook-out.  It would be terrific  just as is, but because I have a bunch of stuff in the fridge I want to use I added red, yellow and orange bell pepper, which made this look very festive.  For my own personal tastes I changed the white vinegar to 1 T. each of white wine vinegar and lemon juice - I don't like a particularly tangy dressing.  I also gave it a couple of shakes of Penzey's Fox Point Seasoning and a drizzle of white truffle oil.  I so dislike this expression, but I have to say it - this is a keeper.

Nice change from traditional potato salad and a different way to use arugula.  I added about 1/2 T balsamic vinegar and went light on the oil.  Nice side with a grilled london broil.  Be warned, though, it is quite strong tasting with the garlic and arugula... for the more adventurous eaters out there.

This is an easy and delicious salad.  We got both potatoes and arugula in our box from our CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) farm.  Its a great way to use them together.

Yummy, healthy, and easy to make!!  I used lemon juice instead of the vinegar, added the arugula to the warm potatoes, and added some feta cheese crumbles at the end.  Delish!

Not the best thing I've ever made.  The consistency was good, but with the bitterness of the arugula and the acidiness of the vinegar, it made my throat burn.

Huge hit whenever I serve it.  I've also made it with lemon juice substituted for the white vinegar, and have found that many prefer it that way.

To be honest, I had fairly low expectations for this recipe.  The ingredient list looked lack-luster, but I was wrong!  It was so good I could have turned it into the main dish!  I made a few modifications based on the other reviews.  I added 4 chopped hard boiled eggs for richness and switched one tablespoon of the white vinegar for red wine vinegar but most importantly, I added one teaspoon of sugar to the vinaigrette to mellow out the tang of the vinegar.  This is a great alternative to your standard arugula salad!

Nice starter recipe but needed to add my own touch! I liked the suggestion to add the argula and dressing to the hot potatoes. Then I added chopped eggs, a jar of pimentos that I chopped up, and some celery. More salt & pepper. It was delicious with the bitterness of argula, the sweetness of the pimento, and the crunch of celery. The eggs added richness.

This is an excellent summer salad. I got fresh arugula and garlic at the farmers market and was looking for something unique to do with them. I did make a few small changes, other reviews emphasized a sort of wilted arugula approach, so I followed their advice. I also substituted red wine vinegar and added 1/2 teaspoon crushed mustard and 1/2 teaspoon sugar. These additions helped balance out the vinegar and arugula bitters. I served it as a side to chicken parmesan for a friends birthday and by the end of the night there were no leftovers! Thanks for the recipe!

Great! I made some changes such as adding a chopped roasted red pepper and a chopped young sweet vidalia onion (greens included). I also added 2 small stalks of celery. In addition, i added a teaspoon of honey to the liquid ingredients (i also substituted apple cider vinegar for the white one).  Delicious use of arugula!!

This is a great alternative to mayo. Next time I am not going to use so much garlic. I am also going to swap out the white vinegar for some flavored kind or red wine vinegar. The dressing was strong!!! I used a medley of mixed small potatoes and that made it beautiful with all the colors. I also added the potatoes while still warm.

Really delicious! I roasted the potatoes instead of boiling them, concocted my own dressing with mustard and lemon juice, and combined everything while the potatoes were still warm as everyone suggested. A tablespoon of very finely chopped red onion went a long way in uniting the flavors better. Perfect for a potluck or BBQ, especially if you have vegan or gluten-intolerant guests.

This is a fantastic salad. I was looking for something to do with some of my CSA box produce. I ended up using yukon gold potatoes instead of red, arugula, and adding some cherry tomatoes. Excellent! Will make again and again in my house.

When a friend's CSA box contained arugula, potatoes and fava beans, I went looking for something that used everything.  This recipe was it.  I also used lemon juice with just a bit of balsamic vinegar.  And I added the arugula and the dressing while the potatoes were hot.  I waited to add the fava beans until the salad was cool.  They were a great addition.  I'm making it again now!

I made this two days ago to use some of the huge package of arugula that I purchaed at Trader Joe's.  I replaced the white vinegar with red wine vinegar and used a little less than 1/4 cup of EVOO and only one clove of garlic.  I followed others advice and put the dressing and arugula in with the potatoes while they were still warm.  I thought the salad was good, nothing special...but when I ate the leftovers for lunch today, it was very good.  I could taste the garlic and the spiciness of the arugula.  I would recommend making this in advance and letting it sit for at least a day for all of the flavors to meld.

I could taste the vinegar just a bit too much for my liking.  I will try again and decrease the vinegar.  Good recipe though!

Yummy!  I added eggs and green beans and made it a meal.  We don't typically like arugula and I got some in my csa box.  I was looking for something other than throwing it in a green salad.  I think it would be good with bacon too.  Will make again, thanks.

I loved the olive oil and vinegar mix that goes on the potato and arugula mix. Would make a great salad dressing. I used small potato cubes (about a 1/4 - 1/2 inch) and the potatoes were too soft in 15 minutes. Will make again!

Such a wonderful use of arugula! I love the variety of texture and the tang of the vinegar. I let the potatoes soak in the dressing for a few hours before adding the arugula - I didn't want wilted leaves. After mincing garlic all day, I couldn't bring myself to mince more so I used garlic powder instead. I can't wait to make this again!

My grandfather from Italy would always make parsley potatoes while I was growing up which is exactly this same recipe but instead of arugula he used fresh parsley.  I love arugula and when I found this recipe I was so excited to try to use arugula!  It is absolutely delicious and I mix all ingredients while warm to help the dressing soak into the warm potatoes and let the arugula wilt a bit.  I wouldnt consider it a potato salad but more of a potatoe side dish with a hearty meal.  It has a nice tartness/ sourness to it from the vinegar, so if you are not a fan of vinegar this might not be for you, but I LOVE IT!

I loved this potato salad recipe!  It was delicious!  Instead of 3 tbs. vinegar, I added 1-1/2 tbs. lemon juice and 1-1/2 tbs. white vinegar.  I also added the warm potatoes to the arugula.  It is a nice light change from the mayonnaise version potato salad.  The arugula adds a great flavor!  The leftovers tasted awesome the next day too.

I had a lot of leftover arugula I wanted to use.  I followed the recipe exactly and the only thing I changed the second time was to decrease the olive oil a bit.  I also followed another reviewers advice and mixed it while the potatoes were still warm so the arugula wilted just a bit.  Serve room temperature.  Excellent! Will continue to make.

Wow... this was so good. I made enough for two, so I just quartered a handful of small red potatoes, cooked them in water for 5 minutes in the microwave and scaled down the dressing (I used half rice wine vinegar and half red wine vinegar and added a small splash of lemon juice). I also put in a handful of shaved Parmesan for saltiness. It was very good. For the serving size that I did, my guess is that I used a T of the dressing, so it's light compared to a mayo-based dressing.

So good!  I also used lemon juice instead of vinegar, and drizzled the dressing ingredients directly over the potatoes & arugula.  I added some goat cheese, which melted a bit and made for a delicious, hearty potato salad.

I've never had arugula before.  I was looking for something to take to a WAP potluck and main ingredients needed to be mostly organic or local, which of course eliminated a jar of Kraft mayo. :-)  I do like tangy, but the arugula was just too bitter for me - though I did eat some of the extra I made.  (After reading the reviews, I'm wondering how I'd feel about adding lemon pepper.)  But... I also rate on whether something served its purpose, and the bowl I took was totally emptied.  The bowl next to it with a spinach salad with some type of tangy dressing had leftovers LOL.  And it feels good taking home an empty bowl.

My husband usually avoids potato salad and can't stop talking about how good this one is! A fantastic alternative to a mayo-based potato salad. I live arugula and am always looking for new ways to use it. I made this just as the recipe said, and I would do it that way again. Nice and garlicky. I'd consider adding fresh herbs like mint or rosemary.

This was excellent.  I like baby arugula so used that, and also, didn't have red skin potatoes on hand, so used russet (steamed them until just done, about 15 minutes or so, so they weren't mushy).  It worked out great and I thought the leftovers wouldn't keep well, because dressed greens usually don't, but the arugula was still the same the next day - it kept well!

Amazing!  This will definitely be added to our kitchen rotation.  My husband said it was the best salad he'd ever had.  It has a fabulous flavor, and it is so simple to make!  I might add some shredded carrots and onions next time, but it is also delicious just the way it is. YUM

This is an easy and yummy recipe! I used some extra arugula (thanks to my co-op box), so I heated them up a bit with water to help them "shrink" a bit. I also added a little onion that needed to get used up and served the dish warm... There were no leftovers!

This is a GREAT recipe. I added the potatoes to the dressing and arugula while they were still a little hot. They soaked up more dressing, and wilted the arugula a little which was wonderful. The flavor is really fantastic. I've made this at least a half dozen times, and got arugula in my CSA box today, so I'll be making it again! Thanks!

I belong to a CSA program at an organic farm and received arugula. Had no idea what to do with it, and then I found this! It was a huge hit, though next time I might use a little less olive oil. On a recommendation I added seasoned salt and it certainly added to the taste!

I got a bunch of arugula at the farmers' market and was excited for this recipe.  I think my "bunch" was way too big for this recipe.  I used less than half and it still dominated my potatoes.  I will use less next time and be more careful to tear into tinier pieces.  I also cooked the potatoes for 15 min and they were way overdone- my bad.  The result was flavorful and edible, but nothing I would prepare for company.  I will use the rest of my arugula and try again though.

I grew a bunch of arugula in my garden and wasn't sure how to use it besides cold green salads - This was really good! Very different, and as one reviewer said, some very strong flavors with the garlic, arugula and vinegar - but they work well together to create a nice fresh flavor.

A-MA-ZING!!!!  I am trying not to eat the whole bowl myself.  I used lemon juice instead of vinegar.  I thought it'd pair well with the peppery arugula.  Also, my grocer's bunch is huge, so I eyeballed the amount of arugula that should go in.  Combined all ingredients while the potatoes were hot.

This recipe is so easy to make and super yummy, with simple ingredients. We added boiled egg and sliced almonds and served it as a side to baked salmon. It was a great way to use a lot of arugula.  If I was quibbling I would say I wasn't sure how much an arugula "bunch" is so I just threw in a "bunch". Will definitely make it again.

Very, very good.  I had left over fingerling potatoes and used those. A small clove of garlic is MORE than enough for me. Otherwise a  great recipe. BTW I used white balsamic vinegar because I didn't have just white and it was perfect.

Took other reviewers suggestion - used lemon juice instead of vinegar & mixed while still warm.   Not serving it for an hour - but can't stop taking a bite every time i walk by - may not be any left for dinner!   Easy & great

This was really good!!  Because I don't like uncooked garlic I added a pinch of garlic powder and some green onions instead.  Also, because I had some painted Easter eggs to use, I added hard boiled eggs.  My husband and daughter, who wouldn't typically go for something like this, enjoyed it.

I also added the arugula and dressing, while potatoes were still warm.  I used Yukon gold potatoes....my favorites.  I cooked several slices of bacon, crumbled them and added just before serving.

So for his reaction, I gave it 3 stars.

Made this salad with white balsamic vinegar instead of the white vinegar. I put the potatoes in the dressing warm and waited until it was chilled before adding the arugula. This is a very different salad that my family liked. The arugula lost some of the peppery taste after it was chilled with the salad. I served it cold instead of warm. I added some goat feta cheese to the salad after it was cooled for more flavor as one reviewer suggested. I liked it better with the feta cheese added. Next time might add some bacon, hard boiled eggs and celery.

Just made this recipe and it is delicious! I cubed and roasted my red potatoes in olive oil, salt, pepper, and garlic powder  (toaster oven 400 deg. 30 min) and followed the rest of the recipe as is. I'll have seconds please. :)

Great recipe. Loved the combination of arugala and potatoes. I did add a little sugar to cut the vinegar but otherwise stuck with the recipe. This went well with grilled venison chops. Nice way to use that extra arugala we have in our garden.

Big hit! I had left over arugula and didn't feel like eating a typical salad. The only changes I made was using apple cider vinegar instead of the white and I squeezed half a lemon in it. I added fresh grated parmesan to it too. I will make this again, maybe for a summer potluck.

I followed the recipe as written and I'm sorry to say it wasn't very exciting. I see some reviewers added additional vegetables and/or changed the sauce. I could see this being better with some changes, but as is it was just too much potato. The vinegar also made it inedible for my 2 and 7 year old, and the 7 year old will eat just about anything! I wish people would rate the recipe as is instead of rating their changed recipe. It would save a lot of time not having to read through a bunch of comments.

I was actually surprised by how much I liked this salad! It's definitely a different take on potato salad. I probably didn't use the full amount of arugula, but I liked the balance of flavors with what I did use.
