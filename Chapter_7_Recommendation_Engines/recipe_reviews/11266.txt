I'll give this 5 stars only after the modifications I made. Without them, I would say it's a 4 star...barely.  First of all, save yourself time and don't put aside a cup of the chocolate batter. My brownies were prettier and had more of a marbled look after I spread the pb than it did after adding the cup of chocolate. The chocolate pretty much covered the pb completely.  Also, these needed frosting in my opinion. I used the following recipe for frosting, and this made this a 5 star recipe! I got this from Blondies on this website: 1/4 cup butter softened 1/2 cup peanut butter 1.5 cups  powdered sugar 1/4 cup milk To make the frosting, mix the remaining 1/2 cup of butter and 1 cup peanut butter together in a medium bowl. Mix in the confectioners sugar until smooth, then gradually stir in milk until a spreadable consistency is reached. Serve frosted brownies warm with ice cream. NOW you're talking 5-star!!:-)
I made these a 2nd time without frosting and they tasted better this time. I didn't put the cup of chocolate on top, and they turned out pretty...I put a couple of spoonfuls of chocolate batter on top, not the whole cup.

I just used a box of brownie mix and swirled the PB on top.  They came out fudgy and delicious.  if you love peanut buttery goodness, this recipes is for you!

These were WAY too greasy, and 1 c. of melted margarine was too much. The brownies were literally oozing with grease. I plan to try them again with less margarine. The brownies would've been rated tops, if not for the problem with the amount of margarine. :o)

These are delicious. Took about an hour in the oven to set, though. Also, I had trouble with the "swirling" - I couldn't get the layers to swirl together because I didn't drop chocolate onto the top so it wasn't quite as pretty as I'd hoped. That said, the two layers taste great together. I used 8 oz. cream cheese (instead of 6) and had no problems. These brownies taste like 80% chocolate and 20% peanut butter cheesecake, in case you're curious about the taste. I will definitely make again!

REALLY good brownies.  I used 1 cup of peanut butter. Also put in an additional 1/4 cup of flour and cut back the butter by 1/4 stick.  They were perfect!

I must admit that when these first came out of the oven and even after they had cooled for about an hour I was not impressed-I am a die-hard brownie fan too.  About 5 hours later when I thought I would try another bite my opinion totally changed, these are great.  I think that letting them cool for a while lets them become a bit fudgier and sweeter-they are really good-trust me, I just had one for breakfast.  (Sidenote:  brownies are a great way to start the day.)  These are quick to put together and as far as presentation they look great.  Try them out, this is a wonderful recipe.  Thanks for sharing it Michelle!

These are incredible brownies! I used Neufchatel cheese instead of cream cheese for the peanut butter layer, and it worked very well. I also skipped the chocolate chips...in my opinion, they would have made marbling much more difficult, they were unnecessary (the brownies were VERY chocolatey without them) and added extra unnecessary calories :) Those are the only changes I made to the recipe itself. I did make some changes to the assembly of the brownies, though. Instead of saving 1 cup of batter, I saved about 1/3 cup. It was way to thick to marble with, so I added a little milk until it was more like regular brownie batter. I spread the rest of the batter into a foil-lined pan (I use Reynold's Release foil...it works SO well for brownies!) and then spread the peanut butter filling on top. I then placed spoonfuls of reserved batter on top of the peanut butter, making neat rows. I used a clean knife to marble them together, but was careful not to marble so much that the overall look was muddied. I baked it for about 30 minutes or so...until a toothpick inserted halfway to the center came out clean. As written, the brownies would be overbaked and dry. After they cooled in the pan, I lifted the brownies  out of the pan using the foil lining, making cutting much easier. Thanks so much for sharing the recipe...these were a big hit! I'll be making these brownies again!!!

This recipe rocks! As-is, no subsitutions of modifications required! Cut them small, because they are rich, moist, chewy- and will go FAST! I think that ALLY99 possibly ran into technical difficulties the first time around because these surely DO NOT require frosting!! :-)

These brownies were yummmy and GONE in my office!! This was my first time making brownies from scratch and they were very easy. Even I got the marbled effect going very well, using 3/4 cup of set side chocolate batter. Also, they had just a hint of peanut butter which I think made it fantastic for everyone but for a group that loves peanut butter, I would add more. And like everyone else said, it tasted WAY better the day after and I didn't chill it.

These brownies were delicious!  I took these to a party and they were gone within two hours.  I accidently used one 8 oz. pkg. of cream cheese, so I added a little more peanut butter and sugar and they turned out just fine.  I will definitely make again.

These brownies are absolutely fabulous (and I MUST say that they are much better the next day, so I recommend making them a bit ahead of time).  They remind me of a "peanut-buttery" version of the cheesecake brownies at The Cheesecake Factory--Yummmy!

As some people had noted trouble achieving the marbled affect, I'll share what worked for me.  I dabbed the reserved brownie batter in small dots accross the surface of the peanut butter layer.  Then I gently used a spatula to sort of "connect the dots" so that most of the surface was covered with the chocolate layer.  Then I just went to town with a knife and actually dug in a bit while doing so.  The result was a marbled brownie that was as pretty as it was delicious.  This recipe is highly recommended and I didn't change a thing!

They don't get much, if any, better than this:  Thx Michelle!  Absolutely perfect; thick, moist n rich.  I made per your recipe other than using crunchy peanut butter.  They baked equally beautiful and according to your time given. I might try pecans or walnuts next time n use smoothe peanut butter for a great variation.  I will use this recipe frequently as I know people will enjoy it and ask for the recipe.  :-)

Can you say awesome?!!! The only thing I did different was to add a touch of vanilla to the Cream Chesse and PB mixture. They came out perfect at 33 minutes in my oven. Made these 2 hours ago and now only 1/4 pan exists! Love them!

Very good brownies. I followed another reviewers advice and used 1 c. peanut butter and another 1/4 c flour. I also used just under 3/4 c of the butter as some reviewers felt they were greasy. I found the amount of butter I used to be plenty. I added only 1 1/2 c of sugar, which I thought tasted great but if you like SWEET brownies don't do this! I did not measure out a cup of the chocolate mixture, but just left several TBS in the bowl and then added them on top to swirl in. All and all really good!

DEEEELICIOUS! I cut back the butter by a half stick based on other's reviews. They were sooooo good. Did I mention how good they were? All of them were gone in like 20 minutes. I didn't find them too greasy at all. Make these!

UPDATE: ONE OF MY HUSBAND'S CO-WORKERS COMMENTED THAT THESE WERE THE BEST BROWNIES SHE'S EVER HAD. DAYS LATER, SHE MADE THE SAME COMMENT (AND REQUESTED THAT I MAKE ANOTEHR BATCH!). Mmmmm! Simply delicious, decadent and RICH!!! My chocolate craving has been satisfied, albeit for a price.... These are LOADED with fat (2 sticks of butter - whoa!), but the guilty pleasure is WELL worth it lol! Despite other's opinions, these need NO enhancements to make them perfect OR better. The balance of PB and chocolate is right on. I pretty much followed Michelle's directions to the letter except for two small changes. I lined my (stoneware) baking dish with aluminum foil to make removal / clean-up easier and only reserved a 1/2 c. worth of my chocolate mixture to "swirl" on top (perfect!). I had no problem spreading the PB layer (there was PLENTY of it) or swirling the chocolate. It took 35 minutes for my brownies to test "almost" done, but I wish I would have let them bake for at least 40 minutes. After cooling for 1.5 hours (I couldn't wait!), I cut my brownies and the middle ones were a tad too soft-set for my liking. Perhaps they needed to cool longer to firm up??? Because these are so sweet, I ended up cutting each square into half triangles, so the brownies that didn't turn out weren't missed at all. :) I can't wait to hear what my husband's co-workers have to say about these tomorrow! Thanks for sharing, MISSMR94! :-)

I was searching for an EASY twist on the classic red box of brownies...this recipe is IT! I followed the usual directions for boxed brownies, then made the peanut butter marbled topping and swirled it on top. No changes needed - it was moist and delicious! I took these to a party and none were left! YUM-O!

This recipe was the very best.  We absolutely loved them.  They are rich, but oh so good.  I mailed them to my son for his birthday.  They survived very well.  He also thought they were great.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Really good.  I used less butter, as some other reviewers suggested.  Also, I made with a gluten-free flour mixture, and they turned out fine.  They were a little on the fudgy side; I don't know if that was from the flour mixture, my underbaking them, or if they always turn out that way.  But they were good!

I prefer a more chewy brownie so this wasn't was not what I was looking for.  It also needed a bit more peanut butter.

These brownies were fantastic! I received so many compliments. Similar to what previous reviews said, I cut the butter by half a stick (so 1.5 stick in total) and I didn't put aside a full cup of the chocolate batter to layer on top of the peanut butter. I only saved about 5 tablespoon's worth of the chocolate batter and placed them on the peanut butter layer in different areas. I wanted the marbling to be distinctive and this worked out great.

Awesome brownies! I used 8 oz cream cheese, only 1/2 cup butter, 1 small container of applesauce, and dark chocolate cocoa powder. I couldn't stop eating these!

it all started at sarku japan. the lady was already asking me what i wanted to eat when i was literally fifty feet away from her.  she had my tray ready, complete with napkins and utensils.  i realized that what i wanted was not teriyaki chicken, but michelle's peanut butter marbled brownies.  so, i hurried to target to buy all the necessary ingredients to prepare this delicacy.  when i arrived at home, i wasted no time in preparing for this escapade of a lifetime.  once i took it out of the oven, i was marveled by the delicious scent and couldn't wait to indulge in its sweetness.  i was speechless once i took that first bite.  i recommend this dish to everyone in the universe.  i went back to sarku japan, and offered the lady a sample of the dessert, and she was just flabbergasted.  what a day.  caution: salt may squeak.

I didn't like these at all surprisingly... they had a very pretty outcome but the taste just wasn't for me. there was something weird with how the peanut butter and chocolate coincided.

These brownies are exactly what I was looking for.  I made them according to the recipe with no changes, using real butter.  They were not greasy or too sweet.  They're very rich and very fudgy, just like a brownie should be.  They would be fantastic served with some ice cream and hot fudge.

These brownies are THE ABSOLUTE BEST!  Took to my MOPS mtg and they got rave reviews!  I didn't change a thing except use mini chocolate chips and had to bake an extra 12 minutes.  My mixture was a bit thick and I had to just drop dollops on top of the peanut butter mixture and "spread" with my finger...there was no 'swirling' about it.  Regardless, these were the BEST brownies I have had.  I think tonight I'll warm one up in the microwave and top with some vanilla ice cream!  YUMMMM!

These brownies are absolutely amazing.  I was looking for a peanut butter / chocolate combination brownies.  The chocolate is really intense and the peanut butter is mild, it does not take over the brownie.  They are moist.  Best when cooled or the next day.  They cooked up perfect!!  A definate 10*

This recipe is good- with a lot of adjustments!

It is true that there is FAR to much butter I used 1/2 C butter, and they were still abit on the greasy side, however I think they were about right brownies are supposed to be greasy.

When preparing only use a few bits of the chocalate batter, use a small sppon and dollop it on in 6 spots, then use a butter knife and go in a zig-zag hitting every spot then swirl it some more!

Enjoy these as a great treat!

AMAZING. I live at 9,200 feet above sea level, so I used my own brownie recipe and swirled this peanut-buttery goodness on top, and it was SPECTACULAR. Like a Reese's cup but in brownie form!

Good recipe, got a lot of favorable comments, but I wasn't really happy with how the marbling of the peanut butter came out. The mix was too thick to get it to look right, next time I'll just layer the brownies.

These brownies are amazing!  Easy recipe to make and a big fit with the family.  If one isn't a fan of peanut butter, the brownie part would be excellent by itself.

Not impressed.  The brownie part was too cakey and bland...no wow factor.  I did increase the peanut butter for the topping and still did not find it all that flavorful.  I didn't get the "richness" that many reviewers described.

Although this recipe could use a few minor changes in order to be awesome, it's a pretty darn good recipe as is. I didn't want to make a huge pan of brownies because there's only two people in my household. So I decreased the serving size down to 24 instead of 36 and used a 7"x11" pyrex pan. However, I kept the peanut butter topping recipe at the original serving size since other reviewers said it could use more peanut butter. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. I would typically use butter in my baked goods, but I didn't have enough so I used half butter and half margarine. I used the full amount called for and the brownies turned out great - not greasy at all! I sprayed my pan with canola oil and lined it with some parchment for easy de-panning. I didn't have any trouble at all with the marbling, but I do have experience with the technique. I ended up with about a half inch of brownie on bottom and a quarter inch of peanut butter swirl on top: perfect ratio! I baked mine for 40 minutes, and I definitely don't think they needed any more time in the oven - maybe even less. The only change I might make next time is to add another egg to the brownie base to make them a bit more fudgy instead of cakey, but they were good none-the-less. I wouldn't leave out the chocolate chips as some other reviewers have; I think the brownies needed the little bursts of straight chocolate in order to balance out the peanut butter taste. Great recipe!

I really liked the brownie part of these. They were really moist and chocolaty. A lot of reviewers said there was too much butter, so I only used 1/2 cup and also added 1/4 cup of applesauce. The peanut butter part was good, but it didn't have enough peanut butter flavour. Next time I'll double the peanut butter.

Spectacular combination of chocolate and peanut butter!  Fat overload but so worth it, oh my!  I made a couple small changes: used an 8-oz brick of cream cheese and increased the peanut butter to about a cup.  Yum!

I thought this was yummy, but not what I was expecting from the reviews:( I thought the cream cheese/peanut butter texture didn't go well with the brownie at all.  But the taste was nice.  .......I followed the recipe exactly besides adding a bit more peanut butter.

I loved these brownies.  I wasn't very good at making them look marbled (a.k.a. pretty), but they sure tasted great.  I made the reciped as is, but I agree with some other reviewers that it's totally better the next day.  When I make this again, I'm going to make it a day ahead.

These were extremely rich, even with reduced-fat ingredients. If you're looking for a 50/50 peanut butter and chocolate combination, this isn't it. These were chocolate brownies with just a hint of peanut butter. I'd recommend either doubling or tripling the peanut butter if you're looking for something more peanut buttery. To reduce the fat in these, I made them with reduced fat cream cheese, reduced fat peanut butter, and applesauce in place of the butter. Instead of setting aside a cup of batter for the swirling, I set aside only a few tablespoons, which I still felt was too much. Mine were quite fudgy (to be honest, they were more fudge-like than brownie-like.) I suspect that some people are overcooking them, resulting in more cake-like brownies, since I read several reviews of people leaving them in 15+ minutes longer than the cook time calls for. Don't forget about carry-over cooking. Your brownies will still cook for several minutes after you take them out of the oven, especially when they're in materials that are made to keep heat, like stoneware. I took mine out at 35 minutes, and after they cooled, they were perfect.

These were great!  The only thing I changed was the amount of butter, and sugar.  I reduced the butter to 3/4 c and the sugar to 1 1/2 c.  I think they would have come out too sweet and greasy otherwise.  I will definately make these again and again.:)

Yummy. I doubled the peanut butter and only put about 1/4cup of the choc batter on top.  It turned out great!  The peanut butter part pooled a little oil on top but I was able to pat it with a paper towel and it was fine.  Might try reduced fat next time to see if it helps.  I'll definitely be making this again.

These browies are very good and very easy! They are not too sweet but still very rich. I only used a 1/2 cup (1 stick) of margarine after reading the other reviews and they turned out great.

WOW!! These should come with a warning label.  I just made them and am now nursing a burnt mouth because I couldn't resist trying them before they had completely cooled.  The tastes combine really nicely without either overpowering the other.  Easy to follow recipe and a super nice chewy brownie texture.  Thanks so much for sharing ... I'm not sure that I will be sharing the first pan with anyone else :-)

These were great.  I made them for a party and got a lot of positive comments.  My husband told me that these brownies "rocked."  They do require a little bit more work and it's difficult to create the marbled look because the batter is so thick.  BUT... we thought the taste and texture was excellent.  I will definitely hang onto this recipe.

Absolutely delicious!  Followed recipe exactly (very unusual for me)!  As for the ingredients listed here I used natural peanut butter, low fat cream cheese and Hershey's Special Dark chocolate morsels - all because that's what I had on hand.  Thought I was having trouble with the marble effect because the batter was a bit thicker than I expected, but they came out looking as good as they taste...which is fantastic!  Read some of the other reviews that said their's came out cake-like - mine did not.  They were definitely perfect fudgy brownies underneath the peanut butter/marble layer, not too gooey and definitely not cakey.  My only thought is that if you run the knife through ALL layers you might end up incorporating the cream cheese mixture throughout and end up with a more cake-like bar...(which sounds good to me, too!)  I was careful just to swirl the dollops of chocolate batter on top with the cream cheese mixture (not putting the knife all the way through to the bottom layer) and it came out perfectly.  Love it!

This was a nice recipe!  But I made some changes that will save TONS of time and energy! 
I bought two boxes of ghirardelli brownies and combined the ingredients on the box as it read to do.  Then I put half of the mixture (or one box) into a pan, made the creamcheese/peanut butter part of this recipe and put it on top of the first layer of brownies... the obviously followed with the second box of brownies! YUMMY!
Next time I'm going to leave out the peanut butter and just do a cheesecake sort of flavor between the brownies!

These were pretty good and very easy to make.  I would add more peanut butter next time.

These are heavenly!!! The first time I made them I wasn't too happy with the results, but that was my fault. When I made them again, I doubled the peanut butter mixture (you only get this millimeter thick layer if you don't) and substituted the butter for yogurt. My mother won't eat them anymore because they upset her stomach they're so rich!

Not as great as I expected, but still good nonetheless.  Next time, I will save time and use a boxed brownie mix for the brownie part.  I will also use more peanut butter.  These were a big hit at our cookout!

the only way that someone could dislike these brownies would be to lack tastebuds.  I have made them upwards of ten times and they go fast! while the brownie recipie provided is great, if you're in a rush, using a box brownie mix (which I usually hate doing) is compensated for by the amazing peanut butter mixture.

The only thing I did different was to add about 3/4 cup peanut butter.  These are sooo good! My husband who isn't much on sweets raved about them!

The flavor is really good on these, but we would have liked more of the peanut butter mixture.  Next time I will double that part.

I am giving these 4 stars, because after exactly 35 minutes in my oven, the edges were burned.  I have to throw all of the edges away because they're way too overdone.  And these brownies are very rich- almost too rich for me.  I think it's the peanut butter-cream cheese combo.  I once made a choco/peanut butter cheesecake that was too rich for me to eat, and this is the same kind of thing.  They are good though, as long as you have plenty of milk to go with them!  Like some other reviewers I cut down a few TBS. on the butter.  I also used peanut butter chips in place of semisweet.  Next time I would leave out the chips altogether, as it's almost too much.

This is an awesome and different recipe for brownies.  They are the perfect texture and not too sweet.  I baked them for 40 minutes and they were perfectly done.  This is a keeper for us--it will be a family favorite.  I can't wait to take it to a party or potluck and share it with others!

Very yummy.  A little bit of work to make but well worth it.  I needed a bake sale recipie and this was just perfect! NOT cakey at all.  The only thing was i didn't add the chocolate chips and used regular cocoa powder instead of semisweet.

My husband LOVES all things peanut butter and chocolate and he gave this one a thumbs up.  I went the "cheater" route and used a doctored brownie mix - that's the way to go when you are in a hurry!  I will make these again.

Very rich, moist, and fudgy.  I am a true CHOCOHOLIC, but I would have liked more of a peanut butter taste.  I even added 1/3 cup of peanut butter chips and cut back on the choc chips.  I may try adding more peanut butter next time and cutting out the choc chips totally.  I did take the advise of cutting butter back to 3/4 cup and I do agree they are much better chilled.

I made these brownies for guests who LOVE peanut butter chocolate.  They did not pass the test.  Unfortunately, I was left with almost an entire pan left over!  They were very moist and tasted okay.  HOwever, If you are going to make a home-made brownie, it better be fabulous!

I over cooked my first batch (my oven tends to run too hot. So while I only baked them for 35 min, the knife came out clean. The middle wasn't still slightly gooey the way I'm used to), but these turned very good, the inside very moist and chewy depite. Also, since I read a few people say they were too greasy, I cut the butter back to 3/4 cup, which didn't seem to effect them at all. I also used milk chocolate chips. 

All in all, pretty good. I wasn't wowed by them, but will probably make them again. Next time I'll be sure to cut the cooking time back.

I made these one night when I was having a chocolate craving.  Boy did they hit the spot!  Rich and moist.  I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe.  I only changed one thing:  rather than using the semisweet chocolate, I substituted milk chocolate.

I used a boxed brownie mix and added chocolate chips...but the end result was fabulous (I also added peanuts into the cream cheese mixture).  We enjoyed them better chilled rather than room temp.  Will make again.

This recipe may require a little extra time to make but it's well worth it. I carried a batch to work and they disappeared in minutes. Substitute 4oz of unsweetened chocolate for the cocoa powder for richer fudge taste!

These brownies were delicious!!!  Followed the recipe to the letter. Yummy!!! For reviewers who need help marbling, no need to reserve any of the brownie batter. Just spoon dollops of the peanut butter cream cheese mixture over the top of the brownies. Take a butter knife and drag it through the dollops and top layer of brownie batter.

I agree with another reviewer: greasy. This is not a brownie you want to eat with your hands--I did and I wanted to wash them immediately afterwards. Also, these should be baked for an additional 10-15 minutes. I put mine in for 45 minutes, tested with a toothpick--and since I was going by what the directions say: 'almost clean'--and took them out, and I'm not convinced they were set. Anyway, all that to say my husband loved them, my in-laws loved them--it was just me sitting back and thinking they could have been better with the changes listed. Great taste, though!

after reading other reviews I did add about 1/4 c more of peanut butter, I also did not have creamy so I used crunchy and the  brownies turned out fine.  I was concerned beause the batter was so thick but the brownies baked with no issues.

My family LOVED this recipe and was hanging around the kitchen with hungry eyes, just hoping to to lick the batter! I was out of chocolate chips so I substituted 1/2 c. of Ghiradelli Intense Dark 72% Pure Cocao dark chocolate squares (broken into small chunks)and 1/2 c. of Hershey's chocolate syrup. DIVINE!! The recipe makes a very thick brownie. It pulled away from the edges of the pan beautifully and was crispy on the edges but MOIST. Will definitely be making this one again.

These worked well & came out nicely. They were chocolaty & had a good texture but I would have liked the peanut butter flavour to be a bit more intense. However, the boxful that I took to church disappeared very quickly & someone asked me for the recipe because 'they were the best thing she has ever tasted'!

This recipe makes the BEST brownies I have ever tasted in my life!  If you don't want peanut butter, try leaving it out and using just the chocolate recipe.  This is SO good.  Just the way a brownie is supposed to be.

These are sooo good! I made the Baker's One Bowl Chocolate Brownies (Baker's Brand Chocolate)and then added the peanut butter mixture from this recipe to it. My family loved them too!

I love peanut butter and cream cheese but the way they were paired here was not a good combo for my taste. The brownie portion was fudgy and very moist. Again the flavor was not what I was expecting. I would say give it a try, the flavor was not what I expected so I will not make again.

These were super sweet. I made one alteration to the recipe, I used the entire 8 oz package of cream cheese and I'm glad I did! There was barely enough to cover the 9x13. Next time I'll add a little more peanut butter too.. and cut some of the sugar. Hope this helps :)

Delicious and easy to make! I used fat free cream cheese and milk chocolate chips as this was what I had on hand. I had to cook it for 40 minutes before it was cooked through. This was my first attempt at homemade brownies and I am thrilled at how well they turned out!!!

Really needed a chocolate fix today, and my kids love peanut butter and chocolate, so we decided on this recipe.  Only problem - there's only 4 of us, and the pan is almost empty.  I definately got my fix.  These are delicious and are a classic peanut butter, chocolate combination.  Great!

My 19 y.o. son came home for a couple of days and he and his 20 y.o. sister made these two days in a row. Everyone loved them that much! They followed the directions exactly both times, with the exception of backing the cook time down 5 min the second time. Although both were delicious, the second batch was less cake like and they liked them more this way. Obviously a repeat in our house. Thanks for sharing!

I didn't eat these, not a peanut butter or chocolate fan, but I made them for people who are and they RAVED. I gave 1/2 to my MIL for Mother's Day and my husband and daughter got the other 1/2. Made them Saturday and they were almost gone by Sunday evening. Thank you!

To start with, the brownie batter was very nice, easy to work with, as was the peanut butter/cream cheese mixture; however mixing the two nicely was a little more difficult than I anticipated.   After making the brownies and allowing them to cool fully, I found the brownie itself to be very nice, but the peanut butter mixture was laking in the peanut butter for my taste. I found it more like a cheese cake brownie.   I am giving it three stars, because the brownie was quite nice and I may make it again, but instead I will just use plain peanut butter. So three stars because I will be altering it.   But thank you for sharing.

I gave them a 4 star because although I thought they were delicious, I think they could be more peanut buttery.  Therefore next time will try more peanut butter and peanut butter chips instead of chocolate chips.  But all in all so moist and everyone I got to try them thought they were fabulous.  Very rich!

Oh my goodness. These are absolutely the best brownies ever. I wasn't sure because of the cream cheese but these were fantastic. I only cooked mine for 30 minutes so they will still be alittle bit moist in the middle. This recipe is definately a keeper for my family. Thanks for the great recipe.

i made this receipe a little healthier and it came out excellent!  i replaced the margarine with apple sauce, i used a cup and a half brown sugar instead of 2 cups, i used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1/4 cup white flour, and replaced the 3 eggs with mashed banana.  also, i added some pecans in between the layers.   it turned out great.  the peanut butter taste is not too strong (which i liked, and i think my husband will like it, too.)

Very, very good. For my own tastes I'll increase the preanut butter for a bigger punch of flavor, but I got rave reviews on these and really enjoyed them as-is. I didn't have a problem with the amount of butter: I think all the ratios are perfect, one of the best scratch brownies I've ever made. It fills the 13x9 pan with a great thick brownie, which is rare - usually they're too thin for my tastes in the larger pan. Thanks so much for sharing :)

These are probably the best brownies I have had to date!  I actually forgot the chocolate chips, but I don't think I would use them.  They were the perfect, soft & chewy consistency without them, and I think with them it would be too gooey.  Usually brownies are almost too chocolatey for me.  I think the peanut butter toned this down a bit without making them taste too much like peanut butter.  Definitely 5 stars!

These brownies were great, i took the advice of others and only added 3/4C of margerine. I also added about 3/4C peanut butter chips in addition to the chocolate chips the recipe called for.  However, i needed to cook these brownies for 1H 30min (approx) and the toothpick still came out sticky, but all in all they were fudgy and great.  My family (who LOVE choco and peanut butter) really liked them! I will make them again for sure!

Not bad. I don't know if the recipe was worth making again but good for last night. The egdges of mine were burnt to a crisp cooked at the  right temp for shorter time frame. May retry in a few weeks.

I made these gluten-free by substituting the flour for a gluten-free baking flour mix.  Some of my family members eat gluten-free diets and everyone loved these! They didn't last long.

These brownies are fantastic! Everyone should try these brownies at least once in life.  I did bake them for a little longer than the recipe stated.  I would highly recommend everyone try these.

So...to be honest, i probably shouldn't be rating this as a baker... As an eater of these treats, OH MY WORD! They are absolutely sinful! I shared the recipe with a friend, she made them the following night. She followed it exactly, and they were PHENOMENAL brownies! I am excited to make them myself :) I dare ya to eat just one...even if they are rich!

Best Peanut Butter Brownies I have ever had. Sold them at a bake sale and people were actually coming to my table throughout the day saying they heard how amazing they were and wanted to try them. Don't mess with it, the recipe is perfect.

These are really good!! I used 1/2 the sugar for the batter and it was just sweet enough....not too rich and not too sweet. I also added pecans to half of the batter for the nut lovers!

YUMMY!!! I followed the recipe exactly and the result was great.
The only thing I changed, I did not swirl the cup of batter on top, but threw it over the cake just as it was, in spoonfuls. The peanut butter is not too overpowering, which is fine for me. I'll keep this!

Thank you for this recipe, they were wonderful.  After reading some reviews, I doubled the amount of peanut butter and made sure I only swirled the remaining cup of batter into the peanut butter layer and not all the way through to the bottom.  Moist and Rich! I am not trying them with the frosting next time, they are perfect as is.

I loved the taste of these brownies, they came out so moist and not too rich!  The only problem was with the swirling of the cup of chocolate batter.  It definitely would have come out a lot prettier if not for that, one cup of batter was way too much.

These are fine brownies, but I don't know if they're good enough to add to my recipe collection.  I cooked them according to the directions, taking them out of the oven when a toothpick came out nearly clean, but they seemed overcooked after they cooled.  They're also a bit too cakelike and not sweet enough for me.  The peanut butter layer was thicker than the chocolate layer, so it didn't spread easily over the top.  However, that wasn't much of an issue once they were swirled together.  These brownies have only a very slight peanut butter taste, which I liked, but some people might like to add more peanut butter.

These turned out very well. I cut the butter down by just a tablespoon and they were not greasy at all. I would recommend these to anyone.

I made these basically according to the recipe (I used slightly less melted margarine and they turned out fine). My only other change was that I only kept out about a half cup or so for the marbling. So, very minor changes.  These brownies were fantastic.  Absolutely awesome. I'm planning to make them again just as soon as I have enough people to share them with! I brought them to class with me (I teach at a small heritage language school on the weekends) and they were all wolfed down. A+ - highly recommended.

These brownies are extremely rich! Unfortunately for me, the brownies are very cake-like (not my favorite), but my guests liked them. I didn’t get too much of a peanut-buttery taste, so if I make them again, I’ll add more peanut butter. Thanks, Michelle!

Delicious!  These were easy to make and turned out wonderfully.  Based on other reviewers' comments that they weren't quite peanut-buttery enough, I increased the PB by 3 oz (to just over 3/4 cup) and eliminated 3 oz. of cream cheese.  This made them the perfect amount of peanut buttery.  They were a huge hit!  I will definitely use this recipe again and pass it on.

YUMMMMM...the best combination---chocolate, peanut butter and cream cheese.  I have been getting alot of compliments on these.  Didnt change the recipe---made exactly as written.  I only wish it didn't call for so much butter, as it is not cheap!

Excellent.  I followed the directions exactly and they turned out great.  Mine were done after 32 minutes.  Like some of the other reviewers, I prefer a bit more of a peanut butter flavor.  I substituted the 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate morsels /w 1 cup of Nestle's peanut butter & chocolate morsels.

These were pretty darn good--rich chocolate laced with peanut butter, what's not to love? I recommend turning down the heat a bit though--mine were barely cooked in the middle and the outside edge was burnt.

These are good. As with most things that have a "cheesecake-like" element to them, they are better after they have cooled and set for awhile.

These were fantastic. I used boxed brownie mix for the brownie portion (short on time) - and they were fabulous. I did them in a 9 X 11 pan - with a doubled recipe. I added about a 1/2 cup more peanut butter for a stronger peanut butter taste. They were a hit at my company picnic!

I made these recently for a family gathering and everyone loved them. As several other reviewers suggested, I used a full cup of peanut butter and they turned out fantastic. I am making a double batch this weekend for a function at my daughter's school. Thanks so much for the recipe!

Yummy!  Very good brownies, not greasy at all like other reviewers said.  I too used one 8 oz pkg of cream cheese for convenience and just put in a little extra sugar and peanut butter.

These brownies were amazing.  The only thing I changed was to use 8 oz of cream cheese (easier!) and used a generous 1/2 cup of peanut butter to make up for using a little extra cream cheese.  So delicious and moist, and the whole house smelled heavenly when they were baking.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe - it is a keeper!!

Wow!!! These brownies are DELICIOUS!  I only saved about half a cup of the chocolate mixture to put on top of the peanut butter and it was just enough to get a pretty marble effect going on the top. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and baked for about 3 extra minutes because they were still gooey in the middle after 35.  People were talking about them hours after they disappeared at work, will definitely make again!

Rich. rich, rich.  These are awesome brownies.  I was craving chocolate and PB and I love anything that includes cream cheese.  These were perfect.  But almost too good.  I had to give over half the pan to my husband to take to work, so they would not be in the house with me!  Several people have requested the recipe!!  I'm sure that I will make these again!

These are so-o-o-o good.  I reduced the cream cheese to 4 oz (1/2 of a box) and added a bit more peanut butter.  These are thick and rich and delicious.  My guests emptied the pan on Sunday and a day later I'm making them again for another party.  Fabulous.

Yum!  I thought these brownies were sooo good and fairly easy to make.  I used a mixture of peanut butter and chocolate chips.  Next time, I will increase the amount of the peanut butter/cream cheese mixture.

I made these for my Aunt's birthday last night and she thought she had died and gone to heaven.  The only change I made was I added an extra spoonful of PB to make sure it had a good flavor -- and it did!  Also, almost all of the homemade brownies recipes I have tried have been "greasy", as some described these.  I guess it is pretty standard.  If you chill these they aren't too bad.

These brownies were delicious!  The brownie part was just how I like it, super fudgy, dense, moist, and VERY chocolatey!  My sister and I made them this morning, and we added peanuts to the peanut butter mixture.  My only complaint is that the brownies were not peanut-buttery enough.  If I hadn't made them myself I don't know if I even would have known that they were supposed to be PB.  But heck, the brownies were so darn delicious that that made up for everything.  I'll most definitely be making these again.  These are not just your average brownies!

I added a combo of milk chocolate and peanut butter chips instead of the semi-sweet and I'm glad I did.  I thought the chocolate bottom needed to be sweeter still though.  For me it was a little blah.  The peanutbutter/creamcheese combo is great and does add a nice twist!  I'll give them another try and see how they turn out.

Pretty good! 4.5 stars!! I added about 1 cup peanut butter chips to the peanut butter mixture and it was a nice touch. Overall a nice brownie.  Good served warm with ice cream on top! Had a little trouble getting the middle to bake completely, and the edges got a touch overdone, but otherwise not too bad!

Incredible! I also cut the butter back to 3/4 cup and I added 1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chunks to the chocolate batter and 1/2 cup peanut butter morsels to the peanut butter batter. We're visiting my Dad in the mountains, elevation 9100 ft, so I baked them for 50 minutes and they came out chewy and delicious.  If I were home I might have cut back on the time a bit.  The top was lightly brown but soft.  Really beautiful and tasty recipe, thank you!

The chocolate part was good but I did not like the peanut butter cream cheese topping - it was too tart and cheesey. Also, you can just drop the peanut butter on the top and still get a nice pattern. Run lines both horizontally and vertically to get a nice, even marbled surface.

These are awesome!  I didn't alter the ingredients at all, but I made things easier on myself by not reserving part of the chocolate mixture to put on top of the peanut butter mixture.  Either way, they look wonderful and taste even better.  I took these to work and they were gone before lunch time!

These are delicious!  The only thing I will do differently next time is instead of reserving a cup of the browning batter, just pour it all in the pan at once, then add peanut butter mixture on top.  I couldnt spread the filling very well, so it didn't really marble the brownies evenly.

I was excited about the receipe after reading the reviews, however I was dissapointed in the taste.  It was too dense and heavy of a brownie for my taste.

Very tasty brownies.  I had to make two batches because I fell asleep while the first batch was cooking, but I am glad that I started over. Definitely worth it.

I do not even need to try another peanut butter brownie recipe!  This one is heaven.  For a party that I'm catering the host made this one top priority.  Everyone swooned over these.  I added peanut butter chips to the peanut butter swirl.  I recommend trying that-it is even yummier.  Thanks so much Michelle!

These are awesome.  They are a nice change to my cream cheese brownies and the peanut butter is a great combination with the chocolate. I was pressed for time so I used a boxed brownie mix but they still came out great.  I can't wait to share this recipe with the girls at work.  Next time I will try using Michelle's brownie recipe.  Thanks, this one is a definite keeper!

Incredible!  To save a few calories, I used light cream cheese (70 cal/oz), light peanut butter (100 cal/2 Tbsp), egg substitute (30 cal/"egg"), and light margarine (50 cal/Tbsp).  Also, instead of chocolate chips, I used chunks of Butterfinger candy bar.  Everything about these was wonderful!  I have always made brownies from a box - I will never do that again, if I can help it!

These came out perfect! I used a cube and a half of butter and set aside 1/2 a cup of the chocolate filling for the swirl design instead of a full cup. Definitely making these again, they are a hit!

I have been making these for years now. I get requests for my "crack brownies" by many. My son even wanted these for a graduation present. I have, over the years, tweaked it, but know this, as they are, is fantastic. I purposely undercook so they are ooey-gooey in the middle. 350 for 30min. in a glass 9x13. I cut back on sugar, just a little, and even out the peanut butter and cream cheese portions. Other than my few secrets to personalize it, these are the best ever. :)

I loved this recipe! It's delicious especially if you like the chocolate/peanut butter combination. My only suggestion would be to set aside less than 1 cup of chocolate batter, if any for the top swirls. 1 cup is too much, it basically completely covers the peanut butter, so it's not very pretty. Also, I made these without chocolate chips the first time and I liked it a lot better, but that's only my personal preference :)

I've made these several times now and they are always a crowd-pleaser. You'll be pretty popular if you bring them to a party. Delicious! Once I combined both batters together and baked them as cupcakes, then put mini Reese cups on top. Turned out great either way!

Pretty good recipe, made in mini square brownie pans, so everyone gets the edge which is my favourite. Didn't layer, but swirled the peanut butter on top.

These are delicious. I did make a few modifications after reading reviews. I added 1/4 cup of flour and extra peanut butter. I think the marble effect is prettier with more pb mixture. They turned out perfect. I've already been asked to make more.

My go to for peanut butter/chocolate brownies.  I will say you don't need to separate the cup of chocolate to get marbleized effect.   Just spread peanut butter mixture on top  and swirl.   Very rich brownie.

I substituted applesauce for the butter and added 3 ounces more cream cheese (by accident) and these turned out really good. Very moist. My hubby likes peanut butter and couldn't really taste it so next time I may add a bit more.

Great recipe, everyone loved these brownies. Only change I made was adding an additional 1/4 cup of peanut butter. For those who says it is too greasy, I did not find this to be a problem, I think using real butter helps. I've had several requests for the recipe and to make them again.

The best brownies I have ever made.  Perfect even on the outside edges.  I did increase the flour slightly (to 1 1/2 cup) as the batter seemed too wet.  Otherwise very easy to make and enjoy!

These were good, but I thought the brownie would have a bit more chocolate flavor.  I took the advice of others and only used 1/2 cup of butter, which was plenty.

The recipe was ok, but took longer than expected to take, and then the edges became overdone. The overall texture is a lot different than I anticipated. I think I will add more peanut butter next time, and maybe some nuts and peanut butter chips

Delicious! I only had to modify it slightly to fit into the Perfect Brownie pan, which is smaller than 9 x 13", meaning I reduced the flour and sugar ratio by one quarter, if that makes sense. Didn't want to overflow the Perfect Brownie pan.

Very good but quite heavy.  The dough was so stiff I did have trouble marbleing.  Sometimes I do add peanut butter chips to my brownies, and that requires a lot less effort.

High altitude bakers is recipe is great. I live in the mountains of Colorado and it worked great. The edges came out a little tougher, but that happens with every brownie recipe I've ever tried. The taste was great. It was like a basic brownie with peanut butter cheesecake mix in it. It was rich and very good. I made it for my brother in-law's birthday and everyone enjoyed it very much. So for anyone that lives above sea level might want to try this one out.

These brownies are excellent but not enough peanut butter taste. Like many others, I have modified the recipe to add a very generous 1 cup peanut butter, up the cream cheese to 8 oz, and added peanut butter chips in as well.

Very good! Gone very quickly even though they never made it from a pan to a plate. Too much peanut butter/cream cheese mixture to make it look marbled but nobody seemed to care. Definitely half the butter amount or else it's too greasy. Overall very good though!

Not too terribly impressed with how this recipe turned out. The chocolate part was a little too cakey and blah, and the peanut butter part was severely lacking in peanut butter taste. I would definitely double the amount of peanut butter next time, and do something (not sure what) to the chocolate part. Frosting them with a chocolate frosting saved them a little.

Very good.  I increased the peanut butter and decreased the butter and these were delicious.  I like cakey brownies, not fudgey ones, and that's what these were.

Words cannot describe how amazing these brownies are! They were the absolute hit of the graduation party that we brought them to. They were incredibly moist, not cake like at all. The peanut buter layer was just as good, gooey, mosit and peanut buttery. I topped them off with Caroline's chocolate fudge frosting also from this site. And finally after chilling them to harden the frosting I cut them into squares and topped them with crumbled mini resee's peanut butter cups. They looked just a great as they tasted! I did change them just a little. Here's what I did: I used a whole 8 oz. brick of cream chese, upped the peanut butter to 2/3's cup, only added 3 Tbsp. suger to the PB batter, used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk, reduced the sugar to  1 1/2 cups in the brownie batter, used milk choc. chips instead of semi-sweet and baked them for 37 minutes exactly. After spooning on the reserved chocolate batter over the peanut butter layer be careful as you swirl it on top as not to cut into the peanut butter layer in order to get a nice layered effect with nice swirls on top. This is one of those, YOU MUST TRY recipes! Everyone wants a copy!

I just used an 8 oz package of cream cheese. In the cake, I had to use half brown sugar and half white sugar because I didn't have enough white sugar. I also added more peanut butter because some reviewers did and I love peanut butter, however, I think that the original amount of peanut butter would have been better. I baked it for 28 minutes, which was perfect. These brownies are absouloutly amazing. I will make them again, except with the original amount of PB and with all white sugar. They're pretty too, kind of hard to swirl. Thanks!

Delicious is an understatement. These things are SO good. I made more of the topping by upping the cream cheese to 8 oz. and the peanut butter to 3/4 c. I cut the butter to 2/3 c., the choc. chips to half a cup, and should have cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups. I put all the brownie batter in the pan, then spread on the p.b. layer and the swirled it. It came out quite pretty. And dense and fudgy and luscious.

Now THIS is the good stuff!  I did as the several other reviews suggested and used a whole 8 oz pkg of cream cheese.  Otherwise, I made them according to the recipe.  These were perfect.  Rich, chewy, chocolatey, peanut buttery, everything I wanted!  I sent a large plate to work with my husband and they got rave reviews there too.  Big hit.  I'll make these over and over again!

These brownies are a lot easier to make than what a lot of people are making it out to be.  I used 8 oz of cream cheese instead of 6 oz and it turned out wonderfully.  Great recipe.  This is sure to be a go to for me from now on.

I love this recipe! It's always a big hit at parties and is the first dessert to go!  I've made this a few times, and another similar recipe a few times, and for the life of me, I can't seem to get the peanut butter layer to be an actual "layer" on top of the brownie batter. I'm sure it's user-error, and not a problem with the recipe. It still tastes great, I just wish I could get the brownie to be prettier with the layer in the middle and the swirls on top. Oh well, no on notices because they are eating them so fast!  If you love chocolate and peanut butter, you will love this recipe! It's very easy to adjust the peanut butter or cream cheese to your liking!

I made these recently for a party; my husband thought it was not a "summer dessert", but I thought they sounded so good, I made them anyway. They were so well received! I added chopped walnuts - the brownies were moist and very delicious! I will make them again, summer or winter!

Absolutely delicious and so easy to make.  I cut the butter by 3 tablespoons and didn't miss it, used mini-morsels and dropped 12 tablespoons of the chocolate batter on top of the peanut butter layer to create the swirls and it created perfectly defined swirls while keeping a layer of the peanut butter in tact.

5 stars becaue they were really good! I thought they were too rich for me, but everyone else loved them. I thought the cream cheese mixture needed a little more peanut butter flavor, it tasted more like cream cheese than PB. The brownie part was awsome, I may try that solo next time with PB chips in it. Thanks!

These are awesome!  Followed the recipe as stated except I used a little more peanut butter and low fat cream cheese.  Excellent!  Nice and moist/fudgy.

Good, not spetacular. I guess I expected more of a peanut butter taste. I might make these again but decrease the cream cheese and increase the peanut butter. 35 mins was also to long at 350. 28-30 would suit it a little better

Holy cow! These are so rich! These are brownies you'll only want to make once a year, for your health, but they are incredible!! I think next time I might add a bit more flour to make them a little less fudgy, and maybe a bit more peanut butter. The peanut butter flavor wasn't as strong as I was hoping for, but they are still unbelievable, best brownies I've ever had!

These are...good, not great. Had to bake longer than stated. Not overly peanut-buttery, maybe like others I will frost them and see if that perks them up...and skip the reserved batter, that's just a mess.

I was looking for a peanut butter fudge brownie but this really turned out more cake-like.  Maybe it's because I used applesauce instead of butter, but this was not dense at all.  I agree with one of the other reviewers that it really needs frosting because of its cake-like texture.   I gave it a 3 because it also lacks a strong peanut butter flavor, even though I used 3/4 cup and slightly less cream cheese than the recipe called for.  A little bit of tweaking and I think this could be much better.

very good and very rich but not as popular as I thought they'd be at the 2 parties I brought them to (I would cut them smaller to combat the richness next time).  I took the advice of others and didn't measure out the chocolate to be swirled on top, just left a little in my batter bowl and then spooned it on top.
I'm not sure I'd make them again as I personally wished they had more of a peanut butter flavor.  they were fun to make though, I've never made brownies from scratch before and all in all I'd say they turned out very well.  thanks for sharing!

These were really good - I might leave out the chocolate chips next time just because my fiance didn't like them as much but I loved them.  I did take other reviewers' advice and didn't reserve the cup of batter.  I just layered the brownie mix then the peanut butter mixture and swirled it around and it turned out just fine.

These brownies were delicious. I used real butter not margarine and they were not greasy at all. I also took advice of some others and used less batter on top to swirl. I used only 1/2 cup.

Fantastic!!!! The best brownies ever! I a little over a 1/2 c. of butter as someone said they were greasy. I would have liked 3/4 c. butter. I think I substituted about a 1/2 cup of white wheat flour (or maybe not). Wheat flours surprisingly make fabulous brownies though. 

The PB was to die for.

These brownies were very disappointing. I followed the directions carefully, but even after leaving them in an extra 15 minutes, they still did not cook completely through. Besides that, the flavor was over powering and the cream cheese peanut butter concoction did not really compliment the strong cocoa-rich brownies. I will not make this recipe again.

I had no problem with the consistency of the brownies - the amount of butter is fine. I think it needs more peanut butter for flavor. Next time I make it I will follow my mother's rule with peanut butter and double it.

Next time I think I'll only reserve 1/2 c batter for swirling, just because I think they'd look even prettier... but they are to die for!  My go-to recipe from now on.  It helps that peanut butter and chocolate is my favorite flavor combination.

I followed the advice of ally as much as I could. I mixed the PB portion of the recipe with the frosting recipe from ally and that was my second layer. Once I spread the chocolate and then the PB layer and marbled, it was beautiful. But, even in my brand new oven it took about 15 minutes longer than suggested to set up. Great recipe though!

I was not impressed with these when they came out of the oven but the next morning they were fantastic!  I was an egg short so I only used 2 in the brownie batter this made them turn out more fudgy then cakey (which I love in a brownie). I only had 1/2 cup of chocolate chips so I also used 1/2 cup of hershy kisses other then that I followed the recipe exactly.

I liked this recipe, except I think I mixed it too much or something because my brownies turned out kind of cakey, not so fudgey. I didn't add the choc chips because I don't like that texture when you bite into one, just not my cup of tea. But because I didn't add the chips, I think it didn't turn out as chocolatey. So I'll be adding more cocoa next time I make these, to slightly over-power the peanut buttery taste.

I made this for a family cook out and the kids and some adults tore them up! There was another brownie recipe there, from a box and they chose this recipe over that one. They kept saying "these are soooo goood!" I used Blue Bonnet instead of butter or margarine, they turned out just fine. It's a good recipe, especially for the kiddies.

Thanks everyone for the comments and the tips I used less margarine and thought that it needed more peanut butter.  It turned out really good.  Everyone liked them, but cutting them was a bit of a mess.

This recipe is one of the best brownie recipes I've ever tasted!  They didn't last 48 hours in our house.  Very simple and delicious.

It's true, these brownies were definitely better the day AFTER baking them.  I changed the recipe a little from previous suggestions: I used 3/4 cup peanut butter, and 3/4 cup butter instead of the other amounts listed.  And I also used peanut butter/chocolate swirl chips.  They came out AMAZING!  Highly recommended.

I didnt think these would come out but after i tried one, i was blown away. My fiance complemented on them with out me asking how they were (thats HUGE). The only thing i changed was i cut the butter in half and and only used 1/2 cup instead of a cup, i read that the whole cup was to much. Thank you for the great brownies.

Mine were ok. I used 3/4 cup of Peanut Butter and cooked for as long as the recipe said. I felt like the brownies were a little too cake like and a little over cooked.

Amazing! I cooked them for about 10 minutes longer then what the recipe called for, and the brownies were still very liquidy so I put them in the fridge for a few hours. After they hardened, they were amazing! Like fudge! Also, I didn't bother with the marble swirl on the top. You don't need it.

After 40 minutes I went to take my brownies out of the oven, they didn't look no where near done. So, I cooked them 15-20 minutes longer. Still looked undercooked to me. But I could tell that they were starting to get over cooked on the edges. So, I sat the brownies on my counter top for two hours. I went back to it and tried a piece, still seemed doughy like to me and undercooked. Confused I placed it in the fridge. The next afternoon I pulled them out of the fridge and WOW! I had over cooked them, because the edges where hard. These are so much better the next day. I suggest that everyone place these in the fridge over night before eating them. Next time I won't cook them so long. Thanks for the great recipe.

I made these for a family party. My father-in-law really liked them. I personally didn't care for them, they were more of a semi-sweet brownie. I prefer more sweet milk chocolate tasting brownies.

I omitted the pb since some family members are allergic to it, but it still tasted great! I also substituted 1/2 of the white sugar for brown sugar, just to  make it fudgier and chewyier.

These were very good...the second day. When I tasted them the first day, they were only so-so. But on the second day they were delicious. Very fudgy and moist. I would have liked a little more peanut flavor. I may try reducing the amount of cream cheese and adding another 1/4 cup of peanut butter.

Delish. Made the recipe as written but in a smaller pan so they'd be thicker. Cooked them 43 minutes and they were perfect. Yummmmm.

I'm giving this five stars because the only negative reaction I had to these delectable brownies was from my mistake.  I used two 8oz blocks of cream cheese, which of course is WAY too much cream cheese.  You couldnt even really taste the peanut butter.  These still get 5 stars because the brownie part of the brownies were sooo fudgy and delicious.  I used Hershey's Special Dark cocoa which I think made all the difference.  Even with the cream cheese mistake, these didnt last long in my house!  Thanks for a great recipe.  Can't wait to try it with any mistakes.

I made these yesterday, and they turned out great. A very good texture and the cream cheese/ peanut butter blend was so creamy and sweet! However, the picture that goes with this recipe doesn't look quite right... what's that white layer? Anyhow, great recipe.

This recipe makes perfect mini brownies(baked in mini muffin pans for 10-12 mins.) You dallop the chocolate dough in first, followed by the peanut butter dough and put a tiny bit of chocolate dough on top. Very pretty and fun to eat! 
I've also tweaked the recipe, taking into account other reviewer's recommendations.  I used one (8 oz)pkg cream cheese, 2 c. PB, and 1 Tbs. vanilla for the peanut butter dough. To reduce the "fatty taste" I used 1 c. yougurt and 1/2 c. melted butter.

I didn't like the taste of the peanutbutter filling at all.  I would have rather used just straight peanut butter I think.  My 6 year-old liked them though, so all is not lost.

I didn't like this cake very much. The cocoa powder made it too dark and the cheese filling didn't "match" the cake, it felt out of place. Not particulary good.

These turned out great.  They were even tastier the next day. I always underbake brownies a bit because I like them chewy.

I was really disappointed in this recipe.  I didn't think the chocolate bit tasted of brownies (more of a gooey cake) and the peanut butter topping was a bit bland.  I guess I had really high expectations since the ratings were so high on this one.  Perhaps otherwise I'd have been more impressed.

Mmm, these were really good, and lots of people liked them. I halved the recipe, so I had to change the proportions a little bit (like one egg in each of the different mixtures) but it turned out great. The marbling effect came out really nicely - I just dropped teaspoonsful here and there, so you could see more peanut butter layer than chocolate on top. I've already been asked to make them again.

I like fudgey brownies.  Mine was definitely cakey and not so sweet and not so peanut buttery.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I cooked mine in a convection oven and they weren't done after 35 minutes.  I cooked them for another 7 mintues.  Maybe I should have taken them out after 35 minutes, but my knife came out gloppy, then.  I think this recipe might be better with more chocolate chips and peanut butter.

These were good brownies but not the best chocolate - peanutt butter brownies I have ever tasted. I would take everyone elses advise and not spread the chocolate over the top after the peanutbutter because it basically made the brownies all dark and not marbely looking. I also had to cook these for about 8 minutes longer than the recipe called for. Good consistency!

Delicious!  These are the perfect blend... not too cakd-like, but not so chewy you think they didn't cook enough.  I took some of the suggestions about needing more PB. I upped the amount to 3/4 cup, and if I do say so myself... they are perfect!  Thank you for this delicious recipe.

Great!! I baked them for 35 min. and the tooth pick came out clean, but they were still kind of chewy. Oh well, fine by me. The p.b. was subtle, but good.

My only tip is that I would use less than 1 cup, maybe 1/2 cup of the chocolate on top, or more p.b.

Thanks soo much Michelle!!

These brownies are some of the best I have ever made. Not sure why they turn out like cake for others. I think some  people may be over cooking them. When I made them I used a glass baking dish that was 8.5 in by 12.5 in. which may have made a difference since they would be slightly thicker. I found that the 40min wasn't long enough. Maybe 43 min and they were still super moist. My co-workers love these and complain everytime I bring them in because they know they won't be able to resist them and they are counting calories.

My hopes were definately for something different than what these were.  Upon mixing the peanut butter part,  I found that it seemed to have little or no taste, so I added a teaspoon of vanilla.  These brownies turned out to be cake-like brownies and the brownie part was flavorful. Although I added vanilla, the peanut butter part has little flavor. My preference tends to be for chewy brownies in which these were not. I won't likely make these again.

I cheated and made these with a mix - using the added chips and the peanut butter and cream cheese filling. They came out great! Next time, I'll try using Michelle's complete recipe, but I have to admit that they were pretty darn good and quick with the mix.

These were great but not quite 5 stars....These would be good for hot fudge brownie sundaes-as the chocoloate part is not too intense on the brownie but would pair nicely with all the extras that would come with a sundae...will make again for that purpose.

Very good, rich and chewy brownie (cakey brownie fans need not apply).  It looked nice swirled too, though if you want a filling (layers) taste don't swirl it.  Followed recipe exactly...and it was tasty!  Not too peanut buttery, if that's what you want go for something with more PB in it (recipes on this site) but for chocolate with touch of PB it's great.

These are so good.  The peanut butter filling is really subtle and really good.  Best brownies I've ever made from scratch.

I followed the recipe exactly, but the chocolate part was overpowered by the cocoa powder and not very sweet at all. I used Hershey's unsweetened cocoa powder- any idea what went wrong?

The chocolate brownie part tastes great, but the peanut butter part tasted a little too cheesy for me.

These brownies are delicious!  The peanut butter middle is nice and creamy!  I didn't alter the recipe at all and the cook time was perfect.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Yum, yum, yum.  Made these this past weekend for friends and they didn't last very long.  I'm not a great cook but these made me look like I am!  They were so moist and chewy; everyone loved them!

Loved them.  Perfect balance of chocolate and peanut butter.  Because one review said they were greasy, I cut back the butter by 2 Tbsp, and I didn't think they were greasy at all.  I don't understand how someone could think these were dry.  These are the dense moist kind of brownies, not the cake-like brownies.  I used 1/2 cup of milk choc. chips in the batter, as someone suggested, and added some peanut butter chips to the top.  The batter was a little thick to swirl, but not too bad.  Next time I will reserve 3/4 cup batter instead of 1 cup for the top.  They were so wonderful that I had a hard time controlling myself!  The best brownies I've ever made.

These were good, but I was expecting more of a distinct peanut butter taste.  Also, I received comments that they were a little dry.  I think if I make them again I will add more peanut butter or add peanut butter chips.  Thanks Michelle!

I can't begin to tell you how delicious these brownies are.  I have more requests from my friends, family, and coworkers for this dessert than anything else I bake.  Thank you Michelle!

These were very good!  I would have liked a little more of the cream cheese/peanut butter mixture, maybe I will double that part next time.  My mother-in-law begged for the recipe.

These brownies were great.  I loved them because the peanut butter is not too overwhelming.  I put chocolate cream cheese frosting on top...and they were so yummy!!!!

This is a very good brownie.  I used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet because I prefer the taste.  Fantastic chocolate and peanut butter flavor - neither flavor is overpowering.  Wonderful recipe.

I made these w/out the chips & reduced the amount of cream cheese & they were still out of this world.
