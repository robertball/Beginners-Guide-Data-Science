This recipe is so easy and so delicious.
Everyone at work said, "this is the best"
I did use a little bit more cream and I also used bittersweet chocolate.
Yum Yum

I made this pie for a small dinner party and it was wonderful.  I love the quick way that you melt the chocolate without a lot of clean up.  Plus, it's very quick and easy to put together.  Very yummy. I will definitely make this one again!!!
