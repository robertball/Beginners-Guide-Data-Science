Something is wrong with this recipe besides not indicating the temperature to cook it at.  I carefully measured all ingredients but the "batter" produced only fills about 1/3 of the pie shell??  There wasn't near enough batter.  The pie came out mottled and very ugly.  Taste wasn't good either. It went in the garbage.

I know this as a sugar pie. Grandma made these when I was little. The directions are pretty close to hers, only she covered the edges of the pie with a crust cover or foil to keep them from burning. For someone like me to make this pie and not fail, it's pretty much foolproof. Very comforting. I serve it with whipped cream or vanilla bean ice cream, Grandma was big on eating a slab for breakfast in a bowl with milk/cream. I suggest you make your own crust to make it even more decadent.

This isn't a chess pie, ive never seen one come out like this, although its very tasty. It taste more like a pecan pie without the pecans.

Very good. Mine turned out much lighter in color, which was a plus.
