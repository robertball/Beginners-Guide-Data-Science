I took this recipe to a friends home, and all the guests (4 other couples) also use AllRecipes, and we voted this recipe BEST OF SHOW!  Directions don't say what to do with the portobello mushrooms but we cut them in large bite sized pieces.  Also canned artichoke hearts can be really tough, so I recommend using jarred ones, drained.  This is a FOREVER KEEPER!

This was an Awesome meal!  Thank you for putting it on here!  I made this using all beef stock (1 cup) rather than using the brandy, and I used tenderized pork chops rather than chicken.  The flavors really mesh well together!  The tarragon is a nice complement to the artichokes...bravo!  I recommend this recipe to anyone wanting something different that is very easy to make.  I paired it with caramelized onions and red/orange bell peppers, and spinach almond brown rice, and the sauce went marvelously with the hole meal.  I will definitely make this again.

This was absolutely lovely as a imprompt company dinner.  I used good quality Italian style artichoke hearts because they generally have better taste than canned ones.  Grated fresh Parmesan cheese over the finished plates right before serving.  I also recommend trying it with thin pork chops also!

This recipe is delicious! Thank you! I've made it several times; it's definitely a favorite. Very simple and versatile recipe. Fantastic paired with just about anything. I'd recommend serving over grains rather than pastas, however, unless the pasta is couscous. I can't imagine omitting the brandy like many reviewers have, it adds such a wonderful flavor to the dish. Use a good aged brandy and you wont regret it. I also don't understand the comments about this being "bland". I'm salivating just thinking about this recipe! I add minced garlic, use marinated artichokes, add a splash more brandy, and give the sauce much more time to reduce and thicken. Turns out beautifully every time. I like the suggestion of adding kalamatas, but I think with that addition I'd substitute sherry or red wine for the brandy. I just don't see kalamatas and brandy mixing very well. Kalamatas are soaked in red wine vinegar, after all. I also like the suggestion of adding heavy cream to the sauce. It's an incredibly delicious dish as is, but I think I'll try the cream for a little change and update afterward.

Had to modify this recipe to make it fit Weight Watchers Core program. Instead of flour, I used seasoned cream of wheat (added poultry seasoning and lemon pepper along with the salt and pepper). Also, I doubled the broth and cut out the brandy.

I will pound out the chicken breasts even more next time and maybe add klamata olives with the artichokes. 

The coating turned out very crunchy and beautifully brown on the chicken. Love the brothy sauce this dish creates! I served it over couscous so that the wonderful sauce could soak in. YUM!

The sauce really makes this dish.  The combination of beef broth and the tanginess of the lemon and artichokes make this extraordinarily good.  I didn't have the brandy and used another 1/2 cup of beef broth to make up for it.  The portabella mushrooms and artichokes make it a little on the expensive side but definitely worth it!

I just made this for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day.  Just a few days prior we dined at a wonderful French bistro in town, and he said this was better than the food we ate there!!  He loved it, and so did I.  The flavor is wonderful!  I didn't have any brandy so used cream sherry and that worked great.  SUPERB!!

I ad-libbed with this recipe, as I wanted to bake it in the oven, and didn't have all of the ingredients the recipe called for. For instance, I substituted scotch whiskey for the brandy and normal mushrooms for portobello mushrooms.
I baked it on 400 for ~1/2 hr covered, then ~1/2 hr uncovered, basting every 15 min or so. The family raved! I served this with couscous to absorb the delicious sauce.

I changed things a bit and loved the end result.  used thyme intead of tarragon because I'm not big into tarragon and I used white wine instead of the brandy. I added 1/2 cup heavy cream in the end and served over fettucine noodles. I will definetly make this again.

Great recipe,however, I did make a couple changes---1st-don't cook chicken too long, when it's pounded it only needs about 3 min, then I used some heavy cream for the sauce. Fabulous! Trust me. O.K.?

This was quite bland. I expected it to have much more flavor. Next time I will stir in a little heavy cream at the end and add some salt and pepper.

This was an excellent recipe. I made it for Valentine's Day and my boyfriend loved it. I halved the recipe, because I made it for two, and no one else in my family likes chicken. 
The flavours were absolutely amazing together, and the brandy added that extra bit of oomph to the whole thing. Definately will make again and again!

My husband and I enjoyed this dish!  Since the recipe was not clear, I cut the mushrooms into bite sized chunks.  Nice meaty bites of mushrooms.  Many of the reviews felt the brandy overpowered so I just put broth (vegetable, I was out of beef) and a touch of white wine.I did not have artichoke hearts so just did without.  I also added 1/4 t of red pepper flakes for a bit of zip.  Delicious!

I found this to be very tastey and found using an oak aged brandy gave it a mild woodsy taste.  It was easy to prepare (although when multiplying the recipe, give yourself lots of lead time.)  This is a keeper for me I will use it again for dinner parties.

I found the tarragon flavor to be too strong.  Possibly try it with 1 teaspoon instead of the requested 2.

Very good!  The first time I made it, it seemed to have too much lemon so I cut the lemon juice in half when I made it again and that made it just right.  It also makes an impressive dinner for guests.

I was disappointed in this recipe.  All the ingredients gave me high hopes (which is why I gave it three stars), but if you make this as written (with the exception of the broth--I used chicken broth) it comes out bland and too lemon-tasting with too thin of a sauce.  I am planning on making it again only this time I will make several changes.  I will follow the tips of reviewer mwbarker by adding kalamata olives and skipping the brandy and doubling the broth.  I will also reduce the lemon from the juice of one lemon (1/4 cup) to 2 tablespoons.  I will also add 1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes, and add cornstarch and half n half to the sauce.  I will give an update soon.

WONDERFUL!

I didn't have brandy on hand, so I substituted with rum. I sliced the portobellos. It was FANTASTIC! You could easity serve this to dinner guests.
The only reason that I did not give it 5 stars was because I found it has a little too much liquid. Next time I think I'll cut down the beef broth and brandy to 1/4 cup each.

Thanks for posting this keeper!

YUM! I tweaked it as I always do to make it lower in sodium. Additionally, I omitted the brandy. This dish rocks. Even my 6 year old adores it.

My husband has been begging me for a new portobello mushroom dish.  I tried this one, but neither of us liked it very much.  The flavors didn't seem to go together as well as I had hoped.  Although the chicken was tender, the onions seemed to overpower the mushroom flavor.

I needed a recipe with portobello mushrooms and chicken but I didn't add the alcohol because I will be feeding it to my daughter, and I didn't use as many artichokes. Guess it needs to be followed to the "T" or else it just tastes like chicken and beef broth. I gave it 4 stars because I didn't follow everything in the recipe, so I'm sure the original is good!

I thought it was just OK- the sauce was very thin, and I had to add a little cornstarch. It was all right for dinner, and when I tried the leftovers for lunch, it tasted even more bland! Usually, leftovers taste better. I don't know, maybe I'll try again and add more of something. Was pretty easy!

Very good, I simmered the sauce for awhile with the chicken back in the pan. Followed the recipe exactly and served with basmati rice. I would make this again

How Wonderful! I heeded the advice of others, and used 1 cup of broth & added no brandy . Im not a big fan of tarragon so I omitted it and it was still delicious. I thought the chicken would be a bit dry, but I let it simmer a few extra minutes in the sauce and it was a moist as can be. I served this with wild rice and steamed veggies. Great Recipe!

I made this for a special dinner. It's a beautiful dish, but the taragon and brandy are really overpowering. I'll definitely use less of each if I make this again.

I made this for Valentines Day and my boyfriend loved it. I don't like mushrooms so I didn't use those and I didn't add Brandy cause I didn't have any. I added a couple more artichokes and will probably just use the whole can next time cause I loved them plus I didn't know what to do with the rest of them except to throw it away. I will definitely make this again!!

Hmmmm. How do I rate this one? Upon initial tasting of the dish, I didn't like it at all. After about an hour, the flavors seemed to meld together and made it taste pretty good. I doubt I will ever make this again. It was more time consuming than I thought. Went well with Rancho Zabacho Zinfindel.

We thought this was a pretty good dish.  The flavors were all very strong though.  I didn't have Brandy so I used Marsala wine instead and the mushrooms and artichokes really soaked up the wine.  Very intense flavors though.  I didn't like the way the portobello mushrooms turned the sauce black.  Might keep them seperate next time.

I had such high hopes for this recipe - it features some of my favorite ingredients, but for some reason it just tasted awful.  The brandy was overpowering and I ended up throwing most of it away.  3 stars because there is always the possibility that I goofed based on the other high reviews. Thanks, anyways!

I made this one for my fiance on Valentine's Day '04 as a special gift to her.  She and I loved the dish.  It was easy enough to put together, but will be smoother to complete the next time we use this recipe.

Very good!  The chicken came out very tender.  I think I made the pan a little too hot so the vegetables weren't perfect...but I will definately make this again.

I just made this tonight for dinner for my family of four plus my two in-laws. Everyone loved it, even the kids! I kept the mushrooms big enough for my kids to pick out, I added some baby carrots, green beans and yellow beans (frozen), I used chicken broth instead of beef and I used dried rosemary and dried basil instead of tarragon because I didn't have any. I like taking recipes but tweaking them a bit to mine and my family's taste and this one was a win and definitely going to make it again! Oh! And instead of thinning out the chicken breasts I cut them into strips. :)

This is a true Frenchie dish. I want to try it again with NO substitutions. i made it with veal (which was good) Subbed a lime for a lemon (bad idea) and I didn't have brandy so I used a cooking wine (also, not great considering the flavor of brandy). So stick to the recipe! Veal substitution was the only one that really worked. It was still passable (my 9 yr old ate it) but it could have been so much better, especially if we had had a nice crisp french loaf of sourdough ;)

We loved this! I uses all vegetable broth in lieu of both beef broth and brandy. I also served on top of angel hair pasta. I didn't use enough artichoke....will use more next time :) Oh yeah sprinkled a little parmesan on top.

I had high hopes for this recipe - portobello and artichokes, what's not to love? The recipe was easy and it smelled delicious, but we were seriously let down at how bland the meal was. It definitely needs some love and attention to kick up the flavor, something that I just didn't have the time for. If you're looking for something quick and easy that's delicious, this is not the recipe for you!
