I used cream of mushroom soup from Sprouts which is only a partially condensed soup (no MSG) with organic ingredients, and I caramelized a few mushrooms to go with it.  I used leftover chicken from another recipe I made from this site.  I cut the recipe in half but otherwise used the ingredients called for.  I changed how I cooked it, however, because I added my cooked chicken to the saucepan with the sauce to warm up the chicken rather than putting it in the oven.  That seemed to be a better way to prepare it for us.  Served over sticky rice, this was a winner of a dinner for us!  Thanks for this recipe!

This sauce was insanely delicious. I served mine with steamed broccoli and cauliflower, with the sauce over the top. It was to die for!

So good!  I used only two large chicken breasts.   Just two of us and small eaters.   I should have cut the sauce recipe in half.   I wonder if you can freeze the leftover sauce.  It is a keeper.   I served with roasted broccoli and a wild rice side dish  had vacuumed packed and had it in the freezer.

Absolutely delicious!  I just added a little Truffle salt (OMG, it gave it an amazing aroma and taste), and used heavy cream instead of half and half. Otherwise, just the same. It was sooo good!

Fantastic. Simple. Added nutmeg & white pepper.  Didn't have cream-used milk. Worked fine. Thank you. It came out like nice sauces we have had in restaurants!

This sauce would make a dirty wet sock taste delicious. I like recipes that are relatively easy and don't have a bunch of ingredients. I served this with some risotto.
