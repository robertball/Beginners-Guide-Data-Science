The salsa is wonderful and easy to make. If it's too tart (and sometimes it is) I'll add a drop of honey to the blender. I chose to roll the tortillas  instead of stacking them and put some fresh cilantro on top while baking. I broil for about 2 minutes at the end to get the tortillas a little crispier rather than soggy. Don't care for the queso fresco, so left that out.

I didn't have enough tomatillos or cilantro to make this as the recipe directed.  I used half tomatillos and half green tomatoes (as suggested on several websites) and I had to use more than a cup of papalo to add to the cilantro I had.  Next time I'll make sure I have all the right ingredients, and I bet it will be a five-star dish!

We have a garden and my husband grows tomatillos and jalapenos, among other wonderful things. We also have  lime tree, so a lot of the ingredients came from our own back yard!

Thumbs up from a family of five. I'd probably try to make individual enchiladas rather than the layered strategy just for easier serving.

I typed in a few ingredients I have at home, looking for a recipe, and this  came up. Initially I was a little uncertain but I'm so glad I made it  - very delicious! 

Two cups of cilantro seemed really excessive (I was convinced the taste would overwhelm the dish) but I'm happy to say it does not. 

I've never cooked with tomatillos and I regret using canned ones; they were mushy. I will definitely use fresh ones next time; if it tastes this good with mushy canned ones I can't imagine how much better it will be with fresh.

serve with tortilla chips to add a crunch!
