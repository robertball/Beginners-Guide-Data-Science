This was excellent! I did leave out the sunflower seeds out of personal preference and I used regular bacon because I had some that needed used. The chimichurri wasn't the prettiest to look at and it got a little thicker than usual but it was excellent and was the perfect consistency for a salad dressing. This is a great recipe and 5 stars all the way!
