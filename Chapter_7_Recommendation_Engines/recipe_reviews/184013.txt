I opted for fat free cream of mushroom soup and subbed plain fat free greek yogurt for the sour cream.  Skipped the butter and just satueed the onion and garlic in a pan sprayed with cooking spray. I felt like I was eating something really rich and decadent---had to keep reminding myself that it was only 2 Points Plus on the WW plan!!

Tasty!  I've been looking for something that would temper the sweetness of squash, and this combination worked excellently.  This dish is a creamy, wonderful-tasting accompaniment to many dishes, we served it with mashed potatoes and sausages, would go great with turkey at Thanksgiving, I think!  Easy, too!  The only difference was I baked my squash in the oven by cutting it in half and inverting into a pan with a bit of water.  Also I used paprika and parsley for garnish and seasoning.  Wonderful either way!!

Very tasty and a different way to prepare spaghetti squash.   The only thing I'd change for next time is halving the amount of margarine... I would rather save my calories for dessert.  I'll report back if this changes things too drastically when I make again.

Loved it! I definently only put 2-3 T of butter, and I spot cooked the garlic cloves in a skillet with the peeling on,before i cut them.. It gives them a wonderful roasted flavor... the only other thing I added was a little less than a 1/4 of cup of parmasian cheese to the sauce... very creamy!!!  Thanks for the recipe!

Just got done having this for lunch today.  DH absolutely loved it.  I used a couple of tablespoons of olive oil instead of butter and used light sour cream.  Added a left over boiled chicken breast and used it as our main course.  Super easy and delicious.  We have been trying to cut back on the pasta and this fit in very well.  Thanks for sharing.

I lightened mine up with much less butter, using about 2 Tbsp of margarine, 98% fat free soup and reduced fat sour cream, about a 1/2 cup....not that I doubt the original tastes awesome, but this version was very tasty.

Followed previous review of using greek yogurt instead of sour cream and added grilled chicken.  Added some red pepper flakes for some kick.  It was a hit!

Delicious with some modiciations! First, I sauteed lean pork loin with garlic powder and seasoning salt and set aside. Instead of cream of mushroom soup I made a roux with olive oil and flour, then added fat free half and half until creamy. Added two cans of mushrooms (fresh would also be good!).  My husband turned up his nose when I told him we were having sqash instead of spaghetti, but after his first bite he told me this was a keeper!  With some modifications, can be a very unique and healthy alternative to carb-laden pasta.

Maybe my spaghetti squash was on the small size but this made way too much sauce and it overpowered the squash.  The flavor of the sauce was nice and perhaps it would be good on chicken but on the squash it was too rich and heavy. Probably won't make this again.

I think like another reviewer my squash may have been too small.  There was too much sauce for the amount of spaghetti.  As it was so runny, I needed to add more vegetables.  I used what I had on hand with mushrooms and broccoli.  I was tasty but I thought that the sour cream was overwhelming. Next time, if my squash is the same size, I will use half a can of soup and 1/4 cup of sour cream.  I will try this again because the potential is definitely there.

I substituted EVOO for the butter, added fresh peas and mushrooms, and substituted Greek yogurt for the sour cream to up the protein content.  SUPER yumfest.

Wow! This recipe is excellent. I have been looking for a different way to prepare squash that is not tomato-based. The only things I changed were the butter (I used about 2 tbs of magarine instead) and I added a can of mushrooms. I would definitely like to try it with chicken next time!

What an interesting new way to prepare spaghetti squash!  After reading a few other reviews, I also cut down the amount of butter to about half, and I added parmesan cheese to the mixture.  I made two additional modifications.  I quartered some baby portabella mushrooms and sauteed them with the onion and garlic.  I also had part of a rotisserie chicken left from the previous day, so I cut that up and added it.  I'm glad the recipe made a lot, because I'm looking forward to having the leftovers tomorrow.

Nice easy side dish for spaghetti squash that uses ingredients that you likely already have in the house.  I made it, and it was enough for at least 5 portions (the squash I used was a good size at about 11 inches long).  Giving it 5 stars because it is easy to make and a different flavor than most of the tomato-based spaghetti squash recipes out there.

Not having ever used spaghetti squash in a similar way, I gave this recipe a go. I ended up baking the squash whole after poking some holes in a 375 degree oven for about 80 mins. I had some time, and this way the hard outer layer softens and you don't have to fight with it =) (Also, reserve the seeds to toast later if you want!) My very picky husband who loathes squash gave this a solid 7.5 stars/10 possible. I also upped the spices a bit (more garlic and salt) and added some cooked chicken pieces. I will make this again! I did not have too much sauce at all, but my squash was on the larger side. I found that I needed to add a bit of water to thin the sauce just a tad because it was so thick!

1/4 cup Parmesan cheese
and after baking the combined mixture for 30 min topped with 1/2 cup shredded cheese.

Very good!  I found this and doctored it a little... added a couple of splashes of white wine, cut down to about 1/2 the sour cream, and added in a handful of fresh diced mushrooms and a couple of shredded boiled chicken tenders.  Magnificent!

We really loved this recipe, I did cut down on the butter and I also sauteed a 8 zo. package of mushrooms and added those. Yummy. Make sure you get the water out of the squash so its not too runny.

Very good. I added more mushrooms, some parmesan cheese, and only used 1/4 c butter. It does make a LOT of sauce. I hade a pretty big squash and it still overwhelmed it but I liked it that way. However, the squash took much longer than 12 minutes in the microwave. When I make this again I'll cook the squash in the oven.

This is the first time I have ever made Spaghetti Squash and it was quite tastey.  I substitued mushroom soup for celery soup. Omitted the sour cream and butter to cut down on fat and calories. I also added curry powder to taste and 1/2 a can of water to thin it out, since I like a thin sauce.  Turned out great. Can't wait to try another spaghetti squash recipe.

The flavor of the sauce is great, and a really nice change from the usual red sauce.  I only used 2 tablespoons of butter, low fat soup and fat free sour cream, which lightened it up a bit.  But my squash was small so the sauce was a little overwhelming.  Next time, I will use a bigger squash.

Definitely different and my family was pleasantly surprised!  My squash was large and I should have make more sauce.  I also sauteed a mixture of mushrooms with the onion in only 1 T of butter and used fat free sour cream.  Served with a nice salad to round out the meal. Will add to monthly rotation.

I changed a few things...I preheated oven to 375 degrees, baked halved squash cut side facing down for 40 minutes, let cool for 5 minutes, removed seeds from center and then shredded squash.   I blended it with the following:

I used 98% Fat Free Cream of Chicken, 1c of Plain Greek Yogurt, added fresh mushrooms, chopped onions and garlic (followed recipe amount). Added ground peppercorn and a pinch of black sea salt.   WOW!  

This was my first experience with Spaghetti Squash and man, was it amazing!  This recipe has instantly become a favorite!

Oh my goodness. This is so far my FAVORITE way to eat spaghetti squash. My husband and I added some ground beef and it was stunningly delicious... :) We couldn't get enough, even when we were full!!

Good recipe, just check to ensure that the squash is cooked all the way before mixing the ingredients together :-P

Very tasty, but too much butter/sauce.  Either 1/2 the sauce or get a large squash.  Will make again!

With modifications VERY YUMMY!  I took the basic concept and changed it a bit.   1.baked my large spaghetti squash 2. Sauteed chicken in skillet Added roasted garlic and shallots (buy them from the olive bar at my grocery store and keep them on hand) 3. Added cream of chicken mushroom soup and half can of milk along with pepper and some fresh sage.  Added a splash of cooking sherry and simmered. 4.gutted squash and mixed in saute pan adding pepper and a little bit of cinnamon to it.  Mixed in low fat sour cream and served.  Hit with the kids and the husband.  Very easy, cooking the squash took the longest.

Fantastic.  I added pre-made turkey meatballs and let them simmer in the sauce.  Made it almost like a stroganoff.  Was excellent!

I was looking for a different way to eat spaghetti squash besides spaghetti. This was yummy. I think it even got better as leftovers. Would be great with added chicken! Easy recipe.

After reading reviews I decided my squash was on the small side and that I could bulk it up. I had about a half head of cauliflower that I riced in my blender and added it after sautéing the garlic and onions. Then followed recipe and decided to add about a half cup of shredded Parmesan and topped this with chives. Oh my it’s delicious!

I had left over spaghetti squash that I knew wasn't going to get eaten so what better to do with it than make a pot of soup? This soup was amazing! I used a whole onion and added in 32oz of chicken broth. Took some over to my dads house and he raved. Next time I'm going to double the recipe and freeze.

I made this recipe tonight and everyone loved it!!!  I cooked the spaghetti squash in the oven.  Cutting it length wise, seasoning it with salt, pepper, nutmeg, no salt organic seasoning and a splash of olive oil.  Put foil down in a deep 9x12 pan, put the squash cut side down.  Filled the pan with about 1/2 inch of water, baked covered with foil, 375 degree for 45 minutes.  Turned them over and cooked for another 15 minutes.   Made the rest as stated but added fresh herbs at the end (basil, parsley and cilantro).  Served with skirt steak.  I also added fresh mushrooms.

I made this without the sour cream just because I didn't have it.  I also had a somewhat small squash so only used 2/3 of the can of cream of mushroom soup mix and I didn't want too much sauce.  Tasted very good, will make again.

Tasted really great, but next time I would cut down on the butter, it didn't need all of it. Had a really rough time with microwaving the squash (maybe it's just my microwave) so I'll probably roast it in the oven next time. Definitely a keeper though!

Omg!! Just made a double batch of this tonight and so glad I did.  I added some grated parmesan and crumbled some potato chips on top, then baked it in the oven for 40 mins.  Had 2 helpings and am stuffed.  Delicious!!  Next time I'm going to add chicken and fresh mushrooms.

This was so yummy and a great addition to my recipe collection for spaghetti squash!! I had to add quite a bit of salt but that's normal. I added not only the garlic cloves in the recipe but found it didn't have any garlic flavor still so I added garlic powder to it, too.  It was very good and got great reviews by my family! Everyone went back for seconds and that's always a big compliment to the chef!  :)

The flavour of this is great - be sure to use a big squash. Very good really - my complaint was about the quality of the squash - certainly not the recipe. Made it exactly and very good.

what a great comfort food substitute!  I used low fat sour cream and soup and reduced the butter to three TBS of light margarine.  i also added a couple of cups of sliced baby bellas and topped with grilled chicken to make it more like a stroganoff.  this is on my regular menu at home!

I often hesitate to use recipes that start with canned soup. Glad I tried this one, though! So easy to microwave the squash. I cut way down on the butter, used no-fat Greek yogurt for the sour cream, and topped the finished dish with lots of sautéed mushrooms. Excellent vegetarian main dish.

Not a fan of the gelatinous soup in a can so I made my own delish version.  Hubby gave this 5 stars, but I felt it was a bit on the watery side from the squash.  I made my soup replacement nice and thick, but the squash still made the dish too watery.  Taste was great though!

Made this today and it was very good. I did have to change it up, as I did not have all the ingredients on hand.  I had only sweet onion so I diced up 2 or 3 T. and cooked that in a bit of olive oil, added garlic, cream of mushroom soup, and heavy cream (about 1/4 cup) to use that up---since I didn't have sour cream either! added an egg and a bit of croutons, S & P and a bit of Parm. cheese. Then added the cooked squash, mixed it all up, put it in a greased pan and baked it at 350 for about 40 minutes.  Everyone gave it a thumbs up at dinner today!

Love this recipe! The first time I made it I didn't have cream of mushroom soup on hand, so substitued cream of celery and it turned out VERY tasty! Made it a second time with the correct ingredients and still very tasty. I think the next time I may make substitutions someone else recommended with fat free soup, no butter, etc. Otherwise I feel so glutenous eating this!

Added a whole bunch of fresh mushrooms and 1/4 cup Romano graded cheese! It was wonderful and very filling =)

not bad -- i'd make this again. i didn't have condensed soup, i had the ready-to-serve stuff; i also added some fresh mushrooms into the mix with the onions & garlic as some others suggested, and it made for a good low-fat "cream" sauce.

I made some adaptations by adding red peppers and fresh mushrooms. This was awesome and I will definitely make this again!

I thought I'd use up a spaghetti squash that my old auntie on the farm gave me a few months ago. I found this recipe and thought, "Perfect!" 

Well, the sauce turned out d-e-l-i-c-i-o-u-s, but the squash was obviously too old and too bitter for our consumption. No probs... I just made a box of Stove-Top Stuffing and we used the sauce on top of that (like a gravy) and on our roasted chicken.

I will make this sauce again and maybe use it on pasta.

Made this the other night and it did not go over well with the family.  I ended up being the only one that ate it. Needs to be more specific about the size of the spaghetti squash - I think mine was too small. It turned out very gloppy and the flavor of the condensed soup was overwhelming.

This was not good.  I was excited to try it after all the great reviews... but sadly I was not impressed.

When this recipe said it served 4, it must be referring to this as a main course & certainly not a side dish.  This made a massive amount of food.  Would easily fill a 7 by 11 baking dish.   Tasty but not something I'd make again.  It was very soupy so I'll likely add some broccoli & chicken & bake the leftovers so that it'll be a little thicker.   I should note that this was the first time we'd had spaghetti squash so that may be that this isn't a squash we'll like much in general.  I would suggest less sour cream & I reduced the butter to 3 TB instead of the original 8 called for.

Was not impressed.  You could have saved a lot of time by just adding french onion dip to the squash,  thats exsactly what it taste like.

Just OK.  Needs more garlic and fresh mushrooms would help.

I made a homemade cream of mushroom soup since I used the oven for the squash.  I don't believe in microwaves.  It was a nice change of pace for dinner.  I don't like canned soups so it was a little more time consuming but well worth it.  thanks for sharing.

I feel badly about giving this a one star rating, but I'm afraid I didn't care for it a bit.  Way too much sauce, and even putting only 1/2c sour cream in, the sour cream flavor overpowered the dish. I forced it down for lack of other food and tossed the remainder.

Excellent but very sweet- use lots of salt and pepper- I had a pretty big squash though. I made mine with kielbasa and my family loved it!

Nobody in my family liked it. The naturally sweet squash and the mushroom gravy just didn't work well together.
