Hello, I am the submitter of this recipe. Please, do not use: minced garlic or heavy cream. This is meant to be a quick homestyle spinach dish or the type you would eat with meatloaf or something similar. The spinach needs the stronger taste of the ground spices. It will be bland with fresh garlic. This is not an Italian garlic spinach or a fancy dish. I put it together for something quick for a weeknight or to get kids or husbands who don't normally eat spinach to learn to love it. Thanks!

I don't usually stray from the way I do spinach since my son doesn't like to much done with it. But I wanted to try this so I took a chance. I thought it was really good. My son poked at it and whined about why I was messing with his spinach, finally convinced him to try it and he loved it. He ended up eating 3 servings and scraped the bowl of the leftovers :) Love when that happens. Good thing I doubled the recipe! Will definitely be making this again.

This recipe is a quick and easy (and is still healthy) way to fancy up spinach and tastes great. I enjoyed it because it has a subtle creamy flavor and texture with just enough seasoning that doesn't take away the taste of the spinach itself. Went very nice with the well seasoned grilled chicken we had and was good too because it didn't compete with the main entry it complimented it.  I know I'll make this often. Thanks Sarah!

This could not be simpler and it was yummy too! I did not have whipped butter, so used just regular stick butter. I also used a whole bag of spinach that I had on hand. I chopped it a little and just threw in the pan (no need to boil) after the sauce had thickened and it turned out perfect. Other than that followed recipe - took about 5 min. from start to finish! I will make this again and will use fresh spinach.

It was really good. Stick to the recipe! You will like it. This was very good this evening with a steak and scalloped potatoes. Use the seasonings in the recipe. I used whole milk and butter. I ate all of it.

Wish I could give it 3.5 stars.  Would probably be better with cream, sauteed garlic, and grated parm mixed in.  Could also add red pepper flakes.

Very easy to make! Everything was consumed...not a drop of Spinach left. I couldn't believe it. Didn't have to change a thing. 

Made a wonderful sidedish for a parmesan breaded chicken breast.

Very tasty! I used 2 cloves of fresh minced garlic, a pinch of nutmeg and additional milk to make it more sauce-y.

This recipe was fantastic as is, I only made one change and that was that I added a full cup of skim milk, instead of just 1/4 cup. I love that because it's simply flavored, it can go with pretty much anything. One night we had it paired with baked rotini, and another night we paired it with lentil curry and rice. So easy, and so tasty! Thanks so much! :)

I enjoyed this appetizing side dish. Quick and simple to make with easy to follow instructions. Topped with toasted, slivered almonds for texture. Had only heavy cream on hand which made this nice and rich but added fat/calories. This dish was well received. Thanks Sarah

This was a nice change from our usual spinach dish of garlic, oil and crushed red pepper.  I did use soy milk in place of regular milk.  It cam together easily and everyone enjoyed it.  Will make again.

I doubled the sauce as suggested in the write-up.  My husband and 2 year old both loved it.  I thought it was good too, but the longer it sat the less impressed I was with it.  Definitely a dish to eat piping-hot!

we love creamed spinach and this recipe was a keeper.  I doubled the amounts for the cream sauce and used an entire clamshell of fresh spinach from Sam's club.  what we did not eat, I cooked down and used on salmon for a sauce.  delicious!!  here is a great tip.  add a couple of dashes of nutmeg to the cream sauce.  your guests won't know what it is, but will love the taste

I follwed this recipe to the letter and found it to be more than disappointing. It completely lacked flavor and I felt that using the frozen spinach made it kinda slimey. I like the basic concept, but I won't be making it again. I think if I make a creamed spinach again I'm going play it by ear and I'm going to use fresh spinach and fresh garlic, to give it more flavor and a better consistency.

Oh man, great basic easy recipe. I used chopped garlic sautéed in the sauce instead and omitted the milk (I was out at the time.)

I love this recipe!  I also love to my modify recipe, I use two pieces of pre cooked bacon, and a  little bit  of sliced onion. Continue to cook the spinach as instructed and add shredded parmesan cheese.   Thank you so much for sharing.

I used fresh spinach so it took longer to wilt down.  Plus to prevent burning, I added heavy whipping cream and extra garlic powder. My husband loved it.  I didn't even get any..

As written we found this to be very bland.  I liked the basic idea so when I next made it, I made the the light white sauce, using whipped butter and 2% milk.  Instead of garlic salt I used fresh garlic and I grated about 1/4 tsp of nutmeg into the sauce.  It still needed some punch so I added fresh ground pepper.  Oh, and I poured the sauce over very lightly sauteed fresh baby spinach.

Really good for a quick side.  I used French butter, not whipped.  I used only garlic salt because my father complains of food being too salty.  I added a small can of mushrooms, drained.  Still, very easy.  Thanks.

Added Parmesan cheese. Made more of a roux for me but milk thinned it out to make the spinach creamy. So easy and so good!!

I made it today.  Fantastic!!!!!  I had to use 1/4 tsp. garlic powder and 1/4 tsp. salt because I didn't have the other.  Super Great!  This is a healthy, low choelsterol recipe!  Why would anyone add use bacon, cream, etc. ????

Loved it and cooked it with regular butter, because I didn't have whipped. My husband and I loved it! Next time I will use more garlic salt!

This was really handy when I needed a vegetable to round out my meal and had nothing fresh. I'm not a huge fan of cooked spinach but liked this very much. I used roasted garlic salt and it had a delicious flavor.

I used Brummel & Brown “butter” (did not have whipped butter) and whole milk. I just placed a half of a 24 oz. bag of frozen spinach in the pan, not sure if it would make a difference if it was thawed beforehand.

Made it the way suggested. For us, it needed cream, more salt, cheese...tasted like ...cooked frozen spinach. A pinch of salt and garlic salt makes little difference. Any sauce made with flour needs a lot more flavoring, imo.

Very good and easy to make. I'll never buy packaged creamed spinach again! I usually don't keep garlic salt on hand, because I'm too heavy with it, which results in way too much salt. I usually just do garlic powder + some salt, but since I was out of garlic powder I used 1/4 tsp minced garlic (jarred/prepared). The only reason this recipe is getting 4 stars is because I don't see how the original measurements for the roux/sauce mixture would have resulted in creamy. Following measurements as written I ended up with a paste. Thankfully, I thought the 1/4 cup would not be enough liquid and kept the milk nearby to slowly add in.  I ended up adding another 1/2 cup milk slowly (approximately 3/4 cup total). End result was delicious and 3 servings (side servings). Thanks for sharing the recipe! I'm going to try adding this to my Thanksgiving menu!

Delicious! I will make this again and again. I do plan on making some changes (Add some sort of firm cheese?) 
I really appreciate how easy and quick this healthy side dish is- there really is no need to change it but I love "customization" in cooking. 
I excluded the flour, mainly because I forgot to add it but we didn't miss it. I used regular butter. This was a great side to my ravioli dinner.

This recipe was not the best. It isn't creamy enough to be creamed spinach, and the milk made it more glumpy than smooth.

Although this recipe is quick and I think it is a good start to build on, I believe that this recipe could and should be tastier as I am someone that loves spinach. My boys who also like spinach tried to take their plate to the sink without eating it.

I really liked this recipie.  I needed an item for a potluck that was  inexpensive,quick easy to make and flavorfull.  I did tweak the recipie because I made enough to feed 20.  I used choppen frozen spinach as was suggested.  Instead of boiling it in water I used a chicken broth.  I did use low fat milk and margerine but it seemed to thin so I added a little canned milk.  I did not have garlic salt so I used a cube of dried garlic also.
