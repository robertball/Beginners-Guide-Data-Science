FIRST TRY -- I mistakenly used Neufchatel instead of cream cheese. It turned out quite interesting...very smooth with a consistency denser than pumpkin pie but not really gelatin-like either. Not horrible but obviously not the way it was suppose to turn out. --  SECOND TRY -- I used fat free cream cheese and added 1/2 teaspoon of lemon juice. It turned out alright - a little dense but I did change the recipe. It was somewhat like a sponge cake but not quite as fluffy.  -- THIRD TRY -- Third time's a charm! I used fat-free cream cheese along with fat free skim milk. Although it looked dense, it turned out soft. It was flufflier this time probably because I did a better job of combining the ingredients (making sure the yolks and sugar were light and fluffy, etc.). I didn't have parchment paper so I just used PAM and I had no problem with it sticking. With the fat-free ingredients, each serving has barely any fat and less than 100 calories!

This was my first  time baking a cheesecake. I like this recipe because it doesn't use as much cream cheese, which makes this a light cheesecake. I halved the recipe to make a small cheesecake and added a tablespoon of freshly squeezed lemon juice. It turned out wonderfully! Just like the japanese cheesecakes from asian bakeries. Light like a spongecake (as i think it should be), yet still delicious and easy to make.

I live in Japan and patisseries make a whole amount of ` Japanese cheesecakes ` which I take pale in great comparison to the regular New York style cheesecakes you find at home.  Although the Japanese patisseries make a whole bunch of delectable cakes that look amazing, they never seem to make the cheesecakes ` correctly `.  Hence, I would have to give this recipe a low rating bc it is more of like a sponge - egg cake, that always sinks.  If anyone wants a light dessert, a good custard will do rather than this mushy - spongey type of cheesecake.

This was delicious.  I made it 3 times and it was gone within a few minutes.  I am going to double the recipe next time.  It was light, fluffy, and it tastes better than something that costs 1.39 at the store.  I would definitely recommend it. ^_^

Problems falling, just like baking any cheesecake, crack the oven and let it cool down.

This was a light spongecake w/out a lot of "cheesyness". We really enjoyed it the day we made it but it dried out overnight in the fridge (even though it was covered) & the leftovers got tossed. I drizzled it w/ caramel sauce & garnished w/ an orchid flower & a sprig of fesh mint. I'll make it again for an asian-themed dessert but next time I will make it in individual ramekins & plan on no leftovers. Thansk for the recipe!

I tried this out today, tripled the recipe & it turned out yummy! Dad loved it. Although the egg smell is pretty strong, it's very light and similar to sponge cake. You can taste the cream cheese but it isn't overpowering. Will definitely try this again but maybe will add some flavouring to lessen the egginess of it (citrus? lemon? orange?  vanilla? pandan? lemongrass?).

The first time I tried this, the cake came out great.  Second time, I doubled the sugar and it was even better.  However, all attempts thereafter failed miserably.  The cake always sank even though I did everything the same.  Am I missing something?  Reading other member reviews, I see that the recipe yielded different results also.  
Does anyone know why?  Is there a fail-safe version of this recipe?
TIA

Did triple the recipe to use up the tub of cream cheese I had (300 gr.) Added 1 tsp. vanilla extract per receipe. One cake I did in a toaster oven, two in my large convection oven. Strangely enough, the toaster oven came out best in terms of looks. The lower cake in the convection oven got water condensation droplets falling on it, ruining its looks. Both in the large oven didn't brown as nicely and I added 10 min. each in toaster oven to get the golden coloring. They didn't dry out; I suppose due to the water bath. All had wonderful flavor and texture. I think it'll look better if I made two cakes from this triple recipe. I had to stack the slices. See my photos submitted on 3/20/07

this is more like a sponge cake with cream cheese taste, mine sink, bt they still get eaten, I like the lightness of this recipe and prefer it to heavy cheesecakes (although they don't look pretty)

My friend and I made this cake. I've lived in Japan for a year and have eaten cheese cake there; this is not similar to what they have. I loved Japanese cheese cake. This cake looked perfect...but it tasted the same as a pancake. Her 2 year old daughter loved it...but we really didn't care for the recipe.

Tasty, light cheesecake! Wasn't too sweet, but wasn't bland tasting either. It goes great with a little honey and some pecans. Definitely will bake this again!

I tried the recipe with fat free cream cheese and skim milk, and it turned out great! I also experimented and poured the mixture into individual mini foil cups , using about a tablespoon of mixture for each cup. I baked them for about 15 minutes at 350 and about 10 minutes at 300. The recipe made about 24 cups, and they turned out great, though you may have to watch the time, since I just guessed on how long it would take. Great recipe though!

Very simple-to-follow recipe. Texture of the cake was really thin. It smelled wonderful. But I tasted more egg than the cheese...which was kind of gross.

For what it was supposed to be, I think it turned out good.  Very thin, though, and a bit bland.  I'm not sure if I'll make it again.

This recipe was...just good. It wasn't that "dense" sort of cheesecake...
it was more light and fluffy.

This reminded me of a spongecake.  It was good, but not something I was make everyday.  It went well with the Asian dishes I made with it.  It is not very sweet, and is very light and fluffy.

Cheesecake turns out quite good, but I thought increasing the ingredients twice would even better for thickness if you're making it in a 9' pan.  Is still densed but not heavy which makes this cake taste good & craving more. I'll definitely make this again.

Only giving it 3 stars because next time I will add more sugar, it wasn't sweet enough for me.  I'd also like it better with a little bit of a crust, only cause its what you're used to.  But it was VERY light and fluffy and I liked that.

This turned out horribly, the low oven temperature probably didnt allow the egg whites to rise properly, so mine was very dense and the batter had seperated while it was sitting in a too-cool oven. Definitely increase the oven temp when baking this...

the first time i made it, it was too dense. but it tasted okay. the second time i made it, it was fluffier but kind of sticky. too much sugar? they were definitely done so it wasn't that they weren't done yet. but they still tasted fine. i will definitely try again.

This was really good. I tried it with fat-free and regular cream cheese and all came out very fluffy and smooth. It looked really nice too. I also added a bit of lemon juice to the egg whites because i didn't have any cream of tartar. The slight tartness was good. The bottom of the cake will be a little wet when a toothpick is inserted even when it is fully cooked. Upon cooling it will be fine! loved it my family devoured them!

Thanks for the recipe! This is a good recipe for a light cheesecake! Those who are looking for the tiramisu, custard-like kind of cheesecakes may not like this. I don't think this recipe is for that kind of cheesecakes. I did eat Japanese cheesecakes with this texture before, so I'd like to defend this recipe against people thinking that this is not a "traditional" Japanese cheesecake! There are different kinds of Japanese cheesecakes and this is just one of them! I've been looking for a cheesecake recipe like this one for a long time. It was frustrating that all I could find was the custard-like kind of cheesecakes. I made mine with fat-free cream cheese and skimmed milk, so I think that took away the flavor a little. I'll make it with original cream cheese and whole milk next time. I'd also like to add a little bit more sugar. Again, great recipe, thanks!

Delicious, but more like a pound cake, hence the lower rating.  Everyone in my family loved it though.

We liked this very much.  Not what you think of an American cheesecake - rich creamy lucious.  This had a very nice flavor, not too sweet, not too rich and it doesn't hang on the hips and the arteries either. I've already made it again.  Will still make a regular cheesecake from time to time but this was a very nice treat for a change.

I followed the directions perfectly and it didn't turn out as planned. The timing was off as well. I had to throw it away.

It was flat as a pancake, really heavy and had no flavor to it at all. I ended up cutting it into squares, rolling the squares into balls and putting chocolate syrup on it. I refrigerated the balls for an hour or so and then served them.

I took the precaution of mixing everything as much as possible to make it light and fluffy.  Mine didn't cave in, however I made sure not to make loud noises or throw things too hard to rattle the oven. The cake didn't brown on the top but it's ok. I added vanilla (about 1/2tsp) because I couldn't believe this didn't have it. It came out beautiful but just not flavorful enough so I made homemade blueberry sauce to top it & it desperately needs it. I would make it again but to enhance the deliciousness/richness of a sauce, not to display it.

Mine didn't turn out spongy like all the reviews said it would. Nonetheless, the taste is quite good. Not too sweet and not too creamy. I whipped my egg whites for like 15 minutes in a mixer but it didn't look too foamy like most whipped egg whites. I am not sure what I did wrong and why my egg white didn't whip well. Wish it would have turned out the way I wanted. Like I said, I still like the taste. Will try to make it again and see I get lucky next time

I decided to use this recipe when i was looking for a quick fix snack with very few ingredients. I would never try this recipe again. It was tasteless and bland. My three year old wouldn't even eat it.

It is simple and easy. My family loved it. It reminds my family of quiche more than anything but if you top it with blueberries it is wonderful.

We did it by the recipe and baked it how it said, but when it was done it looked rather pale on top. We still had high hopes and cracked the oven as we let it cool. It didn't puff up as much as we would have liked, but it was still delicious! I would instead suggest a much smaller pan! Maybe 8 or 6 inch instead! :)

I think you need to add a teaspoon of baking powder, otherwise the cake shrinks.  First try it sank and it was awful.  Second try with baking powder came out better. And fluffy and delicious.

This recipe is very easy. Mine turned out beautifly. The cheesecake has a strong egg taste. The ones I buy in the Japanese store doesn't have that egg taste. Is there something I can do so it doesn't taste like eggs? Thanks

The cake turn out flat like pan cake. Does taste delicious. However think the ingredients should be double the eggs This recipe is very basic and simple to follow.  As I do not have adequate equipment, I did not fillup water at the outside of the pan to boil, luckily the cake still turn out ok , light and fluffy.

Oh my goodness! This is so easy to make & delicious. As a Japanese, this reminded me so much like the ones you can get in Japan. I'll try this cake again for sure.

The more I ate this cake, the more I liked it.  It is a pretty simple cake, and my husband suggested some berries on top would be nice.   I used regular cream cheese and fat free milk.  I also added 1 tsp vanilla extract.  Next time I might try lemon extract instead.
