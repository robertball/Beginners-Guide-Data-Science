I love anything orange and I love sweet potatoes, but this recipe was a disappointment. The potatoes do not take on the orange flavor (I even added more orange zest and some orange extract). And the corn syrup made a gooey stick to your teeth coating on the potatoes. Sorry....

This recipe was alright.  I wanted to try this because it sounded interesting and different!  I served these potatoes for Easter dinner.  No one really raved about them.  The comments were "What flavor is this?" because they couldn't figure it out and "They're good" but nothing spectacular.  I thought they lacked a lot of flavor.  I like my sweet potatoes really sweet!  This just didn't cut it.  I won't be making these again.

I prepared this recipe and found it to be absolutely delicious.  I also cooked the potatoes on another occasion  and took it to a potluck dinner.  Everyone raved about the orange flavor.
