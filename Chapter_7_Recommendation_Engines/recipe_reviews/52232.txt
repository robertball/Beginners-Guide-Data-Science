I gave this recipe 5 stars because it was easy to make, tasted great, and best of all, it was the first Indian dish I have ever prepared.  I didn't have a wok but found that using a large, non-stick pot worked well.  I substituted sesame oil for the vegetable oil but used the same quantity.  I used one medium onion (diced), two seemed like an awful lot.  I used a cup of tomatoe puree and, next time, I'd probably add a 1 1/2 or 2 cups of peas instead of just one.  The garlic/ginger paste is a little hard to find so I substituted a finely minced concoction of a few small cloves of fresh garlic and an equal quantity of fresh ginger.  The spice Garam masala is now available from the spice company McCormick and is sold at large supermarkets in my area (Giant Food in No. VA).  The amount of paprika specified was to my liking (but I'm a paprika fan).  Give this dish a try, you won't be disappointed!

Great recipe...I tend to change things alot though: I only used 2 potatoes, and an entire large bag of frozen peas. Also doubled or even tripled spices. Rather than sugar I used about a tsp. each of cinnamon and cloves, and rather than paprika, I used curry and chili powder to spice it up a bit. To reduce fat, I only used about a tsp. of oil and that worked just fine. Using crused or diced tomatoes rather than puree adds some moisture to the sauce to pour over rice or dip Naan into.

I thought it was good, but it really needing some spicing up. Only 1 1/2 tsp of garam masala?  I probably used at least 2 TBS just in order to taste it.  I  used chopped garlic and ginger, worked fine.  I pre-cooked the potatoes in a large pot with garlic, salt and pepper.  And sauteed the onions/garlic separately, then mixed together when the potatoes were about done (about 20 mins).  I also used a small can of tomato paste, and topped it off with some V8 juice (about 2 cups)... it made it nice and creamy.  Added fresh tomatoes and lots of peas... some dried chili flakes.  Served it over garlic-tasted pita... delish!

I made a few modifications, but it turned out to be delicious. I used a combination of fresh ginger and garlic for the garlic ginger paste. I also couldn't find the darn garam masala at the store, so I made my own mixture of cloves, cinnamon, cumin, ground mustard and tumeric (mostly tumeric). I added water to the potatoes to help them along and added the peas when adding the tomatoes, etc. I'm eating it right now, and it tastes fabulous.

Very good, however, there was a little too much paprika for my taste.  After cutting down on that, this is a very good way to make to Aloo Matar.

This tasted pretty good at first, but quickly got old.  It's essential to partly cook the potatoes first.  Through doing this there's no need to add extra tomato puree, as this just made the meal too soupy.  With those couple of changes I think this would make an average side dish, but nothing spectacular.

This is a great dish; the recipe is easy to make and the ingredients are easy to obtain.

I'd hate for someone not to try this recipe because they can't find "ginger garlic paste." It is really easy to make -- its just equal parts ginger and garlic.  Peel, mince, and smash!

Next time I make this I'm going to try adding some heat:  cumin, tumeric, and some type of chillies.

This was so good!  I really loved it, and it's really cheap and easy to boot.  I also used a large pot rather than a wok and used 12 tablespoon each of grated ginger and crushed garlic rather than the ginger garlic paste.  If you don't have garam masala on hand, don't buy it from the spice department of your grocery store - it's far too expensive that way.  Go to a grocery store with a good natural foods section and buy it in bulk.  I bought more of it in bulk for $2.00 than you can get for $7.00 in the bottle.

Loved this recipe!  We used spicy Hungarian paprika, so I reduced it by 1/2 tsp and we added 1/2 cup more peas after reading some of the other reviews.  It turned out fantastic!  I think a lot of how this turns out has to do with the ginger garlic paste.  We used 'Patak's Original' brand 'Spicy Ginger & Garlic Marianade & Grill Sauce Tandoori Mild'.  If you are from areas where you have HEB Central Market stores - that is where we found our's.  We also use it in the Chicken Makhani (Indian Butter Chicken) recipe from this site and it is just fabulous!

I tripled or quadrupled the spices at least otherwise this just tasted like tomatoes. After simmering for a while this tasted like an authentic indian dish. We scooped it up with naan bead and it was yummy!

Easy and tasty with a few minor modifications. I used 1 C of tomato puree & nearly doubled the seasonings. I also used far less oil--about 2 tablespoons rather than 1/4 cup to reduce the amount of saturated fat. When the potatoes started to stick, I just added a bit of water to help them steam. I do like my aloo mattar on the "soupy" side, and this recipe was quite thick even with the additional tomato puree. That said, this dish is delicious served with naan or roti and a little tamarind chutney. Even my picky boyfriend loved it!

I would give this 5 stars but it was way too frustrating to see my peas melting and having raw potatoes on a skillet. I tried cooking them for 4 minutes on the microwave before I did anything, but I ended up cooking the potatoes at the very end for 2 more minutes in the microwave because they were still raw (and fishing them out of the concoction wasn't easy!). I also added the whole small can of tomato puree and it made it less dry. This dish has an excellent flavor. Next time I will def cook the potatoes beforehand.

Super easy to make, cheap and delicious.  There wasn't enough liquid, so added a can of tomato juice (12-oz for a double batch) and extra sugar (to taste) to balance out the acidity.  I found it necessary to follow the recommendation for additional extra garam masala, though it probably depends on what brand you're using.  I will make this again soon, but will boil or pressure cook the potatoes separately.  While this adds some steps (and another pot to clean), it will allow me to cut down on the amount of oil I use.

The potatoes should have been par boiled before adding to the mixture as it took me over an hour to have cooked the mixture before the potatoes became soft enough to eat.

I followed others suggestions and used 1.5 TBS garam masala and substituted diced tomatoes for tomato paste. I also boiled the potatoes before sauteing them. It came out really tasty! In the future, I might add some dried chili pepper to give it more kick. It was flavorful with extra garam masala, but not spicy.

My boyfriend grew up in India so I'm always trying to make him his favorite Indian dishes, although I have trouble with alot of them. I thought I'd try this recipe because it's pretty simple, and it was a hit with him! He said it tasted wonderful! I did make a few small changes. I only used one onion, only 1/2 tsp paprika, and only 1 TBS cilantro.

I was pretty excited about making this recipe, but it ended up a semi-disaster. I'm not totally experienced with cooking with potatoes, so it might be my fault that I couldn't get my potatoes to cook in the wok. I ended up having to dump them into a microwave-safe bowl and nuke them until they were tender enough to finish cooking in the wok. I added extra seasoning as well. Maybe it was my inexperience with potato recipes, but this was very time consuming. I made this for a lunch with my then boyfriend, and he spent about an hour and a half in my living room watching Scrubs while I cursed at potatoes. Might make this again, but I'll partially cook the potatoes before adding them to the wok.

Very straightforward to make and a big success with my husband (which surprised me!).  I couldn't find ginger garlic paste, so I just used diced garlic instead, and this worked fine.  I added about 1/2 cup more tomato paste.

Pretty good.  Has a nice flavor. Note that this dish generates enough
sauce to cover the potatoes and peas, but not enough to mix the result in
with rice.   It also took a lot of work to get the potatoes cooked
correctly (despite the other reviewers' advice).  First, at the beginning
instead of cooking the potatoes covered for 15 minutes with the peas, I
cooked the potatoes covered for 15 minutes alone and added the peas and
cooked for five more minutes.  Throughout the recipe I kept a little water
at the bottom of the pan to help steam the potatoes and prevent burning.
Yet, despite this, the potatoes were still undercooked at the end of the
recipe; I needed to cook, covered, an additional ten minutes to finish
them.  But because of this, the peas ended up somewhat flat and
overcooked.  Next time I'll either boil the potatoes for a little while
before starting, or cook the potatoes alone until they're basically done
and then add the peas and continue with the recipe.   I used one
tablespoon of ground ginger and one tablespoon of garlic powder instead of
the ginger-garlic paste.  I used two teaspoons of dried cilantro
flakes (instead of two tablespoons of chopped fresh); supposedly that's
the appropriate ratio.

This dish is excellent.  My only modifications were a doubling of the tomato puree (to make one cup) and adding more peas, b/c I love peas.  I was happy with the spice combinations.  Very tasty.

I don't like reviewing recipes when I've readjusted the ingredients, however the base of this dish is delicious and so easy that I had to say something.  I only made minimal adjustments...1) I halved the paprika.  2)I wanted mine more "saucy" and creamy, like my local Indian restaurant makes it, so I added a 1/4 cup more tomato puree and a 3 Tbs half and half. 3) I omitted the cilantro, because, for some reason, cilantro holds onto my taste buds and won't let me taste anything else.  That's all, the spices and the method of cooking are spot on for me.  You can make your own naan to go with it, but if you have a Trader Joe's near you - they have terrific frozen naan in their freezer section.

My daughter really enjoyed this. I followed the recipe exactly but next time I may sub tomato sauce for the puree as it was a little dry. Thankyou Vaijayanti.

This was great! I couldn't find garam masala (or most of the components) in my grocery, so I used a mix of curry powder, ginger, cinnamon, and a little pepper, and still got a great dinner (plus great leftovers).

Not bad at all!  I wasn't certain what was meant by "tomato puree" so I used an 8 0z can of tomato sauce w/ a tablespoon of tomato paste.  I also put in an extra 3 cloves of crushed garlic in w/ the tomato mixture.  Overall it was very good, but doesn't have that deep flavor that many dishes in the restaurants have- I haven't been able to mimic that yet.

Great side dish! I hate peas I successfully used frozen lima beans, also used greenbeans before. I added a dash of curry and had to make the garam marsala from the mixture another reviewer suggested. I've also tried it with and without sugar, both good! My wok doesn't have a top and it wasn't cooking so I laid flat a piece of foil on top-cooked perfectly, and surprisingly quickly.

I hate to give a medium review, but I really only kind of liked this dish, just personal preference.  It was spicy but didn't have much flavor, sadly.  My family didn't like it very much either, although we did all agree that it tasted better with a little nonfat yogurt with orange peel.

very good, but lacks a bit of flavor. I added more of every spice to make it more tasty. it also needed more salt. It became soo thick and heavy, so the next day, I mixed it in with cooked pasta, and added some of the pasta water to loosen it up a bit. Now the kids like it more. All in all, it's good if we make the right modifications.

Not particularly authentic Indian, but delicious as a side dish and very good over rice.  I also added some peas to round it out.

Not bad, but bland. This could have definitely used some more spices. Furthermore, the potatoes came out under cooked. I would maybe parboil them if you are going to try this recipe.

I cut down the ingredients, but not the spices, since I was just making it for me and figured I could handle the spices...big mistake, there was WAY too much salt.  I think it's got potential though, so I'll try it again.

This was easy to make and a big hit with my family (which I haven't had many of since trying to cook vegan!)  Next time I make it I'll add some water and double the puree and spices to make it more liquidy, but the flavor of this dish is great!

This was wonderful. I followed the directions but also took in what others said about it being bland so I threw in some curry and cumin, microwaved 2 potatoes (4 would of been to much, but I was only making it for 2 and it was still to much) for 2.5 min which I think really helped, I couldn't of seen them being cooked the way it was written without adding more time. I also added more cilantro because I love it and just enough water in the end to make a smooth texture rather than sticky or clumpy.

Oh yum!  This recipe was easy & delicious.  I used my new pressure cooker for the very first time to make this recipe tonight & it was done in a jiffy - 8min after reaching proper pressure.  I did saute the onions in the oil along w/ freshly grated ginger & garlic (I didn't have any ginger garlic paste) and the bay leaf before adding the remaining ingredients & sealing the pressure cooker, but I think I may skip the extra step next time & just throw it all in together.  I also didn't wait to add the pureed tomato & remaining spices; I just added them with the potatoes & peas just before sealing the cooker.  I was short one potato, so I added a sweet potato in its place and it was great (if you do that, I suggest omitting the sugar).  I also added a bit of cumin, turmeric, and mustard seed and a dash of red chili powder.  Instead of plain salt, I added hibiscus salt (I bought it on a whim and had yet to really put it to use).  I also added a can of coconut milk and about a tbs of butter.  I know that's a lot of changes, but it seemed like this recipe would be very forgiving.  All and all, we were extremely happy with the results.  Next time, I may increase the peas to 1 1/2c, but otherwise, I thought the ratios were perfect.  I served this with rice, buttered soft pita, and a simple raita made with about 1/2c lowfat plain yogurt, a dash each of salt, garlic powder, and cumin, 1/2 of a peeled and pureed cucumber and about 1tsp pureed tomato.  Thank you for a great recipe! YUM

This was yummy. I made it to use up some ingredients I had gotten for other recipes. I think it could use 2 full teaspoons of the garam masala. Also, my potatoes got overcooked and mushy, so the cook time may need to be decreased a little. This is good with rice mixed in with it. I served this with white rice on the side, as well as cucumber slices drizzled with Cilantro-Mint Raita.

Wow. So good! Pretty easy - simple ingredients that make a fantastic meal! Read other reviews and used an entire bag of peas. I also added more tomatoes - a can of tomato sauce. I didn't add salt or sugar, and it was delicious!

Supprized - I really don't like curry and I dreaded the idea of having a dish with no meat; but for something that I found via searching for the only ingrediants I had at hand the other day it turned out to be a big hit! I added more peas and used diced tomatoes and a bit of tomato paste to thiken it up. I overcooked the potatoes when I boiled them first (on purpose as was in a hurry)so the sause ended up having a really nice thick texture to it. Was a wonderful last minute meal.

This was just okay for me.  My husband really like it though.  It was a little too tangy-I prefer some heat in my Indian dishes.  I much prefer Aloo Phujia from this site because it is a lot spicier.

The amounts of the ingredients seems off there's a ton of onions and four large potatoes don't seem to balance it out.  Sticking to the directions for the spices made this dish almost dull and less like an Indian dish I had to add a lot more until it was mild and it still wasn't very good.  I had to use a whole cup of tomato puree to make all the ingredients wet enough and could have used more.  And I parboiled the potatoes because someone said the cook time wasn't long enough.  Also I think you need to cook the onions longer than "until tender."   This was only a shadow of a great dish.  I will probably never use this particular recipe again

I used my yellow curry powder instead of the spices individually, plus garam masala and it came out a bit too spicy but still delicious. I also added fresh ginger instead of a paste, and that was lovely.

We enjoyed this meal very much with Roti and long grain rice. We didn't have ginger garlic, but used fresh crushed garlic and ginger powder (about a teaspoon). We also added salt and extra cilantro.

I really enjoyed this. I was in a rush, so i cut and microwaved the potatoes in a bowel of water while i prepared the onions. I added additional  garam masala and a pinch of cayenne.

I followed other comments and punched up the spices. The flavour was very good but I would have liked it to be “saucier” for putting on top of rice.

I made this, and it was so easy! I didn't add the sugar, and I used 3 tablespoons of oil made with chili peppers. It was fantastic!!! I usually don't deviate from a recipe, but I'm trying to minimize our sugar intake, and we love a little spice in our foods. The prep is the longest part. If you'd like to try adding a vegetarian option into your meal planning, this is lovely with a side of jasmine rice. Thank you!

This tasted authentic, at least as compared to what I've had in Indian restaurants.  I cut way down on the potatoes and cooked to almost done tenderness before adding the peas.  I also added a little extra garam masala.

Terrible! I don't understand why this recipe gets good reviews. I had to salvage the dish by adding butter and sour cream, which are both ingredients I'm trying to avoid. Never making this again.

I always hate it when people say "this is so good but I made these changes"... but here I am saying that. Only made a few substitutions. First, I couldn't find ginger garlic paste, so I made my own. About 1:1 ginger and garlic, plus some oil, a little salt, and turmeric. I put 1/4 cup water in before I left the potatoes to cook. Also I realized that I had tomato paste, not purée, so I subbed diced tomatoes plus a heaping teaspoon of tomato paste. And also I doubled the amount of garam masala.  Served over basmati rice (rinsed and add cumin seed before cooking, then add a little butter after). 

This is delicious!! 10/10 will make again. The ginger really makes this imo.

I should probably start off by saying that my entire family is of Italian ethnicity with the idea that Italian cuisine is at the tippity-top in comparison with all others. After having been raised cooking Italian food, when I became a vegan, sometimes there wasn't anything to eat. Trust me, you can only have sauce with pasta for so many nights in a row. I made this recipe after having it a few times in various restaurants and dosa shops. To say that this is restaurant quality wouldn't even be coming close to doing it justice. It's warm, flavorful, smooth, and completely animal-product-free. I would recommend it for anyone who wants to start off cooking Indian cuisine, be introduced to mild curries, or just get a new favorite dish. Buon appetito!

My boyfriend and me made this dish and it was wonderful! We cooked the potatoes longer because I read a review here suggesting it and definitely the potatoes were awesome. Overall we were very satisfied with the dish.

I just love this recipe! I've never reviewed anything here, but after having this for supper for the umpeenth time, I have to. I use the spices exactly as in the recipe. Depending on how much time I have I'll par-boil veggies to make it quicker and also use various root veggies - potatoes, carrots, rutabagas, parsnips. It has a perfect amount of heat for me. Biggest problem is when to stop eating!

This recipe was just ok for me, I love indian food, especially with potatoes, but the pureed tomatoes seemed to make this recipe too thick for me, I think it would have been much better with tomato sauce.  I didn't have a problem with the potatoes cooking, as other reviewers had.

I am giving this recipe 3stars as it was very low on spice. Also, omitted the sugar as most of the ingredients, potato, peas, tomato and onions already have a sweet taste. I guess other reviewers also experiencing the dish being low on spice could also be because of jacked up sweetness in the dish.

Tried it last night. This the first main that my wife, Michelle, has eaten without meat for at least 20 years but the potatoes got past that "the end of the world is nigh" feeling in her Irish/Polish blood. That plus the excellent, delicious flavour. Unlike many reviewers we did not rewrite the menu, we did use our own home-made tomato sauce (ketchup)and we forgot the coriander (cilantro) but we would thoroughly recommend this dish. Michelle's rating was 'superb!'

One point, there is no way the spuds will cook in 15 minutes unless you do what we did which was to steam them separately and that took 15 minutes using bamboo steamers and very rapidly boiling water.

The blend of spices was pretty good.  This needs much longer to cook the potatoes unless you chop them very fine.  Be sure you only use the amount of potatoes in the recipe.  Otherwise you have almost no sauce!

My 2 year old son loved this so much!  I substituted and changed things around a little, and it was still awesome - and very, very easy.  We served it with a very simply whole-wheat roti (another family favorite here).

Very good recipe. But the potatoes need to cook longer. Add the peas when the potatoes are almost ready, or else they'll lose their flavor and become too soft. The comments on how to make the ginger paste were really helpful. Will do it again, thank you!

AWESOME!  it tasted like a restaurant entree and really wasn't that hard!  don't forget to stir a lot at the beginning, though.  the recipe doesn't tell you to do that and i burnt a little of the bottom.

This was quite simple and really good.  It took awhile for the potatoes to get soft, but once they did, mmmmmmm.  I added a lot of garam masala because I love it.  We had it over brown rice.  I will definitely make it again.

This is flavorful!  It has a sweet taste.  I used 1 8 oz can of tomato sauce, and added water.  Also be sure to stir the potatoes while they're cooking; I burnt some at the bottom of the pot.
