This is it!!! Members of my family cooked this for years, and after they passed on, we couldn't find it anywhere. Thanks so very much for posting - this will be on the table at my house this year!

I hate to do this but I followed the directions to the letter and this did not work at all. Cheez Whiz is very expensive so I felt I must speak up for those who plan on making this in the future. Everything appeared to be normal until I pulled it out of the oven after 30 minutes and tried to spoon it out. There is not enough liquid to cook the rice. The rice sunk to the bottom and was still hard as a rock. I have read the recipe over and over thinking that I surely missed a step but I did not.  The only thing I can think of is that maybe you are supposed to use Minute Rice which cooks faster and doesn't require near the liquid.  If you are planning on using long grain rice I highly recommend that you precook it before it goes into the oven with the other ingredients.

There wasn't enough liquid to cook the rice. Needed to be baked about an hour in order for the rice to get done. I also had to add extra milk and water. I think that the recipe should have called for MINUTE RICE. This was such an expensive disappointment.

Loved this recipe. I don't like celery so I used green onion in place of it. I also used yellow rice and added a dash of hotsauce before putting in the oven. This is the only change I made. Delicious!!

I made this for Thanksgiving lunch, and it was a BIG hit with all! Thank you so much for posting it. 
Thank you to the ladies who gave the feedback re: the rice taking longer to cook than expected/hoped. Because of those reviews, I amended the rice portion of the recipe. First, I used Uncle Ben's Boil-n-a-Bag rice (2 packages), and MOSTLY cooked it prior to mixing it with the other ingredients. That was THE ONLY CHANGE I made to the recipe, and it worked out beautifully in the time posted in the recipe. My husband was the most pleased with the results, and that is all that matters to me. Again, thanks for posting the recipe, and thanks to those who reviewed before me!

a few changes .... cream of mushroom is preferable.  Also the rice needs to be pre-cooked.  I use cubed Velveta and a few Durkee onions for the last 5 minuets is a nice touch if you have them on hand.
