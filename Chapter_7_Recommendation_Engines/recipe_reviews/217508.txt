I NEVER review anything online but felt I needed to with this recipe.  It was completely different than our usual rotation of dinners and the flavor was awesome!  The only adjustments I made was cutting the red pepper to 1/2 tsp. (still plenty spicy for us) and using 12 oz of whole wheat spaghetti.  I would probably use 8-10 oz next time.  (there are only 3 of us) This is really worth a try.  Awesome flavors and looks impressive too!  I cut the ham into small matchsticks per the Allrecipes magazine.

Very tasty. Make sure you matchstick or chop the ham so it mixes well.

This was very good.  Reminds me of Pasta Alla Grecia but made with ham rather than pancetta.  I did have to add a 1/2 cup of pasta water to thin it out slightly.  I also omitted the walnuts because I had a guest who was allergic, but next time I'll add them.

Outstanding!  I was out of parsley, so I substituted julienned uncooked zucchini.  I didn't add the garlic to the saute mix until the last minute, or so, to prevent it from developing a bitter taste.  This is a quick meal if you chop the toppings while the pasta water is coming to a boil, then salute everything while the pasta is cooking.  I think a little lemon zest would add a nice fresh note to this, too.  The parmesan cheese was sprinkled on the individual servings at the table.

Phenomenal! I added julienne'd zucchini JUST after stirring in the ham.  Absolutely awesome. Allowed individuals (hubby & myself) to add the parm cheese as we served, avoiding pasta that was stuck together & oily on reheat. This recipe is a keeper. I'm passing it along to my boys and relatives. (Next time, I'm adding in some sauteed mushrooms. YUM!)

My family and I loved this recipe. It's delicious. Thank you for sharing it. The only deviation from the original recipe is I used more cheese.
