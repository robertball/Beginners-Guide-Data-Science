Absolutely fantastic! Like the previous reviewer, I needed to use up some very old prunes. This is insanely easy to make and extremely delicious. I followed the recipe to a T, except for using an 11x7 inch baking dish, using soy milk, and using half of a vanilla pod instead of the vanilla sugar. Tried it warm about 20 minutes after taking it out of the oven and it was perfect. The baking time was spot on. I too am excited to try it cold tomorrow. Thank you for a wonderful recipe that I will make for years to come! ***** Update: I tried this cold after it was in the fridge all night. Surprisingly, I like it MUCH better warm or at room temperature.

I wanted to use leftover prunes and found this recipe.  I made it as written with the exception of the vanilla sugar.  I added 1 tsp vanilla instead.  The presentation was impressive, the preparation simple and the result was delicious!!!!  My husband was equally impressed.  We just ate it, warm after about ten minutes.  I want to try it cold tomorrow.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent recipe! I did not have baking powder so, I separated the eggs, put the yolks with the flour, sugar, milk,ect.. blended them in a blender then, I whipped/folded the whites in last. Baked beautifully. Used some real vanilla bean too...Yummy

I really liked this dessert; it is definitely one I will make again. I just have one question though; why is it necessary to leave the rum out when children are eating it, if the rum cooks out while it is baking?

I never eat Far Breton before, the first time i made this is to impressed my french husband which is from Brittany. I tried this recipe few times without alcohol or without vanilla sugar. It still taste great no matter what your choice.  I use sunsweet pitted prunes and add Grand Marnier in my cake instead of rum. Nowadays i make Far Breton  at least once a month, the french (my husband and his colleague) really love it.

Mine turned out a little wet and it curdled wishing it would be smooth and dense like the first picture.  I did like the crust though.  Update: took it out from the fridge and it did look like the pictures but the overall taste was just okay.

I kept it in the oven a little longer to let it sit. It was amazing overall. Glad I picked this to use my leftover prunes.

Mine did not come out like the picture. It was wetter and not as flan like. Also the top and bottom was burned. Although the taste was great. Will try this again.
