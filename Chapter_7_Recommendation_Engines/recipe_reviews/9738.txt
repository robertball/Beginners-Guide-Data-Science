These cookies are a little less sweet than the usual molasses/ginger/spice cookie, so they're great with cocoa egg nog, or other sweet drinks.  We made ours rolled in powdered sugar and about half the size in the directions.  They end up like little spice cakes, very cute and welcomed at the office.

Im really not sure what I did wrong. I just went back & read all the reviews again & everyone loved these cookies. I do not. I read & re-read the recipe. I followed it to a T.  My batter was so dry I only made 24 out of the 60 cookies it was supposed to make. It wouldnt roll together & I got frustrated with it. I think this is a travesty in my house! Unheard of!

My husband and kids loved these cookies. I also "thumb printed" a portion of the cookies and filled them with jam. My house smelled wonderful of ginger and spice.

I love making these cookies at Christmas time! Don't flatten them or overbake them though! They really are some of the best ginger cookies because they stay nice and soft!

These cookies were really easy to make and yummy.
My husband who normally doesn't like Ginger Cookies even liked them. They are best warm from the oven.

Delicious and simple,  these came out better than I expected! I pressed them down a little bit and them came out with a crispy shell and soft inside. Even the bf, who doesn't like sweets and only crunchy cookies, declared these his new favorite. I sprayed the measuring cup with Pam before measuring the molasses so it wouldn't stick. Thanks!

I think that this was not as I expected.  The cookies were dry and I was hoping for something moist.  My mother made a ginger cookie which was similar to this one after I added a whole lot more liquid.

These cookies came out amazing! I was afraid they were going to be too strong, but I was way off! They were great warm out of the oven and my family loved them. I sprinkled a little extra sugar on them to make them a tad bit sweeter. I will be using this recipe again for the holidays.

These were very good! I halved the recipe and subbed half the flour for whole wheat. I also added in chopped crystalized ginger for an extra ginger kick and it was amazing!

Made the recipe as-is except for two things.  One, I had no ground cloves so I used all spice.  Two, I found the batter sweet enough without rolling the cookies in sugar so I left that step out.  The taste was great.  My only complaint is that after they had cooled for 10 or 15 minutes, the outsides were mighty hard.  I've thrown them in the refrigerator in a sealed box.  I'll see how they are later tonight.  Update: the cookies out of the fridge are actually better than they were at room temperature.  The outsides are certainly stiffer than the middle but not 'hard' and I'm pleased with the results.

Nice, rich flavor.  Great with coffee on a cold winter morning!  I chilled the dough a little before baking.

Incredibly easy and full-flavored cookie!  I made a half-recipe and it was just right for our small family.  Fluffy and soft with a crispy shell.  These cookies get better with age: if you eat one right out of the oven and love it, just wait until you taste it when it's cooled off! Yum!

Yum...Made as written, but mixed some sugar and red sugar on a plate and rolled them in that....it's Christmas time!  We just had some with a cup of tea on a cold day.  Will make these again.  I put half in the freezer so we can have them next week. I always freeze cookies to have them on hand when my son comes over.

These cookies were amazing.  I substituted real ginger for ground ginger and they came out really flavorful.  I would recommend this recipe.

Really excellent cookie!  The batter is kind of sticky and hard to work with, but it's worth it.  The finished product was perfect.  I didn't make any changes or substitutions; I thought the recipe was great.

These aren't bad, but they lack a bit of oomph for me.  or star power.  whatever you want to call it.  The spices just don't shine in these cookies, and I'm a little addicted to flavor.  They aren't bad, though, just not up to my standards, weird as they are.  ;o)  I made the dough this morning and had to put it in the fridge, which led to very small very round cookies that didn't flatten until I squashed them with a spatula.  Don't know if it would happen again if I didn't refrigerate, but at least they flatten well.  I flattened after baking and before baking; I think I prefer flattening immediately after baking bc they crinkle up and don't look so uninteresting if you flatten before baking.  thanks for the recipe!

Loved these.  Did not have molasses at home so instead used honey and used some brown sugar in with the white sugar.  Made half the recipe.  Delish.  A keeper for sure.

This recipe is fantastic! I love the light flavor and how many it makes.  I like to use a cookie press so I changed a few things to make it work. First I added 1/4 cup water to make it squeezable. I changed the temp to 325f and shortened the cooking time to 7 min for smaller designs and 10 min for the larger ones. It worked perfectly. Perfect with tea or coffee.

These are a great cookie.Not only is the flavour and sweetness perfect the texture and ease to assemble are a bonus. I added 2 tsp. of freshly grated ginger and I baked them 13 min. and they were crunchy all around the edges, soft inside. Perfect!
 THANKS.

I just took these cookies out of the oven and tried one. It was good but not better than that. I find the clove is a very strong spice and a little goes a long way. 1 1/2 tsp is too much. The ginger gets lost in it. I followed the recipe to the T but next time I will put 1/4 tsp clove and 2 tsp ginger and sprinkle some sugar on top.

The cookies had a good taste and texture the first day, but quickly got dry then simply hard to eat.  They didn't flatten very much, and kept their spherical shape through baking.  I think it's on the right track for a good holiday cookie, but I probably won't make this particular recipe again.

Good flavor,  very quick and easy to make, my kids helped, and we got right to baking without having to refrigerate the dough first as with most cookie recipes.  The texture was fluffy and cake-like, which the kids loved. I prefer more chewy, so I may cut down the baking soda next time.  We will definitely be making them again.

These come out great when prepared exactly as written. That said, if you like bold, spicy taste, boost the amount of the spices by as much as a quarter teaspoon, and be a little more generous with molasses. They come out with a real zip that pushes them a notch above the average. BUT only if you like bold taste and spicy.

These are really delicious! A little crispy on the outside but chewy inside. Not too sweet, which is perfect. I followed the directions exactly.

These were one of the fastest to go at Christmas. ..Once mixed somewhat I used my hands to squeeze and mix more heat from hands helps amalgamate everything! !

Making these little gems gluten free is easy by just substituting a good quality GF flour cup for cup. I also added a 1/2 tsp. cream of tarter for a crisp cracked shell and soft melting middle.  So, so yummy and way too addictive!
