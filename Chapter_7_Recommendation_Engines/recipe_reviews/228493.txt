This was really, really good.  The only changes I made were instead of the Rotel, I used fresh tomatoes and green peppers, and Frank's Hot Sauce.  I also used half and half instead of heavy cream.  Absolutely delicious, will definitely make again.

My husband scolded me for having been married to him for the last 7 years and never serving this to him before.  He said it was the best soup I have ever made.  Thanks for a fantastic recipe!

Alterations: I didn't have celery, green beans or mushrooms on hand, but it was still good.  I did have 1/2 cup dry lentils, so I threw them in at the same time as the potatoes to add heartiness since I was missing some ingredients.  I also added some salt--not sure how much as I did it to taste, but it was quite a bit.

The soup was quite spicy, so I added a little milk to the kids' bowls after I served it, which also helped with the temperature for them. Hubby and I ate it and lived it full strength.

This soup was a nice change of pace for us.  Love all of those fresh veggies!  The broth is excellent, and the trio of dill, thyme, and rosemary works wonderfully in this recipe.  A few tweaks, I used about 1/2 lb hot italian sausage, browned and removed from the pot to be added back later.  I just eyeballed the amount of veggies, and probably ended up doubling most.  I sauteed the sliced mushroom with the onion/celery/carrot mix, sauteed in the sausage drippings,  and used low sodium chicken broth, about 8 cups total.  I also used a bit more heavy cream, and celery salt to season.  A nice summer-into-fall soup!  Thanks for sharing your recipe with AR.

I gobbled this up like it was my last meal. Followed the cook's notes to make it vegetarian & used 6 cups veggie broth, plus a little more as it cooked down. I sauteed the mushrooms with the veggies, like another reviewer and added a shake or two of salt to my bowl (which I usually need to do if the recipe calls for chicken broth and I use veggie instead.) So delicious and colorful with the perfect amount of heat. Might use the Rotel tomatoes with mild chiles next time for my husband who kept commenting on how spicy it was. I usually don't like spicy food, but this was the right amount for me.

We made some changes based on what we had in the house. Didn't have whipping cream or celery but we did have cream of celery. Doubled the amount of kale because we love it and added garbanzo beans for some added protein and iron. Very hearty.

This is delicious.. only change I made was to use sour cream instead of heavy cream. My canned tomatoes had diced jalepenos and it made for a really nice spiciness, but not overwhelming at all.

I make soup often & I'm my own worst critic & I loved this.
Don't hate on me for the changes ( I had to work with what I had on hand).
I used noodles in place of potatoes. No green beans or celery. Fresh tomatoes in place of canned.
I followed the seasoning to the T. 
Will make again for sure.

I followed the directions almost exactly. I substituted a can of evaporated milk for the heavy cream, and used a tablespoon of Italian seasoning in place of the parsley, thyme, and rosemary. It turned out delicious!
