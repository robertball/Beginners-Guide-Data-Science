I think the thing I liked about this granola is its simplicity.  Many have too many ingredients that compete with each other, rather than complementing each other.  Grandma Dalley found just the right balance of oats, nuts, and honey.  Very nice topping for my morning granola.

I made this for my granddaughter who is allergic to tree nuts and peanuts-- and doesn't like regular raisins. I substituted  50:50 mixture of hulled pumkin seeds (pepitas) and hulled sunflower seeds (gerbs) for the nuts, and craisins for the golden raisins. Turned out great!

I have made this recipe many times now.  I keep the measurements, but add a different combination of nuts and leave out the salt most of the time.  This is a great healthy alternative to store bought.

This was not too sweet, which worked perfect since it is getting mixed into sweetened yogurt.  Don't like raisins so used dried cranberries instead :)  Super easy and simple!

Turned out great. Very simple, easy to follow, with good results. The trickiest part was baking until "lightly browned" since it has honey and cinnamon it's that color to start with. So to be safe I baked at a slightly lower temp and tested the nuts at 15 minutes. Ended up taking about 20 minutes to get done.

I substituted oil for butter and a mix of pecans and cashews for the almonds.

I used rough chopped walnuts and craisins, really good on my morning yogurt.

This was very easy and simple to make with a few pantry ingredients.  Definitely keep an eye on it while it is in the oven so not to overcook it. Overall it was very good, especially over yogurt.

I made this recipe and changed it slightly.  I used walnuts and pecans?. 
I also used chopped craisins instead of the raisins. Baked the granola mixture on two cookie sheets lined with parchment paper.   This worked out well and handy as well for transferring to storage container when the granola cooled off.
