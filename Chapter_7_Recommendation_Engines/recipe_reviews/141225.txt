My husband and I gave this recipe a strong 7, based on a scale from 1-10 (10 being the best). Next time we make it, we will use a little less olive oil and more black pepper. Other than that, it was very tasty. It will definitely become a recipe in the permanent family recipe book.

This recipe puts a different spin on pasta salad.  I replace ingredients 3 thru 10 with about 5 ounces bottled pesto sauce and add a squirt of italian dressing for some zip.  Shared the recipe with several friends and their families loved it too!

I loved this recipe! I am already planning on making it for an upcoming party. It was full of flavor and easy to make. I would recommend anyone to make this for parties, potlucks. It makes a lot and is such a great tasty dish you have to share.

I've learned to make my own pesto sauce and we I liked it.  Didn't have the nuts or sausage or a lot of the ingredients, but we made a poor mans version and the pesto was right on.  Thanks!

I was looking for a cold pasta salad dish, this was not it.  This dish is much tastier warm.  Also, the sausage was overpowering.  If i make it again, i will use much less sausage or leave it out.

This is a winner at our house, especially in the summer months.  I just buy premade pesto, and I do add some Italian salad dressing.

I made this for a group of people many of them are picky eaters and it went over very well. And I loved it. I used fresh cilantro instead of parsley and I skipped the mozzarella all together. I used a combination of black olives and kalamata olives which was a nice touch.

This is really good. I skipped the butter, used half beef smoked sausage and half jalapeno & cheddar sausage, different pesto, and shredded reduced fat mozzarella.

the "fresh" sausage was not a great addition. The pesto was too oily. Just not a fan or a hit.
