Good recipe but lots of sugar to start. I found a fix for gooey divinity flops after 4 different attempts from various Divinity recipes. Like others have said the key is pouring in the cooked syrup very slowly in slim streams while beating with the eggs whites. Pouring too much at once will cook the egg whites. Then keep beating (in my case it took 15 minutes) until it starts to lose its gloss. But if it is still gooey, here's how to save it:

Reheat the mixture - microwave if you have a glass bowl or put metal pan in very hot water, so it gives your mixer a rest and makes the candy warmer and more pliable. Then start mixing again. If it still wont set up, add about 1/2 to 1 tsp of hot water to the mix then sprinkle in about 1/2 to 1 cup powdered sugar while mixing ON SLOW. It will start to set up much faster now and it changes the texture from a smooth chewy candy to a more fudge-like texture, which I actually like better. I know this is just adding more sugar but other Divinity recipes call for less sugar in the original list of ingredients. 

ALSO: Try this for a wonderful new flavor.
When it's time to add the Vanilla, instead add the following: 
 1/4 tsp. Peppermint Extract
 1/4 tsp. Butter flavor Extract 
 1/2 tsp. Vanilla Extract
(more or less peppermint or butter extract to taste)
5 - 7 drops Yellow Food Coloring

BUTTER MINT DIVINITY! You won't go back to plain.

Use 1 cup of syrup instead of 3/4. Also add 1/4 tsp. salt.  I wouldn't bother cooking the syrup in two different stages.  Just cook the mixture to 250 degrees.  Otherwise, I think it gives it more potential for failure. Don't stir the syrup mixture while it's boiling or it can sugar.   Add 1 tsp. vanilla or almond extract at the very end.  Doing it this way has made some fantastic divinity.  Remember, don't make divinity when it's humid outside or it will flop.

I have not tried this recipe as it is very similar to the one I have used for years.  You are not supposed to make divinity when it rains as it supposedly will not set BUT my recipe says that if it is humid remove 1 tablespoon of water.  Since I live in Texas where it is always humid, I always remove the water and my recipe works even when it is raining!!!

These are really good but I found that they took a while before they would keep there shape so I would just let the mixture sit in the bowl for a couple of minutes and then go back and finish mixing. That's what worked for me.

This turned out perfect!  The consistency turned out exactly like it should, and all in all, it was very yummy!  

I found the directions a LITTLE hard to follow, as "soft ball stage" is harder in my book than just saying "330-340 degrees"..

This is a really great divinity. I added a 1/2 cup of dried blueberries and 1/2 cup of walnuts. To add a little more zip. The little blueberries made the candy even sweeter. However, I had guests from Maine that loved this that is why I used the blueberries.

Cooking the sugar mixture to the two different stages was difficult since it got too hot between trying to finish step 2 and starting step 3.  The result was more like taffy.  Though, I know divinity is not an easy candy to make anyway.

My late mother always made divinity for Christmas and this recipe is as close as I've found.  Be careful not to overheat your mixer! (speaking from experience here).  Try beating the last few minutes by hand - you'll save your mixer and earn some arm muscle.

Very tasty! My mixer motor got quite hot before the mixture ever turned dull. So, be careful. . . unless you want a new mixer. . . ;-) I used both vanilla and almond extract, thinking that the almond would work nicely with the pecans. Not the loveliest candy I've ever made, but both husband and son approved of the taste.

I've always wanted to make divinity, but always heard how difficult it was, so kind of put it off. But, my daughter loves divinity, so I decided to try this recipe. Ta Da!!!! We have perfect divinity, first batch I've everade. So, thank you!! I just made sure to beat it until it was dull and had no problems. Thanks again!

I have made this in every type of weather. People try to pay me to make this Divinity for them. I don't like dry Divinity, I use 3 egg whites instead of 2. I also use 2 teaspoons of vanilla instead of just 1. Be sure to use a candy thermometer, and watch that thing like a hawk. The second it gets close to the hard ball stage pull it off of the heat. The syrup continues to heat up even though it's been removed from its heat source. Pour very slowly into the egg white mixture by a thin ribbon. Don't beat too long, or your Divinity will be dry and crumbly. If needed, continue whipping using a strong spoon. I drop by spoonfuls onto waxed paper. Then take a whole pecan, and press it into the middle. They are beautiful, white, and fluffy. They melt in your mouth, and everyone begs for me to make them for office parties, and for Holiday gifts.

Always get the second half of your sugar to hard ball stage (300*) before incorporating it into the first half and your egg whites. It took 2 batches but finally figured out that the second boil must reach hard ball. If not, your candy will never lose its sheen and set up. 
Just like grandmas recipe. Really super rich so go small on the dropping onto parchment also.  Work fast after beating mixture but if your mixture sets up in the bowl, nuke it for about 10 seconds to loosen it up so you can get it dropped on the paper.
