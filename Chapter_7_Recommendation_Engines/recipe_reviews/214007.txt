I tried this upon the recommendation of a friend. while I am not a big fan of lamb, this was very good!! I used a roast instead of leg of lamb. Wish I had marinated for a bit longer. The roast came out tender and moist. I did add a little cayenne pepper for some heat. I also took the advice of the author and used dijon mustard. Will try this again!

Excellent recipe. I just made this dish with a lamb roast we picked up at the grocery store this week. I would eat this again!

This recipe is very tasty. First I must state I see recipes as an outline, that I do not measure, I estimate, I add  ingredients.  I used a sweet hot mustard and a little white wine.  I also added some greek seasonings, and smoked paprika.  The lamb is tender and favorful as the potatoes soak up the favors so well. 
I found that it took about 1 1/2hrs in the oven.

Lamb did not turn out the way I hoping for it to. I rate this a three because, although I did not care much for the flavor, the texture came out great. Lamb seasoning was a bit too bland for me. Otherwise, thank you for posting!!

REALLY GOOD! The orange is not a strong flavor, just very subtle and brings out the flavor of the lamb well.  I used a "lamb rub" mix (a variety of spices, rosemary, oregano, pepper, cumin etc.) in place of the oregano and this recipe was superb.  I also used spicy brown mustard as this was what we had in the fridge. This will be one we make again.

This was very good.  I used stone ground dijon mustard from Trader Joe's and a large orange for fresh squeezed.   This was more than enough for a whole boneless leg. Served at Christmas dinner to a very happy family.  I might try fresh oregano next time and reduce the pan dripping for a sauce.
