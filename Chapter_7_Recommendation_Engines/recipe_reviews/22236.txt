I'm sorry, Betty Crocker, but I tried this recipe twice, and the result was a dry mess.  The uncooked noodles needed to draw moisture from somewhere, so the chicken mixture was dry, and there was not enough pasta sauce to compensate.  I would either double or triple the sauce, or cook the manicotti first, and reduce the cooking time.  I have made dozens of recipes on this site, and this was the worst.  Sorry.

This is very easy to make and tastes fantastic, but you definitely need more sauce, about 36 to 40 oz.  Also, my cheese was browned after only 45 minutes, while the pasta wasn't quite done enough, so be sure to bake it on a low oven shelf, or add the cheese during the last 30-45 minutes of cooking.  Definitely worth trying!

THIS WAS PRETTY TASTY I USED CHICKEN FLAVORED PASTA SAUCE, AND NEXT TIME I WILL USE MORE. THE MOST TIME CONSUMING THING WAS TO STUFF THE MANICOTTI NOODLES. NO LEFT OVERS FOR THIS ONE.
