This was okay.  A friend recommended it to me, but I'm not a fan of fruit drinks, so I didn't love this.

We really enjoyed this beverage... One word of warning though, it looks an awful lot like iced tea so be careful who has access to it!!  We will definitely make this one again.

This is great!  Tastes like lemonade! Only spiked! Remain seated at all times following the first couple drinks, does tend to sneak up on you! :-)

I thought this drink sounded terrible, but when the ingredients are mixed together, it's delicious!  Goes down a little too easily though so be careful...this drink can be dangerous!

Wasn't really sure what to expect, but I'm glad I tried it. It's really pretty tasty and I can see how this would taste really good on a hot summer day. One reviewer said they thought it tasted like a Mike's Hard Lemonade, and it does.

We thought this tasted strange. A little bitter.  We added two cans of lemondade concentrate and it tasted much better.

Tastes great and it's extremely versatile! First I made it with Ellie's Brown Ale and 7's whiskey, and that was pretty good, then I tried Shiner Bock Ruby Redbird and 7's and it was extremely tasty! Thanks for the great recipe!
Great for parties, and the servings in the recipe would serve maybe 7-12 people depending on how much people are wanting to drink.

I didn't expect to like this because I am not a big fan of whiskey or beer and the thought of them combined just sounded disgusting. Hubby likes them though and I needed a mixed drink to go with my bourbon steak Valentine dinner. I used Jim Beam for the whiskey and chose pink lemonade over the regular in hopes of the finished product being more pink for the occasion. First sip in and I liked it very much. Not sure how this can be possible but it tasted like a strawberry/banana drink with a hint of pineapple? It sounds strange I know but there you have it.

i was sceptical, but gave it a try and it was AMAZING!  even my wife, who doesn't like beer or whiskey loved it!  i adjusted the serving size doen to 2, as that calls for 1 can or bottle of beer.  used 1/8 of a can of the frozen lemonade, next added the 4oz of whiskey, and finally the beer.  stirred it up and enjoyed!  i skipped the ice as the lemonade was enough to cool the drink.
