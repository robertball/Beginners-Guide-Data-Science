Instead of using instant rice, I used brown rice and water. I cut the recipe in half and cooked the brown rice with a ratio of 2:1. After the rice was cooked, I stirred in the pumpkin puree (I used organic pumpkin puree), the original amount of pumpkin pie spice and only about a scant 1/4 cup of brown sugar and a couple tablespoons of butter (we're watching our calories/sugars here). I served it with a float of fat free half-n-half on top. This was quite good, even with my adjustments. This was a great way for me to get extra vitamins into my kids and to use up pantry ingredients to make a filling and tasty breakfast. Next time, I may add a chopped apple or a handful of organic raisins. I also think this might be good with an egg thrown in and a little vanilla, to add a little more protein and to fake you out to think you're having rice pudding.

I was looking for a way to incorporate pumpkin with rice, so I decided to try this.  It tasted pretty good, but didn't go well at all with my meal I planned.  It is very sweet, pretty much just tastes like pumpkin pie, which I expected but I didn't think it would be AS sweet.  I felt like I should have eaten it for dessert instead of a side dish.  It's worth a try, but remember it tastes sweet like pumpkin pie when planning your meal.

This was a pretty straightforward, easy to prepare dish.  It also tastes wonderful!  Obviously like pumpkin pie, but this is a nutritious side dish as well;  pumplin is a great source of fiber and vitamin A.  A big plus is that kids will like this too!

I was in a similar situation and had rice and pumpkin in the fridge and not much else. This is sort of a pumpkin rice pudding in my opinion. We had a greater rice to pumpkin ratio. Also, based on other reviewers, cut down the sugar by 1/2 cup and didn't miss the extra sugar at all.

Awesome! My 15 month old devoured it --- anything that can cause that reaction and still provide vitamins gets a thumbs up from me! I even cut down on everything because I only had a 15oz can of pumpkin on hand. Still yummy :)

Overall we liked this but it is easier to make rice pudding and less expensive. But if you want something with pumpkin for what ever reason like a "pumpkin" party then this is an easy dish to make. It almost was a 4 stars. I would give it 3 and 1/2.

Not much more than just sweet rice.  It's missing something.  Won't make this again.

I meant to follow the recipe when I made this, but the pumpkin puree I thought I took out of the freezer ended up being mashed sweet potatoes.  I made it anyway, adding some pecans and a little heavy cream, and it made a nice breakfast.  I will have to try this again with pumpkin.

The flavors were fine, but the texture was bad.
