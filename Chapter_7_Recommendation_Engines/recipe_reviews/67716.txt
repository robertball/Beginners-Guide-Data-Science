I was looking for a recipe to use up some radishes I had and this was perfect! I did halve the recipe but kept the amount of radishes the same. I also added a little salt. Its really good and I made the best sandwich with it. Spread this on both sides of the bread, then some turkey, tomato, shredded carrots, and sprouts. Yum!

This recipe was good, except that it had no radish flavor, until I added two bunches of radishes. Then, for extra flavor, I added 2 tbsp of mint. My husband loved it!!! he said it was one of the best dips that I have ever made.

I grow Radishes in my garden every year just for this recipe.  It works best with fresh radishes, because they're stronger.  Also I use light cream cheese and have never had a problem with it being too watery.  Perhaps the other reviewer didn't dry the radishes before mincing.

I always save some radishes just to make this dip!! Using cream cheese makes this more of a spread than a dip, I use an 8oz container of sour cream is 10x better!!  Add dill and salt that makes this dip PERFECT!

I would have never thought of this and it is good.  I changed it quite a bit but the base was great.  I used 12 radishes, 4 cloves of garlic, 1 8oz. brick of low fat cream cheese, about 1/3 c. of parmesan cheese and 1/3 cup of low fat mayo.  I baked it for about 30 minutes at 350*.  My bf who says he hates radishes devoured it w/ crackers and veggies!

Mine turned out extremely runny.  I used light cream cheese and was sure to dry the radishes (which were from the farmer's market and might contain more moisture than store-bought?).

This has such a lovely pink color. The only problem I had was that although I am a HUGE garlic fan, the raw-garlic flavor was just too overwhelming for me. Next time I think I would sautee the garlic first, or, maybe just add about a Tbl of garlic powder. I also added a splash each of lemon juice and worcestire, which I thought added just a bit of flavor and was fantastic! Thanks!

Delicious! I made it a bit stronger by using only one 8 oz package of Neufchatel with 4 cloves of garlic and 6 radishes, then used my stick blender to smooth it all out. Turned out super yummy! Guests scraped the dish clean!

How simple and how tasty!
Everyone that would try it loved it.  Had this at a large BBQ.  Some wouldn't try it because it's RADISH DIP, but it's wonderful on crackers, other veggies and even cubed bread!!

So tasty you'd never think it was made so easily and with such minimal ingredients! The perfect thing to do with the last couple radishes left over. I even used it the next day as a dressing for crabcakes.

I used spreadable cream cheese and mine was watery, too.  I think maybe it's the spreadable cheese as opposed to the block of it that made it so watery.

I think this would have worked better if I had mixed in the cream cheese by hand instead of using the food processor.  It was more like a liquid than a dip. Also could have used more radish to the amount of garlic in it.

We get a weekly organic veggie/share box, and I never knew what to do with radishes. The raw garlic makes it real pungent so go easy, two decent sized cloves should do. I used all of the radishes that I had, which was a bunch of 8 or 9, and you could barely make out the radish taste. Mine came out a little watery as well and I think it is due to me pulverizing the radishes before adding the cream cheese. Next time I will barely pulse it and then add the cream cheese for the final blend. I only used one bar and a quarter of cream cheese. Two whole bars seemed excessive. And I did add some salt as another reader suggested. The best thing about this is that it is so versatile! We had it with celery sticks, used it as a spread on Garden Vegetable Ritz crackers, and used in place of mayonnaise on sandwiches. Delicious! Even my four year old was game for trying it, but she said it "has a spicy" (again, go easy on garlic if you want to taste any radish.)

Great concept and if you increase the radish and decrease the garlic, it would be a 5 star dip.  As is, you can't really taste the radish because it just tastes like garlicky cream cheese (and I used pretty good sized radishes).  I did not have a problem with it being runny at all though.

Pretty good as a starting point.  I followed others' suggestions, adding more radishes and thinning it out with sour cream and even plain yogurt.  I tasted it and it was ok, then added salt, pepper, hot sauce, and dill and now it's pretty good. Good way to use up all those radishes!

Easy and delicious! I used radishes from the garden. Great to serve with a fresh veggie tray or on mini bagels.  I cut the recipe in 1/2, added 1 tsp of Accent, Lawry's Seasoned Salt,  1 tsp of white pepper and 3 minced small green onions (white portion). Yummy!

Used apprx 8 radishes from my garden, light cream cheese (only 8 oz) and minced garlic.  What a refreshingly-light and tasty dip!  I served it with butter crackers and dirty martinis per the 'What to Drink' suggestion.  Yummy!

This dip tastes pretty good, but its not something I would ever want to make again.  I was thinking it might taste better with some horseradish and ranch seasoning in it.  I used fresh organic radishes, and the dip did turn out really watery even though I strained them a little bit after blending them up.  If you are going to try this recipe, I recommend straining the radishes thouroughly after blending them.

Happy to locate an option for using radishes. We enjoyed the color (a festive pink) and the spiciness of the dip. I used only half the amount of cream cheese (just one 8 oz low fat pkg), as the radishes I had were a little small. I will definitely make it again and probably keep the concentration. You can always add more cream cheese to taste if you don't want the intense flavor.

Wow! Five stars for ease and taste! Used minced garlic from a jar so I processed four teaspoons with the radishes and then added the cream cheese. The dip itself is really creamy with a nice radishy taste. This is brilliant with fresh celery sticks.

So easy. I would double the radishes for more flavor and I used light cream cheese with no problems.

Excellent dip! I didn't follow the measurements too closely, just kind of eyeballed it. I used minced garlic from a jar instead of fresh to make it easier.

Oh this is good!  I've made it for various parties and such, and never have any left.  I've given the recipe to my sis-in-law, and she's had the same success.  So easy to make, so tasty, but it will give you bad breath.  A small price to pay.  I usually use half cream cheese and half neufchatel cheese so I don't feel so guilty about all the fat.  Doesn't seem to affect the results!

Have mixed reviews about this recipe, it was way too runny and garlicky for my tastes, even though I love garlic. I even added extra radishes and sour cream to try to balance out the flavors. Some people liked it, but I probably won't make it again.

This is a wonderful dip!  Everyone at my work that has tried it has loved it so far.  Next time I make it I might add chopped Buddings beef slices for a little extra flavor and texture.

Made this for my husband tonite. He said it was nothing to write home about. Needed to add salt too. I also added a little milk to make it more suitable as a chip dip. It did get better as it sat awhile though. He thought it was a little too garlicky as well.

This dip is very quick to make and is creamy and refreshing.  Great use for extra radishes.  I made it in the blender instead, and my blender minced the radishes just fine.  Made about 1.5 cups.

Surprisingly good and very easy to make.  I resized the recipe using 1 package of cream cheese, 5 or 6 radishes, and 2 tsp. of minced garlic.  I added a 1/4 tsp. of salt and a dash of pepper. The dip improved overnight but there was a bit of liquid which I stirred back in.  Next time I'll add more radishes and garlic to enhance the overall flavor.

Like others, mine turned out very runny--like salad dressing.  That's what I'm using it for.  I also found I needed to add salt for flavor.  I wonder if the runniness is a function of how large the radishes are. Mine were on the big side.   I also used an organic cream cheese brand that has  little more moisture than the most popular brand.

3 star because it's a great idea.....however, the raw garlic, there will be no scoring with my date tonight.  This would have been better without the raw garlic, perhaps roasting would be better. I did add salt and cracked pepper, served with roasted plantains. To help save the dip after realizing the raw garlic was crazy strong I added some cayenne pepper, it helped a little. Next time I'll either roast the garlic or skip it all together.

Made this because I got watermelon radishes in my most recent produce box.  It was a lovely pink color!  Other than halving the recipe, I didn't change anything because I like to taste a recipe as it was intended to taste before adapting it.  It had a bit too much bite for me personally, but people at the party I brought it to said it wasn't too garlicky / spicy at all.  I'm sure it's just a matter of personal taste - I'm a major wuss when it comes to spice!

www.pantryexperiment.wordpress.com I tried this recipe just as is, only doubled and it was amazing it had this beautiful garlic butter flavor, but to make it even better for my meat hungry husband I added pepperoni and salami, and I altered the cut of the radish a bit. If you want to see my alterations check it out at www.pantryexperimnt.wordpress.com. It was super incredible. I just added to this recipe. You should check it out.

I never really knew what to do with my radishes from my garden so I thought I would give this a try. After reading other reviews I altered it a little. I cut back on the garlic some and, a couple more radishes and a few splashes of tabasco sauce. Instead of two packages of cream cheese I only added one but also added an 8 oz container of sour cream. I folded in some ranch dressing, (just a little) some fresh chopped dill and even some chopped imitation crab meat. It had a great consistency. Not runny at all. Will definitely try it again.

This was just ok.  If you add a few touches - i.e. salt and dill, it really enhances it.  But as the recipe is written, it doesn't deserve 5 stars.

Great way to use up radish from the garden! I used garlic salt instead of fresh garlic as that was what I had on hand, it was great. It's nice and creamy with a little kick from the radish. I wouldn't buy radish just to make the dip but certainly would make again when the radish's pop up.

I really loved the flavor of this spread and I'm not even a big radish fan. It was a great way to use up all the radishes from our CSA box. I love it on slice of bread with sliced radishes and a sprig of parsley. This would be perfect summer party dip and a change from the norm.

This dip is not for people who don't like radishes very much. The radish flavor is too spicy and overpowering. I don't like radishes very much, so I'm trying to find a recipe that will help me like them and this was not it!

A friend of mine made this for a function we had.  I loved it!  I made it today and only needed enough for 3 people to have over a few days, so I only used 1 package of cream cheese.  I used 4 radishes and 3 cloves of garlic.  Might use a bit more of each next time.  I will also use reduced fat cream cheese next time.  This is a keeper.  So good with fresh raw vegetables for dipping!

Creative and different. Not the same dip everyone else makes at a party. I had to add a little water to the radishes and garlic because my food processor just kept throwing them to the edges without chopping them up. I thought this would ruin the recipe, but it was perfect. I made this for adults and kids, but if it were just for adults I'd probably throw in a few extra radishes for more kick.

This was okay, but came out tasting mostly like garlic.  I too halved the cream cheese like other reviewers, but still didn't get the radish flavor I was looking for.  It also got a little runny the next day.

As someone else stated, I was looking for a recipe to use up some radishes I had and this fit the bill perfectly.  We had some of the dip with broccoli and cauliflower and it was just okay.  I used the rest atop slightly salted stacked tomatoes and cucumbers, which was delicious!

Easy, very flavorful and a great way to use up your radishes! I will make this again & again. There is enough flavor to sneak in reduced fat cream cheese for a healthier touch!

I added some green onion because that's my hubby's favorite, the consistency was creamy and perfect for veggies &/or bread to dip in.

Followed recipe exactly and is was merely ok. hubby said it was missing something, so he added 1/2 a package of ranch dressing mix.  That helped, but it still didn't go very fast.  Have half a batch still left in the fridge a week later...might have to throw out :(.

This is a great recipe.  I used some garden vegetable flavored cream cheese.  This is a good veggie dip or use with chips and crackers,  This would also be good served with beef or used as spread on sandwiches.

Very good!  If you are not a fan of garlic, then steer clear.  However, I love the stuff!  :)  The only thing I added was a little bit of salt & some cracked black pepper.  Thanks for sharing!!

Although this tasted pretty good, the smell was so pungent that I was scared to open the container!

Everyone loves this recipe. We always make it for parties and we get lots of compliments. I've started calling it my "husband's famous radish dip" cause it has become quite well known. My husband decided to add dill to this recipe...not a good idea. We just need to find the perfect chips to go with it.

great way to use radishes.  A good mild dip.
