The recipe prepared as written has insane calorie count, I didn't care to much for the flavor. so made it again this time reducing eggs to 2, with only 1 can soup 1/2 cup Chardonnay. With continued tweeking it might work, but as written I just didn't work for me.

06/19/11  Chicken was delicious!!  Substituted onion powder for the dried onion, kept all other ingredients the same.  Baked for 45 minutes and it was done.  Definitely on the "make again" list.

Only changes were added tony's to bread crumbs before coating....2 eggs instead of 4 and used more oil.  Great recipe.

Excellent recipe. I made a few changes, only because  there were several items that I didn't have on hand. I substituted vermouth cooking wine for chardonnay and chicken thighs for chicken breasts, and left out the bread crumbs. The heaping amounts of spices used in this recipe gave the dish some unexpected heat. Will make again.

I halved the recipe and we loved this one! The creamy, cheesy sauce was perfect served over the chicken and some white rice, with green beans to complete the meal. My husband and son both really liked this one as well! I definitely didn't need the full amount of eggs; 1 would have been plenty for the three chicken breast halves I used. (I also didn't use the full amount of seasonings called for, just added to taste.)
