These are really good!  I loved them, and they're addictive.  I made them using a "tender" jerky, rather then the really dry, chewier jerky and they turned out great!  Now that I've tried them, I'd make them for company without hesitation!

I spread the cheeses very thin but they still only covered 6 tortillas, not 10 as the recipe says.  No one in my family thought that they were very good--just fair.

Flavorful little gems. The only recommendation I can make is to chill the rolls prior to slicing.
