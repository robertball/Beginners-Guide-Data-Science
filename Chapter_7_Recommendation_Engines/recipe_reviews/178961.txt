This is very very good! I had some ricotta that needed to be used, and this was the perfect recipe... However, I don't use jarred sauce... EVER. So rather than cook some, I just mixed some tomato puree with salt, pepper, garlic powder, dried basil, and a bit of sugar and then poured it on. It was fantastic. Used warm Baguette to dip. My tummy thanks you.

I followed the recipe, although I did sprinkle the sauce with pizza seasonings.  It was great.  We served basil and sun dried tomato wheat thins with it.  I liked that it was like having something a little heartier than just plain dip.  I hadn't eaten dinner before the party we took this to, so I was glad I had brought this!  Everyone loved it and asked who brought it.
