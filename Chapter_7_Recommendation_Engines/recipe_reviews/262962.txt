We prefer not to eat white potatoes, so I made this with all sweet potatoes. It was fantastic!  This gnocchi was better than any we have had in any restaurant. I think it's that the sweet potatoes add such a  distinct, and slightly sweet flavor. The sage  butter sauce is perfect also. 
I made enough that I put half in the freezer for later.  I served that second act with a butter, sun dried tomato, garlic  sauce  - also added some frozen peas. It was  super!  
Today I'm making some more of this gnocchi again. Thank you for this delicious recipe!

I used Gluten Free flour and I had the sauce made early and the sage soaking in it so there was more flavor to the sage butter sauce

This was the first time making gnocchi for me.  I think I used too much flour and the result was that the gnocchi turned out too firm--almost rubbery.  Also, next time I will probably use two sweet potatoes instead of using the russet potato.
