Happy to be the first to review this one. Fantastic!!!!  I had a beautiful thick filet and grilled it. The flavor of the fish was not overpowered by the marinade.  Super yummy...picking bass up again tomorrow while it's still available!

It's winter and I did not want to grill so I made the lemon juice mixture omitting the bay leaf, placed fish on piece of foil.  Drizzled the marinade over the fish then basted the top with lemon verbena pesto and gathered the foil loosely.  Baked at 425-450 for 15 minutes. Delicious!

Definitely a keeper...easy and quick, this is the perfect compliment to Sea Bass.  We added a little Old Bay Seasoning to perk it up a bit and that was an excellent addition.  Will use this again without hesitation!  Also a great way to lightly season fish for other uses like fish tacos, etc.

This is so simple to make! The flavors compliment the fish perfectly, they don't cover it up.
