Very good - I used fat free vanilla yogurt and skim milk (reduced that a bit to keep it thicker). I cut back on the sugar a bit as well and added some cinnamon along with the nutmeg.

Hubs and I were not enthusiastic about the nutmeg but that's just personal preference and not reason enough to dock the recipe a star - I just left it out. I used the blueberry yogurt I had in the fridge (never buy plain yogurt) and I think the extra blueberry flavor was a great contribution.  I used Splenda rather than sugar, but since I was already using a sweetened yogurt I reduced the amount by half and the level of sweetness was just right.  I used frozen blueberries which not only makes this refreshingly cold but they're also handy to have on hand to make this at any time.  Incredibly blue and incredibly blueberry, Hubs rated this "close to five stars," high praise from a guy who only allots five stars to the best of the best.

I did not add sweetener, and used soy milk instead of cow's milk.  Great recipe as is, but the addition of 2 peaches made it much more to my liking!

This blueberry smoothie was yummylious!! I also used vanilla yogurt and added a few more blueberries. It is sooo smooth and creamy! I ate some right away and froze the rest. Wow when I ate the frozen smoothie it was amazing! It will be my new "healthy" ice cream! I can't wait to try it with different fruit.

This was an amazing smoothie! It was nice and whipped with the addition of yogurt. I did modify the recipe a bit; I added half a banana and one teaspoon of cocoa powder to have a sweet and chocolaty taste. The smoothie turned out GREAT in the end!

This is a quick and easy way to get some healthy fruit in during the day. I do highly recommend using frozen berries though. I like smoothies that add a little extra flavor with cinnamon, nutmeg, or vanilla. It kind of takes away from the strong yogurt taste, esp. of plain yogurt. I put a little lite whipped cream on top and it was the perfect compliment. I did find though that a thinner brand of plain yogurt is a must for this recipe.

Yum! This is a delicious, fun, and lovely looking (great color) recipe. Perfect to for small, helping hands too. My 4 year old is well impressed with the smoothie he just made "all by himself".  We used non-fat yogurt and whole milk.

Delicious.  I made this with frozen blueberries, lemon Greek yogurt, and added a little less nutmeg than the recipe indicated.  It was perfect and wonderful for a hot summer morning.

Excellent! Used vanilla yogurt and omitted the extract.  Also used skim milk and it turned out great. My kids are usually skeptical about blueberry smoothies, but they loved this one.

I think it just depends on what you like in a smoothie.  I thought this was too thick and did not have a lot of flavor.  If I do this again, I will cut back on the yogurt, and add more milk or even ice.

I added an extra 1/2 cup of blueberries, using frozen ones we had picked last year, nonfat yogurt and milk, and I subbed honey for the sugar.  I liked the vanilla in this, and I usually love nutmeg but I'm not so sure I like it in a smoothie...maybe it was too early inthe morning or something!  Like other reviewers, I also recommend using frozen berries - makes this even more refreshing.

I want to start out by saying nutmeg is my most favorite spice. Period. This is the first time I haven't liked nutmeg in something! It just doesn't GO in this recipe, and I only used a few dashes... Other than this problem, it's a great recipe. I added a ripe banana, and used frozen blueberries.

Great way for me to use frozen blueberries from last summer's blueberry offerings and the last couple containers I had of yogurt I had. I used two containers of lite vanilla yogurt and I did not add the extra sugar as the yogurt was sweet enough. If I had, I think it would have been too sweet.

It was good, but really tasted more like blueberry yogurt made runny enough to drink.  I used frozen blueberries I had picked.  I think if I make it again, I'll not add the sugar as it would have been sweet enough without.

This was pretty good. It could use a little more tweaking (IMO). I used an overflowing cup of blueberries, vanilla yogurt, soymilk, and cane sugar -- leaving out the vanilla and nutmeg. I also added some maca powder. It turned out pretty well, but next time I might put in a little less yogurt and sub some ice cubes.

Great recipe! I cut down the milk to 1/2 c (per 2 servings) because I like my smoothies a little thick. I also used blueberry flavored yogurt and cut down the amount of sweetener I used. Thanks for sharing!

I really liked this.  I added about 1/2 cup of ice and used vanilla yogurt.  I don't care for nutmeg so just left it out.  I also used Splenda instead of sugar.  Nice morning smoothie.

I just made this and it is definitely unique! I have a sweet tooth and this made it happy. Instead of nutmeg I used cinnamon, but I think it was too strong and I would recommend adding some more blueberries and cutting the sugar in half to compensate. I also used plain soy milk and plain Greek yogurt just because those are my preferences! One weird thing that happened was as soon as I poured it out of the blender and it settled in the cup, it took back the consistency of yogurt and I'm now "drinking" it with a spoon! Not a big deal because I like thicker smoothies, just odd. Overall very good and very different if you like to mix things up for your taste buds.

Haven't made smoothies in a long time and thought I'd give this recipe a try. I didn't have any plain yogurt but used Greek vanilla yogurt instead because of swap of plain to vanilla I probably should of taken out the vanilla extract.

This was an excellent smoothie. I substituted vanilla yogurt so I eliminated the vanilla extract and also left out the nutmeg. I will definitely make this again.

Okay - I made this exactly to recipe, except I used vanilla yogurt. I didn't like the nutmeg at all and felt it was overpowering, so I added more milk and blueberries and it turned out alright. I also feel the additional sugar wasn't necessary. I think next time I'll try I different recipe.

I give this 4 stars, because I do not like smoothies and especially blueberries.  So this deserves it in my book, even my picky kids loved it.  I reduced the amount of berries and vanilla yogurt and I increased the milk a little and I also added a small amount of ginger.  Yummy!

really good, omited the nutmeg. Used skim milk and non-fat yogurt and 2 tbsp honey vs sugar. My 2 year old loved it and we used up the rest of the blueberries. Will make again for sure.

I did not add the nutmeg.  I double the rec. and used 1/2 of a cont. of the 32oz. yog. although I used about 3/4 c. skim milk so it didn't get too thin since the rec. called for 2% milk.

So, I added half a cup of frozen pineapple, used a hair less yogurt, and instead of nutmeg, I added honey, and it turned out to be the BEST smoothie I've had. The only reason why I'm giving it only 4 stars is because without the changes I made, it was just alright.

This is a wonderful beverage. In place of sugar I used Sweet & Low. I filled up my glass and poured another class if it and put it in the freezer. Before going to bed I took the frozen cup of  smoothie  In the refrigerator. What a delightful morning breakfast. It was so good!!
The smoothie is very simple to make as well.

Everyone loved it! I substituted a bit of the plain yogurt with strawberry yogurt  so I wouldn't have to add vanilla extract. To add an extra hint of deliciousness, I would add a few mint leaves.

Loved it.  I needed a way to incorporate frozen blueberry (since blueberries are so good for blood vessel health I just read) into our diet and could only think of blueberry pie, good but not so healthy.  This was perfect.

Skipped the nutmeg because I'm not a fan.  Otherwise good.  I'll likely double the sugar next time and add about a half cup more berries or other fruit.

Did come out like a smoothie, but could have a bit more flavor hence why I'll try more sugar and fruit next time.

Still pretty good.  Made two large glasses worth.

Five year old approved - my little guy is working to gain some weight, so I used whole milk, whole yogurt, a scoop of vanilla ice cream as the "sugar", added half of a banana, and ground chia seeds.
Next time I will also add some flax seed oil, licorice powder, holy basil powder, pure bone broth collagen powder, cocoa powder, and dandelion root powder (very small increments of each. I feel the flavor will easily mask the added goodies)

My kids loved this! We had strawberries out of our garden so I added them to the blueberries. My five year kept telling "smoothies!" whenever she took a drink and my two year old refused to share with me. I will definitely make it again.

Tastes great, but if you're using fresh blueberries, I definitely recommend adding ice because even using cold ingredients it was warm. 

I'm not a nutmeg fan, so I was dubious, but since I used vanilla yogurt (because it's what I had on hand) I think it balanced pretty well.

I  am always on the look out for a good smoothie. I made a couple of changes as i am lactose intolerant.
I used almond milk and lactose free Activia yogurt, and cut back on the sugar a bit.I also added some protein powder to the smoothie. It was delicious.
Thank you for the recipe.

I scaled this down to one serving and used frozen blueberries and honey in place of the sugar. I also added a scoop of vanillla protein powder, which I always do with smoothies. Nutmeg doesn't appeal to me in something like this, so I just gave it a shake of cinnamon. Very good!

The only substitution I did was to use  Splenda instead of sugar. I did not care for it because it was not cold and I did not want to water it down by adding ice.

5 stars for all 3 of my kids (ages 9, 6 & 1) LOVING this smoothie! I wasn't sure about the nutmeg (and personally think I would prefer it without the spice) but they raved about the nutmeg with the blueberry & my 1 year old couldn't get enough! I doubled the recipe, used whole milk & slightly less sugar (3T per double). I will definitely make this again. Oh & I would recommend frozen berries...smoothies always taste better when they are really cold, imo!

Triple delish! I used frozen blueberries, Greek yogurt and almond milk.  Added a frozen banana, a scoop of vanilla protein powder,  some ice (loves me  a really thick smoothie), and subbed Truvia for the sugar as I am diabetic. You bet I'll be making this one again!

Didn't like it as written, too sweet and not enough pop.  Added strawberries and ice and brought it back to life.  Good in the end but not as written.

My new go to.  Super easy and not too many ingredients   the berries easily swith out with other fruit...so far I've used peaches, raspberries, and a blueberry banana combo.   Easy to play with for additional flavors.  Throw in some spinach, cinnamon....just about anything.

Went with a couple changes. Subbed in skim milk, greek yogurt (lime), brown sugar, a dash of cinnamon,  and double the blueberries (frozen). In the end, it tasted lovely, albeit a bit heavy on the yogurt. Before adding more blueberries, the smoothie was far less thick than I would've liked. Freezed the remainder, and hoping to enjoy that later!

I used Vanilla Bean Greek yogurt instead of plain and loved it. My one word of advice is to not use whole milk. I ran out of low fat after my first time making this, and the whole milk is MUCH more prominent. I had to double the other ingredients to get rid of the overwhelmingly milk taste. Very good recipe though!!

With al the smoothies that I've made on this site, I hadn't tried this one...big mistake!  Used fresh blueberries, so I added some crushed ice, used vanilla almond milk, skipped the sugar (blueberries were plenty sweet) and Greek yogurt for extra protein.  That little bit of freshly-ground nutmeg is subtle but adds another layer of flavor you typically don't find in a blueberry smoothie.  Very nice!

Good healthy drink - milk and yogurt gives calcium; blueberries give anti-oxidents.  Tastes good and easy to make.

Serve as cold as possible.

This is a really good recipe. The problem I had with it was when I did three servings, I only had enough of  about  2 cup and a half. So really only two of the people I was cooking for got a real amount. I also made the mistake of putting in Greek yogurt instead of regular yogurt. Note to everyone do not use Greek yogurt because it makes the flavor  a little sour. But with regular yogurt it is very very good!

I used low fat French vanilla yogurt, added a handful of ice cubes and skipped the extract and nutmeg. My son said he'd pick this over his favorite blueberry milkshake any day.

I am not a big fan of blueberries, but i know they are great for you. I did not add any sugar, and I used vanilla yogurt. This blend was wonderful and took away the bit of tartness. Love the nutmeg in it!  Thanks for sharing!

I wasn't wild about the yogurt in this, but adding some spice was a good idea. However, cinnamon was the spice of choice for us.

I gave this recipe a okay veiw because I was looking for a blueberry smoothie,and I didn't want to taste any oh the yogurt. This recipe is good. But I really didn't want to taste the grose yogurt. I think i'll try it with frozen yogurt to see how it tastes.

I just so happened to have blueberrys and a huge tub of vanilla yogurt. I am on a low fat no  diet. So I needed a change of my fruit routine. The nutmeg is to give it flavor, but with the vanilla yogurt and yes I threw in the vanilla extract as well. It gives it that sweeter taste you need. Not overly the sweet, I do not like sweets and candy either. So this hits the spot. Not bland at all. My blueberries were frozen, so it gave a ice cold blend. Now I like my smoothies a little more thicker, but this blended well. I guess add ice if you want it thicker, or to mild out the vanilla sweetness if you use vanilla yogurt. I'll try that next time.

Great smoothie!  I was looking for a smoothie recipe that didn't call for bananas or orange juice so this was a nice change.  I only had vanilla yogurt on hand so I used that and I also used honey in place of the sugar.  Nutmeg seemed like an odd ingredient, so I swapped it out with cinnamon instead, which pairs really well with blueberries.  Since lemon juice also goes well with blueberries, I added in a splash of that as well.  Delicious!

I made it except I used cinnamon instead of the nutmeg, used vanilla yogurt & left the vanilla extract out, used splenda instead of white sugar, 1 cup 2% milk, and added 1/2 C. ice. I made my own variations; it turned out delicious!

This is excellent with either blueberries or raspberries.  When I have one of these in the morning, I stay pretty full until lunch so I'm not snacking mid-morning.  Thanks for submitting this!

my kids loved it. I added 1 cup of ice to make it thicker and used vanilla spy milk instead of milk.

Did not blow us away with flavor.  I think I could have used vanilla yogurt instead of plain to "doll" it up a little.

Delicious smoothie!  Made as is, this recipe is really great.  Depending on how sweet the berries are, I think you could leave out the sugar.
