Loved this recipe. Awesome comfort food. The only thing I did different was to add more garlic since we are garlic lovers.

We have always added meat ( cooked cubed chicken, crisp bacon, or cubed ham ).  But this recipe as it stands is great. Unfortunately, there is never any leftovers. Dang!

This recipe has been in my family for years. It always disappears! My grandmother always served it with roast beef, fresh green beans or home canned green beans and homemade rolls. Comfort food at it's best.

I've tried several Cheese Grit recipes since I've lost the one that my brother-in-law's grandma used and we all loved . . . .  this is the closest I've found and I've made this several times.  Since it is just me, I cut the recipe in 1/2 and sometimes it will last a couple of days for breakfast.  And sometimes I've eaten it for breakfast, lunch and dinner!  Thanks for the Elaine!

Best grit casserole I have ever eaten. Made it with chicken broth instead of water.

I love it, but I added a lil change to mines. I added fried bacon & the grease from it. I poured the grease into the water & milk. Along with some slap your mama season salt, pepper, & garlic. I cut the bacon up in small pieces and added it before the eggs. It was GREAT!!! I will be making this again ??????

I added leftover crumbled bacon to the recipe but you could barely tell so next time I'm going to add some maple breakfast sausage!

I would give this a 10 star rating if able. I followed the recipe exactly, except I used 8 oz. of shredded sharp cheese, not cubed, because that is what I had on hand. Everyone I served it to, raved about it. Will make this dish a holiday tradition. Thank you for sharing your recipe.

I made this dish per the recipe except for scaling it in half. Delicious! Made a great accompaniment to breakfast for dinner tonight, but would be a good side dish with chicken or beef as well.

I love polenta or grits but the cheese didn't work well with the recipe. I will try it without cheese and that should be good.

This is sooooo good! After a recent trip to the south and experiencing cheese grits for the first time, I had to make them. This recipe is perfect. I didnâ€™t change anything.  Yummy yummy yummy!

Besides scaling the recipe for 5 servings, I followed the recipe exactly. It was very rich and cheesy. It was not bland, as some have said, and I liked it a lot.

First off, it's easy.  But it's a bit bland.  I added a can of diced green chilis. And if you remember the video, they put hot sauce on the dish.  It definitely needs some heat.  I think I might use hot pork sausage.  Not awful, but not fantastic, either.

Excellent recipe!  I have made this dish several times and it is always a BIG hit.  I have added 2 small cans of green chiles a couple of times when making this recipe and that too was a BIG hit!

Just made this for the first time. I cut the recipe in half, but kept the same ratio as original. Next time I will reduce the liquid slightly, as the grits did not get as firm when cooked, and I would have preferred the final product to be firmer.  Even so it was very tasty, and will be made again.

Really nice flavour and easy to make. I only gave it four stars because it was missing a little flavour I added extra garlic and pepper that did the trick for me I would reduce the process cheese by a little next to ice as well.

Kind of bland, I love cheese however, there seems to be more cheese than grits. Not my favorite, but didn't hate it
