I tried this, then the next time I used a couple of tablespoons of Nesquick instead of the cocoa and vanilla. As good or better tasting and simplified ingredients. Feel free to add back the vanilla and even a dash of nutmeg. I also experimented with a dash of Chinese 5 Spice. That was an exotic taste. ;)

I made no changes.  It was the most disgusting recipe I've tried here on Allrecipes.  If you dare to try it, add maybe 1 TBL of the cocoa .  It was very bitter.  In an attempt to make it edible I added some butter and twice the brown sugar.  Nope, still ended up in the disposal.
