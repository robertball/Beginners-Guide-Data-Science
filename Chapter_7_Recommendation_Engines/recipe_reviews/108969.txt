I live in Hawaii and have been trying for a year to find the right recipe for this stuff.  Found it!!!  You can buy coconut syrup in the yellow bottles here for a small fortune (plus they have preservatives).  Once you have coconut syrup in a local Hawaiian pancake house it is addicting.  I've experimented on my own and tried some other recipes.  This one is right on.  I think you can cut the corn starch a little bit.  I also added a 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla at the end.  Try chopping up some fresh pineapple bits and adding them to the top (gooey) side of pancakes while they're cooking.  When you flip them the pineapple bits grill a little bit-yum!  Then top it with this syrup and you have Hawaiian heaven.  Much mahalo for the recipe.

I live in Hawaii and use coconut syrup on my pancakes all the time.  This recipe is very good.  I used half of the corn starch and the consistency was just right.  For those who want to taste the coconut more, add some coconut extract like I did and the coconut flavor will burst through.

This is a good, fresh tasting syrup, but delicate. I only used 1 Tbsp cornstarch, and that thickened it fine.

I've never had or made coconut syrup before so I didn't know what to expect, I made it just as the recipe is written and it was fantastic. We used about 1 ladle full and then I stored it in an empty syrup bottle which it filled. Next time I would try it with a bit less surgar, just seemed a bit overly sweet to me, but hey no one complained! It's a winner.

I kept the 2 TBSP of corn starch and added 1/2 cup of COCA REAL cream of coconut, I also skipped the shredded coconut and added 1 TSP coconut extract!  It was awesome!  Next I halved the recipe- bottling one ahalf and then I added 1 cup of V8 Splash Smoothies Tropical Coloda and an additional TBSP of corn starch to the other half.  This was also a great topping for ice cream.  It added additional coconut flavoring and a tang of pineapple!  YUM :)

Delicious!  Makes a TON though, I'd recommend halving or even quartering the recipe.

I have been searching for a recipe to match the coconut syrup at my favorite restaurant in Kauai where they make tropical pancakes and this is it. Adding some vanilla gives it a more robust flavor.  I serve this over pancakes that have shredded coconut and macadamia nuts added to the batter.  Then put sliced bananas over the pancakes, pour syrup on top, and top with whipped cream.   

I double the recipe because they are all gone in a flash.

Tasty syrup!  Similar to what I've had in Hawaii, but I think I will reduce the cornstarch next time.  I made half a batch and it filled a pint jar.

Its still not as good as the syrup in Hawaii. My husband and I were very disappointed. I'll try it again though using fresh coconut because we think the sugared coconut is what ruins this recipe.

Ok, so I kind of screwed this up and it didn't thicken as much as I'd like, I tried using flour instead of cornstarch, my bad...but seriously, this is soooo delicious, even if a tad thin (my fault). I somehow had actual coconuts on hand, so if you are into some labor intensive coconut draining/ filtering/ scraping/ shredding/ dehydrating, I highly recommend it. We ate it on pancakes and on top of vanilla ice cream. I think using the fresh ingrediants really made the flavor. Will definatly make this again, with cornstarch next time.

This was easy to make, and it's a decent syrup, but I won't be making it again once we're out.  I don't care for the coconut shreds (I guess I just prefer a smoother consistency for syrup).  My other complaint is that it has a surprisingly mellow coconut flavor.  I was looking for BAM!  COCONUT!  and what I got was more like, "Huh, what's the white stuff- is that coconut?"  The flavor is very subtle.  It's a fine syrup, it just didn't knock my socks off like I was hoping for.

Wow!!! This is the first time I have ever reviewed a recipe, but had to because this was outstanding!  I followed the recipe exactly and it was just right.  We've been to the islands twice, and this syrup was like bit of the islands in our own home.  My husband and three boys love this!

I did not like this.  I couldn't taste the coconut one bit, even the flaked coconut.  Maybe it needs some coconut extract.

Or you can just add coconut milk/cream to your favorite syrup! Works just fine just comes out a little darker.

LOVE THIS!  We are getting ready for a trip to Hawaii and I wanted to put us in the mood.  We've had coconut syrup on the islands before, and this is REALLY close...the only change I made was due to the fact that the store was out of coconut milk.  I used something called "COCO Real" cream of coconut.  I thought it made the syrup SUPER coconutty!  Great recipe, and thanks!  Gonna try a sugar free version next...I'll let you know how it works out!

We only have carry-ons when we go to Hawaii so could not bring any syrup home!  I was soooo glad to find your recipe, and I love it. Only change I made was to use my hand held smoothie maker to blend in the shredded coconut. I love the taste but not the texture of the shredded coconut! Now it is perfect. Thanks

Yum! I made only 1/2 the recipe since most of my family won't even try this. It turned out a little thin. I'm still hoping it will thicken up. I was too anxious to try it to wait for it to cool so just ate it warm. Delicious! Wish my sister lived close; she would love it! I keep making this because I love it so much but I have a complaint...even refrigerated, it doesn't last very long before getting moldy.

Since German Pancakes or Dutch Babies taste incredible with coconut syrup, I was thrilled to find this recipe. I did tweak it a bit by using a touch of agave (I use organic corn syrup and one bottle was not enough) I also tried coconut sugar this time and WOW! So good!!! I left the coconut out, because I wanted a smooth syrup. This was perfect!

Yum! Like everyone else, I had banana pancakes and coconut syrup while on vacation in Hawaii and loved it! This recipe is delicious! Exactly what I was looking for. It's great as is, but I think next time I will try adding some coconut extract for extra coconut flavor.

I waited anxiously for the weekend to make pancakes, along
with the syrup for my family. The recipe is scrumpcious. I didn't have any corn syrup on
hand so I made some my self, 2 cups of sugar, 3/4 cups water, 1/4 tea cream of tartar and pinch of salt.
bring to a boil, (soft ball stage)let cool. Adjustments I made to the recipe: I used 1 tab of the corn starch as other reviewer suggested
but to be honest next time I'll use the 2 tab, because I like my syrup a little thicker and not so runny. I will also decrease the sugar,to about 1/4 cup. The sweetened coconut gives it that extra sweetness. I also added 1 tea of coconut extract. IT DEFENITLY MADE
A DIFFRENCE. But all in all I loved the recipe. Thanks for sharing.

YUM!  My husband is a coconut nut!  I made this as written and it was very good.  The next batch I made I used light brown sugar and used my small food processor to grind the coconut shreds.  I also boiled for 3 minutes and added a pinch of salt and a half tsp.  of coconut extract.  It was delicious!  I Served on Dutch Babies ll recipe.  Raves all around!

This is wonderful!  My mother-in-law always brings back coconut syrup from her trips to Hawaii but those are few and far between.  This tastes as good or better :)  I made it exactly as posted and will make it again and again.

Pretty tasty! This was the first time I tried cocnut syrup. I had it for the first time so I did not know what to expect. I used frozen shredded coconut instead of sweetened ones and the syrup was still plenty sweet. I also addded a very small pinch of salt. Somehow I felt it needed it. Thanks for a great recipe.

Oh my gosh, this is delicious as syrup, ice cream topping or just by the spoonful.  I had to use 1/2 light syrup and 1/2 dark syrup (all I had), but it was fantastic!

This is very good - as long as you understand that the coconut flavor is quite subtle.  Personally, I enjoyed it - but I *do* wish I had some coconut extract (as others have mentioned) to give it that last little ummph of flavor.  It's quick and easy ... I think I'm going to make a poke cake try drizzling this on the cake.  I only had sweetened coconut, so I simply scaled back on the sugar.  Thanks so much for recipe!

I eliminated the corn syrup & sugar and used coconut sugar instead and a little more corn starch to make thicker.Just a little more healthier.

We had some bottled coconut syrup in Hawaii at a bed and breakfast that we thought our children would love.  Unfortunately we could never find a bottle of it to buy and bring home.  So when I got home I tried this recipe and it tasted fresher and even better than what we had in Hawaii!  I did makes some changes, though.  I left out the flaked coconut because my husband doesn't like it, and I only added about a cup of corn syrup because I didn't want it to be too sweet.  As other reviewers recommended, I added some coconut extract.  Next time I will add about half the suggested amount of cornstarch.  Since I didn't add as much corn syrup my coconut syrup was a little thick...but still yummy!

This was delicious on pancakes with strawberries and blueberries. Any leftovers can be mixed with plain rice to create a tasty sticky rice!

I didn't have coconut milk--just the coconut canned mix for drinks, but I looked up a conversion online and all you have to do is add water! So you need half of the canned coconut mix that you would need for the coconut milk in the recipe.

Based on a lot of the comments I read, I made the recipe as follows:

1/2 can condensed coconut milk
1/4 tsp coconut flavoring
1/2 tsp vanilla
1/8 tsp sea salt 
1/2 cup corn syrup
1/4 cup white sugar 
1 tsp corn starch. 

It was outstanding !! I did not use shredded coconut in the syrup. Though a lot people cut the corn starch in the original recipe used a full teaspoon and had the right consistency but might even try another 1/2 tsp next time.

I’ve been promising to make this for my husband and finally did. Turned out great.  I was short about 1/2 cup corn syrup but it still turned out well. Added 1/4 tsp vanilla, cut the cornstarch in half like some suggested and blended the coconut in to make it smoother. I also used unsweetened coconut. I’m not a big fan of different syrups but I like it too and my youngest son loves it.

It was very good but I made some changes,  instead of corn starch I used arrow root, instead of corn syrup I used agave, and white sugar I used sugar cane and they were all organic.

I made it just as printed except I left out the coconut.  I added toasted coconut to the top of the pancakes instead.  It makes so much that I had to give some of it away!  It was delicious!

I loved it! My husband made waffles while I did the syrup. My kids thought we went out to eat.....  I did add a little rum and almond extract. So yummy!  Will definitely make again.

We got back from Hawaii 2 weeks ago and fell in love with the coconut syrup while we were there. So much so that I ordered a bottle from amazon the next day. It was AWEFUL. To say the least we were very disappointed, and 18 bucks down the tubes as well. I found this recipe and made a batch at a fraction of the cost of the amazon . It was delicious! Very much like what we had on Maui. BRAVO!

I added 2 tsps of coconut extract.  I took the recommendations and only used 1 tblsp of corn starch and after it cooled it did thicken to an okay level.  Pretty good, it's not as good as the bottled in Hawaii, but it's pretty close.

I substituted honey instead of corn syrup.  I also found finely shredded frozen unprocessed coconut at Latin Grocer, which I felt was much better then typical shredded sweetened coconut you get anywhere. It was really good. Not as sweet as expected.  Great on King's Hawaiian French Toast!

The only can of coconut milk in my cupboard was lite, and the syrup tasted more like corn syrup than coconut. I added about 1 1/2 tsp. coconut extract but still didn't love it. Maybe the recipe does not work with lite coconut milk.

I've been to Hawaii and coconut syrup was my favorite. Couldn't find it where I am. I figured I'd try this because of the reviews. It is awesome! Tastes just like the original syrup. Thank you!

Yuk. I made this stuff and it's very syrupy, but not very coconutty. I think I figured out the problem: the corn syrup requirement is off by a factor of about 100. Indeed, I checked other recipes, and they called for one or two TABLESPOONS of corn syrup, not a whole friggin' bottle (2 CUPS). It didn't look right, either -- mostly clear, when it should look like thick coconut milk. I tasted it and then dumped the whole mess down the drain. Awful.

Many years ago when my parents went to Hawaii for their anniversary they brought back coconut syrup.  Ever since I have looked everywhere to purchase and no luck.  I found this recipe and now my husband and grand children don't want any other syrup with their pancakes or waffles.  It is very delicious.  For a snack I like to eat cottage cheese with a little coconut syrup and it is fantastic.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

After a honeymoon in Maui, I had to try making this with banana pancakes for brunch. Awesome! Here is my changes... I was short enough corn syrup, so I substituted 1/2 agave nectar to get the full 2 cups. Also didn't have shredded coconut, so substituted 1/2 crushed pineapple. Other reviewers are right: this makes about 4c of syrup!  Halve it or get ready to store some. Also - it stays hot a long time, so be careful. MAHALO

Next time I make this I will cut out the sugar and one cup of the Karo syrup  and add 1 cup more coconut milk and extra cornstarch. It was just too sweet. Adding a bit more coconut would be nice or vanilla.

I made this to go with pineapple waffles and was really impressed with the results. I thought the consistency was perfect. I followed the recipe as written except I left out the flaked coconut because I am not a fan. I will definitely make this recipe many, many more times!

OMG that is DELICIOUS!!!  We had it with pancakes that had fresh pineapple and added a side of fried Canadian Bacon (or Ham).  Soooooo Good!  Thanks for the new breakfast item.
