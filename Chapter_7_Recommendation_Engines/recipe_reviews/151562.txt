PROS: It is a great meal to make if you need to feed someone in a major hurry. Very simple and quick and the pasta will fill an empty stomach.

CONS:  Absolutely flavorless and boring. Don't expect rave reviews from your family unless maybe they're toddlers.


FIXES: I followed this same recipe adding Campbells Cream of Chicken soup instead of the Cream of Mushroom. By far more flavor and it smells great in the oven. I added a cup of frozen sweetpeas and a cup of frozen carrots to the mix for color and I would suggest even frozen green beans as well. You could use frozen broccoli florets too. All of this ads taste, color and nutrition. I added a little johnnys seasoning salt for taste which also gives a great golden color to many recipes. Johnnys is the best! some buttered bread crumbs on the top of the casserole baked to a golden brown during the last 10 min. of the cooking time and the recipe is now a HIT!

I enjoyed this meal! I did make a few additions: sauteed chopped onions in garlic. When onions were soft, added frozen peas, mushrooms and chicken chunks and sauteed in mixture of thyme,  parsley, red crushed peppers, salt & pepper. Then I added cream of chicken (low salt) with 1/2 can milk & 1/2 can water. Let boil on low heat. I then added grated parmesan cheese (enough to thicken sauce as your liking). Meanwhile, cooked pasta separately and added to mixture after pasta was al dente. Continued to cook on low heat for additional 10 minutes. Yum!

I don't know what I did to this recipe, but it was the best chicken and noodles I've ever had! I used Valley fresh white chicken in the pouch and Amish extra thick noodles. I added one stalk of sliced celery and one carrot shredded with my Thai shredder. Also about a quarter of a cup of frozen chopped onion into the mix as well as a goodly dusting of poultry seasoning probably about 1/8th of a teaspoon up to a 1/4 I'd guess. other then that I think I followed the recipe. I also may have cut down the milk and just used enough to make the soup creamy and mix well. used parmesean and the kraft four cheese Mexican on top cause that's what I had. Man was this good! I shared my lunch at work and my friend who comes from Amish country said this was the best chicken and noodles she ever tasted. It's a keeper and sooooooo easy! It was about 40 minutes start to finish for me. YUM!

At first I was hesitant to make this dish. But then I added some of my own seasonings to the chicken and it came out really good I also topped it with mozzarella/cheddar mix and it came out really good. I would highly reccomend this it is one of my boyfriend's favorited dishes.

I was so disappointed by this dish.  The picture looked so good, and the ingredients seemed like they would make something good...  but it was terrible.  So very bland, no flavor at all....  I think that it could be improved with some kind of spices, but the recipe as is was terrible.  I also think it needs to cook longer, as the veggies were still crunchy.  I may try this another time with some spices, and I also would add some bread crumbs on top to give it some crispiness.  If anyone experiments with some spices and it turns out well, please write a review with what you added so I can try it out.  Thanks!

Very quick and easy to make and I threw in some peas for some veggies. Don't expect it to taste gourmet or anything. It is what it is.

Talk about a recipe gone wild!  This is the first recipe I ever altered on here.  I read all the other reviews and here is what I did:  added poultry seasoning, parsley, chopped onion, garlic powder, onion powder, butter, frozen green beans and frozen corn.  By the time all the other extras were added, I added another can of cr. of chicken soup and chicken.  Needless to say the family ate it up!  Now I know what a "good base recipe" means.  Keep playing with this recipe, it definitely has potential!

I used this recipe as an idea.  First I used one can Campbells reduced salt cream of chicken and 3/4 can of regular cream of chicken soup.  I sauteed onions, carrots and celery until soft. added the soup and some milk, salt, pepper, and garlic powder and let it cook over low heat.  I was VERY short on time this day and didn't have any chicken thawed so I used a can of Swanson's chicken.  I used 1 pound of elbow pasta.  Once the pasta was cooked and the mixture simmered for a few minutes, I combined them all, plus some fresh parmasan cheese and put it in a baking dish and baked until heated through.

I'm new to this whole cooking thing, and I loved this recipe!!  It is very simple to make, and easy to adjust to your own tastes.  I added garlic powder and Morton's Nature's Best seasoning.  I also cooked the chicken in a skilled rubbed with Nature's Best seasoning, before cubing and adding it to the casserole.  My new husband loved it and ate so much he could barely move!

It was ok. I add some garlic, cheddar cheese, and frozen peas to make it taste better. My family was not crazy about it but ate it for something different. Basically I believe this is recipe needs a little something to add to the taste.

I have had this recipe a different way, and liked it much better.  You need to add veggies, that's one part its missing.  I also suggest adding about 2 tablespoons of melted butter to make it creamier.  Finally, I would suggest using more pepper and to also put some thyme on it, goes lovely with the chicken.  I also have used cream of chicken and broccoli in this dish.

This was a very bland recipe.  It had no taste to it. I did not like this recipe at all, and it was quite expensive to make for the way that it turned out

This is easy and fast, I cooked the chicken with onions and garlic to give the chicken a little kick. I also added corn and greenbeans to the sauce. Totally delicious!

Very good and easy recipe.  I made it gluten free by substituting Progresso's GF Creamy Mushroom soup and GF spiral noodles.  I buy Heartland brand GF pasta at Walmart.  I added some frozen chopped spinach but the recipe does not call for it.  My husband, who normally does not care for my GF creations, said it was fantastic!

I made this dish last night for supper. It was wonderful however I would not use 1/3 cup of Parmesan cheese. I thought it was too much and made the dish sort of sweet. Quick and easy will make again (with less cheese of course!)

I'd have to agree with the few negative reviews that I read about this casserole.  The meal turned out very bland.  I don't like a lot of spicy food, but this was at the opposite side of the scale, no spice and little flavor.  It really needs something to perk up.  Right now it taste predominantly like soup with noodles.

I did not care for this recipe. I would not recommend making this! My husband and I hated it. Somehow the cream of mushroom and the cream of chicken made the meal taste fishy. We found the texture unpleasant as well. Do yourself & family a favor...pick some thing else.

My kids love this one.  Even my niece who refuses to eat pretty much anything will devour an entire bowl of it.  It is easy and doesn't take a whole lot of stuff to make it either.

Very quick and easy recipe. I loved it. The kids thought it was a little to creamy so I ended up adding a full cup of milk instead of only 1/3 cup.

Had egg noodles,chicken,1 big fresh mushroom, a can of mushrooms, milk, 3 tBl of sour cream,feta, dried garlic (okay I was lazy) ran next door to get mushroom soup and fresh parsley.  I found the recipe, threw this altogether, crumbled crackers on top and baked.  Lovely meal.  One less restaurant meal and I'd make it again tomorrow but I'll have left overs which I will gobble up at work!! YUM!!
