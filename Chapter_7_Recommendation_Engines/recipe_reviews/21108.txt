Very tasty. I have made this bread several times now and it always turns out well. It is a good recipe for add-ins. For example. try throwing in a handful of shredded American cheese for a cheesy bread. Also, when you make this bread, do be sure to measure in the oil before adding the honey. This way, you have an oiled spoon to measure the honey with, and the honey just slides out nicely instead of sticking to the spoon.

Nice wheat taste, not too sweet.  I didn't feel like grinding up the oatmeal, and it turned out fine.  However, the batter was too runny to just slap on a baking sheet, so I put it in a pan.  If you do so, beware: grease the pan very well, as this bread likes to stick!  This was EXTREMELY fast; from start to finish it took no more than 25-30 minutes.  The finished product is very small; if you want a real-sized loaf I suggest doubling the recipe.

This was a great recipe. My first non-sweet bread recipe I've made from scratch. Very tasty and delicious.

I did as others recommended, and doubled the recipe to create a full-size loaf. I baked it at 350 for 1 hour in a loaf pan, and that was perfect.

Substitutes I did: Skim milk instead of whole. Extra virgin olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and I added 1/2 cup of ground flax seeds. Both the olive oil and ground flax added healthy fats to the bread, and the flax also added a little extra fiber and protein.

I also didn't grind the oats, either. I like having big pieces of grain in my breads.

Thanks for sharing your recipe! It's so nice baking bread at home so you can control what goes into it.

I originally chose this recipe because it was full of healthy stuff, but I will continue making it because it is absolutely delicious!  I made the following substitutions to make it a little healthier:  2 tbsp sugar-free maple syrup for the 1.2 tbsp honey and 1 tbsp natural applesauce for the 1 tbsp vegetable oil.  I also made these additions for flavor:  3/4 cup raisins, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and 1/2 tsp imitation vanilla.  Also, I did not grind the oatmeal and found that I would prefer it this way.  I used 1/2 cup skim milk + 1/2 cup 2% milk and would recommend this as well.  I love to eat this for breakfast in the morning spread with a little butter.

I didn't like how the first loaf came out so small, so I modified a few things and baked it again a few hours later so that I could get the desired result.  Consequently, I doubled the recipe, put the batter into a greased loaf pan, and baked it for 1 hour at 350 F.  Both loaves were dense (like the recipe said that they'd be) and yummy (esp. with butter/jam/whatever on a slice)!

I soured my milk with two tablespoons of lemon juice. Instead of baking this on a oiled baking sheet, I baked this in a greased loaf pan. Right before baking, I drizzled a couple tablespoons of melted butter over the dough in the pan. GREAT breakfast bread. I made a strawberry cream cheese spread to schmear over it--the family flipped for it. I bet this would make an EXCELLENT beer bread using beer in place of the milk.

Five stars for simplicity, healthfulness, taste, texture, and versatility. This bread turned out better than I thought it would. I doubled the ingredients and poured the batter/dough into a loaf pan. I baked it at a slighly lower temperature for a bit longer, and it turned out beautifully. I did cover the loaf with foil about halfway through the baking time. I only substituted one ingredient: I used vanilla soy milk instead of cow's milk - I realized as I combined the dry ingredients that I was out! The vanilla flavor did wonders for the bread. It's a tinge sweeter, I think, than if I had used regular milk. It made my home smell wonderful, too, as it baked. I will definitely make this bread again, probably substituting something else (applesauce or yogurt) for the oil and I may add other fruits, nuts, or seeds if something catches my fancy. All in all, a fabulously simple, tasty, and nutritious bread. Thank you SO much!

I bake bread nearly every week, and as we were just about out of bread and out of yeast (and the store didn't have any yeast in stock!), I was looking for a good whole-grain quick bread. This recipe looked like it fit the bill.

As others had suggested, I doubled the recipe, used a loaf pan, and baked it for an hour at 350F. I used maple syrup instead of honey and, lazy me, didn't grind the oats.

The taste is excellent, and the texture is definitely dense and hearty. This is not a bread one could use for sandwiches, so I'll have to bake something else in a day or two, but I'm glad to have this very quick and delicious recipe. I may try to process the oats a bit next time.

This is the first bread I've ever made - and it actually came out great! I didn't grind the oatmeal, subbed applesauce for oil, soy milk for milk, and 1 Tbsp of splenda for the honey because I didn't have honey. I added about 1/2 C of ground flaxseed, about 1/4 C of unprocessed bran, and some sesame seeds just because I like them. I also sprinkled some sesame seeds on top and sprayed the top of the dough with spray oil. It turned out dense and soft on the inside with a nice crust. When I made it a 2nd time with less additions, 1 C of milk was too much. I'm going to experiment with more add ins, like seeds or dried fruit. Love this bread!

Good country-style bread...if you have kids you may want to add a little extra honey. A great recipe for a pretty loaf of bread that doesn't require "rise" time. I recommend slicing an "X" in the top of loaf with a sharp knife before baking so finished product looks even prettier.

This is a great quick bread.  I was home on break from college and we didn't have any wheat bread in the house, so I pulled up this recipe.  It's so quick and easy, and we had all the ingredients already!  Not to mention it's really delicious, especially with orange maramelade :-)  I made the bread in two mini-loaf pans, in the oven for 20 minutes.

Very good, healthy and hearty bread. Its quick, fairly cheap to make and always pleases. Ive added fruits and nuts, even chocolate to the bread to mix it up. I however did add a 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda to the recipe, it makes the bread rise and puff up a bit more, makes it a bit less dense. Great bread for any meal and its prepped in just minutes!

Reducing the liquid by 1/6 helps the dough keep its form while baking. It was somewhat underdone in the middle, had to toast it.

This bread is so easy and delicious. I substituted unsweetened applesauce for the oil, and poured the dough into a loaf pan - it seemed way too "wet" to form a ball of dough. I was a little uncertain of how it would come out, but it came out perfect - I followed the time and temperature instructions. I also didn't grind the oatmeal - I like the texture it added and it was one less step. I served this with a little Smart Balance butter spread and homemade soup. This bread is so easy and healthy and I will definitely be making it again! Thanks for the great recipe.

This bread is just like WOW when you take into account how incredibly EASY it is to make. I think it took 5 minutes to put all of the ingredients together.

I only half ground up the oats using my  stick blender because I don't own a food processor or a blender. I also substituted applesauce for teh oil and used low fat buttermilk instead of regular milk. I also added 1/4c of ground flax seed.
This bread is not sweet and is great with a little honey or butter on it. This will probably become a staple recipe at my house.

I had to keep myself from polishing off the loaf before anyone else had a chance to try it. I didn't bother grinding the oatmeal-- the texture changes some, I'm sure, but I didn't mind. I added 1 tsp. of molassas, and I think that was a great addition. I cooked this in a loaf pan because it was easier to pour the dough into that instead of getting my hands all sticky trying to form a ball. I will DEFINITELY make this again.

This was quick, easy, and just what I was craving.  I added about a 1/2 cup of extra flour and an extra tbsp of honey and then baked it in a loaf pan.  It turned out just like store-bought bread, except I knew it was free of high fructose corn syrup and additives!  The only thing I will do differently next time is to double the recipe to have a full loaf.

This was good ... different and good and very easy to make. I did what was recommended most and that was to double the recipe and bake for an hour in a well greased loaf pan which I am glad I did. The dough is too loose to cook any other way and you need to double the recipe to make a loaf. I processed half the oats and left the other half whole but next time will use all whole. I also used 2% milk with no problem. My loaf baked in 50 minutes. This bread was wholesome with a quick bread consistency and an undertone of sweetness from the oatmeal, honey and wholewheat. I enjoyed it most when toasted with a pat of butter and jam.

Mmmmm... very tasty! I've made it twice in the span of 1 week now. The first time I made a double batch and put it all into one loaf. One word of advice for doubling it and making one big loaf: DON'T! Mine was raw in the middle. I toasted it and it was fine, but yeesh. The second time I tripled the batch and made 3 tbsp-scoop size drop biscuits. THOSE are excellent! The biscuits baked in about 30 minutes at 350 degrees F. (I didn't want to bake 'em at 450 for fear they'd become charcoal briquettes!) Delicious, slightly sweet, and satisfying either way! Thanks for the recipe (sung to the tune of "Thanks for the Memories :) Sorry, feeling silly!)

Pretty good.  Had with soup for dinner and it was OK.  Looking forward to a slice for breakfast with jam.  Seems like it needs a little more sweetness/flavor.  Couldn't be easier to make.

This is scrumptious. Definately will make again - dense and nutty and satisfying. Added 1/2 cup flaxseeds and 1/4 cup sunflower seeds. Don't bother grinding the oatmeal. 6-8 servings. Baked 20 min in a loaf pan lined with parchment paper - easy clean up. Will try other nuts and seeds and dried fruit next time! Or maybe olives and rosemary and sundried tomatoes...endless possibilities

This is a great basic recipe! We loved the "old world" taste, it reminded us of breads from Europe. And it has a moist, chewy texture on the inside, married to the perfect crust! 
I modified it to a practically allergen free bread (except gluten), doubling the recipe, I used sprouted wheat flour (because it digests like vegetables), left the oats whole, mixed in canola oil (even healthier than olive oil), ricemilk instead of cowsmilk, and stevia instead of honey. Then baked it for 1 hour at 350F. 
Thank you for this recipe!

I only had instant oatmeal on hand, so I used that instead of rolled oats.  I also replaced the oil with a heaping spoonful of homemade applesauce to make it totally fat free.  I was pressed for time, so I just dumped the batter into an 8 by 4 loaf pan instead of shaping it.  I left it in the oven for a little longer than 20 minutes, so it was on the crusty side.  Since I love crusty bread, it was perfect!  Great recipe.

It is a simple and fast recipe.  I doubled the recipe, didn't grind the oats, added 2 teaspoons of flax seed, substituted soy milk for milk, added 1 teaspoon of baking soda and baked in 350F for 1 hour as suggested by some viewer. This is a keeper.

I followed the recipe and my bread came out very flat and I did not care for the texture either.

Used coconut milk to make these dairy free and baked them in cupcake tins.  I cannot believe how easy and YUMMY they are.  Impressed and totally adding these to my regular rotation!  Thank you!

Made a single serving spread across three mini muffin cups.  Didn't grind oatmeal, used soy milk, and added a dash of cinnamon and vanilla.  Baked for seven minutes in those three mini muffin cups.  Very easy and was delicious on its own!

The first time that I made this I followed another user's suggestion to add 1/2 cup ground flax seed and the result was extremely dry, crumbly bread.  I made it a second time and did not add the flax seed and also increased the honey to 2 TBL and baked it in an 8" square stoneware dish and it was AMAZING!  The bread was very moist and not at all crumbly or dry.  When I make it again I will try adding 1/4 cup (or less) of the flax seed and see how it effects the bread.  I'd love to add the flax (for the health benefits) but 1/2 cup is too much.  Perhaps lowering the flour or oats to compensate for the extra flax may work too!  Some reviewers have mentioned that the dough was too runny but I did not find that to be the case.  I would hesitate to add additional flour because you may end up with dry, crumbly bread! Great recipe otherwise!

This is a great alternative to yeast bread (note the quick bread in the title). So it's not going to have the texture of a regular knead-rise-repeat bread. That being said, I thought it was yummy. I did not process the oats, I added a T. each of flax seeds, pepitas, and sunflower seeds. I also used homemade applesauce, thus cutting back on the honey/milk mixture to 2/3c. I baked it at a lower temperature (400) for about 5-10 minutes longer than suggested. To address the rise issue, I added 1 t. of vital wheat gluten. It's still not airy and light, but I certainly enjoy hearty, dense breads like this one!

I love how fast and easy this bread is to make.  I never grind the oatmeal and it turns out fine.  The dough is too runny to form into a ball so I just scrape it onto the baking sheet with a rubber scraper.  I tried it once in a bread pan, but the inside took too long to bake.  I may try it again using another reviewer's suggestion to lower the temp to 350 and bake for 1 hour.  The taste is always great.

I've been looking for a lower calorie baked good for breakfast, and this was perfect.  The unbaked dough tasted a little bland, so I added a dash of cinnamon.  I did not process the oatmeal.  I baked it in a 9x9 pan, and it took about 15 minutes.  I cut it into 9 squares, and ate it topped with just a touch of apple jelly.

This was great! The honey is nearly imperceptible, but I don't need my bread sweet, so this recipe fit the bill! Yeild is one really small loaf, so next time I'll double the recipe to make proper-sized bread slices. I baked for 40 minutes.

Very good as is!  Let the oatmeal soak up the milk for a few minutes before forming into an oval and bake as directed.

This was good.  I didn't grind the oats, but that was the only change I made.  The batter was kind of runny, so I had to put it in a pan to bake.  20 minutes wasn't quite long enough, next time I'll do a little more.  I'll also add cinnamon next time.  But other than that, this was a tasty, quick breakfast.  Thanks!

Very quick to make.  Ground my oatmeal in the food processor then pulsed it after all of the ingredients were added until a ball formed.  Placed in a greased loaf pan and baked 20 minutes.  A dense loaf.  Served it with a tomato based veggie soup.  Delicious with butter.

This is a really good recipe. I made the batter, but it seemed a little liquidy, so I made mini muffins instead. They turned out wonderful. They're perfect for a quick and healthy snack!

This is an excellent recipe. It was easily adapted to a bread machine. First of all double the recipe so that it makes a regular sized loaf of bread. I also added two eggs. Just put two eggs into a two cup measuring cup and beat well. Add milk to make two cups. Put the milk mixture into the bread machine along with the oil and honey. Add the processed oats, flour, baking powder, and salt. I also added some fennel and sesame seeds. Finally, use the quick bread setting on the bread machine.

Yum! This bread is really good! I made it to eat with soup for supper. It was delicious warm with jam on top. Not only is it very quick and easy, but it tastes great and is healthy as well! I had problems with runny batter, so I ran to the computer to see if other reviewers had this problem and see what they did to correct it. However, when I got back, my batter had thickened up enough to put on a baking pan. So if you have problems with runny batter, let it sit for a few minutes! Thanks for sharing this yummy recipe!

A great quick bread! I was looking for an alternate to making a yeast bread because I was short on time. This one hit the spot! Like others I doubled the recipe and baked it in a loaf pan at 350 for 1 hour. Thanks for the keeper!

This was amazing! Oats are really good for you so I'm glad to find a bread recipe for it that tastes so delicious. I read most of the reviews & poured the batter into 2 mini loaf pans & baked them for 15 minutes. I added 1/3 cup Splenda, 2 tsp cinnamon & used 2 tbsp honey since that was easier to measure than 1 1/2 tbsp. I also didn't bother to grind the oats; it didn't make any difference & it saved time. Thanks so much!

I wanted a no yeast bread recipe because sometimes I feel that regular bread can make you feel bloated.  I tried this recipe, adding about 1/3 cup extra whole wheat flour, and used steel cut oats instead of regular oatmeal ground in the blender.  I also used 1/2 whole and 1/2 skim milk.  I greased the cookie sheet well, baked it at 375 degrees, for about 23 minutes until the bottom sounded hollow when tapped.

We LOVE it!  It's like dessert, atleast to us since we try to eat super healthy.  It reminds me of corn bread, except it's better.  Great plain, with butter, or jam.  Even my 8 year old daughter loves it.  This will definately become a regular staple in our house.

I really liked this bread even though it was quite dense.  It was quick and easy - great if you want to make something fresh and last minute!  I had to add a bit more flour to the dough so that I could form it into a ball - it was quite runny with the measurements given.  I think I'm going to play around with the recipe, try it with some yeast, so that it's more like a real bread.

Holy Moley this is GOOD! I love that it's fast and knead-free. This is indeed a dense loaf, but it's perfect for sandwiches or with a smear of jam/honey. I used mainly white all purpose (bc I was low on wheat), used whole uncooked oats, substituted the honey with vanilla yogurt, doubled the recipe, and added about an extra cup of flour to get it the right loaf-like consistency to turn out on a baking stone. I'm making two loafs again tonight to last the coming week. Great recipe. Thanks for sharing!

I used sour cream instead of oil. Turned out okay. I put it in a loaf pan and had to bake for 30min not 20 and i love the taste of it. Recommend adding more salt. Very dense!! But considering the quickness & easy ingredients....its good.

I made this bread this afternoon, and it was my very first loaf of bread that came out good.  It was terribly easy!!  I didn't grind the oatmeal, and doubled the recipe per suggestions.  It perfectly filled my standard bread pan.  I was looking for a bread that didn't require yeast and/or kneading, since I am pregnant with a toddler "helping".  Haha!!  This was delish!  Served with homemade chicken soup tonight and my family raved.  enjoy!!

Love this quick bread. It is a wholesome, hearty bread. Quick and easy to prepare. It is difficult to shape as others have noted. I add extra oatmeal (unground or very lightly ground) to help it hold its shape as well as let it set a few minutes before shaping. I also add ground flax-seed for extra nutrion. Made a GREAT sweet bread by adding approx 1/5 cup of cocoa powder, 1/2 banana and chocolate chips. Fabulous hot out of the oven!!  I baked at 350 for a while and then covered tops with tinfoil and turned oven up to 390. Does take longer, but turned out better than when I baked it at 450. Can't wait to try it with a yummy cheese, sundried tomatoes and garlic.

This recipe is very quick, easy, yummy, and a healthy alternative to white bread. I did have to add about a 1/4 cup of more flour, as 1 cup of flour left the dough very sticky. To ensure that the loaf cooks all the way through, flatten the dough a little once you place it on the baking sheet.

Adding a 1/4 cup golden raisins and a 1/4 cup sunflower seeds made this a delicious and healthy breakfast bread. I also poured the batter into a loaf pan and baked it at 350 for 35-40 minutes. Good flavor, nicely dense and hearty - again, perfect for breakfast. Thanks for a great recipe! 09/10*I'm adding an update with a photo (this time I added cheese to the mix). I really like this recipe for it's versatility. You can add anything to it, such as nuts, seeds, dried fruit, depending on what your purpose for making it is. I was out of bread for my kids' lunches, and I remembered this recipe just in time to whip up a quick batch. I added the cheese to the batter, then sliced it thin and sandwiched it with thin deli sliced meat. It was a real lunch saver. Thanks again for sharing the recipe!

This was the best bread I've ever made. It was so easy to make. Like others, I substituted the oil for home-made apple sauce, and baked for 1 hour at 350 degrees. The only thing I'd warn about this bread is to eat it within 3-4 days, because after that, the flavour changes a little bit. Within that time, though - delicious! And you can feel completely guilt-free eating as much of it as you want because it's so healthy!

I doubled the recipe as garnered from  the reviews that I read. However, I did make a few changes myself, I used old fashioned oats, 3 TBLS unsweetened applesauce, 1 TBLS cinnamon, 1 TBLS pure vanilla extract, replaced the milk with non dairy coconut milk and a 1/2 cup chopped pecans.  As I was mixing the dough I noticed that it was stiff compared to the reviews, but I think that is could be attributed to grinding the oats, as well as the type of oats that I used.  I baked it at 350 for 1 hour.

I agree with other posters, the bread is very dense, but also very good. I used agave instead of honey and did not grind up the oatmeal. Easy, quick and delicious, freezes great too...one suggestion, unless you want a really small loaf I would suggest doubling the recipe.

This is a great versatile recipe! I doubled the recipe, didn't grind the oats, added 1/2 cup of ground flax meal, 1/2 of chopped pecans, 1/2 cup of dried cranberries, 2 tsp of cinnamon, substituted EVOO for vegetable oil, and substituted with vanilla soy milk as well.  Baked a dozen muffins at 375 degrees for 20 minutes (until toothpick was clean).  They have a great crusty muffin top and a delicious taste.  Fantastic breakfast or snack muffin!

This has become the only bread we have in the house. My mom and I have been using it as a dieting bread. It's only 2 weight watchers points and it's so hearty that after we eat it, we're full all day. It's incredible. Last time I made it I altered the recipe by adding a table spoon of canned pumpkin and a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice to the dough and an additional teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice to the top for added flavor and it was exceptional. This isthe perfect low fat quick break and it's easily customized. 10 stars across the board! Thank you!

Have a great tip! Instead of milk use water and boil it then add the honey and oil and oatmeal. Soak for 10 minutes. I also did what another reviewer suggested and added cinnamon, vanilla, one egg white  half teaspoon soda and threw in some flax seeds. Bread was very pliable and formed a great loaf so I baked it in a loaf pan for 35 minutes at 400.

Great easy recipe.  Thanks for sharing.  I will be keeping this one!! I grew up eating dense breads... no need for regular snacking.  This is so quick and healthy.

I doubled the recipe to get a regular loaf and used soy milk.  I also did not grind all the oats so it had a bit more texture.  When next I bake this ( pretty soon) I will consider not doubling the honey.

Delicious and easy recipe. Instead of oil, I added fat-free Greek yogurt. This swap for oil worked very well in this recipe. I also added dried cranberries to the dough and dusted the top of the loaf with Italian herb blend before baking. Definitely double the recipe if you would like a bigger loaf of bread. No need to put the oats in the food processor since using whole oats makes this bread even better tasting.

OK MY FIRST TIME HERE, WANTED A NO YEAST BREAD, MADE THIS ONE, but i replaced veg oil for olive oil, and almond milk instead of regular milk.....it didn't quite stay in a ball, it really flattened out on the baking sheet, at 20 mins i took it out , bottom was definitively cooked  - was about 1 cm on the edges and about 6-7 cm in the middle, i cut it in half and it was still doughy on the inside, so i had to cut it down the center and split it open and pop back in the oven for a few mins...what did i do wrong??? other than that - it taste  fine and will try again - lol becus of the hack job on the bread my lunch wasnt quite as appealing looking but  my tuna, avacado spread with some butter on this bread was very yummy!

Yummy. Mine turned out very flat but I think that was because I replaced part of the whole wheat flour with spelt which usually doesn't rise as much. I also didn't bother to grind the oats. Great with tea.

In all honesty, I felt this was a 4 star. I did sub corn syrup for the honey, as I was out. That might be what makes this recipe. For my taste, it was very bland. I will try it again with honey ! Thanks for sharing this recipe !

I've done this both with and without grinding the oats, and while it does hold together better after grinding, it was still good without grinding.  Since I don't have whole-wheat flour, I used all-purpose.  Extra flour seems to be needed to hold the bread together with all-purpose, as I couldn't form the dough into a ball without it.  I like to use partly-crystallized honey for this recipe, and triple the honey for a sweeter bread (this could have added to my goopy dough).  The solid crystals of honey melt in the oven and create "sweet spots" in the bread.  The effect is subtle, but pleasant.  Since trying this recipe and learning how wonderful quick breads can be, I've started experimenting with other recipes as well.  While there is something different about yeast breads, I find the quick breads so much easier and just as enjoyable in their own way.  I might start keeping a tub of pre-ground oatmeal on hand just for this recipe.

This was very small and crumbly - not appropriate for toast,  but it was very tasty warm with butter and jam.  I may double the recipe and try baking it in a loaf pan next time.  The oats provide a great taste.  I can't comment on how well this bread keeps because we finished it off in less than 24 hours!

This was my first time making bread and so I was a little nervous. But this bread was amazing. I made it with just white flour cause I don't have whole wheat and substituted oil for applesauce then baked it at 400 degrees for 45 minutes and it was so good.

phenomenal. I usually add yogurt instead of milk, cut out the oil, add raisins (~1/2 C) or chocolate chips to be really decadent. I make it into 2 med loaves.

This bread was very easy to make, rose very well, and had a nice texture.  However, I thought it tasted terrible.  All I could taste was the Baking Soda, which I hate.  I think I will try it again with half the BS and cook it in the microwave to give it a bit more lift.

Delicious, hearty, and healthful! I followed the suggestions of others and doubled the recipe. I also made some substitutions. I used 1 cup 2% and 1 cup skim milk. Instead of all rolled oats, I used 1 cup whole brown flax seeds and 1 cup quick cooking oats. At the suggestions of others, I baked it at 350 for an hour in a bread pan. I covered it up after 30 minutes of baking as the top was starting to get brown but the inside was not near ready. The loaf of bread is beautiful! The top is nice and crusty while the inside is moist and flavorful! I will be making this again! I wouldn't recommend this as a sandwich bread, but I think it will be good warmed up with butter or even toasted with jam.

This bread tastes great! I only gave it 3 stars because the recipe as written was to runny to make a dough you could put on a baking sheet. Like others I had to go ahead and double the recipe and pour into a loaf pan and like others baked at 350^ for an hour. Thanks for posting and thanks to all who had great fixes to save this. It does taste great with some jam!

The dough was too soft, so I had to add about 1/2 c more flour.  The cooking time was also too short.  I think I had to keep the bread in the oven for another 5-10 minutes.

I made this for my grandparents and they absolutely loved it. I followed the recipe exactly and added 2tbsps of ground flax seed to the dry ingredients for a little extra nutrition. I baked this up in the morning and was surprised to see that 3/4 of the loaf was gone by evening! My grandmother keeps eating it as is without any spread and grandpa had a few slices with cream cheese. I haven't tried it and probably won't since there are only two slices left! But from what I can see, this is definitely a five star recipe. Thanks for sharing!

very good. i had to add an additional 1/2 cup of flour. it was way too soupy. i also baked it in a loaf pan. "mo mo, peez" was what my two year old had to say about it (more please). awesome with butter and honey the next morning! i can see why some people might think it's too plain. you have to appreciate the flavor of the oat and wheat, as that is what shines through. perfect for me and my family. oh, it is crumbly to slice right after baking. however, the next day it slices much better.

Our students in our "Life Skills" class at Gainesville High School has made this recipe several times. We all like it alot, but the last time we made it, we spooned the batter into a muffin tin. It was delicious! The bread was softer and more tender. Maybe because it wasn't handled at all. We also added dried cranberries to give it a little sweetness. We love this bread! It is a great, healthy snack.

couldn't be quicker or easier to make; mind, it doesn't rise much, the result is a bit dense and hearty. I didn't process the oats, I thought if I'm being lazy and have no time to wait the normal yeast rising process an'all, well, so the minimum amount of fuss it shall be: but it was ok, expecially served hot

I like this bread because of how fast and easy it is to make, but if you're looking for sandwich bread, look elsewhere.  It's good for serving as a side to a meal or spread with something for breakfast.  I made the mistake of pouring the batter into a large loaf pan.  It doesn't really rise, so it came out about an inch or two tall!  It still tastes good, though!  It's pretty healthy, too, so I would definitely make this again.

This is SO easy and pretty healthy.  I made the whole thing in the food processor (less bowls to clean).  I ground up the oatmeal, then added the rest of the dry ingredients (i added 2Tblspn ground flax seeds to boost the nutrition, some pumpkin seeds, and a little extra salt.)  Then i mixed up all the wet ingredients as directed (used soy milk instead of milk, and a little extra honey), added that to the food processor, and whirled it until is formed a dough.  I used an ungreased non stick loaf pan.  Turned out yummy.  Next time i might add an egg to the wet, i think it might do good things for the texture.

I was dismayed when the batter was so runny, but i just put it in 6 muffin tins and baked at 400 degrees for 20 minutes.  They were good, basic, healthy muffins.  I look forward to adding nuts, spices, dried fruit, etc.

Wonderful bread,esp. when you don't have time for a yeast bread. The first time I made it I ate about half of it before it even cooled.  It is a tasty bread to make when you really don't want rolls.  Goes with a meal very nicely, even tomato soup.  This recipe is one of my favorites.

Very good and simple bread. I double the recipe to make a full loaf and bake at 350 for 1 hour. When doubling, I use 4 T. of honey.

It's also good to mix in a can of pumpkin with come cinnamon or a cup of mashed bananas with walnuts. Delicious!

The flavor and texture were pretty good, but there was no way this was going to make a loaf.  The dough is very, very soft and not able to hold a shape, so I made biscuits out of these. I gou 7-8 good sized biscuits out of the recipe.  They rose pretty nicely while baking.  Baking time was much shorter this way, too.  They were good with butter or fresh avocado spread on while warm.

This was so good. It also passed the picky kids test. Did change a couple of things. I used Canola oil instead of vegetable and Agave instead of honey(didn't have any).Did have to lower the baking temp to 425 because of the Agave and cooked it five minutes longer. Also I sifted the dry ingredients and that took care of that baking powder after taste. Will double the recipe next time.

Oh, my goodness, this bread is heaven, heaven, heaven.  The flavour, the textures-!   Even my older brother, who normally won't touch oatmeal with a ten-foot pole, fell in love with this bread.

(All the same, I think I'll use a loaf pan next time.  My little loaf came out looking like an old bumpy tortoise shell.  Cute, but not enough like a bread-loaf.  I got squeamish and didn't want to touch the batter enough to form a ball, so I kinda just dumped it onto a sheet, then roughly formed it with spoons.  -_-;; )

This bread is Great!!  I love the texture and the taste.  I do have kids so I added some extra honey to make it a little sweeter.  I also added some wheat Bran to make it a little healtheir.  Might try wheat germ next time!!!  Thank you for the Great Recipe.

One weekend some girlfriends and I were staying over at a British friends' house and she whipped up a loaf of this heavenly bread while we were finishing out morning beauty routine.  She topped it with British Heinz baked beans, a poached egg, and a bit of ground pepper and it was simply the most hearty and delicious breakfast I think I've ever had.  We couldn't bear to leave any of the bread uneaten so the rest of the loaf scarfed down with a bit of drizzled honey and butter. With no modifications to this loaf it was enough to happily fill 3 tummies.  An abolute treat and ridiculously quick and easy to make!

This bread was pretty bland. I added a teaspoon of cinnamon, but it actually needed far more than that. I will definitely make this again, because I loved the texture. Next time I'll add a lot more cinnamon, and most likely some dried fruit and nuts. I'll also probably stop trying to make loaves and make oatmeal bars instead.

Followed recipe exactly, used soy milk, dough was very dry, was barely able to form it into a ball.
Baked @ 450 for 20 min and outside ok but middle wasn't cooked. May try again in 2 mini loaf pans as previous reviewer suggested.

The dough comes out much too runny to form into a ball and even when baked in a greased loaf pan the outside cooks well but the inside stays doughy.

Great, simple recipe! I substituted coconut oil for the veg oil, unsweetened almond milk for the milk, added a splash of vanilla, then baked it in a greased loaf pan, and it turned out perfectly. The only challenge here was stopping myself from eating the whole loaf...

I made this yesterday and portioned it out into 4 chunky servings. I had some this morning for breakfast with peanut butter and jam... delicious! For a quick bread, it's a great recipe. Doesn't take long to prepare or bake. Excellent! (Note: I used unsweetened almond milk instead of cow's and it worked well).

It was late on a Friday night I really wanted to have some bread.  I am trying to avoid bread products with yeast; which is astronomically difficult, but then I found this recipe and tried it out.  WOW! This recipe was fast, easy and the bread turned out very moist and delicious!  I only substituted hemp milk for the cow's milk and it still turned out great!  Thanks for the recipe!

i just made this bread. i read the reviews, and i thought it may be a good bread to try. I'm currently trying out a vegan diet so i made this bread vegan. i substituted the honey for maple syrup and the milk for soy milk. i am amazed how fast this recipe is to whip up. i wasn't thinking and cooked this bread on a cookie tray, it was very runny and came out VERY flat. opps

I made this bread today, and it is wonderful! I love quick breads! I doubled the recipe and placed in a large loaf pan and baked at 350 degrees for 45 minutes as another reviewer suggested. I also did not grind the oatmeal. It turned out great. I substituted agave nectar for the honey and coconut oil for the vegetable oil. I will be making this again very soon. It could not be easier!

This bread was moist with just the right amount of sweetness, delicious by itself warm, with honey or jam! I had a little trouble stirring the milk into the oil and honey, but the bread turned out fine regardless! I baked it at 350 like the others, but mind only took about 40-45 minutes. The easiest bread ever, too!

Really quick and easy. I used quick oats and left them whole. Also,I added a dash of cinnamon and used sour milk in place of regular milk. I cooked this in my 10.5 inch cast iron skillet and it only needed 15 minutes to get done.Smells and tastes wonderful as is, or slather with butter for a real treat. Thanks for the recipe.

I doubled this recipe and used 1 1/2 cups wheat flour, 1/2c wheat bran, 1/2 c wheat germ, 1 1/2c rolled oats(I didn't grind them) 1/2c finely chopped walnuts and used about a 1/4c of homemade applesauce that I had to use up instead of the oil. I baked them at 425 in a muffin pan because I made it before in a loaf pan and the middle was raw. These are healthy with a great crust and a nice soft middle thats not too dense. My favorite whole wheat recipe

Excellent, healthy and super quick and easy.  I leave out the honey.  This is a real find!  Love it and so does my family and guests.  They are so impressed I baked bread for them.  They have no idea how easy this is.

5 stars for healthy, easy, and yummy! I added a handful of blueberries and chopped almonds, which add to the healthy yummyness. I also used fat free milk and olive oil, for the sake of health, which makes it totally 100% healthy. The flavor is not spectacular in the sugary/fatty sense, but if you don't mind healthy, it's great :)

This is absolutely amazing! I just tried it, never thought it will come out sooo good from such simple recipe. First when I tasted it while still warm I thought it was bitter but later I ate quarter of it just myself. I was looking to bake something with oatmeal because I have a big bag I bought to bake oatmeal cookies but figured they are too sweet & not too healthy. I added 5 tbs of honey as I like it a little sweet and its healthy enough to afford more honey. Also, cinnamon, cloves, and vanilla. I sifted the flour and used grind oatmeal. I will have this amazing bread every morning for coffee. I cant imagine something so healthy and still tasty. Thanks a lot for sharing!

This is a great recipe! I followed the recipe exactly, and came out with a tasty, quick bread that my husband thought I must have spent a lot of time on.

YUM! Only change I made was to use Quick Oats, because we didn't have rolled oats in the house. Didn't have to process the oats since they were already broken down. The dough is pretty wet but it is supposed to be a "flatter" type loaf and works okay baking on a cookie sheet per directions. Also loved the crunchy bottom and top. Great with butter or without!

Fast, easy, versatile. And tasty! I was out of milk, so I used plain yogurt, and that worked fine. Other reviewers mentioned the dough being runny, and mine wasn't--so maybe yogurt even works better than milk. I also used barley flour instead of whole wheat flour, because I have a bag of it I'm trying to get rid of. Worked fine. I would double the recipe next time.

I love this! I made one recipe in two mini loaf tins, and they were perfect! I also took the previous advice and added cinnamon and vanilla extract and also sprayed the tins and tops of the loaves with butter PAM before cooking (20 min @ 435deg). The bread is slightly sweet and kind of reminds me of bran muffins. Easy, healthy, delicious. . . I'll definitely be making this often! Thanks for sharing :)

Incredibly simple with good results: with supervision my not-quite-five-year-old granddaughter could do well with this.  I'd recommend raising the flour content to 1½ cups of whole wheat, and boosting the baking powder to a full tablespoon.  I say this because my initial observation of the dough ready to bake was rather soft/sticky.

ALSO: a pizza stone dusted generously with cornmeal is a first-rate baking surface.

This is a good quick bread! I was looking for a quick bread that was hearty, healthy, and not decidedly sweet like a pumpkin or zucchini bread. This fit the bill really well. I doubled all the ingredients, used apple butter instead of the oil, and used 1 1/2 cups of skim milk and 1/2 c light sour cream. At the end, I tasted the batter and felt that it wasn't sweet enough to balance out all the baking powder, etc, so I added another few tablespoons of apple butter and it was great. I will make this again!

This bread is delicious!However, I did make the following substitutions: I used the one 1 1/2 tbsp of honey but added and extra third cup and decreaded the milk by 1/3 cup. I also added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp of nutmeg, and 1 cup of cranberries and 1/4 cup of chopped apple,YUM!

I don't think I'll make this recipe again, it was kind of bland. Also, the dough was so wet I had to put it in a  loaf pan, it definitely wouldn't stay in shape to put on a baking sheet as instructed.

This is a great recipe for me, as I don't own a bread machine. I love how easy it was to throw together and how healthy it is. It's very heavy, but still delicious with a bit of butter right out of the oven. Next time I will use maple syrup instead of honey because everyone in my house likes sweet bread!

This was an awesome bread. And so easy and quick!--not to mention healthy. My 21-year-old son ate a whole loaf at once (I thought the dogs had gotten it!) and my partner and I split the other one! So much for making bread for the week! I used loaf pans as the dough seemed a little loose to form into a ball. Next time I'm going to oil them better, as the crust stuck to the pan a little. But no matter, it was delicious with butter. I also used King Arthur's white whole wheat flour.

This is a great base to work from. I doubled as recommended by others. And here are my suggestions....Added 1/2 cup of flaxmeal, 1/4 cup high fibre oatbran, used applesauce instead of oil, 3/4 cup raisins, dash of vanilla, and 1-2 tsps of cinnamon. If I wouldn't have added in the extra bran and flax I think 2 cups of milk would have been a tad to much. You can alter this recipe very easy. (would have been 5 stars...but I did change it up a bit) I'm looking forward to trying a piece out in the toaster.

This recipe is a keeper. This is a poor-man's bread. In these hard times it is perfect. I did not use whole wheat bread(didn't have any) and put the dough in a loaf pan. My children gobbled this up. We made this for breakfast with butter, jam and apple butter. Great for any meal and for a quick snack. Thanks for sharing this.

This is wonderful base recipe for quick bread. It does make a rather small loaf (I started out with the original amounts to test it, though I wish I'd doubled it!), and I highly recommend add-ins: flax seed, sunflower seeds, any sort of fruit or spice you could think of...The bread itself is delicious with butter or jam, but adding spices or fruits would make it a great sweet bread, too!

I cut the recipe in half, and added about a Tablespoon of garlic powder to it. I ran out of honey after 1 teaspoon, so I used 1.25 teaspoons of corn syrup. That may be what gave this a sightly off taste. My batch did not form a 'soft dough' of any kind; it was definitely batter, so I plopped it into a greased mini-loaf pan and cooked it at 450 for 20 minutes. Came out perfect!

I made this the other night for my first attempt at making bread, i thought it was delicious! I used vanilla soy milk because that is what i had on hand in place of the dairy milk.  I used old fashioned oats (the kind i use with oatmeal) because that is also what was in the house.  I did not double the recipe and bake in a regular bread pan like others had suggested because i did not want to waist any if it did not turn out good.  I added a little maple syrup because my boyfriend has a huge sweet tooth and i was trying to help hide the taste of wheat flour. I also accidentally forgot to grease the pan i was using (I used a glass 9x12 i believe) and i did not really have a problem with it sticking at all.  Will defiantly make this again!!

I made this today with a few substitutions.  First, I doubled the recipe and baked it in a loaf pan at a lower temp for an hour, as suggested by previous reviewers.  I used non-fat dry milk powder and water in place of the milk, an equal amount of Splenda in place of the honey and eliminated the salt (trying to cut back on sodium). I also didn't grind up the oats since I like the texture they add to my baked goods.  I took another reviewer's advice about making sure to grease the pan well - I used a cooking spray and also placed some parchment paper in the pan.  Worked like a charm!  The bread came out wonderfully.  This is such a delicious and easy recipe for making a whole wheat bread.  Next time I make it, I am going to try using Fiber One cereal in place of part of the oatmeal in order to pump up the fiber.

Following other reviewers advice, I doubled the recipe and used a loaf pan.  Other than that, I made no alterations.  I found the texture of the bread perfect, but the flavor a tiny bit bland.  I think it needs either a little more salt or a little more honey to really be a knockout.  However, I can't fault it for its simplicity or its healthiness!  I can see this being great with cinnamon and nuts, or mixed dried fruit, or topped with streusel....

This is good bread, especially for how easy it is. I don't process the oats, & I have used rolled oats and quick oats and they were both fine. I have also doubled the recipe & baked it in a loaf pan.  It is so quick to throw together, it can be ready by the time the oven is preheated!  I like it warm with butter. It's pretty crumbly, so I don't think it would be good for sandwiches.

This was very tasty.  I substituted molasses as i had run out of honey.  Turned out great- crisp on the outside, soft yet dense and chewy on the inside.  So easy and quick, I'll definitely make it again.

This didn't turn out for us.  I'm not sure if being at a high altitude is what did it, but even right out of the oven, we found it to be pretty hard and fairly dry.  We did eat it with butter and honey, and it was an okay breakfast, but we probably won't make it again.  Good luck to those at lower altitudes tough!

This bread is delicious! I actually didn't like it when it first came out of the oven, but by the time it had cooled completely, I'd eaten half the loaf myself! I doubled the recipe and it turned out beautifully and was ridiculously easy to make!

Just what I was hoping for in a healthy quick bread!  Flavor is great. I doubled recipe and added wheat germ (3T) and sunflower seeds (1T)and baked for about 52 min.@ 350.  Sprinkled the bread with additional oatmeal and sunflower seeds.  Doubling the recipe yields a substantial loaf.  Excellent fresh out of the oven!  Thank you for posting; I'll be making this again.

This didn't taste very good to me.  It was very very dry and crumbly.  Also took longer to cook than the recipe states.  I ended up throwing it away.

I am impressed! This recipe is such a keeper - so easy and versatile, I added ground flax meal, extra whole oats and swapped the honey for maple syrup (but used 3 or so tbs) and added cinnamon and cloves. also used spelt flour instead of whole wheat so the extra liquid (maple syrup) made up for its different properties i think and made it slightly sweet. SOOO good! DON'T replace the oil with applesauce - one tablespoon will hardly make a difference in nutrition but it is really important for the consistency.

I just made this bread yesterday morning for breakfast.  I baked it the 20 minutes recommended, but alas it was not done when I cut it.  I had put in an extra 1/3 c of quick oats because so many said it was too moist to pat into a ball.  I think the best solution is to leave it moist as per recipe and put it in a small loaf pan.  I haven't tried it, but I will the next time I make it.  I also added some flax meal to give it a little more fiber and used virgin olive oil to make it more healthy and Weight Watcher friendly.  I definitely will make it again.  It had good flavor.  The key to remember is that this is a quick bread, not a SWEET bread.

I agev this 3 stars because it came out quite bland. I added cinnamon too. My 2 yr. old likes it, which is great, but I think it's wutever. Nothing special. It would probably be pretty tasty with some banana or maybe pumpkin or rasisins, vanilla....wutever u like, but it does need something. It tastes ok with a jam on maybe. I will definately keep this recipe, but will make changes. If you like foods w/o lots of sweetness/flavor and don't mind bland foods then this is for you. IF YOU HAVE A SWEET TOOTH MOVE ON. Thanks for the recipe anyways!

Excellent!  I made the recipe as written, including baking at 450.  It turned out wonderful.  We finished the loaf in one afternoon.  I am so pleased to have found a whole grain quick bread without eggs (allergies) that actually tastes good.  Thanks for the recipe!

When I made the recipe as written, I ended up with soupy batter, not a soft dough. So I added about 1/2 cup more wheat flour, a little at a time, until the dough became more like really thick brownie batter. I poured it onto my greased cookie sheet and molded it into a flattened ball with wet hands. I didn't have much hope for the end result, but it turned out very well! I think I'll try it again with some flax seed meal instead of the additional wheat flour.

For what these were (a recipe for /quick/ bread) these were very tasty.  They had a very nice oat flavor.  However, the dough was very, very soft.  Even after sitting for ten minutes, the dough was still too soft to form a ball.  So I added about a 1/4c of bread flour and decided to make drop biscuits instead.  I added sunflower seeds and 2 tablespoons of unground oatmeal, so the biscuits were very dense and very chewy, which was what I wanted from this recipe.  I think that next time, I'll treat it like a quickbread and pour the batter into a loaf pan.  I bet it would also be a good base for some less-guilt-inducing garlic cheese biscuits.

Loved it. I doubled the recipe for a more substantial loaf, cut out the oil, reduced the milk to 1 1/2 cups, and added about 6 tablespoons of applesauce and 2 teaspoons of cinnamon.  I still baked it at 450 for exactly 20 minutes.

I thought this was a flop at first. After it has sat on the counter & I have been eating it . . . it has grown on me. Mine did not form a ball. I thought maybe the 1c of milk was too much. It also burned at this high temp. Next time I will try it in a bread pan with less milk and a lower temp. It's growing on me.

this bread is simple and pretty tasty. i used soymilk instead of regular milk.  it didn't rise much, but the rise was just fine for me.  i like it better the next day though, as others have mentioned.  the first day, it tastes a bit too baking-powdery to me.  if anyone knows how to lessen this taste, i'd appreciate it.

We love this recipe! I  took the advice of previous posters, skipped the honey, used skim milk and olive oil, left the oatmeal whole, and doubled the recipe so I could have a loaf for sandwiches. It is a very dense and hearty bread and I am eager to further experiment with the recipe.

This is a wonderful bread. Imitation honey and skim milk makes it friendly to those on a low sugar life style. VERY DELICIOUS. Awesome with soups and stews.

I was a bit disappointed with this bread.  I liked the oatmeal taste, but it baked very quickly, was quite small, and the crust was very crumbly.  The entire bread, in fact, was generally crumbly.  It could have benefitted from an egg, and I may try it again with that alteration.  It was fairly good with jam and might make good muffins.

As suggested by another review, I doubled the recipe and baked it at 350 for an hour. I did not have any honey so I substituted it with sugar. The bread came out moist and quite dense - it hardly rose. I found that although it had a lovely smell, it was rather tasteless on its own. But when buttered and toasted, it was delicious!

This is a very good, basic bread. I added cinnamon and nutmeg, but I still thought it needed something to sweeten it up a little.  Next time I am going to add raisins or chocolate chips.

This bread had a great flavor and was super easy to make (my 10yr old actually made it!), but didn't bake well at the recommended temp/time.  I will try again and follow earlier suggestions of lower temp for longer time.  We added a tablespoon of soy protein powder to make it extra healthy.

The bread smelled delicious and tasted great, but didn't rise very much. Of course that may be due to my temperamental oven. I used a bread pan because the 'dough' was too liquid to form into a ball, and substituted applesauce for the oil.

WONDERFUL recipe. the texture is great and i thought the flavor was also very good. the only changes I made were to add 1/2 tbs more of honey (i wanted a whole wheat bread not a sweet bread) and a tsp of guar gum to help lighten the bread. it came out much better than i expected. don't grind up the oatmeal to a powder,just break it up a little ,it gives the crust an extra crunch but the inside stays soft. I imagine the variations some other reviewers suggested,adding fruit,making it sweeter,adding cinnamon,would also taste good,and i will experiment later on myself. The original recipe is terrific.

I took some of the previous reviewers suggestions, and also added 2 tsp. cinnamon, 2 TBSP. honey, and instead of Splenda I added a scant 1/3 C. of granulated fructose (fruit sugar).  Since it seemed like it would be difficult to shape and bake on a sheet, I made it into muffins (Recipe made about 8 good sized muffins).  It made it fun and kid-friendly, plus easy to freeze for later!  I baked them at 450 for 20 minutes and the tops were a little too golden and crisp...I think next time I would decrease temp. and bake longer if needed.  I could easily see adding blueberries, or apples, or other fruit.  I will definitely make these again!!

This was really good, even after accidentally adding extra salt. I doubled the honey, as suggested, and will probably add even a little more next time. I also added some cinnamon. I baked it in a small glass pyrex dish and it came out great in the amount of time called for. Great fast filling bread - it reminded me of some of the lighter and sweeter brown breads I had when in Ireland. Great with strawberry jam.

This delicious bread is both hearty and healthy. It's also very easy and quick to make. My 17-month-old son ate about half the loaf in a day. It's perfect with honey on top. A new favorite at our house!

Really a very easy bread to make, best if eaten the next day. I don't recommend baking at 350 for an hour, because the crust gets very tough that way. Goes very well with cream cheese or pumpkin butter =)

Very easy and delicious bread.  Hearty and filling.  I didn't blend the oatmeal.  I simply crushed it by hand and it made for a nice additional texture.  If cooking it in a toaster oven either dial down the heat or cut the time in half.  Mine baked in about 10 or 12 minutes.  Came out great!

The baking instructions are horrible. If you follow those instructions you are sure to get a doughy middle and an overcooked outside.
I definitely made adjusts!
I followed the mixing instructions as written. I did add a dash more salt, because that's how I like it. And I think 2 full tablespoons of honey would taste better, but I haven't tried that yet. Then after mixing the liquids with the powders, and seeing how wet it still was, I added more flour until I got a decent consistency. It was still wetter than normal dough that pulls from the side of the bowl. This dough is sticky...slimy is a better word.
I heated my oven to only 350 degrees and cooked it for 40 minutes. And it cooked perfectly at that level.
I really do love the taste of this bread and that's why I didn't give up on it the first time making it.

This was super easy and quick!  Not grinding the oatmeal gives it a nice texture. I added about 1/3 C. more flour and was able to form a free standing loaf.   Baked up beautifully! Tasted great and had chewy texture.  I would add a bit more salt next time to enhance flavor.

Loved it though I did make some changes... Oven at 350F for 55 minutes, extra virgin olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and I did squeeze a bit of lemon on my (almond) milk. Will make again because I want to have another shot at it - the dough did not rise much...

I followed the recipe except for milling the oats and I did a double recipe.  The mixture was too thin to form into a ball, so I added a few tablespoons of flour but that didn't help much; and  I was cooking it in a loaf pan anyway.  I baked it and I may have baked it a little too long, but the texture was a little too heavy for me, it was crumbly, had no flavor, and I don't know if the loaf I made will get all eaten.  I don't think I will make this ever again.

Delicious fast bread! Doubled recipe,used kefir instead of milk, doubled oil, also added a few tbsp. of chia seeds. Baked in large loafpan at 350° for one hour. Came out moist and fully cooked in the middle and a little bit crusty on the outside. Will be making this often!

Are these quantities correct? My batter was soupy, so I kept adding flour until it would hold together in a ball. I probably added another 2/3 cup of flour. The flavor was good, though.

I needed it quick so I put it in a mini muffin tin and baked at 350 for 13 min.  Came out great and quick. Kids loved them.
 Definitely recommend grinding the oats, makes for good consistency. Made a double batch and put half in breadmaker that worked out well too.

The texture was perfect, and the flavor was mostly good.

I think the recipe calls for way too much baking powder though, since it ended up being the predominate flavor in the finished loaf. Doing a quick search, most quick bread recipes call for half that amount.

I liked this bread that was so quick to make. I used molasses as I didn't have any honey, and white flour instead of wheat. I baked it in a loaf pan and it made a thinner loaf but was perfectly done at 20 minutes. I sprinkled oats on top of the loaf as well. Yummy!

Followed the recipe exactly except did not pulse the oats, left them whole. I was excited to try this because of the lack of yeast and the quick prep time. However, I will not make this again; it was just okay. My partner called it "hippie bread."It was dense as the author said, but lacked flavor. Maybe more honey or something else to jazz it up.

Good tasting bread and easy to put together. Like another reviewer i found this to be too wet to form into a ball. Following her lead I added 1/4 cup flour and 1/4 cup ground flax . Bake time for me was 25 minutes. I will make this again, Thank you for the recipe.

We really enjoyed this bread. After everything was mixed the dough was too wet to form into a ball so I added a 1/4 cup flour, still too wet, so I added a 1/4 cup ground flax. I added sesame and pumpkin seeds to the top of the loaf before baking. I loved how healthy this was so I will make this again. Thanks for the recipe.

This tasted pretty good, and was not difficult to make.  However, it was not the consistency to form into a ball and place on a sheet.  I put it in a loaf pan, and baked for 20 minutes.  Tasted good but was crumbly and still just a bit doughy in the middle.  I love butter but thought this actually tasted better without butter.  If I make it again I might try making it in the form of drop biscuits.

Easy , fast and tastes great. Based on other reviews, I added a whole egg (placed in measuring cup, then added milk to equal one cup) and also used a bread pan. I mixed it in my stand mixer and let it mix for several minutes, building up the natural gluten. While still somewhat small, it had a decent rise and baked perfectly in exactly 20 minutes.

I didn't use honey because we don't like sweet bread (we are from Europe and there the bread is salty) and because it is not good for the honey to be cooked - they said it becomes toxic. I used homemade soy milk because we're almost vegans. Just one note: it was difficult to make a shape of the dough (maybe is normal without honey). We loved the bread - it is so tasty! Now I am going to make it again but double sized! :)

This extremely easy bread turned out well! I subbed Unsweetened apple sauce for the oil and used unsweetened cashew milk for the milk and it turned out very lovely! I also added about 1/2 cup of Splenda 0 calorie white sugar baking blend to the dry ingredients and the final result for it turned out slightly sweet, a product that my whole family enjoyed.

I have made this twice now, and loved it. The first time I followed the recipe except I did half honey and half maple syrup, and doubled it to fit in a loaf pan. It was very delicious. I made it again last night but made a fall version! 

Doubled again, but swapped maple syrup for all honey (3 T.), 
swapped PUMPKIN BUTTER for oil (and doubled that again, 4T.) , and used almond milk, but only because thats all I had at the moment. Then I added Cinnamon (1t.), nutmeg (1/2 t.), allspice (1/4 t.), ginger (1/4 t.), and a dash of cardamon to the dry ingredients. It was soooo delicious!!

I made a couple changes to this recipe. I used 1T of honey, 1/2 cup of vanilla unsweetened almond milk, 1/2 cup Greek no fat yogurt. (I didn't have regular milk)  I baked it in an oiled disposable aluminum pie pan. I baked it at 450 for 20 minutes.  It was nice and brown but the bottom didn't sound hollow so I put it back in for another 5 min at 350.  Next time I'll take it out after 20 min, I don't think it needed the extra baking time.  It has a nice flavor, crusty, dense.  But a little dry, I'll try regular milk next time.

This is my second time making this recipe. I two and a halved the ingredients. This was enough for two bread pans although I'll triple it next time for two slightly larger loaves.

I didn't grind the oatmeal. I skipped the oil and added an egg. I like the bread better with the egg. I used 45g of brown sugar instead of honey. For the milk, I used half almond and half 2%. I added two tablespoons of cinnamon. 

I baked it at 375F for 50 minutes.

This recipe provided a pleasantly balanced quick bread base that was perfect to add things into. I threw in some chia seeds, flax meal, corn meal and buckwheat to enhance flavors. It tastes GREAT!  It's kind of crumbly but this might also be due to my ravenously eating it as soon as it was out of the oven. The final note is that even with the recipe doubled, it doesn't make too much. It slices thick and required a bread pan for me to cook it in. But it is extremely tasty. I inhaled three slices with butter and strawberry jam as soon as possible and feel satisfied and awesome.  I also used almond milk instead of soy or whole and sunflower oil instead of vegetable. Yum.

Just made this bread for the first time. I'm also baking a yeast whole wheat bread that has yet to finish it's second rise.  While waiting thru the rises I looked this bread up and baked it. Now tasting it during the second rise, so for quick and easy this one can't be beat.  That goes for taste, too.  The only problem was getting it out of the pan intact.  I cut it the width of my spatula then came at it from the side, but couldn't had to separate it leaving the crust on the bottom of the pan.  Then I went at the remainder lengthwise, though, and that worked.  The bonus was that the bottom crust alone and hot from the oven made a wonderful buttered cracker.
This is not sandwich bread, but it will make a great breakfast bread and is one of the tastiest breads I've ever eaten.
I'm at a fishing camp in Canada right now with limited resources so used maple syrup instead of honey, and it worked out very well.

I find this bread dense, but enjoyable. It's a great breakfast bread. I enjoy it with almond butter and honey. I add a little less milk than called for because I find that the outside becomes hard long before the inside cooks. I also cook it longer at a lower temperature.

This is more delicious than I expected such a simple recipe to be. I left the oats whole, had to sub brown sugar since I was out of honey, and completely left out the oil. I used a tiny specialty loaf pan. Next time, I will double or triple and make a regular-sized loaf. "Next time" will probably be tomorrow, since I am going to eat the whole loaf in short order.

It was totally unexpected.  The bread is very heavy and dense, but delicious.  I mixed it just as the recipe lists, but had to add a bit of flour to the "ball" at the end because it was too wet to make a ball.  It turned out well with two or three tablespoons extra flour (I didn't measure).  My ten year old daughter LOVED it.

The flavor was ok.  The texture was very dense, similar to cornbread. I found the dough very moist - far too moist to form into a ball and bake into a loaf.  I poured it into an 8x8 cake pan (it was all I had) and baked for 20 minutes.  Next time, I would use a loaf pan or reduce the liquid significantly.

Loved this recipes for its simplicity and delicious taste. Dough was too moist so I added more flower. Also I used butter instead of oil and baked it for about 24 minutes. It was delicious.

Exactly what I was looking for! Simple, healthy ingredients to form a bread I can whip up, pour into a loaf pan, bake, and enjoy! It smells so good and tastes devine. I might try adding a smidge of baking soda next time to fluff it a bit,. Thank you for the recipe!

I didn't grind the oatmeal as the recipe said. And I didn't cook it quite long enough it was doughy. I will try it again and grind the oatmeal first. It had good flavor though and we still enjoyed it.

I love this bread ... I used coconut oil and coconut milk which may have made it took sticky because I had to add more flour to get it to form ... I did attempt to loaf it and it was definitely too small ... I also had too much good in the middle ... But the pieces that turned out were yummy and I can adjust this to work using my ingredients! Thanks

I made this recipe 2 times. First time I made it exactly as the recipe was (except I added a bit more flour once everything was combined to thicken it up like bread dough should be). It was good, but its wheat bread so a bit bland. Second time around, I added some Penzey's Baking spice and vanilla, but I did not add the extra flour at the end. It turned out really good except its a bit crumbly, so next time I will add the extra flour at the end to make it a bit more doughy, and it will be perfect!

As is I think this recipe is worth four stars, it is very good. When you add about two teaspoons of vanilla and a liberal sprinkle of cinnamon to the batter it is worth five stars. I enjoy it plain or with honey, the family likes it plain or with vanilla raspberry jam. This is super easy to make, from getting out the bowl to slicing in to the bread takes only 22 minutes and tastes wonderful--we make this all the time and will continue to. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

I am diabetic and have a weakness for bread. White flour and sugar spikes the readings also yeast and I well have history so I stick to WW bread but had run out and was craving for bread. Googled WW bread and found this one. within 10 mins this was in the oven and 20 mins later, home smelling great, a pretty little loaf with coffee - it was scrumptious and I finished it in 4 days. Did wonders to my glucose readings too! Will definitely make it again and again and again. Thanks for sharing

I was surprised by how good this was.  The first batch, I followed nearly exactly.  The only change I made was using butter instead of vegetable oil (and I didn't grind the oats).  Second time, I used water instead of milk, and coconut oil instead of vegetable oil.  It was certainly edible, but not quite as good.  Last batch I went back to butter, and still used water instead of milk (I rarely drink it, so I'd have to buy it just for the bread).  This was just about right.  

I'm a lazy cook.  I love making food from scratch, but hate kneading and rising bread.  This stuff is so easy, just mix it up and throw it on a cookie sheet and voila.

It doesn't rise much, but doesn't seem super dense.  It is soft and moist.  I eat it plain, with butter only, butter and jam, or with soups, spaghetti, meatloaf, whatever.

Mine takes 25 minutes to cook.

I found this recipe the day before yesterday and I have already made it THREE DAYS IN A ROW!!! :) It is so good with a warm soup! I did make some changes to the recipe... I did not have any oatmeal on the shelf so I just used 2 cups of whole wheat flour. I also substituted buttermilk for milk, as the buttermilk is thicker and so the batter will not be as runny. The bread turned out wonderful this way! On one loaf, I did one what reviewer suggested and that was to add a little bit of baking soda to the batter.... This made the bread a little less dense. But it was great without the added baking soda, too! The wonderful thing about this bread is that it is VERSATILE! I added shredded cheddar cheese and garlic to one batch. One batch I sprinkled Italian seasoning on top. It is wonderful. Definitely has already become a staple at my house. Thank you Zoe! :)

This recipe is delicious! As a college student who is trying to save money and live a healthy lifestyle, I decided I would try to make my own bread. I am glad I came across this recipe because it was super easy. I substituted oil for applesauce and honey for 1 tbs. of brown sugar and used 1 cup of skim milk. I baked this in a loaf pan and realized that I should have doubled the recipe..oh well :) Came out moist and wonderful. Very happy to find a healthy quick break.

WOW. I did not expect this bread to be so amazing! I compared other people's reviews and made a few changes and oh boy, this is good!
I added one egg to the recipe and baked it in a loaf pan at 350F for 40 minutes. 
wow. I can't believe something so delightful can come out of a recipe with so little oil!! i love it so much! I can't wait to share it with other people!

This is my go to recipe for fresh healthy bread. I use molasses instead of honey. And as others have said, this is a great recipe to add things too. The batch I made tonight included golden raisins and cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and green cardamon.

This bread turned out so much better than I was expecting. I will be making this for breakfast on the weekend for years to come! I ran out of honey so I had to sub in some maple, but it turned out perfectly. Also used quick oats instead of rolled oats. Topped it off with some extra quick oats... mmm. yummy. perfect with some butter and raspberry jam.

This is very good but I have trouble getting it to rise while baking. It usually ends up being a rather flat loaf of bread, but it's still good.

I doubled the recipe,  added 1/2 tsp baking soda, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp vanilla, raisins, pecans and baked it in a loaf pan.  The whole house smelled heavenly.  And it was a looker!  But it was pretty bland.  I'm baking another tonight but will add 3/4 cup splenda.  I'll let you know how it turns out.  ( ps baked 350 for 1hr).

I really loved this bread.  I wasn't sure what to expect after reading the reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised.  It's very easy to make (which adds to the 5 stars).  I followed the recipe exactly.  The dough was VERY wet after mixing, which really threw me off because there was no way it would hold any shape that way.  I let it sit a few minutes, accidentally, and that made it less wet and a little more voluminous and airy.  I baked it according to directions in a ball shape (as much as it would hold), on a Silpat baking sheet.  I love the taste of the bread out of the oven.  After its been sitting a while, I personally prefer it toasted.  It definitely tastes like oatmeal, and it is dense and crumbly--but that's to be expected from a quick bread.  Next time I will try baking it in muffin cups like another reviewer.

Very tasty and easy.  My changes: I doubled it, didn't grind the oatmeal, used a greased bread pan, and baked it at a lower temperature.  It was very crumbly and didn't stay together so well, but the taste was excellent- definitely the perfect breakfast bread.

It's just okay.  The texture is great and yes it's crunchy/crispy on the outside and moist and dense on the inside.  But I think it is too salty or it's lacking something.  I made two loaves; large and small.  Added raisins to the small one and it's delicious!  The large one is too bland but I'll have to wait and see after my family tries it.  I doubled the recipe and added 4 TBS of wheat germ.  4 TBS of honey and instead of the oil, I used unsweetened applesauce.  Like I said, the texture is great for bread.  Maybe if I added some vanilla?  Will return with comments after I try this recipe again later. I baked it at 350 for 55 minutes in the oven.  Overall...I did not like it much.

I've made this bread "on the fly" many a weekend.  We love the texture, and think it goes best with apple butter.

Great basic recipe!  Super easy, dense and filling but so tasty!  Like many other people, i doubled the recipe and baked at 350 for an hour.

A great bread!  This was my first try with bread and I picked this recipe because I love oat and whole wheat breads, it was fantastic!  I followed the directions as written, but added a teaspoon of cinnamon and a teaspoon of almond extract.  The smell was heavenly and the taste was even better.  This will become a staple in my home.

I tried going for more of a multi-grain bread, so I added 1/2 c. corn meal and 1/4 c. shelled sunflower seeds.  Also increased the baking powder to 2 tsp and the oil to 1.5 tbsp to compensate for the extra volume.  Like other bakers I also slightly increased the honey to 2 tbsp.  It was delicious!!  Can't wait to make it again . . . might try adding some sesame seeds, too.  Baked for about 25 min.

I have to differ that this bread is GREAT. The taste was great BUT I feel like I made a huge muffin in terms of the crumbly consistency of this bread. Maybe this happened because I did not grind the oatmeal. I did soak it in the milk for 10 minutes though. I loved the neutral taste of this dough and I added some sesame seeds on top before baking.  I might try baking this dough in muffin cups next time because it is perfect for that.

Great and fast! I did add some cinnamon and would probably add just a dash more next time.  It smelled great baking. I also did use olive oil instead of vegetable, and even as someone who does not like the taste of olive oil, it was a great substitution, you couldn't taste it.  I also didn't grind up the oatmeal.  I think next time I want to substitute some of the whole wheat flour for something more grainy.

I'm so happy I found this recipe. The batter seemed to have too much liquid at first so I added more flour. I think I added too much and the loaf come out a little dry (but still tasty!). I'll definately make this again and try to be more careful.

The taste would have been great, however the cook time is off. I took the bread out after 25 minutes and it was still very doughy. I should have left it in there for a total of 30-35 minutes.

Very good! And super super easy and using common ingredients, which is basically all I look for in a recipe! (Substitutions I made: white flour for whole wheat, maple syrup for honey, and soy milk for regular milk) Definitely not a sandwich bread, but a very good munching bread! Next time I'll probably double the recipe as the loaf is kinda small.

This a great simple recipe!  A definite keeper!  I followed the advice from some other reviews and doubled the recipe and baked it for 1 hour at 350.  I added 1/8 flax seed, 1/4 sunflower seeds, and substituded unsweet applesauce for the oil.  I can't wait to make it again and add some other stuff like raisins or chopped walnuts.  This bread is very dense, practically a meal by itself.  I ate it this morning toasted with pumpkin butter!  OMG, so good!

Due to my corn allergy I had to pull out the baking powder and do the baking soda/apple cider vinegar substitution... also had to skip the honey, good news is - I just don't think you can mess this one up.  This bread will be a staple in my house now - thank you so much for posting the recipe, I can eat bread again!

I've tried it with honey but I prefer molasses.  Molasses gives it a richer taste and darker colour.  Yum!  The size of the loaf is fine for me, since I am the only one eating it.  And I don't ground the oats, this way the bread is chewy.

This was great,I reduced the honey and added minced garlic and some good quality salt on top.I did not grind the oats just put them in whole.It was baked on a cookie sheet, I just poured it on the sheet and let it shape itself. I also added about half a cup of wheat germ mixed with ground flaxseed.This recipe is a good one to add things to for either a sweet bread or a herb bread. Next time thinking of adding chopped pear,walnuts, and maybe cheddar cheese when its about done. Love these kind of recipes thank you so much for posting.

Doubled the recipe as other reviewers mentioned so I could make a full loaf.  Cooked at 350 degrees for 55 min.  Did not have whole wheat flour on hand, so substituted white.  Delicious warm with butter.  Not real sweet, but hearty!

I made this when I wanted a bread in 30 minutes instead of the 3 hours it takes in my bread maker. It was very moist and good with butter! I would add more cinnamon and nutmeg to add some flavor to it next time.

This was SO easy! I have been making a lot of yeast breads lately and this was such a quick and easy bread by comparison. I used soy milk instead of milk and didn't grind any of the ingredients. It was a very hearty, dense bread with nice sweetness. It was a big hit with my family. Thank you.

Awesome! I was looking for a whole wheat recipe and stumbled on this quick bread. I liked the taste and the fact that it's healthy. I doubled the recipe and baked it at the said temperature and time, and it was brown on the bottom but not cooked completely all the way through. Despite that, I would definitely make this again.

Wish I could give it 4.5. Sometimes the recipe needs tweaking a bit based on the thickness of the batter (it seems a bit inconsistent, so I sometimes have to mess with milk amounts) but it's a great 'bread' recipe for those of us bakers who lack talent with yeast doughs. It's also nice to put in a greased muffin pan to make little muffin/rolls.

I thought the honey added a nice touch to the bread, I prefered this bread to the beer bread I made right after I stuck this in the oven. I accidently picked up whole wheat graham flour and I'm not sure what the difference between regular whole wheat flour and the graham flour is. I also left the rolled oats whole. The mix came out kind of runny so I added maybe another half cup of flour (this was before I re-read the reviews while I was waiting)I also put this in a loaf pan. After 20 minutes the very middle was still kind of gooey so I put it back in the oven for 10 minutes. My friend at school always baked treats and bread with whole wheat and brought me some and it lowered my cholesterol and A1C so I'm making more of an effort to learn to do what she did. practise makes perfect. Thank you for the recipe. This was my first attempt at making bread. I will try and double the batch to make it fill the loaf pan more next time.  Thanks

This is great! I added diced apples, cinnomon, and a little extra honey and I loved it! The only problem was that it needed longer to cook because the inside was still doughy and the outside was getting pretty crisp. I would try making two smaller loaves out of it next time.

I can't believe how easy and quick this is! I made the recipes exactly as is and the "dough" was very wet. I pushed it onto the pan and loosely shaped with my spatula and after 20 minutes, it was awesome. I love fresh bread in the morning and this one is ready quick enough to make daily.

I doubled the recipe, slightly increased the honey (by 1Tbsp) and baked it off in the bread machine.  It turned out great.  I was really pleased with the texture and it thoroughly cooked through in the 1 hour standard cooking time in the machine.

This was a pretty good healthy tasting quick bread. I ate it with a honey butter spread. It was very easy to make. Since the batter was soft, I just put it on a nonstick sheet (you can use parchment paper) and formed a round shape with a spoon.

Yummy!! I'm eating this bread warm out of the oven with raspberry jam now and it's delicious! It's quite a hearty bread but that's the way I like them : ) I added some chopped toasted hazlenuts and seeds (sunflower, pumpkin, sesame, linseed), a few tablespoons of wheat germ, used soymilk instead, doubled the recipe and baked it in a loaf tin at 350 for an hour and 15 mins. I'll make it again for sure! Thank Youuuuuu : )

The flavor was excellent, but I'm just about the world's worst baker, plus I recently moved to high altitude and am still learning to adjust baking times, so mine was underdone. I used sprouted multigrain flour, 3/4 cup oats and 1/4 cup flaxseed, walnut oil, and almond milk, and I sprinkled sesame seeds over the top. This was so easy and quick, I'll be making it weekly. It's more of a soup bread, though; it's not quite "tall" enough for sandwich bread.

I loved this bread. very fast and easy to assemble. I let the batter sit for about 10 minutes because it was very moist right after I stirred it all together. While it never for very firm, it was a very thick batter and cooked up fine. If you don't expect this to be as firm as a traditional bread dough, you'll be fine. I mounded mine up on a sheet covered with parchment papered and baked. Was perfect. In fact I am going to make this bread for my next batch to use for Communion at church.

This recipe was very tasty - the only issues I had with it were textural. I didn't find there was quite enough flour, the dough was too moist so I added about another 1/4 cup. Once baked, the bread is good warm (especially with butter and strawberry jam), but once it cools it becomes very crumbly and you can't even get a thick piece to hold together.

How you do you "shape it into a ball" when it is very much in batter form?  
The ridiculous method of testing for doneness should have caught the eye of whoever approves these recipes.
Having already mixed it up, I put it in muffin cups to bake.  The end result was bland and unmemorable.  Don't bother with this one, folks.

This was a very easy bread for a beginner like me! I made some  changes, i didn't grind the oats. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and baked it in a loaf pan. But still came out great! Will make again.

I will definitely not make this again. My dough was much too liquid to do anything with, it would not have stayed in any shape so I spooned it into my muffin tins and what came out 15 min later were ten little bricks. I don't mind dense bread, I am quite used to it (it's hard to get any real ly good fluffy bread in Austria) but these muffins bread things are just too much to take! I followed the recipe exactly, except that I put some herbs in to make it a bit more interesting but I don't think the herbs messed up this recipe. Sorry, this is just not my type of bread.

I couldn't believe how low cal this was, and heart healthy to boot!  I doubled the recipe.  I used olive oil instead of veggie, added 2 tablespoons of cinnamon, and 1/2 Splenda on top of the honey.  The batter was delicious, even if it did slightly resemble FancyFeast.  :)  I put the batter into 6 mini-loaf pans, sprinkled oatmeal on top, and baked for 20 minutes at 400 degrees.  It came out perfectly.  Yum!

Wonderful. I made this bread today and it was amazing. Not very bread-like but the perfect recipe for drop rolls. My sister buys the premade mix for some amazing drop rolls and this tastes just like them. Even worked well with soy and rice milk instead of regular. I also added ground flax seed, delicious.

I don't know if the weather affects this type of bread or not, but my "loaf" or rather blob on a cookie sheet was more of a brick.  I ground the oatmeal in a chopper/procesor nearly into a powder.  I would love some better instructions to lighten up the loaf!   I will say that the flavor is EXCELLENT!

It is very delicious and dense. I ate a slice and it feels like I ate a lot more. Like many of the other members had mention, the mix was a bit too watery to form into a dough so I just placed it into a loaf pan and the mix did not rise much so it's best to double the recipe. I also replace the milk with soy milk. It came out a bit dry. Overall this bread is delicious. I would make this more in the future and probably lower the temperature and place some raisins or used yoghurt instead of oil.

The bread gets props for great taste and ease of preparation, but I really really wish that it wasn't so crumbly. I added an egg to try to make this hold together better, and maybe it did, but it was still too crumbly for my tastes. I baked this in a bread pan and it was just done at about 30 minutes.

Burnt a little on bottom, eventhough I took it out early. Can't even taste honey at all, I'd rather leave it out and just put it on top of a slice. Not great but I've had worse.

This bread was just barely edible for me. I had no problem getting it to cook thoroughly (450 for 10 minutes, then 375 for 20). The result though was a bread that was dense and crusty like I had been expecting, but also rather bitter tasting. In the mouth it becomes a bitter paste-like substance.

It's a yummy bread great if you don't want to wake up at four in the morning to bake.  I'll use more honey next time and increase the proportions since I got a pretty small loaf.  Thanks.

this bread tastes amazing. it reminds me of the panera whole grain bread, except it's 100% whole grain! baking the bread @ 350 for an hour made the crust hard justthe way i wanted, and since i didn'thave honey, i just used maple syrup. i even omited the table spoon of oil and substitued fat free soymilk for the milk. i justwish the bread rose more, but this is a great recipe

The taste was pretty good, but it took much longer than 20 minutes in the oven to cook all the way through!  By the time the inside was cooked, the outside was very hard and crusty.  My kids and I were a bit disappointed, as our mouths were watering for fresh bread
