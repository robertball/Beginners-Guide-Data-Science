I made this for dinner last night.  I made it w/ ham and used frozen hash browns which I cooked first with some onion. This casserole cooked up quickly and was delicious. The whole family loved it.  Can't wait to make it w/ sausage and bacon next.

This was a big hit at a Board Meeting I attended (for Brunch).  And my husband keeps asking me to make it again. Definitely a meat-lovers egg dish (aka: the perfect high cholesterol fare for a man! ha).  The only thing is that the cooking time is incorrect.  If you soak it overnight (as the recipe says) you'll need to add at least another 45 minutes cooking time to it.  Mine wasn't finished for over an hour and a half and I even upped the cooking time the last 45 minutes to 350 degrees.  So, just make sure you give yourself an extra hour cooking time (even if you might not need all that time) when planning to cook this dish.  I've been told that stratas soaked overnight need to cook longer than ones that haven't been soaking as long. And yes, my oven was preheated and yes I even pulled the dish out ahead of time to warm up to room temperature (I gave it an extra half hour of warming up on its own and I still had to cook it an extra 45 minutes). But I will make this again for sure!  Big hit!

I fixed two of these for Thanksgiving breakfast: one as written and another with mushrooms and sausage.  I loved how I could prepare these night before and pop them in the oven while I set the table and prepared the juices.  Everyone loved them.  They work great for feeding a crowd without slaving away at the last minute.

I was really nervous about making this because of all the reviews about the cooking time and it coming out soggy, but the hints helped and it turned out great for me! Such a hit!! Thanks everyone! I did extend the cooking time to 90 mins and used sausage instead of ham.

Took this to a brunch and it was a huge hit.  Cooking time was dead on.  Can be made without leaving overnight as well and still tastes great.

I made this for Christmas brunch.  I substituted sausage for ham and made it with Turkey bacon.  Everyone loved it and thought it was a perfect celebration breakfast.

I thought this was delicious! I served it at a brunch and received many compliments. I didn't make any changes to the recipe and it was cooked just perfectly after 75 minutes. Yum!

made this for weekend company and it was great.  I was a little shy with the salt because of the bacon/cheese/ham but it could have used a dash just as the recipe said.  Mine was done in 1 hour...don't overcook.

I made this recipe for brunch last Christmas, and we loved it. My then-one year old loved it, too. I used frozen hashbrowns, straight from the bag, to save on time. Otherwise, I didn't change a thing, and it came out great!

Excellent....what a better way to wake up on New Years's Day but to a hot breakfast casserole! Made the day before as suggested...but made a few changes. I used 3 small boxes of brown and serve sausages which I cooked, reduced the eggs to 6, used 1 1/2 c. 1% milk and 1 1/2 c. fat free half and half, and used half a bag of frozen shredded hash browns.  Loved this casserole. Everyone went back for seconds. Will definately make again!

my sister in law has been making this exact recipe for years.  I couldn't find my copy she gave me, so when I found it on Allrecipes.com, I was so excited.  I have made this several times for work pot lucks and for relatives for holiday breakfasts (Easter and Christmas).   It has always been a huge success!  It's worth all the extra time in putting this together.   You can swap out the ham and add sausage also, or both.  I have even made a "Denver omelet" style strata.  So many different options.  YUM!

This was very good - instead of 1# bacon I used 1/2# bacon & 1/2# bulk sausage.  Also, I would definitely layer hash brown potatoes instead of the cooked cubed potatoes I originally used.

Great recipe for Christmas morning!  I used a heavy country bread that I let dry out a little first, a handful of chopped onion and peppers, and a whole pound each of bacon and sausage for my meat loving adult boys.  Next time, I'd probably leave out the bacon, as it got a little lost.   As someone else mentioned, after sitting overnight in the 'fridge, it was not done in 70 minutes ... still was a little runny as I dished it up. But 30 seconds in the microwave for each piece firmed it up nicely, and it was a big hit with the family.

Delicious! Next time I'll definitely add broccoli or asparagus. Could sub sausage and add peppers...the variations are endless.
Hubby loved that this had "real" potatoes. I had leftover baked, and they were perfect.
Can't believe I never made a strata before. I certainly will again- Oh- and I only soaked it for 30 minutes or so- my family tends not to like wet bread. 
Thanks for a great recipe!

Delicious! This is a great basic recipe. I used a large Corningware dish (about 9x13) and the cooking time was perfect.

This turned out better than it sounded.  The consistency is perfect - more like a souffle than a strata.  I'll make it again without any changes.

Fantastic breakfast (or brunch) that will feed a crowd. I use day old Italian bread, not so much milk - you can use evaporated) and I added tomatoes and some peperoni instead of the ham.   They love it!

Brought fixings up North for the couples weekend breakfast.  Everyone LOVED it.  I forgot the potatoes and just added a bit more bread approx 12-13 slices instead.  We added Mushrooms too since they were on hand.  EVERYONE asked for the recipe.

Made this for someone to take to work on New Years Day morning.  Everyone loved it.  I made a variety of changes.  Take the recipe as a place to start; use what you have on hand; cook as indicated.  Frequently I use "recipes" for the BASIC ingredient proportions, pan size, and cooking time.  This was one such case.  Had lots of left over "stuff" and it came out GREAT!

This was just okay.  It seemed to need something else to make it really tasty, but it is worth making again.  Next time I am going to add some chopped broccoli or spinach to get some healthy "stuff" in it.

Made this for Christmas morning. Assembled the night before and stuck it in the fridge.  It was so easy to just put in the oven in the morning.  Timing was correct for mine.  It was really tasty and our guests were impressed!

I had guests arriving around 11 a.m. so I decided to make this dish.  Everyone LOVED it!  Even my 7 year old who is very picky loved it.  I followed the recipe exactly, it came out perfect.  I will definately be making this dish again!!!

For years our family has been making a strata for Christmas morning breakfast. I have always thought it was good, but it was not the best that it could be. I have been on a hunt to find a new, better recipe. I FOUND IT! I absolutely loved the addition of potatoes. Instead of ham, I substituted 1/2 lb. of country style sausage. I'm sure ham would be awesome as well. Thanks for a wonderful recipe. I know that we will make this a tradition in our home.

My husband absolutely loves this recipe.  It's an after church family favorite for us, and a snap to prepare.  I put all the ingredients together the night before and just pop it in the oven when we get home(after letting it come to room temperature of course).  Thanks for the recipe.

Made for Jake's confirmation and was pretty pleased with it.  I used 1 lb ground sausage and 1 lb bacon and about 2 cups potatoes.

This was awesom, I just made this for my boyfriend's farewell brunch, and he loved it, I followed the recipe for 6 servings, as we're just 2 persons. I had to change the cheese because as I'm from Mexico, I couldn't find Cheddar, so I used Chihuhua cheese, and it came out perfect.
Thanks a lot for this recipe. *w*

Perfect for any meal. I switched out the onions for green scallions. I did not let it sit overnight. I used fresh Italian bread in big slices for the base...then tore it up with my fingers for the topping. I used baby yukon gold potatoes (microwaved for speed);they are sweet. I browned the potatoes and ham together for extra flavor. I halved the dry mustard, my family is not a fan of mustard in any form.  The final custard is moist and well set. Reheats well in the microwave...don't over heat it, it will dry out.

Outstanding! I think the worcestershire really makes this dish. I bought a thick ham steak and cut good sized cubes. For the potatoes I used the OreIda hash brown diced potatoes-just tossed them in frozen; very easy. This made  a lot of servings, and we have gotten about 5 servings out of it (between 3 of us). It's so nice to be able to simply reheat a great breakfast.

People loved this, kids and adults alike. It was a bit of work upfront with cooking the bacon and ham etc, but the payoff in the AM was great! We did double the potatoes since we had them. Next time I'll try different bread like people suggsted. I didn't think it tasted heavy at all. Total crowd pleaser.

This strata was flavorful and moist.  It gets better each day.  I adjusted the recipe to my personal taste.  I chopped up a pound of bacon.  I drained off all the fat except 1 tbsp. for sautéing the ham and 1 medium onion.  I used ¾ bag of shredded Potatoes O’Brien (found in the refrigerated section).  I added ¼ tsp of ground black pepper, ½ tsp of salt, and 5 drops of Tobasco sauce to the egg mixture.  I layered the bread, cheese, shredded potato and half the meat mixture, and repeated the layer again instead of having the meat mixture only in the center (top it off with cheese).  I did not have time to let it sit overnight so I baked it immediately at 350 for 60 mins. (turned off the oven at 50 mins. and let it sit in the oven for 10 mins).  If I could, I'd give it 4.5 stars. It was delicious but too much meat and fattening.

Prepared this the night before, then baked this morning for my "mexican domino's group" and it was a huge hit! Had to pass on the recipe. I didn't change anything, but did add "mushrooms".

This is probably one of the best brunch casseroles I've ever had. I made it first around Thanksgiving and have made it twice since. One of the best things about it is that you can prepare it the night before. Makes things a lot easier to have the main dish made ahead of time. Works with sourdough bread too.

I made this for Christmas morning....EVERYONE except me woke up w/ the flu, the roads were icy and family couldn't make it over SO...I was the only one to eat it that morning and it was wonderful.  Baked it in a stoneware dish so it stayed nice and hot outside the oven until I wa ready to eat.  Another great plus about this recipes is that it reheats extremely well!  My family enjoyed the leftovers the next morning and my father-in-law who is not one to compliment anything, raved about it!  Can easily be made for a smaller family on a weekend morning, then reheated on a weekday morning for a quick breakfast.

This worked as well as I hoped.  I added a bunch of asparague and a chopped red bell pepper.  Instead of bread and potatoes, I used a bag of hash browns.  Next time, I'll add tarragon.

I loved this recipe, although I did make some changes. I used sausage instead of bacon and ham. I cooked the onion with  the potatoes. I was worried about the ratio of eggs to milk, but it worked. The baking dish didn't fill to the top with the mixture so after cooking for about 70 minutes it was a bit crunchy on top. I think that helped with the overall texture. Definitely will make a again.

This is excellant! Cooked for the first time last weekend for a group of 60 and it was a big hit. Second day I added bell pepper, as I had some that needed to be used, but let your imagination run wild!

My entire family (immediate, extended, in-laws, etc.) All LOVE this recipe.  Its great left over too!  Using an asiago bread and asiago cheese instead of white bread and cheddar cheese can also "grow-up" the recipe a bit and is quite delicious!  Bake and then slice and arrange in foil muffin papers and you can serve it at a breakfast meeting/presentation......for those guys who just don't want one more bagel and cream cheese!

I brought this in for my co-workers this morning and it was a hit!  I only used 8 pieces of bread, because it was all I had on hand and it turned out just fine.  I made the casserole the night before, and popped it in the oven without pre-heating (so I could go back to sleep:).  From pre-heat to done it took 70 minutes.  I was skeptical bc so many said it took longer than that to cook, but mine was perfectly done in 70 minutes!  This is a GREAT crowd-pleaser!

We make this for anytime we are having overnight guests.  It is excellent with the portions of everything.  Do not add any extra liquid.  As it cooks, the eggs and milk cover everything.  The only thing is that the prep is a little bit long but definitely worth it!

Used jalapeno cheese bread instead of the white bread, otherwise following the recipe exactly.  I loved it, but my family did not.  Kids aren't thrilled with the casserole type presentation.  They would prefer to have each item individually served.  Husband likes it, but it isn't his favorite.

This recipe had too much bread in it.  I used whole wheat bread instead of white so maybe that was the issue.  Next time Ill choose another recipe.

This was sadly not what I had hoped for.  The baking time was way off, as others had hinted at.  I let it cook for nearly 100 minutes after letting it sit on the counter for an hour, and the middle was still mushy while the top was dry.  The bread made it all very soggy and ruined the texture.  But I do admit that the flavor was good. If I were to make this again, I would reduce the amount of milk and omit the bread.  Instead of bread I would add more potatoes (hashbrowns for me).

I made it for christmas morning.  Made it the night before so all I had to do was pop it in the oven while we opened our gifts.  The only thing I did different was grounded up some sausage to add with the ham and bacon.  My family loved it!
