If I did this right, (I'm blind and using a screen reader) I've rated this recipe five stars. I made this cake for a memorial service that was held at my church. It went together in a snap. It was so moist, it didn't need a glaze. I followed the directions exactly, and got a delicious cake I don't feel needs any modifications.

My daughter and I just made this, and it's absolutely fantastic! We saved the pineapple juice and added it to the icing we made to top it off. Perfect!

I wasn't sure if my husband would like a cake without frosting, but he loved it! It is a moist cake with interesting combination of flavors. A five star for the taste and being so easy to make.

I had to make some changes to this recipe.  First, I didn't have yellow cake mix so I used white. Second, I used almost an entire can of crushed pineapple w/juice and didn't add the oil. I totally forgot to add in the allspice.  Overall it came out kind of like a moist chocolate chip cookie that was pineapple flavored.  It was good, but I think next time I'd leave out the chocolate chips and instead add in marachino cherries and coconut and some walnuts.

Happy 7-7-07! Made a '7-up' cake for breakfast at 7am, hahaha, right? Wish I could give it 7 stars! This was good! I would like to try a different cake mix with it---maybe chocolate? My son liked the chocolate chips in it and the yellow cake mix hid the pineapple, so maybe chocolate wouldn't work. Thanks for the post!

Wow, this came together so easy and was really moist! I put in extra pineapple for more flavor which helped because the pineapple flavor is very light (might try a pineapple cake mix next time).  It does seem to be crumbly while still being moist(?) and that makes it a little tough to get out of the pan but well worth the effort. I made a version of the pineapple party topping from this site to frost-Delish!

I think this is a very refreshing cake.  No icing needed.  I did modify just because I needed to use what I had on hand.  I used Diet 7 Up and I think it was plenty sweet.  I also used a pineapple upside down cake mix because I did not have a yellow cake mix.  I will make this again and probably omit the choc. chips next time.  They are definitely not needed.  This would be great paired with some fresh bananas and strawberries.

I have to agree with Jenelle D. I think this cake would taste much better by omitting the chocolate chips, and adding coconut, and marachino cherries. I made the recipe exact and I don't think 1/2 cup pineapple is enough. I was disappointed but may try again with a little different ingredients. It was very easy to make. That was a plus, with a few adjustments, it may turn out to be a wonderful cake.

Nice cake but very crumbly.  Mine was difficult to cutinto nice portions because it was falling apart. Presentation was so great but the cake tasted super!   I omitted chocolate and added shredded coconut and maraschino cherries instead.  Very tasty combination of flavors.  My family really enjoyed this.

I made this with Sprite. Added coconut, sliced almonds and marachino cherries. Loved the taste and so easy. BUT, sooo crumbly.
