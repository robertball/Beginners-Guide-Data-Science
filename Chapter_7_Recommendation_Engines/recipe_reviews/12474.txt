I make this all the time and it always turns out GREAT. I change it a bit though; I reduce the Sour cream by 2 tablespoons, use 2 large or even 3 medium size apples, used 1/4 cup brown sugar, and reduced the butter in the struesal to two heaping tablespoons. I also add a little brown sugar to the top of it. To keep the crust from burning, I wrap the pie loosely in foil, cutting open the top so steam can escape and the pie can bake  evenly w/o a overly brown crust.

Use less sugar for the filling and only about half of the sugary topping and this pie will turn out great!! It is very easy to make and tastes delicious (looks great too!). I also used real vanilla bean instead of the vanilla extract.

excellent and delicious!!!!!! the sour cream filling made the difference in this delicious pie.  i'm not that great of a baker, so i used a store bought, refridgerated pie dough, which made assembly a snap.  the second time i made this i used 6 medium sized apples(2 different varieties for added interest) and the pie was a lot biger and still awesome.  great recipe.

I made this pie for the girls at work.  The pie was tasteless but the topping went over very well. Everyone liked the topping but overall they didn't care for this recipe.

This was one of the best apple pies I've ever had.  I had guests over and they loved it too.  I used brown sugar in the topping and needed more flour so to spice the topping up, I added a bit of cinnamon.  But otherwise perfect!

This Apple Pie was/is the only apple pie my husband will eat.  He hates apple pie.  Our friend made this for us when we went to her house for dinner.  At first the sour cream seemed like a weird thing to put in apple pie, but it made it so creamy and yummy. It is sweet, but good. Not your traditional apple pie. I'm going to have to make it myself.

Hands down the best apple pie I have ever made!  Yummy!!!! I have made it twice and will make it many times.  I did double the amount of apples called for.  Other than that I followed the recipe.  My boyfriend and I just about ate the whole pie in 1 sitting.  (minus 2 pieces).  The day after he asked me to make it again.

I made this recipe recently for my daughter's family.  To my surprise, my 15 year old granddaughter whose birthday we celebrate on Easter Sunday requested this recipe as she fell in love with it.

Great, easy recipe, the topping eliminates the need to make a top crust.

This pie needs a little tweaking.  I use 3 generous cups of diced apples and add extra spice - I put 1 teaspoon of cinnamon in the sour cream mix and another teaspoon of cinnamon in the crumb topping.  I use brown sugar instead of white for both the pie and the topping.  And I bake it for 45 minutes at 300 degrees then check to see if the apples are soft before I put the topping on.  With those changes this is one of our favorite pies.

Kudos on this one. My family and friends don't want any other kind of apple pie from me again. I did however make a brown sugar crumble topping instead of the one called for.

I have made this several times. it's always a hit. although I do the crumble differently. I use quick oats and brown sugar with the butter.

Simply delicious.  I have made this pie twice now in two days, second time I made it bigger.

I made two small changes...first I added cinnamon to the apples and the topping I made more of a crumble by adding oats and changing sugar to brown sugar.
The filling really is the star of this show as it tastes like an apple cheesecake.
Definitely a keeper. Thanks for sharing.

The texture and degree of firmness  was perfect.  I used  two crusts, only because I'd just made a crumb-topped pie a few days before!  I found it rather bland, but my husband (who wants everything unseasoned) enjoyed the flavor.  I made the  filling recipe as written--but next time I will add a little butter and cinnamon.  I also think this pie would be great using pears.
I baked at 350 not 300, because I like a crisp crust with some color.
