Good recipe, with one suggestion..if you use Jiffy cornbread mix, it is sweet enough without adding the extra 1/4 cup of sugar.  Since we love onions, I think I will add some minced onion when I make it again.

Good somewhat plain but you can easily incorporate different  veggiies and maybe even ham instead of chicken the crust on top was good but did need more time in the oven

Everyone in the family liked this.  The only thing I did differently was to make the cornbread from scratch as I had no Jiffy mix.  It did take an extra 15 minutes for the cornbread to get done.

Not my favorite.  It was kinda bland and dry.  I sauteed the corn in butter and salt and pepper to try and add some extra flavor and also added green beans.  If I were to make again I would add some sour cream to the mashed potatoes and maybe some cheddar cheese.  I think I would try omitting the corn bread.  It made a ton, so we will be having it tomorrow for leftovers:(

So delicious! The only changes I made, was that I didn't add the sugar to the cornbread, and I added a can of green chiles to the chicken. Phenominal!
