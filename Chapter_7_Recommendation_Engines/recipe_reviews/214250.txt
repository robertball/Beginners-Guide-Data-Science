I was looking for something light with chocolate and caramel goodness.  I decided to try this recipe and make one pudding layer chocolate and one layer caramel.  I also used Caramello as my candy bar.  My was this exactly what I was looking for!  Instead of stirring in the candy pieces to the cream cheese layer, I would place the candy chunks where you want them so they don't clump together.  (I originally tried to make homemade caramel pudding and it was a disaster.  So in the end I used one box of vanilla pudding and added 2 &1/2 tablespoons of caramel sundae sauce.  It tasted exactly how I was hoping.)

This was very yummy. My family, who loves dessert all agreed it was very good. Not to light and not to heavy. I gave it 5 stars based on following the exact directions, not changing anything. I think next time I might like to try oreos in place of the candy bars. Very good and easy, thanks for sharing!
