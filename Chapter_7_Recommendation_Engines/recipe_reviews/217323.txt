This was absolutely delicious.  Thank you for sharing.  I omitted the fresh basil (didn't have any at the time).   I cooked the salmon fillets in aluminum foil packets at 425 degrees for 12 minutes (my husband doesn't like the smell of fish cooking).  The salmon was tender and flavorful.  We'll definitely be making this again.

My husband and daughter both really liked this salmon. They said the flavour of the marinade was excellent. We grilled this instead of sauteeing it and it worked well. Thanks!

Followed the recipe exactly with the result being one of the best tasting salmon dishes I have ever had. I did sprinkle some salt on each filet just prior to grilling. I made double the marinade and used it for broccoli that I also grilled. That was paired with with dill rice for a very memorable meal. Easy and delicious, will definitely go into the rotation.

Really lovely flavour. I've made it twice - both times substituting normal white wine (6 tbsp) for the mirin and sake, which I did not have on hand. I baked the salmon in the entire marinade and used the sauce over some sesame broccoli and couscous. Very good. A new regular.

The marinade was amazing!  I was worried it would be too strong when I tasted some of it directly, but the end result was a subtle, creamy, savory taste that blended perfectly with the fish, with just a hint of sweetness.  My kids loved it!  Served really well with some steamed kale and rice on the side.

The problem I can think of is that some of the ingredients are a little pricey to buy just for making this dish once (sake, miso, mirin, etc.).  But I generally have those around, so it wasn't a problem.

I am so glad that I found this recipe!  It tasted great!  I didn’t make any changes to the main ingredients, but had to leave out the basil garnish since I didn’t have it on hand.  I was only able to marinate the salmon in the fridge for an hour instead of 2 so I can only imagine how much tastier it would be!  Also, I ended up cooking it in parchment as that’s how I like to cook my fish.  This recipe is definitely going into the regular rotation.

Easy as pie, and twice as delicious! I did it sans sake since I didn't have any on hand, or basil for that matter and I baked it instead. It's a no-fuss feast!
