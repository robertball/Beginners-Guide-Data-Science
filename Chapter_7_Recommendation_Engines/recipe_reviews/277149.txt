yum!  I used the Pepperidge Farm Cornbread Stuffing Mix and wanted to use it up so I searched for recipes to make.  This is a keeper for us.  The are not as filling due to the lighter cheese mixture and not having the bisquick.  I served them to friends and family beside the bisquick version I've been making for years.  I didn't have any of these left.  :)
