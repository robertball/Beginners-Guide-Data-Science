Delicious!  The combination of sardine, dressing and mint was refreshing.  I would have appreciated more guidance on how to prepare the sardines, however.  Removing the heads was easy, but it took a few mangled fish before I realized that you can remove the backbone by (a) cutting the fish open along full length of belly, i.e. butterflying the fish, (b) carefully lifting the backbone by lifting it gently, starting with the tail, then (c) folding the fish back up before frying.  Once I had all that figured out, the rest was a piece of cake!

Very tasty. A flag went up when I saw mint(???) in the ingredients but have no fear. It all works together very well (I kept everything warm in the oven on the platter after adding the vinegrette and shredded mint). Still recognizble sardine taste. By the way, those fresh (frozen) sardines cost me $2.80 at the local oriental market..

Really tasty- was my first go at preparing raw sardines. Only warning is that my boyfriend couldnt handle the smell of the sardines cooking :( They were delicious, but he wouldnt/couldnt even try them!

Followed the recipe to the letter and although this was a very nice dish I felt it called for a bit too much vinegar.  I think I will only use a 1/2 cup next time.

I liked this  for an entree.  I like vinegar very much, but will use a little less the next time.   Salt & pepper wasn't mentioned, presumably it was meant to be in the flour.  I however put  the seasoning onto the cooked fish.  Can't understand NJbruce.  Flags because of the mint(?), nor why it was kept warm until eating.  Strange!!
