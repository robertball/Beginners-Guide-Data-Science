This was really a snap to put together.  I know the recipe calls for chopping the red peppers and adding at the end, but to hide them from my children (who wouldn't eat this if they saw peppers) I dumped all the ingrediens (except parsley) in the food processor.  The taste is wonderful, it reminded me of the pimento cheese spread thats so wonderful and costly... ALL my kids loved this and I can see this would be equally delicious rolled in chopped pecans.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a good cheese ball.  After I added all listed ingredients (Except the nuts to roll the ball in) I found something lacking.  There was no Zip.  So I added 1/2 teaspoon of Dijon Mustard.  WOW  What a great difference.  That is why I am giving this recipe 4 stars.

The only one of its kind on this site and it's magnifico! I'm surprised more people haven't tried this.  Previous reviewers are right; it's better with increased amounts of cayenne, garlic, and my own personal preference, a touch more Worchestershire sauce.  I also took the advice from the reviewer who added some dijonnaise.  I added about a teaspoon.  I let my food processor do the work and found that it was much easier to form into a more presentable ball after it had been chilled for at least an hour.  Then, I coated it in slivered almonds and it looked soooooo beautiful!  The almonds helped with the ball formation as I was coating it; it provided a "wall" of sorts, holding everything together.  Thanks so much for the recipe - I can't wait to serve it tomorrow!

Per another reviewer's suggestion, I added 2 tsp of the roasted red pepper juice.  I tried the dip before and after adding the juice, and I definitely recommend adding it!  In fact, I will add 1 T or more next time.  Like others, I threw everything in the food processor and pulsed until smooth.  I got many many compliments, and even a couple of requests for the recipe!  I wasn't a huge fan of the fresh parsley, though...my suggestion is to either chop it SUPER fine, or to use nuts instead.

This was a real hit at work, and it's great spread on a tortilla, rolled up and cut like pinwheels.

I made this for an anniversary party and had lots of great comments about it!  I didn't have cayenne pepper on hand, so I used a couple of dashes of Tabasco. I also used the shredded Mexican 4-cheese blend (my personal fav) instead of shredded Cheddar.  This has a taste similar to pimiento cheese, so to make sure it had more of a cheese ball taste, I added a little minced onion, seasoned salt, and large spoonful of Dijonaise (Dijon mayo-blend).  I'd refrigerate overnight to ensure the flavors meld.  It's such a pretty cheese ball, next time I might not roll in nuts or parsley! The recipe is definitely a keeper.

Wonderfully easy recipe!  I "borrowed" from other reviewer's comments and doubled the amount of spices, added 2 tsp. of the pepper juice, and rolled the ball in chopped pecans.  Next time, I'll roll it in parsley and the nuts.  Try to make this the night before so that all the flavors can combine overnight.

This was delicious!!!  I pretty much doubled all of the spices though - you can basically just test it and keep adding spices to suit your taste.  Served w/ Wheat Thins crips (garden veggie flavor) and Trader Joe's everything crackers.  YUM!

This cheese ball's red and green colors make it perfect for the holidays...I made it for a Christmas Eve party and it was a hit.  Use light cream cheese to cut down on the fat.

Lovely cheese ball!  I have made this several times and almost always someone asks me for the recipe.  It makes a very big recipe, so my tip is to make it around the holidays, and divide it into two balls.  Then take one to the office party and one to the family or friend get-together.  The green parsley and red pepper make a great seasonal combination!  Oh, and I always use chopped garlic instead of powdered.  I gives it a little extra kick.

This is a great cheese ball, have made it many times.  I omit the rolling in the parsley at the end but add some to the mixture so you still get the green.  Looks great and taste great!

I needed something last minute to take to a party.  I had everything this called for so I mixed it all in the food processor.  I did alter it a tiny bit.  Since the recipe didn't specify what size of a jar for the roasted red peppers, I used about 1/2 cup.  One of my blocks of cheese was 1/3 less fat.  Also, I left out the worcestershire because I was in too big of a hurry to find it in my cubbard.  I also threw in a teaspoon of dried parsley (more for look than flavor).   The consistency of mine came out to be a very spreadable cheese that wouldn't hold shape so I just served it in a pretty dish.  Everyone loved it!  I will definitely make this again.  It was delicious.

This was a hit at Christmas dinner! I made just  a few minor adjustments. I added 2 tbsp of hot sauce, some fresh cilantro and a dash of liquid smoke (JUST A DASH). Rolled in freshly chopped parsley the night before and served the next day.

This was very good but it made such a large amount I couldn’t see myself putting a cheese ball on the coffee table the size of a soccer ball! LOL!  I divided it in half, rolled one in parsley and the other with chopped walnuts.  Next time I am going to use the whole jar of roasted peppers and throw in some curry powder as well.  This would be perfect to serve in small crocks as well.  Thanks for sharing!

I actually didn't try this when I made it for a recent party. I was really busy getting everythig ready, but my guests loved it! Didn't roll it in anything and it actuallly looked pretty good since it had the pretty red specks of roasted red pepper. Thanks!

This is a wonderful, flavourful cheeseball.  I've made it several times, but always with peppers I have roasted myself.  I used another reviewer's suggestion and added a DASH of liquid smoke (because we like the smokey flavour).  I get requests for this all the time and it has become one of our favourite appetizers.  Thanks for sharing!

Made a half recipe and everyone loved it.  I used about 1/4 cup of diced roasted red pepper, light cream cheese and Italian parsley. It was a tad soft for rolling (perhaps because of the light cream cheese) so I put the parsley on the plastic wrap and added more to the top during molding.  Personally I thought it needed a touch more cayenne and a bit of salt (or more worcestershire sauce) but my family loved it the way it was.

2011  I made this for Thanksgiving for some guests who always serve store bought cheese balls at their house. They absolutely could not believe it was homemade. I followed the recipe exactly, but I did roll it in chopped roasted pecans. I got requests to serve it again next time!    Update 11/2015   After all these years I am still making it again this year for our Holiday Get Togethers! Still love it!

What a favorful recipe.  I wanted to try this out on the hubby before bringing to a food day at work.  Seeing how quickly he gobbled it down, I had to try myself before he licked the bowl clean.  So savory, so delish.  I did make a slight alteration and added a 1/4 tsp of seasoned salt.  Also, I did not roll this into a ball.  I just used a spread.  I can't wait to share this with the girls at work.

Was so good but I goofed and read the recipe as using the whole jar of peppers.  It turned out delicious with all of the peppers.  Excellent mistake

I took this to a family gathering and, even though it was one-upped by my sister-in-law's tortilla rollups, everyone still loved it. I served it with multigrain crackers and wheat thins. I also upped the seasoning a bit and added some smoked paprika. Delish!

This is fantastic!  I took advice of others and added about a tsp of dijon mustard and also some smoked paparika.  I also added a couple of tbsps. of the roasted pepper juice.  Instead of rolling in nuts or parsley, I rolled it in finely shredded colby jack cheese.  I did put it in the refridgerator for about an hour before forming the ball and it worked great!  I would definitely make this again!

I fed this to my parental units (Dad and his friend were doing work in my house, Mom was hanging with me) - THEY LOVED IT!!!!!!  I did TOO!!!!  Within like 15 minutes it was half-gone.  This recipe DOES make a HUGE cheese ball - but that's OK.  Just enough kick to taste it, but not overpowering.  YUM YUM!  Thanks very much!

I've made this half a dozen times and everyone loves it. I add about a tsp of dijon, as others suggested, and prefer it rolled in nuts.

Very good cheese ball.  I made for Thanksgiving and got rave reviews -- even from my vegetarian friends.  Did as others suggested and added a bit of horseradish.  I also added a few chopped, toasted pecans into the mixture, and then rolled the ball in more chopped/toasted pecans mixed with the chopped parsley.  Made for a beautiful presentation.  Thanks for the recipe!!

This was good.  I cut the recipe in half but didn't reduce the red peppers- still used 1/3 cup.  I mixed everything together in the food processor so the red peppers got blended and the cheese ball was a pinkish/orange color.  I liked how the flavor was blended throughout.  This was good, but I think something was missing, perhaps some fresh chives would have been good to add some of that slight onion flavor.  But still really good!

This is a good cheeseball recipe when you follow the tips of other reviews!  I have made it 3 times and everyone ate every bite of it.  I doubled the amount of garlic & W.Sauce, added 1 tsp. dijon mustard and 1/2 Tbsp. of jarred red pepper juice, blended everything in my food chopper and let the flavors blend overnight in the fridge. Yum!

I agree with others when it comes to using the food processor and using more than the recommended dose of spices.  In addition, refrigerating this prior to forming is a VERY good idea.  I just threw the mixture in a bowl overnight and formed it in the morning.  It makes it MUCH easier to form.  Another suggestion when forming the ball, get your hands slightly wet and put the entire mixture in your hands to form it.  The water on your hands will prevent it from sticking and I was able to form a PERFECT ball this way.  Enjoy!

Loved this!  I cut the recipe in half and I refrigerated the mixture over night before shaping into a ball the next day and served with wheat crackers.

I agree with others in that this needed an extra little oomph.  Rather than adding dijon, I opted for horseradish...and it was GREAT!  It gave just the amount of bite to balance the sweetness of the roasted red peppers.  I threw everything in the food processor, which resulted in a tasty but not so eye-appealing yellow spread.  Next time, I will definitely mix by hand so that you can see all of the wonderful colors of the individual ingredients.

This was an easy cheese ball that was a big hit with my kids.  I did add the dijon and garlic but I also added a dash of garlic ginger sauce and it gave it quite a punch.  We had it on "munchy night" and also had a pepper jelly spread and all the flavors went well together.  My husband toasted some on oat nut bread and it was a great hot spread.

This was a very good recipe and as long as you drain the roasted peppers it's not too hard to roll into a ball.  Next time I would refrigerate the mixture for about 10-15 minutes before rolling it, I think that would make the job much easier.  Also very good when you accidently add way more cayenne i used 1/2 tsp. thinking the recipe called for a full tsp., but it turned out tasty all the same.  Thanks for sharing, I never knew these were so easy to make.

I had a hard time making this. It turned out really runny and the ball didn't want to keep its shape. It still tasted good. I just served it as a dip rather than a ball. Next time I will make sure to drain the red peppers.

This was great! I used more garlic salt, cayenne, and roasted red peppers than the recipe called for, but I loved it! I also rolled it in fresh cilantro instead of parsley because I like cilantro more and I had alredy chosen to make mine a bit spicier, so I though cilantro would give it a good kick and it did. Try this recipe, you'll like it!

This was my very first cheese ball, and it was a hit! Everyone at work loved it, even the guy who stated he didn't like cheese balls. I did tweak it a bit, having read the prior reviews so I added 1tbp of spicy brown mustard and rolled it in a combination of toasted almonds and parsley. This recipes is definitely a keeper.

Had this for a party and thought it was awesome.  I used homemade roaster peppers so the amount I put in was probably a little more than what was called for.  I prepared it in a food processor and everything blended well.  The hardest part was rolling it in the parsley.  Will definitely make again!

I thought this was awesome. My "pinch" of cayenne was more like 1/4 teaspoon and I increased the garlic powder as well.  I didn't use as much parsley as this called for.  This makes a very nice cheese ball (or egg at Easter time).  Everyone loved it!  Thank you April!

Mine did not turn out to be a "ball" shape, so I put it in a 1.5 qt dish.  I also added more roasted red peppers.  Also, the parsley ended up IN my dip instead of rolling parsley over it as I could not form the ball.  I got great response from everyone that tried it.  Very tasty.

Giving it 5 stars with modifications as others suggested - double seasonings (including Worcestershire sauce, for me), added tbsp of red pepper juice, and 1 tsp of dijon mustard. I think I added a bit more red pepper - maybe 1/2 cup. I drained it well, but then added in the additional juice. I just threw it all in food processor, and added a tbsp or two of parsley. Instead of forming a ball and rolling it in parsley, I just put it in a decorative bowl and let it sit overnight. Very, very delicious - my favorite cheese ball, hands down.

I added about a half tablespoon of Dijon mustard and a little extra garlic.  Chopped up walnuts finely and rolled ball in them instead of parsley. 
This was a very large cheese ball but every bit of it was devoured at our gathering.

This cheese ball is great and easy to make.  I used chili powder instead of the pepper.  It is really good with Wheat Thins crackers.

Fantastic!  I served this at book club and everyone loved it!  My family loved the leftovers!  I added the Dijon mustard as other reviewers suggested, and more garlic.  Probably best to make a day or so ahead, and coat with parsley the day you are serving.  I found with each passing day, the flavor improved!  Delicious, a keeper!

This was my first attempt at a cheeseball and it turned out great!...with a few modifications...  I tasted it as I mixed and did add at least 50% more of each of the seasonings.  I wish I had seen the previous review about dijon mustard, I'm sure that would have added a lot and if I make this again, I will try it.  I froze these in a shaped mini-bundt pan that looked like a rosette lined with plastic wrap, then thawed before serving and sprinkled with dried parsley - lovely presentation!

Really tasty- I just about tripled the pepper because that was the best part.  The problem was that mine would not stay in a ball. It would make a great soft spread/dip though, so maybe next time I'll just put it in a dish and not bother with reattempting the ball.

Wow, brought it to work and got rave reviews. I made it a cheese spread instead of a ball just for portability issues (so instead of shaping it I scooped it into tupperware). Only changes (other than the shape) were:
1)as another reviewer reccomended, used a Mexican 4 cheese mix
2) added a little extra pepper and garlic.

De-Lish!

Very Good (let it set overnight if you can).  Seemed to be missing something though. . .
