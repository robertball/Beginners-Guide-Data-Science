I've tried a lot of Ranch dressing recipes and this one was quick easy and great on our chicken wings and salad.  Best one I've tried so far.

I was expecting this to taste like Uncle Dan's or other bottled dressing.  I made this recipe when I ran out of bottled dressing and I didn't like it at all.

This wis good, but I wouldn't call it ranch. More like a dilly dip.

Use half the dill and a bit more oregano. Also, I'd say there's too much garlic, so I'd do half and then add the same amount onion powder, or some more chives.

I increased the the spices and used fresh ( triple the amount of dry spices) and that made all the difference.

The flavor of this dressing was fantastic, but the consistancy was closer to a veggie dip than salad dressing.  Next time I will add an extra 1/3 cup of buttermilk or buttermilk/milk mixed.  Very tasty dressing though.

This dressing is yummy, however, it doesn't taste like ranch to me!  Would give another recipe a try before I made this again.  On the positive side, it is easy and quick to make!

This was a very great ranch dressing. Although i did add a little more to it like, sugar, onion powder, and some extra seasoning. It is a great dressing for hot wings and baked potatoes

This is really good.  I only added 1/2 T of worcestershire and didn't have white pepper!  Very yummy!

I really like this.  I am not a fan of dill, so I just left it out.  I love that tangy  taste that the parmessan gives it.  No, it is not like store bought "Ranch" dressing.  I think it is better.  I have been doubling the recipe (leaving out the buttermilk) and storing it as a dip.  When I want a dressing, I just add some of the buttermilk to thin it.  I have also added (for a dip) a 10 oz. package of frozen chopped spinach that has been thawed and the excess liquid squeezed out.  Oh yeah, I use lite mayo and fat free yogurt to lower the fat content and add some onion powder and half the Worcestershire sauce.  I do suggest people make it a day in advance so all the flavors blend.  I will make this again and again.  I love finding new recipes I like so I do not have to purchase manufactured items that contain too much fat, salt, often sugar, and chemicals.

I love Ranch dressing, but am not crazy about the bottled, mass-produced stuff and have been looking for a good recipe to make at home.  Unfortunately, this wasn't it.  To me this did not taste anything like a Ranch dressing.  I made the recipe as is and all I could taste was the Worcestershire Sauce, even after letting it sit awhile to let the flavors blend...I even tried adding more buttermilk, spices, garlic powder and onion powder and it was still way too overpowering with the taste of Worcestershire.  The recipe called for 1 tablespoon of it, but I wonder if it shouldn't read as 1 teaspoon. Also, the oregano and parmesan cheese didn't seem to blend very well with the rest of the ingredients.  To me it was more like a twist on Caesar dressing than Ranch dressing.  Sorry, I just wasn't impressed with this one.

The only variation I made with this recipe was to use fresh dill (1 Tbsp) and fresh parsley (3 Tbsp) and ALL I could taste in the dressing was the pepper. WAY too peppery, WAY too hot and nothing at all like Ranch. I would not make this again.

This recipe is okay but a little complicated! I see that people who are used to bottled Ranch dressing are disappointed. Please read the ingredients label on your bottled dressing! Yes, you're probably eating a lot of artificial ingredients. The ABSOLUTE KEY to fabulous Ranch dressing is Buttermilk POWDER. (I learned about this from Mark Bittman at the NY Times). This can be purchased in the baking section of many supermarkets. 1 cup mayonnaise plus 1/2 cup buttermilk and 1/4 cup buttermilk powder plus salt & pepper. Put that in a jar with a tight fitting lid and and shake for 30 seconds. So simple! You can add 1/4 cup chopped fresh chives or parsley if you like. Also if you start with HOMEMADE mayonnaise which is easy to make with a mini food processor.

Too much Dill. Next time I'll follow other users advice and cut the dill in half. Other than that it's absolutely delicious... much better than anything you'd get at the store.

In my opinion ranch dressing should be creamy smooth, this was not. When I made this I put in WAY too much garlic. It also had a sharp taste. I think I will try a different recipe.

I agree that there was way too much garlic (and I LOVE garlic) and too much worcestershire sauce - i would do a tsp of each rather than a tablespoon.  However, everything else was great!

My family loved is ranch dressing, it's waaaaay better than the store stuff and you can make if with all organic ingredients if you want.   The only thing I did different is, instead of adding all the dry herbs (that don't have very much flavor) I used about 1/4 cup of pesto, it is sooo tasty!

I was making some chicken, bacon, ranch dish one night and ran out of ranch, so I made this and added to what I already had. In that case it was a real life saver. I don't know that I'd use it on salad in place of ranch dressing because it does have a bit more of a dill/veggie dip flavor, but I will probably use this instead of my old veggie dip recipe. We had the leftover dressing with carrots for an after school snack the next day, and it was fantastic that way.  3.5 stars

Instead of sour cream & buttermilk, I used what I had in the fridge--vanilla yogurt--and it was AWESOME with the white pepper! I also used cayenne instead of the hot pepper sauce, as it mixed in as a powder so nicely, & left out the cheese (sheesh, it's already loaded with dairy), dropping the Worcestershire b/c we cannot eat soy. OK, so I changed it a lot, and I LOVED our version on this recipe--nice bite with the cayenne & white pepper. Yum as a dip for carrots, celery, cucumbers, etc. We'll keep it as I altered it. Thanks!

Far too many dried herbs.  Would be good amounts for fresh.  If using dried only add about 1/3 of said amount.

I simplified this, just using 1 part mayo, 1 part buttermilk, chives, parsley, pepper and a dash of hot pepper sauce.  My family loved this on salad.  This is similar to a ranch dressing I have made for years.

I liked this and it was easy to do.  Best of all my husband liked it and he doesnt like buttermilk or sour cream.  I also used fresh herbs as I didnt have some of them dried

I was making the Springtime Pea Salad on this site and accidentally just put in mayo rather than the ranch dressing it called for so I just thought I'd turn the may into ranch dressing using this recipe. It was good but still missing that certain "Hidden Valley" taste (which is probably just chemicals and preservatives).

This was just OK. It was kinda gunky and thin in consistency. The flavor was plus or minus too. I've tried a few other ranch dressings, and those had turned out better. Thank you anyway.

This does not taste like ranch. I did not really care for this. The spices did not blend well together. I will not make again. Thanks anyway.

I wish I had read the reviews before I made it.  I have to agree, WAY too much dill.  Otherwise, it was great!

I didn't have buttermilk but substituted plain yogurt, thinned to buttermilk consistency.   Worked well and I have used this trick with other recipes calling for buttermilk, including biscuits.

This is an amazingly good ranch! I often make it leaving out the buttermilk to get it to more of a dip consistency, and I put it on everything!
