I scaled down the recipe to make just a 1/2 pt. jar of these, using lemongrass instead of lemon.  This is my kind of pickle, not overly sweet, with a spicy flavor!

This is very close to what my grandmother made. Such a treat to taste something that jars the memory back to the good old days. Her's took 4 days to put together. These are very close and do not take nearly as long.

Very disappointing. I followed the recipe precisely.  The flavor is  very nice, like what I remember from 20+ years ago - but my pickles were NOT crisp at all. When I filled my jars with fruit and then added the liquid, I had less than 1 pint. And I had a huge amount of liquid left over - a lot of wasted ingredients in my book.

The flavor was good, but the pickles were not as crisp as I would have liked.  My friend's mom made wonderful watermelon rind pickles, and they were SO crisp and crunchy.  The recipe was also a fair amount of work.  Probably won't make it again.
