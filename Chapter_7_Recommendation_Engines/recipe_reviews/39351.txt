Very, very good.  I'm not a big fan of alcoholic beverages, but I enjoyed this drink.  My blender is really bad so I had a hard time getting 1/2 a cup of crushed ice. Enjoyed it anyway! My husband, whose not fond of tropical drinks had 2 servings.  He added lots of pineapple chunks to his. Adding the cream gave this an excellent texture.  Can't wait to make this for company. Thanks Geekhousewife.

I tried this recipe this weekend (minus the cream) and it was great.  My boyfriend and I really enjoyed our home made coladas.  Thanks!

MMMMM is all I have to say about that!! No but really, it was really good!! I dont drink and thought I would give it a try so I tried it.  I used Malibu rum, and I couldnt find coconut cream so I used coconut milk instead and it was oh so yummy!!  I dont like liquere so this was perfect because I couldnt taste nothing but the coconut and pineapple!!  The only problem was that it went down so nicely it was gone so fast and I had to make another one!!  Thanks!!

This didn't turn out too well. But then I probably drank too much Classic Spanish Sangria before trying to make it!

Never thought trying to duplicate Juanâ€™s award Pina Coladas from Cuba, would be so difficult.
