I really enjoyed this recipe. As a Quebecer I must say it was authentic.  Simple, tasty, quick and it reminds me of home

AWESOME recipe!! Only downfall is that it doesnt taste nearly as yummy the next day. I changed mine a little. Like any cake recipe, I creamed the butter and sugar first and then added the egg. I then added 2 tsp vanilla extract. I also added 3 tsp ground cinnamon to the flour mixture which gave it great flavor. I decreased the brown sugar to 1 3/4 and still found the sauce a bit sweet. I added extra vanilla to the brown sugar sauce too. I might try adding apples next time. Over all, great recipe but must finish entire thing :)

Really easy and fast recipe. I used unsalted butter instead of margarine as it is healthier. Comes out really rich, but according to my brother who is the one who was really craving pudding chomeur, it is less rich than the one made with maple syrup he had at a restaurant. The cake part was not quite as good and gewy as the one he had at the restaurant, but still very moist and syrupy on the bottom. His sweet tooth was nicely satisfied so was the sweet tooth of everyone else at the gathering! Great quick recipe, thanks!

This recipe was my very first time making a French-Canadian dessert.  Very nice, simple dessert.  Took the advice of another and added some cinnamon and add'l vanilla to the cake batter and decreased the amount of brown sugar in the syrup to 1 3/4 cups and it was just right.  Best served warm with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream.  Thanks for this recipe.

I am so impressed with how great this dish came out considering the few simple ingredients. I did add an equal amount of maple extract since I read that the traditional version of the recipe actually uses maple syrup! Two thumbs up, this is definitely going in my recipe book!

Excellent! Just like we had in Quebec. I divided the batter & liquid  in two and made half in my crockpot, cooked on high for 2 hours. Turned out wonderfully both ways!

Good recipe. I liked the batter, but the sauce was too sugary for me. Although, if I was to make it again I think I would add some cinnamon to the batter.

Wow, this tastes amazing! I used butter instead of margarine and it turned out great. There is a lot of syrup at the bottom of the pan (it sinks during baking), so I'll probably make a bit less next time.

This was Great. I felt it was a light tasting dessert. More of cake than pudding but that could of happen because I felt the sauce was to much and I only pour half of it. I will try it with the entire amount. Supper easy to make! So glad I found this.

This was FABulous!!! Just like the pudding I had at St. Hubert's restaurant in Quebec years ago and never forgot. We used 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup maple syrup and made it with soy milk. Doubled the recipe and served about 22 people with it, getting rave reviews from the entire crowd. MAKE this, you won't be disappointed!!

Loved it and so did the others who had some. Followed the advice of some reviews though and dropped the brown sugar to 1-3/4 cup. Also added some cinnamon to the batter and some maple flavouring to the sauce mix as soon as it was done. Also used cake and pastry flour instead of all-purpose and butter instead of margarine.  Will definitely make again....and again...and again :)

My mother was a French Canadian and this was a regular treat . We called it Maple sugar dumplings. Just pour about a half inch of maple sirup in a cake or pie pan, top with buttered ,egg rich biscuit dough and bake at 350 deg until brown. This is 5 star

This is so easy to make and very good to satisfy your sweet tooth. Only thing different I did was added shredded coconut to the poured liquid. Delicious! Thank you for this recipe as my mom use to make this often when we were kids.

Delicious!! I couldn’t use the oven (Christmas dinner cooking) so decided to attempt this in my instant pot. OMG PERFECT! I used butter instead of margarine and cooked it on high pressure for 20 Minutes, with a natural release (shut it off after cooking, do not leave on “keep warm”). I buttered the instant pot pot, then followed the recipe exactly. It is so yummy... and won’t last long guaranteed.

Sorry.  It posted before I was finished saying I used 1 whole egg, but halved everything else. Turned out nicely, and I sprinkled some cinnamon on top while baking.  Next time I will try adding apples or pecans.

I made it exactly as the recipe said. But cooked the sauce in the microwave instead of on the stove.  It is identical to the dessert served here in Canada at Saint Hubert's Restaurants. The entire family loved it.

This was delicious! I wasn't sure what it exactly was (I've never had it), but it turned out to be basically a butterscotch pudding cake. My family loved it. It was almost gone two hours after I took it out of the oven. I will definitely make this again!

This is very good and very sweet. I think I would reduce the amount of sugar in the batter next time. I used 1-1/2 cup each water and brown sugar and 1/2 cup maple syrup. I used my gluten free flour with good results. Next time I will use less starch and more rice flour.

This was very good, although I have to say I took the recommendation of other reviewers to replace some of the sugar with maple syrup to bring authenticity to the dish.  Next time I'll add even more maple syrup. I also have to say it was quite intimidating to pour all that water over the batter but other than adding the maple syrup, I wanted to follow the recipe exactly. 16 of us totally enjoyed it, though the leftovers looked rather off-putting the next day.

Delicious!  So simple & so good!  I added a bit of cinnamon & nutmeg the second time I made it, for a bit more flavour.  I will make this again & again, it is so fast and I always have the ingredients on hand.

What an interesting dessert! Very comfort food-y.
