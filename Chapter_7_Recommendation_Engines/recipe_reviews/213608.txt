So much easier than preparing it from scratch and with great results!  Loved it, and it was perfect to accompany our crab cakes.  I made no changes, nor will I next time.

I loved this! I used this to dip my Garlic Pita Bread Bites I made from this site and they went very well together. I will say that the resting time is needed because if you don't 'rest' your dip will taste way too much like lemon juice. If you let it sit you won't have that lip puckering lemon tang.

Awesome!  This was just what I was looking for to spread on steak sandwiches - I did use Hellman's light mayo, but other than that I didn't change a thing.  This is fabulous on sandwiches!

This recipe is amazing, great for artichokes, asparagus, as a spread, you name it! Although I never add salt and I accidently did the other night it was awful! Just too much, if you have to have salt in it I would say use half the amount it calls for, but it is great without it.

This was good, but I only used 2 TBSP of the lemon juice and it was STILL too much.  Next time I will cut it down even more.

UPDATE: USED UP LEFTOVERS AS A DIP FOR PLAIN 'OL POTATO CHIPS. THIS WAS GOOD, BUT PARTICULARLY SOUR AFTER SITTING FOR A DAY. DEFINITELY USE FRESH LEMON. I ONLY USE FRESH LEMON NOW AND CAN REALLY NOTICE A DIFFERENCE. I'D ALSO LIKE TO NOTE THAT THIS SPREAD IS PERFECT FOR A-N-Y-T-H-I-N-G!!! USE IT ON STEAK SANDWICHES (I SLATHERED SOME ON TERA'S PHILLY CHEESESTEAK SAMIES), CRAB CAKES, FOR DIPPING FRENCH FRIES - YOU GET THE POINT! Pretty good! Made this to "slather" on Meatball Sandwiches (BIGGUY728). A fast food join my fiance and I frequent makes a GREAT meatball sub. What makes it SOOOOOO yummy is the garlic spread on it. This was perfect for that! I was worried about using 2 1/2 T lemon juice (thought it was a typo), but went with it and am glad I did. It really perks this up! This was so good, I can't WAIT for my next excuse to whip up a batch lol. Thanks for sharing your FANTASTIC recipe, Jeff and Justine! :-)

I roasted my own garlic today so I used that in this recipe. Really, REALLY yummy. I don't think that I could turn back now and use plain mayonnaise again. NOTE: I did use low-fat mayonnaise and fresh lemon juice, not bottled.

I really miss the aioli I used to get at this great Mediterranean restaurant near where I worked when I lived in Cali, but unfortunately I moved to where there is nothing for Greek food...anyway, I decided to try this recipe, and it was very similar, but I would omit the pepper, or use white pepper instead of the black, I think it overpowers other ingredients.

So very easy & PERFECT just the way it is! However, here are some
minor tips: Don't fear the garlic! Add a bit more if you're feeling a little frisky!
Allow the Aioli to marinate for at least an hour to tame the lemon flavor. I only used 1 tbs. since my partner isn't fond of any heavy lemon flavor. Try some dill & cilantro in it if serving it with fish of any kind. Fresh chives are also great in it!
Add some fresh Basil either in it or on the side if you're one of those wimpy ones that whine about the heavy garlic flavor.
In addition to the black pepper, white pepper can give it that extra kick! Then again, like I said folks, this recipe is perfect just the way it's written! Don't waste your precious time making Garlic Aioli from scratch. Sometimes easy & basic is best!

This was really good! I added, as other reviewers had, some crushed red pepper and old bay. I also added some extra lemon juice. It was really good as written, but we like a little more zip with our fondue sauces...thanks for sharing!

This recipe is so simple but good. My nine yr old prepared it by herself. We used this recipe as a dipping sauce for crab cakes. We added a hint of Old Bay seasoning, dry dill weed, and dry parsley, it's important to let it rest in the refrigerator for the flavors to blend.

This is awesome! We use it to dip our yam fries in. My sister-in-law showed me how to smash and spread the garlic in coarse sea salt with the flat of a knife. It makes it a smoother texture, so your not getting chunks of garlic.

Prepared exactly as written with terrific results! I wouldn’t change a change. I chilled the sauce for several hours before serving. This was easy to prepare, simple and perfect with, “My Crab Cakes,” also from this website.

This recipe turned out delicious! I made it the night before I needed to use it so it got to sit way longer than 30 mins. I used really large garlic cloves cause I love garlic flavour and I  omitted the salt. I got to admit, I was skeptical of adding in the lemon juice cause I thought it would give the aioli a tart flavour but it was just fine. I used this on my BLT wrap instead of plain mayo and I don't think I am ever going back! I am already thinking of other uses for this recipe. Thanks for sharing.

This is delicious while you're eating it, but lingering after taste from the raw garlic. I'm going to try it next time with some roasted garlic. Also, the recipe calls for a bit too much lemon juice.

I used 1 1/2 TBSP lime juice instead of lemon, and reduced the amount of garlic because my garlic was very strong-smelling.  I used it as a dip for crab cakes and fresh vegetables.  I think the lime was a very good move... and this was surprisingly delicious, which I didn't expect from a mayonnaise-based sauce!

Waaayyyy too much lemon in this recipe, and extremely overpowering! I found a from scratch ailoi recipe (i.e. making your own with egg yolks and olive oil, not just mayo) at another site that calls for the same amount of lemon juice to be used for a TWO CUP yield. A true aioli should not allow the lemon to overpower all other flavors.

Awesome easy to make Aioli.  I added a dash of season salt and instead of black pepper I added 1/4 tspn of cayenne pepper.  I've also made this using limes and lime zest.  Both are very good. Tastes great on New Orleans Style Shrimp & Oyster PoBoys OR on any seafood sandwich.  This recipe is a keeper.

Very good and so much easier than from scratch.  For health reasons I used half mayo and half Greek Yogurt...a little tart but like everything else in life more garlic fixed it

Absolutely fabulous stuff - so much more flavorful than plain ol' mayo!  This is a particularly good recipe.  I've used something similar in the past as a dip for veggies - doesn't take much to have a big impact - and this is better.  I've used it in anything that uses mayo - potato salad is a particularly good use.  :)  I used this tonight in tuna fish - good stuff.  However, you really do need to like garlic.  Thanks, posters!

I've tried this recipe twice. The first time I followed the recipe exactly and it was too salty. The second time I decided to change it a little.....I used roasted garlic instead of raw, bottled lemon juice instead of freshly squeezed (it's what I had on hand), and I left out the salt. OMG it was so delicious, I had to stop tasting it otherwise there would be nothing left for dinner.

This would be FABULOUS if you cut the salt probably in half.  It went really well with "Lori's Famous Crab Cakes" except it was far too salty.  I will absolutley make this again and cut the salt in half because other than that, the flavors were good!  As a side note, I did use fresh lemon juice.

It's ok but it's not a true Aioli (which all Aioli has a lot of garlic making the title redundant).  I mean if you're looking for a quick, lazy way of doing it (also the mayo makes it particularly bad nutritionally), then this will work.

However, this recipe is good for an artichoke dip.  You can substitute real garlic for garlic powder, omit the salt, and add lots of pepper.  :)

This is wonderful. Do be careful about the amount of lemon - and be sure to use fresh squeezed lemon juice. I love garlic so I add a little more. I use olive oil mayo - we like it better and it has fewer calories. I keep a container of this in my fridge.

This was excellent!  It was very garlicky (which was fine), and a little more runny than I would have liked.  If I made it again, I would probably use a little more mayo, a little less lemon juice and one less clove of garlic.

I used Kraft Mayonnaise with Olive Oil. Olive oil is, after all, at the heart of a traditional aioli recipe. I never add salt to a recipe and I doubt if the little salt substitute I included made much of a difference. I don't recommend cutting down on the lemon juice, but that's just me and I used one teaspoon of mince garlic to equal one clove. This recipe turned out to be much better than any aioli I have purchased anywhere.

I just noticed that I forgot to post a review on this recipe which I made last month.  Served this on AR's Asian Turkey Burger, and it was divine.  It had just the right amount of garlic and lemon flavor, and I wouldn't change a thing.  Thanks Jeff and Justine for this incredibly easy and delicious sauce.

Yummy! I added some sliced green onions because I love onions, but other than that, I made no changes. I served with Lori's Famous Crab Cakes. Thanks for the great recipe!

Tastes great and went well with my crab cakes -- and super easy! I had 3 large cloves of garlic, and the flavor was strong -- which I liked, but if you don't like strong garlic flavor, you may want to use a bit less or smaller cloves. :) The review that says they use it on pieces of pita bread sounds very tasty... maybe that's how I'll use the leftovers. I think it would be great in wraps, too.

Absolutely delicious!!!! We had this with some south western egg rolls and the dip didn't last long!! My sister who hates mayonnaise with a passion devoured  the dip and didn't realize it was made using a mayonnaise base.

Just made this tonight to use as a condiment on my Spicy Italian sandwich. I think it is very good and will definitely make it again. I halved the recipie so there wouldn't be too much leftover. I should have enough for two more large sandwiches.

This is a great recipe plain and simple. Just make sure you are using fresh lemon juice, and let it rest in the fridge for several hours before serving. It is a fantastic dip.

Good easy dipping sauce, I used for crab cakes.  I used the juice from one lemon, a generous teaspoon of minced garlic, omitted the salt and added a couple dashes of Old Bay.  I refridereated for a couple hours before serving to bring out the flavor of the ingrediants.

Very good. I love garlic! I did reduce salt & lemon juice, since my husband & I watch salt, due to high bp. And, he is a little sensitive to citrus. I love the freshness of lemon. Whoever said, it tastes like mayonnaise, that's right; it's suppose to. The title means garlic mayonnaise. I also love mayonnaise. It is the dressing that made my mom's slaw taste so great! Of course, it had other tasty ingredients, as well.

Perfect and so easy!  I made just as recipe stated and  didn't think it was too much lemon at all.  If I had white pepper, I would have used that instead (for presentation), but the black tasted just fine.  Served this with sweet potato fries--yum!

This was pretty good and super easy to make, but very lemony. The lemon flavor is very overpowering.  Next time, I will use only 1 tablespoon and see how it comes out.  I also used 4 cloves of garlic, thinking it needed more, but I think that was too much, so I'll stick with the 3 cloves that the recipe calls for.  I also used light mayonnaise and that worked fine.  We used this as a dip for french fries, but it could be used with lots of different things - tortilla chips, wheat thins, you name it.  I'll try it again with some modifications.

This recipe was great! I tweaked a couple things, I decreased the salt to 1/4t instead of 3/4t and used roasted minced garlic in the jar. It tasted so good, just like the one they serve at the fancy restaurants here in L.A.

We really enjoyed this even my picky kids at it. We made it for a fried cod and fried shrimp night. This would be great on potatoes too. 

I made it as is- loved the flavor. It was better the next day when the flavors had a chance to meld.
Thanks for sharing!

This was good but would have been excellent without the salt or with very little.

VERY GOOD! I wanted a slightly milder flavor, so I used roasted garlic. Also, I just used the salt and pepper according to taste. I served 1/2 as is, and the other 1/2 I added a little prepared horseradish and some sour cream. Both were fantastic! A keeper for sure! Thanks for sharing. :)

This went well with the My Crab Cakes recipe on this site.  I added two extra cloves of garlic since i LOVE garlic...next time I'll stick with the 3 cloves =).  Make sure you let the flavors meld into each other.

Delicious and easy- I do like salt, so the measurements were just fine for me.  Definitely use fresh lemon juice!  I served this with grilled potatoes.

I served this with our steamed artichokes tonight. I preferred it to the egg yolk aioli. I also added a splash of dijon to my serving.  No need to change a thing from written version though.

This was just what I needed. My favorite restaurant burger has garlic aioli, white cheddar, bacon, and grilled onions. I have tried many times to replicate at home with no success until I used this recipe. I scaled it to 2 servings and it was plenty for about 6 burgers. I really mashed the garlic to get it nice and smooth and avoid chunks in the mayo.  It was the perfect consistency and just the right amount of garlic.  Thanks so much!

Not bad, but this is not allioli, this is garlic mayonnaise.

Allioli as it's name suggests is made of garlic and oil alone (all-i-oli means garlic-and-oil in valencian). 
If you want to make allioli you have to grind garlic in a mortar and slowly add oil, so it emulsifies. 
It takes a lot of patience and practice and it has to be freshly prepared so lazy restaurant owners sell garlic mayonnaise to tourists as it is a lot easier to prepare and it can be stored for much longer.

This was only intended to be a constructive review, so you can distinguish between our typical sauce allioli and the fake sauce tourists are given.

As written had too much lemon juice. But with this addition we loved it: added 2 tsp Worcestershire sauce, a tsp horseradish, and a Tbsp Dijon mustard. Broke down that overpowering lemon flavor and made for an amazing gourmet burger topping. (We will do it again with our changes absolutely!!!)

Fantastic recipe - I made my own mayonnaise however, as I recently discovered it is very easy & doesn't have to be as complicated. Place an egg in the bottom of a jar, pour in 1 cup of olive oil (or oil of your choice) & add the other ingredients in for flavour, then get a stick blender, place it at the bottom of the jar & start blending, you will see the mayonnaise forming before your eyes. Only takes a few minutes & tastes devine

Great recipe, my only tip is to add whatever you feel is missing, sometimes I add more lemon, or more mayo, I never measure the salt or pepper I add. Sometimes 3 cloves of garlic are too much and I double the rest of the ingredients.

So, the only thing I did different from the recipe was to add fresh dill. I thought this was really awesome and so did my picky family. I was also pretty excited that this recipe came up on the myfitnesspal app! Served it with sweet potato fries and steak Panini's. Thanks for the great recipe :)

It taste like lemon mayo. I lived in the Med area for a brief period and eat all of my meals in the same restaurant, the Aioli they made was so much different than this. Naturally I did not get the recipe.

Fantastic. I have never cooked or prepared a single thing and am completely skill-less when it comes to any type of cooking or preparing (I had to google how to mince garlic, lol). This was extremely simple to make and came out great. You can adjust the recipe to taste once you make an initial batch and see how it comes out...I finally have something I can say I made myself at family get togethers!

It needs something else... like fresh parsley or something.  Absolutely requires the sitting time in the fridge.  It's good, but only as a spread on a turkey burger or something similar (what I used it for). It is certainly not a dip as mayo comes out as the dominate taste.

Loved this dip! I made slight modifications : used a bit less than 2 tbsp of fresh lemon juice, added about 1/4 tsp of dried dill and added a few dashes of red pepper flakes. Used as a dip with salmon "en croûte" (Ricardo recipe). It's also excellent with raw veggies.

I boiled some small red potatoes to dip in this. My garlic cloves were quite large so next time I would use a bit less. I also "wooshed'" everything together in the vitamix..Yummy Thanks for sharing.

Easy and delicious!  Used Hellmann's made with olive oil.  Drizzled warm over prepared red potatoes and prepared string beans.  Guests raved!

I liked this sauce for the most part but I will cut most of the salt next time because I thought it was too salty.

I have to admit, I was very skeptical about making this dip/sauce. After much deliberation I went for it and must say...I LOVE it. I also used it on a sub sandwich and was amazed. So very easy to make...especially in a hurry. Many Thanks for posting this recipe!

I used this recipe to mimic a sandwhich from one of my favorite resteraunts. It turned out great. It wasn't quite as oily as I liked it so I added a little olive oil, but otherwise it was perfect! Thanks for the help!

Tried this recipe for the first time recently and it was quite tasty. I added just a bit more of lemon juice as I love the extra lemony flavor. I will definitely be making this again with my crab cakes.

My first time ever having "aioli" and all I can say is OMG!!! It was delicious beyond words and so easy!!! I used light mayo and just 2 tablespoons lemon juice. I let it sit for a little longer than a half an hour in my fridge while I cooked dinner... Served it with Feta Cheese Turkey Burgers from this site! I am SO making Aioli more often!!!  Thank You Jeff & Justine!!!!!!! :D  UPDATE:  Made this again as a dip for spicy sweet potato fries and again it was wonderful!

Wow! Incredibly delicious!!! I used bottled lemon juice and it came out amazing. Used this on BLT's, steak sandwiches, and portabello mushroom burgers so far. Can't wait to try it with asparagus and artichokes!

Good recipe.  May be a little less lemon juice so it tastes less like ceasar dressing.

Very very good. I used on Crab Cakes and they paired great together. Make sure you chill it well, at least a few hours. I felt it wasn't cold enough when I used it.

Like most others, I served this garlic aioli with crab cakes. After mixing everything together, I let it sit in the fridge for about an hour to let the flavors come together.  Easy, delicious and I think it could be served with yam fries, on a sandwich or thinned out and drizzled on a salad.

This was very good as a dressing for chicken paninis.  I used bottled lemon juice, which was a little strong-- next time I will use fresh.  I think that change will make it a five star recipe!

Very good recipe - made exactly as written and will make again, adding a bit more garlic to taste (we like garlic!).  We had this with “Easy Tuna Patties” from this site and the two were very good together!  I usually make my aioli with dill and this was a nice change (although I did miss the dill!).  Will definitely make again.

I doubled the recipe because I wanted to share the aioli with a co-worker who loves sauces. I wanted to get his opinion on the taste. He LOVED it!! Since the first batch, I have made 3 more double-sized batches and they disappeared! Everyone that I have shared the aioli with has absolutely loved it!

I made this recipe with avocado & olive oil mayo and also with half of the same mayo and half plain Greek yogurt.  The recipe with the Greek yogurt was slightly better in my opinion.

Easy to make with ingredients normally in the pantry. For some strange reason I was out of fresh garlic so used granulated. Delicious. This time it was perfect for dipping steamed artichokes but I can foresee many other uses. May add some herbs in the future just for something different.

I didn’t change a thing & it was fantastic. I set it out with lots of other topping selections to be used for a “build your own pizza” bar. Everyone that used it loved it & commented on how good it was.

Made this to add to my hot roast beef sandwiches. My husband hates mayo but he couldn’t get enough of it. Will definitely make this again. It was more than I needed so I used the rest as a chicken marinade. Can’t wait to see how it works out.

I made this with veganaise and it was  beyond delish. My boyfriend was obsessed and made his own batch the next day. The lemon makes it perfect. I recommend letting it sit 24 hrs in the fridge prior to using for maximum deliciousness.

I followed this recipe perfectly.  We used it on chickpea patties which were a bit bland.  This really perked things up. Even made my fam like the patties which they didn't like before.  I only gave this 4 stars because it was too tart for me. But every one else liked the tartness. I'm going to cut back on the lemon juice and add lemon peel. This has become a staple in our house.

I was worried the raw garlic might be too strong but it turned out awesome! I added an extra clove of garlic because my family loves garlic... and it turned out delicious! Nice and fresh, tangy and definitely garlic-y.

This was absolutely wonderful! The only change I made was that I didn't use as much salt as the recipe called for.  I used it  on top of spicy chicken meatballs.  It only required a small dollop on each meatball. It added so much flavor. It's a keeper!

VEGANIZED VERSION: I swapped in vegenaise and it turned out so good!! Hand minced garlic tasted MUCH better than pre-minced. We used it on some veggie burgers and sandwiches. Thanks for the easy and delicious recipe!

What a great sauce!  It’s really simple but I? think that’s what makes it so good. I? made salmon cakes and used this sauce with them and it tasted great!

An old recipe book of mine had something like this - adding some horseradish and dried onions for a meat fondue dip.

Easy and excellent. Spread the sauce on previously cooked, thinly sliced pieces of steak ( could use roast) then wrapped the beef around grilled asparagus spears. The remaining sauce was served as an accompanying dip. Rave reviews.

I am doing a Keto diet and was looking for something safe to add a little OOMPH to my tuna patties.  Wow!  I tried this and tasted it shortly after I mixed it and it was way too salty.  I was worried.  I read other reviews and let it "rest" for a while, I retasted it and it was delicious!  So yummy.  It will definitely add some flavor to your food.

My husband loved this last night. Took less than 10 mins to make. My only problem was pressing the garlic into a paste. I tried using my blender but it just chopped the garlic, then I tried pressing it which was bet. Suggest letting it rest for 30+ mins in fridge before serving. I tasted it immediately after I made it and again after 30+ mins in fridge. The flavors settled after the rested time and it was delish! Would make again and I did nothing to change the recipe.

I used this as a dipping sauce for a fondue dinner with veggies... it was the hit of the table.  It says 10 min of prep... I did it in 3 min and didn't chill before serving.... also, I used a garlic press (fancy for me) not the pre-diced jar of garlic.  No complaints!

I made flat breads with grilled steak, fresh mozzarella, roasted bell pepper and cherry tomatoes that I drizzled this sauce on top of after cooking. By itself there was way too much lemon and salt but once it was combined with everything else was good. I will remake it with less of those ingredients and probably try Greek yogurt in place of the mayo.

I did alter the recipe a bit by adding a bit more citrus (I like a little more bite) and I added an additional (large) glove of garlic. Great for dipping, sandwich spread, etc.

I think it turned out real well. As other reviewers have said, I only used 2 tbs of the lemon juice and it was still way too much. I did let it rest for 30 minutes and it did improve a bit, but not enough. Next time I will probably do 1 tbs and add anymore to taste. Also I used garlic powder equivalent instead of cloves but I  ended up adding probably twice as much garlic to it, but I love me some garlic so that might just be preference! (it also helped offset the overpowering amount of lemon juice).  I would also say you really have to mix this well or it will be runny.

This aioli is perfect. The key is letting it set in the refrigerator for at least an hour to let the flavors marry. Keep it covered and give it time.

I made this using oven roasted garlic instead of chopped raw garlic. Made the whole house smell wonderful! The key thing to remember is these flavours intensify while it's refrigerating- I kept adding garlic cloves because I was taste-testing while I was making it and the flavours were very subtle, but they really packed a punch after it sat for awhile! Very good, will absolutely make again!

I'm health conscience and made mine with 0 fat Greek Yogurt. I used 5 garlic cloves raw, 5 roasted garlic cloves roasted and Olive Oil (which is required to take the tang out of Greek yogurt). Then to mimic the garlic aioli at Carabbas I added teaspoon of Italian Seasoning. With garlic Pita chips it's a great dip if you use a small amount of parsley. Thanks for the great recipe base to a healthier me! =D

Fantastic! I made mine in the food processor so that the garlic would be very finely minced. It went very well with my black bean burgers, served as a great dipping sauce for french fries, and I am planning on pairing this with a roasted artichoke tomorrow night.

I added Sriracha pepper sauce, grated Parmesan cheese, and melted butter to add to the WOW factor of this aioli to dip our Portobello mushroom Phillies in! Amazing results! My kids and husband had thirds!!!

Excellent and really easy (2 of my favorite words for recipes!) I used Hellman's olive oil mayo AND sour cream with mine. I also added some spices (oregano/basil/lemon pepper) and used it as a marinade for salmon that I used for fish tacos. FABULOUS!!! I'll be doing this again tomorrow too. Lovely sauce indeed! Thank you . . .

I left out the salt because my boyfriend prefers low sodium. Other than that change I left it completely alone. Very great tasting...fabulous on beef dip! I highly suggest making it a day before you want to use it to give the flavours time to blend nicely

I made this as instructed but roasted, mashed, then diced the garlic before adding to the condiment.  (I wanted to roast  red pepper anyway.) This was such an easy recipe and really elevated my grilled chicken sandwiches. I will definitely make this again.

This is a great dish. Though if you are not used to salt you should dial back the salt. Great on sandwiches.

So good I could eat it with a spoon.  I fixed it to go with ham on Christmas Eve.   We had finger foods, so I made slider  ham sandwiches with the aioli on them.  What a hit and no one could believe how easy it was to make.

The only way to improve this recipe was by adding some finely shredded Parmesan cheese! I used this as a dip for my artichoke. I was sad to finish the vegetable because I didn't have anything else to dip in it!

Good recipe but way too much lemon juice for my liking....I ended up doubling the recipe but I didn't add more lemon juice, it was still a bit pungent but much better!

This was wayyyyy too much lemon juice, too sour and too runny for my liking. I would probably only have done 1 tbsp if not less.

This was very easy and tasted great, though it does have a strong flavor by itself. It's perfect for a burger or other food with a lot of other flavors since it can complement them without being overwhelmed, but you might want to reduce the lemon juice if it's going with something more simple. You can always add more later if you don't think it's strong enough.  If desired, you can substitute plain Greek yogurt for the mayo without sacrificing much taste, but make sure it's thick yogurt. Some cheap "Greek" yogurt is a little thin.

When using Kraft mayo, I skip the lemon.
I spread this on sliced Italian or French bread and bake at 350°
Often, I add shredded Italian type cheeses to the mix as well.
Everyone looks for more of this bread when we have a crowd!

This was soooooo good!  Used with crab cakes, zucchini fries and as a sandwich spread. Couldn't stomach the idea of that much mayo, so I substituted with 1/2 light mayo and 1/2 fat free plain Greek yogurt.  Texture and flavor was perfect! Delish!

This was unbelievable! I'm a huge critic of garlic aioli, but this is one of my favorites. I used it for dipping sauce on veggies too as well as using it as the base in my tuna mixture for tuna sandwiches.

Perfect aioli. When using frozen garlic (from trader Joe's) I only use one cube otherwise it's too strong for me.

I can't believe I never tried something like this before. So easy and so good. I made by eye not measuring. Refrigerated about 45 min while I cooked artichokes. Perfect for dipping, don't think I'll go back to regular mayo again. Also dipped tomato in it like a salad dressing and was very good as well. Will make again! Can't wait to try on sandwiches.

A local restaurant has garlic aioli fries that are addicting - they just mix it into a pile of hot fries. We decided to make our own, and this recipe works great (though I double the garlic, since we're crazy for it). Our homemade fries are better than the restaurant's because we can make it garlic-y-er. I agree that there's a bit too much lemon juice, but it's not as noticeable if it sits for a day or more.

This was fantastic. Made exactly as written with bottled lemon juice about 3 hours before eating. Used with chicken sliders on pretzel buns (plus feta on mine..yum).  Was an amazing addition and so easy!!

Yum! Make sure you let it sit in the fridge for a while. Also, stir it a few times while it's in there.

Easy and delicious! I made some to go with homemade pita chips. Also used on a roast beef sandwich for lunch and with some baked chicken tenders for dinner. Love it with crabcakes, too. UPDATE: Mixed a little horseradish into some, and it was great with a piece of leftover strip steak!

Dude.  That about sums it up.  Totally fantastic.  My toddler goes nuts when I put this over a cabbage slaw.  Love to dip sweet potato fries and meat in it.  I use lemons or limes, whatever I have on hand.

This rec'd rave reviews! I suggest cutting the salt in half. Simply amazing when used to make a white pizza.  Paired with Jay's Signature Pizza Crust, onions, spinach, banana peppers and OMG!!!!  They were fighting over the last piece (from 4 pizzas).

My family loved this recipe! We recently had aioli for the first time and this recipe tastes just the same as the restaurants! I paired this sauce with Ore-Ida crispy crinkle cut fries and devoured the pair in minutes!

I mixed this recipe..as written, except for having to use fresh lime juice...(out of lemons)...and I used some yesterday on a cucumber/tomato sandwich ..it was so good that I had to make another half, just so I could use more Aioli. Today I put it on a tomato/cold cut sandwich with the same results. I could eat it by itself, it is soooo good. I will use it on a pork chop tonite and also on some fresh swiss chard. MMMM

I used reduced fat mayo, and decreased the lemon juice to 1.5 tbsp.  It was excellent as a condiment on sandwiches.  You could use the recommended 2.5 tbsp of lemon juice if serving with seafood, in my opinion.

It was alright, I think I could have used less lemon juice. Too much zing which I can't handle. Taste great with burgers as a spread. C:

I thought this was okay. I seen it on the recipe buzz recommended so I decided to try it. I used the calculate button and changed it to 2 servings, which is what I needed. I thought it still tasted pretty much like mayonnaise though it seemed more greasy for some reason. I did use lite mayonnaise and maybe the recipe really needs the full fat kind. I think adding some kind of chopped herb might have given it that extra flavor, not sure.

This is a great Aioli, so easy to make and delicious on salmon, and artichokes!  I omitted the salt and was glad I did as the aioli had plenty of salt without it.  I will make this aioli again and again.

This is great! It's very garlicky but very good! I made oven fried potatoes which we dipped in this. I had also made chicken fingers which my husband also dipped in it. It is dangerous because we kept eating even when we probably were not hungry anymore because it is so tasty. It does have a strong taste so it might not taste delicious at first bite but put it in the refrigerator for at least a little while before eating. That seemed to help somehow.

Awesome recipe.  Served this on homemade rolls with roast beef, swiss cheese, and arugula.  It turned out more lemony than I was expecting, but that was a perfect complement to the arugula. Delicious!

This is such a simple recipe - I felt like I was cheating by using mayonnaise but got over the guilt quickly! Used light mayo and omitted the salt as previous reviewers have done.   After tasting it I did add a bit of finely grated lemon zest, just a couple of grates worth.  About 1/4 tsp to add a different level of flavour. Thanks for this easy recipe.

Very tasty. I used fresh garlic from my garden (really strong flavour) and a little less lemon juice. I really liked the pepper too! Will def. use again.

Yummy! I like to roast the garlic cloves in olive oil in the oven before mashing them and adding them to the mixture. Also, very yummy with added herbs like oregano, parsley, etc. Absolutely perfect with artichokes.

This was great!  I gave it 4 starts instead of 5 only because I did follow some changes and only put in 1 1\2 Tblsp Lemon juice and next time I wont put any salt in or only add a tiny bit after it sits otherwise it is way to salty.

My husband is super-picky with a list of ingredients I can't cook with so when I made this for myself as a dip for steamed artichokes, I never considered that he might want to try it. When I went to get some I found he'd stolen it off the counter and was putting it on his tuna sandwich. I knew I'd found a keeper!

Delicious!!! I made these to compliment "My Crab Cakes". The crab cakes turned out ok, but the aioli made them SO much better. I added about 1/2 tsp Old Bay to the mixture and pressed some (already) minced garlic through a press several times so that it mixed in smoother. Yum!
