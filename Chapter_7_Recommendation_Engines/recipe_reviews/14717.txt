This was pretty good. I would use a disposible pan next time some of the milk seeped under the foil and my pan was burnt. I will make it again and probably try adding some onions and peppers and garlic in the potatoes.

I made this tonight in a hurry and didn't really read through until it was in the oven. However it was splendid and came out just fabulous. I used a mandoline to slice the potatoes really thin and sliced the Polish kielbasa into bite sized pieces instead of leaving in lengths. I started by layering some of the potatoes followed by kielbasa then cheese then layered again with potatoes and so on. Finished off with milk and seasonings, so I guess I did it lagsana style and it still worked out. Kids loved it and all hubby could say was mmmm the whole time he was eating. This is a keeper.

This was a good casserole. My husband even liked it! Because we have to watch our cholestoral, I used turkey sausage and low fat cheese along with soy milk, and it still came out tasty. I didn't bother with the foil - just sprayed the casserole dish - and had no problems with sticking or cleanup. Will make again.

I have seven people in my family and opt for casserole dishes whenever possible. Tried this one last night, and I have to say it, wasn't very well received. Everyone wanted to know where the main course was??? They viewed this more like a side dish as opposed to "real dinner". Next time I will probably add more sausage (throughout - not just on top) and mix cheese with potatoes.

Wow--fantastic recipe. My family loved it. Used both kielbasa and some smoked sausage had on hand and didn't have the caraway seeds, but didn't miss them. Will make again and again.

I wasn't very excited to make this recipe but I had all the ingredients so I tried it.  My family and I absolutely love it!!  As long as you follow the directions it comes out perfect.  I use Hillshire Farms Lite Keilbasa and a mandolin to slice my potatoes and it comes out very well.  I have made it with a combo of sweet potatoes and baking potatoes and that is also fabulous.  Since it is requested so much at home I try to be more health conscious and I use all sweet potato and it is great!  Thanks for the excellent easy recipe!!!

This was excellent.  We love Kielbasa and are always searching for new ways to cook it.  I thought the flavor of the Caraway and dill was great.  I had to cook it about 20 minutes longer to get the potatoes done.

I thought this would be a hit with my family but it wasn't.  there are changes I'd make if I ever made this again.  I put this in a regular pan and it worked fine. There was a lot of grease from the cheese and kielbasa.  Next time I'd boil the kielbasa to remove most of the grease.  I have a hard time cooking sliced potatoes so I chunked mine.  I eliminated the dill weed but next time I'd also eliminate the caraway seed too.  I added seasoned salt and Lemon Pepper.  I liked the idea of not using a cream soup (i.e. Cream of Mushroom) but I'd make a lot of changes too.  Next time I would either cut the cooking time in  half or else not cover the dish.

I made this with Italian sausage(which I sliced and removed from the casing), 3/4 cup evaporated milk, cream of potato soup and 2 cups of shredded cheddar. I topped it with paprika and threw it all in a crock pot for 5 hours. OMG- I don't eat meat but when my husband and 3 teenage sons sat down for dinner I WANTED TO EAT IT TOO! They LOVED it and I was as close as I've ever been to becoming a carnivore again! WOW! And 2 of my boys don't even LIKE sausage!

Made this last night and it was yummy!  I'm not sure how the potatoes are not getting done for some but mine turned out excellent--just done, neither crispy nor soft--perfect al dente.  Nor was this greasy as some mentioned.  I used regular Hillshire Farm Polska Kielbasa and didn't get the "floating in grease" effect others seemed to have gotten.  I combined this with a green salad and it was a stick to your ribs good winter dinner.  Of course, I am from the south originally and might not have noticed the "grease" others who cook all healthy all the time might've.

Next time I make it I will add more spice; garlic, onion salt, etc.  I will add onions in the layering process.  I left out the caraway because we don't like it but the dill was a nice change and flavor.

I do recommend this recipe, my family really liked it.

The flavors blended together well.  This is a great one dish meal.  I did however, boil the sausage first to cut down on the fat content. I also sprayed the pan with Pam and cleanup was easy!

This was good. Half of my family ate it and liked it, the other half not crazy about it. I think thats why the mixed reveiws. I did slice my potatoes very thin and put them in a large plastic bowl and nuked them on the potato setting. Then I followed the directions using Hillshire (no problems with the grease) Polish Kielbasa. I did sprinkle garlic salt on entire dish as well as other seasonings. I would make again for myself and my oldest son.

Instead of cutting the potatoes and waiting for them to cook all the way, I tried this with a variety of boxed scalloped potatoes without adding the dill and caraway seed.  I also added a mixture of shredded cheese.  It worked and tasted alot better.

We loved this recipe.  It was exactly what I have been looking for.  My DH loved it, which was no surprise.  I was shocked when my son started digging in because he is a ultra picky 3 year old.  Thank you so much for a recipe I can serve for my whole family!

Iliked this because it was so easy to prepare and clean up was a snap.  I am not fond of dill, so I substituded thyme and sage for the seasonings. This would be a great dish to make on a camping trip. The only thing I was not happy with was the way the cheese melted.  It got king of rubbery, but it still tasted good.  Three out of the four of us liked it very much!

I made a few changes to serve a bigger family and to suit my personal preference, but I can tell this recipe would have been just as good as written.  Because I'm serving a large family, I used 3x as many potatoes, double the cheese, but only 1 lb of sausage.  I left out the caraway seed, because I hate it, but I added 2 cups of saurkraut and a couple tablespoons of brown mustard.  Also, since I added mustard, I left out the pepper.  I poured a little less than 1c milk over the whole, which fit into a 9x13 glass casserole dish just fine.  I used the greased, glass dish to skip the foil step.  It's just now gone into the oven, but my brothers are making enthusiastic noises, so I imagine it will be a success.  Thanks for the recipe!

I get soo hungry when I smell this casserole cooking!  I've always had trouble with the foil leaking (end up scrubbing off burned residue), so this time I just sprayed the pan with cooking spray and covered tightly with aluminum foil and it turned out great!  It's even faster to prepare this way too!  I also added about 1 c. sliced baby carrots and a thinly-sliced onion for more color and flavor; my husband said he liked it even better this way. We always use turkey kielbasa (for lower fat), and I slice it into bite-sized pieces before cooking (easier to serve).

This was SO good!  I skipped the caraway seeds.  I added onions. I will boil or saute the kielbasa next time to reduce the grease a little, but it wasn't excessive without that step. Definitely a keeper.

This was great. I didn't bother with the foil on the bottom, just sprayed the casserole dish, and had no problems with sticking or cleanup. I cooked the potatoes alone for 20 mins with no foil on top. In the meantime I boiled the keilbasa to cut the fat a little. When I took the potatoes out of the oven, I added the other ingrediants adding an extra cup of cheese as others have suggested & ommitting the caraway seeds (didn't have any. Then I cooked it for 40 mins. The hour cooking time seemed right to me, it must depend on how thin you slice your potatoes. I did it this way because a lot of people said the keilbasa was mushy yet the potatoes weren't done & this just came out perfect! I'm very Polish so I loved this dish & my husband went wild over it. This is be made any times again. Thank you Sue so much!

I like the flavor of this dish, but I left out the kielbasa for the first 30 minutes of baking (added the remaining ingredients) so it would not overcook.  After adding it, I baked for an additional 40 minutes, and the potatoes were still not done.  A little dry, I would increased the cheese and milk next time.

This casserole was pretty good.  I did not, however, use the dill or caraway.  It's best to spice it up to your own liking.  One tip:  cook the potatoes alone for the first 30 minutes, then add the sausage for the last 30 minutes.  The first time I made it, the sausage was very over-cooked.

Overall I would say this is a good one dish meal -however - I will spice it up a bit more the next time I make it - it was a little bland for our tastes.  The cheese came out kinda rubbery and I would think that velveeta would be a great substitute.  I also added some onions.

My husband who is not big on kilbasa liked it and my 3 year old asked for more.

I tried this out recently at our cabin near the lake and it was a big hit! The combination of kielbasa, cheese, potatoes, and seasonings blends VERY well.  I also took it to work -- and
my co-workers liked it as well.  Would be good to have with sauerkraut!MitziX6 is OBVIOUSLY not POLISH!

You dont have to mess with the foil, just spray your pan and cover with foil. Unless you slice the potatoes real thin you need to bake it longer, about 1 1/2 hours. this is like augratin potatoes with sausage. I used lean turkey sausage and it was NOT greasy. The sausage got overdone by the time the potatoes were tender. Cheddar cheese doesn't really melt that well but I put more on during the last 5 minutes and it melted over the top. edible but not worth the time and ingredients to make this again.

A tasty and easy recipe.  Everyone in the family seemed to enjoy it.  I cut the sausage into pieces instead of cutting it in half long ways.  The bite size pieces seemed to work well for me.  I also used turkey sausage to cut down on the cholesterol. Even with these little modifications it came out very well.

The sausage and potatoes cooked and tasted fine, but cheddar cheese just doesn't hold together well when cooked this way -- I should have realized before I even started. This wasn't so much a casserole as some hot dogs, potatoes, and separated cheese.

This has become a regular on our meal rotations.  i use dill seed instead of dill weed, and skimp on the caraway seeds - just not one of my favorite spices.  I don't measure the cheese b/c I like a lot of it, so I just cover it really well.  Actually, I don't really measure anything - it's such an easy recipe that you can easily tweak it to your liking.  Everyone in our family likes it and the leftovers are great, too!

I have made this several times and think it's great, but I have made some changes.  I use probably twice as many potatoes and I use light kielbasa instead of the regular.  I think that helps take care of some of the greasiness.  It's not the most calorie-conscious meal, but it does taste good on a cold day.

This recipe turned out great! I didn't have the dill weed or the caraway seed on hand so I added onion, garlic & cream of celery soup to the milk. My family ate it up. I will definately make this one again.

Tasty, but make this one only if you're not prone to heartburn... Even with turkey kielbasa, this was awfully greasy.  Still, it was a big hit. Caraway and dill were a nice flavor combo.

This one was buried in my recipe box, I hadn't made it in 6 years!  I sprayed my dish with cooking spray and there was no mess.  This time I sliced the potatoes very thin and after I put the layer of potatoes in the dish, I added one chopped onion and sprinkled it with a bit of garlic powder.  The onion really added to the flavor of the dish.  I also used skim milk, because that's what I had.  It was so tasty.  My only issue with it is the serving size.  It makes 6 SMALL servings.

On the upside, this dish is fast, easy and simple to make. However, though it's tasty and satisfying, I didn't think it was anything special -- it tastes just like plain old hot-dogs-and-potatoes. I probably won't make it again.

I used a mandolin to slice the potatoes, which made this recipe very quick and easy to prepare.  I lightly sprayed the baking dish instead of lining with foil, although I did cover it tightly with foil. I used extra cheddar and was liberal with the pepper, dill, and carraway. I also used bratwurst instead of keilbasa.  It was wonderful.  I think this is a great recipe that can have many variations, and that it would probably taste just as great following Sue's recipe to the 'T'. I just like to play with my food! :-)

It was pretty good.  The dill weed was kind of a nice touch.  Probably wouldn't make again.

YUMMY! Very easy to prepare. My husband loved it. I used low fat cheddar cheese and low fat kielbasa and it tasted great!

I used Pork Sauasages instead of Polish Sausage and lightly grilled them to remove excess fat but the recipe was delicious

My husband loves kielbasa but being a picky eater, like it only one way - BOILED. However, he loved this recipe and noted that he liked it even better than boiled! The ultimate compliment.

This was just ok. Would be better with sauerkraut to give more flavor. Pretty plain as-is, even with the seasonings.

Made this for extended family.  The only changes I made was that I did not have Kielbasa so just used ground pork sausage and used a can of cream of mushroom soup thinned with a little milk.  Was loved by all!

We were very pleased with this.  I did not have kielbasa, but did have spice Italian sausages, and they worked very well.  Did not add milk, but still quite delicious.

The flavor was good but mine was very greasy.  I would maybe cook the grease out of the sausage first and use a less greasy cheese.  I also cut my potatoes with a mandolin and added 1 sweet onion cut with a mandolin.  I layered the potatoes, onion, sausage and cheese in that order in 2 layers, after potatoes I seasoned with salt and pepper,  then I put the milk and dill weed.  I omitted the caraway seeds because I dislike them.

I did make some changes because I didn't have any dill weed or caraway seeds it turned out just as delicious and my family was fighting over seconds. I will definitely use this recipe again. I am putting it into my go-to box.

5 stars for simplicity and flavor, 4 stars for grease overload! I attempted to cut back on the amount of grease, thanks to other reviews. I like my sausage sliced and pan fried, then placed on paper towels to absorb the grease (I also dab the sausage with paper towels). However, this didn't do the trick once the sausage, potatoes, and cheese were combined.  Next time I will cook the potatoes and milk first, then add pan fried sausage and cheese on top, baking just long enough to melt the cheese.  In addition to the dill and caraway seed, I sprinkled seasoned salt and garlic powder over the potatoes, and will do this the next time I make it. My hubby LOVED this dish! We'll eat this regularly, as long as I can cut back on the grease...

Very, very good.  I use the turkey kielbasa, eliminate the caraway seed (I never have it on hand), and use sharp cheddar.  Turns out delicious every time!

Great comfort food dish. I used a glass dish sprayed with Pam covered with foil instead of the foil packet. Like other reviewers I sliced turkey kielbasa and layered with potatoes and an onion. My family loved it!

Very easy to make! I just used a basic 9x13 pan and sprayed non-stick cooking spray before putting in the ingredients. No problems with food burning or sticking to the bottom. I just covered the dish with foil and it turned out great! It disappeared quickly so I know I'll make it again.

Wonderful, hearty, and delicious on a cold winter's day.  Use lots of potatoes, include some sweet potatoes, don't bother with lining the pan with foil - just grease it.  It can be a bit greasy, but that may depend on the type of sausage you put in.  I also cut mine in chunks as other reviewers have suggested.

I had some extra kielbasa left over from our cookout yesterday & was searching for a meal to make w/ it. I did skip the foil on bottom and just sprayed w/ olive oil & I also left out the 2 spices. Was a hit, even w/ my pickiest child. Will make again for sure, loved it!

I'm sure by the time my 2 little kids got done, there was twice as much cheese in the casserole dish as there needed to be.  The kids loved the kielbasa (which was quite a surprise), but wouldn't touch the potatoes, which my husband and I were all too happy to eat for them!  This dish was good for our family...I thought there would have been leftovers, but there weren't any.

Agree with Christine in that it seemed more like sausages and potatoes with cheese than a casserole, but it was still tasty.  I needed to cook extra time as well, don't know if thinner potato slices would have cooked faster.

You really HAVE to try this one.  I served this for a brunch, and someone brought over a version of ham and cheese casserole too.  This recipe was soooo good that everybody ate this one up and barely touched the other one.  Will definitely make again.  I skipped the caraway seed, by the way.

eh...we didnt care for this so much...i dont know if i did something wrong but i had to soak greese up with a paper towel before serving...

i made it just as stated for once ...i did use beef kielbasa - maybe that was my mistake? the cheese was obliterated..it tasted ok tho...just way to greasy....

I made some of the same changes other reviewers made.  I added a layer of onions and more cheese.  I also added a few spices like garlic salt, etc to the potatoes.  Delish!

This is good. I made these changes:

-I only needed 2 large baked potatoes
-I used 2 cups of 2% cheddar cheese and lite turkey sausage
-I sprayed the bottom of dish with olive oil, used the suggested spices,  covered it with foil and cooked according to instructions. Potatoes were fully cooked and it was not greasy.

Simple to make and my meat-and-potatoes hubby loved it.  I sliced the sausage into bite-sized pieces.  Put it together and in the foil early in the day and refrigerated until about an hour before dinner.  Thanks for sharing.  August 2012 update: added a sliced onion to the packet this time and it turned out even better!

This was SUCH wonderful comfort food.  I think we could eat this every day.  Didn't bother with the foil, just sprayed down the pan with olive oil.  So hearty and warming.  Delicious!

This recipe needed a little extra cheddar cheese but that was all.  Also, I found that leaving the skins on the potatoes rather than peeling them helped the sliceshold together.  Very good dinner!

I began making this in 2003, but just got around to posting a review.  I make this at least once every 2-3 weeks.  I don't use the caraway or other spice.  I have kids and the combo of the cheese and potatoes and sausage is a hit!  I dice up the sausage though for the little ones.  Whoever says this recipe is no good prob messed it up somehow!

I thought this was a delicious dish to have if you want something different than the usual. I did put the potatos in the microwave for 5 minutes before putting them in the dish to ensure they cooked fully and I did also add an extra cup of cheese & deleted the caraway seeds. We will make this recipe again occasionally.

My family liked the dish. I did add extra cheese as well as using beef smoked sausage. I had to increase the cooking time an extra 20 minutes.

This is a so-so recipe for our tastes.  I couldn't taste the cheddar cheese, and I had used sharp cheddar, so I don't know why it was even an ingredient.  It smelled good while it was in the oven, though, but I don't think I'll be making this one again. I didn't have a problem with grease, either.

I thought this could be pretty bland, so I added lots of garlic, mushrooms and onions.  I cooked it for at least an hour and a half, and the potatoes were still not done.  This took too much time to cook for not much flavor in the end.  My husband did not like it all, I will not make this again.

I followed the recipe to a T and it wasn't very good. It took longer to cook than the recipe called for. It lacked taste and the name brand kielbasa I used turned mushy. This is not worth the time or cost to make. Sorry.

Made this for a crowd and everyone raved. I made a big batch and layered potatoes, thin onion slices, kielbasa & cheese, in that order then the topping. I omitted the caraway...& used fresh dill from the garden. Fantastic!!!

Took a few hints from another kielbasa/potato casserole and layered cream of chicken soup mixed with the milk, some cream cheese, garlic powder, minced onion and cajun spice.  Topped each layer with the cheese.  Great and easy supper, if not the healthiest.

Good and easy.  I think I will make this on my lazy days.  I like having a different way to use sausage.  Kind of tasted like fried potatoes (the breakfast kind, but without the grease) and sausage and cheese.  I skipped the caraway because I don't like that and also used smoked sausage (Healthy Choice) to cut down on fat.  This will go in my recipe book.  I have to warn you though, this is not one of those "knock you off your feet" recipes.  Just good and simple.

This was really good!!!  Sausage and potato and cheese!!!!  The foil was a good idea, it got really messy.  Cooked for an hour, the potatoes were perfect and the spices worked really well.  I left the skins on the potatoe as well.  Excellent meal, but perhaps next time, try lower fat sausage.

Simple, hearty and good.   A nice meal on a wintry night.   The only one who gave it a so so review was the kid who doesn't like kielbasa.
