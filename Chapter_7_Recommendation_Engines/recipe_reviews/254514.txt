These make excellent gifts. I sliced the jalapenos instead of chopping them and used a spiralizer to make carrot ribbons. The herbs/spices gave the flavor a new, welcome, dimension. Thank you for the recipe.

I was so excited to find a pickled Jalapeno recipe without sugar but with a healthy oil instead. I made it up and got it in the fridge and a couple days later I pulled it out to find that the oil had separated out and clumped up into a ball of spice filled fat at the top leaving the veggies sitting in a very strong vinegar solution in the bottom. I did try pulling some out and putting it in a bowl along with a little of the oily mixture. I stuck it in the microwave and zapped it for 10 seconds to see what it would taste like. It was way more of a vinegar taste than I really cared for but did I get the right mixture of the fat and vinegar?  What I might try doing, is taking it out of the fridge for 30 minutes before I want to use it and let warm a bit before I shake or stir it up. Then see how it tastes with some chicken or something. I'll re-review it after I do that!
