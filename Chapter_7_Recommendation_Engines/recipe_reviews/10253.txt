I am not a big fan of coconut cookies but my husband favors them above any others and we both enjoyed these. I enjoyed them because they were easy to make with the basic cookie recipe and they did not get flat like many cookies do. They were just right, nice and chewy.

I think the idea of having the mix in the pantry and ready to use is fantastic and have made several others of the cookies with success. The coconut however for me was way to runny and cooked paper thin. But the other recipies were good.

The coconut seemed to firm the cookies up a little bit better compared to the plain choc chip recipe. I also added choc chips to this batch, and reduced the butter to 6Tb. Also, I made some larger & some smaller, and the smaller ones seemed to not flatten out as much. I kind of liked the smaller/thicker ones better, but some might like the thinner crispy ones. VERY sugary (I think too much sugar in the basic mix), but tasty!
