WOW! I now have family and friends beating down the door wanting more! 

I only changed one thing and added two. I changed the sugar to 1 cup sugar and 2/3 cups dark brown sugar. I added a tsp of vanilla and a pinch or two of ground cinnamon. That's all I changed! WONDERFUL AND EASY!

I have eaten Sweet Potato pie all my life because I have lived all my life in the south. Because it always tasted like pumpkin pie I never made one. I made this pie and noticed that the recipe didn't call for vanilla so I used vanilla buttter nut flavoring and I also used fresh nutmeg. It was so goooood!!!! Best thing was it didn't taste like pumpkin pie.
Everyone that tried it loved it too. I will make this for Thanksgiving! This will jow be a family favorite. My neighbor said it was the best sweet potato pie that he has ever eaten. He is 74 and has eaten many.

I tried this southern sweet potato pie as I was born & raised in Arkansas.  I could have had 5 stars except it was missing vanilla.  

Not bad though...not bad at all!

I'm searching for the *perfect* sweet potato pie and while this one tasted pretty good, I'm sorry it just wasn't it.  For one thing, it was REALLY sweet, and I love sweets, but it was almost like sweet potato candy, and I even added a little extra sweet potato when I saw how thin the batter was.  The consistency was really light almost like custard and I was looking for a denser pie.  I won't say it's not edible, it's just not exactly what I was looking for.

Finally a Sweet Potato Pie my husband "really" raves about! It brings out the flavor of the potato, not overpowers them like many based on a Pumpkin recipe. For those family members who like sweet potato casserole and the marshmallow topping, I just do a little marshmallow creme lattice across the pie instead of whipped creme.

Pie is not even cooked yet and I had to review.  Best tasting filling!  I did make a few changes.  Decreased white sugar to 1 c and added 3/4 brown.  Added a tsp vanilla.  Doubled recipe and have enough for 3 deep dish pies.

The most amazing sweet potato pie I have ever had. I tweaked it just slightly but adding a half a teaspoon of cinnamon and also exchanging the extra 2/3 cup of sugar for 1/2 brown sugar. AMAZING. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Wonderful! I will say that this is not like what I was thinking of as sweet potato pie. Every one I've ever had tasted almost identical to pumpkin pie to me. I don't mind that because I love pumpkin pie, but this is nothing like pumpkin pie. More like a sweet potato variety of custard pie. I like this better than the traditional. So did my husband. Delicious nutmeg flavor with a beautiful carmelization on top. This is what we'll make from now on whenever we have extra sweet potatoes. In the interest of health, I did substitute two egg whites for one of the eggs, cut the sugar back by 1/3 cup, and cut the butter back by 2 tbsp. It was plenty sweet enough and the texture was beautiful. To make it easier to mix in, I also melted the butter in the microwave and mixed it in last. Easy to make with a fantastic result!

This Thanksgiving my husband asked me to make a sweet potato pie. I was worried because I never made one before. After searching over recipes I decided this one sounded good. This was the easiest recipe to make, and I got so many rave reviews from the family. My husband thanked me for all my work and told me it was just how he remembered it when he was in the Army. This pie will be a new tradition in our family for years to come.

Being from the Midwest, I grew u having pumpkin pie for holiday deserts.  This year I wanted to make a sweet potato pie for my Southern family members for the first time ever.  Everyone loved it.  I did add a smidgeon of vanilla because I like vanilla, other than that, I followed the recipe.  I will definitely make this again.

Can I just say this pie was amazing!  Definitely a keeper but I steered off the recipe some to make it suit my taste. I actually add three cups of sweet potatoes to the recipe, which makes it less sweet.  Using three cups of sweet potatoes  yields two pies instead of one.  By far my favorite recipe for this pie with slight modifications.

Pie is amazing!!! We could have eaten the entire pie in 1 sitting. I did make a couple of modificiations to the recipe, I used Gluten Free flour & pie crust and used 1c agave nectar w/ 2/3c brown sugar instead of sugar. Added 1tsp vanilla and 1/4tsp pumpkin pie spice. Will remove the corn syrup next time, as I don't think it's needed w/the agave. Truely delish!

This was a pretty good recipe.I did make a few alterations as I went along to suit my family's tastes.  I added a Tbsp of Vanilla right off the bat to get rid of the canned sweet potato taste. I slowly added sugar until I got to 1 cup and was happy with the sweetness after the corn syrup went in.  I did not have the oily residue on the top that others had so I don't know about that.  I also made the filling in my food processor which gave me a silky smooth texture and NO lumps from the canned sweet potatoes.  My kids attacked it right out of the oven and it did not last one night. I would make it again and again.

Review 2:
I've been making this pie since the initial review. It's the best Fall/Holiday pie ever. MUCH better than pumpkin in my opinion. I only modified it slightly. I believe as written, It is a LITTLE too sweet (and like I said, I am a sweet-aholic). So, I brought the white sugar down to 2/3 C, included 2/3 C of brown sugar. Added a dash of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of vanilla to the batter. Then, before it goes in to the oven I sprinkle a very fine layer of brown sugar on top. I use a no-roll pie crust with this recipe and it is DELICIOUS. Cool it and add some fresh homemade whipped cream on top. THIS is a recipe you can pass on for generations. 


Review 1:
I may have to review after this has had time to completely cool... but as it stands right now, it may be a TAD too sweet for my tastes (and I like things sweet). I don't know if it is the addition of the 1/4th cup light corn syrup, but it's kind of oily? It still tastes good though.

Fabulous recipe. I made some changes to give it my personal touch. Instead of corn syrup, I used maple syrup. I also used 1 cup of brown sugar instead of 1 2/3 cup regular sugar, as there was plenty of sweetness from the other ingredients. I added a touch of cinnamon and a dash of vanilla too, as recommended by some of the other reviews. Thanks for sharing this one. I already have requests to make it again.

My family love this pie! I tweaked the recipe by splitting the sugar equal parts white and brown sugar, 1 teaspoon of vanilla flavoring, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon of ginger.  This is the best sweet potato pie, very moist and flavorful.

Well here it is Fall again an time for sweet potatoes, pumpkins and squash.  I  made this pie again today and it is just as good as I remembered it.  I think this is the absolute top recipe for this pie. 
I have been making them since I got married (48 yrs.) ago and this recipe is the BEST!

Love, love, love this recipe!!!! I have never been a fan of sweet potato pie, could never really find one I like. I only made this one for a friend that loves them. I can now say I love sweet potato pie. :) the only thing I did was some of the changes I read here.  I changed the 1 2/3 cups sugar to 1 cup of white and the 2/3 was brown sugar. I also add a little bit of vanilla and cinnamon as well.

This pie IS very sweet, but it's really good. I call this our candied yam pie, lol. My boys love it...and so do I, as I am a huge sweet potato fan. My husband, who isn't a fan, still eats this pie. Very good!

My first time making sweet potato pie and this was so very delicious.  I did substitute 2/3 sugar for brown sugar, added a little vanilla and added some fresh nutmeg... wow... I am very impressed with my first attempt.  I diced up two nice size sweet potatoes and them steamed them until quite mushy.

LOVED this pie! The filling was solid, delicious, and had the southern sweet potato taste. I added alittle vanilla, per the other reviews, and an extra sprinkle of flour to thicken the batter more. We will be making this every holiday now!

Wow!  This is so good!  I've never had sweet potato pie before, and never wanted to.  I don't like pumpkin so figured I wouldn't like this.  But, we were studying Alabama with the kids and thought we'd try the Southern favorite.  
This is a great recipe!!  I took the advice of others and used 1 cup white sugar, 2/3 cup brown sugar, added 1 tsp. vanilla and a pinch or so of cinnamon.  I think that made it even better.  Then, because I worried it would taste too much like sweet potato and not a sweet, yummy pie, I stacked marshmallows on top after it was done baking and broiled it until the mallows were perfectly browned.  I also made candied pecans by sauteing them with butter, brown sugar, maple syrup and coarse sea salt.  Cooled that, chopped them and sprinkled it on top when served.  The BEST pie we have ever had!!  WOW, I'm making it again tomorrow!  :)

this recipe is absolutely amazing, i tried it out a couple years ago and after being a huge hit, its become a holiday staple. its also very easy to use. i would note that its best to use a deep dish pastry shell because my first year i didnt and i ended up with like 2 or 3 pies.

2015 update: still my go to recipe for the holidays. This year I used fresh sweet potatoes (when I usually used the one in a can) and it was such a great difference.  My husband may have a new favorite pie after this! I may have to make yhis more often than just for the holidays!

The best sweet potato pie ever! My family is from South Carolina and North Carolina.  Sweet potato pie is a staple during holidays and just about anytime.  This pie is the best! Everyone loves this pie...and they all request this pie every chance they get.  It's better than any other pie on this site.

This pie is fantastic. I added a few drops of vanilla extract. Otherwise I just followed the recipe. I doubt if it is making a big difference. I don't know how it could taste any better. Raves from all who have tried it. Some even compared it to the pie their mother baked. Now how complimentary is that?

This is absolutely the best sweet potato pie.  Because I "cheated" and used "Simply Potatoes" brand already prepared mashed sweet potatoes, I used just 1 cup of sugar (brown) and substituted half and half for the condensed milk.  Everyone loved it.

This is now a staple at my family's Thanksgiving meal and is the only recipe my dh has everre-requested.  Don't worry about how runny it looks when you pour it into the crust...it firms up nicely.  None of us at my house are big fans of pumpkin pie so this is a wonderful alternative.

I usually make pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving, but I decided to make sweet potato pie instead and I am so glad I chose this recipe!!! I did make a few small changes - instead of 1/2c butter I used 1/4; in addition to the nutmeg I added 1/2t of cinnamon and about 1/8t of ginger, a dash of allspice and a dash of cloves; and used 2/3c of brown sugar with 1c of white sugar and added about 1T vanilla extract. All of my guests enjoyed it and complimented it over and over again. Thank you so much for this recipe! Needless to say, this will be replacing the spot on the table where the pumpkin pie used to be :)

This was my 1st ever attempt at sweet potato pie & it turned out pretty good. I like how the top of the pie kinda carmelized. It was a bit sweet & "oily" but still very good.

I made this pie on 11-26-08, my family loved it.  I was hosting my 2nd Thanksgiving dinner, and I received so many praises about this pie.  I read some of the other reviews and decided to use their advice.  I added 1 tsp. Vanilla and used 2/3 of brown sugar.  I also added a 1 tsp of nutmeg.  Boy, this recipe was easy to follow.  The pie was delicious.  I let it back for 55 minutes.  The pie wasn't too dark or too light. I still received calls or praise the day after Thanksgiving.  Thank you for all of your suggestions.

My husband kept beging me to make a sweet potato pie, so I began was looking for a delicious sweet potato pie recipe. One that would satisfy him, as well as for family holiday dinner. This was amazing! The pie was light , sweet and scrumptious! I did substitute brown sugar for white, I also added ground ginger,  cinnamon, and a teaspoon of fresh lemon juice. I also noticed that vanilla was missing from this recipe, so my next time I will add vanilla. This will now be my family recipe!

This is an excellent recipe if you prefer a sweeter pie. I added a dash of pumpkin pie spice and lemon juice but otherwise it was perfect! Easy to make too!

Ohhh-wee!! This recipe is amazing.  I have been using it for a couple of yrs now.  I followed some advice from other reviews and add 1 cup sugar 2/3 cup dark brown sugar,  1tsp vanilla and pinch of cinnamon.  This is a show stopper when they get to desert.  Everyone wants to know who made the sweet potato pie and have been requesting orders.  Thanks for this amazing recipe.

I can't keep this around. I always make 2 or more at once or it's gone in one sitting! I also make for picnics or get-togethers to impress friends and family!  This is the absolute BEST pie I have ever eaten.

This sweet potato pie recipe is true to its name: it is very sweet!  I took the advice of another review and used 2/3 brown sugar to mix with the white.  I gave a piece to my mother-in-law who is from New Orleans and she has since asked me to make her a pie just for her!  So in a nutshell, it is very good!

Loved it and so did the family. Some tried it for the first time because others was raving about how good it was. I added a teaspoon of butter nut vanilla like another reviewer said and it turned out really good.

This recipe is lovely, but WAY too sweet for my (non-Southern) taste buds! I halved the sugar (2 cups) but still found it too sweet - next time I make it, I will cut out the corn syrup and reduce the sugar even more to 1 cup only.     Delicious with cream!

Everyone in my family enjoyed this recipe. The only complaint was that it was a little too sweet. I did use 1 cp of white sugar and 2/3's cp of brown sugar and I added 1/4 tsp of cinnamon as some of the others suggested. Overall it was okay. In the future I'm going to decrease some of the white sugar and see if that will make a difference.

Love this recipe! I made it a few months ago, and my family loved it. We live in the south, so we have high expectations for our Sweet Potato pie! :)  But I'm rating it now because I've come back to get the recipe because I'm making it again.

This was great! I gave it to a coworker who is leaving us. He's from the south and he said it was some of the best he'd ever had. I told him it was made with northern hospitality [:  I did add cinnamon to it. Because I wanted too.  This = good.
