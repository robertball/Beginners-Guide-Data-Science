I overcooked my first batch at 16 minutes, and they rose up, didn't spread out.  Finished the rest at 14 minutes, and flattened slightly before going into the oven.  Just a little salty for me, so I'll cut that back to 1 tsp the next time.  Good combination of flavors yielding soft-textured cookies.

Delicious! If you like a cookie that's crunchy outside and chewy inside, these will make you happy. Cranberries and pecans are an awesome combination.

This recipe was very good. The only thing I did different was add WAY less salt (about half a teaspoon) and I could really taste the salt in the finished product but it was *just* right. I also added white chocolate chips and cooked for 16 minutes on an insulated cookie sheet with parchment paper before removing and placing on a cooling rack. Next time I will add a little more cinnamon and I think they would be perfect!

Made as directed. Would probably try adding ginger next time. I cooked mine on silicone baking sheets in my convection oven @350. I started out at 15 min. as others suggested and finally wound up at 13 min and they came out great. Will definitely make again

Very simple recipe and loved the taste. I didn't have eggs on hand, so I substituted a combination of  1 teaspoon of baking soda and 1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar for each egg. I was very surprised to find it didn't affect the taste at all! Also, I used only 1 teaspoon of salt.  Will definitely make again.

Living with a Cookie Monster at home, this cookie is delicious! It is crunchy,chewy, and light. I have an electric oven and baked it for 16 minutes and out came perfection! I agree with the comment of not using too much salt as mentioned in the recipe. I used sea salt and used about 1/2 to a 1 teaspoon. I also used walnuts instead of pecans. This is a great Fall recipe that will not let you down.

Burned the first batch. Itâ€™s better to put them in for less.

I just finished making my second batch. I added an extra teaspoon of vanilla and 1 cup of coconut. For the nuts and cranberries I used a mixture like trail mix called fruit and nut mix. These are soo good.

3/16/19 - substituted whole wheat flour for all purpose. Reduced flour to 1 1/4 cups and supplemented with 1/4 cup of oat bran and flax seed. Used turbinado sugar and reduced by 1/4 cup. Reduced salt by 1/2 tsp. Subbed raisins and walnuts. Subbed 1/4 tsp of ginger and reduced cinnamon to 1/4 tsp. Cooked 20 mins. Crunchier cookie and very wholesome flavor. Sunflower seeds would be a nice addition.

I made the recipe as written.  They turned out great!  Crisp on the outside - nice and chewy. Will keep on my must make again list.  I might increase the cranberries and decrease the cinnamon the next time I make them.

Made no changes however, cooked too long so cookies got too hard.  Agree with others as to salt.  Taste was awesome.

I also reduced salt, subbed some whole wheat flour and Stevia and used up some white chips. They turned out yummy, nice crunchy, chewy at about 15 -16 minutes on parchment, depending on size. I would definitely make again.

These turned out so good. I used white chocolate chips instead of nuts and fresh cranberries...delish!!! The tart of the fresh berries was so good with the sweet of the white chocolate. I had salted butter so only used 3/4tsp salt.
