Baked peppers for 15 minutes and they turned out the way I like them with a slight crunch even with the extra time to melt the cheese on top. Prior to stuffing the peppers I mixed shredded cheese with the meat as well as the top. This is a keeper!

Not bad, for a starter recipe. Chopped the pepper tops, added onion, garlic and cheese. Need to think about seasoning the meat. Will try again.
