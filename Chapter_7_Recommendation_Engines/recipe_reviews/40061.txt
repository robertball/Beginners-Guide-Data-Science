Orange Roughy is an endangered fish and should not be consumed until it has recovered sufficiently from overfishing. Try this recipe with another fish that is not having an large ecoclogical impact on the environment.

I used 2 tbsp orange juice and 1 tbsp lemon juice (not fresh squeezed), and the flavor was still fantastic.  Very light and delicious!  We enjoy having this with French Green Beans from this site.

Speedy, excellent, healthy entree.  Use plenty of fresh-squeezed orange and lemon juice (also try lime...very good).  The juice will reduce in the frying pan to form a wonderful subtle-flavored sauce.  Don't use store-bought orange juice...when reduced it tastes much too strong, almost like marmalade, and will take away from the natural flavor of the fish.

Great base recipe. I tweaked it a bit. First I added Old Bay, salt and ground black pepper to all purpose flour and coated fish in it. Used 3 clementines (only oranges I had), half lemon and quarter of a lime. Added fresh lemon basil (had no lemon pepper) with some cilantro to the juice before pouring it over the fish in the skillet. Added fresh garlic to the oil and a little lemon basil too prior to putting fish in it. Added ground peppercorns to fish in the pan. Great sauce, can also use on tilapia. Will double the juice contents if using clementines again as I would've liked more of the sauce - used 2 fillets (approx 1lb).

Easy recipe. Great way to prepare fish. I didn't have an orange but I did have some dried orange peel which worked great in place of the juice. I look forward to trying this with fresh caught crappie, bass, and catfish we are able to catch from the nearby lakes.

This was a nice light sauce on a delicious fish. So sad that it's my last serving of orange roughy. I didn't realize that it was overharvested until I looked for a recipe for the fish that was already in my freezer. Guess I can always prepare another fish this way, perhaps tilapia as others suggested?

I tried this recipe last night and the flavors are mind blowing. I used 2 pieces of tilapia and the juice from 1 lemon, 1 lime, 1 orange and lemon pepper Mrs. Dash. I paired it with sauteed bok choy and brown rice. Really a quick tasty meal.

This recipe is delicious! I had never heard of Orange Roughy before until I went to the grocery store looking for salmon and they were out. The guy at the fish counter told me about this fish and gave me a garlic recipe (verbally), which I forgot once I got home.  I looked up Orange Roughy on here and found this recipe!  My husband LOVES this recipe and it is my go-to recipe because it is so quick an easy, and there is virtually no clean-up.  I use orange juice (rather than an orange)and lemon juice from a container (rather than a lemon), and lemon pepper, and that is it! I have made this recipe for friends and family and it has been a hit.  Thank you for sharing your recipe, it has been added to mine, and is now one of my staple recipes!

I'm not a big fish fan, but I liked this.  I was surprised that my fish-loving husband thought it was too tart.  I didn't have any fresh lemons, so used bottled and seasoned with a little S&P.  Would make again, but maybe cut down on the lemon juice & DEFINITELY use fresh.

This is a very tasty, healthy and unusual sauce for fish.  It was easy and quick to make.  My husband and I enjoyed this recipe very much.  I used orange juice with pulp, lemon and 1 lime.  I will definitely make this again.

I never cooked orange roughy before and was looking for a recipe and came across this one.  I wish I could rate it higher - it was perfect! I didn't have any fresh oranges or lemons so I just used juice I had on hand and it was great. I also have tried this on shrimp and that worked well too. Garnish with a slice of orange and it looks so pretty on the plate too! Thank you for sharing! :)

Ok...I overcooked it.....but that's not why the 3 stars.....lacked flavor. In addition to the recipe ingredients,  I added some fresh lemon zest and some garlic powder right before baking .....still lacking.  Served with fresh baby spinach sauteed in olive oil and fresh garlic ....that I thought saved the meal. I did use cod instead of roughy. Prolly wont make again ...sorry.

We were looking for a healthy but flavorful way of enjoying orange roughy and this was perfect! We loved it and it will a regular in our rotation. May follow others suggestions and try with lime juice and cilantro also.

This was extremely easy to make and really good. I did add a couple of sprinkles of rosemary to it ans some asparagus in the pan with it, and it was delicious. I actually think I will start cooking my asparagus this way instead of the garlic all the time

Fantastic with any type of flaky white fish, i.e. flounder, tilapia, even grouper.  I like to heat the oil in a large saute pan, cook the fish about 4 minutes over med-high heat until just browning, then flip, pour the juice over it, cover and remove for heat. In about 5 minutes, it's perfect every time. The 'sauce' is fantastic over rice, quinoa or couscous straight up, reduced or thickened with a little corn starch.  Works great with lemon or lime juice, whatever's on hand.  Love this recipe and it's so simple even the kids can make it.  Thank you!!!

Rate the recipe, not the fish.... Orange roughy probably is not the best choice, but not 'endangered'... Except in Australia.... I suggest swai...

It was good. Not great. It was easy, convenient and cheap. Cub foods has frozen wild caught Orange Roughy from Canada, nice. I can't give it 5 stars because it's not a restaurant quality recipe. It's adequate, not complex or mouthwatering, but it's good. I'd make it again because it's healthy and convenient and my UBER-picky 4 year old loved it.

This Was Very Good And Easy.  The Only Changes I Made Where To Cook Up 12oz Frozen Orange Roughy. When The Fish Was Done Cooking I Placed It On A Plate And I Added A Small Amount Of Argo Gravy Thickner To The Orange And Lemon Sauce, To Thicking A Little. And Poured It Over The Fish. This Recipe Was Good And Very Easy. Side Dish Was Frozen Creamed Spinach , And I Had A Fast, Easy, Healthy Meal.  With Little Clean Up (Yeah) Thank You So Much From Florida!!

Explosive taste buds. This was very healthy and very tasty. I didn't have an orange so I used 2 Tbsp. orange concentrate. I put the lemon pepper on the fillets and let them set for 10 minutes and then fried in a little bit of olive oil on med/high. After browning both sides, I put on the lemon/orange sauce and cooked on medium to reduce the liquid. It was so excellent and I served it with quinoa/mushroom dish from this site. The fish had a beautiful orange glaze on it. They complimented each other so well.  One of my favorite healthy dinners!

Very nice, easy, tasty recipe. I baked the orange roughy rather than fried it. The flavor of the fish really stood out. Lime juice instead of lemon juice might be a bit tastier.

I followed the recipe exactly. It was honestly the best fish dinner I've ever had. - and I actually made it myself! This was the first recipe I've tried from this website. It was so good and so easy to make. If I can have this recipe turn out so wonderfully well, anyone can! :) Thanks for sharing this recipe. ~I'll be making this often!

This was a great recipe. I couldn't find orange roughy, so I substituted with tilapia. It turned out great. The first time I made the recipe, I used the lemon pepper seasoning and it was kind of bland, so this time I used Montreal chicken seasoning. It was absolutely wonderful. My guests loved the recipe. The next evening I made fish tacos with the left overs and added creole seasoning. Yummy!!!!!

I made this recipe in an "emergency" situation where I found myself with some roughy on hand and no plan for how to fix it. Seems most other fish recipes on this site called for heavy cream, which I didn't have. I used one whole (but very small) orange, one whole lemon and half a lime. This made quite a bit of juice  for three very good sized filets. The juice took a bit to reduce down but by the time it reduced, the fish was done so no problem there. Seasoned the fish with Old Bay, some dried dill weed and black pepper (as I didn't have the lemon pepper on hand either). I was  very pleasantly surprised by this recipe. I was worried it would be dull, but it really had a good amount of flavor without overpowering the fish. FYI, I used Trader Joe's white roughy (found in the freezer section)which is simply divine and a must try if you haven't had it yet. This dish was perfect for a summer night dinner. My husband said he could easily use this sauce for shore lunches on his next fishing trip with the guys.

This recipe was pretty good but not really memorable in my book.  I used wild whitefish fillets instead of orange roughy and followed the recipe as written, although I found I had so much juice that it was more like pour the juice over rather than drizzle.  I turned my fillets partway through and they cooked very nicely in the citrus.  I think next time I will remove the fish and then reduce the pan juices, hoping for more of a syrup.  I'll also add cilantro like someone else mentioned.  Nice and healthy, that's for sure!

I used cod since orange roughy is endangered. I looked up what else to use instead, and cod was one of the options. I'm not sure what I did wrong, but the favors just didn't taste that good. Maybe it was the fish itself, Idk. I won't make again.

I have made this twice; the first time with Minneola tangerine, the second with navel orange.  My husband did not get to taste it the first time, my parents and I loved it.  I was afraid my husband would not like it since he is a hard core fishy fish lover, but he did!  The preparation is a cinch, the flavor is fresh and delightful.  This  is a refreshing change from the old reliable dill or Old Bay spices.

It has a subtle yet delicious flavor.  Best to serve with rice and steamed veggies to bring out the flavor in the fish.  The recipe is extremely simple but does the trick!  Great for a quick meal.

This is super easy and the sauce is very tasty.  I used frozen roughy fillets and I think I need to try it again with fresh...no fault of the recipe, simply the fish.  I would use this sauce on other mile fillets in a heartbeat.  Thanks for the recipe.

Great, healthy, easy.  I used 2 Tablespoons orange juice and 1 Tablespoon lemon juice instead of the fresh orange and lemon.  Not a lot of sauce, but enough for good flavor.  Dinner was ready in literally 10 minutes!

Very good, but I think it needs a little more seasoning.  It was a little blah.  I ended up adding some basil, garlic, and a little seasoned salt. Other than that it was a good start to an excellent meal.

I did not know orange roughy was being overfished, so I am using the rest of my frozen roughy and will purchase another white fish to make this yummy recipe again. I hope it tastes as good with tilapia.

Very easy!! I didnt have orange roughy so i used flounder instead, flounder is a thinner fish so i used less orange and lemon and it still came out very good. I got my husband who will not eat fish to eat this so that was great.

I baked it instead of using the skillet. I put it in a 9"x13" dish, some olive oil on the bottom, baked at 350 for about 20+ minutes, but don't over cook or it gets too dry, better to be moist. It was delicious! Absolutely perfect!

Love it! The fish is so moist and the taste is light so it does not cover the taste of the fish.

This recipe was absolutely phenomenal! It was easily made, and was quite quick. I followed the recipe here exactly, continually spooning the lemon-orange juice-lemon pepper mixture in the skillet back over the fish as it cooked, and had just enough juice left over. Thanks for the fabulous recipe!

My co-worker and I used this recipe on the ship we work at and the crew loved it. Insted of pouring the juice onto the fish we let it marinade in it for about an hour. Im sure more time would have made it even better.

It turned out moist and delicate but I had to add a little more seasoning because I new it would be bland otherwise.  I added freshly grated sea salt, some fresh lemon basil and fresh dill, also a little more freshly ground pepper.  I really enjoyed it.

A very quick, easy, and tasty way to prepare your fish!  It's great with a variety of white fish, whichever you have on hand.  I brought a ton of ripe lemons and oranges home from a Florida trip and this was a good way to use some instead of just making juice!

This recipe was very simple and tasty. Like others suggested I floured the filets first. I also sauted some garlic in the oil first before putting in the fish.  I will make it again.

This was so simple and quick and had terrific flavor. I love fish, but orange roughy in particular has always been a favorite. The recipe doesn't specify how much lemon or orange to use. I used a medium lemon and large orange and thought it was perfect. You won't be dissapointed with this recipe.

This was delicious!!  I did tweak it a little bit-I dredged the fillets in seasoned flour, sauteed them in the olive oil until golden, then added the citrus juices and let it cook a bit.  I also cut out the dark fish fles before cooking as I find that is what gives it a strong or fishy taste.

Absolutely delicious simple sauce.  I made the sauce with a little marjoram, sage, and a touch of butter in a pot and reduced it a bit.  I cooked the fish on the grill for a few minutes per side, basting it with the sauce.  Rave reviewsfrom all.

Very nice glaze for a firm white fish. I used corvina (akin to Atlantic drum) and followed a couple of mentioned recommendations (old bay on the fish, fresh basil and  garlic in the oil). Paired it with roasted root veggies  and sauted zucchini shreds. Delicious.

Made this using Cod and it was so easy and delicious. Served with Pan-Fried Asparagus from this site. In fact, I made the fish in the same pan I used for the Asparagus. Will be making again!

This was pretty good. I used orange juice and lemon juice (the kind in the bottle) and it still tuned out great. I also used a little butter along with the olive oil. My seven year old even liked it. I would make again

This was tastey but didn't make enough sauce. I liked it but my husband didn't. I usually make mine with just lemon so I believe it may have been a little too flavorful for him.

I loved the orange/lemon sauce. However, after trying Orange Roughy for the first time, I have realized I don't care for it. So next time I think I will try this with a different white fish. Super easy though!

ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!! My husband made homemade lemon pepper and we followed the directions exactly (except we used at least a tablespoon of the lemon pepper).  I can't say enough good things about this!  Cooked it for about 7 min...until the sauce started to thicken a bit.  My 21month old son even loved it, and he won't usually eat ANYTHING new!  We served this with organic quinoa with no additional seasoning added. TRY THIS, YOU'LL LOVE IT!

I didn't like the lemon pepper addition but I might have put too much. I actually flipped my filets over after three minutes and sprinkled the lemon pepper on both sides. Don't recommend. I served over Jasmine rice which was great. I added a little ground cayenne pepper to both. Super easy but will probably not make again. It wasn't bad I just found the citrus flavor overwhelming.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.  I had the orange roughy and didn't know what to do with it.  So I checked out this site for something quick, easy and ingredients that I had on hand.  I also used orange juice and lemon juice.  My kids did not like the fish.  They usually eat it (not so much because they love it) but because they have to have a little bit.  But tonight they wouldn't eat it.  I don't know why.  I think the citrus was a bit much for them.  I will definitely make this for my husband and myself again!

My husband and son said this tastes as good as a dish from a high end restaurant!  Using homestyle type orange juice instead of juicing an orange makes this a very quick and easy recipe.

My husband and I love Orange Roughy, but this recipe was a bit sour. Normally I put lime in just about every fish recipe, but I think the OJ and lime was a little too much. However, we ate the finished meal and won't be turned away!

I just got finished eating this tonight. Some how it came out a little salty. I didn't add any salt at all either. Not sure how or what caused it but I did have some help in the kitchen and that always throws me off a bit...will give an update when I try this again..but there were some parts that weren't as salty and they were magnificent.

This is a really good recipe. I thought the sauce we delicious, and I will try it on other things also. I used bottled oj and lemon juice and a little citrus seasoning ( I did not have the lemon pepper seasoning) I used more than it called for and it turned out great with enough sauce leftover to pour on the fish.   A very yummy, light dish.

This was awesome!! I added fresh Lime Juice and was very pleased, tried it with Salmon also add was very good. My wife and kids loved it, oh yeah, and so did I. It left a nice sauce that I poured over the fish once it was on the plate. This will be a repeat recipe in our home.

Depending on the oranges, this sauce can be a little sweet; it also coagulates rapidly, leaving an unattractive plating.It worked fine on tilapia and was okay on local trout, but watch the oranges.

Made this recipe exactly as is. It did have a lot of citrus flavor, but that's not necessarily a bad thing (look at the name of the recipe, lol). I'm not sure what it was, perhaps I just don't like Orange Roughy or maybe it was the actual fish that we bought. That's why I'm giving it a 4 and not 3 stars.

This was just okay.  After reading reviews, wanted to make sure I didn't over-do the juices and probably could have used more.  A little bland.  We'll give it one more try.

Very good and so easy. My only suggestions to the recipe are to add salt to taste and provide measurements of the orange and lemon juice, as these vary greatly by the size and quality of the fruit. I used small fruits for my version, and it turned out just right for us. I made three different types of fish (perch, orange roughy, and tilapia) to see which I preferred.  I thought the orange roughy was best by a mile, but the others would be fine in a pinch. My husband preferred the perch.

I will give this a three because the sauce was good especially after it reduced and got thick. The fish on the other hand......YUCK it was my first time having orange roughy I wish someone would have said how fishy it tastes. I would however use the sauce on tilapia or maybe tuna steaks.

This was the easiest to make. It was one of the best fish recipies I have made. My husband who is picky when it comes to fish even liked it. I had to use talapia because I couldn't find oarnge roughy. I can't wait to try it with oarnge roughy.

This was really good and so simple. I think I had enough lemon/orange juice for 8 pieces of fish. I only used about half of the juice for 4 pieces. I might like to try this again accept this time under the broiler instead of pan-frying.

TOTALLY delicious!! I minced shallots and sauteed them in the olive oil first, and also added in some minced fresh ginger, which added a nice flavor.

Quick and easy to prepare. I added cilantro to the fish as it finished frying in the pan and it turned out great!  Definitely don't skimp on the lemon and orange juices.  It's a great way to get in your helping of fish.

This is a lovely, simple, delicate way to prepare a QUICK but yummy dish for your family.  We try to eat fish a few times a week and this will definitely be a keeper.  The fish went from pan to plate in less than ten minutes.  Phenomenal!  The taste was fresh and citrusy without being overpowering at all.    Can't wait to try it on the grill when the weather warms up.  Bet it would be good on chicken, too, with some fresh cilantro.  Mmmmmmmm!  Thanks!

Wow! A perfect combination of sweet-citris and fish.  I hate fish, but eat it for health reasons, and now I will look forward to eating it.  I used a large naval orange (juiced) and 1/4 C of commercial lemon juice.  It took much longer for my fillet to cook...about fifteen minutes, which was nice, because the juices thickened up real nice and stuck to the fish better.  I served it with brown rice, green beans, and vinegared-tomato slices.  Yum, Yum!

Very simple! Gave the fish a rich and incredibly buttery texture. Though, the orange flavor was barely present.

I used this recipe on tilapia. It was a good flavor. However, I don't recommend adding the lemon/orange juice prior to cooking the fish. Brown the fish first, then add the juices. This will keep you from over cooking the fish.

It's probably not fair to give this one star, because I didn't use orange roughy, but I wouldn't used a fished-out species.  I used Pacific cod, and it came out very bland.  Perhaps not enough lemon, but I covered it well with lemon pepper.  Still bland.  Oh, well.

Very good and super easy.  Didn't have an orange, so I used orange juice.  And I didn't have lemon pepper, but used a spice mix I had on hand (Indochina Seasoning).  The combination was fantastic!

My first time making any recipe with this fish and it was absolutely fantastic.  Insanely easy to make and truly delicious.  My kids (2 & 5) gobbled it up and asked for more.  I need to buy more next time so I can go back for seconds like they did.

I did make this in a cast iron skillet which I strongly recommend.  It created a lovely sear on it.  I put it on high to get all the juice to evaporate, then lowered the heat to medium or so to get the sear and allow it to cook through.  It probably took 10-15 minutes, not 5.

Absolutely loved it!  So easy!  I had about 24 oz of Orange Roughy fish.  Instead of juicing an orange and lemon, I simply used 5 Tbl of Orange Juice and 3 Tbl of Lemon Juice.  If you had exactly a pound of fish, you could probably do 3 Tbl OJ and 2 Tbl of Lemon juice.  I didn't have lemon pepper so I just lightly dusted with regular black pepper. Definitely going into the dinner rotation!

Will be making this again soon.  My wife is not a big fish eater so I am trying to get her to try a lot of different fish with sauces and she loved this recipe.  She says she will be requesting that again soon.  I am sure it has nothing to do with the fact I was the cook and not her.

This was super easy to prepare and as a guy that doesn't really enjoy cooking, even I can do it in no time flat, and it turned out absolutely brilliant. We will definitely be making this again!!!

Wow, so good! I put some garlic cloves in with everything else. I also sliced some butter and put it on top of the fish. Then covered the pan until the fish flaked. I never thought of adding some Old Bay Seasoning, like someone else suggested. I will have to try that next time! I remember my grandmother making orange roughy for me. The taste always brings back great memories.

Husband went on and on about this!  It is fool proof!  I'm a decent cook but not great and fish is not my strong point.  My husband (who's trying to watch his cholesterol) kept asking how much butter I put in this to make it so good and buttery.  He was shocked when I told him none, just a tiny drizzle of olive oil in the pan.  Just put oil then fish in pan, poured juice of one lemon and one orange over top, shook on some lemon pepper and let it simmer until it was flakey.  I did grate a little of the orange and lemon peel into the juice.  Couldnt be easier!

We really liked this recipe, I've made it a few times. I made no changes except for adding a few sprinkles of lemon pepper. Fantastic!

I really liked it, I did not think it would be so flavorful! I used lime instead of lemons. I also used sea salt, pepper, and Mrs. Dashes to marinate for about 10 minutes.  Then I cooked the fish a little and then added the orange/lime blend. Went great with peas/carrots mix (using the marinade from the fish) and some white rice (not my favorite, but I needed something quick).  I would like to try it again when I can marinate it a little longer with the juices!

I cant believe how good this was.  There was this awesome juice left on the pan after baking it and we added that to my already seasoned rice.  Nothing left afterwards.  So good.  Oh and I baked it instead and added two tablespoons of butter to the sauce before baking because everything is better with butter.

Pretty good flavor.  I was suprised at the consistency when it was all done.  Would use this recipe again as a change of pace when it comes to fish.

I used tilapia and it was great. We don't like fish too much but the combo of the orange and lemon juice was great AND we added more lemon-pepper. It's the first fish I was able to get my toddler to eat too (and we thought she just didn't like fish)! Thanks so much.

To die for! This sauce was so flavorful and tasted rich. It is low fat, and almost sinful at the same time.

Very good - the citrus is not overwhelming but makes the fishy tasty.  This gets extra points for being so easy.

This was wonderful and easy.  It gave the fish a buttery texture.  I'm making it again tonight for the second time in 10 days!!
