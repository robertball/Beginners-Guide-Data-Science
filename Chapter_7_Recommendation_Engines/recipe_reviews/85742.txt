LOVE this!  Made it for a work potluck and a family party (summertime, latin theme) and after they got over seeing the "green stuff" floating and tasted it, everyone wanted the recipe.  Fresh and tangy!

Perfect!!!  The jalapeno (1) was just enough for a little kick.  Did not taste the mint leaves, will add more next time.  Delicious!!

Delicious!  It was sweet at first, but then had a kick at the end.  We used two jalapeños, but it drowned out the mint flavor.  Will use again!

LOVED this with a few big modifications: used only 1/4 cup sugar and 1 tbs powdered stevia (a naturally no-calorie herbal sweetener), and juiced 12 limes instead of 4. Our jalapeno was very potent, and we only left it in for about half an hour. It was perfectly sweet, tart, and spicy! Yum!

This was a fantastically refreshing adult limeade.  I served it with my special egg salad on croissants for a light meal since the weather is so warm here.  One could add their favorite vodka or tequila for a unique cocktail!

Made this for a Cinco de Mayo potluck at work today, fabulous! Everyone loved it! Very unique, crisp, and refreshing. I doubled the recipe and used one very large jalapeno (seeds removed).

Delicious! However, if I were to make it again, I would only use 1/2 a jalapeno, since I don't handle spice very well, but it was still delicious.

Awesome recipe! I added another mint sprig and decreased the jalapeno. I also cut down on the sugar a bit and thought it was perfect.

I used frozen limeade. 4 lg cans + 2 cans water each. One 2 liter bottle club soda added just before serving. You need at least 5 mint leaves muddled per can to even taste it. I used 2 jalapeños, seeded and sliced overnight. Not enough. Soooo,  I seeded another one, ran it in the processor, dumped it in and stuck it back in the fridge or another couple of hours & strained it right before serving. It was the hit of the party.

This drink kicks really nicely.  The jalapeño was a surprise, it makes you sip the drink.

Tasted kind of medicinal.  No kick at the end, but I could definitely taste the jalapenos.  Mainly, it wasa just sweet.

Yum!  I made it for 30. Used lots of fresh mint from the garden (about two cups), one jalapeño, 4 “real” limes, 4 frozen cans of lime aid with appropriate water, and a bottle of Trader Joe’s jalapeña lime aid ‘cause I had it on hand. Marinated the pepper, mint, and frozen lime aid for 7 hours, then added water/ice. No sugar as it’s already in the frozen lime aid. Huge hit!  This would be a great mix with tequila or gin or vodka too!

This is such an interesting drink!  Just go easy on the jalapeño, check to see how spicy it is first, unless you like super spicy stuff.
