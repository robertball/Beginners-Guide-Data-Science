Super easy and a HUGE hit w/ my family! They do tend to LOVE anything 'buffalo', so I knew they were gonna love this. I did use chicken tenders, so I checked them after cooking on low for about 4-1/2 hours and they were done, so I put them on warm for about an hour and then shredded them...perfectly tender, moist and flavorful! After shredding, I did spoon a bit of the sauce over it so it would stay moist and that worked great. topped each wrap w/ some of the cooking juice (which was delicious) and a bit of shredded cheddar. This is a keeper, for sure~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

Such a success with everyone!!  Definitely a crowd pleaser.  I used a buffalo wing sauce instead of tabasco (Frank's wing sauce).  A whole bottle and a packet of ranch dressing seasoning.  Also added some blue cheese crumbles in the wrap.  I wrapped the lettuce and meat in tortilla wraps and cut them into thirds. YUM!

This is awesome, and super easy! I used Frank's Buffalo sauce and served on tortillas with blue cheese dressing, lettuce, tomato, and Gorgonzola crumbles. I will be making this frequently from now on. Thanks for sharing!

This is a keeper for us! Using a whole bottle of hot sauce, I was afraid that they would be too hot to eat. They were fairly mild on heat but big on flavor. A spoon of the reserved sauce was great and and slight squirt of Sriracha on top along with Crema Mexicana (Mexican style sour cream) worked great.

I have been making this recipe for many years.  For those who complained about saltiness, I found 1/2 a packet of of dressing mix is enough to get the flavor and reduce some of the salty taste.  I also found that boneless skinless thighs are not as dry.  I usually serve this with blue cheese coleslaw.

I used two 1lb chicken breasts, 1/5 of a red and white onion, 1/4 of a red, green, and yellow bell pepper sliced into thirds, a bottle of sweet baby ray's buffalo wing sauce, 1/3 bottle of Frank's hot wing sauce,  and a packet of ranch mix.  This was just like eating a hot wing without having to fidget with a bone.  My family loved it.  I will definitely make it again.

This was a big hit with my friends and family at our gathering.  It was easy and full of flavor but you may want to make double the amount. It was gone fast.

I am a big fan of Buffalo everything. I made this for SuperBowl and had a ton leftover. It just wasnt well received.

While its on the healthier side of buffalo items, it was just too vinegary from the red hot. I think you need some sort of fat to level it out, whether its ranch or butter (like they use when making wings).

Tried this recipe tonight.  We are both cutting carbs and calories and it looked promising.  We absolutely loved it.  It was a little hotter than I like (I won't add any additional sauce next time)  but my husband loved it.  It would work great in enchiladas, tacos, or on a bun.  Will definitely make it again.

LOVED this recipe! I quickly shredded the chicken using a hand mixer. One of my relatives is a chef, and these wraps got his approval.  He ate 10 of them! I will definitely make this again.

If you make this with Red Hot (or another regular hot sauce), it is waaaaay too salty. If you make it with Frank's Buffalo Wing sauce (or another Buffalo sauce), it's perfect.

Whole family loved this. I made it with a non spicy buffalo sauce for the kids. The family had it in lettuce cups but also grabbed some flour tortillas and put it in there. And talk about easy!!!

My very picky eaters ate it and loved it.  You can decrease the amount of sauce you add after it is cooked for those that don't like spicy food.  An option that adds more substance is to make it with the lettus and than wrap it in a tortilla.  For those of us that limit carbs, the lettus works great. This would make a simple, easy potluck dish.

I made this with pork loin since this was the meat I had on hand, it came out a bit dry, but was still good, - you can add sour cream, etc. To your sandwich or wrap to moisten it up and I was able to shred the meat.  The cooking sauce was very salty, so you have to be careful how much sauce you add to the meat when adding to a sandwich...  Nice recipe though, I probably will try again using chicken as was intended.  If you are a Frank's Hot sauce lover, you've got to try this.

Yum yum yummm! So easy, so tasty! I used 1/2 chick breast and 1/2 chicken thighs (both boneless/skinless) because that’s what I had on hand. Cooked on high for a couple of hours then turned it to low.Was hot and ready for a lunchtime family gathering on a very busy day. Will absolutely make it again!

I will open with noting that I love hot sauce, shake it on much of my food and have at least a dozen varieties which I rotate for daily use.  For this recipe, I made a half recipe and followed the instructions and measurement adjustments exactly, using Frank's Hot Sauce. The chicken was way, way too salty and I cannot imaging adding any of the reserved strained liquid from the crock pot juices. In order to avoid discarding the whole batch, I mixed the chicken with a bar of cream cheese, a couple tablespoons of blue cheese dressing and a small amount of blue cheese, to make a dip. I might give this another try with either buffalo sauce, instead of the hot sauce, or possibly reducing the hot sauce and adding enough water to cover the chicken.  Or possibly using a salt free homemade ranch dressing mix, because Hidden Valley is loaded with additional salt.  Somehow, despite my love of all things buffalo / hot sauce related, this wasn't a success for me.

This was (a) easy peasy and (b) delicious! My only criticism is that it's a bit salty, but that's easily cut with lettuce, cheese, and other toppings.

Made this for my wife. I took the advice of using only half a pouch of ranch. Placed the lettuce on a bed of white rice and used old cheddar to top it off. Excellent dinner. A definite choice for another dinner.

I'm eating low carb trying to drop 15lbs by 4th of July.  Made this with a few changes.  I only added 2tsp of the ranch mix as 1/2tsp of it has 1 carb. The whole package had 16 carbs and that was too much for me.  I also added 1/2 stick of butter to cut the heat and add fat since you need fat while low carbing.  Turned out really good.  Chicken was tender (I think the butter helped) and flavorful.  I put extra sauce on top once spooned into the lettuce and ate about 4 of them.  Will keep this in my low carb rotation.  If you like buffalo and are trying to eat healthy I would give this a try, you won't be disappointed.

You know this dip, you've had it a 1000 times before. This version works well, too. I like the lettuce variant instead of chips.

It's a long life. I'm sure I'll see this again.

I made no changes.  It was too hot for my friend and myself but that was just our personal preference.  My only problem was getting the shredded chicken to stay in the  lettuce.  Probably won't try this one again.

It was way too salty!  Couldn't eat it in the lettuce wrap because of the saltiness.

I did it almost exactly as the recipe but I only had 1 - 1/2 ounce package of ranch so I also added 1 - 1/2 ounce package of green onion dip. This was so easy and even though it was a bit salty I loved it, but I'm a salt-o-holic! Used the Franks Red Hot Sauce. Now I have lunch and dinner for the next couple of weeks. Since I do low carb I made lettuce wraps!

I'm sorry, but I didn't like this dish at all. The chicken was moist and shredded nicely, but the sauce contained so much vinegar that it's all I could taste!  My husband thought it was okay.
