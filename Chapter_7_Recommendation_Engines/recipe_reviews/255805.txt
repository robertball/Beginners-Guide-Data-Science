I thought it was odd that the recipe didnâ€™t list a leavening agent so I added some baking powder to the batter.   The next time I make this I will put it in tall custard cups, making smaller individual desserts.   The flavor is excellent and the texture was wonderful.

It was delicious !  
The only changes I made are adding 1/2 tsp of baking powder and using  pumpkin pie spice (about 3/4 tsp)
instead of all the spices.
I served it with a little whipped cream on top.
Also, I mixed the dough in a  measuring bowl and divided it into 2 mugs. 
I will definitely make it again.

I really didn't enjoy it. Maybe it just needs some tweaks or its just me.

So awesome but add 1/2 tsp baking powder. Also if you cook 2 at once it will take about 5 minutes.

I added 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda, but apart from that addition it was so delicious! It was really easy to make and I will definitely use this recipe again.

The flavor was really really good! However, the end result was super gummy.

This is a great recipe. My husband is never fond of the mug cakes but pumpkin is his sweet spot and he loved it. Will for sure make again. I did add 1/2 tsp baking soda and served with whip cream. Next time I will add 1/4 cup chocolate chips and maybe nuts.

YUMMY!!! Because of food allergies, I subbed maple syrup for the brown sugar (and didn't add the white sugar), used only an egg yolk, and used only cinnamon for the spice. I also added 1/8 t salt. The extra liquid required a microwave time of 2 min 30 sec. LOVE it!!!
