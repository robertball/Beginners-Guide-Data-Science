this came out great , but did cut down on the sugar. 3/4 sugar and 1 c brown sugar , the sweetness was just right and instead of 1 c milk I added 1 c. greek style yogurt , really moist.

The picture was not of a sheet cake. What was with the mini  bundt cakes? And if this recipe can be made that way, how long are they baked?

I was looking  for a yellow cake that wasn't as dense as a pound cake and used whole eggs.  This fit the bill.  I made the cake exactly as written and baked in mini fluted tube pan.  The cake didn't brown much on top, but the texture was good.  I missed salt and would add that next time.  I followed others advice and reduced sugar to 1 cup for frosting.  Came out great.  It was my first time making boiled frosting and I liked the marshmallow fluff-esque texture that also held it's shape when piped.  Thanks for this recipe!  It's a keeper

This cake was very well received by adults and kids when I made it for my Mother's 65th birthday. I did make a change that was necessary due to items on hand. I was out of vanilla extract so I used pure almond extract in the cake. This change made the cake taste like a Madeline. I also took the previous reviewers recommendation and reduced the brown sugar to 1 cup packed in the frosting, as I do not like over sweet frosting. I did use vanilla extract in the frosting.  I decorated with toasted almond only as raisins do not go over well with most of my family.  I also shared a bit of the history of the cake.
