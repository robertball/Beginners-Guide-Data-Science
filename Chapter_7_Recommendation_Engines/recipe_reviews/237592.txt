Love it. Put 1 cup tomato juice and 1 water. I think I'll replace the water with ice cubes next time. Lemon juice because I didn't have a lemon. Thats the best thing about sharing reviews...it helps us all!

So, I just thought I had enough kale.  Didn't have radishes so my comprimise was a polblano pepper and 1/2 the kale.  Wow.  Can't wait to try the original version.
