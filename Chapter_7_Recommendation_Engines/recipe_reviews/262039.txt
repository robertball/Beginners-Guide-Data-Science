Made as written and this turned out pretty good. I made a similar recipe to this yesterday as well and they both had their pluses. What I liked better about this recipe was the sesame oil and the green onions. What I liked better about the other is that it used brown sugar instead of white which really added to the flavor and color of the finished roast. Overall this was a good recipe but if I were to make again I'd use brown sugar and more soy sauce. Oh and mine was plenty done in 8 hours on low.
