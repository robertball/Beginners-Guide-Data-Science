I made these for my boyfriend - a dark chocoholic - for Valentine's Day.  He loved them and couldn't stop eating them.  He didn't believe me when I told them I'd made them myself.  He said they looked "professionally made".  I finally had to take him to my house and show him the dirty chocolate covered dishes in my dishwasher to prove to him I made them.  I went a little crazy.  I divided the chocolate/cream mixture into 3 bowls.  I added mint extract to one batch, almond extract to another and left the third plain.  I put a whole almond in the middle of some of the truffles as I rolled them.  I dipped some in milk chocolate, some in white chocolate and drizzled them with the opposite color chocolate.  Some were rolled in ground almonds, others had chopped nuts sprinkled on the top immediately after being dipped in chocolate, others were rolled in powdered sugar, cinnamon, or cocoa.  Use your imagination - this recipe is really hard to screw up!  Be careful when rolling the truffles into balls, though.  Those suckers are slippery - I dropped the first few on the floor until I got the hang of it.  Be prepared for a chocolatey mess on your hands but a LOT of fun!

Oh yum!!!! We had friends over last night for a Valentines Day lobster dinner. For dessert I made chocolate fondue. What to do with the leftover chocolate? Make Truffles, that's what you do!!!! I coated some with coconut and some with cocoa powder. Delicious!

i tried this recipe to appease some chocohalics, and it was great. here are some ideas, instant coffee in the cream, makes mocha, and the recipe works with any flavor chips, they are wonderful dipped in chocolate covering. my favorite combo was the dark mocha cinnamon truffle. BE CREATIVE!

These were overall pretty good, but they need to be cooled in the fridge at least 4 hours

Super simple and great flavor. I used a number of different coatings (coconut, chopped pecans, powdered sugar, colored sprinkles) and each family member picked a different coating as their favorite! Romantic, kid friendly, and easy to make. What else do you need?!
