I made this for a casual dinner party and it was a hit.  I made it as written except I used reduced-fat sour cream and cheese; it was still quite flavorful.  I used a medium-heat salsa in the recipe; it was too spicy for the small kids but those of us who love a lot of heat needed to add some extra hot salsa on top.  I also served with fresh guacamole for topping, YUM!! Based on all the great reviews, I went ahead and put together an extra casserole to freeze for later, and I'm so glad I did!

This was very good, my husband and I both really liked it. I did use flour tortillas instead of the corn ones which made it better. We also thought that next time I make it I will put a layer of refried beans and guacamole in it. We think it will make it even better. Good Recipe!!!!

Fabulous casserole...my husband and his friends loved it!  We topped the hot casserole with lettuce, fresh tomatoes, and sour cream...Really easy to mix up and throw in the oven...and it works well to add what you like and leave out what you don't.  I will make it again!

This was an absolute hit! I did make some variations. I omitted the chili pepper and cayenne pepper because I knew the taco seasoning would give it enough heat plus I planned on using a medium heat salsa. I also used bell pepper, red onion, and green chillies in with the ground beef until they began to sweat.
I added some taco sauce into the salsa for additional flavor but was mindful in using mild taco sauce. I also added some white pepper to the meat as well to counteract the salt in the packaged taco seasoning.
Next time I go to make it ... and I will be making it again! I plan on mixing the sour cream into the beef mixture once the beef is cooked. It seems to me that it would make more sense and make it easier if I just stirred the sour cream into my beef mixture for easier layering and to get a better consistency of the sour cream.
I used 8" flour tortillas for a 9x13" baking dish and to aide in layering and to give it better layering I did fold some in half placing the straight edges along the pan. 
I placed a dallop of sour cream on the side once it was ready to be served and cut up some fresh chives and garnished the sour cream with the chives. And then served up a fresh side of corn bread muffins.
I plan on also trying this with chicken. I think it would taste just as well if not better!!!
My husband said it was like a big juicy taco and my daughter actually gave me a big hug telling me thank you for such an awesome meal :O)

Very good! Depending on the type of seasoning adding two packets can make it very salty. Great with flour tortillas. I used a 9 inch x 3 inch round pan and put large tortillas in it and it was easier because I only needed one to cover the layers.

YUMMY!!!! This was a nice twist to traditional italian lasagna. I took the suggestion of another reviewer and did mine in a round pan so that I only needed 1 tortilla per layer. But make sure your pan is deep enough or otherwise use two pans. I used flour tortillas instead of corn simply because my family isnt a fan of the corn ones. I also blended two heaping tablespoons of cream cheese into the sour cream to add a bit of sweetness to the dish!! And of course top it with tons of cheese!! DELICIOUS!!! Also a good dish to assemble ahead and freeze for a super quick dinner on another night!

This was a very easy recipe!  I was even thinking you could add Refried beans and spanish rice to the layers for a different change.

This taco lasagna was full of flavor and an excellent change of pace for dinner. Not nearly as messy as tacos can be and tons more flavor. It was even great warmed up the next day. I highly recommend this receipe if you love Mexican flavor.

This is a very tasty, kid-friendly recipe. Added jalapenos, sliced black olives, diced tomatoes, more garlic. Used low fat cheeses and sour cream.  Plated this with shredded lettuce. Wonderful!

I was at a loss for what to make for dinner so I threw this together. I used vegetarian meat & added black beans. Really pretty good. I left the sour cream off the layers so it was hot & added it at the end. I also added some crushed tortilla chips to the top in the last 10 minutes of baking. Gave it a nice crunch.

This was a tasty casserole for a football Sunday.  I prepared as written with a small exception, added some chopped onion to the beef, and dropped the green onions.  Very rich and filling recipe.  I'll bet this would be good with a little less meat and some black beans added to the mix.  Also thought next time I will add some green chopped chilis.  Thank you for your submission, crystal, we enjoyed trying this today.

Quick and easy (especially since my husband put it together ;-). Used Ro*Tel tomatoes with chilies and added cilantro because I'm allergic to onions. Turned out great!

This is very good! It's pretty easy too - the hardest part is chopping the green onions! I did not make any changes to the recipe :)

Made this for the family but shredded a whole rotisserie chicken instead of the beef, it was awesome.  Very little leftovers & those were gone in a flash the next day.  Will make it again because it was super easy & a crowd pleaser!

I LOVE this recipe.  It didn't hold up very well, probably would have if I would have let it sit for awhile.  I didn't have any chili powder and only half the aount of salsa needed but added 14 oz of diced tomatos.  I combined the salsa I did have with the tomatos and added some garlic.  I used flour tortilllas.  I added yellow onion to my browing hamburger cause I didn't have green onion.  I started with tortillas, salsa, hamburger, then chili beans,(figured since I didn't have chili powder I'd add chili beans)sour cream, cheese, repeat.  I heart this recipe:)

I used flour 10 inch tortillas and two bags of morning stars veggie crumbles instead of beef as I am a vegetarian. This was a bit spicy for me and my toddler, maybe because of the meat substitute having less fat than beef? It wasn't crazy spicy, but I will cut the cayenne and chili pepper in half next time. Also, had a bag of Cheddar Jack in the fridge- so convenient and only use the 2 cups for everything. Hubby LOVED this. I froze half of the casserole and think it will reheat nicely.

This dish was incredibly tasty!  We loved it.  I have made other Mexican lasagnas in the past and they all used flour tortillas which wasn't as good.

My family loved this!  I did add a red onion and can of refried beans to the beef as well as the sour cream (instead of waiting till later.)  I also only used the taco seasoning and no additional seasonings and didn't lose any of the flavor.  It was definitely easy to prepare as well.  Not to mention it's easy to customize by adding things like corn, black olives, jalapenos, peppers, or pretty much any other vegetable you love on your tacos.  We will definitely make this again and again.

My family and I love this recipe!  I only use a couple of tiny modifications... On top of each layer of beef, I layer refried beans, and when it's finished, I top it with sliced black olives and chopped crunchy lettuce.  Oh, and sometimes I'll sprinkle a little extra cayenne into the taco seasoning mix, if we want something a bit spicier.  It's a huge portion, and usually gone within the day because it's so popular at my house.  This one's great!

Tried to stick as close as possible to the recipe but ... had to substitute tomato sauce for the salsa (allergy to onions) and of course, omitted the green onions; used ground venison/pork (DH is a hunter); used 2 1/2 T. of the Taco Seasoning I (from this site).  It was delicious but I'm sure it would have been even better as originally written.  We found it lighter than the traditional lasagna with noodles.  UPDATE:  tried recipe cutting the cayenne pepper and chili powder in half (for those preferring less heat), using only 8 oz of sour cream, and just 1 1/2 c. cheddar (no Monterey Jack), used whole wheat tortillas (large, cut in half).  This variation was excellent as well.  I often make the meat/spices mixture and freeze it.  Then just thaw when needed and assemble ... quick dinner.  Thanks for the recipe, Crystal.

this was very yummy! i did however change it up a little bit. i used ground turkey breast and added a can of diced tomatoes, a can of corn and a can of black beans. i forgot to buy salsa so that's why i used the tomatoes instead. i didn't use green onion too because i like sweet onion more. i also mix the sour cream in with the meat mixture. i will for sure make this again.

This recipe is DELICIOUS! I omitted the green onion, used one packet of taco seasoning, medium salsa, and served it with shredded lettuce. So yummy! My husband and I loved it. It was really flavorful even without the green onion and one packet of taco seasoning. It has a nice kick to it! Thanks!

Will definitely put in rotation.  This was really good and 5 out of 6 really liked.  It was a little dry but I was very conservative with the wet ingredients.  Only put green onions on top and put corn and black beans in the layers as well.  I tried combining the sour cream with the salsa but it made it a weird salmon color-will not do that again!  I also used chunky salsa and this also might have contributed to the dryness.  Thanks for sharing Crystal!

My fiance and I made this last night, didn't have green onions but we put some chopped up regular onion in, left sour cream out since he doesn't eat it (i put it on mine at the table). Didn't have taco seasoning left so used some season salt, cayenne and chili powder... got a little too spicy for my taste, but still really yummy! Can't wait to try again using regular taco seasoning.

My husband and I really enjoyed this unique alternative to the typical Mexican dishes we fix (tacos, quesadillas, etc). This dish would be a great way to feed a large number of people with relatively little effort. Yum!

I've made this a few times and its always great. I add black olives and jalapenos and I also dip each tortilla in enchilada sauce. Gives it a great flavor. Serve it with guacamole salad on the side and beer and margaritas.

Nice alternative on Taco Night!  I used green chili peppers also.  Spicy nice!  I also used flour tortillas instead of corn ones and double layered them between each layer of meat, sauce, and cheese.  MMMMmmmmm good!

This was pretty good.  I am usually not a big fan of corn tortillas.  Next time I would add layers of refried beans and possibly use flour tortillas...but defintely the beans!  Yummy and very quick to put together.  If I had all of the ingredients I would defintely make again.

This is a very good recipe. The meat cooking prior to assembly smells absolutely delicious. I have made this two times in the last three weeks and it has been very popular with my husband and guests alike.
One thing: Both times, it has been a little spicy. I am not complaining myself, but to make others enjoy this dish more, in the future, I will add half the cayenne pepper.
Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing, and my family loves this!

I made this for the first time a few nights ago. I left out the cayenne pepper and chili powder because my young kids where gonna be eating it. I also left out the green onions and used the mexican style cheese I had on hand. My family liked it but didn't think it was great. I reheated some of it for lunch the next day and it wasn't really that good. I do think I will make this again but maybe change it up a bit, maybe leave the sour cream on the side and use tostada shells.

Not too bad.  Bf wasn't that impressed--he thought it was a bit mushy.  I used chicken instead of beef and it worked just fine.  I liked the fact that this recipe used tortillas so I could use up tortillas I had, but I think I'm with bf in preferring tacos you assemble instead.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good, if not an original idea.  I added a chopped onion to the beef instead of green onion later.  Also a little cumin.  Layered some leftover refried beans in too.  Served with more salsa, sour cream, shredded lettuce and avocado mash.

I only made half the recipe in a 9" x 9" pan and it worked out perfectly.  It would still be plenty for a family of four.  I also added 1 can of fat free re-fried beans, and substituted ground turkey for beef.  Spreading the beans over the tortillas really helps keep everything from sliding around.  Other than that, kept everything pretty much the same.  Pretty darn good, and it only took 30 min. in the oven after all.

Made two batches this weekend for a dinner party and they were gobbled up by both adults and kids.  I made one batch with beef and one with chicken - both were yummy.  Definitely a keeper.

This was pretty good! Easy to make. I used corn tortillas. I think the flour ones wouldn't have been as good. I put some green onions and cilantro on top when I served it. yum!

This is easy and delicious.  I wish I could give it a higher rating.  It seems like it would be "just another" Mexican dish, but this was awesome!  I think it's the sour cream that makes the dish.

Yes!!  FINALLY, a recipe not one person in the family complained about.  The kids are total pains in the coolo when it comes to dinner.  The youngest said it was "the best dinner she's ever had".  I used whole grain tortillas and added a layer of refried beans and used rotisserie chicken seasoned with the taco seasoning.  So many variations of this can be made to your liking.  Add or remove whatever you want...you can't lose.  Thank you for a great way to change up our Taco Tuesday!

I gave this recipe 5 out of 5 because it was easy, tasted really good and took little alteration. I think the sour cream really makes a difference compared to similar recipes on this site that do not use it. I substituted flour tortillas in place of corn tortillas. I used low fat sour cream and lowered salt content taco seasoning.  I served it over shredded lettuce and fresh salsa.

Love it!! I used extra fluffy soft tortillas instead of corn, and some philly cream cheese for part of the dollops of sour cream and it was fantastic!! I will say I'm not a big spicy fan and I wish I had cut out the cayenne. With the mild salsa and only half of the chili powder it was pretty spicy for me. Fiancé loved it and thought it was just fine.

Love this recipe.  I made a double batch with the idea of freezing single portions for lunches but it never made it to the freezer.  My family of 3 gobbled it up in less than 2 days. (Even my 18month old loved it!)

We had a Mexican Christmas this year and I assembled this two days in advance adding frozen corn and black beans to the ground beef mixture.  I kept everything else the same.  It was delicious except the corn tortillas fell apart when it was served.  This was probably because I assembled the dish ahead of time though.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks Crystal.

This was a big hit with my husband. Since it's just the 2 of us, I made a much smaller portion in a different size pan. I like tacos plain (just meat and cheese pretty much) so I only layered the corn tortillas with meat, cheese and I added some picante salsa for a little extra flavor but I think next time I will leave that out. I also seasoned the meat while browning with a little chili powder, cumin, and garlic. Overall, great recipe, definitely going to make it again!

I give it a 4 but the husband gave it a 5. A bit too spicy (I followed the recipe exactly as far as spices) for me to glean the other flavors on my palette. I also added in a can of drained black beans to my meat mixture before spreading on the tortillas. Makes it more filling and slightly more healthy, plus it makes more to go around

Love this recipe.  Easy and fast to make.  Very kid friendly and they love to help put it together, too.  I use the corn tortillas that were already crisped and use lean turkey burger instead of beef. I also add a can of drained black beans to the beef for additional nutrients.

The seasoning array is rather kid-friendly, so I spiced it up quite a bit.  I also switched it up with turkey and green chile.  Great concept.  Anyone can easily alter this to suit their own taco-taste. =)

This was good as is, but my hubby and I both felt like it could use some sprucing up. I think it would be great with the addition of refried beans and it needs some kind of sauce too; like an enchilada sauce. That would make it 5 stars in my opinion.

Good recipe, good idea! I cut the recipe in half, and then cut the amount of cheese by even more, also adding some black beans to increase fiber. We liked it a lot, even though my boyfriend oversalted the meat. We'll definitely make it again.

I made this recipe exactly according to the directions. It came out really well and was incredibly easy to make. Next time I make it I will take the user suggestions on mixing the sour cream and meat together before spreading. It was hard to evenly spread the sour cream, I will also use more sour cream next time. This is definitely a keeper!

Tried this recipe for the first time the other day.  Wow!  I had some white corn tortillas kickin' around, so I used those.  I also wanted to up the veggie content, so I added a black bean and corn layer.  I'm not a huge fan of canned salsa, so I topped mine with home made pico de gallo and some sour cream.  For a little extra heat, I also added a minced jalepeno to the beef.  It's even great as leftovers!  I fed to to my sister for lunch today and she expressed several times how good it was.  Thanks for a fabulous keeper!

this came out so good! i usually don't like corn tortillas, but they hold up really well in this dish. i omitted the green onions and just seasoned the ground beef with only the taco mix and omitted the garlic, cayenne and chill powder. after it's served i also add lettuce and a dollop over sour cream on top (instead of inside).

Awesome!  The only thing I omitted was the green onions (since I didn't have any) and only used 8 oz. of sour cream.  I mixed the sour cream and salsa and it spread really well.  To brown the beef I sauteed it with onions and it really added to the flavor.  I also had to add more cheese because my husband really likes cheese!  Putting this on the menu rotation!

This one is a major keeper in our house!  Being a family of only 3 we had so much left over that we had to have a party the next day and everyone raved about this dish!  I may reduce the cayenne pepper a tad for my 9-year old the next time I make this and will cut the recipe in half if it is just the 3 of us.  I did add some frozen corn into the meat mixture as well.  The next pot luck at work will have this on the table!  Thank you for a new family favorite!

I made this dish for a birthday party last night and it was a big hit with everyone.  I made a few changes per other reviewers - I used ground turkey instead of beef, used 1/4 teas. cayenne pepper and only 1 teas. chili powder.  I used flour tortillas instead of corn and I added a can of refried beans to the ground turkey once it was cooked.  Will be making again.

This is an awesome recipe.  It makes alot, which is good because my 15 year old grandson had 3 helpings!  Everyone loved it & 2 people wanted the recipe.  I only used 1/4 tsp of cayenne, and probably more salsa and cheese.  Thanks for the recipe.

Really super! Nice seasoning of the beef. I baked the tortillas before assembling the lasagna to minimize sogginess. I also added corn, tortilla chips... and some other stuff. The sour cream baked in is great for creaminess. Even without cheese this was delicious!

Wow!  My hubby and I both devoured this.  Substituted shredded chicken for ground beef (although the beef sounds good, too) and flour tortillas for corn.  Added sauteed red bell pepper, drained and smashed black beans, and some corn.  We were very happy to have leftovers.

This recipe was easy to make and great flavor. I made this exactly how the recipe stated except I added onions to my meat mixture. The only thing I would do differently next time is take out some of the chili powder, it was a tad bit overpowering for my tastes and change my salsa flavor to mild from hot. Was a spicy dish with as much salsa as I added. It was also even better the next day!!! Great dinner

This was easy and tasted great- the whole family loved it! I added a can of refried beans and some sliced jalapenos, but next time I will not put the sour cream in it, I will just let everyone add it to their own after its done baking.

Very tasty - my husband, 2 yr old son and I all enjoyed.  I used corn tortilla chips to give it some crunch. I made my own taco seasoning.  UPDATE: Made a second time as per the recipe.  It was still very good, but I prefer using the chips for the extra crunch.  My husband requests this meal become a regular.

I just made this last night and it was delicious. I had some chipotle cheddar in my fridge so I subbed half of that for half the regular cheddar and it gave it a little more of a kick.I also lightly mixed in the sour cream with the meat just to make it easier. I can't find any way to improve on this recipe, it was great. I will make this again for sure.

This recipe was okay. I added refried beans into the layers and it turned out good. It isn't much different than making tacos though. There wasn't anything special about this recipe that would make me want to make it over again - I'd prefer regular tacos!

This is the first time I have given a recipe a five star rating.  It was good on so many levels- taste, ease of preparation and convienence of ingredients involved.  Don't get me wrong- this isn't a gourmet meal-but one that will get eaten and enjoyed.  I left out extra spices-we arent a spicy family- and it was still great.  I served with fresh tomatoes, taco sauce and spanish rice.  My husband exclaimed "Please make this again!"  Ole!

this is great cause you can pretty much change it and put whatever you want in it...i put flour tortillas on the bottom, then a very shallow layer of refried beans, then salsa, mexican rice and beef, topped with another layer of toritillas

I made this for dinner tonight and my hubby and son really liked it.  I felt like there was something missing. I did leave out the cayenne just because I knew my son would think it was too hot and not eat it.  
I was not crazy about it and I probably wont make it again.

Had this for dinner last night and all I can say is we will have it again.  I was afraid that my salsa hating hubby wouldn't like it much, but he went back for thirds and I'm sure he took some leftovers for work.  I didn't want to use 2lbs of ground beef so I used 1lb of g.beef and added beans; for the seasoning I used a double recipe of the Restaurant-Style Taco Meat Seasoning, I had to double the water to the meat mixture, probably because of the seasonings, but it was soooo good.  I actually forgot to add the extra seasonings that the recipe called for and we didn't have green onions, so I sauteed the beef in chopped onions.  To spread the sour cream a little more evenly I put it in a baggie and cut an end of the bag off and piped the sour cream on in rows then carefully spread the sour cream with a spatula, works better than spooning dallops of sour cream everywhere.  My husband liked it so much he's talking about having it again on Sunday (in 3 days), this will be a staple in our house.  I used the corn tortillas this time and maybe I'll try it with flour and see which one we like best, though I don't think it would matter, the flavors are very yummy.

This dish is great. Followed recipe exact but only added half cayene pepper, for the kids sake and found it to have just enough spice. We ate corn on the side with this and my corn got mixed into the taco lasagna and it was really good. So next time I will add a can of corn to the beef mixture. I loved the flavor and so did the family. I will make this on a regular basis.

Delicious flavor.  I used flour tortillas and yellow onion, as that was on hand.  Even the fussy eaters enjoyed it!  I'll be making it again, even for company.

I made this the other night.  I had about a pound of leftover taco meat, so I decided to make this.  I didn't measure a thing, just kind of eyeballed it.  Layered it the way it said, skipped the green onion because I didn't have any and didn't add the spice to the ground beef.  I also added a thin layer of cream cheese on top of the tortillas.   Tasted great!

Oh, so good.  Even better reheated!  I used yellow onion instead of green and not nearly what it called for, but they were wicked onions!  I used ground turkey instead of beef.  I think it holds the flavor better.

Very good recipe--simple and not messy to prepare.  To reduce the calories, I omitted the sour cream and reduced the amount of cheese.  Still tasted great.  Also I halved the recipe, but I still added the same amount of salsa.

While this was tasty, I felt like I might as well have just made enchiladas.  My favorite thing about it was that it reheats well.  I love taking leftovers to work for lunch and was able to do that easily.

This was ok - not a gourmet meal but created less mess than making burritos or tacos.
I added refried beans and corn for some 'vegetable' content to the dish. 
Good reheated the next day.

I gave this 3 stars- not b/c it tasted bad, but it was the combination of it being quite expensive and time consuming and tasting only good, not great.  None of my guests complimented me on it, so I take that as a bad sign!  Most ate it with chips, more like a heavy taco dip than a meal.  Just didn't work out for my family & friends so I won't be keeping this, but I don't discourage others from trying it.

My husband thinks fritos or corn chips with/on top would be good. Sounds good to me too! My kids (ages 4 and 6) are very finicky and both ate their dinner. Any recipe I find that they will actually eat scores big with me!

fam enjoyed. i tweaked for our vegetarian, mashed black beans and corn (3c each) instead of beef with the taco seasoning.  only 8oz sour cream with 2 bags of shredded cheese mixed first then layered.  used the bigger tortilla, overlapping 4 for thickness of 2.

Absolutely DELICIOUS, I just had to adjust for the size of our casserole dish, and it was amazing. The only thing I changed was I didn't put the sour cream in the  actual dish, because it just seemed like it would make it too sloppy so I saved the sour cream for a dollop on the top. It was absolutely perfect. My mother even says I have to make it again just like that from now on. Daughter tested, mother approved!

We enjoyed the taste and spice of this recipe, but I think my husband more than me.  I used a thick bean salsa and thought the lasagna was a little too thick and dry overall, so next time I will use a more traditional tomatoey salsa or maybe both.  My husband also plans to heat up the leftovers with eggs for breakfasts this week :)

I'm a terrible cook.. I've been trying to find things that are simple for me, and taste good to everyone else. This recipe was so simple I was able to modify, and make it, and everyone LOVED it. I used a smaller baking pan, and only one giant flour tortilla. It turned out amazing.

I used large flour tortillas, cut them in half, overlapping the rounded ends toward the middle of 13x9 in baking dish, that way the cut edges were square with the square sides of the pan. I have made this for my teenage son and his friends so much, they still ask for it from college. Lots of flavor and ingredient possibilities, its a fun recipe to play with. Freezes well and is a great to make ahead and for leftovers.

I used a taco seasoning on this site for the meat, and followed everything else. The cayenne can make a bit spicy, so be aware if you are preparing this for children to also enjoy. Overall, I love this recipe.

Really liked this one, but with the spices from the taco seasoning packs and chili pepper it has a bit of a bit.  Next I'll cut back on the chili pepper.  To make it a bit more healthy I used whole wheat tortillas.

I made this last night for my family and they loved it.  I added some chopped onions to the meat as it was cooking.  I substituted 1/2 of the sour cream for cream cheese and blended them together.  I mixed this with the meat after it was done so that everything was coated evenly.  I substituted flour tortillas for corn since I prefer flour.  Served chopped tomatoes, shredded lettuce and black olives on the side if anyone wanted to add on.  The best thing about this recipe is that it is easily modified to meet your specific taco taste.

Very yummy!  Was a hit with even the picky eaters!!!
Omitted the cayenne pepper, used only 1 pack of seasoning(only because that's all I had) used whole wheat tortillas, used less salsa then what it called for but put fresh salsa on top.  So good!

This was pretty good. Not the most attractive dish, definitely not something I would serve to company. It was a good mid-week dinner when fresh ingredients were running low.

Excellent.  Tasted like a very authentic mexican dish.  A tad on the dry side.  Next time I will add more salsa but other than that delicious.

GREAT way to change up tacos! I revised it a bit to make it healthier and used 8x8 pan instead. I used only about 1/2 lb of beef and added black beans to bulk it up. Also, only used 1/2 cup cheddar and 1/2 cup mozzarella. And, only 1/4 cup of sour cream.  I think this recipe is very flexible and could be modified to work with whatever you have in your fridge.

I used 1 lb. 80% lean ground beef, 1 1.25 oz. package taco seasoning, a sprinkling of minced garlic, no cayenne pepper, the 1 tbsp. chili powder, 3/4 c. water, the 18 (white) corn tortillas, a 16 oz. jar mild chunky salsa, no green onion, the 16 oz. sour cream, and 16 oz. mexican shredded cheese (was plenty of cheese). i made it this way to keep the cost low and/or use things already in my cupboards...turned out great and healthy with less meat/cheese.

Made this on Super Bowl Sunday this year for my family... they LOVED it!! Very tasty. Did not need to store it because it was gone by the end of the game :-P Can easily make this  dish into a veggie friendly dish by subing the ground beef for refried beans.

I actually made this with ground turkey, and it was fabulous! I made a few changes though, and cooked most of the green onions, onions, and garlic with the meat to give the turkey meat more flavor. I took some other's advice, and because it is just me and my boyfriend, I cut the recipe in half. Used the water recommendation on the taco seasoning pack so it would not be dry. Mixed the ground turkey mix with the sour cream for layering, and added refried beans. Served over lettuce and garnished with tomatoes. It's my new favorite weekday meal!! Terrific!!

This was very delicious! I used a bag of vegetarian 'beef' crumbles instead of real meat since we're vegetarian. Turned out very yummy!

My family really liked this one. I did 1/2 the recipe. I changed the amount of water to what was on the back of the taco packet, because it was too dry without it. I also subbed taco sauce for the salsa because that's what I had. I didn't measure the sourcream or the cheese (we like it cheesy) It turned out great! Thanks

5 stars! I only used 1 package of taco seasoning and didn't use the cayenne pepper or chili powder because no one in my house doesn't really like spicy....and I used flour tortillas instead of corn....but other than that, I followed the recipe. Instead of dropping the sour cream on the beef, I followed the reviews of other readers that said to mix it in, and it worked out really well. Was a hit with all 6 of my dinner guests! Great left overs too.

I made this as written, except I did not use the full jar of either the salsa or the sour cream (there was still plenty!) and I subbed mozzarella for the monteray jack because that isn't a readily available cheese here in Canada.  I used a round pan, and used 3 corn tortillas cut in half to cover the bottom, with a whole one in the centre and it fit perfectly.  This was quite easy to make ahead and keep it in the fridge to pop it in the oven when I got home from work.  My hubby loved it too, but my 3 year old wouldn't even try it. :-( Still a great recipe~thanks!

This was really good. I did make a few changes. I didn't have sour cream, so I used cheese whiz (the kind in the jar) instead. Also, my salsa was medium heat, so I didn't use the additional spices beyond the taco seasoning. To remedy the issue with the layer of tortillas being too thick, as someone below mentioned, I used 3 whole tortillas and then cut two in half instead of overlapping 6 tortillas per layer. This seemed to work out well.   I took this to a potluck and everyone enjoyed it. I'll definitely make this again!

I thought this recipe was too dry.  I used more salsa than called for but I think the corn tortillas really absorbed all the liquid.  It tasted fine, but didn't have the distinct layers that I would associate with a "lasagna".

really really good, but i used 2 cloves and i still thought it just gave it an odd taste, i have never heard of any mexican recipe calling for garlic anyway so i should have known, and i love green onions but i don't see the need to put them in the layers i think as a garnish would have been perfect. 5 stars with my changes!

After reading the positive reviews, I couldn't wait to make this for my family. We were dissapointed. The only change I made to the recipe was to use flour tortillas. The chile powder was too much and ruined the taste of the casserole.

SUPER!! This was very good. I eliminated the chilil powder and the cayenne because my son doesn't like hot foods. The salsa and the taco seasoning added just enough heat for him. I also only added 1 pkg. of taco seasoning and that was plenty. I didn't have any green onions so I just chopped up some sweet onion and used that. When I was about halfway through essembling the casserole, I realized that I forgot to sautee the garlic so I just through it in raw and it was fine (probably healthier). I think next time I would add a little more sour cream and decrease the corn tortillas by about 3 or so. Other than that it was a quick to essemble very tasty dinner. Thank you Crystal for the recipe.

Very good!  My husband told me I can make this again anytime.  I used taco seasoning, flour tortillas, skipped the onion and topped it with crushed tortilla chips when done.  Nice to have something different.

The taste was wonderful.  A few of us who don't like onions just didn't do too well with the texture of the onions in the dish (especially from the salsa).  But we can easily work around that!  We also took another reviewer's advice and mixed the sour cream in with the meat mixture.  That made it really easy.  This recipe is a keeper!

This is one of the yummiest "lasagnas" I've ever made. I followed some of the reviews and added refried beans to the tortillas before layering, and although it was yummy, it made the dish a little gooey. It tasted great though and my hubby and kids wolfed it down before I could even ask their opinion. Thank you for adding this great recipe!!

Delicious. I took other reviewers advice and substituted the corn tortillas with flour tortillas. This dish looked exactly like lasagna and tasted exactly like a taco. Everyone loved it. Even my picky eaters. Will definitely make again. Probably weekly (at least monthly)

Very good!  I omitted the cayenne pepper and used medium salsa and it was spicy enough for my family, and we like spicy.

My family absolutely devoured this dish.   I would highly recommend it.  I followed it ingredient for ingredient and it really was not hot.  I served with sour cream, diced tomatoes and jalapenos.  Fantastic!

Dee-licious!  I am from New Orleans and am picky about my food but I thought this was great.  the only changes I made was to add chopped onions, onion powder and garlic powder to my meat mixture. I also omitted the cayene because I like my food well seasoned but not hot.  I also halved the chili powder. I served with sour cream, diced tomatoes, and shredded lettuce.

This was good. I would wait until the Taco Lasagna was cooked before I added the sour cream in the future. I also made my own taco seasoning. I would make this again.

Loved it.  Even my 9 yr old (typically picky eater) loved it!!  The only changes I made to the recipe was that I halved the recipe, omitted the garlic (didn't have any) and I added sour cream on top of each beef layer.  Next time I'll also add layers of refried beans too and maybe some black olives.  Very tasty and a definite keeper!! :)

I tweaked this just a bit in an attempt to make it healthier and it was awesome.  I used just one pound of meat (ground turkey), halved the spices, used fat free sour cream, and used a reduced fat mexican cheese blend from the grocery store.  I wouldn't make it any other way.  This is my new favorite recipe and it really is super easy.  Thank you!!

I highly recommend this recipe if you're looking for a simple, yet filling casserole!  I have made this twice with great results.  The only changes I made were to stick strictly with cheddar cheese, and I added about 4 oz of chopped green chiles with the green onions.  Also, I spread the sour cream as a layer instead of dropping it by spoonfuls. All together, a very delicious lasagna.

Very good recipe.  It's delicious as is, or to tweak to your own preference.  I increased the chili powder, added onion powder, a little more taco seasoning. I also layered refried beans and added a layer of corn... so good!  I served this with corn bread.

I was tired of plain old tacos so I decided to try this. I made it for my boyfriend and he was so in love with it. He took the leftovers to work the next day...and he NEVER takes leftovers.  Not only was it good, it was SUPER easy to make!  I will definately make it again.

I loved it. My family loved it. I did use flour tortillas(i hate corn tortillas) and I added a layer of refried beans in the middle and mixed the sour cream in with the meat. I also cut back slightly on the cayenne pepper. It was delicious!

I couldn't get all the ingredients to fit in my 9x13. It was too full and I had to put the extras in a little  casserole dish. I did not see the need for the water and I did add a can of pinto beans, but other than that, I stuck to the recipe. Everyone liked it more than I did. It was o.k. for me and easy enough to do.

this recipe was easy and delicious.  I pretty much followed it, just 1/2'ed it.  Used corn tortillas (they were smaller and easier to handle, not to mention cheaper).  I spread refried beans onto the tortillas as i placed them in there and layered it in an 8x8 pan.  I left out the sour cream IN the recipe, served it on the side, and sliced up some roma tomatoes and sprinkled on top when it came out of the oven.  Made for GREAT leftovers too!

My family are pretty picky eaters where casseroles are concerned, and they loved this one. I substituted corn chips for the tortillas, added a drained can of green chillies and 1/4 tsp of dried mustard. I think I'll add a can of pinto or black beans next time.

I gave this 5 stars because I loved it, however, my family thought it was just ok. I used a mixture of sour cream and cream cheese for the filling between layers instead of straight sour cream.  There were quite a few left overs, but I think it may have been because we had had tacos the night before and family could have been just mexicaned out.  I will make again on another night and see how it goes over with them.

This recipe was easy and quick and the first words out of my husbands mouth were "this is great!"  He enjoys my cooking but normally doesn't comment on something unless it's something he doesn't care to see again!  The only change I made was to use flour tortillas instead of corn tortillas.  Will definitely be making again soon!

This was really good, but I didn't bother with adding the water (I was in a hurry) and used Emeril's Essence instead of taco seasoning.  I didn't use quite as much salsa and sour cream in the lasagna, but served it on the side when finished.  Also, substituted 8 large flour tortillas (cut in half) as I didn't have any corn tortillas.

All my co-workers loved this!
I left out all of the spices, just using the taco seasoning, onions and garlic was enough.
Amazing dish!!!!

Great casserole and fun to make! I halved the recipe, and did add a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies (mixed it together with the salsa) and I'm glad I did, cuz it just didn't seem like enough sauce when I started putting it together. And I was right! It came out perfect! :)

Excellent recipe!  I served this last night and my family all said this was definitely a keeper.  I used chives instead of green onion since chives are now in season and just out the back door.  Also, I use sliced cheeses in my lasagnas as it tends to hold together better.  Really, really good and easy!!!

This was a perfect use for left-over Chili that I had in the freezer.  Family loved it, I added black olives in with it and made corn bread as a side dish. Great for a pot luck dinner idea.

Yum-o!  I found this recipe when I was trying to find a way to cook all the stuff I had left over from making taquitos for a football party.  Because I was using things I had on hand, I used 1 lb ground beef just seasoned with garlic salt and 1 lb chorizo sausage (cooked down I'd say that's about 6 ounces... I put paper towels in a bowl and use them to strain the oil through!), I added a can of chili beans for some fiber, used 2 7oz cans of Herdez salsa verde, no green onions and other than that I guess I stuck to the recipe. 30 minutes in the oven and I had a beautiful casserole with a crispy cheesy top... and I didn't have to go to the store!!!

It was like yummy tacos, but less messy. I subsituted flour tortillas for the flour, but it still turned out really well. Definitly a recipe I'll try again.

I would have preferred my spice but it was a tasty, quick dinner.  Next time I am going to add mexican corn.  I think that would give it more texture.  Overall, it was good.

Very good!  A taco meal in one pan.  I mixed the sour cream with the meat mixture to speed things up a little.  I cut the recipe in half and used flour torillas and it still made a 9x13 pan full.  I'll be making this again.

GREAT recipe - I loved it! This is one of my new favorite dishes. Very easy. I used flour tortillas and didn't add any additional spices (thought the taco seasoning was enough). I made it in a 9x9 pan and didn't measure ingredients. I only baked it 20 minutes. Can't wait to eat the leftovers.

This was wonderful!  I added a bell pepper and we only used 12 tortillas to cut down on the starch.  We had it for dinner last night, the husband took a chunk with him to work today and we had it again tonight.  We love this dish and it's sure to become a staple in our house. Thanks, Crystal!

OMG!!! This is a new family favorite. I had company tonight that just RAVED over and over about this dish. I didn't have but 1 lb. of beef so I used that...will make with the whole 2 lbs next time. I also forgot the sour cream in the first layer but it didn't seem to be lacking. I didn't emasure cheese...we are cheese lovers and so I just piled it on. Very good dish! Thanks!

Tonight will be the third time taking this to a potluck. Went over VERY well  Had to leave out the Cayenne pepper because of the older folks and the kids. Everyone loved it just as written. This time I cooked the meat and spices in advance then froze it. I picked up the perishables while at the store and threw this together in 5 mins this morning. Into the oven at 5 pm and served it at 6. (I'd love to try this with chicken instead of beef and maybe add some refried beans).

I found it to be rather dry the first time I made it. I used chunky  salsa and the corn tortillas as suggested. It just didn't get gooey enough. I modified this recipe by putting  a thin layer of red enchilada sauce on the bottom of plan before placement of tortillas . I used small flour tortillas instead of corn. I also used restaurant style salsa which has a thinner more liquid make up. After last layer of tortillas I topped with the rest of the enchilada sauce then cheese.

This is so loved in our house I have to double the recipe to feed my three teenagers, they devour it. I follow 99% of the recipe, I just trade out ground beef for ground turkey. Great recipe, tastes amazing!! Anyone who comes over for dinner and we are making this gives it 5 stars as well!

Most definitely a keeper.  I followed the recipe exactly the first couple of times I made it.  I noticed that I had a little trouble with the sour cream clumping when I followed the directions.  I have since started to stir in the sour cream and green onions into the meat mixture after I have removed it from the heat.  I then continue to follow the directions when putting the layers together.  This more evenly distributes the sour cream and green onions.  The leftovers taste even better the next day.

I made this for the first time tonight exactly as written except that I cut the recipe in half.  There are only two of us and I didn’t need a 9 x 13 pan of food.  It was delicious and very filling.  It was a little spicy but we like spicy!  If you don’t I would just leave out the cayenne pepper.  Still have enough for another meal. Will definitely make this again!

I looked over a few recipes for "Mexican Lasagna" and decided on this one. Made it to the recipe as written except added chicken broth (1+c) instead of water. 
For the Salsa I used Pace Chunky medium and used a high quality corn tortilla that I pre-heated in a 350 oven for 2 minutes.  
A wonderfully fantastic recipe! Made it for three of us and all went back for seconds and commented "I'd make this again!"  All I can say in closing is...KEEPER!

I used square dumpling-type noodles since I didn't have flour tortillas in the house.  I would also try egg noodles if I didn't have any tortillas in the future.  I substituted chopped yellow onion since I didn't have any scallions.  I used peach mango salsa since I had it open in the fridge but would prefer "regular" salsa instead.  I used shredded Tex Mex cheese blend, but any preferred cheese will do.  Served with fresh chopped tomatoes, chopped lettuce, and sour cream.  Family loved it.

This was a pretty tasty meal.  Next time I think I'll spread the sour cream into a layer in lieu of just dollops.  I cut the recipe in half and used a 9x9 baking dish.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I made it exactly per the recipe. The flavor was fine, it was the overall texture that was just not very appealing. Perhaps it might taste different with flour tortillas in a single layer on the bottom and top? Worth trying. My three 18-23 year old sons said they would've preferred the Beef Nacho Casserole (on this site), which is far easier to make and has a much better texture.

Like Lesley, another reviewer, I made this in a couple of cake pans, just the right size for 8" flour/corn tortillas. Each one will feed 2 - 4 people. An additional benefit is using multiple pans allows you to make some hot, medium or mild. To protect the non-stick coating on some pans line them first with a couple sheets of parchment paper.

If you like the old classic Frito pie, you'll like this. It's tasty and easy. You can alter the spicy factor by using spicier or milder picante sauce.

I  made it without the sour cream.  I added  an envelope of restaurant style seasoning instead of the spices.  No onion.  I served avocado, lettuce, diced tomato, and sour cream with it.  
It was great.  I will make it again.

Sorry for the change - I had roasted a chicken the day before and used the breasts instead of beef.  This recipe is a keeper.
Kids loved it as much as adults.  Topped with lots of spring onions and their green top.  Delish.

This was delicious! It was way more filling than we thought. Fed a family of four with two teenagers! I used my homemade salsa because I like things spicy. Also added cilantro on the top. We will definitely make this again!

Yummy! I used flour tortillas and mostly diced tomato with a little salsa mixed in. Next time I'll save the sour cream the top when ready to serve, and save some scallions for serving with too. I also used low sodium taco seasoning 1.5 packs.

This is a very easy and forgiving recipe which can be adjusted to your personal tastes.  I used flour tortillas, light sour cream, as substitutions. I also added low sodium black beans and frozen corn. I enjoyed it with Newman's Own Peach Salsa. Rested the lasagne for 10 minutes before cutting into it. Very tasty and will definitely make again. Next time I will add some fresh cilantro.

I had to make a couple changes to avoid going to the store but this was fantastic!! I tore these huge tortilla's I had in half since I only had 2 and just layered those. I only used half of what all the recipe called for since I was only feeding 3 people. I used diced fresh tomatoes on the middle layers and saved the little bit of salsa I had for the top and bottom layer. I did not use any onion. I used shredded mexican and cheddar cheese. And I added lettuce to my plate once I served it.

Very easy. I halved the recipe in an 8in square pan since I was only cooking for 2. Not too spicy, but the cayenne added a little extra heat. I might omit if  making for kids. Leftovers should reheat well.

This was tasty and not a lot of trouble, but all in all, I'd rather have had a taco.  My family liked this though.  I guess it boils down to this recipe being less trouble for the consumer but not really any less trouble for the cook while the taste is aobut the same.

Really good, but a bit on the spicy side. Next time I will cut back on the chili powder, or cut out the cayenne pepper completely. I also put chopped lettuce on the top. Had I not used all the sour cream already a dollop of that on top would have been good too.

This is a ridiculously good mexican dish. Perfectly spiced. Extremely tasty. I love corn tortillas and their flavor is the perfect balance to other flavors. Try this one as it is written before experimenting

My 1st time making any kind of lasagna and so glad I found this recipe because it is so tasty. Only one small thing which is no reflection on the recipe is that the taco seasoning had too much Cumin in it, which I dislike with a passion, so next time I'm going to double check the spice content. I am definitely making this again, it's utterly delicious and downright scrumptious!

Was even better than I expected.  Halved the recipe for the two of us.  Added diced jalapenos, fresh tomatoes and cilantro to the top when it was done.  I mixed ranch dressing mix and some chipotles in with the sour cream.

Tasty.  To make it vegetarian I substituted two cans of refried beans for the ground beef, and only needed one packet of taco seasoning.  I also used flour tortillas - roughly 9", and made it in two cake pans.  For healthier options I used light sour cream and reduced fat sharp cheddar.  The result was a yummy, protein packed meal with lots of leftovers for the freezer.

Excellent,delicious.  I made very few changes. I added a can of black olives (chopped) and a can of whole black beans. I sprinkled both after the onions, on that layer.

Super easy crowd pleaser.  I thought 2 lbs of beef was too much meat so I used 1 lb and subbed in cooked quinoa. I cooked 1 cup of quinoa and then added it to the beef just before adding the spices. The texture was great and it kept the dish hearty without being so heavy.  FYI I did not add water along with spices as I don't care for the "sloppy joe" texture this creates. 

You could also sub Greek yogurt for the sour cream. I topped each serving with chopped romaine for a little crunch. Tasty!

I made this for my husband & I last week. I made a few changes such as I used hot sausage instead of ground beef,  I used flour tortillas instead of corn, I added a can of sweet corn, I added about 1/4 cups of sweet baby rays vidalia onion sauce, and I used sharp cheddar & monterey jack shredded cheese a little more than what recipe called for. All in all it was very good but I think next time I will use just mild sausage instead of the hot, because it about blew our socks off it was soooo spicy. All in all great recipe and will make it again!!

Taco Lasagna night has become a staple for my family and I!  I have altered the recipe some.  Using corn tostadas, breaking them up into pieces (roughly 4 to 5 pieces for a 6" tostadas) and arranging them almost like a puzzle when layering.  Also, using little to no taco sauce, ramping up the amount of cheese and adding black bean and corn salsa, diced green Chile's and sliced jalapeños.  There are a few good recipes on here to make your own taco seasoning and most are better than any store bought seasoning.  Basically, tostadas, cheese, meat, refried beans, salsa, chilis, jalapeños, and cheese is the first layer before I start with tostadas, again.  The wife wasn't down with me adding chipotle chili's but, I thought it was a good addition for some added heat.  Plus, I have been buying the large, deep single use Lasagna baking pans because the leftovers go very quick, that way, there is plenty for everyone to eat the following night.

My TBI Rehab "son" made this one night and everyone enjoyed. We added Serrano's and Torchy's Hot Sauce because we are in San Antonio and we like it HOT!

I thought this was going to be a bit too spicy/hot for me, but it wasn't.  Very good and a quick fix for dinner.  I did used some of my homemade Verde Sauce mixed with a little homemade habenaro sauce.  My fella likes dinner a little on the hot side!

I was really surprised at how this turned out. It's a simple recipe that is really good and everyone enjoyed. I used extra hot salsa because I like my spice. And I didn't have any green onions or taco seasoning on hand so I used chopped up bell pepper and minced garlic in my meat . Also added some cumin to the spices for flavoring and made a sauce out of the meat dripping by adding some corn starch to the mix. Came out just as good.

I made this for dinner night at work, and everybody is a food critic at my firehouse, it was a great success and very filling. Definitely will make this again! I did not use lettuce on the top just put jalapeños on half on the top.

Great specially if you make your own Taco Seasoning. I varied the recipe a little used Chipotle Powder instead of Cayenne.

I made this for my husband and 14 yr old daughter tonight.  I followed the recipe pretty closely.  I used ground turkey instead of ground beef (cheaper), Fiesta Blend cheese (already had it in the fridge), and a salsa containing some white corn and black beans.  I usually prefer flour tortillas, but I used corn tortillas per recipe.  It was so delicious! I will definitely make this again.  Next time I'll probably serve it with a side of shredded lettuce and guacamole and maybe some sour cream.

Thanks for the great recipe. I made a few changes because I didn't want to go to the grocery. I used plain yogurt in place of the sour cream. I also used trader joes green salsa and a blend of pepper jack and cheddar cheese. So good! My husband and I love it!!

I've made this recipe as is and with some variations. I like to make it with flour tortillas instead of corn and add a layer of refried beans. I also serve it with lettuce and guacamole. It's easy and turns out great every time!

I made this for my fiance' and his brothers and they loved it. The only change that I made to the recipe was to add an extra 16oz of a thinner hot salsa  along with the 24oz of a chunky medium salsa to make sure that it was moist after baking. It was great!

My husband and I really enjoyed this, and it wasn't terribly time-consuming to prepare for something with the word "lasagna" in the name. We made it with a mild salsa in the hopes that our toddler would enjoy it as well. Unfortunately, this is only a 3 star recipe for our family because even though it contains a bunch of his favorite things (cheese, tortillas, ground beef) he wasn't that interested in eating them in such a mixed up combination. Oh well!

No leftovers after I cooked this. Only used one packet of taco seasoning. Would probably added some bell peppers or something with crunch.

Great flavors and so easy to put together. I used the "famous taco seasoning" recipe from here in place of the store bought packages.  Great substitute and you can control the amount of salt to put in. Worth a repeat for sure!

It was very easy, and very filling. I added sliced black olives, and Halved the recipe. I made tacos for lunch and didn't know what to do with the leftover taco meat. This worked so perfectly, I am looking forward to leftovers for lunch now.

Delicious!! Although I used only a 16 oz jar of salsa, I thought it might be dry, but it wasn't. I also used flour tortillas instead of corn.

I generally rate recipes on what I am able to do with it, this is an awesome base that can be tweaked a lot of different ways.  I didn't change the base much, just added some yellow onion, a jalapenjo and a serrano pepper to the cooking meat.  All the other ingredients I left as called for in the specified amounts (I do make my own chili powder though).  Where I did change things was I added my sour cream to my simmering meat AND added 8oz of jalapenjo cheddar cream cheese to give it a nice rich creamy filling...overall...delicious, thanks Crystal

This is a favorite recipe and is very good "as is" but from time to time we play with it.  (Note:  The chunkier the salsa the more you need to use to keep the tortillas moist.  We double the salsa amount and add a little more cheese if the salsa is really chunky without much juice.)  You can give the dish a different flavor based on the type of salsa you use.  We like to use a lime salsa and add some fresh cilantro along with the green onions.  We have even used BBQ pulled pork (instead of hamburger and taco seasoning)and mango salsa.  Try throwing in corn, black olives and black beans too for a twist.

Delicious. I had worried that it would be too spicy for my 2.5 and 4.5 yr olds. So much so, that I actually threw some chicken nuggets in the oven just in case. I also didn't use the full amount of chili powder and left the cayene out completely. I used a mild salsa On the Border manufactures. Everyone loved it. I thought it could use more heat, but my husband and kids loved it. The green onions were delightful to encounter. My in-laws stopped by and they loved it. I had cut the recipe in half and we still had more than enough for the four adults, two kids, and leftovers. This will become a regular rotation to my monthly menu. Thanks.

This looks delicious and I plan on making it for dinner tomorrow, but I do have a question. When people talk about making more than one and freezing it, do you assemble it completely and freeze it without cooking first or do you cook it and freeze and then just heat it up when you want to eat it? I assume in either case you would cook the meat first. I guess I am just concerned about the tortillas getting soggy and it not tasting great after being thawed. Can anyone give me some direction on that? I would like to make two in round pans and then freeze one for a later meal. THANKS!

I altered the recipe a little.  I cooked onion with my hamburger meat.  I added only the taco mix and omitted the other.  I used red corn tortillas and spread a layer of refried beans under the meat layer.  I did chop some roasted red peppers and added on top of the meat layer.  After cooking I put shredded lettuce, chopped tomato and sour cream on top.  It looked delicious and tasted even better.

This was really good! I used ground turkey instead of beef and seasoned the meat with 1 packet of taco seasoning (instead of 2), chopped onions, chopped garlic, black pepper and chili powder. Added refried beans and jalapeno peppers to my layers. So tasty! The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the tortillas were soggy/mushy after cooking. I will try to bake them slightly before assembling next time.

I made this for my needlecrafts group, and it was a hit!  I had corn tortillas I wanted to use up, so I did an ingredient search, and found this.  I made it a little less spicy, but loved how it turned out.

We were so indecisive about what to make, but this hit the nail on the head. Only took about an hour, east to prepare, and the whole family loved it! I was surprised it was so filling.  It only cost around $20 too!

Loved it, you can get so creative with this recipe! The only thing I did different was omit the sour cream(since I like it cold on top), and added some refried black beans in the layers. DELICIOUS! Will be a staple recipe in my house.

I enjoyed this dish very much. I used flour instead of corn tortillas and it turned out winderful. My husband put in two bulbs of garlic which gave the meat great flavor.

Wow!  Big family pleaser.  So many possibilities for substitutions, too.  I mixed refried beans in with meat & didn't have green onions, just minced sweet red onions instead.  Used light sour cream & served with more sour cream & black olives.

This was such a fun twist on lasagna!  As some reviewers recommended, I used flour tortillas which worked out great and held up very well. I always substitute ground turkey for ground beef, and only used 1 package of taco seasoning.  I also only used half of the recommended chili powder, and found there was still plenty of heat.  My boyfriend is from Mexico, and he couldn't get enough!  He wanted to eat the leftovers for every meal until they were gone (which didn't take long).  I'm always looking for fun Mexican-inspired dishes, and this one didn't disappoint - thanks so much!

This was an excellent recipe very tasty I did not have green onions so I added diced red peppers,diced green bell peppers and yellow onion to the ground beef while cooking.  I also made it in a glass pie pyrex and used two layers of tortilla instead of six at a time.  I will make this again.

I made this for dinner tonight and had rave reviews! I added a layer of refried beans with a little bit of the taco seasoning mix.  Also added the sour cream to meat mixture.
Served it with lettuce, tomotoes, olives and additional sour cream...everyone ate it all. Went along great with my jalapeno corn bread! Great recipe! Thanks

This was a big hit!  I halved the recipe because I'm on a diet so I couldn't eat it and there are only two others in my house (I did cheat a litte-it was tasty!).  My husband really liked it as well as our exchange student from Brazil.  I used the mild salsa because they both can't handle really spicy food.  I will definitely make this again.  I think this would go great at the office potluck too!  Thanks for the recipe!

i halved the recipe and made in a deep dish pie plate using flour tortillas. I used taco seasoning I from this site in place of the packaged mix and other seasonings. After reading other reviews I crumbled blue corn chips and layered some inside and put some on top prior to baking. I left out the sour cream, instead using it as a garnish along with shredded lettuce and diced tomato. Simple recipe that is absolutely delicious. Will definately make again.

I made this for the first time tonight and was very happy with it. A quick, tasty make-ahead dinner. I divided the recipe into two smaller dishes since I was only feeding two adults and one toddler. One half was the more than enough for dinner, with a little leftover for lunch tomorrow and now I have one in the freezer!

I added diced onions and green and yellow bell pepper to the meat mixture and a can of black beans to the layers.

This was great for the adults in our group, but the kids were a little uncertain of it as it was a bit too spicy.  Next time I will use a smooth salsa as several family members don't like tomatoes, but overall I think this is something to make again for a large group - it makes a lot!

Delicious.  I subbed a can of enchilada sauce for half of the salsa because my family is not a fan of "chunks" in their food.

This was just Okay. The meat was really tasty but as for the rest is was kind of blah. I've had better taco casserole. It needed a crunch of some kind. Might be okay with some tortilla chips or something in it.

This was really good. I used ground turkey and only 2 cups of cheese instead of 3. That made it a little healthier but still tasty!

We really enjoyed this lasagna.  Even my 5 year old did not complain, which he usually does.  We found it to be a bit too tangy, but that could be due to the salsa that I used.  Overall, awesome with a side of sour cream:)

I made this recipe exactly as written and for the first time in ages all 5 of my family members have enjoyed a recipe that wasn't a dessert.  You know how there has to be one in the bunch who wrinkles up their nose at dinner.  Not with this!!  Yippee!  The only thing that would jazz it up would be to add shredded lettuce, fresh diced tomato and maybe some olives on top after you get it on your plate.  That is not necessary but hey, you may as well go for it!!

Yummy!  This was very good and easy.  I halved the recipe but still could have used a whole jar of salsa because it just didn't seem like I had enough.  I added diced tomatoes and chilis to the salsa.  I also added 1 small onion and chopped bell pepper to the meat.  Like another review, I mixed the sour cream with the meat mixture because I hate trying to spread out sour cream.  Overall this was good.  I'll probably make it a once a month addition to my meal plans.

I loved this recipe! It is the first time in a long time I was sitting at work the next day craving leftovers.  The only thing I did different was I could not find 6 inch round corn tortillas. I had to go with 8 inch.  I only used one package of them.  For the tortilla layer I placed one to the far right of the pan and one to the far left.  They overlapped quite a bit in the middle. Then I took a 3rd tortilla and cut it in half.  I placed the flat cut edges against the far sides of the pan so I had tortilla in every bite. This recipe has some kick but we like it that way.

This was so easy and super good. The kids loved it too. I did a layer of chili without beans in the center and it added alot of flavor. I use 1.5 taco seasoning packets and dry onion, dry garlic. Was excellent and will definately make again and again. The guys like it served with tortilla chips. While the dish bakes, you can make your own with the remaining corn tortillas. Cut into triangles with a pizza cutter and fry in hot oil until crisp. Flavor lightly with season salt while still hot and it's a great way to serve this dish for company or potluck.

YUM!  There are only 2 of us so opening a package of tortillas and a lb of beef to make tacos is usually wasteful.  This was a great alternative.  We ate some of the casserole for dinner and it tasted even better the following day re heated!!!

This is awesome, have had the same reply from everyone else I have made this for or gave recip[e to.  It might be a little spicy for some, but I don't think so, one family used salsa con queso instead of salsa and loved it

Very good!  I made it just as written, except I scaled it down a bit, since we didn't need a huge casserole.  It was wonderful.  The addition of the sour cream and green onion baked inside made the whole thing awesome.  I will make this again!

Awesome...  I low-carbed the recipe by using black soy beans and low-carb burrito skins, and it was beautiful!  I did cut back the sour cream by half (I'm not a big fan) and I left the salsa and green onions out (for the picky eaters in my family) to be used as toppings.  

I've now made it several times, and it is so-o-o-o-o-o good!

Thank you so very much for this recipe! My fiance and I enjoyed it SO much. We're making it again tonight. :) Also, if anyone doesn't have or doesn't like to add the extra spices, a good substitute is to pick up the "spicy" taco seasoning instead of the regular. I did this and it tasted awsome.

Excellent!  I made one change.  I don't like corn tortillas and substituted them for flour tortillas.  My husband liked it even better the second day.

Wow!  This was a great dish--even my picky children loved it!  I halved the recipe and still had plenty of leftovers for my family of 4.  Also, I added chopped tomatoes to kick up the veggie content a bit.  Otherwise no changes needed.

Quite nice, especially if you like mexican. I also did not use all the cheese or the spices as I found it spicy enough with the taco seasoning and the salsa.

This was really good!  I didn't use all that cheese...only 6 cups which was still a lot, but good just the same.  It was especially good over the next few days.  My picky kids even liked it.  I also used more chips in the layers.  Thanks for the recipe!
