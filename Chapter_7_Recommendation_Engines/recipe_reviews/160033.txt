I cut the recipe in half and I still had a lot of fuss free cranberry tea!  Taking another reviewer's suggestion I added some Fireball Schnapps to liven up the adult drinks a bit.  This would be a great addition to an apre ski gathering!

To make this more "adult" for your sans-kids celebrations, try this with a fifth of Fireball whiskey instead of the red hot candies. Same flavor but with a nice kick. This is VERY good either way.

I used this recipe for our mother's day tea party for our mom's group.  It went over well and made plenty!  The only thing I had any problem with was the color.  It looks a bit like tomato soup, however the taste is delicious.  Not too syrupy sweet and not too strong of a tea flavor.  Thanks for the recipe!
