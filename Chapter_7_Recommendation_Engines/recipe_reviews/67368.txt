This was an excellent and different slaw, but I followed some suggestions from other reviews to make it tastier. I also cut it in half. 
I used more dried cranberries and walnuts. I also toasted the walnuts as suggested.
I also didn't have white vinegar on hand, and so I combined balsamic, red wine, and rice vinegar all together. They really worked together well.
I used 1/2 as much oil, and less sugar too. 
I also didn't want to buy dry mustard, so I used dijon mustard instead. 
It was so delicious and I paired it with a pumpkin soup from this website also for a nice fall dinner. The slaw holds up really well too in the fridge. Just delicious.

Delicious!  I make this dish each Thanksgiving.  Making this hours ahead allows the flavors to marry.  Use organic ingredients, if possible, which is not only healthier, but more flavorful.  

Makes good leftovers for days, remaining crisp.  I made only slight variations.  They are as follows:

1) Chopped organic green & purple cabbage (16 oz)
NOTE: Using shredded may result in the wilting that some cooks have complained of.
2) Unsweetened cranberries - the corn sugar and/or syrup that is often added is unnecessary.
3) Sauteed walnuts w/ olive oil.
NOTE: Olive oil is not heat stable and should never be used over medium or higher heat.  It should really only be used over low heat to avoid toxic gases.
4) 2 Tbsp sugar
5) White wine vinegar vs. distilled
6) Olive oil vs. vegetable oil
7) 1 shredded carrot

View the photo that I've added to see the resulting festive appearance.  Yum!

This was DELISH! I subbed green onions for regular onions, added more walnuts (toasted). I found there to be alot of oil & dressing so I'll probably 1/2 the oil and chill out on the dressing next time.

Very Good and quite healthy!  I used less sugar in the dressing, but other than that I followed the recipe.  I ate this for several days; surprisingly, it held up quite well in the refrigerator.

Very Good!
I used green onions instead of regular onions, and used 1/3 of each kind of vinegar: white, white balsamic and cidar... they just have more flavour.
I made it for a shower and everyone loved it! I'm making it agian for easter this weekend.

I added the dressing a few hours ahead of time and don't recommend doing that. It really wilted the cabbage. I didn't have the dry mustard so I used fresh grated horseradish. I deleted the onion because I thought it would be to overpowering but I think next time green onions would work. I also used pistachio which made it really festive for Christmas Eve dinner.  There is way too much dressing left over. I suggest halving it.

Very good but will reduce the sugar and dressing next time. The next day the portion at the top of the bowl (furthest from the dressing that settled at the bottom) was great though.

I like this recipe and have used it many times. I leave out the walnuts but even so, it's delcious. A different, refreshing twist from normal coleslaw.

Not much flavor at all.  I made it for my son's graduation party.  There was WAY too much left over, so I wasn't the only one that felt that way.

I made this recipe just as stated but did not add the walnuts (just did't want the extra calories).  We loved the taste which only got better after a few days.

WARNING: After reading other reviews, I halved the oil and vinegar and it was still drowing in dressing. I added another full bag of slaw and it was just about right. I doubled the cranberries, doubled the nuts (used roasted almonds right from the bag for extra crunch) and nearly tripled the dry mustard. The ingredients together are delicious and make a light, fresh slaw. This recipe is just way off on the proportions.

So good I ate the leftovers as a snack!  I will be making this again soon!  I did make a few changes, however.  I used fresh green and red cabbages and sliced them into ribbons and added some Napa cabbage for a frilly touch.  I omitted the onion to please my family.  I also used three stalks of celery, one cup dried cranberries, and a half cup toasted walnuts.  I used white wine vinegar, extra virgin olive oil and a teaspoon of coarse grained mustard instead of the dry mustard.  No change with the sugar and salt.  I really liked the sweetness of the dressing.   This recieved rave reviews from family and guests!  Yummy!

This was a delicious variation of cole slaw.  I made it as a side with some chili and it was a great compliment.  I will absolutely make again and I have already done my own variation using the dressing for a chicken salad with the walnuts and cranberries.  Really good.

High rating well deserved and is an excellent alternative when you're in the mood for something diiferent than or in addition to your favoeite cream slaw. I halved the recipe and the ingredients still seemed to be pleasantly balanced for perfect flavor. I prepared this yesterday to go with Christmas Dinner menu. With the variety of dishes prepared for a large holiday dinner this slaw did not get the attention it deserves. I am going to make it again for our New Year supper and add it to my "quick and delicious - it's a keeper" list. Thanks for a freat recipe.

This slaw was a hit when I took it to a recent cookout.  The only change I made was to use apple cider instead of white distilled vinegar. I will make it again!

My family doesn't like cranberries so  substituted one apple and used apple cider vinegar instead of vinegar called for.  I also used green onions instead of sweet onions.  My family loved it!  But, the second day it didn't taste very good.  I'll only make 1/2 the recipe next time so I don't have to throw out so much.  That's the only reason I'm not giving it five stars.

We loved it.   My husband is not a slaw lover but he thought it was wonderful. it has just the right amount of tartness--not too sweet. not too sour.  The cranberries added color and flavor and the walnuts were a crunchy surprise.  I didn't have celery so I omitted it. we didn't miss it.  I also used a red onion which added color.  I only used about half the dressing so I put the left over in the fridge for another day. I will definitely put this recipe I in my favorite file.

Good flavor, but unfortunately I did not read the other reviews that warned against assembling ahead of time.  I made a few hours ahead of dinner, thinking I was giving the flavors time to meld, but this resulted in the cabbage being completely wilted and floating in dressing.  Next time, I would make half the amount of dressing and toss when ready to serve.  (I made this with pecans instead of walnuts because that is what I had on hand).

Pretty good and a little different.  I cut the amount of dressing in half and think I would reduce the oil a bot more next time.  It keeps really well and was still crunchy after several days.  Nice no mayo slaw.

I made this over the Christmas Holidays and all the family loved it.  I did halve the dressing and used only 1 T. of sugar in dressing as I don't care for a sweet taste on salads.  It's such a pretty salad for Christmas.  I told my grandchildren it was Christmas Confetti Salad to get them to taste it and they loved it.  The only other change is I toasted the nuts and used pecans as I didn't have walnuts.  Walnuts would surely be just as good.  Thanks Twiggs.

There is a difference between a stalk and a rib of celery. The whole thing ia a stalk and you don't want one stalk in this slaw. It's one RIB....

Delicious!  I used almonds instead of walnuts, and added a little extra vinegar and mustard.  I like tart.

In my opinion, this is WAY better than traditional cole slaw. The sweet taste of the cranberries is a great compliment to the tart dressing.

Tasty even using broccoli slaw, and the kids couldn't tell. I left out the celery though.

This is a great recipe and is always a hit at cookouts.  It is easy and can be made ahead of time.  I used white wine vinegar becaue I like it so much better than regular vinegar, so I'm not sure how it would be with the regular.  I also used dijon mustard instead of dry mustard.

The best cole slaw I have ate! Served it at Christmas and everyone raved. I did use Salad vineger instead of white.  I will be making this year round.

I was expecting better after reading the previous reviews. The coleslaw was swimming in dressing and all the vinegar made me pucker. I don't think I'll try this again, but if I did I'd cut the dressing in half and add more sugar. Oh, and don't make too far ahead if taking to a party  because the whole thing gets a pinkish tinge from the cranberries. Sorry, Twiggs!

Delicious...and a great slaw for the holidays with the red of the cranberries.  I added just a tiny bit more sugar and 1 or 2 T. of water to cut the oil a bit.  We loved the lightness of the dressing.  This is a nice change from the Asian slaw that my family loves.

This dish went over very well at a potluck for work.  I thought it was a bit too tangy but everyone else said it was okay and a few asked for the recipe.  I love the mixture of nuts and dried cranberries w/cabbage.  Overall it was a very flavorful dish.
