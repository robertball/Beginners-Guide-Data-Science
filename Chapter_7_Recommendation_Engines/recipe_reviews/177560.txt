This recipe was a good idea and with a little variation everybody in my house liked it. I did not use gravy mix or barbecue sauce, instead I used taco seasoning and about half a can of tomato sauce, Also I threw in some extra seasoning, onion garlic, chilli powder, ect. and a can of corn. Will make again.

This Recipe is a great starting point because it needs more flavor. It was perfect for my purposes because I was trying to replicate my husband's favorite dish from his Grandma's kitchen. A tough act to follow!  I used less gravy than the recipe recommends and added chili powder, garlic powder, finely diced jalapeno pepper for kick (my husband likes kick), subbed the beef for ground turkey, and added a 1/4 cup of sugar to the cornbread for the spicy/sweet contrast. Next time I'd sautee 1/4 cup onion into the turkey for even more flavor. :) It was absolutely delicious and we loved it! I'm going to keep this recipe.

This was tasty.  I nixed the gravy and bbq sauce and instead just used tomato sauce and threw in some corn.  After I had spiced it up based on others' reviews (cumin, taco seasoning, garlic, etc.) it kind of ended up being chili with a cornbread topping all in 1 dish.  Delicious.  Might work well for potluck where you need a 1 dish meal.

This was great. I sauteed onions and garlic in with the beef, added chili powder, worcestershire sauce, frozen corn, and black eye peas (instead of kidney beans -didn't have any), and plenty of bbq sauce. I also omitted the gravy. Once that was all mixed together, I stirred in a heaping scoop of sour cream.
Then I put a nice layer of shredded cheese on top of mixture, and topped that with lots of cornbread mix! 
Fabulous!

This turned out pretty good. It was pretty easy to make. I used ground turkey instead of beef. And I'm not a huge fan of kidney beans, but it turned out pretty good with the corn bread. This will be a keeper for weeknights when I need to quickly put something together for dinner. I'd probably try and add more veggies to the mix next time.

My husband and I enjoyed this.  Found it a bit salty, but I believe that was my error when making the gravy.

Had to make this gluten/dairy free....so that eliminated the gravy and BBQ sauce.  Followed other reviewers and used my homemade taco seasoning and some tomato sauce, added corn and some bell peppers.  Made the cornbread from scratch using a gluten free recipe.  Very good, everyone in the family really liked it!

After reading the reviews I was afraid we weren't going to like it.  Well, I can say the family loved it!  I left out the BBQ sauce on accident but added beef bullion into the mixture along with some garlic powder and chili powder.  It was great, we'll be putting this one into the dinner rotation.

Good start.  I loved the bbq sauce with chili, I always add lots of walla walla onions, sour cream, green and red peppers, chili powder, warcestire sauce, and whatever else i can dig up. The cornbread mix on top is absolutely brilliant!

We cut everything in half except the corn bread a baked a bit longer. We loved it, will be making again. Only thing we will change for the next time is maybe adding a little chili powder or old bay for a bit more kick.

Made this for the family and it was a big hit.  Not a fan of kidney beans so I added corn and peas.  But still a great recipe, I will be making this again.  Thanks!

My husband and I loved this. The barbecue sauce really makes this stand out from other similar recipes. I also used corn and green beans instead of kidney beans and made my own corn bread topping and beef gravy. We will be making this again and again.

one of the better recipes from Campbell's. I enjoyed this and see that is could be kids friendly if my kid ate anything that isn't chicken nuggets or pizza. I didn't care for the cornbread but that is easily subbed with buscuits. It was fast and easy a definite weekday dinner.
