The operative word is easy. This recipe celebrates the beans. The more ingredients and steps you add, the more you change the essence of the recipe. My only suggestion to those using fresh beans is that blanching is unnecessary - 10 to 15 minutes of saut√©ing gets them pretty tender, unless you like them totally soft, which I don't. Otherwise save yourself the time and effort and enjoy this very simple and delicious recipe.

I used fresh green beans and blanched them (Bring a large saucepan of water to boiling. Add 1 tablespoon salt and the green beans. Cook beans for 3 to 4 minutes or until crisp-tender. Drain beans and immediately plunge them into ice water. Let the beans sit in ice water for 3 minutes or until cool. Drain well and set aside).  Then I sauteed the butter, garlic, and salt, added the beans and cooked until tender, but still slightly crisp. Also added toasted slivered almonds.  Loved this recipe and will make again and again with these adjustments.

I made this tonight for my family, using fresh green beans, and I added some lemon juice as another reviewer suggested. My kid who dislikes all vegetables had thirds and then picked at the dish after dinner was over and we were sitting around the table.  Everyone had at least once serving, most people had two.  While I was only mildly pleased with it, everyone else at the table thought they were fabulous. So well done!

A delicious way to prepare frozen green beans.  Some freshly ground black pepper was added before serving.  I wouldn't hesitate to make this recipe again.

These were really good. I had a ton of green beans in the freezer from our garden and this fit the bill.  Followed the recipe pretty much except that I used extra butter, extra garlic and a little extra salt. Delicious.
Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe needed something more.  The second time I made it I used fresh green beans and blanched them first, as another user suggested.  I increased the garlic and also added shallots and sauted them in butter and olive oil.  Then I added the beans and cooked until just tender.  I finished off with some black pepper.  This was much more flavorful and appealed to my tastes.

Success!!! My daughter actually favored these over her chicken nuggets and was dipping them in ketchup like fries! The only change I made was I used a tsp of minced garlic from a jar instead of fresh and I may have used a smidge more salt than called for. It was pretty good! I'd make it again.

I thought these were delightful! It was quick easy to prepare. I love that the garlic wasn't so overpowering and it had a wonderfully subtle taste of butter. I just re-seasoned the beans with a little salt after they were done cooking. Will definitely make again. No lemon juice needed here. :-)

Very good! I have been roasting fresh green beans in my convection oven. We love them, but they can be very expensive in the winter. This is the perfect alternative! I let them get VERY brown, added a little olive oil and the taste was very similar, but way easier! I will be making these again. Can't wait to try these with some lemon salt or pepper!

These were okay, but seemed to be missing a major flavor.  After I added the juice and zest of one lemon, they were fantastic!  As-written, they were only a three-star dish, though.  We'll definitely have these again, but with the addition of lemon.

I know this is altering the original recipe, but I used fresh green beans and they were delicious! simply blanch (and drain) the fresh green beans for 3-4 minutes before adding to the skillet. I also added plenty of fresh ground black pepper - some while they were cooking and a bit more to finish them off. absolutely wonderful flavor! some mushrooms or onions could easily be added to make it even more flavorful. these can only get better! thank you, Nichka.

This is a simple and very tasty recipe. The only change was I added a little extra Kosher salt. My 14 year-old son (who isn't big on vegetables) summed it up when he said, "I gotta tell you, Mom, this stuff is the bomb."  Pretty high praise from a teenager.

Not a bad way to perk up frozen green beans. I would like to try this again using fresh green beans--I bet it would be even better.

Added a half cup of mushrooms during first step to saut√©... a splash of lemon juice at end for the win.  So much better than just microwaving the steamer bag of green beans, and so little work. It's a keeper.

I sliced a shallot and saut√©ed it in the butter  before adding the green beans. Just for a minute or two--not too crispy because you'll be adding the green beans and continuing to cook for a while.

Added splashes of lemon juice and more garlic than required. Would probably use a little more butter next time as the non-stick pan was supposedly the reason those beans weren't browning very well. Got there eventually tho and my folks loved them!

This is now my favorite way to cook frozen green beans.  I use frozen cut green beans because they are easier to find and cheaper. I also tried french cut green beans but I thought they seemed overcooked using this recipe.

Really tasty and easy.  I used more than 1 Tbs butter, and added a tiny bit of water because I used fresh green beans.  It did not need any other seasoning past the garlic and salt.  kids and adults all enjoyed!

I add roasted cashew nuts to the beans.   I also season with light soy sauce.   I blanch and then lightly fry the beans as I like to keep the bright green colour.

I have always fixed my green beans this way.  The only difference is that I let my frozen beans thaw for about 5 minutes and it cuts down on the amount of time that I need to cook them.  I like my beans al dente so this is a perfect recipe.  I have used this recipe with fresh green beans but I microwave them with a teaspoon of water for two minutes first before I put them in the fry pan.  That way they are not tough.

Easy and delicious - a quick, easy side dish. I also tried it with fresh broccoli instead of green beans and use Pam instead of butter. Yum.

This was a very easy recipe and my family and friends loved it! I made a few additions. I used fresh green beans instead of frozen, added some lemon juice at the beginning, and I added a liberal sprinkling of a grated blend of Parmesan, Romano Asiago cheeses a few minutes before it was finished cooking. This was really yummy~ I've had requests to make it for next Thanksgiving-

I made this without changing anything and it was very good. The second time I made it I added bacon because my family loves bacon and I also used infused olive oil that had some heat to it. It's very easy to make little changes to perfect it to your families taste, but it's a great base to start with and is wonderful as is!

The basic idea is good, however, I found it very bland.  I added more butter and more olive oil then called for but may also had more green beans as I did not measure them.  I also had to add a lot more season salt and garlic powder to make it our liking.  My 10 yr old liked them and I had two servings.  I loved the idea of using frozen green beans in the off season.

Warning: this may not be a fair rating because I don't like green beans. I thought this would be a good way to get me to eat them, though. I couldn't really taste anything but green bean, though. Maybe I'll double the butter & garlic next time?

I cooked my green beans closer to 20 minutes and added fresh squeezed lemon juice at the end.  I do wish it had a little more flavor but overall it was pretty good.  I'll read through the other reviews to see how to kick it up to 5 stars.

Enjoyed it very much with a few minor changes.  I used fresh beans cut in half and stir fried for a few minutes, then I added some lemon juice and let it simmer covered until the beans were tender.  My husband said he thinks it is his favorite way to eat all the green beans we grow.  Will try it this fall with the beans I have frozen this summer.  A bit of dried dill adds to the flavor.

Taste was fine, but the beans were really not cooked enough after 10-15 min.  I don't like mushy beans but I don't like tough ones either.

I used canned green beans and just dumped the juice in. Once the juice evaporated I added some chicken broth! Big hit with everyone from my one year old son to my husband!

Simple and not over-powering. Doesn't hide flavor of green beans, but compliments it.
