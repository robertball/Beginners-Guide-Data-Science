I had to give this one 4 stars because I had to make A LOT of tweaks. First off, a chowder is supposed to be thick and this was WAY too watery.  I used 2 1/2 Quarts of water instead of 3 (but would use 2 next time because it was still too watery) I used 3 cans of corn and 5 smaller potatos, I did add a hanful of chopped carrots as well.  I followed the  seasonings as mentioned but it was way too bland so added salt n pepper to taste (as mentioned) and did the same to the chicken boullion (as referred by another reviewer) I also added Onion powder and garlic powder to taste.  sprinkled a little parsley too. it was much more flavorful without being over powering after my tweaking.  I wish i could give you the measurments but as i said before, I did it by taste.  I then used 1 cup of water and 10 TBSP of flour but even after that, it was still too watery so I did the easy route and used wondera to thicken it up to the consistacy I was looking for.  It turned out GREAT but, only after the modifications.  I would def. make it again.

This recipe was very good after some minor "tweaking" I omitted the bacon and had two use 17 Tablespoons of flour and 2 Â½ Cups of Water to get the desired consistency because it was too watery.  Very good and filling,this is a keeper!

My husband is not a big fan of soup in general, but I love soup in the wintertime, so when I found this recipe we both were happy!  It is such a delicious recipe! We like it even better without the bacon and with extra celery!

I changed some of the amounts of this recipe so that it wouldn't make too much soup and left out the bacon. The combination of all the rest of the ingredients was absolutely delicious. A very warm and tasty winter treat.

This is a great recipe.  I think there is some confusion over the amount of water, the 3 cups is just to cook the vegetables.  I made it in the crock pot, added 2 cups of water and 1 cup of fat free half and half, it came out thick and creamy.  I also limited the amount of flour to about 1 tablespoon.
