Just as is says, it's a simple creamy dill sauce. We made it for perogies and it was very tasty. No seasoning on the perogies at all, just the sauce. Modification suggestion: use a better quality mustard than yellow, such as a grainy Dijon.

Quick and creamy sauce is the best way to discribe it. I don't always keep sour cream on hand and many of the other recipes needed it. Making the dill sauce was a last minute decision. I'm glad I choice this recipe. The only change I made is I added 1T. of creamy horseradish. It gave it a little zing. I will be making it again.

Very easy to make and is delicious! I wanted a breakfast sandwich like McDonald’s and this gave my sandwich that perfect zing.

Pretty good had to use a olive oil mayo and no salt because of diet. Didn’t have Dijon mustard so I tried it this way and I may not change a thing!

The only thing I didn’t have on hand was steak sauce, so I subbed liquid aminos. Makes  a great knockoff of McDonald’s breakfast sauce for bagel sandwiches!

Did not put steak sauce in it.  I used this to mix with roasted garlic fettuccine and it was amazing.
