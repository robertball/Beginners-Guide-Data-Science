I made these for a school function.  They were both tasty and beautiful.  I used dried blueberries instead of currents.  Wow!  Thanks for the recipe!

Dough was very sticky to work with! I kept adding flour. I did not add the currents or raisins (personal preference) and just made plain scones. Maybe that had something to do with it...probably won't make again, but thanks for letting me try a different scone recipe.

I made these today for my moms Birthday Tea Party. I used a biscuit cutter after rolling out the dough and then cut those in half to make bite sized scones for the Tea. I also used half of the batter to make mini chocolate chip scones. The fruit I chose was a bag from Trader Joes with dried cranberries, bluberries, golden raisins and cherries. They were not too sweet, even though they sound like they would be. These were just perfect! Thanks Ruth Ann :)

I found the dough to be overly wet, I added well over 1c of flour and the dough was still wet!  After having cut the scones out, picking them up was a nightmare, they were exceptionally floppy and lost shape(being a lady of taste, there is nothing worse than handling something and it goes floppy and losses shape!) Then I baked them..... they didnt rise atall, infact, they just spread and then burnt!  This isnt my first attempt at scones but this is my last attempt at this recipe.

Not overly sweet, lends itself to jam and butter.  I have made 3 times and they went over well all three times.
