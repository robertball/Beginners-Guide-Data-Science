This is a really delicious potato salad, especially with the background flavor from the horseradish and the kick from the freshly ground black pepper.  I added celery (in equal amount to the onion) and some fresh dill.  I also used equal parts honey mustard and deli mustard, instead of the yellow mustard; the honey mustard cuts the tang of the horseradish a bit and provides a really nice flavor.  Thanks for the dish!

Made this for the family and everyone gave it great reviews.  To me though, it was just missing a little something.  It was a very good potato salad and kept wonderfully for leftovers, but...  The horseradish does give it an unexpected flavor and is a good addition.

Yum, yum, YUM!  This is soooo good.  I'm not normally a fan of horseradish, but my hubby loves it, and he considers potato salad one of the main food groups. I made this with red potatos, and left out the onion (just don't care for raw onion) used onion powder instead.  I diced a whole jar of Klaussen(?)pickle spears to make up for the missing onion.(I think that made a difference, they are very crunchy pickles, yum) Everything else was done as the recipes says, I did try a little with some celery seed on top, and really liked that, too.  Not that it needed it, I just love celery seed in my potato salad.  Anyway, this will be my new recipe from now on, so delicious.  Thanks!

Nice, basic recipe – classic American mayonnaise and mustard based potato salad, just the way Hubs likes it.  But it was a little nondescript for me, so I had to tinker with it.  I added the optional dill pickle, but I also included some sliced celery for some contrast in texture.  To pretty it up a little with some color (and because I hate the aftertaste of raw, white onion) I used sliced green onion.  The horseradish was a nice addition, but so subtle that it was barely noticeable, so more could be added with no risk. Rather than salt and pepper I used Jane’s Krazy Mixed Up Salt and even more freshly ground pepper.  But most important, I don’t like an overly mayonnaise-y taste, so I cut it with sour cream, to probably a ratio of 50/50.  It needed to be a little gushier, so I dribbled in a little half and half, and I expect I’ll have to again tomorrow before I serve it.

Hmm - it was good but I was hoping for a more spicy potatoe salad - I put double the horseradish and no one could tell it was there. Not sure waht the point was. It was good but not what I was looking for - thanks anyway!

I halved this recipe, using 3 pounds of organic red potatoes. I used just under 3/4 cup of lowfat mayonnaise, I just kept adding it 1/4 cup at a time until it was where it needed to be. I added just a few spices to make the recipe more my own (onion powder, garlic powder, paprika, dill weed, celery seed, fresh ground pepper), I doubled the pickles and I added 1 teaspoon of Frank's Hot Sauce and 1/2 cup 2% shredded cheddar (my boys believe that it's not potato salad unless it has cheese....). Simple and super freaking tasty. I'm doing low carb and I had to stop myself after two bites....it's really THAT good. And I don't really like your typical potato salad! NOTE: Even halved, Husband thought this had too much mustard. I'll cut it down next time.

A classic potato salad that is very nostalgic and very yummy/addictive. Five stars, for both taste and the trip down memory lane.

If you are a fan of mustard-based potato salads, than this is a good one for you! I made this for a 4th of July picnic and everyone loved it. I didn't make many changes either. I did cut the recipe in half because I didn't need 5 lbs of it. The most significant change I made was to cube, and roast the potatoes instead of boiling them. I tossed them in olive oil and seasoned them with sea salt, pepper and dried dill. This not only kept them from getting mushy, but it also gave the dish another layer of flavor because I was able to season the potatoes directly. Also, adding the chopped dill pickles is a must! It brightened up the whole dish. I'm sure I will be making this again.

Wow! This tastes just like the potato salad you can buy at the supermarket (except better!)

I made a smaller batch so I used half the mayo, half the mustard and 4 eggs. Left out the onions and used onion powder instead. Also saved time and used 1/2 jar of dill pickle relish. 

Fantastic! Got rave reviews at the BBQ I made this for. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

One step saver is to boil the eggs with the potatoes. I use sweet pickles.  This is a delicious recipe.

I always read the reviews for a recipe before I make it and I saw quite a few for this saying it was missing something. So after I added the Mayo I put in just about 2 Tbs. spoons of apple cider vinegar I didn't measure it exactly. I thought this made a good addition to this salad !!

I only made potato salad one other time in my life (1992) and it was horrible! I was always scared to try to make it again. However, I found this recipe and decided to make it for my sons 2nd birthday party. It was a huge hit! I followed the entire recipe and only had a couple of servings left. I especially felt good since my Mom and great aunt are caterers and they said it was great! Thanks for sharing:)

This was DELICIOUS! I scaled the recipe back and added in some chopped sweet red pepper that needed to be used and just a little salt, but that was my only change. Great flavor, easy to prepare and super creamy~everything you would want in a potato salad. This is a definate keeper! Thanks for sharing. :)

I really don't like making potato salad but this one is easy and good.  The first time I made it, I made it as is written except left out the pickles.  The only people who detected the horse radish were people who didn't like it!   The next time I made it, I cut down on the mustard, added celery and substituted sour cream for the horse radish.  It might seem like I'm changing the whole recipe but I was inspired by the horseradish to try the sour cream and everyone loved it.  Thanks for the recipe.

WOW, this is awesome! I made only HALF, and after reading the reviews here I made some changes:

* Organic new red potatoes were used, NOT peeled
* Eggs omitted due to allergy
* Green onions instead of white
* Chopped celery added in equal amount to onion
* Added 1/2 lb. crumbled natural bacon, drained on paper towels and fat removed
* Added chopped parsley
* Cut the mayo in half
* Cut the mustard in half

This recipe is tasty and zesty!! I LOVE the flavor imparted by horseradish. 

Next time I plan to use white onions, as the flavor of the green onions was overshadowed, and omit the parsley. Also I wil make the full amount, as I went through about half of this batch in one sitting!!

Thanks for posting this recipe!

Delicious!  I added more onion, horseradish, pickles and pepper.  Next time I would use less mustard and MORE egg, but that's a personal preference.

Everyone really liked it!! I think I used a little too much horseradish sauce cause to me that's all I could taste, but a lot of people didn't really notice. I wished I put in celery (even though I dont like it), and I couldn't put in onion because of allergies, but it worked out well otherwise. Will certainly make again, and now I know what to improve on! Thank you!

Its good.  I didn't have horseradish, so I omitted it, and I poured a little of the dill pickle juice into the potatoes.  Its your basic potato salad...perfect in a pinch!

Tasty! Halved the recipe, and only added one finely chopped celery stalk for crunch. I think this is my new go-to potato salad recipe!

This is very good, but I agree with other reviewers that it needed a little something.  I added a couple tablespoons of sugar and it really rounded it out nicely.  I would imagine using sweet pickle relish instead of the dill pickles would have a similar effect.

This was really good and my husband loved it. I scaled it down to a serving of eight since it was just a side with supper. I left out the pickle since it was optional, and I left out the horseradish since my 8-year old really doesn't like it. For the 8-servings, I added one teaspoon of sugar to the mayo/mustard mixture. It was wonderul!

I gave it 4 starts because I still had to alter a few ingredients. It was still a phenomenal salad to start with! I modified the salt and used a "Johnny’s" type seasoning. I also increased the horseradish, pickles, and added pickle juice and Worcestershire sauce. yummmm....everyone was raving about this all night!

This was okay. It was easy to make and used ingredients I had on hand. But it lacked flavor and has too much mustard in it.

I decided to give this recipe 5 stars because it is good and it is a bit different.  The horseradish came through with just the right bite.  I used 1/4 cup drained dill pickle relish which had the perfect taste of dill.  I think this recipe would also be good with sweet pickles.  Thanks!

Made the recipe exactly as called for, like the potatoes cut up before cooking gave a nice shape.  Felt like I was eating globs of mayo though.  Next time I will use less mayo and half the mustard. Used drained pickle relish instead of regular pickles. Over all though a group pleaser.

Awesome! Great rich taste and perfect texture. I love the hint of spice and big potato chunks. I was shocked at the amount of mustard but obeyed the recipe and was glad I did later! I will totally make this again!

I made almost exactly as written except in half since there are only 2 in our family. I did add half sour cream for half the mayo and kept the horse radish at 2 T. I also used green onions instead of white and dijon mustard and it is delicious. My new favorite.

Awesome recipe!  This is so close to my own recipe, it is astonishing. One thing...I don't consider the dill pickles to be 'optional'...they are a must.  Also, I don't think I use a full 2 cups of mayonnaise when I make mine, but I DO add one incredible ingredient that makes it 'to die for'...BACON!  For this volume, I think that 6-8 slices, cooked crisp, would make this the 'going away' best.

A definite keeper. Excellent potato salad. I pretty much followed recipe but added more horseradish because I like it and added more dill pickle.  Next time may add chopped celery and chopped radish for crunch (and because that's what my mommy did).

I made this recipe today and my grouchy husband said, "Why can't you just make the good old fashioned potato salad?"  I followed the recipe as written and it was delicious.  He even liked it.  It was good old fashioned mustard potato salad with a twist.

I tripled this recipe for 40+ people.  My MOM wanted the mustard potato salad and I am not all that fond of mustard, so I went online to make sure I did it right.  I loved the horseradish kick!  I did add red wine vinegar and paprika to the top for looks!  Totally worth the prep!  Fabulous!

Good but as at least one other reviewer mentioned, the horseradish doesn't provide quite the kick that you might hope for.  I'll probably use this recipe again, but amp up the horseradish, and probably either use spicy mustard or amp up the horseradish a bit.  :)

Made this today for a mother's day dinner and the first time making potato salad. Followed most of the recipe. Used only 4 lbs. potatoes, 1/2 a small onion, 4 hard boiled eggs, 8 baby dill pickles and omitted the salt since the pickles were salty. I added chives and 1 teaspoon of dried mustard. I liked the little zip that the horseradish gave. Everyone liked it and had little left over. Might have to add bacon bits the next time I make this.

Very good potato salad!  Be sure to use real mayonaise...I tried light mayo the second time I made it and it ended up in the garbage.  We also like to use onion powder in place of the onion.  My husband has "texture issues" with some foods and didn't like the way the onion felt in his mouth.

This was very good but I actually thought the other potato salad recipe on this site, Southern Potato Salad was better, thus the 4 stars.  That one has garlic and I think that gives it a nice boost.  

This one has a more mustardy taste and a slight (very slight) zing from the horseradish.  Quite a nice recipe as well.

Hit of the BBQ. So often potato salad is bland but this one isn't at all. Very flavorful and everyone loved it. Next time for my own tastes I may put a bit more of the yellow mustard in but this recipe is a keeper.

I'm always looking for a great recipe for potato salad. Adding horseradish to potato salad was genius. I didn't change a thing and I added the optional pickles. Definitely a keeper!

I just made this to eat with our grilled brisket for the Superbowl game Sunday. I sampled it and it taste wonderful! I made it exactly as written,except added one stalk of chopped celery (because we like it and I needed to use it up)and halved it since there's only two of us. I will have to hide it way in the back of the fridge till then!! lol We will serve it with baked beans & a few hot wings too. Can't wait!! ;)

I'm very picky about potato salad. There's something about store-bought, that i really don't care for- a strange aftertaste that I can't place. Although this recipe has more mustard than I'm used to, I thought was delish! I think one of the best tips, is adding the onion, salt and pepper, to the hot, drained potatoes. I think it makes the onion more tender.

A very tasty recipe. Nice & creamy with good flavor. I omitted the pickles & added a few slices of chopped bacon and added some fresh, chopped broccoli I needed to use before it went bad. Everyone loved it. Thanks for sharing :)

This is excellent.  We always made ours just like this only used sweet pickle relish instead of dill pickles and put about 1/4 cup sugar in it.  Love this one.

Just a hint.......if you boil potaoes in their jacket they are soooo much tastier.  Simply boil them whole till tender, cool until you can easily handle them and peel the skins off.  Depends on your kitchen experience as to whether it takes a wee bit longer to peel them this way, but if you try it once, you'll notice a BIG difference in the flavor.  Also I don't add pickles of any kind to potato salad, but that's just to MY liking.

I halved this recipe for dinner. I doubled the mustard, omitted the horseradish and used 1/4 C. sweet relish in place of the dill pickles. (Putting the eggs and onions in the food processor gave them the perfect consistency.) This was wonderful with the substitutions for my taste.  Just like the deli's.

DELICIOUS!!  I used about 1/2 red potatoes (I don't bother pealing potatoes when I cook with them... adds color and texture!) and 1/2 turnips in the pot to boil; both chopped the same size.  I also omitted the mustard, horsey sauce and the dill pickles, subbing a 1/4 c (or so -- eye-balled it!) of relish... and added dried rosemary at the same time as the onions (so marry the flavors...)  This recipe is a great recipe to play with!  I'm sure I'll make it differently next time - I'm an experimental cook ;-)

It's in the fridge now, but my MIL, DH and hubby's uncle all tasted it and said it was great! There's a container of potato salad in the fridge from the grocery store.... may be taking that back (bc it's full of HFCS and preservatives -- yuck-o!)

If it's anything less than rave reviews: I'll update here... I'm assuming the flavors will only get much better in the fridge!!

Simple and delicious! I've made it several times for family BBQ's and always get high praise. The only thing I do differently is omit the horseradish because it's not something I ever have on hand.

Good!  Liked the horseradish.  Used Miracle Whip instead of mayo.  Added celery and onion; didn't add pickle but it would probably be good to add both dill and sweet.

Very delicious recipe!  I used a combo of yukon gold and red potaotes. some were peeled and some weren't.  I didn't use any eggs because I didn't have any.  I also replaced the dill pickles for sweet pickles.  This was very good!  I really liked the kick of the horseradish.  Delicious@

This was delicious! I used  a handful or so of dried minced onion because we don't like the big chunks of fresh onion on our potato salad. I also used regular salt in place of sea salt and I used 3 T of dill relish. I have an egg allergy that does not allow me to eat eggs unless they are baked into something, so I had to leave those out and it was still the best potato salad I've ever had! Next time, I'll add a tablespoon or two of pickle juice as well.

I love potato salad and this recipe is a keeper!!  I used red potatoes and dijon mustard because that is what I had in the house, and it came out great!  I will continue making my other recipe for potato salad also, but this is definitely staying in my recipe box for future use.  :-)

I finally found a potato salad that I could make that was delicious.   I made 5lbs yesterday for memorial day just for my family, and it was gone the same day, even my husband liked it.  I will use this recipe everytime, the only thing I did different was add celery, and I didn't have any horseradish, but I will try it with that next time.

I followed the recipe as submitted and it was very good, really, very good.  My husband thinks it might be his new favorite potato salad and as I am always asked to bring "my potato salad" to covered dish gatherings, that's saying a lot.   We'll be family taste-testing it on Christmas Eve.

Excellent recipe!! Easy too! I used red skin potatoes and left the skin on. I wasn't sure about some of the ingredients in a potato salad (horseradish / dill pickles) but was very pleasantly surprised with the final product. Only thing I added was 1/2 cup celery.

This is an awesome recipe.  My wife does not like potato salad and she happily ate this.  I did add bacon and added miracle whip.

I added more horseradish per tasting. If I wasn't out of dill pickles, I would have added them, because it was a little lacking in flavor but good. Overall, something different with the horseradish which was one of the best things to me about it (even if I did add more.)

So delicious! Used Polish Dijon mustard instead of plain mustard, which already has horseradish in it. Golfed the amount of mustard in the recipe since this mustard is very strong. The mustard gave the potato salad a nice bite, without being overly spicy. The pickles provided a little sweetness which was nice. Loved having the eggs in this salad as it provided another welcomed flavour.

I liked this, pretty easy and straight forward.  I used deli mustard instead of yellow mustard (ew) and the horseradish, and surprisingly it wasn't over powering.  I also added green onions and used two pickles. I cant wait to see what my husband thinks!  Hes kind of a potato salad snob :)

1st taste...perfect! I am not a potato salad fan but my loves it! Last time we went camping I bought a store made one and he liked it...this time I wanted to make one (I prefer making my own stuff)and I was thankful to find a recipe that was just what he likes...classic potato salad. I made it, mixed it, and gave DH a spoonful and he said it was great..no changes! Sweet!!! Thanks for the great recipe!

I leave out the horseraddish and put in fresh dill.  Also, I use new red potatoes with the skins on.  Perfect!  This is how I remember it as a child.  Thank you!!!

This was very good!  I adjusted to my families taste and to try to cut the calories a bit, I whisked half the called for mayo and half skim milk and horse raddish mustard, then added to the potatoes.  I also added some green pepper. Chilled for a couple of hours before serving.  Great recipe, thanks!

Absolutely the bomb! I wanted to add cooked bacon to this for some added flavor but this is a classic potato salad that is easy to prepare and simple to put together. The horseradish gives it that "umph" you are looking for....I used a wasabi horseradish mix and it was delicious! A very popular dish...Highly recommend this recipe!

Very similar to the recipe I make. instead of seperately using the horse radish and yellow mustard I use Deli mustard which is horse radish and yellow mustard. Love the extra spice!

Sorry Mom, but now my potato salad is better than yours!  Sadly I had no horseradish, but without, this is the best regular potato salad recipe ever! When I first tasted it, I thought it was WAY too mustardy, but it mellowed out in the fridge and was fabulous!  I added some chopped celery for extra crunch.

Good Recipe!! The only thing I changed was instead of adding pickles, I substituted with fresh chopped cucumber & sprinkled slightly with a finely chopped green pepper & red pepper & I topped it off with a dash of bacon bits  & paprika! ( I think the paprika made it even better, for those of you who like even more of a kick then the horseradish had to offer) Def a great recipe, my fiance couldn't get enough of it!! ( even better the next day as well)

I had two russett potatoes that needed used up so I choose this recipe. I scaled everything down to fit just the two potatoes. I was out of horseradish so I used a southwest sauce (I think it was made for onion rings) and did add the pickles. I would make this again.

Mustard was very overpowering. I love horseradish, as does my family, yet none of us thought it any good in this dish. All 5 of us did not care for this. Therefore. I won't make this again.

Very good, I was unsure about the addition of horseradish at first, but it really works, it gives a little zing but isn't overpowering, Like other reviewers I also cut down on the mayo and mustard, and added celery and celery salt.

I was looking for a different potato salad then I usually make. I tried this and it was great. I used tangy dill relish instead of chopped dill pickles. I will make this recipe again.

I've been making this potatoe salad for almost 7 year's.  This was a must bring with my friends when we would have our get togethers every week while stationed in Germany.  I don't add anything too it, I just make is as the recipe says. This is definitely a good base if you wanna add your own twist to it.

I've been looking for a potato salad recipe with a distinct mustard taste for a while - this is the best one yet. Ironically, next time I'll use a little less yellow mustard or sub in dijon.

6.4.18  Added a bit of chopped red bell pepper and parsley for a little pop of color.  Not convinced that adding the onion, salt and pepper to the hot potatoes really made a difference, but I did, and added the other ingredients 10 minutes later.  This was pretty good, wouldn’t say it’s my favorite, but it was enjoyed.  We love all types of potato salad in this house, and this one will be added to our list.

This was a great, different potato salad.  I loved the horseradish flavor in this, with the zesty mustard, and the tangy pickles.  I thought it needed a little more veggies added, so I added in some minced celery.  I think some bell pepper would be great in it also.  I used sweet relish in place on the pickles, 50/50 ratio of dijon to yellow mustard, and added in some dill.  We really liked this and I will be making this again.  Thank you for the recipe!

I have a sweet tooth, and avoid anything even somewhat hot or spicy. I skipped the horseradish, substituted miracle whip for mayonnaise, and used sweet pickles instead of dill.
It was a sweet delight!

This salad was the hit of the party! I doubled the mustard and horseradish, to make it extra zingy. I worried at first it was too hot, but after a day in the fridge it was perfect. Everyone raved!

Thank you very much for sharing your recipe.  It appears that many people enjoy it.  However, I had to toss out the mayo/horseradish/mustard mixture because it tasted horrible.  I redid it, replacing the horseradish with celery salt and received a tasty end product.  Again, thank you for sharing.  Although I didn't like this recipe, I can it as a blueprint for an altered version in the future.

The horseradish is what makes this, your guest will say there is something they cannot put their taste buds on, great job! No tweaking, just a great potato salad.

Great recipe. I used dijon mustard instead of regular and it gave it a really great flavour. I brought it to a family reunion and it was gone in no time! A couple of my aunts are professional chefs so you know it's good when they say so!

I cut the recipe in half but it was amazing.  I have always used green onion for my potato salad because I don't care for a strong onion flavor.  I used 3 small ones.  the only real difference this recipe was to my normal one was the horseradish.  It really does add a special something even though you can't pick out the flavor.  Mom and Dad, who are picky about their potato salad loved it.

This was a delicious recipe!  The only tweaks I made were to use horseradish sauce instead of horseradish, tarragon, and 1/2 mayo and 1/2 Miracle Whip.  Thanks for sharing this, JulieP!

This recipe is very similar to my dad's. He used Webber's mustard, which has horseradish in it the only thing different in the dressing is his has a little sugar in it and celery seed as well.

GREAT recipe!  I made this for the 4th of July BBQ and there wasn't a bite left.  I left the pickles out and added a little extra horseradish for kick.  Yummy!

This tastes amazing. I did take the advice of others stating the horseradish was muted, so I opted for spicy brown mustard with half yellow mustard. Yum.

Ive been married for 10 years and ive tried a few potato salad recipes because hubby likes it. Disaster. This one is great and walks you through. The only alteration u made was to use spicy brown mustard also just because my mother does. Great recipe, !thank you for sharing.

This is very similar to my mother's recipe minus the horseradish and we add 3 tbsp of the pickle juice in the salad.
To simplify I just use dill pickle relish.  Delish!

I just finished making this - I haven't even cleaned the kitchen yet.  This is seriously the BEST potato salad I've ever had!!!  I have to admit, I didn't add the horseradish because I didn't have any, but it was still FANTASTIC!!  Thankyou!!  I followed the recipe exactly other than the horseradish.  Great recipe!!

Love this salad, but what I didn't like is that the potatoes smush and it all becomes a heap of baby-like food. Kind of a unappetizing texture. However, the taste is nice. :)
