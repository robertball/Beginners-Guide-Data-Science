Having lived in Louisiana my whole life I can tell you that this is about as "authentic" a recipe as you can get.  Much better than the ones you will try with condensed soup as an ingredient.  The only thing I add is about half of a can of tomato paste (one of the really small cans).  This gives the dish a nicer color and a bit richer flavor.  I will also sometimes season my crawfish with powdered Zatarains crawfish boil seasoning instead of the hot sauce to add that "boiled crawfish taste" which is such a great flavor.  If you choose to use the crawfish boil seasoning I would caution to use it sparingly and add a little at a time because this seasoning has quite a bit of heat.

I've made this 3 times; it's a great recipe. The first time, I made it exactly as the recipe states. The second, I used chicken broth instead of the water and Cajun seasoning instead of the seasonings and hot sauce (simplified and improved). Liked it better with my alterations, but tastes great the way it is, too. The third time, I used cubed chicken instead of crawfish - very good.

It was my 1st time to cook crawfish etouffee and my husband just loved it, saying it tastes like an authentic Louisiana etouffee.  I used chicken stock instead of just water.  I also recently came upon Emeril's recipe of etouffee and was surprised that everything is very similar except that he adds cayenne pepper.

As a chef, I always use this recipe as a base for my seafood etouffee. I usually add tony's seasoning, shrimp, real crab meat, smoked sausage, and serve it over cornbreasd. You bes' believe it's 'shut yo mouf' good! I guarantee [gar-own-tee]!

We really loved this recipe. Since our frozen crawfish tail come already cooked. I did not put them in until the very end. Also I do not think that this is enough for 6 servings. My husband could have eaten the whole thing with no problem.

I made this with shrimp instead of crawfish. It was really delicious, but somewhat different from any etoufee I have had before.

This recipe was awesome!  I changed it up a little bit by doubling the amount of crawfish, and instead of wasting added the left over bell pepper and celery.  Plus a little more tabasco!! Two thumbs up!!!

This was a good recipe, but not spicy at all.  I was expecting something with more of a Louisiana flair, but at Emeril says, it needs "kicked up a notch."  Next time I would add more hot sauce & some cayenne pepper.  I did add hot sauce as I was eating it, so if you have people that don't like it real spicy follow the recipe & add hot sauce as you eat it.

Saw the recipe and was excited that it contained no tomatoes.  My husband made this, and the result was tremendous.  Made it again 2 weeks later--can't get enough.  Substituted shrimp both times.  The fragrance will stay in the house a couple days, however, have a candle ready!!

Excellent, with plenty of spice! I used Sriracha hot chili sauce instead of tabasco, and added cajun seasoning in lieu of the onion powder. I used a 50/50 mix of langoustines and shrimp because crawfish were unavailable and the result was not disappointing. Word of advice to the novice, though: it's best to ensure you have all ingredients necessary before starting your cooking, as that way you can truly taste what the recipe should be like. I'll definitely make this again for company so I can impress the tofu out of them.  :)

We are from the midwest and after moving to the Mississippi coast I started to explore foods of the region. This is one of the first recipes I made and it is awesome! We have sinced returned to the midwest and I search high and low for crawfish just to make this recipe. DELICIOUS!

My family loved this recipe!  My 3 and 4 year old girls, who don't like spicy food, ate it all and raved about how good it was.  Instead of adding the tails fresh, I bought some boiled crawfish and deshelled them saving the tail meat.  I added the crawfish tail meat along with crab meat and cooked shrimp right before serving and made it a seafood etouffee.  I will be serving this agian!  Thank you!

I liked it.  It wasn't like something I have in 'awlins but it was good.  My family had not had crawfish before so I served it to them.  After they said it was good, I told them what it was.  Thanks for the easy and delicious recipe!

I found the recipe to be family friendly with a mild to moderate heat level that my kids liked.  I did add a little more garlic.  Very easy to add more hot sauce, sriracha or red pepper flakes if your only complaint is that it isn't spicy enough.

I don't eat seafood but my husband says this is awesome. I also added way more hot sauce than the recipe. Served over white rice. The chopping of the veggies does take awhile so if you work you may want to do ahead or cook on a weekend.

I felt the flavor was lacking. Everything needs to be upped in order to get past the taste of the crawfish. Nice presentation and the rest of the family thought it was good!

An excellent recipe.  I followed another reviewers advice and added about a 1/2 can of tomato paste and used chicken broth instead of water.  This is a new favorite in our house!!  Thanks for sharing.

It was okay.  I used 1 1/2 lbs of shrimp instead or the crawfish.  I also had to tweak the sauce with creole seasoning.

Hands down, this recipe makes the best crawfish etouffee I've ever had.... and You can make it even better by substituting regular white rice with a good jasmine rice.

I personally don't eat fish but my husband claims that this recipe is better than one of the high end fish serving restaurants.  :)

Definately sold me on crawfish.  I used it for a special event and everyone raved about the flavor and color.
