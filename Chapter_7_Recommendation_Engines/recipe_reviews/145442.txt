I can't wait to have these tomorrow when we go camping! I tried them with the pie iron but over an open flame on the stove...just to make sure it would work before I lug it all to the campground. They are delicious! I subbed flour for corn tortillas and omitted the onion. I've found a new favorite camping food! :) ****Update**** I made these camping yesterday and they we SO good! My husband couldn't believe how good they turned out...I think he was a little leery of "campfire tacos." I had precooked the beef at home so all I had to do was assemble and cook once we started our campfire. I'm sure they'll be requested whenever we camp from now on! :)

These were awesome.  We always have a pie iron meal when camping and have tried many different sandwiches and treats but I have to say after having these, we have a new favorite.

I'm not a big fan of "traditional" mountain pies, so I was thrilled to find this recipe.  I browned and seasoned the beef before we headed camping so  all we had to do was make the mountain pies.  We kept it really simple and cooked w/the meat & cheese and then served w/FF sour cream.

This was yummy.  We simplified it and only did the taco meat and cheese inside.  Will definetely make again and bring extra to eat more and share.  Thanks for the recipe.

I tried these using plain bread instead of tortillas and they were really good.  I didn't have any salsa so I just used ketchup.

This was a bit of a disappointment for us. The taste isnâ€™t anything special and the taco shell texture makes the taste resemble a chimichanga. It was a change from the mountain pies, but we could have just as easily just ate the tacos as is.

We made these on a camping trip and served them with sour cream and salsa. While it's a good recipe and a nice break from typical camping food, next time I'd probably add peppers or use a spicier taco seasoning to give it a little more heat.

Made these while camping last weekend.  We made them with chicken and cooked the meat with the taco seasoning ahead of time.  My husband and I thought the were a great change of pace for camping.  Made the kids with only cheese, like a pie iron quesadilla.   There was some experimentation with the timing of the tacos in the pie iron.  We burnt the first batch, but then got the hang of it!  Thanks for the recipe!

we tried both corn and flour tortillas, both were great.  nice thing about the shells is that you don't have to watch them like bread, they never burned on us.  we had some w/ground beef and other w/chicken.  was a nice change from the usual burgers and dogs while camping.

this was great!  Of course you are thinking ...its just tacos but I will tell you what.. tacos over the open flame--out in the fresh area.. really really good!!!  try this the next time you go camping.  The only thing I did different was that I added onions and green peppers to the meat but that is how my family likes tacos.

These hobo tacos were very good while camping. We used small flour tortillas and cooked the ground beef at home before we left, which made putting it all together really easy. We used all our traditional taco fillings including olives, green chilis, tomatoes, etc. Some went inside the taco, and others on top after it was done. Delish!

Very good and easy to make. It takes some practice to figure out when "done" is done. The nice thing is you can let each person customize their own so everyone is happy.

These were fine.  They tasted good, but there wasn't anything special about them vs just grilling the shells on the grill like usual. I thought the kids would think it was more fun than it way.

I grew up calling the "pie irons," "Toastites." This was in the forties and I still have two or three of them I occasionally use. We always use leftover roast beef and gravy at home to make them. When camping, I've used them for pizza, (bread, not dough), and pie filling in them for dessert. I like the taco idea but am surprised there is no taco sauce added while cooking. I will have to try this recipe.

This has become a new camping recipe favorite. My kids prefer it with flour tortillas, I like corn better.  Very easy to do, especially since I made the seasoned beef at home.
