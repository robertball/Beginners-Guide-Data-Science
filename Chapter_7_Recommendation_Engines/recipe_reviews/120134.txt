Recipe is great as written. Not everything needs freaking cream of something soup.  

It does need a change on the cooking order. Ramen noodles turn to mush when cooked too long. For a more appealing less starchy texture cook the veggies first 3-4 min, then put in the noodles cooking them just long enough to get soft. That part usually doesn't take 3 min.

I didnt have high hopes for this one...  but was pleasantly surprised!  I added the cream of mushroom soup and a can of mushrooms.  At the last minute I added about a cup of sour cream as well.  NICE!  Very NICE!

Ok so I didn't really have high hopes for this recipe but I was really surprised. It is actually pretty good. I used ground turkey since that is what I had on hand and since I've got 2 growing boys in my family I upped the Ramen to 3 packages and left the water at 2 cups. I needed to make it spread. I used frozen Asian stir fry mixed veggies. Since that is the frozen mixed veggies that I had on hand. I don't know if this is supposed to be more soupy than what I ended up with but it came out really good. And it is a very cheap meal as well. Rarely can I feed my family for under 3 bucks! Thanks for the recipe!

This was a nice, quick, and tasty meal. I substituted a can of cream of mushroom soup for one cup of the water, and used ground pork instead of ground beef. It turned out great, and the kids went back for seconds.

Must admit, I was VERY skeptical about a recipe that pretty much utilized the dregs of my kitchen...but in an attempt to finally use that frozen pound of meat and my last pack of ramen, I gave it a shot.  I followed the directions to the letter but substituted a cup of water for a can of cream of mushroom soup as suggested by another reviewer. This dish is super easy, super quick, and just might get you out of a trip to the grocery store after a long day of work.

Excellent recipe! I did as others suggested and used cream of mushroom for 1 cup of water and since it didn't reccomend a flavor I used beef. I also was out of frozen vegies but drained canned worked. A great recipe for when you have nothing and want it to look and taste like something. I plan on trying different ideas with this recipe like using chicken ramen and chicken breast and cream of chicken. This is deffinetely going into my short list (recipes I use the most).

This is great in a pinch. I used 2 pounds of ground beef, 2 packs of ramen noodles, 2 cups of water, and 2 cans of cream of mushroom. Added two bags of frozen broccoli. I threw in some fried onion toppings and seasonsed the beef with garlic and onion powder and the ramen packets. It whipped up fast has alot less garbage than a boxed hamburger helper, which I used to use in a pinch.  Husband enjoyed it, I wasnt WILD over it, but it was good, and the mere fact that it throws together so fast might have me make it again. Maybe would add 3 packs of ramen noodles next time. I would really give this a try.

While it does not look very appetizing, it really suprised me. For a quick throw together meal it was pretty good. I will keep this on hand for another day when I don't feel like making an effort but need to get something on the table.

This was definitely a surprise!  I had only used these ramen noodles sauteed with butter for the salad with coleslaw, green onions, etc, so I had never seen them in lots of liquid and how they expand.  This was tasty and a nice new meal to use for a quick meal on the run.  Thanks for sharing it!

Just like other comments posted, I substituted a cup of water for a can of cream of mushroom, doubled the noodles and added a dollop of the Kraft Philadelphia Cooking creme (Italian cheese and herb). It helped give it much needed flavor. It came out very tasty, I will definitely make it again.

Quick and easy! Made recipe as directed but next time I will add more noodles, it seemed to be a little too much meat compared to noodles.

I did alter the recipe a bit, I used 2 packages of ramen crushed,3 cups of vegetable, a can of condensed mushroom soup and a cup and a half of water. While my meat browned I season with garlic, pepper, basil, marjoram, thyme, sage, savory, and rosemary. This came out very excellent and will be added to the weekly meal plan for one of our busy days.

Made according to directions and never will again.  My husband tasted this and said, "is this supposed to have flavor?"  My 18 year old son came home from college a little later and said exactly the same thing (the apple really doesn't fall far from the tree lol), got out a can of cream of mushroom soup, mixed, heated and ate.

Not a fan. Quick and easy, but not too tasty. My three-year-old ate it though. I think I prefer just a plain package of ramen.

I would have rather given this 3.5 stars, because I did modify it a little.  I did the can of mushroom soup, as other reviewers suggested and I browned the beef with half an onion chopped into it for flavor.  I also added a lot of black pepper on top.  I would have liked about twice the vegetables and some canned or fresh mushrooms, if on hand, would have been nice.  Good, fast, easy and hearty.  Next time, I'll do four cups of veggies, needs more green, but otherwise great overall idea.

It was OK, pretty easy to make.  I doubled the ramen. It definatly needed the addition of the cream soup.  I also added in a little sour cream as well.

Excellent!  When browning my 1/2 lean ground beef and 1/2 ground turkey, I added chopped onion, minced garlic and a little Kikkoman.  I then added the broccoli (that's what I had on hand.) I added the 2 cups of water and the popular can of mushroom soup suggestion.  I added the 3 packs from the ramen noodles and heated it all through.  Then I added the 3 packs of ramen noodles and simmered while my rice was cooking.  Loved it!

This is essentially hamburger helper. I did as other reviewers, and added a can of cream of mushroom soup. If you Add the condensed soup, dont forget to keep the water at 2 Cups or the mixture will become too dry. The taste was good; I would add onions rather than mixed vegetables. Easy to make and very affordable. Will test out on my husband when I am strapped for time, but I already know this dish is right up his alley.

I tried this as a cheap easy dinner one night. It was really easy, but very blah and bland. Thus the reason for only 3 stars. I can see how kids would love it though.

It was actually ok.  I used gr. beef and 3 pkgs of noodles along with 2 cups water and 1 can of cream of mushroom like others said.  Threw in some onions while cooking beef and added garlic and onion powder as well.  I used frozen soup vegies - all I had on hand.  Kids ate it.

The kids LOVED this.  I didn't hate it, but its not something I would share with others as a must try recipe.  I used 3 packages of beef ramen, 2 of the flavoring packets, and 2 cups water.  I took the advice of other reviewers and added a can of cream of mushroom soup to the mix.

The idea of adding veggies to this seemed kinda gross to me .... we needed a fast meal and I had taken out ground beef not sure what I was going to do with it.  I followed another reviewers advice and did add Cream of Mushroom soup.  Surprisingly this actually tasted really good ... not real attractive to look at but tasty.  My husband and kids liked it.

I made this a year ago and I didn't write down why I made some changes.  My notations say..... I added a finely minced potato, cooked the recipe longer than recommended, and added the extra seasoning packet and salt.  I served it all with just bread.  My comment was "Good , Easy".
