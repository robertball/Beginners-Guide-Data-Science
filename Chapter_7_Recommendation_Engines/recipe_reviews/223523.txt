Well, the hubby went nuts over this burger...even enjoying the avocado! FYI, there are three of us and I was able to get 3 burgers out of a pound of beef and they were huge! I can't imagine how large the burgers would be for 2,  a half pound a piece! Don't skip the freezing step, we had no problems with the burgers falling apart or flaring up. Good recipe, thanks!

This is one hell of a burger!  Flavors are wonderful.  It's a rare treat because of the size and richness but perfect for our Labor Day bbq.  I made 8 burgers and it was a bit challenging putting the patties together.  Still..think of this as a once or twice a year meal and it's well worth it!  Served with potato salad and corn on the cob....perfect end-of-summer meal!

I love the kick this recipe adds. I personally don't like 'filler' in my burgers, so I left out the bread crumbs and added an egg to help hold the patties together. I cut the bacon grease in half since I didn't have the breadcrumbs to soak up the extra liquid.

My husband doesn't eat red pepper flakes, so I left them out.  Since I was using ground round and bacon that was precooked, I just crunched some of the bacon (which I finished cooking, but didn't have enough bacon fat per the recipe) into the beef with the ground pepper and breadcrumbs before forming the burgers, being careful not to let any of the bacon bust out from the beef lest it burn.  The freezer part is really important--the burgers held together very well on the grill.  They were really delicious.  I will definitely be making this recipe again--thanks!

I made these according to the directions and they were very tasty, perfect for a special grill out meal!  I will say that the burger shapes were a bit deformed bc I think my patties were too thick and edges not joined enough, so be sure to make your patties THIN and crimp the edges well!  Otherwise these will be delicious alien-looking burgers. Thanks for posting, will try again!

I didn't quite manage to get the two parts to seal properly so I ended up essentially with two patties with melted cheese between them instead of one big patty with cheese inside. My only real complaint is that this is a really massive burger that is a challenge to eat, but the taste was amazing, though it was a bit too spicy for my wife. If you don't do spice, this isn't your burger.

This was an easy recipe. I omitted the avocado and added a TBSP of Worcestershire sauce  for flavor.  VERY flavorful! I would definitely  do this again!

Instead of buying shredded cheese, I bought pre sliced and folded the corners in between the patties before sealing them.  I intend to make this again.  I think a slice of onion would have been great, too!  This is my new go to burgers on the grill recipe.
