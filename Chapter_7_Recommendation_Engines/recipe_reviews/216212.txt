These were very easy and taste really good. I made them for my cookie exchange. I made 3 batches in about 1hr 45 min. I think the key to cutting them is to follow the recipe for cooling for 2 minutes. I cut them immediately and had no problems. Very tender and buttery. I think they were terrific.

The cookie tastes fantastic...BUT....the recipe (followed exactly) does not make a very stiff dough. I'm not sure how you can expect the "log" not to spread out across your cookie sheet while it bakes- which is exactly what mine did. I ended up having  to bake mine in a bread pan. Next time I make this I plan to use more flour...I don't know how else it would hold it's shape.

These were perfect for my sweet tooth fix. I actually added 2-3 TBS of all-purpose flour and it gave it a flaky cake texture which I really enjoyed. It absorbed the butter without giving off that greasy cookie feeling. Yum!
