This is my favorite Sals recipe.  You can use this for any occasio,and it is mouth watering.  The only problem I have had with it is finding good peachere year round here in Louisville, KY.  The other ingredients make up for the peaches I have to settle for.  Mealine should have won the best recipe in the Dip and Dunk contest--ya'll should have voted and then got your friends and family to vote.

This salsa had a wonderful and unique flavor. I only used about two peaches (fresh peaches are a must!) and then used 3 tomatoes rather than two. I also only used a half of the ranch seasoning packet. I just ate it with tortilla chips, but I think this would be good with chicken or fish as well. Thanks for a yummy and different salsa recipe!
