This is a great recipe, easy and tasty. The only thing I would like to advice you is that instead of making 12 big conchas (on a 12 portions recipe) make the balls or conchas smaller around 20, they are easier to handle and the crust seems to hold better than in the bigger ones. I had a blast making them and the crust was so easy to decorate. In mexico usually we make not just the shells all kinds of decorations use your imagination...Thanks again for the recipe...they are delicious!!!!!

I thought that this was pretty easy and love the buttery taste of the topping. The recipe calls for 4 cups of flour, but I only used 3 cups. I did let it rest for 10 minutes before rolling into balls. After reading reviews I decided to use 3 teaspoons of yeast and for those of you who don't know how to measure 3/8 cup of sugar, I googled it and it said use 1/2 cup minus 2 tablespoons. I did take the advice from a review that said to heat the milk, which I did for about 20 seconds. Please watchful of the time!! I did 15 minutes and it was starting to over cook I think 12-13 mins will work. It was cooked all the way threw also. Will make again thank you for sharing

Very sweet and very yummy!  I sent these to a spanish/english class my husband helps out with and they were gone, gone, gone! :-) I made the dough in the bread machine and the topping by hand.  Excellent!!!!!   My kids asked me to make them again.....soon!  Thanks for the recipe!

We made these for our Girl Scout Thinking Day today.  They were a huge hit and are so delicious!!

for those having a problem with the density of the dough...I actually did them overnight.  I made the dough and rolled with the topping the night before. While making the dough let the yeast bloom in the warm water first for 10minutes or until foamy. Then proceed with recipe.  Proof to double in a warm place (very important).  Roll and top with topping and place rolls on a baking sheet.  Then in the morning set the oven at 200 degrees with a bowl of water at the bottom.  Turned off the oven, add the rolls and let the breads proof to double.  Remove from the oven and preheat to 375 degrees.  Bake as directed.  They weren't dense at all and were light and yummy.

I thought the recipe should have included letting the yeast bloom and foam in the warm water for a few minutes before adding the other ingredients.  The first time I tried the recipe the dough wouldn't rise.  It also needed to included temperature of liquid.  I warmed the milk a little so that the yeast could bloom.  I had to add a little extra milk.  I think if one really knows the science behind bread and yeast it could be a great recipe but for someone that has little to no experience with yeast breads it could be a waste of time and money.

This was really good.  Only change I made was in the topping, instead of using vanilla extract in half, I used almond extract.

This recipe came out too heavy -- even doubling the rising time the dough was unable to rise to 125%, much less 200%, and the conchas came out heavy and gluey.  

I spent a total of 15 minutes actually working on it.  It's a bummer, because I love conchas.

Great little sweet bread, just like the ones in the mexican pan shops. I made 12 that were smaller then i expected so next time i will double the recipe and make 12 big conchas like the ones i remember.  Eat them fast or the topping losses its crunch.

Secret tip:  I tried this recipe for the first time. The first time
the taste was great, but following directions I got very small and compact breads. Second time. I put the dough covered in warm oven(off)
and let the dough rise to double. About 1 hr 1/2. Then I punched it down,made the dough balls,place them on cookie sheet,flatten them a bit, place topping,make decoration,. I then placed them back in the warm oven (off) and let them rise about 2 hrs. They were huge!!! Just be patient and let the dough rise. You won't be disappointed. I used about close to 3 tsp yeast.

I loved these conchas.  They are much denser than the conchas you get in most panaderias but I actually prefer them this way.  I'll definitely make these again.

I am updating my original review to 5 stars.  My hubby had told me the first time I made them they were better than any bakery.  I thought he was being sweet.  But, I made them today and sent 2 home with a Mexican man who is doing some tile work for us.  He actually called my husband when he got home and told him they tasted like what he used to eat in Mexico and both his wife and kids absolutely loved them!  That made me feel pretty good since I am just a white girl...lol.  I only made one change to the recipe---I added an extra egg yolk.  I will be making again and again.

This is a great recipe. The one thing is that I found it doesn't take quite 20 minutes but more like 15 (I do live in a high altitude city, that probably has something to do with it). But they turned out so well!

I was introduced to Mexican sweet bread when I worked on a tree crew, and we used to go to the local bakery to get some every morning for breakfast. I've kind of missed that little tradition, and finding a close approximation really made my day, since there are no panderias where I live now. My parents liked the recipe, too. Thanks, Melissa.

I am rating these based on my kids' comments, because I don't personally care for conchas.  My kids love the sweet bread we buy at the Mexican grocery store, but it can be pretty expensive, so I was happy to find this recipe.  They tell me these taste exactly like the ones at the store, only better!  The first time I made them, I used the vanilla and cinnamon flavored toppings and the second time I made cinnamon and chocolate (just used unsweetened cocoa powder instead of cinnamon or vanilla extract).  I'm looking around to see if I can figure out how to make the strawberry and mango flavored ones so my kids can have all the different varieties available at Vallarta supermarkets.  Thanks, Melissa, for giving me the ability to make a special grocery-store treat for my kids at home :-)

MELISSA* Is there any way you can have the recipe for BISCOCHITOS??? They are cinnamon and sugar cookies. If so PLEASE POST. Thank you.
 I warmed water and milk together in glass measuring cup for about 15-20 seconds in microwave. 115 degrees, then placed in bread pan machine with softened butter. Just made dough in bread machine. Took 1 hour 20 minutes.  Took out and kneaded a few times, then divided into 12 pieces,  The topping was mixed by handmixer and was crumbly. Put together and made a long rope, then divided.  For each topping, I pressed sugar dough onto cutting board and flatten with palm and then sliced a shell pattern with sharp knife, then placed on dough.  Rested for 45 min.  Baked for 20 minutes. (Next time for 14 minutes). I used vanilla extract for the topping. Shared with neighbors, and they loved them.  Hubby really liked them too.  Thank you for sharing a great and fantastic recipe. For those who have problems with the dough or topping, use real butter. Make sure water and milk are 115 degrees. This is the difference in results. ***UPDATE****Made again only using 3 cups of all-purpose flour with 1 cup 100% whole wheat with the addition of 1 Tbsp. of Wheat Gluten.  Baked for 14 minutes and perfect timing. Came out light and airy. I did make smaller conchas. About 2 dozen. These came out lighter and airy than with all-purpose flour. Either way, both ways came out delicious and fantastic. This is a KEEPER RECIPE.

Maybe more of an americanized version of a concha- but so delish!
Used 3-1/2 cups flour and used 1/2 butter 1/2 crisco in the dough part of the recipe- omitted the cinnamon- and added vanilla-used regular milk instead of evaporated-
Did it all in the bread machine- worked perfect!

AWESOME!!!  I used to eat this every Sunday with hot chocolate. My grandpa would always go to the Mexican market and pick this up after church.  After my grandpa left, the tradition stopped. I have been wanting to bring it back and what better way than making it with the kids!!! Te querro mucho abuelo! I'm gonna share this with all my tias and primos so this can become our family tradition after Sunday mass

This is a nice recipe, and fairly easy to make. My only difficulty was with the cinamon-topping; it ended up too crumbly and wouldn't stay together. It was probably my own fault, but if you have that problem too, I recommend adding a teaspoon of water to that part. 

And by the way, I didn't notice on my own, but my dad pointed out that this is basically a fairly normal bread with sugar cookies on top. He thought I should've just made plain sugar cookies, but I personally prefer this.

These were wonderful! Never having eaten one before, I was trying to make something from my husbands childhood and he said these were better than he remembered. Our neighbors also went crazy for them-will be making these again very soon.

I used a 1/4 oz pkg of rapid rise yeast and let the dough rise for 10-15 minutes while I was making the topping, other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  Also, they were done baking in 15 minutes.  These were easy and fun to make and taste great!  Thanks for the recipe!

Mine didn't turn out looking like the pictured ones. I didn't add any crisscrossing so maybe that's why. They tasted like cinnamon buns. I found they tasted the best when I cut them in half, put some margarine on them and placed them in the microwave for 20 seconds. I would definitely make these again sometime. :)

These were perfect...slightly sweet and wonderful with coffee.  I made just two modifications. I never use the full amount of flour called for in yeast breads recipes.  I stirred in 3 and 1/2 c of the flour and then kneaded in enough of the rest of the 1/2 c to make the dough manageable.  It did not require the full 4 cups. And, since I use a very potent cinnamon, I used only 1 tsp in the topping and splashed in a little almond extract as well so that the cinnamon topping was as moist as the vanilla.  These are large rolls, so you could easily cut 16 instead of 12 and they would be great.

Awesome recipe.  Yes, they take some time to make and yes, they take some skill, but they turned out perfectly.  I used my stand mixer and let the dough rise quite awhile the first time since it was cold in my kitchen.  One secret to patting out the topping is to knead each ball in your hand for a minute to warm it up.  Then pat it out on waxed paper and lay it on top of the bread.  I also flattened out each dough ball a little so they would be more like hamburger bun shape which is what I'm used to from bakeries.  Excellent recipe and I will definitely make this again.  The bread turned out light and flavorful.

I made this recipe exactly and the Conchas came out exactly like the ones Ftom Panaderia's. They are one of my favorite sweets, but 7 yes ago I found out I was allergic to dairy and most of them either have dairy or are made in kitchens that do, have not had one in about 4yrs.

The dough is dense, it's supposed to be, you just have to make sure when the dough rises, that it rises in a most warm place, preferably a proofer, but if not, as other ppl will mention a warm oven and a bowl of water will work just as well.  

The key is not the time for Rising, the key is that it has to double, so even if it takes longer, make sure that it doubles. :-) did not have any issues with the amount of of flour, the sugar mixture (i think paste is a fairly accurate description for the consistency it needs to be to cover the precooked buns), orcooking time either.

When I ate them fresh out of the oven, they did not taste as I remembered, but after that sat a few hours, they tasted just as I remembered the ones from the Panaderia tasting.

Bottom line, I don't think the recipe is why people aren't getting these to come out right, it's the people not making certain they rise enough before cooking them.

Just finished making these conchas and they were DELICIOUS!!! I added about a 1/4 tsp of anise seeds to the dough witch gave it extra flavor. I also added a 1/4 tsp. of cocoa powder to the cinnamon topping. I would also recommened letting the water and yeast sit for about 10 minutes before starting the dough and also warming the milk just a tad bit. I am definitely making these again. Thanks for the recipe.

These turned out good; however, the topping never resembled "a thick paste". I think you should divide the vanilla between the two topping bowls to make the dough stick together better. The cinnamon topping was dry and crumbly...

This recipe was sooo good. For the topping though I add 2t or cinnamon and 2t of cocoa powder. Also, I didnt use the 4 cups of flour, it was more like 3 cups. Overall, these conchas were delicious!!

These taste just like the ones from my mexican bakery!  With the topping I made two colors and added almond extract to one color, vanilla to the other.  I also doubled the recipe and made the pastries 2 inches across to make just over 50 of them.  I took them to a gathering at my Tia's house and everyone loved them and couldn't believe I made them!  These are also really good dipped in coffee!

i have made these several times, this recipe is pretty close to perfection.  My mother's new husband was born and raised in the heart of mexico, and usually has something negative to say about my cooking, but when i make these he has nothing to say at all because he is busy scarfing these bad boys down!  My kids love them too and it is so much cheaper than paying for them in stores, and definately better tasting than any store brand.  I will be using this recipe for years to come.

My Latino boyfriend didn't like them at all, he only ate half of one-he eats everything.  My son didn't like them either.  I thought they were tasty, but the bottoms kind of burnt, but I had to keep them in that long to make them cook through.  The times for rising need to be adjusted.  These are very dense.  I made them as directed with no adjustments.

Decent bread, but not authentic!!! I've lived in Mexico for 7 years. I was really excited to try this recipe, and don't get me wrong, it turned out fine... But absolutely nothing like real Mexican sweet bread, which my husband and I enjoy from a local bakery regularly. My (Mexican) husband agreed.

I've never made conchas, but I've eaten them since a child.  My daughter loves them now too.  I buy them at our local meat market and they are hit or miss.  These were awesome!  My daughter and I devoured 2 right out of the oven! I followed the directions exactly as written.  It's cold here today, so I turned my oven to 200 and then turned it off to keep the dough and make it double.  These took some time to make, but the recipe is so easy and worth it!  Thanks so much.  I will definately be making these again and again!

These are fantastic! I did substitute bread flour instead of all purpose flour for the dough. Also I didn't have any evaporated milk so I had to use regular, but everything still turned out great. If you have a bread machine, you can use the dough cycle for these and it saves some work. I can't believe how good these are! Thanks for sharing!

Pretty and yummy! I can't really state if the bread is authentic or not because I never had them before. I describe the bread as dense & a bit dry but of course the sugar topping makes this delicious. If I were to make this again, I would use my favorite dough. Make sure to have a plate or napkin because the topping will crumble when you bite to em'. The only change I made was to use regular milk instead of evap. milk. I had used up the evap milk from making a different batch.  I think reviewers are getting confuse with the topping not being "thick paste". They should take that out of the directions. Well, I admit, I was a bit confused too when I started making it, but I followed the topping ingredients and as long as it can be formed into balls and flatten into discs, you're good to go. Also, I halved the recipe and made 12 sweet breads. I think its a perfect size.

I was expecting this to come out like real conchas given the high rating.  Well, it's nothing like real conchas.  I'm married to a Mexican, I know.  He thinks they're terrible (I'm disappointed too).  They came out the texture and consistency of cinnamon rolls.  Much too dense and biscuit-y to be a true concha.  Plus, none of the conchas we get at a panaderia have cinnamon. Weird.  I'm still looking for a good concha recipe because I'm sick of buying them all the time.  They're my husbands favorite thing to eat with coffee.

This is a pretty good recipe for conchas.  The dough rose nicely for me, they baked well, and the finished product was a medium soft bread with a satisfyingly crunchy top.  My family said they reminded them of cinnamon buns (both in scent and flavor).  Good recipe.

Tasted great, just like the conchas I used to buy at Mexican stores in Arizona.  I love conchas and coffee for breakfast, and this recipe hits the spot.

So much work for nothing. It wasn't even eatable. After adding all the ingredients, the dough didn't rise - I'm guessing it wasn't warm enough. The amount of salt is way too much, they weren't even sweet. I love conchas and followed this recipe closely.

oh my what a recipe! The conchas were so good!! I followed everything exactly and although it didn't rise they turned out so great and tastey. Better than the local panaderia only a bit smaller. I'm still not sure why they didn't rise both times but when it tastes this good I won't question it! Thank you so much for sharing this. I'll never buy stale pan de dulce again ;)

I am also from Mexico and believe me when I tell you that I've had many conchas.I really didn't like this recipe and I consider myself an excellent cook and baker.I give this recipe a *** because yes they were edible but did not taste like conchas.They are very dense and nothing like this fluffy goodness of real conchas.The topping I must say was pretty good

I used coconut extract instead of vanilla, just because I can't find many uses for it. My Mexican husband said they taste just like the ones they sell in Mexico. I was disappointed with the topping mixture, because it melted, and flowed onto the pan, making the cut square design on top stretch... I'm guessing it was from the liquid in the extract. My husband said sometimes they're deformed like that... Next time I'll try the cinnamon topping.

This smelled so wonderful.  It's unmistakeable.  The bread part was soft and not sweet, spot on.  I ran into a little bit of trouble with the topping.  Preparation was no problem but it was a little too crunchy and sweet.  In mexican bakeries the topping is more powdery and less sweet.  Next time I think I'll make with with 1/2 c sugar and 1 1/4 c flour.  I'll update after I make that one.  Also, that much cinnamon seemed out of place unless that's the flavor you were looking for.  To make a more plain version I used 1/4 tsp of cinnamon in the dough and I used none in the topping and opted for 2 tsp of mexican vanilla instead.  Used 6 drops red food coloring.  Overall, good recipe!

I made this 11 years ago for my 1st year of Spanish project.  The flavor is so distinct and wonderful that I decided to make it for an office El Cinco de Mayo party today.  Everyone loved it!  It takes some practice to create "the shell" look, but it is well worth the effort.

The bread itself was a bit more dense than other recipes I've tried, but the topping is the best! This is the fifth concha recipe I've tried and I'm keeping it for the topping.

Excellent Recipe... just like the ones in the Mexican Bakery.  The shell design is not as hard as I thought it would be too.  A few pointers:
Be sure to watch them! Mine got a tad darker real quick.
Eat them right away!
If you can also split the topping in more ways and make different flavors.  A traditional one is Cocoa (my favorite!)

I thought this recipe was pretty easy, but it took me three times to make it right. ha ha... Couple of changes I made: 3 teaspoons of yeast let it rest for 15 mins. Used low fat milk. Let my dough rise in preheated oven 200. (but of course make sure the oven is off, before putting your dough in it).

Easy to make, but didn't care for the dough or the topping. To me, I think the dough should have been slightly sweeter and less dense. The topping was okay, but the texture was a bit odd. Put together, it was pretty flavorless. I would not make again.

I consider myself a breakfast master. I am always looking for new dishes and ways to spruce up the classics. This sweet bread looks and tastes beautiful. It is also simple and impressive. I was very pleased with the results. Next time i'll make them a little smaller, I think a smaller size would be easier for me to manage.

These turned out really good. Just like the ones you buy in la panderia. I was attempting to make these during the night as my grandkids slept for a treat. They smell so wonderful cooking they all woke up and insisted on having them right from the oven. They couldnt wait for them to be cool enough to eat. Will make these often as they want some to take to their house too.

These are delicious. Used my bread machine to mix and raise the dough (worked great). Had a problem with the topping, but only because I had to defrost my butter in the microwave and it made it to soft. Had to spread it on like thick frosting, but it worked fine and they are TASTY!!

Terrific recipe! My wife made the bread using the ingredients exactly as directed and it was excellent!  But instead of making 12 conchas, she cut the portions in half and made 24 - the perfect size. She also baked them only 12 minutes. The dough rose perfectly in a warm oven (1.5 hours and then 45 mintues after applying the topping). The bread was very light and airy, and tasted great with the sugar topping. Thanks to Melissa Amador for sharing this recipe.

These were good but I will have to try again with a different flour.  I used a wheat bread flour and my husband said they were good but tasted a little "healthy", lol.  The top was fun to work with.  I added a little too much vanilla to the half I did that flavor and the artwork I did kinda smoothes away.  The cinnamon side was beautiful though.  thank you!

Wow! These are awesome! I was a bit worried about them rising but everything went very smoothly. They rose both times and came out HUGE. They were ready in only 13 minutes and my Mexican husband said they were better than store bought! They looked very pretty too. I split the topping into 3 small bowls and made the traditional white (vanilla), brown (cocoa), and pink (just a couple drops of food coloring). I highly recommend this recipe!!!

I must not have made these correctly...not quite what I expected. My topping didnt mold correctly into shape and the bottoms burned at 20 minutes. They are good, just not perfect. I will try again though.

Very authentic taste!  I made some adaptions with the condensed milk, which I substituted it with soy milk, and it turned out just fine.  Suggestion:  I think that there is too much topping, so you do not have to use it all... also, I do not know if I didn't measure correctly, or if the weather in my kitchen was dry, but the topping was a bit to dry to form.  I will definitely make these again.  A triumph!  Better than at the store.  Of course.

This is an excellent recipe! I thought the topping was going to be hard to put on the rolls.  I found out that if you flatten the topping on clear wrap, the topping is easy to lift and put on the rolls. My entire family enjoyed these!!

Not really satisfied with how they turned out, though my family liked them.  I thought they were quite dense and sort of gummy and the bottoms were a little too brown.  I miss them though, I moved from California, were you can find them anywhere, to the northeast.  Like the other reviewers, I think 15 mins would bake them perfectly.  Next time I will only make a single batch and put a little bit more yeast and knead the dough a few more minutes and see how they turn out.  The frosting came out perfect, I wouldnt change anything. Will keep you updated.

To get the dough to rise properly you need to get the yeast to bloom. Mix it into a bowl with the warm water plus about 2 Tbsp of the sugar needed for the dough and let it sit for about 10 minutes until the mixture turns foamy, then mix it in with all the rest of the ingredients

Very easy and enjoyable recipe. I did use vanilla bean paste in topping mix, that is the only thing I changed. Turned out very good and tasty.Remember when allowing the dough to proof temperature is key. Needs to be 75° -77° in the box or in the area proofing them in. If you have to put a tall slender glass in middle of sheet pan and bag it. This will hold temp and reduce proofing time. Hope this helps.

So time consuming but everyone who had them said they were great! I liked the cinnamon topping more than the vanilla. maybe because the vanilla extract i have is bourbon vanilla... not a great taste. I loved them and will make them again.

Amazing! I could eat ten in one sitting. They are the perfect balance of soft and crunchy. I add a little milk to the cinnamon topping to make it come together like the vanilla one. I burned my tongue because I couldn't wait long enough for them to cool before eating them.

this is the 2nd time doing this conchas...they came out pretty good! You can definitely cut on the sugar (they're too sweet for me) and start checking in the oven after 15 min... they can burn easily... (made 12) oh, instead of cinnamon for the coating, I used cocoa powder, just add a tbsp. yummi

Not sure why there are ANY bad reviews on here. I'm not the greatest baker and made these easily. They turned out great! They are a little more dense though. If you pop one in the microwave for 15 seconds they're soft as a doughnut.

My husband loves Conchas!  So I thought I would try and make them myself.  I tried this recipe today and they taste wonderful!  The only thing I will do different next time is in step #4.  I will let the Conchas rise for about 1 1/2 hours before I place the topping.  My topping spread apart really wide in between where I made the cuts, due to the bread rising.

Following the recipe, I could not get the topping the right consistency. I had to spread with a spoon over the tops. I also couldn't get the dough to form balls without having cracks that separated uring rising but this was probably due to my lack of skills with dough. Lol. Very good though.

Good recipe. I took the advice of some reviewers and broke it down into smaller rolls. In total, I had 18 and they were plenty big. It was cool out the day that I tried the recipe, so I used the oven at 100 degrees to keep my dough warm while it raised. The end product was a little denser than I had hoped, but the topping was delicious. In order to shorten cooking time, I plan to try making rolls out of my favorite boxed hot roll mix and using that as the base for the sweet topping.

If u r expecting what u get at the mexican bakery, these are not it. Dough is too heavy, outside crust is slight crunchy. Not airy and light at all. However, they were good in taste...like a cinnamon roll.

You must try this recipe.  The conchas are so delicious.  Not hard at all to make.  It did take me aprox. 3 hrs. from start to finish. After mixing the dough a bit I was scared it was not going to rise.  After 30 min. in my warm oven it didn't looked like it had risen much.  I turned up the heat a little and sure enough it doubled! Yay! I did not divide the topping and I added 1 tsp. vanilla, 1 tsp. cinnamon, and 2 Tbs. cocoa.  I set the oven at 375 as suggested, but after 15 min. of baking they turned very brown.  I did place foil paper on top of the cookie sheets, next time I won't.  They looked beautiful. Soft inside and crunchy outside.  They tasted better than the bakery.  I will make them again with out a doubt. Tasty and so yummy!

These were pretty good!  They are light, soft and just a hint of sweetness. My 2 year old son really liked these, too.  I tried the pan dulce recipe on here and found the dough to be dense, but tasted good.  I may have let the dough work too much in the bread machine.  With this recipe (conchas- mex. sweet bread) I made sure to pull the dough out as soon as it came together in the bread machine and not allow the whole dough cycle to run through.  I halved the recipe and instead of 6 rolls, I made 12 good sized rolls.  They were about the size of a tennis ball. I did follow the recipe and ingredients but added 1 teaspoon vanilla to the dough.  The ones at the bakery seem to have a dryer texture and more course.  I am used to those kind, but these were better!

As a Mexican I love conchas.  They are a tradition.  I have been craving some lately and my husband decided to make some for me.  I'm glad he did.  I loved them not only because he made them for me but because they were very good...  but beware... these are not quite like the real conchas!  (flavorwise) My husband followed the recipe exactly as it is and they turned out beautiful.  The only thing he did differently was leaving the yeast in the warm water for a few minutes as it was suggested by other members... And, oh yeah, he omitted the cinnamon on the topping.  He did have a bit of a problem with the topping but that's when my niece came to the rescue and she did a beautiful concha like toppping.   I really liked the bread.  Not quite a concha but it was really good to satisfy my craving! My husband says he will try making more again adding other flavors to the topping to see if he can get the real concha flavor.

I just got finished making this bread and it was the first time I ever actually tried making a mexican sweet bread myself from scratch. Before now all I had was store bought. All I can say is "OMG", this is the best sweet bread I have ever eaten. I will never go back to store bought again! If you haven't already, you owe it to yourself to try this recipe. It is somewhat time consuming, but oh so worth the effort. If you've ever considered making these, try this recipe. You'll be soooooo glad you did!

The best!  Don't really like conchas from mexican bakery, but love these and so does everyone else!  Time consuming, but worth it.  Have made with and without bread machine, both come out great.  When use bread machine, use to knead bread, then take out and continue with recipe.

I've been looking for a Conchas recipe for a while. I made this last night but was disappointed in the outcome of the bread. It was way too heavy. I was expecting a lighter bread like in the Mexican bakeries. However, the topping came out perfect. My kids loved the bread and disagree with my opinion. Also, next time I will reduce the cinnamon as another rater suggested. I also gave this recipe a low rating because, the topping instructions did not provide information on what to use to make the chocolate topping or other colors.

i made this 4 my language art class. my sister also nagged me to make it. the first time i was so frustrated because i kept screwing up. 
1. i used 65% oil spread margarine for the topping and the results was kind of gooey/gummy. i added about 1/8cp of flour til it was like soft dough/clay or spritz dough.
2. the topping melted a bit because the oven wasn't completely preheated. my fault. 
3. if you don't want to make two different topping, here is a suggestion. make the topping as directed, exept that you add both cinamon and vanilla before adding the flour. i added around 1/8 cp flour or til like soft dough. its just an easier to handle version of the cinnamon topping.
4. i used 1/4cp water and 3/4cp milk since i couldn't find evaporated milk.
5. i baked it at 350-375 F for about 15 mins. i checked the bottom of the bun to see if it was finished. it should be a bit more than golden brown.
*another thing is that you can remake a half of the topping if you screwed up. just half the topping. i also used powdered sugar for the dough and topping cuz i ran out of granulated. there's no difference. not that i noticed. i also made 20 conchas like suggested. i quartered the dough to make it easier for equal size. each quart make five.

Just finished eating one of these while it still warm from the over. Delicious! I did not follow the recipe exactly. I used regular milk instead of evaporated milk and cut the water and made up the difference with more milk. I also skipped the topping, since I thought it might be too sweet. Without the topping the bread is a little bland, but slightly sweet and rich and has the perfect texture. A keeper.

Made just as instructed, and they were delish! However, next time I will let the yeast and water stand for 10 mn, and warm the milk a bit. It took them a while longer to rise enough, Definitely only 14-15 mn in oven, or perhaps lower temp to 350 as they were a bit too browned on bottom. Highly recommend this recipe!

Great recipe. However on the last 2 cups of flour you won't use anywhere near all of it. Only add until the dough is workable without sicking to your hands and no more. I made this mistake. Luckily my wife saved the day by adding more condensed milk and working the dough back to life. The Butter for topping should be room temp or it takes forever to complete. Again you won't need the full cup of flour.

I followed the recipe exactly, and it ended up making conchas more or less similar to those which I frequently eat in Mexico (where I live). The flavor was spot on, but I think they definitely need a bit more time to rise. I actually warmed my oven and had the dough rise in there or it would have taken hours for it to get there. Everyone is mostly happy with these conchas, so I will make them again - I will probably just let the dough rise over night to get it that real airy rise.

Cut the flour by about 1/2 cup. Add 1T flour to vanilla topping. Bring back heat to 350 and only bake for 15 minutes. They turn out great. Taste better than the store bought.

Tasted and looked more like a cinnamon roll than Mexican Sweet Bread. It lacked something that  Mexican Sweet Bread has (that is store bought). A lot of work making and cleanup was a chore. Required a lot of ingredients so i don't know if it was cost effective.

Easy and awesome recipe to make! The frosting is a little hard to cut once it’s on the dough. I’d suggest cutting and then placing it on top of the conchas. Sticks easily tho so you have to work fast. Thank you very much! I also listened to the reviews and put them in the oven for less time. I’m so happy they came out awesome!

A clam shell does NOT have a swirled design.  A conk shell does.  Hence, "concha".  To make it look like a "clam", one might cut possibly only one straight line.  Maybe you should think about what you are writing before you post. Maybe you could visit an aquarium or the beach or even a seafood store so you know what you are writing about.

TERRIBLE!

Didnt rise AT ALL and after 20 min in the oven,  was still a soft, doughy, balled up mess >:( 

The dough didnt rise EITHER time and it was too tough to make into balls; every single seam burst in the oven, resulting in an ugly mess...

I then used the exact same ingredients to make perfect bread, so its def this recipe.

So there.

Wonderful recipe, I made no changes. I recommend either eating these quickly or freezing a portion of them, as they become very dry after a few days.

This recipe is EXCELLENT !!!
My son has food allergies and I have to be careful what ingredients I cook with to make his meals and treats.
I love this recipe since its so easy to make. I do not add the egg, instead I substitute 1/4 cup of Greek yogurt (egg allergy).  
My Conchas bake beautifully and so aromatic, just like the ones you can buy at a Mexican bakery. I will be passing this recipe down to my family.
Thank you Melissa for this wonderful recipe!

Great recipe! I managed to make 27 palm-sized rolls with this recipe. I added some more flour to the vanilla topping paste, but should've added more to counteract the vanilla - the topping "melted" a little bit in the oven.

This is not authentic at all. Recipe is a basic sweet dough used for cinnamon rolls etc. Not near the taste of a real concha. Very disappointed.

These taste just like the semitas that I had in Roatan, Honduras (known as conchas in Mexico).  I thought they were a tad over-done at 375 for 20 minutes, but that's easily corrected.  Thanks for taking me back to the wonderful mornings I had while on vacation.  This recipe is relatively easy, as far as yeast breads go, and well worth the time and effort!

These are a family favorite around here! My husband is part Mexican, and RAVES when I make them. If they're too dense, you're doing it wrong! Done correctly, they are light and airy, with just the right crunch and sweetness. I make 16 out of a batch, just because it's easier to split that way. Pro tip: before the second rise, put a pan of water in the bottom of the oven and heat to 170F. Turn it off, and put your topped conchas in there to rise. Great recipe! Thank you!!!!!!!!!!!

I altered it a little but overall a great recipe. I used 3 tablespoons of yeast and not sure why it said evaporated milk but it was too dense with it so I used regular milk instead. I warmed it up a little also. Also don't forget to let the yeast bloom in the water first, I also added the warm milk to this step. When cutting the dough up, make them on the small side, you won't believe how much they rise. The conchas also look better if you color the sugar topping, get creative with the color and designs!

I  work with a lot of people from Mexico (I am very white American) and they were telling me about these delicious sweet rolls. I had to try them out for myself. They were convinced I had purchased them from a Mexican bakery and was attempting to pass them off as my own. They were very impressed with how authentic they were.

Fab! They were like sweet sugar crusted buns excellent for tea time. Put the sugar mixture after the buns have risen cause otherwise they slide n don't stay in the centre of the buns. I added all ingredients together n made it in the bread machine in no8. Keep them 5 mins longer as the were v slightly underdone in the centre.

1. Followed other review, use bread machine for dough
2. Switch cinnamon powder with coca powder, kids love it, next time will do all with coca pwder. Reduce the topping sugar from 2/3 cup to 1/2 cup.
3. Someone please teach me how to make those perfect ball shape, mine is not half way close to the picture :(.

These were pretty delicious and not difficult to make.  As others have said, this was a fairly dense bread...topping was pretty and easy to cut in a design and pat out .  I had issues with the dough rising (although I actually think I used too much sugar in the dough and this WILL slow down the rising) but after waiting 2 hours after I made them balls and topped them, I decided to go ahead and bake.  They rose in the oven.  Someone mentioned making 20 balls that are smaller instead of 12.  Well, if you do 12 that is a "normal" concha, but since these are pretty dense, smaller would have been big enough for me at one sitting (and I like to eat).  Next time I will make sure to put the right amount of sugar in the dough and will probably increase the amount of yeast I add.  Other than that... very nice...and fun...and pretty!  (not hard to make and look impressive!)

This was a good recipe.  My conchas came out nice and soft.   Sweetness is not too strong but just right.  The only problem I had was with the topping.  It was rather crumbly for me, and hindered the appearance.   It could've been just my fault, though.   
Reminder: don't forget to let your yeast activate in the warm water until foamy!  This is an important step in making sure they rise correctly.
Overall, a very tasty recipe.  Would make again.

Love them. Easy recipe and delicious. I changed the flavor, made cinnamon & butterscotch. They are wonderful. I will make a lot. Much better then buying at the store.

I made these for my cooking club and they were a hit.  Some of the reviewers suggested making smaller rolls which I will do  next time.  Probably to either 20 or 24.  I also added 3 teaspoons of yeast, added 1 teaspoon of vanilla and had the initial rise over night.

I have made these many times but there is a secret to the recipe. I always forget when to let things rest. Add water and yeast let it sit for 2 minutes. Add the ingrediendents and attach hook attachment. Grease another large bowl and let the dough rise for 2 hours.  It's the only way to get the dough to rise completely.  Otherwise these are tasty.

I have tried this recipe several times and all times the dough did not rise.  What am I doing wrong?  I live in Wyoming, high altitude and have adjusted for the altitude and also followed the direction exactly, neither make a difference.

Its okay.  I did end up splitting it up into smaller pieces so that they were more roll size.  I think I just can't get past the fact that its not like a sweet bread I was expecting.  Past the topping there was very little sweet involved.  I'm not looking for a sugary sweet where only 5 year olds who aren't being supervised would eat it, I'm just looking for a little more oomph. I'll just sticking with Babka for now.

Great flavor but not nearly as fluffy as I would hope.  Tried to use warm water and extra yeast and proof for an extra two hours in a warm oven but still stayed sorta gummy.  I will still keep experimenting considering the delicious flavor! The hubby ate 2 immediately and loved them.

This recipe is the best. The only thing I changed was the topping. It came out too hard, so I did a different recipe for the topping. It is very easy to make and compared to other recipes it doesn't take as long to make and cook. I also make mine smaller so it's even faster to cook.

I made these yesterday. I followed the instructions exactly, only adding some extra rise time, about an hour + 20 minutes for the initial rise and an hour for the second. When I make these again (which I definitely will!)I would change the vanilla topping. Either do all cinnamon, or add a tsp or so of extra flour to the vanilla half. The vanilla topping was just a bit too soft and when I baked the rolls, the topping kind of melted off a little and burned on the pan. Also reduce the cooking time to 15 minutes, 20 was slightly too long and bottoms were a little too dark. All in all a great recipe I can't wait to share!

I split them up into 16 portions, but other than that I followed the recipe and they are amazing. They may not look as good this time as they will next, but no one will care about that tonight.

The bread is too dense and the bottom started to brown within 10 minutes. When I took them out, they still hadn't fully baked through. The one thing I did add was food coloring.

Oh my sweet goodness these conchitas are so good!! Being Mexican I was a little skeptic about the outcome but with all the positive reviews and yummy looking pictures I decided to give it a try and I'm so glad I did. They taste like home :) I decided to make the topping with chocolate instead of cinnamon and my family devoured them. The vanilla topping came out a little weird I think it's because it needed a little more flour to thicken up but other than that they're perfect. New Addition to my recipe box.

It's my first time to make a bread,and I'm glad that I made it well..It's really Hard to knead a dough, it takes me more than 30 minutes before the dough becomes elastic and smooth..But in exchange, I had a delicious snack..

Thanks for the recipe :D

So I am pretty good at following recipes, but for the life of me the two times I have tried making these, I get horrible results. I am starting to wonder if its the yeast I am using because I used the same one both times; however, the second time I let it sit a long time to let the foam come up with the yeast/water mixture and the second time was better but definitely can't agree with all the other reviewers giving this recipe rave reviews. Sorry. I am looking for another concha recipe.

These conchas were easier to make than I had expected.  The only change I made was on the cinnamon topping which kept crumbling. So, I added a little vanilla to make them easier to work with. The taste was there and they looked like conchas but they were just too heavy.  Anyone have any suggestions on how to get them a little lighter and more airy? I will try this again.

Good bread used regular milk instead didn't have evaporated don't know how much of a diffrence  the evaporated milk would be for the evaporated milk I think before u put the butter topping on the bread score the bread first then put the topping as the topping when soft is hard to make the clam shell look.

These were fantistic and not really difficult.  Mine didn't raise as much as I had hoped, but that was my fault. I made the dough, but wasn't able to actually BAKE it until almost a week later.  The topping was a little sticky but I divided it up and made little circles as best as I could, then I dipped the top half of the circle in a little flour and when I put it on the bun I was able to pat it down better.  It has been a while since I've had a bakery concha, the topping for these wasn't powdery like I remembered the other being,  this was crunchy and fantastic.  I ate those right away though, Maybe once they sit the topping will soften.

I made the recipe exactly as written and was excited when I took them out of the oven.  They look exactly like the ones from the panaderia but they taste NOTHING like conchas.  They don't taste bad though.  Maybe I did something wrong, since it it was my first time, but I will not try them again.

Awesome recipe! My struggle was waiting for the dough to rise- a warm oven works the greatest for it to rise well especially if you're making these more in the night time. Even the 2nd time making it when I ran out of white flour and had to use wheat flour for the topping everyone loved it. I let the dough rise for more like 3 hours for it to really be fluffy inside so it wouldn't be so dense, and the end result was great!

Great tasting recipe! Will definitely make it again and again. My husband and I loved it! I did have to add a bit of water to the cinnamon topping to be able to roll it into a ball before placing it on top of the ball of dough.

Mine didn't turn out right. The stuff you put on time did though. My bread came out like rocks nearly. I gave it 3 stars becaues I think the recipe is off some what.

I followed the directions exactly but my dough didnt rise. The bread was not light, but they still tasted great. I will make them again and hopefully they'll come out even better.

I love conchas, i grew up eating them with hot coco (or chocolate caliente). I just wished they could have been more fluffy. But great recipe! Thanks! :)

This was a good recipe, my Mexican in laws loved them! I also ran into trouble getting the dough to rise. Next time i am thinking of trying the highly active yeast. It did rise some after I mixed it all together and let it sit to start the topping. But after putting them on the pan to let them sit the additional 45 min, they did nothing. Also, the 20 min. baking time was a little too long for me as the bottom was quite brown and hardened. I plan to make some adjustments to the recipe and see if it works better for me.

I'm rather inexperienced with yeast breads, and these turned out wonderfully anyway! Great recipe.

This was the first time making them and I thought they turned out real good.  Took a lot of time to make them, but well worth it.  I used shortning instead of butter, and added coco powder for one of the toppings.  I will totally make them again.

These were good.  Not quite what I was expecting but good.  They're like a light, fluffy bread with a sweet topping.  I found that topping does get stale quickly so they don't keep for too long.  The men of the family ate them up very quickly, but most of us girls didn't care for them.

I'm giving this 4 stars because I'm sure that I did something wrong -- no one else complained about getting dense little lumps topped with sugar.  On the bright side, I sliced and buttered the lumps and toasted them until brown.  I'm not kidding, they tasted just like bagels.

I couldn't get the dough to rise correctly making these very dense and not like real conchas.  But I actually liked them better this way and my husband devoured them.  The topping is perfect, I have tried many recipes and this one is definately the best.  The only thing I changed was no cinnamon in the topping, I added Mexican vanilla instead.

while they were quite tasty, they took on a more cinnamon-bread like texture. they were very unlike the bread i purchase at the panerias around town. if anyone has a recipe thats closer, let me know.
