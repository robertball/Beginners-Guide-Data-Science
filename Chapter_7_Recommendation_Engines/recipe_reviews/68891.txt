Yea, so this is like the recipe I grew up with, except better.  I haven't found the whole dried peas yet (how big a difference does it make?) but I used some overgrown fresh peas from our garden.  (I haven't tried it without the whole peas, dried or fresh so I can't compare.) Also, I added the savory in the last 15 minutes; I've learned the flavor is much richer that way.

Yummy, yummy, yummy...I ate this every day I was in Quebec City on my honeymoon and this recipe hit the spot, bringing back some great memories. It is still pretty hard to find salt pork here as well as whole dried peas for some odd reason. So, I used bacon instead...not the same, but closer than using ham. I will continue my quest for salt pork for the next time. Thank you Sarah for posting this recipe!
