This would have to be an acquired taste.  No one in our family would eat it.

I liked this recipe but looking at the previous reveiws changed the gravy a bit.  2 Tablespoons Cornstarch and 2 Tablespoons cold water mixed together.  Then 1 Cup meat juices (including onion it was cooked in)and 1 cup plain yogurt instead of whipping cream. I suppose you could use sour cream or half sour cream & half whipping cream. I added salt and pepper to this.  It was good but it's an acquired taste so if you don't like vinegar all that well stay away from this recipe.  I served it with potato pancakes and sweet and sour cabbage.

My family would not eat this, and begged me to never make it again. Also it made the whole house stink, husband had to open all the windows. Maybe if you were raised with this flavor you might like it.

Sour Cream Roast is my FAV!  I initially posted this recipe from my Grandma's recipe. However, as people mentioned, the gravy with this recipe is a bit bland.  I find that if you use 3/4 c. of vinegar initially and use 1 1/2 c. of meat drippings to create the gravy, you'll have a very nice white gravy.

This was great!  My husband had finished his third serving before I finally stopped him.

I agree with Denise, the sauce was a let down and does need something.  Maybe use real sour cream and add some white wine to the gravy when whisking to give it some flavor.  The meat was very tender and I will make it again.

This was okay but the gravy was kind of a let down.  Needs something, garlic maybe, more salt definitely.  The roast was tender, we all liked it.  I'll probably try it again with a few changes.

This recipe was great.  Terrific.  Only down point was the gravy.  Kinda bland; once spiced up, it too was great.  This one will be a regular.

I guess it must be an acquired taste.
