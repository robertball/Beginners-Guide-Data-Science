This was great, loved it. I am not one for washing more dishes than I have to so I boiled the eggs in the pot with the chicken. I served this on wheat bread, with a leafy lettuce as a sandwich. I served the sandwich with a recipe from this website called Tangy Dill Potatoe salad, also excellent. I cheated on the potatoe salad and used dried dill vs fresh and it was good. I hate spending alot on ingredients if I have something I'll use it.It was a nice cool meal for a hot Texas day. Tonight we are going to have some Bahama Mama's, also on this website. Great combination for a hot day. I made the salads in the am, went shopping and about my day came home and dinner was ready to go. Make the salads in the am and by dinner time the flavors are all absorbed. Good stuff!!

this was really good chicken salad. i liked the apples for a change instead of grapes. the only thing i ended up doing different was adding 8oz. cream cheese and I preferred that personally, it helped hold it together better. i will make it again though.

This was just OK for me.  I thought the flavor combinations sounded "interesting."  There's too many flavors competing.  Don't like the addition of the fajita seasoning.  Maybe it would be better without.

My husband and I both enjoyed this very refreshing chicken salad.  While some reviewers weren't impressed with the melody of flavors, we thought it was very good!  I used fat free mayo to reduce the calories/fat and served it over mixed greens for an excellent and filling lunch!

I thought this was awesome!  I made a few adjustments though... I used reduced calorie mayonnaise, left out the cilantro completely and only added about 2 ounces of chopped pecans.  This turned out light and very flavorful. Will definitely make again! Thanks!

Loved this chicken salad - it was delicious!  The ingredients combined for a unique and delightful taste and texture.  I will definitely hang on to this recipe for home cooking as well as events/special occasions.  I served it inside baked potatoes for dinner and my husband and I both loved it!  I also used a rotisserie chicken instead of boiling the chicken breasts; this gave it a nice flavor.  My celery was not fresh so I left that and the fajita seasoning out.  Still wonderful.  Highly recommend this dish!

This was my first time making homemade chicken salad and I am no longer using the canned stuff! This was great, I added Crasians to mine and ditched the pineapples because I don't care for them, overall I loved this chicken salad, I put it on Croissants!

I love this recipe except for the cilantro. I think it tastes like soap, so if you have never tried cilantro, you should taste before putting in the chicken salad. I just tasted the finished product and wanted to cry because all my  hard work is wasted. Next time no Cilantro.

This recipe is excellent! All of the different flavors together make a wonderful tasting chicken salad. I didn't have to add or omit anything, I just made it exactly as is and I will definately be making this again!

I love chicken salads and this one is a top fav! I like to add in red grapes, they add a little something. I also omit about 1/2 of what is called for on the pineapple.

I thought this recipe was very good! It was my first time making Chicken Salad and normally I am not that big of a fan of it when I taste it but I can now say this has been added to my recipe books. I loved it and will definitely make it more! The flavors were great, it's a sweeter chicken salad with the pineapples and apples but its perfect for me and why I now can finally say I like Chicken Salad.

Delicious!  I was surprised at how well all the ingrediets blended together.  I used crushed pineapple which added a great sweetness to the whole dish.  I was weary of so much cilantro but it went so well with everything else!  Everyone I have served this to has loved it - even my 18mo old son!

I normally love all kinds of chicken salad, but this recipe didn't really do it for me. The flavors just didn't blend well together. I think I would stick with a more traditional recipe over this one.

My husband loved it! I did too! I halved the recipe for the two of us and it made a ton!  Stuck some uncooked mushroom stems (sliced) in the second day and that was good too.

Substitute Rotisserie Seasoning for the Fajita Seasoning and omit cilantro.  Just my preference.

This is really an "everything-but-the-kitchen-sink" kind of chicken salad, lol.  Tastes pretty good, but definitely 'busy' in flavor.  Didn't have cilantro, so left out.
