These were really tasty! I couldn't find baking toffee or anything like that so I smashed up a whole bunch of HEATH bars and used that. They came out really good - I liked how the chocolate from the HEATH bars added great flavor. I'd definitely make these again and I won't even try to find toffee - I'll just use HEATH bars again! Oh - and I'll double the recipe next time - the original recipe only made around 14 cookies.

These were very tasty cookies...very buttery and rich tasting without being heavy. Crisp in texture...definitely not a soft or chewy cookie. (Although when still very warm out of oven they are a little chewy.) 2 cups of toffee bits seemed really high for the amount of cookie batter it made so I decreased to only 1 cup - and it was PLENTY! Every bite had toffee & pecan pieces. I also upped the pecans to 1/2 cup. Make sure you press down on the cookie dough after you put on cookie sheet or you end up with tall round cookies...I flattened a little bit with my fingers and the rest came out perfectly shaped. Very good recipe!

Those who like their cookies very buttery and on the flatter side will go crazy over these. But I wasn't all that moved...because they're very buttery and on the flatter side! (And I did chill the dough) I thought the amount of salt unnecessarily high so I reduced it by half. I also thought the amount of toffee chips was a little much so I subbed half of it with milk chocolate chips and loved that switch. I took the extra step of toasting the pecans which nearly always makes for a better tasting cookie in my book. Great flavor with all that's going on in this cookie crisp on the edges soft but chewy on the inside. But because they're kind of thin they're not the prettiest cookie either but again that may just be a matter of opinion.

UH LA LA!! How great! I took the suggestions of several reviewers & added 1/2 (milk) chocolate chips & 1/2 toffee bits. Though it doesn't make many cookies it's perfect for a family of two or three. This recipe is a certain keeper!

These cookies came out AMAZING! I didn't use all the toffee chips it called for I got a bag of Heath chips and just used that. They were good without being too sweet and stayed soft and delicious after 2 days. One of my new favorite recipes!

I used crushed toffee candy instead of the bits. They turned out pretty good but next time I make them I'll use the toffee bits and see if that makes a difference in how they taste.

These cookies are simply wonderful. My roommate suggested frosting them. I made a thin creme cheese frosting and spread it ontop. Simply out of this world. This is a new family favorite. Thank you Andy

a great base recipe. I made it twice the first time with half choc chips and half toffee and extra cocoa. The second time just with choc chips and mint flavor. They were SO good!

A friend shared this recipe with me about about two years ago. It's always a hit w/ family and friends. I do use a bag of the Heath toffee bits which is about 1 1/2 cups and it seems to be the right amt. for the recipe. Also I roll these into smaller sized cookies and that stretches out the recipe quite a bit so there's more to go around. In my oven I cook them for about 12 mins then check it for about another 1-2 mins.

I made this cookie since it reminded me of my grandmother s cookies. I only made one change. Since I was able to find the toffee bits for the cookies but it was only 1-1/3 C worth I used butterscotch chips for to top it off. Let me tell you it was so delish. I brought them into work and they only lasted 30 min. Not a pretty cookie but who cares if it tastes that good!

I didn't have any pecans so I used sliced almonds. The dough that didn't get eaten & actually made it into the oven came out great. Definitely the best cookies I've ever made in my life.

Excellent cookies. I had some left over toffee that I had made the week prior and used that had no pecans so used chopped walnuts and added about 1/2 cup of candied ginger chopped up small. So delicious! Makes for great "special" cookies if you know what I mean.

Yummy cookies! 2 things: How did the first reviewer only end up with 14 cookies? Unless they were giant cookies? I had enough for 2 batches. (I also make my cookies small). Other thing is I used Heath bits and omitted the pecans.. baked for 12 minutes because I prefer softer cookies and they're still pretty chewy.. Not flat either. Overall I think these are amazing!

Flat bland unexciting. Made these for coworkers and they came out so terrible I was too embarrassed to bring them. I'm no chef but I havent had a cookie recipe flop like this in years. I would MUCH rather just eat a heath bar. A tip if you do make them: 12 minutes gave me a batch of black cookies 10 minutes and they were still too overdone. 8-9 minutes is what "worked" for me.

Fantastic! The cookies didn't spread horribly were soft yet crisp and the toffee bits gave them a little extra sweetness without overpowering anything. I will be making these again and again. Made 24 2" cookies.

These are so amazingly good that I cannot keep from eating them! I'm not always a cookie fan so this is big for me. We actually used homemade toffee that we couldn't get out of the pan and was broken up so much so we decided to make cookies out of them. These are so buttery and the toffee melted some into them and the toffee chunks make these so yummy! Thanks for the delicious recipe!!

These were great! Did not use the toffee bits substituted crushed up butterfingers instead (only used 1 cup not 2)and these turned out great. I made them a pretty good size and got about 28 cookies.

YUM. Just baked these with a full 8 oz bag of Heath Toffee Crunch; baked the cookies at 360 instead of 350 and it took a bit longer but was worth every bite (higher temp caramelizes the brown sugar). Delicious thanks so much for a great recipe!

These cookies were SO simple and so tasty and balanced. I had only 4 packages of Quaker instant oatmeal and just sifted out the powder as much as I could and the texture was fantastic. Chewy and little crispy at the same time. I'm going to try this recipe again only with flavored oatmeal and sub the toffee with dried fruit. Yum!

I followed the recipe for these and they came out PERFECTLY. They weren't flat at all. Instead of using a spoon I made them by hand and sort of shaped them into half-dollar sized pats of cookie dough. They were delicious and I'll definitely be making them again.

The cookies spread a lot. The modifications I made to the recipe were as follows: replace 50% of the flour with whole wheat flour. Reduce the toffee bits to 1 cup. I added some chopped dark chocolate. The cookies were really good when paired with a cup of coffee. I toasted the pecans before mixing it into the batter. I also added a small amount of toasted coconut. Nice and crispy cookie.

These were really not good. 2 cups of toffee is way too much for the amount of cookie dough this recipe yields 3/4cup would be much better. Toffee aside the cookies aren t even good. I ended up putting the cookies from the first tray in the freezer in case there s a cookie emergency & throwing the rest of the cookie dough in the garbage. You re better off making standard Nestle chocolate chip cookies and substituting the chips for toffee 1:1. Huge waste of time and ingredients.

I tried this recipe as is and thought the flavor and texture of the cookies were great! I can't wait to try it with broken up Heath Bars instead of toffee bits. I think a little bit of chocolate will be a nice addition to the cookies.

Very good cookie. Based on other reviews I doubled the recipe (but not the salt or toffee chips) and added a half bag of mini semisweet chocolate chips since that's what I had on hand. Milk chocolate definitely would've been better. I used wet hands to press the cookies flat before baking. This resulted in a nice round flat cookie (I don't like puffy cookies). Although hard to resist fresh from the oven they are much better after they've cooled to room temp. The flavors need time to "set." Will make again.

Wow...these were shockingly good.  Fluffy, chewy, and sticky all at once. They're sweet, nutty, and slightly salty.

I used 1.5 cups of toffee bits rather than the full 2 cups. Refrigerated the dough for 2 hours and baked on greased foil. I tried one batch at 12 minutes and a second batch at 14 minutes. It was hard to tell the difference between the two batches.

These ARE delicious! Buttery perfectly crispy without being hard with a sweet & salty vibe. My 10 year old daughter wanted to make cookies and this was the recipe she chose by default--we had all the ingredients in the pantry. Use the Heath baking bits if you can find them. This is a cookie to share!

Really good cookie.. I usually replace 1/4 of the sugar with white sugar to help make slightly crispy edges..also used only about half of the toffee bits and that was plenty for me. Good recipe.

Excellent cookies! Really hit the spot... I added some flaked coconut and it was amazing. I used crushed chocolate covered toffee bits instead of just plain toffee bits (the Heath Bar bits) and they were sooo good.
