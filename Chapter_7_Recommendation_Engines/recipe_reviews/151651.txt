I saw this recipe and figured I'd give it a shot. Figuring some had mentioned that it was a bit bland I thought I'd spice it up a bit and make some substitutions. I substituted the cream of mushroom for cream of chicken. While preparing the chicken I had the potatoes cut into wedges sitting in a bowl of salt water. I cleaned the chicken halfs and took off the skin. I seasoned the chicken pieces with garlic powder and Adobo. Instead of paprika I sprinkled Goya - Sazon (con cilantro) seasoning on the potatoes and chicken. I also added broccolli to the dish. Halfway through cooking I took the dish out and mixed everything around a bit, making sure that there was sauce covering all the vegetables. Then when done, I removed the chicken pieces, tossed the vegetables around again, replaced the chicken pieces bone side up this time and let it cook for another 10 mins. These substitutions made it taste great and was delicious. I made some garlic bread to eat with this and everyone raved about it.

I made a few modifications, and this recipe turned out fabulous! I used a whole cut up chicken, trimmed the excess fat and skin, and brushed the meat with a little olive with a crushed clove of garlic in it. I added 4 medium sized potatoes and 4 carrots cut into 1 or 1/2 inch chunks, and poured an 18 oz. can of Progresso Creamy Mushroom soup (sorry Campbell's!)over the top. Then I sprinkled liberally with salt & pepper, herbs de Provence and smoked paprika for color, and baked it for a little over an hour. The chicken was moist, the vegetables were tender, and the gravy was delicious!

This was a very good easy dinner.  I had everything in the house.  I did modify it just a bit.  I added diced onion and sliced fresh mushrooms.  To the soup, I added 1 TBS of dijon mustard and 1 TBS of whorchestershire sauce.  I seasoned the chicken with seasoned salt, pepper, italian season(since I didn't have oregano) and garlic powder.  I was worried that the chix and vegie would not cook in 50 mins, so I cooked it about 1 hour 20mins and the chicken was over cooked and the vegies were perfect.  I will probably try it with those frozen chix breast next time and cook them from frozen for the 1hr 20mins or 1hr 30mins and I am sure it will be prefect.  I never like these soup things but we really liked it alot. I loved how easy it was!!!

My husband and I both liked it, and it was sooo easy!  I didn't change a thing besides the time to bake it.  50 minutes just didn't seem like enough time. the chicken didn't get cooked all the way thru and the potatoes weren't done either.  But we'll definately be making it again, just allowing for more baking time!

This was very good! My fiance and I both really enjoyed it. I cooked it a little longer than it said and the carrots were still not cooked, but the potatoes were. I think next time I will cut the baby carrots in half, and it will be fine. I wasn't completely sure if this was supposed to be covered or not, if it was the veggies would cook quicker, but you wouldnt get the crispy outside of the chicken. I may try covering it for part of the time.

I substituted Bonless Chicken Breast for the Bone in Chicken and An Italian Dressing Packet for the Seasonings. I drizzled Sesame Oil over the Chicken  and then covered that in the Dry Dressing and Extra Garlic Salt. Also added onions to the veggies. It turned out VERY yummy this way.

Very good and very easy.  I cut the potatoes smaller than suggested, as I saw other reviewers have commented that they came out under cooked - most of them turned out perfect, with just a few a bit under done.

This is a GREAT recipe!!  It was SOO easy to make too.  We will definitely be making this dish again.  

The chicken was so moist and flavorful.  We didn't much care for the potatoes though.  Next time we make omit or attempt mashed potatoes out of them.  

Great recipe! Thanks

I substituted boneless chicken breast for the chicken, and otherwise followed the recipe as written.  Next time I would add more spices as it was a little bland.  Both my husband and i enjoyed it!

We thought this was a wonderful recipe. I brought the carrots and potatoes to a boil, and then simmered them for 10 minutes. I used chicken broth to boil them in, and then added that to the soup instead of 1/3 cup of water. I also used cream of chicken soup, and added about 1/2 cup of sour cream. The sour cream does something special! Spiced it up a little, as other reviewers suggested, added mushrooms and onion and baked it all for 60 minutes. Turned out perfect.

This was awesome!  We were looking for something quick and easy and this was perfect.  I didn't read any of the reviews beforehand, but did make a few minor changes on my own.  I used a bag of mixed veggies (broccoli, cauliflower, carrots), cut the potatoes into small chunks and added rosemary.  Had I been less lazy, I would have thrown in some onion.  Overall, this is perfect for a lazy night!

I did not care for the oregano in this recipe.  I think the tarragon would have been a better choice.  I fried up some onion and mushrooms and added them along with some garlic powder as well.  Cooked one hour and used boneless chicken breast and thighs and chicken was perfect.  I will try this again with about 1 tsp of tarragon instead of the oregano

What a great wholesome dinner!  I added a couple things:  I sauteed about 3 tablespoons of chopped onion and 2 cloves of garlic in butter, then rubbed this on the chicken with olive oil.  I also added garlic powder and salt to the gravy.  I read a few reviews about it being too bland, so I thought we would add a little.  It turned out WONDERFUL.  My husband LOVED it.....we will definitely be making this again!

Super fast and easy recipe to make with what you have in the kitchen! I had 2 bone in chicken breasts and 4 drumsticks and made them with the big family size can of cream of mushroom soup (28 oz. I think) added some salt, pepper, garlic powder, and tarragon to the sauce plus the oregano and paprika called for, and omitted the veggies all together, (because we just had potatoes last night and my daughters like plain  vegetables better) I boiled up some egg noodles instead, and used the sauce like a stroganoff over the noodles. YUM!  My picky daughters gobbled it up, and the chicken cooked just fine in 50 minutes this way too.

After TWO hours in the oven, the potatoes were finally soft enough to eat.  I made several changes to the recipe,  after reading the other reviews. I used 1/2 c. water with chicken bouillion,  added a couple stalks of chopped celery,  onion powder, 
garlic powder and omitted the recommended herbs.  I sprinkled all with freshly ground pepper and sea salt,  and sprinkled a bit of paprika on top of the chicken.  I checked the vegetables at 1/2 hour...hard as a rock. After 1 hour, it was just starting to heat up. At 1 1/2 hours,  I knew the end was in sight,  and after two hours,  dinner was served.  Unfortunately, I had an engagement.  Husband loved it,  even though he ate by himself.

Very good and easy recipe! I added olive oil over the chicken before putting it in the oven, after reading some reviews, but I also added celery, and garlic powder. I cooked it for 50 minutes and the chicken came out so tender.

wonderful recipe! I didn't have cream of mushroom soup on hand so I used cream of chicken instead. My family loved it. Nice and crisp outside yet moist inside. Will make again.

I give this recipe 4 stars with my modifications. I thought it needed garlic salt/powder and a little pepper. I also added a dash of tarragon. The chicken came out moist and delicious and it was easy to prep! Give it a try!

Did not care for this recipe.  It was very boring and had no flavor.  50 minutes didn't seem long enough, the chicken and vegetables were not done.

I made several alterations and additions to this recipe in order to give it more flavor. As-is the recipe is quite bland. I seasoned everything with salt, pepper, adobo, paprika, and oregano. I also added onions.  A few changes made a whole lot of difference!

very good.....I cut the veggies into smaller pieces to help them cook faster, but otherwise followed the instructions exactly. Next time I will add another cream soup to make more gravy.

Great recipe even my picky 4 year old would eat.  I modified by using frozen greenbeans instead of carrots.  I sauted onion and garlic and added it to potatoes and greenbeans.  Cooked chicken from frozen for 1hr 20 minutes as another review suggested.  Definitely a recipe I will use again.

This was delicious.  I used the cream of chicken soup, covered it the first 45 minutes then baked another 15 uncoverd.  If you find it bland it's easy to add some fresh ground pepper.  Good home cooking!

Loved this, feeding a family of 6, I followed other reviews and cut the potatoes and let them soak in salt water first, and I skinned the chicken. I also seasoned the chicken with garlic powder along with the oregano and paprika.  This was so easy, very hearty and filling.  I would definitely recommend it!

I made it exactly as the recipe calls for.  It was a little too much oregano for our taste and the sauce was a little thick. I will try it again but I will add some fresh garlic, salt, pepper & possibly  Italian seasoning instead of the Oregano.  I cut the veggies pretty small so everything was done in an hour. I will also add a little chicken broth or a little more water to the soup so the sauce isn't so thick.

This was a quick and easy recipe.. however the potatoes were a little bland.. the carrots were delicious along with the chicken.. it needs something added to it.. just haven't figured out what yet!
