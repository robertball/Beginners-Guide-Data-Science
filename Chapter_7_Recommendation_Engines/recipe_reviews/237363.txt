Came across this recipe by accident and I'm glad I did. It's not even fully cooled and everyone's digging in! Store-bought granola is so expensive and (let's face it) ingredient lists are LONG. I substituted a cup of some healthy cereal that my kids wouldn't eat for a cup of the oatmeal, added peanuts rather than cashews (what I had). Great versatile recipe. Thanks for sharing with us!
