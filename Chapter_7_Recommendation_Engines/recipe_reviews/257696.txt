I cooked some medium size shrimp separately then chilled them. Combined it all right before serving. Was delicious !

This was great! I used ground turkey breast in place of the pork. I saut√©ed the turkey with some of the dressing. I also used vermicelli in place of the rice noodles. It held up as leftovers the next day. I also used fresh mint vs. dried. Excellent!

This recipe was awesome! My store did not have snow peas so I used snap peas instead. Other than that I made as written. This recipe is full of flavor. If you like things spicy, garnish with crushed chile flakes or Sriracha. Definitely a keeper!
