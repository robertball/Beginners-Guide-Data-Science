This was really good. It will be thicker and set up better if you cut the milk back to 1 3/4 cups. My boys love it frozen.

This recipe does not work as a pie it never set up. It may work well as a mouse but I won't try it again. My six year old didn't like it at all. It was a big mess!

It was wonderful. But I made a mistake I bought devils food instant pudding. I know that just the regular chocolate would have been better. Also instead of using whipped cream for a topping. I crushed up some Reeses peanut butter cups and sprinkled on top. It was great!

I made this for a church dinner a week ago. I heard how it had not set up well so I froze it before serving. THAT was the ticket!

The pie tasted great but served horrible. This pie needs to set atleast overnight before being served.

There is an error in this recipe. I made it exactly as directed here. It was OK but not chocolate-y enough for my taste. Then I discovered the basic recipe is on the chocolate pudding package. It calls for TWO 3.9 oz packages of pudding mix not one. And you only fold in HALF of the Cool Whip. The rest goes on top with half of the candy. This might also explain why some had the problem of it not setting up. Mine is in the freezer as we speak so I'm hoping for the best. It certainly is easy though!

I cut the milk back by a half cup and instead of a graham crust I used a homemade oreo cookie crust. Instead of chilling the pie in the fridge I took another reviewer's suggestion and froze the pie. My husband and boys raved about this pie. They must have liked it--it was gone in two days.

This was actually pretty good tasting. It doesn't get as firm add Iwould like it therefore it is actually quite messy to serve. But maybe I can find a different way to serve this next time.
