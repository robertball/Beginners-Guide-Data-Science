Deeeeelicious.  My neighbor gave us fresh figs off his tree and I searched All Recipes to find a recipe to use them.  I struck gold with this!! I read all the reviews and decided to try 2 versions. 1 with just goat cheese, the other with a combo goat/ricotta.  Stick with just goat! The best. Also I REALLY struggled with cooking the bacon all the way through without demolishing the figs in the cooking process. So I tried pre-cooking the bacon in the micro first, but when wrapped around the figs and broiled the bacon ended up burning. The best solution was to just make a little pile of proscuitto on top of the figs!! No wrapping, no toothpicks, lower fat and not greasy, but very similar taste!  I can't wait until next year's fig crop is ripe... and neither can my neighbor!  He loved 'em as much as we did!!

this is a unique appetizer and everyone loved it.  I accidently got dates instead but they were very good.  I 'd make it again because it tastes different - sweet and salty at the same time.

My sister-in-law said that they were the most exquiste thing that has ever touched her lips. Excellent recipe. I prepared them the night before and zapped them under the broiler right when the family came. So easy, so good.

Great appetizer. I changed it a bit, I excluded the pecans (just because they were not on hand) and used prosciutto instead of bacon. The prosciutto is already cured so you don't have to worry about it cooking through and it crisps up quickly. I broilled them for 5 minutes and then flipped them and broilled for another 3-4 minutes. Thanks for the recipe, it was a hit at the party I went to.

Excellent.  I'd make this again.  It's quick, easy, and a nice change of pace from the regular appetizers.  Best of all, it's delicious!

I had to use dried figs, since I could not find fresh ones in my area.  These are very rich and delicious.

It taste really good but not very pretty. Maybe if I precook the bacon some it would turn out better. I had to cook it for forever it seemed before the bacon was cooked. I even had to turn them over which caused the cheese to leak out even more. Half of the cheese came out because I had to broil it for so long. Thanks for the recipe though. It overall did taste great.

Excellent - I have smaller figs on my tree so I used a 1/4 piece of bacon per half fig and laid it on top of the fig instead of wrapping it.  I also cooked the bacon slightly in frying pan ahead of time to reduce the broiler time and take some of the bacon grease out.

This recipe is great with dried dates.  I made it last Spring before figs were in season. But last week I tried it with figs and it was a disappointment.  In fact we each ate one and threw the rest out.  So great concept but dates work so much better.

These were wonderful.  I followed the recipe exactly, using another reviewers suggestion and lightly frying bacon.  The only change I made was to top with a little fresh cracked black pepper before broiling.  I served these with a nice bottle of Tempranillo.

RARE AND FABULOUS FRESH FIG RECIPE. I bought fully cooked bacon, it's very thin and pliable. Also, crumbled goat cheese instead of the wet variety. I stuck to the directions, but ran out of bacon, so I pushed bacon bits into the top of a few. I had to be careful not to split my figs when pushing in the cheese, nuts, AND bacon bits, so wrapping is much better if you're able. I also cut the tips off the figs before slicing in half. You can see the picture of mine, it's the one with the toothpick still in it. I HIGHLY suggest using thin cooked bacon with this recipe, otherwise bacon bits can work, too.

This was heavenly! It convinced my husband that figs aren't so bad after all. I took a reviewer's advice and precooked the bacon in the microwave so that it would broil faster and the cheese wouldn't bubble out. I didn't cook it all the way, just 2 minutes, but next time I'll cook it longer. The bacon didn't want to brown up nicely under the broiler, and I lost some cheese. But still, it was delicious and I'll be making it again whenever I want to impress guests.

I have to say, for how excited I was to make these, they were one of the more disappointing things I've ever tried.  For one thing, they took nearly 20 minutes and still came out half burnt and half rubber, even rotating the pan AND the figs.  Apparently if you use half decent bacon this recipe doesn't work?  There was no clear definition of flavors; you couldn't taste anything, it was just muddy.  I have made a similar app using sliced grilled brats in place of the bacon, finishing the whole thing on the grill, and it comes out fantastic.  I will definitely be going back to that recipe.

Am I the only one who noticed that the numbers don't add up on this recipe?  

6 figs, halved = 12 fig halves 
3 slices of bacon, cut in half = 6 pieces of bacon

So - which one is correct?  Should I cut the figs to 3 or increase the bacon to 6 slices?

Very rich and yummy.  However, I cut the bacon in thirds rather than half the slices.  I don't if my figs are just smaller than most or what.  But next time I may try using a whole fig since the taste of the fig and cheese got a bit lost.  Still a great appetizer!

I wasn't sure if I would like this but my neighbour gave me some figs from her tree so I came and looked for a recipe here.  This one sounded good so I gave it a try and we LOVED THEM!  The changes I made were as follows - my figs were VERY ripe, and I think that really helped with the sweet flavor.  I used goat cheese as in the recipe, but I used proscutto instead of bacon.  It was cut very thin and I wrapped one piece one way and then another piece the opposite way making a little bundle.  It didn't take very long to broil this way as there was no bacon to cook.  I also should have toasted my pecans a bit more as they got a little soft in the recipe, but still delicious. Two thumbs up from my whole family!

These were really good.  I used pecan halves instead of chopping them.  I did have to bake them on 450 for more like 15 minutes in order to fully cook the bacon.  I think next time I will use less bacon or thinner slices, or give the prosciutto a try.

I was really disappointed with this recipe.  It was just bland, I even  added balsamic vinegar trying to get some flavor.  Maybe the figs just weren't sweet enough..

With a bumper crop of figs and a need for only so many jars of jam, this recipe was perfect!  Not only was it delicious but so easy to make.  I made a huge plate to bring to a casual cocktail party and they were devoured.  The goat cheese and bacon played off nicely with the sweetness of the figs and the pecans gave it a really nice crunch.

* An extra star. I made this for my parents and my boyfriend; they LOVED it! I did make a couple of chages: first I used Turkey Bacon, and I cooked it for about 1-2 minutes on each side(Just enough to begin to see it cook). I alos used Gorgonzola Cheese because it was cheaper. My parents took some to work and there Co-workers were blown away at how good they are.

yuuuuuuuuum.....left out pecans cause didn't have - used garlic/herb goat chs, used pitted dates because couldn't find figs at the store - cooked bacon a little bit, only until just starting to brown and still very plyable - through under high broiler for 5 min and turned out great.  Will definitely be making again as my staple party appetizer.

Amazing! I used dried figs and omitted the pecans since I didn't have any one hand.  Also, based on some of the other reviews, I fried the bacon for a few minutes first before wrapping.  Turned out fantastic and elegant!

These were the favourite appetizer I made this Chirstmas (and I made over 10 items).  Great blend of tastes, crunchy, gooey... delicious.  Great warm, good cold.

Excellent. We used Trader Joe's frozen figs and skipped the pecans. Really good flavors. We served as a main with roasted vegetables as a Monday night supper.

Very disappointing! My bacon got burned, though maybe I should have pre-cooked it longer like 3-4 minutes instead of just 2.

I know that you aren't supposed to rate recipes you change, but the change I made was so good that I wanted to share it with others! I picked this recipe because I had all the ingredients on hand. I stuffed the cheese and nuts into the figs, then went to the fridge and got out the bacon to wrap them. To my horror, the bacon was moldy. I felt like I needed something for more flavor, so I grabbed a jar of cherry balsamic vinegar (I really like cherry balsamic vinegar dressing on salads with sweeter ingredients so I keep it in the house) and drizzled some on each fig. Oh my gosh! So amazingly good!

So easy and everyone loved it. I used fresh black mission figs and precooked bacon. I hear the host of the party I attended ate the leftovers for breakfast the next day:-)

This is very lovely - we had it as a dessert. I used prosciutto instead of bacon, omitted the nuts and drizzled with a balsamic reduction.

These are excellent - you can experiment with other cheeses as well.  We had these at the Cheesecake Factory (one of their new small plate appetizers) and fell in LOVE so I had to find a recipe.   They make theirs with parmesan but I think the goat cheese is even better for more contrast.

I made this according to the recipe, and served as an appetizer at my parents' xmas eve gathering. It was well loved, esp by the low-carb audience. My young niece still asks me to make it whenever I see her.

These were delicious!! I made only two small changes: as others suggested, I precooked the bacon a bit, and, because I didn't have any pecans, I substituted chopped cashews. Yum!

could not wait for this..but I was soooo disappointed.  Maybe the figs were not good...I also made the mistake of using a maple bacon which omitted the saltiness of it.  Also took longer than 5 minutes under the broiler.

Great in theory.  I think my issue is my figs are really young and not that sweet. But they held up well. Got the bacon crisp by turning them over for an addition minute broiling . but great recipe, because I needed to do something with these figs. thanks

Made this on a camping trip with some fellow campers who wrinkled their nose at the idea.  But, once they had a bite, all they could talk about is how they wish I had made more.  I pre-cooked the bacon so it was still limp and I could wrap it around the stuffed fig.  I didn't have goat cheese so I used cream cheese mixed with some sugar.  Then I cooked them on the griddle.  Crispy bacon wrapped ooey gooey goodness!

YUMMY!  I used Prosciutto instead of bacon and Chèvre goat cheese.  Soften the cheese and add the toasted pecans, roll into gum ball sized balls.  Assemble according to recipe.

I broiled  mine in my Breville toaster oven at 400 for 5 minutes.  They turned out great, super easy to make ahead and broil later.

I made it with dried figs (both California Golden and Black Mission) sliced in half, goat cheese and pecan halves.  I want to direct my comment to baking time. Several people comment that it took much longer than 5 minutes.  Maybe that is because the bacon was thick, the oven was not hot enough or they were too far from the flame.
I did a test run in my toaster oven and that did take longer, but on the top shelf of my regular oven they would have burnt had I not rotated them often.  I made 24.  I rotated after 1.5 min, then 45 sec twice and then 30 sec two more times and they came out chrisp.  The other issue I had was with the grease buildup in the baking sheet. I had to drain it twice and plan on using a broiling pan next time. The goat cheese got overpowered, maybe because you can't get much between dried figs, so I plan on using a stronger  flavored cheese next time.  They are delicious and were gobbled up quickly. Thanks for the recipe.

Partial to this recipe since I love figs.. but I changed every other ingredient not on purpose, just out of convenience.  I used brown figs, gorgonzola, slivered almonds, and prosciutto (didn't need toothpicks since prosciutto is so thin).. I thought the bacon might make it too fatty and greasy. Based on other reviews, the bacon wouldn't turn out as well anyway.  They were gone within 5 minutes of putting them out.  Next time I will try the pecans though since the almonds didn't really add much taste.

We have fresh figs and was looking for a recipe for appetizers and tried this with the revision  Jane had mentioned and we all just loved them.  I used the prosciutto cut up on top instead of wrapping the figs in bacon since we are health conscious and they were GREATTTTTTT!  Even the next day yummy!  I had chopped the pecans small and added them to the goat cheese.  I bought the goat cheese with garlic and herbs, oh so awesome!!!  I also heated the over to 350 and just cooked them for about 8 minutes.  Perfect!!  Will definitely add this recipe to my must make when our figs are in season!!!

This was pretty good.  I used dates- will try figs next time.  I think I was expecting something a little more savory.

This was just o.k.  I absolutely love goat cheese and had higher expectations.  They just weren't that special.  I did substitute proscuitto for the bacon as many others suggested.

I made these this summer for a group of guests who raved about them.  They were simple to make, it only took a couple of minutes to assemble a dozen or so. Then I popped them under the broiler for a few minutes and they were done!  Very easy, very good.

I used dates instead of figs to make these and served them at a recent party.  My friends are still talking about them!  I'm not sure if it was just my oven, but I did have to broil them for 10-15 minutes to get the bacon nice and crispy.

I didn't like this as much as the other fig recipe I tried tonight. Too much salt.
