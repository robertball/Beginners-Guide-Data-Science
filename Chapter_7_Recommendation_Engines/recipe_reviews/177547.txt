These are so good and so easy to make!  I didn't have the seasoned chicken broth so just added some minced garlic from a jar.

They were very good...not at all bland as another review said. I usually put butter on my potatoes and didn't on these.  I used a clove of garlic which I minced and cooked up in the pan a bit before adding the chicken broth.  I also added some italian seasoning.

Extremely tender, extremely easy. However, unexciting. This showed me that cooking potatoes in broth is only a slightly-noticeable upgrade from salted water. This is how to make potatoes when you're going to have a flavorful meat on the plate with tons of sauce or gravy that will also go over the potatoes. I did just that, and made these potatoes to go with with "Cousin Cosmo's Greek Chicken". The combination was wonderful. Thanks for posting.

Very simple to make and had good taste. I added garlic and Italian seasoning as suggested by another reviewer.
