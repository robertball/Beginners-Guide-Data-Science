Had a couple of gliches with the recipe. In the ingredient list it didn't include baking powder but when putting it together it said to add baking powder. I added about 1 tsp. just in case. Also at the top of the recipe it said Cook Time: approx. 1 hour. At the end of the recipe it said 25 minutes baking time. The 25 minutes was the correct time!

This is the recipie I have been searching for  for a LONG time.  My mom got it from my Gramma who got it from her mom and it was made during the depression when sugar, flour and such was cheap, thus the name "Poor Man's Cake".  The recipie was lost and now I have rediscovered it again, except I will make it in a tube pan as my mom and Gramma always made it... Barbara L in NJ

I was having company over last night and I realized yesterday afternoon that one of my guests would not be able to eat the cheesecake I made for dessert since she is allergic to cow dairy products. I jumped on here in a panic and found this recipe. I halved it and used an 8x8 baking dish and baked it for 20 minutes at 350. My oven runs hot though so other ovens may need more time. I also added a 1/2 t of vanilla and a 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts. If you decide to do the same keep in mind that I was halving the recipe. I threw in 1 t of baking powder since there seems to be some confusion as to whether it's needed or not. It turned out great! It's more of a spice bread than a cake and the leftovers go great with a cup of coffee in the morning.:)

My husband's grandmother made a cake he loved called "yum-yum" cake. Unfortunately no one in the family had the recipe so when Grandma passed away - about 15 years ago - the recipe was lost. I tried for years to recreate the taste without success. But now I can! Since we are cutting back on desserts I do find this rather sweet so I will experiment with that. Grandma also added ginger brandy to the recipe (at least she said she that was why she wanted it) and chopped walnuts. Thanks for this recipe!

This recipe is great! Every morning when I get up large portions of the cake are missing because of my husband the night before.

It was okay nothing special. It might have tasted better if I had not overcooked it.

This is a tasty coffee cake or a bite of something sweet when you have no butter eggs or milk. The texture is more like a sponge cake and the raisins give it a deep color. The spices really make the house smell nice while it is baking. Garnish with a bit of whipped cream or a dusting of powdered sugar to dress it up a little if you like. I used Dendandee's recommendation and added 1 tsp. baking powder.
