I made a few changes to this recipe, and it turned out amazing!  First I browned the ground beef with half an onion (large).  I also used 2 cloves of garlic and 1 tsp cajun spice, and salt and pepper to taste.  I also added about 3/4 cup grated sharpe Cheddar cheese and sour cream as topping and 2 diced green onions.  Amazing!

I used whole grain shells, so I needed to add extra broth & cook longer.  Other than that, tasty & easy.  Just wished they made a reduced fat cheddar cheese soup!

I should have used the whole 32 oz of broth because the liquid boiled off before the shells were cooked.

i subbed ground turkey for the beef, but otherwise followed this recipe as written.  i thought it was ok, pretty average for a campbells soup recipe.  the kids threw a fit because there were chunks.  if there's a next time, i will sub taco sauce for the salsa to eliminate the chunk issue :)

My family is lactose intolerant, so I swapped 1 for 1 coconut milk for the cheddar cheese soup.  Still creamy and very flavorful.  Next time I will add a bit more coconut milk to up the creaminess.

This was perfect for using up freezer and pantry ingredients. Used elbow macaroni instead of shells, and used water plus beef bouillon in place of beef broth. Turned out nicely. Good comfort food that is simple to prepare. I would make again when I want to use up ingredients I already have on hand. Thanks!

I was looking for a recipe to use up some ground beef when I found this recipe.  I had all the ingredients on hand.  It was great.  The Mr. liked it too and he's a fussy food snob.  Thanks for sharing.

My family and I really enjoyed this meal it was quick and easy. I did sautee the onions as well and added some chili powder and garlic powder. My daughter is very sensitive to spicy food so I also mixed some sour cream after it was cooked and she loved it.

This recipe was so easy and awesome tasting- thank-you! I made a few changes. I sauteed an onion, 3 cloves of garlic and some carrots with the beef. I added some spices- garlic powder, chili powder, pepper, and parsley. At the end I added about 1/2 a cup of graded cheddar cheese as well as sour cream like the other review. YUMMY!

This was plain, plain, plain.  Followed the recipe to a "t" except that I added both onion and garlic, per other reviewer's advice.  This was so plain my husband and I could barely choke it down.  It needs flavor and A LOT of it.  Some people added taco seasoning, maybe that would work.  I used mild Pace chunky salsa and maybe if I had used hot salsa it would have been better.  As is, this recipe is not good at all.

Ok so im not sure about this one.  I took others advice and used some onions, garlic and some seasonings.  In the end, it tasted like Hamburger Helper.  But I love Hamburger Helper!  So it makes it very difficult for me.  Next time I think I'll add a little more salsa.  That might make the difference.

My family likes a little more of a kick in their food, so I add a cup of salsa and it did the trick, very easy and quick meal. Will be adding to my recipe box.

alright as is, but i added as some other users suggested one onion and 2 cloves of garlic to the sauteeing beef.  i also added 1 tbsp of chili powder, 1/2 tsp garlic salt and a few shakes of hot sauce.  my sauce was a bit runny but that could have been my fault so i added a bit of corn startch mixed in cold water.  yummy dinner!

AWESOME! Kind of like hamburger helper tasting... I didn't have cheese soup so I used cream of mushroom and added shredded cheddar.  I also added chopped bell peppers and used broad egg noodles.

Very simple to make.   We added Wisconsin medium cheddar cheese to it on the top after it was finished.  You can never have enough cheese.  I would make this again.

I've been making this for years. My recipe uses either shells or elbows. Depending on what I have on hand is what I use.  Also I use only 1 can of broth and 1 C of salsa. This is a nice quick meal.

Delicious.  I think the secret in this recipe is really good salsa.  I used a fresh, local salsa that I love and it made the dish.  Cheddar soup is not something I've used much but it made this dish ooey and gooey and comforting.

I made a few changes, such as adding cumin, chili powder, and garlic. I also used rotes instead of salsa. I added shredded cheddar and jack cheese at the end. All in all, very flavorful. Not bad for a quick meal.

Yummy comfort food! And so easy to make! I added some onions, a little garlic and some spices with the hamburger. This is a keeper.

I switched out the cheddar soup for a jar of old El Paso queso cheese. It was a flavour bomb.

This turned out amazing! It was a great base recipe and I gave it four stars because I made modifications. I cooked the beef with a small chopped onion and added 1 pack taco seasoning as others had suggested. I used a low sodium organic beef broth and did need to add more to fully cook the noodles. I'd say just watch the noodles and add more if you feel it's needed. Then to cut back on sodium and other not so nice ingredients, I used a queso cheese dip instead of the condensed soup. It was amazingly rich and flavorful. The queso added a "kick" to it. Super easy and fast to make and the boyfriend couldn't get enough of it!

I made my version with chicken instead of beef. I felt like it needed more liquid to cook the noodles so I added 2 cups of hot water and then once the noodles cooked I strained some out. Also, 1/2 cup salsa might not be enough. It's not a strong flavor. In the future I will add a bag of the Mexican Style cheese that has spices blended in to give it more spice and flavor. Overall though, very happy with this quick, kid friendly meal!

My daughter absolutely loves this. She kept saying it was amazing. I did season the meat as it was cooking, however. Great recipe that was enjoyed by the whole family.

Quite a hit with the family. Everyone thought it was a Hamburger Helper meal, too. This will be a staple for a quick meal going forward.

So, my husband made it so it's hard to REALLY rate it but I thought it was good, just a little on the dry side for me. Maybe he didn't make it correctly but I would definitely make it again and see how it turned out. Maybe use chicken broth instead and top with sour cream and chives to dress it up some. I'll update next time:).

This is like homemade hamburger helper. It's not gourmet, but it is great on this cold winter night. I added a handful of Mexican blend cheese on top. Delicious and hard to mess up!

Additions made:  @ 1c shredded cheese,  @ 1/2c more salsa than called for in recipe.  This came out much better than I thought it would.  Major bonus- my super, o-so-picky 3-yr old devoured it :)  I served this with Tostitos scoop chips for a super filling nacho style dinner.  Very nice, will definitely make again!

Made this tonight and hubby and son in law loved it!  And my 12 year old granddaughter said it was delicious and asked for seconds. The only change I made was I had to make my own cheese sauce because I didn't have the soup. However, I set out salsa, dot cream, and cheese so everyone could put more to their liking. Quick and easy and a keeer!

This was a pretty easy recipe to throw together in a friend's poorly equipped kitchen. I did add one packet of taco seasoning to a double batch while browning the ground beef and used tomato and spinach pasta. The guys really liked it. And my husband bought the ingredients to make it again, unprompted, so it is apparently a keeper. Thank you for sharing this!

This was quick and easy. It had a good taste, but I also added onion and garlic to the meat, and cayenne and cilantro to the final mixture. I will definitely make again, next time with a spicier kick. Thanks for the recipe!

OK, so it's basically home-made Hamburger Helper, but sometimes, with kids.... that's not a bad thing!  My 13 year old loved this.  I followed other reviewers' recommendations to add garlic and onion (and just used pre-minced out of a jar for both, added in with the broth).  I had to use beef bouillion as I was out of the boxed broth.  I started out with 2 cups of shell macaroni, and used 2 1/2 cups of broth which was NOT enough.  When the water was almost completely boiled out, I tested a piece of the pasta and it was nowhere near done enough.  I probably added at least another cup of water and continued boiling.  I also added more salsa than called for, and used Fiesta Cheddar Cheese soup, as it was all I had on hand.

My husband was cooking so he followed the recipe exactly. I will say my kids ate it really well (they are 2 and 3) but I found it really bland as is. I could see it being much better with more seasoning and cheese on top but this time around, it was just okay.

This was really good! I added a little extra broth,  I added some onion sautéed that with the beef, and doubled the salsa I also added an extra can of cheese soup but I think half an extra can would have been enough. I added some Worcestershire sauce and seasoned salt. Turned out quite tasty! And made plenty!

I made this last night and  was not a fan.  I made the mistake of not reading the reviews as this needed some serious help.  I should have known based on the ingredients. My husband asked me when I bought Hamburger Helper.  It may have improved if I swapped out the cheese soup for Velveeta cheese and added other ingredients based on other reviews but then it would be a different recipe.  Don't think I will make this again, not even with changes.

This was a quick, inexpensive, and easy meal to make for my husband and myself after work!  I added some salt, pepper, onion, and garlic while browning the beef and topped the meal with sour cream and cheddar cheese.  My husband, who thinks he is a food critic, said this was easily on our "repeat" list.

not bad, quick and easy...I added more cheese, even though I used the same salsa I dip chips in, it seemed spicier in this dish.
