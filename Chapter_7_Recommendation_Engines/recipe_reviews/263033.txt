I have been eating Keto for 5 months now and have literally tried at least 20 different recipes for bread.  Most were dense at best, grainy and tasteless at worst.  This is by far the best recipe I have tried.  It raise, was light and fluffy and browned really well and best of all it tasted great, even my husband liked it.  Definitely a keeper.

This bread is phenomenal!  I think of it as low-carb gluten free! I made if following the directions exactly.  For those who got a dense or hard loaf, maybe you didn't use a mixer? Or maybe you didn't mix it long enough?  I used my standard hand mixer and beat the eggs at room temperature then added in the butter and olive oil.  Beat again to a smooth consistency.  Probably 2 - 3 minutes?  That's 180 seconds max.  You can do it! Then I added the almond flour 1 cup at a time mixing well between additions.  I also added the baking powder and xanthan gum between the first and second cup of almond flour.  I beat that mixture on high for maybe another 2 minutes tops after adding the second cup of almond flour.  It's a lovely thick/creamy batter that has an interesting consistency.  I had lined my loaf pan with parchment paper so the loaf would come out clean.  Make sure you level out the batter before putting it in the oven.  I baked mine in my convection oven and it rose beautifully.  Once cooled I sliced it and the crumb is absolutely lovely! Not dry! Not heavy! Not mushy! Not wet!  It has a nice eggy flavor (DUH...it has 7 eggs!) and I can imagine it toasted or used to grill a cheese sandwich!  Fingers crossed it will keep a few days.  I'll be storing in the fridge for good measure.  Thank you for sharing this.  It is seriously good!

I made it a couple of times exactly per the recipe and it was great.
I then added 1/3 cup of Stivia and 1/2 cup chopped pecans to the flour mixture and 1/2 tsp vanilla to the egg mixture before blending.  If you want a little sweeter bread and can handles the nuts, I think it's a winner.

Not sure if I was suppose to use mixer or not so I didn't. Batter wasn't stiff but it baked just fine. Very buttery and much more tasty than most store bought healthy breads. It's a keeper!

This recipe was easy and holds up well for sandwiches and toast. I was afraid it would take eggy so I did add 1/4 cup ground flax seed and used only 1 Tbs of olive oil instead.  It turned out great.

I really, really wanted to like this bread but it was just no good. It turned out beautifully exactly like the picture but the taste was so bland, almost like an old shoe.   I even tried toasting a slice and putting butter on it but still no.

This is a wonderful “base bread” that can be taken in a lot of directions. I added orange zest, fresh thyme, flax, chia, and hemp seeds (1/4 c each). It came out great. I plan to make a sweet(ish) version with cinnamon and walnuts or pecans. I don’t know anything about Keto but I like cutting back on gluten, boosting protein, and experimenting with recipes. 
Thank you!

I love this recipe. I'm sure it's better with the xanthan gum, but I didn't have any. The bread was still dense. Great flavor compared to some other keto breads I've made (not super eggy). I've also made this with 1cup almond flour and 1/4 cup coconut flour love it that way too.

I made the recipe using 5 duck eggs instead of 7 chicken eggs, and baked it in 6 mini loaf pans for about 35 minutes. Incredible rising during the baking process. Excellent flavor and texture. You have to mind the carb and calorie count, though. Each mini-loaf makes two servings. Each serving is  247 calories and 7 carbs. Almonds have carbs, and are high calorie in the amount used for almond flower. So … one serving with eggs a day is about it for me. OTOH, the possibilities with spices and additives (dried blueberries?) are worth exploring.

Very easy recipe. Didn't have a useable loaf pan so I used a heavy guage round cake pan. It worked a bit like a cornbread cake. Cutting it into wedges, slicing into layers and toasting those worked great!

I've made it several times each came out fine. Very rich and buttery and dense like pound cake. Can be toasted but it may take two cycles to brown and still doesn't get crispy as standard breads.

Best keto bread that I have tasted by far!  It is great that it is only 3 net carbs per slice!  I am going to make another loaf, slice and freeze it.

Very good!  This bread reminds me of a fluffy, eggy cornbread.  The flavor and texture are great and I had no trouble buttering it.  I also am terrible at making bread, but this was fool proof.  Thanks so much!

Very easy recipe! I tried another one prior to this and it required whisking egg whites into froth. This was much easier! Two tips though...add a few drops of Stevia to help with the eggy taste. Also, bake for 60 min at 350 degrees, vs 45 min. Mine came out a bit on the spongy side at 45 min, even though the toothpick came out clean. Other than that, great recipe!

This is wonderful bread. I did not have xantham gum so I replaced with the same amount of agar agar mixed in a tablespoon of water. Turned out perfect.

I made this bread yesterday and I want to tell you that it is very similar to one of my favorite breads "Irish Soda Bread". I did use 5 eggs and 2 TBLS. of flax meal instead of the 7 eggs. I added just a touch of vanilla and it was just wonderful. It raised up to abut 2/3 height in my regular loaf pan. The crust was lovely brown and the center was just right. It toasts great and I made toasted cheese sandwich with it...yum...Thanks for great recipe.

I’ve made this recipe 3 times. The first time I followed it exactly and it turned out great. The second time I substituted 1/3 C coconut flour for 1C almond flour and it turned out great. My husband even likes the coconut flour recipe better. Thanks!!!

All the Keto breads I have made of course do not taste like the bread we are use to. This one tastes like corn bread and is more palatable than others I tried. I had a piece hot from the oven with butter on it and enjoyed it.

Best keto bread ever !! Did exactly as recipe said, I let the 7 eggs get to room temp faster by putting them in a ceramic bowl, covering with a towel, and letting them sit on top of the warm stove top. As I’m sure many stove tops, like mine, get a little warm while the oven is preheating(at 350F per the recipe).  
I used a standard handmixer and everything turned out great. If you don’t have a silicon bread pan, lining your loaf pan with parchment paper/ wax paper works great. I’ve  had the bread now for the past 3 or 4 days, I keep it wrapped in parchment  paper in the bread tin on the counter top. Still nice and spongy/bouncy  on 4th day. Tastes great toasted too!! For those who are saying it’s plain, well duh. Who eats toast with literally nothing on it? (May try adding rosemary to the recipe next time around) It’s the crunch you are after, no? If you are a long time keto-er like me, you will appreciate this recipe. Slice and toast the bread and dress it up by  slapping  some cream cheese and cured ham on it. This recipe is a keeper

It was quick and delicious.

My husband and I live in Hawaii and are seniors. We started packing on the extra pounds so started Keto. My husband a diabetic and had high blood sugar. 4 weeks in we have lost 8 lbs each and his blood sugar normal. We feel great and never hungry.

I just made this and YAY!  Have tried a few others and they tasted eggy and dry.  The only thing I changed was added 1/2 tsp Swerve and a few twist of my Italian seasoning grinder.  Hubby, who packs his lunch daily is one happy man!  Thank you!

There are a lot of complaints saying it's too eggy. I separated my eggs and  made my egg whites into meringue. and then folded into the rest of the batter. I added a pinch of salt. While i didnt use the blanched almond flour, i used finely  sifted almond flour.  It didnt taste 'eggy' to me or nutty. I did  toast it before i ate it.  I plan on making 2 more variations using this recipe, one being garlic texas toast, the other a 'cinnamon roll' loaf.  This is fantastic. cheaper to make than buying it for $8+ online or in store.

This was my first time making bread from scratch! I am new to keto and was struggling without the bread, so this is a great treat. I had no xanthan gum, so I replaced that with cornstarch instead and I love the taste. It does have a cornbread feel to it on the palate though, and next time I may add vanilla or swerve to it to give it some flavor. Overall though, this was very easy to make and I’m satisfied with the outcome. I’ll def be making again!

YUMMY! It does have a pound cake texture, but really hit the mark when I was craving some bread! Definitely making more.

Was expecting/hoping it would rise enough to make a grilled cheese sandwich! Only about 2inch raise. Taste was ok. I subbed 2nd cup of almond flour with 2/3 c coconut flour-maybe it would have raised more using just the almond flour? I don’t know. Won’t make again. Did use with fried eggs but that was all.

I'm new to Keto so I'm looking for a good bread recipe since I love bread. However, this is definitely not it. It was way too eggy. I felt like I was eating day old French toast. I'll keep looking for a Keep friendly bread recipe.

It turned out pretty good. Tastes, I’ll admit, takes getting used to, but it's definitely not bad at all. It makes a good sandwich. Chances are, at some point, I'll do more experimenting (as the daughter of a scientist). Recommended.

The bread I made came out just like the pictures for the recipe. I would describe this bread as “dense” similar to almost corn bread. If you held a slice of white bread in one hand and this bread in the other you would feel the weight difference. Also it is spongy, but not hard necessarily. However, it tastes lightly of egg (not corn) and the oil and butter give it enough fat to stay moist and buttery to the taste.

Made exactly as said, my only problem was it stuck to the bottom of my loaf pan (I don’t have a silicone and should have covered the bottom with parchment paper) and only change I made was I added some everything bagel seasoning just because I wanted that flavor. The recipe as written is awesome and the best tasting bread I have had since having to go gluten free. This is a wonderful recipe as is, but also an awesome base recipe that you could make any flavor you would like. It is also really good toasted.

This is very easy and very good, and extra flavors would make it even better.  Next time I'll use a muffin tin and add different things to each one.  Pumpkin pie spice was recommended in another review and sounds great, I'd also try green chilis, cheese, roasted red peppers, bacon, things like that. This will be fun to play with!

I saw “best keto bread” and thought I would try it.  The hardest thing about going keto has been having to give up bread,   This was horrible.  It tasted like a bad batch of corn bread.  Very dry and crumbly.  Not what I was expecting.

I made this recipe exactly as written, except I use regular almond flour and not blanched. I did this because I wanted the texture and consistency of whole grain bread. It did not disappoint.

I made this bread exactly per the recipe. It is good, but sort of bland. I will definitely make it again and may try it with blueberries or cranberries in it. It certainly is a good base. Thank you.

I was drawn to this recipe because unlike many other keto bread recipes it didn't call for 2-3 cups of cheese.  It's smart to read the reviews because they are very helpful.  This is one of my first forays into keto based recipes.  I was a tad hesitant because 7 eggs is a lot of eggs but I decided to take the leap and try.  The results were very good.  I liked the consistency and the density very much.  

Important keys - make sure you whip those eggs the full 3 minutes.  Also check the date on your baking powder.  Not all BP is created equal and stale or cheap BP won't give you a decent rise.  BTW, best pricing for Almond Flour is def at Costco.  

This recipe is super versatile.  Could easily be swung to savoury or sweet.  Next time I'm adding diced jalapenos to give it some attitude.  Could easily be sweetened with a touch of Swerve sweetener, citrus zest and an extract.

I am so happy I found this recipe. When you’re on the Keto diet, sometimes a girl just has to have a piece of bread! I made it just as the recipe stated and it turned out perfect. I will most definitely make this again and will try some of the versions that I read in the reviews.

Fantastic recipe. I substituted Psyllium husk powder for Xanathan gum.
I used 4 teaspoons.
I also substituted Coconut oil for Butter. Same amount as in recipe.
I shut the oven after 35 minutes and just let it sit there for about an hour.
This one’s a KEEPER!

I’ve made this a few times and it’s good every time. I do advise that you let the eggs become room temp as stated; life changing as far as texture of keto bread!! A lot less dense! Sometimes I add chia seeds too still great lol

Lighter than other keto breads and surprisingly un-eggy with 7 eggs.  Make sure you really beat the eggs.  I don't use Xantham gum so added another 1/2 tsp baking power.  I've also sometimes added chopped pecans, vanilla, 1/3 monkfruit, and tsp pumpkin pie spice and a little ginger.  Even my husband enjoys it.

Incredibly simple to make, I thought it wouldn't be enough salt, but I followed the recipe exactly and it came really well.  Dense, and heavy, but also fluffy and airy enough.  REAL bread,  Great color and firmness - a touch 'eggy' but I suspect because I used 7 LARGE eggs I had a bit much egg in there.  I think this is an excellent recipe to use as a base and experiment with (sunflower seeds are up as an addition next, and 10 minutes before finishing I may brush the top with butter and sprinkle some seasoning on top.

Thanks for the great recipe!  Can't wait to make toast with it in the morning and finally have something to put my eggs on top of.

I have replaced the xanthan gum with 1 tbsp of gluten flour, and used one less egg.  it turns out great.  it tastes more like corn bread, everyone likes it.  I will reduce the salt next time, it is too salty for me.

Tried other Keto breads and this one is best for ease of making, versatility (can add different spices, etc for different flavors), and especially texture.

Made this as written and thought this was very good. I will add cinnamon and sweetner the next time around but this recipe is delicious as is. However please be aware my store bought keto bread is 2 net carbs 65 calories a slice. This bread is 2 net carbs 267 calories a slice. WOW!!!!!

Instead of using the yolks of all the eggs I used 3 and the rest of it was egg whites. I also added , half a packet of yeast prepared, a capful of pure vanilla extract, and about half a 1/4 cup of monkfruit sweetener. It still has an egg taste but it's not really strong. Next time I'm going to try with no yolk at all. It's very fluffy and so far the best recipe yet.

Love this recipe! Bread came out really really good! I didn't have  a rectangular pan so I used a round baking pan. I also used Chia seeds instead of xantham gum and added 1/3 cup stevia. Love love love it!!!

Thank you SO much for this recipe! I made this today and Oh My Goodness, this bread is delicious. I know you are suppose to slice it when it has cooled down but, I could not resist.
Even warm, the bread slice so nicely without falling apart.
I made a warm tuna fish sandwich for my husband and myself and he was DELIGHTED to have bread he could eat.
Your recipe was easy to follow without any complications.
This will be a weekly being made in our house. THANK YOU!

This recipe was easy to make using my Kitchen Aid stand mixer. It has a texture like corn light bread and is good for making toast. I left out the zanthan gum the first time and when I used it on the second go I think the taste improved. My husband loves it.

As others have written, it is super bland.. I made a french toast with a couple of slices in a pan with butter. Since it has so many eggs in the bread, no need to soak. Just put it in the pan.. some sugar free syrup and it was really good.

I made it and it was delicious. Next time, I may increase the ingredients by another 50% in hopes that it bakes up a little higher and is closer to the size of "real" bread. But it was seriously yummy and satisfied my bread craving.

I liked the texture.  I added cinnamon, nutmeg, monk fruit and coconut which made the almond flour taste less prominent.  I also used one less egg and 1/2 tsp more baking soda.  I will make again.

Smells real good! I put in 1/2 cup of coconut flour instead of  all the almond flour, ( 1 1/2 cups of almond, 1/2 cup coconut flour ) it’s rising nicely!

I made a couple changes. Mixed egg Yokes + two extra egg whites with the dry ingredients. Separated egg whites and whipped with 1/4 tea of cream of tartar then folded into the yolk mixture. Then topped with graded Parmesan, sesame seeds and oregano. 
Wish it could be more lighter/fluffy.  Maybe the eggs were still a little too cold?

This was my first time trying to bake or cook something for that matter from scratch.  I'm not allwed in most kitchens except as a taster.  I made this bread and it turned out sensational--hit a home run for sure.  I am so happy that I can eat bread again.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used butter in stea of spray to grease the pan.  I can already see how to build on this as I want to make a rye bread if at all possible as I love rye and the darker breads.  I am looking forward to making this bread for my friends as well because they have been so supportive and encouraging me to go for it!

Made this exactly as posted. Looks great, tastes good. Wish it was taller but my loaf pan is pretty big so maybe in a smaller loaf pan it would rise better to have more of a sandwich bread look. Regardless,  I slathered Kerry butter and ate with a cup of coffee. Ahhhh, didn’t realize I missed bread so much.  3 months Keto, 20 lbs down. I can learn to love this bread!

I made this exactly like it said even mixing the egg mixture for 3 minutes until creamy!!  This is a very good alternative to not having bread on a low carb eating plan!!  I prefer mine toasted but would like it plain as well!!  Has anyone put stevia or a low carb sweetener in there bread just to give it a slightly sweet flavor like real bread??

I didn't change anything other than making 2 small loaves. 
The bread is a bit eggy, but still very good. I'll make it again.

I had my doubts. Made it last night so I could have it toasted this morning.  It did not disappoint!  It is rich, buttery, tender and delicious.   My only issue will be guarding it so my husband doesn’t eat the whole thing before I get home tonite!
Note: I melted One Cube of butter which is way different than 1/2 cup melted butter.

Added  two large cloves chopped garlic plus handful of fresh rosemary to enhance flavor. Bread came out good however do yourself a favor and line the bottom of the pan because even though I used proper amount of oil plus some it’s stuck to sides and bottom

I followed the recipe closely and it turned out fine as far as texture, etc.  I would not make a full sandwich with it but have used it for breakfast with some almond butter and open-face sandwiches and it was good. The main part is that it held me well through lunch.  I added a  ton of cinnamon and nutmeg and it added flavor that would have been missing.  I'd recommend this recipe for sure.

I'm a little disappointed because of all the great reviews. It is bland and didn't rise to sand which slice height which is why I baked it so....yeah, disappointed.

I really like having a bread option, but it is super dense, almost like a pound cake.  I couldn't really cut it thin enough to enjoy for a sandwich.
