tasty but for the amount of time it cooks for I was expecting a bit more. I think the same thing could be made in a lot less time.

I wanted something reminiscent of Coq au vin, so I made a few modifications: 1/2 cup of white wine in place of some of the broth, also added tarragon and bay leaf for that sweetish/spicy flavour.  And more flour, as everyone else mentioned.  Great recipe

Very good. The sour cream is a bit strong throughout the dish. But all in all it's very good. I think maybe cream of mushroom soup in place of the sour cream might be a nice alternative. My husband who doesn't like sour cream said it was very good. I didn't use a separate pan to melt the butter in as per the instructions I just moved the chicken to a warm plate finished that step and put it back in. Then did the same thing to blend in the sour cream. Saved dirtying another pan.

This dish is wonderful! I made one alteration by using low fat sour cream and increasing the flour to thicken the sauce. Everyone had seconds and asked when we could have this again. This recipe doesn't dissapoint!

This was alright but it wasn't great. Maybe I didn't enjoy it very much because I ommitted the mushrooms.. But I don't like mushrooms!

This is a delicious recipe although I substituted fresh mushrooms for the canned. It takes a long time to cook but is well worth the time.

I would have rated this higher but looking over this recipe as it's presented I could tell it was a good idea needing quite a bit of work. Cut back on the broth and sour cream by 1/2 or you'll have soup. I used fresh baby bellas in place of the canned mushrooms. I also cut the chicken up smaller to cut down on cooking time. There really is no need to use 2 pans for this recipe unless you enjoy extra cleanup. It can all be done in one large pan. Served over whole wheat noodles and was decent.

Wow this was one delicious chicken dish. The flavors of this recipe really come together & while it does take around an hour & 15 minutes just to cook the meal it is a labor of love. Believe me the wait is worth it!

This was very nice. Not quite company fare but my family would deserve this meal. I followed the recipe to the tee. The sauce was not that thick. I should like to reduce it more next time I make this and I will definitely make this again (thought I thought the chicken was dead dead dead after over an hour - surely we can pare this cooking time down.)

This was quite tasty! I used fresh rosemary instead of dried & added a little white wine & dijon mustard to the sauce. It turned out to be a really delicious sauce!! The chicken was a little dry but I think that was my fault-not the recipe's.

My family did not care for this recipe at all. The dish was bland and the sour cream was about the only flavor that came through. The sauce was not thick at all and would have to simmer then stand much longer than what the recipe calls for. This dish actually tasted better re-heated as leftovers! Will not make this again unless I try using cream of mushroom soup like another recipe suggested.

Very good recipe with some adjustments. I Added white wine replacing 1/3 of the broth added 1/2 tsp. thyme salt and pepper to taste and used fresh mushrooms. These gave the recipe a much-needed flavor boost. Also unless you like your sauce soupy triple the flour. I served this over pasta and got rave reviews from my family.

My family loves this! I double the recipe and put extra sour cream in it. Serve it up over egg noodles and italian bread on the side...

After adding a 16 oz pkg of fresh mushrooms with the garlic and onions and using 1 1/2 cups of chicken stock I had way too much liquid. In an effort to thicken the sauce I used the entire 16 oz of sour cream although I had intended to use only half. While I would definitely recommend the fresh mushrooms I would use an 8 oz pkg reduce the broth to maybe 3/4 cup and add a splash of white wine for additional flavor. I would try cutting back on the sour cream as well to reduce the overall fat content.

Decent base recipe. I used leftover turkey meat 1/2 the rosemary and garlic powder instead of fresh garlic. used about 3/4 c broth and 12 oz fat free sour cream and fresh baby portabella mushrooms. Stirred in some frozen peas at the last minute for some color and served over egg noodles... quick 15 minute meal but not best ever

I found this recipe quite tasty however I blush to confess that I misread it and used thyme instead of rosemary. I don't like rating recipes I didn't make as written because then it's not a rating of the recipe but a rating of my own cooking. However it turned out so well in it's altered state that I wanted to mention it for those who might wish to try. The only other changes I made were using fresh mushrooms and making the sauce a bit thicker.

I made this recipe for my family and the loved it. It was easy to prepare I used fresh mushrooms instead and because I served it to my 1 year old boys I omitted the onions. I also prepared it in 1 pan as per other reviewers. I too reduced the amount of broth and sour cream and used 8 pieces of thinly sliced breast so therefore. My guess is that the orignal recipe (somewhere along the lines) called for split bone-in chicken breast and that does require longer cooking. Anyway we enjoyed it it was easy to prepare smelled great. I served it over Farfelle and with green beans. Next time I'm going to have french bread on hand to soak up the sauce.

Yum. May replace our old favorite of Champagne Chicken. After reading reviews I used thighs and drumsticks and 8 oz. fresh mushrooms. My husband doesn't eat garlic so I substituted 1 Tbsp ground ginger. Sauce was fine not runny. Thought this was easy and excellent!
