I was craving chocolate dessert one nite and came across this recipe.  It wasn't bad, I just don't like the instant pudding taste.. BUT I modified it the second time and it came out BETTER! I added about 3/4 cup semi-sweet chocolate chip in the recipe.  I first melted the chocolate chip with half of the milk in the recipe (for extra milky favor, use evaporated milk instead) in a pan in very low heat (and keep stirring). Add that milk chocolate mixture to the pudding mix. Then pour the rest of the cold milk and mix together until smooth. Put that pudding in the fridge for half and hour (make sure it is cold).
Then fold in the whipped topping afterward and watch that pudding become fluffy, just dont over mix or you will get a blah of chocolate 1/2 mousse 1/2 pudding cross-breed.

I used real whipped cream instead of Cool Whip and it was a huge HIT!

Something is missing with this recipe.  I think there may be too much cool whip.  Try using only one 8 oz. container of cool whip and only use the very dark chocolate pudding.  Looks great with a Pepperidge Farm piroullet cookie served in it as a garnish.

My husband and I are chefs and we loved this recipe.  We cut down on the cool whip by half and used chocolate milk to make the pudding mix to increase the flavor.  We also added chopped up milky way bars to the mix for zip and served with raspberry sauce and chocolate drizzle. It is not restaurant grade mousse by far, however I would make this at home any time!

Tastes OK for kids, but instant pudding and cool whip isn't a recipe.  This isn't a mousse.

I altered the recipe a bit. Instead of 1 1/2 cup milk I used 2 packs of chocolate pudding and only 2 1/2 cups of milk. This way the pudding was nice and thick and intensify the chocolate flavor. Also Instead of a 16 oz container of Cool Whip I used 2- 6 oz containers of Chocolate Cool Whip.   It tastes creamy, it's thick and delicious! I think you could even add chocolate chips for something extra.

While I am sure this did not taste exactly like "real" chocolate mousse, it was divine and I proudly seved it to guests last night for dinner.  I added a little Bailey's and made a raspberry sauce to go with it.  I served it in chilled wine glasses and it looked very impressive.  Don't let the simple recipe for you, this doesn't have to be just for kids!

Excellent starter recipe!  Looking through all the other reviews, I decided to make some adjustments too.  I tripled the recipe so 3 boxes pudding (which should require 4 1/2 cups milk) but I used 2 cups white milk and 2 cups chocolate milk, and added 1/2 cup chocolate syrup. Mixed this up and placed in the frig to firm up. About 1 hour before serving I folded in 8 oz cool whip and place back in the frig.  This was nice and thick and very yummy!!  Will definitely make again!

This was a quick, easy pudding dessert. It tastes good and kids would like it. It does not meet the qualifications for a mousse. I suggest the Hershey's recipe if you want a delicious mousse for a special occasion.

I made this with fat free milk and lite whipped topping and it was absolutely delicious.  The only problem was I could'nt stop eating it.  My seven year old who is very picky even liked this.  Try it you'll like it!!!

Had thius years ago -so glad to find the prorportions again!  Super easy and good for folks that can't go w/ traditional mousse due to the eggs.  I usually add a shot of Kahlua in it as well.

This recipe is great for a quick mousse!  I usally serve it with fresh fruit. It's also not bad to use sugar free pudding.

A fabulous recipe! If you use coolwhip it isn't very good but it is fantastic when you use real whipped cream. You don't really have to use frozen whipped cream, it works fine with regualr whipped cream.

Not a "gourmet" mousse, but was still fantastic.  Incredibly easy to make.  Also, very versatile.  Try serving it with fresh fruit as a dip or in an edible chocolate bowl with some fresh raspberries.

Everyone that tasted this loved it. I like that its not the "real thing" because its not too intense. I used sugar free instant pudding and had good results with it.

For even more rich chocolate flavor, I used chocolate flavored whipped topping and dark chocolate pudding mix.  Garnish with some chocolate shavings and it's as good as any restaurant recipe!

The gist of this recipe is good. My pudding mix was only 1.5 oz, but the package called for 2 cups of milk. I used 1 1/2 cups of milk. I only used about 4 oz of my fat free Cool Whip. Because some other people complained about the "instant pudding taste", I used a squirt or two of chocolate syrup. After about 30 minutes, it was ready. I thought it was great. Granted, I did add the syrup and used whole milk. If you've ever had a Hershey's pie or an Edward's chocolate cream pie- that's exactly what it tasted like.

So I love this recipe it is one of my favorite go to desserts I make it as a pie most of the time but I have also used it to ice a cake a couple times. I did tweak it by using home made whipped topping but all in all it's great

Really good and sooo super easy! I made this for my daughter's birthday. I made a graham crust from this site and placed a vanilla layer on the bottom (used vanilla instant pudding) and the chocolate layer on top. I also piped stars with it and wrote "happy Birthday" to her and the mousse came out very light and fluffy. I then froze the Mousse cake and it was so delicious!

So easy and light, especially when using the lighter options... light cool whip, nonfat milk and possibly sugar free/non fat pudding mix. (I haven't tried it yet but I will!!!) This is very good between thin layers of chocolate cake.

This recipe was awesome!  My fiance was on a diet and I wanted something kinda fancy to do for dessert one night, so I made this with fat-free pudding, skim milk, and fat-free Cool Whip, and it was still awesome - it didn't affect the taste at all.

I make a thick version of this using less milk so it's more "mousse" like and love it.  I use it to fill cupcakes and also do other varieties on the pudding.  I have made this with vanilla and I tried cheesecake pudding with 3/4c. milk and 1/4c. caramel Bailey's to fill chocolate cupcakes - delicious!

I make this mousse whenever I want something special.  So easy, and egg-free!

It's great spread thick as a filling for chocolate cake.

I made this mousse for the grand finale of my husband's 50th Birthday Wine and Cheese Party. I got ravings about the mousse and I had guests later tell me they regreted not taking some home that night. So easy. So quick. I followed reviewers' recommendation: I couldn't find dark chocolate pudding mix, but I added chocolate whipped topping rather than regular. It gave the mousse a richer flavor. Will do again and soon! Thanks for this recipe.  It was a hit!

This is a pretty good recipe, except 16 ounces of whipped topping is too much - really takes away the chocolate flavor.  Try 8 ounces instead.

The only change I made is that I used chocolate CoolWhip instead of regular. This was delicious and the whole family loved it especially when I added sliced bananas on top! It may not be real "mousse" but it's definitely geared for us busy folk who don't have a lot of time to spend in the kitchen. Thanks Luna!

This was good, but it tasted too much like Jell-O brand pudding.  I wouldn't recommend this mousse if you're wanting to impress.  However, it is a good every day family dessert and is great with fruit!

This was pretty good, I layered it with rasberries, which really gave it a good flavor.  Kind of bland, though without the rasberries.  But after a heavy meal, it was what we needed.

This is good.  I think 16oz is too much cool whip for a 8" crust pie.  12oz. can be used and it will still taste just as good.

This WAS super easy to make and tastes great.  One caution - pay close attention to the size of your pudding package.   A SMALL box of pudding takes one 8 oz container of topping and made 6 nice sized sherbet dish servings.  I'm already planning to make this again for Christmas dinner!

I have made this recipe many times, but with many variations on the pudding flavor. The one thing that I use that makes this "set" well, is DREAM WHIP.... So, the Dream Whip add additional milk as called out on dream whip pkg + amount listed here in recipe. Use a cold/ chilled bowl. This can be put in a pie. Used to be known as DREAM PIE, or Chocolate Dream Mousse

This recipe delivered on its promise. It was really easy. I used it to fill small chocolate desert cups for a Christmas party and it was a huge hit. (I used real whipped cream instead of the fake stuff because I love whipped cream) I can see what some reviewers are saying regarding the pudding taste but it didn't seem to detract from anyone enjoying it. I would definitely make it again.

This is very light and fluffy. Not as dense and rich as a true mousse would be. Super easy for instant gratification. And no problem using sugar-free and low-fat alternatives.

I needed a quick dessert and this one was perfect!  I was feeding my two little grandchildren (3 & 6) and they thought this was a great treat.  The mild chocolate flavor was good for the kids, if I was feeding this dessert to adults, I would modify it as some suggested to a stronger chocolate taste.  Thanks for this simple to make, kid pleasing dessert.

Easy to make and easy to modify. I used vanilla pudding mix and used it on the bottom. I then added chocolate and layered on top.

This tastes nothing like "restaurant quality" mousse." It tastes like instant pudding with whipped topping mixed in--and I only used an 8-oz container. Needs much much less whipped topping and much much more chocolate. It tastes great, and the kids will devour it, but I'm disappointed.

I made the Betty Crocker chocolate pudding recipe with 1 1/2 c milk instead of the mix. Folded in an 8 oz container of whipped topping and put in the freezer to chill before serving. A perfectly good cold treat just not exactly a mousse texture, maybe cream instead of milk? All in all the flavor reminded me of a mousse I've had, just lacking the chocolate chips and nuts.

I needed to make a birthday pie for a co-worker in a huge rush while at work.  Used this recipe, in an oreo crust with some semi-sweet mini-chips melted in the microwave and drizzled over the top, and also some mini chips sprinkled on the top.  A huge success, but would have liked to use some of the suggestions to make it more mousse-like.

Exactly what I was looking for.  I can make this sugar free, regular, or create  a sugar free pie or regular pie.

Added less whipped topping then in instructions and I also used white chocolate mix instead. I topped it with strawberries and shaved chocolate. It came out awesome.

I added l dark chocolate chips and only half the cool whip to make it more chocolatey. Used suggestions from first review. It was every bit as good as mousse from scratch. Excellent would use again

This recipe turned out better than I expected for a chocolate mousse alternative, however I did make a few changes by using chocolate milk(less) and heavy wiping cream instead of cool whip as some of the other reviewers suggested. It was super quick and easy the ingredients were under 20$ & my husband loved it. I will make again in the future.

Loved how easy this was and the light chocolate whipped flavor and texture was delicious.  I will make again and maybe try to freeze for a summer treat.

Lowered the amount of cool whip to 8 oz, and added mini chocolate chips.  It was a hit with the entire family!

I made it using real heavy whipping cream instead of Cool Whip. While the dessert looked pretty (I topped each glass with whipped cream and a truffle), the taste was just OK.  It is definitely not like real mousse and I wouldn't make it again.

Amazing taste. Quick and simple. Thinking of doing variations to it like using french vanilla pudding with graham crackers and coconut on top. Also banana cream pudding with nilla wafers n maybe a banana slice on top.

This really wasn't chocolate mousse, but i made it because it was so simple. It did the trick though, and i pretty much ate it all by myself. I will be making this again.

Thanks for the easy recipe!  I made a 4-layer double chocolate cake for mom's 60th bday and used this mousse for the filling.  Then w/chocolate frosting w/extra chocolate chips in it, we were all on a sugar high after even a small piece!  Wonderfully easy (and DELISH) recipe!

This recipe can even be made with sugar free pudding to cut down on sugar, which is great for diabetics. I love this recipe for ease and great chocolate taste.
