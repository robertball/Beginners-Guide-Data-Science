I used 1 cup mayonnaise and didn't use the evaporated milk.  With just 3 green onions this was really bland. The description mentions bacon but there is no bacon called for in this recipe.  I doctored it up with celery, olives, pickles, garlic salt and a little pickle juice.  As written, this did not go over well with my family.

Made as directed and it was bland.  It does need to be kicked up with something.  Pickle relish, olives,...next time
