WOW!  I made this for my mother-in-laws B-day.  We went to a restaurant for dinner and they allowed us to bring our own "cake" for dessert.  It is a very impressive looking dessert.  We shared the dessert with our waiter staff and hostess.  The raves came from all.  I heard "Awesome", "the best I have ever eaten", and the restaurant wants the recipe.  I guess there isn't a better testimonial than that.
Allow enough time for this to freeze. I did it over night and suggest that it be left in the freezer til you are serving it. It melts fast!!   If you spray the pan "lightly" with pam there shouldn't be any trouble serving it. Young and Old agreed on this one.  Thank you!

VERY RICH AND VERRRRRRRRYYY SWEET. It's almost TOO SWEET. Some members of my extended family couldn't finish their one piece and they are big time dessert eaters! Although it's still good before it completely sets up, it takes SEVERAL hours to harden (Like over night).  It's good any way you eat it though. Be careful to not press the graham cracker crust into the springform pan or it will be hard as stone in the bottom of your pan. I made a second batch with a double layer crust, since I like thick crusts, and I barely pressed it in. Much better.

This is SO good! Tastes like a candybar!I also put it in a 9x13, instead of a springform pan. I will definitely be making this again!

Absolutely scrumptious! This is great to keep on hand in the freezer for unexpected company.  I've made this three times now and I have better luck with the flour/oat mixture if I bake it at 350* and keep a close eye on it. Ten minutes seems to work great. It starts to burn @ 400* for 10 minutes in my oven. I have tried it with both pre-chopped pecans and whole pecans broken into smaller pieces and I like the whole broken pecans the best because they toast better and they lend to the crunchiness in the layers. Using whole crushed graham crackers works better than the store-bought graham cracker crumbs also. My 14.4 oz. box came with three cellophane packs of graham crackers and one pack was the perfect amount. Do not press the crumbs firmly in the pan or you will have a hard crust. A light pat is all you need. The bake time of 6 minutes as stated in the recipe is perfect for the crust. I used a whole jar (17 oz.) of Mrs. Richardson's Caramel Topping, which is my favorite, just remember to save some to drizzle over each cut piece. It will take several hours to firm up so I suggest freezing overnight. My husband loves this recipe and gives this a five star! I also took it to work and one of the guys wouldn’t let me leave without sharing the recipe. Well loved by all!

Super but as everyone says very sweet and rich.  Next time I might eliminate the carmel and add another block of cream cheese.  I made it in a 9x13 pan and it came out fine.

If there were more stars for the rating, I would have clicked on more!  I have prepared this recipe twice for guests and they have loved it... I substituted the regular graham crackers with fat free one, butter for 'I can't believe it's not butter-Lite', cream cheese for 1/3 less fat, regular condensed milk with fat free, whipped topping for Lite, and the caramel topping with fat free.....and surprisingly, it was delicious.  Did I say 'Delicious'?  My husband and I are into healthy eating, but do enjoy a nice dessert and I was able to decrease the calories by more than 200 per serving.  I can still taste it.

This is amazing!  And judging by the ingredients, anyone that does not have a sweet tooth should not even try it!  It's very rich but I couldn't stay out of it!  It was super easy to assemble.  To make sure the caramel sauce doesn't stick to the sides, pour it away from the sides of the pan.  It will eventually spread all over.  I didn't have any pecans around, but it tasted great without that addition.  I even didn't have any oats, so I ended up using a package of instant oatmeal!  This dessert is very versatile to suit your tastes!  Maybe I'll try chocolate sauce next time!!

OMG!  Over-the-top delicious!  Please DO use any and all non- or low-fat ingredients you can because you won't be able to tell much difference.  I certainly hope that you like SWEET when you make this because it is decadently that!  Just follow the directions and give it plenty of time to set (at least 8 hours).  The caramel sauce just slowly oozes out, just as if to dare you!  YUM!

This went over quite well when we had company last night. Might be a tad too sweet for some palates, but no one at my house left much on his/her plate! Note: I froze this for 4+ hours, and it still wasn't set as much as it should have been. I'll definitely make it a day ahead next time.

Everyone liked this a lot.  With reviews saying this was too sweet, I made some minor changes.  I doubled the crust (using only 1/3 cup sugar instead of 1/2), used a springform pan, omitted the nuts (hubby is allergic).  I used 1 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream + tsp. vanilla whipped to a hard peak (whatever you call it) thus eliminating the need for cool whip (which is really sweet, sugar already added), folded it into already mixed 12 oz cream cheese + sweetened condensed milk.  For the oatmeal portion I used 1/4 cup b. sugar not packed.  I used less than a cup of smuckers butterscotch caramel topping (it's not two flavors, but combined in the jar) which is really sweet.  I used a springform with 2 layers.  I ended up using only 1/3 the oatmeal mixture, could have used 2/3.  Think of an ice cream sundae and what toppings you'd like on it.  If you like candy toppings like snickers or butterfingers smashed up, use those instead of the "brickle".  If you prefer chocolate fudge topping, use that.  The cream cheese/condensed milk/whipped cream is what the "ice cream" will taste like (it tastes better frozen with the topping on, than by itself unfrozen).  Be careful, if you use a sauce/caramel/fudge that turns rock hard when frozen, you may be disappointed!  If you don't like the taste of your topping, you will also be disappointed.

I would give this 100 stars if I could.  This recipe has never failed me.  Someone ALWAYS asks for the recipe.  There is never any left.  However, it does go a long way because it is very, very sweet.  Yum...I have been wanting to try it with a different topping, but why change a perfect dessert.

I wish I could give this even more stars.  My 16 year old son (who rarely comments on my food) took a couple bites of this and launched into a poetic diatribe like "How do I love thee?  Let me count the ways."  (I think he liked it ;)

UNREAL!  I made this for a dinner party and everyone went crazy for it.  No one complained about it being too sweet or rich -- just cut it into smaller pieces.  Plus, you can't beat it for a make-ahead dessert!  Thanks!!!!!

This dessert is beyond awesome. It received rave reviews from everyone who tried it, and it was super easy to put together. I made it pretty much exactly as written, except I didn't use quite as much caramel (it was really sweet already!) and I also toasted the brickle mixture for about five minutes after I crumbled it to make it more crispy. The finished dessert looked beautiful and tasted even better. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe...it is unbelievably delicious!!!

i don't know if my other review went or not, I forgot to click the stars! I made my own caramel by simmering Sweetened Cond. Milk in the cans. THis is a VERY rich dessert, and we will keep one in the freezer now for all the time! I didn't leave them in long enough yesterday so will make a day or more in advance from now on. Very easy to make and great pay off!!!!

This is one heck of a dessert! and for those wondering on the richness (i.e. calories), I subbed light cream cheese, condensed milk and cool whip for the regular versions and it was a huge hit! Served this for Easter dessert - wow, everyone gobbled it up! even the "non-cheesecake" eaters ate it! I did make a HUGE booboo while making it though...due to my high excitement level at making such a scrumptious dessert - I was a complete IDIOT in forgeting to put the caramel on the first layer! GRRR....so I dumped more on top and it ran down the sides anyway so all was good! Just learn from my sorry mistake and make sure you put all the items for layering on BEFORE dumping the next layer of cream cheese/cool whip! idiot, idiot IDIOT! sheesh..... ;)

Yes, VERY sweet and rich, but delicious if you like that. Best served in cooler weather as it does melt quickly. I was actually very scared it would not turn out since the cheese mixture was WAY too soupy to maintain the layers. Everything just jumbled together, but after frozen it still tasted great and did not matter at all that the layers did not work. I cut the sugar in the crust and in the butter brickle to half. I think next time I will omit the sugar in the crust entirely and half the brown sugar in the butter brickle. It is just TOO overly sweet with all that sugar. But to each his own... Oh yeah, and I used slivered almonds in place of the pecans and it was also fine.

WOW, this is worthy of waaaaaay more than 5 stars! This is an absolutely incredible dessert and so easy to prepare. I also made this the night before and stored it in the freezer until serving. I did substitute walnuts for the peacans because they were more affordable, but I know this would be equally delicious with the pecans. This totally looked like it came from a bakery. My husband is over here raving over it as I type, lol! I can't wait to share this with my family and friends. MAKE THIS DESSERT...YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED! Thanks for sharing, what has become our new favorite dessert-YUM! :)

Made this for the Fall Department picnic and it was amazing! The only down side is that it melts fast, but it did not last that long on the serving table for that to matter. I used fat free sweetened condensed milk and whipped topping, sugar-free caramel syrup, and 1/3 less fat cream cheese.  The recipe calls for 12 oz of frozen whipped topping, but I only used 8 oz, which is a normal sized container. I also added crushed toffee pieces to the crumbly layer. This one's a keeper!

Oh my gosh!  This was awesome.    You have got to try it.  It almost tastes like a wonderful ice cream cake and it looks so elegant.  Fantastic.  Will definitely be making this often -especially for company.  Thank you so much for sharing this one!

I started out to make it exactly as the recipe but found out I only had a small can of sweetened condensed milk so in view of the fact one reader had said it was a little soupy I only used it and cut back to 3/4 of a carton of cool whip.  It turned out very well and sooo rich... I always print out the recipe I want and then copy some of the changes other have made on the side of the recipe for my own use if I want to make changes myself thus ending up changing it for lack of the ingredient...thanks it was great.

This dessert is incredible! I followed the reciped exactly, except for the pecans. Instead of pecans I used honey roasted peanuts because thats what I had on hand, and I cant imagine not using them for this recipe again! They were prefect with it! I made two of these and they were inhaled by 6 people, three of which arent real big on sweets too!

I'm giving this a 5 since technically I didn't make this like I was supposed to.  I used margarine instead of butter- didn't think it'd make much of a difference but it DOES- oh well, live and learn.  and the freezing taking SEVERAL hours is no joke....

This was on my list of "must try" recipes for my summer trip home to the U.S.  My first impression was that it was REALLY rich and REALLY sweet.    I love desserts, but this isn't one that anyone took seconds of.  I'm not quite sure how to describe it.  The cream part is so heavy, it sat in my mouth, kind of like a too-big bite of fudge (and this was a small bite).  It's a dessert that needs a huge glass of water to help it go down.  I know a lot of people rated this recipe very high, so I was surprised that I didn't care for it.

My family calls this "deliciousness pie". First time made as directed was good. Second time I cut back a little on Caramel Topping which was just too sweet for us the first time.

Wow! Amazing RICH dessert! This dessert is a little labor intensive but well worth it. It got rave reviews from all that I served it too. I used Dessertlovers caramel sauce from this site too, sooo good, I can't wait to make it again.

Also used a 13 x 9, sprayed w/ Pam.  Came out just fine.  The brickle got a little over done, but still turned out delicious. Everyone at church loved it.

If any recipe on this site deserves 5 full stars, this it it!  I make a dessert at least once a week for our church community group and they love to sample the weekly bounty.  I can assure you that everyone voted this as the best dessert!  Comments ranged from, "this is better than the cheesecake factory, the only way this could get better would be to eat it in bed, quit your day job and bake", etc.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I toasted the pecans before adding to the brickle mixture.  I froze in the deep freezer over night before serving.  Yes, this is a very sweet dessert - but hey, it's dessert.  Make a pot of coffee and enjoy!

This was the best dessert we've ever had. My family rated it a 12 on a scale of 1 to 10. It wasn't rich or overly sweet to us. Every bite was eaten.

Awesome!! I made it exactly as is with a little added chocolate to drizzle. It looks so beautiful and tastes so wonderful. I will make this again and again but next time when there are more people around so the left overs can't tempt me.

REally Yummy.  I usually dont like sweet things, but I didnt mind this and my husband loved it. It is so hot where we live and so its nice to have in the freezer and have a little to help cool off. I can only eat a little bit because it is rich, but at least it keeps you from eatting to much :)

This was A-MA-ZING!  I made it in a 9X13 and followed the recipe exactly.  (Small addition was some salt on the oat crumbles while still hot out of the oven).  I brought it to our 4th of July swim party and expected to bring quite a bit home b/c it was so rich.  NOPE!  Brought home a clean dish instead.  Everyone raved over it... YUM!  I think I am going to do this around the holidays but mix in an apple pie filling mix into the cream cheese filling and add some cinnamon and nutmeg to the oatmeal crumbles. :)

This is an absolute must try dessert.  Yes, it is rich.  But the nice thing about this is that the leftovers can be frozen and thawed later.  I used 1/2 fat free cream cheese and 1/2 reduced fat cream cheese, fat free condensed milk and light cool whip.  It was great even with the lower fat ingredients, so I can't even imagine how awesome it is with the "real thing".  The whole gang - from 6-40- loved this dessert.  I will definitely make again, and probably for the next party we have.

I loved this cake and it was so impressive to look at!  I cheated a little and instead of making the brickle I just used crushed up heath bars and mixed those with pecan peices and it worked great.  I also added one more pack of cream cheese so it would taste a little more like a cheesecake.  This is a very decadant desert and you will not be disappointed if you make it.  Really easy as well.

I made this for my granddaughter's birthday. I freely admit that I ruined my Paleo diet by "tasting" this. Okay, I tasted it a LOT. I saved this for when I am feeling naughty. It's worth the guilt.

I made this once for Christmas and everybody loved it. Now, for the holidays this is the dessert I make and instead of making the crust I just buy the graham cracker crust and it works perfectly. This is the favorite dessert now instead of carrot cake!! :)

Good gosh almighty! First off, it's as good as it looks. I read through a lot of the reviews and noticed many reviewers felt it was too sweet so I opted to omit the sweetened condensed milk and sub a 1/2 cup sugar in it's place. Still plenty sweet but I do think it tones it down a bit from the super sticky sweet quality of sweetened condensed milk. Second, making it in a springform pan makes for a beautiful presentation. This is the perfect summer BBQ dessert!

This was so good no one believed I made it! Lol! It is rich but everyone loved it and commented how luscious it was! I did as some suggested and gently patted the graham cracker crust instead of pressing, so it was easy to cut and eat. It is easy to make and even better to have in the freezer on hand! I did make it the day before to be sure it was thoroughly frozen! Thank you! I would definitely make this again!

Just made this for a potluck bbq with 8 families. RAVE reviews! I was so very proud of how not turned out and it looked like a professional chef made it- and I am far from pro...! Make this the night before so you will ensure it will be firm when you serve it- I froze it for 6 hours and was barely ready. Oh so good!

This was good......but very sweet and rich.  And you MUST give it plenty of time to freeze.  I gave it 4 hours and that was NOT enough time.  It was still very soft and when it is not frozen it is EXTREMELY sweet and rich.  When it is frozen hard, it tastes more like ice cream and is MUCH better.

WOW!  This dessert is amazing and so impressive.  My guests were wowed!  My husband said it was the best dessert he's ever had!  I followed the recipe exact except I only had a small can of sweetened condensed milk (10 oz).  I kept all the other measurements the same.  I made mine in a 9" springform pan with great results.  I used pam on the bottom and sides of the pan and I had no problem getting the cake out.  I feel the presentation of the cake would be alot better in the 9" springform as opposed to the 9 x 13 pan.

Ok, this is by far the BEST dessert ever!! I am a huge baker and everyone waits to see what dessert I will make. This is the one that people keep asking me to make over and over. Easy and unbelievably delicious. What is also nice is, if you have leftovers, it can keep in the freezer for months and you can just cut what you need when you want to serve it. A must try, you wont be sorry!!!

I give this five stars cuz' Hubby said this tastes like something you would get at a restaurant.  I thought it was really good, but very sweet and very rich.  Very easy to make, but from now on my slices will be very small!!!! I left out the nuts and didn't miss them at all.

Be sure not to over brown the brickle.

Buster: I don't think I've ever had a better dessert.  This is definately a 5 star.
Wade: I ate the whole thing!  I never eat a whole dessert. 
Lauren's step daughter:  I wish Lori could come to our house and make this for us everyday.

This was decadent.  Very sweet and rich. I received many compliments on this dish, but portions were fairly small and I had a lot leftover.  I will probably double the cream cheese next time I make this dish.  Tips:  Serve immediately from the freezer and put it back in.  Leaving it out for guests to serve themselves makes it gooey.

Wonderful! Every time I make this...people ask for the recipe. I almost don't want them to know how easy it is. Next time, I am going to make my caramel fromsweetened condensed milk like other users have suggested.

STEP A WAY FROM THE PLATE!!!! OMG!!!! Delicious. I can say wow...totally amazing. My family just asked me where I came up with this recipe....here...allrecipes. :) This is totally sinful and soo yummy. I used Sugar free Caramel Sauce made with Splenda and fat free Cool Whip, fat free sweetened condensed milk and far free cream cheese....the butter was I can't believe it's not butter, as well. But man alive, no one would ever thing, this was a low fat dessert, I can't think of using splenda as the sugar replacement in the crust, it might work. But hmmmmm soo good. It's has a great crunchiness to it, it almost taste like Ice Cream, it's just so darn good. It really was easy to follow on the directions and the ingredient list is really simple and not extravagant...As simple as this recipe is, it makes you feel you went and purchased it from a local ice creamery store....At a fraction of the cost.

This recipe was very good - and very rich! I caramelized a can of sweetened condensed milk because it's better for your body than caramel (just look at the back of a jar of caramel! Not good!) The substitution worked marvelously. I just kept this in the freezer and served a few slices when people came over and we got dessert for several night's company out of it!

This was wonderful. It is very rich, so a small piece is plenty. I shared this with the neighbors and got many complements. I put a layer of fudge in the middle just for personal prefence. Either way would be fine. Thanks for sharing!!

I really wanted to like this dessert after reading all the rave reviews.  This is a good dessert, but not out of this world good.  I bake a lot, so I have a few real winners, but this won't be in my collection.

I made this for Easter dinner and OMG!..it is awesome. If you are not a fan of sweet, don't bother. It was like a frozen cheesecake that melted in your mouth after thawing a few minutes on the counter. This will be made many times again for sure. YUM!

Overall very good.  A little too sweet for my taste but guests loved it and some had seconds.  It was difficult to open the springform pan though after it'd been sitting in the freezer for so long and cut finger doing it.

Fantastic recipe. I however, made a few changes. I didn't add 1/4 cup sugar to the crust, I added 3 pinches. I was trying to cut down on the sweetness. I added 2 blocks of cream cheese instead of just the 1, to achieve that goal. With that being said I used the rest of the measurements given. I baked my crumble at 350 for 10 minutes. I have a gas stove so 400 at 10 minutes would have burnt it. But other than the few changes I made it is fantastic. Be warned though, if taking this out to any functions have the recipe and plenty copies in hand!!

HOLY CRACK-A-MOLY!!! This cake was insanely amazing!! It is like cake crack (I'm going to trademark that'll). I can't stop eating it. I'm so glad I had people over last night to help me eat some of it, and that I don't live alone so that I have someone one help me eat it today. If I lived alone I would end up like Miranda from Sex And The City and eat it out of the trash.
I tweaked the recipe a little, and I definitely think it made it better (even though I have never made it exactly as the recipe described). First I used dulce de leche instead of caramel sauce. I also didn't freeze the cake all the way, so it was creamy and fluffy. Oh my god it was so good I can't even describe it properly.

Do not press the graham crumbs too hard on bottom. Makes it hard to cut when it's frozen. Other than that, this is a real keeper. This is the one that you make when you want to wow them. This is "that" dessert that everyone remembers. YUMMO!!!! Thx lorielee

Made this for Thanksgiving dinner and it was amazing.  My family said it's their new favorite dessert.  I agree with the other reviewers that one 9" pie goes a long way.  It's very rich so I cut the pieces smaller than I normally would have.  I'd be interested to make it again and use chocolate sauce rather than the carmel.  Definitely a five star recipe and very easy to assemble.

This was fabulous!  I made it a day ahead of time to take to a house warming party and it was very well received!   I made my standard graham cracker crust (1 1/2 c. graham cracker crumbs, 4 T. butter, 1/4 c. sugar) and used a 9 1/2” springform pan.  I was afraid of burning the oat mixture, so I lowered the oven temp to 375 and baked it for about 15 minutes.  After crumbling I returned it to the oven for about 5 more minutes.  I assembled this as the recipe indicates, but used far less caramel topping and tried to keep it away from the sides of the pan.  The next day I ran a hot knife around the sides of the pan so it would release easily and it did.  To cut this into serving size pieces, I heated my chef’s knife under hot water and wiped it dry in between each cut.  I got nice clean cuts and 16 smallish servings.  I would definitely make this one again!

Very good dessert.  Instead of pecans, I used crushed butterfingers.

This is a delicious dessert that says "summertime" to my family! I like that it can be frozen. I substitute toffee bits for the pecans and reduce the caramel sauce only for one family member who does not like nuts but I'm sure they are delicious especially if toasted first.

Delicious!!!!! A crowd pleaser for sure but extremely messy no matter how long it freezes. I think next time I wont add as much whipped topping to see if it will become a bit more firm.

I was so excited to make this and I will say it did turn out beautiful...but...it is WAY to sweet and I like sweet things.  We each had a piece and the rest has sat in the freezer.  I will agree that this needs to be frozen over nite.  I won't be making this again...sorry:(

Wow. Very tasty dessert.   I put it in a 9 x 13 pan.  Had trouble serving with the crust (next time I will spray cooking oil before I bake the crust.  Also would prefer a thicker crust (with some many layers of sweet).  I did omit the caramel as others mentioned it is already very sweet and rich.  Also next time I would make probably 25-50% more (butter brickle) as the middle layer gets lost among thhe cheese.  Even after freezing over 2 nights it still starts to melt within 5 minutes of serving but tastes good even slightly melted.

This is fabulous!!  I kept some of  the other reveiws in mind of the sweetness and cut back slightly on both white and brown sugar as well as the caramel where I did a drizzle and then spread a little.  It was awesome!! Definitely will be making again.

I made this for a dinner last night. It was unbelievable. Beautiful presentation and delicious. Absolutely perfect. I doubled the crust part of the recipe and didn't press too hard into the pan, I had no trouble removing it as other reviewers had stated. I did make the day before and it was frozen nicely. Removed from freezer about 15 minutes before serving and it was perfect. This will be one of new favorites. Thanks for sharing a great recipe.

MARVELOUS and a huge hit.  You have to use your food processor a couple of times but for such a different and tasty dessert, this is really quite fast...   and it comes out looking like something from a bakery.  Perfect for summertime gatherings.  Make the day before to ensure enough freeze time.

I read the reviews and knew it would be an awesome dessert. Everyone loved it, I kept it frozen until we served it.  Then I slid it onto a cake plate & the caramel started to  drip down the sides, even my weight concious sisters had to have a piece. The whole family loved it.  I will definetly make this again! It also stayed pretty firm standing at room temp.

Ok, so the hubby (who is VERY picky) said this was the best thing he has ever eaten!! EVER! We made this for a friend's birthday and it was SOOO good. Creamy, crunchy, gooey, sweet, salty, and simply just amazing. We have been calling it FANTASTICO. Definitely a keeper!! UPDATE-I gave this recipe to my boss (I work in a cafe), she made it for the restaurant and it was a huge hit there as well. Do not pass this recipe up!!!

Very good for something different.  You just have to make it once and then adjust it to your taste.  I did add an extra block of cream cheese and cut all the sugars & sweetened condensed milk in half.  Therefore, I was able to use more caramel sauce.  Will definitely make again.

This truly is incredible.  I made this as written for Father's Day and it came out wonderful.  I made it the night before and stored it in the freezer.  I pulled it out right before serving and it was very easy to slice.  I served small slices because it is very rich and decadent.  Everyone loved it.  I will be making this again.

This was fantastic!  I read some of the reviews and decided to double the cream cheese and eliminate the caramel.  It was so good and not overly sweet.    Everyone in my family loved it and I already have requests to make it again.

This was gobbled up in no time..It was so tasty even my father in law who is very hard to satisfy when it comes to desserts, had seconds:) I didn't feel that it is so heavy as other reviews suggested...i only felt that the base was a bitter too buttery...(maybe my mistake) other than that it's EXCELLENT..you must try it, won't let you down.

This is awesome, and it looks so very pretty!! i did not think it was too sweet but it is very rich and tastes like a desert out of an expensive restuarant.  i made this as an addition to my thanksgiving dinner and this dish took the spolight.  the only change i made was i only had 8oz of cool whip, but even with that it was great. i recommend everyone should try this dish, especually if you are trying to impress someone with your cooking skills.  mine was set up in about 2 hours so i started cutting into as i could not wait. YUMMMMMMMOOOOOOO!

Simply delicious! I cut the white sugar in half, and did use butterscotch sauce. Very rich, but not too sweet at all.  Perfect dessert for a big crowd, since you don't have to serve large slices of it.  I also used a 9x13 pan since I dont have a springform pan. I froze for 5 hours and it seemed perfect. Yummy! Cant wait to make again and take to my next family gathering.

This dessert was very good.  Everyone loved it.  Next time I make it, I will probably use a 9 X 13 pan, as it will be easier to transport.  Also, I think this dessert would be beautiful served in a triffle bowl and not frozen.  When freezing it, do so overnight.  I put it in the freezer for 3 hours and it was still pretty soft.  Will certainly be making this again!!!

I absolutely agree with the fantastic ratings on this dessert . . . only we don't slice it so thin, cause we can't stop eating it! I do delude myself into thinking I am making this "lowfat" by using Neufchatel cream cheese, Cool Whip light (only used 8 ounce carton), and Splenda in place of the regular sugar called for. The taste was incredible, so I know it really cannot be good for you! :)

I agree with the others who say to slice it thin because of its richness. This recipe is delicious. I took this to a 4th of July cookout and it disappeared in minutes! I've made it twice already and there is never any left the next day. I used walnuts instead of pecans b/c that's what I had on hand. Still delicious!

OMG..... This dessert was one of the best dessert recipes I have tried from this site.  Everyone in the family loved (of course we are all big desert eaters).  If you like butter brickle, you will like this desert.  Couldn't have bought a better frozen dessert and for much cheaper!!

I was getting together with friends & it wasn't even my turn to take the dessert, but I found this recipe & called my friend who was supposed to be bringing dessert & asked him if I could make this instead.  They all raved about it!  It was amazing!  His dream is to eventually open a restaurant, & he said when that happens, I will be in charge of all desserts!  He said this was the best thing he had ever eaten!  I made no changes whatsoever to this recipe & it was perfect!  I will make this again & again!!!  Yummmmmmmm!!!!!

I make this, but my version is not as rich. First I use 2 cups graham cracker crumbs and put it into a 13 x 9 pan. I use a 12 oz tub of lite frozen topping with low fat cream cheese and OMIT the sweetened condensed milk all together. I like to crush 2 Heath toffy bars and sprinkle one with the pecan center and one on top, but you could skip that too. This version is less rich and freezes to serving in 2-3 hrs. I also microwave the caramel just a few seconds to make it easier to drizzle.  This is great for bridal showers and special meals.

This was very nice and quite easy.  We had it frozen and also thawed and soft, both ways were good.  It was pretty sweet, so a little goes a long way.  I made this in a 9x13 pan because we were taking it to a party and it was easier to transport.

I cannot believe anyone would NOT like this dessert! I have made this several times and the reaction is always the same! THEY LOVE IT! Not to mention, I won 1st place with it in a recipe contest for the newspaper! That should say it all! VERY RICH, I cut it in very thin slices but I am ALWAYS asked for the recipe!

This tastes somewhat like a pecan log.  I cooked mine in a regular 9x13 pan instead of a springform and it worked fine.  A hit with the whole family.  It was just as good thawed as it was frozen too.  A winner!

I MADE THIS RECENTLY FOR A GROUP OF TEN, IT WAS THE HIT OF THE PARTY AND EVERYONE WENT HOME WITH A COPY OF THE RECIPE. IT IS A REALLY GOOD DESSERT TO HAVE ON HAND IN THE FREEZER WHEN YOU HAVE UNEXPECTED COMPANY.

This was better than I expected. I changed it a little but not so much that it's a different recipe. I was afraid that it would be too sweet like some reviews mentioned so I cut the brown sugar in half in the crumble. I also added one more package of cream cheese. That toned down the sweetness of the condensed milk. Lastly, I candied some cashews instead of pecans because I don't care much for pecans. I didn't press hard on the crust as others stated and that definitely helps. I also didn't drizzle more carmel sauce on each slice and I only used a little over half of a small jar of carmel sauce for the entire dessert. I didn't want the sweetness to be over bearing. There was a little more cream cheese mixture because of the extra cream cheese but not too much that it messed up the balance of the recipe. I hope this helps!

Update......
I used the same recipe and made another pie but instead I used strawberries and it was wonderful.

This is one of the most delicious things I’ve ever made! I just made it because I had the ingredients, and I ended up eating the entire thing myself .  I will make this regularly for sure, I told my husband I will have it in the freezer all the time. It kept well airtight for over a week. I cut it into slices and put it back in a container. I also second someone else’s review to not press the crust in too hard, because it was difficult to cut through. This time I didn’t press it in tightly, so hopefully it will be easier. I added 1t. of vanilla bean paste to the cream cheese mixture this time too - so good!

I made this for my husband for Father's Day and it was a hit!  I used only 8 oz. of sweetened condensed milk and 6 oz. of whipped topping.  It is still very rich and not too sweet.  Don't press the graham crackers too much or it will be hard to remove from the pan.  Cut your slices thin because it is so rich.
I made it a second time using parchment in a 9 inch square pan.  I was able to lift it out and cut into bars.  I wrapped them individually to take to a party.

This is delicious!  Next time, however, I will put most of the caramel in the middle and drizzle more caramel over top as I serve it.  (My caramel stuck to the Glad Wrap I used to cover it in the freezer and was a little messy to serve--but still tasted great!)  I love having this in the freezer to pull out as needed.  I may drizzle some chocolate over it when I serve it again.  Great dessert!

Very delicious cake. I made it for a dessert contest at my company. Won first place. And had Sooooo many coworkers giving amazing feedback on how good it was. I’ve had a lot of people requesting and already have made a few as Birthday cake. Added the chocolate chips as last touch. Had it in freezer over night or at least 8 hrs.

Oh my lord!  How delicious AND easy to make can a dessert be.  I would suggest though if you want to serve more people to do as others have suggested and make this dessert in a 9x11 pan and do a single layer.  No matter how you make it, it will be a big hit!

I've made this more times than I can count, it's always a crowd pleaser. The pecan mix typically takes longer to brown than the recipes call for, other than that it's perfection.

Fantastic, and  much easier/quicker using graham cracker crust that is pre-made. Sometimes I use the little individual pre-made shells and they are small portions but still really good.

Oh my goodness!  What a delicious, very special dessert.   It is very rich, and one will serve 12.     I took this to a dinner party last night, and all that I heard was "ummm,  this is so good, and I want  the recipe." While it is not difficult to make, there are several steps so it does take some time to complete.   On the plus side,  it is made a day or two beforehand,  frozen, and, when it is time to serve, you don't have to worry about taking out ahead of time to soften.   After reading the reviews,  I made two changes.   One,  I used whipped cream with no added sugar instead of frozen whipped topping, and I added 1/2 tsp. vanilla to the cream cheese mixture.   I will definitely make this wonderful dessert again when I want something special and calories don't matter!

This is a fantastic dessert that EVERYONE loves, however it is incredibly rich.   I disagree with the recipe submitter on the amount of servings this recipe makes.   I sliced up half of the dessert into 12 servings and everyone had a hard time finishing their piece because it was so rich.   I think this recipe is more appropriate serving 25-30 people instead of just 12 as it states.   That's about a 1" piece per person which we thought was about right.   The only thing I changed in the recipe was that I replaced Heath Bar Bits for the pecans because I have one person that doesn't care for nuts.   I didn't add in the pecans until the oat crumble was completely cooled because I didn't want the Bits to melt.   I felt this was a good replacement that left me some of the crunch that a nut would and a complimentary taste to the rest of the dessert.   We don't do desserts often, but I will be making this one again.

AWESOME!  I've made this several times.  I do up the cream cheese by about an ounce or 2.  I don't use the whole amount of caramel sauce, just enough to drizzle between the layers and on top.  It cuts the sweetness. Never any leftovers!  A great desert for guests and makes a beautiful presentation!  I'm thinking about adding some pumpkin puree for the holidays!

This is one of the best desserts I have ever eaten. Served it to my bridge ladies and they gave it very complimentary remarks!

I made this last week for my little cousin's birthday, and it was a success! 

I forgot to put the layer of caramel in between the crunchy layer and the second half of the cream mix, but it was fine without it. This frozen dessert is sooooo good, I had people me asking for the recipe. I will definately make this again! Thanks.

Made this yesterday and all I can say is O M G!!!!!  I  made it in a springform pan as called for, but I'm thinking I will use a 9x13 pan next time as other reviewers have suggested.  I also don't know why it has to be frozen.  I LIKE it frozen, but its just as good to store in the refrigerator.  I have thought about trying chocolate syrup next time instead of the caramel - or even chocolate AND caramel!  MMMMMMMMM.  Course, then the name would have to be changed.  Anyhow, It's a WONDERFUL recipe and will be making it often!  THANK YOU!!!!

This pie is amazing!  My whole family could not stop eating it.  Instead of making the crust, I happened to have 2 graham cracker pie shells at home that I used which saved on time.  I made the pie filling exactly as directed, and to my surprise, it filled up both shells.  2 huge pies instead of one!!  Does it get any better?  Yummy!  :O)

It was very good...but ridiculously sweet. Like most fudge, a very very small piece will do the trick!

This is very good! I only gave it 4 stars because it was suuuuper sweet. I love sweets more than the next person, but this got to be a bit much. My advice - take a small piece and off set the sweetness with a big glass of milk!

I wanted to like this more than I did.  The kids thought this was good, and my husband who is not big on dessert really loved it.  I thought it was good, but a bit too sweet for my personal taste.  I used 4 oz. more of cream cheese as some of the reviews suggested.  I think the storebought caramel sauce put me off (I'm not a big fan of it).  Next time, I will use my own home made caramel sauce instead of from a jar.  Overall, I would make this recipe again with different caramel topping.  I think most people will enjoy it.

I give it 4 stars, hubby only gives 3 1/2! It is a very unique dessert that I have never seen before, pretty easy to make too. I made it in a 9x13 pan and it serves up really nice. It is very rich and sweet so I would say it can serve more than 12.

Excellent!... but serve small portions since it is very, very sweet.  By mistake I only used half the caramel called for and still was extra sweet. Recipe is a keeper.  Thanks!!

I'm giving this 5 stars on behalf of my family. They went crazy over this dessert! I myself would have given it 4 stars, but then again I'm not a fan of ice cream/frozen desserts. But I wanted something cold and frosty to serve at my 4th of July cookout, and my guests really did love this. I didn't change a thing, except I used a full cup of chopped pecans.

Made this for 4th of July and to quote my son, he said, "this is probably the best dessert that I ever made, but the messiest". The five stars is for the taste and presentation, however the graham cracker crumbs are too hard to cut through when you serve it and eat it. I then put the leftovers back in the freezer and the next night when we ate dinner, I put it in the fridge to see if the crumb layer would soften and that was a mistake because the layers started to slide due to the carmel sauce. It's definitely a great dessert and the family will ask for it often.

Absolutely 5 stars!!  I made it as written for a party last weekend and it was completely gone in minutes.  My daughter said it is now her favorite dessert (formerly her favorite was cheesecake).  I already made it a second time last night for my guests this weekend.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wow! What can I say....AMAZING!  I adapted the recipe a little for those in our family that don't like nuts.  We omitted pecans and because I didn't have any graham crackers on hand I used Nilla Wafers ground for the crust.  It's so delicious you won't want to pass this recipe up!  Thanks for the great desert new favorite in our house!

This is the easiest dessert I have ever made!  Everyone loved it!  It is sweet, but definitely not TOO sweet... everyone asked for the recipe and wanted to take some home... make this... you won't be disappointed!  I will definitely make it again and keep it on hand for unexpected guests.  Thanks!

EXTREMELY SWEET!! As prior entries indicated,this dessert is very rich,which you can control by serving small slices.However, even a small slice was very, very sweet & I only used about 4 ounces of the caramel sauce. If I make it again, I will use less condensed milk & cut all sugar levels. Very pretty presentation.

This dessert is good, but overwhelmingly rich and sweet.  Way to sweet and I used half of the caramel in the recipe! I'm not sure if I would ever make this again.  If I did, I would definitely curb the sweeetness.

Completely delicious. I made it and then froze it overnight. I brought it to work that morning at put in the fridge at 8. We ate it at 10. It was thawed enough that we could cut the crust, but got messy real fast. If left frozen, though, I think the crust wouldn't have come up at all. Next time I think I'll make it in a pie plate instead. But really, truly delicious and rich. So easy to make, too! I'll be making this a LOT in the future!

The first time I made this dessert was for a baby shower where everyone
raved over it and requested the recipe. The reaction was the same the next time 
I made it for my sister's birthday. This is definitely a keeper!  Thanks, Lorie.

This is excellent!! I recommend it to everyone!  I made it for a birthday party.  It is very very rich so it serves more than it seems.  I really love this one and will make it again and again.
