Yummy. I'm always looking for new ways to serve seafood as my husband is a pescatarian (no meat, only seafood). I thought calamari would be a real challenge, and I expected to have to make an alternative meat dish for myself and my 12-year-old son. WRONG! We all loved the dish. I didn't have cherry peppers so I just left them out since previous reviewers thought it too hot anyway...I used a little extra red pepper flakes and a little extra garlic and went liberal with the parmesan when serving. Delicious! We all really loved it. I also used gemelli instead of fettucine and it worked well. I will use it again and I will get the cherry peppers because I think it will only make it better. Thanks!

I read the previous review and decided in order to not make this recipe too hot, I'd use an orange bell pepper instead of the spicy peppers. That may have been a mistake, because I found the recipe to be very bland. The sauce was indeed very thick, pasty and not very tasty.  I also thought the recipe should call for more squid. The sauce and pasta were so overwhelming, I had forgotten that this was a calamari recipe. If I were to make it again, I'd double the squid, use 1 tbsp of starch for thickening, and keep the spicy peppers.

A popular dish even with kids! I had bought a bag of 'seafood mix' from Aldi and wasn't sure what to do with it. Had calamari, shrimp and scallops. Made this sauce to go with it although I didn't have the cherry peppers. Served with the pasta for a different and tasty dinner. Thank you!

Very nice sauce! I didnt have the peppers, so I skipped them, and I switched the basil for green onions. It was still a very nice sauce! I might try it with shrimp next time. I think the peppers sound really yummy, I just didn't have any on hand.

VERY good.  Although I'm not a "hot foods" person I enjoyed this very much.  I will make it again but will halve the peppers (just a bit too spicy for my taste), add a can of diced tomatoes (the sauce was a bit thick and I thought it may benefit from tomatoes), and double the basil (LOVE basil).  Thanks for the recipe!  Of course, a cook from Boston must be a GOOD cook!!!  (I'm from Mass, too!)

Great creamy sauce!  I substituted the cherry chilis for 3 serrano peppers as I don't have access to cherry chilis.  Used ~1/8 tsp of chili flakes and this was nicely flavoured.  I enjoy spicy food but I didn't find this to be very hot - it simply has a nice flavor with a bit of kick.  For those that prefer it milder I'd suggest just using 1 pepper (you can even remove the seeds if you're really worried) but don't completely exclude them as they are integral to the original taste of this dish.  I also used shrimp instead of calamari.

Made this sauce to go over lobster ravioli. I had Gewürztraminer on hand so used that for the wine but I think next time I will use a Chablis or a Riesling. Didn't have any heavy cream so I used fat free 1/2 and 1/2 which worked out perfectly (and kept the calories and fat to a minimum). Kept the ratio noted in the recipe and it thickened up just fine. Of course, I used 5 garlic cloves and the delicate lobster was still not overwhelmed. Perfect recipe for two!

I made this sauce with shrimp and tossed with linguini. I made it again only tossed about half the sauce with pasta and poured the rest over tilapia fillets.  The sauce was nice and tasty without over powering the seafood, this will be my new key Creamy White Wine Sauce.

Oh boy was i intimidated heading in to making this dish. We wanted to spice things up for our dinner guests last week, including our cousin’s foreign exchange student Jarnathan. Jarnathan hasn’t had cooking from his homeland in America yet and we thought Jarnathan might appreciate something a little more familiar. I’m not so queasy, but handling the squids got to me. I almost lost my lunch all over the prep counter. Not only that, i didn’t understand fully how i should cook them and ended up with a translucent center. Jarnathan seemed to gobble it up, but us Americans were coughing from the spice and chewing more than anyone should care to. Because Jarnathan enjoyed it so much though, I’m splitting with 3 stars.

It was a very easy dish to make and my first time working with Calamari.  Now I don't need to fear calamari ever again.  I really thought the only place for me to get it would be a restaurant.... super easy and good.

We liked this recipe, but I would not use 2 Tablespoons of Cornstarch.  The cornstarch made it too thick and kind of gummy.  We will make it again, but lower the cornstarch.

I didn't have cream but substituting  2 % milk worked well.  I also added tomatoes and yellow pepper when I was cooking the garlic.

This is a lovely white wine sauce.  I made it with canned tuna and linguine.  Did not have cream on hand so I used milk with the same proportions of wine and corn starch.  I also added peas at the end to bump the veggie content. Very quick and easy dinner and just enough for 2 portions.

I loved this. We're corn free so i used GF Baking powder instead of corn starch an it worked just as well. Garnish with a sprig of parslety and this is 4 star restaurant worthy! Served with caesar salad and pineapple/grapes on the side.

This recipe was amazing. I only made 2 changes. First I didn't cook the calamari until it was white before the one. That's bc it would've been over cooked. I cooked it halfway, poured in the wine and then let the calamari finish. The second change was the pepper flakes. Not a big fan so i used Cajun seasoning. Still great. Thanks for the recipe.

Didn't have cherry peppers on hand so I diced up half a green bell and sauteed with the garlic. I think I added too much red pepper flakes, I am kind of a heat-weenie too begin with but the sauce was dang near melt my face off hot. Besides the heat, the sauce was so flavorful! I will make this again but be more careful with the pepper flakes and I'm sure it will be perfect.
