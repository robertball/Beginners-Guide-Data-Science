I made a few changes and my family thinks it went from a 10 to a 20!  First, i used pizza dough to give it a true stromboli feel.  The puff pastry was good, but very delicate.  The second change was to make a true buffalo sauce (Franks, butter and lemon juice) which really kicked up the flavor and mellowed the bite of the hot sauce.  Third and final - i also added cheddar cheese.  I've made 4 of these in 1 week if that's any indication of how good it is!

Excellent & very easy. I may add mozzarella or provolone next time for a gooey filling. Served with  blue cheese.

I used biscuits and rolled them out a little, spooned in chicken mixture pinched them closed and baked in muffin tins.  They turned out really good! I also used so additional cheeses (what I had on hand) and took the advice of adding butter and lemon juice to the RedHot. Over all it was something that  I would probably make again, thanks for sharing!

I made this tonight and it was really good. I was looking for something to do with leftover Thanksgiving TURKEY. Only thing I did different was use Frank's Original Buffalo Sauce.  I would next like to try this as appetizers and think I will try with either the puff pastry shells or a less expensive version would be with Grands refrigerated canned biscuits. You put the biscuit in a muffin tin, shape it to conform to sides and fill.

As-is, the recipe gets  a 4.  With the suggestion from another site of adding celery and carrots cooked in butter, the recipe gets a 12.  I also used pizza crust (thin crust) just because that is what I've done before.

i'm only giving this 4 stars because i'm not sure if it was my mistake or the recipe.  the pastry looked beautiful.  it was golden brown and piping hot but when we cut into it the bottom layer of the pastry was a little raw.  i did put it in the oven longer but it never really cooked the way i'd like it to.  i will try this again and hopefully it will come out better.  maybe i should roll the dough a little thinner for the bottom next time

This dish was so easy to make and very very good. I recommend some dipping sauce such as more Bleu Cheese or Ranch.

Very tasty!  I served it for a card party I had, and everyone loved it.  I did have to bake it for almost an hour because the bottom was doughy.  Possibly could have been because I made it early in the day and then refrigerated it before baking?

This was awesome.  It was spicy enough, yet light enough to be add extra to our Christmas Eve appetizer feast.  It was very simple to make as well.

Not great, we made two versions. A less spicy for my mom and a spicy version for the whole family. Overall a good after football party fingerfood.

This was so easy to make- I subbed the pastry sheets for pizza dough, though, and added extra hot sauce.  The chicken was cooked in hot sauce, as well sprinkling some hot sauce on the top of the stromboli before cooking it.  It turned out amazingly well.  We will definitely be having this again!

Made this for dinner a while back, much better than the same recipe that i found by a well known chef. Also works well with bbq sauce.

This is good as a beginning recipe. (Which is a good thing!) I added red onions when I cooked my chicken. I also cooked my chicken buffalo style with some seasonings and a little hot sauce. This means I didn't have to add the 3 tablespoons of hot sauce since there was some left in the pan. I also used Filo dough since it was on sale this week and it came out fantastic with 5 sheets!

I love making this for the family. I do add a slice of provolone inside and omit the blue cheese. I also add a dallop of mayo for extra moisure.  My 3yo son does not care for the spice, so I make his with BBQ sauce and cheddar chesse. Pretty  much anything you would like in a hot pocket would work...even use pizza items, ham and cheese etc.
