Made this for my Dad, a self-proclaimed "meatloaf connoisseur", yeaterday for his birthday.  He wants me to make it for him again!  We did do one of the suggestions by another reviewer.  I substituted Mushroom Gravy mix for the Taco Seasoning and it was out of this world!!!

My family thought it was a good meatloaf as a change of pace . You could stand
to delete the taco seasoning . I added 1 packet of mushroom gravy mix to the batch.
Over all it was worth making and gave me ideas on improving my own meatloaf.

My husband is a very picky eater, and he couldn't get enough of it once he tried it... its that good.  Also, if you chop up green peppers & onions and freeze them ahead of time... it makes prep work a breeze.

In my opinion this is a great recipe for meatloaf, I added 1TBLSP of Worcestershire sauce and then when it was almost done I cut cheese slices into triangles and topped it and put it back into the oven. They all loved it, I couldn't even put some in the freezer the ate it all up.

This meatloaf is great.  Beats my mom's meatloaf hands down - no offense mom!  I've altered this recipe a bit.  I use breadcrumbs instead of the crackers and add in 1/2 cup salsa, 1 1/2 tbsp. soy sauce and salt and pepper to taste.  This is an awesome tex-mex style meatloaf, very unique!  Thanks!

Good flavor, but it fell apart. Next time I will add some eggs to hold it together. I topped it with salsa and stuck it back in the oven for a few minutes after turning it off to heat the salsa.

I am not sure it was the best meat loaf ever but it was good I will make it again but at the end I will put salsa on it.  I am going to try and use a low fat cheese I think that might cut down on the greesyness.

This was a real hit at home.  I think the cheddar and taco seasoning did the trick.  I might use a little less seasoning next time, but overall, very good!

This is probably my favorite meatloaf recipe.  We are not a big "taco" family, so I substituted Mushroom Gravy mix for the Taco Seasoning.  Even my two year old eats a second helping.

This recipe is wonderful!! I have a little one that as a rule will not eat meat. She always asks for seconds with this. I did make a couple changes. We do not like green pepper so I left them out. I also did not have any garlic cloves so I added a little garlic powder. I added two eggs to keep it together. Thanks for the recipe!

It always amazes me how many people on this site change up the recipes before trying it the original way the first time and then wonder why they don't turn out as they had hoped! As written, the recipe is very good and flavorful. However, next time I think I will add an egg or two with the hopes of binding it all together a bit more since mine pretty much fell apart when I tried to serve it, even after leaving it sit out for 10 minutes to "set".  I added a couple of tablespoons of salsa to the top during the last 15 minutes of cooking, and it added a nice zip to it (it's not necessary, it's just that I grew up with my mom's meatloaf always having ketchup on the top of it, so I guess it's just something I'm prone to do with all my meatloaf recipes) I would recommend this recipe; the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it didn't hold together when I tried to cut into it.

Loved this meatloaf! Used half pouch of seasoning as reccomended and it made it so it could be tasted, but not overbearing. Also added two eggs into the mix and some medium salsa. Also covered the top with salsa before baking. Held together nicely. Did come out super greasy, but placed it on a seving dish shortly after pulling ot from the oven, so it wasn't too bad. Kids loved it, boyfriend loved it. Not much left in the way of leftovers. Making again soon.

I am an Australian who has never eaten meatloaf in her life and I made this for my American husband...who gave it the thumbs up! Didn't have green peppers so I used red instead. I practically pureed the vegies before frying, heaven forbid my fussy 3 year old could see any hint of vegies in her meatloaf. My 11 month old son devoured it nicely. Tips for next time: replacing the taco mix for beef gravy packet mix worked well, needs a little salt and pepper, husband suggests coating the top surface with tomato paste/puree before baking or serving with a gravy to mop up his side of mashed taters! Will make again! Yay!

Excellent recipe.  One of the tastiest meat loafs I've ever made!!  I didn't make any changes to the recipe and my whole family loved it.  You have to like onions and green peppers to enoy it, but we do so that was fine!!!  YUMMY!!!

I followed the recipe exactly and we loved it!  This meatloaf has more flavor than any others I have tried.  My son has an egg allergy, so I loved that it did not contain an egg.  I had no problem with it falling apart (I did let it sit a short time before slicing).

It was alright. Nothing special. I did use 2 eggs to hold it together better, and topped with some more cheese.

Excellent. I used half the Taco mix and substituted fresh cilantro for the green pepper and lean ground turkey instead of the ground beef.

This was actually my first meatloaf and my boys loved it. I did substitute a pack of mushroom gravy mix for the taco seasoning and left out the green peppers. It was very greasy, so i have bought a draining meatloaf pan for future use. Definitely will make this again. The cheese is what makes it a hit.

I made this recipe with ground turkey, left out the butter and cheese.  It was ok, but I'm sure it tastes better as written.  I never would have thought to use taco seasoning... so thank you.

Overall, the recipe was pretty good.  It would have been better had I put half a packet of taco seasoning in instead of the whole packet.  The whole packet was kind of overwhelming for the amount of meat in there.

I was looking for something to do with a pound of hamburger and happened upon this recipe.  I made it exactly as listed and got rave reviews from my family.  The extra zip from the (low sodium) packet of taco seasoning was just perfect for my gang. I already have requests to make it again.

Definately not your traditional meatloaf. If it were called Tacoloaf I'd have given it 5 stars.
It was kind of like eating taco meat without the flour tortilla.

Excellent stuff. I found that ground turkey also works very well (internal temp to 165 degrees, too). Using other crackers with a different flavor works well, too.

No one in my family liked this meatloaf, not even my husband who loves everything I serve.  It did not hold together, was too dry, and tasted like taco meat.  I must admit, I left out the cheese to please my cheese-hating teenage son, but I can't imagine that would have helped it.  We fed the leftovers to our dog and she loved it!

Great taste, but was falling apart. Does seem to need some type of binder. Might try an egg, or two, next time.

Hubby and I liked this recipe a lot. I only added a dash of the taco seasoning though as I didn't want it to overwhelm the other flavors. It was delicious. I don't usually like meatloaf, but I'll enjoy this again!

Really was the best meatloaf ever!  I left all the ingredients in, even though my kids are picky about vegetables.  It didn't matter -- they gobbled it up!  My husband also loved it.  Nice to find a recipe that pleases everyone.  Thanks Mechelle.

Very good, could use only half a package of taco seasoning.  An egg or two wouldn't hurt either.

This meatloaf wasn't bad.Hubby and kids ate it but there was alot of grease and my oldest son asked me "why didn't you just make tacos"seems the taco flavoring is over whelming for only 1 pound of ground beef.Maybe adding another pound of ground beef to the recipe would help.

This is a great dish.  We like a lot of spice and thought this was excellent...  My son and husband both had seconds which for my son to do is proof positive.  It does create a lot of grease, so I would go for the leanest beef you can find and they didn't even notice that it had the taco seasoning in it.

My husband and I liked this recipe.  Yes, the seasoning is quite strong, but that's what separates this from all the other boring meatloaves!  We didn't included all the cheese, and it turned out well, held together and was quite moist.

My family loved this recipe for meat loaf.  They said it was the best I ever made.  I added 8 oz of a three cheese mixture instead of straight cheddar.  Loaf hold together very nicely.  Will make it again soon!

We had this tonight.  And I normally do make a few changes only because I modify with what I have on hand or try to cut down on calories.  I know people don't like that...but oh well :)  So yummy!  Didn't have crackers, so I used bread crumbs (3 tbsp).  Only used 1/2 amount of the cheese (and I used 1/2 of it IN the loaf and 1/2 on top later).  I DID add an egg since I have never had a meatloaf w/out egg.  I added just a hint of worchestershire sauce, too.  Turned out really well :)  It was like a taco w/out a shell!!  Hubby and the kids loved it!!

2 of my children are very picky eaters, but they loved this!  It was the first thing gone off of their plates.  I did slightly modify it by leaving out the sauteed onion, garlic, and peppers and instead adding a little bit of garlic powder.  This recipe is one of my new family favorites!

My boyfriend loves this variation on the traditional meatloaf.  I like it because it has all that extra flavor, and goes wonderfully with mashed potatoes and a veggie. I don't even make gravy because this is so juicy (greasy) that you can almost mix the meatloaf and potatoes and eat together.  It is greasy, but still a great dish!!!

We really liked it.  I did change a couple of things.  I didn't saute the onions and Green Peppers.  We are cutting back on unnessessary fat.  I just put them in with the meat.  I also added one egg to hold it all together.  It was a wonderful change for supper!

We tried this recipe tonight and it was great!  I had read the other ratings so I decided to try only half the taco seasoning mix but I wish I had used the whole thing.  It was delicious and the consistency was perfect.

Absolutely delicious, although it's definitely not meant as a healthy meal; be sure to drain it very, very well and use low-sodium ingredients if you're watching sodium intake. Leftover slices are great warmed up and served in tortillas with sour cream and salsa.  And yes, it really should be called a tacoloaf... still, it's very good no matter what it's called.

This is a perfect meal. I think it does take time but my family loves it. Very versatile I use ground turkey or meatloaf mix even ground chicken. I mix it up with the crackers sometimes I use whatever leftover crackers I have other times I use bread crumbs. Most of all I hide lots of vegetables in there.  I chop whatever I have on hand mushrooms, broccoli, cauliflower, carrots. I stopped sauteing the onion and pepper before adding to meat it's just another dirty pan and more time.  I know it probably changes the taste but it's my family's favorite meal so I guess it's good enough. 
Thanks for the recipe I never liked meatloaf growing up and now I enjoy it.

Pretty good-it had just the right amount of moisture - I thought it could use a little more spice though. I served it with tortilla chips and salsa and a salad.

Definitely NOT what I was hoping for.  VERY greasy, even using ground round.  Taste & texture were not pleasant.  My hubby, who eats anything, left half of his on his plate.  I would not recommend.

This was amazing! I used oat nut bread that was bigger than an average slice, I used Triscut whole wheat crackers and 90/10 lean ground beef. I skipped the optional milk. Texture and taste was awesome. The sour cream really added that something special. The oats and nuts in the bread gave it an occassional great moist and subtle kind of crunch. I will dial the pepper back 1 teaspoon or so next time, it was a bit over the top. Caramelizing the onion and garlic and then adding the salt and pepper to soak up the essential oils in the skillet really added to the flavor.
