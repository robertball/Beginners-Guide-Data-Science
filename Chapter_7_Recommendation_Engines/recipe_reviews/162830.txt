The secret to the perfect tzatziki is home made yogurt/sour cream because the real greek sour cream is much more sour than the american sour cream which is actually very mild and sweet. This recipe is good but far from being authentic! There is no feta cheese or vinegar in the original recipe...but it tastes good and the lemon and vinegar are a smart solution for the lack of sourness in the sour cream!

I loved this recipe!.....I used Fage Greek yogurt (non-fat), low fat sour cream......and made this sauce the day before I served it......The flavors and texture of the cucumber were excellent. I served this on Greek Style Garlic Chicken on this site in a whole wheat pita....hubster loved this sauce as well....Thanks 5THSISTER.....great recipe!

This is INCREDIBLE. I made this last night before bed and had it to snack on today. WOW. I just can't get enough. I did add a couple more chopped green onions. That's the only change I made. This one's going to be made a lot. It really is delicious.

Last night, I made a special trip to the grocery store for the few ingredients I didnt have for this dip. I read the other reviews and its so funny how our taste buds "read" different foods. I thought this dip was VERY tasty, and consider it a lovely addition to spring/summer parties where several fresh foods are often served. My husband thought it was a pleasant change from otherwise "heavy" dips...

Why didn't I make this sooner?  Easy and very tasty. Served with Abby Benner's Souvlaki.  I thought maybe all the good reviews were because 5th Sister is a beloved member of A/R but no it's just a really good recipe.  My only thought is that this recipe does not show up when you are searching for tzatziki sauce and some cooks might be missing it.

I made this for the first time to serve with snacks for overnight guests.  It was really yummy; my only 2 *issues* w/it were my fault (and I'm sharing so others can take my experience into consideration):  1.  it was a little runny, which I'm sure is because I used ff sour cream and yogurt...next time I'll have to decide if I'd rather have it lighter or a little thicker.  2.  I was lazy and did not further crumble my feta so there were big chunks throughout.  We all really enjoyed this; thanks for a great recipe 5thsis!  Oh, I served w/assorted crudite and pita bread.

I used greek yogurt instead of plain, red wine vinegar instead of white, and changed the oregano to dill and it was wonderful!! Also, I added extra dill and cucumbers as a personal preference. My family always loves this and there is never any left!!

Wow this is sooo much better than any tzatziki I've had at the Greek/Mediterranean restaurants in my city.  Used full fat greek yogurt instead of plain and did not strain it; lowfat regular sour cream.  Used 1/2 of a large cucumber, did not skin or de-seed it. Threw all ingredients into the blender (since I don't like cucumber chunks). Used 1/2 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp pepper. It was very liquidy/runny, which was perfect as a topping for the spinach crepes I was making.  Wow!  Usually with ethnic foods I really have to mess with the balance of ingredients to be happy with it, but this one was perfect as written!  Love it and so does the family.

I made this because most of the reviews were 5 stars. I was not disappointed! This was so good. I made it with less than 8 hours to rest (like 15 min) was still great - though after 8 it gets better and better! Served with homemade pita and falafel.

This is yummy.  Didn't use the green onions or feta cheese.  Used two cups non fat greek yogurt, omitted sour cream.   Also put hole cucumber in food processor and used it.  It's really good.

This is excellent but it needs a couple days in the fridge for the flavor to develop. I originally thought it needed a little something else but it just needed some time.

This recipe is delicious!  The only change I made was adding a teaspoon of dill to the mix.  I served it with a creamy greek chicken recipe I had found and pitas.  I am definitely making this again!

Did not have sour cream or feta.  But, it was still great!  Served with Middle Eastern Rice with Black Beans and Chickpeas.  Wow, fantastic dinner side dip!

This was excellent. I was a little skeptical because I'm a huge traditional tzatziki fan, but this really came through for me (and is surprisingly tzatziki-like!). I put everything into my food processor - including the peel on the cucumber, I don't mind it - and otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I am always afraid I'm not objective when it comes to recipes submitted by people I 'know,' so I slyly asked MrB how he would rate this one. "Five," he said, with a full mouth. Thanks for the recipe 5thSIS! :)

Tastes good already and I didn't let it chill for 8 hours yet! I omitted the oregano and feta(not a big fan of them) and I added an extra 2 tsp.of lemon juice and 1 more clove of garlic(love garlic).I will be serving this with "Souvlaki", another recipe from this site. Thank you 5THSISTER!!!

It was really good as a chip dip. I think next time I'll put it in a food processor to make it smooth. I left out the green onion and lemon zest to save money and time, respectively.

This tzatziki sauce was really delicious. I sherreded the cucumber, but next time I will make it just like Sunnybyrd suggested and put all the ingredients in the food processor, just a preference. Thanks for your recipe!

Loved it! This was very easy to make. We made it one afternoon as a dip for pita chips. It was really good! Very addictive, too. I followed the recipe exactly and found it made a generous amount. I will be using this again...maybe as a sauce for lamb?

Even after an hour of throwing this together it tastes amazing!  I can only imagine what it will taste like tomorrow.  I used nonfat Greek yogurt and low fat sour cream.  Also, just because I love it, I added 1/2 tsp dried dill.  SUPER!!

I made this last night for Gyros, and it was fantastic.  I made it as listed the night before, and the flavors melded perfectly.  Tonight we used a little of the left over sauce to dip hot wings in, and it was super yummy!  Tomorrow night we'll have pita chips to dip....there's no way I'm tossing the leftover sauce, we'll use every bit of it.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe, we'll be making often!

If I could give this 10 stars I would! Great base recipe! Use it all the time for our chicken gyros. We add a lot of additonal spices (to taste) until it tastes right. We like to add a bit of ground red pepper-yum!! Also, we love to add a decent amount of feta as well. Thank you so much for sharing! Great on gyros or just to eat with veggies.

Very Very Good! This reminds me of the cucumber sauce from my local Greek Restaurant.  We ate it on Chicken and Lamb Gyros right away and it tasted great. We also saved some and ate 8 hours later and it does taste better when the flavors blend and sit for awhile.  I also added a dash of season salt and garlic powder. This is a definite keeper.

This was good but had to add a little more flavor as it was a little bland for our tastes.  Added extra garlic, lemon juice, salt and pepper and 1/2 t dill, (the dill added a lot)  also I halved the recipe it makes way too much for 4 people.  Only used 1/2 the cucumber it was plenty...Finally I drizzled with olive oil to jazz up my fat free feta I had on hand. Didn't read to chill overnight but it was fine right away.

Thank you 5THSISTER for sharing such a nice and easy dip! Used Greek yogurt, blended everything up (kids aren't fans of chunks), and added some dill to garnish. Great way to eat veggies and made a wonderful lunch.

My family and I loved this sauce.  I substituted the cup of sour cream for another cup of plain Greek yogurt. It was delicious and guilt-fee.  I served it over grilled chicken in a whole wheat pita.  We topped it with additional cucumbers, tomatoes, and green onions...Yum.

I made a varied version of this recipe for my daughter's "Culture Day" at school  and it came out well. I used a 5.3 oz. cup of plain Greek yogurt,  1 c. sour cream, omitted the vinegar, lemon juice, onion, garlic and feta cheese and substituted 2 tsp. Mrs. Dash garlic & herb seasoning.  I liked the taste and will make it agin.

To be honest, I was a little bit wary of this recipe because I hate feta cheese. Boy, I wish I'd tried it sooner! This dip is AMAZING! The only problem I had with it was that it is a bit runny, probably because if the yogurt. That won't stop me from making this again and again, though! Thanks so much, 5thsister, for sharing this yummy recipe!!!

I didn't want to wait too long since this smelled so good, so to thicken it, I used a whole container (8oz?) of crumbled feta cheese. I mixed everything in the blender to give it a consistent texture, and it really does age well. Not good for those who don't like a strong cheese taste, but that's my error since I added so much! This is a keeper; thanks for the recipe, 5thsister! See you on the Exchange!

This was very good.  e hd it with oven toasted pita wedges alongside Souvlaki from this site.   Next time I will add an extra clove of garlic but all in all very good.  Thanks for the recipe.  I just polished off the rest with some Ruffles and I have to say, three days later it is so much more flavorful.  Will make again.

This is a great sauce that you can play with for different recipes.  I added dill and used it with the feta and turkey burgers.  If you add some taco sauce to the sauce (w/out dill) it can be a great fish taco sauce. Thank you for sharing this great recipe with us!

FANTASTIC!!!  I would give this more than 5 stars if I could.  I followed the directions but I did use nonfat yogurt and lowfat sour cream and freshly ground black pepper.  As suggested, I let it sit overnight.  WOW!! This stuff is good.  The hubby raved.  I served this over Greek Chicken from this site and also with focaccia sticks.  I will be making this again and again. Thanks for sharing this 5THSISTER!

This was fantastic for us.  We had it with my own recipes for Souvlaki and Greek Fries one night, then I polished off nearly the rest of it with just lightly toasted pita bread the next day. It was even better by the 3rd day when I finished it. :) I grated my cucumber and loved the texture that made, so will probably do that every time. This will be made over and over. Thanks sis! :)

thanks fifth sister for such a yummy and healthy dip. i made this w/ fat free plain yogurt and lowfat sour cream. i didnt think the lemon zest was overpowering at all.(whoever said that must have gotten too much pith from the lemon in it). i did have to add an extra clove of garlic but it was my fault for not wanting to wait the 8 hours for the flavors to intensify. i made this to go w/ easy pita chips from this site. thanks for a new healthy snack that im totally addicted to!

This was good sauce and easy, too.  I think I will play with adding a little more spices next time, and a little more salt next time (I only added a pinch).  It was good on my chicken gyros, and with pita chips!

The feta cheese was a great idea in this recipe!  The only thing I added was one teaspoon dried dill ... but I'm a dill nut.

I wanted to like this recipe but I don't. I prefer my sauce with dill or mint as opposed to oregano....Greek yogurt - no sour cream and omit the Feta cheese but use it on the gyro.

I was guesstimating the measurements and may have used a tad too much feta. I omitted the oregano and used fresh dill & mint. Used white pepper not black, didn't skin or seed the cucumbers, then threw it all in a blender.   Last recipe I tried suggested cumin, coriander and oregano and that was awful. Liked this one much better

This recipe is so easy to make and the flavor is superb! My wife and I were craving gyro's, but alas, all we had was naan, thin sliced sirloin tip roast, and all the ingredients for the cucumber sauce. Thank goodness for Greek seasoning. I sprinkled some on the roast beef, heated it up along with the naan, and made our own version of gyros. Plus, we've been eating on salads, with homemade hummus,  butter chicken, and curries. It keeps very well too.

There are so many Tzatziki sauce recipes on here.  How can you choose?  I picked this one because of the word easy.  I am not Greek so I.don't know how authentic it is but making homemade yogurt does not appeal to me.  This was fast, easy and my family of picky eaters loved it and asked for more.

Really good recipe as is or to modify based on what you have on hand.   I didn't have cucumber or mint so I used a little dill and it was excellent.  Next day I added the cucumber and mint and it was even better!!

Made this sauce to have on our chicken flatbread sandwiches. Absolutely delicious! I didn't have green onion so substituted with red onion. I also didn't put the feta in the sauce. We added the feta separately as my husband is a bigger fan of feta than I am. Best sauce ever!

Very happy with this recipe.  I made very minor tweaks to the recipe.  I added a little more garlic - love my garlic, a little more lemon zest, and dried dill - basically all to taste.  Make this ahead to get the fullest flavor.  Excellent for veggies or chicken gyros - don't eat red meat so haven't tried it with a red meat.

Delicious! I personally don't care for the taste of onions,  so I took the green onion out. I also added extra feta cheese because I love it! I serve mine with cooked chicken that I marinated over night, tomato, lettuce,  and olives on warm pita! You can also make it into a salad! Everyone loves it!

I had to change the vinegar to 1 Tbsp. & lemon juice to 2 tsp. (just WAY too sweet!) Otherwise, nice flavors and a good starting point.

Loved this one and it tasted like my favorite Greek restaurants sauce. I have no idea if its authentic or not, but was what I was looking for. I did make some changes. 1. Since we were having Greek salad with Feta, I eliminated the Feta and probably wont add it ever. 2. I used a English cucumber and grated it. 3. I added some dill

EXCELLENT!!!!  I have made several different tzatzitki type sauces and by far this is the best one I have found.  I marinated chicken & used this sauce...we loved it!  It tasted better day 2 and 3 too.  I ended up using about 3/4 greek yogurt (that was all I had) and 1/4 sour cream (all I had left) and it still turned out really good.

Good recipe that I have made a couple of times.  I made it last night to serve with the Kofta Kebabs and it was excellent.  I added a second clove of garlic and did not have a cucumber so I just skipped it.  Personally, I prefer the consistency without the cucumber which tends to make it watery.  Really good authentic flavor, cucumber or not!

My wife just made this for me and it knocked my socks off... I love greek food and this was better than a local Greek restaurant gyro. I told her to take a few over to our neighbors so she can get more credit for this fantastic meal. A+++++

Everyone in my family loved this sauce, children and adults.  Also, this recipe was simple enough for my 12 year old, a beginner cook, to make.

Not authentic,... an improvement over authentic imo.  I have tried out different greek sauces and this is really fun with the feta in it.  
Things I did different because we like a bolder sauce: used greek yogurt instead of regular, two cloves of garlic, all the juice from a a small lemon, lots of chives from the garden instead of reg green onions.  Also to make it less watery salting the cucumbers and draining and squeezing them to release as much water as possible.

awesome...

This was my first time trying tzatziki sauce, but wow, it definitely won't be my last!  It also makes a great substitution for blue cheese salad dressing!

This recipe truly is very easy.  The hardest part about it was chopping up the cucumber.  I did a coarser mincing with my cucumber because I like my tzatziki a little chunky.  I really feel like this sauce is great without the feta.  I chowed down with some Indian Chapati bread.  Delish!  Thank you 5THSISTER!

I had been searching and experimenting to make  a really delicious cucumber yogurt... this one is exactly what I wanted.  It was delicious and tasty and a perfect summer snack with warm whole wheat pita bread.  I also made this once for dinner with two recipes from this site: Mediterranean Chicken and Spinach and Rice (Spanakorizo) with some hummus as well...it was Greek night at my house and everyone loved it!  The yogurt paired perfectly with the other two recipes and hummus on the side...Yum!! =0P..

Yummmy very close to a hometown favorite! The only reason I gave 4 stars is b/c i didn't put feta in it, I thought it was good w/o it.

It doesn't matter to me if this is "authentic" or not, it's definitely worthy of 5 stars="the Best!"  How do I know??  'Cuz I keep raiding the fridge to sneak a sample!  At this rate, I'm going to have to make it again verrrry soon!  Thank you for posting this recipe!

This sauce just keeps getting better and better as it sits in the frig.  Although we had it eaten in a week, each day was more flavorful.  It was great on tortillas with lettuce, tomato, black olives, feta cheese, garbanzo beans, and Vlasic pepper rings.  My two teenage daughters loved it as wraps in their lunches.

Pretty good. I liked the taste of the feta in this sauce so next time i will add extra. Served this on top of 'Grilled Spicy Lamb Burgers'. I still have a ton of left overs so this sauce will also be served with 'garlic pita bread bites'
