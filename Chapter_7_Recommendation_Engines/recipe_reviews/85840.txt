I love the peach mixture in this---the taste was a little sweetened vs. a little tart. However, the dough on top was a bit like thick pie crust, and I thought it could have been a little sweeter. I even gave it a generous sprinkling of powdered sugar. I had never even heard of pandowdy before until I was watching High School Musical and the basketball guy who bakes has a line that he makes apple pandowdy (amoung other things). So I naturally came to AR and found this recipe...its almost a cobbler, but not quite...hence the pie crust top. Thanks for the post! PS Baked in a cast iron pan because another person I was talking to about it said a long time ago they were baked in dutch ovens.

Simple and fantastic!!!  The top is a tender, soft and sweet biscuit like rolled dough.  The filling is just heavenly with only four ingredients.  This is a true Southern classic peach dessert.  Be sure to bake this up in a cast iron skillet if you have one.

I love this recipe and have been making it for years, but never thought to make it in a cast-iron pan. The perfect complement is home-churned ice cream.  It isn't meant to be a pie at all, so don't look for a pie-crust type top. Glad you all are enjoying it as much as our family always has.

I had some perfectly ripe peaches to use up, and my search led me to this.  Very easy to put together, even for me, and I am not exactly known for my crusts (well, not known in the good sense of the word anyways!).  This is a scrumptious treat- I found the sweetness of the peaches was nicely offset by the not overly sweet crust...my boyfriend thought the crust could have used more sugar, or maybe some cinnamon sugar sprinkled on top.  Overall, it was a big hit and was quickly devoured.  Thanks for a great recipe :)

Crust came out all wrong.  It was more like a very dense cobbler.  I was thinking I'd get a pie crust like topping, I may alter this until I get that.  Good if you're in a hurry though.

Wow. I stirred until my arm was aching and even had someone help stir... How in the world are you supposed to roll out that sticky mess?  I had to add WAY more flour to even get it to a consistency that could begin to be placed on the counter, let alone "rolled" out.  And then more flour had to be added to keep it from sticking to EVERYTHING that touched it. What a mess. Either I blew it BIG time or this recipe needs proofreading!
