I made 2 of these pies at the same time, one for me and one for a pot luck. It took me more like 55 min in the oven (it may have been my crust tho). On one I only added 1 teaspoon ground nutmeg and that one turned out better. The one with 2 teaspoons of nutmeg was WAY to much for my taste. The pie was a total hit and I got lots of complements!

Very good, I tried it but only had two berries to put into it and that may be part of the reason it came out a little watery and it became more of a cobbler. However, it was still delicious and I am looking forward to adding the third berry and trying again.

I didn't care for the banana with the berries. I was to over powering and took away from the berries.

To be fair, I did make some substitutions, but this recipe didn’t go over very well in my house. If I were to try it again I’d save the bananas for banana bread!!! It was fun to try something different, though.

I just have to say, I loved the idea of adding banana into a berry pie!  And I loved the nutmeg too!  I only gave it 4 stars b/c I didn't follow the recipe exactly.  I used frozen berries, and only 1 large banana; I used about half the sugar and I didn't have wheat gluten so I used cornstarch (probably not enough b/c it ended up soupy...but still yummy).  Also, I only had 1 crust, so I just served with whipped cream on top - it was DELISH!  I think next time I'll do it the same way but add walnuts on top before baking...just to add a little crunch.

Substituted more berries for the bananas....big mistake! Ended up with a very wet pie that didn't look good at all. Also, I'd cut back on the nutmeg...kind of overpowered the taste of the fresh berries.

Very good pie!  I don't usually make this kind of pie, but I had fruit to use up so decided to try this recipe. I reduced the nutmeg to 1 tsp. as I'm not a big fan of nutmeg.  The family ate almost the whole pie in one night!  Went well with vanilla ice cream.
