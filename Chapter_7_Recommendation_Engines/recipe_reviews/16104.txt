I make this all the time for my family when I have leftover roast chicken. I use the following substitutions:  Peanut oil instead of vegetable oil, leftover roast chicken instead of canned chicken and toasted sesame seeds instead of almonds with a little sesame oil sprinkled on to taste.  Everyone always raves about it.

First off, using pre-shredded cabbage and a bag of salad mix saved me a lot of time!

I made the recipe following the directions but omitted the cilantro because I didn't have any on hand.  When I tasted it, it was a very savory taste as opposed to a sweet and sour taste you would expect.  I sprinkled sugar over it and kept mixing it in until it tasted the way I liked it.  It worked very well.

Some reviewers have commented that it is too oily.  I used a large bag of cabbage and a small bag of salad mix.  It was not oily at all this way.  IF you are afraid it might be too oily for you, add a little dressing at a time to suit your taste.

Overall, a tasty and easy salad!

P.S.  So I'm eating this salad and thinking to myself, "Gee, I wonder if adding mandarine oranges would be good?".  So I frantically look through the cupboard for oranges and to my dismay there are none.  However, there is a can of pineapple.  So I added a whole can plus some juice, and wow!  This is now a FIVE STAR SALAD!!!

Excellent recipe.  I tried it for the first time at my first office potluck for Valentine's Day and everyone who tried it absolutely loved it.  I used red cabbage for more color and I added a can of drained water chestnuts because I had it in the cupboard.

This recipe turned out very well.  I used only 1/2 cup of vegetable oil along with 1/4 cup sesame oil to give it a more oriental flavor.  I also tossed in some toasted sesame seeds.

Great tasting salad!!  I used leftover grilled chicken instead of canned and added 2 tsp of sesame oil to the dressing.  I did not have any cilantro or almonds so I substituted unsalted peanuts  YES peanuts and it was wonderful.  The taste and textures are very satisfying. I served it with individual plates of seasonal fruit and got rave reviews.  My 4 year old ate it and that is saying alot..  Even better the next day even though there was only 1 small serving left...  TRY THIS

I made this recipe for me and my husband and we both loved it.  I didn't add the onions or cilantro.  I substituted the canned chicken for cooked and cubed skinless boneless chicken breast.  I added some chow mein noodles and it was great!

It was okay. I would have preferred a sweeter dressing as well. The dressing was just okay, on the bland side. I added canned mandarins to wake up the flavor along with some chow mein noodles to give it a crunch. Was pretty good but I've tried other chinese salads that had more of an oriental flavor.

Lots of chopping, but I guess that's to be expected.  The dressing separates but the flavor was great.

I was not crazy about this recipe.  The dressing is on the bland and oily side and it needs some tweaking.  I tried adding a little sugar to it but it didnt work.  I will try another recipe.

Talk about Yummy.  I took this to a church picnic and it was gone in a flash!  I already had a prepared Chinese Chicken Salad dressing, so I used about a cup of that and added the soy sauce and flavor packets to that, then followed the directions to prepare it.  It was great.  Instead of using a head of cabbage, I used a prepared coleslaw bag, which also had slivered carrots and red cabbage in it.  My husband wanted a little more snap so I threw in some snow peas, sliced in about thirds, and some chopped up celery.  I used Romaine lettuce instead of Iceberg.  Instead of regular almonds I used a salad topper roasted almonds packet.  It was so easy and delicious, I had people asking for the recipe left and right.

My family loves this for a change of pace because they can graze on it all evening. I make it even easier by using a bag of coleslaw mix from the produce department. It's cabbage and red cabbage with a touch of carrot. I usually use leftover roasted chicken or whatever I had in the house. This time it happened to be leftover turkey. I substituted with turkey and nobody even noticed! I also used peanut and sesame oil and slightly less. I added toasted sesame seeds too. To the dressing, I added a touch of ginger.

This recipe was really good after a few tweaks. I felt the dressing needed some sweetness so I added some Stevia. I used fresh grilled chicken breasts and added mandarin oranges. For convenience, I used pre packaged cole slaw mix and shreaded romaine hearts for the lettuce.

This is really good!  I've never had Chinese Chicken Salad.  I tweaked it a bit and used only a 1 lb package of coleslaw mix, no lettuce.  Because of the decrease in greens, I cut back to 2 packages ramen and for the dressing cut back on the vegetable oil to 3 T plus 1 T sesame oil and the 1 T soy sauce and the 2 seasoning packets.  I also used leftover roasted chicken, but other than that followed the recipe.  The resulting salad was a tad on the salty side (next time I will try cutting back on the vinegar by a tablespoon as seasoned rice vinegar is quite salty I found), but other than that it is PERFECT!  Exactly what I hoped for.  The flavors and textures of everything work together great.  I think it would have been too oily with a whole 3/4 C oil though, even with the additional noodles and lettuce.  In the future I will experiment with adding some canned mandarins or pineapple like others have done.  Yummy!  Can't wait to have this for lunch the next couple days.

Yummy salad, although the dressing was a little more oily than I like.  The second time I made this salad, I cut the oil in half, and increased the rice vinegar to 3/8 cup and increased the soy sauce to 1/4 cup (used light soy sauce).  Liked it much better the second time.  Also added water chestnuts.  I slivered a can of sliced water chestnuts.  Liked the addition to the salad.  Will be making this salad often!

I use this recipe a lot. Instead of the cabbage and lettuce, I substitute 2 bags of broccoli slaw, a couple of shredded carrots and a bag of snow pea pods.  I will also add some water chestnuts, bean sprouts and a cup of cashews. I use freshly cooked diced chicken breast to cut back a little on the sodium. Another substitution is using olive oil for a better oil since there is high cholesterol and high blood pressure in the family.

The dressing was pretty strong, I diluted it with pineapple juice and it was good.  We got lots of compliments.  Not all ramen noodles have their seasoning pack separage,  so watch this when purchasing ramen noodle packs.

My husband and I loved it--great flavors and very healthy with all the veggies. As other reviewers suggested,  I did have to adjust the dressing by adding additional sugar and emulsifying  it in the blender after cooking on the stove.  Since there are just two of us I adjusted the greens by using  a half of a head of iceberg and about 1/3 head of Savoy cabbage. For additional color and texture I added sliced water chestnuts, a large raw shredded carrot and some chow mein noodles.  Thank you for this great recipe.

Super yummy! I added more cilantro because I can't get enough of it. I also added mandarin oranges (1can) I wish I would have had 2. I also used 1 bag of Cole slaw and 1 bad of ice berg lettuce to cut down on prep time. I also added the ramen noodles in with the salad dressing while it was on the stove to soften the noodles just a little bit. Turned out soft but slightly crunchy!

I cooked the chicken and shredded it instead of using canned chicken. I also left out the cilantro. I had to add sugar and peanut butter in the sauce to cut down on the vinegar taste. I used chopped peanuts instead of almonds because every Chinese chicken salad we've ever had used peanuts. It turned out much better. We used chow mein noodles on the side instead of using the ramen noodles. I have tried to use the Chinese noodles before and this way, if there are leftovers, the noodles aren't soggy the second time around. 
Good Luck

This Is a good salad. I followed the recipe for the most part. The variations that I made were: baked chicken ( we grow our own so I baked a whole chicken then just cut off all of the meat and chopped it up I only used half of it), dressing-I used a little over a half of a cup canola oil and 1/8 of a cup of sesame oil. II also reduced the amount of ramen season to 2 packets and added 3/4 tsp of sugar. To the salad I added a diced lemon cucumber and some cherry tomatoes. 
My whole family liked this salad!

Great salad!  I really enjoyed this.  I made my own chicken on the stove.  I just quickly cooked it in the pan.  I added some salt to the salad dressing.

Fantastic starting point. I made a couple tweaks. I reduced the vegetable oil and will use olive oil next time. I add a couple tablespoons of sesame oil. I used grilled chicken breasts that were marinated in soy sauce, garlic, citrus juice, and wine. With those changes, this recipe is a keeper!
