This recipe tastes just like the cookies my grandmother made. We called them pierniki. I've tried several other recipes and they just weren't right. These have the same texture and flavor I remember. My grandmother used lard. I used half crisco and butter. I am thrilled to have found this truly polish cookie. They are delicious and are my favorite Christmas cookie! Thanks Darlene!

I am not much for rolling and cutting out dough so we shaped the dough into a nice thick log, wrapped it in waxed paper and sliced the dough 1/4" thick, sprinkled candy cake decorations on top as you would a sugar cookie and baked them for 8-9 minutes.  My guys loved them as they weren't too sweet and still had a nice flavor.

I haved searched for many years for the perfect cut-out cookie-and this is it! The dough was very easy to work with,(I rolled it between two sheets of waxed paper), and the cookies were a wonderful texture. It reminded me of the Polish bakery cookies we would buy when I was a child. I added anise extract to the frosting, too....my family loved them. this is a keeper!

These cookies are wonderful!  Just like we had when we were kids.  I made half of the recipe and it was plenty.  We frosted them with cream cheese frosting and added sugar sprinkles.  Glad to have refound this recipe.

This recipe is very close to my grandmother's, which I remember as a shortening-stained newspaper clipping.  I substituted lard for the fats, as my grandmother did, and moistened the scraps with sour cream.  Frosted and decorated, these are the epitome of Christmas for my family.  Double or even triple the recipe - they make wonderful gifts, and everyone raves!

I made this recipe exactly as stated and didn't need to add anymore flour. Also, 1/2 ounce extract equals 3 teaspoons. I refrigerated the dough for one half hour.
I made this recipe into 36 large round cookies about 1/4 inch thick. This recipe is fantastic and tastes yummy when topped with sugar cookie icing.
Brings back memories of the old Polish bakeries of Buffalo when I was a kid.
Thanks so much Diane for sharing it.

Very good cookies... The recipe makes a LOT of cookies so we cut it in half and it was just fine.  We sprinkled them with colored sugar before baking to give them a little "Christmas sparkle" and they baked up beautiful.  I will add this to my yearly holiday cookie baking

These have a great flavor, and hold their shape well for decorating.  Also, the dough is easy to roll and cut.  My husband's family is polish, and I wanted to make them a polish christmas cookie for the holidays.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

My Polish family LOVED this recipe!!! Truly traditional recipe, tasted just like the Polish Pierniki my great-grandmother used to make! Some of the littles in my family aren't fond of too much anise, so I used a 2:1 ratio of anise and vanilla (2 tsp. anise and 1 tsp. vanilla, since  1/2 ounce = 3 tsp).  I used all 7.5 cups of flour, but will try just 7 c. next time, as it crumbled ever so slightly when rolling the dough, even after letting it warm up out of the frig.  Also - BE SURE NOT TO OVERCOOK THESE!! Ours were done in 10 minutes. They should be very light/pale in color, with no brown edges or bottoms. OVERALL, GREAT RECIPE!!!    

*BUTTERCREAM FROSTING RECIPE I USED:
6 c. powdered sugar, sifted --
2/3 c. real butter, softened --
2 tsp. vanilla --
1 tsp. anise --
3 Tbsp. milk --

Cream sugar and butter w/ hand mixer until smooth and paste-like, then stir in extracts and milk. Beat until creamy, but thick. So good!!

I don't have a Polish heritage or tradition of eating these cookies, but we will have one from now on.  I took a sniff of the anise extract and almost said, "no way."  I'm so glad I didn't!  I didn't change anything, other than to reduce the anise extract to 1/2 to 1 tsp. instead of 1/2 oz. (1 tablespoon) called for.  The anise flavor was still there, but much more subtle and absolutely delicious.  The cookies rolled and cut perfectly.  I will make these again.

My parents came from Poland and this is the first time I have heard or tasted this cookie.  The cookies turned out well and are easy to roll, I just found the anise taste a bit to overwhelming !

I was looking for an alternative to the regular Christmas cookies I make every year and these were perfect. These can be decorated like a regular sugar cookie, but they have a special flavor. They were delicious!

Nothing special here.  Just plain sugar cookies, really.  And I'm not into all the decorating.  I prefer "drop" cookies

Yum! I loved these, my family loved these, my neighbors' kids  who are picky eaters loved these... They have a delicious hint of licorice in them, but are still very like sugar cookies. I noticed that this recipe makes a lot of dough, which is good because I could make a few dozen, save the rest of the dough, and make more without much prep! I do roll them quite thinly, though. Anyway, they're great cookies. Thank you, Darlene!

I was looking for a different cut-out cookie type and being half Polish and all, this seemed like a great choice. They turned out really well, and the anise was a really nice flavour addition. I made half the recipe because it was way more than we needed. I couldn't get the anise oil soon enough so I ground some star anise into powder and used about half a teaspoon in place of the oil. They cut well, baked well, and iced really well too. I'll make these again.

Awesome cookie.  Great taste and texture.  Crunchy not soft, just how I like them.
