Three stars because it did say "Basic", start from here & add, add, add!  Use spicy V8, add Worcestershire & hot pepper sauces, celery salt, pepper, & garnishes as in green olives, cocktail onions and so on.....Spice it up baby!!

ewww.  Lot's of doctoring up needed for this one.  You're better off buying a mix and adding vodka.

You have got to be kidding! Where's the horseradish, tabasco, lime juice, and black pepper? And no garnish? Celery, green olives, limes? Where's the creativity?

I am so laughing at the low rating for this recipe.  It's perfect for when you're hung over.  And you can modify it to suit your taste.

This recipe would have been much better with Motts Clamato juice, and a some seasoning salt along the rim. These just didn't cut it. Sorry

Yes VERY basic/bland....add Tabasco (NOT Franks or other less quality hot sauces which have too much vinegar/salt) a bit of sat & pepper, celery seed, Worcester sauce. A stalk of celery dresses  it up also. Spicy V8 is best as is Clamato as a change of pace.

Basic says it all. But really, this is not a bloody mary. This is tomato cocktail with vodka. Bloody mary's are flavorful and so good they're hard to drink slowly;) 

On the plus side, The comment section is cracking me up with people sharing their bloody mary recipes LOL

Unfortunately, bland. Needs spicing up , but not un-drinkable by any means.
