No I did not change it I followed the recipe the first time. Got to say that  I'm not a veggie but I have to say it was very nice.    I will be making it again I even stuffed the veggie Saugsage mix into skins and I have say they turned out really well. I made them into six packs and sold them at a bring and buy sale at the local  school. I have been asked for the recipe by quite few people. I have even put fresh mint in them. I'm a sucker for fresh mint and I have to say it turned out really nice as well.  Dont be afraid to play around with different herbs.
