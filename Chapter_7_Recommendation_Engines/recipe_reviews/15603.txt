My niece said, "this is better than Marie Calendars." Everyone loved this pie. I added 1/2 of a small banana to the pudding mixture for flavor (not the whole banana, because you don't want to "over-kill" the flavor). It was perfect!  I used the small 1 ounce boxes of pudding and it was a perfect amount for one pie. I think because I used the marie calendar pie pans and they are smaller than 9 inches. I noticed that a some people had extra pudding and I think it's because it depends on the size of the pie pan used. Ok for member SENORITA132, you said the pie was too watery... the recipe says to "whisk" the pudding, but I would suggest using a mixer and beat it until it's nice and thick. It worked for me this way rather than using a whisk. Also, thank you to BAVERDUCE for your suggestion about dipping the bananas in lemon juice so that they don't brown. It really works!

Excellent pie, very easy.  I took the advice of some previous reviewers and used banana and french vanilla pudding mixes. DEFINATELY go with a ready-made crust like graham cracker, vanilla wafer or chocolate.

Instead of layering banana slices, I blended them with some lemon juice to prevent browning, and then folded them into the pudding. This is just a personal preference. For the pudding, I used about 1.5 cups of milk to compensate for the bananas being mixed in. I made a graham crust, and put a layer of semi-sweet chocolate (melted in a double boiler) on the bottom. I sprinkled some graham crumbs on the top of the whipped cream (of which I used only about 1 cup).

Alot of people have said that they had way too much filling for one pie. Perhaps you are making the pudding according to the package directions instead of the recipe? Doing so will get you about 1 more cup of filling and it will not be as firm.

Good and easy.  Filling seems like too much and spills out, BUT... Before pouring it into the pie shell, try letting the filling set in the bowl in the refrigerator for about 5 minutes to let it "set up" a little.  This way you can "mound" it into the pie, and you will definitely use it all.

Nice pies!  I followed other reviewers advice and made 2 small pies with a vanilla wafer crust.  I used 1 box banana cream and one vanilla pudding.  I also found you don't really need the full 2 cups of whipped cream either.

YUM!  I use a graham cracker crust, also only one pack of pudding and an 8oz container of whipped topping.  To make it a less guilty treat, I use sugar-free pudding, non-fat milk, and fat free whipped topping.  You don't even miss the sugar and fat!

I used one french vanilla and one banana cream pudding mix.  This pie turned out excellent! It was so easy to prepare. I actually had enough for 2 pies. So I took one over to my in-laws. My father-in-law had 3 slices! I will definately be making this again.

Excellent. I used 1 box french vanilla & 1/2 box banana pudding.  Instead of lining pie crust, I folded banannas into the pudding once it had set (5-10min).  I did not top with whip cream, instead just let everybody do it themselves when they take a piece of pie..much easier to cut and serve this was.  [Also, Marie Callander's frozen pie crust was terrific!]

This is a very easy pie to make.  As other reviewers suggested, I used 1 box of banana and 1 of vanilla for the pudding. I also made a traditional pie crust from scratch.  My picky son that normally won't eat pie, loved it.  I still prefer to make banana cream pie from scratch, but this will work in a pinch!

I absolutely loved this pie!  I read the reviews before I made it and made some changes according to what others said.  I used 1 box of Instant Vanilla and 1 box of Instant Banana Cream pudding for the filling.  I also sliced some fresh bananas and added it to the filling.  I know that others have expressed disappointment over the banana slices turning brown...here's a fix for that.  After you slice the banana, dip it in lemon juice before putting on the bottom of the pie crust.  Trust me, your banana won't taste like lemon.  And...your bananas will not turn brown.  Whenever I make a fruit salad, I always dip the banana pieces in lemon juice and they never turn brown.  Try it, it really works!
Other than those few changes, I kept the recipe the same...I used a store bought regular crust, but next time I will either make or buy a graham cracker one...I think it would be much tastier with graham cracker!  All and all, I loved it and my family loved it.  Very easy and quick to make.  I will definitely make this one again and again.

This was the best banana cream pie ever! My daughter and I loved it. I used 1 pack of banana pudding and 1 pack of vanilla. I also used a graham crust (lazy) and it was great. I highly recommend this pie to anyone.

Delicious and easy!  After I cooked the pie crust, I warmed up a little bit of peanut butter and spread it on the bottom of the pie crust.  I put the pie crust in the freezer to harden a bit and then continued on with the recipe from there.

Quick recipe.  Good taste but next time I'd use real whipping cream instead of Cool Whip which gives recipes a generic taste, in my opinion.

Such a simple and good recipe.  Very easy to modify and only need to have a few things on hand.  A good homemade crust makes it much better than the pre-bought ones.

I always use 1/2 bannana & 1/2 vanilla pudding.  This time around I used the cook & serve pudding.  I bought the 4.6 oz packet of each, used only 1/2 of each packet (the other half I mix together in a ziplock and have it on hand to make another pie) and used 1.5 cups of milk, then added the cool whip to the warm mixture and poured it immediatly in the pie crust over the bannanas.

For the pie crust I like the recipe Graham Cracker Crust III (I use honey graham crackers, not cinnamon)

Yum.  This is such a cute recipe.  I used one vanilla and one banana pudding mix as some suggested, but I think it had too much of a "artificial-banana" taste.  Next time I'll try two boxes of vanilla like the recipe calls for and see how that turns out.  ^_^.  *thumbs up*

This recipe was fine but really nothing special.  I don't think I would make again.  It seemed more like a banana pudding pie than a banana cream pie.

My family's favorite pie is a quick summer variation of this. Instead of bananas, try lemon pudding mix and raspberries!

Wonderful.  I made a couple of changes:  Instead of using all vanilla pudding, I used 1 box of vanilla and 1 box of banana cream.  I also mashed one extra banana to mix into the filling (I was making this pie for my mum's b'day, and she's always complaining that the banana cream pies she's had lately didn't have an intense enough banana flavor, thusly, the changes).  I also used a ready-made graham crust.  I garnished with the rest of the whipped topping, and then some, the sliced banana and a few graham cracker crumbs.  Mum loved the pie and was very appreciative.  Thanks for a great recipe.  I'm sure it would have been just fine for me had I prepared it as it was written.

OH MY GOD!!  I made this for thanksgiving using some of the varations suggested.  I used french vanilla and banana cream pudding, I used home made whipped cream and I topped with sliced almonds and drizzeled with chocolate.  This pie was MUCH better than the bakery ones we usually bie.  Even people who didn't really care for cream  pies loved it and every one at work wants the recipe.. Thanks for the great recipe

I have been making this recipe for my family for a long time.  It is amazing how much banana flavor comes from this pie even though you might not think it will.  It is quick and easy to make and as long as you like bananas you will love this recipe!

I made this with a grahm cracker crust (at the request of my husband) and it was ok. He and our other guests loved it, but I think I will try the traditional recipe next (egg yolks and sweetened cond. milk). There is definitely too much filling for one pie, so I made two!

This was a very good recipe and really quite easy.  It did fill two pie shells instead of the one it suggested.  Just make sure you grab instant pudding mix at the store!  I grabbed cook and serve by mistake and I had to make a quick run before my company showed up!  Quite an adventure!

I followed one reviewer's advice and dipped my banana slices in lemon juice.  I only had one big box of cook and serve and evaporated, but it worked just fine.  After placing slices on top of cool whip, I went and put reddi whip in open spaces... looked good and was requested for a repeat.

I used a nilla wafer crust and I think it complemented the pie. I was going for a more traditional cream pie taste so I stuck with the vanilla pudding mix and hoped it would taste a little more custardy. I didn't have a problem with their being too much filling. I would say, while a nice, easy, and tasty dessert, it's still just a banana pudding dressed up in the shape of a pie. DEFINITELY coat your bananas in lemon juice so they do not brown or get slimy. For these, I soaked them for like a minute in a lemon juice / water mixture, then let them dry just a bit before laying them on the crust.

I made this for my husbands birthday and he loved it.  It was a last minute decision as to what he wanted so I had to improvise on a a couple of things...I did not have a pie crust so I used the crushed graham cracker crumbs (mixed with melted butter), layered 1 1/2 of the bananas (sliced) on the bottom and the mashed the remaining and put it in the pudding/whip cream mixture (which was probably way more than the 1/2 cup called for).  Then everyone used the amount of whip cream they wanted on their indivudual servings.

I was surprised how yummy this turned out! First cream pie I've made and I'll definitely make again. I had to make it in a rush and this was super quick. I used homemade crust. Make sure you use RIPE bananas. Per suggestions, I used 1 pkg vanilla and 1pkg sugar free/non fat banana cream (because that's all the store had), a smidge less milk, and used an electic mixer to thicken which it did FAST! (I freaked out a little because the nonfat instant pudding is only 0.9oz and not 3 oz like the recipe calls for - these are equivalent!! Don't go out and buy 3 pkts of the nonfat stuff! Lucky I got wise before I made a mad dash to the store.)I also mashed up the ripest banana that I had and folded it into the mix before the whip cream. That gave it a great texture. I added the whip cream topping and bananas and THEN chilled. Which worked out just fine. Thanks to the people who suggested mixing the bananas in lemon juice to keep it from browning - it worked and made for a beautiful presentation! It was delicious!!!

I also used one vanilla pudding and one banana pudding, this is delicious!  I can't believe how easy it is to make this pie!  All of the ingredients cost me only about $5.00.

This was great. I made it for my dad's birthday, because I was short on time and it is so quick and easy. I made it with a store-bought Nabisco graham cracker crust, and used french vanilla and banana creme puddings, and lite cool whip. I used 4 giant bananas, and layered them on the bottom as well as halfway through the pudding mixture and used more slices for garnish. It turned out great, lighter than banana pudding, and SO easy!

This was so good and devoured immediately before any of the other pies at Thanksgiving this year! I made the graham cracker crust by pulsing 12 reduced-fat graham cracker (sheets), 5 Tbls melted butter, 1/4 cup sugar, and 1/8 tsp salt into a fine sand. I sliced up 2 1/2 bananas and placed them on the crust. I diced up the remaining 1/2 banana and mixed it into the pudding (to prevent browning). I made homemade whipped cream with 2 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream, 2 1/2 teaspoons vanilla, and 3 Tbls powdered sugar and pipped a rose pattern over the entire pie. SO GOOD!!  UPDATE: the grocery store was out of regular graham crackers so I bought a box of already crushed crackers. I used 1 1/2 cups and 7 tablespoons butter.

I took another reviewer's suggestion and used an electric mixer to blend the milk and pudding mix (combo of vanilla and banana).  This produced a think filling.  I also used an oreo cookie crust.  I tossed the banana slices with lemon to prevent browning.  Very easy pie!

Such a simple yet tasty pie !! There is enought there to make two pies if you use the graham cracker crust from the store. This was a big hit on christmas and was ate before any store bought pies or even a chocolate pie from scratch ! Yum!

Although I prefer a little more work to go into my desserts, I'm giving this five stars because it's very good for being so easy. Like the last reviewer suggested, I let my milk/pudding mixture sit in the fridge while I cut up the bananas. The full amount of pudding fit perfectly into the pie crust. For the reviewer who was confused about the pudding, were you using instant pudding? Try Jello isntant pudding mix-- it comes in 3.9oz boxes. This pie was easy and delicious-- perfect for a warm spring day.

I used 2 boxes of vanilla pudding and added maybe a half teaspoon of almond extract.  I also whipped up some heavy whipping cream with a little sugar in it.  Wow!! What a smash hit!  I was lucky I got a piece to try.

Very good pie!  I would have gave it 5 stars if I had made it with a gram cracker crust.  
I don't know what size pie shells everyone is using who say the filling was waaay too much. I followed the directions and I had just the perfect amount of filling.
Will deff make again!

Used a ready made shortbread crust and halved all ingredients to make only 1 pie.  Mixed 1 1/2 banana in with pudding then sliced last half to go on top.  Dip banana slices in lemon juice.

I have made this recipe twice now and is very easy. The first time I made it the only change I made was the whipped topping. Instead of the 'Cool Whip' topping I used fresh thick whipping cream as I find the frozen topping gives it a very generic flavour and it was lovely! Definitely something I would recommend when making this. Second time around I also made my own crust which turned out fantastic. I'd have never have thought to use instant pudding mix (only living in the USA for a few months I didn't know it existed) but it was lovely & super easy.

PERFECT!  I deviated from the original recipe just a bit and used a graham cracker crust since I didn't have time to prepare a true pie crust.  I also used one banana cream pudding mix and one vanilla.  It gave it just a little more of a banana taste.  I found that the amount was perfect for one pie. In the end the pie had a mounded shape.

You have to love, and I mean LOVE the taste of banana cream pudding mix in order to use it here. I thought the mix was too artificial tasting. Anyway, I also made the mistake of grabbing cook and serve banana cream pudding mix and that ruined my filling because it would not set. So make sure you get INSTANT banana cream mix. I would have prefered using the two vanilla pudding mixes and just more fresh bananas on the bottom!

I used a pre-made graham cracker crumb pie shell and a pre-made oreo cookie pie shell.  Put bananas in one and strawberries in the other.  Used one box vanilla pudding and one box banana cream pudding mix.  Used low-fat whipped topping and fat free milk.  Also topped with a few strawberries and bananas on top of the whipped cream.  Yum, yum.  (By the way, you don't HAVE to wait four hours to eat this!)

Very good and very easy.  I used my mom's pie crust recipe, 1 fat free vanilla pudding and 1 normal banana pudding, and Cool Whip.  Easy, tasty, and hard to turn down.  Don't forget to wait to put on the bananas until it is near serving time or else they quickly brown while chilling.

My family loved this pie! I followed other reviewers suggestions and used one box of banana pudding and one box of vanilla pudding. I also put a small amount of chocolate and caramel syryp on top! Wonderful!

Awesome!  I made it for our Christmas eve brunch.  It was so easy and I did use one banana and one vanilla pudding mix.  My whole family loved it and I am glad I made two because most of us had seconds.  Thanks this is definately a keeper.

This turned out great! I used sugar free puddings and used a lite whipped topping, and no one could even tell there was no added sugar! One question about the directions though....it calls for 2 3.5 ounce packages of pudding mix, the largest box of mix I could find was 1.5! So I combined 4 boxes together, but then it was too thick so I had to add more milk. Are there pudding mixes that large, or am I just not getting something?

Wonderful pie!  Was trying hard to duplicate a favorite treat from a local sandwich shop, and this one is it.  I did follow the suggestions of others and used 1 box of vanilla pudding and 1 box of banana pudding.  Also, I made two layers of bananas seperated by a layer of the pudding, and topped with additional pudding.  Not being a fan of frozen whipped topping, I substituted with whipped heavy whipping cream, very slightly sweetened.  This recipes a keeper!

This was great since it was so easy and tasted really good.  I substituted one package of the vanilla pudding with banana pudding.  Topped with slivered almonds and drizzled with chocolate sauce.  Was a huge hit!

Very light, not overly sweet.  Used 1 box vanilla pudding and 1 box banana pudding.  Instead of using a baked pie crust, I made a cookie crust with Vanilla Wafer cookie crumbs.

I make this all the time and I use custard powder instead pudding mix if you have custard powder. Boil enough water for you pie, add condensed milk and custard powder,stir until almost boil and remove from oven. Once cool pour over bananas and top with whip topping, decorate with slice bananas.

This was my first year attempting to make pies for Thanksgiving.  I made pecan, pumpkin and this banana cream pie (I got all 3 recipes from allrecipes.com).  The banana cream pie was a huge hit and was the first to be gobbled up.  It was surprisingly easy and quite delicious!  I will definitely make this pie again.

Yum!!  This recipe seemed so basic, I really didn't expect it to be great.  But it was!  I actually was running behind schedule, so I called my 14-year old son and walked him through how to make it.  So quick and easy. Great texture and flavor. I used one box vanilla and one box banana pudding and a homemade crust.  Will definitely make again.

Excellent recipe!!  At the others suggestion, I used one pkg banana cream pie filling and one pkg vanilla.  I think the only thing I would do different is put three sliced bananas on the bottom as I like alot of bananas.

This is more of a banana pudding pie than a true banana cream pie but it's very tasty nonetheless. I used 1 vanilla, 1 banana flavored pudding; 4 bananas sliced & dipped in lemon juice, mixed in carefully; and about half a standard container of lite cool whip. Instead of a baked crust (there was a mishap involving flour--best not to ask) I mounded it into a pie dish and arranged Nilla wafers around the sides. Delish!

After reading most of the reviews I decided to alter this recipe when making it my first time... I used 1 box vanilla pudding and 1 box banana cream pudding.  I used 2 cups of milk then mashed the bananas and folded into the pudding mix.  For the slices of bananas on the top of the pie...I soaked them in lemon juice so that the top of the pie had nice fresh looking slices instead of brown ones.  Was a winner for the family dessert.

This is an absolutely delicious pie for how easy it is to make. I used a store-bought graham cracker crust and followed suit with other reviews by splitting the pudding half and half with vanilla and bananna.  The mixture came out firm and perfect for one pie! Definitely will make again.

Excellent, excellent, excellent! I was skeptical, but my husband and I LOVE it!! I cut the recipe in half because it makes a lot. I made my own crust and used soy milk instead of regular milk. I used the vanilla pudding as stated (not banana, as suggested) and added a thin layer of strawberries on top of the bananas for a little kick. Just wonderful! Thanks for posting!

This is a great recipe, but my wife made her own variation.  Here is what she did...She lined the bottom of a 9x12 glass casserole dish with vanilla wafers and sliced bananas.  Then she spread a mixture of banana cream and vanilla puddings, the 2.5c of milk, and 3/4 cup whipped cream over the top.  To finish it off she put a light layer of whipped cream over the pudding mixture, another sliced banana, and crushed vanilla wafer bits.  YUMMY!!  The kids loved it, as did we.

I took advice of others and used 1 box banana creme pudding mix and 1 box vanilla pudding mix.  For me it kind of gave it too much of a fake banana taste but ofcourse it was good enough that there were no leftovers.  I mixed the pudding with half heavy cream and half milk-it makes it taste soo much richer and yummier. I also used  fresh whipped cream (2cups heavy cream, 3/4 cup sifted confectioners sugar and a squirt of vanilla-whip in chilled bowl with chilled wisk or paddles) opposed to cool whip.  I am use to having a banana cream pie from scratch that has more of a vanilla custard taste with lots of banana in it.  I do want to try again just using the vanilla pudding mix and see which i like better.  I wouldn't pass this up though- I would be skeptical though of using the banana pudding if you are looking for a true banana cream pie taste- if you are all about the banana-GO FOR IT!  Def soo easy for a last minute dessert.

Yeah Baby! I would have taken a pic but we were in too much of a hurry to eat it! I made some healthier modifications and it was simply the best! You better eat it quick or else the bananas will turn. HURRY!

Easy and Delicious. I added a layer of pecans on the bottom of the crust before I baked it. I also used sugar-free pudding. To the reviewer that could only find 1.5oz box of pudding...that is the sugar-free size for 6 servings. The .9 oz box is for 4 servings. I used one vanilla and one banana of the .9oz box and it came out wonderful.

yUM!! I also did as others sugested and add one banana and one vanila package pudding. This came out great and was so easy. I made it for a Thanksgiving dinner at church and it was gone within 5 minutes. This made me feel wonderful, seeing as there were so many other pies to chose from. Thanks so much this is a keeper!!!

Good, easy recipe.  I used four bananas & put half on the bottom, then half the pudding, then the rest of the bananas & the rest of the pudding.  I also used one box of vanilla & one box of banana pudding as other suggested.  I made it again with chocolate pudding & it was just as good.

I have made this recipe 3 times since October and my family loves it.  I do add one banana pudding with one vanilla pudding and add slivered almonds.  This is the best banana cream pie ever.  My mother wants me to make an extra one for her every time. Thanks Angie.

This pie is WONDERFUL!  I did the same as others and used 1 banana pudding and 1 french vanilla.  I also used 2 layers of bananas and a graham cracker pie crust.  So easy and so good!  I plan on making this often!

Since my 12-year-old son is diabetic, I used sugar-free puddings (one banana cream and one vanilla) and Cool Whip Lite.  It turned out great!  The whole family enjoyed it...and it was so quick to make.  A definite keeper!

This was delicious and easy to make.  I would suggest not using a ready-made shortbread pie crust as I did, because it was too crumbly and hard to serve.  Definitely a keeper!  Thanks for sharing.

This was so easy to make and really, really delicious.  I used lite whipped topping which was great.  Next time I will use 1 package of banana pudding and one of vanilla.  I will also increase the amount of bananas to at least 4 or 5.  I ended up throwing out a little of the pudding mixture because it wouldn't fit into the pie crust.  Next time I will try using a different kind of crust too.  Great for a quick dessert to bring to someone's house.

Wow, this is SO easy and SO good on a hot summer day.I prefer a pastry crust, but the ready made one in your grocer's dairy case work very well! Bananas will get brown if it hangs around too long....as if that would ever be a problem!

This recipe does not include enough bananas.  All I could taste was pudding and pie shell.  I would probably try it again with 3 more bananas.  Instead of bananas just on bottom, I will try to layer pudding with bananas like banana pudding.

this is a good recipe, but i added vanilla extract (1/2 - 1 tsp) to a 5oz box of banana cream instant pudding and a sprinkle of cinnamon over the banana's prior to adding the pudding mix.

I just want to thank whoever originally wrote in this recipe!  I have won two pie baking contests with this one.  The only thing I do differently than the recipe is to substitute one small package of banana pudding for one of the vanilla ones.  I have done both regular and graham cracker crusts, both with superb results!

YUUUUUUUUUUUMMMMMMMM!  This was soooo easy.  The first pie I've ever made.  I used dream whip intead of cool whip and even without the vanilla in the dream whip recipie, it was super good.  Also I used some frozen short bread pie crusts.  I'd throw some almond slivers on top next time.
Make this you won't be sorry.

Made this for my husband who LOVES banana cream pie...it was so simple I didn't think it would be too good. But it was a huge hit, I got compliments all night and he had it again for breakfast! I used one package of vanilla and one french vanilla for a richer flavor.

Quick and easy!!! I used only banana pudding mix (2 boxes). In addition, I took the advice of other reviewers and added some lemon juice to the bananas to prevent browning. I used a graham crust, I only folded the cream into one box of the pudding and used the other as directed. The filling was firm and I had just enough.

Very easy recipe! My husband devoured it and said it was by far better than Marie Callenders!! I used 70% vanilla pudding and 30% banana pudding into a bowl and folded in about 3 cups of whipped topping to make the filling. The only thing I would change is the pie crust, instead of graham I used a 'Nilla Wafer pie crust' and it wasn't to his liking. This will be my go-to recipe for an easy pie.

Super easy to make and a big hit with the family. There was enough to make two pies, which I had figured, based on the amount in the bowl as I was mixing.

I made two small pies and used banana pudding mix. It was great. I didn't care for the pie crust so next time I will use Vanilla wafers and maybe try one with graham cracker crust. My husband thought the crust was good though and his buddy that came over literally licked his plate.

I as reminiscing how when I was 12, my brother and I would buy a frozen banana cream pie made by Swanson's as a treat after school and demolish the whole thing. So I thought I would try to recreate it using this recipe. I did not add the whipped cream though, (didn't have any) and I used one box each, vanilla and banana cream pudding. Its important to use cold milk and using my mixer, mixed well. The consistency was nice and thick. Using canned whipped cream, I covered pie, then placed plastic lid on and put in freezer. (Unfortunately, it wasn't what I had hoped for, good but way too frozen), so I placed in refrigerator to thaw out and was pleasantly surprised at the texture and taste. The whipped cream shrank a bit while it was in the freezer, so I just added more.  This is a great FAST and QUICK desert. Thanks a bunch!

It was very yummy, just dont like how fast you have to eat it so next time im going to try and mix the bananas up in the pie. Maybe if I had a bigger family it would go alot quicker. But very very good.

I followed this recipe exactly, except I added some banana slices into the mixture. The pie was delicious and extremely easy to make! The only thing I wish I did differently was use a graham cracker crust instead!

I made this for my FIL one day on a whim and it has become his FAVORITE pie!  I use two packages of banana pudding and my own recipe for the pie crust.  He asks for it often!

This was a huge hit.  I did add a little lemon juice to the bananas to keep them from browning.  But the chunks of bananas under the filling was delicious!

Quick and easy but not worth the time/effort saved. It also came out very runny, despite my overuse of pudding mix (I used 2x113gram boxes).

I had never made a pie before, but I am a very good cook. I followed this receipe exactly to what is was requesting. I even read other reviews about this pie. Doing 1 package of vanilla and 1 package of banana pudding. I even used a mixer instead of a whisk. When I was done this pie was so thick it was like a custard not creamy like you pie at a store. So I added more milk I started with a cup 8 oz. This is where I should have left off, but instead I add another 8 oz. because I wanted it creamy. This ended up making it too running, and then I went to get more pudding mix, and it was making it too sweet. I was hoping it would set overnight, and instead it turned out to be a pudding pie in of a cream pie. Next year I will buy the pie instead this was not what I was expecting.

This recipe was the most simple thing ever, I thought with all of the outstandindg reviews it would be better. It would be fun for an elementary/middle/high schooler to prepare and munch on with friends at a kids party or at school function (for kids).   I wasnt too embarrassed bringing this because it WAS a contribution and that is always nice (brought it for Thanksgiving 2009). I did bring an amazing "Martha Stewart" green bean casserole, so that was my prize dish for the day, which was divine!!  PS: FYI do not make the pudding mix, otherwise you will have results like another negative reviewer having it too sloppy. I did follow another viewers alteration and cut back 1/2 cup on the milk and it was still a bit 'sloppy' when cut...even after storing it in the fridge overnight. Hope this helped =]

Tasted wonderful but was a little soupy. I used a pre-prepared graham crust. I would use a little less milk.

Great recipes an so easy! I used 1 box of vanilla pudding and 1 box of banana. I also used a Marie Calendars pie crust which was perfect with the creamy filling. I topper mine with cool whip around the edges, banana slices and Nilla wafers! This is definately a go to recipes for a quick and delicious dessert!

Update: quite mushy but delicious!  Haven't eaten it yet but I used a pre-made graham cracker crust, brushed it with an egg white and baked it for 5 min at 375 degrees, once it cooled, filled it with sliced bananas dipped in lemon juice, half a banana remained so I mashed it an added it in with the pudding mixture. For the pudding, I only needed ONE box of jello vanilla pudding and 1 cup of milk, and I used 1 package of dream whip. Used half the package of dream whip in the pudding mix and will top the pie with the other half. It seems thick and won't be runny :)

I had some textural issues because I used cook & serve pudding, but otherwise the taste was great! I made some changes: used graham cracker crust (which I baked for 5 min @ 375 ahead of time), I layered 4 oz. dark chocolate pudding, 1 sliced banana, 3.4 package banana pudding mixed with 1/2 cup light whipped topping, 4 oz. dark chocolate pudding, and 1 sliced banana. I marbelized the chocolate and banana pudding on the top layer, so it looked pretty. I let everyone top with their own whipped topping.

This was such a great pie, and so easy!  I used the 'Pie Crust IV' recipe from this site (also easy!), baked, let it cool.  I sliced two bananas and put them on the bottom, and used only one package of Vanilla pudding mix.  I mixed the pudding as per package instruction (only 2 cups mile) until it was firm then folded in half of the whipped topping.  The pie was not runny at all, the filling amount was perfect and my husband couldn't get enough of this pie.  Will definitely use again!

Love this recipe. I put it in a graham cracker crust instead of pie crust. I also did a banana and vanilla pudding package. I filling was a little too much. No biggy- I just spooned it out and ate it! Yummy and easy recipe!

Very very good. In fact, it's so good that I have some family members who were angry with me for showing them up by making a better banana cream pie. I took the advice from the reviews and used one package of banana pudding and one of vanilla. Perfect! Will make again and again.

The recipe calls for folding whipped cream into the pudding mixture, but I find that its much easier to fold it in after pudding is set. Otherwise there are clumps in the pudding/whipped cream mixture, and that doesn't look too nice.

This is such a simple recipe, but very good.  I usually use a graham cracker crust or the nilla wafer one.  I believe there is a shortbread prepared crust that would be good, as well.  This is as simple as it gets with tasty results!

Heavenly.  I decided to use a graham cracker crust as some have suggested and it was delicious.  I did do half banana cream pudding and half vanilla.  I topped with fresh whipping cream (recipe:  1 cup heavy whipping cream, 3 tablespoons powdered sugar and 1/4 teaspoon vanilla.  Whip all ingredients together).  Thanks for the post.

This definitely gets 5 stars. I had to restrain myself from eating half the pie. My whole family (especially the kids) LOVED and raved about it. I actually made pie crust from scratch instead of using pre-made crusts. I should have made two more pies from the amount of requests for seconds and thirds I got.

Well, what can I say, this pie turned out to be a *big hit*!! I don't remember the guy's name but he said he left the whipped topping to the side and let people dollop it on their individual slices - we did too. Otherwise we followed the recipe to a tee.

My only criticism is, it was difficult getting the slices to stay intact when serving them up. Is that just what it's going to do since it's a cream pie? Or did I do something wrong? 

Either way, two thumbs up. It ultimately didn't matter what it looked like, it tasted so good going down, mm-mm-mm!!!

quick, easy, delicious!  and best of all it's no bake!  and if you use artificially sweetened puddings and/or lite whipped topping its just as fantastic and completely guilt free!!  made it twice, so far, once following the directions exact and once more changing for the reduced sugars and it was out of this world both times, so much so that i didn't notice the difference and double checked the packages to make sure i bought the right stuff :) and I plan to make this many, many more times in the future!

This was my first attempt at making a Banana Cream Pie.  I made it to take to work and everyone loved it.  There were no leftovers because the women I work with argued over who got to take the leftovers home.  

I used 1 vanilla and 1 banana because I was a little bit scared of having too much of that artificial banana taste and it was perfect.  I also made homemade whipped cream (from this site) which was a nice compliment.  

This is easy, cheap, and delicious.  Thank you for the great recipe!

So effortless and yet so yummy! One of the desserts I have ever made. I just had 3 people for dinner and they all loved the pie. LOVED IT. I followed earlier suggestions and used one vanilla and one banana pudding mix. Beating the mix and milk with an electric mixer definitely helps thicken the mixture. If you like a more banana taste in your filling -- which I do -- I also added one mashed banana into the mixture after the milk-pudding mixture thickens, before I fold in the whipped cream. Use a really ripe banana to get a nice mash. It helps thicken the filling too.

I made this very simple recipe at my girlfriend's cottage and the men loved it.  It was a little messy cutting into it and the banana's did turn brown some but all in all, it was very tastey.  As previous reviewers mentioned, I will try dipping the banana's in lemon juice before hand and will also try using a graham cracker crust too.  This recipe is a keeper with a minor tune up...Thanks!

This pie is awesome! It doesn't have the same rich taste of a made from scratch banana cream pie, but it's still delicious. Given the fact it takes so little time to prepare I think it's a nice trade off. If you don't have much time and want a great tasting banana cream pie - it's a great recipe. I used a regular pastry shell with 1 box french vanilla and 1 box banana pudding.

I wanted to find a good and quick recipe for banana cream pie; this isn't it for me. I used 1 pkg of french vanilla and 1 pkg of banana pudding, as others have suggested. The filling thickened very nicely and very quickly, but I think it had way too much of a 'fake banana' taste. I won't be trying this recipe again.

I made this for the "non-sweet eaters" at our Thanksgiving gathering and I was told it was awesome. It also disappeared before any of the others so it must have been good. I am not really sure if I should even review this because I changed this puddings completely but the method was fantastic. Using only 2 1/2 cups of milk for both packages of pudding makes it custard like and then adding in the bit of whipped cream is just awesome. I used a package of banana pudding and a package of cheesecake - I thought I had vanilla until right before it was time to make the pie and didn't feel like going back to the store so I just went ahead and went with the cheesecake. The cheesecake and the banana work very well together and it was delicious so we were all happy!

This is such an easy and delicious recipe to make. My sisters loved it! No leftovers--  was gone in less than ten mins! They are begging me to make more. Only thing I'd change would be to add more bananas on the bottom. I felt like there was too much custard and not enough of the healthy goodness of bananas. I'll  add one more banana to the bottom layer next time I make it.

AWESOME!  I love this recipe so much.  I follow the directions exactly, and it makes a great banana cream pie.  It's quick, easy, and delicious.  My husband loves it, too!  Whenever we have extra bananas laying around, we make this pie.

Ultra easy and very good too. No standing over a hot stove stirring this one. DH thought this was great, and it took minimum effort, minimum ingredients, so it's a winner for that. Thanks Angie, this was so easy.

My husband won't eat many desserts, but he loves banana cream pie and he thought this one was great. I will follow another user's suggestion and toss the banana with lemon juice next time as they browned up very quickly. Great tasting pie, though!

I took the lazy girl way out and used a boxed graham cracker crust to make enough for a 13x9 pan.  Then I used one box of sugar-free/fat-free banana and one box of vanilla pudding.  I sliced all three bananas for the bottom, poured the pudding mixture on top, and went ahead and smeared with the whipped topping -- all at one time and then put in the fridge for a few hours.  Only problem with this is that you CAN'T STOP EATING IT!!!  If you're going to use a large pan instead of pie pan, feel free to add one more box of pudding.  Still, it makes plenty.

5 stars is not enough for this recipe. It is so gooooood !!!! I also used vanilla and banana pudding. This is a pie that I could eat all by myself with no problem at all, but passed around and was gone in second. Thanks so much. Elaine

I enjoyed making this recipe!  I was very proud of the pie I made.  It was eay and tasted good.  Next time I will do what was suggested about using one vanilla and one banana pudding mix, instead of two vanilla.  I think that would have made the pie a five stars instead of four.  I will be making it again.  i added sliced almonds and carmel syrup to the top of the pie.

My boyfriend loves banana cream pie so I wanted to make him this pie as a surprise. We ended up taking it to his family gathering and I was quite nervous as I never got the chance to taste-test it before letting other try it. THEY LOVED IT! This recipe was very easy. Like others, I used one box of vanilla pudding and one box of banana cream pudding. I will be making this pie for years to come. Thanks for a great receipe.

Add more bananas and use instant banana pudding instead of the vanilla flavor.  Only use the 8oz. container of Cool Whip.

THIS PIE RECIPE WAS GREAT I LOVED IT!
BUT INSTEAD OF USING VANILLA PUDDING I USED BANNA 
PUDDING IT GAVE IT MORE OF THE BANNA FLAVOR!

I made this for Mother's Day and everyone loved it.  I couldn't find the banana pudding as a few suggested so I ended up getting little, single serving premade graham cracker crusts and filled them only with the vanilla.  I made only 1/2 of the receipe just so I could fill the 6 crusts I had.  Everyone loved them.  My very picky brother asked that I definately make this again.  Thanks for the awesome, super quick and easy receipe.

This was not what I expected. I guess I was spoiled by my mom's homemade banana cream pie growing up and this fell short. I think next time, I'll just make some pudding and have the bananas as a snack.

This pie is such a hit whenever I make it.  It is so fast and simple to make I feel like I should throw some flour on my face like that old commercial just so they think I worked hard.  I too use 1 vanilla and 1 banana pudding, but I toss my bananas in lemon juice after I cut them so they won't turn color as quickly.   I make like a double decker pie.  But some bananas in the bottom, filled the crust about half way with the pudding, then another layer of bananas and the rest of the pudding. When I serve this, I top it with a little whipped cream and place three fresh cut banana slices on top of each piece.  Makes a very nice presentation.  (Impresses the heck out of your mother-in-law too.) I used a fairly deep pie pan and it just made one nice size pie which just enough left over that hubby got to lick the spoon.

UNBELIEVABLE!  took others advice and used 1 vanilla pudding with 1 banana pudding.  1 batch actually filled 2 pie crusts.  brought it to work and have never received so many compliments!  will make again!  (i think it only took me 7.5 minutes to make:)

This recipe was great - a huge hit at our Easter dinner!  I did use one box of vanilla and one box of banana pudding.  I also took earlier reviewers advice and put another layer of bananas in between the pudding - it was great!  I have to say I think this was the easiest and best pie I've ever made :)

I've made this many times now, and it definitely makes more than 1 pie-full. So now, when I pick up the ready crust for it, I also pick up a package of 6 mini pie crusts. That works out PERFECTLY, the remaining fills all of them to the top. I used the suggestion of 1 box french vanilla and 1 box banana pudding. Once done as recipe suggests, I top with chopped walnuts in addition to extra bananas and whipped cream. I get requests to bring this to all potlucks! I've also been experimenting with other flavors, same ratios...chocolate coconut is also a big hit (layer and  garnish with flaked coconut and top with macadamias!).

I used FF whipped topping, sugar free vanilla pudding, and skim milk and it was very tasty.  However, we thought it would be better with a graham cracker crust instead of the baked pie shell.

I used sugar free puddings so my diabetic dad could eat this.  I put the extra Cool Whip on the side instead of garnishing the pie, in case someone wanted to add just a tad.  I sometimes make a very light homemade graham cracker crust for pies too (with Splenda) so it has less sugar.

This was an amazing recipe - very fast and easy to make! I did what one of the reviewers said, by adding one French Vanilla pudding mix and one Banana Cream mix, and the result was great! I made it for my boyfriend, and now he wants the recipe so that he can make it for his mom too!

A great quick and simple dessert. I had bananas at home that I was afraid would go bad, so this was a way to use them up in 1 day. I used a graham cracker crust,  only 1 instant vanilla pudding packet and 2 cups of milk.  1 banana was cut up into very small pieces and mixed into the pudding/whipped topping mixture. This was the perfect amount to fill the pie crust without any leftovers.  The pie was topped with banana slices, semi sweet chocolate chips and a little whipped topping. 
I bought almond slices, but didn't use them. They would have been great mixed in or as a topping.

Husband loves this pie. I use ready made graham cracker crust and swap one of the pudding mixes for banana. A tip is to soak the banana slices in a bit of lemon juice. It prevents browning and DOES NOT taste like lemon.

I used sugar free banana pudding and used homemade whipped cream. Used a ready made frozen pie crust. I found that it made a nice full pie, but it wasn't spilling out. It is very good.

Added some banana extract for more flavour.  Dipped banana slices in lemon juice to prevent browning.  Used a deep dish pie shell.

This is not a banana cream pie. It's simply an instant pudding pie with sliced bananas.  It's an okay treat for kids, but it's far from being the original.

This is a great recipe - and so easy to make! I found I could get by with 2 bananas and 1 cup of whipped cream - that was plenty.

Very Easy and Mine turned out wonderful !! Thank you to all reviewers for there tips. I did add bananas to my pudding. The only thing was hard to get out of the pie pan but this was due to my crust not the recipe, will make again for sure and next time use a flaky crust.

This recipe is horrible.  I don't even want to give it a star because we couldn't ever try it. I double checked that I used the correct amounts because as a chemist, I don't normally make mistakes when it comes to  baked goods.  The pudding mix never set after 14 hours.  This should be called banana soup in a pie crust.

This was really easy to make, and I mixed banana and vanilla pudding. However, it was a bit runnier than I would have liked. (though no one in my family seemed to mind and ate it all up)

I used banana pudding you cook using 1 3/4 cups milk, then cool using plastic wrap over pudding to prevent skin.  When cool mix half container of cool whip with pudding and put in graham wafer crust (1 1/2 c graham crumbs, 1/4 c sugar, 1/4 c melted margarine pressed into 9" pan baked at 375F for 8 min and cooled) lined with sliced bananas (save a few Tablespoons of graham mixture to sprinkle on top at end).  Chill min 3 hours, then slice another banana on top and cover with rest of cool whip.

Simple, easy to make pie!  Although I used a regular pie crust, I think I will use a graham cracker crust next time.  I also used one banana pudding and one vanilla pudding and it turned out great.  The amount of filling was perfect for a 9" pie shell.  I will definitely make it again.

Yum! Simple to make, followed directions, but instead of putting bananas at bottom, I mixed them in the filling. I also only used one full 8oz container of cool whip, and served it on the side to put extra on individual pieces. Not too sweet, and not tons of overwhelming banana flavor! Very light and creamy

Very tasty. I added a 1/4 tsp of banana essence, 1/4 real vanilla essence and a few drops of almond essence to the pudding mixture.  Added a nice complexity to the flavour.

This was delish! Very light and refreshing. I made it with the premade graham cracker crust and everyone loved it! I followed the directions exactly. It is a very "soft" pie. Next time I think I'll try cutting back the milk to two cups and upping the whipped  topping to 1 cup to see if it will firm up just a tad more. Overall this is definitely going into my favorites category .

I made it for my nieces little birthday party and everyone loved it, even the kids! Many asked me for the recipe which I was glad to share, it is absolutely perfect. I mixed in a banana with the vanilla pudding mix and also mixed the sliced bananas with a little bit of lemon juice just to avoid browning.

We made the pie and it was soupy, per the handful of 1 & 2 star reviews.  Turns out my husband bought the wrong kind of pudding - NOT instant.  Make sure you have *instant* pudding or it won't set!  We tried boiling the mixture after a few hours in the fridge to see if we can save the pies - it's not looking great.

This was pretty good.  I made it with homemade whipped cream instead of coolwhip because I do not like the artificial taste of coolwhip.

Quick and terrific.  Prior to finding this recipe I used one that took forever over the stove.  This tastes just as good and is very easy!! My granddaughter is 5 years old and this is the 2nd year that she has made it with me.

I made this for friends as a thank you gesture.  His favorite pie growing up was banana cream. This was my first one I made. I took the advice and used one vanilla and one french vanilla pudding.  It was delicious.  I asked for any changes they thought I should make and they told me it was perfect!

Excellent & quick recipe !!  I used 1 package each of french vanilla and banana cream instant pudding.  After adding the whipped cream and last banana, I grated some fresh nutmeg on top.  I think grating some semisweet chocolate on top might be a nice touch too.

This was the hit of the party! Super easy and very delicious. I used a ready-made graham crust to make it even easier. I too added almost a whole mashed banana to the vanilla pudding for some extra flavor.

This pie is easy to make and tastes great. However, I agree that the filling is too much for one pie. I followed the directions but decided to split up the milk and pudding mix so I used only 1 1/4 cup of milk and 1 3.5 ounce pudding mix pack per pie. This way it fit perfectly into a standard pie shell. Using it all for one pie seems unnecessary given that the whipped topping fills out the top of the pie.

Great! BUT... I did change one thing, instead of using just vanilla pudding i used 1 small box vanilla and 1 small box of banana pudding. Also, I didn't put the the bananas on the bottom. My family LOVED it!

Used a premade vanilla cookie crust, which was awesome.  Pie didn't hold shape when cut, but it was so good!  Probably because I used skim milk and lite cool whip.

This is my husbands favorite dessert.  I like that it is a very quick and easy recipe.  Like others, I use one box of vanilla and one box of banana pudding mix.  I usually use a Pillsbury refrigerated roll-out crust, but have also used frozen pie crusts as well.  Both work just fine.  I highly recommend this recipe.

Really good.. made no changes. Made super last minute and rather than the fridge, I put it in the freezer for about an hour or so while we were eating dinner. Did I mention I made this super last minute? It was great. I sliced bananas and piled on extra whipped cream right before serving. I was concerned about the bananas turning. But. I gotta say, I just had a piece the next day and WOW it was even better. So, in hind sight. making it in advance and letting it sit prolly helps to meld the flavors, but for a quick throw together and serve, it was great. It was served after a heavy pasta dish and BLT salad, which was good as well. Guests loved it and it was a success! TFP such an easy and delicious summer dessert!

Yay! I made this for my fiancé and he loved it! I revised it just in that I added one packet of banana cream pie pudding instead of the second vanilla packet. The best part about this is that it's so easy - you really can't mess it up.

I followed this recipe exactly except used one vanilla and one banana pudding. I didn't do the extra garnish also just put whip topping on top and served it that way. It disappeared in minutes and I thought was very good. I would make this again.

Very quick and easy to make. I followed some suggestions and used 1 french vanilla and 1 banana pudding with less milk for the filling. Everyone enjoyed it but I thought it tasted a bit artificial. I might try again with a graham cracker crust (used a Pilsbury baked one this time).

Excellent!  I did use one banana cream and one vanilla pudding as others suggested and used one cup fresh whipped whipping cream with little powdered sugar rather than cool whip.  Just before serving I whipped up a sweeter whipped topping for the top and folks went crazy.  Will definitely make again and again!

I needed something fast for Easter dessert!  Found this and made it.  Used a real crust and baked it first, then put the pie mixture over it and chilled.  After it was chilled I drizzled chocolate syrup on the top.  Very delish!

I was surprised at how much I liked this recipe. I'm a true chocoholic, so fruit desserts are usually second rate. (I made it b/c my boyfriend likes banana cream pie.) But it really was great. I suggest that you remember to keep the whipped cream frozen. It may be a bit awkward to spread, but if it warms up too much, it will not go back to its nice thick texture in the fridge. But either way, it's really great, creamy and sweet. I also suggest adding some chocolate shavings on top. Yum!

This is a huge hit with my family!  Everyone loved it and I have been told I have to bring to all holiday dinners from now on.  The only thing I did different from the recipe is use one box of vanilla and one box of banana cream pudding instead of two vanilla.  Also, make sure you don't mix the milk, pudding and Cool Whip until you are ready to pour it into the crust as it sets fast.

I also used 1 package of vanilla and 1 package of banana, then added a mashed banana to the filling. The taste was amazing, but it wasn't as firm as I would have like. I think next time I will reduce the milk by at least a 1/4 cup.

I'd give this 3 stars, my husband would give it 5 stars, so I compromised at ****.  I used one box of vanilla pudding and one box of banana pudding per other reviewers' suggestions.  I also mashed one banana in with the puddings.  So the taste is extremely "banana-y" which the hubby LOVED.  However, my pie never set up - - it was very soupy.  You could not serve a 'piece' of this, it was more like a scoop of pudding and pie crust.

Great and easy recipe.  Although I would put more bananas in next time (personal taste). Used 1 box of vanilla and 1/2 box of banana cream pudding.  Left whipped cream on the side of tasters' preferences and followed others on the lemon trick for the bananas.  BTW, used ready-made graham pie crust.

This was very good, and believe it or not I had some family members that said they don't like banana cream pie. but eat this one. The only thing I did different was I added more bananas and I mashed them and mixed them in the pudding instead of just layering them on the bottom. will make again thanks

Had bad luck with this one.
My bananas were kind of old, really soft and a little discolored so I didn't want to layer them; thus I used the suggestion from "DetectiveT" and pureed the bananas (actually just beat them to a pulp in my mixer) then added in the pudding mix, and cut the milk to 1.5 cups. As a side note, due to the age of my bananas, they had that 'alcohol' smell, since they were producing ethanol...it actually puts an interesting alcoholic twist on the recipe :) I made a graham cracker crust as well, and let the pie set for over a day, but its still runny. I tried freezing it for a few hours, and it was slightly easier to cut into, but still a runny soupy mess.

I've been making this for years. You actually don't need to refrigerate for 3 hrs, I just alternate between the freezer and the fridge for about an hr. when I'm in a rush. As other reviewers suggested, I use 1 pkg of banana cream pudding & 1 pkg. of vanilla... always turns out and always a hit! Thanks!

Very tasty recipe!! Quick and simple to make. There was way too much filling, I would suggest only using one bax of pudding and decreasing the amount of milk. But overall i was very satisfied!!

I used ready crust, French vanilla/banana creme pudding - It tastes good its pretty similar to the recipes on the crust. Overall a good recipe - can be better with a little more creativity.

This was pretty good but it fell apart so easy, hard to get a good "slice" it was more like pudding.

For the little amount of time and effort put into this pie, it really did turn out tasty. It definitely doesn't have the taste of something you'd get at a Southern bbq restaurant, but like I said, it's quick. Next time I will try the original recipe that calls for the egg yolks, cream, corn starch, etc.

Could it get any easier?  I always have pie shells in the freezer, so I just popped one in the oven.  In a very short time it was ready.  I almost wanted to apologize for how easy it was, but everyone LOVED it so much, how could I?  Thanks!

This was an easy and excellent recipe.  The only thing I changed for the better was to use 1 box of Banana pudding and 1 box of french vanilla pudding.  Everyone loved it and i had enough left over from this recipe to make one more pie.

This recipe was so easy and delicious. This was my first ever pie and I made it for my fiance for Valentine's Day. He loved it. Great recipe as is, didn't change anything.

Delicious and simple.  Way too much filling though, enough for two pies.

Loved it!  Good call whoever came up with the French Vanilla and Banana Cream pudding combination.  I also liked the graham cracker crust.  So easy, too.  I'm in love.

I made this for my boyfriend on Thanksgiving because it's his favorite, and we both LOVED it!!  I especially loved how EASY it was...other than pre-baking the crust, there's no cooking at all, which is nice on Thanksgiving.  I also used one package vanilla and one package banana pudding and light whipped cream.  I had enough for two pies.  For anyone not wanting to make their own crusts, I have to suggest Marie Calender's frozen deep dish crusts...they don't taste like most store-bought crusts.  Thanks for the easy, delicious recipe!

Delightful =). I tossed the banana slices in lemon juice to prevent browning. I also used 1 vanilla pkg and 1 banana pkg of pudding.

It was very good.  I also used one box vanilla rather than two boxes of banana and had enough banana taste for us. Very easy and worth a try!
I'm sure I'll make it again

Great recipe!  It took me a few minutes to prepare and everyone loved it!  I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and used one package of vanilla pudding mix and one package of banana, and it came out great: not too strong of a banana flavor, since I'm not a huge fan of bananas.  I'll definitely be saving this recipe to use when I need a quick, yummy dessert.

This is an easy and great tasting recipe!  Everyone loved it.  I used graham cracker crust instead of baked pie crust... it was absolutely delicious. The banana flavour really comes through beautifully.  Will use for my Canada Day celebrations and every BBQ all summer long!

Very easy and good option to bring to a potluck.  The filling was enough for two pie crusts if you add in the extra bananas like some folks suggest.  I think next time, though, I'll just eat the filling as pudding.  Yum.

A little sweet for my taste, but my husband loved it.  I followed the recommendations of other reviewers and combined 1 box of vanilla and 1 box of banana pudding.  I added whipped cream instead of the whipped topping.  I thought the whipped cream might give it a little more of a homemade flavor. I didn't think there were enough bananas so next time I will add 3 bananas on the bottom instead.  I just read another review that suggested folding the bananas in with the pudding mixture.  Think I'll give that a try next time.

I only used 1 french vanilla pudding mix (by mistake) but it was still alright and the sweetness just right.  There was a lot of the cream though that could fit a mini-pie.

What a great recipe.  I made this for my sister's in-laws, who are the pickiest people on earth, and they loved it.  Although sis was mad that all they could talk about was that "good banana cream pie"  It is so easy and quick.

I took this to a friend's house for dinner, and it was a hit!  So good and creamy, and I even had enough for a second pie to feed my boyfriend.  I used one box of banana cream pudding and one box of vanilla, like some other reviewers suggested.  I will definitely be making this again.

I made the recipe with two pie shells like reviewers said here. Made them for my husband's work, and poor hubby didn't even get any because it was consumed in minutes!

I've experimented with the cheesecake flavored pudding , as well as banana cream. Its all good

I also used one box of the banana puddind and french vanilla pudding mix, plus slivered almonds on top. It received rave reviews for my husband's 40th Birthday party.

This pie was so quick and easy to make. The recipe did fill two 9-inch pie shells and I took both pies to my professor's tenure party. They were both eaten up so fast I didn't even have a piece for myself! It was a huge hit. I think next time I'll try adding half banana pudding and half vanilla pudding for a stronger banana flavor. :-)

This was a very delicious and refreshing pie. I made it for my dad for Father's Day 'cause banana cream anything is his favorite.  He really liked it as well as the rest of my family.

Excellent. Very good and very easy. I substituted homemade whipped cream for the Cool Whip. Does make enough filling for 2 pie crusts.

Super simple, super good!  My Dad came for Easter and I knew Banana Cream Pie was his favorite but having never made one before I searched for an "easy" recipe.  He LOVED it!!  So did my husband who said that he picks the banana's out of BCP.  He didn't...it was too yummy, he had to eat the whole thing!!  Didn't vary from the recipe at all, but took the advice of previous reviewers and used 2 pie crusts.

This is a excellent recipe for anyone who loves banana creme pie!  I used a store-bought shortbread crust which made this recipe even better.

This is a good fast recipe.  It should be noted that the recipe fills two pie shells, not one.  I'm suprised no one mentioned that, it's great to have two very generous pies!
