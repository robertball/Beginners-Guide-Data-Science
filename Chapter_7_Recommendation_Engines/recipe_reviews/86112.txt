it was awsome! I was making some onion roasted potatoes at the same time so I put in a little of my left over seasoning with 1 1/2 tbsp of water while cooking the chops in the frying pan. it made it very moist.  I used Mozzarella cheese  instead of the jack. it was a hit among the whole family !

this recipe is amazing. it become a family staple. though i do add my own touch, i use mozzarella instead of monterey  jack n i add bacon. it also helps to add water to the pan when cooking the pork chops, keeps them moist. Ive made this for a few friends as well and they love it

My husband and I loved it. Had to use slightly different ingredients. Garlic salt, onion powder, and pepper jack cheese. Turned out really good with a little extra spice with the pepper jack. I would recommend this to anyone.

The recipe was good but the pork chops seemed like they were missing something.  Next time I will try a different seasoning on them.

I everything in the recipe by half and used the same amount of vegetable oil, and used boned pork chops. Great recipe my boyfriend and I loved it. I would suggest boneless porkchops though. The Parsley is just garnish, and didn't use any... but still great! Will use it again.

Excellent!!!  Although....I couldn't help myself....I wrapped them in bacon before I cooked them in the skillet.  YUM!  I cooked the bacon half way through (stove or a couple minutes in the micro).  I use the platter bacon from the butcher at the grocery store....much better than the packaged stuff if you ask me.  Adhered them with toothpicks (don't forget to take them out before serving.  I also used garlic powder instead of minced because I was in a hurry.  I'm a diehard when it comes to garlic, but the powder was absolutely fine.  VERY TASTEY!!!

This was an interesting recipe that I stumbled upon when I was looking for something to make with what I had in my fridge.  I used grated Old Cheddar and topped it off with a squirt of BBQ sauce.  It slide off the chops, so I would try it with slices instead next time.

This is the best recipe ever. I am not a big fan of tomatoes but this one was really really good. It was very juicy. Loved it and will definitely use it again.

These were ok but doubt I'll make it again.  Just didn't impress my family or me.

This recipe turned out pretty good. Extremely easy to make and with ingredients commonly found in our house, so the only extra thing I had to buy were the tomatoes and the pork chops. My husband and I both really liked it, as did my five year old. My two year old wasn't real thrilled with it, but he did eat it. I'm sure since the majority of us liked it I will be making this again, especially since it was so easy. Thank you for the recipe, DERINDA33!

This was a good recipe. I didn't have Monterey Jack cheese, so I used Colby Cheddar instead. I am not fond of tomatoes, but this was tasty and the flavors/textures complimented each other very well.

These were nothing special.  I think there are so many other great ways to make pork chops.

These were good. I put a little italian dressing in the pan while they cooked to give them a little more flavor and to help make sure they didn't dry out.

Very good! I added sliced pastrami and mushrooms. I love Montery Jack cheese, but only had mozzarella. Will do this again :)
