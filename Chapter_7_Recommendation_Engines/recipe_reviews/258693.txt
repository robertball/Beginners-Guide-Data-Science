This was like dessert! Yum! I didn't have any coconut flavored syrup, so I used about 1/4 tsp of coconut extract. It was delicious! It is very sweet - but I have a sweet tooth, so it was perfect for me. Really a treat! This Allstar has been compensated for participation in the Allrecipes Allstar Program.

This is good, but it would be way too sweet for me with 1/2 cup of coffee creamer. I used 1/4 cup coconut milk and 1/4 cup Almond Joy creamer, and it was still sweet. I didn't have coconut syrup, so I used 1/4 tsp coconut extract as suggested by someone, which worked great. I added the whipped cream, caramel and coconut flakes, which were good, but a bit odd for me on an iced drink. I think this drink would be very good blended also.

Delicious, and really easy to make! I thought an extra drizzle of caramel was a great touch for extra sweetness.  This Allstar has been compensated for participation in the Allrecipes Allstar Program.

I love coconut so I had to try this recipe! I take my coffee black so I don't have sweetened creamers on hand so I substituted for regular milk. The coconut blended well with the caramel drizzle and whip on top. This makes for a great summery coffee drink and easy to make too!
