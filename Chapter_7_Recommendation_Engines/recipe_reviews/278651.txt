Delicious! I do think the skillet needed a bit more oil before cooking the chicken, and I decided to mix in some of the syrup into the tomato paste and pepper mixture before adding the chicken and pineapple chunks. I think this helped blend the sauce before the big chunks were added.

Definitely reduce the sugar.  I added some pineapple juice before adding the cooked chicken back to the pan. It was very good and my family says its a keeper.

I didn't use bell peppers as I didn't have any.  My husband liked it he wanted more (gravy) sauce.

I never knew pineapple and tomato past could work so well together. My whole family LOVED it!

Awesome recipe - my husband said it's in his top 5. Only thing I did different was add some of the sugar sauce in when the red pepper and pineapple was sautéing as suggested by another user. Will definitely make again.

Came out great. My husband, 3 yo and 15 mo all liked it- that’s saying a lot in my house! It’s a relatively simple recipe, just several small steps so it took a little longer but I imagine it would go faster next time. I used thigh meat because that’s what I had on hand and it came out very tender. I did cut the sugar per another reviewer but otherwise followed exactly.

Easy to make and very good.  I added a little bit of crushed red pepper.  I didnt have green onions, so i used while onions and thinly sliced zuccini for color.

Only thing I might do the next time is mince a jalapeno into it.  Our family always likes a little heat with the sweet.   Otherwise everybody enjoyed it!

I’m not a big fried food eater anymore- I still thought that this was a really great recipe with fresh ingredients and the pineapple glaze was a big win.
