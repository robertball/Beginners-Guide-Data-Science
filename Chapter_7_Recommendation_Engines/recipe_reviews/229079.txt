Simple tasty dish. I only used a few shakes of cayenne :) Recipe didn't state, so I drained the tomatoes and glad I did; all the broth left it a bit soupy, and I never did cover it. Next time I will use more of the other spices, less broth and perhaps a touch of sugar. DBF really liked this, but DS not so much. 4 servings might be understating, unless this is meant to be the main course; as a side, I would call it 6-8 servings. I served with homemade naan, yum!

My family really liked this recipe.  I like spicy food but decided to cut back on the cayenne.  I'm glad I did.  Even with 1t of cayenne it was spicy!  The dish once finished is also very appealing to the eye with the yellow spices, red tomatoes and green spinach!

Delicious. I changed it slightly... replaced half of cauliflower with half a butternut squash, no cayennepepper, added 5 strips of bacon and three cubed potatoes, served hotsauce on side...everyone in family has different tolerance for heat...everyone loved it

Okay per usual I am using what I have so no trips to the store. I made this for "vegetarian Monday" at my house. Used cauliflower crumbles (1.5 lbs) rather than florets so my texture was different. In order to my it heartier I added peas and carrots as other reviewers did. I also added a can of garbanzo beans. Just a pinch of cayenne as we have no heat tolerance. Doubled the rest of the spices...used half when the recipe states and the other half the last 10 minutes of cooking. Served over rice pilaf I made with basmati rice and fried Mexican fideo noodles, cinnamon and cloves, onions ginger and garlic. And naan from trader joes :) all with a side of saute'd string beans. Yum!

Really good recipe! Thank you for sharing it! I will be making this over and over again. Great way to get vegetables into a meal and filling enough to forego adding a starch to the meal.

I used 1/2 tsp of Cayenne and that was enough to let you know there is some heat in there.  Definitely need to serve it with chicken or some kind of protein.  I also used Walla Walla Sweet Onions that don't have a big bite to them.

Cut the cayenne way back, because my family doesn't like spicy food. Without it, though, we thought the recipe didn't have enough flavor. Doubling the remaining spices would probably make a big difference.

I added a medium sized sweet potato and only used half a large cauliflower but it was fabulous.  I didn't think there was too much liquid, in fact I was considering adding more stock.  And I would even consider adding more cayenne or chillies.

Definitely making it again.

Loved this! We aren't big heat fans so I only used a 1/4 tsp of cayenne and increased some of the other spices. I had kale and spinach in the fridge so I used both instead of just spinach. I did NOT drain my diced tomatoes and didn't have any issues with the dish being too soupy. I served mine over brown rice and with naan.

I love how this dish turned out! It was a great recipe to use up spinach, cauliflower, and tomatoes I had hanging around, but it turned out super tasty as well. And I love how chock-full of vegetables it is. I will definitely make this dish again. 

I did make changes to the recipe based on the ingredients I had on hand. I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned, so I threw them in with the cauliflower and onion for a couple minutes to break them down, rather than adding them after the spices. I used curry powder instead of coriander and water instead of veggie broth, because I didn't have the listed ingredients on hand. Even though I used water, this dish turned out very flavorful.

Very easy to make and delicious.  I did away with the diced tomatoes and opted for fresh chopped tomatoes instead--I use 3 or 4.  It makes the consistency less soupy.  Incredibly flavorful.

So yummy and healthy! I decreased vegetable broth to 1 cup and cayenne to 1/2 tsp. based on other reviews. I also used 3 diced fresh tomatoes instead of canned. It was amazing served over brown rice!

Tasty!  I cut back on the cayenne and doubled the cumin and coriander.  I would drain the diced tomatoes, next time, to reduce the amount of liquid at the end!  I made it in a wok and that worked well for the volume of the ingredients.

Delicious! We love it, Thank you.
I added carrots and peas. Reduced  cayenne to a little over 1/2 tsp. 
Switched the spinach with cilantro and lemon zest  that I added after I took it off the heat. 
I added a photo:)

Excellent! Sauteed chicken breast first, removed from pan, then followed recipe directions.  Added one packaged sliced mushrooms to the onions and cauliflower stage.   Cut back red pepper to 1/3 tspn.  Thickened sauce with cornstarch.

This was so easy and delicious. Had to make a couple changes, no tomatoes, added sweet potato spirals, increased the garlic and cut down on the cayenne. Added lite coconut milk at the end and simmered 5 minutes. Served over rice.

I reduced the vegetable broth to 1 cup and reduced the cayenne pepper to 1 tsp.  and added a couple of mushrooms. It still had plenty of kick.  While it tastes wonderful, the prep time is unrealistic, especially to de-stem the spinach.  That alone takes 20 minutes. I recommend allowing extra prep time or doing some of it in advance.  Over all a nice dish for something different to try.

This dish was ok. I found the spices were not enough to enhance the flavour. Maybe next time I would add caraway and curry powder for more punch.  I added probably twice as much cumin as well but it never came together for me the way I wanted. I followed the advice of another reviewer and drained the tomatoes but still found it became way too soupy. I would recommend draining the tomatoes completely and using half the broth to start and see how it goes.

This turned out great! It was a little soupy so maybe I'll drain the tomatoes next time, but otherwise it was awesome. I used paparika instead of cayenne to give it a little less heat, I made some basmati rice to go with it. Really delicious! I'm excited for leftovers!

awesome! I didn't have coriander or turmeric so I used 2 tsp green curry paste. also added 2 tsp cornstarch to thicken the sauce a little. spicy but really good - green curry is the spiciest of them so try red curry for less kick

This is really good! I love the flavors and the kick I get from the spiciness. I added more spices than the recipe called for. I also added about a teaspoon of ground cumin and then some whole cumin seeds and mustard seeds. I think the flavors will be better infused the next day. I was a little hesitant to put so much spinach in it but it cooks down a lot so it was perfect! Also I skipped the vegetable broth because using water is just fine.
