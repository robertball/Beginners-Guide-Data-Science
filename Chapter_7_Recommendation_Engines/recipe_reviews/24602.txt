I am the same way. I work at an applebee's and we have a hot bacon dressing to die for and after searching for anything remotely close and coming up with nothing, I came across this recipe. I just made it and it's quick and easy and exactly what I was looking for. Thank you so much for posting this!

Yummy dressing. I thought it might be a bit too sweet so I cut the sugar to 1 cup and doubled up on the bacon. Perfect! Thanks Mary.

After trying several Hot Bacon Dressing recipies over the past few months, I think we finally found a winner!  My husband loved the flavor, and I was happy with the ingredient list and ease of preparation.  It even re-heated very well.

This is a very tasty dressing and I served it over spinach salad. My family said it was a keeper. I changed a couple things as I was making this recipe. I only used 3/4 cup sugar and added 2 tbsp. bacon drippings as suggested by another reviewer. I also read reviews on this recipe saying it became very thick. I don't believe this is suppose to be a thick dressing. I cooked the dressing over  medium heat, stirring contantly until the sugar was melted and continued cooking for only a couple minutes more. It turned out perfect.

As a restaurant owner/chef I can tell you that this is a recipe easily done to your taste. I use 1/2 cup Splenda and one Tbl. of sugar, as we have high risk for diabetes. It's ok to sprinkle precooked bacon to top, but finely chopped, thin bacon cooked well gives you the base you need. I remove bacon and drain, adding to the grease finely diced sweet onion (vidalia or Texas A&M 1016?) I strain off all but 1/4 cup grease.  Too much sugar will turn thick or candied if not watched carefully. Melt sugar over low heat, then bring to a boil. Once boiling, remove from fire.  If you want it thicker, place on heat and add cornstarch at 1/4 tsp at a time, waiting for thickening to happen. I add apple cider vinegar at the end, one Tbl or less at a time. You can always add more but you can't remove easily. Write it down when perfect for you. Sugar or Splenda can be added to taste. We used this dressing over mixed greens, spinach chiffonade, diced white meat chicken, thin sliced almonds or slivered, and fresh quartered strawberries. This way, you get protein, greens, nuts and sweet.
I have the world's best Poppyseed Dressing which I use over mixed greens, diced chicken, Craisins, sliced almonds, finely diced onions. Yes, I share. It's great over mixed fruit also. Melon balls, cantaloupe, kiwi, grapes, strawberries....but pick your fav. Mix.

Delicious!  The only thing I do different it cut up the bacon before I fry it.  That way I don't have to crumble.  It seperates as it fries and the quality is much better!

I found that the recipe wasn't specific enough and didn't explain when to stop reducing. I ended up with bacon caramel. It might have been me being a twit, but I usually don't have trouble doing a recipe for the first time. More detail would be helpful.

This took a little time to prepare, but was well worth it. When you get so tired of the traditional "store bought" dressings, this is a different and yet tasty dressing. Our family enjoyed it on a regular salad! Thanks for the recipe! Its under our "favorites'!

This is a good recipe, but it could've been more specific on how long to cook it. Mine turned out very thick. Very sweet too- add less sugar? Overall it was good and I will try it again.

Fantastic!  Per our reviewers, I did reduce sugar to 1 cup and add about 3 Tbsp of bacon drippings.  Honestly, I'll probably reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup next time, because it was still a little too sweet for my tastes.  I may try with red wine vinegar just to see how that turns out and maybe to see if the pop of color looks better.  Served over spinach salad with toppings on the side for a "build your own salad" bar... cranberries, almonds, croutons, bacon, etc.  Great recipe!

Very nice dressing. It was easy to make and tasted fantastic. I would like to try the balsamic vinegar and a little less sugar next time... but would not hesitate to make it again the exact same way either. Thanks for sharing!!  I just made this again using real bacon bits to save time. Worked out great! Also - the balsamic vinegar is a MUST! YUM! YUM!

Different and pretty good. I think I prefer a lighter less sweet dressing though. Seems to stick like glue to the greens...maybe I cooked it too long.

This is your basic oil, vinegar, sugar recipe with a hint-o-bacon. What makes this dressing is what you put in the salad. I used spinach, red onion, fresh garden tomatoes, some hard cooked egg and crumbled the bacon on top instead of in the dressing. Very good.

Great recipe, changed it up a bit by cutting the sugar to 3/4 cup as suggested by another  viewer, added 1 tlb.sp of brown sugar & 1-2 tlbs. of bacon drippings, cut the cornstarch by 1 tsp. so it wouldnt thicken too much. Poured it over spinach salad.. Yum
thanks for sharing.

I agree that the amount of cooking time was vague, but the recipe is wonderful!!   I used it as the main salad dressing at my daughters' baby shower and was highly praised.  I will keep this recipe and use often.  Great job Mary!!

We had this fabulous bacon dressing at a five star restaurant and since then I have been trying to find a recipe that comes close to it.  This is IT.  I only gave it four stars because I tweaked it a bit after reading the other reviews.  I only used 1 cup of sugar(may cut it down even more in the future) and added some of the bacon grease which gave it a wonderful flavor.  Just make sure you stir constantly, low heat, and don't over cook it.  When the sugar is melted then it is done.  Thanks for the recipe.  Will make again.

This was a delicious recipe. I also cut down on the sugar and put 3/4 of a cup- I could have even reduced it a bit more. Also I just took the bacon and crumbled it onto the salad which was great!

I didn't give it 5 stars only because of the sugar content.  I altered the recipe to only 1/2 cup sugar and used cider vinegar instead.  This with some almonds, roasted red peppers and shrimp tossed with spinach leaves was the most amazing salad!  We love Applebee's salad so much and we can't be happier to have found a dressing that comes so very close!  Thank you!

After reading other reviews I decided to cut the sugar in half.  I still found it a little too sweet, but close to what I had wanted.  Pretty good, though.  I'll definitely try it again.

This dressing was fantastic!  My boyfriend and I were in need of a change from the same old Italian dressing that we have almost every night.  We had it over baby spinach leaves with sliced mushrooms, red onion and feta cheese.  Delish!

Excellent, but only cook about 10 minutes or it's too thick when it cools.

Good basic hot bacon dressing, but for my tastes it needs a little tweaking.  I like really sweet stuff, but this is a little too sweet even for me.  I'll cut down the sugar by 1/3 to 1/2 next time.  I made it with packaged real bacon pieces and white wine vinegar.  Great on a fresh spinach salad with a little red onion and fresh ground pepper.

Great dressing!  I will be making this again.  I would like to try less sugar next time.  I also cut the bacon into pieces before I cooked it.  Be patient while waiting for the dressing to thicken.  I read the reviews that said their's never did thicken.  Mine took about 45 minutes from beginning to end - longer than the recipe calls for.  THanks for sharing!

Terrific! Better than Marie Callender's hot bacon dressing! I know it's super sugary and fatty but you don't need much dressing to make your salad extra special. My family relished every bite. Additional note: I've made this again and again. It tastes different--even better--using cider vinegar, rice vinegar or balsamic. All good. And it is just fabulous tossed with cooked, halved brussels sprouts! (Cut in half and steam or boil in water until cooked.)My husband used to hate brussel sprouts, but now he loves them! Oh and yes, cut back on sugar and do add the bacon grease!

Outstanding salad! I used spinach leaves, leaf lettuce, walnuts,hard boiled egg slices, bacon crumbles, pineapple tidbits, mandarin oranges, and shredded cheese.  The dressing mixture didn't seem to thicken much at all but it was absolutely delicious.

I substitute the cider vinegar for red wine vinegar, red onion slices sauteed with the sliced mushrooms in the leftover bacon grease briefly to tenderize.  I add croutons and sliced boiled egg to the spinach.  You have to wait until the last minute before serving and toss the dressing quickly so the spinach won't be so mushy.  This is called wilted salad dressing also because when tossed hot on lettuce or spinach, it wilts the leaves.  The options are endless for whatever you like in your spinach salad.

I used Spenda instead of sugar (a little less than called for as Splenda tends to be sweeter than sugar) and 1/2 Red Wine and 1/2 Balsamic vinegar instead of White. JUST LOVED IT!!

We LOVED this dressing...it is just like the one from Applebee's.  I took the advice from other reviewers and reduced the sugar.  I used 3/4 cup of sugar, and 2 tsp of corn starch, and I think the sweetness was perfect...not too vinegary and not too sweet.  I think any more sugar would have been too sweet.  We also added about 1/2 of a sauteed onion.  We are DEFINITELY making this again.

This is a great simple recipe...as written, a little bland for our tastes, but that's all personal preference.  To spice it up a bit I added a little extra seasoning salt (Alpine Touch, which has MSG as a flavor enhancer), some white wine vinegar, a dribble of apple cider vinegar (finished off the bottle), some bacon drippings, and about 1/2 c finely chopped sweet onion.  Delicious either way!

This was OK, but not really what I was looking for.  Neither my husband or children cared for it.  I enjoyed the salad enough, but just wasn't impressed with the dressing...too much corn starch, I think.  It was too thick..too jellied from the cornstarch.  I might try again, but tweek it to my liking more.

Fantastic!  I did lower the amount of sugar to only one cup (instead of 1 1/2 cups).  After I started to heat it I felt there was too much bacon so I just made another batch of the dressing....worked out perfectly.

We mmm'd and aaah'd our way through a wonderful spinach salad, and the dressing did taste great. That being said, this recipe is just too sweet for our tastes to use again without a big modification to the sweetener aspect - even though I cut back on the sugar to 1 cup (and added a dollop of honey). Next time I'll use half a cup raw sugar, 1/4 cup honey. Of course I may have to experiment with adding a bit more water & cornstarch to get the consistency right, but that's what us kitchen mad scientists live for... Thanks, Mary!

This was a little too sweet for me, but we didn't have any trouble eating it all! Next time I'll cut back on the sugar and we will have it again. Thanks for the recipe. Edited - I did cut back on the sugar and added some bacon grease. We like it kinda thick so it simmered for quite a while, but is definitely the taste I was looking for.

A1 recipe, I love it.  I am diabetic so I used granulated Splenda and I ran out of white vinegar so I substituted with red wine vinegar.  It was really good to.

This was delicious! I added about a teaspoon of the bacon drippings and instead of using only white vinegar, I used about 1/4 c white vinegar and 1/4 c apple cider vinegar.  I served over a spinach salad with honey roasted pecans and cranberries.  Will definitely be making this again!

Used thick cut peppercorn bacon.  After cooking I tipped the pan to let the fat drain but left a tiny bit that contained most of the pepper. No salt and I cut back on sugar a bit and had to use cider vinegar as I was out of white.

"Now this is my kind of salad dressing!"  is what hubby said.  You know, sometimes the simplest things in life are the best.  This recipe is one of those things.  Bacon, vinegar, sugar - fabulous!  I kept a little of the bacon drippings in the pan, reduced the sugar by a third, and served it over fresh baby spinach.  It was the highlight of our meal!

This dressing was very easy to make and it tastes exactly like the Applebee's dressing which is what I was trying to recreate!  I only used 2 bacon slices and cut them up prior to cooking.  I also cut the sugar back to 1 cup which worked well.  It got much thicker upon sitting so I might take it off the heat a little sooner next time so it wasn't as sticky at the end of the meal.  I grilled up some shrimp and tossed them and the dressing with some fresh baby spinach and it was great!

This was absolutely fantastic!  I served it over a spinach salad for Father's Day and every drop was GONE!  I added chopped hard boiled egg, gorgonzola cheese and craisins to the salad and it was such a wonderful blend of sweet, tart and tangy!  I can't stress how easy it was, I was a bit intimidated when I first started making it, but no worries, it's simple, quick and no fuss!  I did read other reviews and cut way back on the sugar, I only used half a cup and 2 tablespoons.  Other than that, I didn't alter a thing!  This is an excellent way to eat your spinach LOL!

I was looking for a recipe to use up a head of cabbage I had when I came across this recipe.  I haven't had this in 20 YEARS!!  It's amazing how food can bring back memories.  I remember being at a friend's house when she made this for us.  I LOVED it then and am so glad I found it again!  She served it over steamed cabbage.  I couldn't wait to steam the cabbage so I put the dressing over it raw!  One note of caution I only used the amount of sugar to taste.  Start with a small amount and add more if needed because it can get too sweet.

It was very good.  I was suprised by how easy it really was.  For some reason, I  thought that this would be more work.  I added a few hot pepper flakes to give it a little zip.  I made half the recipe and still had way too much.  It goes futher than you think - don't drown the greens with too much dressing.  I will certainly use this one again.  I used the thick pepper bacon and didn't crumble it very much - I liked the added flavor.   Very good - worth trying

Really great dressing!!! Its got a sweet taste.  I tweaked the amount of sugar and cornstarch, and it turned out PERFECT!!!

Also I let it get cold in the frige for a few hrs, and then reheat it in the microwave for about 30 sec.  then it didn't wilt the spinach and was perfect and warm!!!!

This is the best hot bacon dressing ever! The only changes I made were the reduction of sugar to 3/4 cup and adding the bacon grease - both suggested by another reviewer and I used apple cider vinegar instead of white.  Absolutely wonderful!  My husband will now eat spinach salad.  I wish I had taken a pic but I forgot.  We had spinach salad with leftover steak sliced on top and avocados, cherry tomatoes and glazed pecans and gorgonzola cheese. Yum!

adore this recipe on dandelion with hard boiled egg.  brings me back my pre-kindergarten days when I used to go out in spring w/ my grandmother to collect fresh dandelion before it started to bloom. the new leaves were tender and not too bitter. we'd cut them out at root w/ a red handled paring knife and then my job was to wash and dry it in her huge enamel sink while grandma made the dressing.

Used one cup of sugar instead of 1 1/2 cups but was still very sweet. I used this on a dandelion salad so this dressing helped offset the bitterness.  I will make this again using even less sugar next time.

I absolutely loved this recipe!  I did cheat and use the "real bacon" from the jar and it was still great!  I can only imagine how good it would have been with fresh bacon.  I do wonder how long it would last in the refrigerator?  I'd like to make it Sunday night and eat it all week, but I don't know if it would go bad.

This for me wasn't the best hot bacon dressing I have ever tried.  I like the kind with onions as well as the bacon.  I also like the sweet and tangy taste of most hot bacon dressing has.  This one  was not as bitey as I like.  The search will continue.

I used an equal amount of white sugar and cider vinegar.  Cubed and boiled a red potato and mixed that with the bacon dressing.  Then I mixed in baby spinach and wilted it with the warm dressing & potatoes.  This salad tasted like German Potato Salad but with the added spinach nutrition!

Served this last night over a simple spinach salad and really enjoyed it.  I cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup and subbed cider vinegar.  I did not add salt since bacon is already salty enough for us.  I used a bit of the bacon grease for flavoring and sprinkled the bacon on the salad rather than mixed in the dressing.  It was very simple and will use again.  May try it with balsamic vinegar next time.

This was great and I think a lot like Applebees.  I only used 1 1/4 cups sugar, some of the bacon grease and added a little more cornstarch since it didn't seem to get thick.  I served it over spinich with grilled shrimp and chopped red onion, roasted red pepper and toasted almond slices.  UMMMM.  I will be making this a lot!  Thanks for the recipe.  Now I don't have to go to Applebees to satisfy my craving.

I used turkey bacon to cut down on the fat and cholesterol in this recipe, and it turned out great! I also substituted flour for cornstarch (I was out) with excellent results. I doubled the recipe because my garden is overflowing with spinach and I ended up only adding one cup of sugar based on the advice of other reviewers; however, it probably could have used a bit more sugar as it turned out on the sour side. This is a keeper for sure!

My husband said this was "outstanding" and he's pretty particular, especially with salads....I served this dressing (using only 1/2 the sugar per other reviews and adding a little of the bacon grease to it) over spinach leaves, tomato, hard-boiled egg, a little feta cheese and candied pecans (sounds like a strange combination but it was an excellent blend of flavors.)  Thanks for a great dressing!

This stuff is soooooo delicious!!  We loved it!  Based on some of the reviews, I did cut back the sugar to just one cup and I'm glad I did.  It was the perfect amount of sweetness, and I'm afraid the extra half of a cup would've made it just a little too sweet for me.  I used balsamic vinegar instead of white simply because that's all I had on hand but it worked wonderfully.  I also added a good bit of the bacon grease to the mixture just  because I love bacon and wanted as much of the bacon flavor as possible. We loved it so much when I first made it for on a spinach salad, that just a couple days later I made the bacon dressing again to put on some baked salmon that I made and we loved it like that as well!! I know some reviewers stated that they weren't sure about the thickness, and I think this is supposed to be more like a vinaigrette type dressing, not real thick. This recipe is a keeper for sure!

I was having trouble finding this dressing in the stores. I came across this one and will never again buy this dressing in the store again! It is so simple and so much more flavorful!

Cut the sugar to 3/4 cup and added a tablespoon of the bacon fat back in.  Terrific recipe!  Served over spinach salad made with 1 bag fresh spinach, red, orange and yellow bell peppers, coarsely chopped, sliced white button mushrooms and 5 hard boiled eggs sliced into wedges.  Absolutely delicious!  Thank you for sharing!

This was really good. The only thing I did differently was using 1/2 sugar and 1/2 stevia. Served with Citrus Salmon in Parchment and Oven-Roasted Asparagus.

I wasn't really a fan of Hot Bacon Dressing but I knew my husband liked it. This was fantastic. Even my 3, 5, and 7 year olds loved it. Will make this again and again. Pimientos not needed.

I think this recipe is as close as you can get to Applebees Warm Bacon Dressing without going there. It is delicious on spinach salad. I reduced the sugar to 1 cup and let it simmer for about 12-15 minutes. Remember, the longer you simmer, the more it will take on the consistency of syrup. Oh I used a mixture of red wine vinegar and white vinegar. You won't be disappointed .

Tasted just like the dressing my Grandparents used to make.  Delicious!  Like some other reviewers I cut the sugar to 1 cup, but kept everything else the same.  I served over fresh spinach with hard cooked egg and sunflower seeds.  Will be a staple recipe for us!!

I have made this several times, reducing the sugar to 1-cup and adding ½ of a medium sized onion, sautéed in the bacon drippings until brown crisp on the edges. This is also excellent on green beans.

Very tasty dressing for a spinach salad.  I'll have to cut the recipe in half the next time I make it because it does not reheat well at all after a few days in the fridge.

Excellent recipe!  I needed one with a little less sugar so I reduced the 8 serving amount to 1/3 cup.  The recipe still worked & tasted great - just keep in mind the reduction time takes a little longer when you do this.

This is a great dressing to put on a spinach salad. I agree with many that the sugar should be cut way back. I used 1/4 c sugar and 1/4 c "splenda" the second time I made this, and it was so much better! I'll use this dressing many times this summer, Thanks.

WOW what a great recipe. I read the reviews and cut down on the amount of sugar used to 1 cup. Next time I make this I will use 3/4 cup instead of 1 cup, but this dressing was an excellant blend of flavors.  I also added chopped red onions as I cooked the bacon pieces and used balsamic vinegar, poured it over baby spinach and it was delicious. I will be making this again and again.

I took the suggestions of other reviewers and cut the sugar down.  I let it cool for about 20 mins before serving it over a spinach salad so it didn't wilt the spinach and served fresh crumbled feta over the top for that salty/sweet combo.  Perfect!

SO good. I did cut back on the sugar. I poured this over a spinach salad with crumbled goat cheese and candied walnuts. Amazing.

This is excellent!!  I made 12 servings, used the entire pound of bacon, boiled some eggs, I had to many, six would be good. I mixed it with spinach just before we ate.  Everyone loved it and had seconds. I will be making this again and again and again, need I say more?  Mary, thanks for the recipe!

Delicious!!! Listened to other reviewers and added bacon drippings, cut the sugar and cornstarch and just sprinkled bacon pieces from the pouch. Poured this over spinach leaves from a bag and feta cheese sprinkles. Thank you.

Took a long time to thicken - use less water?  Also, no remaining hint of vinegar once it cooked down  -  add the vinegar after it begins to thicken?

Love, love, love HBDressing!  I'm from PA and we also use this as a "gravy" over cut/steamed or mashed potatoes.  Hubby loves it.  PS: When used as gravy, I add chopped endive at the end until wilted before serving. (Hubby's Mom used lettuce instead of endive, but I find lettuce makes it too sweet.)

Very simple and everyone loved it.  I served it on mixed greens once and on spinach the next time.  I will confess that I didn't drain the bacon...I poured the vinegar, sugar and water in the pan I cooked the bacon in.  I reduced the recipe for just 2 people so there wasn't that much bacon grease.

I thought for sure I misread the 1 and 1/2 cups sugar because it turned to stone. The dressing latched on to the bacon & it was terrible. I don't know where I went wrong but I will never make it again.

Reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup, used apple cider vinegar, and added 1TBS of the bacon fat.    If it becomes to thick, add a little water to thin it.  The whole family liked it.

I personally think it was too sweet.  Not sure how to make it any different though.  It was good. Maybe more vinegar or a flavored vinegar instead of just white

Overall not a bad dressing. I followed some of the other reviews. I cut back 1/2 c sugar. Still too sweet. Def cut  some more. I didn’t have cornstarch so I used flour. Worked just fine. I used 4t instead of the 3 and I used 2T of the bacon drippings. I cut the vinegar in 1/2 as well. I will need to check my other recipe I use. For some reason this was too caramelized. Very sticky. But it was good and it was quick! :D

Excellent!  Quick & easy!  I did cut back on the sugar - made only 1/2 recipe for 2 people.  I did leave a bit of the bacon drippings in the pan.  Added purple onions, tomatoes, hard boiled eggs & avocado.  My husband said it was the best salad he's ever had!  We'll be having this once a week!

Super tasty and easy!! I went a healthier route, cut back on the sugar and used just 1 cup of coconut sugar. Plenty sweet enough but not over the top sweet.

Cut the sugar in half and was still way too sweet. Also, didn't have cornstarch so elimated it and just a thinner dressing, which was good.

Fabulous! My changes were as follows.  I went from using 1-1/2 cups of sugar to 3/4  cup of Splenda and 3/4 cup of sugar.  I also added 1 tabl.  of fine cut red onion to the hot grease after removing the bacon and then proceeding  with the original recipe.  I didn't use just spinach, because of what I had on hand, and used a variety of mixed greens.....so so good!

1 1/2 cups sugar? Maybe a typo. Sorry, I did not care for this recipe.

The flavor is great. I'm not sure but I think I cooked too long. It was more like caramel than dressing.

It was too sweet for us. By the time it finally thicken up it was like  corn syrup and turned hard when I poured it over the salad. The favor is nice ...maybe I'll try it over corn muffins.

I really like this recipe although it is really sweet!!! I plan on making it again but cutting down the sugar by at least half a cup. I also added a quarter cup balsamic vinegar and it gave it a great flavor.

I adjusted the serving size down to 2 and doubled the bacon. Cooked the dressing as described but I basically made bacon taffy. It cooled and thickened so much that my spinach stuck together and the dressing was chewy. Not exactly what you're looking for in a salad dressing. Otherwise, it had a good flavor. I'll probably try this again but decrease the sugar and cook for less time.

This is good. I do cut the sugar in half. I chop the bacon before cooking to save on time. I drain the bacon grease and make the dressing in the same pan along with the bacon. I've served over spinach and romaine and both taste great. I also add blue cheese to the salad which really compliments the flavors.

YUM! It was very very good! It reminds me of the hot bacon salad at Applebees. I cut the sugar down some and served it over spinach.  Next time I will add grilled shrimp and other salad toppings to re create the one at applebees.

This is good.  I decided to make this when I had fresh spinach and knew (rather, thought) I had a few slices of bacon in the refrigerator.  When I got everything out, I realized the bacon was a little too old and couldn't be used.  I decided to go ahead, and as a testament to just how good this recipe is, I simply added "real bacon" bacon bits once the dressing was heated through and it was still very good.  I can only imagine how much better it would be with real cooked bacon.   Some may find it a bit sweet, but I liked it.

Absolutely perfect for the massive amounts of spinach coming out of my garden this time of year.  My husband calls it "candied spinach".  We like the sweetness so we make the recipe as is, but the amount of sugar could easily be reduced.  The recipe yields a generous amount that is easily reheated for a few minutes over low heat.  Yummy!

I think this was a good base for a recipe but was a little bland and very sweet. I guess I reduced it too much b/c it was very sticky and hard once it cooled. Next time I will definitely half the sugar and add onion and maybe some other spices.

This was the first time I made hot bacon dressing for a spinach salad I made for New Years Eve dinner. It was great. I followed the other reviewers suggestions and cut the sugar in half and used only 2 tbsp of cornstarch. This made it less sweet and more of a thin consistency. It was really great. My boyfriend was in absolute HEAVEN.

Really good on a simple spinach salad. I will definitely make it again.  I reduced the sugar to 1 cup. I also added the liquid mixture to the pan I cooked the bacon in (leaving the drippings in the pan). I then added the crispy bacon to the salad. This makes WAY more than I needed for a salad for 4 people. I will halve it next time for the same size salad.

I made this dressing for a green bean and tomato salad for a brunch. Everyone loved it and could not stop eating it. I might use a little less sugar though and a bit more cornstarch as mine did not thicken up as much as I would like.

Sorry, I didn't much care for this recipe.  I cut down the sugar to 1/2 cup, as others suggested, but the end result was just way to vinegary and sugary for my taste.  I do like the hot bacon dressings served at restaurants, so I think I'll keep looking.

We had this last night for the first time. I had never heard of a dressing like this. It was good but not somthing I think I would want often. Nice change for an occasional treat. I used 1 cup of sugar and 1/2 cup Splenda but I think I would cut back to 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup Splenda next time. We served ours over lettuce wedges.

This was a really good dressing, except I followed everyones advice and cut down on the sugar.  I used 1/2 cup and it was plenty sweet.  Otherwise I did everything else according to the recipe.  Next time I think I will try and add some sauted scallions to it. I used this dressing on top of a spinach and blue cheese salad.  Very yummy.

I had this dressing at our country club and loved it.  I wanted to make my own so tried a few different recipes and this one was an exact match and definately the best!!

Cooked water out of fresh mushrooms and drained.  Added mushrooms to bacon just before done and continued to saute.  Only used 2/3 cup sugar and still sweet enough.  Next time I'll try 1/2 cup.  Excellent over baby spinach leaves and chopped up hard boiled eggs.
