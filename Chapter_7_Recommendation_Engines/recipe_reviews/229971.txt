I've had this dish several times now and it's always fantastic & a crowd-pleaser. It has just the right amount of crunch thanks to the pecans and the whiskey nicely rounds out the flavor profile.

This was a great new side to try! I followed it as written. I wish a little more of the whiskey had cooked off for myself. However, don't let this scare you away! I loved it and will make it again.
