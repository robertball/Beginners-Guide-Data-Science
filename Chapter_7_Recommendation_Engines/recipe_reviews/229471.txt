I used a  premade crust and it came out great.  I followed the directions and it was a big hit! Having a re pie made for using Truvia is very helpful when you are trying to control your sugar intake. Thanks.

I didn’t have the specified sweetener but instead used Splenda (Aprriva). It’s the same thing really. I made for my family that is diabetic and they gave me great reviews on this! I am sure to make this again for my family and it’s now a recipe they all will be making for themselves regularly. Great recipe!!
