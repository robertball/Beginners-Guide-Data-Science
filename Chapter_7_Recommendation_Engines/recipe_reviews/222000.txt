This is one of the first dishes my Italian MIL taught me to make!  She told me this was an important dish to know as it is tasty, very economical and you can clean out the fridge using up leftovers.  Boy was she right!  It is GREATt just as is.. all on its own.  During the summer, when our garden is overflowing, I sometimes add some grape tomatoes, eggplant or some zucchini and my favorite  - fresh basil!  I have made this using leftover chicken cutlets I diced up and made my food budget stretch a little farther.  Be sure to watch the garlic cooking time and be aware that there is some cooking water from the pasta that is to be added to the garlic when it is finished browning.  It is mentioned in the video and my MIL made SURE I knew to do that as it adds necessary moisture to the sauce.  I use at least a full ladle as I like it a bit more moist.  NOTE:  add the water slowly to avoid splattering! I made this last night and I added a cup of diced grape tomatoes and some crumbled bacon and topped with shredded fresh spinach.  Perfect summer meal.  My favorite is using sun dried tomatoes, spinach and fresh mozzarella.  Can't go wrong with this recipe!

This is so good and so easy!  If you watch the video he has you add a half ladle of pasta water to the OO-garlic saute pan.  This is important and is missing from the recipe.  This stops the garlic from over cooking and getting bitter and it also adds that extra moisture to the sauce.  I usually reserve some pasta water 'just in case'.   This recipe says it serves 4 but as a side dish ( which I did) it would easily serve 8 or even more.  I served this with sauteed green beans with prosciutto and Barber Chicken, Parmesan.  (I know, cheating but it was really good!) Enjoy!

I love this preparation for spaghetti. I used to the recipe from The Mediterranean Diet, and made it for years. I have adapted this recipe with elements of that one. For example, I add the parsley and chili flakes to the oil after the garlic has browned, and then also add a ladle of spaghetti water as it's cooking.

I usually forgo the cheese, simply because it's expensive back home in Canada and not readily available here in Tanzania. In place of it, I fancy it up with vegetables, either a handful of long green beans or asparagus. Both add a wonderful oomph to the dish. I add the veg once the garlic has browned, but before the pasta water.

This was excellent!  I have made it a few times, and I cook it a little differently each time.  I like to add shrimp, use extra garlic, add about 1-2 tablespoons of butter, and sprinkle about 1/3 cup of bread crumbs.  It is pretty much shrimp scampi on pasta when I get done.  (add the zest & juice of one lemon).  Also, I use less pasta/noodles to compensate for the thicker sauce, the addition of shrimp, and because I just love the sauce!

I made this after seeing it cooked on an Italian cooking show the other day. I have to be honest, this is way too oily for me. I think the servings on this recipe are incorrect also. As a lb of pasta is going to feed a minimum of 6 people. Even the bag said serves 8. At least I stretched groceries until the end of the week. Think, I will just stick to pasta with a little butter, similar to what I had growing up. It's basically the same concept. ty

1-5-2014: This was perfect Chef John! I loved the flavors of the garlic with the Italian parsley and cheese, with just a hint of the red pepper flakes. Who would have thought something so simple could make pasta this good. I tossed in some fresh steamed broccoli, which I found went good with this pasta. 8-17-2018: Still a very tasty recipe, but have found we prefer it with less oil. I reduce the amount of oil by half of what's called for. If you add in broccoli, I find a saute with fresh or roasted fresh broccoli brings out more flavor.

This was a staple in our family growing up, and it still is today! This is such a simple, yet delicious pasta that can be served as a main or side dish. This is also a super economical meal. We usually eat this as a main dish w/ a nice salad and crusty bread, but it's also nice along side chicken parmesan~YUM! :)

As my dad hailed from Italy, I grew up eating this dish at least once a week.   Now, w/my own family, I serve this as a side dish w/ pork chops, substituting the spaghetti w/ extra thin egg noodles.  Hubby who is a pasta critic loves it.

Finished the whole thing!!! So good! Doubled the red pepper. Forgot the parsley, but it was still great. Too much olive oil, will cut in half next time.

An outstanding side dish for shrimp or pork. I always use pasta that is imported from Italy because the bronze equipment that is used in Italy produces a rough texture to the pasta and that makes any sauce cling better to the pasta.

One of my favorite foods from childhood... We had an Italian neighbor who taught us this dish. I didn't know to add the water to the sauce, this recipe is an improvement over mine.

Great recipe and a wonderful flavor.  Once the oil and garlic are added to the pasta, it's easy to add any other cooked meat or vegetable to make the dish even more savory.  as one commenter noted, it's a great way to use up left overs.  Yummmmm.

needed something quick, and this did the trick. It was very delicious. I used Angel Hair Pasta. I had it with some frozen mussels I prepared it separately.  So good, and had it with some Reisling. OMG! I loved it. Can't wait to start adding it with veggies.

Chef John has posted many very good recipes and this in another tasty one but....it is not traditional. I was raised in a Italian family and watched everyone from relatives and friends to some great chefs make aglio e olio and this is the difference in their method and his....the timing of the sauce is very important. Yes ,you do brown the garlic in good olive oil and yes, it must not be overcooked as it will get bitter but native Italians add 1/2 C of pasta water no more than 2 minutes after the pasta was added (this assures just the right amount of starch) to the garlic and oil. The timing is important so add the pasta to boiling water, then begin sauteing the garlic and two minutes in...add the pasta water to create a garlic broth that is then simmered on low heat until the pasta is ready. Try it! (It is also considered authentic to add a sprinkling of red pepper flakes to the garlic and oil before the water is added it spiciness  is  desired.)

Being married to an Italian, this recipe is on regular rotation in our home. It's what we eat when we come home from vacation, and there is no food in the house from being away. It's what we eat when we are tired from a long day of work and haven't thought about dinner until it's about time to eat it! The only thing we do slightly different is add the peperoncini to the garlic and olive oil mixture and let it cook a bit, and then add the pasta directly into the aglio/olio/peperoncino sauce and mix it in the pan before serving. It's quick, easy and delicious!

I just made this to revive some leftover spaghetti and it was fabulous. I usually try to follow the exact steps that a recipe calls for, but this time I couldn't bring myself to pour the entire 1/2 cup of olive oil into the spaghetti, so I fished all the garlic out of the skillet and poured in half the prescribed amount of oil. It tasted delicious but still a little too oily for my taste. However, I do think it's necessary to toast the garlic in a lot of oil to ensure it does not burn, so the method in this recipe is key to perfecting this dish. As for the quantities, they can be adjusted to individual taste. 4.5/5

This is a pasta staple in our house. My husband doesn't do so well with tomato sauces, so this is an fantastic alternative. My suggestion? Don't go easy on the garlic.

Loved this recipe. The smell of the garlic roasting in the kitchen was heavenly. Used an entire bulb of garlic, we are garlic fans - this made a big garlic flavour! Followed the advice from other reviews, and added sun dried tomatoes once the garlic was done for an extra kick. As mentioned in the video, use some of the pasta water in the sauce before serving - this takes away from an oily texture. This is a new favourite recipe.

It is soooooo good! I'm eating some right now, except I didn't have fresh parsley. I just sprinkled a little italian seasoning in when it was still cooking. I also didn't have red pepper flakes, but that would have been really good in it. I also added one egg, and it made it really creamy, but I also tasted it before the egg, still just as good, I was just in the mood to make carbonara, but my bacon was bad :[. Super good, everyone should have this in their repertoire, because you can do so many things with it. And it's cheap and easy and quick to make.

So simple and absolutely delicious!  I used penne pasta since that's all I had and it picked up the flavour of the sautéed garlic wonderfully.  I used slightly less oil than the recipe recommended.

Once I got the hang of it, this became my favourite quick pasta recipe. For a light lunch for one, I follow the serving size of the pasta bag (80-100g) and reduce the oil from 60 mL to 45, keeping the three-garlics-for-one-serving rule. If you are like me and don't have access to a good block of Parmigiano-Reggiano anywhere near your area, store-bought shaved or grated parm would do as long as they are relatively fresh. The dish can be thrown together in 10-15 minutes effortlessly, yet tastes wonderful and rustic. Thank you for the recipe!!

Divine!  I just made this for the first time.  I used angel hair pasta (and adjsted the cooking time to what was recommended on the box so the pasta was not overooked) and served it with shrimp.  Easy and so delicious.  I did add the butter to the pasta that is mentioned in the cook's note at the end.  Thanks to all the other reviewers for other ways to use this great dish.  And a huge thanks to Chef John for sharing this recipe.

I just made this tonight, and it was absolutely delicious!

This is definitely for more than 2 people though.  I'd say you could serve up to 5.

Next time, I will add the oil and garlic mixture to the pasta immediately after I drain the pasta, because the pasta got a little starchy while it sat.

Otherwise, delicious!

It tasted good, but I agree with some other reviewers that it is very oily. That may be alright for some, but I didn't like how it left my mouth area feeling coated in oil. I would also add some more cheese or something to make it more creamy, but that is just personal preference.

Oh my gosh, this was wonderful. I cut the portions back to 1 but still used 5 large cloves of garlic. I had some cooked, frozen clam and mussel meat that I wanted to use up so I added those at the end, just long enough to warm them. I also had shrimp to use so I cut those into thirds, the were very large, and sauted them just before adding the pasta. The pasta was cooked for 8 minutes before draining, I retained a 1/2 cup of the cooking water that I added to the skillet after adding the pasta. This will be a repeat at our house!

I substituted minced garlic for fresh garlic gloves and dried parsley for the Italian parsley, since I didn't have those ingredients. Although I'm not a big garlic fan, this was delicious and easy to make!

I would say it was pretty good, but not worth all the attention you have to give to the garlic. I used a whole bulb of garlic, which is more than suggested, and it still didn’t really taste all that garlicky. It was a little better leftover, but I wouldn’t say it was amazing.

Yea! One of my favorite Italian restaurants makes a dish they call Pollo Pepperone. It's basically this, with chicken and peppers. I was so happy to find this recipe and be able to recreate my favorite restaurant meal at home. My only change was that I sauteed some Italian roaster peppers with the garlic (and added the pasta water, as indicated in the video). Big fan! So happy!

I made this exactly as the recipe (and video) directed. I was so excited because I've been noticing a big fuss about Aglio e Olio lately and I'd never had it. I absolutely love garlic, so I thought it would be amazing. To be honest, it was just okay. It wasn't bad at all, but it was just kind of boring and I didn't get a huge garlic flavor with each bite. It was more like a garlic after taste. This recipe would probably appeal to people who like simple comfort dishes like buttered noodles or something. I like big and bold flavors and I thought this fell short.

Made this twice, once exactly as written and once according to the video.  I will not add the spoonful of water again as instructed in the video.  The first time was a perfect blend of oil to garlic to pasta.  The second, too watery and bland.  And if you make it as written, it's amazing and worthy of five stars.

The only change I made was not having parsley so I made it without.  It was amazing!  A word of warning, if it is getting late, and you think, this will be quick and easy.  Well that is true, but you will find yourself doing what I did, I ate it ALL!  I'm stuffed!  Okay, I did make a half recipe... but still.  

I will definitely be making this again.  :-)

**   Note
Made this again, and I would give it 6 stars if it were possible.  This is one of my favorite quick and fabulous meals.

We inhale this whenever one of us makes Spaghetti Aglio e Olio.  We seem to like this recipe the best.  My thirteen yr old asked me to show her how to make it so she could whip it up on her own.  It's  classic and will me a delicious fallback recipe for, well, ever.

Loved the recipe! So easy to make. I added basil and fresh tomatoes on mine just to put more freshness in it. Thanks Chef John!

Spaghetti Aglio e Olio is one of the most classic Roman side dishes and at one time considered a "peasant's or poor man's" dish. This recipe brings so many wonderful & vivid memories with my Italian family - after dancing, visiting with friends, watching/playing soccer, or after a movie, it was our favorite late night snack. It is especially wonderful & delicious served over homemade pasta.

Overall was good, but could have used some more flavor.  I'd add more garlic and maybe some fresh lemon juice next time.  Also, I only had dried parsley on hand, so maybe fresh would have made a difference.

I made this as close to the recipe as I could. I didn’t have fresh herbs so used dried, and substituted minced garlic from a jar, but it was still great. Hubby even said it was good and took seconds. Yummmy

Used leftover spaghetti and just added it to pan with garlic/ chili flake/ oil in it to reheat and serve. Sprinkled with nutmeg and lots of freshly ground black pepper.

Delicious! I added a little more red pepper flakes and added  some pasta water because that's what I do. It was a little oily, but it was still delicious. Next time, I will reduce the olive oil a little bit.

This was a great recipe, I ended up crisping the garlic, and then crumbled it over the top of the spaghetti, even my picky eater had seconds. I also cooked this with andouille sausage and Italian sausage on the side.

Pretty good for what it is. Very simple and tasted good. I went with the other reviewers and only used 1/4 cup of olive oil and it did not need more than that. I used a little more cheese than it said to.

I used pasta I had on hand & it was the most simplest yet the most delicious recipe I ever made w/garlic, loved it!!!  I’m also partial to garlic, I love anything that has garlic in it.

This has become our go-to pasta dish. Prepared as written it’s delicious. As an added plus, it doesn’t take nearly as long to prepare as indicated. I’ve made this several times now, and I can whip it together in under 15 minutes. The first time I prepared it I did it just as written. Over time I’ve modified the recipe. For anyone interested, I now do it with 8 to 10 good-sized leaves of fresh basil rather than parsley, and add two or three tablespoons of Olivio to the olive oil for extra richness. Any hard Italian cheese will work well, and I grind the pepper flakes in a mortar and pestle so they distribute better throughout the dish. The biggest change I’ve made is to add a bag of medium shrimp to the pan after I’ve sautéed the garlic. Once my well-drained spaghetti has been placed in the serving bowl, I add the salt, fresh-ground black pepper, pepper flakes, and basil and mix it well. Then I pour in the contents of the olive oil/Olivio, garlic, and shrimp pan, with the grated cheese last. Another good (but gentle) stir, and you’ve got a quick and easy meal that’s delicious enough to serve to company. As an added bonus, the leftovers actually heat up

The flavor of the fresh garlic and parsley was great, but it came out a little dry. Upon watching the video, he adds 1/2 ladle of pasta water to the garlic/ oil mix. This is omitted in the recipe and should help keep it from being too dry.

First time making this with an actual recipe. Turned out excellent. Way better than just "winging " the amount of ingredients AND the addition of the red pepper flakes doesn't add heat just flavor.  Thank you Chef John for another great recipe!

This was a delicious recipe.  The Parmigiano Reggiano cheese was pretty much the homerun for this one.  I think I used too much cheese though. :)

This is a great, delicious and relatively quick recipe. I served it as a side for pork chops. Then as leftovers, I stirred in pancetta--again yummy. I will definitely make this again.

I got pan hot and added some Chardonnay and reduced it then added 3 T butter and 3 T evoo and then garlic and let cook till garlic was fragrant. Also recipe is missing that you will need some of the pasta water to add with cheese to keep it from clumping. Very versatile as can add already sautéed veggies or proteins if desired. But the added wine gives dish a wonderful depth of flavor

Very good!  

I am a seafood nut so like to tweak this recipe now and add some clams! When I do this I use equal parts EVOO and butter and add a small chopped onion.

I really enjoyed the way the pasta tasted. My wife made some vegetables to accompany it and was superb. The garlic bread we also had ended up with a more strong garlic flavour. The only problem I had was that my garlic started toasting really fast. Make sure you keep a close eye on it! 10/10  Would make again.

As someone else said on this site that this was the first dish learned (by a mother in law) this was probably one of the first dishes I ever learned by my mother.  As a young bride 55 years ago this was the basis for many, many... an inexpensive meal, utilizing leftovers to the highest degree.  One of my favorites is adding 1/4 cup of diced pancetta (already sautéed to a crisp state) along with what ever other cup of diced cooked meat OR vegetable I have on hand, sometimes adding a quarter cup of cream!  Of course there is always that other trick where you sautéed a diced onion while trying to decide what to fix for dinner........inspiration always comes. try it you'll see!  I use pancetta a lot and always buy it by the pound, I then have the butcher divide it into four the I vacuum seal it and freeze so it is ready to use.

My kids absolutely loved this. They asked for seconds and thirds. Then they asked for it again the next day. So that's why I'm giving it a 5. It's easy to make and a good side for almost any meal.

This dish has become a family staple!  The recipe is great, just remember to add the pasta water mentioned in the video.  For a personal preference, I add shredded spinach to the oil and garlic, before the pasta water.   I also toss sauteed shrimp in when combining the sauce and pasta.  The whole family loves it, even my very picky 7 year old!

Most versatile recipe ever. I substituted almost the entire thing and still omg good. Canola oil not olive oil, stir fry noodles not spaghetti, everything but the cheese substituted and still great. Watch the video and don’t forget the pasta water or you will end up with oily sauce. Didn’t add veggies cause well I didn’t wanna take away from the simplicity. I will make this again

Update: I have made this no less than a dozen times. Most recently decided to add some peppers and onions to it. Wow. Just wow. This is so freakin addicting it’s unreal.

This was a nice change of pace to my usual pasta dishes. To make a full meal I added some extras - just whatever I had on hand. The dish allows for lots a variations, or as is for a side dish.

I have never made aglio e olio like this before.  Toasting the garlic in the oil makes this dish amazing!  But as others have said, you have to get the garlic just right.  When you do, the flavor will blow you away.  This is a really simple dish but it is delicious!

This is the third time, I tried an Italian. Came out very well. I added a small - sliced - capsicum which my husband wanted. My little daughter liked the spaghetti (mmmm... yummy ma...). ??. And my husband loved it too. The garlic turned out just as mentioned in the recipe. It was explained very well in the recipe. I've bookmarked this recipe which became my family's favourite.

This is an excellent, simple recipe as-is. We make this often. So much flavor with only a couple inexpensive ingredients. I agree with others about tossing some pasta water in. The serving sizes seem off (1 pound of pasta isn’t usually two servings.) It is also a great recipe to add on to change it up. I recommend adding crispy bacon, broccoli and fresh basil. Or pancetta and chicken for more protein.

It was probably around 1940 when I was weaned. I can't recall exactly when - I was very young at the time. It was very soon after that I began eating aglio e olio, or "i oi" which, as children, we found much easier to pronounce. I've been enjoying it ever since. 

At the time (40's to 70's), outside of our Italian community, pretty much no one knew about this wonderful dish. Serving a plate of this to the uninitiated invariably prompted a "Where's the sauce?" comment, but you can be sure they would enjoy it. I made it once while a guest of friends of Slavic descent. I didn't realize how much they *really* liked it until the next morning when I caught them in their bathrobes picking at the cold leftovers right from the fridge. 

It's so simple, but so delicious. I use olive oil, garlic (minced with a little salt), red pepper flakes, and parsley on my favorite string pasta, linguini. That's it. Although I always have a chunk of Parmigiano Reggiano handy, I have never used it on i oi, and never would.

A whole head of roasted garlic will give you the same result. Just wrap in foil, roast about 30-45 minutes at 300º and squeeze the garlic paste from the cloves.

This is an Italian staple and a great base to add other ingredients or leftovers.  A couple of observations: The written recipe does not include adding water to slow the cooking, if you don't use a larger than average frying pan, your garlic will not brown.  Chef John said the sauce would cook at the same rate as the spaghetti, approximately 9 minutes; I found the sauce took much longer.  I may have held the heat too low, end result, overcooked spaghetti.  The fresher your ingredients, the better the outcome..dah! Fresh garlic, and freshly grated Parmesan  will make a world of difference.  I like things a bit on the spicy side so I add the red pepper flakes at the beginning with the garlic and some (not a lot) of the pepper will infuse into the oil with the garlic.  I threw in some ham chunks and roasted asparagus into the oil toward the end, otherwise followed the recipe. Molto Buona.

Really great and easy. Only changes were I added scallions instead of parsley at end, I added a bit of pasta water to the sauce, and I cut down on the hot pepper flakes just a bit.

Used squid ink linguine and added langostino tails.  Erred in adding in parsley too late.  (Need to add it in with cheese to it has a chance to soften harshness of raw herb).   Video was SUPER helpful with regard to toasting garlic though!

This recipe is absolutely delicious! Very easy/quick as described, video was very helpful to show how to cook the garlic in the oil (Medium until bubbles, then Low/Medium until most pieces are just a bit browned). As the other reviews said, be sure to add 1/2 cup of water from the cooking pasta to the oil when the garlic is cooked, to arrest the cooking and also make it a sauce instead of oil, and guaranteed the dish will taste just like it was made in your favorite Italian restaurant!

Here are the few changes I made, thanks to John's video and other reviewer suggestions:
- Oil: 1/2 dry cup EVOO plus about 1/3 more of that measuring cup of Vegetable Oil; author John said he preferred reqular Olive Oil instead of the stronger EVOO so that's whay I blended oils, and the seeming larger volume is in large part because using a dry cup measure to measure oil will need about 20% more to equal a liquid cup measure.
- Added two ingredients I had on hand to the garlic oil, just before adding the water when the garlic was done (add anything you have on hand): part of a 4 oz. bag of fresh spinach (less than half, so about 2 cups), and also 1 plum tomato that was roughly diced.
- Added 2 tablespoons butter to the pasta right after it was cooked/drained.
- Added 1/2 dry cup water to the garlic oil when the garlic was cooked (see the video), just after adding the tomato & spinach
- Added just 2/3 cup of Kraft Parmesan cheese, 1/3 cup at a time (recipe calls for a full cup), after mixing th

This was so easy to make, and so delicious!  You need to watch the video to make sure you don't leave out the water from the spaghetti, otherwise it might be dry.  I would make this again.  I'd pair it with salmon or shrimp, for a perfect meal.

The only change I made was adding raw shrimp to the olive oil garlic mixture while it was cooking. I started the garlic as per the instructions, and added the shrimp in the last 10 minutes the oil and garlic cooked. It was a big hit, my girl loved it and I have some left overs for lunch!

I had forgotten this wonderful dish, My mother was first generation Italian and growing up we had it every few weeks or so, my father hated anything garlic so she made it for  herself and us kids, This recipe is spot on and I now realize this basic recipe lends itself for a variety of other ingredients.

This was a very good, follow the video instructions to make it PURRRRFECTLY. The cooking water added to the sauted garlic seals the deal from making it bitter and overcooked...great point. Enjoy everyone!

Excellent recipe.  Make sure you catch the part in the video about adding a ladle or two of the pasta water to the garlic and oil mixture. This is critical to the success of the dish. Also critical but not mentioned in this particular version of the recipe is using sea salt in the pasta water.  A generous helping of it.  It really makes a difference. I didn't think hubby would like this since it's not your usual red meat sauce spaghetti but he did.  Quite a lot!  I did too.  Adding to my recipe stash!

I added a little extra cheese and a tablespoon of butter when tossing, also added some of the noodle water to the oil when it was done. 4 hungry people were disappointed that there was none left over! We will definitely be having this again.

Enjoyed this recipe; however, as some reviewers noted, the amount of pasta per servings is incorrect. I added a few large shrimp, some bread crumbs and scant bit of fresh lemon juice. This is a very easy weeknight meal.......and the garlic should scare away any viruses if you feel you may be coming down with a cold bug (I'm keeping my fingers crossed on this one).

I'm learning to cook (at age 55!), found myself thinking of pasta, and thinking I should be able to manage this dish! Didn't have parsley, so found a tomato in my fridge and used that! Worked well enough. Didn't use cheese as I wanted a non-dairy version. Had durum wheat spaghetti in my pantry so was really happy with the dish! Directions and video were great - very clear; I watched it a few times as I was preparing the dish!

Great recipe!  Reserve some pasta water as Baking Nana suggested along with a couple of others.  This was delicious.  As noted this makes way more than four servings.  Next time I will halve the recipe.  Thanks Chef John!

This is one of the best and easy dishes to make and gorgeous to eat. Amazing flavor from the browned garlic, Olive oil and Parmesan cheese. I combined a bit of fresh basil along with parsley for the lemony fresh taste. It is awesome and I will make it again. Thanks to the chef and to allrecipes.com.
One note: Add Parmesan when the past is still hot. Secondly, adding 2/3 of what recipe calls for was enough. Adding full masks the taste of all the other ingredients in my view.  2/3 of oil would be good too.

It was great. I haven't made this in awhile,  so had to check the recipe, I forgot how much olive oil to use. It's a nice change from pasta and sauce. I added some shredded chicken breast and steamed broccoli. Yummy!

Added a bit of butter, cayenne, lots of eggplant and tomatoes, and strips of dory fish fillet. Tastes fantastic! My son loved it. Will definitely make this again.

Will definitely make this one again and again!! Easy to make, just watch the garlic cooking time. Wonderful flavor and not as heavy as spaghetti with sauce. Loved it!!

Wow, what a great simple meal. I was cooking for just myself, so I wanted something easy. This was perfect! I felt like I was Scarlett Johannson taking a bite when JonFavreau cooks for her in the movie "Chef".

This recipe needs to have lesssoil and garlic. It was just too much oil for me- and with less oil and garlic this would be better.  I made this recipe as instructed but next time it will be great when I use less olive oil and less garlic. 
It was extremely strong tasting but I happened to have had a light summer pasta sauce full of veggies so with this sauce on top of it the dish was really nice.

I was somewhat surprised at how much the cheese cost.  $20.00 a lb, got a wedgie for $9.90, grated it as per the recipe and have some left over for another meal.  I followed the recipe and didn't change a thing.  Was able to toast the garlic and believe me it came out perfect for my first time making. I used this as not the main meal but as a side dish.  PERFECT.

This is very good, although it is a rather bland recipe I would suggest a generous drizzle of good olive oil before serving and plenty of fresh ground pepper....delicious !

I made it a point to know how to make this really well after eating this as a kid growing up in Boston. It was made by my "third grandma" who was directly from Italia and spoke to my sisters and me only in Italian. The different method I use is to dump the spaghetti directly onto the pan with the olive oil, garlic and pepper flakes when just about done and mix it well in there. Almost like the cacio e pepe.

Everyone - adults and kids - liked this dish.  Peeling and slicing the garlic took a while.  Might be worth buying pre-peeled garlic if making for a big group again.

Absolutely loved it.  Make it all the time but this recipe has you 'slice' the garlic as opposed to mincing.  Makes a big difference and can't wait to have it again!

Will definitely make again, as this got high ratings from the family.  We buy peeled garlic cloves from our local Asian supermarket, and I had a lot on hand, so I used way more than this called for.  It was great.

Fantastic!  Better than my grandmother used to make (sorry, Nana, may you RIP).  I used the proportions of the sauce/toppings, including the butter, on 1 and 1/2 lbs of pasta, so that there would be leftovers for the kids' lunches, and it was perfection.  I think we used more than 1 cup of cheese, though.  I also used the pasta water that someone said Chef John recommended in the video version of the recipe.  Truly delicious, simple, inexpensive, and pleased the whole family.  Thanks, Chef John!

Fabulous recipe and easy to make.  I tried a similar recipe via the Food Channel and did not get even close to what it should have tasted like Chef John.  Definitely watch his videos.  He did miss a key step in this recipe about pouring a 1/2 c of pasta water once the pan of oil and garlic are done cooking.

Other than using 8 oz of whole wheat spaghetti, made exactly according to directions.  Very good! This was the main dish for dinner for two and we ate it all!  As Chef John instructs, be sure to put the sauce and pasta in a bowl, BEFORE adding the parmesan.  If you add the parmesan to the sauce and spaghetti in a hot pan, the parmesan will stick to the pan!  I prefer the cheese on my spaghetti, not the pan.
Next time, I will use basil and add fresh, chopped tomatoes and grilled vegetables.  Also, I will add a little chicken base or vegetable base, to give it a little more flavor.  I think I will also reduce the amount of olive oil and increase the pasta water, to save on calories.

This recipe is to die for! I was skeptical because I am not a huge fan of olive oil but it was fantastic. My husband kept raving about it with every bite he took. A word of advice though, when you add the pasta water to the olive oil and garlic, add it slowly so as not to have an oil and water explosion. I served this with caprese salad and sauted shrimp I will definitely make it again.

I have made this several times after seeing the video a while ago. I did it exactly as the recipe and would not change anything to be honest, keep it simple is what I always try for.
