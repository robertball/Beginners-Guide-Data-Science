This was really good.  I do recommend actually chopping the tomatillos prior to putting them in the blender--it will work better that way!  I used chicken thighs instead of breasts because I didn't want the meat to be to dry.   It had great flavor but not too spicy.

This was SO good!  I have another Posole recipe that I have made many times but I like this one better.  I love that it has fresh salsa that goes in it.  I top mine with avocado, radishes, shredded cabbage and little cheese.  SO GOOD!!

Wow!  This was absolutely fantastic and I did not change a thing!  I had sliced radishes and avocado for toppings.  My peppers were hot and they added just the heat needed to make this so good!  Because I am only cooking for one person these days I did cut the recipe in half just so I wouldn't have to eat it for a week.  I love my Instant Pot and any time I find a recipe such as this I love it even more!

This was really good, but too much lime flavor, which is the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars. I will make it again with much less lime...Easy to add back in, but you can’t take it away.

This broth was unbelievably good!  I did not care for the hominy, so I might use rice next time.  This is definitely a keeper!

I just made this dish.  Was very good. Needs a little more heat so i will double the jalapeño peppers and needs salt. Otherwise absolutely yummy and so easy!!

Came out great! Forgot the radishes, but had the other garnish. May try it with shrimp or prawns.

Great recipe.  I like a lot of flavor so I seasoned my chicken with adobo seasoning and I added some salt and pepper to the broth.
