Yummy!  I took some suggestions from the previous reviewers: I added taco seasoning to the ground beef (using Taco Seasoning recipe from this site).  I spread the tortilla chips onto a cookie sheet, and baked for about 10 minutes at 350 to make them crispy. Then I just added the toppings onto that.  Popped the pan back into the oven until the cheese melted, and it was done.  I did not heat the refried beans first though, I wish I had, they were difficult to spread, so I just ended up plopping spoonfuls onto the chips.

Everyone enjoyed these at our Sunday night card party. I baked chips in oven for about 6-8 minutes, cooked meat with Taco seasoning as others did. I melted a 3 ounce brick of cream cheese with the beans for ease of spreading. Then topped everything with sour cream, guacamole, chopped Roma toms, minced green onions, and sliced black olives. Messy, but yummy! Thanks Charlie.

I heated my beans before putting the mixture on the chips. It helped to make it a little easier to spread. I also placed my chips in the oven before I added the ingredients to make them crispier. Once assembled I placed them back in the oven as opposed to the microwave. Great recipe!

These are pretty good for something quick, but I wouldn't call them "Over the Top". The ground beef really needed some seasoning, so I used "Taco Seasoning I" from this site. I also used a Mexican blend cheese. I didn't microwave this, instead I layered everything in a 9x13 foil pan and baked it in the oven. When everything was nice and melted I prettied it up a bit by adding some shredded lettuce, chopped tomatoes, black olives, chopped green onions, and a nice dollup of sour cream on top. Overall, not bad with a side of a couple sides of homemade salsa and guacamole - very filling.

Delicious. My boyfriend is a picky eater and loved these. The chips stay crispier if you bake them at 350 for 8 minutes. TRY THEM THEY ARE GREAT!

Restaurant quality nachos.  We added shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, guacomole, and sour cream.  It made a lot more than we anticipated, we ended up transfering it into a 9X13 pan so we could eat it more easily while watching Sunday football!  We already have plans to make it again this weekend!

Nachos are quite possibly the most fun food ever- so I can't see how anything would get a bad rating.  You can adjust everything according to taste because a recipe is more like a loose guideline than a strict set of rules.  At any rate- the taco seasoning on the meat was awesome- I also used pickled jalapenos, cheese, black olives and warm low fat refried beans.  I served with sour cream and salsa.  My husband deemed them the best nachos he's ever had!  Popping the chips into the oven for a couple of minutes before topping works wonders with soggy issues.

This dish was a huge hit at a friend's pot luck Mexican night.  I 've made it several times since, both for friends & family and it's always a winner.  My only change to the recipe is that I always add sliced black olives.

My kids loved these! I took other's advice and heated the re-fried beans before spreading. But looking at the chips nicely laid out on the cookie sheet, and seeing the consistency of the heated beans, I knew this could be ugly if I tried to spread it. I put the beans in a Ziploc bag, cut a hole in a corner, and, using oven mitts, as the beans were hot, I squeezed a dollop on each chip. No mess, and afterwards just threw the bag away. I will definitely make these again!

As written, this is ok -- a good basic recipe, but kind of bland, which is why I only gave it 3 stars. To perk it up a bit, I followed others' suggestions, by adding taco seasoning to the meat & baking the chips at 350 for about 8 minutes. I prepared 6 separate plates. On top of the chips, I thinly layered the beans (which were heated first) & meat. I topped that with nacho cheese salsa warmed in the microwave, then mild tomato salsa, chopped green onions, sliced black olives, some chopped tomato, shredded cheddar cheese and a dollop of sour cream. I served extras of the chips & toppings on the side, along with hot sauce and sliced jalapeno peppers for the more adventurous. There were no leftovers!  Next time, I will add shredded lettuce to the mix.

Pretty good. I used corn tostadas and spread the beans on top then layered the beef, cheese, and peppers. I used diced pickled jalapenos.  I only needed 1/4 lb of ground beef and used a couple of T of minced onion. It took about half the beans and cheese called for. These needed something though, maybe a sprinkle of garlic salt or chili powder? Not quite over the top but they were good. I baked mine in the oven on a foil lined cookie sheet until the cheese was melted.

Great idea (especially after taking others' suggestions)!  Adding taco seasoning to the beef just seems to make sense.  I added diced tomatoes and black olives.  I also baked the chips before topping them and heated up the refried beans so they spread easier.  Then, I just stuck the whole 9x13 pan of goodness back in the oven until the cheese was all gooey.  The whole family loved it!

I followed the advice of others and added taco seasoning to the meat and baked them as opposed to microwaving because I wanted crispy chips. After I browned and drained the meat I stirred in the beans because I thought it would be difficult to spread them directly on the chips. They are delicious and filling, thanks!

Delicious. Added a pack of taco seasoning. On subsequent occasions, I have taken the meat and placed on flour tortillas with shredded chedder cheese. Put under the broiler for five minutes and top with a jalapeno slice and sour cream. The kids love this.

This is basically what I make, so here are some suggestions: 1.) Season the meat with El Pato Sauce (spicy, so do to taste) and salt and pepper;  2.) I prefer green onion to regular onion; 3.) Add black olives; 4.) Place in a baking dish and heat in oven, I think I do 425 til cheese is melted, this keeps chips from getting soggy like they can in a microwave. I like to do 2 layers so the chips are evenly covered in yummy goodness!  Also, I actually prefer the pickled jalapenos from a jar/can, but definitely whatever floats your boat. Garnish with guacamole if you have available.

This went over great with nachos/tacos lovers.  I served it with and without taco seasoning mix.  Only one question - how to spread the refried beans?  I could only drop large spoonfuls in patches over the chips.  Plus it needed a lot more time in the microwave, but since I used a smaller platter and had to adjust the ingredients, perhaps it was just too thick to melt as I'd expected.  Thanks, Charlie!

I took the advice of taco seasoning and heating the refried beans for better spreadability. My younger sister wanted to try something different, so we used the scoops instead of the flat tortilla chips. While it was beastly to spread the beans on, it made this a mess-less finger food!

I used taco seasoning mix on the beef and followed the other suggestions of cooking the chips first at 350 for 10 minutes.  Then I just added the meat and toppings and put them back in the oven until the cheese had melted.  It was delicious.  We actually ate this as a dinner meal.

This is restaurant quality for sure!!! My family loved these nachos, but we did add a bit of a twist to it.  I sauted some pork in chili powder, cayenne pepper, and  a touch of salt, taco seasoning and shredded it to add on top (Note: I also made ground beef seasoned it the same way, so we had a couple of choices for meat - smile).  For the cheese I used both shredded cheese and a cheese sauce. For the sauce, I melted a 1/3 of a block of processed cheese (like Velveeta) with milk and a can of diced tomatoes with jalopeno peppers.  I followed the recipe to the T- otherwise. I browned the chips in the oven for a few minutes, then added the refried beans and cheese sauce and put back in the oven for abt 3 minutes, then added the meat and shredded cheese and let it all melt for about 3-5 more minutes. Then I added diced tomatoes, diced red onions, sour cream, and black olives on top. THis was awesome and filling!!!! No one could even think of leftovers - LOL.

I made these nachos for a "Girls' Night Out" a few months ago and it was a huge hit.  My girlfriends were eating them up before I could get them on the counter.

I missed the last outing but I think they missed the nachos more.  I was instructed not to show up next time without them.

It was quick and easy with a great flavor.  My key requirements.  Once again, great recipe!

Yummy. I added black olives and a big dollop of sour cream. I also added a generous amount of freshly chopped tomates. Thanks :)

I have been making these for years but with a lot more toppings that make them even yummier!  As some have already posted you definitely need the taco seasoning for the ground beef but also we add sour cream, guacamole, black olives, chopped tomatoes and top it all with hot sauce, then everyone tops them with what they like.  My family says they are better than the local taco place that is known for theirs!!

Good, versatile and easy. I like the taco seasoning in the meat for added flavor. I HATE soggy nachos so I LOVED Linda McClean's suggestion to put the chips in the oven first to crisp, really helps with the soggy problem. Thanks you!

Made this with turkey and it was kinda bland so we added 1/2 packet of taco seasoning mix to give it some zest and added the refried beans to the meat mixture for ease. My husband gave it a 5 though I think next time we'll just make it as a dip so the tortilla's dont get soggy. I served with guacamole from this site for a great superbowl snack.

When I made the ground beef, I sauteed some matchstick carrots, one red bell pepper and some garlic in with the onion. I also added a batch of the Taco Seasoning 1 to the meat mixture, along with some tomato sauce, lime juice and cornstarch. 

Filling and very tasty. My husband ate two helpings.

I made this sans the refried beans and added taco mix to the hamburger.  It was good, but what would be better is to add Jimmy Dean sausage to the cheese and rotel tomato's.

Like other reviewers, we thought these were dry.  I think this would be better without the ground beef (and we added a couple shakes of the ingredients from Taco Seasonings I to give the meat some ooomph too!).

Yum. I usually don't use the refried beans since my teens don't like them. Somehow we always end up using more cheese. I have salsa and sour cream on the side and when I can remember to buy them we love green onions also. I have to seed the jalapeno in order to eat, I'm a wimp!

When our family makes this, we use Taco seasoning as others have mentioned. Although we use a can of cheese sauce rather than shredded cheese. We also add sour cream, salsa, green onion and bacon bits (or cooked crumbled bacon). It's good for a weekend lunch or a quick and easy dinner. We don't like olives, but if you do, that might also be a good addition.

GREAT RECIPE!!!  Like others, I used a taco seasoning pack to season the ground beef.  I also used Kraft Mexican Cheese with jalepenos and placed in the oven instead of microwave.  My husband requests this meal once a week.  Next time I may try with chicken. YUMMY

Easy and very filling! I also added some taco seasoning to the meat, pre-crisped the chips in the oven and then baked in the toaster oven. Make sure you wear gloves if you are dicing up fresh jalapenos....my hands are tingling right now because I forgot!

This was really good.  I did use seasoned taco meat instead of plain ground beef. I also used a nacho cheese sauce instead of shredded cheese.  Then I also put it on a big cookie sheet, and just baked it in the oven for 5-6 minutes.  I was a hit,  the whole family loved it.

Like other reviewers, I used taco seasoning.  I used chipotle taco seasoning, added canned, sliced jalapenos and baked it for about 10 min in a 400 degree oven.  It was great.

These were great!  I had some leftover taco meat to use up so I made a scaled version of  this.  I didn’t want to open a whole can of refried beans, since I was making such a small amount, so I skipped the beans.  I topped my tortilla chips with the taco meat and cheddar cheese, popped them under the broiler until heated and melty.  When I served them I garnished them with chopped green onions and chopped tomatoes and served with salsa and sour cream on the side.  My result was definitely 5 stars, and I’ll make these again!  Thanks!

Delicious! I did take the advise of the other reviewers and added taco seasoning to the meat and also baked the chips at 350 for about 8 minutes, added cheese and put back in the oven to melt before adding other toppings. So good!

Of course...this is a basic 'nacho' recipe and my rating is based on the homemade nachos I always make which are similar...however- I MUST add taco seasoning to the hamburger as well as topping items such as diced tomatoes, sliced olives, green onions etc! :-)  I usually make a big ol' nacho for Saturday lunch, for the whole family a day or two after taco night.  All the ingredients are sure to be on hand.

definately a 5 star recipe with just a few minor changes. I took other reviewers advise and Baked the tortilla chips at 350 degrees at least 10 minutes. I baked them in a roasting pan since looking at my cookie sheets i didn't think they would fit. I warmed up the beans while cooking the meat, and added a taco seasoning pack. Took the chips out sprinkled the meat, then dolloped the beans over the chips and spread them slightly then covered in cheese popped it back in the over till melted and  garnished with shredded lettuce, tomatoes and a few fresh jalapeno.  But all in all It was great the kids loved it too. I just wish we had salsa lol

great recipe, the only change i made was to use a can of campbells cheddar cheese in a can(they also have nacho cheese) because it stays melted and creamy and i cooked my beans in bacon fat for extra flavor.

I am vegetarian.  We make this recipe but use Boca crumbles instead of beef.  We add chili powder, cumin and garlic powder to the meat and onions as we cook it.  I love this recipe :)

The things that I adjusted that became an instant hit was the heating of the refried beans, I used the hot ortego taco seasoning in the meat as it cooked, and used the scoops chips instead of ordinary nachos, but made sure they were all facing cup side up so they were more like mini taco bowls after all the toppings were on.

I have been making this for years, it is sooo good.  I season the meat with taco seasoning and leave the onions raw to sprinkle over top.  I use processed cheese or Tostito's cheese dip and hat it on the stove along with the refried beans.  This makes the beans and cheese easier to evenly distribute over the chips.  I bake it, then I top with what I have on hand- lettuce, tomatoes, onions, sour cream guacamole, etc.  Great to make and eat in front of the TV with a movie or the game. Yum!

I gave this *** because I think the meat desperately needs to be seasoned more.  I used shredded sirloin, added fajita seasoning, and green chili peppers.  We like them better baked.

Yummy dinner! I did swap the jalapeño for green onions, knowing DS would not eat the peppers. Could not resist adding corn to the ground beef mix, topped the whole wad with chopped lettuce, tomatoes and avocado. And lots of cilantro :) Next time, more cheese!

I wouldn't have cared for this recipe had I not put Taco Seasoning in the meat. That addition did put them over the top, but without it, these are pretty bland. ***UPDATE 4/12/14 I followed this recipe exactly except I subbed Johnsonville Italian Hot Sausage for the ground beef (no salt or pepper was needed). I like the sausage much better than the beef. Spicier and more flavor. The sausage definitely takes these nachos "over the top" to 5 stars or higher! I like to serve these with plain yogurt and diced tomatoes.

These were good to make, I made them for lunch today but they could do with more seasoning, like chili or taco seasoning and I used a Mexican blend cheese on these.

As is, I wouldn't call them "over the top".  But it is a good, basic recipe to get the creative juices flowing.  Add all your other favorite toppings.  I, at the suggestion of other reviews, put these on a large baking sheet and baked them in the oven until the cheese was melted.  The whole family enjoyed these and I will make them again.

WOW.. these were great.. once you doctor them up a bit. LOL I added taco seasoning to the meat and made the nacho cheese sauce from this site to put on them. I baked the chips also. I mixed the meat and beans together to make it easier to put on the chips. Then I poured the cheese sauce over the meat and added some shredded cheese on top of that (we like cheese) My kids LOVED them. I put everything in a 9x13 baking dish and baked in the oven until the cheese melted. We actually had these for a "fun" dinner. There was ALOT of nachos. Will definitely be making this again!! :)

As others suggested, add taco seasoning to the beef.  Spread chips on ovenproof dish and cook for 10 minutes before adding toppings - don't forget sour cream!  Next time, we'll cut the toppings in half (our pan wasn't large enough to hold more chips).

I did change these up a little based on what I had on hand. I used green chiles in a can instead of the jalapeno. And, I only had ground turkey meat, so that is what I tried it with. And, I served with homemade guacamole on top with chopped tomatoes. All the ingredients seemed kind of separate, and it didn't really come together as anything different than what the ingredients were. But everyone seemed to like it.

I added taco seasoning to the beef.  I mixed the refried beans with salsa and that helped with spreading.  The nachos were tasty, but I did not bake the meat because the chips manage to get soggy. I baked the chips for about 10 min on 350 degrees. before I added the toppings and placed them in the microwave

Excellent recipe for Nachos. Quick, easy and oh so tasty. I made the taco seasoning from this site, and also included on the nachos, tomatillos, avocados, a green sauce(tomatillo) and green onions. The best nachos ever. Thanks Charlie.

The refried bean are always a great part of nachos and i wouldn't change that.  But the rest of the nachos were bland.  I think if you add taco seasonig to he ground beef and cayanne and curry powder.  Plus jarred Jalapenos, ot fresh

I had some meat mixture leftover from sloppy joes, so I decided to use that for the nachos. It was really good! I layered tortilla chips on a pizza pan with the heated meat mixture, cheddar cheese, chopped green onions, chopped plum tomatoes and salsa. I baked in a 350 F oven for 5-7 minutes. I served it with sour cream. So yummy!

Needed a quick fix to bring to a party, turned out awesome. Opted out of the ground beef and used chorizo from a previous hunting trip, added diced tomatoes and habenros as well as the jalepanos. Baked in the over at 350 as suggested. Serve with Corona and lime and you've got a good, lazy meal.

This was a good recipe.  I liked it.  I don't think that I will be making these again because I like taco bells nachos and I don't have any dishes to clean if I eat there!  But this is a good recipe, now don't get me wrong:)  Thanks for sharing:)

These were excellent.  I skipped the Jalapeno peppers though, and tossed a little salsa on top.  YUMMY!!!!  My hubby hates refried beans, so I didn't tell him they were on there, and left a few plain just in case he hated it.  Well, he didn't complain at all, and even after telling him about it, he liked it better than the plain chips.

I make my Nachos with 1 Lb ground beef, browned and drained/rinsed (removes more fat) and then simmered in 1/2 pack of nacho mix, re-fried beans softened with water to a medium paste and warmed in the microwave, nacho cheese sauce (Tostito's), green olives, black olives, jalapeno slices, Mexican blend shredded cheese or shredded cheddar and what ever else strikes my fancy.
Layer chips on cookie sheet lined with foil, spoon on re-fried beans, nacho cheese sauce, ground beef bit of shredded cheese, olives, then a bit more of the ground beef mix, nacho sauce and a good helping of shredded cheese and finally a handful of the jalapeno's. Pop this under the broiler for a few minutes to warm and melt the cheese. Once it comes out I sometimes add salsa and sour cream on the side. Absolutely crazy how fast every one shows up knowing the nacho's are gettign made that day!

I've never tried these with beans along with the meat. They are absolutely scruptious with olives though!!

We are huge fan of the individual nachos served in a couple of restaurants in the Dallas area so we decided to try this recipe.  It is great but we tweaked it, of course.  As we use the following mixture in a few dishes, I decided to use it here.  I make my own pinto beans cooked for a day and a half, with whatever flavorings you enjoy adding.  Besides a meat (whatever leftover I have stashed in the freezer), I add chili powder, jalapenos and paprika for a little kick.  Then place in a blender and blend a couple of containers, add those to the meat mix after it is ready.  Allow it to cook down to desired consistency.  I always make a large amount of this mixture as we use it on tostatos also.  Other than that, I follow the recipe as written and we enjoyed a 5-star winning recipe.  Thanks!!!

I took the advise from some of the reviewers:  Put chips in the oven to make them crispier,  added taco seasoning and diced onion to the beef.  After draining the beef, added the beans to heat them.  Topped the chips with the mixture and heated in oven to melt the cheese.  Very tasty.  Thanks for sharing a simple lunch idea.

Great, simple and very easy recipe.  I used my own leftover shredded beef and omitted the beans as my family simply don't like them.  Added chopped tomatoes and a mixture of cheddar and pepper jack cheese.  These were so good, next time I think I will add shredded lettuce and some salsa.  Certainly be making these again.

Made it in a deep lasagna pan and it turned out delicious. I added home made taco seasoning to the hamburger for flavour. Was like a big nachos lasagna!

So far this is our best attempt at making nachos like in the restaurant. The shredded chicken was delicious. We just added extra jalapenos and served w/ more salsa and cream fraiche.

This made great nachos.......... I used the recipe for slims bad attitude nacho sauce in place of the ground beef this recipe calls for, but I kept the rest of the recipe as stated. Topped with shredded lettuce, diced tomato and diced green and red onions, also salsa and sour cream. So very good!!
**** EDIT **** I made as recipe states and thought this was so good and simple!!! I think next time I will add the refried beans to the browned meat so it will "spread" better on the chips. I ended up spreading a spoonful of refried beans on each tortilla chip which can get time consuming!!!

My husband is a big nacho fan and he liked these a lot.  I didn't care for them, but I am not a big fan of nachos in general.  Our 2- and 4- yr olds did not care for them either.  I took other reviewers suggestions and added taco seasoning to the meat, heated the beans in advance (they still did not spread well) and then heated the chips in the oven for a few minutes first, but they still got soggy.  4 stars since my nacho fan husband liked them, but even he didn't think they were the best nachos ever.

This was darn good - my boyfriend agreed by eating way more than a serving or two.  Changes:  I used ground chicken instead of beef for a lower cal, lower fat option.  Also, used a taco seasoning but think I will only use 2/3 of the pack next time as it was a bit too salty.  I'm still a little uneasy abt using tomatoes so we opted for a chunky salsa instead.  Tasty!

We make super nachos regularly.  I found this recipe and thought I would try something differnet.  As I was preparing it I wasn't sure I would like it.  I added a few of my own twists based on my familys tastes and we loved it.  Super Nachos will never be the same.  Thanks

My family liked this.  I added taco seasoning after reading the previous reviews.  I also used kidney beans instead of refried because that's all I had in the pantry and left out the jalepeno.  Diced up a couple of tomatoes from my garden and added taco sauce on top and it turned out great!

We make these nachos for a fast dinner at least every other week.  I agree with other reviewers about adding the taco seasoning to the hamburger.  We sometimes use leftover chili instead of the beans and beef.  You can add or take away toppings to make them to your taste.  YUM!

Can't go wrong with nachos. Fix them how you like with toppings of your choice. I sauteed onions with ground beef and taco seasoning. I topped the chips with salsa con queso, ground beef mix, salsa and sour cream. Naughty but good.

I followed the other suggestions of pre-heating the chips and beans. I also added a can of seasoned diced tomatoes and sliced olives to the meat and taco seasoning. Top it with sour cream and sliced avocado and this was a delicious recipe!!

These were allright. My hubs and I agree that although decent (what nachos AREN'T good???), these were not the best nachos we've ever had. I think these would be MUCH better if covered with a prepared or homemade cheese sauce rather than melted (shredded) cheese. As is, these would have been too bland for our liking (I made several modifications to this recipe) and were WAY too dry. As many others have done, I too added a packet of (reduced-sodium) taco seasoning to my beef. I just followed the instructions printed on the back of my seasoning packet and then proceeded as directed. I also baked my nachos for 15 minutes at 350 degrees rather than broiling them (5 minutes to warm / "crisp" my chips and 10 minutes to bake). NOTE: It is NOT necessary to pre-heat your beans, especially if you use the reduced-fat variety (these seem to be less firm to begin with, IMHO). Regardless of what variety you use, the beans will melt in the oven! Tomato, green onion, cilantro, shredded lettuce, guacamole and sour cream were nice "toppers." I'll DEFINITELY make these again, but will layer with cheese sauce instead and save the shredded cheese to use as garnish. Thanks for sharing, Charlie! :-)

Great recipe! The next time I'll cut it in half; it's just my husband and I and I wasted a lot. :( I too put my chips in the oven for about 8 minutes and I melted my cream cheese and refried beans together; that being said, I still put them down in plops as it didn't want to spread very easily.
Thanks for the recipe and thanks to everyone for the extra tips!

I haven't made this, but I'm thinking the 'Tip' about using aluminum foil making clean-up easier is not a good idea for a microwave dish.  Just saying...   And yes, I would add taco seasonings and several other items and put under the broiler instead of the microwave.  Thank you!  Happy Cinco de Mayo everyone!

We liked this a lot! I also added taco seasoning to the meat and used pickled jalapeno peppers instead of fresh b/c that's what I had on hand. Topped with some green onions, black olives, sour cream and taco sauce and we were all happy! This is a basic recipe, more of an idea. Just add whatever you like. :)

I used garlic salt and ground cumin to the meat, just because I love the flavor.  And, yes, I added chopped tomatoes per the picture after microwaving the nachos.  Really good and will make this dish again.

Great Nacho recipe.  I did spread the tortilla chops on a baking sheet and baked the Nachos in the oven for 8 minutes at 400 degrees.

I made these for Super Bowl Sunday and my family loved them. I twereed them a bit. I used ground turkey and I made my own pico de gallo.  So, instead of refried beans I put a little of the pico de gallo and store bought salsa on the meat and cheese before putting in the oven. WINNER!!! Like a tray of mini tacos.

These were pretty good.  I took the advise of other reviewers and baked the nacho chips for about 8 min to make them crunchier.  I also added taco seasoning to the meat for some flavor and mixed some cream cheese with the beans to make them creamier and easier to spread.  My 7 year old is a pretty harsh critic and picky eater and she enjoyed an extra large portion of these(minus the jalapenos of course).  Will make again.

I added taco seasoning, Rotel tomatoes & jalepenos.  I also baked the chips for 6 mins @ 350 before adding the rest of the stuff and putting back in the oven like others suggested.  Family said they taste something you'd get in a restaurant which is what I was hoping for.

I add a little milk to the beans to make the easily spreadable, and added a Taco Bell clone recipe from food.com to the meat, also I bake so the cheese melts instead of microwave, made this recipe a good amount of times and everyone loves it

This is a wonderful recipe.  After reading the previous reviews, here are the changes I made; for health reasons, replaced the ground beef with ground turkey, mixed 1 pkg. of less sodium taco seasoning with browned turkey, added 1/4 cup water, 1/4 cup salsa & mixed the refried beans with the meat mixture & heat for 5 min. & spread it over warmed tortilla chips.  Once baked, decorated with fresh chopped tomatoes, green onions, diced red pepper & shredded lettuce.  As one reviewer suggested I used a disposable oven pan, since making it in the oven for easier clean up!

Charlie, thank you so much for sharing your recipe with us all! This one is a keeper in my recipe box!

I tried this recipe and had to use some previously cooked ground pork sausage because I didn't feel like going to the store. I think the added flavor in the pork added enough seasoning that I didn't need to add the taco seasoning mentioned by other reviewers. I also mashed the beans after heating them in a pan. I grew up with Mom making them that way and I just like the texture better. This was easy and great tasting. You could also use chorizo cooked just like the ground beef. For those who like a little less seasoning then chicken could also be a substitute. Like I said it was great tasting, easy to make, and lent itself to many personal touches.

I followed the recipe for these nachos and they were good and very easy, but next time I will season the ground beef and warm the beans first.
