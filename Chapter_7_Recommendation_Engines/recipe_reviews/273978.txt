This was excellent. I did change the blue cheese to mozzarella because my husband is picky. I can only imagine how good it would be with blue cheese. I did put it back in the oven with it off after cooking for another 1/2 hour to cook the potatoes even more. Next time Iâ€™m going to try adding a different meat to make it more of an entree. This is a very versatile recipe.
