So easy, So good, So fast! Made this when I had a group of folks at my house for a Pot Luck Forth...  Everyone loved it and I passed the recipe on to my daughter with a brand new 6 week old baby... She proclaimed,  "Dinner solved for one night this week!"

The spice and flavor of the taco seasoning was really yummy. Will definitely make again and on a regular basis.

I liked it and may make it again. I did have to modify it because I did not have the rice, that it called for. I made rice with homemade chicken stock. I also did not have the veggies that it called for but I figured any mixed veggies would work. It was a bit spicy for me but I am not big fan spicy foods. My hubby loved it. It was a great way to use up ingredients in my fridge and not go to the store. I say give it a try if you like spicy foods, it may not be overly spicy for you.

This recipe is perfect as written.    The first time I made it I had no chorizo. So I substituted Hungarian sausage.   It was good but the chorizo makes this dish.   Donâ€™t substitute that.

Amazing! I didn't add the chorizo, and just added 2 lbs of chicken, plus threw in some more taco seasoning for some extra spice! It was super delicious and I will definitely be making it again!

We loved this! I added shrimp. I also used cauliflower rice instead of the white rice. Soo good!

I didn't have chorizo so I subsituted a couple of brats that I needed to use up. Also used Mexican rice mix because I didn't have white rice on hand. I only used 1/2 pack of taco mix because the rice was already seasoned. It went over well with my family and we would cook it again. Fast and easy to fix and would even work as a camping recipe.
