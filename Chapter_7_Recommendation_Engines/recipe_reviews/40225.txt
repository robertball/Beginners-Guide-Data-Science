This recipe is delicious...a wonderful and surprising play of sweet and savory. If you love Indian food you'll love this dish, but it is not at all spicy. To save time you could serve the lamb over regular rice. I made the jeweled rice, though, and it is superb. My only complaint is that the recipe calls for lamb stew meat. I followed this recommendation and very much regret it. The meat is gristly and tough and detracted from the enjoyment of the meal. Splurge and get a nice tender cut, it will make a big difference.

WOW this was awesome! So gourmet, and it made a beautiful presentation on the plates (with a sprig of cilantro for garnish). I agree with the other reviewers...DO NOT use stew meat.  I used boneless butterflied leg of lamb that I cubed myself.  So tender, and it cooked up perfectly!  I can't wait to make it again.  I may try adding a little garlic and ginger next time.  It would also be good with toasted slivered almonds (just because I like to experiment)...but it really is perfect the way it is!

This was my first Allrecipes.com attempt. I first made it when I was 17 or 18... so it's been 4 or 5 years now. This is still my favorite "impress dinner guests" dish! I've made it with lamb, and with chicken and both ways are great. I haven't made the jeweled rice though, because I prefer to use the recipe for Coconut Rice submitted by Sara K. The coconut rice uses curry, coconut milk, and ginger and complements the masala very well. This recipe takes a little time, but it's very delicious and worth the effort!

Amazing!  This recipe was delicious -- i took people's suggestions and used quality lamb.  Chicken would probably be great too.  one change:  1 cup of rice isn't quite enough for the amount of sauce (maybe 1.5 cups would be more fitting).

We love this recipe!  I've made it twice with chicken, and the only change I made is to omit the salt.  The Garam Masala I bought has salt as the first ingredient(!) and it was too salty with the added tsp.

If you do not like curry dishes DO NOT eat this dish. I through the whole thing away. Just not my taste.

This recipe is great. Its really easy and the apples compliment the flavor. I like to add a bit more masala seasoning to it.

A pretty good dish. I've definitely made better indian dishes from this site. I think I would drain the tomatoes next time as the tomato liquid doesn't mesh as well with the coconut milk. Altogether, it's a pretty easy recipe and it has a colorful look and a unique flavor.

This meal is off the chart.  It is easy, but a bit timely to make.  I used Chicken instead. The chicken was very tender after cooking it according to the instructions listed in the recipe.

I discovered a phenomenal indian restaurant when I was a senior out at school.  I've been dying to have their Lamb Masala ever since I graduated and moved home.  Though not exactly the same, this recipe was amazing!  The Jeweled rice really set off the dish. (I added a little extra regular coconut milk).  My greatest dinner accomplishment ever!

I found this recipe bland and pepped it up with twice the amount of massala and some yellow curry sauce. I also made it the night before in an electric frying pan and kept it overnight and reheated it in the oven in a casserol. Got lots of compliments - was a dinner party. little bland.

This was my first experience cooking lamb.  I took the advice of others and used a quality cut and cubed it myself.  Love it, love it, love it.  I halved the recipe...wish I had doubled it!!
