This is the classic recipe that I have always used (but with much more salad dressing) and I'm asked to bring them to every family gathering. I do variations some times such as adding crumbled bacon. Here's a tip for making things much quicker, less messy and a little fancier:
Mix until creamy. Put it all into a plastic (zip-lock type) storage bag. Seal the top, clip a lower corner to make a hole and squeeze the filling into the egg halves.

"salad dressing" usually refers to Miracle Whip, not just any random dressing.

I was bored today so I made 4 different recipes for deviled eggs at the same time and had neighbors & friends do a taste test. This one came in 3rd. It was okay, but where it says "salad dressing," that is really open to interpretation. I used lighthouse ranch, and it overpowered the egg. The other recipes in my taste test were "Cajun Deviled Eggs" by Denyse, "Deviled Eggs II" by Mary Brotherton, and "Deviled Eggs" by Margaret Sanders. Margaret's were the unanimous winner.

Hooray! Nothing fancy,,,This is the classic recipe that my mom and grandma used. You can always add more mustard or dressing to make it the right consistancy. I like to add a small amount of sweet pickle relish to the mixture though...as odd as it sounds, it gives it a little bit of zip. Great recipe!

So easy and yet so good. Classic picnic food that goes fast.  I used dijon mustard and added a little garlic powder.  This one's a definite keeper.

This is a good, basic devilled egg recipe. As others have said, though, it needs added dressing (Miracle Whip) to not be too dry. I made this with 10 eggs, so 10 egg yolks, and I used 2 t. mustard and probably 1/2 cup Miracle Whip. I also added about 2 T. of drained relish for some extra flavor, as that's how I'm used to my mom making them. They turned out really good!

Made this recipe exactly as written but found the filling to be really dry and a tad bland. So, I doubled the miracle whip and mustard and tried it that way. I would give this recipe as written 2 stars but when doctored up, it rates 4-5. That's the nice thing about deviled eggs, you can keep tasting until you like it then stuff the white.

These needed lots more salad dressing and mustard. I also added about 1/2 tsp. of cider vinegar and some horseradish. Crumbled bacon is also good in them.

A good basic recipe but it needs a little tweaking. I too, found that it was much too dry and needed at least twice as much salad dressing to get a creamy texture. I also added more paprika and mustard as I felt it was a little bland. Otherwise, a keeper.

Simple recipe for deviled eggs. To make the colors for red, white & blue, I used 1/2 cup of boiling water, 1 teaspoon of white vinegar and Wilton food color in separate bowls and dipped the eggs. Made these for early 4th of July BBQ!

A little dry and I had to add more ingredients, but I loved the outcome!  My trick for the eggs is to set the timer for 12 minutes as soon as the water starts to boil.  Then immediately after drain the hot water and fill pan with ice and water--lots of ice.  As soon as the eggs are cool (5-10 min) peel and the shell will come off easily.  It has always been a no fail way for me!

I would add some Mayo, or Miricle Whip, to the mixture. It will taste sooooo much better that way. And if you like salty food, seasoned salt tastes great with deviled eggs, Lawry's Season Salt is my personal favorite brand.

It tastes like your average deviled eggs, but it was very dry and I had to keep adding mayo until it was the normal consistancy.

This is a very classic recipe.  Like most reviews, I think it needs a tad more mayo.  I've tried a twist with using miracle whip one time, and people preferred mayo instead.  I now add in regular mustard, spicy brown mustard, slat and pepper and a pinch of garlic powder.  I get mad raves about my eggs :)

I recommend adding a pinch of sugar!  And if you have left overs, which is almost never, you can mix them together and make egg salad sandwiches.

This is an easy, fast, yet delicious way to make deviled eggs.  I have found that it is easier to please a larger group of people by keeping the eggs simple.  The only thing that I added was about 1/2 tsp of garlic salt and 1 TBsp sweet relish.  But it is good if you add or leave out these ingredients.  Great recipe!

All the right ingredients but just not the right amounts. With this recipe you'll have to add more mayo and mustard or you'll have some really dry deviled eggs.

Very good eggs! The kids devoured them! I usually make deviled eggs by mixing the yolkes with deviled ham and mayonaise, then sprinkling the tops with paprika, but I didn't have any deviled ham and had more eggs in the refrigerator than I knew what to do with. This gave me a way to use alot of them up before they had a chance to spoil, with ingredients I already had. Thanks Barbara!

I thought this was a good basic recipe.  I always add A grated spear of a kosher Dill pickle & a few shakes of garlic powder as well as onion powder.  If using fresh grated onion - use less salad dressing or mayonaise.  I also grate up a 6-8 medium black olives if I have them on hand.

My family loves deviled eggs prepared just this way. Nothing fancy or extra- they don't want their deviled eggs messed with! Super yummy and easy! We put all the yolk mixture into a plastic baggie and snip off the tip for easy filling of the eggs.

It's a good basic recipe but I always do a 1/2 mayo 1/2 miracle whip mix, a touch of yellow mustard and a nice helping of sweet relish.  if you dont like that much sweet use dill relish, it's a nice little crunch. I make them for work all the time and people will follow me around taking them from the tray before I get them to the table!!

To us southerners, the "creamy salad dressing" is Dukes Mayo. To this add some dill pickle relish and perhaps a touch of garlic if you like and they are quite tasty.

I love how easy to prepare these are!  In addition to the mustard and a little extra mayo, I also added some chili powder and worchestire sauce for some extra flavor.  I like my filling light, fluffy and yummy - thanks for the recipe!

This is a very easy recipe to make.  I did however, add more salad dressing (to taste) and then filled the eggs with a pastry tube.  Very tasty!

Have made these before but made them last night and they turned out great.  They did need a little more miracle whip but I added to taste. These aren't a thanksgiving traditional side dish for us but they are tasty.  Eating them reminded me of summer weather and picnics...a warm thought for these chilly days. Thanks Barbara!

This recipe is far too dry, so you need to add lots of additional dressing to the yolks.  It does make a really good egg salad from the leftovers, though!

I was disappointed that 1/2 teaspoon of prepared mustard, 1 tablespoon of salad dressing was just not enough. If you used that, it would be very pasty and mushy! Like everyone else, I had to keep adding mustard and salad dressing until it was just right. I wouldn't make this again and only cause it's not properly measured correctly.

The reviews helped me out, yes it was a bit dry but I added more mayonnaise and mustard to taste and for an added variation, I sprinkled bacon bits in the mixture along with seasoning salt. Bacon bits were then sprinkled on top for a nice presentation...everyone loved them!!

I'm something of a beginning cook, and this was my first attempt at deviled eggs. They turned out great, but instead of salad dressing I used garlic-flavored mayonnaise, and honey mustard instead of plain. That gives them a little more spice, and combined with the paprika, is just perfect!

This is the perfect deviled eggs recipe.  It's so easy that anyone can make it with ease.  And they taste great enough to be the main dish or a party compliment, and it's a taste everyone can enjoy.

I was looking for a deviled egg recipe that would help me make them like Grandma does and this is it.  I actually added more Miracle Whip than recommended (I just kept adding until it was wet enough for me) and turned this into a quick egg salad even (cut up the egg whites and added them to the mix and spread it on bread).  Really good.

These were good; however, I've tasted better. My first time to make deviled eggs, but based on previous tastes, I feel like it needed something else. Just not certain what. But still good!

Of course I adjusted the recipe like everyone else did!  Here's what I did and every single egg was gone in minutes!!!!  I've always had issues over or under cooking my eggs and when I peeled them chunks of the white would come off too..... Here is the best way to boil them:    Cover eggs with COLD water plus an extra inch, add 1 tsp salt to the water.  Bring to a rolling boil.  Boil eggs for only 2 minutes, then cover the pan with a lid and remove the pot from heat and let it sit covered for 15 minutes.  Drain eggs and run cold water over eggs till cool enough to peel, or refrigerate to peel later.  Eggs peel best under running cool water.  They cooked and peeled perfectly when I did it this way.  I boiled 15 eggs and added 1 teaspoon of prepared mustard and about 1/4 cup of MIRACLE WHIP, maybe even a little more to make it creamier! That makes all the difference in the taste, do not use mayo!!  I tried the baggie method but when I squirted it out, well, let's just say it looked like yelow logs!  So I used my piping bag, as others suggested and they looked beautiful!  Be sure to sprinkle with paprika (I did not add to the mix)!  DELISH!!!!!!!

These are easy, economical and everyone loves them-nice appetizers.  I use a little less yellow mustard and Miracle Whip - and if you don't have paprika you don't need it it just adds a little color- I often just sprinkle a little more black pepper over the top.

I make this recipe back before I havent seen this online. I make my own mixture. I only use mayonnaise, cheddar cheese, a little bit ham or prosciutto, a little bit butter and the egg yolk, I put it all together and pan fry it again. put it in a piping bag, cut the edge and fill it in back. nyummy**

This is an awesome deviled egg recipe. I added some sweet pickle relish and topped with sliced pimento stuffed green olives before sprinkling with paprika.

We added much more mustard and salad dressing. Then we tossed in some sweet pickle relish. Tasty. 

We put it in a zip lock bag and piped it on as mentioned previously. Super easy! Thanks

It's good, after you improvise. I added alot more dressing because the recipe didn't call for enough. It was too lumpy and dry, until I added more. It made it more creamy.

I found the filling to be dry, and should have read the reviews before making these deviled eggs. I also had to double the dressing and mustard to make them creamy enough. I used celery salt and onion powder to doctor up the taste also.

For a fun twist on these, after you peel the eggs, dip them in easter egg coloring.  The outside will be whichever color you choose and once you cut them apart there will be a white inside and the yellow yolk center.  I did this last year for easter and everyone loved them!

This is the basic deviled egg recipe my mom used, therefore, I use it.  But, with one major change.  Here in the South (SC) we have the best mayo ever made....Duke's Mayonnaise.  It is just fanastic!!!  Makes anything better when you need a mayo and you use Duke's made by C.F.Saucer Co.  I also like to enclude some bacon bits in the yolk mixture and to use a garnish such as olives or parsley or whatever you desire.

I use this same exact recipe and it is quick, simple and easy enough for your kids to do too!  Just make sure you don't leave your kids unattended, burns can be quite painful.

Good basic Deviled Egg recipe.  Like other reviewers, I found them to need a bit more moisture added - but better to add more than to have sloppy yolks, right?  Nice consistency achieved.  Add your favorite spices for your own special take on it.

Salad dressing does need to be corrected and say mayo or miracle whip. I have always made mine this way as did my mother. One thing we add is sweet relish!

I've been using these ingredients for years in my deviled eggs. I usually never measure my salad dressing but use just enough to make them creamy but not too much that the yolk mixture is too soft. I think I added a little more than one tablespoon. Using a hand blender helps to make the filling nice and smooth. To make filling the eggs easy put the filling into a plastic zip-lock sandwich or quart bag, zip shut and clip a lower corner. Squeeze and swirl filling into the egg halves. My go-to recipe. Yum!

Simple, quick, and always delicious. I've made these numerous times and have always gotten excellent reviews. I recently made them for a Halloween party and dyed the eggs orange and white using the "dinosaur egg" method. For the life of me I couldn't find my paprika in the cupboard, so I used a cajun seasoning powder. Still turned out amazing! Thanks for the go-to recipe!

When I make these deviled eggs the plate is always wiped clean.  I use real mustard not the dry.  I also increase all the ingredients except the egg.  I like to have extra sauce to pile the eggs high!  Very good recipe.

I loved these! I made these deviled eggs as a taste tester and got great reviews form my family. When the recipe says "salad dressing" you should actually use mayo. ( not miracle whip) : ) and you do not need to use prepared mustard, any mustard works. Tip, put the ingredients in a small bowl and then mix until creamy. Then, put it in a plastic bag, cut the tip off and squeeze the mixture into the egg!

This is almost identical to a recipe that my mom had made for us all of our lives and now I continue the tradition and make for my family. The only addition is that I add sweet pickle relish and mayo instead of Miracle whip so it is not doubly sweet although I choose Miracle whip over mayo nine times out of ten.

this is a good starter recipe.    you definitely need to add more mayo or mustard as the mixture would be dry, other than that the recipe is great!

These turned out ok- dry and bland before tweaking the mustard and dressing amounts, and adding some garlic powder per another reviewer's suggestion. I still feel like they were missing something, though.

Very good basic recipe that gives room for additions. I agree with the other reviewer that creamy salad dressing is usually miracle whip. I also added a splash of pickle juice straight from the jar.

Being single, I had to adjust the measurements, aside from that-I followed directions (who doesn't love deviled eggs?)and made my very first batch, with a touch of lemon juice, just enough for flavor, and voila-rousing success.

Simple and great.  Mrs. C is right: :"salad dressing" really means Miracle Whip.  Nothing else will do. In fact, the person that used creamy ranch ruined her eggs.  No surprise there.

I just finished making this dish and  was pleased with the way that it turned out.  I used Miracle Whip, a little mustard, then added relish, sugar, salt & pepper to taste.  I then finished it off with a light dusting of paprika from about 6 inches above the plate.

I made a dozen if these. I added a lot more dressing to make it more creamy than chunky.  Maybe as much as 1/4 cup, but seeing as I was eyeing the texture as I added, I'm not exactly sure.  With the mustard, I added about teaspoon or even 1/2 tablespoon, at least. Again, went by colour and feel. I didn't measure out the paprika, rather sprinkled it creatively on top.

Instead of spooning the mixture, I threw the mix into a Wilton pastry plastic bag and used  Wilton open star tip #32 to pipe in the mixture onto the egg.  Presentation factor goes up a few notches!

Thanks for the instructions on how to boil eggs properly! I put about 1 tablespoon of vinegar into the water so that the eggs would not crack and the whites spill out. For extra measure, I also added some extra salt into the water, in case that helped in peeling them (can't say it did though!)

The recipe is classic. Super easy, tasty deviled eggs. I did need to add much more mayo and mustard than the recipe calls for to have a creamy filling instead of dry. But it is an easy adjustment that you can make on taste. I will definitely be making more of these!

After initially using the suggested salad dressing, I found that it needed about 1.5 the amount. This was my first attempt at making deviled eggs. They turned out very tasty!

I like this recipe...however, I too add just a bit of good quality sweet relish.  It gives it that added zing!  I am not a big fan of ANY deviled eggs but will make them for my niece occasionally. Then, maybe eat 1 or 2.  Adding a sprinkle paparika on top.

an alteration for simple deviled eggs is to mash yolks with cream of tartar and finely chopped sweet red peppers. I have been asked for this version so much I thought i'd share!

used "mayo" for the salad dressing, and dijon mustard. Also added a little garlic powder, green relish, and a little of the McLarents Imperial aged cheddar. Yum! :)

Added more miracle whip, salt, pepper, and a little bit of relish. Really tangy, and perfect texture.

Just want to reiterate for anyone out there that didn't watch I Love Lucy. "Salad dressing" = mayonnaise, not ranch. I also added some pickle relish. Delicious!

Great recipe but I did tweak it and used about 1/2 cup of Mayo, 2 teaspoons of mustard and a bit of pepper to add more flavoring and to get a creamier texture. I used a dozen eggs for this recipe.

We like ours very creamy so we used 4 tblsp of miracle whip , 1tsp of mustard, and a  1/.2 tsp 50/50 salt pepper mix I use for BBQ.  I also like paprika.  There very yummy.  Tip for boiling eggs do your self a favor and get an instapot we used 5-5-5 and the shells practically fall off the egg with no scaring of the egg and the yokes are creamy but cooked.

If I had miracle whip I would make it just like this (but with more miracle whip.)  We usually use mayo with a cash of pickle juice!

I used regular mayo and put a dollop of old style mustard on the top instead of mixing it in - garnished with scallion sticks. Pretty and yummy!

I would recommend using real mayonnaise instead of salad dressing.  I used large eggs and they probably could have used a little more mayo than this recipe called for.  They were a little dryer than I would have liked.  Otherwise, they all got eaten pretty fast!

I have had deviled eggs many times before but I have never made them. I just wanted a simple but good recipe and that is what this is. I like others did add a little bit more mayo but that was it. It doesn’t have to be complicated to taste good. That is why I love this recipe it’s simplicity at its finest.

This is the way my grandmother and mother made them, and consequently, the way I make them.  I use the same ingredients as listed, but I don't measure -- I go by taste and texture.  My now grown sons always ask me to make these for the holidays, so I do, and there's never any left to take home!

Honestly, everything listed but the mustard, is the way I’ve been making deviled eggs forever. Miracle Whip is the only dressing to use. And I’ve never cared for mustard nor celery in my egg mixture. Sometimes less is more!

I use fat free mayo so maybe that’s why they were not stellar, probably needs more mustard also.  Otherwise tasty and easy!

The perfect traditional deviled egg flavor. So simple! Suggestion - use a cookie press to fill the eggs. They look pretty and makes filling the eggs so easy.

This is a great basic recipe!  I used Hellmann's Light mayo instead of dressing because that's what I had, but the mixture was still a little dry so I kept adding mayo and mustard in equal measures until creamy. Taste was great! I will make this again! 

I also tried adding relish and some garlic dill pickle juice for a bit more punch!

These eggs are delicious. They are good a soon a they are done but even better after they sit for awhile in refrigerator. The garlic and dill flavors come out more. I changed the regular mayonnaise to the olive oil mayonnaise. It gives it a little more tartness. I will definitely make these again.

The ingredients for these deviled eggs is exactly the way I grew up eating them, except my mom's were always creamy. If you use the amount of Miracle Whip called for in this recipe, you will have very thick, clumpy filling that doesn't make enough for all the eggs. I had to add about 4 times the amount of Miracle Whip. Everything else was just right. Simple and tasty way to make these.

It requires 4 times the amount of Miracle Whip (aka salad dressing) than it calls for.  Otherwise it was OK.

I am giving 4 stars only because I had to add a significant amount more miracle whip than what was called for, but overall, yummy and very fast to make! Thanks for  a great recipe! I always add a black olive slice on top, it adds a good flavor.

I made this and it was great! I did make a few adjustments though. I used 9 eggs (that's what my tray holds), 3 tablespoons of mayonnaise (instead of miracle whip), 1 1/2 teaspoons yellow mustard, and I added 1/8 teaspoon of garlic powder. It's a hit!!

The ingredients were way off. Needed more salad dressing and more mayo to make them at all tasty. Basic ingredients are correct but the picture could not have been made with these proportions.

I never use edible oil products (Miracle Whip) and always use Mayo. I add more than is called for here for a creamier filling. If I'm serving these to guests I will usually pipe the filling in for a more uniform look.

This recipe was a good starting point, but I definitely had to add a lot more mayo than what the recipe called for.

3 stars as is, 5 stars with a few changes.... add 1/2 tsp onion powder, 1/4 tsp black pepper, 1/2 tsp salt, 2 tbsp sweet relish and use 2 tbsp Hellmanns mayo instead of miracle whip/dressing.

I don't know whether my egg yolk were particularly dry or the recipe adjuster was off but this was nowhere near enough salad dressing.  I had to triple the amount and I'm still not sure it was enough. Definitely an as needed/as desired ingredient.

No one I know likes Miracle Whip, so I used mayonnaise.  They turned out well, and I added a bit of cayenne on top.  They seem to disappear, even got someone that hates mustard to eat them and love them.  Thanks for the recipe.

This turned out really good. So simple. I use regular mayo instead of Miracle Whip. Or mix the two to lessen the tanginess but still keep some. Made it a few times now.

I make it with mayo or Miracle Whip but instead of mustard, I use some sweet pickle relish, it adds color and a bit of zip.  It's requested at company gatherings.

I made these, and they were very tasty. My boyfriend really liked them. I prefer to add a little bit of sugar, but he likes this recipe just the way it is.

I needed way more mayo than it called for. Plus it needed more salt and pepper but that was my fault. Once I added more salt and pepper to the eggs, they tasted pretty good. I probably should have used Miracle Whip instead of mayo to make it more creamy but I was out of it. I would make it again but with those added ingredients.

I accidentally used mustard POWDER and had to double the recipe to make up for my mistake - but still delicious! Will definitely make again.

Great basic recipe - although I needed more mayo and I added a bit of pickle juice.
