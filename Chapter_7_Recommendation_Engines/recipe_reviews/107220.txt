Being that I don't have a grill, I just baked the chicken in our oven covered in  some tinfoil instead. Cooked for 15 minutes on each side at 350F covered, then 20-30 minutes uncovered at 400F so the skin would get nice and crispy. Every time I opened the oven I placed a little more sauce on the chicken. The room smelt nice and orangey and the chicken came out tasting great. Will be making again soon.

How can something so easy taste so great?  Thank you kitchenking1 for a new favorite.  I substituted 1 tbsp. fresh sage for rubbed and green onion tops for chives because that is what was handy.  I salted and peppered the chicken before printing and checking the recipe, learning that it called for garlic salt.  So I added a crushed garlic clove to the glaze.  The chicken was heavenly and I dipped every bite in glaze!  Wow.  Next time I may need more glaze.  :o)  My husband is crazy for ginger so I may try ginger marmalade some time.  Thanks again.

The flavor is really good, however I think the cooking time is way too long.  I cut it down almost by half and the breasts were still a bit tough.

I made this for my family(2,8,12 plus husband and I) Everyone really liked it. I made this in the oven as it is winter and didn't want to BBQ. A hint for those who don't know much about Balsamic Vinegar...depending on how old and how long it is aged for will change the flavour of the vinegar. The old and longer aged ones cost more and will have a VERY pungent flavour. Please adjust your recipe or you will be disappointed by the overwhelming Balsamic aroma and taste. If you are in doubt add less the first time.

Also works great on the George Foreman grill, just leave the lid open to cook with the sauce brushed on and reduce the cooking times.

Wow - great combination of flavors!  I used boneless chicken breasts and opted for white wine vinegar vs. balsamic.  Since I didn't have garlic salt on hand I used minced garlic and a little salt.  I didn't bother cooking the marinade but rather thew everything into a ziploc bag and let it marinate all day.  The result was a moist, tender grilled chicken with a nice sweet orange flavor.  Thanks KitchenKing!

I found this quite easy to make and it turned out great. If you are cooking for less than 4 though definitely cut back on how much your putting in the sauce.

This recipe stays in my Recipe Box! This was very good on the first day, my husband said it was even better on the second day. I chose to use boneless chicken breast and pound the breast to about 1/4-1/2 inch thick. It was pouring rain, so I broiled the chicken.  Very good. Thanks!

Perhaps I did something wrong...I followed the recipe. Just the smell of the balsamic mixture was horrible. I thought it'd taste better when done but it didn't. All I tasted was vinegar. No orange flavor what so ever. I even made an orange sauce out of more marmalade, fresh oranges and orange juice and soaked chicken in it, nothing could get rid of that horrible vinegar taste. Will never do this again.

This is pretty darn tasty!  I wanted to use up some chicken and some marmalade and voila, I came upon this recipe.  I baked it in the oven because it's February and I live in Canada, 'nuf said.  I found the sauce that dripped onto the pan burned easily.  Also, the sauce burns easily when you are heating it in the pot.  I used sage and rosemary in the glaze and it tasted great.

I cook chicken at least twice a week, so am always looking for something different.  I was intrigued by the combination of marmalade and balsamic, so decided to try it.  We loved it!  Very easy, and very delicious!

Perfect!  I made as directed with the exception of fresh sage for the rubbed.  This is absolutely fantastic!  Thank you!  Oh, and I grilled it in the oven.

Definitely a keeper.  I doubled the glaze recipe but went a little less than double on the marmalade as I prefer more tang and less sweet.  I found the chicken cooked quickly in my oven on the grill pan so I turned it after 10 minutes and began glazing it right away.  I used a good pouring of the glaze to coat some cut up peppers, broccoli and red onions and grilled them as well. The glaze on the broccoli was outstanding.

I LOVED this!  The only changes I made were using marjoram instead of sage (because that's what I had on hand), slightly less balsamic vinegar (out of concern after reading the other reviews), and using boneless skinless chicken breasts.  The cooking time was way off for our little charcoal grill.  I think they were done in about 20 minutes total.  So, watch them closely and don't count on needing 55 minutes). My three children all liked it.  My husband thought it was good (although, he didn't love it as much as I did).  If you like balsamic vinegar and orange, you'll probably really enjoy it. I did not find the vinegar overwhelming at all.  My favorite chicken recipe yet!  Thanks!

It was plenty tasty, but my husband didn't care for it. He doesn't like anything too sweet and this was too sweet for his taste. I would like to try it again with maybe sugar free marmalade...I liked the combination of the orange with the vinegar, and the fresh chives were a nice touch.

This didn't wow me, although I didn't have enough marmalade and had to use orange peel and oj to make up for it and I think that just threw off the whole marinade.  I will try it again when I have enough marmalade.

Yummy!  Nice presentation.  I used half the balsamic because I was afraid it would be overwhelming.  A little more orange flavor would have been nice, but good enough.

This is excellent. I just finished eating and will definately be making this again soon.  I used fresh sage and didn't have chives on hand so I minced up some red onion.  Was delicious! Very subtle flavor in the chicken alone but with the sauce it really pops!

This is a great sauce! I made as written, but didn't have fresh chives, so used dried. I grilled chicken breasts on the foreman grill.  Basted each side and turned frequently basting each time.  I think the only thing I'd change is a little less balsamic vinegar and more marmalade to make it sweeter.  Other than that, very, very good!

Even my son who hates anything 'citrusy' on his meat thought this was awesome!    I liked it because it was easy and you don't have to marinate the chicken ahead of time.  Very good!  But like someone else said, the quality of your balsamic vinegar can make or break the recipe.

WOW this was soooo good! I did it a little different, wrapping it in foil and cooking it in the oven, but it was really good. I used half chicken breasts, and each of my toddlers ate a whole chicken breast to themselves! This is coming from the two HARDEST to feed little girls in the world! lol they loved it!

Fantastic on the grill!  Use the smaller chicken tenders for faster cooking time.

I found the sauce to be a bit to sweet for my taste and I'm not sure the flavors all went together.

Super Easy! I didn't measure anything. I used more marmalade and less balsamic vinegar. So I didn't do it exactly as suggested. But it turned out Great. I heated the ingredients in skillet on stove then put in a few chicken drumsticks reduced to low and then covered with a lid. I probably cooked it for about 25 minutes. It was yummy!

I made this for dinner the other day and couldn't believe how easy it was for me!  As most meals these days are "culinary adventures" for me, this was truly easy and VERY delicious!  My food tester thought it was awesome as well!

It was ok, but I was disappointed, especially given all the great reviews.  The orange flavor was too understated... maybe some fresh orange zest or some orange concentrate would have helped.  I made it with only half the balsamic vinegar, but added the remaining 2 T. as rice wine vinegar.  Still bland.  I added some orange juice, freshly grated ginger, garlic chili sauce, fresh garlic, and a touch of dark sesame oil.  It was better, but still thin.  I made a slurry with oj and cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  Since the orange flavor was so muted, I cut the chicken into little pieces and cooked them in the sauce in a frying pan.  Served with white rice and broccoli.  I think I'll keep searching.

I followed the recipe for the sauce exactly, but decided against even trying it on the chicken. I am sublimely curious as to why other people got different results. I used Smuckers orange marmalade, and I quadruple check the recipe proportions. The combination of the marmalade, vinegar, olive oil, and sage just looked revolting, like a black goop coated in oil. This didn't change when I warmed it in the saucepan as directed. I have no idea how black translates to orange chicken, but it smelled strongly of vinegar and just tasted strange. My husband ended up just dumping it in the sink while I was re-reading and re-reading the recipe. Neither of us can figure out why this happened and why it wasn't reported in other reviews, and we ultimately just found another recipe for orange-ish sauce on this website, which was still mediocre. My search for a good orange chicken recipe is still ongoing.

This was so easy!  I am mostly vegetarian and have been for years so my experience cooking meat of any kind is exceptionally limited but this was still so simple.  I did it in the oven following the directions that someone else gave here: bake at 350 covered for 15 minutes on each side, then uncovered for the remaining 20-30 minutes at 400, flipping occassionally and brushing with sauce each time you flip.  My pan had lots of juices at the end of it and the chicken itself was very moist.  You could really taste the orange flavor and the balsamic gave it a nice tanginess.  I left out the sage because I just didn't have any and the chives because my dad hates them.  I served it with almond rice pilaf from this site, honey-glazed carrots and roasted baby potatoes (I love my carbs).  My entire family loved it although my sister noted that she would cut down on the balsamic or use a little more marmalade.  I, however, loved it as it was and will definately make again soon.  One last thing, I didn't use Garlic salt as I didn't have any and used a garlic paste instead but instead of rubbing the chicken with it (my hands would smell for days), I added about a teaspoon of the garlic paste to the sauce.

we used tenders for this recipe. i marinated the chicken in some of the glaze for about 3 hours, then basted it when grilling. i forgot to reserve some for dipping but it didn't need it. i had guest over and they asked for the recipe. served with white rice.

Easy to follow recipe, good taste.  I think that next time I might marinate the chicken in the mixture and also baste it.  I wanted more of the orange flavor.

I made this for my mom and she loved it so much that she went out and bought another pack of chicken so I could make it again. I used Mrs.Dash garlic and herb seasoning for the chicken and green onions for the sauce, other than that I followed the recipe to a "T".

I did what another reviewer did and baked it at 350 for the same grilling times in the recipe.  This chicken was juicy and delicious.  While the Balsamic vinegar seems overpowering at first (my bf left the kitchen saying it stank), it's integral to this recipe.  It gives it it's tang.  And there were no complaints about a stink later!  We devoured that chicken!  I'll definitely be making this one again!

Very tasty! I used 4 chicken leg quarters. I used green onions instead of chives, since that's what I had in my garden. I also substituted 1/2 tsp. ground sage. I substituted garlic powder for garlic salt. For me personally, the vinegar taste was a little strong when using as a sauce. Next time I would just use it all to glaze the meat with. Would make again.

We really, really liked this. I used BLSL chicken, peppers, and onions and did kebabs of this, then drenched the kebabs in the untainted sauce when it was all done. I did marinate in soy instead of just dusting with salt. This doesn't come out with a distinctly Asian flavor, or an orange flavor, or a vinegar flavor, but somewhere delicious in between. A wonderful sweet & sour flavor. We decided we would make this again, with most any flavor of jam or jelly that we had on hand. Thanks for sharing, this is absolutely going in the keeper box!

Loved this but used half the Balsamic. I had a bottle from a specialty shop so perhaps the flavor was more intense. I used boneless chicken breasts but didn't cut them up. I will definitely make this again! Thanks!

It was good, but for me, the balsamic overpowered the orange. If I make it again, I will cut down on the balsamic.

This was great and easy to put together.  I served with fried rice.  The only change I made was to broil in oven because it's winter, and to add alittle cornstarch to thicken sauce.  Thanks for sharing, I will make this again.

Made this tonight, exactly as it is here, after a quick "grilled" search. Very good! It takes a lot to sway my husband and I away from our homemade bbq chicken on the grill, but I will definitely make this for us again.

We love this recipe.  It was easy to make and tasted great! It's winter here so I didn't grill the chicken. Instead I butterflied some chicken breasts and lightly floured them, pan-seared each side until it was golden brown, poured the sauce over and baked in the oven. A definite keeper! 6/16/09: This time I made this on the grill and it wasn't as great. I think that butterflying the chicken and cooking it in the oven allowed the flavors to infuse more into the chicken. The family agrees that grilled this only deserves 4 stars.

Very good, I cut the chicken into 2" chunks, and marinated for 1 day, then baked it in the marinade, when it was done I put the chicken over brown rice and reduced the marinade/juices and poured over the top.  Very flavorful but by no means overpowering, serve w/ steamed pea pods, and honey ginger carrots (on this website).  Thanks!

I cook this for my family all the time.  I use a dash of dry sage and it works just as well.  I also use boneless chicken breasts and it is wonderful.  You can also cook this in the oven in the sauce and it is just as tasty as on the grill!

I thought this recipe was pretty bland, but it may be that I used too inexpensive a marmalade -- I bought cheap since I knew I'd be using it as marinade. If I were making this recipe again, I'd get a better marmalade with potentially more flavor. Even though I wasn't that crazy with the results, my family gobbled down every piece. Thumbs up from them, all around!

This is awsome!!  I made this the other night for supper, and it was a hit!  I had open jars of both orange marmalade, and peach preserves, and I combined the two of them and it turned out great.  Used the extra sauce to put over the chicken.  Thanks for the recipe!

Loved this dish, like many others said the cooking time is too long. I doubled the sauce and we served the chicken with multi grain rice and poured the extra sauce over it. The kids even loved it which is a huge win.

Very easy and tasty. Thanks to the other commenters who suggested baking/broiling the chicken verses grilling.

I marinated my chicken in fresh orange juice over night before brushing with glaze. The citrus flavor of the marinated chicken is what compliments the glaze.

It was really good.  I cooked it in the oven with foil over it and it took about 45 minutes at 350.  We loved it.

I used home made kumquat marmalade.  I cut cornish game hens in half and baked for 45 minutes, basting for the last 15 minutes. The marmalade and balsamic vinegar went well together. Thanks!

It's funny cuz the sauce tasted so good... but none of it actually went IN to the chicken. i cut down the recipe in half, but followed directions directly. doubled the amount of garlic salt called for and baked the thighs in the oven instead of grilling.  i can proudly say that i failed at producing this dish, but it's ok. i'm not going to give it up yet. when i come up with a good way of incorporating the sauce, i'll repost!  i'm thinking pounded, deboned thighs.  thanks for the recipe KitchenKing

I am not sure I'll try this one again.  I am not a big fan of sage so I did cut that in 1/2, there wasn't that strong of an orange flavor.  If I do try it again I'll probably add some orange zest.  Not bad... just OK.

I hate to be mean but I did not care for this recipe. I was a little reluctant to make it because of a few negative reviews from "Expert's" but I figured that I would give it a try because I love Orange Chicken. The flavors just don't work, too much balsamic flavor - not enough orange flavor. Dinner was saved by adding Sweet & Sour sauce to it.

I followed the recipe (aside from cooking in the oven as opposed to the grill) and just found the dish okay. I think I was hoping for the Chinese restaurant Orange chicken. This sauce was fairly runny and not as thick as I was hoping. The chicken didn't really seem to soak up the flavor like I was hoping. We may try again and just add some more spices and marinate the chicken to see if that helps.  Thanks!

Tangy, easy, and delicious.  I used Quorn (fake chicken) and omitted the chives because I didn't happen to have any handy.  I added minced garlic and crushed red peppers to the marmalade and vinegar mixture to give it a little more punch.  Lastly, I broiled the "chicken" rather than grilling it.  I served this with homemade mashed potatoes and rolls and it was delicious.  The 15 year old in my home ate every bite so he adds his implicit stamp of approval. ;)

I thought this recipe was very good.  I had some leftover baked chicken that was breaded and wanted something to put on top so I made this orange sauce and thought it was great.  I read some of the reviews before I made it and did cut down on the vinegar by almost half and thought it had a great taste to it.  I didn't have any sage so I omitted that and still thought it was great.  I will definitely make this sauce again.  Thank you for sharing.

This recipe is fantastic.  What a different taste to chicken.  I had to make some changes because I am a diabetic, I used sugar free marmalade, Raspberry Pecan Vinagrette in place of the balsamic because it was all that I had. My father (also a diabetic) loved it.  Very nice change... I will use this recipe again and again. Yummmmmm

Wonderful recipe. Didn't change a thing. Definately recommed saving some of the marinade and the marmalade for after. Great dinner if you like an orange flavor to your chicken that's not too strong.

This chicken was wonderful. I am new to the kitchen, but when I made this for my fiance she wanted second and thirds. Easy to make. Follow the recipe to a T and it will come out good.  If you want it to be sweeter, just add a little more Orange marmalade. This deserves 5 stars

First recipe I tried with a bottle of Balsamic given to me as a Christmas gift. 

The second time I made it, in a pinch I used 3/4 tsp of Penzey's Florida Seasoned Pepper in place of the garlic salt and black pepper. It really kicked up the marmalade - has some orange rind in it, I believe. Either way, we make it that way every time now.

Great alongside some grilled onion, zucchini and corn.
