I made the recipe as is and the cloves and cinnamon are really overpowering. Quite disappointing. I might double the vanilla, use half the cinnamon and no cloves next time. I didn't read the reviews and went by the almost 5 stars to assume it was a good recipe. After reading, most reviewers didn't use the spice so it was a bit misleading with the high rating.

I’ve made lots of puffed wheat squares and this was the best recipe yet. Easy, peasy too. The only thing I didn’t use was the cloves, just because I didn’t have any. One bit of advice for newbies, I’ve made good batches and bad batches that wouldn’t hold together well. The author is right. Use butter and once the ingredients come to a full boil DO NOT boil for more than 1 minute. It won’t hold the puffed wheat together and set well.

I made this last night. It was great, just like the kind they sell at the coffee shop in my office. The only changes I made were no spices and extra vanilla. Very good. I'll definitely be making these again (today! Because we already finished the last batch)

Made it without spices this time, and without extra "goo". Recommend not boiling the mixture too long - I boiled it for 3 minutes, and it ended up a little on the dry side - fairly crunchy and not too soft. It holds together well, but I think if I don´t boil it as long, it will end up a little chewier. Great flavour, will try cinnamon another time, or perhaps a little powdered coffee.

Delicious!   It's like nothing I've ever tasted with the addition of cinnamon and clove.  But yummy none the less!

I'm not a chocolate fan.  So I omitted the chocolate and cinnamon and cloves.  I added a squirt more syrup and used plain Cheerios as its what I had on hand.

I omitted the spices and doubled the syrupy sauce.  I increased the puffed wheat to 10 cups from 8.  It was perfectly delicious and a hit with my family.

really yummy! I only used 7 cups of puffed wheat cereal; next time will probably use a little less for more goo factor.

These are super yummy! I couldn't find puffed wheat so I used puffed rice from the health food store. Like a previous reviewer, I doubled all of the "goo".  It was just the right amount! I didn't quite double the brown sugar, I used one and a half cups, loosely packed.  And I decided to not add the cinnamon and cloves.  Yummy yummy!

I was looking for a nice gooey puffed wheat square recipe. I made 1 1/2 recipes of the goo for the 8 cups of puffed wheat and honestly I can't imagine what it would taste like with only one! Next time I will double the batch of goo as it still wasn't quite as gooey as I had hoped even with the 1 1/2 times the goo. I loved the cinnamon addition to it as well although only added 1/2 tsp as recommended by some other reviewers - I didn't have cloves to try in it. Great recipe but if you like your squares gooier just make a larger batch of the goo or add less puffed wheat for a smaller pan.

This was a big hit!  I only used half the amount of spices called for to give a very subtle hint of the spice.  Will make again.
