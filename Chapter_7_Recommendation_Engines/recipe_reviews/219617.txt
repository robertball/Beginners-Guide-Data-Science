These were so tasty! I made 2 changes to the recipe, though. I cut out the tapioca and added a crumb topping like on dutch apple pie. My husband loved them!!! No need for the tapioca in my opinion.

I used the pie dough recipe from allrecipes.com - it is excellent - I bought the 6 inch ceramic pie plates from Hamilton Beach - then got this recipe - did not have tapioca so added 2 T. flour to thicken - thought it was very good -- would definitely make them again. Great if you are only 1 or 2 for dinner and want apple pie - not to much just enough with a little bit of vanilla ice cream --- YUM MO

I made these for Thanksgiving using muffin pans instead of mini pie pans. Thankfully I had Teflon tins because I don't know how I would have removed them in tact otherwise. The pies were a big hit with my family and I will definitely be making these again. I shortened the baking time to 25 minutes and they were perfect. Had to let them cool a while before removing with the help of a thin spatula.

Perfect. I didn't use the tapioca and added about 2 teaspoons of flour. I also used half white and half brown sugar and microwaved the apples in lemon juice for 45 seconds. Twas yummy!! PS I DID use a muffin pan instead and will upload a photo asap. Some came right out, but the ones that I over filled (made 7 could have made 8 in a regular sized muffin tin)  not so much. Yummmmmy, thank you for sharing!!

These were pretty good! I didn't   use the tapioca though. I added flour (about 2 teaspoons). I also added brown sugar in the filling and also mixed some with butter and and put it on the top of the pies for the last 5-7 min of baking pretty good!

I’m sorry to say this but I cheated LOL I actually used apple pie filling because it’s faster and it’s already flavoured! This was my first time making them so the picture wasn’t the best PLUS I used large muffin tins rather then the smaller ones! Definitely a huge success and once they’re cooled.......I froze some of them in case company shows up unexpectedly!! Just thaw and reheat ithe oven for 15 mins @ 200 F

Nice basic recipe.  Reduced the temp to 375 and baked a little longer for that and because I used a ceramic pan and did a streusel topping - 30 min covered with foil, the last 10 min without the foil.

I loved this recipe! super quick and easy, warmed the house right up on a crips fall day.  huge hit with the whole family (ages 12-92)I used two pre made crusts and about 6 or 7 large apples (about a pound each, skinned and cored). a healthy mix of gala, golden delicious, empire, and granny smith were used.
*I substituted tapioca starch for all purpose flour in a 1:1 ratio. mix and let sit about 5 mins. works just the same.
*lemon juice didn't have a measurement listed, so I used 1 capful, roughly equal to 1 tbsp. for the apple mix I used.

I didn't use the tapioca and nutmeg. I needed it real simple. Plus, I made my own crust for the pie from scratch.

Hubby liked this more than I.  We won't be making it again though because of the work to make.  It is much easier to make a whole pie when going through the chore (I hate peeling things) of peeling the apples.  Also it was hard to find something that would give me a 6" round to cut the crust.  It seemed like all we got was a lot of crust & not much filling & I used a 5 3/4" bottom of a baking bowl I finally found.  I put the crust in individual taco bowl for decoration cause I had nothing else to use. The recipe also doesn't give how much lemon juice to use so I splashed some in the apple mixture thinking it is for helping the apples not turn color.
