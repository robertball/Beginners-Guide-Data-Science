I am only reviewing the pork loin part of the recipe.  Very tasty and moist.

Excellent.  Our local grocery store does not carry fennel, and I wanted the flavor added to it so I used a little fennel seed.  I did not have any white wine so I did not use wine, could have used red, but decided not.  The flavor was excellent with out any wine.  I just made a regular gravy with the drippings, it was great. I will be using this recipe again.  Thank you for a great recipe.

As much as we love rosemary (we grow it all over our property), we thought it was waaay too much. It totally overpowers the pork, which will be cooked to a hockey puck if you follow the instructions in this recipe. We will not make this again, but if you really want to try it this is what I suggest: 1) put only sliced or minced garlic into the pockets cut in the roast. 2) make a minced fresh rosemary and olive oil mixture with salt and pepper to taste; lightly spread over the roast. 3) cook the pork in a pre-heated 325 degree oven for 20 minutes/pound. Check with a digital thermometer. Pork is done at 145 degrees. The veggies prepped as instructed wll be done. Let roast rest 3 minutes. Eat. 

Note: Deglazng with wine is optional. Personally, I think just drinking the wine is better.

Served this recipe for Easter.  It was a hit and I only had a little bit left for the next day. It was great leftover too. I did not use fennel cause I couldn't find it in the grocery store.  It didn't taste like I was missing anything. Still really good! It was also very easy to make. Thanks for the great recipe!

I added beef broth after I had taken the roast out and the carrots and potatoes were still in the pan. I was worried the veggies would be too dry but by adding the the beef broth caramelized and make them yummy and moist.

I used dried rosemary and fennel and it was just fine.  Definitely don't need to cook it as long as the recipe says. I'd say put the potatoes in after 20 minutes of roasting. Baste every 15 minutes  until tests done. Delicious!

Very yummy!  I used baby carrots and sweet potatoes instead.  It came out very delicious.  I think it needs a little more spices (I did use a larger loin but had compensated with more spices, but def think it needs a little more.)   Didn't need the full time it stated in recipe and it was a little dry (but it's pork) I haven't been able to make non-dry pork. Tips? :)

Very easy recipe. I liked the herbs used and enjoyed the roasted vegetables. Unfortunately I did not have fennel so just added extra of the other veggies. Would love to try with fennel as I love the flavor.
