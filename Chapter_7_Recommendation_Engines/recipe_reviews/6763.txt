Wow. That bread is fantastic! I'm going to make this recipe a staple around our house. I used 1/2 cup of honey, and it was a very subtle flavor, I also increased the salt by 1/2 tsp and exchanged one cup of white flour for another of wheat. I had to allow for very long rising times since it's winter - they were a full inch above the pan when I put the in the oven. The result is a beautifully fluffy texture that's full of flavor.  I just made this a second time, and added a 1/2 cup of quick oats. This made for a heartier texture, great for sandwich bread!

Great recipe.  Every time I make it, the two loaves are gone within a day.  We like it with double the amount of honey.  The only suggestion is to make sure you cook it in a freshly heated oven.  Don't try baking it after cooking something else in a higher temperature.  Even if you reduce the temperature, the oven is still too hot and the outside of the bread cooks faster than the inside, therefore making a doughy inside.  I'm fairly new at bread baking and have found this to be an easy and tasty bread.

this is a great bread - the texture is just like store bought and it's really easy to make. ***** 5 stars = "the best"
I read that some people said it took too long to rise - i use to have that problem with baking my own bread, too - but i don't anymore - all you have to do is let it rise in a warm oven - i put my at 50-degrees C. for 45 minutes for the first rise and 30 minutes for the second rise. it's turns out perfect every time. this recipe also doesn't use egg or milk  - it's super tasty, too - hmmm mmm good!

The quest is over! This recipe has replaced store bought bread for my family. It has a great texture, a short ingredient list, and uses honey as a sweetener, which I can get locally. Goodbye store bread with weird chemicals packaged in plastic bags shipped to me from who knows where! :)

I have to give this recipe 5 and a half stars.  This was my first time making any kind of bread.  I read at least 40 reviews to get different perspectives.  I followed all the directions to the tee.  I made sure to have all my things together so I could move along smoothly.  I used a baby thermometer to make sure my water was 110 degrees.  I know this sounds absurd but I just had a baby and I have at least four new ones sitting around the house.  I was really scared that the water would be too hot or not hot enough.  I waited about two minutes to add the honey.  I added the flour one cup at a time.  It was easy to stir when I added the three cups of wheat flour.  Once I got to the third cup of all purpose flour I started to worry that I was stirring it too much.  So I transferred the mixture to my stand mixer with the dough hook.  I added the last two cups of flour and let it knead for 10 minutes.  I am glad I decided to put the dough in a gigantic plastic bowl to rise instead of leaving it in the mixing bowl because it would not have fit once it rose.  I cut my oven on pre heat and cut it off after two or three minutes.  Just enough to get it warm.  I sutck the dough in to rise.  After punching the dough down I made to loaf shapes and put them in the greased pans.  I needed the oven to begin to pre heat for baking so I put them in the microwave this time.  I didnt cut it on just stuck them in there.  It took 30 minutes for them to rise again.  To my surprise when I took them

Very good bread.  It was easily halved to use in my bread machine, and it came out nice and soft.  Bf liked it, which means I will probably make it again because he's not a big fan of wheat bread.  I did use a 1/2 c more of wheat flour, modifying the amount of white flour in response.

I bake a lot of bread & have found that the most reliable way to measure flour is by weight. 4.5 oz. = one cup. Using this method will keep you from adding more flour than the recipe intends. If you have no way of weighing the flour, lightly spoon the flour into the measuring cup & gently level without compressing the flour. Also, don't feel you must use all the flour the recipe calls for. Once it has a soft consistency & has lost the tacky feel, you've probably added all the flour you need.

Great recipe.  This was my first bread and it was very easy and delicious. I doubled the honey as per the other reviews and it was very good.  I'll make this again.

Wow.  I'm new at bread, and this recipe has really boosted my confidence!  It always comes out perfectly, even in my little toaster oven.  My husband raves about it and brags to all his friends at work about his homemade sandwich bread... and you can imagine the points I gained with my new mother-in-law!  It makes nice French toast after a few days... but don't count on there being any leftovers.  I've been making it twice a week to rave reviews.  Thank you!

This bread was great.  My husband and I loved it.  Other reviewers had said something seemed to be missing, and I think I found it.  I added I package of maple and brown sugar instant oatmeal to the recipe... really good.  You may have to add less flour.  Otherwise, I made it just the same.  Very good.

This is a great! I have made it about 15 times now and we love it. Will never buy store bought bread again. Even my husband said so!  To health it up a bit more, I have been using 5 cups whole wheat to 2 cups white. I just use two packs of yeast instead of 1 and I replaced the oil with 1/2 cup of natural apple sauce. I also add more honey, about 2/3 cups because we like it sweeter and a pinch more of salt.  I also mix the salt into the whole wheat flour instead of the yeast/water/honey mixture. I found my rise is better this way. Thanks for sharing!

Wow! A honey and wheat bread my husband will eat! It's a regular in my kitchen every week and believe me it goes fast.  I add a liitle extra honey, up to a 1/3 cup, for extra sweetness.  If you've never baked before this is an easy one.

For all you newbie bread bakers: the proportions on this recipe are all wrong.  You can't put in 7 freaking' cups of flour and 2 cups of water and have it turn out.  It needs to be 3 1/2 cups of water.  (Also, the picture at the top is of bread that was allowed to over-rise.  My husband used to be a commercial baker -- he knows his stuff.)

WOW! This was excellent. Seriously, look no further if you would like a simple and delicious recipe. My girls loved it and I have picky eaters and my littlest has allergies so it was nice that this was egg and milk free. I noticed some people said they had a difficult time working all 7 cups of flour into the mix. First, you should be sure you are using a cup for measuring dry ingredients (not liquids!). Next if you are digging your cup into the flour you are doing it incorrectly! You should actually be using a scoop to sprinkle into the cup then level with a flat surface (like the back of a knife). This is crucial because digging into the flour with the cup may cause flour to get packed tightly (not what you want!) you will think you measured 7 cups and you really have 8 or 9! Hope that helps! If you get down to your last bit of flour and the dough seems a little dry don't be afraid to dampen your hands with a little water to  work the last bit in, which is what I had to do. I thought the recipe was excellent and I would definitely recommend it.

This was my first time making bread, so I prepared myself for failure, but this bread turned out amazing! Yummo! However I made a few changes, partly because I had to! I thought my kitchen aid would explode! I could only use 3 1/2 cups of flour. I also increased the honey to a 1/2 cup and substituted applesauce for the oil. It did take about 25-30 extra minutes to rise. Anyways, regardless of almost killing my kitchen aid with so much flour, this bread was absolutely delicious!! It boosted my confidence for making bread!

Delicious bread! Turned out perfect with these small adjustments: used bread flour instead of all-purpose; increased honey to 1/2 cup; added 1/2 cup quick oats with the flour; added 2 tsp vital wheat gluten to improve the rise and texture. (I always add one tsp vital wheat gluten per cup of whole wheat flour. Same goes for using all-purpose instead of bread flour - 1 tsp gluten per cup.) Definitely a keeper!

So easy! Used my stand Kitchenaid mixer. Kneaded for 10 minutes. Let rise in a warm oven both times. I added 1/2 cup quick oats to dough, and used 1/2 cup of honey. When I placed them in pans for the second rise, I first brushed tops with milk and sprinkled on quick oats. Then let rise final time (took 45 mn for second rise) and baked at 375 for 23 minutes only. Took out of oven, brushed tops with melted butter. We had ours with homemade cinnamon, honey butter.

Great recipe, I put a little less flour than it called for, and used 2 cups of bread flour instead of using just all-purpose. Came out great, will definitely make again!

We love it! I doubled the recipe and added an egg to each bowl of dough (I use two when doubling a recipe for convenience). It had a lovely, dense texture without being too thick. I find it crumbs better with the egg included. Made 2 loaves and a pan of dinner rolls plus a braided loaf as well. I did an egg wash on the braid and rolls and sprinkled it with oats. Fantastic for bulk baking. Will try multi-grain with this next time.

1st time was a flop but my husband was really the one that kneaded and did the rising and loaf shaping so I can't give the recipe fault for that. 2nd time I followed the recipe exactly and used my kitchen aid with the dough hook then kneaded the last minute by hand to get the dough smooth.  I wend to www.baking911.com and read up on bread making which helped give me more insight on the specific steps of bread making. Very tasty - the whole family likes this.

Turned out great! Nice big loaves that stayed fresh for days & didn't dry out. Great for sandwiches & french toast! My family loved it. Older son ate a whole loaf in one day! I did have trouble adding all of the regular flour though & stopped at about 4 1/3 cups, & did add about 2 tbsp. flax seed. Thanks I will be making it every week!

I made this bread yesterday following the recipe as written. The dough was smooth and elastic and an absolute pleasure to work with. I baked the full time alloted (30 minutes) and found that the loaves came out perfectly done. A light, flakey crust on the outside with a moist, slightly chewy and  wonderfully flavorful center. Just enough of a sweet honey taste. 

I will make this over and over. One of the best whole wheat sandwich loaves I have found. This is now my new "standard" wheat bread recipe. Thanks so much for sharing!

A very easy recipe but VERY bland. I usually love multi grain bread but decided to try this recipe since it was homemade bread and I will not be trying again. Soo plain even with 1/2 cup of honey instead of 1/3 cup.

There is way too much flour in this recipe. I couldn't even get all of it to mix with adding more water to the recipe. Also without letting the yeast sit for a few minutes it took almost 4 hours for it to rise. It baked nicely but even with using double the honey it tastes like flour.

This was my first time ever making homemade bread and it was a success! Thank you so much for this easy recipe. The only thing I did differently was to do 3 cups whole wheat flour and 4 cups all-purpose.

Don't let the ease of this recipe fool you - it's great!  I used one less cup of flour and liked the moist texture.  Lovely!

Simple loaf made with on-hand staples everyone is sure to have.  Has a great crumb and a very predictable behavior when rising.  I make three of these loaves at a time to be efficient.  One is sliced and the other two frozen until use.  This bread has held up for a week bagged at room temp.  This is definitely a staple in my home now.  It makes awesome French toast.

Great bread!  I made the dough in my bread machine and then baked it in the oven so it would have a more natural shape.  Light, fluffy and tasty!.  My 3 year old especially enjoyed it as toast for breakfast.   If I were to make it for sandwiches, I would probably cut down the honey by a little bit.  It was a little more sweet than I expected.  Thanks for the recipe.  We will make it again soon.  One other thing, the fact it did not include eggs is a huge plus for our family as my son is allergic to them.  Thanks!

Honestly, the loaves turned out beautiful...they looked like they would taste GREAT!  Great texture and everything. BUT- I followed the recipe EXACTLY, and the bread was so BLAND.  I added a little more honey though, and even this didn't help.  I think it probably needs more salt..and definitely less flour.  It tasted very very floury.  I'll be trying other recipes on the site!

Both my husband and I have tried this recipe but are unable to get more than 3 cups of white flour into the dough. We have to let it rise longer than allotted time.

This is a wonderful never fail whole wheat bread recipe which is lighter than most.  I have tweaked it a bit.  In addition the the whole wheat flour, I also use rye flour, ground flax seed, some whole flax seed, oatmeal and cracked red wheat.  Then I don't use as much white flour and have a very healthy, fiber rich multi-grain bread.  You can use whatever grains you have on hand.  It's still a light and wonderful bread.

Words can't express this bread!  If the bread seems bland to you, try increasing salt by about 1/2 tsp.  Also suggests a little extra honey for sweeter bread.

Great recipe! The only things I changed was I used white wheat flour and 2 tablespoons of yeast and I sprinkled oats on top before baking. The flavor is delicious. The loaf came out slightly heavy though. I prefer it a little bit lighter, but it could have been something I did or the slight changes I made since I'm a novice bread maker still. 
I gave 5 stars because my family loved it!

I just took it out of the oven ten minutes ago and shared a slice with my granddaughter.  Delicious.  I took other people's suggestions and doubled the honey.  I used the exact amount of flour it called for and thought it was not going to come out right as it was very difficult to knead and I read the comments of others, AFTER I had added all the flour, kneaded it and stuck it in the oven to proof.  (my oven has a bread proof setting.) It took twice as much time to rise, both times.   However, it was worth it, it is delicious.  I will make this again.

This is a staple in our house.  Thanks to some of the reviews I realized I had been putting too much white flour into it.  Made some the correct way yesterday and it's even better.  My family loves it!  I only use about 4.5C of white flour, and I measure the weight of the flour out on a mail scale (4.5oz per cup).  Otherwise I follow the recipe to the tee!

Fantastic- and healthy!!! My whole family loves it and they are always begging me to make it. It takes a while, but it is totally worth it! But for some reason, although the bread is fully risen and looks perfect when I put it in the oven, it collapses a little bit while it is being cooked. So the middle is just a little caved in, not too bad though. We still love it, this does not affect the taste!!!

I thought this bread tasted just okay. I liked that it was not really sweet like other breads with honey, but it also didn't have much flavor either as a result. The dough was so thick I thought it was going to break my Kitchen-Aid. I ended up adding about 3 tsp. of water extra to it, just to get it to soften a bit. I ended up having to finish the kneading by hand to avoid damaging my KA. I think I would have enjoyed making this recipe more if it just made one loaf. I don't have a lot of people to feed and it just means extra work in all aspects of making the bread. On the first rise I gave it 1 1/2 hours and 1 hour on the 2nd one as it didn't specify. The dough did rise and bake up well and also had a nice appearance. However, it cut a few nice slices then just became crumbily.

I am a first time bread maker.  We chose to do this because of all the junk in store bought bread.  I have made this recipe 4 times now and each time it gets a little better and a little easier.  The first time I added 3 c wheat flr and 4c white flr.  It was like kneading a rock!  It was good for toast.  Now I add 2 c wheat and 4 cup white knowing I add more white flr. as a knead it.  The family likes it and I freeze the other loaf until we need it.  Because there are no preservatives the bread tends to dry out in less than a week,

This is a very nice bread and excellent toasted the next morning after baking.  I ended only using 3 cups of all-purpose flour, the dough was getting stiff while mixing, but I probably added 1 more cup while kneeding the dough.  I think it needs a liitle more honey for taste.

This was a great recipe once I doubled the amount of yeast... first try did not rise with only one tablespoon of yeast, thought it odd as my usual breads are about 1 tablespoon per loaf... none the less i dumped first go and went at it again with two tablespoons of yeast and 2 teaspoons of salt-perfect

Love this recipe! Especially great when you're out of eggs and milk. I use brown sugar instead of honey and just make one big, irregular-shaped loaf instead. It has too cook just a little bit longer, but saves some trouble. I love how this has very little hands-on time.

For a novice bread maker, this recipe was A+.  I ended up with two good looking and tasty loaves that had a light texture and crumb.  I will definitely use this recipe again.  My only change was to use 3 1/2 cups, not 5, of ap flour.

I asked my grandma what her wheat bread recipe was, since it tasted delicious. Her recipe was complicated, but it included honey instead of sugar, and wheat, so I thought this recipe would be a good fit. I followed the recipe exactly, and it was OK. The bread is shaped like a rectangle (completely fat on top) and it was pretty dense. It tastes OK, but doesn't have much flavor. I realize that wheat take time to rise, or sometimes doesn't rise at all, and maybe that was part of my problem. Also, I live in a high altitude, so that may may a difference. Overall....it was just....OK.

I am a newbie with bread and followed the directions except for substituting a cup of white wheat flour for one of the all-purpose to give it more gluten content and had trouble getting the bread to rise.  The loaves still came out very soft and tasty though.  Next time I will add more water.  The protein level in the flour is very high, which means it will absorb more liquid, so according to King Arthur flour, you should add two teaspoons extra liquid per cup of flour to the recipe you are using. So just a bit more water and a warmer place to rest and rise should do the trick!

This is a great recipe to start off with, though I join most of the group with making slight changes.
I added 2 tbs of vital wheat gluten and used bread flour instead of all-purpose. You don't need 5 cups of flour either. I used about 2 1/2 - 3 cups of bread flour. I used coconut oil instead of vegetable. Lastly, I upped the salt by half a tsp.
I had to let it raise for an hour for both raises. Last time I baked this I made 1 loaf of fantastic sandwich bread and a dozen rolls. Brushed butter and honey on top of the rolls right out of the oven! SO good! Thanks!

i was excited to see how many stars this bread got so i tried it. i didn't like that it was called "wheat" when more than half the flour was white. so instead of the 5 c of all-purp i put in 2 c whole wheat. i also added 4 tsp of vital wheat gluten. so i started to add the 5 c flour mix and i alsmost had about 1 c left and i thought something wasn't right. i just assumed since the recipe didn't say that i might not need all of it, i made sure it all went in. wrong! it was so thick and tough. no way could it be kneaded. i tried to save it by letting it rise twice in the microwave with some boiled water and it helped it rise but it didn't double and barely rose a second time. the finished product smelled great and tasted good, thats why it got at least some stars. but the directiosn were not clear and i also added another 1/3 c of agave syrup. good thing my family likes their bread doughy! but i wont make this one next. my advice is to add wheat gluten with the 1st batch of flour and reduce the 5c to maybe 3 and then to add xtra sweetness.

I made this a couple of days ago and guess what?  There's none left.  That's the best compliment to my cooking I could have!  I used white wheat flour and the loaves came out very light (looking and tasting) but was definitely wheat bread!  Very, very good!

I just made this and I can't stop cutting another slice. I don't get it. It's incredibly soft and fluffy and amazing. WE HAVE A WINNER! My bf agrees it's probably one of the best bread recipes I've made. I skipped the veg oil and used EVOO instead. I can't wait to try this again to see if I just got lucky, or if it's really a stand-out recipe! Can't wait to eat it with my Tomato Dill Soup tomorrow for lunch!!  **Notes: I didn't knead it long in my KA mixer, as it was too heavy and dense, so I kneaded by hand for another 5-8 minutes. I was surprised at how quickly it rose, but likely due to all the other baking/cooking going on. Sliced beautifully!

The first time I tried to make these, they didn't rise at all! But that was probably due to the water being too hot & killing the yeast. So I tried it again, using an extra baby thermometer to check the water (it was around 105 degrees), and the dough rose like a champ! Actually, I think I could have even cut the 2nd rise by 10 minutes from 45 to 35, since the tops of the dough seemed to be overflowing from the edges of my loaf pans.

Overall, a very easy recipe to follow with common ingredients. Just watch your water temp. Only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because of the very minor modifications I made: 1) I waited 10 minutes before adding the honey to the yeast & water. 2) I did the 1st rise in a closed oven with a pan of just-boiled water on the bottom rack. I left the pan in the oven to use for the 2nd rise.

Otherwise, the taste and texture of the bread was lovely. The sweetness was noticeable, but still subtle. It's great when lightly toasted with some butter!

Very good bread recipe.  I made only minor changes.  I doubled the honey (because my family likes a sweet bread).  I used Bread Flour instead of All Purpose.  I did not need 5 cups of the white flour. Though I had 5 cups measured out, I probably only used 4. This bread's flavor is best after completely cooled.  My husband and kids are pretty picky about their breads (since many family members are great at making bread) and they were very complimentary of this recipe.

Great recipe.  Wheat bread, but not super whole wheaty.  I'm new to making bread and have made this twice with great results. I use my kitchenaid mixer to get the dough started (though it leaves probably 1/2 cup worth of flour that won't mix in).  I then finish kneading by hand for about 10 minutes.  My family loves it.  Makes great toast.

Another cold, rainy/snowy day!  Decided today was a homemade bread kind of day.
Found this recipe and thought, what the heck, I'll give it a try.  I increased the honey by 50% and added a cup of rolled oats in lieu of some of the white flour.
This bread recipe is absolutely delicious!  The bread has a wonderfully moist texture and crumb.
It's light and not the traditional "heavy" type of wheat bread, but packed with flavor.
Definitely a keeper!

I love this bread! Simply delicious. The only problem was the it took forever to rise (hence the 4 stars instead of 5); however, I stuck it in the oven at 225 degree F and it finally decided to start rising. Other than it is perfect. The bread is delicious and addictive. I just want more. I also love that it does not use shortening or lard. It was delicious. I highly HIGHLY recommend this recipe. Esp. to beginners. It is delicious.

Fabulous and easy.  I followed the directions exactly as written, except substituted bread flour for all purpose.  PERFECT.  The recipe directions clearly state "work flour in gradually."  I did not need all 5 cups so when I added gradually, I had about 1/2 cup left over.  Dough was smooth and elastic, not sticky.  My loaves took 25 min. to bake to a golden crust.  Absolutely delicious even without butter.   Will definitely make this recipe again.  Enjoy!

I made this for a Thanksgiving get-together with friends. This bread came out absolutely amazing! I doubled the honey, changed the vegetable oil to extra-virgin olive oil, and used 100% unbleached whole wheat flour instead of the all-purpose and whole wheat mix. Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. I can't wait to get a bread machine so I can make this every week!

I'm really indecisive so when I read all the suggestions in the reviews I didn't know which one to pick! So I ended up baking the bread exactly as it was on the recipe and it turned out wonderful. I like it so much I can eat this bread plain! The honey gives it a very subtle sweetness which is great. The only problem I had was incorporating all 5 cups of all-purpose flour into the dough. I stopped at 4 1/2 cups because the dough didn't seem to be "absorbing" any more flour. For those who ended up with a stiff dough, I think it's probably because they grew impatient and started added lots of flour instead of doing it gradually. The total bake time for my two loaves was 25 minutes.

Awesome - this has some real flavor, and rises really well! This is the bread I have been looking for with all the recipes I have tried! Do not add extra honey it is great the way it is unless you want a desert bread. If you want a more nutty/robust flavor go with 2 cups wheat, 1 cup flax, and 3.5 cups of all-purpose.

This was really good and quite simple to make. I don't have a bread maker, so this was a nice opportunity for me (and my family) LOL. My photo came out very yellow and did not do justice for how the bread actually looked. We are not big bread eaters, so I will not be making this very often, but I am very glad that I did. I gave alot away, but I must say that I was impressed by how long it stayed fresh tasting. I did not want to refrigerate it since we don't like our bread that way. I put the remainder in my covered cake platter and it stayed pretty nice. Thank you for posting this terrific recipe!

This bread was easy to make in my kitchenaid mixer.  It seemed a little stiff but I just let it run with the dough hook for about 15-20 minutes and it turned out well.  I prepared the recipe as written, but might add a little more honey next time as other reviewers suggested, but it's good as it is. The texture was GREAT!  I had to let it rise an additional 20 minutes in the first rise and the second rise took about an hour.  I sent a loaf over to the neighbors and they loved it too!

This bread is wonderful! My first time making bread, so I followed the recipe exactly. Turned out beautifully! If I feel adventurous next time I make it, I might add a bit more honey, but truly this bread is excellent just the way it is.

Oh man, this is good.  It's the first real bread I've ever made without using a bread machine; I just use my upright mixer to mix everything and knead the dough.  Only one problem -- it never lasts for more than a couple of days, because everyone gobbles it right up!

I thought this bread was very good overall. It has a nice flavor and is simple to put together. I do feel like it's missing something though. I just recently tweaked it a bit, I increased the honey to 1/2 cup and replaced the oil with unsalted butter. It came out fabulous with a softer crust.

This recipe incredible. First started making this 5 or 6 years ago and then stopped making homemade bread. Once I got married I found myself pulling out this old well worn recipe and family loves it! Since I originally did this, I substitute the all purpose flour with bread flour and use extra virgin olive oil in place of vegetable oil. The difference in the rise is phenomenal! I give loaves to friends and family and they love to toast it and add butter and honey as toppings. Between this one and others found at this site, I don't buy bread in the store anymore.

This will be my new go-to wheat bread recipe. It's a very simple recipe with no milk or eggs. It's a light fluffy loaf rather than a heavy dense loaf. Perfect for sandwiches. I had to change the recipe to fit what I had on hand. The only changes I made was using 3 C King Arthur White Whole Wheat Flour, 3 C Bread Flour (I didn't need the whole 7 C of flour), and added 3 TB Vital Wheat Gluten to get a wonderful rise. This bread is fabulous! I love that it’s low sodium!

The first time I made this I didn't like it much, until I realized that my wheat flour was old.  I made it again and it was MUCH better.  Always make sure that your wheat flour hasn't been sitting in the cupboard too long!

Great recipe.  It took me three tries to get it right.  The first time I used expired yeast (remember to check that date) and it didn't rise too well.  The second time I let it rise too much and it wound up collapsing.  I still ate it but thought it should be just a bit sweeter.  The third time I used 1/2 cup of honey, exchanged one cup of white flour with an additional cup of wheat flour.  I only let it rise the second time for two hours.  The bread was perfect. It has to be just about the best tasting bread I can remember eating.    I'm gonna try making dinner rolls with this recipe. I may also experiment with adding cranberries or some other fruit.  Toasting a slice of this in the morning with a little butter sounds delicious.

A winner! I am thrilled to find something I can replace for buying bread at the store every week. It can be tough to find a good bread recipe that doesn't require a machine. I used bread flour for this, and followed it otherwise to a t. I will be making this recipe on a regular basis.

PHENOMENAL!  The dough will be quite stiff at first - don't worry.  It still makes the softest, fluffiest sandwich loaf.  Really delicious!

The portions are completely off. I started off kneading this bread by hand. It was nearly impossible. It made a pretty lame, flat loaf of bread. The reviews make no sense. I make several loafs of bread per week and this was the worst.

This was a great recipe, I doubled the honey as suggested in an earlier review and it was an absolute hit.  A definite 'pass-it-on' kind of recipe.

This bread is very dense but good. After reading the previous reviews, I doubled the honey and added another 1/2 teaspoon of salt. I also used bread flour instead of all-purpose flour because that is what I had on hand. I also mixed and kneaded this by hand so it was a lot of work but well worth it.

This bread was my favorite so far.  My kids and husband loved it too.  I used only fresh ground whole wheat (no other flour)and it came out light and fluffy.  It was great for sandwiches.

I've only made homemade bread a few times and I didn't know which suggestions to follow so I followed this recipe exactly as written and my bread came out perfect. My husband said it was the best he's had and almost ate the entire loaf in one sitting. I mixed and kneaded it by hand which was probably more work, but the end result was worth it. Thanks for the recipe!!!

This recipe really didn't work for me. It took forever to rise, was very hard to work with, didn;t bake all the way through and very bland in flavor. At first, i thought I might have done something wrong because all the other reviews were so great. So i tried making the bread again and i had the same problems. Sorry, but I don't think i'll be making this again.

This is a good plain tasting bread.  It makes great toast!  I used rapid rise yeast and added it to the other ingredients in the mixing bowl.  I heated the water and oil to 120-130 degrees before adding to the other ingredients.  After mixing and the dough pulling away from bowl, I let it rest for 10 minutes on a flat, floured surface.  I shaped it into 2 loaves and placed in loaf pans.  I let it rise until it was an inch or so above the edge of the pan and then followed the baking directions.  I had two nice loaves of bread.  Thanks for the recipe!

Everyone was right - this is a great bread!  In the past I've had problems with the dough being too chewy and dense inside.  Not a problem with this recipe.  I halved the recipe because I wanted to use the dough setting on my bread maker and bake in the oven.  In doing so I left the amount of honey called for the same as we like a sweeter bread.  The only thing I did not like was the top of the bread browned to a dark, deep color.  I think this may have been due to the large amount of honey in it and not intended as the original recipe was written.

This is a VERY good bread recipe that works equally well sliced thin for sandwiches or sliced thick and buttered right out of the oven. If you prefer your honey wheat bread to be really sweet, go ahead and use twice the honey, but if you prefer a lovely, subtle bread just leave it alone.  I've made this several times and it always comes out perfectly.

Fantastic! Great workout for my arms too! Wow! Made the first two loaves without any problems, adjusted rising times due to the colder weather and gave one loaf to my neighbor. We both loved it! Making two more loaves right now! The flavor, texture, easy directions...wow!

Does need NEARLY as much flour as the recipe says! I only used about half the amount of AP flour.

I use a cup of almond flour and coconut oil for amendments after making the recipe about 20 times.  Original or with the tweaks, it's an awesome recipe!

After reading the reviews before making it, I too doubled the amt of honey, and I also swapped one of the cups of white flour for the wheat. I'm a newbie to kneading so I literally was kneading for 45 minutes with pauses to google "how to tell when it's done kneading" and "how to knead dough" since it was taking forever. ;) But somehow, this turned out really well. It tastes great,  and my kids loved it - my 5 yr old just keeps asking for more bread.  The cooking time was spot on and I pulled it out right between 25 and 30 minutes.  I'm looking forward to trying one of the suggestions of putting a handful of oats in it some time.  I'll be making this again.

At one time I baked quite a bit of bread, but circumstances made it more trouble than it was worth for a few years. I recently rededicated myself to bread making and this is the first recipe I tried. My yeast was almost 5 years old, but I proofed it and it seemed workable. I made only a couple of small changes, using 3 cups of WW flour and about 4 cups of AP, and I used about one half cup of honey. I put it in a warm oven to rise and it took over two hours to double in bulk. Was it the old yeast or the extra WW flour, I don't know. The second rise was also slow, over an hour. I baked the loaves about 30 minutes and they turned out beautifully and oh, so tasty. BTW, my KA mixer handled the kneading with no problem, about 7 minutes on speed 2. For my first bread effort in years, I couldn't be happier. Next time, I will make some small changes to personalize the bread, but this is an excellent basic recipe.

I read all the reviews and decided to go with the recipe as written. It is very heavy and dense. I think I will try again and alter it with some of the reviewers suggestions next time.

I tried this bread twice today and the first was a utter failure. 7 cups of flour was waaay to much. The second try, I opted for 3 cups of wheat flour and 4 cups of all purpose flour. I also used 1/2c of honey. After letting it rise the first time and splitting the dough, I noticed that it took way more time to rise than the first rise. I only gave it 3 stars because it took almost 4 hours to complete. I haven't tasted it yet, but this was my very first attempt at a yeast yielding bread. I have been making banana and banana nut bread which is quite easy.

My husband and I decided to make this together.  About the only thing we did correctly according to the recipe was the temp of the water.  Seriously.  I was reading the recipe and, like most men, he refused to listen to me.  We halved everything except the honey which I wish we would have added even more. It was the first bread we've ever made and it was pretty darn good.

Are you kidding me!?!  This is the best bread I have ever eaten.  Honestly, it doesn't matter what kind of sandwich I make, it's a 1000 times better than before.  I pretty much followed the recipe as written, with the exception of adding one packet of Maple and Brown Sugar Oatmeal, as one other review suggested.  I used to buy rolls from a local bakery to use for sandwiches...not any more!  To make sure my 1st loaves were done, I checked their internal temperature.  When they reached 190 degrees I pulled them out of the oven.  They were perfect.  This is now my go-to recipe for daily bread and I can't wait to experiment with different flavors of oatmeal.  Yummmmmy!!!

This recipe did not turn out as it should have. Very bland, not fluffy at all. Will use for French toast so as not to waste it. Very disappointed.

Tasted pretty good but it took A LOT longer than 45 min to rise...not to mention the additional time it took to rise in the loaf pans.  Would have given a higher rating if the recipe was clear about how long the whole process takes.

Easy. Came out great. Although next time I will be adding more honey and maybe a bit more salt. It's got a great texture, heavy duty enough for sandwich bread without being a chore to chew.

This is yummy! I did make some changes by adding 1 t wheat gluten and adding 4 C wheat flour and 2 1/2 c white flour. We had this bread with our BLT's tonight. A tip I learned on you tube is to not knead the bread with more flour it makes it more crumbly. I lightly oiled the countertop and hands and had no issues of sticking. Thanks for sharing:)

Made this yesterday evening, let cool overnight with the intent of tasting this morning.  Everything went swimmingly and the bread looked great, but it is more tasteless than Wonder Bread.  Very disappointing.

In a word: Amazing! The loaves were coming out of the oven just as my husband was coming in the door.  The aroma brought the teenager out of her cave.  3/4 of the first loaf is gone.  I typical freeze the second loaf but this bread doesn't stand a chance!  If my husband, the non bread eater, who especially dislikes anything healthy, asks for second and thirds, the recipe is a keeper!

For the Kitchen Aide users: I used stir to mix in the (1/2 cup) honey and oil. Speed 2 for the rest of the mixing/ kneading. Start to finish was approximately 8 minutes.  Of course I didn't put 5 cups of white flour in it.  The KA instructions specifically limit the amount you can safely use.  So...I ended up with somewhere around 4 cups. The dough was half on, half off the dough hook.  KA instructions for wheat bread advises that this is common and to look for a certain stickiness or tackiness.  

I baked it for 30 minutes.  Brushed the tops with butter and let it sit in the glass pans for approximately 2 minutes before I released them to the cooling racks.

The bread has a wonderful texture and crumb consistency.  Thumbs up!

Glad I found this-better by far than other recipe I tried. Great texture & flavor. I now measure by weight not volume. Much better result! The 1st time I almost burned up my Kitchen Aid, now it's perfect. I still do some hand kneading to finish. I use white whole wheat flour, in place of regular whole wheat & extra honey. My husband loves it! Thank you for this great recipe!

This bread rises so well! I'm used to having some loaves turn out better than others, but I've made this four times now, and every single time it has risen beautifully with no problems at all. I do use a damp cloth and put it in a warm oven, but I do that with almost all my bread and don't have the same consistency. I did make on minor change: extra virgin olive oil instead of vegetable oil, which was a matter of personal taste.

I have been making this recipe for 3 months! I make at least once or twice a week.  Everyone loves this bread! I no longer buy store bread. I have 3 sons 10,13,and 20 and they all love it! My husband has to have a loaf occasionally for work because everyone is jealous of his sandwiches on homemade bread! 
I have made this recipe just as written, I have left out the wheat flour, I have made it adding old fashioned oats; it all turns out great. I have used a bead machine, a regular mixer to start then finished kneading by hand, and I have used my Kitchen Aid; any way you do it it turns out delicious! 
This is really a delicious and versatile recipe! Thanks for posting it!

My favorite bread recipe~!  I have been baking bread for 30 years and this is the best!!!!  I increase whole wheat a little and add one half cup of cracked wheat....by far foolproof and stays moist!   You won't be disappointed...just follow the simple directions! It is delicious!

very delicious. I didnt add nearly as much honey as it called for which was probably a mistake, as I couldnt get all of the last cup of flower in. Honey is expensive in the ..dare i say it.."honey bear". I can't find it any where else right now. Easy to make. I cut the two loaves and before the second could rise I put it in freezer safely wrapped up, I'll take it out and let it defrost and proof before baking. I love that this makes "normal" loaves and not "dinner/petite" loaves.

This is the first yeast bread I have made in years and my family was very happy with the results!  I used Rapid Rise yeast, so mixed the yeast with the flour, then heated the water, added the honey, then added to the flour mixture.  Next time I think I will double the honey and omit the oil.  The honey taste was a little faint for me.  I think I could have also used a tad bit more flour to make a little less doughy, but that is one of the tricks to making a good yeast bread that comes from experience.

The best bread that I've made in a long time! I made half of the recipe, 2 cups wheat flour, and half cup of all purpose flour, and put it in the bread machine.

This is the BEST honey wheat bread I have ever had.  I did up the honey to 1/2 cup as per the other reviews and I only used around 4 and a 1/2 cups of all purpose flour but other than that I followed the recipe.  My kids even loved it and they have both always hated any kind of wheat bread.  Thanks for sharing this delicious bread recipe Meghan!

Used semolina instead of whole wheat flour (to use up what I had in the house), and it mixed up well in combination with a yeast meant for denser breads.

I loved the texture of this bread.  It was light and moist.  It was also easy to make and I appreciated simple ingredients.  I only gave it a 3, though, because it lacks flavor.  It was great as toast with butter, but by itself, not my favorite.  I made it twice and that will be it for me.

Easy to make = 3 smaller loaves because it was easier to knead one third of dough at a time.  My second attempt at bread, first attempt was forgettable - Baked wonderfully in less time, 27 minutes, so good I probably wont share!

This worked great when I halved the recipe but when I made it as it (2 loaves), they didn't rise hardly at all.  I doubled the honey per other reviews and wonder if this was the problem.  I also doubled it in the single loaf and it turned out fine.  The water temp was 110 so that shouldn't have been the problem.  I tried it a second time with two loaves and it did the same thing.  I'm going to make it again this morning but will only halve it again since it was successful, at least the first time.  Ok, I made one loaf (1/2 recipes) and had to wait forever for it to rise.  After 25 min. in 375 oven it was doughy in the center.  Then I made full recipe today.  It fell again while baking! This recipe is so unpredictable.  Maybe it's better without doubling the honey but I think I'll find a different recipe that is more dependable.

This bread got such great reviews, I was very excited and optimistic. It was not great though. It was so very bland. It tastes like nothing. I'm disappointed. I followed the directions exactly. It rose nicely and baked in the time allowed. It just doesn't taste very good.

We let the dough rise once and used it as pizza dough.  It makes the best pizza crust we have ever had!  12 serving recipe makes 2 pizza crusts.  We will never make a different pizza crust again!

This is a really good wheat bread.  I added extra honey which made it sweeter, but also made it not as good for sandwiches.  My whole family loved it.

I loved the taste of this bread and how extremely easy it was to make. I used a bread machine to make the dough, and a very powerful local, raw wildflower honey. I burnt my first batch of buns, but my loaf came out fantastic.  I used milk to brush the tops. Thanks for this awesome recipe that is now a staple in my home.

We loved this bread! I put a 1/2 cup honey like someone suggested and it was great. But if you are going to use for meat sandwiches or garlic bread...I suggest sticking with less honet. STILL GREAT!

I'm horrible at making bread but this was easy and the bread turned out great. Instead of making a loaf of bread I made dinner rolls.

Great in my bread machine, but cut the recipe in 1/2.  Also, I took it out of the machine with 14 minutes left b/c it looked to be done already.  It's also great b/c it's milk free!!

I made this 2 weeks' ago but forgot to rate it. I also increased honey to 1/2 cup and increased salt to 1 1/2 tsp as per comments by others. Being a 1st timer in bread making, I somehow ended up in using more than 5 cups of flour to knead dough in order that it no longer sticks. Despite my inexperience, bread still came out nice and yummy, though not as fluffy as I had used more flour than called for when kneading the dough. Good simple and healthy recipe!

This came out amazing!  I also substituted a cup of wheat flour for one cup of the white and it came out with the great bread texture.  I used 1/4 c honey and 1/4 c agave nectar and it still was perfect. I am making it again this morning!

Perfect sandwich bread. Like others, I doubled the honey and the flavor in the finished product was still mild. I also used an egg wash to get a more golden crust. When I needed croutons I cubed some of this bread and it worked perfectly and had a great flavor.

This. Bread. Is. Great. I am a homeschooled high school student, so I have a very busy schedule. I bake this bread in the morning, and let it rise until noon--it works out great and lets me get some school done. I added about 1/2 cup more honey than the recipe said, since it tasted too "wheaty" to my elementary school aged siblings. I also added 2 teaspoons of salt to slow the yeast down and make the bread rise slower so I could do other things. My family loves it fresh out of the oven for deli sandwiches!

Very good wheat bread recipe.  I halved the recipe and changed only the amounts of each flour.  1/12 cups wheat and 2 cups white.  I think I will add more honey next time as it really didn't have much of a flavor, it had a fresh taste though.  Thanks for the recipe.

It was very dry and crumbly. Even when I made it the second time around instead of kneading the dough with my hands I did it in the bread machine and it still came out bad. I don't know if I did any thing wrong, but I do know that I won't be making this bread ever again. It needs something to hold it together better.

YUM!! For other hard-core bread-bakers, these are large loaves - use your big pans because they bust out of medium ones. And good luck having any left by the time they cool!

This was my first EVER time making bread and I used this recipe.  It was so simple and I really enjoyed making it!  The bread came out perfectly and tasted SO GOOD, I was thrilled.  It took a lot more flour than I expected, that's for sure... ;)

I made this the other day for the first time. I did as so many reviewers suggested and used 1/2 cup of Honey and 1 cup or Whole Wheat Flour and about 3.5 cups of All-Purpose in the second flour addition.   My first rise was beautiful, and while my second rise never got anywhere near the top of the pan, it still tasted wonderful. I hope that next time I'll have better luck with the rising (it was cold in my house, boo) but even though its a bit "heavy" it still makes a great piece of toast. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a very easy bread for anyone to make.  I did increase the honey to 1/2 cup as others had suggested as well as added 1/2 t salt to recipe.  The bread tasted great with butter and applebutter but is a touch too sweet for sandwich bread.  When I make this again I will try the recipe as it is written.

I was worried because last time I made bread the outer part was tough and hard but this wasn't.  It was perfect and delicious.  I'm so happy this turned out right.  I froze one loaf since we probably won't be able to get to it before it goes bad.  Thanks for the great recipe!

It has been a long time since I've baked a loaf of bread. I started to make it, and realized I only had 1/6 c of honey! I added 1/4 c of artificial brown sugar as well as the honey. I baked it as directed in my GE Advantium 120 microwave/oven on the oven setting. The top got a little too brown and tiny bits of the bread wasn't done inside. I baked the second loaf at 360 degrees and got better results. Oven temps vary. Hubby ate 1/2 loaf the first day!

Very good!  I halved the recipe to make one loaf and adapted to my bread machine by putting the water, honey and oil in first, then the flours and salt, and yeast last.  Ran it on the dough cycle and let it rise in a loaf pan.  Brushed the top with melted butter for a tender, brown crust.  Nice flavor and texture!

This is my first attempt at baking in many years, so I followed the recipe exactly, except I used bread flour instead of a/p flour.  I also weighed my ingredients (metric) instead of using the cup measurements.  This bread is great - chewy and light, with a hint of sweetness.  Great recipe!

As suggested by others I doubled the honey which gave the bread a wonderful sweet flavor.  However, I would not double the honey if you plan on using the bread for sandwiches, etc.  It's a great breakfast/snack bread.  One reviewer complained that this bread was yeasty and I have to agree; this didn't bother me but it might bother others.

I reduced the amount of all-purpose flour to 3 cups and it came out very light, not dense at all.  Everyone in the house ate it up.  Yummy!

I tried it twice following the recipe and both times it was too dense and floury tasting. Requires longer cooking time than stated. Won't try again.

I made this recipe using the exact above instructions, except I added an additional 1/3 of a cup of honey due to other people's comments.  It turned out very well.  The bread is very soft and chewey and wholesome.  This is a denser bread not for those who like wonderbread style bread.  It did take a while for it to raise though.  This could have been my problem using old yeast.  I would recommned adding a little bit more salt as well.  Overall a very good wheat bread.

The bread is very easy to make and the texture is wonderful. However, the taste is bland. I was excited to make this since it got such rave reviews, but I'm a little disappointed. I now have 2 loaves of bland bread. I guess I'll make a bread pudding or something with it. On a positive note, I think it's a wonderful "base" recipe to add flavorings too.

EXCELLENT!!!  I doubled the honey, messed around with the wheat to white ratio, kneaded it for another minute after punching it down, let it rise MUCH longer than the recipe says... it was all wonderful.
The one in the loaf pan is still in the oven, but I made a couple smaller loaves on my stone and they are great!!!  Fantastic texture!

Would rate 6* if possible.  Makes wonderful toast.  Followed advice of others and increased honey to 1/2 cup. Did note dough quite sticky after kneading, but no real problem.

This is definately my favorite bread at allrecipes. I tried the other more reviewed and rated breads with 5 stars, but find that this one has a great taste and is excellent for sandwich bread, which is what I was looking for.  I added 1/4 cup of sugar to the recipe however, and it turned out lovely.  My husband also says what a great flavor it has, plus it's light and fluffy.  Thank you for the recipe!

This recipe turned out perfectly!  I used the dough cycle on my bread machine to mix the dough (make sure your bread machine is big enough to handle the two loaves).  I also added more honey.  Then I shaped, let rise and baked the loaves as stated in the recipe.  Excellent!

5 Stars here.  This bread is ***Perfection***.  It is the only wheat bread I now bake and I've used this bread as the base for experimenting with different breads of my own.

This bread  was wonderful to eat and wonderful to make.  I made it with my 2 year old daughter and had a ball.  We've made it many times and it has always turned out beautiful.

I first made this bread 5 years ago. Keeping the recipe as it is, it turns out every time. I find it heartier than store bought — after all, isn’t that why homemade bread is so good?

I have made bread before, which had turned out beautifully and made lovely loaves. But I was not quite satisfied with the taste so I thought I’d try a different but similar recipe. 
Being a novice bread maker it did not occur to me to check the measurements on this recipe so I simple started throwing ingredients together. Which is when I realized something was terribly wrong. I checked the recipe and my measurements and all was spot on. But there is waaayyyy too much flour for this recipe. I do not know how people were able to add the full 5 cups of flour unless they didn’t and just went by feel instead. Which isn’t very good help for novices like myself.  
So wish me luck that I can somehow make this dough into some reasonable bread.

Finally, a simple wheat recipe that doesn't require so many additional steps! I did want something a little healthier so per one of the reviews I did use 5 cups of whole wheat, plus a cup or 2 of all purpose just until it wasn't sticking to the sides of the bowl. And per alot of the reviews I did up the honey to 2/3 cup and also upped the salt to 1 1/2 tsp. It only took 30 min at 375 in my oven and it was definitely done.  I do wish the directions explained to use UP to 5 cups of white flour - do not pour it in all at once, and then u won't need to add more water like one of the reviews said. Start with the 5 cups wheat and about 1 cup white, mix for 2 min, and then add about 1/2 cup of flour until dough is pulling away clean from sides of bowl (mixing for about 8-10 min total), and then whatever is needed to shape into dough ball. That being said, I was looking for a recipe that allowed me to use more wheat than white flour and this is def it! Thank you!

Please, PLEASE update the original recipe to include the proper amount of water!!!! I should have read the worst reviews first and added more than a few extra tablespoons of water. Now my very expensive KitchenAid mixer is smoking and I think it's broken and the bread didn't turn out well after all. I'm so mad/sad/disappointed!

I've tried a lot of bread recipes and this is by far the best. Small tip, I did measure out two cups of the whole wheat flour but for the all purpose flour I went by weight. I used 22 ounces instead of 5 cups and used a kitchen scale. Also, based on other reviews I did add extra honey. I used 1/2 cup. With those tweaks it was perfect.

Love this recipe, I can change it and do basically anything I want with it! I added oats and made a honey oat bread, then cinnamon and raisins, and the original is pretty good as Well! I used white bread flour to make this

After reading the reviews, I increased the honey to 1/2 c, 1 tbsp (3 tsp) yeast and 1 & 1/2 tsp salt
I used 2 c of bread flour (because I forgot) and 3 c of all purpose flour. 
This was an easy to follow and easy to make recipe. It  smelled AMAZING while baking and turned out INCREDIBLE. I WILL be making it again. I will make it at the recommended 1/3 c honey. 1/2 c was a bit sweeter than I wanted for an everyday bread but it still tasted great when I made a hot ham and swiss!! 
Thanks for the great share!!! This will definitely be a staple in my home!! ??

This is an absolutely delicious recipe! My family gobbled the bread in a day or two and we couldn't even wait until it was cooled, hah! The only downside: the time it takes for the dough to rise. It's my fault for being so impatient, but it's definitely worth it in the end.

Simple recipe and everyone who tried the bread loved it! Like other reviewers, I increased the honey amount to half a cup. The bread tasted great and toasted very well for making BLT's.

The only complaint I have for this recipe is that the proportions are pretty far off. This has seven cups of the flours and olny 2 and 2 thirds cups of liquids. Way too dry. I suggest adjusting the liquids and adding flours slowly while mixing. Once you get that figured out it's a great bread.

Good stuff.  I used raw dark honey at the prescribed measurement and it was fantastic!  I only used that because I had less store-bought honey than I thought and asked the neighbors if they had any.  :P

The only thing I add is:  right after taking them out of the oven I take a cold stick of butter and rub it over the top of each.  This step helps keep the top crust soft and adds a little richness to it.

I really got irritated when I bought a loaf of bread from the supermarket and it didn't mold after three weeks in my cupboard.  So I decided to tackle my fear of baking bread and give this one a try.  I read all the reviews and increased the honey to 1/2 cup, increased the salt to 1.5 tsp and substituted salted butter for the oil.  I used white whole wheat flour (2 cups), unbleached bread flour (2 cups) and all-purpose flour (3 cups).  I used my Kitchen Aid and was able to incorporate all the flour.  I kneaded the dough only a little, and that was probably a mistake, and based on other reviews, I didn't bake it the full 30 minutes, which was also a mistake as one of my loaves was a bit doughy.  The other loaf, after a little longer in the oven however, was perfect and delicious!  This will become our new normal.  Thanks for posting!

This is a tasty and easy bread to make!  I followed the recipe and it is truly delicious - rave reviews from friends and family, too.  The thought of making bread used to intimidate me but it's not nearly as hard as I thought. Nothing I've bought in a store comes close to this I made at home!  Several reviewers suggested more honey than the 1/3 cup but I found it plenty satisfying as written.

I used 1/2 c. Of honey. Not too sure how much white flour I used. I added one cup at a time until the dough was elastic as I was kneading. Super yummy, will be making again

Stick to 25 mins, I had a larger bread mould, so I put the rest of the dough as little buns, worked out ok.

First bread I've ever made. It turned out great. I used 4 cups of white flour instead of 5 , a little bit less than a half a cup of honey and little less than 2 teaspoons of salt and I used my Kitchenaid  to do the rest. My dough was rising in the  oven with open oven door at 175 F  for about hour and a half and then I let it rise in the loaf pans in the oven for another 40 minutes. Baked at 375 for 25 min. I love the taste (does not taste like flour), consistency and pretty much everything about this bread. The cool thing about it is that I was able to use organic flour and make it as healthy as it gets for my family.  I had almost half a loaf by my self, I had to try a sandwich with lunch meat and pb&j, my dogs loved it with pb. Awesome recipe.

This is going to be my goto sandwich/toast/everyday bread recipe. I love it and can't wait to play with it a bit to see what cool variations it'll yield! Infinitely softer and more flavorful than any wheat bread recipe I've tried thus far.

Excellent Bread!  I changed a few things: only added 3 cups all-purpose flour and added 3 cups whole wheat flour, and added a little extra honey.

Fantastic!  I used more honey as suggested and replaced a cup of white flour with wheat. So good!! I will bake again with maybe some oats on top.

I have baked this bread twice now and have been disappointed each time. Two years ago I baked this bread and it was awesome! Last week and again today I baked this bread and it was just ok. Edible, but lacking that wow factor that it seemed to have before. Maybe you guys can help me, what am I doing wrong? My bread never seems fluffy enough, and it usually cracks on the edge during baking. It doesn't taste much of honey, either.

Turns out very good - a family favorite!  Only thing I did different was to add 2 Thse vital wheat gluten,  which made the bread rise better and kept a nice texture to the loaf. I've made it twice now, same great results.

I make this bread often for my family. We love it. It's so simple to make, is economical and the dough is so easy to work with, I do cut the recipe in half because there's no way we'd be able to eat 2 loaves of bread before they go bad. I use one packet of yeast and use a 1/2 cup of honey. The best part is that it calls for no eggs, milk or butter so it's truly economical for those looking for an affordable bread recipe. The bread comes out so soft and sweet. This is one of my favorite bread recipes on AR.

Success! I had no problems making this recipe, and I have a tough time getting even pizza dough to rise! Needless to say, I was going in with lower expectations.  Dough doubled nicely, and I took the suggestion of the baker who used the microwave and a bowl of hot water as a proofing box of sorts.  Baked for 30 minutes, and the result was a light, soft loaf with good crumb.  I also doubled the honey, then added 3 TB of granulated sugar for good measure because I prefer a sweeter bread.  Will make this again.

I cut the entire recipe, except honey, in half as I only wanted one loaf.  I also only used all purpose flour, no wheat flour.  I also put honey down the center of the loaf directly before baking it.  I ran it down with a knife to bake into the top of the bread, giving it a dimple down the middle.  I think the bread came out nice, but it took forever to rise.  I put the oven on to 170 and let it cool down for a few minutes,then put the bread in there for an hour with a damp cloth over it to rise.  I had to do that both times and it never did rise as much as desired. I only gave it three stars mostly because even half the recipe took about 4-5 hours to get a loaf of bread, not the two stated.  We ended up going to the store to buy bread for dinner and this finish when we were ready to go to bed.  If you make the entire recipe, I'd double the honey.

honestly maybe it was just me but this bread didnt turn out all that great. it crumbles easily and kept falling apart. i thought it was just me. this was my 3rd time making this particular recipe and it was the same every time. ive never had a problem with any other bread i made before so i guess it just wasnt meant to me.

I was so proud of myself when I made this. It was very easy to make and was so excited when it rose beautifully. Glad I doubled the honey. Next time, i would add a little more salt in it. One thing for sure, I won't be buying any more bread from now on :D Thank you for sharing!

I tried this recipe and it seemed as though 2 cups of water is not enough. I was not able to add the full amount of flour. Other than that, this is a good, simple recipe. I will definitely make it again but with more water to begin. This bread had a good flavor and is very simple.

Not the greatest.  Mine barely moved on the 2nd rise (yeast proofed fine) and I kept giving it time to rise until I finally did the "imprint test" and it said it was ready despite looking pretty much the same height as when it went in.  I knew it wouldn't rise much cooking.  It came out with a good consistency, but it was small of course, and pretty bland, though I followed the suggestions of increasing the honey.  I don't know what I was expecting with taste, maybe I'm an artisan bread snob?  I was trying to find a simple wheat bread for my kids to substitute for store-bought.  I guess this would be it, but the issues with rising - I've never had a bread not rise so I'm a bit perplexed. I'll give it another try it again before writing it off.

This has become one of my favorite bread recipes, and I make it all the time! It's easy and delicious, and I don't change anything about it.

I do need much longer rising time than the recipe calls for, and sometimes let the bread rise as long as two hours. Sometimes to speed up the process I turn the oven on its keep warm setting, and set the dough on top of the stove.

I loved the taste, so good and soft and fresh. Except, I must have done something wrong, tought I followed the directions exactly. The first four slices were great. Once i got closer to the middle,it had a big raw patch, with the center itself being totally raw. I dont know what i did wrong, but I was very disapointed because I thought they were perfect, ugh. Not sure how to avoid this.

I'm new to breadmaking. I've tried several recipes this summer and so far this is the only one I've been successful with. It's simple, healthy, & tastes great! The only slight change I made is 3 cups total whole wheat flour and the rest bread flour. Thanks for the great recipe!

I tried this twice- the first time, it didn't rise. Second time it did, and I added a bit more honey as others suggested. I thought it turned out very dense and very bland. Sorry :(

This was really good with the changes that I made. Instead of adding a 1/3 of a cup of honey, I doubled that to 2/3 cup. I also added 1/2 cup of wheat germ. I think that it wouldn't have been so good if I just used 1/3 cup of honey but that is just me.

I have been making this recipe for more than a year.  My family loves it!  I love that it is extremely flexible.  You can easily adjust the wheat to white ration, just don't go over 50/50.  You can also add more honey.  Delicious any way you make it!  Good stuff!  I have also used just a single packet of yeast and it worked fine.

I make it every week now, but I've made the following changes:  2/3 cup honey & instead of 5 cups all purpose flour, at that step I use 4 cups all purpose & one cup whole wheat.  I was very worried the first time I made this because the dough was extremely dry & it took twice as long to rise.  I honestly thought the whole batch was going in the garbage.  But I watched a tutorial on the Stretch & Fold technique.  After the first rise, it was back on track & it was beautiful.  It's been my best bread to date & a dream to slice.  I make this bread every weekend & forbid store bought bread in my house!

I enjoy baking, I have not since my last son, who is now 7. We enjoyed making this recipe, I took advice from reviews. I added more honey and salt. I was able to include all 5 cups of flour. My only problem was when I sliced the bread I had a wet tunnel in the middle all the way through. I will try again, my family really liked the taste and texture of this bread even the wet part(toasted). Oh, I did use Hodgson Mill, Whole Wheat - Graham Flour, but I do not believe that was the issue. Thanks for all the reviews they really help. SB

This was good bread.  Very sweet when the honey was doubled as others recommended.  I would have given it 5 stars had I not tried another honey wheat bread from this site. It was much better.

My husband and kids absolutely loved this bread - nice light texture for a whole wheat bread.  I found it too sweet, certainly too sweet for sandwiches.

This recipe was really easy and tasty. I've never made bread before and this turned out perfect. They only thing I will change next time is to substitute some more of the white flour for whole wheat. It says on the wheat flour bag that you can use substitute half wheat flour for white. So next time instead of 5 white cups, I think I'll do 2.5 of each in addition to the wheat that is already int he recipe.

Fantastic.  I did 1.5 times the honey and it turns out fantastic.  One of the loaves made some of the best sandwich bread have ever eaten; another loaf I added walnuts to and it was superb.  Great recipe!

I made this for my dad after he had surgery and he looooved it.  My husband devoured the other loaf.  My dad couldnt stop talking about how good it was! He ate the whole loaf warmed up and with apple butter.  
Cooking it was easy.  I only had 2 7x3 inch pans so i greased a muffin tin and made about 6 honey wheat muffins....those are yummy too!!

I used less flour than the recipe called for.  I let it rise longer than stated and I added fresh grated orange rind and it turned out wonderfully!  I kneaded by hand and it was work, but definitely worth it.

I got great family reviews from my kids and husband who used this bread for days after Thanksgiving for turkey sandwiches, even the loaf I tried to freeze and save for later. I added another 1/2 c. of honey because we love sweet wheat breads. Thanks!

This was an ok recipe. Mine turned out a bit dry, and tasted a little yeasty. That was probably my fault for not proofing the yeast long enough. The bread had a pretty good overall taste. I didn't have enough honey and i'm sure it would have tasted better with more.

I used only the amount of honey in the recipe and found it just the right amount of sweetness.  It was a bit dense and refused to cook all the way through, but that may be due to my error.  I will try again and see if it is any lighter

Excellent. Simple, quick (minus the rising time, of course) and tastes wonderful. Raves all around from my bunch. I say go for this recipe if you like a chewy, whole-wheat tasting loaf!

This was my first time making bread so maybe I was doing it wrong, but I couldn't get the dough to rise very much. I switched the amount of whole wheat and all-purpose flour around to make it healthier. Maybe that was the problem. It still came out tasting pretty good even though it was denser that I would have liked.

If you follow the recipe as is, this recipe tastes just ok.  As far as ease of prep work and ingredients, it is a great recipe. I will make again, but double the honey like many before me have suggested. Just wanted to try the original first. I needed to butter it to make it taste better and I hate to put butter on a fresh homemade bread.

Yay! First "coolish" day since the winter, so I can make this bread again!! I have made this almost weekly during fall/winter since finding this recipe last summer. I use a teensy bit more honey, just enough that it's a barely sweet bread. It's great just ripped apart into chunks, great as breakfast toast, great for sandwiches...you name it! I also whip up about a stick of softened butter and a few "squirts" of honey to spread on slices :)

Another fab recipe folks!  For my christmas buffet, I used half this recipe to make a boule(bowl) to hold my spinach dip, and with the other half, I made 4 long baguettes for dipping. This bread freezes well in any shape, and is extra tasty with honey butter.  It toasts up well too!  But, you have got to try a grilled cheese on this honey wheat bread! Make and enjoy!

Wow this bread turned out great! I had only one loaf pan so I used a muffin pan as well and they made excellent rolls. I think maybe next time I'll add a little more honey, maybe doubling, for a stronger honey taste. But I will definately keep this recipe!
