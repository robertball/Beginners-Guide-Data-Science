This tasted really good and it was highly complimented at the party I brought it to. It was nice and creamy. The next time I will use the whole packet of onion soup mix (because what am I going to do with the rest of it anyway?) I may add some chopped waterchestnuts to give it a litte more texture.

This recipe was great! My family used it with soft pretzels and I think the two of them combined went extremely well. The only difference I made was adding a full container (15 oz) of cheese whiz 1extra tbsp of sour cream and one package of dry onion soup mix. I also added 1 cup of shredded sharp cheese just to let my family know that this was indeed a cheese dip. The salad dressing(miracle whip) makes this recipe sweet so tweak it to your own taste!!! Happy dipping!!!

There is a lot of processed foods going on in here but it did turn out pretty good. I used mayo instead of miracle whip out of personal preference and ended up adding more of the soup mixture. This would be good with soft pretzels.

It sure was easy. It was very cheesy. I used creamy cheese sauce by Frito Lay instead of cheese whiz and also added just a couple of Tsp. of sugar. Next time want to try some fake meat in it but didn't have any on hand. Great Recipe.
