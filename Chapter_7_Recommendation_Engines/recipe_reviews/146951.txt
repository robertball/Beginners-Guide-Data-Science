This was a dissapointing pie, while eating it all I could think of was how it just tasted like spenda and strawberries......If Im going to go through the effort of making a pie I will use a more traditional recipe next time

This recipe is very user-friendly. The pie is firm and tasty. We were very pleased with the results and will use it often.
