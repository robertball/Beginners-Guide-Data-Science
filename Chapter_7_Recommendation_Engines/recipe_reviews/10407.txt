THIS RECIPE IS AMAZING!  The only bad thing about it was that people didn't believe me when I said that I made them myself.  However, I did change the recipe a little by adding an extra 1/4 cup of sugar.  As a little tip, I recommend that you put the dough in the freezer, instead of the refrigerator.  Also, because the dough is somewhat sticky, I put ALOT of flour on the countertop before trying to roll it out.

I can't review this fairly because I followed one reviewers advice and upped the sugar and butter. The cookies were way too buttery and spread all over the sheet. I definitely would not us 1 and 1/2 cups butter. WAAAAAY too much.

I made these cookies yesterday for my children for a snack at school and they were a big hit. The whole house smelled of sugar and butter while the cookies were baking. One of my daughters teachers even commited to her how good the cookies looked and the smell of the cookies. I did however, follow the advice of some of the reviewers I used 2 1/2 cups of sugar and 1 1/2 cups of real butter. I added cinnamon , instead of the vanalla. Also I put the cookie dough in the frig over night. Floured my board alot, dough was a little sticky. And the dough rolled out great. I kept the oven tem. at the suggested 325, but I cooked the cookies for only 10 min. First 5 min.on the top rack and then 5 min. on the bottom rack. The cookies turned out a light golden color that were crisp on the out side edge and soft on the inside. I made the cookies thicker that what was suggested. I was able to make 36 heart shaped cookies from the dough. This recipe is a keeper.

This one will definately replace my old recipe, but they are not quite Mrs. Fields, I don't think.  They are soft, yet firm enough to handle while decorating, and they really have a nice flavor.  I think this is because this recipe does not call for shortening.  I also think the trick to making these cookies the best they can be is: refridgerate till hard (1 hr 1/2), roll them out quickly, and maintain a 1/4 inch thickness.  I rolled them out on parchment paper and then removed the scraps of dough around the cut outs.  Then I placed my parchment on a baking stone.  Add two minutes to your first batch, if using a stone.

The cookies turned out great; not too sweet, and the perfect soft texture.  I did have a little trouble rolling them out, next time I'll sandwich the dough between wax paper sheets to keep it from sticking.

These cookies were very easy to make and taste great.  I added a sprinkle of cinnamon and nutmeg into the flour mixture for a little extra flavour.  I made the second batch of cookies about twice as thick as recommended and baked them at 350 for 13 minutes and they were nicer than the thinner ones.  This dough is a bit sticky, so a well-floured surface, rolling pin, and cookie cutters is a must!

This is a good recipe. I added an extra 1/4 cup of sugar - the original didn't taste sweet enough to me. Roll them out thick and under-cook them just a bit. Also, they taste alot better with frosting. (But what doesn't)!!

My dough turned out really gooey. I couldn't roll it or anything. I was so disappointed because all the other reviews were so good on this but it turned out terribly.

I loved this recipe!!! It was so easy.  I was looking for an easy sugar cookie recipe to make poodle shaped cookies.  I tried this one and was very pleased.  It kept the cookie cutter shaped and is one of the best sugar cookies I tasted.  I even had a friend who said that she worked in a bakery and these sugar cookies were better than the bakery's.  I decorated mine with colored sugar.

This is my go to sugar cookie recipe, but I made 2 modifications to the recipe that helped a lot.  I rolled the cookies out on a mixture of powder sugar and a bit of flour on the board and rolling pin.  I found if I only roll on flour the cookies become not sweet enough because as you roll the 'scraps' together you accumulate more and more flour.  With a mixture of powder sugar and flour you avoid this.  Also after I cut the cookies with cutters and place them on a cookie sheet, I put the cookie sheet in fridge or freezer for at least 10 minutes.  Otherwise the dough will spread too much in oven and loose it's shape.  If the dough is frozen when it goes into oven the cookies keep their shape perfect.

The trick to this cookie is to plop the gooey batter onto a 13" or so strip of wax paper, lay another over the dough, squish flat a little and roll out. Continue til dough is used. It made 3 sheets for me. and I doubled the recipe. Keep in fridge for 1 hour. Take each sheet out one at a time, cut out cookies while dough is cold. Scraps are rerolled and placed back into the fridge to harden. No need for flour and alot less messâ€¦..Oh yeah, I loved this cookie, very rich and buttery

Ok people, the KEY to this recipe is use REAL BUTTER. Do NOT use margarine! If you use margarine your dough will be sticky and gooey! Real butter will firm up again after you chill the dough in the fridge for an hour. You must chill the dough if you want to cut out your shapes. These cookies taste amazing though, and they are so easy. Just make sure you follow the directions.

Note: The original Mrs. Field's recipe calls for SALTED butter.
I haven't made these myself, but my SIL makes these all the time and they're great!  (So my rating is based on her cookies, haha).  After hearing which recipe she uses, I decided to check out the Mrs. Field's website (being December, she said this was the free recipe of the month).  I happened to notice the recipe also posted here, and the salted butter was the only difference I saw.  I always buy unsalted butter, so that stuck out to me.

The easiest cookies ever! I realized I was out of vanilla 1/2 way into the recipe and substituted a tablespoon or two of fresh lemon juice and upped the sugar to compensate. Also, I can't make cookies without cinnamin so added a pinch. Really yummy!  Used as a base for the Fancy Fruit Pizza on this site. And rolled with sugar, not flour

This was a very good receipe. I did alter the receipe by ADDING 1tsp baking powder, 1tsp pure lemon extract, 1.5c granulated white sugar, and 1/2c unsalted butter. This gives the cookies a soft and fluffy texture with a hint of sweet lemon taste. Frost these cookies with a sweet cream cheese frosting and embellish with colorful sugar crystals. Note: Best to hand mix dough and slowly add additional flour until dough becomes less sticky and easily forms into a ball.

These turned out beautifully. I can't wait to ice them They do not spread and hold shape. Followed directions and dough was a little crumbly. Added a little water worked it in and put back in refrig for another hour or so. Far superior to the more spopular sugar cookie recipe on this site. Thanks for a great cookie. I baked on the baking stones.

Altho I wasn't sure how these would turn out as there was no baking soda or baking powder in them, they are great.  The lady who said the dough was too gooey must have made a mistake and used too much butter.  I only added little more sugar, and they were excellent.  Very crispy, almost like a shortbread.  Dough was fine, I used a generous amt of flour to roll them with, but not an excessive amt.  Would highly recomment them.

I would like to qualify my rating by stating that this recipe is very good for decorative cookies and very detailed cookie cutters. There is nothing to rise these cookies so they keep their shape very nicely. However, these aren't very high in flavor, they are pretty to look at but they lack the soft moist texture.  They would be better if topped with a very flavorful frosting. It just depends on what you're looking for in a cookie, if you need something to keep it's shape, then these are it!

I have to say that this is one of the best sugar cookie recipes I have used!  I don't know why some have not had them turn out but they were awesome, I made no changes only added a little cinnamon and almond extract! Big hit!

this recipe is fantastic. i made it three times, the third time trying the tips offered to increase the butter and sugar and received disastrous results. this recipe is best AS IS. i suggest sifting the flour as it produces a lighter, more even cookie.

kept in the refrigerator for an hr. before i rolled them out. Cookies kept their form well after baked but not a good taste will add more sugar next time. 3/4 didnt even make it taste sugary to me. Kids ate one then didnt touch them again and they love cookies.

Used this recipe for 4 years to make cut out sugar cookies. The flavour is loved by the whole family and they make fine cut outs IF you are patient. Put a portion of the dough in the freezer for up to 5 minutes, roll out to less than the 1/4 inch in the recipe, cut out, decorate, than back in the freezer for 5 minutes before baking for 7 minutes.

Really Great Sugar Cookie recipe!!!!  I froze the dough and then let it come to room temperature. I did use a bit of flour rolling it out but I think that's normal. Also, I baked in my fan oven for only 5 minutes!!!!  I needed a quick sugar cookie recipe this Christmas because I wanted to make them with my daughter but did not want a zillion cookies...I think the service size was perfect for us. Will definitely adopt this as our sugar cookie recipe!

My grandson and I used this recipe for our Christmas cookie decorating tradition.  We used the ingenious idea of using sugar to roll out the cookies.  It added a crisp sugary crust that was amazing!

I made this recipe for the first time last night and they were GREAT! I followed the ingredients as is and the only thing I had a slight issue with was rolling & cutting the dough, it was just a little sticky, but nothing sum exra four did'nt take care of. The next me I make these I will be sure to double the recipe!

There is nothing wrong with this recipe.  It is my first attempt and they are not rock hard or anything.  They are just perfect.  I did add about 1/4 tsp of baking powder that is it.  I baked them exactly for 13 minutes and not a single dark edge.

A great sugar cookie recipe.  Admittedly I don't know what Mrs. Fields cookies taste like, but I loved these...(also I love cookie dough, and this is up there with the best of them!)  I dipped mine in melted dark chocolate after they had cooled and cooled them in the fridge.  They tasted great.  Will probably have a couple of batches to serve with coffee at my wedding.

Great! I used 1 cup of sugar instead of 3/4 and sprinkled red sugar sprinkles (before baking) on some and drizzled white chocolate over the tops of the rest (after baking).

Wonderful, easy recipe!! I followed the directions as stated and came out delicious! 
  For the first batch: I lightly flattened it and came out very soft and fluffy. 
  For the second batch: I flattened it out even more and came with very yummy crunchy cookies.  
**One thing I will recommend is to reduce the salt by about half; you can taste the salt if you follow the recipe amount.  But other than that, easy to make, delicious cookies!  Most definately worth the try!

These are THE WORST sugar cookies ever, and I've made a lot. There is no baking powder in the recipe so they don't fluff up at all. Cooking time is off. Just not good.

I am suprised by all of the reviews saying the dough was sticky, mine was on the dry side, I am wondering if the people with sticky dough used margarine instead of butter? Mine came out perfect, they do not rise much so they do not distort cut tout shapes, I loved them so much they are now my #1 sugar cookie recipe!

I made this recipe when trying to find another sugar cookie recipe for my witches fingers (recipe on this site, too). The only other time I have made homemade cookies, they turned out horrible, so I wasn't expecting too much from this recipe either.  But, to my surprise they turned out really good. Even my kids, who only eat choc. chip cookies, really liked them. As per other reviews, I did add an extra 1/4 C of sugar. And actually, I could have added a little more for my liking. I placed dough in freezer for about 30 minutes and then rolled out some of my dough for the witches fingers. The rest of the dough I just spooned out for regular round cookies. A really good recipe.

Sugar cookies have always been up there in my favorites so when I got the craze to bake something today, I jumped at this recipe. I had to make due because my mom didn't have any cookie cutters. I made little circles like normal cookies, and then when I had a dozen in the pan ready to be cooked, I still had dough left over. So I had the bright idea to braid the dough. I sprinkled sugar and cinnamon on the cookies and braids. I followed everything as the recipe said and they of course turned out fantastic. I'm proud of the creativity of the braided cookies. I recommend getting creative when you have leftover dough. It makes the baking so much more fun!

These cookies were a big hit at home and at work.. I added 3 tbsp of cinnamon and used 1 cup of sugar and hey came out perfect and they taste great when topped with My favorite butter cream icing. My daughter and I found these easy to roll, cut and decorate.. I will be using this recipe again soon.

These are the best.  I cut mine out a little thicker, and let them just get lightly browned. 

Then I use a buttercream frosting to top them off.  They stay soft for a long time!

This recipe was good, but not to Mrs. Field's status.  I think Mrs. Field's cookies are sweeter and full of butter which this recipe was shy on.  I did change up the baking.  Instead of letting cool in the fridge, I just rolled it into balls (very large balls) and put them on the cookie sheet.  I then dipped a glass in sugar and flattened the cookies.  Then I slow baked them at 250 degrees for about 35 minutes.  I read somewhere that Mrs. Fields slow bakes their cookies.  I did flatten them a little to much so they easily crack, but I wanted that giant cookie you always get at the cookie shops. I think I would have gotten that giant soft cookie if I hadn't flattened them quite that much.  If you drizzle them with icing, it adds a nice sweet touch.

These cookies did not taste, look, or smell anything like the cookies from Mrs. Fields.  Dough came out just like dry unsweetened shortbread.  Never got golden, just white.  Not chewy.  A big disappointment.

I think it just all comes down to personal preference.  I don't like sugar cookies and I've never made them before but these were right up my alley.  They were easy to make, not overly sweet although I added 1c of sugar instead of 3/4 and I added 1tsp of baking powder.  They came out fluffy and I loved the taste.  We topped them with chocolate chips after they came out of the oven.  Some with sprinkles (they didn't stick) and some with icing.  I thought they were great and my 8yo thought they were "pretty good."

After trying many recipes for sugar cookies for this holiday season, I would have to say this one was the best! It was a big hit with everyone! My five year old over decorated it and it still wasn't overbearingly sweet. It was just perfect.

The recipe was great except that its missing some baking powder.  I added 1 tsp and had wonderfully soft and not too sweet sugar cookies.  Great for icing because they're not overly sweet.

These are GREAT!  They keep their shape when you bake them so you don't have to worry about the edges burning.  They are very close to a shortbread style cookie.  Absolutely wonderful!!!!

I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and used 2 1/2 cups of sugar, 1 1/2 cups of butter, and cinnamon. I followed the directions exactly, but the cookies didn't rise in the oven. Instead, they just flattened out and lost their shape completely. Maybe the recipe is missing baking soda or something. I will try to make this recipe again, maybe adding about 1 tsp of baking soda.

Yum-O very tasty.  I'm a busy Mom of 2, I made the dough 2 days a head of time in batches and took it out as I needed to make the cookies for a Christmas party.  Very easy!

These cookies were good, tasted like a typical sugar cookie, nothing spectacularly different about them.  I could not cut them out with cookie cutters, even after being refrigerated for hours.  The dough stayed too soft for cutters.  I would recommend rolling the dough into a log shape, refrigerate, cut and roll in sprinkles.  Not a good cut out cookie recipe if you are making shapes for your kids' school. I made these for a wedding; the dough was too soft, even after refrigeration. Could not use my wedding cookie cutters.

I thought these were great for cut out cookies. They were crisp on the edges and soft in the center...with just the right sweetness. Really good cookie. I changed to 1c sugar and 1c butter but also ended up increasing the flour when rolling out...probably by 3/4c. We also had to refridgerate a day before baking which seemed to help.

These cookies turned out great!  I had another sugar cookie recipe that always turned out too crunchy, these were nice and soft, and even softer the next day (stored in tupperware).  The key is to pull them from the oven before they get brown on the edges.  I cooked mine for 15 minutes and then transfered them to a cooling rack right away.  I didn't have a problem with the dough being too sticky, but I was pretty generous with the flour when I rolled it out.

These are the best sugar cookies I've made in a long time. I used 1 cup all purpose flour and 1 cup wheat flour, and added 1/4 cup of sugar. My dough wasn't sticky, just needed a little flour on the working area.

Not sure how they taste in comparison the Mrs. Fields but I did what the other reviews suggested and used a cup of sugar. I also emptied the dough from the bowl onto some saran wrap and rolled it into a roll and tied the ends and put it in the freezer for an hour, but I think I would have been better off putting it in there for an hour and a half because the dough was not all the way firm. I then sliced it up and placed the dough onto the cookie sheet. Use larger slices than you think, too thin and they look like pancakes! Other than that, they taste delicious! the first couple of chews aren't too sweet, it's the after taste and the last couple of chews where the flavor comes out. These are cooked through, but soft, eliminating the half-cooked cookie addiction I used to have!

I followed the recipe to a "T" Not only did they not taste like Mrs. Field's cookies, they were so tacky (after being refrigerated for 2 hours.) I had to add a lot of flour to them just to get the dough to stop from sticking to itself after using cutters. I definitely do not recommend this recipe to anyone. Sry.

I made these cookies with my friends.  Instead of vanilla extract, we used 2 teaspoons of lemon extract.  We also took the more "traditional" route to mixing them and rolled the dough into balls instead of cutting it out with cookie cutters.  The recipe actually took MUCH longer than the stated 14 minutes to bake.  The lemony cookies were actaully BETTER than the suggested sugar cookie recipe.

These were pretty good.  I did as one other reviewer suggested and increased the sugar to 1 cup rather than 3/4 cup.  They turned out well but I wasn't paying attention to what I was doing and I mixed them a little too long cause after sitting out for a day, they got really hard.  Good cookie though!

Very good recipe!! Did not taste too much like Mrs. Fields, but a close taste. Used it to make candy corn cookies for my stepsons class and it was a huge hit!! Cooked it 25 degrees less and for about a minute or two less and came out great.

My husband, who always wanted us to leave chocolate chip cookies for Santa instead of the traditional sugar cookie cut-outs, was very impressed by these.  My kids loved them. The cookies were soft and chewy instead hard and dry like most. The dough is sticky but parchment paper helps. A keeper.  Thanks for sharing.

Turned out great! I really liked the taste and the fact that they didn't puff up too much so I could decorate them. Kids loved helping bake and eat them! Thank You!

Recipe did not call for baking soda which I thought was strange but I went ahead with the recipe anyway. Wanted to suprise Fiance with Valentine's cookies so made a red, pink and regular colored batch. Put the cookies into the oven and checked after 5 min, cookies were starting to brown but were flat and not at all like a cookie. I highly doubt that Mrs. Fields sugar cookies taste let alone look like these turned out. So much for a suprise...

I now make these cookies every christmas and they always turn out well. They are light, and have a beautiful 'snap' when you bite into them. I often add lemon, orange or lime peel, finely grated to add a little interest to the flavour.  All round great cookies!!

It was late and I was looking for the easiest recipe so I could cure my sweet tooth on a rainy night! These were great. I added a pinch of baking soda, some cinamon and nutmeg! These were quick, easy and didn't make a boat load like many other recipes.

Make the dough EXACTLY as the recipe states and use real butter.  I form the dough into a log, chill at least an hour, slice into 1/4 inch thick slices, press each dough slice into sugar, and bake for twelve minutes. To frost: Mix one box of powdered sugar, 1 teaspoon vanilla, 1 teaspoon rum flavoring or butter flavoring, and enough milk to make a thick icing.  Microwave the icing till very warm and spoon a large glob on top of each cookie - HEAVENLY!!!

This was a great basic sugar cookie recipe.  I would reccomend only baking for the 13 minutes or your edges will brown too much.  I also used the recipe for colored sugar also on the site.

Already great! But, add a tablespoon of honey and a hot chocolate packet. The taste makes you feel like you're riding on a cloud above the pacific.

This is better than my mother's sugar cookie recipe that I've been using for years! (don't tell her that though!) If you roll these cookies thin, they are delightfully crispy, but if you keep them slightly thick, they make a nice soft cookie! These are so good that they don't even need frosting!!

I tried these and I thought they were awesome! I think next time I will try adding 1/4 cup extra sugar to the butter at the beginning of the recipe. I tried rolling half of the dough out using a mixture of cinnamon and sugar instead of flour and they turned out fantastic!

These were good and tasty, but not exactly the ones I was looking for, but they served the purpose as they baked well for me, and my husband kept eating them so I was satisfied. I didn't roll them out as the recipe stated. Instead, I put the dough into a qt. size ziplock bag and let chill in the freezer for about 5-7 minutes which made it a little firmer as my batch was not firm. Then with scissors, I cut open the corner of one end of the bag and squeezed the dough onto the cookie sheet making shapes and swirls. I sprinkled with sugar that I colored with food coloring and let them bake as directed. Thanks for sharing.

I made these for my friends and mother, turns out they were so good that I split them between my friend and mother and I and left the other friend out. They were a big hit, though they took a little while longer to cook. Very good, I will be making them again soon for myself and the friend I left out before

I really loved this recipe!
I thought my cookies came out perfect. I made my own frosting. It was really sweet [a little tangy] so it balanced out great with the cookie.
I didn't roll mine out, I just rolled them in a ball then flattened with a plastic lid. They were great!

I was VERY pleased with how these came out! They were a big hit in my household. I didn't change a thing in the recipe, although I did put them in the freezer for 20 minutes, then in the fridge for the remainder of the firming hour. It was perfect!
I topped them with the 'Cream Cheese Frosting I' recipe found on this site. 
I will definitely be making these again with that frosting!

These were great to put into a cookie cutter after refrigeration... I was worried that they would be too sticky after reading the reviews, but they were the perfect consistency.  The key for me seemed to be a lot of flour on everything (your rolling surface, on the dough, on the rolling pin, on your fingers, etc.).  

However, I can't say I enjoyed the taste of the cookie all that much.  They were satisfactory, but I'm sure there are better tasting cookie recipes out there. These were good for decorating and putting icing on top, but I much preferred tasting the icing than the cookie.  They were also a bit too chewy... for a decorative sugar cookie, I would prefer a harder cookie, but to each their own!

Good tasting sugar cookies.
Worthless for use with cookie cutters.
Even after over 4 hours in the freezer
they had the consistance of pudding.

These were nice and soft and very tasty. I would probably add the extra butter/ sugar other reviews mentioned next time. I would have liked them to be a bit fluffier...

Very good sugar cookies. The first time I used this recipe my dough was still too sticky, even after an hour in the refridgerator. The second batch I used a little more flour, flattened the dough in a ziploc baggie and then rolled the baggie. The dough comes out of the fridge very firm but softens quickly. Great recipe!

These were so sticky and it took a lot to get this dough to work for me. Maybe just my luck.

I'm sorry to say that this recipe did not live up to my expectations. First of all, do NOT increase the butter. Not even a little. I think it has too much as it is. They came out flat as pancakes (maybe flatter) and taste like, well, butter. I even increased the sugar as suggested and that did not help. I've baked plenty of cookies and these were the worst ever. I'm sorry but I have to be honest.

This recipe was super quick and easy and produced a perfect sugar cookie--nice and soft.  I did make one alteration when I made it for my family--I doubled the recipe and instead of adding 2 tsp of vanilla, I added 1 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp of almond extract.  Yum!

Delightfully easy recipe.  I used a very small star cookie cutter.  Baked for only 10 minutes not to burn those delicate points on the stars.  We used the sugar cookies to dip into almond bark fondu.

i've never had mrs. fields' cookies, but these don't seem like they would sell too well...

chewy and would be great for dipping in coffee and such, but not so much just to munch on.

I find this cookie to be tasteless. It is chewey which is nice...but not sweet. If not for the frosting I put on there would be no flavor at all.

These were the best sugar cookies I've ever made. I used Lemon juice instead of Vanilla extract and cound the cookies easy to roll, and cut, they held their shape well and were tender too! My family raved about them and these are the people who usually don't like sugar cookies!

This was the worst cookie I've ever made.  The dough was dry and crumbly, despite the fact that I followed the recipe exactly.  I added another egg so it would actually stick together.  Cookie took over 30 minutes in the oven, and still wasn't done!

Yummy!  I used a full cup of sugar as other reviews suggested.  I chilled the dough overnight and then let sit out a few mins before rolling and had no problems with the dough being sticky.

I altered this recipe a bit and used margarine instead of butter and omitted the salt.  I also used Almond flavour in lieu of vanilla. As an added touch (courtesy of my son) milk chocolate chips were thrown in.  These cookies turned out great!

Easy peasy recipe! I left the dough in the fridge for days and they still came out great! I didnâ€™t decorate them this time due to not having any time, but they are so light and tasty just plain I might skip the decorations on this recipe.

I love this recipe, Iâ€™ve made it for my sons bake sale at school a couple times and theyâ€™ve always sold out fast with people coming back to try to buy more. I do make them thicker than the recipe calls for, which Iâ€™m my opinion makes them a near perfect (if not completely perfect) cookie. They are also a lot of fun to decorate!! Thank you so much for this recipe, itâ€™s my go to for sugar cookies
Edit to include: the wax paper to roll it tip is a life saver. Also if you are cutting the cookies out into shapes, cut parts off to roll and leave the rest in the fridge/freezer. Use a ziplock baggie to store scraps in the fridge/freezer and add to as you get the scraps...otherwise the warmer it gets/more itâ€™s touched the stickier it gets.

I hate icing cookies so I tend to avoid making cookies that needs decorating.  These cookies were so easy to roll out and cut plus they were the best tasting sugar cookie Iâ€™ve ever tried.  I  am actually looking forward to making these again.

Love this recipe. Dough came together easily, wasn't overly sticky and had great flavor. We didn't bother to refrigerate it and they came out great as cutout cookies. We only popped the little extra pieces of dough in the freezer for a couple of minutes while cutting out the others. This one is a keeper!

After years of searching for the perfect sugar cookies recipe, this is the one that put all other recipes to shame.  I followed the recipe exactly.  The only change I made was the baking time.  Each oven varies, but if you remove them from the oven when they begin to look done, but not browning on the bottom, they'll have a perfect "bakery" look and taste to them.  13-15 minutes tends to be a bit too long.

Very good cookies! I added frosting and sprinkles to mine. I also just a small amount, maybe 1/2 - 1 tsp of almond extract. The only thing I would change is adding less sugar (since I added frosting and sprinkles). Very easy recipe. My 3 yr old son helped me. This is our favorite go to cookie recipe!

Used brown sugar which I found made it milder.  Used one full cup of brown sugar.  The trick is definitely do not overwork the dough!! Turn out crispy yet soft and buttery.  Been a hit every time I've made them.  This batch I decided to do a little bit of almond extract.  Though adding maple syrup also had great results.  Going to attempt a pumpkin spice version at some point as well!

Made exactly as written.  At first it seemed that the dough was too dry, but after kneading it a bit it worked fine. Loved that it had no leavening  and so kept shapes very well when baked. It took a couple of rollings to figure out what thickness made the best cookie for us (we like them thin and crisp). It made a relatively small batch, which was also perfect for us. Rerolling the scraps didn't seem to make any difference in the quality of the cookies, another plus.

I use this recipe every time. This recipe is great for cut out cookies, but this time around after mixing the dough, I kneaded for a couple of seconds, wrapped in saran wrap in the shape of a log, froze for thirty minutes, then unwrapped and sliced. The cookies turned out perfectly. One of the best recipes for sugar cookies I have made.

I've used this recipe many times.  Other recipes are too dry and the dough is so hard to roll and crumbly.  This one is amazing and I don't even wait to let it set in the fridge - I make the cookies immediately!  The egg makes the big difference from other recipes I believe.  It's by far suburb to any others!  I'd have to say, the best.  USE THIS RECIPE ONLY IF YOU WANT FAIL-PROOF DELICIOUS EASY TO ROLL OUT COOKIES AGAIN AND AGAIN!!!

It was great!!! My whole family loved I made 3 batches and my family still loves them. I didn't change a single thing except I only baked them for 9 minutes because that's who the edge of the cookies were turning golden brown also got another recipe for sugar cookie icing put it on the cookies and it made them even better. So my advice is either dip them in chocolate or make half the cookie in icing for good looks

I was looking for a quick, small batch, cut out cookie recipe and this was great. I used self-raising flour instead of plain (all purpose) flour just because I like sugar cookies to rise a bit. They turned out light and crisp and perfect for decorating with the kids which was exactly what I wanted. Cheers!

I never comment on recipes, but I had to on this one. I have used the recipe in the past and loved it, but after reading negative revues, thought I might look for another one, only to come accross Mrs. Fields website featuring there "Recipe of the month" with this EXACT sugar cookie recipe! It's a keeper!

These were perfect! The thin icing I put on them went perfect too! The dough was a bit sticky and I had to redo some of the cut outs. But nothing a bit of flour didn't fix.

My dough turned out really gooey and the cookies ended up rubbery. I was disappointed because I know a lot of people had wonderful experiences with these cookies!  I followed the recipe exactly so I would suggest taking other readers suggestions into consideration.

These are wonderful cut out sugar cookies.  I actually used 1 cup sugar and 1 cup butter and they turned out perfect.  After mixing the dough i put the dough in the fridge for an hour or so and it was perfect to roll out on a floured surfice.  I added some mini chocolate chips to mine.  I usually am not that great of a baker, a lot of trial and error,  but these really boosted my confidence.

These cookies were awful. I left them in for the time stated and they were burnt. The second tray I did I did for less time and even though they weren't burnt by the time we iced them they were hard as a rock! I won't be making these again.

I haven't tasted a cookie yet, just pulled them from the oven, but, this was the easiest roll-out dough I have ever worked with.  I separated my dough into thirds, wrapped in wax paper and refrigerated about three hours (while I made my other cookie doughs).  I rolled each section on the wax paper, no additional flour needed!  They kept their shape from wax paper to cookie sheet to cooling rack!  I can't wait to frost them...and eat them of course!

I added 1/8 cup extra of flour and 1/4 cup of sugar. Dough turned out great never had to put it in the refrig. After flouring the table before rollong it out it was perfect. Made my kids hand prints in them for Thanksgiving (to make turkeys) and it turned out great. It kept the shape and tasted great.

These cookies were delicious and they smelled so good while baking! They are not quite Mrs. Fields sugar cookies, but they are just as good. The second time I made them I added 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/4 cup more of sugar to the mix and they also turned out fantastic. I suggest you try them first as the original recipe so that you can customize them to your own liking the second time around.

These were really good. I used a whole cup of  sugar as suggested by another reviewer and I think these cookies may not have been sweet enough without the added sugar. I don't bake much so I had to use a glass to roll with and the mouth of a double-shot glass as a cookie cutter. Sprinkled with regular granulated sugar and cooked for awhile longer than sugggested.

Very easy and quick prep time.  I haven't tasted them yet, though the dough was delicious...:)  I needed a lot of flour to roll them out and cut them, but I think I just have to get used to sugar cookie dough...

Nice light texture. Rather than roll the dough out, I just made it into balls and pressed it flat with the bottom of a drinking glass covered in sugar. Worked out great and added just a tad of sweetness. Frosted with lemon frosting and it was so good!

quick, easy, and delicious. My kids had fun putting frosting and sprinkles on them.
These are definitely better NOT golden brown. I like them *just* cooked.

Made a batch with my kid, and we thought there was something weird at first but then we realized that we just have never made sugar cookies that tasted that good.  Our taste buds were just not used to it.

I thought they were awesome!  I didn't bother to roll them out though.  I just made balls and cooked them.  When they were fresh out of the oven I took a spoon and smushed them down a bit.  Not too sweet.  Perfect!

Eww (that is what my sisters said about the flavor)...this is not a recipe I will use again. However, they rolled out great after an hour in the fridge which is good if you want to use them for ornaments :). Happy Holidays.

These cookies did not turn out for me. It seemed like they were too soft to roll out, but too hard to put into a cookie press, almost like there was too much fat in them. When I rolled them into a ball and baked them that way, they came out flat as a piece of paper. I threw the whole batch away! I don't know what I did, but I won't be making these again.

What in the world??  I agree with other reviews, there has to be something wrong/missing with this recipe.  I followed the advice of others and increased the sugar and butter.  They were easy to roll out with lots of flour and I left them pretty thick, but after baking, the cookies completely flattened out and are full of holes and transparent!!  Guess no sugar cookies this year.

My family didn't care for these.  I followed the suggestions for extra butter and using lots of flour to roll, but they were still really sticky and the taste wasn't improved.  They really do need a heavy sugar frosting to make them have any kind of flavor, sprinkles weren't enough.

These cookies are best use for cookie cutting.  I thought maybe they would be alright to drop on the sheet and bake, however, mine stayed in the exact same shape as when they went in.  The cookie dough was also very crumbly, and I had to squash it together with my hands to get it to stay together.  The taste wasn't bad.  Will go with another recipe next time.

FANTASTIC!!! I was a little skeptical because I read such mixed reviews but they came out perfect. I followed the recipe exactly except I put the dough in the freezer for about 15 minutes and then in the fridge. I divided the dough into thirds and used one third at a time and kept the rest in the fridge. I had no problem with rolling the dough and cutting out the shapes. I just kept adding flour. I made sure not to let the edges brown and to take the cookies out when it was still soft. I used M&Ms to decorate and it was a good combination as the dough was not overly sweet. If you do like very sweet cookies this recipe is not for you.

I was so surprised at the mixed reviews on this cookie! I don't think it's as good as Mrs. Fields (Although I haven't had a Mrs. Fields cookie in ages!) but it was still good.
My 3yo son and I made this cookie but I forgot to read the suggested changes before I made it. Then I forgot to add in the 3rd quarter of the butter! (Cooking w/ds always distracts me.) However, the cookies still turned out great! They were a heavier cookie, chewy, soft, and not too sweet. (I am a sweet tooth but my dh and ds are not so this is a good recipe for our family.) I might add the full cup of sugar next time just so I can have the little extra sweetness. We're keeping this one!

The dough didn't form what so ever.  It was crumbly.  I added a TBS of water, milk would have also been fine, but I didn't have any on hand.  And the cookies were a bit stiff and too chewy.  It might have been an ok cookie if you added a tsp of baking soda.

I followed the recipe and the dough was way too sticky; even flour didn't provide much help. After a lot of work to roll and cut out the cookies, they took much longer to cook than recipe says.  Cookies tasted okay and the texture seemed off, although some frosting made them better.

These were pretty good. I couldn't figure out when to take them out of the oven, and most of them got pretty hard. I guess I should've taken them out when they still seemed almost raw. I'd like a cookie to be a little more golden than thse were when cooked for the right amount of time. They were a little bland, but maybe all sugar cookies are.

OKay! This recipe....hmmm....in one word- ordinary. It was not bad with sugar coating it, but definitely not good without it! It was okay, but not Mrs. Fields good. I had my hopes up too high before making this cookie because of the name Mrs. Fields, but it is an ordinary cookie- not necessarily bad tasting- but ordinary.

My daughter and I made these cookies for Santa.  She enjoyed cutting out the different shapes and decorating the cookies.  Everyone who ate them were surprised that sugar cookies could be chewy.  Loved the recipe!

My six year old daughter and I tried this recipe for first time and was truly thrilled with this recipe.  The dough was easy to work with and re-rolled very well.  They tasted GREAT...wonderful recipe!

These cookies are light and not too sweet.  They go great with frosting or without.
My daughter loves to help cut them out.

Yum!  Instead of sprinkling with sugar I iced some using "Butter Icing for Cookies."  This makes them super sweet and should satisfy anyone's sweettooth.
