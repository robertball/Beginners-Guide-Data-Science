I made this following the recipe exactly and it is very good. It has good texture and rise. I personally found the spice level to be a little low. Next time I will use 3 teaspoons each of nutmeg and cinnamon like my non-gluten free recipe. I'll be taking that to Thanksgiving this year. Thanks for a great gluten free option!

The people I made this for said it was fabulous.
If I make it again I will put raisins in.

I only made the bread, no icing. Next time I will let it cool completely before taking it out of the pan or cutting it.  It was very good!
