Classic pesto, just like it's name. I have to admit, that we are not a huge fans of pesto pasta in our family, but we do like basil, and plant some every year with the seeds from the previous years plants. I like to make pesto and freeze it in ice cube trays, and them pop out the cubes and put them in a zip-lock bag to use with soups, stews, veggies, potatoes, etc. throughout the year. That's what I did with this batch that I just made. My basil plants are currently flowering and going to seed, so this made a great use of those last few leaves on the branches.
