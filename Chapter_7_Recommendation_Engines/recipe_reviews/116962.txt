This was so tasty and simple! One of the best textured coffee cakes I've made. We loved it. It would be equally as delish with apples or no fruit at all. I followed the recipe but it needed an extra 10 minutes in the oven and I used my 'standard' coffee cake topping that's a cinch to make. Jot this down and use it whenever you need a topping/filling for coffee cakes, crumbles, etc.: 1 c. flour 1 c. brown sugar 1 c. chopped walnuts 1 c. oatmeal 1 TBL cinnamon 1/2 c. melted butter Combine the dry ingredients and stir in the melted butter until everything is moistened. Don't overmix, you want it crumbly. Easy!  This basic cake recipe is a keeper and I foresee all kinds of variations in the future. Thanks!

It was gobbled up at work very quickly. Made a moist dense cake. I was not sure how to divide the nuts and filling/topping.  I just ended up whirling the butter, nuts, etc. in the food processor and putting half in the middle of the cake and the other half on top.  That seemed to work fine.  I used three smallish pears, and chopped them in the processor as well.  I lined the bottom of the springform pan w/ parchment, and it was easy to pop the cake out, invert, peel off the paper, then re-invert onto a serving plate without the bottom of the pan on the plate.

Made in a 9x13 because i don't have a springform pan.  Used 5 pears.  Was nervous because the batter was very thin under and over the pears.  Needed more struesel topping due to the size of the pan.  Baked 45 min at 350 degrees.  Got rave reviews at the Christmas gathering I brought it to today.  Requests for the recipe.

Fabulous!! My mom has pear trees in her yard and I ended up coming back home with 3 big boxes of pears that needed to be used up. I came across this recipe in my searches and figured I'd give it a try. I was not disappointed! It came out very moist and full of flavour! The only changes I made were cutting back the sugar to 3/4 cup and I used 3 pears instead of 2 (since I have so many!). I'll be making another of these (or 2 or 3) before the week is out.

Fabulous. Beyond belief delicious. one of the best textured cakes I have ever made. My pears were a little on the small side, so next time I'll make sure I have more pear in there.

I followed the recipe to a "t" except I had to use a 10" springform pan. It baked up perfectly in 45 minutes. This is so incredible-moist & flavorful, I ended up making 2 more! Thank you so much-we love, love, love it!!

I am not quite sure what I did wrong, but it took a lot longer than 55 minutes to cook this. My oven is calibrated correctly (I bake a LOT) and I used a 9-inch springform pan. It still ended up baking this about 75 minutes. When the cake was done, it tasted good and was moist, but it was still a bit too squishy in the very center. Maybe the pears I used were too big and juicy? Anyway, this does taste good and I recommend it, expecially if you are looking to bake with pears. Just make sure to check the middle with a toothpick before you finish baking.

Using two ripe pears is just enough to make one layer of sliced pears with very little overlapping, and next time I think I might add another pear to make a thicker pear layer.  I put the pear slices in the middle as directed, but did not use the pear and lemon juice that drained away as I thought it might be soggy.  I baked it for 55 min on convection bake and an additional 5 min on regular bake, and I thought it was just perfect!  Very pretty too.  The only change I made was to substitute a little applesauce for part of the butter in the batter.

Despite my many issues with this cake (self-inflicted issues) it was delicious.  I made as directed with a couple exceptions.  Added grated ginger to the pear mixture.  Also decided to bake in a 9" cake pan.  Big mistake.  The cake was much too big for the pan, and it flowed over. Luckily I thought it might do it, so I put a cookie sheet in the rack below.  I also wasn't cooked through in the time specified, even though I checked it with a toothpick.  The edges were perfect but the middle wasn't.  Beside those couple issues, it was very tasty! The pear provided a nice moistness and great texture in the middle.  (The ginger was great with it by the way).   I also happen to like cake batter so it kind of worked out being a little gooey in the middle! If anyone has trouble with which one is "reserved" and which is "topping"- the topping has the butter in it!

This recipe is great.  I made it to take to a Christmas luncheon and there was only one small piece left. My husband said it was great.  My springform pan is only 8-1/2, so my cake took longer to bake.  I also added a cup of oats to the recipe and I used fat free sour cream.  I baked my cake for about 1 hour and 20 minutes.  I'll make this one again.

This was good, but I think I like some others better.  I made this using chopped apples, rather than sliced pears and I was short the last 1/2 cup of walnuts, so I had to leave those off the top.  I also drizzled this with a confectioners sugar icing to fancy it up.  If you’re going to make this, plan to dirty just about every bowl in your kitchen.  This recipe is a bit more complicated than it first appears.

Very good coffee cake. After reading the other reviews, I decided to make it in my 10 inch pan and am glad I did, because it still took almost an hour to cook. I reduced the sugar in the cake to 1/2 cup, but other than that followed the recipe. Will definitely make this again. Great flavour and texture. I think it would also be good with different fruit and nut combinations. Hmmm... red currants and almonds, perhaps? Rhubarb instead of pears? Apple and pecan??

Delicious! My mom actually made this today and shared some with us and we LOVED it! She said it was fairly easy, but did dirty a lot of bowls/measuring cups/spoons in the process, lol, but  it was worhtit! Great texture and flavor. She said she will be making this again, maybe trying it w/ peaches next time, which I think sounds wonderful! I can't wait to actually make this myself. Thanks for sharing. :)

This was a wonderful and moist coffee cake.  I will definitely hold onto the recipe to make again.  The basic recipe is good the way it's written, but I made some changes based on what I had in the house.  I used 2 pears and 2 apples, thought the flavors would go well together, and pecans instead of walnuts.  I also toasted the pecans first before chopping them which really makes the pecans fragrant.  I used light sour cream and Saigon Cinnamon because it has a much more intense flavor than traditional cinnamon.  Because there was twice the amount of fruit, I used a larger springform pan and layered half the fruit in the middle and half on top.  The topping went over the fruit and made it stick well.  The cake had to bake about 15 minutes longer, but the end result was well worth it!

I had VERY ripe pears (two on the large side and one small) and wanted to use them so I tried this cake.  I read the reviews and the lady who used a 9" pan and found that the cake overflowed scared me a bit, so I used a 10" pan.  I now wish I didn't because I think I would prefer it a bit higher than what I got.  Mine definitely would have not overflowed in a 9".  Also, the recipe said to put 2/3 of the batter below the pears and 1/3 above it.  It's fine like that, but next time, I think I would go closer to half and half, as the pears were a bit too close to the top for me.  Maybe if I used a 9" pan, this would not have been the case.  Also, the batter is very thick and sticky.  To spread the batter, dampen your fingertips with warm water to level out the batter.  Using a spatula will drive you crazy.  Flavourwise - very good.  Next time I might drizzle a little homemade caramel sauce over top for a touch of sweetness.  Overall, very good.  I will make it again (in a 9" pan)!

What an awesome recipe!! I made this to put in our bakery and I sold out!! Here are the adjustments that I made. I freshly ground my soft white wheat into pastry flour right before I mixed it up. This makes a world of difference. I used organic evaporated cane juice instead of the sugar. We are an All Natural/Organic Bakery and use fresh ground flour, organic sweeteners and sea salt. Even with the 100% whole wheat the recipe was  fabulous!!! I will definitely be making this recipe again.

Baked in a 9X13 baking pan, made 2 times the topping/ filling and used 4 pears. It was a challenge to get the batter to cover the pears but it was worth it! Great recipe. Thanks for posting!

Flavor is outstanding. I used vanilla yogurt instead of sour cream and mine turned out custardy in the middle. Absolutely heavenly!

I reduced the sugar in the filling to 3/4 cup. The cake is very moist and my family loved it. I'm giving it 4 stars because I feel like it's missing something in the flavor, maybe use more vanilla or cinnamon.

This recipe is fantastic! I followed it very closely. I didn't have sour cream, so I substituted non-fat plain yoghourt and it came out amazing. I suppose this would be a good way to reduce the fat in this recipe, but I can't wait to try this again with sour cream.

We love this coffee cake!  The recipe was difficult to follow.  I got confused with all of the "reserved" topping and "reserved" walnuts, but was able to sort it all out half way through the process.  I suggest reading the recipe thoroughly, and organizing all ingredients prior to beginning the prep.  Preparation is extensive, but it is certainly worth it.  The cake is very moist...topping crunchy and buttery.  Definitely a "keeper" as my husband says.

I love walnuts, so this was perfect.  I made it just like it said and it turned out wonderful.  It wasn't as sweet as some coffee cakes, but still delicious.

Yummy, beautiful, and I enjoyed all the steps ;) It made me feel like I was doing something complicated but it wasn't that hard, just followed the directions. The only change I made was to decrease the amount of walnuts on top. I used finely chopped walnuts and that made the texture real nice. My son, who doesn't like nuts, even ate it.

My first is in the oven but I can already tell it will be delicious!  I did add 1/4 teaspoon of cardamon to the batter because I think it compliments pears well.  The only thing negative is, even for a very experienced baker, the directions are not easy to follow.  And, the batter should NOT be mixed in a small mixing bowl.  There is just simply too much batter for a small bowl.  I suggest being very organized before starting this recipe.  It does require nearly every bowl you have within reach.

I didn't eat any of this ~ took it to my physical therapy office ... while I was doing my physical therapy the cake filled the exercise room with the rich scent of butter and cinnamon.  People immediately went over to the side counter and began to cut off slice after slice.... some folks resisted ~ but not many.  I overheard the people comment on how absolutely delicious it was.  An elderly gent asked me to carefully detail how to make the amazing topping and he repeated it to himself as if he was going home to make the cake or one like it immediately.  One therapist came in just an hour after the cake arrived and found it gone....  He spoke to me of how many people were loving it at my next appt.  I baked mine for a good long time in a Pampered Chef Stoneware Round large casserole pan (?10"?diam.)  While it took a bit longer to bake I was patient and the folks loved it!

I made this recipe a couple times about eight years ago and everyone including myself loved it.  I have been searching for it since then because my grandmother threw away the magazine it was in.  I am very pleased to have found it at this web site.  I can't wait to make it again.  Thank you.

This was excellent!  I used wheat flour because I was out of white, and even so, it was still moist.  I'm sure it's great with white flour as well.  The only thing I might change would be to add more pears; 2 was a bit sparse.

If you like walnuts and pears I would definitely make this coffee cake.  The cake is light with hints of pear and distinctive taste of walnut. We have 2 pear trees on our property which keep us in pears for the winter. Very good recipe! Give it a try.

Great recipe!!! First scratch coffee cake I ever made, and it came out great! Needed 60+ min in my oven, but super moist and fluffy cake. Would go great with vanilla ice cream, and next time I'll probably use more pears. Awesome recipe though, thanks!

Wow, Darlene, I love your recipe!  I made this for our Christmas Eve brunch and followed the instructions as written except for adding an additional pear.  The cake was flavorful, light and a pleasure to serve.  I will certainly make this again and again!

This cake was still mush in the middle after 50 minutes and I always use an oven thermometer to make sure my oven is properly heated. I wonder if this recipe was originally made in a convection oven? After 75 minutes I took it out (top was getting to brown) even though the knife still was a little moist. It needs the full hour to cool and continue to cook, even though the warm pears are yummy. I roasted the nuts in the oven to enhance their flavor before chopping. While making the cake I thought “this better be good for all the bowls I will be washing” and it is. Even my picky-pooh husband, who always has something to say about how a recipe could be better, liked it.  Would have given 5 stars if the sides and top hadn't gotten a little to brown and dry.

I never made coffee cake before, and this was really good. I didn't really notice the pears much, since they have such a mild flavor, but thought this was moist and tasty. I don't have a spring form pan, so cooked this in a 9" round cake pan which I greased, and it slid out easily onto the wire rack.
