I made this in the blender with cold
coffee, three large ice cubes and whole milk. I also upped the brown sugar to
two tablespoons and used Starbucks 
butter caramel sauce. EDITED: Now that I make this to reflect a healthier lifestyle, I use fat free half-n-half or fat free evaporated milk and sugar free caramel. Tastes the same but less issues with my blood sugars and I don't worry so much about calories.

Very, very good. Subtle sweetness.
Great for those hot days when you want
an iced coffee but don't want to pay
$5 for one from Starbucks.

This was so good!  I used Splenda Brown Sugar blend and Smuckers sugar free Carmel Sauce (made with Splenda) and I couldn't tell the difference.  This will be a weekend staple.

This was absolutely delicious!  I used caramel sauce made for coffee (Torani, I think), but since I'm a wimp if coffee flavor is too strong, I added an additional tablespoon of brown sugar.  I really enjoyed it, and even with the extra sugar it wasn't too sweet.  I prefer to have this over Starbuck's!  And I think next time I will use the recommended amount of brown sugar to give it a try.

Wow, this was good! It reminded me of a quick version of a caramel machiato, but even tastier. I am tempted to come up with a lighter version, but this is so good I think I might just save it for a special treat. I never thought to add brown sugar to coffee. Yummy!

I made this latte with 2% milk (a little more than the recipe called for) instead of the half and half and it was delicious with a lesser calorie count. I also sprinkled some brown sugar on the top, because I was serving it to guests, and was very happy with the visual result.

Seemed to be missing something so I added cinnamon on top.  The family raved.

This tastes wonderful. I like my coffee a little sweet, so I added an extra half tablespoon of brown sugar and 1/4 teaspoon of sugar. Also, like I do with all of my coffee drinks...I use ice cream and melt it, then use it as creamer. Of course, only use these recommendations if you don't mind sugar rushes and crashes.

Easy and delicious!  Now if I could find an easy caramel recipe that I could make I could ALWAYS have all of this on hand.  (I, too, iced it - yum!)

I LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe!  I've been looking for a recipe that would duplicate my favorite coffeehouse drink and this is it!  It's a great drink hot or cold, I've tried it both ways.  The only thing I changed was, if I drink it cold, I add a little bit more brown sugar and then blend in the blender with a few ice cubes.  YUM!  UPDATE 7/8/12:  I make this recipe all the time... since I've been drinking it so often, I started using 2% milk in place of the half and half and I can't tell a taste difference, it's still delicious!  I bet even Skim Milk would be good in this... can you believe I actually pass up my favorite coffee place now to come home and make this instead?  I never would've thought that would happen!  If you use Pioneer Woman's method of making cold-brewed iced coffee (No coffee maker required - I'm hooked!!) and keeping it in the fridge, this drink whips up in a snap... my new favorite!  If you want the best iced coffee of your life, you need to try this recipe!

Made this and loved it! I have caramel flavored syrup, so I used that instead of the ice cream topping. My husband will only drink coffee if it's from Starbucks, but he took a sip of this and finished the rest in less than a minute. Win!

I am soooo not a coffee drinker.  Recently, however, I have started stealing hubby's cappuccino.  He suggested I find an alternative...lol.  I tried this and decided that maybe I am, just a little bit of a coffee drinker, after all.  I didn't really measure anything...just eyeballed it.  It could be a little sweeter, in my book...or maybe my coffee was too strong.  In any case, I will definitely make again!

I just tried this using Torani caramel flavoring and whole milk. It turned out a lot sweeter than I like, but I think if I tweak the brown sugar next time, it will be perfect for my tastes.

I made this in my Ninja Coffee Bar and the presentation is very nice.  I poured the caramel syrup into the mug first, then I poured the brown sugar-half-and-half frothed mixture and then placed the mug in the Ninja Coffee Bar and......voila! A layered coffee drink that is not only delicious but looks it also.

I enjoyed this just about as much as Starbucks' version!  It's so easy, too!  You're right, the battery-powered frother makes it extra special!

I used milk instead of half and half, and Kahlua flavored coffee from my Keuring, since I don't have an espresso machine.  Delish!

Awesome-ness! Great combination of brown sugar and caramel! I also like that this latte has more coffee (I used three shot of espresso) than milk. Added fresh homemade whipped cream and a sprinkle of cinnamon on top!

If you like the regular iced coffee at McDonald's you'll like this.  I needed a little more sugar that what the recipe called for and I substituted chocolate topping for the caramel because that was what I had on hand.

I heated the caramel syrup and the brown sugar with the water for the coffee.  There was no problem with the caramel syrup settling at the bottom when I  finished my drink. This makes a great cold drink with ice cubes are blended in!

Wow :) love this.  I've made a pitcher of iced coffee every Sunday for about the last 5-6 years.  We love it, so we've tried many combinations, this is one of my absolute favorites - with a pinch of cinnamon.  although I have to add the cinnamon to my cup separately because DH doesn't care for cinnamon in his coffee.  Other wonderful variations - vanilla, amaretto flavoring, a dash of nutmeg, even coconut!
and of course about a half pack of hot chocolate :)
YUM - Thank you Bjergins, a great recipe!

Good flavor, but instead of half & half I would use heavy whipping cream.  The foam wasn't worth the work.

This was good...I'm just not terribly fond of half & half in my coffee, so I didn't like it as much as I hoped I would.

I often use caramel flavor syrup in my coffee so this tasted similar to my regular morning coffee. The recipe called for more caramel than I typically use, which was good, and the addition of brown sugar instead of my usual sweet n low was a very welcome change. A delicious drink.

I love caramel lattes from coffee shops, but I thought this was too caramel-y and lost the coffee flavor.  Next time I will use about half the caramel syrup.

Very delicious. My daughter and I used La Lechera by Nestles (my family says this is the best caramel sauce) and I believe this made all the difference.  We enjoyed making and drinking this together.

Edited to add...I did make it again and it's yummy! Maybe I didn't froth the milk the first time? Not sure since we don't have a frother. But I used a whisk this time and some leftover coffee. Maybe the coffee wasn't as strong. Good flavor but a bit to coffee-ish for me. I don't like the taste of coffee but like frozen coffee drinks, iced coffee drinks, etc as long as I don't notice the coffee too much! After making as written and trying it, I added a tad more half-and-half so I could drink it. I probably won't be making this one again though.

It was pretty good despite the fact that I used milk instead of half and half.

I made this per the recipe, using my milk frothier, with one change.  I used 1% milk, instead of half and half because I was out of half and half.   It tastes good; I think it would have been a bit richer with half and half, but this is good.  I’ll get some and try it again to see what difference it makes.  I sprinkled a bit of cinnamon on top.

Didn't change a thing. It was marvelous and a lot less expensive than a coffee shop. Now I can have one for pennies anytime I want.

A nice treat similar to what you would buy at a fancy coffee shop. I made this exactly as written and it was tasty. A tad to sweet for me but that's a personal preference. Will definitely make this again with less brown sugar as I love Carmel lattes.

I made this recipe just as prepared, and it is fantastic!  What a satisfying drink, and just 184 calories!  I was easily consuming this many calories by dressing my coffee with cream and white sugar.  This is a perfect drink for sipping while at my desk.  Love it and I can't wait to make it again...tomorrow morning!

This is definitely a dessert--so sweet, and really good. I could go with half the sugar and half the caramel sauce, and it would still be great for me.

I'm a total coffee wimp, so I love the really sweet drinks. I don't have a milk frother, so I just use a whisk or a fork. I would never have thought to add brown sugar to my latte (or sundae sauce in lieu of fancy coffee syrup, for that matter)! This is a tasty drink warm, and I imagine it would be just as good iced. It *is* very sweet--my dad liked it as-is, but preferred it with a little less sugar.

This is a great recipe for a cold day!  It tastes like Starbucks' coffee and is fun to make.
