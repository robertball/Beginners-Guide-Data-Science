I followed the recipe closely, only cutting back on the salt a bit and omitting the ginger. I threw in a few seasonings (onion powder, garlic powder, italian seasoning) to give it a little more flavor. I used my Perfect Meatloaf Pan to cook this meat loaf--I had to reverse the brown sugar/ketchup to the top of the meat loaf as my pan has holes in the bottom for the grease to drain. A little over an hour in the oven and fifteen minutes to rest and we were ready to go. Not bad--this was a quick meat loaf that paired well with mashed potatoes and was nice and firm for sandwiches the next day.

This turned out so yummy! I only had about half the breadcrumbs on hand and didn't have any ginger but otherwise followed the recipe, it turned out fantastic! At the end I melted a bit of mozza on top and it was great! Will definitely make this one again!

I used panko breadcrumbs 1 1/2 cups it worked perfectly. I forgot to grease the pan before putting in meatloaf but I solved it by dripping evoo all around the pan between meatloaf and the sides and it worked like a charm!! Didn't burn at all in my small oven! :)

Wow my husband never asks what I did to the meat loaf but he did today. I was not sure if it would be a good thing but it was. I did not use the whole wheat bread crumbs. I make a few changes to this recipe I did use cracker crumbs and a bit of oatmeal as well as some bread crumbs and added garlic to the meat mixture & to the ketchup sauce I added dried mustard & Worcestershire sauce but other than that followed the recipe. This will be my go to recipe from now on.

Question - Healthier than what?  Seems like baking the sugary  glaze into the bottom along with the grease makes it less healthy.   And the low fat milk and whole wheat crumbs are of negligible difference nutritionally overall.  To actually make this healthier, sub 3/4 of an 8 oz can of tomato sauce for milk, use only 1 egg, sub 1/3 C oatmeal for bread crumbs and for the topping use  remaining 1/4 can of tomato sauce  mixed with up to 2 tsp brown sugar Splenda ( stronger taste and sweetening power).  Spread it over the top during the last five minutes of cooking.  Great hot or cold in sandwiches.

I really liked this meatloaf. It made a basic home-style meatloaf. It was nice that I didn't have to figure out a topping later on and it baked with the meatloaf on the bottom. My only changes were I believe the lean ground beef I had was a 2 lb package. I chose to use 1 tsp of salt instead of 1.5 tsp. I figured extra salt could be added and ketchup had plenty. The only bread crumbs I had were panko, so that is what I used. After 1 hour there was a lot of liquid on the top and the onions didn't seem fully cooked. I scraped off the extra liquid, sprayed the top with a little olive oil to crisp it up some, and put it back in the oven. It actually took a full 30 minutes longer. That was no problem, as long as it was fully cooked along with the onions. I turned it out onto a foil lined baking sheet with sides. I suggest that unless a large platter is available as it does produce some excess tomato  liquid that can get messy. I got 11 1" slices, approximately, from one loaf, at 196 calories each as made above. Ty

My whole family LOVED this recipe. I put the ketchup/brown sugar mix on top, and used slightly less salt but otherwise did it the same and it was perfect! Tender, soft and VERY flavorful. This will be made many times in our house. Thanks!

I used half lean turkey and half lean beef.  I also left out the salt, my husband and I don't like added salt in our food.  Followed recipe for the rest of the process.  Turned out great, we both really liked the flavor.  Would definitely make again.

To be honest, I don’t care for meatloaf so this is my family’s input.  My DD loved it and gave it 5 stars.  My DH said it was good and gave it 4 stars but complained that there wasn’t enough glaze which he loves, so I made extra topping in a saucepan.  I sautéed the onions until transparent before adding it to the beef mixture.  I also recommend using less salt.

My husband LOVED this meatloaf and he usually is jut okay about meatloaf.  The only substitution i made was using panko crumbs b/c that's all i had and adding garlic powder.  threw some cut potatoes on the top to cook with the meatloaf and it was good to go.  Even my 9month baby loved it!  Thanks for the recipe.  It's super easy and definitely a keeper for us.

This was my first time making meatloaf for my husband and I. It was not bad at all and he even had seconds! As we ate he asked me what was all in it and when I said ketchup he sort of froze but enjoyed it. The only thing I did different was put the sauce on top and sprinkled the brown sugar over the ketchup. Pretty yummy.

This was good.  I used Panko because that's what I had.  I used 1 1/2 cups of panko because that's what another reviewer said was perfect but I think that was too much and I will use the suggested amount next time.  I chopped the onions so much that were almost emulsified because my daughter hates onions in meatloaf.....she was none the wiser and had no idea onions were in this recipe.  I'll make again.

Really enjoyed it!! I used Panko crumbs because that’s what I had(1.5 cups like someone else had suggested) and I opted the onion out and added garlic and onion powder.. and I didn’t have a meatloaf dish so I free cooked it in a pan and put the ketchup mixture &sugar  over top! (Also added Worcestershire & mustard to ketchup like another suggested) was awesome. Will keep the recipe!

We both liked it very much.  Used 1 lb of ground beef and adjusted the other ingredients accordingly.  I checked the temp a 45 minutes and it was just about done.  Gave it another 5.
Had enough left over for my lunch the next day.  We used 2% milk.
Will make again soon.

Great recipe!  I used ground turkey.  Omitted the milk.  Added siracha with the ketchup and brown sugar (sooo good) and used panko breadcrumbs instead of saltines (did not have saltines).  Absolutely delicious.

Loved it, used less onion and added minced squash, (zucchini or carrots would work too) to make it even more healthy. It would be great even without the brown sugar because there's lots of sugar in the ketchup, of course then it would need a new name!

Delicious Meatloaf!!!  I substituted quick oats for the wheat bread crumbs.  I also added a touch (1 teaspoon) of  balsamic vinegar to the brown sugar sauce. 
Timely tip:  Use a muffin pan to bake meatloaves in.  Be sure to spray with cooking oil first.  Bake 350 for 30- 40 minutes.  Let cool for a few minutes and release each meatloaf muffin with a rubber scraper or other heat safe plastic.   These individual loaves are convenient and cook quicker than traditional meatloaf in a bread pan.  Serve with sauce on the side.

This recipe is amazing! I had never used milk in a meatloaf recipe, so I was a little worried about how it would taste and it tastes so good! 
I had to double the recipe the second time because we all wanted to make meatloaf sandwiches. It's good bot and cold!
I switched the meat to ground turkey (85-15) and I used whole wheat panko.  Other than that, I followed the recipe.
This meatloaf has now entered into the dinner and lunch rotation!

Easiest meatloaf recipe I’ve ever made and it tastes great! I didn’t use the ginger and I used a salt substitute. I’ve already made it three times adding different ingredients and it’s always delicious.

I always use this recipe when I make meatloaf. I followed the recipe as written the first time I made it. However, I made a couple changes. I do not add brown sugar and I replace the ketchup with tomato sauce (not pasta sauce).

I replaced the brown sugar with Just Panela, used pink salt, and use aluminum foil instead, came out a bit dry (maybe because I used super lean and low-fat meat). oh, and I also used some turmeric/Curcuma.  
And my turmeric from Amazon in Organic  Feel Good store!

Hands down this is the best meatloaf I've ever eaten, I didn't think it was even possible to like meatloaf, let alone LOVE IT!! This is by far the best tasting, and I didn't think I'd be reviewing meatloaf, would only make it because husband likes meatloaf, well now we all love meatloaf, thanks for the great recipe!

This is my 2nd time making this. I got a tough crowd to please especially since I'm the last one in family chosen to do the cooking.  My husband loved it, my 9 year old fussy eater granddaughter loves it. Says it good and sweet. Everyone's been pleased. Now I have to cook more than usual. LOL

Delicious!!  I only changed (added) a couple things, otherwise left the recipe as is.  Added fried onions, mrs. dash, garlic to the meat, only used 3/4 cup of milk, 1 1/4 cup of half panko, half breadcrumbs.  Super moist. The brown sugar/ketchup mixture made more like a soup at the bottom, but it was ok because I poured the mixture over the whole meatloaf.  This is a definite repeat!!

I made meatloaf as written,,I used 85% lean as suggested..The meatloaf drained its fat into the pan and mixed with the brown sugar..It seemed to simmer in its own juice and fat.. I would make it again..BUT I wouldn't use a loaf pan, I wouldn't put the brown sugar and ketchup on the bottom..instead, I'd let it cook in a  7x10 casserole dish and half way through, I spread the ketchup/brown sugar mixture over the top of loaf.

Liked the overall texture. I did add Italian sausage because I use in my regular meatloaf. I used it to total the amount of beef with the sausage.
My husband thought it was too sweet, because I don't usually use sugar.
Thought it was ok.

Made it according to recipe using the 9x5 pan. I would either add 1/4 lb of ground sirloin OR use a smaller pan.
It was great!

Made it almost as written.  ( Had no ginger nor parsley & used Italian bread crumbs which I had)
Delicious! After cooling, sliced into serving pieces & placed in freezer. Quick to defrost & heat. Will definetly make again.

Someone please educate me. This dish looks delicious, but when I see the ingredient “ketchup” I move on to another recipe.

I hate meatloaf, but tempt me and I'll eat anything. I've used Demerara Sugar, rather than brown sugar for years now. Started using it in my meat rubs, loved the unique taste, reminiscent of Demerara Rum. Have to have a little heat to go with the sweet, a double dash of hot pepper flakes. If you try Demerara go low and slow on the cooking temp or risk a hard candy crust. I use the "Keep warm" function in the oven, it cooks around 200F, until an internal temp of 160F. Count on 2-2 1/2 times on the cooking time. My oven is my -40F winter smoker, works like a charm.

Baking meatloaf in a loaf pan versus free form on a rack guarantees a greasy meatloaf...much better to invert the mixture and topping onto a rack so that the fat drains off.

I'm puzzled by the fanfare about using brown sugar for less sugar...I've never added any sugar to my meatloaf and it's always been delicious. I tried this recipe and thought it was just okay, so I gave it 3 stars.

This was really good, probably my best meatloaf ever! I made it according to directions, minus the ginger only because I forgot it. At first I was hesitant to put the brown sugar and ketchup on the bottom. I was thinking that should be on top, but it turned out to be delicious. I've never put milk in meatloaf before but that was fine as well. The only thing I added was some tomato paste on top during the last 15 minutes of cooking. This recipe is a keeper!

I made this recently. BEST MEATLOAF EVER! It got rave reviews. I doubled the recipe, but DID NOT double the milk.  I am glad I did not.  It was the perfect consistency.  Also I did not have crackers so I used packaged Italian Seasoned Bread Crumbs. I also DID NOT put the glaze in the bottom of the baking dish.  That made no sense to me.  I spread it on the top and sides.  this is a keeper. Firm (sliced well), juicy, delicious.

"Mom, you struck out again" and "Mom, I'll eat this but never make it again" were just two of the comments heard during dinner when I made this meatloaf. Texture was off,  and the taste was bland despite adding garlic powder, onion powder, and Worchestershire sauce to bump up the taste. Just lacked any flavor and the loaf was almost a little mushy, even though it was set and cooked through. Will not be making this again.

This was super moist & delicious, and had great flavor. . I'd like to reverse the brown sugar & ketchup and put it on the top. I used ground turkey burger instead of beef. Yummy!

This was really good!  The only reason I'm only giving it 4 stars is that it was really watery/greasy on top after an hour in the oven. I ended up draining most of the liquid and turning it out onto a foil-lined baking sheet, then baked it for another 5 min or so until the ketchup firmed up a bit. My husband is picky about his meatloaf but he liked it too!!

Tasted great! I didn't have ginger so I left that out. I would suggest using meat that is not so high in fat. 70% is just too greasy and you will pour out grease at least twice.

I would probably add more Ginger next time as I couldn't taste it, but I liked the brown sugar flavor, which I have never put in meatloaf.

I definitely will make this a keeper. The thin layer of brown sugar gives the meat loaf a delicate flavour. My husband loved it. Easy to make and delicious.

Used ground turkey and beef mix and put the ketchup in the mix and left out the milk.
Brown sugar gives it a nice flavor.
Pretty decent meatloaf and will make again!

I enjoyed it, son and wife seemed to like it.  Daughter said too much sugar and she was right....   But I did some changes.  I made in muffin tins, with brown sugar and ketchup in the bottom.  Had to substitute all spice for ginger (google leads me).  I upped the pepper a bit and added garlic powder.   Cooked until neared 150° then add sauce made of brown sugar, ketchup, pepper, and garlic powder.  Will make again but discussion on lowering sugar is ongoing.

A big change:  why on earth would you put brown sugar at all?  And the recipe brags of "Healthier" ??  I don't get it.  Sorry.  The remainder of the recipe was ok.  I would add a few more seasonings the next time.  (more onion, and some garlic)

We thought this was very good and I liked that this was a healthier version, as I like to cook on the healthy side during the week! I did not put the brown sugar and ketchup on the bottom. I waited until about 10-15 minutes before it was done and put it on the top, which worked great. This had nice flavor and was very easy to make. I would make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

So delicious! I did 2 lbs of meat and 1 1/2ed all the other ingredients. Subbed dried parsley and did it in a mini loaf pan. Love how the ketchup/brown sugar mixture is on the bottom.

Husband approved :) I used oats/oatmeal instead of breadcrumbs. The only other change I made was I used A1 steak sauce instead of ketchup to give it a little kick. You know it turned out great when it is husband approved!

I made this for the first time tonight and my 10 year old who "will not!" eat any meat without an argument told me he loved it. The only changes I made, or additions I guess, where to add some minced garlic and I didn't have any whole wheat breadcrumbs so I used Italian breadcrumbs instead. I would definitely make it again.

Just made for new years Eve and it came out perfect!!  I used 2lbs.  meat and at 60 minutes it was temping just at 160 so I gave it an extra 20 to be safe.  I also omitted the Ginger and added a oregano and some Italian spice mix.  I used regular bread crumbs and only used 1 tsp. salt.. next time I'll add the other half.  the brown sugar added that perfect sweetness without being overly sweet... will be my go to meatloaf recipe!!!

I'm giving it 4 stars simply because I goofed up! I forgot to add the milk which made for a very dense meatloaf.  I added only 1/2 cup regular bread crumbs and put the ketchup/sugar mixture on top.  Also, I placed bread slices at the bottom of the loaf pan to absorb the fat, which I really liked.  The next time I make it I'll add only 1/2 cup milk or water because we like a denser, heavier meatloaf.  Also, didn't notice any ginger taste so will omit it next time.

I used ground turkey, otherwise everything was as indicated in the recipe.  It's a nice meatloaf which I found a little bland, though a friend who came to dinner raved about it.  For me it was better served warm or hot, and was okay when chilled for sandwiches, but not great.  Not sure I'd make it again.

I make this about twice a month and my grandparents and kids love it! I usually use ground turkey and most often use my blender to make crumbs out of a couple slices of whole wheat bread and use that. Delicious!

I absolutely loved this instead of lean beef I made  it with ground turkey, almond milk instead of low-fat milk, and substituted bread crumbs with wheat bread pieces a little garlic powder and onion powder, and I put the glaze (brown sugar and ketchup) on top. My husband went back for seconds within 30 minutes. It's almost gone and I just cooked it a couple hours ago, I will definitely make it again!

This recipe was actually pretty good.  I added some Italian spices and used parsley flakes'  Italian bread crumbs and  whole milk because that is what I have.  Otherwise I fallowed it to a T. I don't like putting the ketchup on the bottom...seemed to just get sucked up into the meat loaf and you couldn't taste it. However, I liked the brown sugar layer that baked in.  So in the future I think I will do the brown sugar on the bottom again, but wait on the ketchup.  Then after it's baked, put the ketchup on top and sprinkle with brown sugar.  I baked mine for 65 minutes at 350 degrees at almost 7,000feet elevation.  Overall, tasty and easy enough I would make it again!

Great recipe. Only thing I did different was use light cream instead of 2% and regular bread crumbs. Awesome with the ginger! Love Love Love!

I love this recipe! I've made it several times. I double it and form it in a loaf on a 9x13 so the grease can escape. It disappears fast!

This is a great recipe and we loved it! Instead of using a loaf pan, I molded the meatloaf and added the ketchup on top and sprinkled the brown sugar over it.

Delicious! I don't normally like meatloaf so this was a nice surprise. I did add garlic powder, paprika and some italian seasoning to the mix and I only had seasoned breadcrumbs on hand. The next day it was firm and not mushy. I will make this again!
