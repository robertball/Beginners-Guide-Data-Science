I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could. Just a touch sweet, and be sure to use a fairly fine cornmeal. Bob's Red Mill Coarse is a bit large.

My daughter's on a Low Oxalate Diet because of kidney stones and rye bread is allowed.  I've tried to find a recipe that works and this is the first one that didn't fall during baking.  I did make some changes first: no caraway seed - not on diet, cut out cornmeal and raised the bread flour the same amount.  I also didn't have any gluten to add so raising the bread flour helped cover that.  It was tasty and quite moist.

This bread is fantastic! Delicious! But, OOPS!, I didn't notice until after the fact that I had inadvertently left out the cornmeal. Fuhgeddaboudit! It doesn't need it. The only DELIBERATE change I made to the recipe was to cut the amount of yeast from two teaspoons down to one-and-a-half, and next time, I'm thinking of cutting it to one. (The one-and-a-half pound loaf comes out fairly high, and it just barely squeezes into my plastic bread storage bags.) Thanks to this recipe, I can have the rye bread I love (it's my favorite kind of bread) without the high fructose corn syrup -- and sodium I DON'T want. This recipe is a definite winner and a keeper! UPDATE TO MY ORIGINAL REVIEW: I figured out my too-high-loaf-won't-fit-in-bag problem. It wasn't too much YEAST, it was too much GLUTEN. I've cut the amount of vital wheat gluten in half (One tablespoon instead of two), and it's PERFECT! No more store-bought rye bread for me! This is my "go-to" rye bread from now on!

Had good flavor.

I made this on the French setting on my bread machine.  It fell before it baked.  The dough was too sticky, and the bread is REALLY sticky too.  I even added more flour than it called for.

I couldn't finish the loaf and it ended up in the trash.  I might try it one more time, in a mixer with more flour, but I'm not sure.

Yummy, true rye bread taste that I haven't found in any other breadmaker rye recipe I've tried so far.  I have a Zojirushi Mini Breadmaker (BB-HAC10) that bakes 1 pound loaves. I found that dividing in half all the ingredient amounts in this recipe results in the perfect quantities for my Zojirushi breadmaker. I baked it using the regular cycle, normal crust setting.  The only other change I made is to substitute dark corn syrup in place of the same quantity of honey, since I didn't have any honey on hand. This seemed to work great, and as a bonus for some people, turns this into a vegan recipe.  As I mentioned above, it tasted great, probably better than the best store-bought rye I've had. In terms of texture, it was light and fluffy - not dense like I would expect from a rye loaf. While I'm sure some people would prefer this light and fluffy texure, I'd like to see if I can get a denser loaf. I may try the recipe on the French bread setting next time to see what happens.  Thanks for posting this recipe, Wynn!

If you're expecting a dense rye loaf, this is not it. This is more like a light rye sandwich bread -- moist and light and smells wonderful while baking! My husband was so anxious to have some, he nearly got his hand sliced as I was cutting it! :-) The only change I made was to use vegetable oil because I was out of olive oil. I baked it on Light Crust and it turned out wonderfully.

Fabulous!  Great Flavor!  Didn't make a single change.  Used my Westbend bread maker on regular setting and it turned out perfectly.

Great heavy, dense loaf of bread!  I love the flavor!  I didn't need all of the bread flour called for, that would have been too much!  I'll be making this again!

I personally don't care for rye bread.  The taste of carraway=blech for me.  I made this loaf for my boyfriend (who adores it) and he is RAVING about it.  This is definitely on the list of breads to make again :).  He says 5 stars for this one!

This is good stuff. I've been baking and eating this delicious rye bread for several weeks. It has helped to stabilize my blood sugar. I substitute wheat flour for the corn meal because it makes the bread lighter.

I likes it. The only thing that I didn't like was that the corn meal made it dry when in the toaster. But all in all it was great for sandwiches

This bread is awesome.  I don't usually change a recipe but I really don't like caraway seeds so I did omit them. This is my new go to bread it holds up well for a sandwich. I like the cornmeal it gives it a nice texture.

Pretty good rye bread!  It's a tad dense, but not too heavy--I've eaten rye breads that are much heavier.  Extremely easy as well with the bread machine as a helper, although I didn't bake it in the bread machine--I did the dough cycle and baked in the oven for 40 min at 375.  Came out well.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe although I'm looking for some feedback on what setting I should have used for baking it in the machine.  What's the "normal" setting on the machine...white?  I used the French Bread setting but I was at a loss for what size loaf it should be - 1.0, 1.5 or 2.0?  Also what crust to use - tried medium.  Any advice out there?  Tastes great but it came out looking a little scary but that could be I didn't have the correct settings and I am going to try less of the vital wheat gluten as someone suggested.

The crust is a little harder than I prefer, but this bread is great!  My bread machine is small, so I halved the recipe and followed other reviews by omitting the cornmeal and instead using bread flour for the cornmeal.  I also omitted the wheat gluten.  It just finished cooking and I had a little to make sure I liked the taste before planning my lunch tomorrow.  So yummy!  My husband had a taste, too, and he said it makes him yearn for some Northern European food!  Thanks for the great, useful recipe!

Very good, very easy to make, but like a number of others, the dough fell when the heat started. Was hoping for a light, airy, soft rye but I have yet to find one. Made exactly as listed.

I really love this rye bread.  I followed the recipe exactly except I increased the caraway seeds to 1 tablespoon and salt to 1 1/2 teaspoons.  I used finely ground cornmeal as well.  I love how the cornmeal made a crispy, chewy crust.  I used the multi-grain setting on my bread machine and it turned out wonderful.  It was light and not heavy or dense at all.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a great recipe!  I have tried other rye bread recipes that were just so-so.  Since I had no honey, I used light corn syrup, omitted the corn meal and used a half cup more bread flour.  No wheat gluten on hand, either.  The results were amazing!  Next time I'll try the honey, or a dark corn syrup (would molasses work?).  And I didn't use dark rye flour either!  Improvise is my middle name...

Using a Breadman bread machine I could not get this bread to come out. It finished deformed both times I tried to make it and was too dense to enjoy. I followed the recipe but I'm sorry to say it never worked out for me.

This makes great sandwich bread and is also good with soup. I followed the recipe, except that I added an extra tsp of yeast and then did this on the quick cycle because I was short on time. I use regular rye flour and wish the flavor hadn't been quite so subtle. Perhaps dark rye flour would make the difference?

I know my bread maker, so I followed the recipe except I used a full Tsp of yeast.  What a beautiful loaf! What a great taste!  TY Uncle Wynn for an outstanding recipe.

I've made 100ish loaves of this recipe with both rye and whole wheat. Very reliable. Have settled on 2 1/2 teaspoons of molasses instead of honey.

I made this twice, following the instructions to the letter and although it tasted great, is comes out SUPER dense and like a brick.  I cannot get it anywhere near what normal rye bread is like.  I have no idea what I am doing wrong.

This is the first time I am reviewing a recipe but I felt the need to as this is soooo good. I have been looking for a rye bread recipe for a long time and made several, but never hit home a home run like this one has. I bought a Zojirushi Breadmaker a few years ago and I had to learn how to bake all over again because you don’t measure your ingredients but weigh them! I found that weighing my flour makes the best dough for rolls, pizza or bread. Using this recipe I did change a couple of things based on a couple of other reviewers.  I substituted wheat flour for the corn meal; I used molasses instead of honey, and added an additional ½ tsp of caraway seeds as my family likes the flavor it adds to the bread. I also used the basic setting with medium crust on my machine. It did look a little sticky when it first started mixing/kneading but I left it alone. It smelled heavenly while baking, and the light crisp crust it makes is wonderful. No more store bought Rye bread for us! This is definitely a keeper!

It was acceptable as bread goes, but didn't really have the taste and texture that I associate with rye bread.  The honey and cornmeal contributed too strongly to the taste so that the rye and caraway became practically unnoticeable.  I will look for a different rye bread recipe, and not continue to use this one.

Awesome recipe:)  Did not put in caraway seed and substituted cornmeal with Multi grain bread flour.

Was pretty good. I would bake it on a regular cycle next time because it was a little undercooked. Made great Ruben sandwiches and was good toasted with butter!!

Really, really good.  I increased the caraway to one tablespoon and used the dough cycle.  Baked in oven at 400 degrees for about 30 minutes.  (Checked with instant read thermometer for doneness -- 190 to 200 degrees)

My family liked this a lot.  I'm making another loaf right now.  It's great toasted with butter!  This is a recipe I'll make many more times.

The first time I made it, I was afraid the kids wouldn't like it.  I was watching them (6 & 8) to see how they would like it, and they ate it up saying 'mmm'.  It was not a super strong flavor...it was just right for us.  I made it just as stated (perhaps added an extra 1/2 T honey) and it turned out wonderful.  I used Hodgson Mill Rye flour.

Great rye bread! I substituted molasses for the honey and used instant yeast in place of active dry yeast. I also used a bit more rye flour and a bit less bread flour. I baked in the oven for 40 to 45 minutes at 375°. This recipe is a keeper!

We really enjoyed this bread!  I made it vegan by replacing the honey with maple syrup, and made it oil free by replacing with 2Tb warm water + 1/2Tb gr flax, and only had light rye flour.  The dome sunk just a little bit, not didn't affect the outcome!  Excellent recipe

I've made this without the cornmeal (don't like it) I've also made it without the caraway, cause I don't like the seeds, but those results simply tasted like wheat bread.  IMO, rye bread isn't rye without the caraway.  After research I discovered that even seedless rye bread is made with ground caraway, which you can grind yourself, or order online. So the anti seed people can try that, but for the other people that say they don't like caraway, I'm stymied as how they can categorise this , or any rye bread recipe as genuine rye bread. IMO, without caraway this just tastes like wheat bread, and I did use rye flour

This was my first time using a bread machine so I was intentionally looking for a recipe that seemed simple.  This is certainly that - I had the ingredients in the pan in no time and since it is my first bread I don't have any kind of basis of comparison but the bread came out very tasty.  I will certainly be making this again.

I found this bread pretty bland even hot with butter, maybe with a few tweaks it could be a good recipe.

Followed the recipe except no caraway seeds. I did use cornmeal that was finely grained.  Turned out perfect and my kids loved it. I can't wait to make this again!!!!

I don't have a bread machine, so I mixed it up in my Bosch, then kneed in the Bosch for 8 minutes.  Made it into one loaf then let it rise for about one hour. Cooked it at 350 for 25 minutes.

Very good - used molasses instead of honey because that is what I had and seemed more traditional.  Also didn't have any cornmeal so I used equal amounts of white and rye flour to make 1/2 cup.  Cut recipe to 8 servings to use in my zojurushi 1 lb. breadmaker on regular cycle.  Came out perfect.

This turned out wonderful. My wife let me buy a bread machine! So far, I have not done anything but the basic setting of the machine. That is easy, only one press of one button and great results. Anything more would require reading the instructions and that I will never do that! I used a mortar and pestle to partially grind up some roasted sunflower seeds instead of caraway seeds one time and just skipped the next time. I ground them to make them the same size as unwanted caraway seeds. This was great for sandwiches, sliced thin very easy with an antique quality knife. This bread was best for the first four days then got dry and crumbly so the second time, after the bread cooled, I put half in the freezer. That worked fine with my ancient Tupperware.

I made this recipe exactly as directed. Flavor and texture were excellent.  The top did sink a bit.  Next time I will use 2 T less water.

Turned out wonderful, even with quite a few changes.  I used Great River 7 Grain Bread flour, regular flour and the dark rye + corn meal.  I used a bit less sweetener, part molasses, and coconut oil instead of olive.... the rest as written except more gluten.  I used the french setting for my Westbend bread maker on medium crust and the loaf needed to bake a little longer.  I think next time I will use the low setting for crust and the full amount of sweetener.   Wonderful rye taste and denser because of the whole grains.  I am very pleased with this, it is much better than the other bread machine rye recipe I tried.  It will pair nicely with sandwiches and soup.
