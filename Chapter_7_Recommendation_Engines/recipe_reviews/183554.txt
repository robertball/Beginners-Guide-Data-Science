This was awesome!!!  My whole family loved it, even the picky little girls!  I didnt have any green onion, so I just left it out, and I didnt have any fresh parsley, so I used a little dried.  Will definately be making this again!!  Thanks for the recipe!!

This was my family's recipe...not a traditional jamabalaya but our comfort dish, we add a few splashes of soy sauce when served up in the bowl...don't know how that got started but it's our favorite way to eat this. Light in flavor and warm in the belly. This is a great dish when it's gloomy out side.

The whole family gave their thumbs up to this one!  Even though I used turkey smoked sausage to cut down on the fat, I still felt the dish had plenty of flavor.  The only think I might do differently next time is to add the parsley at the end.  It got a little dark and gummy during cooking.  Otherwise, very good.  It may not have the spiciness or the seafood in "real" jambalaya but that's just fine for my midwest palate.  I'm sure we'll be having this meal often.  Thanks for the recipe!

Im from La but this is the way i make my jambalaya, i dont like the tomatoe-y taste or big chunks (or small) in my food. i season all layers with Tonys and this is my perfect jamablaya.

My mom makes this more me. I love chicken and rice. She's a good cooker.I love smelling the onions and parsley and onion cooking. The best part I like is that I get to add in everything in before she puts the lid on it and we have to wait for the rice to get done. I like putting soy sauce on it too.

I added 1/2 cup celery & 1 Tb of Creole seasoning to the onion saute. I also used 2 cups of cooked, cubed chicken I had in my freezer. It's a good basic dish that I will make again. It really needs the Creole seasoning, 1 Tb won't make it spicy, just flavorful.

Great recipe, I took the idea and ran with it. I left out the chicken only b/c I didn't have any on hand. And I used orzo pasta instead of rice (4c. liquid to half a box of orzo absorbed nicely) It paired lovely. I also used dried parsley.  Great, I will be playing with the ingredients in the future. Nice canvas. Thanks.

We had this last night and it was really good!  I didn't have green onions or fresh parsley, so I used a large onion and used some dried parsley.  Also I threw in a red bell pepper because I had to use it up.  Very good!  At the end of the hour cooking time the bottom was a little brown, but the brown part was really tasty too.  I did cheat a little and put in some creole seasoning with the chicken.  Everyone loved it.  I will definitely be making this one again!

This is very yummy.  Hubby got some Hilshire farm smoked Italian flavored sausage on clearance and we made this with it, everyone ate it up - except my rice hating child (but he still ate it).  There's only a little bit left over and it's 2 adults and 4 kids (8,6,5,2), even my 2 year old had seconds.  Mine was done in 30 minutes and I did let some of the liquid evaporate off, rice was a little mushy but everytime I make a jambalaya-type dish the rice is mushy.  Thanks for the recipe mis7up

The title of this got my curiousity up.  I've never had "real" jambalaya so I have nothing to compare this to, so I don't care. :-)  The flavor was pretty good and it was interesting, but somehow the texture of the smoked sausage seemed a bit odd in this.  I can see from the pics it's supposed to be thick but I still had to add a fair amount of chicken broth.

I chose this recipe because I had the small smoked sausages and didn't know what to do with them. This is a great recipe, will definately cook again.

This was really tasty, much better than I expected. I didn't use chicken breasts (instead I only used chicken sausage) and I didn't have green onion or parsley. I threw in a handful of steak seasoning and it was very flavorful. I especially liked the texture of the rice and that this dish has a richness without having cheese or cream. I halved everything and it was done in 30 minutes. This was really easy to make and I will definitely make it again!

Basic recipe was good but I had to add more cajun spices because it was pretty bland otherwise.  After I tweeked the spice level this is a keeper!

This was good, but very bland. We all had to add salt, but definitely comfort food, very filling.
