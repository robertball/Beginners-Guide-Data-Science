I've made this before and it's very good.  I find that instead of sprinkling the 1 tsp of seasoning into the cavity, it's easier to put it inside the beer.  Also I use an aluminum pie plate large enough to hold the beer can and chicken.  This catches all the drippings and reduces flare-ups.  I've also made this recipe using a spice called Montreal Chicken Seasoning.

There's nothing quite like Beer Can Chicken! I made another recipe on this site a while ago and have been making these every summer. Since there's never a shortage of beer in this house or neighbor's to help us eat these birds we always love to make these. I made three of these last night for a BBQ! Two I made with regular paprika and one I made with smoked paprika and I added a couple teaspoons of garlic powder to all three.  It's much easier to take the seasoning mixture and blend it with 1 cup of melted butter and place half of it into the beer can and baste the chicken with the other half. (I bascially had to triple the butter/seasoning for the BBQ).  Invest in the holder that you can purchase at Wal-Mart or Bed, Bath, & Beyond, you'll be glad you did!

Excellent. I've done this a bunch of times before reading this recipie. We call them Beer Butt Chickens where i come from. One tip though - before putting the chicken over the can, make sure there's about 2 mouthfuls gone from the can. Some times the beer can splash up and it can get a bit messy. The type of beer also makes a difference - you can play around with differnt kinds.

Made beer butt chicken for years. Get the holder, it makes things much easier. Usually I make a butter baste, but really like this rub. Made a couple little changes--a TBL of butter  in the beer and garlic salt for the salt. I plug the neck with a small potato (carrot or apple would work) to keep steam inside and placed the 4.5 lb. bird on a soaked plank (keeps heat indirect while imparting smoke aroma/taste) and cooked at 325°. Good eatin'.

Tastes great and was fun to make. The only thing I did to improve it was to stuff a whole onion in the neck-hole to keep the steam in.

This recipe is fantastic.  I added garlic powder and season salt to the rub mix.  Cooked on indirect heat, there were no flare ups and the result was a fall-off-the-bone chicken that was just awesome.  I plan to make this often during the grilling season here in CT.

This is my favorite way to do chicken.  Put it on the grill during pregame and take it off at halftime.  You really don't need to check it.  The hardest part is  keeping people from opening the grill to see what is smelling so good.  Experiment with different beers and rubs.  Indirect heat is the key. Oh, one more thing all the pictures have the wings just sticking out,  I like to tuck the tips behind the breast, it keeps them from getting overcooked.  Save me a leg!!

Great recipe.  I used Cornish hens and baked them in the oven.  I covered them in foil for and hour then removed the foil and finished baking.  As far as the can, I used small tomato paste cans.

No beer, no problem!  Sub any canned soft drink or even chicken broth for the beer.  We used diet cola.  Be sure to pour out (or drink) about 1/4 cup of the liquid to prevent spills or running over.  I omitted the chili powder and added some cayenne pepper and ground sage.  We didn't have a beer can chicken stand, so I stood the chicken and can in an aluminum pie pan.  I also recommend that you rotate the chicken every 20 minutes or so.  Thanks for sharing!

Very good. 

This was my first attempt and I pretty much followed the recipe with the exception of adding a little bit of garlic powder to the dry rub and brushing the chicken with olive oil prior to coating it with the rub.

I put the 4.5lb chicken (with can and stand) on a small baking pan to catch the drippings (and prevent fare ups) and turned it about avery 20 minutes. I kept the heat at a constant 375 for 75 minutes and checked doneness with a meat thermomater . The skin was nice and crispy and the meat was very moist.

Wouldn't change a thing. Give it a shot. I posted a pic of the final result.

Good, but for all the spices/seasonings I didn't think the chicken itself took on alot of the rubs flavor.  And yes, I did put some spices in with the beer - next time will try to put some of the spices between the skin & meat.

We used a larger roaster chicken so it took longer, but WOW, YUMMY!  I chose to use Guinness for the beer.

Wow... what a fantastic recipe!! So good and just absolutely melts in your mouth.  I did alter the recipe just a touch and took some of the other reviews into consideration.  I basted my chicken about every 15 minutes or so in some of the extra spice mixture mixed with a little butter and the other half of the beer.  I also added some garlic to the spice rub and as one of the other reviews I closed the neck opening with an onion.This will definitely be one of my favorite grilling recipes this summer and probably all year long!

A very good recipe.  I used a 6lbs bird and grilled over indirect heat for 1h 20min.  The grill was on low on the bird side and high on the empty side.  The result was a perfectly moist bird.  Next time I will try to increase the flavor which was good but too subtle.

This turned out very well.  So juicy and delicous.  I added some seasoning to the beer and lemon juice. I also put a lemon slice into the neck to seal in the juices.  It really adds a flavor to the meat.

I tried beer can chicken for the first time on father's day, but my plans to do it on the grill were disrupted by a storm. I baked it in the oven, but it didn't have the smoky flavor I'd been hoping for. I used a commercial rub and white wine instead of beer. The chicken was very tender except for the top parts of the breast, which were too close to the electrical heating element in my oven. I'm hoping this review becomes 5 stars when I have a chance to try it on the grill.

Great recipe! I tweeked mine based on what I had. I used 1 TBS Sambal hot sauce instead of the chili powder - but would add the extra TBS next time. I also put a TBS of minced garlic in. Put it in the oven on 325 using a stand - for $10 its a must have!

Perfectly moist and delicious!  We used a 24 oz. can of beer (poured out half) because it stood easier on the grill.  We took the temp to 180 in the drumsticks which was about 165 in the rest of the chicken then pulled it off the grill, covered with foil and let it rest for awhile before slicing and serving.  This one is a keeper- thanks!

I had the bbq on low, and the skin of the chicken burnt to a crisp. The chicken was dry cause the beer did not evaporate into the chicken to make it moist.

What a great way to grill chicken! I was lucky enough to get a deal on organic chickens, buy one, get one free! I followed the recipe exactly, they finished with a flavorful crispy skin and the meat was moist and juicy. My birds were 4 lbs. each and took about and hour and 45 min. over medium heat. I did have some problems with flare up even though my chickens were over a burner that was turned off. Next time I will lay a piece of foil underneath the chickens.

This is such a terrific recipe we made this chicken twice in one week! The sugar carmelizes on the grill and helps the skin to crisp up. The dry rub is perfect on a whole chicken as well as on regular chicken breasts.  I make extra now and keep it on hand.

Followed recipe to the tee.    The chicken was moist but both the wife and I found that it lacked flavor big time.   For whatever reason spices just didn't seem to get into the meat itself.   Not a keeper in my book.

this is my first bad rating of a recipe. The rub was just so terrible that I had to remove all the skin and any trace of it before eating it. Sorry but this was not for us.

Really liked this chicken. Turned out moist and flavorful. Did place the chicken on an old metal pie plate after putting on the beer can. Looks like the picture!

Cooked the chicken in oven and it was wonderful.  Used 6lb chicken and doubled on the ingredient list, even used cheap beer!  Fed 5 with leftovers.

I made this and I was unimpressed to be honest. It was moist, but really lacking in flavor.  I used the recipe exactly as it was given.

This recipe left my chicken really moist, but there wasn't a lot of flavor in the meat.  The skin wasn't that great either.

Take some seasoning and mix with soften some butter and then stuff under the skin and well as all over the outside.

Absolutely delicious.  I have made this several times and it is always a hit.  I do add a little garlic and onion powder to the mixture but we add garlic and onion to everything in our house!

The chicken tasted great, I would recommend rubbing the seasoning under the skin of the chicken because if your like me your grill will probably shoot up some flames and blacken the outside of your chicken, so we didn't get to enjoy eating the skin.  Probably only cooked mine 50 min and it turned out perfect on the inside, very juicy and the whole family loved it!

This is an easy and fool proof way to cook chicken!  Before seasoning the outside of the chicken, I always brush olive oil on the skin, then liberally shake on salt, pepper and seasoning salt (Johnny's Seasoning Salt w/o MSG).  Once you put the bird on top of the beer can/stand, make sure you tie string around chicken to keep the wings down and insert a bunched up piece of foil in the neck cavity so the heat doesn't escape during cooking.  That's it!  This way of cooking chicken gives you moist chicken every time!  One of our favorite ways to cook chicken on the grill!

Well we finally, or I should say my husband finally made this. I really thought it was probably just a bunch of hype that some drunk BBQ guy came up with....but wow was this chicken so moist! The rub gave a really great flavor, a bit sweet and not too spicy, but he did say he only used one tablespoon of chili powder. It makes a lot of rub since our chicken was 5 1/2 lbs. and we have enough leftover for another chicken. We saved it though for future use. Thanks Hunter's mom.

My husband thinks this rub is one of the best he has tasted on a beer can chicken! Slightly sweet, slightly spicy - the only thing I add is a bit of onion powder, maybe 1 tablespoon. We use a beer can chicken holder which I put wedges of onion on - the juices run off the chicken and flavor the onions, which accompany the chicken well. Delicious - thank you very much for the recipe!

This chicken was moist for sure. I followed many of the tips, but I have to say that we found the flavor lacking. I even injected some seasoned (S&P) chicken broth into it and added onion powder, garlic powder, dried parsley, and oregano; along with adding wood chips! Perhaps the chicken would have done better if I put the spice rub under the skin. I might also try letting the chicken soak 8+ hrs in some seasoned salt water to let it permeate the meat better. Finally, be careful about the size of your chicken. My 5.5 lb bird was pushing up the top of my Weber grill.

This is a great recipe! I tweaked it a little. I added a few diced fresh basil leaves, and I used full flavored Coors beer. I feel it adds much better flavor than any light  beers. Other than that, it was so juicy and tender. Yummmmm!

Fantastic!  We've wanted to make a beer can chicken for some time now and this was great!  I did use half chipotle chili powder and half smoked spanish paprika along with both the regular chili powder and regular paprika.  Very moist and flavourful, yummy!

I made a few changes based on what I had.  I rubbed dijon mustard all over the chicken first.  Then I added the dry indregiants on top.  I didn't have chili powder but added some red pepper flakes.  My chicken was almost 4 lbs and I put it on a stand with the beer can.  The reason I don't have this as a 5 star was that the beer didn't seem to add anything.  It was easy to make and I cooked it on my grill on indirect heat at 350 for a little over an hour.  For that reason, it's easier to me that cleaning out a grill pan.  Maybe I need a different beer since mine was a Coors Light.  I bet a Guinness would be good!

The rub for this chicken is out of this world....totally the bomb!! I grilled mine, and the first time did not put it in a pie pan and instead put it directly on the grill with indirect heat, and the poor thing was immolated! The next time I put it into a pie dish, monitored the heat on the grill a little more closely and it came out perfectly. Everybody was moaning on their first bite. Seriously.

Definently make again. This makes enough rub for 2 chickens. Make sure to completely pat dry the chicken. I lightly sprayed “Pam” (it was olive oil in a spray can) on the chicken and then sprinkled the rub on it. It stuck waaaay more uniformly and wasn’t clumpy like it was the first few times I tried this. 
Have made this many times on a gas grill and charcoal. Once did 5 on my offset smoker, just make sure to increase the time and rotate the ‘chicks around periodically.  Was a huge success and crowd pleaser.

Most definitely will make again! The chicken turned out super moist! A big hit with the family! I rubbed the chicken after it had reached the halfway mark to prevent the outside spices from burning... in the past when I would do this I put the spices on at the beginning and the spices burnt, not the chicken mind you just the spices

Loved this recipe. We had the beer can stand and decided to try it after having the stand sitting in the drawer for years.  I didn't change much but added some garlic salt to the rub, made sure it was rubbed below and above the skin, and dumped the extra rub into the beer can.  The skin was charred pretty bad, but the chicken fell off of the bones.  On the package for the stand, it recommends setting it on a pie plate with 1/4" of water in it, so I did that.  It was moist and tasty. We will definitely make it again since it was so easy to just let it sit on the grill without a lot of work after initial prep.

Great except that my grill never takes the amount of time called for in the recipe. I usually end up covering it with foil after about 30 minutes to keep the skin from burning and remove it from the grill after 45-55 minutes.

This is such an easy recipe to prepare. My husband cooked it on the Big Green Egg and it was moist and tender. The flavor is good enough to use leftover chicken in just about any dish, too.

Very tender chicken.   I didn't care for the rub, but my husband and mother-in-law said it was delicious.  Next time I may try my own rub mixture.  It was the first time I've tried Beer Can Chicken and it won't be the last.  Thank you Hunter's Mom 2008!

Sadly, I followed the directions to the note, but when I checked on my chicken at the hour mark, it was charred beyond repair. I had the burners on medium heat, maybe I should have only used 2 of them, I don't know. I had the chicken on a roasting pan to prevent the drippings from igniting. :-(

I think this would be a 4.5 rating. A 5 rating is only for the absolutely amazing meals.  Our family rating gave our whole meal a 9 rating. We made 2 chickens. One on the grill and one in the smoker. I doubled the ingredients and then added it to 2 sticks of melted butter.  I added some cumin, garlic powder, onion powder and a combination of smoked paprika and regular paprika. It was hard to get off my fingers and on to the chicken the whole way. I tried to get it under the skin as much as I could too. I also added the seasoning butter mixture to the beer can.  The smoked chicken was more moist and maybe took a tad longer.  But all and all we all loved the flavor. Served it with Mexican corn on the cob and a green salad. Excellent Sunday night summer meal.

I did take some advice and added seasoning to the 1/2 can of beer.  I placed a small onion in the top of the chicken.  I placed the chicken in an aluminum pie plate on the grill.   I used indirect heat maintaining a constant temperature of 400 degrees.  I wished I seasoned under the skin for even more flavor.  I used a large organic chicken.   It was so moist !   Would like ideas of different rubs but did enjoy the taste of this one as well.  We did add garlic powder to the rub as well.

I have know about this trick and using that can stand helps stabilize the can. You can use any can even a soda can as long as the can is half full. Sweet soda, beer or broth, it doesn't matter, the can is to keep the chicken upright so all of it cooks and browns the same and the liquid steams the inside to see it moist.

Don't need quite so much beer; 1/3 to 1/2 can is enough -- more for the cook.:) Very moist - nice.

Been making Beer Can Chicken for close to 20 years now and it is still the most tender, moist, flavorful grilled chicken you can eat. Try it with your favorite seasonings including garlic and lemon pepper before your bbq seasonings. It was one of my mother's favorites. YUM to the tastebuds every time!!!

I've made these for years.  I use a full size Weber Charcoal Grill and bank my hot coals around the outside of the grill base and leave the center of the grill open without coals.   Add a couple of lumps of hickory or apple wood against the  hot coals.  I find cooking two birds at a time and facing the breasts against one another gives greater stability of the chickens to remain upright without having to use any stands.   Stands can make the chickens too tall to allow the lid to fully close.   I also cut a lemon in half crosswise and place 1/2 of lemon on top of each beer can before inserting into the bird  to seal the top of the bird from losing moisture through the neck opening.  i start with one cold and one hot can of beer, open and drink the cold beer, retain empty can and pour half of the hot beer in the empty can.  When you pull the hot can of beer from the cavity, a great deal of liquid will pour from the cavity because it has been forced into the meat by evaporation.    I find using heavy rubber gloves the best way to extract the can of hot beer from the cavity when the birds are done without getting burned.   Also handy to use the gloves while dismantling  the chickens and carving the chicken breasts across the breasts to create neat chicken breast medallions.  I also use heavy kitchen scissors to remove the back bone, separate the legs, thighs and wings from the cavity.  Then use a boning knife to cut the breasts one at a time from the sternum and rib cage.

I've made beer can chicken many times before trying different recipes and they've been good. But for some reason this was different in a good way. It was out standing.  The only thing I added was I melted a half stick of butter and mixed it with the rub and rubbed it all over inside and out. Skin turned out nice and crisp.

I find it has a lot more flavor if you put the rub seasonings under the skin rather than on the outside of the chicken.  It holds the spices better, gets right into the meat and makes a delicious chicken.  If you put a good amount of spices under the skin, you won’t need to add it to the beer or even the cavity.  I’ve made beer can chicken many different ways and found this to be the tastiest and moistest way to prepare it.

I didn't give this the full five stars because I didn't use the seasonings listed above. BUT.....I wanted to post a suggestion here for those that may not always have ALL the seasonings on hand that it listed. We've been doing the "BEER-BUTT-BIRD" for years and it's one of our  ABSOLUTE favorites for grilling every summer. We have a STAND that we got years ago when they first came out and I have to agree with the others about checking into one. A few years ago we started just using the CHICKEN SEASONING from SAV-A-LOT made by MARCUM. (the store brand name for all their spices) We've started using it on TONS of things. ANYWAY....sorry....not trying to "market" this seasoning. BUT......it's AMAZING on everything. It has sage in it and smells like THANKSGIVING just by opening the bottle. ABSOLUTELY LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the ideas I read from a few other posters here about only using a partial can (we always use a full can), AND about adding a little of the spice into the beer, as well as plugging the neck with a little potato or onion!!! AND.....loved the comment about doing this same thing with Cornish hens and using small tomato paste cans for the beer. THIS WILL BE FABULOUS FOR THE WINTER MONTHS WHEN GRILLING ISN'T AN OPTION!!!! Can't wait to try out these new ideas. Thanks y'all!!!!! OH....and for those that mentioned not being able to taste the beer flavor......actually, I think the beer, with the hops and barley and whey just mostly help to "steam" the moisture into the bird.

Great recipe!  You do not need any fancy beer can stands. The beer can and the chicken kegs resting in some folded tinfoil certainly do the trick without the daunting task of cleaning other stands.

This is okay. I like different spices, but this makes a chicken that is just fine. Nobody is going to turn it down. But they won't write home about it either. However, it omits two crucial steps that take place right at the beginning. The first two steps should be... 
1) OPEN A CAN OF YOUR FAVORITE BEER .
2) DRINK HALF!  (;o)

FANTASTIC!  I made this on my Traeger for Father's day - amazingly moist- like  rotesserie chicken but 100% better!  Highly recommend purchasing a chicken "throne" - which holds the beer can and chicken in place!

I’m not sure how this recipe has any good reviews. I did not try it, but I’ll tell you right now 1/2 tsp of salt is not nearly enough for a whole chicken. Also, when doing a dry rub on any meat you don’t want to do it right before you cook it. Put the rub on the meat at least a couple hours prior to cooking for the meat to absorb the flavors.

This was my first  time making this.  It came out  tender and Juicy.  I did have to modify the  spice rub.  No way would I use  2 TBS of Chile Power,  too hot. I used 2 TBS of Kicken Chicken  rub and I used 1 TSP of Chilie powder.  Had a good flavor.  The breast was moist and tender.

Has been awhile since I made beer can chicken and was looking to this recipe for additional techniques. I made this one Michigander style which is based on a recipe for turkey on Allrecipes. Butter under the skin, seasoned salt inside and out. Placed over my 'custom' stainless steel beer can half full of water and charged with whole garlic cloves. Remove when thigh reaches ~160°F. Skin is crisp and meat is tender and most.

The chicken itself was super moist and cooked perfectly. Unfortunately even with all of the seasoning in the rub it didn’t really flavor the meat and I found myself adding salt & pepper after carving so it wasn’t so bland. I love the method and I think experimenting with the seasonings is necessary to find what works for you so I’ll definitely give it another try =)

I make this chicken often in the summer on the grill.  Also can be done in oven during cold winter days.

I followed this to the letter. The one except was I stuffed onion slices in the cavity followed by the beer. so the chicken was super juicy. even if I did get the grill a little hotter than needed but it was raining and I just wasn't as attentive. I gave it a 3 stars because it was juicy. it needed way more salt, the paprika was good, brown sugar, good but screams for more flavor. very very bland. AND that was after me stuffing onion in the cavity.

I recently bought a beer can chicken rack and wanted to try it. Seasoned chicken per recipe and cooked in a Traeger. Turned out moist and flavorful, much better than a Costco rotisserie chicken.

This was a great recipe and I'll definitely make it again. I made some changes I put McCormick chicken spice on it , some garlic, onion powder, McCormick chipotle spice, McCormick brown sugar spice, too. Along with the recipe directions. I also poured  some beer in the bottom of the pan while that helped the pan from getting burnt so much and kept the chicken moist. I cooked mine at 450degrees  for an hour and half. Thanks again for the most moist chicken ever!!!

I used just about a tablespoon of brown sugar which gave it a good flavour and colour. I had made it before with the full amount and found it was too sweet and the skin burned because of the sugar content. The chicken was cooked in one hour and was delicious, moist and tender.

You basically can't go wrong with a beer can chicken unless you overcook it . Personally I add some of the spice and melted butter into the warm beer let it meld. Strain some of it and inject it into the bird all over. Yep that brings it to a new level.

Never use a can of beer for beer can chicken. Always use a bottle instead. The aluminum in the can cooks into the chicken. Instead, take a bottle of beer and scrub the label off of it and use that instead. I always use a full bottle and not a half. Also, the cook time is off a little. Should be around 2 hours.  I have done beer can chicken multiple times before and always use glass. 

Note: I have been cooking professionally for 17 years and have a culinary degree/ actual chef experience.

This turned out wonderfully flavorful.  I was a bit skeptical about the brown sugar as I thought it sounded too sweet for chicken, but it was perfect.  The sugar does make the skin brown a bit too quickly for the side nearest the heat source, so next time I will put the breast portion away from the heat and the back towards the heat.  I now have two wonderful beer can chicken recipes from this site.  Peruvian Beer Can chicken is also great.

This chicken was absolutely delicious! it was very moist and the rub made the skin taste wonderful!  After  took the chicken off the grill and let it rest I used the juice to heat and flavor some rice that I made the night before. Yes I will make this again!

Used a partial can of Gosling's Ginger Beer. Also, I'd recommend cutting the spice rub in half as I had plenty left over.

I've made this many times over the past 18 years. But I don't always use beer. I've used Diet  Coke; Coke; Root Beer; orange soda w/ an orange marmalade rub and an orange to cap the neck;  7-Up with a cherry jelly rub and an apple to cap the neck. Play with your flavors to get what you want.  And for veggies, I grab a handful of what's in the drawer, wash and seal in foil with a  little oil. On the grille until tender and it's fantastic meal.

Did not make changes to ingredients but use indirect heat on BBQ no need for a pie plate, chicken just sits on can with legs to stand up.  Have not made this is 15 or more years, better than ever now, have made it twice this summer.  Is a staple for the BBQ now.  :-)

Some times I use a half can of Ginger Ale as some of my family don't want acholol. I add a couple of cloves of Garlic in the ale. I also make melted butter with dill, Ginger  and tumuric and inject this under the skin. With a light dry rub on the skin. But I do like to use t hy e beer when I can.

Good recipe especially with the dry rub.  It is extremely important not only that you pat the the chicken, but it needs to be at room temperature before you apply the rub. It will stick and infuse more effectively. I added a mashup of pork sausage, celery and onions as a sort of stuffing in the cavity which added some great flavour and juiciness to the meat.

Excellent.  Only beer in house was Bud Lime.  Got lucky.  The hint of lime made this dish perfect.
