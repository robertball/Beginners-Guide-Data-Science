This was just like the restaurant's peanut cucumber salad that I always order.  The only difference is that they also serve it with some shredded carrots and chopped red onion which I added.  It's more sweet then spicy so if you want a little more zing then sweet, I suggest that you add an extra jalapeno and cut the sugar by 1/3.  I will definitely make this again.

This was tasty. I made this in advance and the cucumber shed all the water so it really had  a lot of liquid in it. next time I'll remember to assemble it shortly before I eat it.

I recently helped my date make this salad for dinner and it turned out amazing.  The salad is very easy to make and the flavors are very refreshing.  If you’re looking for a simple salad give this one a try and you won’t be disappointed.

Being 100% thai and eating real home cooked Thai food at home and in Thailand this recipe is pretty accurate how ever instead of jalapeño peppers try dry Thai chili flakes or if you don't have it or you can't find it use regular red pepper flakes. other than tastes just like my moms.

I have no regrets for trying this, but I don't plan on making it again.  Even cutting back on the sugar (I used Splenda) and vinegar this was still a little too sweet and tangy for me. The peanuts didn't appeal to me, so I omitted them, and I do admit that may have compromised the ultimate intent of this recipe both in flavor as well as contrasts in textures.  Still, it's a good salad we had no problem eating, and I liked the additions of the cilantro and jalapeno, which not only pepped the flavor up, but made this a very pretty salad as well.

I've made this few times already.  This salad was delicious and it did taste like something from a Thai restaurant.  First time I made this, I only used 1 cucumber so I used 1/8 cup each of sugar and vinegar.  Then I made with 2 cucmbers with 1/4 cup each of sugar and vinegar and both time came out great.  I think the taste settles and is better if you could wait 15-30 minutes before serving.  But not too long!  I took some left over for lunch to see if this can be my next pot luck dish but unless you like very soft cumcumber, it wasn't good as fresh crunchy one...  I guess I have to separate the cucumbers and the dressing until the last minute or I might keep the cucumber skin on and see how it holds.  Anyways, it was delicious!

This wasn't bad but I wasn't completely satisfied (I'd probably give it a 4.5 if that was an option). I think it might be helpful for the cucumbers to be sliced into strips in order for the flavor of the cucumber to be infused with the strong cilantro-vinegar dressing. Also, it's crucial to use fresh jalapenos - the canned ones just won't cut it. We actually ate this with turkey tacos and they were good!

This was very good!  The mix of flavors was wonderful.  We really liked the cilantro and jalapeno in this.  Great way to use up home grown cukes!  Thanks for sharing.

Enjoyed this easy salad which could be served as a side dish or on its own for lunch.  Added some red onion slices for color, served on lettuce leaves with a squeeze of lime.  I didn't measure the salt, and I think I may have added too much because even after rinsing really well and patting dry, the cukes still were pretty salty.  My bad, I guess.

Very good. I didn't have any jalaoenos so I used crushed red pepper as a substitute. It probably altered the flavor a bit but the salad still had enough kick. I also used crunchy peanut butter instead of regular peanuts. It gave it an interesting addition to the mix of textures in this salad. It was very refreshing.

Excellent and easy.  I used red jalapenos to add a little color.  Not hot at all.  Delicious and light.

Oh my goodness was this ever good. I took one taste and didn't want to eat anything else for dinner. I looked in the cupboard and we were out of peanuts so I substituted a little peanut butter for flavor and some toasted unsalted sunflower seed in their place for the crunch. Also, we were out of rice vinegar so I substitued apple cider - but I think the rice would make it even better. Put a touch of ginger in it as well. Thanks for the recipe - it made our day.

This salad is so delicious and refreshing! The perfect combination of textures and flavors--crispy, sweet, sour, salty, spicy, crunchy. And so easy to prepare. We especially love this in the summer with fresh cucumbers and Thai chiles (instead of jalapenos) from the garden!

I read this Tuesday when it was one of the featured recipes of the day, and knew I HAD to make it that night.   It was AWESOME!!!.  I scaled it to two; casued thats all the cumcumers I had (althought I did keep the full amount of peppers and cilrento cause we love both).  I sprinkled cumcumbers with salt, did not wait and just iadded everything else (a little less sugar), set in fridge while cooking my empanada's (about 10 minutes) and served. I wished I had more cucumbers, it was just delicious; and it was only two of us for two cumcumbers and we ate it all.  Will use often, and next time throw in some tomatoes.  SO Good and a MUST Try.

The dressing is amazing!!  I don't really care for cucumbers all that much but my friend brought some over for me so I decided to give this a try.  I absolutely fell in love with the dressing...taste just like a dressing from one of my fave restaurants.  Now I skip the cucumbers and use it on my salads!!  So much flavor!  Yummy!

Used a fresh red Thai chili, sliced into very thin strips, rather than the jalapeno. Beware: waiting a day makes this salad a lot hotter! Very tasty as is, but a squirt of fresh lime adds a nice zing.

A delicious, forgiving recipe.  No rice wine vinegar?  Use regular.  Don't like it too sweet?  Use a little less sugar.  Like it spicy?  Use an extra pepper or leave in the seeds and membrane.  But don't leave out the cilantro.  Will make this again -- and again!

My all time favorite salad!  The sweet tang, cilantro, peanuts - delish!  I don't salt and let the cucumbers sit for the 30 mins.  I can't wait that long.  I mix the sugar, salt and vinegar together and just pour it on.

Let's just say hypothetically someone were to forget to seed their 2 jalapenos and made this recipe....There is a reason those need to be seeded! Just sayin'! Don't ask how I know this.

Round 2- delish. I added 2T peanut butter to the dressing though because I was out of peanuts. Wonderful. (I remembered to seed the jalapenos this time.)

I have never left a review before, but the outcome of this recipe was so awesome. I absolutely Loved this salad. I was a bit skeptical at first, but am glad I made it. I did cut back a little on the sugar, added a little crushed red pepper flakes, removed the seeds & sliced the cucumber as the picture shows as other reviewers had suggested. I also used chopped cashews instead of regular peanuts which I think was a great idea because it gave it an awesome taste & texture. My hubby loved it & hardly took a breath in between bites, lol. It is definitely restaurant quality. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe

This is amazing!  The cilantro really makes it.  I made a few changes, which made it even better.  I used an extra 1/4 cup of the rice vinegar to cut the sweetness, added thinly sliced onion and red pepper flakes for a bit of a kick instead of the jalapeno. I also used 3 large English cucumbers instead of standard ones so I didn't have to seed or peel them.  I have to be careful or I'll eat the entire thing and leave nothing for the family :)

I recommend adding some carrot sticks and mung bean sprouts for variety.  Also I had some leftovers and found that the cucumbers did not keep well in the refrigerator.  If you plan to have extra just save the dressing and add extra cucumber the next day.

Wow, Wow, Wow!  What an absolutely delightful and tasty variation for cucumber salad. I wasn't sure whether to use light or dark sesame oil, so I used half of each.  I also doubled up on the green onion.  Only other change for me is that I would double or perhaps even triple the recipe next time.  Already planning the next batch.  Thank you for sharing this "keeper" recipe.

Delicious!  I would have given a 4.5 if possible.  The only reason I gave lower than a 5 is because I changed it quite a bit by adding in radish, onion and used red wine vinegar.  I also, unfortunately, didn't use peanuts since I had none in the pantry.  Great salad for a summer evening with fresh garden cucumbers!

Have an abundance of cucumbers this summer...and decided on this salad.  It was simply delicious!  I took the advice of those who said to cut back on the sugar.  I cut it to 1/3 cup. I also added 1/2 thinly sliced sweet onion. And, I used cashews since I had those on hand.  I liked the cashews, but am eager to try with the peanuts too.  You won't be disappointed.

way way way too much dressing, but still yummy after I poured a ton off.  Next time I'll use 1/4c sugar and a 1/4c vinegar for 3 large cucumbers and tweak it from there.

Since the sugar and vinegar ratio is the same, the dressing is very sweet.  I added enough sugar to suit my taste. I skipped the draining part in favor of lightly salting the cucumbers.  I also added about a 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder to the dressing. I let mine sit in the fridge for a couple of hours before serving.  They were delicious. I served as a side salad with the Kalua 
Pig in Slow Cooker recipe from this site. A very good combination.

I cut back on the sugar quite a bit (halved) and would not add any more sugar than that going forward. I like sweet things, but prefer this salad tangy-er.

This was absolutely wonderful.  I love it!  I have never had Thai Cucumber Salad, but it sounded so good and I was craving cucumbers.  I even forgot to drain the cucumbers and it was still so delicious.  I added 1/2 of a thinly sliced red onion and a handful of fresh dill weed like some others suggested and I used 3 small jalepeno peppers, sliced very thin.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

I have made this probably 10 times in the last month.  We LOVE it.  I use splenda to cut calories.  I leave the jalapenos out- they just don't do anything for this.  I add chopped red onion and use lots of cilantro.  We just sprinkle a few peanuts on each serving when we are ready to eat.  Cocktail peanuts are also a must!

So delicious and easy to make! Make a little extra of the liquid mixture to use as a marinade or dressing at another time.  I didn't have any peanuts on hand so I used some natural peanut butter and sesame oil to get that flavor, and some chopped walnuts to get the crunchy effect. Highly recommend!!! Also, make sure you seed the cukes!

Pretty good. At first bite, I was  unsure but the more bites I took, the more I liked it.  I only put 1 jalapeno in because my family doesn't like spicy but I think I could have done both and been ok.

I think I mis-measured the sugar so it wasn't sweet enough for me. My fault- if not I'll add a little more in the future.

The family loved it- though! I will make it again- does taste like it's from a Thai restaurant. It also tastes better the next day when the flavors have had a chance to meld.
Thanks for sharing- it's a keeper.

This salad is great.  It's a must with Thai or Indian food.  I prefer to use only 1/3 cup sugar. I always add chopped onion and sometimes omit the jalapeno depending on who I'm serving it to. Also, I skip the first step, I just throw it all together and add about 1 tsp of salt instead of 1 Tbls. I like to use the dry roasted peanuts.

I lived in Thailand for 6 years and now I struggle to find food that has just the right taste that I am looking for. This was very authentic and delicious. I made a few changes to suit my preferences- doubled the jalapeno, used slightly less sugar and added thinly sliced carrots and red onion.  I will definitely be making this again.

I usually do not leave ratings , but I had to for this one.  Super easy and amazing flavor with the combination of ingredients.  I used less sugar (1/2) for personal preference.  My husband said he could eat this for breakfast,lunch and dinner.  Thanks for the recipe.

I halved the sugar in this recipe, as we don't have such a sweet tooth as most people. It was absolutely fabulous. I will be making it frequently, and the pot luck idea is awesome.

Oh my gosh!  Loved this but it did take some effort and seeding the cukes made a mess but I guess it was worth it because I've made it several times now. Extra cilantro, extra jalapenos.  I just go by feel at this point but keep the dressing pretty much to the recipe.  Try it!

I leave out the cilantro and peppers, and  add the juice and grated zest of a lime (sometimes 2). I bring the sugar and vinegar to a boil before adding the lime. Very refreshing and good. Using a grapefruit spoon is the best way I've found to seed a cucumber.

We absolutely love this salad! I used Stevia instead of sugar, so I only used 1/2 a tablespoon. It turned out to be just perfect for my family. Wonderful cool summer salad!

I tried it and used half the sugar. It tasted like candy.  I will make it again without sugar and add some onion to it.  The cilantro and peanuts is an interesting touch.

I really thought I was going to love this, but it was just ok. I didn't have a jalapeno, so I added some crushed red pepper flakes. Other than that I stuck to the recipe. I probably won't make it again, but thanks for the recipe.

So good! Just like what you'd get in a restaurant. I didn't have any rice wine vinegar on hand, so decided to wing it & substitute white vinegar & just cross my fingers. It worked! Since you seed the jalapenos, there isn't much heat that comes from them. I added about a 1/4 teaspoon of red chili sauce to add a little heat. 
Can't wait for summer so I can bring this to a barbecue...it would be perfect for a hot day!

The BEST cucumber salad ever! I first made it when I was given 3 homegrown Asian cucumbers. I didn't have peanuts so I used chopped macadamia nuts. SO GOOD! I've made it at least 5 times in the last 6 weeks. A FAVORITE & a keeper. Can't wait for next summers cucumber season harvest.

Taste Delicious!  Very cool and refreshing although I think next time I will cut back on the sugar and add some read pepper flakes to the dressing.  Its hits all the taste buds and the peanut crunch makes it special.

I only add reviews based on my husbands opinion... Why cook it again if he doesnt like it.
This get only four stars because he thinks that fennel would add the perfect combination. I will try it with fennel next time and add notes, otherwise, this was perfect. Tjough, we didnt have nuts so i used almond slivers, and added red bell pepper and red onion. thanks, its a keeper.

Delicious!!! The jalapenos are definitely not too hot. We all loved this recipe. I think it will be one of our summer favorites. Thank you!  (I used 5 really big cucumbers, 3 jalapenos, extra cilantro, and used the dressing recipe as written. It was just the right amount of dressing. I also didn't salt the cucumbers and added 1 t. kosher salt to the dressing.)

Excellent recipe.  Great for our 110 degree days.  I used splenda and added some cooked quinoa (just cuz I had some left over).  I'm making more for a pool party this weekend.  yum yum.

This was a great salad! I downsized mine and used only 2 cucumbers and 1 1/2 jalapeno peppers. The result was a nice and spicy salad with a sweet tang! 

Definitely don't skimp on the peanuts- they really topped it all off!

The flavor was excellent. I could've added two more cucumbers, and it still would have been too much dressing. Next time, I will cut the sugar and vinegar mixture in half and possibly pour the whole salad into the strainer again to get rid of any excess. Also, I would've been okay with the cukes not being seeded or peeled.

Fantastic!  I was looking for a great lunch bbq-side that didn't have a creamy sauce and this fit the bill!  I may reduce to 1 jalapeno since my family is not exactly spice-loving people... but it was definitely great!

Followed recipe to a tee...WONDERFUL results.  I salted the cucumbers early in the day, let them drain, then stored them until my party started and drained them again. There was a LOT OF dressing so I'll probably cut back the amount next time but the taste was AMAZING!

What a great salad! Could also go really well with barbeque.Not very spicy, though. I doubled the jalapeno and added crushed red pepper for some heat & color.

This was a really nice cool side dish for an asian entree. Very light and tangy. I used English cucumbers and sliced them very, very thin which I prefer. I found that there was a lot of liquid left over after the cucumbers had been served, so I think I could have probably used another cucumber. Really good - try it.

It was delicious. You can add both cleaned out jalapeños and it does not make it hot.

This recipe is very refreshing and delicious! I added red onions and also bean sprouts which added to the flavor and texture.  I made some of my family that didn’t care for cucumbers to just try it - and they liked it! I will add to my regular list of summer recipes!

I love any cucumber salad! This one was very good, but had too much sugar for my liking, so I cut it back along with the vinegar and it was still quite delicious. I would make it again. Oh, and I added a few red pepper flakes just to give it a little pep.

Really nice flavor.  Just be sure to rinse the cucumbers really, really well. Otherwise, it will be a bit too salty.

Made this for 4th of July.  It came out great.  I didn't use as much sugar about 1/3 less because I like more sour than sweet which worked out nicely.  I also added some sliced carrots.

The only change I made is using additional vinegar - I like the cucumbers to soak in it (that's how most Thai restaurants serve it). Very, very good.

So easy and delicious. Our local favorite Thai restaurant serves something similar for an appetizer. This tastes just as yummy! My jalapeños were large so I only used one and finely diced it, still plenty hot for my guests.

I doubled the cucumber, jalapenos, and peanuts. Everything else I left as is, and I still had to drain off some dressing before serving. Some of the people at the party (myself included), had trouble stopping going back for more. It was great on its own until we found out it is amazing as a topping for a mixed green salad with citrus lime vinaigrette and cold lime shrimp! I love it, but would recommend cutting back the dressing if you are not going to increase other ingredients.

I added grated carrot & some sliced scallions as suggested. Plus I substituted some red pepper flakes for the jalapeno (didn't have one) It was awesome; especially the peanuts, don't leave those out.

I went to a Thai restaurant and ordered the salad. Since then I had been trying to find the recipe and then I found this one,  which is so delicious !  I will add sprout ,  tofu  and pepper flakes next time.  It just bursts with flavor. I definitely will make it again.

Loved this recipe.  Only thing I did differently was add more pepper flakes.  But I like things "hot."

This was very good, but the dressing is too sweet and liquidy. The next time I make it, I will use less vinegar and sugar probably cutting it to half or even more. It is a keeper. Our guests liked it.

Easy recipe that tastes very authentic. I do add just a little water to the dressing though. If I don't have jalapeños, I use some red pepper flakes.

This was so good. I ate almost the whole salad myself. Tried this recipe because I planted a garden and have so many cucumbers that I've been trying new recipes; also planted jalapeno peppers and cilantro. I did add a bit of shredded carrot for a little color. Will definitely be making this many times. Thanks for the great recipe.

I really wanted to like this, but I found it came out just tasting sweet. I was shocked at how the vegetables lost all flavor and heat. All I could taste was the sugar. Sorry. I won't be making this again.

In the video, there is a different dressing: two stalks lemongrass, cut into chunks; 2 tsp sugar; 1 tsp curry powder; 1 clove garlic; 1/2 tsp salt; 1/2 cup brown rice vinegar. Pulse everything in a blender until smooth(ish).

I will try this version, but with a LOT less sugar! There is a recipe that I have made for years that we use for Passover, which uses 2 scallions instead of jalepenos, white vinegar instead of rice,1Tbsp. sugar instead of so much sugar, and black pepper for a little heat. There is no salt and that keeps it from getting watery. Very refreshing with a heavy meal.

Loved it! To sweet for you? Kick up the heat! Very good combination of sweet and heat. I used Serrano pepper since I didn't have any Jalapeño in the fridge. Only used one. Its a keeper. I will be taking it to a salad luncheon in June with a warning label.

I have made this recipe twice now since finding it last week.  It is quick and easy (and cheap).  I follow the directions as written except I half the amount of sugar I add.  Also, I know the jalapenos are in there but they don't pack much of a punch for me.  Another reviewer mentioned that you need to make it up right before you serve it but I don't see the need.  I kept it for three days in the fridge with no change really except the cilantro wilted just a bit.  The cucumbers were still crisp and delicious.  I do wait until serving time to add peanuts though.  I used regular roasted, salt free peanuts and mix it in when I am ready to eat.  Thanks for sharing, this one is a keeper!

Three stars for the way it was written.....then later I added some ingredients to the leftovers and it moved to four star.

I added some radish, bean sprouts, a little sweet chili sauce, cashews, more cilantro and poured off some of the dressing - there was way too much.

YUM! I didn't have peanuts so I used walnuts and added some peanut butter to the sauce. Didn't have cilantro so used basil and loveage. Forgot to rinse the salt off the cucumbers which was fine. I'm someone who usually only eats mild salsa and I would recommend only one jalapeno for my comrades. Also added red onion.

Delicious.  Following comments of others I also cut the sugar down (in half for me was fine), added red onion and carrot.  Especially crisp and tangy the first day, though the cucumbers soften as leftovers.

There was too much sugar for me.  I made it exactly as written (except I substituted Serrano peppers because I couldn't find jalapenos in Mexico City!).  I will make again, but I will cut back on the sugar next time - probably half.

This recipe is great as a base, but on its own is pretty lacking. i add cumin, garlic, red pepper flakes, julianned carrots and diced onion to improve.

I have made this so many times this past summer. It's delicious and a great side to grilled meat/bbq. Perfect summertime salad but, I think I'll be eating this year round! I never made it with jalapenos though because of some family members who don't do well with heat. Since I love anything spicy, I can only imagine it would make this salad so much better. I've also had to swap out sugar for splenda before due to some diabetics and I think it tasted just as good. My family and guests always love it and some of them even asked for the recipe. Thank you!

Make this and paired it with a peanut butter chicken, let's just say fabulous!!!! I used baby cucumbers instead and that gave it just the right crunch.

I decided to pick up something for lunch from a food co-op in Albany. While they made a sandwich I looked at the salad bar. We were in the midst of a long July heat wave and this cold cucumber salad looked really refreshing so I tried it and instantly loved it. I wrote the ingredients down that were printed on the label and then came to AllRecipes to find the recipe. This is really close except theirs didn't have jalapenos but it did have curry powder. I chose to use both, just a pinch of curry powder, and it's really, really good. So cold, crisp and refreshing! Make it ahead so it's really cold.

Absolutely phenomenal! I didn't have any jalapenos, so I used crushed red pepper, as other reviewers suggested. Other than this, I made no substitutions. I did, however, wait to eat it until the next day, as our dinner plans changed. All I can say is it was spectacular! My only change next time?? I'll be making a whole lot more!

Flavour was good, but even after letting it dehydrate with salt as suggested for about 40 minutes, the salad became very runny. I drained it before actually serving and felt like I should have drained it again half way through service. I used a little oyster sauce in the dressing in replacement of some of the rice vinegar. That was an improvement I think. Next time I'd add some lemongrass to the dressing to jazz it up a bit.

Pretty good.... I prefer Adrienne's cucumber salad a *tad* better (both have a sweet-tart taste), but really enjoyed the uniqueness of this one. The jalapeno, peanuts and (especially) the cilantro were nice touches. My neighbor commented that she could barely taste the jalapeno tho (I agree). She asked what the green "thingies" were, and when I told her jalapenos, she was surprised. :) NOTE: DO NOT omit the peanuts. They may seem odd, but add an interesting texture (and taste!) that just can't be beat. Ditto for the cilantro. While I'm glad to have given this a try, I do not cook this type of cuisine often and therefore will probably not add this to my recipe box. Thanks for sharing, camp0433! :-)

I made this for a pot-luck, and it went fast; I almost didn't get a taste!  At first I thought the rice vinegar/sugar dressing was rather bland, so I added a tablespoon of chili paste with basil leaves, which you can get at an asian grocery store. I also added sliced red peppers and crispy rice noodles to the salad, and it was wonderful!  This is my new favorite salad recipe.

Made this salad to go with some brats we grilled.  It was different.  I followed the recipe exactly, it has a nice hot and sweet taste.  Next time I will add red onion and carrots like some of the reviewers mentioned.  Thanks for sharing a simple, quick salad!

Excellent as is!  But on a personal preference, I do step 1 as directed, then I marinate all ingredients, except peanuts, for several hours.  Discard the dressing and then add the chopped peanuts.  I think doing it this way, it's not as sweet tasting.

Easy to make. I didn't have jalapenos, so I omitted them and added a dash of ground black peppercorns instead. The only changes that I would make next time are to add slices of red onion and slivers of carrots as the other reviewers suggested. Also, maybe a bit of purple cabbage for color and additional flavor and texture, and cut back a bit on the sugar. I am not a big fan of spicy foods, but next time I may be more bold and try at least one jalapeno. One note, the sugar never fully dissolved as the recipe states, although I gave it a fairly long and vigorous whisking. My friend who is visiting out of town (and is Thai!) said that she's never heard of  or tried this recipe before, but gave it two enthusiastic thumbs up and had seconds, so as far as I'm concerned, it past the test!

Delicious! I made a non-spicy version

My two-year-old also enjoyed it with one modification:  instead of jalapeno peppers, I used a red bell pepper.

This was great! Took it to a covered dish potluck and everyone really enjoyed it. I did follow the tip of adding a little diced red onion for color.  There was too much liquid for my taste and I pored out about half. Next time I will reduce the sugar/vinegar dressing by half.

I've made this a few times and it's always good. The first time I followed the recipe exactly, with good results. I've also made it with Splenda in place of sugar and it is equally good and much better for the diabetic in the household. I usually add an extra cucumber. A smaller batch is a good idea if you're planning to keep it for a few days, because it produces a ton of liquid once everything is combined, but you can always strain a little off. Draining longer in the salted phase doesn't work well because the cucumbers absorb more of the salt, but draining longer on paper towels is a good idea.

Awesome flavors and a nice change to the normal salad.  The amount of dressing left over was a bit much.  When I make this again which I certainly will, I'm thinking 1/4 cup each of the vinegar and sugar instead of the 1/2's.

Really good and easy. Bravo. I used a little less sugar, and added some diced red onions per someone's suggestions. Question: it was a little watery -- how to avoid that?

This salad was a big hit at a recent dinner I hosted.  I did add some purple cabbage I had leftover and didn't put the full amount of sugar the recipe calls for.  It turned out great and is a healthly treat

Took this to a ladies luncheon and everyone wanted the recipe.  I did modify the recipe by adding one shredded carrot and half of a red onion.

I LOVE this recipe.  I am normally not interested in anything spicy but I made this for my husband who is.  It was just the perfect amount of spicy for me and I can't wait to make it again!  So fresh, light and easy to make.  Everyone enjoyed it!

Loved this recipe! It's a refreshing summer salad. If want a spicer taste skip seeding the jalepenos. I made this recipe once  with rice vinegar and once with white vinegar & tasted essentially the same (in case you don't have rice vinegar stocked in your cupboard).

I love this recipe.  I have a lot of cucumbers coming in and this will be one of my favorite ways to use them.  I've followed this recipe exactly and give it a 5.  You can also add other things you have growing in your garden to change it up and it will still be a 5.  I added Thai basil and mint last time along with the cilantro, running low on cilantro, more growing though :-).  If your jalapeno's are mild like mine, you can add about a 1/2 tablespoon of minced ginger and that is good too!  Great recipe!

Found this salad delicious!  A little soupy, but otherwise great!  I was a little concerned because we only have sugar in the raw, which doesn't really dissolve, but it still added some sweetness and the rest just sank to the bottom of the bowl. Added a little crushed red pepper for some extra spice.  Next time I would maybe add a few more veggies, but otherwise, very tasty!

This was better than I imagined.  To save on time I threw everything but the cucumbers in the food processor.  I also used banana peppers because I didn't have jalepenos.  Absolutely awesome.  I'd like some serving suggestions though!

I skipped the jalepenos, cilantro and peanuts because I was looking for dressing for cukes and onions sliced thin. This was perfect. Thanks. I will try it your way too.

This IS heavenly! Out of this world flavor coupled with super easy prep work = a winner in my book! I did add shredded carrot and thin red onion slices as another member suggested in their review. I used the wrapped english cucumber, so no seeding was necesary. (thus making the recipe even easier). I also added a tad more chopped UNSALTED peanuts than called for. Yum!!

I'm giving this four stars because the person i made dinner for liked this salad.  For me, there was something a little off about it.  One big mistake was adding salt to this.  I added less than what's called for, and it was wayyyyy too salty.  Rice wine vinegar already has salt in it.  I'd say don't add any salt until you taste it, then add whatever amount you think it needs.

Sorry folks, not a big fan of this one.  I don't think I like cilantro because it overpowered the taste of everything and that's all I could taste in my mouth ... for hours.  My boyfriend thought the salad was OK at best.  I'm surprised this many people like cilantro.  Ewww

This is the kind of salad that makes you want to suck the cucumbers to experience all of the taste. It is so good. I did lessen the amount of jalapeños a great deal--I used only half of one and it was plenty hot. Don't skimp on the cilantro. So good.

hi, just wanna give u guys some ideas about what is go great with this salad. traditionally, we hv cucumber salad as a side dish for deep fried and barbecue dish. normally that main dishes r rich with flavors and oily, then sweet and sour of this salad will complete overall taste and keep the main dish from being too greasy.

I would rather give this a 4.5. I followed the directions and found the amount of sugar to be too sweet.  I would cut that to half next time and add more according to your own taste.

I love this salad! My favorite Thai restaurant always serves their satay with this salad. Making it at home I usually leave out the sugar. Sometimes I use honey roasted peanuts though and it's a great variation.

Love this recipe - SO easy to do - I substituted Splenda for the sugar and reduced the peanuts to about 2 Tbsp for the whole salad to cut down on the calories and it ended up being only about 50 calories per 1 cup serving.  :)  

The ONLY thing about this recipe ... is it's addictive!  I wonder - will you start turning green if you eat too many cucumbers, like turning orange eating too many carrots?  Hee hee!

Very good. I made it as a side dish for a green curry I was making.  It was good even kind of mixed into the curry. Will make again.

This was fresh, flavorful, and nicely crunchy. I reduced the sweetener (used 1/4 cup agave) and used pecans. It was pretty spicy, but not unbearably so. Nice and easy, too.

This is exactly what I've been looking for- It was super easy and super good.  Now if I can only make two other thai dishes that come out this good I'd have a meal!

My Husband and I love Thai food. This salad tasted just like the one at our favorite Thai restaurant. The only difference was I omitted the peanuts.

Super easy, and very tasty.  My husband is a very picky eater and loved this salad.  Try less vinegar as it was a little sweet, or add more salt.  Otherwise great recipe, I'd definitely make it again.

This was terrific!  The saltiness of the cucumbers and peanuts mixed with the tangy, sweet dressing was a perfect combination.  I, unfortunately did not have enough rice vinegar, so I added enough red wine vinegar to equal the amount I needed.  I also did not think my kids would eat this if it had jalapeños in it, so I used 1/2 Tbsp. Sambal Oelek chili paste.  I will totally make this again.

This recipe is soo good. My daughter made it for our family reunion. Was a hit! So I made it for friends at a BBQ. Everyone loved it. Next time may try 1/4 cup of sugar instead of 1/2 to make it less calories. Definitely making again since I have tons of cucumbers in my garden. Thanks for the recipe.

Very popular at a cookout we brought it to — lots of compliments. I used half the sugar, two additional cucumbers, plus half of the juice of a lime, chopped red pepper, and scallions. Terrific flavor.

I will make this again.  We have a ton of cucumbers growing in our garden and I generally don't have a lot of use for them.  I saw this recipe and used it as a good way to use up a few.  I am not a huge cucumber fan, but this salad was great.  I also added red onion as mentioned by others and used less sugar than the recipe called for (I used more like 1 part sugar to 1.5 parts vinegar versus the 1:1 ratio called for).  Unlike another reviewer, I found it was just as good (and maybe better ) the next day.  I did pour out a decent amount of the juice/sauce before storing it in the fridge and that may have helped prevent it from getting mushy.  Our jalapenos (also from the garden) were small and in the future I'd add a little extra for some kick (which was lacking in my version).  Overall, really good flavors.  I served with bratwurst that we were having off the grill.

I added an extra 1/4 cup of rice wine vinegar, and some ginger paste and let it marinate over 24 hours.

Will definitely make it again

I made the recipe as is and it was very good.  The next time though, I'm going to skip the salting part, rather just let the cukes drain a bit in the colander.  It is best to put everything together just before serving, so the cukes don't get soggy.

Sweet is right. Way too sweet, even after cutting the sugar by more than half. We may try again with one teaspoon of sugar.

I was looking for recipes to use the cucumbers in my garden and saw this.  I didn't have high hopes but I like to try new and different recipes.  I thought the dressing would be aggressive so I used half the amount of the sugar/vinegar mixture.  Surprisingly I really liked it.

Great recipe. I only needed 2 servings so I used 2 cucumbers and 1 jalapeno.

Does the sugar ever dissolve in the rice wine vinegar? Mine didn't, but it was still a great result.

Loved it. With so many cucumbers I will be making this often. Didn’t use jalapeños but added thin slices of red onion and match stick carrots Used dried cilantro instead of fresh. Think it goes better.

I don't even like cucumbers that much, but this salad is dang delicious. I had a handful of small cucumbers to use up and found this recipe - now it will be making a regular appearance at all gatherings I host or attend this summer. Seriously so refreshing! Modifications: I accidentally used white vinegar instead of rice wine vinegar because I wasn't paying attention, and I used Salad Topper (a mix of seeds and dried cranberries) instead of peanuts since that's what I had on hand.

Very delicious salad and easy to make. I made the following changes: (only because it's what I had on hand) I used English Cucumber, omitted the jalapeno and replaced it with crushed chili flakes, used cashews instead of peanuts and added a hand full of shredded carrots and 1 thinly sliced green onion. I also made the dressing and let the carrots, green onion and chili flakes pickle in it while the cucumber sat in the sink half hour.

When I make this I also include red onion and carrots (chopped small or shredded). I’ve had it that way at several Thai restaurants, and it is always a huge hit!

Great recipe. No mayonnaise or sour cream needed. Added some thin red onion for color. Definitely add the peanuts for crunch. May use less pepper next time because it was pretty spicy the next day.

This was very good, but it didn't WOW me. I will probably make it again since I have so many cukes in the garden every year. I may try adding some radish or onion like others suggested to give it a little more zip.

This recipe is fantastic but too much sugar and too much liquid.  I followed instructions exactly and half of my bowl was liquid... the flavor was amazing, just a little bit too sweet.  I also added diced tomatoes as I like a lot of color in my salads.  Overall, fantastic recipe.

I used roasted garlic wine vinegar and an extra jalapeño with seeds because I like some heat. It came our awesome for my taste. Will definitely be adding this to my regular recipe lineup.

This was really delicious! I only made enough for two people so only had to use 2 table spoon of sugar and vinegar. And added red bell peppers, wanted a little more color. Thanks for the recipe!

I made 1/3 of this recipe because I had 1 cucumber and I was eating alone, but it turned out wonderful! I was afraid the cucumber would be too bland after washing off all the salt, but it was fine. Because I was cooking for one, I left out the jalapeno and mixed about 1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper into the vinegar and sugar mixture, which, IMO, was absolutely perfect. Be sure to chop the cilantro finely, though. If the pieces are too large, they get stuck to the side of the bowl instead of mixing with the salad.

Really good and different.  Used a tad less sugar because I only had seasoned rice vinegar, and added some shredded carrot and a little red onion as suggested by others.  Delicious!  Made a second time:  This time used 1 large cucumber and 1 small carrot cut on the bias instead of shredded.  For the dressing I changed to white vinegar and added 2 Tbs. of peanut butter stirred in.  Wow!  What a difference; took the salad over the top.  I switched to white vinegar because I didn't think red wine vinegar would work with the peanut butter.  Give the peanut butter a try; it delicious.  If you like lots of dressing, you may want to 1-1/2 or 2X the dressing since the extra vegetables soaked up all the dressing.

Very good salad. I made it a little hot, the 2 jalapeños would have been fine, but I added a Serrano. I added the lime juice of 1/2 a lime and didn't use as much sugar, 1/3 cup not 1/2 and I also used 1/2 of a small red onion. Don't put the dressing on the entire salad unless you know you will finish it. The juice will make it soggy if you have leftovers.

I wanted to love this but it just didn't happen.  Because of other reviews I reduced the sugar 25% and it was still too sweet.  The jalapenos made it too hot so I took some out.  The cilantro taste was coming on too strong so I took a little of that out as well.  I normally love cucumber salad, just not this one.  So sorry!

This was a good basis for a cucumber salad. It was way too vinegary for me and would have been better with the red onion. But a good starting point!

I like mine a less sweet, so I cut sugar in half and added about 1/8 tsp salt. Used an English cucumber, 1 shallot sliced and carrots sliced in 1/4-inch slices. Then added a little black pepper once veggies and liquids were combined and let sit in the frig until ready to serve. Turned out great! Never added jalapeños and cilantro to my European-style cucumber salad. Tasty asian twist!

This is a good recipe the only changes I made was to add baby spinach, shaved carrot, and some picked red onion.
I used half the sugar.

It is not enough for 4 people.  I would double the recipe next time.  Also, I added 1 red bell pepper, chopped, some minced ginger, 2 cloves of garlic, minced, a splash (about 1 Tbsp.) of soy sauce and about 1/4 cup fresh dill, chopped.  I used unfiltered apple cider vinegar because I didn't have any rice wine vinegar.  I probably would add a little lime zest and juice if I had it.  Maybe some thinly sliced red onion too.

This is our go-to Thai cucumber salad recipe.  We've made it now about 10 times and find it's a close match to local Chicago restaurants.
Our slight change is to omit the peanuts and add just a bit of shaved red onions for color and flavor.
Enjoy, and thank camp0433 for the great recipe!

My family loves salads and this one is a favorite for us.  I added fresh bean sprouts, red bell pepper and  thinly sliced carrots in the salad.  I only used one jalapeno pepper instead of two and minced it in the food processer with 2 cloves of garlic  to add to the dressing.  This would be good as an entrée with some grilled shrimp on top.

This was great.  I did make some changes though, I used English Cucumbers - didn't peel or soak with the salt thought it wasn't needed since I used English cukes.  I also cut the sugar down by about 1/3 of what the recipe calls for.  Took it to a salmon dinner party - it was a hit!!!  Gave the recipe to a few friends...

LOVED this! Wish I could rate it higher! I used suggestions of other reviewers. Since I had only 2 large cucumbers I used 1/4 cup sugar& 1/2 vinegar(had to substitute 1/8 cup rice vinegar& 1/8 cup plain vinegar)& no peanuts due to a family member. A really nice sweetness. I can't wait to make it again!

I've made it twice now.  My husband and I really enjoy it!  To go healthier, I cut the sugar in half and also used toasted cashews rather than peanuts as we had a bag on hand.  It stills tasted delicious with the less sugar!

Fantastic! Sweet, hot, and refreshing! The only changes I made were to put the cilantro, vinegar, sugar,  jalapenos,  and a spoonful of peanut butter in the food processor. And I added shredded carrots,  (more for color than flavor). What a difference from the plain old sour cream, or vinegar-sugar based cucumber salad. I'll never go back to them again.

I thought it was a very good combination.  I made per the recipe but like others have said, could probably halve the sugar, i am a fan of all things vinegar so i'm sure it would allow more of it to come through with less sugar.  Absolutely love the addition of the peanuts which definitely makes the dish, do not make without them.  I left my salted cucumbers sitting out longer thinking they would remove more water but ended up mushy.    Will be making again.

Made this per the recipe except added only one jalapeño. I was worried that it would be too spicy. It wasn't at all. Next time I'm adding 2 jalapeños. This is a very simple, refreshing salad and went well with rice and sweet n sour pork. Make sure you rinse the salt well from the zucchini. I didn't it was way salty. I actually used a salad spinner to dry out the zucchini. I added he dressing at the very last minute. I mixed the dressing ahead of time and just kept it in the frig. To save calories, I'm going to half the sugar amount next time It was very very good.

I've made this recipe with lots of variations. Today I didn't add jalapeño or red pepper flakes and liked it better. I also like to add shredded carrots, thinly sliced red onion, and diced tomato. Delicious!

Have made this many times and I'm always asked for the recipe. I use English Cucumbers and remove only half the skin (stripe pattern) the cucumber "hold up" better and remove the small amount of seeds. Always drain well on paper towels. Didn't use peanuts. Also added thin sliced red onion and shredded carrots.

This has a nice cool, fresh taste for summer. The first time I made it I used two jalapenos, but the second time I made it the peppers I bought were much hotter so I just used one. So you might need to tweak the amount of jalapenos depending on how spicy they are.

This does do a good job mimicking the crisp salad I love at my favorite Thai place.  I omitted the peanuts and substituted a quick squeeze of Agave for the sugar to lower the carbs.  When I tote some to work, I mix in a little quinoa to make it into a hearty lunch that holds up well in the workplace fridge.

I had it twice in one weekend because it was so good. The only bugaboo was how the jalapeños vary in heat from batch to batch, really changing the heat and flavor  of the salad.

I just finished eating The Thai Cucumber Salad, and I must say it's Fab-Tab-Ulous.  This was refreshing, sweet, and spicy.  I served this with a main entree of Asian Lettuce Wraps.  I would only ask people when making something, please consider the ingredients before putting it all in.  I felt the sugar would be to much for me, so I wisked then tasted it.I put maybe 1/3 of Splenda. Same with the jalapeños.  I know my husbands stomach could not take 2 jalapeños, so I cut it back to one.  It floors me when people get all righteous about ingredients, how about tasting the dish before you complete it or taste it as you go.  I realize I may change an original recipe, but I will always adjust a recipe due to dietary needs.  Thank you for submitting!!!!!

Looks like I'm a little late trying this but wanted to say that I made this recipe using only the ingredients it called for and it was most excellent! The only thing I did different was put salt right in the dressing. Only used about half tablespoon and I put the peanuts in after pouring the dressing on but it didn't get served for about an hour or so. Had a tiny bit leftover and I thought it was just as good as day 1. Maybe because I didn't pre-salt the cukes, not sure but still very tasty. The only thing I will do different next time is add a little more Cilantro, more Jalapeno and add some Red Pepper Flakes. Probably won't be long before the next time either.....

A delicious salad that my daughter and I loved.  The coolness of the cucumber went great with the heat of the jalapeños, brightness of the cilantro and crunch of the peanuts all mixed in with a sweet rice vinegar dressing.  The only recommendation would be maybe less sugar as stated in a previous comment by about 1/3.  Other than that, this is a very good recipe.

Had a glut of cucumbers from the garden and we found this recipe.  My wife is not a huge cucumber fan, but loved the heat and texture this salad presents!  Overall we were very happy with it.  We were able to cut out some of the sugar, may try a sugar substitute next time (perhaps coconut sugar).  One jalapeno was more than enough.  I put the jalapeno (whole, unseeded) into a food processor with the nuts and chopped it fine.  Processing time was very short, seeding the cucumbers is the biggest task!  Good the next day too, just pour out the liquid!

This recipe is fantastic.  I did make a few changes however.  I added some radish to spice it up.  A little yellow pepper to add some color.  The dressing is much better with a touch of peanut oil.

Awesomely refreshing salad! Followed the recipe, except I had 2 cucumbers and used 1/3 rice vinegar and sugar. I didn't have jalapeno, so I substituted 2 tbs Sambal (fresh red chili paste). It had an awesome kick! Paired well with my Korean bbq ribs and rice. This is definitely a keeper!

Creative and pretty little cucumber salad recipe. To add more colors, I included shredded carrots and sliced red onion. The amount and tanginess of the sauce here dominated some of the other flavors though. Next time I will cut the sugar and vinegar down to 1/3 cup each. Thanks for sharing.

The only reason I am ranking it a 4 is because I changed a couple of things. This was very yummy though. I added some red onion and only used one un-seeded jalapeno. Other than that, I didn't change a thing. Super easy and light and will be a regular for me.

Great, thought the jalapenos might be too hot, but the heat was just right.  It's a little like the japanese cucumber salad, but the cilantro and peanuts add great flavor.

I have made this many, many times. Very good and easy. Add crushed red pepper or sriacha hot sauce, just a little, for some heat. Add fresh tomatoes and/or very thinly sliced carrots, too, if you have some that need to be used up.

We really loved this.  I made two changes to satisfy our tastes... I used only a 1/4 cup of sugar (1/2 cup would have been way to sweet for us) and used one jalapeno instead of two.  It was still very hot for me but could eat it.  Will definitely make this again.

Easy, delicious and healthy!  It's better if you let it sit for a few hors before eating it (put peanuts on when you serve).  Great for a lite lunch or a dinner side.

This recipe is AWESOME!  If you like the Thai cucumber salad that you can get at most any Thai restaurant - you'll love this one.  I add red onions sliced very thin and cut the jalapeno in half.  One jalapeno makes it plenty spicy especially if it sits in the fridge for a few hours.

I made this for a Thai pot-luck dinner and everyone LOVED it... I do recommend halving the dressing as other folks have posted, way to much dressing to salad ratio.  I also added a small diced red pepper for color (also recommended by other posts that I read)

This was tasty, but a little saucy for me. I would cut the sugar and vinegar in half and you will have plenty of sauce. I also added out a half cup of red pepper for more color, and it reminded me of a cuke salad at our favorite Thai place . . . Yum! Two jalapeño peppers made it a bit too spicy for our kids, but was great heat for us!

This tasted just like my favorite Thai restaurant!  but of course i had to add my special touch:  a minute amount of the thinest sliver of red cabbage, thin slivers of onion and celery.

I only added 1/4 cup sugar and 1/3 cup vingar just becuase 1/2 cup of sugar was just way to sweet and 1//2 vingar is just too much liquid for me. Other than that, I love all the flavors. It's a great summer side dish!

yummy and easy - great kick with the jalapeño! If I made it again I'd probably cut back the sugar, it's a bit too sweet.

Simple and delicious. I made it as written, then with tomatoes added, then with tomatoes and mint and loved them all. For my wimpy taste, 1/4 of a small jalapeno to each cucumber is just right.  Thanks for this keeper.

Very refreshing! I added Thai Peanut Sauce, Fresh Basil, Pea Pods and a squeeze of lime. Thinking of chilled cooked shrimp as an add next time...

Thought this was wonderful.  Just want to be sure to serve it right away after preparing because it gets really watery and cukes get limp and soggy.  So wasn't the best choice for a potluck where dishes are out to be nibbled on throughout the event.

I made this to accompany "Awesome Spicy Beef Kabobs" from this site.  I am not a fan of cucumbers, but had some to use up and this is absolutely awesome!  Wonderful companion to the hot kabobs!

This dish was so simple and so yummy! Instead of jalepenos I used only one habenero pepper only because I've never been a big jalepeno fan. And I was unsure about the amount of sugar but just went with it and it was perfect! Definitely a good start to a meal.

This salad was delicious!!!!!!! I made it for a party about a month ago and am still dreaming about it/craving it. I can't wait to make it again. Yum!  I skipped the soaking in salt/salt step and thought it was still flavorful and delicious. I also left the seeds in the cucumbers. I like the texture they add and don't see any need to get rid of them (though this may make it less authentic). Thanks for the great recipe!

I could eat this all day. I prefer to cut the cucumbers into paper-thin slices using the mandolin, to soak up more of the flavor.  We also add a dash of Thai sweet chili sauce. It's orange with red pepper flakes in it.

Fun way to use extra cucumbers! I also had some  fresh zucchini and red pepper I needed to use up so I tossed them in and it all tasted great. Only used 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup rice wine vinegar as well and thought it was sufficent.

I was looking for a recipe to use some of the cucumbers and jalapenos in my garden. I am really glad I tried this one. I can't stop eating it! I think I will double it and make it for my baby shower this weekend.

Wow!  I made this tonight, and it was delicious!  I am so pleased!  I am diabetic and on a low carbohydrate diet, so I substituted Splenda for the sugar, and I did not have Cilantro.  I made it anyway and I was so impressed that I joined allrecipes.com so I could write and tell you what a delicious, refreshing side dish this is!  What a simple recipe and so delicious!

Awesome salad - making it for the second time tonight! This time I'm going to skip the peanuts and use a little less cilantro, as it was a bit overpowering... but overall a great tasting recipe!

I cut back on the sugar but this was still entirely too sweet in my opinion. The amount of sugar might have been okay if the peppers added heat but since the peppers are seeded, there really wasn't any heat either. I think this recipe has great potential but as written it just tasted like sweet pickles (and very sweet at that) to us. The peanuts were a nice touch (I forgot about them when I went to take the photo but I did serve it with them on there).

excellent recipe!  very yummy!  I added some sliced onion to it, excellent addition.  It does use 1/2 cup white sugar but I don't think you really end up eating that much, I had a lot of liquid left after we ate all the salad.  I'd say this recipe barely feeds 4, we wolfed it down!

Very nice and refreshing. A little sweeter than I expected, but they were very good!

Really good salad!  I followed the directions in the original recipe.  After tasting it, I tweaked the recipe to suit my tastes.  I doubled the jalapenos and cilantro and then I added 1/3 cup of finely chopped red onion.

This was an awesome salad!  I complimented it with a chicken thai dish.  The only thing I eliminated were the peanuts.  Other than that, great recipe!

Very delicious.  Served as a side dish to Egg Foo Young. I added more peanuts and cilantro than called for and certainly could have used more jalepeno but I didn't want to make it too spicy for my husband.

I've finally found a cucumber salad recipe similar to the one at my favorite Thai restaurant. I didn't add the cilantro, peanuts, or jalapeno, but I'm sure that would be great in there! I ate this with pad thai.

Awesome!  I added onion and switched out the peanuts for almonds.  But this is a definite keeper for our family.

Delicious! We loved this recipe. I did skip the peanuts, but it was great even without them. Thanks! :)

This went very well with the Curried Coconut Chicken recipe, also found on this site. I look forward to making it again when we have fresh cucumbers in our garden!

Very nice and light -- had it with a chicken satay and peanut sauce, and it was perfect.  Thanks!
