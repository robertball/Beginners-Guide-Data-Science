My mom always used to make this for the 4th of July. It doesn't keep very well, so if don't have enough people to eat the entire thing in one sitting, I make a bunch of small meringue bowls instead of one big one. I keep the small bowls in the oven (for days) until we get through them all. Mini-pavlovas! MMMMMM!!!

This was delicious!.. I have some friends that don't eat wheat, so this fit the bill nicely.  I did make a change from whipped cream for my lactose intolerants, by taking 0% fat, lactose free, Greek Yoghurt, using about 1/4 c of powdered sugar and the 2 tbsp of Cointreau.  Got great raves on this.

This is my go to Pavlova recipe.  Things I changed; doubled the recipe, used super fine sugar and what a beautiful meringue!  I also used kiwi and pineapple in addition to the strawberries.  The meringue needed 2 hours not 1.25 to bake completely.
Absolutely delicious, a real hit at potlucks.
