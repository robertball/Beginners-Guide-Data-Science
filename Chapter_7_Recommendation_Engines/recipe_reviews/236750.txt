Love it! I made this for Valentine's gifts for friends and kept one for myself. You can adjust it to your liking which is nice. In one bottle I used two half portions one with"raw" cane sugar and one with fine granulated sugar. In one I used brown sugar for a friend who prefers the taste of molasses. The variations are limitless. Thank you NWMama for this delicious idea.
