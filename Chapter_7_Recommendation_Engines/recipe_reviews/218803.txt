This is really, really good. I must admit I had no idea what you meant by "jelly filled roll cakes" and a friend of mine said, "She means Little Debbie-style cakes with jelly filling."  I don't typically buy those types of dessert items so I substituted a sponge cake and topped it with some home made raspberry jam and cut that up.  I followed the rest of the recipe to a "T".  The second time I made it, I made it into 2 layers, topped it off with chocolate chips, whipped cream and raspberry sauce....drizzled down the inside of the bowl...and both were fabulous.  Thanks for a "keeper" recipe.  I made it in July, not Winter, and was so happy I will make it again...soon.
