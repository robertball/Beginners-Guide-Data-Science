The biscotti tased great.  I did add 1/2 cup oil, however, as I could not get dough to even form into a ball to divide it in half - it was too dry.  Next time I make this recipe, I think I would cut back on the poppy seeds by a tablespoon and increase the lemon extract and lemon zest as the lemon flavor got hidden by the poppy seeds.

Because other reviewers said this wasn't lemony enough and because I didn't have any lemon extract, I added 4 tablespoons of lemon juice. I also added 1 T. of oil because I didn't want these to be rock hard. So, I had to add about 1/2 c. extra flour. I also added extra poppy seeds--maybe 1/4 c. extra. I can taste the lemon, and the biscotti are nice and crispy, without being tooth-chipping.

This was so easy to make. As previous members stated I added 6 tablespoon of lemon juice. i didnt have lemon extract. Also I added grounded up walnuts instead of almonds. Will use this again!

I've had to come back to edit this review. At first, I was pretty happy with this recipe. When I first took them out of the oven the second time, the lemon flavor was subtle but very nice. But by the next day, the flavor had faded and become unpleasant and strange.. vaguely citrusy, but it didn't meld well with the flavor of the almonds. I had made these for a friend and when I asked her if they were good, she sort of giggled and said, "Well, I wasn't going to say anything, but...." Also - I only used 1 1/2 tbsp. poppyseed and it was PLENTY. Sorry, I won't make these again.

I really liked these.  The flavor is subtle, but good.  The dough was sticky and I was able to form it into a log only by putting blobs of dough on the cookie sheet and smoothing it into log shape with wet fingers.  I took another reviewers suggestion and used the leftover egg yolk to brush on the logs before baking.  It probably isn't necessary, but it keeps you from wasting the yolks.  You MUST use a serrated knife to slice the logs.  I had no trouble with mine cracking apart.  The finished biscotti are very crisp, but I wouldn't call them hard.  I baked them the second time for 5 minutes on one side, turned them, and baked for 4 minutes on the other.

The flavors are what you would expect in a lemon poppy muffin. But the flavors mix in a subtle way that lets each flavor pop up in turn.
I'd recommend using the yolks for an egg wash. The cookies look better and it brings the yellow color of the cookies out nicely.

Excellent.  I had no trouble with my dough sticking together - it was very sticky in fact!  I coated my hands w/ cooking spray while I was forming the logs.  I used a silpat instead of parchment paper.  I followed advice of others and increased lemon extract and reduced poppyseeds by one tablespoon.  I made them for mom for mother's day and she loved them.  Thanks!

This is a wonderful biscotti recipe!  As per other reviewers suggestions, I cut back the amount of poppy seeds to 1.5 tsp and used 2 tsp of Pure Lemon Extract - gives it a wonderful but not over-powering lemon flavour - PERFECT!!!  I have found a secret to not handling sticky biscotti dough,as it tends to gets stcky because of the heat in your kitchen so I place my dough in the fridge for about 20-25 minutes and this helps to firm it up and can be shaped into the logs without it sticking! Works like a charm on ANY biscotti recipe that I have tried so far! I love this lemon poppy seed recipe and will be making it often!

Great taste, excellent combination of flavor with a good mix of both carbohydrate and protein.  Almonds are such a healthy protein.  I was very disappointed in the yield.  The recipe claims 36-No way cut in 1/2 inch links!  May yield was

So I didn't have almonds in the house, I substituted them with pecans and it still turned out great, I also increased the lemon zest to 1.5 tbsp, the lemon extract to 1.5 tsp, and decreased the the poppy seeds to 2 tbsp.  I also increased the baking time after slicing because they were not crispy enough, I baked them for 15 minutes on one side, 10 minutes on the other and now they taste perfect!

Was not crazy about these. I added fresh lemon juice as well as the lemon extract. There was too much poppy seeds as well.  I found the dough to be flaky and it was hard to put it together so it didn't fell apart.  It needed more liquid and that's when I added the fresh lemon juice. I also cooked it longer the second part of the baking.  They were so boring that I frosted them with lemon frosting.  Have had and made better.  Will not make them again.

I followed the recipe to the letter and the dough was extremely dry. Okay, they don't have any fat so maybe that was the reason, I thought.  I proceeded to make and bake the cookies.  When I finished and took a bite...What a waste of perfectly good poppy seeds!

The first time I made the recipe I had to scrap the dough and start over.  It wouldn't hold together so I tried 1/2 cup of oil but then it cracked and fell apart when I cut it.  When I made it the second time I used 1 1/2 tbsp of poppy seeds, the juice of one lemon, 1 tbsp of almond extract, and 2 tbsp of water.  The dough was sticky but it turned out perfectly when cooked.  It's a little less dry than traditional biscotti, easy to make and tastes like my favorite muffins (lemon poppyseed).

Fantastic base recipe!  I substitute lemon extract for almond extract and I add 3/4 cup pistachios in addition to the recipe.  When cooled; I melt dark chocolate and swirl it on.  I made these for Christmas and now Valentine's Day!  A crowd favorite.

I followed the recipe as it is written but my biscotti did not turn as crisp as other biscotti.  I also found them them to be a bit too dry and coated them in a lemon glaze.

Quite a nice biscotti, although not as crunchy as I would have liked.  I only used 2 tablespoons of poppy seeds, upped the lemon zest to 2 tablespoons and used the juice of the lemon rather than extract.  Also used the leftover yolks to glaze the top of the biscotti before putting in the oven.

These were ok. I didn't have lemon extract so I used a little more than 1/4 cup of lemon juice, which resulted in too wet of a dough so I had to add almost 3/4 cup extra flour. Even then it wasnt lemony enough for me. Next time i would definitely use lemon extract but more than 1 tsp.

Wow, I don't know what I did wrong but these were way too dry to easily form into logs. Then when I tried slicing them, they pretty much just crumbled into chunks. The taste was good but I wish mine looked like the ones in the pictures!

This is a very good recipe for low-fat biscotti. The cookies are very tasty and crispy, but need a little more of a lemony taste. Next time I make them, I will probably add a little lemon juice or something to boost the lemon flavor. I did drizzle the finished cookies with a glaze; I simply mixed powdered sugar with enough lemon juice to make a good glazing consistency. This boosted the lemon flavor slightly, and made them look very pretty! I also used only 2 tbs. of poppy seeds, because 3 tbs. seemed like way to much. Thanks for a tasty recipe; I will make them again!

Wonderful flavor! Next time I might use a bit less sugar to cut down on sweetness (and save a few calories). FYI for Weight Watchers folks -- if you make 36 biscotti, these are 1 pt. apiece. (Sorry -- in my original review I said they were 1 pt. apiece if you made 18 biscotti. My mistake.)

the dough was crumbly and definitely took some work to form into logs - wetting hands first helped a lot.  I was worried about the logs being too thin (less than 1/2" tall) but they puffed up nicely in the oven.  i took the advice to use up the yolks as an egg wash and got a really lovely yellow color, but i think i will skip that next time because it tasted too "eggy".  really nice crunch, but not enough of the lemon flavour - will have to up the amount of zest and extract next time.

These were the first biscotti I have ever made.  They turned out pretty well, considering the simplicity of the recipe and absence of fat.  I used 2 whole jumbo eggs, brown sugar, unbleached flour, ground poppy seeds, and freshly squeezed lemon juice instead of lemon extract.  Also added a bit of almond extract.  I sprayed the wax paper with a little oil to prevent sticking.  The recipe doesn't specify dimensions of the logs, so I improvised and made mine about 3" wide and 10-12" long.  Baked them for 25 mins, not 30 to prevent burning, and for another 5-7 mins once sliced.  The lemon flavor is very faint but, overall, the biscotti are crunchy and enjoyable.  However, if you're looking for that rich, buttery flavor many "authentic" biscotti have, you might be disappointed.

I forgot to add the poppy seeds and it still turned out great.  I had to use a little lemon juice and rum.  Since there wasn't enough lemon flavor I coated finished product with a lemon glaze (powdered sugar and fresh lemon juice.)

Great biscotti recipe. Was apprehensive about so little wet ingredients so I used the juice from the zested lemon and doubled the lemon extract. I also dusted the top with icing sugar before baking. Yum!

I made these cookies one night and by the next day they were all gone. Everybody loved them.   Now when I make them I change the flavor by changing Almond extract with the lemon extract and added sliced almonds instead of poppy seeds.   You can do this with all different kinds of flavoring and different add in.

This biscotti has virtually no lemon flavor and WAY TOO MUCH poppy seeds.  I don't know if the 3 Tablespoons is wrong or what, but the only thing I tasted was poppy seed.  I won't make this again, although it did have a good texture.  Maybe use it as a base for another type of biscotti.

I like these!  I made them using Splenda for Baking.  They do not have a strong lemon flavor, which I like.  I'll make them again.

I wasn't very fond of this. Okay flavor but to hard even when dunking in your morning caffine injection. A friend of mine liked them so I let him eat them all. Not a great recipe. 
If you are set on making this only bake two times. Do not bake the last third time, hopefully you'll have a softer product. Good luck.

Very good.  I made these when I had a family get together and everyone loved them.  If you are good at following directions then they are pretty simple to make.

They were too dry.  I had to add 1/3 cup oil just to get them to hold together.  But they taste excellent!

Good recipe BUT ... without adding butter it was too dry to form any kind of "log".   I added 6 TB and it was really tasty.

Definitely not for a novice like me meaning don't expect to follow the recipe and have it turn out perfectly.    So then what's the point of recipe you have adjust?     I did everything according to the directions and ending up with more of a loose grain than a dough.   I added another egg so it would just stick together.   I added a couple of tablespoons of lemon  zest and lemon extract still not that lemony.

I did add oil to the batter it was way too dry.  There was no way I could form anything.  I added fresh lemon juice instead of the extract and less poppy seed. We are big lemon lovers so I wanted the lemon flavor to stand out.  They are baking I'm anxious to try them.  Hopefully they will turn out good.  I think I will drizzle a lemon flavored icing over them before trying them.

5 for flavor, 3 for the recipe. I had the same moisture issues as the others. I added an extra egg and 1/4 cup of oil to actually get this into dough form. I also used chia seeds instead of poppy, but those were all my alterations (I was actually able to find lemon extract at the store!). I loved the flavor! And the consistency came out great, even after my meddling. Realistically though, I'm going to use another recipe and trade out the anise for lemon extract. I'm sure I"ll get the same results.

Made as directed, and they were good. I felt they had too many poppy seeds, as I found myself extracting them from my gums for a while after eating. I think next time I will use 1/2 the amount. Will also use lemon OIL instead of lemon extract next time to amp up the lemony flavor. I spread some white chocolate on the bottoms of half of these, and that was a really yummy combo.

It was very hard to mix together and get into the shape of a log.  Then when it baked it wanted to burn.  I tried slicing them and there were areas that fell apart.

The dough was not a dough. I had to add two more eggs to get it to stick together. Other biscotti recipes are not a real "doughy" dough but this one just didn't form a ball at all. I added the extra egg and a few tablespoons of water.
