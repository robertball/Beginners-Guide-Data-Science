I've made Adobo many times - for those who found that it was too salty, this has to do with the brand of soy sauce you use.  If you buy Kikoman for example use 1/2 cup less than the recipe calls for or add more water.  If you buy a Filipino brand like Silver Swan then follow the recipe as is and it won't be salty at all.

This is a flavorful dish with a garlicy-tangy sauce. I substituted brown sugar for the honey and it came out fine. Some suggestions: Trim the fat from the chicken, otherwise the sauce gets a little oily. When returning the mixture to a boil, do not cover the saucepan - allow the sauce to evaporate until it is reduced to about half its original volume. The sauce will have a glaze-like consistency. I don't have a grill, so I quick-pan-fried the chicken in a little oil and minced garlic - just enough to make the outside crisp. Tasty!

This recipe was great!  By accident, I overcooked the chicken so it was little on the dry side but still very good.  Next time, I'll just have to keep a better eye on the cooking time and all will be fine! Will make again!

This is scrumptious. I was raised with Filipino families and this is exactly how this dish is made. It has the perfect amount of soy sauce. You can also cook this all in one pan in the oven. Place all the ingredients in a baking pan being sure not to crowd the chicken. Bake at 375degrees for 50 minutes until most liquid is evaporated and the meat is falling off the bone.

Decreased soy sauce to 1 cup, increased water to 2 cups, and used rice vinegar.  Very unique but even the picky 11-yr old son ejoys this dish.

OK here's the deal: This recipe is WAY too salty. Why hasn't anyone else noticed this before? I thought I was going to have to throw away the dish but I just kept the chicken and not the sauce. The amount of soy sauce is way too much for the recipe, try cutting down on it if you make this chicken. Another recipe I used before from all recipes is "Baked Teriyaki Chicken" submitted by Marian Collins, it was delicious.

I used brown sugar for the honey, omitted the grilling, and used an additional bay leaf and it was pretty close to the Adobo I grew up with, just a littly oily. I added some chicken breast as well, but found that it was too strongly flavored so next time I'll either use all darkmeat or cut the vinegar a little.

Yummy and sooo easy.  My husband likes this one better than the one his brother spends hours on.  Kids like it too.  It's a keeper!  We also ate it right out of the pot, no need to grill.  I might try it next time just to see...

Wow Donna, was this ever delicious!!!! Several people said that they didn't bother to grill the chicken and I'm sure it was good as is, however, the grilling process really brings out the flavors. I just used my on top of the stove grill pan and I'm so glad I did. The sugar from the honey carmalized and charred the skin so beautifully. The kids went wild over this dish Donna and I thank you for submitting it!

Unlike other reviewers, we didn't find this dish too oily or salty. I trimmed the fat off the chicken (which might cut down on the oily) and didn't grill it after cooking. Both myself and my very picky husband absolutely loved this recipe.

My husband does not like teriyaki.  It is usually too sweet for him.  He loved this dish.  I mixed the sauce up, cut the water in half, added a pinch more garlic and brown sugar and cayenne to the mix.  Soaked the chicken in this mix.  Baked the chicken, then broiled it to finish.  It's Wonderful. I served it with plain rice, extra boiled down sauce, and a deli coleslaw mixed with pineapple and sunflower seeds.

Wonderful flavor! Halved the soy sauce, doubled the water. Returned the grilled, cooked chicken to the reduced sauce for a few minutes to infuse the flavor again. Wonderful!

I give this 4 stars not because of the taste, but because I found boiling the meat first made the chicken "pasty" and a weird texture

I think this is great with a few changes.  I decreased the soy sauce by 1 cup and increase the water by 2 cups.  All of the ingredients remain the same.  Instead of grilling the chicken, I leave it to simmer until the meat is falling off the bone, usually 45 min to 1 hour.  I made this recipe for my Filipino parents and they said it was better than their own!

I like one reviewer over cooked the chicken, but the taste was great.  For the sauce, I did as one person wrote and decrease the soy sauce to 1 cup, increased the water to 2 cups and used rice vinegar.

This was incredibly easy and delicious. The only problem that I saw with the recipe is that it doesn't indicate what kind of vinegar to use so I used white vinegar. It worked well. Balsamic vinegar may have been over powering, but I'm not sure, it could have gone nicely with the flavors. I also used low sodium soy sauce.   A little bit of the sauce goes a long way! Go easy on it or your rice and chicken will be over powered. I forgot to mention that to one diner, they used a lot of the sauce, and they said it was too salty.

This is the first chicken recipe my husband actually went crazy for.  I used boneless chicken breast cause it was all i had at the time.  Marinated it in the sauce for a couple of hours then put it on the grill and kept basted it with the sauce.  This will definatley be my future chicken recipe!!!

This was one of the first recipes that I did when I first started cooking. I have altered a few things since then.  But it one of families favorite meals. My secret is after I boil the chicken I add caramel to the skin and then broil it till skin starts to brown.

This was excellent. I followed reviewers' advice and cut the soy sauce to 1 cups while upping the water to 3 cups. I also added a dash of liquid smoke which gave it fabulous flavor. I only had bone-in chicken, so I put five chicken thighs in the sauce (turning them in middle so they all should be submerged at some point) and cooked for 40 minutes. Then I transferred to a pan and broiled in the oven for five minutes. I boiled the sauce a little more to reduce and then spooned some over the chicken, as well as over the rice and broccoli I served as sides. The house smelled fabulous and the whole family loved this supper.

This was a pretty tasty recipe, but even with the soy sauce cut down, it was still too salty for our tastes.  Next time, I will only put in 1/2 c of soy sauce and 3 c of water.  Also, I didn't have any honey so I substituted 3 T brown sugar.

Loved this chicken - only reason that I gave 4/5 is that the sauce was wayyyy too salty.  And I am a saltaholic.  Maybe the soy I used, not sure.  Once I reduced, it was inedible b/c of the sodium.  I used a tiny portion and added water, and just LIGHTLY brushed it on top when I grilled.  I loved the result - flavorful and somewhat healthier than with all the sauciness.

ABSOLUTELY DEEE-LISH!!!  Since I don't have the luxury of an outdoors BBQ, I just broiled it on the top shelf of my oven for 3 minutes on each side. The house had the "just-as-if" smell of a wood BBQ. The chicken was super tender, and a huge success with my  picky better half.  Thanks so much for sharing. :-)

Excellent. I added salt and pepper as well as a few shakes of worcestershire sauce. My 13 yr old son devoured it. I will make this again for sure.

This is super yummy.  We used chicken thighs with the bones in.  The sauce didn't get thick enough for our taste, so I added a bit of a cornstarch/water mixture, which worked perfectly.

I thought this was very good. I reminded me of the mall's bourbon chicken. I love knowing that I could grill quickly since the chicken thighs were already cooked. I served it with a side of fried rice and steamed broccoli.

I used low sodium soy sauce, and a little less than called for. I used rice vinegar and more garlic. Instead of grilling, I broiled the chicken for about 4 minutes. I reduced the sauce until it was pretty thick. The flavor concentrates quite a bit so... do as told by the submitter: "serve with just a little of the sauce, not too much". Very tasty!

I can't even stress how disappointed I was in this dish.  I followed the recipe exactly and was very unimpressed with the results.  The chicken was dry, salty and sour.  Not a dish I will make again - nor would I recommend it to others.

Wow, I served with brown rice and lots of the juice/glaze drowning everything. Tastes just like dad's!! I am used to adobo made in a big stock pot and simmered for hours, so this was a nice change but still had authentic flavor. It didn't turn glaze-like (more of just an adobo juice), but thats probably due to the fact I used less honey. I made the marinade and put the chicken in a bag with it and froze it until ready to use. Yesterday i put it in the fridge to defrost and further marinate the flavor. FABULOUS!! And for those who say it is too salty, it is not at all. I used reduced sodium soy sauce after reading the reviews, but ended up putting La Choy full sodium soy on afterward because it was lacking something. Salt. It's just how the flavors are supposed to be. That taught me not to mess with perfection ;)

I'm giving this 4 stars but I changed it a bit like others to reduce the salt.  I sub'd a little Tamari soy sauce w/ about 1/2 cup of regular soy. Tamari is quite a bit sweeter than regular so I didnt add any sugar.  I LOVE the boil in sauce idea and it turned out in no time; instead of grilling for an hour. I only boiled it about 20 mins.  The flavor was thru the whole chicken instead of the skin.  I just made sure I had enough liquid to almost cover the thighs in the large sautee pan.  Then I transfered to a casserole dish and baked it at 350 for another 20 mins.  It was yummy!  I just put the leftovers with the sauce in the crock pot to shred and serve like "asian" style chicken over rice for tonight.  The kids loved it and I'm pretty happy with it.  Thanks again for the boil idea, I've never tried it before and it worked great to infuse the flavors of ginger, garlic and soy!

well, this is a chicken recipe i wont make again. i found it came out like bad chinese food, tasting like pure soy sauce.  even with low sodium soy sauce, it was still way salty.  i broiled at the end instead of grilling, maybe grilling is absolutely needed.  i wont find out though, theres too many other good recipes on this site.  oh well.

This is a very tasty, easy meal and we all loved the flavors.  However, the chicken thighs reduced so much during cooking, they were too small to put on the grill. So we broiled them, which was fine.  Because of the reduction, we were left with about 4 servings, not the 8 given.  But I will definitely make this again.

I first reviewed this recipe over two years ago, and I've been making this recipe regularly since then. The measurements are fairly flexible; I've various ratios of soy sauce, water, and vinegar, and it's always good. Try it with turkey!

Great recipe.  Family love it with rice.  I didn't grill it,  I don't have a grill.  I just boil it in the sauce for 2 hrs, it was nice and tender.  I used 1 cup of soy and 2 cups of water.  Yum Yum.  Thank Donna

The sauce on this is great over couscous. WW  only 4 points/serving for half a breast. Original notes: I threw it all in a pan, walked away. Didn't have a grill so I broiled instead. Next time I'll just leave them in the broth until serving though, as broiling just created dishes. I followed advice of others and reduced soy sauce to 1 cup, increased water to 2 cups. Glad I did. Still very flavorful but not overwhelmingly salty or soy sauce. (Low carb too, if you go easy on the rice!) Thank you!

I make almost the exact same adobo mix but instead of cooking the chicken in the mix, I marinate the raw chicken breasts or thighs for about 1-2 hours, then grill the chicken on the barbecue.  It might still be a little salty for some, but adding some water would probably cut some of that.  The chicken comes out dynamite and it's much less salty that way.  Everyone I've ever made this for raves!

Cut the recipe down to 2 servings and followed it to a T, except for using only 1/4 cup soy sauce and making up for the missing liquid by using 1/2 cup water. It was perfect this way. I let the chicken marinade in the sauce for a few hours before cooking it, and it came out moist and flavorful.

I thought the sauce had an excellent flavor.  I used rice vinegar and low sodium soy sauce.  We opted not to grill just because it was raining, but I will try it that way next time.  Thanks.

This one was ok.  I liked the flavor.  I did follow the suggestions and reduced the soy sauce.  If I tried this again I'd use boneless chicken breast instead.

This is a wonderful recipe!  I substituted chicken wings, because we were having a "wing" party with various types of wings, but followed the recipe otherwise.  We had BBQ, Garlic hot and adobo wings and the adobo wings were the first to go.  Try it, you'll love it!!!

Excellent flavor and a real hit served with rice and pineapple!

One thing is to make certain you don't use TOO big a pot. I halved the recipe and used my stock pot to fit 6 thighs plus the fluids. Well I should have stuck with a regular pot, because at about 25 minutes of cooking time on the stove, the pan boiled dry. Ths left the chicken a little dry especially on the outside, and without any sauce. BUT the flavor was so intensely good, and the inside meat was so tender, that I am sure a different sized pot that actually kept fluid at a better level would solve this problem.

Great recipe, thanks!

This is absolutely the best chicken recipe I've found! The chicken was cooked on low heat and came out soo juicy and tender. The marinade was wonderful. However, I did make some minor changes. I ran out of soy sauce so I used 1/2 cup of fish sauce and 1/4 soy sauce to make 4 servings. It came out wonderful!! Also, I used boneless chicken breast and cut the fat off so that the sauce wasn't so oily. 
I will definately be cooking this again and again!

I placed all ingredients in a ziplock bag,along with boneless/skinless chicken thighs, mariniated overnite and grilled it the next day. I dont understand why it calls for cooked chicken to then be cooked on a grill. I  followed the ingredients but added about 1 tbs red pepper flakes for a lil bit of kick.

Liked it a lot.  Served it with brown rice and steamed broccoli. After removing the chicken, I spiced up the sauce with a little chipotle pepper sauce and thickened it with cornstarch and served it in little dipping bowls...  we dipped the grilled chicken and broccoli in it.

My husband and son are VERY particular about how chicken is cooked, especially our 9 year old son. They both devoured it and our son asked for seconds! Very juicy and tender, no knife needed to cut it! 
Of course it's January and it's snowing so we couldn't use our grill so we tossed it into the oven afterwards at 350 degrees for a little bit. 
Amazing...Just amazing!

I brown the chicken first stove top, then set aside. Combine the remaining ingrediants are described. Then return the chicken back to the pan. Attention: Try Philippine soy sauce has the least amount of sodium,700mg as to 1.100-1.200mg found in popular grocery store brands.

I didn't get to marinate this but about 20-30 minutes so it didn't have quite as much flavor as I would've liked, but marinating it longer would probably make it a 5 star recipe for me so I'm going to go ahead a and give it 5 stars.

I almost felt like I was back in Manila...only thing I did different is use Agave nectar instead of honey.  I was out of honey at the time.  I did use palm vinegar also since I have a Philippine grocery store close to me.

This was easy, tasty and did not make every dish in my kitchen dirty. Three things I greatly appreciate in a recipe. The taste was wonderful. I omitted the bay leaves, used slightly more garlic and could only find bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (of which I removed the skin before using). The meat practically fell off the bone!

Followed recipe exactly except using organic low sodium tamari and low sodium rice vinegar.  We grilled them too long in the end and dried them out but still delicious.  Next time we will grill on medium and until they look crispy but not charred. Our fault not the recipe.  Will make this one again.  served with cilantro lime rice recipe (my cilantro had gone bad in fridge) so it was just lime rice but still good!  Sauce reduced fine on high heat while grilling the meat but it didn't thicken up like gravy, not that I expected it to.

This recipe was good, but not something that I would want to add to my menu rotation.We were worried that it would be a little salty so we added half a cup more water and it helped a lot.

This was very good. A little on the salty side, but overall very tasty.  We added a little butter and flour to the sauce at the end to finish and thicken it.

I halved the recipie because their were only two of us, omited the bay leaves as I didn't have any and used about half regular half low sodium soy sause.  Still my guy and I really liked the chicken but the sause never really tightened up at all and was really salty.  I'll definatly make the chicken again, but will proably skip the sause.

This was one of the saltiest dishes I've ever tasted.  I should have looked at the nutrition link before I made it.  116% of the RDA for Sodium.  116% of your DAILY allowance of sodium...WOW!  This went basically in the trash.  Yuck.

Overall this is a good recipe and I would have rated it much higher but even reducing the soy sauce to 1 cup made it way too salty for my family. The other seasonings are good and other than the salty taste, the flavors meld well during simmering. I didn't grill the chicken, just thickened the sauce with a w/ cornstarch & water. When I make this again I will reduce the soy sauce even further to 1/2 cup and increase the water to 2 &1/2 cups

I made this with breasts instead of thighs, and it turned out pretty good, however I think the boil time was a little long for using white meat instead of dark meat, and they overcooked just a bit.  I'll have to try it again with thighs, but it was a great recipe!  Served it over Cilantro Lime Rice

My mom usually cooks the Filipino food and when I showed here this recipe she was skeptical about bbq'n this since she usually cooks it the traditional way.  But now everytime I uses this recipe she likes this way instead. I think 40 minutes is too long for it to cook over the stove.  So I reduce it to about 15 - 20 minutes and then bbq it.

Delicious!  Be careful with the reduction because it can end up with a very strong flavor, but putting a little on top of the chicken really makes the dish pop.

My husband really liked the taste of the chicken.  I used less soy sauce and more water and also  broiled chicken instead of grilling.  The leftover sauce wasn't very good on rice and veggies, but the final chicken product was very moist and flavorful.  Next time I'll marinate veggies or just put soy sauce on them.

I am sorry to give this recipe such a low rating but all I could taste was the soy sauce.  The chicken was so salty that my husband had a hard time getting the chicken down.  Thanks for sharing though.

This turned out great. The final grilling transforms the grey-looking thighs into colorful & crispy pieces. I cut the soy sauce down and increased the water; the resulting chicken pieces were not salty. Unfortunately, after reducing the liquid, it was still too salty. Still, I recommend this.

This is really good. I cut the recipe in half to make 6 chicken thighs and I broiled it. I'd prefer a thicker sauce, but the chicken was really tender and flavorful. I make this all the time now.

Wow!  This was great!  I took other's advice and added a chopped onion.  My family loves mushrooms so I added a can of mushrooms and rather than grill the chicken I broiled it because it was a little cold outside.  Served the remaining broth once simmered over white rice; added a side salad and dinner was served!  Easy!

I scaled the recipe down to 4 servings, left out the bay leaf because I don't have any, and I used chicken breast instead of thighs.  I thought this recipe was really good.  Thighs would be better, more moist.  I just never have them on hand.  My picky toddler even liked his "bobo chicken."  Will definitely make again.  Thanks for sharing, Donna!

This dish was very tasty, but a little too salty.  I'd suggest using salt-reduced soy.  I also added a dash of dry sherry, a little lemon juice, a pinch of sugar and some extra garlic.  Yum!

Pretty good recipe. It needed a little more honey for a better balance of flavors, but I prefer sweeter to salty. Also, it didn't need to cook for 30 to 40 minutes plus more cook time on the grill.

This is the first time that I made a recipe using chicken thighs that my husband actually liked!  This recipe was delicious.  I made it exactly as the recipe is written, and I used my grill pan to grill the chicken indoors.  I served it over rice.  My family highly recommends it!

For those that don't like a strong vinegar flavor, use more traditional rice vinegar which is quite a bit milder than our standard vinegar.  Serve over rice for a traditional meal.

Wonderful!  I usually don't care for chicken thighs, but with this recipe I love them, and so do all my friends and family.  And so easy for summer BBQs.  You can do everything beforehand, and just pop them on the BBQ for a few minutes when it's time to eat.  Thanks!

I was a nanny for a Filipino chef and fell in love with his adobo. This recipe comes as close as I could find to his (which he would never share!) The first time I made it I ran out of soy sauce, so I didn't use as much as the recipe called for. It was very good. This time I used the amounts called for and it was a bit too much. I added an additional 1/4 cup vinegar, and that balanced it back out. I also use 5 bay leaves and peppercorns instead of ground. (That's how he did it.) I cook it in the crock pot all day. It takes no time at all and my kids love it! (I don't grill it.) The sauce is wonderful over rice. It's a bit oily though, so I seperate before serving.

This meal wasn't that good.  I did however accidentally leave out the honey until after I strained out the food particles.  But, grilling it was almost impossible because the chicken fell off the bone was too easily.  I think it would have been better to take off the skin before cooking it.  But, I won't try it again because I really didn't like the sauce.  That's not this recipie though-- just in general.  It's probably an acquired taste.

Boot leather if you follow the timing and use the mechanically bones and skinned thighs from the store (costco in this instance).  Grilling gives a nice texture, but timings for each part of the recipe (simmer then grill) are almost enough in themselves to cook the chicken.  And too much liquid for the quantity of chicken.

Very easy and came out extremely tender. Used boneless, skinless thighs.  Added liquid smoke and Worcestershire sauce as well.  Did put under broiler for a bit but don’t think I would the next time.

Made it with low sodium soy sauce. Make sure you spray your tablespoon with cooking spray to make measuring the honey easier. Crowd favorite. Every time I've made it people have asked for the recipe. I put it over copycat Chipotle Chilantro Lime Rice.

Fantastic. Admittedly I added sesame oil, sesame seeds and a few tps of crushed red pepper.  My additions are more my suiting. But the over all product was very tasty.

What is the preferred type of vinegar to use in this recipe?    I haven't made this recipe yet but I gave it 4 stars so I wouldn't skew the ratings.  Wish submitters would list either brands or specific types of ingredients so I have a better chance for a positive outcome!  Thanks

Came out so delicious . I found that I didn't like it with too much vinegar because It was overwhelming so I just added some more soy sauce and brown sugar instead of just honey and it came out wonderful . I grilled half and the other half I just ate with some white rice . So much flavor!

The best I've had in a long time.  I increased water and cooked uncovered, sauce thickened on its' own. This is also good with pork shoulder, cut in cubes and increase cook time till tender.

Prepared as written except for serving with sauce. We enjoyed it with corn on the cob instead of rice. It's already added to my favorites.  Easy to prepare with ingredients on hand and enjoyed by entire family.

This is a new family favorite. Definitely use low salt soy sauce. In winter when it's too cold to grill we just pull the chicken out after it's done cooking. We shred it and throw it in a pan and stir fry it with some rice. Thanks

Very tasty. Just the right combination of flavors, without being overpowering. I used boneless skinless thigh meat, and made foil packets to bake in the oven. Came out moist, and flavorful.

This was wonderful. I can see why some would say it is too salty - however, we didn't fee like it was. I would recommend cutting down the soy a bit though. You can always add more saltiness but you can't get rid of it once its there. Try it with 1 cup rather than 1 1/2. I used rice vinegar and would recommend trimming the fat off the thighs before cooking. Fantastic recipe. I served it with "roasted beets n sweets" from this recipe and it paired beautifully.

Very yummy. Didn't think it tasted too salty. I think I like it better not grilled. I put a couple of the pieces on the Forman since it's too cold outside. I prefer the ungrilled pieces of chicken. Will def add to our meal rotation!

ok, sooo good. I made the sauce first.. reduced for about 20 min, then cooled. then put half on chicken to marinate for 8 hr.  I then grilled the (boneless/skinless breasts) and drizzled the remaining sauce over.  my other modifications were 1/2 tsp cayenne and 2 tsp brown sugar to the original marinade.  So awesome and easy!!!

Excellent and easy!  My husband and kids all LOVED it.  The aroma in the kitchen was mouth watering from the very beginning.  We made the recipe exactly as stated except cut back on the soy sauce.  We also used apple cider vinegar.  Try this- while the chicken is on the grill, cut up some broccoli and toss it into the boiling sauce.  Very delicious and will definitely make this again!  Would be a crowd pleaser when company comes over.

I messed this up, but it still tasted great.  Followed the recipe as written until the end, when i left the pot of marinade unattended and burned it so couldn't use it.  Also didn't bother to grill the chicken.  Still thought it was good!  Some sauce would have been nice, will try this one again.

I was stuck with "Kikkoman Lite" so after getting 3 spoon fulls of old drying up honey I put in probably a spoon or 2 of brown sugar. Though I could see the oil sitting up top the sauce, it didn't taste oily to me or my dad, came out very well. Sauce made everything else we made taste better XD

this was great!! but having made adobo before i knew to watch that soy sauce, it will become way to salty. was great on the grill, but will boil for less time next time. it makes the chicken so tender it falls apart on the gill. Thanks for sharing, loved it!!!

Used 1 c soy sauce and 2 cups water. Wasn't too salty with this ratio. I was disappointed with the end result. With such good rating and reviews i was expecting something better. Won't be making this again.

I didn't care for this chicken. I feel that the boiling time may be too long. My husband and I really thought the chicken was dried out. My daughter however loved it saying, "juicy chicken is gross!" haha so I guess if you are like my fifteen year old this is for you!

I was very excited to give this chicken a try.  It looked wonderful.  I have to stress the fact that ordinary soy sauce is WAY TOO SALTY for this dish.  The chicken itself had a nice flavour aside from the salt content.  I will make this again someday, but will either half the soy sauce or buy the kind suggested in a previous post.

Not to my taste. It was too salty... a little too much soy sauce. I tried the leftovers the next day in chicken wrap; to no avail... it simply had no substance.

This was an excellent meal. It was a bit salty from the soy, but other than that it was very flavorful.

I personally didn't enjoy this chicken, but everybody else LOVED it.  Will make again, but without the extra sauce.  The chicken was better without it.

This was absolutely delicious! In fact, I was so impressed with it that tonight I am making it for guests. It is our second time having it within four nights. The only thing I did differently was to leave out the salt since the soy sauce is salty enough already.

This was nice and easy to prepare.  I used a whole cut frier that I skinned instead of boneless breasts.  I found that cooking the chicken for 30 minutes plus 2 minutes on each side on the grill resulted in slightly over cooked rubbery chicken.  Great flavor though!  I'm glad that the weather was nice as I needed to air out the house...the smell is great, but very intense with the vinegar and soy.  I will do this one again.

AWESOME!! My sister in law is Philipino and made this often, but I never got the recipe for it. This is great! One thing I did differently(by mistake at first, but loved it), was grill the chicken first (I did it on the smoker) and then add to mixture to reduce sauce. The chicken really soaks up the flavor.YUM!

I followed the recipe with low sodium soy sauce and reduce it to 1 cup and it came out yummy, although it looked a little different than the picture....mine didn't have that red color to it. It was more a brown. Grilling it really made the difference.  We were in the middle of a huge snow storm so I used an indoor grill.

I just made this for dinner and I'm sorry to say that it was horrible.  Way, way TOO SALTY.  I only used 1 cup of reduced sodium soy sauce and increased the water portion by 1/2 cup and it was still too salty.  Then we grilled it and it came out BLACK after 2 1/2 minutes, it was ridiculous.  We almost threw the whole thing away but felt too guilty to do so and the bad part is... we still have a ton of leftovers.  Very disappointing.

This was a good recipe that I will make again. The chicken was so tender.
I made it for 6 servings, used low sodium soy sauce, increased water 1/2 cup and ommitted the bay leaf. 

So yum.

I usually prefer the breast over the thighs, but these were great!  I didn't find them at all greasy, perhaps because I used skinless, boneless, with the fat trimmed.  I even looked for grease and tried to skim the it off the top of the broth before reducing it, but there wasn't enough there to make it worthwhile.  I also used low salt tamari instead of soy sauce.

Very tasty.  I used low sodium soy sauce and it came out great.  I think this would be a terrific recipe for a summer time backyard dinner.  It should be easy to expand and most of the cooking is done in the pot.

yummy, just used 1/2 cup of soy sauce and it was delish.  I served right after grilling and the remaining chicken I let soak in the sauce so it wouldn't dry out.  This is a keeper

My kids love it. I made it in the crockpot with frozen chicken so that it won't fall apart. My son tried it before I have a chance to broil it (too cold outside for grilling) and he thinks it's similar. Made it again tonight and decided that it is much better with the grilling.

I was surprised at how much I liked this recipe, since I don't usually use soy sauce at all! It was pretty salty, though, so I think I would use less soy sauce next time. But overall, a GREAT recipe that I will definitely use again.

Being filipino I've always cooked adobo in just one pot, but this grilling idea gave it a better kick.
Those who are worried about too much soy sauce or salt thats what adobo is all about. Kikoman does have a reduced salt sauce haven't tried it though my mom would throw a fit!
I added minced ginger and please don't forget the peppercorns! Thanks for sharing this idea!

The best thing about this recipe was how tender the chicken came out.  I was expecting something with more flavor but it was mild and a accent to the chicken.  Overall it was okay.

Excellent recipe.  It is not necessary to grill it but does give it a little extra texture to it.  Do not overcook the thighs in the mixture.

This was soooo good! I was amazed most by my husband. He hates vinegar, and ate 2 helpings. I used more garlic, less soy and brown sugar like others suggested -I will make this again and again! Thanks Donna Luna!

I followed the recipe exactly but the chicken didn't absorb any of the flavors. It came out a bit bland.

Simple and delicious!  You don't even have to grill it...it's good right out of the pot :)
