This is very good dish, especially for such a simple recipe. I used half and half and wisked in 1 tablespoon flour for thickness. In the future, I may try adding some fresh garlic. Also, if your cajun/creole seasoning doesn't have salt added, be sure to add some salt!

This recipe is great. You may want to use linguene instead of angel hair pasta. Also make sure you use a cooking pot when reducing the cream, it likes to boil over. If you dont have enough crawfish scalops mixed in workds great.

Great recipe, although I would make two suggestions.

1) Use linguine instead of angel hair.  

2) Most cajun seasonings are incredibly salty.  Keep that in mind and half the amount of seasoning if salty foods bother you.

And I'll also say that it took a very long time for my sauce to thicken.  Allow  over an hour when planning this meal!

Great recipe!  Thanks!

I halved the recipe and added sliced mushrooms, chopped tomatoes, crawfish and crab meat.  I also followed the suggestions of other readers and added 1.5 cups cream and 1.5 cups half and half.  It was pretty thick after reducing it but then adding the veggies and meat made it even thicker and I didn't have to add any starch.  I used 1.5 tablespoons of Tony Chachere's Creole seasoning and found it to be a bit too salty.  Next time I will try just 1 tablespoon and or try another Cajun seasoning.  Overall, it was very good and also looked nice!

I made this for a potluck and it was well liked by all.  I used penne instead of angel hair to make it easier to serve.  I used shrimp and crab and used 3 cups cream, 3 cups half and half.  It takes a long, long, long, time to reduce and turned out really wet.  Next time I'll probably just use 1.5 cups cream and 1.5 cups half and half.

We actually really liked this recipe with one fault.  It was so salty.  Don't get me wrong I love salt hate sweets but this was way out of bounds.  I didn't even use the amounts called for in the recipe but it was still  way too salty.  I added some white wine to try to tame it but that did not really work.  I would recommend this recipe with one change.  That is to use a homemade cajun seasoning so that you could regulate the salt content.

Not very exciting - however I didn't follow the recipe. The shrimp was very bland; it would be much better using raw shrimp and sauteing in garlic. I halved the recipe and sauteed 1 red bell pepper and 1 tsp. garlic in the butter. Then added 2 c. half n half and 1 c. whole milk to that. Added salt to taste, steamed broccoli and added that with green onion and shrimp. My kids don't like spicy, so I didn't use the cajun seasoning. I like the sauce, but the shrimp was VERY boring. Next time I'll add raw shrimp with the bell pepper and saute, then remove the shrimp and make the recipe just as I did above.

It was really good.  I wish that the recipe said to not cook the pasta until like 45 mintues into cooking the sauce because the sauce takes FOREVER.  So everything was cold by the time it was ready.  That really bothered me, but other than that, it had a fantastic flavor.

This recipe tasted pretty good, but was way too rich.  Next time I will not use half the whipping cream it called for.  Fat free half and half also will work and is not as fatting.

this is quick basic recipe - I only had 1/2 & 1/2 on hand at the time.  I reduced that down some as recipe calls for & I added about 1/4 block of velvetta cheese to mine & melted down with the cream to make it a little thicker.. It was perfect.

This was very good recipe.  May want to add corn starch next time to get the sauce to thicken up.  Will make again.  Matt really enjoyed!

Greetings from Sweden! My boyfriend and parents really enjoyed this recipe. The peppers suited the crayfish very well, and I strongly advise keeping them in the recipe. As another member recommended, I added some extra tomato sauce and some garlic. :D

I sauteed red and green peppers,mushrooms,onions and a little garlic and added to the thickened sauce. Then added precooked large shrimp and cooked until well heated.
It was absolutely wonderful! This can be eaten on a low carb diet without adding pasta. Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this exactly as the recipe called, except I switched half and half for the heavy cream.  (both $$ and calorie reducer)  It does take quite awhile for  the sauce to reduce.    It was pretty good for just me, but if having it for company I would use the heavy cream.  (at least half of it)  

I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars because mine turned out quite salty.  I really like salty foods, but this was a bit too much even for me.  If I make this again in the future, I will use either salt-free cajun seasoning, or reduce the amount.

I put shredded parmesan on top, and served with garlic texas toast.  Quite good, but overall a bit rich for my tastes.

This is an awesome, quick and easy recipe.  I have made 3 times already.  Everybody loved it.  I did cut back on the amount of whipping cream and added more cajun seasonings (we like things hot) and a little garlic salt.  Definitely a keeper!

Everyone enjoyed this.  I used 1% milk and some cornstarch to cut down on the fat/cal.  It worked well.  Next time I may indulge and use the cream....  just to see how it compares.

I use this recipe with chicken and it turns out great! Either slice a baked breast, place it on the pasta, then cover with sauce OR cut chicken as you wish and mix in the sauce then pour over pasta. A super easy quick meal that's delicious!

Great recipe though I did change a bit and followed others' advice.  Used a combination of cream and fat free half and half.  Made the sauce separately so we could choose how much to put on each serving.  Cooked asparagus, mushrooms, cherry toms (split), and green onions, then added uncooked shrimp (didn't have precooked on hand).  Assembled according to how much sauce each person wanted (less for my mother-in-law, more for my husband).  BIG HIT!  McCormick's creole seasoning was perfect.  Also added a bit of grated parm when served.

This was excellent--only criticism I have is that I wish the author had been a little more specific on cooking the sauce down until reduced--I am far from a "natural" at cooking, so I need specific instructions.  ;)  I brought to a boil, then simmered on medium/low until my pasta was cooked.  It never really reduced, but I poured the whole thing over the pasta and shrimp and it turned out great.

So easy and yummy! I may have let the sauce cook a bit too long, once it starts really reducing watch it carefully, as it will seperate quickly. This has a great flavor, similiar to an all-day shrimp-stock pasta my mom makes on special occasions.

This is awesome!  I made it with crab meat instead and I used Emeril seasoning instead of Cajon seasoning and it really reminded me a whole lot of the Tumbawumba Pasta that they make at Outback Steakhouse.  I was Really impressed!

Pretty good (I don't like green onions, otherwise it would probably get 5 stars) try tossing in some cocktail sauce to give the seafood some "bam"!

My husband would have given it 4 stars but I say three. Don't get me wrong, I thought it was okay, but the sauce was thin, and it didn't taste good enough to me to be worth the calories.

My Hubby loves the "Shells" restaurant crawfish pasta. This tastes just like it. I added extra cajun seasoning and a little of Emeril's "Bam" to it. I cut it down to 4 cups of Cream and it made 6 servings.

It was Ok but I don't think I will make it again.  I thought the sauce took a long time to reduce and was still a little soupy, I had to add corn starch to thicken it up a bit.

I changed the creole spice to only 2 tbsp, 3 would have been too spicy and salty. I also used half heavy cream and half milk. Fam loved it!

I was looking for a simple cajun shrimp pasta recipe and this one certainly appeared to fit the bill, however when I went shopping for the (extremely) few ingredients I needed, I was met with quite a sticker shock on the heavy cream!!  I couldn't justify spending over $10 on heavy cream alone, so I cheated, bought a jar of prepared alfredo sauce and added the cajun spice and green onions.  we still loved it!

I scaled this to three servings, and I had enough for a good-sized meal and a small amount for a lighter meal. I didn't have the heavy whipping cream on hand, so as others did as a substitute, I added a few tblsp of 2% milk. I also added a few good-sized cloves of chopped garlic, as this dish screams for it. I used shrimp and dusted half of them with the Cajun seasoning. That gave it a nice subtle flavoring, not overwhelming, and I appreciated that. I also added some chopped tomato, and that added some good color and flavor. Topped with sea salt, cracked pepper and parmesan cheese. Add vino and you're all set! Very good dish that I'm sure to make again.  Thanks!

Loved the recipe,  I have made this many of times,  I use crayfsh, penne and 1/2 the creole seasoning.  I am giving this a 4 because left overs don't go over well,  the butter seperates and crayfish isn't tasty overcooked.

I liked this dish a lot. It did take a long time for the sauce to reduce, though. It was somewhat bland when I added it to the pasta. I think next time I will use crawfish instead of shrimp in hopes that it will bring more flavor to the dish.

We liked this one - it's really easy to prepare. We used Zatarain's cajun seasoning which gave it a great flavor and added some steamed asparagus just to give it a little color. Next time I'll add some mushrooms as well.

This is a really tasty and easy recipe.  I cut it down alot and make it for myself when my husband is out of town since he's not a seafood lover.  It takes awhile for the cream sauce to reduce and sometimes I get impatient and don't let it reduce all the way but it's still tasty.  I sprinkle grated parmesan on top and usually use whole wheat noodles (just because I don't eat a lot of white pasta).  I think I might try this with chicken too for my husband.  I highly recommed this one!

I made this for the first time last night and it was very good!  I thought it would need extra spices to make it really tasty but the cajun seasoning was all it needed.  It wasn't too hot but just right.  Thanks.  I am adding this to my dinner rotation.

This is really good and simple. I've been making it for a while now. I add a little salt if I use saltless Cajun. Definatley needs less Cajun if it has salt in it. Kids like it as well.

This was a great dish.  I did not use the full amount of cream - added a little milk instead.  I also lightly sauteed the green onions before adding them to the sauce.  After reading other reviews, I also added Paul Prudhmme's seafood majic and a very small amount of sherry for extra taste.  Turned out great.

Tasted GREAT!!!  Had to add more cajun seasoning than what was listed but that may be because we're from Louisiana
