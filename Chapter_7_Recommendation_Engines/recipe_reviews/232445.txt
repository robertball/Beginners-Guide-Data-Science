This was good, only used 2 pork chops & fewer potatoes, put everything in a baking pan covered with foil. I cooked it for 2 hours because we really like our veggies soft.And I took everything out of the pan & added a few tablespoons of corn starch to the broth, put it back in the oven for a few more minutes and got a great thick gravy to cover everything.

Although I was skeptical about "baking" pork chops, the final result was delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly and was not disappointed.  In fact I used the same basic recipe with thick cut rib-eye steaks changing only the dry soup mix from onion to mushroom and adding a dash of Worcestershire sauce to the gravy.  Again, a fabulous, tender result.  Thank you for this great recipe.

So easy!  I had 4 pork chops, so decreased other ingredients accordingly.  Put everything in a 15x10 jelly roll pan that had 1 inch sides and covered with foil.  Pork chops were tender and veggies cooked perfectly.  With only one pan to clean, this is the answer to the roast pork dinner!

This was great!  I used baby honey gold potatoes, home made beef broth and organic onion soup mix in attempt to weed out chemicals/preservatives. One dirty pan, everybody happy. What could be better?  The taste was great and the veggies were perfectly cooked. I will be making this again!

My husband and i love this for an easy, one pan, no mess dinner. I prepare exactly as directed during times when seasonal vegetables aren't available. When fresh garden vegetables are on hand I add things that we love such as asparagus, cauliflower or broccoli. I love to switch it up to make it seem like we aren't eating the same thing over and over,  plus this is a great recipe for diabetics like me. I use one small potato per person and we're fully satisfied when we leave the table.It's fantastic no matter how it's prepared. I highly encourage everyone to try this one! Thanks for sharing it!

I didn't have onion soup mix so I improvised with a vegetable soup mix. It was too soupy and bland.  The next day I roasted the potatoes and carrots without any beef broth and it created a nice brown crust on the veggies which helped.  Not a make again for me.

Easy to make and turned out well. Nothing exciting about it though and I probably won’t make it again (but, there are very few things I make more than once—that’s the fun of cooking for me).

Great easy recipe! Made exactly as shown except added more vegetables because my family loves veggies. Cooked about 2hours to get extra vegetables softer. My children loved it. Made enough for three meals.  Watch how much salt you put in. Doesn't need much. I will definitely make this again. Like the idea of the cornstarch.

Very simple, quick dish. Good flavor.  I did saute mushrooms in wine and oil and put them on top.  Next time I might brown the pork chops before baking.  Overall, a great recipe for a week night when you're in a hurry.  Also, a great recipe for tweaking and making it your own!

Made it according to the recipe. Had to cook for a longer time. Vegetables where not done. Seems to have a blah taste.

I made this last night and will definitely be making it again. I used 8 chops and increased the soup mix to two packets and it was delicious.

Great recipe! I've made this several times now & my family loves it.  It's so easy to throw everything into a baking dish then into the oven.  As for the "soupy" comments from previous reviewers, that's how my family likes it.  I am going to try the comment to add cornstarch to make a gravy.  Sounds like a great idea!
