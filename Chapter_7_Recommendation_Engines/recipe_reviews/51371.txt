THis was really yummy, cool and refreshing! I made a few changes though: I could not find pico de gallo seasoning so I used about 1/2 tsp of taco seasoning, added chopped green onions, Chopped water chestnuts, and 1/4 to 1/2 cup extra sour cream. Also I used marinated artichoke hearts for a little extra flavor. I served it with veggies and everyone loved it!

I wasn't sure id like this, but i have to say that this is going to be made often at my house for sure! I grated my zucchini, skin and all, instead of chopping it & after I sprinkled it w/ salt I wrapped the zucchini in a few paper towels and squeezed out all the liquid over the sink...its MUCH faster than waiting for the liquid to drip out on its own in the fridge! I did the same thing to the artichokes. I had some hot salsa seasoning on hand so I used that instead and I skipped the hot sauce because the seasoning I have is super spicey! I think I doubled the amount of olives, added a dash or two of garlic powder and I used mayo instead of sour cream (I was out) as well. This tasted good right after everything was mixed, I'm sure it will only get better as it sits and the flavors blend... thanks for sharing!

Very easy and very good!  I couldn't find "pico de gallo seasoning", so I used "salsa seasoning" instead.  I found it in the area at the store where they sell other kinds of packet seasonings such as chili, meatloaf, taco, etc.  I added an extra dollop of sour cream (no reason, I just felt like it), but other than that, I made the recipe as is.  I served it with a variety of crackers.  If you prefer, I'm sure this recipe could be lightened-up without affecting the taste by using reduced fat cream cheese and light or fat free sour cream.  I will definitely make this again.

Made this for a card party and it was a big hit. I didn't find Pico de Gallo seasoning till later so I also used salsa and added green onions and 2 cloves of fresh garlic. I was to die for.

This was a very nice recipe.  I am not sure what pico de gallo seasoning is, but I just made up a small batch of pico de gallo and used that.  It worked very well.  I will definitely make this again!

This was a good dip with some nice, soft Italian Bread.  My girlfriend put in probably more olives than the recipe called for but I still enjoyed it.  Like others, I used salsa in place of the pico de gallo seasoning and it worked. I used a green habenero pepper sauce as my hot sauce and it was just enough to give an after taste tingle.  I was a fan of this recipe.  Just have to remember that the zucchini needs some time to drain.

My local grocery store doesn't carry the pico de gallo seasoning.  I had salsa in the frig, so I added that. I tried the dip with both 100% whole wheat crackers and raw veggies.  I really liked the dip with the crackers.  Made a great mid morning snack. I'd bet it would be good with the pico de gallo seasoning.  I would make again.

I made this for my sisters wedding. They had appitizers in between the ceramony and the dinner, along with wine tasting. This was the first dip to go. Everyone loved it! Everyone was asking for the recipe! It was also cute because their names are Amy and Zach. :) I used the salsa seasoning instead still turned out great!

I have made this dip twice and both times it went over great! I served it with bagles cut into 1" pieces. I wasn't able to find Pice de gallo seasoning so I put in a little cilantro, lime juice, and a little salt. Worked just fine- I know I had a hard time stopping eating it.

Based on other comments, I substituted fresh pico de gallo for the pico de gallo seasoning.  I also added garlic powder and red pepper for more zing.  Also, unless you're serving extremely big eaters, this recipe makes much more than the 2 servings listed.  I would say that this would make 4 - 6 servings.

This is very good.  Left out the olives as my family does not like them. Added 3 green onions and appx. 1 cup fresh pico de gallo, drained.  Very good with tortilla chips and wheat thins.

I made this for my daughter's H.S. graduation party....it was a hit! Instead of pico de gallo seasoning, I used a small amount of fresh, homemade pico de gallo! So good, and it gave even more texture! Delicious....and I used fat free ingrdients, but you can't even tell!

I had to add extra garlic, cilantro, and more salsa seasoning just like the other reviewers noted.  This can be a tasty dip, you just have to add some extra ingredients to get it there!  It's pretty bland as is.

I read all of the reviews first and basically added all of the extras everyone mentioned: water chestnuts, fresh cilantro, green onions, lime juice and I also added a little fresh minced garlic.  Additionally, I too used taco seasoning as I didn't have (couldn't find in the store) cilantro seasoning.  I also used fat free/reduced fat ingredients and you would never know.  It turned out great - made my husband taste test and he gave it two thumbs up.  I'm taking it to a ladies book club tonight for the big "test".
