We loved this simple and easy recipe! I used 6 chicken breasts and sprinkled garlic powder and paprika to taste while sauting them.  Since I had 6 chicken breasts, I stuck with the recipe required 2 cups of water, which resulted in a good, thick gravy. However, I MIGHT reduce the water to 1 1/2 cups if I only make 4 breasts. Also, next time I will not add the cheese until the last 15 minutes of cooking...I like my cheese creamy, not brown and cooked hard to the chicken. Still, the taste was there and we will make this again!

This recipe was REALLY good! I changed it up a bit.  In the flour, I seasoned it with a pinch of garlic powder, basil, parsley, oregano, crushed red pepper, paprika.  Then I pounded out the chicken until it was really thin.  Then I coated them in flour, put cheese in the middle, and rolled them up.  I then put more cheese (cheddar, mozzarella, and parmesan) on top and put them in the oven.  I only used 2 chicken breasts but cut them each in half to make 4 pieces.  I only used one cup water and half a pack on onion soup but there WASN'T enough 'gravy'.   I will definitley make this again but probably use 3/4 cup water and 3/4 pack of soup.  45 mins is a little too long too. Maybe 30-35 next time!! The boyfriend had NO complaints and my roomate got seconds! I love this recepie! VERY eay to make!

Found this accidentally one night and had the ingredients on hand and said what the heck and literally whipped the dish together...my roommates (2 very pick boys) FLIPPED for this dish.. home cooked goodness.  I have made this dish a couple times since with some slight variations (use bisquick and seasonings in place of plain flour) and a vareity of cheese including parmesan, cheddar and jack... DELICIOUS.. THank you to the originator!

This is a great meal if: you haven't cooked in a long time and need to get your feet wet; you're in a jam and need something simple. I was both!
We enjoyed this dish, especially my husband, but I don't know if I'll make it all that often. To make it healthier, I used olive oil to brown the chicken in, and used wheat germ as the 'flour' to dredge the chicken in, which worked pretty well! I did appreciate the advice of others and added the cheese during the last 15 mins. of cooking. Also, I added cubed red potatoes to the bottom of the baking dish before adding anything else. It made a complete meal, and the potatoes came out fantastic.

This wasn't bad.. but rather bland. I likely won't be making it again as is.. I may play around with some additional spices to flavor it up. I suggest adding spices if you're going to try this recipe.

This had such great flavor and smelled awesome while in the oven.  I will definately make this again.  I added the cheese during the last 10 minutes and cut the chicken into large stips.  Definately must use the 9x13 pan.  This was a fast and easy recipe.

I was disappointed with this recipe. It was very soupy! After reading other comments, I added less onion soup to lessen the oniony taste, but it was too soupy.

It was very easy, and tasted good. However, it is VERY oniony; I made it for dinner and was still tasting onion at lunch the next day.  If I made it again, I would either double the chicken or halve the onion soup mix.

Thanks for the recipe.  I did add salt, pepper and garlic powder to flour for coating chicken breasts before browning.  Also added diced tomatoes and white wine to the sauce.  Baked uncovered for 30-40 minutes then topped each chicken breast with lots of cheddar cheese for the last 10 minutes of baking time. Delicious! Will make again.

The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is the salt content. I used 1 package of soup mix and 2 cups of water. I also mixed flour and bread crumbs half and half. I served it with mushroom risotto. We all loved this recipe. My husband and son argued over who got to take the left overs for lunch the next day.

I thought this recipe was great. I was unsure about the quantity of water and onion for the gravy and cut the amounts in half. That worked great! Also, I put hot sauce on the chicken after browning along with italian seasoning and garlic salt. It was a big hit and I will surely make it again!

I decided to try this recipe tonight & it was fantastic! I only tweaked a few minor things. I added in a little bit of garlic powder to the flour & I waited to put the cheese on until the last 15 minutes. I served the chicken over buttered egg noodles. It was perfection!

I was in search of an onion soup and chicken recipe since that's about all I had to work with besides the regular seasonings.  I used 5 breasts, also followed others advice and added garlic powder, paprika, basil, oregano, crushed red pepper and parsley mixed in the flour (I used Bisquick instead).  Cooked for less than 30 min. let it set for 10min.  I did add cheese as called for..I recommend adding cheese at the end and broiling to brown the cheese.  The leftovers 2 days later were even BETTER!!!

Very easy to make and my husband and I loved it. I read what others wrote and also made some changes. I seasoned the flour with garlic, salt, pepper and Italian seasoning and I only used about a cup and a half of water but I did use the whole onion soup packet. I also cut up potatoes and put the chicken on top of them and cooked for 45 minutes adding the cheese 10 minutes before it was done. It came out perfectly and was very tasty, if I had not used potatoes I could see serving over rice or noodles. I had only used 3 chicken breasts and I found that doing it this way there was not too much excess liquid and what there was I spooned over the chicken and potatoes when I served it.

This went over pretty well at our house. I followed the advice of the other reviewers and cut the water in half. I used half the cheese at the start of baking and the other half about the last 20 minutes. Mine did not turn out like the picture-it had very nice cheese coating on the outside. I also used a stoneware baking pan.

This recipe was very good.  I cooked about 5 chicken breasts and dredged them in bisquick instead of flour.  It was very moist and flavorful.  The family really liked it!

This was pretty good. The chicken was very moist and tender. I added Italian seasoning to the flour and used less cheese because it seemed like it would be too greasy with 2 cups.  If I make it again, I will use less water and soup mix too.

After reading other reviews I added rice and used more water and still found it to be too oniony.  It wasn't horrible but I don't see myself making it again anytime soon.

Love this recipe!  Made it for my roommates and they ate it up.  We added spinach and garlic to the recipe to spice it up.  I will definitely make it again.  Party like a rock star!!!

I used thin pork chops instead of chicken and added dry ranch dressing to the flour. I put small chunks of potatoe (also dredged in the flour/ranch mixture) in the bottom of my baking dish and placed the chops on top. I changed the cheese to shredded parmesan in the last 30 min of baking.  Absolutely delicious!

This was delicious. But, of course, I changed it up a bit to what I had on hand. I used WW Flour and Adobo w/ pepper. Fried in EVOO and Butter using Boneless Skinless Thighs. Put frozen potatoes on bottom of pan as previously suggested. Used Campbells Select Carmelized Onion Soup in a can (1 Medium Can - Aprox 15/16 oz). Poured soup over chicken and baked for 30 minutes and then added cheese for last 15 minutes.

Not a big fan of this.  The chicken turned out nice and juicy, but the "crust" from the flour and browning it was just mushy.  Maybe I did it wrong?  The gravy is not gravy...it's just soup.  I added some other seasonings to the flour and the flavor was okay.

This tasted pretty good considering how easy it was.  The sauce was pretty thin, but we just spooned it over the chicken and the rice I made.  Will definatly make again.

Instead of cheddar I used a cheese mix that I usually have on hand and some parm and while I was browning the chicken, I added some garlic powder. Also, as recommended, I cut the cooking time down to 35 minutes and they came out great.

This was a nice, easy recipe that was very reminicent of French onion soup. It didn't "wow" me, but considering the simplicity of it, I'll make it again for sure.

This was wonderful. I took a few peoples suggestions and added only 1 1/2 cup of water and the full package of onion soup mix. I didn't use much cheese just lightly covered the top of the chicken for the last 10-15 mins just long enough to melt the cheese and turn it brown. I served it with Garlic Mashpotatoes and peas seasoned with Mrs. Dash. Made a wonderful meal, perfect for leftovers for next days lunch also.

Really good! I mixed the butter, water, rice, and coups together, then poured it over the chicken. After it cooked about 45 minutes, I took the tin foil off, and topped it with some parmesan cheese and stuck it back in the oven until that melted. Gave it a little extra flavor! Very good recipe!

This was a little bit weird, but very tasty! The sauce didn't thicken up as much as I hoped - I ended up pouring some of the liquid out of the pan. The cheese kind of disappeared too - we could taste it but it didn't melt over the chicken as I had imgained. While it *does* taste of dry onion soup mix (no surprise there!), we didn't think it was over-whelming. I will make this again when I am in a hurry and low on groceries. Thanks, Chris!

Not as good as I was expecting.  The flavor just wasn't intense enough for me.  Overall it was a good tasting recipe and very east to prepare.  May try again and add some extra spices.

It was a little oniony and there was a lot of gravy so I think next time I might try adding a little more water and adding instant rice under the chicken to make it a complete easy meal.  Overall it was great.  I will definitely make it again.

Great recipe!  I was actually kind of suprised, since it has so few ingredients.  It wasn't too oniony for me - I guess it's a matter of personal taste.
