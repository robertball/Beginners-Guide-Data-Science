These were just ok. If I make them again I'll have to make modifications. The flavor was a little bland and definitely not sweet enough. Also, they were a little oily, I guess from the cheese. My husband complained that all he could taste was "oil". Which I assured him there was no oil or butter in them to make it taste that way. Good idea though and probably worth playing around with.

I inadvertently used a little more lemon juice and used a regular dessert wine instead of a port. We liked them as is, but I'll bet with a tweak or 2 you can make this a 5 star dessert.
