Loved it! Whole family wishes I had made more. Followed the recipe exactly and it was wonderful. I might increase the garlic a little next time just because our family likes things really garlicky. But I think it is fine as is, too.

As is, this is a really easy and tasty dish.  I'm not sure the need for the tapioca flour.  I think you could use all purpose flour for all of it.  The family loved it.  Can't wait to make it again.

The family all thought it was very tasty. I made it as is. No need to alter the recipe. Iâ€™ll make it again and keep it in my favourites list.
