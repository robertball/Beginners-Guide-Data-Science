I loved this recipe.  I made a few changes though.  I used 2 cups of frozen fruit (1 cup blueberries 1 cup cherries) and instead of the 1/2 cup juice, I used 1/2 applesauce.  Next time, I'll use only 1/3 applesauce.  I also added cinnamon to the crust.  It turned out excellent!!!!!

This was so easy and yummy! I made only a few changes to it. I used pomegranate juice instead of cherry (i couldn't find cherry juice in the grocery store) I also didn't have splenda on hand so i used all brown sugar.I didn't have unbleached flour so i used all whole wheat flour which turned out good.I also thought cinnamon would give it more flavor, so i added 1/8 teaspoon cinnamon which turned out great! It almost makes the crust taste like oatmeal cookies!! I didn't have a, 8x8 pan so i used my 8x11 which worked fine, except the crust part is thin so the cherries are really prominent! but still yummy!

I made this with chocolate in the center instead of cherries--just used an easy microwave fudge recipe from this site. Super easy and so yummy (with no eggs required!)

This was a super delicious recipe. However, it was so crumbly I had to eat it with a spoon. I realized as I put it into the oven that I didn't account for the high altitude of Colorado when baking this.
